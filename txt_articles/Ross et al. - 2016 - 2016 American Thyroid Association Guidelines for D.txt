46 
 Background: Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential 
47 
therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by 
48 
coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This article describes evidence-
49 
based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to 
50 
generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this 
51 
condition. 
52 
Methods: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously co-sponsored guidelines 
53 
for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011.   Considerable new 
54 
literature has been published since 2011, the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines 
55 
were needed, and assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. 
56 
The task force examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search 
57 
supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach 
58 
that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 
59 
text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of 
60 
evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach recommended by the 
61 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group. 
62 
Results: Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of 
63 
thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves’ hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, 
64 
antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma 
65 
using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves’ disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant 
66 
patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves’ 
67 
orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis.  New 
68 
 paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the 
69 
etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves’ hyperthyroidism with antithyroid 
70 
drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients 
71 
for thyroid surgery.  The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been 
72 
expanded.  
73 
Conclusions: One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were 
74 
developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task 
75 
force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice. 
76 
Introduction 
77 
 
Thyrotoxicosis is a condition having multiple etiologies, manifestations, and 
78 
potential therapies. The term ‘‘thyrotoxicosis’’ refers to a clinical state that results from 
79 
inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues generally due to inappropriately 
80 
high tissue thyroid hormone levels. The term ‘‘hyperthyroidism,’’ as used in these 
81 
guidelines, is a form of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high synthesis and secretion 
82 
of thyroid hormone(s) by the thyroid. Appropriate treatment of thyrotoxicosis requires an 
83 
accurate diagnosis. For example, thyroidectomy is an appropriate treatment for some 
84 
forms of thyrotoxicosis and not for others. Additionally, beta blockers may be used in 
85 
almost all forms of thyrotoxicosis, whereas antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are useful in only 
86 
some. 
87 
 
In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is approximately 1.2% 
88 
(0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical); the most common causes include Graves’ disease 
89 
 (GD), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), and toxic adenoma (TA) (1). Scientific 
90 
advances relevant to this topic are reported in a wide range of literature, including 
91 
subspecialty publications in endocrinology, pediatrics, nuclear medicine, and surgery, 
92 
making it challenging for clinicians to keep abreast of new developments. Although 
93 
guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thyrotoxicosis were 
94 
published previously by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American 
95 
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in 2011 , the ATA determined that 
96 
thyrotoxicosis represents a priority area in need of updated evidence-based practice 
97 
guidelines. 
98 
 
The target audience for these guidelines includes general and subspecialty 
99 
physicians and others providing care for patients with thyrotoxicosis. In this document, 
100 
we outline what we believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice. It is not the 
101 
intent of these guidelines to replace clinical judgment, individual decision making, or the 
102 
wishes of the patient or family. Rather, each recommendation should be evaluated in light 
103 
of these elements in order that optimal patient care is delivered. In some circumstances, it 
104 
may be apparent that the level of care required may be best provided in centers where 
105 
there is specific expertise, and that referral to such centers should be considered. 
106 
Methods of Development of Evidence-Based Guidelines 
107 
Administration 
108 
 
The ATA Executive Council selected a chairperson to lead the task force and this 
109 
individual (D.S.R.) identified the other 10 members of the panel in consultation with the 
110 
 ATA board of directors. Membership on the panel was based on clinical expertise, 
111 
scholarly approach, and representation of adult and pediatric endocrinology, nuclear 
112 
medicine, and surgery. The task force included individuals from North America, South 
113 
America, and Europe. Panel members declared whether they had any potential conflict of 
114 
interest at the initial meeting of the group and periodically during the course of 
115 
deliberations. Funding for the guidelines was derived solely from the general funds of the 
116 
ATA and thus the task force functioned without commercial support. 
117 
 
The task force reviewed the 2011 guidelines and published editorials regarding 
118 
those guidelines, and developed a revised list of the most common causes of 
119 
thyrotoxicosis and the most important questions that a practitioner might pose when 
120 
caring for a patient with a particular form of thyrotoxicosis or special clinical condition. 
121 
One task force member was assigned as the primary writer for each topic.  One or more 
122 
task force members were assigned as secondary writers for each topic, providing their 
123 
specific expertise and critical review for the primary writer.  The relevant literature was 
124 
reviewed using a systematic PubMed search for primary references and reviews 
125 
published after the submission of the 2011 guidelines, supplemented with additional 
126 
published materials found on focused PubMed searches.  Recommendations were based 
127 
on the literature and expert opinion where appropriate. A preliminary document and a 
128 
series of recommendations concerning all of the topics were generated by each primary 
129 
writer and then critically reviewed by the task force at large. The panel agreed 
130 
recommendations would be based on consensus of the panel and that voting would be 
131 
used if agreement could not be reached. Task force deliberations took place between 
132 
 2014 and 2016 during several lengthy committee meetings, and through electronic 
133 
communication. 
134 
Rating of the recommendations 
135 
 
These guidelines were developed to combine the best scientific evidence with the 
136 
experience of seasoned clinicians and the pragmatic realities inherent in implementation. 
137 
The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by 
138 
the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group (3-
139 
6). The balance between benefits and risks, quality of evidence, applicability, and 
140 
certainty of the baseline risk are all considered in judgments about the strength of 
141 
recommendations (7). Grading the quality of the evidence takes into account study 
142 
design, study quality, consistency of results, and directness of the evidence. The strength 
143 
of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies 
144 
to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the 
145 
risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not 
146 
be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences. 
147 
The quality of the evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality 
148 
evidence, or high-quality evidence, based on consistency of results between studies and 
149 
study design, limitations, and the directness of the evidence.  In several instances, the 
150 
evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task 
151 
force made a statement labeled “no recommendation.”  Table 1 describes the criteria to 
152 
be met for each rating category. Each recommendation is preceded by a description of the 
153 
 evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical 
154 
suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring. 
155

[A] Background 
164 
[A1] Causes of thyrotoxicosis 
165 
 
In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is excessively stimulated by 
166 
trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and 
167 
secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of 
168 
preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, 
169 
infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal 
170 
sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic 
171 
differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis).  
172 
  
Hyperthyroidism is generally considered overt or subclinical, depending on the 
173 
biochemical severity of the hyperthyroidism, although in reality the disease represents a 
174 
continuum of overactive thyroid function.  Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a  
175 
subnormal (usually undetectable)  serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with 
176 
elevated serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine estimates (free T4).  
177 
Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable serum TSH with values 
178 
within the normal reference range for both T3 and free T4. Both overt and subclinical 
179 
disease may lead to characteristic signs and symptoms, although subclinical 
180 
hyperthyroidism is usually considered more mild.  Overzealous or suppressive thyroid 
181 
hormone administration may cause either type of thyrotoxicosis, particularly subclinical 
182 
thyrotoxicosis.  Endogenous overt or subclinical thyrotoxicosis is  caused by excess 
183 
thyroid hormone production and release or by inflammation and release of hormone by 
184 
the gland. 
185 
 
Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves’ Disease (GD) or 
186 
nodular thyroid disease.  GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor 
187 
antibodies (TRAb) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production 
188 
and release. The development of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established 
189 
nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time (8). In toxic 
190 
adenomas (TA), autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating 
191 
mutations of genes regulating thyroid growth and hormone synthesis.  Germline 
192 
mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial 
193 
nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism associated with a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid 
194 
gland (9). Autonomous hormone production may progress from subclinical to overt 
195 
 hyperthyroidism, and the administration of pharmacologic amounts of iodine to such 
196 
patients may result in iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (10). GD is the most common 
197 
cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (11,12). Although toxic nodular goiter is 
198 
less common than GD, its prevalence increases with age and in the presence of dietary 
199 
iodine deficiency. Therefore, toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than 
200 
GD in older patients, especially in regions of iodine deficiency (13,14). Unlike toxic 
201 
nodular goiter, which is progressive (unless triggered by excessive iodine intake), 
202 
remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment (15). 
203 
 
Less common causes of thyrotoxicosis include the entities of painless and 
204 
subacute thyroiditis, which occur due to inflammation of thyroid tissue with release of 
205 
preformed hormone into the circulation. Painless thyroiditis caused by lymphocytic 
206 
inflammation appears to occur with a different frequency depending on the population 
207 
studied: in Denmark it accounted for only 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients, it was 6% of 
208 
patients in Toronto and 22% of patients in Wisconsin (16-18). 
209 
 
Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium (19), cytokine (e.g., interferon-
210 
alpha) (20), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (21), and in the postpartum period it is 
211 
referred to as postpartum thyroiditis (22).   A painless destructive thyroiditis (not usually 
212 
lymphocytic) occurs in 5–10% of amiodarone-treated patients (23). Subacute thyroiditis 
213 
is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain 
214 
(24). 
215 
 
216 
 [A2] Clinical consequences of thyrotoxicosis 
217 
 
The cellular actions of thyroid hormone are mediated by T3, the active form of 
218 
thyroid hormone. T3 binds to a specific nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of 
219 
many genes. Non-genomic actions of thyroid hormone also regulate numerous important 
220 
physiologic functions.  
221 
 
Thyroid hormone influences almost every tissue and organ system. It increases 
222 
tissue thermogenesis and basal metabolic rate (BMR) and reduces serum cholesterol 
223 
levels and systemic vascular resistance. Some of the most profound effects of increased 
224 
thyroid hormone levels are on the cardiovascular system (25). Untreated or partially 
225 
treated thyrotoxicosis is associated with loss of weight, osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, 
226 
embolic events, muscle weakness, tremor, neuropsychiatric symptoms and rarely 
227 
cardiovascular collapse and death (26,27).  There is only moderate correlation between 
228 
the degree of thyroid hormone elevation  and clinical signs and symptoms. Symptoms 
229 
and signs that result from increased adrenergic stimulation include tachycardia and 
230 
anxiety and may be more pronounced in younger patients and those with larger goiters 
231 
(28). The signs and symptoms of mild, or subclinical, thyrotoxicosis are similar to those 
232 
of overt thyrotoxicosis, but differ in magnitude.   Measurable changes in basal metabolic 
233 
rate, cardiovascular hemodynamics, and psychiatric and neuropsychological function can 
234 
be present in mild thyrotoxicosis (29).  
235 
 
236 
 [B] How should clinically or incidentally discovered thyrotoxicosis be evaluated and 
237 
initially managed? 
238 
[B1] Assessment of disease severity 
239 
 
Assessment of thyrotoxic manifestations, and especially potential cardiovascular 
240 
and neuromuscular complications, is essential in formulating an appropriate treatment 
241 
plan. While it might be anticipated that the severity of thyrotoxic symptoms is 
242 
proportional to the elevation in the serum levels of free T4 and T3, in one small study of 
243 
25 patients with GD, the Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale did not strongly correlate with 
244 
free T4 or T3 and was inversely correlated with age (28). The importance of age as a 
245 
determinant of the prevalence and severity of hyperthyroid symptoms has been recently 
246 
confirmed (30). Cardiac evaluation may be necessary, especially in the older patient, and 
247 
may require an echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, Holter monitor, or myocardial 
248 
perfusion studies (31). This should not postpone therapy of the thyrotoxicosis. In addition 
249 
to the administration of beta-blockers (31), treatment may be needed for concomitant 
250 
myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, or atrial arrhythmias (25).  Anticoagulation 
251 
may be necessary in patients in atrial fibrillation (32). Goiter size, obstructive symptoms, 
252 
and the severity of Graves’ orbitopathy (GO), the inflammatory disease that develops in 
253 
the orbit in association with autoimmune thyroid disorders, can be discordant with the 
254 
degree of hyperthyroidism or hyperthyroid symptoms. 
255 
 
All patients with known or suspected hyperthyroidism should undergo a 
256 
comprehensive history and physical examination, including measurement of pulse rate, 
257 
blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body weight. In addition, one should assess thyroid 
258 
 size, tenderness, symmetry, and nodularity; pulmonary, cardiac, and neuromuscular 
259 
function (29,31,33); and presence or absence of peripheral edema, eye signs, or pretibial 
260 
myxedema. 
261 
[B2] Biochemical evaluation 
262 
 
Serum TSH measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single 
263 
blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an 
264 
initial screening test (34). However, when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic 
265 
accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial 
266 
evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH, when the pituitary-thyroid axis is 
267 
intact, is an inverse log-linear relationship; therefore, small changes in free T4 result in 
268 
large changes in serum TSH concentrations. Serum TSH levels are considerably more 
269 
sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing thyroid hormone 
270 
excess (35).  
271 
 
In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4 and/or T3 are elevated, and serum TSH is 
272 
subnormal  (usually <0.01 mU/L in a third generation assay). In mild hyperthyroidism, 
273 
serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will 
274 
be low or undetectable.  These laboratory findings have been called ‘‘T3-toxicosis’’ and 
275 
may represent the earliest stages of hyperthyroidism caused by Graves’ disease or an 
276 
autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. As with T4, total T3 measurements are 
277 
impacted by protein binding. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and 
278 
less robust than those for free T4. Therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently 
279 
preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a 
280 
 normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH 
281 
concentration. Laboratory protocols that store sera and automatically retrieve the sample 
282 
and add on free T4 and total T3 measurements when the initial screening serum TSH 
283 
concentrations are low, avoid the need for subsequent blood draws. 
284 
 
In the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone 
285 
resistance, or spurious assay results due to interfering antibodies, a normal serum 
286 
TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.  The term ‘‘euthyroid 
287 
hyperthyroxinemia’’ has been used to describe a number of entities, primarily thyroid 
288 
hormone-binding protein disorders, which cause elevated total serum T4 concentrations 
289 
(and frequently elevated total serum T3 concentrations) in the absence of hyperthyroidism 
290 
(36). These conditions include elevations in T4 binding globulin (TBG) or transthyretin 
291 
(TTR) (37); the presence of an abnormal albumin which binds T4 with high capacity 
292 
(familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia); a similarly abnormal TTR; and, rarely, 
293 
immunoglobulins which directly bind T4 or T3. TBG excess may occur as a hereditary X-
294 
linked trait, or be acquired as a result of pregnancy or estrogen administration, hepatitis, 
295 
acute intermittent porphyuria, or during treatment with 5-flourouracil, perphenazine, or 
296 
some narcotics. Other causes of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia include those drugs that 
297 
inhibit T4 to T3 conversion, such as amiodarone (23) or high-dose propranolol (31), acute 
298 
psychosis (38), extreme high altitude (39), and amphetamine abuse (40). Estimates of 
299 
free thyroid hormone concentrations frequently also give erroneous results in these 
300 
disorders. Spurious free T4 elevations may occur from heterophilic antibodies or in the 
301 
setting of heparin therapy, due to in vitro activation of lipoprotein lipase and release of 
302 
free fatty acids that displace T4 from its binding proteins.  
303 
  
Heterophilic antibodies can also cause spurious high TSH values, and this should 
304 
be ruled out by repeating the TSH in another assay, measurement of TSH in serial 
305 
dilution, or direct measurement of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). 
306 
 
Ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spurious results in assays that utilize a 
307 
steptavidin-biotin separation technique (41,42).  In immunometric assays, frequently used 
308 
to measure TSH, excess biotin displaces biotinylated antibodies and causes spuriously 
309 
low results, while in competitive binding assays, frequently used to measure free T4, 
310 
excess biotin competes with biotinylated analogue and results in falsely high results.  
311 
Patients taking high doses of biotin or supplements containing biotin, who have elevated 
312 
T4 and suppressed TSH should stop taking biotin and have repeat measurements  at least 
313 
2 days later. 
314 
 
After excluding euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, TSH-mediated hyperthyroidism 
315 
should be considered when thyroid hormone concentrations are elevated and TSH is 
316 
normal or elevated. A pituitary lesion on MRI and a disproportionately high ratio of the 
317 
serum level of the alpha-subunit of the pituitary glycoprotein hormones to TSH supports 
318 
the diagnosis of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma (43). A family history and genetic 
319 
testing for mutations in the T3-receptor supports the diagnosis of thyroid hormone 
320 
resistance (44).  
321 
[B3] Determination of etiology 
322 
■ RECOMMENDATION 1 
323 
 The etiology of thyrotoxicosis should be determined. If the diagnosis is not apparent 
324 
based on the clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation, diagnostic testing 
325 
is indicated and can include, depending on available expertise and resources, (1) 
326 
measurement of TRAb, (2) determination of the radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU), or 
327 
(3) measurement of thyroidal blood flow on ultrasonography. An iodine-123 or 
328 
technetium-99m pertechnetate scan should be obtained when the clinical presentation 
329 
suggests a toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter. Strong recommendation, 
330 
moderate-quality evidence. 
331 
 
In a patient with a symmetrically enlarged thyroid, recent onset of orbitopathy, 
332 
and moderate to severe hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis of GD is likely and further 
333 
evaluation of hyperthyroidism causation is unnecessary. In a thyrotoxic patient with a 
334 
non-nodular thyroid and no definite orbitopathy, measurement of TRAb or a radioactive 
335 
iodine uptake can be used to distinguish GD from other etiologies.  In a study using a 
336 
model of a theoretical population of 100,000 enrollees in a managed care organization in 
337 
the United States, the use of TRAb measurements to diagnose GD compared to RAIU 
338 
measurements  reduced costs by 47% and resulted in a 46% quicker diagnosis (45). 
339 
 
A radioactive iodine uptake measures the percentage of administered radioiodine 
340 
(RAI) that is concentrated into thyroid tissue after a fixed interval, usually 24 hours. 
341 
Technetium uptake measurements utilize pertechnetate that is trapped by the thyroid, but 
342 
not organified. A technetium (TcO4) uptake measures the percentage of administered 
343 
technetium that is trapped by the thyroid after a fixed interval, usually 20 minutes.   
344 
  
Uptake measurements are indicated when the diagnosis is in question (except 
345 
during pregnancy and usually during lactation (see section [T4]) and distinguishes causes 
346 
of thyrotoxicosis having elevated or normal uptake over the thyroid gland from those 
347 
with near-absent uptake (Table 3).  Uptake is usually elevated in patients with GD and 
348 
normal or high in toxic nodular goiter, unless there has been a recent exposure to iodine 
349 
(e.g., radiocontrast). The RAIU will be near zero in patients with painless, postpartum, or 
350 
subacute thyroiditis, factitious ingestion of thyroid hormone or recent excess iodine 
351 
intake. The RAIU may be low after exposure to iodinated contrast in the preceding 1–2 
352 
months or with ingestion of a diet unusually rich in iodine such as seaweed soup or kelp. 
353 
However, RAIU is rarely <1% unless the iodine exposure is reoccurring as during 
354 
treatment with amiodarone. When exposure to excess iodine is suspected (e.g., when the 
355 
RAIU is lower than expected from the clinical history), assessment of urinary iodine 
356 
concentration (spot urine iodine adjusted for urine creatinine concentration or a 24-
357 
hour urine iodine concentration) may be helpful.  The uptake over the neck will also be 
358 
absent in a patient with struma ovarii, where the abnormal thyroid tissue is located in an 
359 
ovarian teratoma. 
360 
 
Thyroid scans provide a planar image of the thyroid gland using a gamma camera, 
361 
to assess potential variability in the concentration of the radioisotope within thyroid 
362 
tissue.  RAI scans may be obtained coincident with the RAIU and technetium scans may 
363 
be obtained coincident with the technetium uptake. While technetium scans result in a 
364 
low range of normal uptake and high background activity, total body radiation exposure 
365 
is less than for 123I scans; either type of scan can be useful in determining the etiology of 
366 
hyperthyroidism in the presence of thyroid nodularity. 
367 
  
A thyroid scan should be obtained if the clinical presentation suggests a toxic 
368 
adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter. The pattern of RAIU in GD is diffuse unless there 
369 
are coexistent nodules or fibrosis. The pattern of uptake in a patient with a single TA 
370 
generally shows focal uptake in the adenoma with suppressed uptake in the surrounding 
371 
and contralateral thyroid tissue. The image in TMNG demonstrates multiple areas of 
372 
focal increased and suppressed uptake.  If autonomy is extensive, the image may be 
373 
difficult to distinguish from that of GD (46). Additionally, GD and non-toxic nodular 
374 
goiter may coincide resulting in positive TRAb levels and a nodular ultrasound or 
375 
heterogeneous uptake images (47).  
376 
 
Where expertise is available, ultrasonography with color Doppler flow can 
377 
distinguish thyroid hyperactivity (increased flow) from destructive thyroiditis (48).  
378 
Quantitative Doppler evaluation requires careful adjustments to prevent artifacts and 
379 
measures the peak systolic velocity from intrathyroidal arteries or the inferior thyroidal 
380 
artery (49). This test may be particularly useful when radioactive iodine is 
381 
contraindicated, such as during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Doppler flow has also been 
382 
used to distinguish between subtypes of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (see Section 
383 
[V2]), and between GD and destructive thyroiditis (see Section [W2]). 
384 
 
The ratio of total T3 to total T4 can also be useful in assessing the etiology of  
385 
 
386 
thyrotoxicosis when scintigraphy is contraindicated. Because a hyperactive gland  
387 
 
388 
produces more T3 than T4, T3 will be elevated above the upper limit of normal more than 
389 
 
390 
 T4 in thyrotoxicosis caused by hyperthyroidism, whereas T4 is elevated more than T3 in  
391 
 
392 
thyrotoxicosis caused by thyroiditis (50); in one study the ratio of total T3/total T4  
393 
 
394 
 (ng/mcg) was >20 in GD and toxic nodular goiter, and <20 in painless or postpartum  
395 
 
396 
thyroiditis (51). A high T4 to T3 ratio may be seen in thyrotoxicosis factitia (from 
397 
  
398 
exogenous levothyroxine). 
399 
 
The choice of initial diagnostic testing depends on cost, availability, and local 
400 
expertise. TRAb is cost-effective because if it is positive it confirms the diagnosis of the 
401 
most common cause of thyrotoxicosis, but if negative it does not distinguish among other 
402 
etiologies, and it can be negative in very mild GD.  If third generation TRAb assays are 
403 
not readily available, RAIU is preferred for initial testing.   
404 
 
Diagnostic testing may be influenced by the choice of therapy (see Section [C]).  
405 
For example, measuring TRAb in a patient with GD who plans on taking methimazole 
406 
(MMI) with the hope of achieving a remission will provide a baseline measurement for 
407 
disease activity. Obtaining a RAIU in a patient who prefers radioactive iodine treatment 
408 
will provide both diagnostic information and facilitate the calculation of the radioactive 
409 
iodine dose (see Section [D2]). 
410 
 
In most patients, distinction between subacute and painless thyroiditis is not 
411 
difficult. Subacute thyroiditis is generally painful, the gland is firm to hard on palpation, 
412 
and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually >50 and sometimes over 100 
413 
mm/h. Patients with painless thyroiditis presenting within the first year after 
414 
childbirth (postpartum thyroiditis), often have a personal or family history of 
415 
autoimmune thyroid disease, and typically have measurable serum concentrations of 
416 
antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (52). 
417 
  
Thyroglobulin is released along with thyroid hormone in subacute, painless, and 
418 
palpation thyroiditis (following manipulation of the thyroid gland during surgery), 
419 
whereas its release is suppressed in the setting of exogenous thyroid hormone 
420 
administration. If not elucidated by the history, factitious ingestion of thyroid hormone 
421 
can be distinguished from other causes of thyrotoxicosis by a low serum thyroglobulin 
422 
level,  a near-zero RAIU, and a T3 to T4 ratio (ng/mcg) <20 if due to exogenous 
423 
levothyroxine. (53). In patients with antithyroglobulin antibodies, which interfere with 
424 
thyroglobulin measurement, an alternative but not widely available approach is 
425 
measurement of fecal T4 (54); mean values were 1.03 nmol/g in euthyroid patients, 
426 
1.93 nmol/g in Graves’ hyperthyroidism, and 12-24 nmol/g in factitious 
427 
throtoxicosis.  
428 
 
Technical remarks: There are two methods for measuring TRAb (55).  Third-
429 
generation TBI assays are competition-based assays which measure inhibition of binding 
430 
of a labeled monoclonal anti-human TSHR antibody (or labeled TSH) to recombinant 
431 
TSHR.  Such assays detect blocking as well as neutral and stimulating immunoglobulins. 
432 
The newer TSI assays detect increased cAMP production, e.g. from Chinese hamster 
433 
ovary cells transfected with hTSHR, and are positive in 96% of patients with GD (56). 
434 
Older TSI assays were more specific but less sensitive than TBI assays.  In the setting of 
435 
thyrotoxicosis, third generation TBI assays have a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 
436 
99% (57)   
437 
 [B4] Symptomatic management 
438 
■ RECOMMENDATION 2 
439 
 Beta-adrenergic blockade is recommended in all patients with symptomatic 
440 
thyrotoxicosis, especially elderly patients and thyrotoxic patients with resting heart 
441 
rates in excess of 90 bpm or coexistent cardiovascular disease. Strong 
442 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
443 
 
In a randomized controlled trial of MMI alone versus MMI and a beta-adrenergic 
444 
blocking agent, after 4 weeks, patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers had lower heart 
445 
rates, less shortness of breath and fatigue and had improved “physical functioning” on the 
446 
SF-36 health questionnaire (58). 
447 
 
Technical remarks: Since there is not sufficient β-1 selectivity of the available 
448 
beta-blockers at the recommended doses, these drugs are generally contraindicated in 
449 
patients with bronchospastic asthma. In patients with quiescent bronchospastic asthma in 
450 
whom heart rate control is essential, or in patients with mild obstructive airway disease or 
451 
symptomatic Raynaud’s phenomenon, a relative β-1 selective agent can be used 
452 
cautiously, with careful monitoring of pulmonary status (Table 4). Occasionally, very 
453 
high doses of beta-blockers are required to manage symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and to 
454 
reduce the heart rate to near the upper limit of normal (31), but most often low to 
455 
moderate doses (Table 4) give sufficient symptom relief. Oral administration of calcium 
456 
channel blockers, both verapamil and diltiazem, have been shown to effect rate control in 
457 
patients who do not tolerate or are not candidates for β-adrenergic blocking agents. 
458 
 
459 
[C] How should overt hyperthyroidism due to GD be managed? 
460 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 3 
461 
Patients with overt Graves’ hyperthyroidism should be treated with any of the 
462 
following modalities: Radioactive iodine therapy, antithyroid drugs, or thyroidectomy. 
463 
Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
464 
 
Once it has been established that the patient is hyperthyroid and the cause is GD, 
465 
the patient and physician must choose between three effective and relatively safe initial 
466 
treatment options: RAI therapy, ATDs, or thyroidectomy (59). In the United States, RAI 
467 
has been the therapy most preferred by physicians but a trend has been present in recent 
468 
years to increase use of ATDs and reduce the use  of RAI. A 2011 survey of clinical 
469 
endocrinologists showed that 59.7% of respondents from the United States selected RAI 
470 
as primary therapy for an uncomplicated case of GD, compared to 69% in a similar 
471 
survey performed 20 years earlier (60).  In Europe, Latin America, and Japan, there has 
472 
been a greater physician preference for ATDs (61). The long-term quality of life (QoL) 
473 
following treatment for GD was found to be the same in patients randomly allocated to 
474 
one of the three treatment options (62). Currently, there is no scientific evidence to 
475 
support the recommendation of alternative therapies for the treatment of hyperthyroidism 
476 
(63).   
477 
 
Technical remarks: Once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and 
478 
patient should discuss each of the treatment options, including the logistics, benefits, 
479 
expected speed of recovery, drawbacks, potential side effects, and costs (64). This sets 
480 
the stage for the physician to make recommendations based on best clinical judgment and 
481 
allows the final decision to incorporate the personal values and preferences of the patient.  
482 
 The treatment selection should also take into account the local availability and the 
483 
associated costs. Whenever surgery is selected as treatment one should consider the use 
484 
of expert high-volume thyroid surgeons with on average lower risk of complications; lack 
485 
of that expertise should be considered against the known risk of alternative choices.  
486 
Long term continuous treatment of hyperthyroidism with ATDs may be considered in 
487 
selected cases (65,66). 
488 
Clinical situations that favor a particular modality as treatment for Graves’ 
489 
hyperthyroidism (Table 5): 
490 
a. RAI therapy: Women planning a pregnancy in the future (in more than 6 months 
491 
following RAI administration, provided thyroid hormone levels are normal), 
492 
individuals with comorbidities increasing surgical risk, and patients with 
493 
previously operated or externally irradiated necks, or lack of access to a high-
494 
volume thyroid surgeon, and patients with contraindications to ATD use or 
495 
failure to achieve euthyroidism during treatment with ATDs.  Patients with 
496 
periodic thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis, right heart failure pulmonary 
497 
hypertension, or congestive heart failure should also be considered good 
498 
candidates for RAI therapy.  
499 
b. ATDs: Patients with high likelihood of remission (patients, especially women, with 
500 
mild disease, small goiters, and negative or low-titer TRAb); pregnancy; the 
501 
elderly or others with comorbidities increasing surgical risk or with limited life 
502 
expectancy;  individuals in nursing homes or other care facilities who may have 
503 
limited longevity and are unable to follow radiation safety regulations; patients 
504 
 with previously operated or irradiated necks; patients with lack of access to a 
505 
high-volume thyroid surgeon; patients with moderate to severe active GO; and 
506 
patients who need more rapid biochemical disease control. 
507 
c. Surgery: Women planning a pregnancy in <6 months provided thyroid hormone 
508 
levels are normal ( i.e., possibly before thyroid hormone levels would be normal 
509 
if RAI were chosen as therapy); symptomatic compression or large goiters ( ≥ 80 
510 
g); relatively low uptake of radioactive iodine; when thyroid malignancy is 
511 
documented or suspected (e.g., suspicious or indeterminate cytology); large 
512 
thyroid nodules especially if greater than 4 cm or if nonfunctioning, or 
513 
hypofunctioning on iodine-123 or technetium-99m pertechnetate scanning; 
514 
coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery; especially if TRAb levels are 
515 
particularly high; and patients with moderate to severe active GO.   
516 
Contraindications to a particular modality as treatment for Graves’ 
517 
hyperthyroidism: 
518 
a. RAI therapy: Definite contraindications include pregnancy, lactation, coexisting 
519 
thyroid cancer, or suspicion of thyroid cancer, individuals unable to comply with 
520 
radiation safety guidelines and used with informed caution in women planning a 
521 
pregnancy within 4–6 months. 
522 
b. ATDs: Definite contraindications to ATD therapy include previous known major 
523 
adverse reactions to ATDs. 
524 
 c. Surgery: Factors that may mitigate against the choice of surgery include substantial 
525 
comorbidity such as cardiopulmonary disease, end-stage cancer, or other 
526 
debilitating disorders, or lack of access to a high volume thyroid surgeon. 
527 
Pregnancy is a relative contraindication and surgery should only be used in the 
528 
circumstance when rapid control of hyperthyroidism is required and antithyroid 
529 
medications cannot be used. Thyroidectomy is best avoided in the first and third 
530 
trimesters of pregnancy because of teratogenic effects associated with anesthetic 
531 
agents and increased risk of fetal loss in the first trimester and increased risk of 
532 
preterm labor in the third. Optimally, thyroidectomy is performed in the second 
533 
trimester. Although it is the safest time, it is not without risk (4.5%–5.5% risk of 
534 
preterm labor) (67,68). Thyroid surgery in pregnancy is also associated with a 
535 
higher rate of complications, including hypoparathyroidism and recurrent 
536 
laryngeal nerve injury (68). 
537 
Patient values that may impact choice of therapy: 
538 
a. RAI therapy: Patients choosing RAI therapy as treatment for GD would likely 
539 
place relatively higher value on definitive control of hyperthyroidism, the 
540 
avoidance of surgery, and the potential side effects of ATDs, as well as a 
541 
relatively lower value on the need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement, rapid 
542 
resolution of hyperthyroidism, and potential worsening or development of GO 
543 
(69). 
544 
b. ATDs: Patients choosing ATD as treatment for GD would place relatively higher 
545 
value on the possibility of remission and the avoidance of lifelong thyroid 
546 
 hormone treatment, the avoidance of surgery, and exposure to radioactivity and a 
547 
relatively lower value on the avoidance of ATD side effects (see section [E]), and 
548 
the possibility of disease recurrence. 
549 
c. Surgery: Patients choosing surgery as treatment for GD would likely place a 
550 
relatively higher value on prompt and definitive control of hyperthyroidism, 
551 
avoidance of exposure to radioactivity, and the potential side effects of ATDs and 
552 
a relatively lower value on potential surgical risks, and need for lifelong thyroid 
553 
hormone replacement.

■ RECOMMENDATION 4 
558 
Because RAI treatment of GD can cause a transient exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, 
559 
beta-adrenergic blockade should be considered even in asymptomatic patients who are 
560 
at increased risk for complications due to worsening of hyperthyroidism, i.e., elderly 
561 
patients and patients with co-morbidities. Weak recommendation, low-quality 
562 
evidence. 
563 
■ RECOMMENDATION 5 
564 
 In addition to beta-adrenergic blockade (see Recommendation 2 and 4), pretreatment 
565 
with MMI prior to RAI therapy for GD should be considered in patients who are at 
566 
increased risk for complications due to worsening of hyperthyroidism. MMI should be 
567 
discontinued 2-3 days prior to RAI.  Weak recommendation, moderate-quality 
568 
evidence.  
569 
■ RECOMMENDATION 6 
570 
In patients who are at increased risk for complications due to worsening of 
571 
hyperthyroidism, resuming MMI 3-7 days after RAI administration should be 
572 
considered. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
573 
■ RECOMMENDATION 7 
574 
Medical therapy of any comorbid conditions should be optimized prior to RAI 
575 
therapy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.  
576 
 
RAI has been used to treat hyperthyroidism for more than seven decades. It is 
577 
well tolerated and complications are rare, except for those related to orbitopathy (see 
578 
section [U]). Thyroid storm occurs only rarely following the administration of RAI (70-
579 
72). In one study of patients with thyrotoxic cardiac disease treated with RAI as the sole 
580 
modality, no clinical worsening in any of the cardinal symptoms of thyrotoxicosis was 
581 
seen (73). However, RAI can induce a short-term increase of thyroid hormone levels 
582 
(74,75). To prevent a clinical exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, the use of MMI or 
583 
carbimazole, the latter of which is not marketed in the United States, before and after 
584 
RAI treatment may be considered in patients with severe hyperthyroidism, the elderly, 
585 
 and those with substantial comorbidity that puts them at greater risk for complications of 
586 
worsening thyrotoxicosis (75,76). The latter includes patients with cardiovascular 
587 
complications such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension and 
588 
those with renal failure, infection, trauma, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and 
589 
cerebrovascular or pulmonary disease (70). These comorbid conditions should be 
590 
addressed with standard medical care and the patient rendered medically stable before the 
591 
administration of RAI if possible.  If possible iodinated radiocontrast should be 
592 
avoided.  In addition, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs should be used judiciously in these 
593 
patients in preparation for RAI therapy (25,77). MMI (75) and carbimazole (78) have 
594 
shown to reduce thyroid hormone levels after RAI treatment in randomized controlled 
595 
trials. However, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials also found that 
596 
MMI, carbimazole and propylthiouracil reduce the success rate if given in the week 
597 
before or after RAI treatment (71). Use of higher activities of RAI may offset the reduced 
598 
effectiveness of RAI therapy following antithyroid medication (75,76). 
599 
 
A special diet is not required before RAI therapy, but nutritional supplements that 
600 
may contain excess iodine and seaweeds should be avoided for at least 7 days. A low-
601 
iodine diet may be useful for those with relatively low RAIU to increase the proportion of 
602 
RAI trapped. 
603 
 
Technical remarks: Patients that might benefit from adjunctive MMI or 
604 
carbimazole may be those who are poorly tolerating hyperthyroid symptoms. Such 
605 
patients frequently have free T4 2–3 times the upper limit of normal. Young and middle 
606 
aged, otherwise healthy patients who are clinically well-compensated despite significant 
607 
 biochemical hyperthyroidism can generally receive RAI without pretreatment. If given as 
608 
pretreatment, MMI and carbimazole should be discontinued before the administration of 
609 
RAI. Discontinuation of ATDs for 2-3 days prevents a short-term increase of thyroid 
610 
hormone levels (79), which is found after 6 days (75,76). In elderly patients or in those 
611 
with underlying cardiovascular disease, resuming MMI or carbimazole 3-7 days after 
612 
RAI administration should be considered, and generally tapered as thyroid function 
613 
normalizes. In one study, if MMI was restarted 7 days after RAI, the free T4 measured 3 
614 
weeks after RAI was 6% lower than the values at the time of RAI administration, and if 
615 
MMI was not restarted after RAI, the free T4 values were 36% higher than the values at 
616 
the time of RAI administration (80). Over several decades, there have been reports that 
617 
pretreatment with lithium reduces the activity of RAI necessary for cure of Graves’ 
618 
hyperthyroidism and may prevent the thyroid hormone increase seen upon ATD 
619 
withdrawal (81-83). However, this is not used widely, and there is insufficient evidence 
620 
to recommend the practice. In selected patients with Graves’ hyperthyroidism who would 
621 
have been candidates for pretreatment with ATDs due to comorbidities or excessive 
622 
symptoms, but who are allergic to ATDs, the duration of hyperthyroidism may be 
623 
shortened by administering iodine (e.g. SSKI) beginning one week after RAI 
624 
administration (84).  
625 
[D2] Administration of RAI in the treatment of GD 
626 
■ RECOMMENDATION 8 
627 
 Sufficient activity of RAI should be administered in a single application, typically a 
628 
mean dose of 10–15 mCi (370-555 MBq), to render the patient with GD hypothyroid. 
629 
Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
630 
■ RECOMMENDATION 9 
631 
A pregnancy test should be obtained within 48 hours prior to treatment in any woman 
632 
with childbearing potential who is to be treated with RAI. The treating physician 
633 
should obtain this test and verify a negative result prior to administering RAI. Strong 
634 
recommendation, low-quality evidence  
635 
 
The goal of RAI therapy in GD is to control hyperthyroidism by rendering the 
636 
patient hypothyroid; this treatment is very effective, provided sufficient radiation dose is 
637 
deposited in the thyroid. This can be accomplished equally well by either administering a 
638 
fixed activity or by calculating the activity based on the size of the thyroid and its ability 
639 
to trap RAI (85). 
640 
 
The first method is simple, while the second method requires two unknowns to be 
641 
determined: the uptake of RAI and the size of the thyroid. The therapeutic RAI activity 
642 
can then be calculated using these two factors and the quantity of radiation (µCi or Bq) to 
643 
be deposited per gram (or cc) of thyroid (e.g., activity (µCi) = gland weight (g)×150-200 
644 
µCi/g×[1/24 hour uptake in % of administered activity]). The activity in µCi or Bq is 
645 
converted to mCi or MBq by dividing the result by 1000. The most frequently used 
646 
uptake is calculated at 24 hours, and the size of the thyroid is determined by palpation or 
647 
ultrasound. One study found that this estimate by experienced physicians is accurate 
648 
 compared with anatomic imaging (86); however, other investigators have not confirmed 
649 
this observation (87).  
650 
 
Alternately, a more detailed calculation can be made to deposit a specific 
651 
radiation dose (in rad or Gy) to the thyroid. Using this approach, it is also necessary to 
652 
know the effective half-life of RAI (88). This requires additional time and computation 
653 
and, because the outcome has not shown to be better, this method is seldom used in the 
654 
United States. Evidence shows that to achieve a hypothyroid state, >150 µCi/g (5.55 
655 
MBq/g) needs to be delivered (88-90). Patients who are on dialysis or who have 
656 
jejunostomy or gastric feeding tubes require special care and management when being 
657 
administered RAI treatment (91). 
658 
 
The success of RAI therapy in GD strongly depends on the administered 
659 
activities. In patients without adjunctive ATD, randomized controlled trials found 61% 
660 
success with 5.4 mCi (200 MBq) (92), 69% with 8.2 mCi (302 MBq) (93), 74% with 10 
661 
mCi (370 MBq) (94), 81% with 15 mCi (555 MBq) (94) and 86% with 15.7 mCi (580 
662 
MBq) (95) RAI. Due to the high rate of patients requiring retreatment, RAI therapy with 
663 
low activities is generally not recommended.  
664 
 
A long-term increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deaths has been 
665 
reported after RAI therapy not resulting in hypothyroidism as opposed to unchanged 
666 
mortality in RAI-treated patients on levothyroxine therapy, reflecting the role of 
667 
persistent hyperthyroidism as opposed to that of RAI therapy on mortality (96,97). A 
668 
recent meta-analysis found no increase in the overall cancer risk after RAI treatment for 
669 
hyperthyroidism; however, a trend towards increased risk of thyroid, stomach and kidney 
670 
 cancer was seen, requiring further research (98). In some men, there is a modest fall in 
671 
the testosterone to luteinizing hormone (LH) ratio after RAI therapy that is subclinical 
672 
and reversible (99). Conception should be delayed  in women until  stable euthyroidism 
673 
is established (on thyroid hormone replacement following successful thyroid ablation).  
674 
This typically takes 4-6 months or longer. Conception should be delayed 3–4 months 
675 
in men to allow for turnover of sperm production. However, once the patient (both 
676 
genders) is euthyroid, there is no evidence of reduced fertility and offspring of treated 
677 
patients show no congenital anomalies compared to the population at large (100). 
678 
 
Technical remarks: Rendering the patient hypothyroid can be accomplished 
679 
equally well by administering either a sufficient fixed activity or calculating an activity 
680 
based on the size of the thyroid and its ability to trap iodine. Fetuses exposed to RAI after 
681 
the 10th to 11th week of gestation may be born athyreotic (101,102) and are also at a 
682 
theoretical increased risk for reduced intelligence and/or cancer. In breast-feeding 
683 
women, RAI therapy should not be administered for at least 6 weeks after lactation stops 
684 
to ensure that RAI will no longer be actively concentrated in the breast tissues. A delay of 
685 
3 months will more reliably ensure that lactation-associated increase in breast sodium 
686 
iodide symporter activity has returned to normal (103). Breast feeding should not be 
687 
resumed after RAI therapy. 
688 
■ RECOMMENDATION 10 
689 
The physician administering RAI should provide written advice concerning radiation 
690 
safety precautions following treatment. If the precautions cannot be followed, 
691 
 alternative therapy should be selected. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
692 
evidence.  
693 
 
All national and regional radiation protection rules regarding RAI treatment 
694 
should be followed (104,105). In the United States, the treating physician must ensure 
695 
and document that no adult member of the public is exposed to 0.5 mSv (500 milli-
696 
roentgen equivalent in man [mrem]) when the patient is discharged with a retained 
697 
activity of 33 mCi (1.22 GBq) or greater, or emits ≥ 7 mrem/h (70 µSv/h) at 1 m. 
698 
 
Technical remarks: Continuity of follow-up should be provided and can be 
699 
facilitated by communication between the referring physician and the treating physician, 
700 
including a request for therapy from the former and a statement from the latter that the 
701 
treatment has been administered. 
702 
[D3] Patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD 
703 
■ RECOMMENDATION 11 
704 
Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an 
705 
assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH. Biochemical monitoring should be continued 
706 
at 4–6 week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is 
707 
stable on thyroid hormone replacement. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
708 
evidence.  
709 
 
Most patients respond to RAI therapy with a normalization of thyroid function 
710 
tests and improvement of clinical symptoms within 4–8 weeks. Hypothyroidism may 
711 
 occur from 4 weeks on, with 40% of patients being hypothyroid by 8 weeks and >80% by 
712 
16 weeks (106). This transition can occur rapidly but more commonly between 2 and 6 
713 
months, and the timing of thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be determined by 
714 
results of thyroid function tests, clinical symptoms, and physical examination. Transient 
715 
hypothyroidism following RAI therapy can rarely occur, with subsequent complete 
716 
recovery of thyroid function or recurrent hyperthyroidism (107). In such patients the 
717 
thyroid gland often remains palpable. 
718 
 
Beta-blockers that were instituted prior to RAI treatment should be tapered when 
719 
free T4 and total T3 have returned to the reference range. As free T4 and total T3 improve, 
720 
MMI can usually be tapered, which allows an assessment of the response to RAI. 
721 
 
Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism following RAI, which is 
722 
indicated by a free T4 below normal range. At this point, levothyroxine should be 
723 
instituted. TSH levels may not rise immediately with the development of hypothyroidism, 
724 
and should not be used initially to determine the need for levothyroxine. When thyroid 
725 
hormone replacement is initiated, the dose should be adjusted based on an assessment of 
726 
free T4. The required dose may be less than the typical full replacement, and careful 
727 
titration is necessary owing to nonsuppressible residual thyroid function. Overt 
728 
hypothyroidism should be avoided, especially in patients with active GO (see section 
729 
U2). Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is 
730 
recommended at least annually, or if the patietn experiences symptoms of 
731 
hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. 
732 
  
Technical remarks: Since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or 
733 
longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, the levels should be interpreted cautiously and 
734 
only in concert with free T4 and total T3. 
735 
[D4] Treatment of persistent Graves’ hyperthyroidism following RAI therapy 
736 
■ RECOMMENDATION 12 
737 
When hyperthyroidism due to GD persists after 6 months following RAI therapy, 
738 
retreatment with RAI is suggested. In selected patients with minimal response 3 
739 
months after therapy additional RAI may be considered. Weak recommendation, 
740 
low-quality evidence. 
741 
 
Technical remarks: Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the 
742 
size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms. The goal of 
743 
retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient 
744 
hypothyroid. Patients who have persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free 
745 
T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely for either 
746 
relapse or development of hypothyroidism. In the small percentage of patients with 
747 
hyperthyroidism refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered 
748 
(108). 
749 
 
750 
[E] If antithyroid drugs are chosen as initial management of GD, how should the 
751 
therapy be managed? 
752 
  
ATDs have been employed for seven decades (109). The goal of the therapy is to 
753 
render the patient euthyroid as quickly and safely as possible. These medications do not 
754 
cure Graves’ hyperthyroidism. However, when given in adequate doses, they are very 
755 
effective in controlling the hyperthyroidism; when they fail to achieve euthyroidism, the 
756 
usual cause is nonadherence (110). The treatment itself might have a beneficial 
757 
immunosuppressive role, either to primarily decrease thyroid specific autoimmunity, or 
758 
secondarily, by ameliorating the hyperthyroid state, which may restore the dysregulated 
759 
immune system back to normal (111).  In fact, the rate of remission with ATD therapy is 
760 
much higher (112) than the historical rates of spontaneous remission (113).   
761 
[E1] Initiation of antithyroid drug therapy for the treatment of GD 
762 
■ RECOMMENDATION 13 
763 
Methimazole should be used in virtually every patient who chooses ATD therapy for 
764 
GD, except during the first trimester of pregnancy when propylthiouracil (PTU) is 
765 
preferred, in the treatment of thyroid storm, and in patients with minor reactions to 
766 
MMI who refuse radioactive iodine therapy or surgery. Strong recommendation, 
767 
moderate-quality evidence. 
768 
■ RECOMMENDATION 14 
769 
Patients should be informed of side effects of ATDs and the necessity of informing the 
770 
physician promptly if they should develop pruritic rash, jaundice, acolic stools or dark 
771 
urine, arthralgias, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, fever, or pharyngitis. Preferably, 
772 
this should be in writing.  Before starting ATDs and at each subsequent visit, the 
773 
 patient should be alerted to stop the medication immediately and call their physician 
774 
when there are symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis or hepatic injury. Strong 
775 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
776 
■ RECOMMENDATION 15 
777 
Prior to initiating ATD therapy for GD, we suggest that patients have a baseline 
778 
complete blood count, including white count with differential, and a liver profile 
779 
including bilirubin and transaminases. Weak recomendation, low-quality evidence. 
780 
 
In the United States, MMI and PTU are available, and in some countries, 
781 
carbimazole, a precursor of MMI, is widely used. Carbimazole is rapidly converted to 
782 
MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is metabolized to approximately 6 mg of 
783 
MMI). They work in an identical fashion and both will be referred to as MMI in this text. 
784 
Both are effective as a single daily dose. At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of 10–
785 
30 mg daily are used to to restore euthyroidism, and then the dose can be titrated down to 
786 
a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily) (109,114). The dose of MMI should be 
787 
targeted to the degree of thyroid dysfunction, as too low a dose will not restore a 
788 
euthyroid state in patients with severe disease (115), and an excessive dose can cause 
789 
iatrogenic hypothyroidism in patients with mild disease (116).   In addition, adverse drug 
790 
reactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses.  Thus, it is important to use an MMI 
791 
dose that will achieve the clinical goal of normalization of thyroid function reasonably 
792 
rapidly, while minimizing adverse drug effects.   The task force suggests the following 
793 
as a rough guide to initial MMI daily dosing: 5-10 mg if free T4 is 1-1.5 times the upper 
794 
limit of normal (ULN); 10-20 mg for free T4 1.5-2 times the ULN; 30-40 mg for free T4 
795 
 2-3 times the ULN.  These rough guidelines should be tailored to the individual patient, 
796 
incorporating additional information on symptoms, gland size and total T3 levels where 
797 
relevant. Serum T3 levels are important to monitor initially, as some patients normalize 
798 
their free T4 levels with MMI but have persistently elevated serum T3, indicating 
799 
continuing thyrotoxicosis (117). 
800 
 
801 
 
MMI has the benefit of once-a-day administration and a reduced risk of major 
802 
side effects compared to PTU. PTU has a shorter duration of action and is usually 
803 
administered two or three times daily, starting with 50–150 mg three times daily, 
804 
depending on the severity of the hyperthyroidism. As the clinical findings and thyroid 
805 
function tests return to normal, reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or 
806 
three times daily is usually possible. When more rapid biochemical control is needed in 
807 
patients with severe thyrotoxicosis, an initial split dose of MMI (e.g., 15 or 20 mg twice a 
808 
day) may be more effective than a single daily dose, as the duration of action of MMI 
809 
may be less than 24 hours (118) .  Higher doses of antithyroid medication are sometimes 
810 
administered continuously and combined with L-thyroxine in doses to maintain euthyroid 
811 
levels (so-called block and replace therapy). However, this approach is not generally 
812 
recommended, as it has been shown to result in a higher rate of ATD side effects 
813 
(109,119). 
814 
 
The use of potassium iodine (KI) as a beneficial adjunct to ATD therapy for 
815 
Graves’ disease has been investigated in previous studies (120).  Indeed, a recent RCT 
816 
described the administration of 38 mg of potassium iodide (KI) together with 15 mg of 
817 
 MMI daily, which resulted in better control of hyperthyroidism and fewer adverse 
818 
reactions compared to 30 mg of MMI given alone (121). 
819 
[E2] Adverse effects of Antithyroid Drugs 
820 
 
In general, adverse effects of ATDs can be divided into common, minor allergic 
821 
side effects and rare but serious allergic/toxic events such as agranulocytosis, vasculitis, 
822 
or hepatic damage.  In a recent systematic review of eight studies that included 667 GD 
823 
patients receiving MMI or PTU, 13% of patients experienced adverse events (122).  The 
824 
minor allergic reactions included pruritus or a limited, minor rash, in 6% of patients 
825 
taking MMI and 3% of patients taking PTU (122).   Hepatocellular injury occurred in 
826 
2.7% of patients taking PTU and 0.4% of patients taking MMI.  In a separate study of 
827 
449 GD patients receiving MMI or PTU, 24% developed a cutaneous reaction, 3.8% 
828 
developed transaminase elevations more than 3-fold above normal, and 0.7% developed 
829 
agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500) (123).  Cutaneous reactions 
830 
were more common with PTU or higher dose MMI (30 mg/day), compared to lower dose 
831 
MMI (15 mg per day).  Hepatotoxicity was more common with PTU.  Cutaneous 
832 
reactions appeared after a median of 18-22 days of treatment, significantly earlier than 
833 
transaminase elevations (median 28 days).  The percentage of patients discontinuing 
834 
ATD therapy was 17% in the low dose MMI group, 29% in the high dose MMI group, 
835 
and 34% in the PTU group (123). 
836 
[E3] Agranulocytosis 
837 
  
Although ATD associated agranulocytosis is uncommon, it is life-threatening.  
838 
PTU at any dose appears to be more likely to cause agranulocytosis, compared to low 
839 
doses of MMI (124-126). Three recent reports of large numbers of ATD-treated patients 
840 
who developed hematologic complications provide information on risk factors, treatment, 
841 
and outcomes (127-129).  Two studies were from Japan and one was from Denmark. In 
842 
both countries the majority of patients are treated with MMI, so data are more limited for 
843 
PTU-associated agranulocytosis.  In the first study, a retrospective cohort analysis of over 
844 
50,000 GD patients, 55 developed agranulocytosis, of whom 5 had pancytopenia, for an 
845 
estimated cumulative incidence of 0.3% in 100 days (127), with a median interval to 
846 
onset of 69 days.  All 50 patients with agranulocytosis alone were successfully treated 
847 
with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), steroids, or supportive care, but one 
848 
of five patients with pancytopenia died.  No predictive risk factors for the development of 
849 
agranulocytosis could be identified.  The second study was based on a national database 
850 
for adverse drug reactions, which may have included some patients reported in the first 
851 
study (128).  Seven-hundred-fifty-four GD patients who developed ATD-induced 
852 
hematologic complications were reported, for an estimated incidence of 0.1 – 0.15%.  Of 
853 
them, 725 patients received MMI, 28 received PTU, and one received both drugs.  
854 
Eighty-nine percent developed agranulocytosis and 11% developed pancytopenia or 
855 
aplastic anemia.  At the onset of agranulocytosis, the average MMI dose was 25 mg/day 
856 
and the average PTU dose was 217 mg/day.  The average age of patients developing 
857 
agranulocytosis was slightly older (45 vs 40 years), an observation that has been made by 
858 
others.  Seventy-two percent developed agranulocytosis within 60 days of starting ATD, 
859 
and 85% within 90 days.  In 7% of patients, agranulocytosis occured later than 4 months 
860 
 after starting ATD, but some of these patients had discontinued the medication for long 
861 
periods of time and developed agranulocytosis after a second or subsequent exposure.  
862 
Thirty of the events (4%) were fatal. In the third study from Denmark, the frequency of 
863 
agranulocytosis was 0.27% with PTU and 0.11% with MMI (129).  As in prior studies, 
864 
the median duration of therapy prior to the development of agranulocytosis was 36 and 
865 
38 days for MMI and PTU, respectively. 
866 
[E4] Hepatotoxicity 
867 
 
Hepatotoxicity is another major adverse effect of ATD therapy. MMI 
868 
hepatotoxicity has been described as typically cholestatic, but hepatocellular disease may 
869 
be seen (130,131). In contrast, PTU can cause fulminant hepatic necrosis that may be 
870 
fatal; liver transplantation has been necessary in some patients taking PTU (132). It is for 
871 
this reason that in 2010 the FDA issued a safety alert regarding the use of PTU, and an 
872 
analysis of FDA Medwatch data (133) concluded that children are more susceptible to 
873 
hepatotoxic reactions from PTU than are adults.   
874 
 
A recent pharmacoepidemiologic study from Taiwan challenges the concept that 
875 
MMI hepatotoxicity is usually cholestatic, while PTU hepatotoxicity is most often 
876 
hepatocellular (134).  Among  71,379 new users of ATDs with a median follow-up of 
877 
196 days, MMI was associated with a higher rate of a diagnosis of non-infectious 
878 
hepatitis than PTU (0.25% versus 0.08%, respectively), whereas cholestasis was not 
879 
different (0.019% versus 0.016%).  A diagnosis of liver failure was more common 
880 
after PTU (0.048% versus 0.026% in MMI treated patients). Similar findings were 
881 
also recently reported from China (135).  These surprising results from Asia, which are in 
882 
 contrast to other data from the U.S. (133,136), suggest that prior data on MMI-related 
883 
hepatotoxicity from small case series may need to be reconsidered.  In the study from 
884 
Denmark (129), hepatotoxic reactions were not classified as cholestatic or hepatocellular, 
885 
but the frequency of “liver failure” was similar for MMI (0.03%) and PTU (0.03%). 
886 
 
887 
[E5] Vasculitis 
888 
 
Aside from hematologic and hepatic adverse effects, there are other rare side 
889 
effects with ATDs.   PTU, and rarely MMI can cause causes antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
890 
antibody (pANCA)-positive small vessel vasculitis (137,138) as well as drug induced 
891 
lupus (139).  The risk appears to increase with duration of therapy as opposed to other 
892 
adverse effects seen with ATDs that typically occur early in the course of treatment 
893 
(140,141).  Typically, granulocyte myeloperoxidase is the targeted antigen of the ANCA, 
894 
but antibodies to many other proteins are seen as well (142).  ANCA positive vasculitis is 
895 
more common in patients of Asian ethnicity, and the majority of reports come from that 
896 
part of the world (143).  While up to 40% of patients taking PTU develop ANCA 
897 
positivity, the vast majority of such individuals do not develop clinical vascutitis (144).  
898 
When the drug is discontinued, the ANCA slowly disappear in most individuals (144).  
899 
Children seem to be more likely to develop PTU-related ANCA positive vasculitis (133).  
900 
In most cases, the vasculitis resolves with drug discontinuation, although 
901 
immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary (145).  
902 
  
Rare cases of insulin autoimmune syndrome with symptomatic hypoglycemia 
903 
have been reported in patients treated with MMI (146,147).   
904 
 
Technical remarks: Baseline blood tests to aid in the interpretation of future 
905 
laboratory values should be considered before initiating ATD therapy. This is suggested 
906 
in part because low white cell counts are common in patients with GD and in African 
907 
Americans (10% of whom have a neutrophil count under 2000 (148)), and abnormal liver 
908 
enzymes are frequently seen in patients with thyrotoxicosis (149). While there is no 
909 
evidence that neutropenia or liver disease increases the risk of complications from 
910 
ATDs, the opinion of the task force is that a baseline absolute neutrophil count 
911 
<1000/mm3 or liver transaminase enzyme levels elevated more than fivefold above the 
912 
upper limit of normal should prompt serious reconsideration of initiating ATD therapy. It 
913 
is advisable to provide information concerning side effects of ATDs to the patient both 
914 
verbally and in writing to assure their comprehension, and document that this has been 
915 
done. This information can be found online (150,151). 
916 
[E6] Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs 
917 
 
There is a need for periodic clinical and biochemical evaluation of thyroid status 
918 
in patients taking ATDs, and it is essential that the patient understand its importance. An 
919 
assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2 to 6 weeks after 
920 
initiation of therapy, depending on the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, and the dose of 
921 
medication adjusted accordingly. Serum T3 should be monitored because the serum free 
922 
T4 levels may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3. Serum TSH may 
923 
 remain suppressed for several months after starting therapy and is therefore not a good 
924 
parameter for monitoring therapy early in the course. 
925 
 
Once the patient is euthyroid, the dose of MMI can usually be decreased by 30-
926 
50%, and biochemical testing repeated in 4-6 weeks.  Once euthyroid levels are achieved 
927 
with the minimal dose of medication, clinical and laboratory evaluation can be 
928 
undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months. If a patient is receiving long-term MMI (> 18 
929 
months), this interval can be increased to 6 months (see below).  
930 
■ RECOMMENDATION 16 
931 
A differential white blood cell count should be obtained during febrile illness and at 
932 
the onset of pharyngitis in all patients taking antithyroid medication. Strong 
933 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
934 
■ RECOMMENDATION 17 
935 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine monitoring of white 
936 
blood cell counts in patients taking ATD’s.  No recommendation, insufficient 
937 
evidence to assess benefits and risks.  
938 
 
There is no consensus concerning the utility of periodic monitoring of white blood 
939 
cell counts and liver function tests in predicting early onset of adverse reaction to the 
940 
medication (152). While routine monitoring of white blood cell counts may detect early 
941 
agranulocytosis, this practice is not likely to identify cases, as the frequency is quite low 
942 
(0.2%–0.5%) and the condition is usually sudden in onset. In a recent analysis of 211 
943 
 patients with ATD-induced agranulocytosis who had at least one prior granulocyte count 
944 
measured, 21% had a normal white blood count within a week, and 53% within two 
945 
weeks, before developing agranulocytosis (128).  However, other patients did display a 
946 
gradual decline in white blood cell count prior to developing agranulocytosis, suggesting 
947 
that monitoring might have been useful in some affected patients (152). Because patients 
948 
are typically symptomatic, measuring white blood cell counts during febrile illnesses and 
949 
at the onset of pharyngitis has been the standard approach to monitoring. If monitoring is 
950 
employed, the maximum benefit would be for the first 90 days of therapy, when the vast 
951 
majority of agranulocytosis occurs. In a patient developing agranulocytosis or other 
952 
serious side effects while taking either MMI or PTU, use of the other medication is 
953 
contraindicated owing to risk of cross-reactivity between the two medications (153).  The 
954 
contraindication to use PTU might be reconsidered in life-threatening thyrotoxicosis (i.e., 
955 
thyroid storm) in a MMI-treated patient who has developed agranulocytosis, especially if 
956 
the duration of therapy is brief (154). 
957 
■ RECOMMENDATION 18 
958 
Liver function and hepatocellular integrity should be assessed in patients taking MMI

or PTU who experience pruritic rash, jaundice, light-colored stool or dark urine, joint 
960 
pain, abdominal pain or bloating, anorexia, nausea, or fatigue. Strong 
961 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
962 
 
Hyperthyroidism can itself cause mildly abnormal liver function tests in up to 
963 
30% of patients (149).  PTU itself may cause transient elevations of serum transaminases 
964 
in up to one-third of patients. Significant elevations to threefold above the upper limit of 
965 
 normal are seen in up to 4% of patients taking PTU (155), a prevalence higher than with 
966 
MMI. As noted above, PTU can also cause fatal hepatic necrosis, leading to the 
967 
suggestion by some that patients taking this ATD have routine monitoring of their liver 
968 
function, especially during the first 6 months of therapy. A 2009 review of the literature 
969 
(136) found that PTU hepatotoxicity occurred after a median of 120 days after initiation 
970 
of therapy. It is difficult to distinguish these abnormalities from the effect of persistent 
971 
thyrotoxicosis unless they are followed prospectively. In patients with improving 
972 
thyrotoxicosis, a rising alkaline phosphatase with normalization of other liver function 
973 
does not indicate worsening hepatic toxicity (156), as the origin of the alkaline 
974 
phosphatase is from bone, not liver. The onset of PTU-induced hepatotoxicity may be 
975 
acute, difficult to appreciate clinically, and rapidly progressive. If not recognized, it can 
976 
lead to liver failure and death (115,157-159). Routine monitoring of liver function in all 
977 
patients taking ATDs has not been found to prevent severe hepatotoxicity. If monitoring 
978 
is employed, the maximum benefit would be for the first 120 days of therapy, when the 
979 
vast  majority of instances of hepatotoxicity occur. 
980 
 
Technical remarks: PTU should be discontinued if transaminase levels (found 
981 
incidentally or measured as clinically indicated) reach >3 times the upper limit of normal 
982 
or if levels elevated at the onset of therapy increase further.  After discontinuing the 
983 
drug, liver function tests should be monitored weekly until there is evidence of 
984 
resolution. If resolution is not evident, prompt referral to a gastroenterologist or 
985 
hepatologist for specialty care is warranted. Except in cases of severe PTU-induced 
986 
hepatotoxicity, MMI can be used to control the thyrotoxicosis without ill effect 
987 
(160,161). 
988 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 19 
989 
There is insufficient information to recommend for or against routine monitoring of 
990 
liver function tests in patients taking ATD’s.  No recommendation, insufficient 
991 
evidence to assess benefits and risks.

[E7] Management of allergic reactions 
993 
■ RECOMMENDATION 20 
994 
Minor cutaneous reactions may be managed with concurrent antihistamine therapy 
995 
without stopping the ATD. Persistent symptomatic minor side effects of antithyroid 
996 
medication should be managed by cessation of the medication and changing to RAI or 
997 
surgery, or switching to the other ATD when RAI or surgery are not options. In the 
998 
case of a serious allergic reaction, prescribing the alternative drug is not 
999 
recommended. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1000 
 
1001 
 
A recent study provided evidence that switching from one ATD to the other is 
1002 
safe in the case of minor side effects, although patients may develop similar side effects 
1003 
with the second ATD (123).  In this study, 71 patients with an adverse event from either 
1004 
MMI or PTU switched to the other ATD, with doses individually determined.  Median 
1005 
dose of the second ATD was 15 mg/d for MMI (range 10 – 30) and 300 mg/day for PTU 
1006 
(range 150 – 450). Thirty-four percent of patients switched to PTU and 30% of patients 
1007 
switched to MMI developed side effects, generally the same type as occurred on the 
1008 
 original ATD, while the remaining patients tolerated the second ATD without 
1009 
complications (123).  There is also one recent case report of a more severe reaction to 
1010 
MMI consisting of rash, pruritis, tongue and throat swelling that was successfully 
1011 
managed with antihistamine therapy, but this is not generally recommended due to the 
1012 
risk of analphylaxis (162). 
1013 
 [E8] Duration of antithyroid drug therapy for GD 
1014 
■ RECOMMENDATION 21 
1015 
Measurement of TRAb levels prior to stopping ATD therapy is suggested, as it aids in 
1016 
predicting which patients can be weaned from the medication, with normal levels 
1017 
indicating greater chance for remission. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality 
1018 
evidence. 
1019 
■ RECOMMENDATION 22 
1020 
If MMI is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, the medication should be continued 
1021 
for approximately 12–18 months, then discontinued if the TSH and TRAb levels are 
1022 
normal at that time. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. 
1023 
■ RECOMMENDATION 23 
1024 
If a patient with GD becomes hyperthyroid after completing a course of MMI, 
1025 
consideration should be given to treatment with RAI or thyroidectomy. Continued 
1026 
low-dose MMI treatment for longer than 12–18 months may be considered in patients 
1027 
 not in remission who prefer this approach. Weak recommendation, low-quality 
1028 
evidence. 
1029 
 
A patient is considered to be in remission if they have had a normal serum TSH, 
1030 
free T4, and total T3 for 1 year after discontinuation of ATD therapy. The remission rate 
1031 
varies considerably between geographical areas. In earlier studies in the United States, 
1032 
about 20%–30% of patients were reported to have a lasting remission after 12–18 months 
1033 
of medication, (59), but more recent data are not available. The remission rate may be 
1034 
higher in Europe and Japan; a long-term European study indicated a 50–60% remission 
1035 
rate after 5–6 years of treatment (163), and a study in Japan reported a 68% remission 
1036 
rate after 2 years of treatment (164). A meta-analysis shows the remission rate in adults is 
1037 
not improved by a course of ATDs longer than 18 months (119). A lower remission rate 
1038 
has been described in men, smokers (especially men), and those with large goiters (≥ 80 
1039 
g) (165-169).  Higher initial doses of MMI (60-80 mg/day) do not improve remission 
1040 
rates, but increase the risk of side effects, and are not recommended (170).   
1041 
 
TRAb assessment at the end of the course of ATD therapy is a useful method of 
1042 
dividing patients into 2 groups:  one with persistent elevations who are unlikely to be in 
1043 
remission, and another group with low or undetectable TRAb, who have a higher 
1044 
probability of permanent remission (171,172).   In the group with elevated TRAb, relapse 
1045 
rates approach 80-100%, while in the latter group, relapse rates are in the 20-30% range 
1046 
(171,172).   
1047 
[E9] Persistently elevated TRAb 
1048 
   
Patients with persistently high TRAb  could continue ATD therapy (and repeat 
1049 
TRAb after  an additional 12-18 months) or opt for alternate definitive therapy with RAI 
1050 
or surgery.  In selected patients (i.e., younger patients with mild stable disease on a low 
1051 
dose of MMI), long-term MMI is a reasonable alternative approach (65,173).  Another 
1052 
study by the same author reported that MMI doses of 2.5 – 10 mg/day for a mean of 14 
1053 
years were safe and effective for the control of GD in 59 patients (174). A recent 
1054 
retrospective analysis compared long term outcomes (mean follow up period of 6-7 
1055 
years) of patients who had relapsed after a course of ATDs, who were treated with either 
1056 
RAI and levothyroxine or long-term ATD therapy (175). Those patients treated with RAI 
1057 
(n=114) more often had persistent thyroid eye disease, continuing thyroid dysfunction, 
1058 
and experienced more weight gain compared to those patients receiving long-term ATD 
1059 
treatment (n=124). 
1060 
 
If continued MMI therapy is chosen, TRAb levels might be monitored every 1-2 
1061 
years, with consideration of MMI discontinuation if TRAb levels become negative over 
1062 
long term follow up.   For patients choosing long-term MMI therapy, monitoring of 
1063 
thyroid function every 4-6 months is reasonable, and patients can be seen for follow up 
1064 
visits every 6-12 months.   
1065 
[E10] Negative TRAb 
1066 
 
If TRAb is negative and thyroid function is normal at the end of 12-18 months 
1067 
of MMI therapy, it is reasonable to discontinue the drug.  If a patient experiences a 
1068 
relapse in follow up, RAI therapy or surgery should be considered.  
1069 
  
Technical remarks: In patients with negative TRAb, relapses tend to occur 
1070 
relatively later than those that develop in patients whose MMI is stopped when TRAb is 
1071 
still positive (171,176), although 5% occurred within the first 2 months (167).  Therefore, 
1072 
in this population, thyroid function testing should be monitored at 2 to 3-month intervals 
1073 
for the first 6 months, then at 4 to 6-month intervals for the next 6 months, then every 6 
1074 
to 12 months, in order to detect relapses as early as possible. The patient should be 
1075 
counseled to contact the treating physician if symptoms of hyperthyroidism are 
1076 
recognized.  Should a relapse occur, patients should be counseled about alternatives for 
1077 
therapy, which would include another course of MMI, RAI, or surgery.  If ATD therapy 
1078 
is chosen, patients should be aware that agranulocytosis can occur with a second 
1079 
exposure to a drug, even many years later, despite an earlier uneventful course of therapy 
1080 
(177,178).   If the patient remains euthyroid for more than 1 year (i.e., they are in 
1081 
remission), thyroid function should be monitored at least annually, as relapses can occur 
1082 
years later (171), and some patients eventually become hypothyroid (179).

1085 
[F1] Preparation of patients with GD for thyroidectomy 
1086 
■ RECOMMENDATION 24 
1087 
If surgery is chosen as treatment for GD, patients should be rendered euthyroid prior 
1088 
to the procedure with ATD pretreatment, with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. A 
1089 
 potassium iodide containing preparation should be given in the immediate 
1090 
preoperative period. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1091 
■ RECOMMENDATION 25 
1092 
Calcium and 25-OH-vitamin D should be assessed preoperatively and repleted if 
1093 
necessary, or given prophylactically.  Calcitriol supplementation should be considered 
1094 
preoperatively in patients at increased risk for transient or permanent 
1095 
hypoparathyroidism. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1096 
■ RECOMMENDATION 26 
1097 
In exceptional circumstances, when it is not possible to render a patient with GD 
1098 
euthyroid prior to thyroidectomy, the need for thyroidectomy is urgent, or when the 
1099 
patient is allergic to ATDs, the patient should be adequately treated with beta-
1100 
blockade, potassium iodide, glucocorticoids, and potentially cholestyramine in the 
1101 
immediate preoperative period. The surgeon and anesthesiologist should have 
1102 
experience in this situation. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1103 
 
Thyroid storm may be precipitated by the stress of surgery, anesthesia, or thyroid 
1104 
manipulation and may be prevented by pretreatment with ATDs. Whenever possible, 
1105 
thyrotoxic patients who are undergoing thyroidectomy should be rendered euthyroid by 
1106 
MMI before undergoing surgery (180). Preoperative potassium iodide, saturated solution 
1107 
of potassium iodide (SSKI), or Lugol’s solution should be used before surgery in most 
1108 
patients with GD. This treatment is beneficial as it decreases thyroid blood flow, 
1109 
vascularity, and intraoperative blood loss during thyroidectomy (181,182).  In a recent 
1110 
 series of 162 patients with GD and 102 patients with TMNG, none of whom received 
1111 
SSKI preoperatively, there were no significant differences in operative times, blood loss, 
1112 
or postoperative complications between the two groups; the authors concluded that 
1113 
omitting preoperative SSKI for GD patients does not impair patient outcomes (183). 
1114 
Given that this study was performed at a single high-volume institution, its findings may 
1115 
not be generalizable; comparison was made between two different pathologies, and there 
1116 
was no comparison group of patients with GD who received SSKI. It is unclear also 
1117 
whether it was adequately powered to detect a significant difference, if one existed. 
1118 
However this study mitigates concern when thyroidectomy is scheduled and SSKI is not 
1119 
given because of shortages, scheduling issues, patient allergy or patient intolerance. In 
1120 
addition, rapid preparation for emergent surgery can be facilitated by the use of 
1121 
corticosteroids (184), and potentially cholestyramine (185-187). 
1122 
 
Technical remarks: Potassium iodide can be given as 5–7 drops (0.25–0.35 mL) 
1123 
of Lugol’s solution (8 mg iodide/drop) or 1–2 drops (0.05–0.1 mL) of SSKI (50 mg 
1124 
iodide/drop) three times daily mixed in water or juice for 10 days before surgery. 
1125 
 
Recent data suggest that supplementing oral calcium and/or vitamin D 
1126 
preoperatively may reduce the risk of postoperative hypocalcemia due to parathyroid 
1127 
injury or increased bone turnover (188).  Oltmann et al compared 45 Graves’ patients 
1128 
treated with 1 g oral calcium carbonate three times a day for two weeks prior to surgery 
1129 
to 38 Graves’ patients who underwent thyroidectomy without treatment, as well as 38 
1130 
euthyroid controls; rates of biochemical and symptomatic hypocalcemia were 
1131 
significantly higher in non-treated Graves’ patients compared to the two other treatment 
1132 
 groups (189).  Another study that focused on postoperative hypocalcemia after thyroid 
1133 
surgery for thyroid cancer, not hyperthyroidism, identified a reduction in postoperative 
1134 
symptomatic hypocalcemia when patients have preoperative serum 25-hydroxy vitamin 
1135 
D levels >20 ng/ml (>8 nmol/l) prior to the operating room (190). A meta-analysis of risk 
1136 
factors for postoperative hypocalcemia identified preoperative vitamin D deficiency as a 
1137 
risk factor for postoperative hypocalcemia, as well as GD itself (188).  In two studies 
1138 
included in another meta-analysis, supplementing calcitriol for a brief period 
1139 
preoperatively helped reduce transient post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia (191-193).

 [F2] The surgical procedure and choice of surgeon 
1141 
■ RECOMMENDATION 27 
1142 
If surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, near-total or total thyroidectomy is 
1143 
the procedure of choice. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1144 
 
Thyroidectomy has a high cure rate for the hyperthyroidism of GD. Total 
1145 
thyroidectomy has a nearly 0% risk of recurrence, whereas subtotal thyroidectomy may 
1146 
have an 8% chance of persistence or recurrence of hyperthyroidism at 5 years (194-197).  
1147 
The most common complications following near-total or total thyroidectomy are 
1148 
hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism (which can be transient or permanent), 
1149 
recurrent or superior laryngeal nerve injury (which can be temporary or permanent), 
1150 
postoperative bleeding, and complications related to general anesthesia. 
1151 
■ RECOMMENDATION 28 
1152 
 If surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, the patient should be referred to a 
1153 
high-volume thyroid surgeon. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1154 
 
Improved patient outcome has been shown to be independently associated with 
1155 
high thyroidectomy surgeon volume; specifically, average complication rates, length of 
1156 
hospital stay, and cost are reduced when the operation is performed by a surgeon who 
1157 
conducts many thyroidectomies. A significant association is seen between increasing 
1158 
thyroidectomy volume and improved patient outcome; the association is robust and is 
1159 
more pronounced with an increasing number of thyroidectomies (198,199). Data show 
1160 
that surgeons who perform more than 25 thyroid surgeries per year have superior patient 
1161 
clinical and economic outcomes compared to those who perform fewer; complication 
1162 
rates are 51% higher on average when surgery is performed by low-volume 
1163 
surgeons (62,199,200).   
The surgeon should be thoroughly trained in the procedure, 
1164 
have an active practice in thyroid surgery, and have conducted a significant number of 
1165 
thyroidectomies with a low frequency of complications. Following thyroidectomy for GD 
1166 
in the hands of high-volume thyroid surgeons, the rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism 
1167 
has been determined to be <2%, and permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury 
1168 
occurs in <1% (201). The frequency of bleeding necessitating reoperation is 0.3%–0.7% 
1169 
(202). Mortality following thyroidectomy is between 1 in 10,000 and 5 in 1,000,000 
1170 
(203). 
1171 
 [F3] Postoperative care 
1172 
■ RECOMMENDATION 29 
1173 
 Following thyroidectomy for GD, alternative strategies may be undertaken for 
1174 
management of calcium levels: serum calcium ± intact parathyroid hormone levels can 
1175 
be measured, and oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation administered based on 
1176 
these results, or prophylactic calcium with or without calcitriol prescribed empirically. 
1177 
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1178 
 
Successful prediction of calcium status after total thyroidectomy can be achieved 
1179 
using the slope of 6- and 12-hour postoperative calcium levels (204-210). Postoperative 
1180 
routine supplementation with oral calcium and calcitriol decreases development of 
1181 
hypocalcemic symptoms and intravenous calcium requirement, allowing for safer early 
1182 
discharge (211). Low iPTH levels (<10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative 
1183 
setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for calcium and calcitriol 
1184 
(1,25 vitamin D) supplementation (212,213). However, normal levels of serum iPTH may 
1185 
not predict eucalcemia for GD patients (214). Vitamin D insufficiency may serve as an 
1186 
underlying cause.   
1187 
 
1188 
 
Patients can be discharged if they are asymptomatic and their serum calcium 
1189 
levels corrected for albumin are 8.0 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or above and are not falling 
1190 
over a 24-hr period. The use of ionized calcium measurements are preferred by some, and 
1191 
are helpful if the patient has abnormal levels of serum proteins.  Intravenous calcium 
1192 
gluconate should be readily available and may be administered if patients have worsening 
1193 
hypocalcemic symptoms despite oral supplementation and/or their concomitant serum 
1194 
calcium levels are falling despite oral repletion. In patients with severe hypocalcemia, 
1195 
 teriparatide administration has yielded encouraging preliminary results (elimination of 
1196 
symptoms and earlier hospital discharge), but more data are needed before it can be 
1197 
considered for clinical practice (215). Persistent hypocalcemia in the postoperative period 
1198 
should prompt measurement of serum magnesium and possible magnesium repletion 
1199 
(216,217). In addition to reduced serum calcium levels, reduced serum phosphate and 
1200 
increased serum potassium levels may be observed in hungry bone syndrome. Following 
1201 
discharge, serum iPTH levels should be measured in the setting of persistent 
1202 
hypocalcemia to determine if permanent hypoparathyroidism is truly present or whether 
1203 
‘‘bone hunger’’ is ongoing. As the patient reaches eucalcemia, calcium and calcitriol 
1204 
therapy can be tapered.  
1205 
 
Technical remarks: Calcium supplementation can be accomplished with oral 
1206 
calcium (usually calcium carbonate, 1250–2500 mg, equivalent to 500-1000 mg 
1207 
elemental calcium) four times daily, tapered by 500 mg of elemental calcium every 2 
1208 
days, or 1000 mg every 4 days as tolerated. In addition, calcitriol may be started at a dose 
1209 
of 0.5 mcg daily and continued for 1–2 weeks (218) and increased or tapered according to 
1210 
the calcium and/or iPTH level. Patients can be discharged if they are asymptomatic and 
1211 
have stable serum calcium levels. Postoperative evaluation is generally conducted 1–2 
1212 
weeks following discharge with continuation of supplementation based on clinical 
1213 
parameters. 
1214 
■ RECOMMENDATION 30 
1215 
 ATD should be stopped at the time of thyroidectomy for GD, and beta-adrenergic

1217 
evidence. 
1218 
■ RECOMMENDATION 31 
1219 
Following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose 
1220 
appropriate for the patient’s weight (0.8 µg/lb or 1.6 µg/kg), with elderly patients 
1221 
needing somewhat less, and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively. Strong 
1222 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1223 
 
Technical remarks: If TSH was suppressed preoperatively, a free T4 and TSH 
1224 
should be measured 6-8 weeks postoperatively, since recovery of the pituitary-
1225 
thyroid axis is occasionally delayed.  The appropriate dosing of L-thyroxine will vary 
1226 
with patient BMI (219), and the percent of levothyroxine absorbed from the gut. Once 
1227 
stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently if clinically 
1228 
indicated. 
1229 
■ RECOMMENDATION 32 
1230 
Communication among different members of the multidisciplinary team is essential, 
1231 
particularly during transitions of care in the pre- and postoperative settings. Strong 
1232 
recommendation, low-quality evidence.  
1233 
 
It is important to assure that adequate communication occurs between the medical 
1234 
team and the treating surgeon to assure that euthyroidism is achievable prior to surgical 
1235 
 intervention; in addition, if the patient is noted to have significant vitamin D deficiency, 
1236 
preoperative vitamin D repletion could be performed and surgery scheduled to permit 
1237 
this. Important intraoperative findings and details of postoperative care, including 
1238 
calcium supplementation needs and management of surgical hypothyroidism, should be 
1239 
communicated by the surgeon to the patient and the other physicians who will be 
1240 
important in the patient’s postoperative care (220).

[G] How should thyroid nodules be managed in patients with GD? 
1243 
■ RECOMMENDATION 33 
1244 
If a thyroid nodule is discovered in a patient with GD, the nodule should be evaluated 
1245 
and managed according to recently published guidelines regarding thyroid nodules in 
1246 
euthyroid individuals. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1247 
 
Thyroid cancer occurs in GD with a frequency of 2% or less (221). Thyroid 
1248 
nodules larger than 1–1.5 cm should be evaluated before RAI therapy. If a radioactive 
1249 
iodine scan is performed, any nonfunctioning or hypo-functioning nodules should be 
1250 
considered for fine needle aspiration (FNA), as these may have a higher probability of 
1251 
being malignant (62). If the cytopathology is suspicious or diagnostic of malignancy, 
1252 
surgery is advised after normalization of thyroid function with ATDs. Surgery should 
1253 
also be considered for indeterminate cytology. Disease-free survival at 20 years is 
1254 
reported to be 99% after thyroidectomy for GD in patients with small (≤1 cm) coexisting 
1255 
thyroid cancers (222). 
1256 
  
The use of thyroid ultrasonography in all patients with GD has been shown to 
1257 
identify more nodules and cancer than does palpation and 123I scintigraphy. However, 
1258 
since most of these cancers are papillary microcarcinomas with minimal clinical impact, 
1259 
further study is required before routine ultrasound (which may lead to surgery) can be 
1260 
recommended (223,224).

[H] How should thyroid storm be managed? 
1265 
■ RECOMMENDATION 34  
1266 
The diagnosis of thyroid storm should be made clinically in a severely thyrotoxic 
1267 
patient with evidence of systemic decompensation.  Adjunctive use of a sensitive 
1268 
diagnostic system should be considered.  Patients with a Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale 
1269 
(BWPS) of ≥ 45 or Japanese Thyroid Association (JTA) categories of TS1 or TS2 
1270 
with evidence of systemic decompensation require aggressive therapy.  The decision 
1271 
to use aggressive therapy in patients with a BWPS of 25-44 should be based on 
1272 
clinical judgment.  Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1273 
■ RECOMMENDATION 35  
1274 
A multimodality treatment approach to patients with thyroid storm should be used, 
1275 
including beta-adrenergic blockade, antithyroid drug therapy, inorganic iodide, 
1276 
 corticosteroid therapy, cooling with acetaminophen and cooling blankets, volume 
1277 
resuscitation, nutritional support, respiratory care and monitoring in an intensive care 
1278 
unit, as appropriate for an individual patient. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
1279 
evidence. 
1280 
 
Life-threatening thyrotoxicosis or thyroid storm is a rare disorder characterized by 
1281 
multisystem involvement and mortality rates in the range of 8-25% in modern series 
1282 
(25,72,226,227). A high index of suspicion for thyroid storm should be maintained in 
1283 
patients with thyrotoxicosis associated with any evidence of systemic decompensation. 
1284 
Diagnostic criteria for thyroid storm in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis were first 
1285 
proposed in 1993 and subsequently widely adopted as the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale 
1286 
for thyroid storm (26,72,186,226,228). These criteria (Table 6) include hyperpyrexia, 
1287 
tachycardia, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor 
1288 
and coma, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hepatic failure, and the presence of an 
1289 
identified precipitant (26). Points are awarded in the BWPS system based on the severity 
1290 
of individual manifestations, with a point total of  ≥ 45 consistent with thyroid storm, 25-
1291 
44 points classified as impending thyroid storm, and < 25 points making thyroid storm 
1292 
unlikely.  Recently, an additional empirically defined diagnostic system has been 
1293 
proposed by the Japanese Thyroid Association (JTA) (72). The JTA system uses 
1294 
combinations of similar clinical features to assign patients to the diagnostic categories 
1295 
thyroid storm 1 (TS1) or thyroid storm 2 (TS2).  
1296 
 
Data comparing these two diagnostic systems suggest an overall agreement, but a 
1297 
tendency toward under-diagnosis using the JTA categories of TS1 and TS2, compared to 
1298 
 a BWPS ≥ 45 (72,186,226,227). In a recent study including 25 patients with a clinical 
1299 
diagnosis of thyroid storm, the BWPS was ≥ 45 in 20 patients and 25-44 in the remaining 
1300 
five, but these latter five patients (20%) were not identified using the JTA system (226).  
1301 
 
Importantly, in the same series, among 125 patients hospitalized with a clinical 
1302 
diagnosis of compensated thyrotoxicosis but not in thyroid storm, 27 (21.6%) had a 
1303 
BWPS ≥ 45, and 21 (16.8%) were either TS1 or TS2, suggesting similar rates of over-
1304 
diagnosis with these two systems.  However, an additional 50 patients (40%) hospitalized 
1305 
with a clinical diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm would have been 
1306 
diagnosed as having impending thyroid storm by the BWPS, which reinforces that a 
1307 
BWPS in the 25-44 range does not supplant clinical judgment in the selection of patients 
1308 
for aggressive therapy. 
1309 
 
In summary, the diagnosis of thyroid storm remains a clinical one that is 
1310 
augmented by current diagnostic systems.  A BWPS ≥ 45 appears more sensitive than a 
1311 
JTA classification of TS1 or TS2 in detecting patients with a clinical diagnosis of thyroid 
1312 
storm, but patients with a BWPS of 25-44 represent a group in whom the decision to use 
1313 
aggressive therapy should be based on sound clinical judgment, and not based solely on 
1314 
diagnostic category, in order to avoid over-treatment and the resultant risk of drug 
1315 
toxicity.  At a minimum, patients in this intermediate category should be observed closely 
1316 
for deterioration.  Care should be taken with either system to avoid inappropriate 
1317 
application to patients without severe thyrotoxicosis as each of the manifestations of 
1318 
thyroid storm, with the possible exception of severe hyperpyrexia, may also be seen in 
1319 
 the presence of any major illness, many of which are also known precipitants of thyroid 
1320 
storm (186).  
1321 
 
Precipitants of thyroid storm in a patient with previously compensated 
1322 
thyrotoxicosis include abrupt cessation of ATDs, thyroidectomy, or nonthyroidal surgery 
1323 
in a patient with unrecognized or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis, and a number of 
1324 
acute illnesses unrelated to thyroid disease (72,186,228). Thyroid storm occasionally 
1325 
occurs following RAI therapy.  
1326 
 
Aggressive treatment for thyroid storm involves the early targeting of each 
1327 
pharmacologically accessible step in thyroid hormone production and action (Table 7). 
1328 
Treatment strategy for thyroid storm can be broadly divided into 1) therapy directed 
1329 
against thyroid hormone secretion; 2) measures directed against the peripheral action of 
1330 
thyroid hormone at the tissue level; 3) reversal of systemic decompensation; 4) treatment 
1331 
of the precipitating event or intercurrent illness; and 5) definitive therapy (26). A number 
1332 
of therapeutic measures are specifically intended to decrease T4-to-T3 conversion, such as 
1333 
the preferential use of PTU over MMI (229,230), glucocorticoid therapy (231), and the 
1334 
use of beta adrenergic blocking agents such as propranolol, with selective ability to 
1335 
inhibit type 1 deiodinase (232). For example, an early article comparing acute changes in 
1336 
thyroid hormone level after initiation of PTU or MMI found that T3 levels dropped by 
1337 
approximately 45% in the first 24 hours of PTU therapy compared to an approximately 
1338 
10-15% decrease after starting MMI (229). Both plasmapheresis/ plasma exchange and 
1339 
emergency surgery have been used to treat thyroid storm in patients who respond poorly 
1340 
to traditional therapeutic measures (233,234).  
1341 
  
Prevention of thyroid storm involves recognition and active avoidance of common 
1342 
precipitants, patient education to avoid abrupt discontinuation of ATD therapy, and 
1343 
ensuring that patients are euthyroid prior to elective surgery, labor and delivery, or other 
1344 
acute stressors. 
1345 
 
Technical remarks: Treatment with inorganic iodine (SSKI/Lugol’s solution), or 
1346 
oral cholecystographic agents (235) leads to rapid decreases in both T4 and T3 levels. 
1347 
Combined with ATDs in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis, these agents result in rapid 
1348 
clinical improvement (120). Unfortunately, the oral radiographic contrast agents ipodate 
1349 
and iopanoic acid are not currently available in many countries. 
1350 
 
1351 
[I] Is there a role for iodine as primary therapy in the treatment of GD?      
1352 
 
Prior to the introduction of ATDs, iodine was commonly reported to ameliorate 
1353 
the hyperthyroidism associated with GD (236,237).  Iodine acutely lowers thyroid 
1354 
hormone concentrations by reducing hormone secretion (238,239), and inhibits its own 
1355 
organification (the Wolff-Chaikoff effect) (240).  However, reports of escape from these 
1356 
beneficial effects of iodine (241), as well as reports of iodine induced hyperthyroidism in 
1357 
patients with nodular goiter (242), discouraged the use of iodine in GD.  Recent studies 
1358 
have suggested a potential role for iodine in patients who have had adverse reactions to 
1359 
ATD and who also have a contraindication or aversion to RAI or surgery (243,244). 
1360 
 
1361 
 RECOMMENDATION 36 
1362 
Potassium iodide may be of benefit in select patients with hyperthyroidism due to GD, 
1363 
who have adverse reactions to ATDs, and have a contraindication or aversion to RAI 
1364 
therapy (or aversion  to repeat RAI therapy) or surgery.  Treatment may be more 
1365 
suitable for patients with mild hyperthyroidism, or a prior history of RAI therapy.  No 
1366 
recommendation, insufficient evidence to assess benefits or risks. 
1367 
 
Among 44 Japanese patients who had adverse reactions to ATD and who were 
1368 
treated with KI alone, 66% were well-controlled for an average of 18 years (range 9-28 
1369 
years), and 39% achieved a remission after 7 years (range 2-23 years) (243).  Among the 
1370 
responders, the doses used were between 13 and 100 mg, and were adjusted depending 
1371 
upon biochemical response.  Among 15 nonresponders, 11 (25% of all patients) escaped 
1372 
the inhibitory effects of iodine and 4 patients did not respond at all to KI.   None of the 
1373 
patients had side effects.  Initial free T4 concentration and goiter size did not predict a 
1374 
response to therapy. Among 20 Japanese patients with mild hyperthyroidism initially 
1375 
treated with KI alone, and matched using propensity score analysis with patients treated 
1376 
with MMI alone, 85% of the patients treated with KI alone had normal thyroid function at 
1377 
6 months and 1 year, comparable to that of the matched controls treated with MMI (244).  
1378 
Most patients were treated with 50 mg KI daily.   
1379 
 
The inhibitory effects of iodine are greater in patients with a prior history of RAI 
1380 
exposure (245) suggesting a role for KI in patients who remain hyperthyroid after one 
1381 
dose of RAI and prefer to avoid a second dose.  The use of KI prior to thyroidectomy for 
1382 
GD is discussed in section [F1], the use of KI as adjunctive therapy following RAI is 
1383 
 discussed in section [D1], the use of KI in combination with MMI for treating GD is 
1384 
discussed in section [E1], and the use of KI in hyperthyroidism complicating pregnancy 
1385 
is discussed in section [T]. 
1386 
 
1387 
[J] How should overt hyperthyroidism due to TMNG or TA be managed? 
1388 
■ RECOMMENDATION 37 
1389 
We suggest that patients with overtly TMNG or TA be treated with RAI therapy or 
1390 
thyroidectomy. On occasion, long-term, low-dose treatment with MMI may be 
1391 
appropriate. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1392 
 
There are two effective and relatively safe definitive treatment options for 
1393 
TMNG and TA, RAI therapy and thyroid surgery. The decision regarding treatment 
1394 
should take into consideration a number of clinical and demographic factors, as well as 
1395 
patient preference. The goal of therapy is the rapid and durable elimination of the 
1396 
hyperthyroid state. 
1397 
 
For patients with TMNG, the risk of treatment failure or need for repeat 
1398 
treatment is <1% following near-total and/total thyroidectomy (246,247), compared 
1399 
with a 20% risk of the need for retreatment following RAI therapy (246,248). 
1400 
Euthyroidism is achieved within days after surgery (246,247). On the other hand, the 
1401 
risk of hypothyroidism and the requirement for exogenous thyroid hormone therapy is 
1402 
100% after near-total/total thyroidectomy. For patients with TMNG who receive RAI 
1403 
 therapy, the response is 50–60% by 3 months, and 80% by 6 months (246,248,249). In 
1404 
a large study of patients with TMNG treated with RAI, the prevalence of 
1405 
hypothyroidism was 3% at 1 year and 64% at 24 years (250). Hypothyroidism was 
1406 
more common among patients under 50 years of age, compared with those over 70 
1407 
years (61% vs. 36% after 16 years). In a more recent study, the prevalence of 
1408 
hypothyroidism was 4% at 1 year and 16% at 5 years (251).  
1409 
 
In large retrospective series of patients with TMNG presenting with 
1410 
compressive symptoms, all patients undergoing total thyroidectomy had resolution of 
1411 
these symptoms after treatment, whereas only 46% of patients undergoing RAI had 
1412 
improvement in such symptoms (252). This may be due in part to the fact that very 
1413 
large goiters treated with high-activity radioactive iodine only decrease in size by 30%–
1414 
50% (253). 
1415 
 
For patients with TA, the risk of treatment failure is <1% after surgical resection 
1416 
(ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy or isthmusectomy) (254). Typically, euthyroidism is 
1417 
achieved within days after surgery. The prevalence of hypothyroidism varies from 2-
1418 
3% following lobectomy for TA, although rates of hypothyroidism after lobectomy for 
1419 
non-toxic nodules have been reported to be as high as 20% (254-256), and lower after 
1420 
isthmusectomy in the unique circumstance where the TA is confined to the thyroid 
1421 
isthmus. For patients with TA who receive RAI therapy there is a 6%–18% risk of 
1422 
persistent hyperthyroidism and a 3%- 5.5% risk of recurrent hyperthyroidism 
1423 
(254,257). There is a 75% response rate by 3 months and 89% rate by 1 year following 
1424 
RAI therapy for TA (225,257,258). The prevalence of hypothyroidism after RAI is 
1425 
 progressive and hastened by the presence of antithyroid antibodies or a nonsuppressed 
1426 
TSH at the time of treatment (257,259,260). A study following 684 patients with TA 
1427 
treated with RAI reported a progressive increase in overt and subclinical 
1428 
hypothyroidism (259). At 1 year, the investigators noted a 7.6% prevalence, with 28% 
1429 
at 5 years, 46% at 10 years, and 60% at 20 years. They observed a faster progression to 
1430 
hypothyroidism among patients who were older and who had incomplete TSH 
1431 
suppression (correlating with only partial extranodular parenchymal suppression) due to 
1432 
prior therapy with ATDs. The nodule is rarely eradicated in patients with TA 
1433 
undergoing RAI therapy, which can lead to the need for continued surveillance 
1434 
(225,257,260).  
1435 
 
Potential complications following near-total/total thyroidectomy include the risk 
1436 
of permanent hypoparathyroidism (<2.0%) or RLN injury (<2.0%) (261,262). There is 
1437 
a small risk of permanent RLN injury with surgery for TA (254). Following RAI 
1438 
therapy, there have been reports of new-onset GD (up to 4% prevalence) (263), as well 
1439 
as concern for thyroid malignancy (254,264,265) and a very minimal increase in late 
1440 
non-thyroid malignancy (265). Overall, the success rate of RAI (definitive 
1441 
hypothyroidism or euthyroidism) is high: 93.7% in TA and 81.1% in TMNG patients 
1442 
(266). 
1443 
 
Technical remarks: Once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician 
1444 
and patient should discuss each of the treatment options, including the logistics, 
1445 
benefits, expected speed of recovery, drawbacks, side effects, and costs. This sets the 
1446 
stage for the physician to make a recommendation based upon best clinical judgment 
1447 
 and for the final decision to incorporate the personal values and preferences of the 
1448 
patient.  Autonomy is an uncommon cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy and there 
1449 
is a lack of studies in this setting.  However, considering the theoretical risks associated 
1450 
with surgery or ATD therapy (has to be used throughout pregnancy and there is a 
1451 
tendency to overtreat the fetus), the optimal therapy might be definitive therapy with 
1452 
RAI or surgery in advance of a planned pregnancy. Most experts prefer to avoid the use 
1453 
of RAI within 6 months of a pregnancy; it should be used with caution if at all. 
1454 
 
The panel agreed that TMNG and TA with high nodular RAI uptake and widely 
1455 
suppressed RAI uptake in the perinodular thyroid tissue are especially suitable for RAI 
1456 
therapy. However, there are insufficient data to make a recommendation based on these 
1457 
findings. 
1458 
 
1459 
Factors that favor a particular modality as treatment for TMNG or TA (Table 
1460 
8): 
1461 
a. RAI therapy: Advanced patient age, significant comorbidity, prior surgery or 
1462 
scarring in the anterior neck, small goiter size, RAIU sufficient to allow therapy, 
1463 
and lack of access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon (the latter factor is more 
1464 
important for TMNG than for TA). 
1465 
b. Surgery: Presence of symptoms or signs of compression within the neck, concern 
1466 
for coexisting thyroid cancer, coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery, 
1467 
 large goiter size (>80 g), substernal or retrosternal extension, RAIU insufficient 
1468 
for therapy, or need for rapid correction of the thyrotoxic state (252). 
1469 
c. ATDs: Advanced age, comorbities with increased surgical risk or associated with 
1470 
decreased life-expectancy, and not good candidates for ablative therapy. 
1471 
Contraindications to a particular modality as treatment for TMNG or TA: 
1472 
a. RAI therapy: Definite contraindications to the use of radioactive iodine include 
1473 
pregnancy, lactation, coexisting thyroid cancer, individuals unable to comply with 
1474 
radiation safety guidelines and used with caution in women planning a pregnancy 
1475 
within 4–6 months. 
1476 
b. Surgery: Factors weighing against the choice of surgery include significant 
1477 
comorbidity such as cardiopulmonary disease, end-stage cancer, or other 
1478 
debilitating disorders, or lack of access to a high volume thyroid surgeon. 
1479 
Pregnancy is a relative contraindication and should only be used in this 
1480 
circumstance when rapid control of hyperthyroidism is required and ATDs cannot 
1481 
be used. Thyroidectomy is best avoided in the first and third trimesters of 
1482 
pregnancy because of teratogenic effects associated with anesthetic agents and 
1483 
increased risk of fetal loss in the first trimester, and increased risk of preterm 
1484 
labor in the third. Optimally, thyroidectomy should be performed in the latter 
1485 
portion of the second trimester. Although it is the safest time, it is not without risk 
1486 
(4.5%–5.5% risk of preterm labor) (67,68). 
1487 
c. Definite contraindications to ATD therapy include previous known major adverse 
1488 
reactions to ATDs. 
1489 
 Factors that may impact patient preference: 
1490 
a. RAI therapy: Patients with either TMNG or TA choosing RAI therapy would likely 
1491 
place relatively higher value on the avoidance of surgery and attendant 
1492 
hospitalization or complications arising from either surgery or anesthesia; also, 
1493 
patients with TMNG would place greater value on the possibility of remaining 
1494 
euthyroid after RAI treatment. 
1495 
b. Surgery: Patients choosing surgery would likely place a relatively higher value on 
1496 
definitive control of hyperthyroid symptoms, avoidance of exposure to 
1497 
radioactivity and a lower value on potential surgical and anesthetic risks; patients 
1498 
with TMNG choosing surgery would place a lower value on the certain need for 
1499 
lifelong thyroid hormone replacement whereas patients with TA who choose 
1500 
surgery would place greater value on the possibility of achieving euthyroidism 
1501 
without hormone replacement.  
1502 
c. ATDs: Patients choosing ATDs would likely place a relatively higher value on 
1503 
avoidance of exposure to radioactivity and on potential surgical and anesthetic 
1504 
risks and a lower value on the certain need for lifelong thyroid ATD therapy.

1508 
■ RECOMMENDATION 38 
1509 
 Because RAI treatment of TMNG or TA can cause a transient exacerbation of 
1510 
hyperthyroidism, beta-adrenergic blockade should be considered even in 
1511 
asymptomatic patients who are at increased risk for complications due to worsening of 
1512 
hyperthyroidism, i.e. elderly patients and patients with co-morbidities. Weak 
1513 
recommendation, low-quality evidence.  
1514 
 
Medical management before RAI therapy should be tailored to the patient’s 
1515 
risk for complications if hyperthyroidism worsens, based on the severity of the 
1516 
hyperthyroidism, patient age, and comorbid conditions. Worsened chemical 
1517 
hyperthyroidism with increased heart rate and rare cases of supraventricular 
1518 
tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, have been observed in patients 
1519 
treated with RAI for either TMNG or nontoxic multindoular goiter (MNG) (267-269). 
1520 
In susceptible patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or in the elderly, this may 
1521 
produce significant clinical worsening (268). Therefore, the use of beta-blockers to 
1522 
prevent post-treatment tachyarrhythmias should be considered in all patients with 
1523 
TMNG or TA who are older than 60 years of age and those with cardiovascular disease 
1524 
or severe hyperthyroidism (31). The decision regarding the use of MMI pretreatment is 
1525 
more complex and is discussed below.  
1526 
■ RECOMMENDATION 39 
1527 
In addition to beta-adrenergic blockade (see Recommendation 2 and 38) pretreatment 
1528 
with MMI prior to RAI therapy for TMNG or TA should be considered in patients 
1529 
who are at increased risk for complications due to worsening of hyperthyroidism, 
1530 
 including the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease or severe hyperthyroidism. 
1531 
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1532 
■ RECOMMENDATION 40 
1533 
In patients who are at increased risk for complications due to worsening of 
1534 
hyperthyroidism, resuming ATDs 3-7 days after RAI administration should be 
1535 
considered. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 
1536 
 
Young and middle-aged patients with TMNG or TA generally do not require 
1537 
pretreatment with ATDs (MMI) before receiving RAI, but may benefit from beta-
1538 
blockade if symptoms warrant and contraindications do not exist. 
1539 
 
Technical remarks: If an ATD is used in preparation for RAI therapy in patients 
1540 
with TMNG or TA, caution should be taken to avoid RAI therapy when the TSH is 
1541 
normal or elevated to prevent direct RAI treatment of perinodular and contralateral 
1542 
normal thyroid tissue, which increases the risk of developing hypothyroidism. However, 
1543 
if volume reduction is a goal, at the expense of an increased risk of hypothyroidism, 
1544 
pretreatment with MMI, allowing the TSH to rise slighty prior to RAI administration, 
1545 
results in greater volume reduction after fixed doses of RAI (270). Similarly, a recent 
1546 
meta-analysis indicated that the application of rhTSH before RAI therapy in non-toxic or 
1547 
TMNG results in greater thyroid volume reduction but higher hypothyroidism rates than 
1548 
RAI therapy alone (271). Unless volume reduction is an important goal, rhTSH 
1549 
administration before RAI therapy of TMNG is not generally recommended as it could 
1550 
 possibly exacerbate hyperthyroidism (272), it represents an off-label use, and mainly 
1551 
stimulates RAI uptake in TSH-sensitive perinodular tissues (273).

1558 
 
Thorough assessment of suspicious nodules within a TMNG, according to the 
1559 
published guidelines (225,274), should be completed before selection of RAI as the 
1560 
treatment of choice. The prevalence of thyroid cancer in TMNG historically has been 
1561 
estimated to be about 3% (247).  More recently, it has been estimated to be as high as 
1562 
9%, which is similar to the 10.6% prevalence noted in nontoxic MNG (275). 
1563 
 
Technical remarks: Both the ATA and AACE, the latter in conjunction with the 
1564 
European Thyroid Association and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi, and the Latin 
1565 
American Thyroid Society have published management guidelines for patients with 
1566 
thyroid nodules (225,274,276,277).

[K3] Administration of RAI in the treatment of TMNG or TA 
1568 
■ RECOMMENDATION 42 
1569 
 Sufficient activity of RAI should be administered in a single application to alleviate 
1570 
hyperthyroidism in patients with TMNG. Strong recommendation, moderate-
1571 
quality evidence.  
1572 
 
The goal of RAI therapy, especially in older patients, is elimination of the 
1573 
hyperthyroid state. Higher activities of RAI, even when appropriately calculated for the 
1574 
specific volume or mass of hyperthyroid tissue, result in more rapid resolution of 
1575 
hyperthyroidism and less need for retreatment, but a higher risk for early 
1576 
hypothyroidism. One study showed a 64% prevalence of hypothyroidism 24 years after 
1577 
RAI therapy for TMNG, with a higher prevalence among patients who required more 
1578 
than one treatment (250). The prevalence of hypothyroidism following RAI therapy is 
1579 
increased by normalization or elevation of TSH at the time of treatment resulting from 
1580 
ATD pretreatment or use of rhTSH, and by the presence of antithyroid antibodies (278). 
1581 
 
The activity of RAI used to treat TMNG, calculated on the basis of goiter size to 
1582 
deliver 150–200 µCi (5.55-7.4 MBq) per gram of tissue corrected for 24-hour RAIU, is 
1583 
usually higher than that needed to treat GD. In addition, the RAIU values for TMNG may 
1584 
be lower, necessitating an increase in the applied activity of RAI. Radiation safety 
1585 
precautions may be onerous if high activities of RAI are needed for large goiters. Both 
1586 
pretreatment with MMI allowing the TSH to rise slightly (270), or the off-label use of 
1587 
rhTSH (271), may reduce the total activity of RAI needed, but increase the risk of 
1588 
hypothyroidism (see prior discussion section [K1]).  
1589 
 
Technical remarks: Enlargement of the thyroid is very rare after RAI treatment. 
1590 
However, patients should be advised to immediately report any tightening of the neck, 
1591 
 difficulty breathing, or stridor following the administration of RAI. Any compressive 
1592 
symptoms, such as discomfort, swelling, dysphagia, or hoarseness, which develop 
1593 
following RAI therapy, should be carefully assessed and monitored, and if clinically 
1594 
necessary, corticosteroids can be administered. Respiratory compromise in this setting is 
1595 
extremely rare and requires management as any other cause of acute tracheal 
1596 
compression. 
1597 
■ RECOMMENDATION 43 
1598 
Sufficient activity of RAI should be administered in a single application to alleviate 
1599 
hyperthyroidism in patients with TA. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality 
1600 
evidence.  
1601 
 
RAI administered to treat TA can be given either as a fixed activity of 
1602 
approximately 10–20 mCi (370-740 MBq) or an activity calculated on the basis of nodule 
1603 
size using 150–200 µCi (5.5-7.4 MBq) RAI per gram corrected for 24-hour RAIU (278). 
1604 
A long-term follow-up study of patients with TA, where patients with nodules <4 cm 
1605 
were administered an average of 13 mCi (481 MBq) and those with larger nodules an 
1606 
average of 17 mCi (629 MBq), showed a progressive increase in hypothyroidism over 
1607 
time in both groups, suggesting that hypothyroidism develops over time regardless of 
1608 
activity adjustment for nodule size (259). A randomized trial of 97 patients with TA 
1609 
compared the effects of high (22.5 mCi / 833 MBq) or low (13 mCi / 481 MBq) fixed 
1610 
activity RAI, with a calculated activity that was either high (180–200 µCi/g / 6.7-7.4 Bq) 
1611 
or low (90–100 µCi/g / 3.3-3.7 Bq) and corrected for 24-hour RAIU (279). This study 
1612 
confirmed previous reports showing an earlier disappearance of hyperthyroidism and 
1613 
 earlier appearance of hypothyroidism with higher RAI activity. Use of a calculated 
1614 
activity allowed for a lower RAI activity to be administered for a similar efficacy in the 
1615 
cure of hyperthyroidism. 
1616 
[K4] Patient follow-up after RAI therapy for TMNG or TA 
1617 
■ RECOMMENDATION 44 
1618 
Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for TMNG or TA should 
1619 
include an assessment of free T4, total T3 and TSH. Biochemical monitoring should be 
1620 
continued at 4–6 week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes 
1621 
hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement. Strong recommendation, 
1622 
low-quality evidence.  
1623 
 
RAI therapy for TMNG results in resolution of hyperthyroidism in approximately 
1624 
55% of patients at 3 months and 80% of patients at 6 months, with an average failure rate 
1625 
of 15% (246-248). Goiter volume is decreased by 3 months, with further reduction 
1626 
observed over 24 months, for a total size reduction of 40% (248). For TA, 75% of 
1627 
patients were no longer hyperthyroid at 3 months, with nodule volume decreased by 35% 
1628 
at 3 months and by 45% at 2 years (257). Risk of persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism 
1629 
ranged from 0% to 30%, depending on the series (246-248,257). Long-term follow-up 
1630 
studies show a progressive risk of clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism of about 8% by 
1631 
1 year and 60% by 20 years for TA (259), and an average of 3% by 1 year and 64% by 24 
1632 
years for TMNG (250). 
1633 
  
Graves’ disease might develop after RAI for TMNG in up to 4% of patients (280). 
1634 
Such patients develop worsening hyperthyroidism within a few months of RAI therapy. 
1635 
Treatment with additional RAI is effective. 
1636 
 
Technical remarks: If thyroid hormone therapy is necessary, the dose required 
1637 
may be less than full replacement due to underlying persistent autonomous thyroid 
1638 
function.

[K5] Treatment of persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism following RAI therapy for 
1640 
TMNG or TA 
1641 
■ RECOMMENDATION 45 
1642 
If hyperthyroidism persists beyond 6 months following RAI therapy for TMNG or 
1643 
TA, retreatment with RAI is suggested. In selected patients with minimal response 3 
1644 
months after therapy additional RAI may be considered. Weak recommandation, 
1645 
low-quality evidence. 
1646 
 
Technical remarks: In severe or refractory cases of persistent hyperthyroidism 
1647 
due to TMNG or TA, following treatment with RAI, surgery may be considered. As 
1648 
some patients with mild hyperthyroidism following RAI administration will continue to 
1649 
improve over time, use of MMI with close monitoring may be considered to allow 
1650 
control of the hyperthyroidism until the RAI is effective.

1653 
 [L1] Preparation of patients with TMNG or TA for surgery 
1654 
■ RECOMMENDATION 46 
1655 
If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG or TA, patients with overt 
1656 
hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior to the procedure with MMI 
1657 
pretreatment, with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. Preoperative iodine should not 
1658 
be used in this setting. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1659 
 
Risks of surgery are increased in the presence of thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxic crisis 
1660 
during or after the operation, can result in extreme hypermetabolism, hyperthermia, 
1661 
tachycardia, hypertension, coma, or death. Therefore, prevention with careful preparation 
1662 
of the patient is of paramount importance (281,282). The literature reports a very low risk 
1663 
of anesthesia-related mortality associated with thyroidectomy (254,283). Preoperative 
1664 
iodine therapy is not indicated due to the risk of exacerbating the hyperthyroidism (284). 
1665 
Usually hyperthyroidism is less severe in patients with TMNG, so that in most cases, 
1666 
patients with allergy to ATDs can be prepared for surgery, when necessary, with beta-
1667 
blockers alone.

[L2] The surgical procedure and choice of surgeon 
1669 
■ RECOMMENDATION 47 
1670 
If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG, near-total or total thyroidectomy should 
1671 
be performed. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1672 
  
Recurrence can be avoided in TMNG if a near-total or total thyroidectomy is 
1673 
performed initially (285).  This procedure can be performed with the same low rate of 
1674 
complications as a subtotal thyroidectomy (286-289). Reoperation for recurrent or 
1675 
persistant goiter results in a 3- to 10-fold increase in the risk of permanent vocal cord 
1676 
paralysis or hypoparathyroidism (290,291). 
1677 
■ RECOMMENDATION 48 
1678 
Surgery for TMNG should be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. Strong 
1679 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1680 
 
TMNG is more common in older patients. Data regarding outcomes following 
1681 
thyroidectomy in elderly patients have shown conflicting results. Overall, however, 
1682 
studies conducted at the population level have demonstrated significantly higher rates 
1683 
of postoperative complications, longer length of hospital stay, and higher costs among 
1684 
elderly patients (198). Data showing equivalent outcomes among the elderly usually 
1685 
have come from high-volume centers (292). There are robust data demonstrating that 
1686 
surgeon volume of thyroidectomies is an independent predictor of patient clinical and 
1687 
economic outcomes (i.e., in-hospital complications, length of stay, and total hospital 
1688 
charges) following thyroid surgery (198,199,293). The recommendation for referral to a 
1689 
high-volume surgeon is essentially the same as that described in section [F2] for the 
1690 
choice of surgeon in GD. 
1691 
■ RECOMMENDATION 49 
1692 
 If surgery is chosen as the treatment for TA, a thyroid ultrasound should be done to 
1693 
evalutate the entire thyroid gland. An ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy, or isthmusectomy 
1694 
if the adenoma is in the thyroid isthmus, should be performed for isolated TAs. Strong 
1695 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1696 
 
A preoperative thyroid ultrasound is useful, as it will detect the presence of 
1697 
contralateral nodularity that is suspicious in appearance or that will necessitate future 
1698 
surveillance, both circumstances in which a total thyroidectomy may be more 
1699 
appropriate. Lobectomy removes the TA while leaving normal thyroid tissue, allowing 
1700 
residual normal thyroid function in the majority of patients. One large clinical series for 
1701 
TA demonstrated no surgical deaths and low complication rates (254). In patients who 
1702 
wish to avoid general anesthesia or who have significant comorbidities, the risk of 
1703 
anesthesia can be lowered further when cervical block analgesia with sedation is 
1704 
employed by thyroid surgeons and anesthesiologists experienced in this approach (294). 
1705 
Patients with positive antithyroid antibodies preoperatively have a higher risk of 
1706 
postoperative hypothyroidism (256,278). 
1707 
■ RECOMMENDATION 50 
1708 
We suggest that surgery for TA be performed by a high-volume surgeon. Weak 
1709 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1710 
 
While surgeon experience in the setting of TA is of somewhat less importance 
1711 
than in TMNG, it remains a factor to consider in deciding between surgery and RAI 
1712 
therapy. High-volume thyroid surgeons tend to have better outcomes following 
1713 
 lobectomy than low-volume surgeons, but the differences are not statistically 
1714 
significant (198). High-volume surgeons may be more comfortable with performing the 
1715 
thyroid lobectomy under cervical block analgesia with sedation.  
1716 
[L3] Postoperative care 
1717 
■ RECOMMENDATION 51 
1718 
Following thyroidectomy for TMNG, serum calcium ± iPTH levels should be 
1719 
measured, and oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation administered based on the 
1720 
results. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1721 
 
Technical remarks: The management of hypocalcemia following thyroidectomy 
1722 
for TMNG is essentially the same as that described in section [F3] for postoperative 
1723 
management in GD. Severe or prolonged preoperative hyperthyroidism, and larger size 
1724 
and greater vascularity of the goiter (more typically seen in GD) increases the risk of 
1725 
postoperative hypocalcemia. 
1726 
■ RECOMMENDATION 52 
1727 
MMI should be stopped at the time of surgery for TMNG or TA. Beta-adrenergic 
1728 
blockade should be slowly discontinued following surgery. Strong recomendation, 
1729 
low-quality evidence. 
1730 
     Technical remarks: The duration over which beta-adrenergic blockade should 
1731 
be tapered should take into account the preoperative free T4 concentration, the 
1732 
 heart rate, and the week-long half-life of T4.  Additionally, patients taking 
1733 
higher doses of beta-blockers will require a longer taper. 
1734 
■ RECOMMENDATION 53 
1735 
Following thyroidectomy for TMNG, thyroid hormone replacement should be started 
1736 
at a dose appropriate for the patient’s weight (0.8 mcg/lb or 1.6 mcg/kg) and age, with 
1737 
elderly patients needing somewhat less. TSH should be measured every 1–2 months 
1738 
until stable, and then annually. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1739 
 
Technical remarks: The appropriate dosing of L-thyroxine will vary with patient 
1740 
BMI (219). If a significant thyroid remnant remains following thyroidectomy, 
1741 
because such a remnant may demonstrate autonomous production of thyroid 
1742 
hormone, immediate postoperative doses of thyroid hormone should be initiated at 
1743 
somewhat less than full replacement doses and subsequently adjusted based on 
1744 
thyroid function testing. 
1745 
■ RECOMMENDATION 54 
1746 
Following lobectomy for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–
1747 
6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a 
1748 
persistent rise in TSH above the normal range. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
1749 
evidence. 
1750 
 
Technical remarks: After lobectomy for TA, serum calcium levels do not need to 
1751 
be obtained, and calcium and calcitriol supplements do not need to be administered.  
1752 
 Thyroid hormone replacement is required in about 15-20% of patients following thyroid 
1753 
lobectomy (295).  Serum TSH levels may have been suppressed or normal prior to 
1754 
lobectomy, depending on the degree of preoperative preparation with ATDs.  TSH levels 
1755 
may remain in the high normal range for 3-6 months following lobectomy; therefore, 
1756 
continued monitoring in an asymptomatic patient for 4-6 months postoperatively is 
1757 
reasonable, since there may be eventual recovery of normal thyroid function (296).

RAI therapy should be used for retreatment of persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism 
1761 
following inadequate surgery for TMNG or TA. Strong recommendation, low-
1762 
quality evidence. 
1763 
 
Persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism following surgery is indicative of 
1764 
inadequate surgery. As remedial thyroid surgery comes at significantly increased risk of 
1765 
hypoparathyroidism and RLN injury, it should be avoided, if possible, in favor of RAI 
1766 
therapy (290,291). If this is not an option, it is essential that the surgery be performed by 
1767 
a high-volume thyroid surgeon.

1769 
[M] If ATDs are chosen as treatment of TMNG or TA, how should the therapy be 
1770 
managed? 
1771 
  
ATDs do not induce remission in patients with nodular thyroid disease. Therefore, 
1772 
discontinuation of treatment results in relapse (262,297). However, prolonged (life-long) 
1773 
ATD therapy may be the best choice for some individuals with limited life-expectancy 
1774 
and increased surgical risk, including residents of nursing homes or other care facilities 
1775 
where compliance with radiation safety regulations may be difficult. 
1776 
■ RECOMMENDATION 56 
1777 
Long-term MMI treatment of TMNG or TA might be indicated in some elderly or 
1778 
otherwise ill patients with limited life-expectancy, in patients who are not good 
1779 
candidates for surgery or ablative therapy, and in patients who prefer this option.  
1780 
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1781 
 
1782 
 
Technical remarks: The required dose of MMI to restore the euthyroid state in 
1783 
TMNG or TA patients is usually low (5-10 mg/day). Because long-term, low-dose ATD 
1784 
treatment in nodular hyperthyroidism can be difficult to regulate, frequent (every 3 
1785 
months) monitoring is recommended initially, especially in the elderly (298), until 
1786 
stability has been documented after which testing frequency can be decreased.

1790 
■ RECOMMENDATION 57 
1791 
 Alternative therapies such as ethanol or radiofrequency ablation of TA and TMNG can 
1792 
be considered in select patients where RAI, surgery or long-term ATD are

[N1] Ethanol ablation 
1796 
 
Reports that support the efficacy of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) under 
1797 
sonographic guidance to treat TA and TMNG come largely from Europe (299-301).  
1798 
Experience in the United States is limited.  A typical protocol involves the injection of 
1799 
ethanol (average dose 10 ml, depending on size of the area to be ablated) into the TA or 
1800 
autonomous area of a TMNG.  In one study, the average patient required 4 sessions at 2 
1801 
week intervals (299). One hundred twenty-five patients with TA were followed for an 
1802 
average of 5 years; 2.4% refused further treatment due to pain, and 3.2% had 
1803 
complications including transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, abscess or hematoma 
1804 
(299).  Ninety-three percent of patients achieved a functional cure (no uptake on RAI 
1805 
scintigraphy), and 92% had a > 50% reduction in nodule size (299).  In another study of 
1806 
both TA and TMNG, 78 percent achieved a functional cure, all nodules regressed, and 
1807 
there was no recurrent hyperthyroidism during 5-years of follow-up (300).  Ethanol 
1808 
ablation also has been used following RAI to reduce nodule size (301). However, its use 
1809 
has been limited due to pain associated with extravasation of the ethanol to extranodular 
1810 
locations, and other adverse effects which have included transient thyrotoxicosis, 
1811 
permanent ipsilateral facial dysethesia, paranodular fibrosis interfering with subsequent 
1812 
surgery (302), and toxic necrosis of the larynx and adjacent skin (303). 
1813 
 [N2] Radiofrequency ablation 
1814 
 
Both radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and laser therapy have been used to treat 
1815 
thyroid nodules.  A meta-analysis demonstrated that RFA resulted in larger reductions in 
1816 
nodule size with fewer sessions than laser (304).  A retrospective multi-center report of 
1817 
RFA for TA in 44 patients utilized an 18 g electrode under ultrasound guidance with a 
1818 
mean follow-up of 20 months (305).  An 82% reduction in nodule volume was achieved, 
1819 
but 20% of nodules remained autonomous on scintigraphy, and 18% of patients remained 
1820 
hyperthyroid.  All patients complained of pain during the procedure, but there were no 
1821 
complications (305).   A Korean study compared the use of RFA to surgery for non-toxic 
1822 
nodules (306).  RFA was associated with an 85% reduction in nodule size, the cost was 
1823 
similar to surgery, there were fewer complications (recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or 
1824 
hypoparathyroidism: 6% for surgery and 1% for RFA), and no patient who received RFA 
1825 
became hypothyroid (306).  Advocates of RFA argue that it preserves normal thyroid 
1826 
function compared to surgery or RAI (307). However, additional data are needed to 
1827 
determine the success at correcting hyperthyroidism in patients with TA and TMNG. The 
1828 
use of RFA should be limited to centers where clinicians have received adequate training 
1829 
in the technique.

[O] How should GD be managed in children and adolescents? 
1832 
[O1] General approach 
1833 
■ RECOMMENDATION 58 
1834 
 Children with GD should be treated with MMI, RAI therapy, or thyroidectomy. RAI 
1835 
therapy should be avoided in very young children (<5 years). RAI therapy in children 
1836 
is acceptable if the activity is >150 µCi/g (5.55 MBq/g) of thyroid tissue, and for 
1837 
children between 5 and 10 years of age if the calculated RAI administered activity is 
1838 
<10 mCi (<473 MBq). Thyroidectomy should be chosen when definitive therapy is 
1839 
required, the child is too young for RAI, and surgery can be performed by a high-
1840 
volume thyroid surgeon. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1841 
 
The treatment of pediatric patients with GD varies considerably among 
1842 
institutions and practitioners. It is important to recognize that lasting remission after 
1843 
ATD therapy occurs in only a minority of pediatric patients with GD, including 
1844 
children treated with ATDs for many years. In determining the initial treatment 
1845 
approach, the patient’s age, clinical status, and likelihood of remission should be 
1846 
considered. Patient and parent values and preferences should also be strongly 
1847 
considered when choosing one of the three treatment modalities. 
1848 
 
Because some children will go into remission, MMI therapy for 1 year is still 
1849 
considered first-line treatment for most children. However, the majority of pediatric 
1850 
patients with GD will eventually require either RAI or surgery. When ATDs are used in 
1851 
children, only MMI should be used, except in exceptional circumstances. If clinical 
1852 
characteristics suggest a low chance of remission at initial presentation (see [P6] below) 
1853 
MMI, RAI, or surgery may be considered initially. If remission is not achieved after a 
1854 
course of therapy with ATDs, RAI or surgery should be considered. Alternatively, MMI 
1855 
 therapy may be continued long-term, or until the child is considered old enough for 
1856 
surgery or RAI. 
1857 
 
Properly administered, RAI is an effective treatment for GD in the pediatric 
1858 
population  (308-310). RAI is widely used in children, but still viewed as controversial by 
1859 
some practitioners owing primarily to concern over cancer risks (311,312). Although 
1860 
there are sparse clinical data relating to RAI use in children with GD and subsequent 
1861 
thyroid cancer (313), it is known that risks of thyroid cancer after external irradiation are 
1862 
highest in children <5 years of age, and they decline with advancing age (314,315); see 
1863 
discussion of RAI therapy and cancer risk in [P3] below. In comparison, activities of RAI 
1864 
used with contemporary therapy are not known to be associated with an increased risk of 
1865 
thyroid neoplasm in children. 
1866 
 
Thyroidectomy is an effective treatment for GD, but is associated with a higher 
1867 
complication rate in children than adults (316-318). Thyroidectomy should be performed 
1868 
in those children who are too young for RAI, provided that surgery can be performed by 
1869 
a high-volume thyroid surgeon, preferably with experience in conducting thyroidectomies 
1870 
in children. 
1871 
 
Technical remarks: There may be circumstances in which RAI therapy is 
1872 
indicated in young children, such as when a child has developed a reaction to ATDs, 
1873 
proper surgical expertise is not available, or the patient is not a suitable surgical 
1874 
candidate.

[P1] Initiation of ATD therapy for the treatment of GD in children 
1879 
■ RECOMMENDATION 59 
1880 
MMI should be used in children who are treated with ATD therapy. Strong 
1881 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
1882 
 
Technical remarks: MMI comes in 5 or 10 mg tablets and can be given once 
1883 
daily, even in patients with severe hyperthyroidism. Although many practitioners give 
1884 
MMI in divided doses, data in adults do not support a need for such and show that 
1885 
compliance with once-daily MMI therapy is superior to multiple daily doses of PTU 
1886 
(83% vs. 53%) (319). The MMI dose typically used is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily, with a range 
1887 
from 0.1–1.0 mg/kg daily (320-322). One approach is to prescribe the following whole 
1888 
tablet or quarter to half-tablet doses: infants, 1.25 mg/day; 1–5 years, 2.5–5.0 mg/day; 5–
1889 
10 years, 5–10 mg/day; and 10–18 years, 10–20 mg/day. With severe clinical or 
1890 
biochemical hyperthyroidism, doses that are 50–100% higher than the above can be used. 
1891 
 
Although there may be a tendency to use higher rather than lower doses of MMI 
1892 
at treatment onset, data in adults show only modest benefit of higher doses, and only in 
1893 
severe thyrotoxicosis (free T4 > 7 ng/dl (0.554 pmol/L)) (115).  Because most side effects 
1894 
of MMI are dose-related, and occur within the first 3 months of treatment (128), high 
1895 
doses of MMI (e.g., >30 mg for an adolescent or adult) should rarely be used initially. 
1896 
  
When thyroid hormone levels normalize, MMI doses can be reduced by 50% or 
1897 
more to maintain a euthyroid state (112). Alternatively, some physicians elect not to 
1898 
reduce the MMI dose and add levothyroxine to make the patient euthyroid, a practice 
1899 
referred to as ‘‘block and replace.’’ However, because meta-analyses suggest a higher 
1900 
prevalence of adverse events using block-and-replace regimens than dose titration 
1901 
(119,323), likely due to higher doses of MMI and the dose-related complications 
1902 
associated with MMI (324), we suggest that this practice be avoided. However, it may 
1903 
have utility in rare patients, after addressing compliance, who are inadequately 
1904 
controlled on one dose of MMI, then become hypothyroid after a minimal dose 
1905 
increase. 
1906 
 
Practitioners should also monitor the weight of children treated with ATDs.  
1907 
Excessive weight gain within 6 months of treatment is seen in children treated for GD, 
1908 
and the gain in weight can persist (325).  Parents and patients should be counseled about 
1909 
this possibility and nutrition consultation considered if excessive weight gain occurs. 
1910 
 
1911 
■ RECOMMENDATION 60 
1912 
Pediatric patients and their caretakers should be informed of side effects of ATD 
1913 
preferably in writing, and the necessity of stopping the medication immediately and 
1914 
informing their physician if they develop pruritic rash, jaundice, acolic stools or dark 
1915 
urine, arthralgias, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, fever, or pharyngitis. Strong 
1916 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1917 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 61 
1918 
Prior to initiating ATD therapy, we suggest that pediatric patients have, as a baseline, 
1919 
complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential, and a 
1920 
liver profile including bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase. Weak 
1921 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1922 
 
PTU is associated with an unacceptable risk of hepatotoxicity in children, with a 
1923 
risk of liver failure of 1 in 2000–4000 children taking the medication (326,327). PTU can 
1924 
cause fulminant hepatic necrosis that may be fatal; liver transplantation has been 
1925 
necessary in some patients taking PTU (326). It is for this reason that the FDA issued a 
1926 
black box warning regarding the use of PTU (328), noting that 32 (22 adult and 10 
1927 
pediatric) cases of serious liver injury have been associated with PTU use (326,328).  
1928 
Furthermore, since the recommendation was issued that PTU use in children be avoided, 
1929 
we are unaware of any published cases of PTU-related liver failure (327). 
1930 
 
Because PTU-induced liver injury is of rapid onset and can be rapidly 
1931 
progressive, biochemical monitoring of liver function tests and transaminase levels has 
1932 
not been shown to be useful in surveillance for PTU-related liver injury. When neither 
1933 
prompt surgery nor RAI therapy are options, and ATD therapy is necessary in a patient 
1934 
who has developed a minor toxic reaction to MMI, a short course of PTU use can be 
1935 
considered. When surgery is the planned therapy and MMI cannot be administered, if the 
1936 
patient is not too thyrotoxic (and the hyperthyroidism is due to GD), the hyperthyroid 
1937 
state can be controlled before surgery with beta blockade and SSKI (50 mg iodide/ drop) 
1938 
3–7 drops (0.15–0.35 mL) by mouth, given three times a day for 10 days before surgery.  
1939 
 Prior to surgery it is desirable to have the free T4, or total T4 and total T3 levels in the 
1940 
normal or subnormal range. Alternatively, if the surgery cannot be performed within a 
1941 
few weeks, a short course of PTU may be administered with the child closely monitored 
1942 
clinically for signs of hepatic dysfunction including nausea, anorexia, malaise and 
1943 
abdominal pain. 
1944 
 
MMI may also be associated with hepatotoxicity in children, but this tends to be 
1945 
milder and is typically cholestatic rather than hepatocellular (326).  There is at least one 
1946 
reported case of cholestatic jaundice in a child (326). However, there have been reports of 
1947 
hepatocellular toxicity with MMI in adults (134).   
1948 
 
MMI may also be associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) 
1949 
positive vasculitis (329), although this occurs far less frequently than with PTU.  Patients 
1950 
of Asian origin seem to be more susceptible to this adverse reaction, and it can develop 
1951 
after months to years of therapy.  Many PTU-treated patients also develop ANCA 
1952 
positivity on treatment, but remain asymptomatic (330).  Typical manifestations of 
1953 
ANCA positive vasculitis are: polyarthritis, purpuric skin lesions, and occasionally 
1954 
pulmonary and/or renal involvement.  Discontinuation of the drug generally results in 
1955 
resolution of the symptoms, but in more severe cases, glucocorticoids or other 
1956 
immunosuppressive therapy may be needed. 
1957 
 
Technical remarks: It is advisable to provide information concerning side effects 
1958 
of ATDs to the patient or caretaker in writing. See Recommendation 14 Technical 
1959 
remarks for a discussion regarding the utility of obtaining complete blood count and liver 
1960 
profile before initiating MMI therapy.

 [P2] Symptomatic management of Graves’ hyperthyroidism in children 
1962 
■ RECOMMENDATION 62 
1963 
Beta adrenergic blockade is recommended for children experiencing symptoms of 
1964 
hyperthyroidism, especially those with heart rates in excess of 100 beats per minute. 
1965 
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1966 
 
In children in whom the diagnosis of Graves’ hyperthyroidism is strongly 
1967 
suspected or confirmed, and who are showing significant symptoms, including, but not 
1968 
limited to, tachycardia, muscle weakness, tremor, or neuropsychological changes, 
1969 
treatment with atenolol, propranolol, metoprolol, or other beta-blockers leads to a 
1970 
decrease in heart rate and symptoms of GD. In those with reactive airway disease, cardio 
1971 
selective beta-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol can be used cautiously (331), with 
1972 
the patient monitored for exacerbation of asthma. 
1973 
[P3] Monitoring of children taking MMI 
1974 
 
After initiation of MMI therapy, thyroid function tests (free T4, total T3, TSH) are 
1975 
obtained at 2-6 weeks, the dose is adjusted if indictated, and thyroid function tests are 
1976 
measured again at 4-6 weeks, and then every 2–3 months once the dose is stablized. 
1977 
Depending on the severity of hyperthyroidism and the MMI dose, it can take several 
1978 
months for elevated thyroid hormone levels to fall into the normal range. Serum TSH 
1979 
may remain suppressed for several months after starting therapy and is therefore not a 
1980 
good parameter to monitor therapy early in the course.   
1981 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 63 
1982 
ATDs should be stopped immediately, and white blood counts measured in children 
1983 
who develop fever, arthralgias, mouth sores, pharyngitis, or malaise. Strong 
1984 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
1985 
 
Although MMI has a better overall safety profile than PTU, MMI is associated 
1986 
with minor adverse events that may affect up to 20% of children (332). MMI-related 
1987 
adverse events include allergic reactions, rashes, myalgias, and arthralgias (333,334), as 
1988 
well as hypothyroidism from overtreatment. Side effects from MMI usually occur within 
1989 
the first 3 months of starting therapy, but adverse events can occur later. In children, the 
1990 
risks of MMI-related cholestasis and hepatocellular injury appear to be much less than 
1991 
that observed in adults (326). 
1992 
 
Agranulocytosis has been reported in about 0.3% of adult patients taking MMI or 
1993 
PTU (128,324,335). Data on the prevalence of agranulocytosis in children are 
1994 
unavailable, but it is estimated to be very low. In adults, agranulocytosis is dose 
1995 
dependent with MMI, and rarely occurs at low doses (e.g., 5-10 mg/day) (128,324,335). 
1996 
When agranulocytosis develops, 95% of the time it occurs in the first 100 days of therapy 
1997 
(128,324,335).  The overall rate of side effects from ATDs (both major and minor) in 
1998 
children has been reported to be 6%–35% (332,334,336,337). 
1999 
 
Technical remarks: While routine monitoring of white blood counts may 
2000 
occasionally detect early agranulocytosis, it is not recommended because of the rarity of 
2001 
the condition and its sudden onset, which is generally symptomatic. It is for this reason 
2002 
 that measuring white cell counts during febrile illnesses and at the onset of pharyngitis 
2003 
has become the standard approach for monitoring. 
2004 
[P4] Monitoring of children taking PTU 
2005 
■ RECOMMENDATION 64 
2006 
In general, PTU should not be used in children.  But, if used the medication should be 
2007 
stopped immediately and liver function and hepatocellular integrity assessed in 
2008 
children who experience anorexia, pruritus, rash, jaundice, light-colored stool or dark 
2009 
urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea, or malaise. 
2010 
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2011 
 
Technical remarks: PTU should be discontinued if transaminase levels (obtained 
2012 
in symptomatic patients or found incidentally) reach 2–3 times the upper limit of normal. 
2013 
After discontinuing the drug, liver function tests (i.e., bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and 
2014 
transaminases) should be monitored weekly until there is evidence of resolution. If there 
2015 
is no evidence of resolution, referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist is warranted. 
2016 
[P5] Management of allergic reactions in children taking MMI 
2017 
■ RECOMMENDATION 65 
2018 
Persistent minor cutaneous reactions to MMI therapy in children should be managed 
2019 
by concurrent antihistamine treatment or cessation of the medication and changing to 
2020 
therapy with RAI or surgery. In the case of a serious adverse reaction to an ATD, 
2021 
 prescribing the other ATD is not recommended. Strong recommendation, low-
2022 
quality evidence. 
2023 
 
If children develop serious adverse reactions to MMI, RAI or surgery should be 
2024 
considered because the risks of PTU are viewed to be greater than the risks of radioactive 
2025 
iodine or surgery. In special circumstances, where the patient is viewed to be at risk for 
2026 
thyroid storm and ATD therapy is needed in a child with a serious adverse reaction to 
2027 
MMI, PTU may be considered for short-term therapy to control hyperthyroidism.  In this 
2028 
setting, families should be informed of the risks of PTU.

[P6] Duration of MMI therapy in children with GD 
2030 
■ RECOMMENDATION 66 
2031 
If MMI is chosen as the first-line treatment for GD in children, it may be tapered in 
2032 
those children requiring low doses after 1-2 years to determine if a spontaneous 
2033 
remission has occurred, or it may be continued until the child and caretakers are  
2034 
ready to consider definitive therapy, if needed. Strong recommendation, moderate-
2035 
quality evidence. 
2036 
 
The issue of how long ATDs should be used in children before considering either 
2037 
RAI or surgery is a topic of controversy and warrants further study. Prospective studies in 
2038 
adults show that if remission does not occur after 12–18 months of therapy, there is a 
2039 
lower chance of remission occurring with prolonged therapy (338). In children, when 
2040 
ATDs are used for 1–2 years, remission rates are generally 20%–30%, with remission 
2041 
defined as being euthyroid for 1 year after cessation of therapy (333,339,340). 
2042 
 Retrospective studies have suggested that the chance of remission after 2 years of ATDs 
2043 
is low if the thyroid gland is large (more than 2.5 times normal size for age), the child is 
2044 
young (<12 years) or not Caucasian, serum TRAb levels are above normal on therapy, or 
2045 
free T4 are substantially elevated at diagnosis (>4 ng/dL; 50 pmol/L) (339). One 
2046 
prospective study suggested that likelihood of remission could best be predicted by the 
2047 
initial response to ATDs, with achievement of euthyroid state within 3 months, 
2048 
suggesting higher likelihood. Younger children and those with high initial thyroid 
2049 
hormone levels were also found to be less likely to achieve remission within 2 years in 
2050 
the prospective studies (334,337). 
2051 
 
Remission rates in children treated with ATDs for longer than 2 years have been 
2052 
reported. Although two decades ago it was suggested that 25% of children with GD go 
2053 
into remission with every 2 years of continued treatment (341), other studies of larger 
2054 
cohorts of pediatric patients with GD treated with ATDs for extended periods have not 
2055 
revealed similar remission rates (333,339,342). Of 120 pediatric patients treated with 
2056 
ATDs at one center, after 1 year of therapy with ATDs, 25% were in remission; after 2 
2057 
years, 26%; after 4 years, 37%; and after 4–10 years, 15%. Importantly, 30% of the 
2058 
children who went into remission eventually relapsed (333). In another large cohort of 
2059 
184 medically treated children, after 1 year of therapy with ATDs, 10% were in 
2060 
remission; after 2 years, 14%; after 3 years, 20%; and after 4 years, 23% (339,342). 
2061 
 
More recently, in a retrospective analysis from Japan of 1,138 children, 723 were 
2062 
continued on long term ATD treatment, 271 underwent surgery or RAI, and 144 dropped 
2063 
out. Of the 639 patients of the 723 who discontinued ATD treatment, 46.2% achieved 
2064 
 remission, and 34.2% relapsed. The prevalence of adverse events associated with MMI 
2065 
and PTU were 21.4% and 18.8%, respectively (343).  
2066 
 
In comparison, other recent studies of long term remission rates of pediatric GD 
2067 
treated with ATDs are very low (<20%), especially with longer follow-up, in cohorts 
2068 
from Germany (344) and Denmark (345). 
2069 
 
Data also suggest that there are age-related differences in responsiveness to 
2070 
ATDs. In one study that compared outcomes of 32 prepubertal and 68 pubertal children, 
2071 
remission occurred in only 17% of prepubertal children treated 5.9±2.8 years, compared 
2072 
with 30% of pubertal individuals treated 2.8±1.1 years (340). In another report, the 
2073 
course of GD was compared in 7 prepubertal, 21 pubertal, and 12 postpubertal children 
2074 
(336). Remission was achieved in 10 patients (28%) with similar rates among the three 
2075 
groups, whereas the time to remission tended to be longer in the small proportion of 
2076 
prepubertal children (median age, 6 years) (336). 
2077 
 
Persistence of GD in children is correlated with the persistence of TRAbs. A 
2078 
recent study found that TRAb levels normalized after 24 months in only 18% of pediatric 
2079 
patients on ATDs (346). There were no data showing that there was normalization of 
2080 
TRAb levels when patients were on ATDs for a longer time. Therefore, it appears that 
2081 
TRAb levels persist longer in children than in adults (346). Whereas monitoring of TRAb 
2082 
levels while on ATDs has been shown to be useful in adult patients for predicting the 
2083 
likelihood of remission or relapse of GD after stopping the medication (172), this 
2084 
approach has yet to be validated in children. 
2085 
  
Whereas most studies, including recent large database reports (343), show that the 
2086 
vast majority of patients treated for GD with ATDs do not go into remission, a recent 
2087 
prospective report from France shows that with prolonged ATD use, remission rates of up 
2088 
to 49% could be achieved.  This study reported remision rates of 20%, 37%, 45%, and 
2089 
49% after 4, 6, 8, and 10 years follow-up of 154 children treated with ATDs (337).  The 
2090 
use of MMI in this group of children was associated with a very low rate of medication 
2091 
side-effects (337).  Thus, whereas many practitioners will treat for 1-2 years with MMI, 
2092 
these data suggest that treatment for longer periods is also reasonable, as long as side-
2093 
effects to medication do not occur. 
2094 
■ RECOMMENDATION 67 
2095 
Pediatric patients with GD who are not in remission following at least 1–2 years of 
2096 
MMI therapy should be considered for treatment with RAI or thyroidectomy. 
2097 
Alternatively, if children are tolerating ATD therapy, ATDs may be used for extended 
2098 
periods.  This approach may be especially useful for the child not considered to be a 
2099 
candidate for either surgery or RAI.  Individuals on prolonged ATDs therapy (>2 
2100 
years) should be reevaluated every 6-12 months and when transitioning to adulthood.  
2101 
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2102 
 
If remission is not achieved upon stopping MMI after at least 1 or 2 years of 
2103 
therapy, RAI or surgery should be considered, depending on the age of the child. 
2104 
Alternatively, practitioners can continue MMI for extended periods, as long as adverse 
2105 
drug effects do not occur and the hyperthyroid state is controlled.  As noted above, 
2106 
adverse reactions typically occur within the first few months of therapy.

2111 
■ RECOMMENDATION 68 
2112 
We suggest that children with GD having total T4 levels of >20 ug/dL (260 nmol/L) or 
2113 
free T4 >5 ng/dL (60 pmol/L) who are to receive RAI therapy be pretreated with MMI 
2114 
and beta-adrenergic blockade until total T4 and/or free T4 normalize before proceeding 
2115 
with RAI treatment. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2116 
 
Although the frequency of short-term worsening of hyperthyroidism following 
2117 
pretreatment with ATD therapy is not known, there are rare reports of pediatric patients 
2118 
with severe hyperthyroidism who have developed thyroid storm after receiving RAI 
2119 
(347,348).  
2120 
 
Technical remarks: When children receiving MMI are to be treated with RAI, the 
2121 
medication should be stopped 2-3 days before treatment (349). At that time patients 
2122 
should be placed on beta-blockers (if not already taking) until total T4 and/or free T4 
2123 
levels normalize following RAI therapy, which generally takes 2-4 months. Although 
2124 
some physicians restart ATDs after treatment with RAI (80), this practice is seldom 
2125 
required in children (309,310,350). Thyroid hormone levels in children begin to fall 
2126 
within the first week following RAI therapy. ATDs can complicate assessment of post-
2127 
 treatment hypothyroidism, since it could be the result of the MMI rather than the RAI 
2128 
therapy. 
2129 
[Q2] Administration of RAI in the treatment of GD in children 
2130 
■ RECOMMENDATION 69 
2131 
If RAI therapy is chosen as treatment for GD in children, sufficient RAI should be 
2132 
administered in a single dose to render the patient hypothyroid. Strong 
2133 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
2134 
 
The goal of RAI therapy for GD is to induce hypothyroidism, rather than 
2135 
euthyroidism, as lower administered activities of RAI result in residual, partially 
2136 
irradiated thyroid tissue that is at increased risk for thyroid neoplasm development (351). 
2137 
Because of an increased risk of thyroid nodules and cancer associated with low-level 
2138 
thyroid irradiation in children (314,352-354), and poor remission rates with low-
2139 
administered activities of RAI (88-90), it is important that RAI activities >150 µCi (> 
2140 
5.55 MBq/g) rather than smaller activities of RAI be administered to achieve 
2141 
hypothyroidism (312). With large glands (50–80 g), RAI activities of 131I 200–300 µCi/g 
2142 
(7.4-11.1 MBq/g) may be needed (349). The administered activity of RAI to patients with 
2143 
very large goiters is high, and there is a tendency to underestimate the size of the gland 
2144 
(and thereby administer insufficient RAI activities to these patients) (90). Therefore, 
2145 
surgery may be preferable to RAI in children with goiters larger than 80 g. 
2146 
 
Physicians at some centers administer a fixed dose of about 15 mCi RAI to all 
2147 
children (350), whereas others calculate the activity from estimation or direct 
2148 
 measurement of gland size and 123I uptake (349). To assess thyroid size, particularly in 
2149 
the setting of a large gland, ultrasonography is recommended (355). There are no data 
2150 
comparing outcomes of fixed versus calculated activities in children; in adults, similar 
2151 
outcomes have been reported with the two approaches (356). One potential advantage of 
2152 
calculated versus fixed dosing is that it may be possible to use lower administered 
2153 
activities of RAI, especially when uptake is high and the thyroid is small. Calculated 
2154 
dosing also will help assure that an adequate administered activity is given. 
2155 
 
When RAI activities >150 µCi/g (>5.55 MBq/g) are administered, 
2156 
hypothyroidism rates are about 95% (88,339,349). While there are reports that 
2157 
hyperthyroidism can relapse in pediatric patients rendered hypothyroid with RAI, this is 
2158 
very infrequent. 
2159 
 
Technical remarks: RAI is excreted by saliva, urine, perspiration, tears, and 
2160 
stool. Significant radioactivity is retained within the thyroid for several days. It is 
2161 
therefore important that patients and families be informed of and adhere to local radiation 
2162 
safety recommendations following RAI therapy. After RAI therapy, T3, T4, and/or free T4 
2163 
levels should be obtained every month. Because TSH levels may remain suppressed for 
2164 
several months after correction of the hyperthyroid state, TSH determinations may not be 
2165 
useful in this setting for assessing hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism typically develops by 
2166 
2–3 months post-treatment (333,349,350), at which time levothyroxine should be 
2167 
prescribed. 
2168 
[Q3] Side-effects of RAI therapy in children 
2169 
  
Side effects of RAI therapy in children are uncommon apart from the lifelong 
2170 
hypothyroidism that is the goal of therapy.  Fewer than 10% of children complain of mild 
2171 
tenderness over the thyroid in the first week after therapy; it can be treated effectively 
2172 
with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for 24–48 hours (310,349). 
2173 
 
If there is residual thyroid tissue in young children after RAI treatment, there is a 
2174 
theoretical risk of development of thyroid cancer. Detractors of the use of RAI therapy in 
2175 
children point to the increased rates of thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules observed in 
2176 
young children exposed to radiation from nuclear fallout at Hiroshima or after the 
2177 
Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion. However, these data do not apply directly when 
2178 
assessing risks of RAI therapy. The risk of thyroid neoplasia is greatest with exposure to 
2179 
low-level external radiation (0.1–25 Gy; ~ 0.09–30 µCi/g or 3.33-1110 Bq/g) 
2180 
(314,315,352,354,357), not with the higher administered activities used to treat GD. It is 
2181 
also important to note that iodine deficiency and exposure to radionuclides other than 
2182 
RAI may have contributed to the increased risk of thyroid cancer in young children after 
2183 
the Chernobyl reactor explosion (315). Notably, thyroid cancer rates were not increased 
2184 
among 3,000 children exposed to RAI from the Hanford nuclear reactor site in an iodine-
2185 
replete region (358). Increased thyroid cancer rates also were not seen in 6,000 children 
2186 
who received RAI for the purpose of diagnostic scanning (359). 
2187 
 
There is no evidence to suggest that children or adults treated for GD with more 
2188 
than 150 µCi/g (5.55 MBq/g) of RAI have an increased risk of thyroid cancer directly 
2189 
attributable to RAI. While there are several studies of this issue in adults treated with RAI 
2190 
 for GD (see section [D2]), few studies have focused on populations exposed to RAI for 
2191 
the treatment of GD in childhood or adolescence. 
2192 
 
In one study, an analysis was carried out of 602 individuals exposed to RAI below 
2193 
20 years of age in Swedish and U.S. populations (360). The average follow-up period 
2194 
was 10 years, and the mean administered activity of RAI to the thyroid was 88 Gy 
2195 
(approximately 80 µCi/g or 2.96 MBq/g equivalent), an activity known to be associated 
2196 
with thyroid neoplasia and below that recommended for treatment of GD. Two cases of 
2197 
thyroid cancer were reported compared to 0.1 cases expected over that period of time. 
2198 
Effects on the development of nonthyroid cancers were not examined. 
2199 
 
The pediatric study with the longest follow-up reported 36-year outcomes of 116 
2200 
patients, treated with RAI between 1953 and 1973 (100). The patients ranged in age at 
2201 
treatment from 3 to 19 years. No patient developed thyroid cancer or leukemia. There 
2202 
was no increase in the rate of spontaneous abortion or in the number of congenital 
2203 
anomalies in offspring. It is important to note that sample size was small; thus, the 
2204 
statistical power was inadequate to address this issue fully. 
2205 
 
Total body radiation dose after RAI varies with age, and the same absolute 
2206 
activities of RAI will result in more radiation exposure to a young child than to an 
2207 
adolescent or adult (361). At present, we do not have dosimetry information regarding 
2208 
RAI use in children with GD to assess total body exposure in children. Using phantom 
2209 
modeling, it has been estimated that at 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15 years of age, and adulthood, 
2210 
respective total body radiation activities are 11.1, 4.6, 2.4, 1.45, 0.90, and 0.85 rem (1 
2211 
rem = 0.1 Sv) per mCi of RAI administered (361). Based on the Biological Effects of 
2212 
 Ionizing Radiation Committee VII analysis of acute, low-level radiation exposure (362) , 
2213 
the theoretical lifetime attributable risk of all-cancer incidence and all-cancer mortality 
2214 
for a large population of treated children can be estimated (Table 9). 
2215 
 
To date, long-term studies of children treated with RAI for GD have not revealed 
2216 
an increased risk of nonthyroid malignancies. If a small risk exists, a sample size of more 
2217 
than 10,000 children who were treated at <10 years of age would be needed to identify 
2218 
the risk, likely exceeding the number of such treated children. Based on cancer risk 
2219 
projections from estimated whole-body, low-level radiation exposure as related to age, it 
2220 
is theoretically possible that there may be a low risk of malignancies in very young 
2221 
children treated with RAI. Thus, we recommended above that RAI therapy be avoided in 
2222 
very young children (<5 years) and that RAI be considered in those children between 5 
2223 
and 10 years of age when the required activity for treatment is <10 mCi (<370 MBq). It is 
2224 
important to emphasize that these recommendations are based on theoretical concerns 
2225 
and further direct study of this issue is needed. The theoretical risks of RAI use must 
2226 
therefore be weighed against the known risks inherent in thyroidectomy or prolonged 
2227 
ATD use when choosing among the three different treatment options for GD in the 
2228 
pediatric age group. 
2229 
 
The activity of RAI administered should be based on thyroid size and uptake, and 
2230 
not arbitrarily reduced because of age in young individuals. Attempts to minimize the 
2231 
RAI activity will result in undertreatment and the possible need for additional RAI 
2232 
therapy and radiation exposure.

2236 
[R1] Preparation of children with GD for thyroidectomy 
2237 
■ RECOMMENDATION 70 
2238 
Children with GD undergoing thyroidectomy should be rendered euthyroid with the 
2239 
use of MMI. A potassium iodide containing preparation should be given in the 
2240 
immediate preoperative period. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2241 
 
Surgery is an acceptable form of therapy for GD in children. Thyroidectomy is the 
2242 
preferred treatment for GD in young children (<5 years) when definitive therapy is 
2243 
required, and the surgery can be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. In 
2244 
individuals with large thyroid glands (>80 g), the response to RAI may be poor (88,90) 
2245 
and surgery also may be preferable for these patients. When performed, near-total or total 
2246 
thyroidectomy is the recommended procedure (363). 
2247 
 
Technical remarks: MMI is typically given for 1–2 months in preparation for 
2248 
thyroidectomy. Potassium iodide (50 mg iodide/drop) can be given as 1-2 drops (i.e., 
2249 
0.05–0.1 mL) three times daily for 10 days before surgery.  SSKI can be mixed in juice or 
2250 
milk. 
2251 
■ RECOMMENDATION 71 
2252 
If surgery is chosen as therapy for GD in children, total or near-total thyroidectomy 
2253 
should be performed. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
2254 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 72 
2255 
Thyroidectomy in children should be performed by high-volume thyroid surgeons. 
2256 
Strong recommendation, moderately-quality evidence. 
2257 
 
Surgical complication rates are higher in children than in adults, with higher rates 
2258 
in younger than in older children (316,318). Postoperatively, younger children also 
2259 
appear to be at higher risk for transient hypoparathyroidism than adolescents or adults 
2260 
(316,318).   
2261 
 
Post-operative hypocalcemia requiring intravenous calcium infusions appears to 
2262 
occur more frequently than in in adults.  Data from one center suggests that if calcitriol is 
2263 
started three days before surgery (0.25 or 0.5 mcg, bid), the need for post-operative 
2264 
calcium infusions is markedly reduced, leading to reduction in the length of stay (318).  
2265 
The calcitriol is then weaned over the first two post-operative weeks (318). 
2266 
 
In addition, complication rates are twofold higher when thyroidectomy is 
2267 
performed by pediatric or general surgeons who do not have extensive current experience 
2268 
in this procedure than when performed by high-volume thyroid surgeons (316). Further 
2269 
support for the notion that thyroidectomy for GD in children should be performed by 
2270 
experienced thyroid surgeons comes from reports of institutional experience showing low 
2271 
complication rates at high-volume centers (318,364). In circumstances where local 
2272 
pediatric thyroid surgery expertise is not available, referral of a child with GD to a high-
2273 
volume thyroid surgery center that also has pediatric experience is indicated, especially 
2274 
 for young children. A multidisciplinary health-care team that includes pediatric 
2275 
endocrinologists and experienced thyroid surgeons and anesthesiologists is optimal. 
2276 
 
2277 
[S] How should subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) be managed? 
2278 
[S1] Prevalence and causes of SH 
2279 
 
The prevalence of SH in an adult population depends on age, gender, and iodine 
2280 
intake.  In a representative sample of U.S. subjects without known thyroid disease, 0.7% 
2281 
had suppressed TSH levels (< 0.1 mU/L), and 1.8% had low TSH levels (< 0.4 mU/L) 
2282 
(365).  Similar rates have been reported in studies from Europe, with higher levels in 
2283 
women and older subjects (366,367).  The differential diagnosis of an isolated low or 
2284 
suppressed TSH level includes exogenous thyroid hormone use, nonthyroidal illness, 
2285 
drug effects, and pituitary/hypothalamic disease, all of which need to be ruled out before 
2286 
the diagnosis of SH can be established in a patient with an isolated low or suppressed 
2287 
TSH level.  In addition, mean serum TSH levels are lower in black non-Hispanic 
2288 
Americans, some of whom may have slightly low TSH levels without thyroid disease 
2289 
(365).  Finally, some otherwise healthy older persons may have low serum TSH levels, 
2290 
low normal serum levels of free T4 and total T3, and no evidence of thyroid or pituitary 
2291 
disease, suggesting an altered set point of the pituitary-thyroid axis (368,369). 
2292 
 
The natural history of SH is variable (367,370-377), with annualized rates of 0.5 – 
2293 
7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5 – 12% reversion to normal TSH levels.  
2294 
In one study (372), 51.2% of patients had spontaneously developed a normal TSH when 
2295 
 first checked at some time within 5 years (mean time to repeat TSH 13 months).  
2296 
Progression from SH to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely if the TSH is 
2297 
suppressed (< 0.01 mU/L), rather than low but detectable (0.01 – 0.4 mU/L) (375-377).  
2298 
Patients with GD rather than a TMNG as the cause of SH may be more likely to 
2299 
spontaneously remit (367,378).  In patients at high risk of complications from SH, TSH 
2300 
and free T4 should be repeated within 2-6 weeks.  For all other patients, it is important to 
2301 
document that SH is a persistent problem by repeating the serum TSH at 3-6 months, 
2302 
prior to initiating therapy. In clinical series, TMNG is the most common cause of SH, 
2303 
especially in older persons (367,376,377).  The second most common cause of SH is GD, 
2304 
which is more prevalent in younger persons, and is also common in patients who 
2305 
previously received ATD therapy.  Other unusual causes include solitary autonomously 
2306 
functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis, the latter of which would be more 
2307 
strictly termed ‘‘subclinical thyrotoxicosis.’’ 
2308 
[S2] Clinical significance of SH 
2309 
 
Since SH is a mild form of hyperthyroidism, it is not surprising that deleterious 
2310 
effects seen in overt hyperthyroidism might also occur in SH.  There have been a large 
2311 
number of recent studies elucidating these effects: 
2312 
1. Overall mortality.  A number of longitudinal studies have examined correlations 
2313 
between SH and overall mortality, with variable results.  Some studies report 
2314 
increased overall mortality rates in SH subjects (374,379-383), especially older 
2315 
subjects, while others indicate no relation (384-387).  Limitations of some of 
2316 
these studies include sample sizes, age ranges, length of follow-up, and diagnosis 
2317 
 of SH by a single TSH measurement.  A recent meta-analysis of individual-level 
2318 
data from 52,674 participants, pooled from 10 cohorts and providing greater 
2319 
power, concluded that SH confers a 24% increased risk of overall mortality 
2320 
(388). 
2321 
2. Cardiovascular disease.  A recent large study of 26,707 people followed for 12 
2322 
years reported increased cardiovascular mortality with SH (389).  Some other, 
2323 
smaller studies have reached similar conclusions (374,383), although other 
2324 
smaller studies have failed to find a correlation (380,381,384,386).  There have 
2325 
been two recent meta-analyses that examined this question, one of study-level 
2326 
data of 17 cohorts (390) and the other of individual-level data in 52,674 
2327 
participants (388).  Both analyses concluded that SH confers an increased risk of 
2328 
cardiovascular mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.52 (390) and 1.29 (388).  In the 
2329 
individual-level meta-analysis, relative risks did not differ based on age, gender, 
2330 
pre-existing cardiovascular disease, or the presence of cardiovascular risk 
2331 
factors.  However, the risk was greater in subjects with TSH levels < 0.1 
2332 
compared to those with TSH levels 0.1 – 0.4 mU/L. 
2333 
 
Some of these studies, including the meta-analyses, have also examined 
2334 
non-fatal cardiovascular events in SH, with similar increased risks 
2335 
(383,388,390,391).  The most recent data indicate that SH subjects appear to be at 
2336 
particular risk for the development of heart failure (381,388,392), especially older 
2337 
subjects (381,392) and those with lower TSH levels (392).  Mechanistic correlates 
2338 
of these findings include increased left ventricular (LV) mass and impaired LV 
2339 
function in SH that improve with treatment (393-396).  In addition, two studies 
2340 
 have shown impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity in SH, 
2341 
suggesting this may contribute to increased cardiovascular risk (397,398). 
2342 
 
Arrhythmias are another concern in SH.  Sawin et al first reported a 2.8-
2343 
fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation in SH subjects over age 60 years in 1994 
2344 
(399), and subsequent studies have confirmed that the risk of arrhythmias, 
2345 
particularly atrial fibrillation, is increased in SH (381,384,388,391,400,401). In 
2346 
the largest study to date (586,460 people followed for a median of 5.5 years), the 
2347 
highest relative risk for atrial fibrillation occurred in younger subjects, possibly 
2348 
because other causes predominate with age, and in subjects with lower TSH levels 
2349 
(401).  However, absolute incidence rates of atrial fibrillation were much lower in 
2350 
younger subjects:  for example, women under the age of 65 years had atrial 
2351 
fibrillation incidence rates of 2.3 events per 1,000 person-years (relative risk of 
2352 
1.89 compared to age-matched euthyroid women), while women 65 years and 
2353 
older had incidence rates of 22.7 per 1,000 person-years (relative risk of 1.27 
2354 
compared to age-matched euthyroid women).  Similar trends were seen for men.  
2355 
A further population-based study found that SH increased the risk for stroke in 
2356 
subjects over age 50 years with a hazard ratio of 3.39 (402), although a recent 
2357 
meta-analysis of stroke risk in SH found insufficient number of events to draw 
2358 
definitive conclusions (403).  Complementing these epidemiologic studies, 
2359 
investigations of smaller numbers of subjects with SH have revealed increased 
2360 
heart rate at rest and during exercise, decreased heart rate variability, and 
2361 
increased frequency of atrial and ventricular premature beats, which improve with 
2362 
treatment of SH (393,394,404,405).   
2363 
  
Taken together, these data provide a strong argument for the treatment of 
2364 
SH in older subjects to avoid dysrhythmias and possible subsequent stroke.  
2365 
Whether younger patients should be treated for the same preventive indications is 
2366 
less clear.  The most recent data provide evidence that relative risks of 
2367 
cardiovascular mortality and atrial fibrillation are elevated in younger, as well as 
2368 
older, patients with SH.  However, the absolute risks of these events are very low 
2369 
in younger patients, so the risk/benefit ratio of treating younger SH patients is not 
2370 
clear. Clinical judgement should be used in these cases, and treatment decisions 
2371 
individualized. 
2372 
3. Osteoporosis and fractures.  Most studies of endogenous SH show decreased 
2373 
bone mineral density in post-menopausal women, but not in men or pre-
2374 
menopausal women (406).  However, it is not clear that this translates to 
2375 
increased fracture risk.  A number of population-based studies have reported that 
2376 
certain groups of subjects with SH have increased fracture rates, including all 
2377 
adults (407), postmenopausal women (408), men (409), or subjects who progress 
2378 
to overt hyperthyroidism over time (391).  The most recent and by far the largest 
2379 
individual study to date (231,355 people) reported a hazard rate for all major 
2380 
osteoporotic fractures combined (hip, humerus, forearm, spine) of 1.13 
2381 
(confidence intervals 1.014-1.26).  Risk increased with duration of SH, such that 
2382 
after a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 13.5% of subjects with a low TSH level 
2383 
had experienced at least one major osteoporotic fracture, compared to 6.9% of 
2384 
subjects with a normal TSH level (407).    Other studies have not found increased 
2385 
fracture rates in SH subjects (410-412).  A recent participant-level meta-analysis 
2386 
 of 13 cohorts (70,298 participants, median follow-up of 12.1 years) concluded 
2387 
that SH subjects had significantly elevated hazard ratios of 1.36 for hip fractures 
2388 
(6 vs. 4.9 fractures per 1,000 person-years) and 1.28 for any fractures (14.4 vs 
2389 
11.2 fractures per 1,000 person-years) (413).  Risks were further increased if 
2390 
TSH levels were < 0.1, compared to 0.1 – 0.44 mU/L, and if SH was due to 
2391 
endogenous etiologies, rather than thyroid hormone administration.  Risks did 
2392 
not differ when stratified by age, although absolute fracture rates were lower in 
2393 
younger subjects.  There are smaller, nonrandomized trials that have shown 
2394 
improvement in bone mineral density with therapy of SH with antithyroid drugs 
2395 
or radioactive iodine (414-417).   
2396 
4. 
Mood and cognition.  A large body of literature has investigated possible 
2397 
correlations between SH and cognitive decline (reviewed in (418), more recent 
2398 
studies (419,420)).  Approximately equal numbers of studies report significant 
2399 
associations between SH and measures of cognitive decline and the development 
2400 
of dementia, vs. no associations.  Therefore, at this time, no conclusions 
2401 
regarding this issue can be reached.  There appears to be no correlation between 
2402 
SH and depression (421-423). 
2403 
5. 
Physical functioning.  Four studies have investigated whether SH is 
2404 
associated with self-reported functional capacity or objective measures of 
2405 
physical functioning (420,423-425).  Three could find no correlation, while the 
2406 
fourth found a correlation between SH and lower physical performance in men 
2407 
only (425).   Another uncontrolled study showed an increase in muscle mass and 
2408 
 muscle strength in middle-aged women with SH after treatment with RAI or 
2409 
thyroidectomy (426).  
2410 
  [S3] When to treat SH 
2411 
■ RECOMMENDATION 73 
2412 
When TSH is persistently <0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH is recommended in all 
2413 
individuals ≥ 65 years of age; in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or 
2414 
osteoporosis; in postmenopausal women who are not on estrogens or bisphosphonates; 
2415 
and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms. Strong recommendation, moderate-
2416 
quality evidence. 
2417 
■ RECOMMENDATION 74 
2418 
When TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH should be considered in 
2419 
asymptomatic individuals < 65 years of age without the risk factors listed in 
2420 
recommendation 73.  Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
2421 
 
Treatment of SH is controversial, since few intervention studies to show benefit 
2422 
have been performed, especially for clinically important endpoints such as cardiovascular 
2423 
events, atrial fibrillation, and fractures. Additionally, none of these studies included a 
2424 
control arm.  Thus the evidence rests only with small uncontrolled studies that have 
2425 
shown improvements in cardiac structure and function, heart rate and the frequency of 
2426 
premature atrial and ventricular beats, bone mineral density, and muscle strength (393-
2427 
396,405,414-417,426). In 2004, a panel of experts determined that the evidence for 
2428 
 benefit was sufficient to warrant therapy of SH in older individuals whose serum TSH 
2429 
level was <0.1 mU/L (427). This was based primarily on the studies showing an 
2430 
increased rate of atrial fibrillation and altered skeletal health with a suppressed level of 
2431 
TSH described above.  Emerging epidemiologic data since then on risks for overall and 
2432 
cardiovascular-specific mortality, summarized above, have strengthened this argument, 
2433 
even in the absence of interventional data. The European Thyroid Association recently 
2434 
reviewed these data and published guidelines for the treatment of subclinical 
2435 
hyperthyroidism which are largely concordant with recommendations presented here 
2436 
(428). 
2437 
 
There are insufficient data for or against treatment of SH in younger persons or 
2438 
premenopausal women with SH and serum TSH <0.1 mU/L. One uncontrolled study of 
2439 
middle-aged patients showed an improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with therapy 
2440 
(393). Although this study did not include younger individuals, the task force elected to 
2441 
recommend treatment of SH patients younger than 65 years of age with persistent TSH 
2442 
<0.1 mU/L and hyperthyroid symptoms.  In the absence of symptoms or risk factors, 
2443 
treatment decisions must be individualized.  
2444 
 
Technical remarks: A TSH level of <0.1 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 
2445 
3–6-month period is considered to be persistent, effectively ruling out transient thyroiditis 
2446 
as a cause. The thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed, and is most 
2447 
commonly TMNG, GD, or TA. 
2448 
■ RECOMMENDATION 75 
2449 
 When TSH is persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L, treatment 
2450 
of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with 
2451 
cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  Weak 
2452 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
2453 
■ RECOMMENDATION 76 
2454 
When TSH is persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L, 
2455 
asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis can be 
2456 
observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or 
2457 
treatment.  Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2458 
 
A number of the epidemiologic studies listed above performed analyses for SH 
2459 
subjects with low but detectable TSH levels (generally 0.1 to 0.4 mU/L).  Some of these 
2460 
studies reported increased risks of overall mortality in older subjects (380,429), 
2461 
cardiovascular events (391), heart failure (381), and atrial fibrillation in all subjects (401) 
2462 
or in older subjects (384), and vertebral fractures in older women (408). However, there 
2463 
are no interventional data for or against treatment of individuals with serum TSH levels 
2464 
between 0.1 and the lower limit of the reference range. Therefore, treatment decisions 
2465 
must be individualized, based on the limited epidemiologic evidence and patient risk 
2466 
factors.  The task force felt that the limited data are stronger for older subjects, and 
2467 
therefore treatment should be considered for older subjects, but is not recommended for 
2468 
subjects < 65 years of age.  However, younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6-
2469 
12 month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases 
2470 
 to < 0.1 mU/L.  In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of beta-adrenergic 
2471 
blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice. 
2472 
 
Technical remarks: A TSH level between 0.1 and 0.4 mU/L on repeated 
2473 
measurement over a 3–6-month period is considered persistent, effectively ruling out 
2474 
transient thyroiditis as a cause. The thyroid disorder underlying SH with TSH persistently 
2475 
within this range should be diagnosed before considering treatment to avoid treating 
2476 
patients with transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other 
2477 
causes of low TSH. A summary of factors to consider when deciding whether or not to 
2478 
treat a patient with SH is provided (Table 10). 
2479 
[S4] How to treat SH 
2480 
■ RECOMMENDATION 77 
2481 
If SH is to be treated, the treatment should be based on the etiology of the thyroid 
2482 
dysfunction and follow the same principles as outlined for the treatment of overt 
2483 
hyperthyroidism. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2484 
 
The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism.  
2485 
• RAI is appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG 
2486 
is a frequent cause of SH. There are no data to inform whether elderly patients 
2487 
with SH would benefit from pretreatment with ATDs to normalize thyroid 
2488 
function before RAI therapy. Given the low risk of exacerbation (71), the risks 
2489 
of ATD therapy may outweigh any potential small benefit.  
2490 
 • A course of ATD therapy is a reasonable alternative to RAI in patients with 
2491 
GD and SH, especially in younger patients, since remission rates are highest 
2492 
in persons with mild disease (109).  
2493 
• Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously without therapy 
2494 
(375-377), so that continued observation without therapy is reasonable for 
2495 
younger patients with SH due to GD. A small subset of elderly patients with 
2496 
persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be 
2497 
followed without intervention, especially when the serum free T4 and total T3 
2498 
levels are in the lower half of the normal range. Treatment with beta-
2499 
adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control the cardiovascular-related 
2500 
morbidity from SH, especially that of atrial fibrillation (430). 
2501 
 
Technical remarks: Some patients with SH due to mild GD may remit 
2502 
spontaneously and may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3-6 months) 
2503 
monitoring of thyroid function. In select patients with SH due to TMNG who have 
2504 
compressive symptoms, or in whom there is concern for malignancy, surgery is also an 
2505 
option. 
2506 
[S5] End points to be assessed to determine effective therapy of SH 
2507 
 
The goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. 
2508 
Since the rationale for therapy of SH is to a large degree preventive, there are few end 
2509 
points that can be used to document that therapy has been successful.    Based on the 
2510 
original indication for treatment, it is reasonable to follow hyperthyroid symptoms or 
2511 
 bone density (393,414-416); otherwise, the major end point is a TSH level within the age-
2512 
adjusted reference range. 
2513 
 
2514 
[T] How should hyperthyroidism in pregnancy be managed? 
2515 
 
Normal pregnancy leads to changes in thyroid physiology that are reflected by 
2516 
altered thyroid function testing. In early pregnancy, these changes can mimic biochemical 
2517 
hyperthyroidism that does not require therapy (431). Hyperthyroidism due to GD occurs 
2518 
in 0.5-1.0 % of women in the reproductive age range (432), and 0.1-0.2 % of them are 
2519 
treated with ATD during pregnancy (433,434). Both the thyrotoxicosis and therapy of the 
2520 
disease may seriously complicate the course and outcome of pregnancy. In these 
2521 
guidelines, we will address only the most common issues related to hyperthyroidism in 
2522 
pregnancy, pending full guidelines on thyroid disease and pregnancy that are currently 
2523 
being updated by the ATA. 
2524 
[T1] Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy 
2525 
■ RECOMMENDATION 78 
2526 
The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy should be made using serum TSH 
2527 
values, and either total T4 and T3 with total T4 and T3 reference ranges increasing to 
2528 
1.5 times above the nonpregnant range by the 2nd and 3rd trimester or free T4 and total 
2529 
T3 estimations with trimester-specific normal reference ranges. Strong 
2530 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2531 
  
The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy can be challenging. In the vast 
2532 
majority of patients, the disease is caused by a primary thyroid abnormality, and the 
2533 
principal finding will be a suppressed serum TSH, with serum free T4  (or total T4) and/or 
2534 
T3 levels above the reference range (overt hyperthyroidism), or within the reference range 
2535 
(SH). A key point is that reference ranges for thyroid function tests are different during 
2536 
different stages of pregnancy, and these changes may be assay-dependent.  
2537 
 
An understanding of pregnancy-related variations in thyroid function tests is 
2538 
important in making the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Serum TSH levels 
2539 
may be below the non-pregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term 
2540 
pregnancy (435,436), and especially so in gestational weeks 9-13, where a subset of 
2541 
pregnant women may develop suppressed serum TSH (437-439). The decrease in TSH in 
2542 
early pregnancy is the result of stimulation of the normal thyroid by high levels of serum 
2543 
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (440), and occasionally the biochemical findings 
2544 
developing may correspond to overt thyrotoxicosis (gestational hyperthyroidism 
2545 
discussed below). However, low serum TSH levels with normal free T4 (or total T4) in 
2546 
early pregnancy do not indicate disease in need of therapy. During the second half of 
2547 
pregnancy, the lower limit of normal for TSH in the non-pregnant population can be used 
2548 
(441). 
2549 
 
Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysate or an ultrafiltrate of serum 
2550 
around week 10 of pregnancy may be slightly higher (5–10%) than non-pregnancy 
2551 
values, corresponding to the period of high serum hCG and low serum TSH. From 
2552 
 normal or slightly elevated levels, a gradual decrease occurs during pregnancy, and late 
2553 
third trimester reference values are 10–30% below non-pregnancy values (442). 
2554 
 
Serum total T4 and T3 increase in parallel in early pregnancy, primarily due to 
2555 
increases in TBG. In one longitudinal study, the increase in T4 and T3 reference ranges 
2556 
were observed to occur at a rate of 5% of non-pregnant values per week over the 10 week 
2557 
period of gestation weeks 7-16 (443). After this 50% increase, total T4 and T3 values 
2558 
remain stable with reference range limits 1.5 times above non-pregnancy ranges over the 
2559 
remaining weeks of pregnancy (442,443). Total T4 and T3 values may be combined with 
2560 
a T3 uptake test or measurements of TBG to adjust for pregnancy-associated variations in 
2561 
TBG. Such ‘‘free T4 index’’ or ‘‘TBG adjusted T4’’ values may be useful for diagnosing 
2562 
hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, however, trimester-specific normal reference ranges 
2563 
should be established for each individual test and assay used. In the absence of these, 
2564 
consideration should be given to utilizing total T4 and T3 levels and multiply the non-
2565 
pregnancy reference range by 1.5 after week 16, as discussed above.  
2566 
 
Excluding patients with TSH suppression or gestational thyrotoxicosis 
2567 
during the first trimester, GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism during 
2568 
pregnancy (431,444); nodular thyroid disease is less common. Hyperthyroidism caused 
2569 
by a hCG-producing molar pregnancy or a choriocarcinoma presents with a diffuse 
2570 
hyperactive thyroid similar to GD, but without eye signs and without TRAb being 
2571 
detectable in serum. In these patients, serum hCG will be higher than expected, and the 
2572 
cause can be identified by obstetrical investigation. 
2573 
  
Technical remarks: The reliability of automated analog-based assays for free T4 
2574 
and free T3 has been questioned for more than 25 years (445), but these estimates are 
2575 
currently widely used because of their suitability for large scale automatic analyses 
2576 
within short time periods. In many clinics, they are the standard of measurement in 
2577 
pregnancy. Because pregnancy may influence results of these assays from different 
2578 
manufacturers in different ways, and in some assays give spuriously low results (446), 
2579 
method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be used and 
2580 
provided by the manufacturer (447,448). If trimester specific references for free T4 (and 
2581 
free T3) are not provided, and total T4 (and T3) assays are not locally available, samples 
2582 
for thyroid function testing in pregnancy should be send to a reference laboratory.  
2583 
[T2] Management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy 
2584 
 
Table 11 provides a summary of the recommendations concerning management of 
2585 
GD during pregnancy. 
2586 
■ RECOMMENDATION 79 
2587 
Transient hCG-mediated TSH suppression in early pregnancy should not be treated 
2588 
with antithyroid drug therapy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2589 
 
Once the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made in a pregnant woman, attention 
2590 
should focus on determining the etiology and whether it warrants treatment. Clinical 
2591 
features that indicate the presence of hyperthyroidism include failure to gain weight, heat 
2592 
intolerance, excessive sweating, and tachycardia, beyond that normally associated with 
2593 
pregnancy. 
2594 
  
The two most common types of biochemical hyperthyroidism that occur during 
2595 
pregnancy are gestational hyperthyroidism (e.g., hCG-mediated transient TSH 
2596 
suppression) and GD. Gestational hyperthyroidism is a generally asymptomatic, mild and 
2597 
self-limiting biochemical hyperthyroidism that may be observed in the first trimester of 
2598 
normal pregnancy. The disorder lacks the characteristics of Graves’ disease (431), and is 
2599 
presumably caused by the high serum hCG of early pregnancy (440). It is not associated 
2600 
with adverse pregnancy outcomes (449). More severe degrees of gestational 
2601 
hyperthyroidism are associated with hyperemesis; affected women may develop 
2602 
biochemically overt hyperthyroidism and clinical symptoms and signs of 
2603 
hyperthyroidism. Complicated cases of gestational hyperthyroidism should be referred to 
2604 
medical centers with expertise in treating these patients. 
2605 
 
Technical remarks: There is no evidence that treatment of gestational 
2606 
hyperthyroidism with ATDs is beneficial and use of ATD in early pregnancy has been 
2607 
associated with an increase in risk of birth defects. In these patients, physical examination 
2608 
and repeat thyroid function tests at intervals of 3–4 weeks is recommended. In the case of 
2609 
very symptomatic disease, a trial of beta blocker therapy (propranolol or metroprolol, but 
2610 
not atenolol (450,451)) for this transient disorder may be considered. 
2611 
■ RECOMMENDATION 80 
2612 
ATD therapy should be used for overt hyperthyroidism due to GD during pregnancy. 
2613 
PTU should be used when ATD therapy is given during the first trimester. MMI 
2614 
should be used when ATD therapy is started after the first trimester. Strong 
2615 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2616 
  
Untreated or insufficiently treated hyperthyroidism may seriously complicate 
2617 
pregnancy (452-454), and patients with this disorder should be treated at centers with 
2618 
specific expertise in this area. GD as the cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy may be 
2619 
diagnosed from typical clinical findings, including the presence of GO and/or serum 
2620 
TRAb in a hyperthyroid patient. Approximately 5% of patients with newly diagnosed 
2621 
Graves’ hyperthyroidism are TRAb negative in older assays (47,455), and 3% are 
2622 
negative in third generation assays (57), especially those with milder disease. 
2623 
 
A small increase in incidence of GD was found in early pregnancy in one study 
2624 
(456), and this fits the clinical observation that existing GD may occasionally worsen in 
2625 
early pregnancy (457). On the other hand, the incidence of GD drops dramatically in late 
2626 
pregnancy (456), which is consistent with the notion that thyroid autoimmunity improves 
2627 
in the second half of pregnancy (458).  
2628 
 
Women who were treated with ATDs for GD and considered in remission after 
2629 
such previous therapy, and become pregnant, have a small risk of recurrence and should 
2630 
have their thyroid function tested in early pregnancy. In contrast, the risk of relapse (as 
2631 
well as the risk of thyrotoxicosis from postpartum destructive thyroiditis) during the 
2632 
postpartum period is relatively high (459), and it remains elevated for more than one year 
2633 
(456).  
2634 
 
ATDs have much the same effect on thyroid function in pregnant as in non-
2635 
pregnant women. Both ATDs and TRAb pass the placenta and can affect the fetal 
2636 
thyroid. On the other hand, T4 and T3 cross the placenta only in limited amounts, because 
2637 
of degradation by high deiodinase type 3 activities in the placenta (460). 
2638 
  
PTU generally has been preferred in pregnancy because of concerns about well-
2639 
documented teratogenicity associated with MMI, first described in 1972 (461). Defects 
2640 
that may be observed in 2-4 % of exposed children (462,463) have included aplasia cutis, 
2641 
choanal atresia, esophageal and other types of gut atresias, abdominal wall abnormalities 
2642 
including omphalocale, eye, heart, and urinary tract malformations. Moreover, typical 
2643 
facial features of MMI-exposed children have been described in case reports (464). In a 
2644 
US study, 31 % of women who had received MMI around the time of conception had 
2645 
elective termination of pregnancy versus 9 % of those who received PTU, and it was 
2646 
hypothesized that fear of MMI associated birth defects had led to the decision to 
2647 
terminate pregnancy (465).  
2648 
 
Recently, an increase in the rate of birth defects (2.3 % above the background 
2649 
rate) was also observed after PTU exposure in early pregnancy (463), but these defects 
2650 
tended to be less severe than with MMI and included preauricular sinuses and cysts and 
2651 
urinary tract abnormalities (466). In a large group of children selected because they had 
2652 
major birth defects and had been exposed to some type of medication in early pregnancy, 
2653 
children exposed to PTU had a significantly higher frequency of situs inversus and 
2654 
cardiac outflow abnormalities than children exposed to other drugs (467), but these types 
2655 
of defects have not been observed in excess in studies comparing PTU exposed children 
2656 
with non-selected control children. Similar to other teratogenic drugs (468) the period of 
2657 
highest risk for birth defects from ATDs is gestational weeks 6-10 (469). 
2658 
 
Concerns about rare but potentially fatal PTU-related hepatotoxicity have led The 
2659 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recommended that PTU be reserved for patients 
2660 
 who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, or who are allergic to or intolerant of MMI 
2661 
(157,470)  
2662 
 
MMI and PTU both appear in breast milk in only small concentrations and studies 
2663 
of breast-fed infants of mothers taking ATDs have demonstrated normal thyroid function 
2664 
and subsequent normal intellectual development (109). However, because of the potential 
2665 
for hepatic necrosis in either mother or child from maternal PTU use, MMI is the 
2666 
preferred ATD in nursing mothers. 
2667 
 
As discussed in other sections of these guidelines, small doses of beta-adrenergic 
2668 
blocking agents are in general useful to reduce pulse rate and the hyperadrenergic 
2669 
symptoms of thyrotoxicosis during the time period from start of ATD therapy until the 
2670 
patient has become euthyroid. These agents have been studied extensively when used for 
2671 
treating hypertension in pregnancy, and no major side-effects have been detected, 
2672 
although fetal growth restriction has been associated with the prolonged use of especially 
2673 
atenolol (431,471). Therapy with propranolol (e.g. 10-20 mg every eight hour) or 
2674 
metopolol (e.g. 100 mg once daily) are useful and can be considered safe for short 
2675 
periods of time to relieve symptoms in pregnant women suffering from thyrotoxicosis. 
2676 
■ RECOMMENDATION 81 
2677 
In women who develop hyperthyroidism during their reproductive age range, the 
2678 
possibility and timing of future pregnancy should be discussed. Because of the risks of 
2679 
the hyperthyroid state on pregnancy and fetal outcome, we suggest that women should 
2680 
 postpone pregnancy until they have become euthyroid with therapy. Strong 
2681 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2682 
 
Both maternal thyroid dysfunction and therapy of the hyperthyroidism may have 
2683 
negative effects on the pregnancy outcome. These factors should all be considered when 
2684 
determining the choice of therapy for the patient who is currently pregnant, or in the 
2685 
future may become pregnant.  
2686 
 
A single set of thyroid function tests within the reference range may not guarantee 
2687 
euthyroidism for more than a short period during the early phase of hyperthyroidism 
2688 
therapy. Two sets of tests within the reference range, taken with an interval of at least one 
2689 
month and without a change of therapy is preferable to indicate euthyroidism.  
2690 
■ RECOMMENDATION 82 
2691 
We suggest that women with hyperthyroidism caused by GD that require high doses of 
2692 
ATDs to achieve euthyroidism should be considered for definitive therapy before they 
2693 
become pregnant. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2694 
 
Both thyroidectomy and RAI therapy are useful for rendering patients with GD 
2695 
permanently hypothyroid with the possibility of a stable euthyroid state on thyroid 
2696 
hormone replacement therapy, as discussed in these guidelines. Thyroidectomy is often 
2697 
followed by a decrease or disappearance of TRAb from circulation, whereas RAI is 
2698 
often followed by a transient increase in TRAb. This is a potential argument in favor of 
2699 
surgical thyroidectomy in women with high TRAb titers that may become pregnant 
2700 
within the years to come, especially those planning therapy within the next year (172). 
2701 
 However, the importance of this difference in autoimmune activity for pregnancy 
2702 
outcome has not been studied, and it should be weighed against the other benefits and 
2703 
harms of surgery and RAI therapy. 
2704 
 
To predict reduction in TRAb after surgical thyroidectomy, a recent retrospective 
2705 
Japanese study of 45 (41 female) patients with high TRAb (median 64 IU/L, range 5.6-
2706 
400, normal for assay < 1.9 IU/L) may be useful. Patients were followed for 12 months. 
2707 
Smoking and the presence of orbitopathy predicted slow disappearance of TRAb (half-
2708 
life 162 days, or 357 days if both factors were present), whereas TRAb levels in serum 
2709 
decreased with a half-life of 94 days in the remaining patients (472). 
2710 
 
Medical tradition and experience with different types of therapy for GD varies 
2711 
between countries and clinics, and the risk of relapse of hyperthyroidism after ATD 
2712 
withdrawal may differ considerably, depending on iodine intake, and other factors that 
2713 
are only partly understood (473). Thus, advice given to women with GD on therapy in 
2714 
relation to a possible future pregnancy may differ. However, irrespective of such 
2715 
differences, the physician providing care to a young woman with newly diagnosed GD, 
2716 
should include discussion and guidance on GD and pregnancy. The severely hyperthyroid 
2717 
patient may not be in a position to fully comprehend many simultaneous messages, and a 
2718 
more detailed discussion may be appropriate when the patient has become euthyroid.   
2719 
■ RECOMMENDATION 83 
2720 
Women with hyperthyroidism caused by GD who are well controlled on MMI and 
2721 
desire pregnancy have several options: 
2722 
    a) Patients could consider definitive therapy before they become pregnant. 
2723 
   b) Patients could switch to PTU before trying to conceive. 
2724 
   c) Patients could switch to PTU as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed. 
2725 
   d) Appropriately selected patients could withdraw from ATD therapy as soon as 
2726 
pregnancy is diagnosed. If ATD therapy is withdrawn, thyroid function should be 
2727 
assessed weekly throughout the first trimester, then monthly. Weak 
2728 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2729 
 
The evidence is insufficient to give universal guidance on how to choose among 
2730 
these options, and therefore the potential risks and benefits of each option should be 
2731 
discussed with the patient, and patient values and preferences should be taken into 
2732 
account.   
2733 
 
Each option is presented in depth in the following technical remarks:  
2734 
  A. Definitive therapy before becoming pregnant. 
2735 
 
This strategy is discussed in Recommendation 82.  It has the advantage of 
2736 
allowing the patient to become pregnant free of worry from the adverse fetal effects of 
2737 
ATDs. The disadvantage is that the patient will require levothyroxine therapy while 
2738 
pregnant and lifelong, and will be exposed to either the potential complications of RAI, 
2739 
including worsening or induction of Graves’ orbitopathy, or the potential for undesirable 
2740 
surgical outcomes.  
2741 
  
2742 
B. Switching from MMI to PTU before pregnancy. 
2743 
 
Switching from MMI to PTU before conception would eliminate the risk from 
2744 
early pregnancy exposure to MMI in women where pregnancy is not recognized within 
2745 
the first few weeks after conception. MMI associated birth defects occur in 2-4 % of 
2746 
children exposed in early pregnancy, and abnormalities may be severe. PTU associated 
2747 
birth defects are less well documented. They may occur in 2-3 % of children but they 
2748 
seem to be mostly less severe. PTU is associated with liver failure with an estimated 
2749 
1:10,000 risk of severe liver failure in adult patients (136). Thus, mothers must balance 
2750 
the risk of PTU to themselves vs. the risk to the child. Switching to PTU before 
2751 
conception may be preferred in younger women with regular menses who are expected 
2752 
to be able to conceive within 1 to 3 months. In a German prospective study of 340 such 
2753 
women, 68 % became pregnant within 3 months (474). 
2754 
 
A special variant is women who have hyperthyroidism diagnosed at a time when 
2755 
they hope to become pregnant soon. There are not sufficient data to recommend for or 
2756 
against starting therapy with PTU and thus bypass a phase of MMI therapy in such 
2757 
patients.   
2758 
C. Switching from MMI to PTU after conception. 
2759 
 
Alternatively, the patient may continue MMI therapy but be prepared to detect 
2760 
pregnancy very early and modify therapy immediately as recommended below. 
2761 
Switching to PTU as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed may be preferred in older women 
2762 
 and women who have conditions that may be associated with delayed conception. This 
2763 
strategy may prevent prolonged use of PTU prior to conception but has the risk of fetal 
2764 
exposure to MMI if the diagnosis of pregnancy is delayed. 
2765 
D. Withdrawing ATD treatment after conception.  
2766 
 
Women with a stable euthyroid state on 5-10 mg MMI per day achieved within a 
2767 
few months, and a falling TRAb level are likely candidates to withdraw from ATD 
2768 
therapy in early pregnancy. 
2769 
 
No study has directly addressed the risk of relapse of hyperthyroidism after ATD 
2770 
withdrawal in early pregnancy, and evidence comes from controlled or cohort studies of 
2771 
non-pregnant patients who had been treated with ATD for varying periods before drug 
2772 
withdrawal. Based on the latter studies, the risk of relapse of hyperthyroidism within a 
2773 
two month interval after ATD withdrawal in TRAb negative, non-smoking patients who 
2774 
have already been treated for 12-24 months is <10 % (167,475).  
2775 
 
On the other hand, the risk of early relapse is very high in patients who have 
2776 
received ATD for less than six months, and/or still have indicators of high disease 
2777 
activity such as low serum TSH, high TRAb level, signs of active GO, or need of MMI 
2778 
dose in excess of 5-10 mg per day to remain euthyroid (473). 
2779 
 
If ATD withdrawal is followed by a relapse of hyperthyroidism, this will often 
2780 
develop gradually over some weeks, but exact information on such time course in early 
2781 
pregnancy is not available. This is the reason for the recommendation of frequent thyroid 
2782 
 function testing during the remaining 1st trimester of pregnancy, until more data on safety 
2783 
becomes available. 
2784 
 
A subset of women with GD will experience relapse of hyperthyroidism in 
2785 
pregnancy if ATD therapy is withdrawn according to recommendation 81. Frequent 
2786 
testing of thyroid function will allow early detection of such relapse and initiation of 
2787 
therapy with PTU (or MMI if relapse occurs in the second trimester) to keep the 
2788 
mother euthyroid. The risk to the mother from such hyperthyroidism is considered 
2789 
negligible. 
2790 
 
Considering the fetus, two recent studies performed in Japan suggest that such 
2791 
transient and mild maternal hyperthyroidism will not increase the risk of malformations. 
2792 
One study observed a significantly lower risk of birth defects in mothers who had been 
2793 
shifted from MMI to iodine therapy in early pregnancy, even if part of the mothers in the 
2794 
iodine group had developed biochemical hyperthyroidism and needed retreatment with 
2795 
ATD (476). In another study from the same institution, the presence of a major birth 
2796 
defect was associated with the use of MMI in early pregnancy, but not with maternal 
2797 
thyroid dysfunction (462). 
2798 
 
A more pertinent risk may be fetal loss caused by maternal hyperthyroidism in 
2799 
pregnancy (477,478). However, the risk from a brief period of mild maternal thyroid 
2800 
hyperfunction in early pregnancy may be low or absent. In a large cohort of pregnant 
2801 
women from the USA, low or suppressed serum TSH in early pregnancy (presumably 
2802 
mostly caused by early pregnancy high hCG levels) was not associated with adverse 
2803 
pregnancy outcomes (449). In the recent retrospective Japanese study of women with GD 
2804 
 either treated with MMI in early pregnancy or shifted from MMI to iodine therapy in 
2805 
early pregnancy, there was no increase in fetal loss in the iodine group despite more cases 
2806 
of maternal hyperthyroidism in this group (476).  
2807 
■ RECOMMENDATION 84 
2808 
We suggest that women who are treated with ATD and who may potentially become 
2809 
pregnant should be instructed to perform a pregnancy test within the first days after a 
2810 
missed or unusually light menstrual period. Weak recommendation, low-quality 
2811 
evidence. 
2812 
 
The period of major risk of birth defects caused by intake of medication in 
2813 
pregnancy is gestational weeks 6-10 (468), and a study of time of exposure to ATD and 
2814 
risk of defects suggests this is also the major period of teratogenic effects of ATD (469). 
2815 
Thus, withdrawal of ATD therapy  before week five of pregnancy may theoretically 
2816 
prevent birth defects caused by ATD exposure.  
2817 
 
The week of pregnancy is calculated starting from the first day of the last normal 
2818 
menstrual period, with conception taking place about two weeks after this. The first real 
2819 
sign of pregnancy appears two weeks later, and it is a missed or unusually light menstrual 
2820 
period. By this time, blood and urine concentrations of hCG have started to rise and 
2821 
generally available pregnancy tests based on detection of hCG in urine normally become 
2822 
positive early in gestational week five. Very early testing for pregnancy to allow 
2823 
medication withdrawal before the major period of teratogenecity is recommended for 
2824 
other types of drugs that may be teratogenic (479). 
2825 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 85 
2826 
We suggest that a woman who tests positive for pregnancy according to 
2827 
recommendation 84 contact the physician responsible for the ATD therapy within 24 
2828 
hours  to discuss future treatment options. Weak recommendation, low-quality 
2829 
evidence. 
2830 
 
The time window that will allow medication withdrawal or change in early 
2831 
pregnancy to prevent birth defects is narrow (468,469), probably confined to gestational 
2832 
week 5. Thus, pregnancy should be detected early and action has to be taken 
2833 
immediately.  
2834 
■ RECOMMENDATION 86 
2835 
We suggest that the physician contacted according to recommendation 85 evaluate 
2836 
whether ATD withdrawal in the first trimester of pregnancy is likely to cause relapse 
2837 
of hyperthyroidism or not. Evaluation should be based on patient records, especially 
2838 
the severity of GD at time of diagnosis and current disease activity, duration of ATD 
2839 
therapy, current ATD dose requirement, and results of recent thyroid function and 
2840 
TRAb testing. If risk of relapse is considered low, therapy can be withdrawn, and 
2841 
followed by weekly thyroid function testing during the 1st trimester.  Weak 
2842 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2843 
 
In the majority of patients with GD, ATD therapy is followed by a gradual 
2844 
remission of disease with a possibility of disappearance of TRAb from circulation (172). 
2845 
When patients have been treated with ATD for 12-18 months a rapid relapse of 
2846 
 hyperthyroidism after ATD withdrawal becomes less likely (119), even if the frequency 
2847 
of relapse may be in the order of 50 % within one year. The risk of relapse after ATD 
2848 
withdrawal varies considerably among individual patients and it depends on a variety of 
2849 
factors (473), as discussed in detail above.  
2850 
■ RECOMMENDATION 87 
2851 
We suggest that women in early pregnancy who have a high risk of recurrent or 
2852 
worsening hyperthyroidism if ATD is withdrawn be shifted from MMI to PTU 
2853 
immediately after diagnosing pregnancy. Weak recommendation, low-quality 
2854 
evidence. 
2855 
 
Even if birth defects may occur after both MMI and PTU exposure in early 
2856 
pregnancy (463), defects after MMI exposure are better documented. The reason for this 
2857 
seems to be that MMI associated defects are more severe, whereas PTU associated 
2858 
defects tend to be less severe and may not be diagnosed immediately after birth (466). 
2859 
 
Both MMI and PTU are effective therapies of hyperthyroidism in the majority of 
2860 
patients and the major effect of both drugs is to interact with thyroid peroxidase catalyzed 
2861 
thyroid hormone production (109). Apart from the differences in side-effects discussed 
2862 
above, it is important to consider differences in potency per mg drug and in duration of 
2863 
effect. 
2864 
 
A dosage ratio of MMI to PTU of 1:20 is recommended when changing from one 
2865 
drug to another (115,319,480), although only two studies have examined this dosage ratio 
2866 
directly (115,319). Moreover, the difference in duration of effect should be taken into 
2867 
 account. For example, 15 mg of MMI would be roughly equivalent to 300 mg of PTU, 
2868 
but because the half-life of PTU is considerably shorter than that of MMI, the dose of 
2869 
PTU should be split over the day (481,482), e.g. MMI 15 mg once daily may be 
2870 
substituted with PTU 100 mg three times a day (319).  
2871 
■ RECOMMENDATION 88 
2872 
Women taking PTU during the 1st trimester of pregnancy according to 
2873 
recommendations 80, 83 or 87 may be switched to MMI at the beginning of the 2nd 
2874 
trimester, or they may continue PTU therapy for the remaining part of pregnancy if 
2875 
ATD is needed. No Recommendation, insufficient evidence to assess benefits and 
2876 
risks. 
2877 
 
The reason for the FDA black box warning against PTU therapy after the 1st 
2878 
trimester of pregnancy is the risk of PTU associated liver failure. However, even if this 
2879 
risk is real, the absolute risk observed in studies of US health databases was low 
2880 
(433,465). Similarly, a recent Danish national registry study observed one case of 
2881 
reversible liver failure among 1,103 women treated with PTU in pregnancy (129).  
2882 
 
The risk of side effects from PTU should be weighed against the risk of the shift 
2883 
from PTU to MMI inducing a transient thyroid function abnormality in the pregnant 
2884 
woman who is well controlled on PTU therapy. Starting from the 2nd trimester of 
2885 
pregnancy, women with GD may start entering gradual remission of the autoimmune 
2886 
abnormality, and full focus should be on the feasibility of ATD dose reduction to protect 
2887 
the fetus against goiter and hypothyroidism, as discussed below. Patients who remain on 
2888 
 PTU during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters could have hepatic enzymes measured at the same 
2889 
time that thyroid function is assessed. However, no prospective data show that this type 
2890 
of monitoring is effective in preventing fulminant PTU-related hepatotoxicity. Another 
2891 
aspect to consider is that both agranulocytosis and liver failure developing during MMI 
2892 
and PTU therapy mostly occur during the initial three months of therapy (128), but this 
2893 
risk can recur when the drug is reintroduced after a relatively long period of time (177). 
2894 
For example, in a Japanese study (177) of 14 patients who developed agranulocytosis 
2895 
after retreatment with the same ATD, no patient developed this adverse reaction who 
2896 
restarted the drug less than 5 months after stopping the previous course of therapy. There 
2897 
are no data to directly evaluate how shifting from PTU to MMI in the 2nd trimester of 
2898 
pregnancy will affect the risk of these severe, but rare side effects.  
2899 
Other medical treatments for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy 
2900 
 
Other types of medical therapy have been used to treat hyperthyroidism, such as 
2901 
iodine, perchlorate, cholestyramine, cholecystographic agents, and lithium.  
2902 
 
Iodine in supraphysiological doses has multiple mostly inhibitory effects on the 
2903 
thyroid, and it has with some success been used to treat hyperthyroid women in 
2904 
pregnancy in Japan. In one study, cord and maternal sera were tested at delivery in 35 
2905 
patients with GD treated with iodine (6-40 mg daily) initiated at 11-37 weeks of 
2906 
gestation. Similar to ATD therapy, thyroid function at term tended to be lower in the 
2907 
fetus than in the mother, but overall results of therapy were judged satisfactory, with a 
2908 
low risk of inducing hypothyroidism and goiter in the fetus; only 1 of 35 neonates had 
2909 
subclinical hypothyroidism at birth (483). In a recent study, outcomes of pregnancy 
2910 
 were retrospectively compared in 1,333 women who had continued ATD in early 
2911 
pregnancy with 283 women who had shifted from ATD to iodine (median gestational 
2912 
week of shift was week 6 (range 4-12)) (476). Overall, shifting had been more common 
2913 
in recent years. The prevalence of major birth defects was lower in the women who had 
2914 
shifted to iodine therapy (1.53 % versus 4.14 %, p<0.05). However, according to the 
2915 
authors, some degree of hyperthyroidism was relatively common after shifting, and free 
2916 
T4 levels were always higher in the group that had shifted to iodine. Despite this, live 
2917 
births were more common in the group that had shifted than in the group that had 
2918 
continued MMI therapy (91.9 % versus 85.1 %, p< 0.05). In the publication, data on 
2919 
thyroid function in the MMI group are sparse, but the study may indicate that a brief 
2920 
period of mild hyperthyroidism in the mother will not impair pregnancy.  
2921 
 
No recent data on iodine therapy for GD in pregnancy are available from outside 
2922 
Japan, but before ATDs became available, experience with iodine therapy for GD in 
2923 
general was extensive (484), and it corresponds to the more recent Japanese studies. The 
2924 
minimal effective dose of iodine was around 6 mg day but most patients received higher 
2925 
doses, iodine was effective for therapy of hyperthyroidism in patients with mild GD, but 
2926 
clearly less effective than ATD in patients with more severe disease (484). Additional 
2927 
data are needed before iodine therapy of pregnant women with GD can be generally 
2928 
recommended.  
2929 
 
Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of iodine uptake by the thyroid, and a few 
2930 
cases have been published where it was used in pregnancy (485). Apparently, 
2931 
teratogenicity of perchlorate has not been demonstrated (486), but more clinical studies 
2932 
 on this are clearly needed. Further, this drug is not available in the United States.  
2933 
 
Cholestyramine binds thyroid hormones in the gut during their entero-hepatic 
2934 
recirculation and has been used to treat hyperthyroidism, mostly in combination with 
2935 
other drugs (487,488). Cholestyramine is not absorbed from the gut and it is not expected 
2936 
to affect the fetus directly. However, binding in the gut and excretion of vitamins and 
2937 
other substances of importance for pregnancy is a concern, and has led to a note of 
2938 
caution by the US Food and Drug Administration. Cholecystographic drugs are not 
2939 
generally available any more. Lithium may be teratogenic (489) and it should not be used 
2940 
to treat hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. 
2941 
    
2942 
■ RECOMMENDATION 89 
2943 
GD during pregnancy should be treated with the lowest possible dose of ATD needed 
2944 
to keep the mother’s thyroid hormone levels at or slightly above the reference range 
2945 
for total T4 and T3 values in pregnancy (1.5 times above non-pregnant reference 
2946 
ranges in the 2nd and 3rd trimester), and the TSH below the reference range for 
2947 
pregnancy. Similarly, free T4 levels should be kept at or slightly above the upper limit 
2948 
of the pregnancy trimester reference range for the assay. Thyroid function should be 
2949 
assessed at least monthly, and the ATD dose adjusted, as required. Strong 
2950 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2951 
 
Even if the mother is euthyroid during ATD therapy, there is a risk of inducing 
2952 
fetal hypothyroidism and goiter during the second and third trimesters when the fetal 
2953 
 thyroid has begun to function (490,491). Thus, the dose of ATD should be kept as low as 
2954 
possible. Block-replacement therapy consisting of ATD plus levothyroxine should not be 
2955 
used in pregnancy. If a woman receiving such therapy becomes pregnant, and she is still 
2956 
in need of ATD therapy, the regimen should be changed to an ATD alone (444). 
2957 
 
Technical remarks: Free T4 is the parameter that has been most closely correlated 
2958 
with good fetal outcome. Serum TSH may still be suppressed in these patients and should 
2959 
not be used as the sole guide in treatment, although normalization of maternal TSH 
2960 
during ATD therapy may indicate a need to reduce the dose of ATD (444). In Japanese 
2961 
studies, ATD treated maternal free T4 values had been kept above the non-pregnancy 
2962 
reference range in the last part of pregnancy to avoid cases of elevated TSH in newborn 
2963 
cord blood (458,491). However, with some automated free T4 assays non-pregnancy free 
2964 
T4 is much higher than late pregnancy free T4 (446,492). Thus, maternal free T4 above the 
2965 
non-pregnancy reference with suppressed TSH may leave the mother overtly 
2966 
hyperthyroid, which is not recommended. 
2967 
 
Although many patients with GD may enter remission of the autoimmune 
2968 
abnormality during the 2nd half of pregnancy with a need of ATD dose reduction or 
2969 
withdrawal, this is not a universal phenomenon. A small group of patients suffers from 
2970 
severe disease that may even progress during pregnancy, with difficult to treat 
2971 
hyperthyroidism, high TRAb levels and often a considerable goiter with high blood flow. 
2972 
Such patients may show a ‘high T3 - low T4 pattern’ during ATD therapy (444) 
2973 
presumably caused by a high type 1 deiodinase activity in the hyperactive thyroid (493), 
2974 
and preferential T3 synthesis in the hyperstimulated thyroid made iodine deficient from 
2975 
 ATD therapy (494). Maternal thyroid function should be monitored frequently and non-
2976 
invasive assessment of fetal thyroid function (e.g. fetal heart rate, bone maturity, 
2977 
and fetal goiter on ultrasound), and ATD therapy balanced to keep acceptable thyroid 
2978 
function in both the mother and the fetus (444).  
2979 
  ■ RECOMMENDATION 90 
2980 
Pregnancy is a relative contraindication to thyroidectomy and should only be used 
2981 
when medical management has been unsuccessful or ATDs cannot be used. Strong 
2982 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2983 
 
In a population based US study, pregnant women had worse clinical and 
2984 
economic outcomes following thyroid (and parathyroid) surgery than non-pregnant 
2985 
women, with disparities in outcomes based on race, insurance, and access to high-volume 
2986 
surgeons (68). 
2987 
■ RECOMMENDATION 91 
2988 
 When thyroidectomy is necessary for the treatment of hyperthyroidism during 
2989 
pregnancy, the surgery should be performed if possible during the second trimester. 
2990 
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
2991 
 
Thyroidectomy is best avoided in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy 
2992 
because of teratogenic effects associated with anesthetic agents and increased risk of fetal 
2993 
loss in the first trimester and increased risk of preterm labor in the third. Optimally, 
2994 
 thyroidectomy would be performed in the latter portion of the second trimester. Although 
2995 
it is the safest time, it is not without risk (4.5–5.5% risk of preterm labor) (67,68). 
2996 
Evaluation by a high-risk obstetrician is advised along with counseling before surgery 
2997 
regarding risks involved (68). Thyroidectomy cures the hyperthyroidism and is often 
2998 
followed by a gradual reduction in circulating TRAb (495). Until such remission takes 
2999 
place, TRAb produced by the mother may stimulate the thyroid of the fetus or newborn 
3000 
and induce hyperthyroidism. In the setting where the mother still harbors TRAb after 
3001 
thyroidectomy, close fetal monitoring for both cardiovascular and skeletal changes with 
3002 
fetal ultrasound is essential. 
3003 
  
There are no data concerning whether SSKI or iodine should be used to prepare 
3004 
pregnant patients for thyroidectomy. The risk of iodide therapy to the fetus relates to 
3005 
inhibition of iodine organification via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. The fetal thyroid gland 
3006 
is particularly susceptible to the inhibitory effects of excess iodine in the second half of 
3007 
gestation, and fetal goiter can occur with chronic therapy (496). However, there is no 
3008 
evidence that brief iodine preparation of the mother done preoperatively to reduce thyroid 
3009 
blood flow and control hyperthyroidism is harmful to the fetus. 
3010 
 
Technical remarks: In patients with difficult to treat hyperthyroidism, 
3011 
preoperative preparation for thyroidectomy during the second trimester of pregnancy 
3012 
includes 10 days of iodine (e.g., SSKI 1 drop three times a day), along with ATD therapy 
3013 
and beta-blockers (propranolol  or metroprolol, but not atenolol (450,451)) to control 
3014 
hyperthyroidism (497-499). In euthyroid patients with no signs of high thyroid activity, 
3015 
 but who are offered surgical thyroidectomy for other reasons, e.g. intolerance to ATD, 
3016 
the use of iodine for surgical preparation is considered unnecessary.  
3017 
[T3] The role of TRAb levels measurement in pregnancy 
3018 
■ RECOMMENDATION 92 
3019 
TRAb levels should be measured when the etiology of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy 
3020 
is uncertain. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3021 
 
The two best indicators of the activity of GD during pregnancy are thyroid 
3022 
function in the untreated patient and measurement of TRAb levels in the serum. TRAb 
3023 
measurement is useful in the diagnosis of GD in pregnant women with newly diagnosed 
3024 
hyperthyroidism who do not have clinical signs specific for GD, keeping in mind that the 
3025 
diagnostic sensitivity of good assays is around 95%, and the specificity is 99% (47). 
3026 
■ RECOMMENDATION 93 
3027 
 Patients who were treated with RAI or thyroidectomy for GD prior to pregnancy 
3028 
should have TRAb levels measured using a sensitive assay initially during the first 
3029 
trimester thyroid function testing and, if elevated, again at 18-22 weeks of gestation. 
3030 
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3031 
 
Measurement of TRAb levels can detect persistent TSH-receptor autoimmunity in 
3032 
a pregnant woman previously treated with ablative therapy (radioactive iodine or 
3033 
thyroidectomy) for GD who is now euthyroid with or without thyroid hormone 
3034 
replacement (495,500). If the mother still produces TRAb, the antibodies will cross the 
3035 
 placenta and may affect fetal thyroid function in the last half of the pregnancy. Because 
3036 
of the slow clearance of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the neonatal circulation, 
3037 
thyroid dysfunction in the child may last for several months after birth. To evaluate the 
3038 
risk of such complications, a TRAb level should be measured in the pregnant woman 
3039 
initially during the first trimester and, if elevated, again at 18–22 weeks of gestation. If 
3040 
the level is high, a program of fetal and neonatal surveillance for thyroid dysfunction 
3041 
should be initiated (501).  
3042 
 
The advantage to initial TRAb measurement during the first trimester is that this 
3043 
allows time to initiate specialty consultation and, if the levels are especially high at that 
3044 
time, intervention may be required by the 2nd trimester. Whereas it has generally been 
3045 
considered that isolated fetal thyrotoxicosis in a previously ablated mother who is still 
3046 
producing TRAb might only start developing around weeks 20-22 of pregnancy, a recent 
3047 
case report described severe fetal thyrotoxicosis that had developed already in gestational 
3048 
week 18 (502). The pregnant women had previously undergone unsuccessful RAI, and 
3049 
subsequently a total thyroidectomy had been performed followed by L-T4 replacement. 
3050 
The mother was now euthyroid, but her TRAb values remained extremely elevated.  
3051 
 
TRAb measurement is not necessary in a euthyroid pregnant patient previously 
3052 
found to have GD if she has an intact thyroid (i.e., not previously treated with surgery or 
3053 
RAI) and she is not currently taking ATDs (495,503). 
3054 
■ RECOMMENDATION 94 
3055 
 Patients receiving ATD for GD when becoming pregnant or found to have GD during 
3056 
pregnancy should have TRAb levels measured at initial pregnancy visit or at diagnosis 
3057 
using a sensitive assay and, if elevated, again at 18-22 weeks of gestation. Strong 
3058 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3059 
 
TRAb (TBII or TSI) measurement may be useful to assist in the evaluation of 
3060 
disease activity in a woman being treated with ATDs for GD during pregnancy 
3061 
(444,495). In many patients, GD gradually remits during pregnancy. Disappearance of 
3062 
TRAb is an indication that ATD therapy may no longer be necessary, and that its 
3063 
continuation may put the fetus at risk for hypothyroidism, even if the mother is euthyroid 
3064 
on the medication.  
3065 
■ RECOMMENDATION 95 
3066 
 
Patients with elevated TRAb levels at 18-22 weeks of gestation should have 
3067 
TRAb remeasured in late pregnancy (weeks 30-34) to guide decisions regarding neonatal 
3068 
monitoring. An exception to this is a woman with an intact thyroid who is no longer in 
3069 
need of ATD therapy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3070 
 
TRAb measurement in late pregnancy can be used to assess the risk of delayed 
3071 
neonatal hyperthyroidism, when the mother continues to need ATD to control 
3072 
hyperthyroidism up to term. After delivery, ATD delivered to the fetus via placental 
3073 
passage is rapidly metabolized by the neonate, whereas the maternal TRAb disappears 
3074 
more slowly, with a half-life of around 3 weeks. Thus, a high level of TRAb in the 
3075 
mother in late pregnancy is an indicator that the neonate may need to be monitored for 
3076 
 the onset of neonatal hyperthyroidism starting a few days after birth. In a recent study of 
3077 
47 newborns to mothers who were TRAb positive in pregnancy, nine of the children had 
3078 
neonatal biochemical hyperthyroidism, and five of these (9 % of all) needed ATD 
3079 
therapy. All hyperthyroid neonates were born to mothers with TRAb levels ≥ 5 IU/l (> 3 
3080 
times upper reference for the assay) in the 2nd trimester (sensitivity 100%, specificity 
3081 
43%). All mothers who gave birth to hyperthyroid newborns required ATD therapy in 
3082 
late pregnancy (504). 
3083 
[T4] Postpartum thyroiditis 
3084 
■ RECOMMENDATION 96 
3085 
In women developing thyrotoxicosis after delivery, selective diagnostic studies should 
3086 
be performed to distinguish postpartum destructive thyroiditis from postpartum GD. 
3087 
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3088 
 
Postpartum thyroid dysfunction occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies in the United 
3089 
States. Postpartum thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder unmasked in predisposed 
3090 
women as immune surveillance rebounds after pregnancy. The classic triphasic pattern is 
3091 
thyrotoxicosis at 1–6 months postpartum, followed by hypothyroidism and return to 
3092 
euthyroidism at 9–12 months postpartum (505,506). However, this sequence is not 
3093 
observed in every patient. Among 371 cases in 13 studies, 25% of patients were found to 
3094 
have a triphasic pattern, 43% had hypothyroidism without preceding thyrotoxicosis, and 
3095 
32% had thyrotoxicosis without subsequent hypothyroidism (506). In a prospective study 
3096 
of pregnant women, those with positive thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies in the first 
3097 
 trimester were 27 times more likely to develop postpartum thyroiditis than were those 
3098 
with negative serology (507). In this study, tobacco smoking and bottle-feeding increased 
3099 
the risk of developing thyroiditis. 
3100 
 
Postpartum thyroiditis must be distinguished from GD to recommend proper 
3101 
therapy. The postpartum surge in thyroid autoimmunity leading to postpartum thyroiditis 
3102 
is also associated with a 3-4 fold increase in the incidence of GD that peaks 3-12 months 
3103 
after delivery (456). In a Japanese hospital study, thyrotoxicosis caused by thyroiditis 
3104 
developed earlier post-partum than GD, although some overlap existed. All patients who 
3105 
developed overt thyrotoxicosis within the first three months after delivery suffered from 
3106 
destructive thyroiditis, whereas GD developed after this 3 months period (508).  Goiter is 
3107 
generally more pronounced in GD, and thyroid bruit or GO strongly suggest GD as well. 
3108 
TRAb may occasionally be measurable in patients with postpartum thyroiditis, 
3109 
suggesting that some patients may suffer from a combination of GD and destructive 
3110 
thyroiditis (509), but higher TRAb values are suggestive of GD. When in vivo testing is 
3111 
required to make this distinction in women who are nursing, the gamma-emitters 123-I 
3112 
(half-life 13 hours) or Tc-99m- pertechnetate (half-life 6 hours) should be used rather 
3113 
than the beta-emitter 131-I (half-life 8 days). The shorter half-lives of these agents (510) 
3114 
will allow breast milk to be pumped and discarded for 10 half-lives (5 or 3 days 
3115 
respectively) and nursing resumed, whereas breast-feeding should ideally be discontinued 
3116 
3 months prior to 131-I to avoid radiation exposure to the breast, and not be resumed if 
3117 
131-I is given as treatment for GD (511).  
3118 
   
Most often, the use of radioactive substances can be avoided and the diagnosis 
3119 
can be based on a combination of clinical presentation, TRAb measurement, and 
3120 
evaluation of serum T4 and T3. Thyroidal production of T3 compared with T4 is relatively 
3121 
high in GD, but not in destructive thyroiditis, and T3 tends to be fractionally more 
3122 
elevated above the upper reference limit than T4 in GD, whereas T4 is more elevated than 
3123 
T3 in destructive thyroiditis (50). If needed, thyroid color doppler ultrasonography may 
3124 
assist to distinguish between destructive thyroiditis and GD (508,512,513). 
3125 
■ RECOMMENDATION 97 
3126 
In women with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis from postpartum destructive thyroiditis, 
3127 
the judicious use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents is recommended. Strong 
3128 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3129 
 
Treatment for postpartum thyroiditis is generally supportive in nature, with the 
3130 
use of beta-adrenergic blockers such as propranolol or metroprolol to control pulse rate 
3131 
and hyperadrenergic symptoms during the thyrotoxic stage (514).  The selective beta-1 
3132 
adrenergic receptor-blocking agent atenolol should not be used in breast-feeding mothers 
3133 
because this may lead to symptoms consistent with beta-adrenergic blockage in neonates. 
3134 
This adverse effect presumably develops because atenolol is <5% bound to maternal 
3135 
plasma proteins (vs. 93 % binding of propranolol), and thus accumulates in milk, and 
3136 
because of low kidney excretion of atenolol in small children with immature renal 
3137 
function (515).  Levothyroxine therapy may be beneficial, at least transiently, for women 
3138 
with symptomatic hypothyroidism or having TSH levels >10 mU/L (506). 
3139 
  
Technical remarks: Because propranalol and metoprolol are secreted into breast 
3140 
milk in only very low levels, no special monitoring is needed for breastfed infants of 
3141 
mothers on these medications (514). 
3142 
■ RECOMMENDATION 98 
3143 
In pregnant women diagnosed with hyperthyroidism due to multinodular thyroid 
3144 
autonomy or a solitary toxic adenoma special care should be taken not to induce fetal 
3145 
hypothyroidism by ATD therapy.  Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3146 
 
Hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid autonomy is very common in people having 
3147 
current (or previous) mild to moderate iodine deficiency (13), but it mostly develops in 
3148 
patients after the age of 50 years. In the uncommon case of this type of hyperthyroidism 
3149 
in a pregnant woman, pathogenic differences from GD should be considered.  
3150 
 
Thyroid hormone production in autonomy is dependent on iodine substrate, 
3151 
but no study has addressed the effect of a change in iodine intake on thyroid 
3152 
function in pregnant women with autonomy, or on the fetus.  It might be beneficial 
3153 
to keep iodine intake on the low side, but care must be taken that the fetus is not 
3154 
iodine deficient, especially in areas where the population is iodine deficient.  The 
3155 
degree of maternal hyperthyroidism and assessment of her diet should be 
3156 
considered before deciding whether to administer iodine supplements. Often the 
3157 
hormone overproduction is limited in patients with autonomy (50). In mild cases there 
3158 
would be a theoretical possibility that the normal pregnancy associated increase in 
3159 
thyroid hormone production may catch up with the hormone production in the 
3160 
 autonomous areas of the thyroid, and alleviate the need for ATD therapy. On the other 
3161 
hand, the high hCG levels in early pregnancy may theoretically stimulate the non-
3162 
functioning normal thyroid tissue in these patients and worsen hyperthyroidism. Because 
3163 
there is no TRAb production, the fetal thyroid will not be abnormally stimulated in the 
3164 
second half of pregnancy as it is in GD. Thus, the fetus will not develop hyperthyroidism 
3165 
in parallel with the untreated hyperthyroid mother as it happens during 2nd half of 
3166 
pregnancy in GD, and neonatal hyperthyroidism is not a risk. On the other hand, the 
3167 
tendency to induce fetal hypothyroidism and goiter in the 2nd half of pregnancy from 
3168 
ATDs given to the mother would be even higher in this type of hyperthyroidism than in 
3169 
GD. Based on this theoretical risk, surgical therapy in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy may 
3170 
be considered if the hyperthyroidism turns out to require more than low dose MMI (5-10 
3171 
mg per day) for control. No firm recommendations are given, because no good evidence 
3172 
is available.  
3173 
 
3174 
[U] How should hyperthyroidism be managed in patients with Graves’ orbitopathy? 
3175 
 
GO is an inflammatory eye disease that develops in the orbit in association with 
3176 
autoimmune thyroid disorders (516). In the majority of cases (about 90%), it occurs in 
3177 
patients with current or past GD. Thyroid-associated orbitopathy, thyroid eye disease, and 
3178 
Graves’ ophthalmopathy are other names used for GO. Approximately a third of patients 
3179 
with Graves’ hyperthyroidism have some signs and/or symptoms of GO while only 5% 
3180 
suffer from moderate-to-severe disease (517,518). In contrast to GD where women are at 
3181 
higher risk, the role of gender in GO is more controversial. More recent studies do not 
3182 
 identify a clear gender related-risk for GO (517,518), while some older studies point to a 
3183 
possible slightly increased risk for men (519,520). This variability in results might be 
3184 
related to changes in smoking patterns over the years. The disease peaks in incidence in 
3185 
the 5th and 6th decade of life (517,518,521,522) with a higher prevalence of severe cases 
3186 
in the elderly population (517). 
3187 
[U1] Assessment of disease activity and severity 
3188 
 
The natural history of the disease is one of rapid deterioration followed by gradual 
3189 
improvement toward the baseline. This active phase is best described by the Clinical 
3190 
Activity Score (CAS) (523,524), the elements of which are outlined in Table 12. The 
3191 
score ranges from 0 to 10 and predicts response to anti-inflammatory therapies (523,524). 
3192 
A 7-point scale, lacking the last three elements, is used when no previous assessment is 
3193 
available. GO is considered active in patients with a CAS ≥ 3. However, some of the eye 
3194 
changes seen in hyperthyroidism, like lid retraction or stare, are the result of the increased 
3195 
sympathetic state and when present without associated eye changes are not considered to 
3196 
reflect GO (69).   
3197 
 
The severity of the disease is best assessed using objective, quantifiable 
3198 
parameters and is a useful tool for directing therapy. The main gradations of disease 
3199 
severity are mild, moderate-to-severe, and sight threatening (525). Table 13 lists the 
3200 
elements as agreed upon in a consensus statement by the European Group on Graves’ 
3201 
Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) (525). Both activity and severity of the disease must be 
3202 
considered in therapeutic decisions regarding treatment of the eye disease itself, as well 
3203 
as treatment of hyperthyroidism, keeping in mind that they do not always correlate, 
3204 
 particularly in early and late disease. The overall evaluation and management of GO is 
3205 
best done in a multidisciplinary clinic combining endocrinologists and ophthalmologists 
3206 
with expertise in the condition and other specialties in consultation (e.g., ENT, radiation 
3207 
therapy, plastic surgery, and endocrine surgery). 
3208 
 
Quality of life is clearly impaired by GO (526). The U.S. Food and Drug 
3209 
Administration has endorsed QoL information as a component of any therapeutic 
3210 
application. The QoL correlation with disease severity has been fair to excellent for two 
3211 
GO specific instruments published to date in North American populations (527,528), 
3212 
though the effect of GO therapy on these QoL scores still needs prospective data. 
3213 
Presently the only instrument that has such data is the instrument extensively used in 
3214 
Europe (529) that has not yet been tested in a North American population. Overall this 
3215 
area is in need of more research emphasis as despite its agreed upon importance a 
3216 
significant number of intervention trials in GO are still being reported without associated 
3217 
QOL outcomes (530). 
3218 
 
In the remainder of section [U], we discuss the prevention of GO and the 
3219 
management of hyperthyroidism in patients having established GO. In particular, we 
3220 
focus on recommendations regarding the concurrent use of corticosteroids in patients 
3221 
choosing RAI as treatment for hyperthyroidism (Table 14). 
3222 
[U2] Prevention of GO 
3223 
 
Current therapeutic approaches to GO, including local measures, corticosteroids, 
3224 
orbital radiation, and surgery (525), often fail to significantly improve the QoL of 
3225 
 patients with this debilitating condition. Therefore, efforts should be made to prevent the 
3226 
development or progression of GO in patients with Graves’ hyperthyroidism. Identified 
3227 
risk factors for GO are listed in Table 15 and most pertinent to this discussion are RAI 
3228 
therapy for hyperthyroidism (531,532), untreated hyperthyroidism, smoking, high serum 
3229 
pretreatment TRAb levels (normal < 1.75 IU/L, high risk for progression if  > 8.8 
3230 
IU/Liter) (533), and any delay in treating hypothyroidism after therapy for 
3231 
hyperthyroidism  (106,534). High pretreatment levels of T3 and T4 were each reported 
3232 
to have a predictive role in GO but these conclusions were not validated by subsequent 
3233 
studies (69,106,532,534) suggesting the possibility of higher TRAb values, measured on 
3234 
less sensitive assays early-on, being partly responsible for this variation. 
3235 
■ RECOMMENDATION 99 
3236 
Euthyroidism should be expeditiously achieved and maintained in hyperthyroid 
3237 
patients with GO or risk factors for the development of orbitopathy. Strong 
3238 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
3239 
 
A number of studies have suggested that development of persistent, untreated 
3240 
hypothyroidism after therapy for hyperthyroidism plays a detrimental role in the 
3241 
progression of GO. An early study noted that patients who were either hypo- or 
3242 
hyperthyroid had more severe GO than euthyroid patients (535). Subsequently, two 
3243 
cohort studies in which patients received levothyroxine therapy early after RAI with the 
3244 
specific intent of preventing hypothyroidism noted that deterioration of GO rarely 
3245 
occurred (0%–2%) (534,536). A randomized study of newly diagnosed GD found that 
3246 
RAI, followed by active prevention of hypothyroidism by administration of thyroid 
3247 
 hormone 2 weeks later, did not increase the risk of worsening GO compared to therapy 
3248 
with MMI (RR of 0.95) (69). 
3249 
■ RECOMMENDATION 100 
3250 
We recommend clinicians advise patients with GD to stop smoking and refer them to a 
3251 
structured smoking cessation program. As both firsthand and secondhand smoking 
3252 
increase GO risk patients exposed to secondhand smoke should be identified and 
3253 
advised of its negative impact. Strong recommendation, moderate- quality 
3254 
evidence. 
3255 
 
Smoking is the most important known risk factor for the development or 
3256 
worsening of GO, unrelated to type of therapy for GO (535), and consistent data from 
3257 
several studies show a detrimental effect of smoking on GO in patients treated with 
3258 
RAI (69,531). The risk is proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked per day and 
3259 
former smokers have significantly lower risk than current smokers, even after adjusting 
3260 
for lifetime cigarette consumption (537). 
3261 
 
Technical remarks: Clinicians should use smoking cessation programs based on 
3262 
effective and evidence-based approaches to aid in smoking cessation and avoidance of 
3263 
secondhand smoke (538,539). 
3264 
[U3] Treatment of hyperthyroidism in patients with no apparent GO 
3265 
■ RECOMMENDATION 101 
3266 
 In nonsmoking patients with GD without apparent GO, RAI therapy (without 
3267 
concurrent steroids), ATDs or thyroidectomy should be considered equally acceptable 
3268 
therapeutic options in regard to risk of GO.  Strong recommendation, moderate-
3269 
quality evidence. 
3270 
 
Several randomized trials have identified the risk of GO development or 
3271 
progression after RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism to be between 10% and 39% (69,540). 
3272 
Focusing on the risk of new GO development that risk appears to be lower. Two 
3273 
randomized controlled trials found that risk to be 6/78 (8%) for RAI, compared with 1/74 
3274 
(1%) for ATDs (531) in one study, and 10/32 (32%) for RAI compared with 6/56 (11%) 
3275 
for ATDs and 6/58 (10%) for surgery (532) in the older study. Fortunately, the cases of 
3276 
new or worse GO are usually mild with only 6/168 patients on this second trial (4 in the 
3277 
RAI group, 1 in the ATD group and 1 in the surgical group) requiring specific therapy for 
3278 
GO. In contrast, one prospective but nonrandomized cohort study identified no difference 
3279 
among ATD, surgery, and RAI treatment, with an overall 4.9–7.1% frequency of GO 
3280 
development (541). The higher risk of GO development after RAI therapy in the majority 
3281 
of studies may be related to the unique increase in TRAb levels observed following this 
3282 
therapy (172). Experimental evidence suggests that these antibodies are directly involved 
3283 
in GO pathogenesis (516,542,543). 
3284 
 
There is evidence that corticosteroids given concurrently with RAI may prevent 
3285 
worsening of GO in patients with mild active eye disease (531). However, there is 
3286 
insufficient evidence to recommend prophylactic treatment with corticosteroids in 
3287 
nonsmoking patients who do not have clinically apparent GO. The relatively low absolute 
3288 
 risk of nonsmokers developing new-onset severe GO suggests that GO prevention should 
3289 
not be a factor in the selection of therapy for hyperthyroidism in this group of patients 
3290 
(531). Table 14 details further the use of glucocorticoids for various GO clinical 
3291 
scenarios. 
3292 
■ RECOMMENDATION 102 
3293 
In smoking patients with GD without apparent GO, RAI therapy, ATDs, or 
3294 
thyroidectomy should be considered equally acceptable therapeutic options in regard 
3295 
to risk of GO. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3296 
■ RECOMMENDATION 103 
3297 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of prophylactic 
3298 
corticosteroids in smokers who receive RAI and have no evidence of GO.  No 
3299 
recommendation, insufficient evidence. 
3300 
 
However, in two different studies, active smokers who received RAI represented 
3301 
the group with the highest incidence (23–40%) of new GO or deterioration of pre-
3302 
existing GO during 1 year of follow-up (69,531).

■ RECOMMENDATION 104 
3306 
 In patients with Graves’ hyperthyroidism who have mild active ophthalmopathy and 
3307 
no risk factors for deterioration of their eye disease, RAI therapy, ATDs and 
3308 
thyroidectomy should be considered equally acceptable therapeutic options. Strong 
3309 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. 
3310 
■ RECOMMENDATION 105 
3311 
In the absence of any strong contraindication to GC use we suggest considering them 
3312 
for coverage of GD patients with mild active GO who are treated with RAI, even in 
3313 
the absence of risk factors for GO deterioration. Weak recommendation, low-quality 
3314 
evidence. 
3315 
 
Technical remarks: The decision whether or not to administer concurrent 
3316 
glucocorticoids in a particular patient choosing RAI therapy should be made in light of 
3317 
risk–benefit considerations (i.e., their personal risk of worsening GO, balanced against 
3318 
their risk of developing glucocorticoid side effects). Risk factors for side effects of oral 
3319 
corticosteroids include poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, psychiatric 
3320 
disease, and predisposition to infections. Smokers in whom the risk–benefit ratio for the 
3321 
concurrent use of corticosteroids is high may be better treated with ATDs or surgery. 
3322 
Besides smoking, the main risk factors for deterioration of GO to be considered in this 
3323 
decision include active and progressive GO over the preceding 3 months and high serum 
3324 
pretreatment TRAb levels (normal < 1.75 IU/L, high risk for GO progression if >8.8 
3325 
IU/Liter) (see Table 15). 
3326 
  
The dose of corticosteroids validated in a randomized clinical trial for GO 
3327 
prophylaxis is the equivalent of prednisone 0.4–0.5 mg/kg/day, started 1–3 days after 
3328 
RAI administration, continued for 1 month, and then tapered over 2 months (525). 
3329 
However, a retrospective cohort study suggested that even lower doses and shorter 
3330 
duration of oral prednisone (about 0.2 mg/kg/ day for 6 weeks) may be equally effective 
3331 
for prevention of GO exacerbation in patients with initially mild or absent eye disease, 
3332 
(544). Currently most task force members use a minimum starting dose of 30 mg 
3333 
prednisone daily and tapering to off within 6-8 weeks. Table 14 details further the use of 
3334 
glucocorticoids for various GO clinical scenarios. 
3335 
■ RECOMMENDATION 106 
3336 
In GD patients with mild GO who are treated with RAI we recommend steroid 
3337 
coverage if there are concomitant risk factors for GO deterioration. Strong 
3338 
recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

Unfortunately, the initial data regarding the impact of various GD therapies on 
3340 
GO outcome were impacted by the absence of GO activity assessment and lack of 
3341 
stratification on smoking status at randomization as well as by variation in the timing of 
3342 
tackling post-RAI hypothyroidism. Two early nonrandomized studies found no 
3343 
differences between the three GD therapeutic modalities (541,545). 
3344 
  
The first randomized study of GD patients (13% with mild preexistent GO) 
3345 
assigned to therapy for hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, surgery or RAI (532) 
3346 
found the relative risk for deterioration of eye disease to be elevated at 3.2 for RAI 
3347 
 compared to ATDs. There appeared to be no difference in such risk between ATDs and 
3348 
surgery. A more recent large randomized controlled trial studying mainly patients with 
3349 
previously treated GD showed RAI therapy to be associated with an increased risk of GO 
3350 
progression (RR of 5.8 in comparison with ATDs) and found the risk to be eliminated 
3351 
with concurrent corticosteroid administration (531). Finally, the most recent randomized 
3352 
controlled trial (69) revealed the increased risk for new or worse GO in RAI treated 
3353 
patients (38.7% of the group) compared with ATD-treated patients (21.3% of the group), 
3354 
to be mainly related to development of new GO cases while worsening of preexistent GO 
3355 
occurred in a similar percentage in both groups (45% for RAI and 47% for ATD). 
3356 
Smoking was a strong risk factor for an undesirable GO outcome. In this last trial there 
3357 
was no routine use of prophylactic glucocorticoids. Table 14 details further the use of 
3358 
glucocorticoids for various GO clinical scenarios.

3360 
sight-threatening GO (see Tables 12 and 13 for definitions of disease activity and 
3361 
severity) 
3362 
■ RECOMMENDATION 107 
3363 
In patients with active and moderate to severe or sight-threatening GO we recommend 
3364 
against RAI therapy. Surgery or ATDs are preferred treatment options for GD in these 
3365 
patients. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3366 
 
We are aware of no trials in patients with moderate-to-severe and active eye 
3367 
disease that compare hyperthyroidism therapies for impact on GO. However, a 
3368 
 comparison of two different surgical approaches (total thyroidectomy vs. subtotal 
3369 
thyroidectomy) for patients with moderate-to-severe GO showed that the eye disease 
3370 
improved over 3 years of follow-up in all patients (546). In another series of 42 patients 
3371 
with progressive GO treated with total thyroidectomy, exophthalmos was stable in 60% 
3372 
of cases and improved in the remainder (547), suggesting that surgery is not detrimental 
3373 
to GO and may be associated with improvement in some patients. Additionally, a more 
3374 
recent study suggests that surgery might lead to a more rapid improvement in GO than 
3375 
ATDs and it might thus be a better option for patients that are most concerned about GO 
3376 
changes (548). Other studies suggest that ATDs may not adversely impact mild active 
3377 
GO, but do not address severe GO (531). 
3378 
 
Alternatively, if ATDs are selected for GD therapy there is reassuring data that 
3379 
long term use is relatively safe and effective at preserving euthyroidism while waiting for 
3380 
GO to enter remission (66,549).

3382 
disease inactivity) 
3383 
■ RECOMMENDATION 108 
3384 
 In patients with inactive GO we suggest RAI therapy can be administered without 
3385 
steroid coverage. However, in cases of elevated risk for reactivation (high TRAb, CAS 
3386 
≥1 and smokers) that approach might have to be reconsidered. Weak 
3387 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3388 
  
There is a low rate of GO progression or reactivation following RAI in patients 
3389 
with inactive GO.  A series of 72 patients with inactive GO according to the CAS were 
3390 
treated with RAI without concurrent glucocorticoid administration (536). In those whom 
3391 
hypothyroidism was prevented by early thyroxine therapy, no deterioration in eye disease 
3392 
was reported (536). Smoking history did not impact GO outcome in this cohort. A recent 
3393 
trial from Japan (540) randomized patients without GO or inactive GO (i.e. CAS<3 or 
3394 
T2-weighted imaging T2SIR ≤1) to receive either glucocorticoid prophylaxis with low 
3395 
dose prednisolone (on average 0.28 mg/kg/day tapered rapidly over 6 weeks) or no 
3396 
prophylaxis at all. The rate of disease progression in the absence of risk factors was low 
3397 
(4.2%) and not impacted by glucocorticoid therapy. The presence of risk factors for GO 
3398 
(high thyroid stimulating antibody, CAS≥1) increased that risk, again without a benefit 
3399 
from low-dose steroid prophylaxis. Ultimately most GO cases were mild and only 7 cases 
3400 
(2.4%) required GO-directed therapy. Whether high-dose glucocorticoid therapy would 
3401 
have made a difference in these patients is not known. 
3402 
  
Another study retrospectively examined the impact of concurrent oral or 
3403 
intravenous glucocorticoid therapy on the development or deterioration of preexistent GO 
3404 
after RAI therapy for relapsing GD patients (550). They identified GO development, 
3405 
deterioration or reactivation in approximately 7% of patients (6/83) considered at low risk 
3406 
who were given no steroid prophylaxis. Only 2 of these cases had preexistent inactive 
3407 
GO. Despite prophylaxis, 33% of patients considered at high risk who were treated with 
3408 
oral glucocorticoids had worsening of GO. However, because of the lack of clarity of this 
3409 
retrospective study regarding prevalence of active and inactive GO in each group and the 
3410 
lack of pre-specified criteria for dose and route of steroid use in those considered at risk, 
3411 
 we weighed this evidence less in our deliberations regarding the above recommendation. 
3412

[V] How should iodine–induced and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis be managed? 
3415 
[V1] Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism 
3416 
■ RECOMMENDATION 109 
3417 
Routine administration of ATDs before iodinated contrast media exposure is not 
3418 
recommended for all patients. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3419 
 
Technical remarks:  Patients deemed to be at high risk of developing iodine-
3420 
induced hyperthyroidism or whose cardiac status is tenuous at baseline may be 
3421 
considered for prophylactic therapy with ATDs. 
3422 
 
Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (the Jod-Basedow phenomenon) is uncommon in 
3423 
modern series, and generally self-limited, but may occasionally persist for months 
3424 
(551,552), and may be life-threatening (553-556).  Individuals most susceptible are 
3425 
elderly patients with autonomously-functioning nodular goiters (557), and less 
3426 
commonly, patients with occult GD (558), or patients with a prior history of GD and in 
3427 
remission after a course of ATDs (559).  Very rarely, iodine excess may trigger 
3428 
thyrotoxicosis in patients with a previously normal thyroid gland (560).  Chronic iodine 
3429 
deficiency increases the prevalence of autonomous thyroid nodules and therefore iodine 
3430 
 repletion in this setting has historically been linked to iodine-induced hyperthyroidism 
3431 
(561). 
3432 
 
Multiple observational studies have examined changes in thyroid hormone levels 
3433 
following a single exposure to intravenous iodinated contrast in both iodine-sufficient 
3434 
(562-565), and deficient (566-569) regions.  A study of patients living in Boston showed 
3435 
that 5 of 49 (10.2%) developed a suppressed TSH value 1-4 weeks following exposure to 
3436 
a single CT study with contrast, with only one patient developing overt hyperthyroidism 
3437 
(565).  Additional observational studies in the United States and Japan, involving 56 and 
3438 
22 patients, respectively, found no new cases of hyperthyroidism following coronary 
3439 
angiography (564) or hysterosalpingography (563), whereas an Australian study from a 
3440 
region of iodine sufficiency found that 2 of 72 (2.8%) of patients developed overt 
3441 
hyperthyroidism and an additional 2 developed subclinical hyperthyroidism within 8 
3442 
weeks of iodinated contrast exposure (562). Overall, similar rates of iodine-induced 
3443 
hyperthyroidism have been described in iodine deficient regions, including a study from 
3444 
Germany in which 2 of 788 (0.25%) patients developed overt hyperthyroidism following 
3445 
coronary angiography (566), a New Zealand study in which subclinical hyperthyroidism 
3446 
developed in 2 of 102 (2%) patients after a CT-scan with iodinated contrast (567), a study 
3447 
from Italy which found that 1.9% of 1752 patients undergoing coronary angiography 
3448 
developed a suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3 levels (568), and finally, a 
3449 
Turkish study identifying new subclinical hyperthyroidism in 5.9% of 101 patients by 8 
3450 
weeks following coronary angiography (569).   
3451 
  
A recent case-control study in the United States found that iodinated contrast 
3452 
exposure in patients without baseline thyroid abnormality resulted in hyperthyroidism 
3453 
(defined only as a suppressed TSH value) with an odds ratio of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.08-3.60; 
3454 
P = .03), and that 23 patients would need to be exposed before encountering one case of 
3455 
iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (570). Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis including 9 
3456 
randomized-controlled trials and 8 observational studies involving iodine 
3457 
supplementation of young children and pregnant women in regions of mild-moderate 
3458 
iodine deficiency did not find an increased risk of thyroid dysfunction following iodine 
3459 
supplementation of 200-300 micrograms daily (571).   
3460 
 
In summary, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is uncommon and generally 
3461 
subclinical, but can occasionally be severe. For most clinical circumstances, the 
3462 
likelihood of developing overt thyrotoxicosis after iodinated contrast exposure is too low 
3463 
to justify the risk of adverse effects associated with prophylactic ATD therapy.  
3464 
■ RECOMMENDATION 110 
3465 
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents alone or in combination with MMI should be used to 
3466 
treat overt iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
3467 
evidence. 
3468 
 
Treatment of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism includes avoidance of additional 
3469 
iodine and administration of beta-blockers alone or with ATDs, depending on the severity 
3470 
of hyperthyroidism and the clinical status of the patient.  RAI is not an option until the 
3471 
iodine load has been cleared and might not be desirable given the reversibility of this 
3472 
 condition.  Recent data suggest that urinary iodine normalizes more rapidly than 
3473 
previously believed, with a return to baseline urinary iodine excretion within 1-2 months 
3474 
in most patients (565,572).  
3475 
 
Technical remarks: Dosing of MMI for iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis is 20–40 
3476 
mg daily, given either as a daily or twice-daily dosing. There may be relative resistance 
3477 
to ATD in patients with iodine-induced hyperthyroidism.  Urinary iodine (a spot urine 
3478 
iodine adjusted for urine creatinine concentration or a 24-hour urine iodine) may be 
3479 
monitored to assess the rate of clearance of the iodine load. 
3480 
[V2] Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis 
3481 
■ RECOMMENDATION 111 
3482 
We suggest monitoring thyroid function tests before and within the first 3 months 
3483 
following the initiation of amiodarone therapy, and at 3–6 month intervals thereafter. 
3484 
Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 
3485 
 
Amiodarone is a drug frequently used in the treatment of refractory atrial or 
3486 
ventricular tachyarrhymias. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs in up to 6% 
3487 
of patients taking this medication in iodine-sufficient areas of the world (573-575) and in 
3488 
up to 10% in iodine-deficient areas, such as parts of Europe (576). Studies evaluating the 
3489 
adequacy of monitoring for adverse effects from amiodarone have shown suboptimal 
3490 
results (577,578). 
3491 
          Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed in the development of AIT, 
3492 
including an iodine-induced form of hyperthyroidism (type 1 AIT) due to the high 
3493 
iodine content of amiodarone (37% by molecular weight), and a destructive 
3494 
thyroiditis (type 2 AIT), due to direct toxicity of amiodarone on follicular cells. Type 
3495 
1 AIT tends to occur in patients with underlying thyroid autonomy in a nodular 
3496 
goiter, or GD, whereas type 2 AIT occurs as a result of direct damage or induction 
3497 
of apoptosis in thyrocytes by amiodarone (579-582).  
3498 
■ RECOMMENDATION 112 
3499 
The decision to stop amiodarone in the setting of thyrotoxicosis should be determined 
3500 
on an individual basis in consultation with the treating cardiologist, based on the 
3501 
clinical manifestations and presence or absence of effective alternative antiarrhythmic 
3502 
therapy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3503 
 
The need for amiodarone discontinuation is controversial because (i) this drug is 
3504 
frequently the only medication able to control cardiac arrhythmia, (ii) the effects of this 
3505 
fat soluble drug may persist for many months,  (iii) amiodarone may have T3-antagonistic 
3506 
properties at the cardiac level and inhibit T4 to T3 conversion in the heart (583) , such that 
3507 
withdrawal may actually aggravate cardiac manifestations of thyrotoxicosis (573). Deaths 
3508 
from ventricular fibrillation have occurred after stopping amiodarone in patients with 
3509 
AIT (584).  In addition, type 2 AIT typically responds to treatment even if amiodarone 
3510 
therapy is continued (585-587), but continuation may lead to a more prolonged time to 
3511 
recovery and a higher rate of future recurrences of AIT (588). 
3512 
 ■ RECOMMENDATION 113 
3513 
In clinically stable patients with AIT, we suggest testing to identify disorders 
3514 
associated with iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (type 1 AIT), specifically including 
3515 
toxic nodular disease and previously occult Graves’ disease. Strong 
3516 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3517 
■ RECOMMENDATION 114 
3518 
MMI should be used to treat overt thyrotoxicosis in patients with proven underlying 
3519 
autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves’ disease as the cause of amiodarone-induced 
3520 
thyrotoxicosis (type 1 disease), and corticosteroids should be used to treat patients 
3521 
with overt amiodarone-induced thyroiditis (type 2 disease). Strong recommendation, 
3522 
low-quality evidence. 
3523 
■ RECOMMENDATION 115 
3524 
Combined ATD and corticosteroid therapy should be used to treat patients with overt 
3525 
amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis who are too unstable clinically to allow a trial of 
3526 
monotherapy, or who fail to respond to single modality therapy, or patients in whom 
3527 
the etiology of thyrotoxicosis cannot be unequivocally determined. Strong 
3528 
recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3529 
 
  
3530 
 
As the pathogenesis of AIT is not fully understood, it is likely that the classic 
3531 
division of AIT into two subtypes represents an oversimplification.  First, as discussed 
3532 
 further below, many patients are not readily classified into one of the two AIT subtypes. 
3533 
Secondly, once classified as type 1 or type 2 AIT, patients often fail to respond to therapy 
3534 
specifically directed to that subtype (583,589,590). Finally, findings of responsiveness of 
3535 
type 2 AIT patients to measures not typically useful in destructive thyroiditis, such as 
3536 
perchlorate (586,591) and oral cholecystographic agents (592,593), cannot be adequately 
3537 
explained on the basis of the current classification system, although spontaneous 
3538 
resolution independent of therapy is one possible explanation.  
3539 
 
A number of methods have been examined to distinguish type 1 from type 2 AIT, 
3540 
but with the possible exception of Color flow Doppler study (CFDS), most are considered 
3541 
unreliable (574).  For example, the T3-to-T4 ratio, which tends to be higher in patients 
3542 
with autonomous thyroid glands than in those with destructive thyroiditis, is not helpful 
3543 
in this instance due to amiodarone-associated inhibition of T4 monodeiodination (594).  
3544 
Further, features historically used to distinguish the subtypes such as antibodies against 
3545 
thyroid peroxidase and the presence of thyroid nodules in patients with type 1 AIT may 
3546 
actually occur with both subtypes, given the prevalence of these abnormalities in the 
3547 
general population.  Interleukin-6 levels and radioactive iodine uptake values, once 
3548 
promoted as useful to distinguish between subtypes (590), actually overlap extensively 
3549 
between the two subtypes and are therefore also not useful (594).  Several modern series 
3550 
of patients with AIT make no attempt to classify patients into type 1 or type 2 disease 
3551 
(585,595-598). 
3552 
 
Several studies have shown that increased vascularity on color-flow Doppler 
3553 
study may be seen in patients with type 1, but not type 2 AIT (599-601). Two studies 
3554 
 showed a clear separation into type 1 and type 2 AIT, allowing successful application of 
3555 
targeted therapy (599,600). However, CFDS is not universally useful (584,589)  In a 
3556 
series of 24 cases of AIT, 12 patients were classified as type 2 due to an absence of 
3557 
vascularity (CFDS 0) and treated with corticosteroids, but only 7 (58%) proved 
3558 
responsive (584). Likewise, these authors found that among 11 patients classified as type 
3559 
1 AIT based on CFDS scores of I-III, only 4 (36%) responded to antithyroid drug 
3560 
therapy.  In another series of 30 patients with AIT requiring therapy, 10 (33%) patients 
3561 
could not be subtyped on the basis of CFDS, including several patients with goiters but 
3562 
normal vascular flow (589). In a series of 55 patients in whom a CFDS qualitative 
3563 
assessment of vascular flow was used to distinguish type 1 from type 2 AIT, 81.3% of 
3564 
patients determined to have type 1 AIT had pattern I vascularity (the lowest level above 
3565 
zero), illustrating the skill and nuance needed to successfully make this distinction (599). 
3566 
Among European thyroidologists surveyed on the use of diagnostic imaging in the 
3567 
differential diagnosis of AIT, approximately 20% preferred RAIU alone, 20% preferred 
3568 
CFDS alone, nearly 40% utilized both methods simultaneously, and 20% thought both 
3569 
techniques were useless (602).  Recently sestamibi uptake by the thyroid, which is 
3570 
diminished with thyroiditis, has been applied to distinguishing AIT subtypes with 
3571 
preliminarily promising results (603,604). 
3572 
 
A recent retrospective report including 200 AIT patients found that the onset of 
3573 
thyrotoxicosis was significantly earlier in type 1 (median 3.5 months, range 1-61 months) 
3574 
than type 2 (median 30 months, range 1-95 months), p< 0.001 (605).  Since 80% of type 
3575 
1 patients in this study had autonomous thyroid nodules or toxic MNG, it is not 
3576 
unexpected that iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis occurred early in the course of amiodarone 
3577 
 therapy.  However, based on this data, a patient with late-onset of AIT in whom GD has 
3578 
been excluded is more likely to have type 2 AIT.   Another observation reported in this 
3579 
study is the development of AIT following amiodarone discontinuation.  Nineteen 
3580 
percent of patients (38/200) developed AIT a mean of 5.5 months after the drug was 
3581 
stopped, 36 of whom had type 2 AIT. 
3582 
 
Patients who are clinically stable and have definite evidence supporting a distinct 
3583 
subtype of overt AIT may be tried on appropriate monotherapy. When identified with 
3584 
certainty, type 1 AIT is best treated with MMI to prevent new hormone synthesis and, 
3585 
rarely, with added potassium perchlorate (250 mg four times daily; not  available in the 
3586 
United States) (590). Type 2 AIT is better treated with anti-inflammatory therapy such as 
3587 
prednisone, with improvement occasionally seen as early as 1 week, and usually within a 
3588 
few weeks (590). As noted above, some patients with mild type 2 AIT (approximately 
3589 
20%) resolve spontaneously without stopping amiodarone or administering 
3590 
corticosteroids (606,607).  
3591 
 
Most series of patients with AIT contain cases in which sequential therapy for 
3592 
both subtypes was required before resolution of AIT occurred.  These patients are 
3593 
frequently referred to as “mixed” types of AIT.  In a study of 20 patients with AIT that 
3594 
included both type 1 and type 2 patients, perchlorate was administered alone for 1 month, 
3595 
resulting in euthyroidism in 12 patients (7 with type 1 AIT and 5 with type 2 AIT) (591). 
3596 
Corticosteroids were then given to the eight nonresponders (including 7 patients with 
3597 
presumed type 1 disease), and euthyroidism was achieved in all after an average of 
3598 
approximately 6 weeks (591). Patients are often reclassified retrospectively from type 1 
3599 
 to type 2 AIT based on a positive response to corticosteroid therapy or after an outcome 
3600 
of permanent hypothyroidism, both of which would be unlikely in iodine-induced 
3601 
thyrotoxicosis (598,606).  Patients recovering from apparent type 2 AIT should be 
3602 
monitored for permanent hypothyroidism, which appears to occur more often with AIT 
3603 
than with subacute thyroiditis (608). 
3604 
 
Importantly, individuals with moderate thyrotoxicosis and compromised cardiac 
3605 
status should be considered for initial combined therapy rather than sequential empiric 
3606 
therapy. Some centers recommend starting combined therapy with antithyroid drugs and 
3607 
corticosteroids at the time of initial AIT diagnosis (594,609), and between 16-25% of 
3608 
surveyed thyroidologists prefer combination antithyroid drug and corticosteroid therapy 
3609 
for patients with apparent type 2 AIT (610). A rapid response to combined corticosteroid 
3610 
and antithyroid drug therapy is believed to favor type 2 AIT (594) and allows a reduction 
3611 
in antithyroid drugs, although some patients with type 2 AIT have a prolonged course, 
3612 
particularly those with larger thyroids or worse thyrotoxicosis at the time of diagnosis 
3613 
(611). A suggested approach to the management of AIT is shown in Figure 1.  
3614 
 
Technical remarks: The suggested starting dose of MMI in this setting is 40 mg 
3615 
once daily until the patient is euthyroid (generally 3–6 months). If high doses of MMI 
3616 
continue to be required, splitting the dose may be more effective. The suggested dose of 
3617 
corticosteroids in this setting is equivalent to 40 mg prednisone given once daily for 2–4 
3618 
weeks, followed by a gradual taper over 2–3 months, based on the patient’s clinical 
3619 
response. 
3620 
■ RECOMMENDATION 116 
3621 
 Patients with AIT who are unresponsive to aggressive medical therapy with MMI and 
3622 
corticosteroids should undergo thyroidectomy. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
3623 
evidence. 
3624 
 
Patients with AIT who fail to respond to medical therapy should be offered 
3625 
thyroidectomy before they become excessively debilitated from inadequately controlled 
3626 
thyrotoxicosis. The patient should be counseled that while thyroidectomy in this setting 
3627 
carries with it significant morbidity and a high mortality rate (9%), delay or deferral of 
3628 
surgery imparts an even higher risk of death (612). Thyroidectomy done under regional 
3629 
anesthesia when available may be preferred for very ill patients (613). Several surgical 
3630 
series involving patients with AIT have now been published, with generally favorable 
3631 
results (612,614-616).  Patients in whom amiodarone was stopped during an episode of 
3632 
AIT should be considered for definitive therapy with RAI or surgery in order to facilitate 
3633 
reintroduction of amiodarone without concerns about recurrent AIT (617). 
3634 
 
3635 
[W] How should thyrotoxicosis due to destructive thyroiditis be managed? 
3636 
 
Several varieties of thyroiditis can present with temporary thyrotoxicosis as part 
3637 
of a classic triphasic course (thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, recovery), including 
3638 
subacute thyroiditis, painless (silent) thyroiditis, acute (suppurative) thyroiditis, palpation 
3639 
(traumatic) thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, and drug-induced thyroiditis. In general, 
3640 
thyroid dysfunction caused by thyroiditis is less severe than that seen with other forms of 
3641 
endogenous thyrotoxicosis (50); RAIU is universally low during the thyrotoxic stage, 
3642 
 owing to leaking of preformed thyroid hormone with suppression of serum TSH 
3643 
concentrations.  In this section, subacute, painless, acute and palpation thyroiditis will be 
3644 
discussed; see section [T4] for a discussion of postpartum and section [X] for a 
3645 
discussion of drug-induced thyroiditis. 
3646 
[W1] Subacute thyroiditis 
3647 
 
Subacute thyroiditis, also called subacute granulomatous or de Quervain 
3648 
thyroiditis, is a common cause of thyroid pain (24).   The diagnosis of subacute 
3649 
thyroiditis is based on clinical history, physical examination, laboratory data, and RAIU. 
3650 
Subacute thyroiditis presents with moderate-to-severe pain in the thyroid, often radiating 
3651 
to the ears, jaw, or throat. The pain may begin focally and spread from one side to the 
3652 
other of the gland over several weeks. Patients may have a prodrome of malaise, low-
3653 
grade fever, pharyngitis symptoms, and fatigue. The thyroid may be slightly enlarged, 
3654 
and is firm and painful to palpation.  Subacute thyroiditis is thought to be due to a sequela 
3655 
of an upper respiratory viral infection that involves the thyroid gland.  
3656 
 
About 50% of patients with subacute thyroiditis have an initial thyrotoxic phase 
3657 
due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone from damaged thyroid 
3658 
follicular cells (24).  Therefore, early in the course of the disease, patients may have 
3659 
clinical findings of thyrotoxicosis, although this is often mild.  The serum TSH level is 
3660 
suppressed, and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially to the total T3 level, in 
3661 
contrast to other endogenous forms of thyrotoxicosis, although there is substantial 
3662 
overlap among the etiologies (618).  In addition to laboratory evidence of thyrotoxicosis, 
3663 
the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated, and mild 
3664 
 anemia and elevation of the white blood count (wbc) are common. Up to 25% of patients 
3665 
have low concentrations of anti-thyroid antibodies (24,619,620).  RAIU is low, as is 
3666 
uptake on a thyroid scintigram.  Thyroid ultrasonography shows diffuse heterogeneity, 
3667 
focal hypoechoic areas, and decreased or normal color-flow Doppler, rather than the 
3668 
enhanced flow characteristic of GD (621,622).  A biopsy of the thyroid gland is not 
3669 
usually necessary in subacute thyroiditis.  However, if a biopsy is performed due to 
3670 
uncertainty of the diagnosis, its result shows granulomatous infiltrate and giant cells, 
3671 
consistent with a viral infection (24). 
3672 
 
The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3-6 weeks, ending when the thyroid stores of 
3673 
preformed hormone are depleted.  About 30% of patients subsequently enter a 
3674 
hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months.  Thyroid pain and the elevated ESR have 
3675 
usually resolved by this time, and the predominant clinical features are those of 
3676 
hypothyroidism with a small nontender goiter.  Most patients become euthyroid again 
3677 
within 12 months of disease onset, although 5-15% have persistent hypothyroidism 
3678 
(24,620,621).   In addition, recurrence rates of 1-4% have been reported (24,620,623).   
3679 
■ RECOMMENDATION 117 
3680 
Patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with 
3681 
beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. 
3682 
Corticosteroids should be used instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents when 
3683 
patients fail to respond, or present initially with moderate to severe pain and/or 
3684 
thyrotoxic symptoms. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3685 
  
Subacute thyroiditis is treated with beta-blockers and anti-inflammatory therapy. 
3686 
Beta-blockers are used as needed to control thyrotoxic symptoms.  Nonsteroidal anti-
3687 
inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) provide pain relief in patients with mild symptoms, and 
3688 
should be considered first-line therapy. With NSAIDs, the median time for resolution of 
3689 
pain is 5 weeks (range 1-20 weeks) (24).  Patients who fail to respond to full doses of 
3690 
NSAIDs over several days should be treated instead with corticosteroid therapy.   
3691 
Standard recommendations are to use prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by 
3692 
a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer, depending upon clinical response. A 
3693 
retrospective review found that patients treated with corticosteroids at similar doses had 
3694 
more rapid resolution of pain (mean duration, 8 days) compared with those treated with 
3695 
NSAIDs (mean duration, 35 days). However, symptoms can recur as the dose of 
3696 
corticosteroid is reduced (24).   A more recent study reported that a lower initial daily 
3697 
dose of 15 mg of prednisolone, with tapering by 5 mg every two weeks, was effective.  
3698 
However, 20% of patients required longer than 8 weeks to discontinue the glucocorticoid 
3699 
(624).   Levothyroxine may be employed during the hypothyroid stage, but should be 
3700 
withdrawn after 3–6 months with recovery of normal function verified by thyroid 
3701 
function testing.  ATDs have no role in the treatment of subacute thyroiditis. 
3702 
[W2] Painless thyroiditis 
3703 
 
Painless or silent thyroiditis classically presents with the same triphasic course 
3704 
described for subacute thyroiditis, but with no prodrome, neck pain, or elevated ESR, 
3705 
white blood cell count, or CRP (625). The postpartum period is the most common time 
3706 
when painless thyroiditis is seen, but painless thyroiditis can also occur in nonpregnant 
3707 
 women and in men.  Painless thyroiditis has been described in some types of drug-
3708 
induced thyroid dysfunction, including that associated with lithium or cytokine therapy.  
3709 
Postpartum and drug-induced thyroiditis are discussed in detail in sections [T4] and [X], 
3710 
respectively.  A small nontender goiter is common in all types of painless thyroiditis. 
3711 
 
The thyrotoxic phase occurs in 5-20% of patients and typically lasts 3-4 months.  
3712 
The hypothyroid phase is more common, or at least is recognized more often, lasting up 
3713 
to 6 months.  Normal thyroid function is reestablished by 12 months in most patients, but 
3714 
10-20% have persistent hypothyroidism.  Recurrence rates are about 5-10%, but may be 
3715 
higher in Japan, with one Japanese study reporting a long-term recurrence rate of 65% 
3716 
(626).  Recurrences are managed in the same manner as the initial occurrence, but rare 
3717 
patients with multiple recurrences have opted for surgery or RAI ablation of the gland 
3718 
following recovery from the thyrotoxic phase (626).   
3719 
 
Painless thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune disease manifested by positive 
3720 
anti-TPO antibodies in about 50% of patients and findings of lymphocytic infiltration on 
3721 
pathology (626,627).  During the thyrotoxic phase, the serum TSH level is suppressed 
3722 
and free T4 levels are elevated, often out of proportion to T3 levels.  Patients with painless 
3723 
thyroiditis have a low RAIU and low uptake on a thyroid scintigram during the thyrotoxic 
3724 
phase, and ultrasound often shows inhomogeneous hypoechogenic texture with decreased 
3725 
blood flow.  These tests and the absence of TRAb antibodies help distinguish painless 
3726 
thyroiditis from GD (628). 
3727 
■ RECOMMENDATION 118 
3728 
 Patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis should be treated 
3729 
with beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs to control symptoms. Strong recommendation, 
3730 
low-quality evidence. 
3731 
 
Beta-adrenergic blockers can be used to treat thyrotoxic symptoms in patients 
3732 
with painless thyroiditis, but ATDs have no utility, since new hormone synthesis is 
3733 
already low in these patients. Rarely, corticosteroids have been used to ameliorate the 
3734 
severity and the time course of thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis (629), but they 
3735 
should be reserved only for more severe cases.  
3736 
[W3] Acute thyroiditis 
3737 
■ RECOMMENDATION 119 
3738 
Acute thyroiditis should be treated with antibiotics and surgical drainage as 
3739 
determined by clinical judgement.  Beta blockers may be used to treat symptoms of 
3740 
thyrotoxicosis. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3741 
 
Patients with acute thyroiditis (also referred to as suppurative thyroiditis or 
3742 
thyroid abscess) are generally euthyroid. However, on occasion, the condition presents as 
3743 
destructive thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis (630). Ultrasound or CT examinations are 
3744 
usually diagnostic, showing hypoechoic lesions in and around the affected thyroid lobe, 
3745 
destruction of the lobe, and abscess formation.  However, early in the process, radiologic 
3746 
examination may be nonspecific, often leading to the erroneous diagnoses of subacute 
3747 
thyroiditis (631).  The etiology of acute thyroiditis is most frequently a bacterial infection 
3748 
affecting the thyroid, either through hematogenous spread or direct extension through a 
3749 
 fistula from an infected pyriform sinus. Therapy involves systemic antibiotics as well as 
3750 
abscess drainage or removal, and excision or occlusion of the offending pyriform sinus. 
3751 
Thyrotoxicosis should be treated symptomatically with beta-blocking agents. As in other 
3752 
forms of destructive thyroiditis, there is no role for ATDs. 
3753 
[W4] Palpation thyroiditis 
3754 
 
In 1975, Carney et al described a nonspecific multifocal granulomatous folliculitis 
3755 
in thyroid glands removed at surgery for thyroid-related or unrelated conditions (632).  
3756 
They named this pathologic entity “palpation thyroiditis,” concluding that it was due to 
3757 
palpation of the thyroid gland at surgery.  It was generally thought to be of little clinical 
3758 
importance, except for rare case reports of patients who developed thyrotoxicosis 
3759 
following manipulation of the thyroid gland during surgery (633-636).  However, a recent 
3760 
study suggested that the rate of transient overt or subclinical thyrotoxicosis following 
3761 
parathyroid surgery may be as high as 30%, although there was likely ascertainment bias 
3762 
because not all patients had post-operative TSH levels measured (637).  There are no data 
3763 
on treatment of palpation thyroiditis, although the use of beta blockers for symptomatic 
3764 
thyrotoxicosis seems reasonable. 
3765 
 
3766 
[X] How should other causes of thyrotoxicosis be managed? 
3767 
     Tables 16 and 17 summarize drug-associated and unusual causes of thyrotoxicosis. 
3768 
■ RECOMMENDATION 120 
3769 
 Patients taking medications known to cause thyrotoxicosis, including interferon- α, IL-
3770 
2, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and lithium, should be monitored clinically and 
3771 
biochemically at 6-month intervals for the development of thyroid dysfunction.  
3772 
Patients who develop thyrotoxicosis should be evaluated to determine etiology and 
3773 
treated accordingly. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3774 
[X1] Interferon- α and interleukin-2 
3775 
 
Interferon-α (IFN-α) and interleukin-2-treated patients are at increased risk for 
3776 
developing thyrotoxicosis, especially those with pre-existing thyroid autoimmunity. A 
3777 
recent study including 1233 patients who were euthyroid at baseline found that 79 (6.4%) 
3778 
patients developed a biphasic thyroiditis and an additional 57 (4.6%) patients developed a 
3779 
suppressed TSH value (638). The latter group included 33 patients with mild TSH 
3780 
suppression and 24 with a TSH value < 0.1 mU/L, among whom 11 had free T4 elevation 
3781 
and 5 required antithyroid drug therapy (638). Thyrotoxicosis in patients treated with 
3782 
IFN-α can be due to either painless thyroiditis or GD (639). In a review of published 
3783 
cases from 8 series, 69% of 49 patients with IFN-α-associated thyrotoxicosis, for whom 
3784 
an etiology was identified, were found to have GD, based on either positive TRAb titers 
3785 
or requirement for a prolonged course of ATDs (640). An earlier literature review found 
3786 
that 2.4% of 1664 patients treated with IFN-α therapy for hepatitis C infection developed 
3787 
thyrotoxicosis, although the specific etiology was not consistently identified (641).   
3788 
[X2] Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors  
3789 
  
The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib (642-647), sorafenib (648-650), and 
3790 
nilotinib (651) have each been associated with a transient thyrotoxicosis due to 
3791 
destructive thyroiditis.  One study of 69 patients treated with sorafenib for metastatic 
3792 
renal cell carcinoma found that 11 (16%) developed transient thyroiditis followed by 
3793 
hypothyroidism (649).  Another study found that 6 of 31 (19.3%) receiving sunitinib 
3794 
therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma developed thyrotoxicosis, including one case 
3795 
of thyroid storm (644). 
3796 
[X3] Lithium 
3797 
 
Patients taking lithium for bipolar disorder are at a high risk of developing thyroid 
3798 
dysfunction, including both hypothyroidism, and to a lesser extent, thyrotoxicosis (652). 
3799 
Two published series have identified the development of thyrotoxicosis in 0.6% and 3.0% 
3800 
of patients, respectively (653,654).  An epidemiological study of hyperthyroidism 
3801 
occurring over a 3-year period in Denmark identified lithium-associated thyrotoxicosis as 
3802 
the etiology in 0.7% of all cases (432).   A case series of 24 patients with lithium-
3803 
associated thyrotoxicosis identified GD in 12 (50%), painless thyroiditis in two patients, 
3804 
toxic multinodular goiter in 3 patients, and no identified etiology in 7 patients (655).  
3805 
Another more recent series found that 1.4% of referrals to a thyroid clinic over a 12-year 
3806 
period were for lithium related thyrotoxicosis (656).  Patients in this series had been 
3807 
taking lithium for a median duration of 6 years (range 0.6-25 years), and 87% were 
3808 
women.  Diagnostic evaluation found that 11 (47.8%) had GD, 9 (39%) had painless 
3809 
thyroiditis, 2 had toxic MNG, and one patient had subacute thyroiditis (656).  A smaller 
3810 
series described three cases of GD occurring in patients receiving lithium (657). In a 
3811 
 retrospective review of 100 cases of thyroiditis and 400 cases of GD occurring at a single 
3812 
medical center, 6 cases of painless thyroiditis had a history of recent lithium exposure, 
3813 
representing a nearly 5-fold increase compared to cases of lithium exposure in patients 
3814 
with GD (19). 
3815 
[X4] TSH-secreting pituitary tumors 
3816 
■ RECOMMENDATION 121 
3817 
The diagnosis of TSH-secreting pituitary tumor should be based on an inappropriately 
3818 
normal or elevated serum TSH level associated with elevated free T4 and total T3 
3819 
concentrations, generally associated with a pituitary tumor on MRI or CT, and the 
3820 
absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with thyroid hormone 
3821 
resistance. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3822 
 
TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas are rare tumors and represent an even rarer 
3823 
cause of hyperthyroidism. Recent data from the Swedish registry reported an incidence of 
3824 
0.15 per 1 million inhabitants with a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million (658). After 
3825 
excluding laboratory interference with either the free T4 or TSH assay, as may occur with 
3826 
T4 antibodies and heterophilic antibodies, respectively, distinction between a TSH-
3827 
secreting adenoma and thyroid hormone resistance is important, since thyroid function 
3828 
test results are similar, yet management is quite different for these two disorders. TSH-
3829 
secreting adenomas are more likely to have concurrent alpha-subunit elevation (not 
3830 
useful in postmenopausal women due to concurrent gonadotropin elevation), a blunted 
3831 
TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (when available), elevated sex-
3832 
 hormone-binding globulin and resting energy expenditure, and clinical evidence of 
3833 
thyrotoxicosis, as well as an anatomic abnormality on MRI of the pituitary. Finally, a 
3834 
response to somatostatin analog therapy with clinical improvement lends support to the 
3835 
diagnosis of a TSH adenoma in cases in which diagnostic uncertainty persists.  Although 
3836 
most TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas only secrete TSH, co-secretion of prolactin or 
3837 
growth hormone is possible and should be assessed concurrently along with assessment 
3838 
of the pituitray-adrenal axis and pituitary-gonadal axes.  
3839 
 
Technical remarks: Genetic testing for thyroid hormone resistance is 
3840 
commercially available and may be useful in equivocal cases, especially in those patients 
3841 
without family members available for thyroid function testing.  Calculation of the molar 
3842 
alpha subunit/TSH ratio can be accomplished by dividing the alpha subunit concentration 
3843 
(ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10. A ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-
3844 
secreting pituitary adenoma.   
3845 
 
Pituitary surgery is generally the mainstay of therapy for TSH-producing pituitary 
3846 
tumors. In a recent series of 68 patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery, 75% 
3847 
normalize thyroid function after surgery, 58% normalized both pituitary imaging and 
3848 
TSH hypersecretion, 9% developed new deficiencies, and 3% experienced tumor 
3849 
recurrence (659). The patient should be made euthyroid preoperatively. Long-term ATD 
3850 
therapy and other measures directed at the thyroid, such as RAI or thyroidectomy, are 
3851 
generally avoided due to theoretical concerns of tumor growth.  Preoperative adjunctive 
3852 
therapy with octreotide and dopamine agonist therapy has been examined. Treatment 
3853 
with octreotide results in a >50% reduction in serum TSH values in the majority of 
3854 
 patients treated, and a concurrent return to euthyroidism in most (43). A reduction in 
3855 
tumor size has been observed in 20%–50% of patients treated with octreotide (43,660), 
3856 
but less impressive results have been obtained with bromocriptine therapy (660). 
3857 
However, presurgical medical treatment did not significantly improve surgical outcome 
3858 
(63% vs 57% had negative tumor imaging after surgery) (659). In a recent case series of 
3859 
7 patients treated with octreotide without prior surgery, mean free T4 and T3 levels were 
3860 
reduced by nearly 50% in the first three months of therapy and 6 of 7 patients 
3861 
experienced tumor volume reduction (661).  
3862 
 
Sterotactic or conventional radiotherapy has also been used in cases that prove 
3863 
refractory to medical therapy.  Radiotherapy controlled thyroid hypersecretion in 37% of 
3864 
patients treated with this modality, but hypopituitarism occurred in 32% of those treated 
3865 
(659). For patients with TSH-producing adenomas who are considered poor surgical 
3866 
candidates, primary medical therapy with octreotide can be considered (661).  Patients 
3867 
who fail to respond to pituitary surgery and somatostatin analog therapy or have tumor 
3868 
enlargement despite these measures are sometimes treated with radiation therapy.  
3869 
■ RECOMMENDATION 122 
3870 
Patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas should undergo surgery performed by 
3871 
an experienced pituitary surgeon. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. 
3872 
 
Technical remarks: Postoperative adjunctive therapy with octreotide and/or 
3873 
external beam radiation therapy may be useful in managing patients with persistent 
3874 
 central hyperthyroidism after a debulking procedure for nonresectable TSH-secreting 
3875 
adenomas (43). 
3876 
[X5] Struma ovarii 
3877 
■ RECOMMENDATION 123 
3878 
Patients with struma ovarii should be treated initially with surgical resection following 
3879 
preoperative normalization of thyroid hormones. Strong recommendation, low-
3880 
quality evidence. 
3881 
 
Struma ovarii, defined as ectopic thyroid tissue existing as a substantial 
3882 
component of an ovarian tumor, is quite rare, representing <1% of all ovarian tumors. 
3883 
Approximately 5–10% of patients with struma ovarii present with thyrotoxicosis (662) 
3884 
due to either autonomous ectopic thyroid function or the coexistence of GD, and up to 
3885 
25% of struma ovarii tumors contain elements of papillary thyroid cancer. Patients 
3886 
previously treated for GD may have persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism due to the 
3887 
action of TRAb on the ectopic thyroid tissue (663).  The diagnosis should be considered 
3888 
in any thyrotoxic patient with a very low or absent RAI uptake over the eutopic thyroid 
3889 
gland.  Other conditions that present with this constellation of findings include various 
3890 
forms of thyroiditis, factitious thyrotoxicosis, and iodine-induced hyperthyroidism.  In 
3891 
struma ovarii, the RAI is concentrated in the pelvic region over the teratoma. 
3892 
Cosynchronous primary thyroid cancer occurred in 9% of patients in one series of 68 
3893 
patients identified in the SEER database (664). Treatment of struma ovarii generally 
3894 
involves surgical removal, performed both to cure the hyperthyroidism and to eliminate 
3895 
 the risk of untreated ectopic thyroid cancer. Preoperative treatment with beta-adrenergic-
3896 
blocking agents and ATDs is warranted to restore euthyroidism before surgery. 
3897 
 
Technical remarks: In cases of suspected metastatic malignant struma ovarii, RAI 
3898 
is generally given following surgical removal of both the ovarian tumor and the patient’s 
3899 
thyroid to facilitate delivery of isotope to any potential residual malignant cells. 
3900 
[X6] Choriocarcinoma 
3901 
■ RECOMMENDATION 124 
3902 
Treatment of hyperthyroidism due to choriocarcinoma should include both MMI and 
3903 
treatment directed against the primary tumor. Strong recommendation, low-quality 
3904 
evidence. 
3905 
 
Patients with choriocarcinoma, including molar pregnancy and testicular cancer, 
3906 
may present with thyrotoxicosis due to the effect of tumor-derived hCG upon the TSH 
3907 
receptor (665-668). This cross-stimulation only occurs at very high levels of hCG, since 
3908 
hCG is only a weak agonist for the TSH receptor. Therefore, patients with testicular 
3909 
choriocarcinoma presenting with overt thyrotoxicosis may have widely metastatic disease 
3910 
at presentation (667,668). Treatment of hyperthyroidism due to choriocarcinoma involves 
3911 
both treatment directed against the primary tumor and ATDs. 
3912 
[X7] Thyrotoxicosis factitia 
3913 
 
Thyrotoxicosis factitia includes all causes of thyrotoxicosis due to the ingestion of 
3914 
thyroid hormone. This may include intentional ingestion of thyroid hormone either 
3915 
 surreptitiously or iatrogenically, as well as unintentional ingestion either accidentally, 
3916 
such as in pediatric poisoning or pharmacy error, or through ingestion of supplements 
3917 
that contain thyroid hormone (669). Historically, accidental thyroid hormone ingestion 
3918 
has occurred as a result of eating meat contaminated with animal thyroid tissue 
3919 
(‘‘hamburger thyrotoxicosis’’) (670).

Whereas iatrogenic causes of thyrotoxicosis factitia are easily identified, 
3921 
surreptitious use of thyroid hormone may present a diagnostic quandary. Clues to this 
3922 
diagnosis are an absence of goiter, a suppressed serum thyroglobulin level, and a 
3923 
decreased RAI uptake.  In a patient who has circulating antithyroglobulin antibodies that 
3924 
artifactually render the serum thyroglobulin undetectable in immunometric assays, the 
3925 
distinction between painless thyroiditis and factitious thyrotoxicosis can be difficult.  In 
3926 
both situations there will be elevated levels of T4, a high T4/T3 ratio (with exogenous 
3927 
levothyroxine), a small thyroid, and a low thyroidal RAI uptake.  Thyroid ultrasound may 
3928 
be helpful, as the thyroid has a heterogeneous echotexture and is normal-sized or slightly 
3929 
enlarged in painless thyroiditis, while it is small with a normal echotexture in an 
3930 
otherwise normal individual who is ingesting thyroid hormone surreptitiously.   Fecal 
3931 
levothyroxine has been measured as a means of distinguishing surreptitious use of thyroid 
3932 
hormone from painless thyroiditis (54). A disproportionately elevated T3 level suggests 
3933 
that the patient may be ingesting liothyronine or a combination T4/T3 preparation.    
3934 
 
Severe thyrotoxicosis and rarely, thyroid storm, have been reported following 
3935 
thyroid hormone overdose or poisoning.  Treatment with Cholestyramine (671) and 
3936 
charcoal hemoperfusion (672) have been used in this circumstance.   
3937 
 [X8] Functional thyroid cancer metastases 
3938 
 
Thyrotoxicosis due to functional metastases in patients with thyroid cancer has  
3939 
been described in a handful of cases. Typically, patients have either a very large primary  
3940 
follicular cancer or widely metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, and may have coexisting  
3941 
TRAb as the proximate cause of the thyrotoxicosis (673). In general, functioning  
3942 
metastasis are treated with RAI with the addition of ATDs as needed for persistent  
3943 
hyperthyroidism. Recombinant human TSH should be avoided in these patients. Patients  
3944 
with massive metastatic FC may also exhibit T3 thyrotoxicosis, most likely due to  
3945 
increased conversion of T4 to T3 by tumor expressing high type 1 and type 2 deiodinase  
3946 
activities (674). Thus, occasional measurement of serum T3 in addition to FT4 and TSH is  
3947 
recommended in patients with a large metastatic tumor burden, particularly if FT4  
3948 
decreases on fixed doses of levothyroxine.
