BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic 
environment predicts heart failure (HF) hospital readmissions. We 
investigated whether neighborhood deprivation predicts risk of incident 
HF beyond individual socioeconomic status in a low-income population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were 27 
078 whites and blacks 
recruited during 2002 to 2009 in the SCCS (Southern Community Cohort 
Study), who had no history of HF and were using Centers for Medicare 
or Medicaid Services. Incident HF diagnoses through December 31, 
2010, were ascertained using International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, codes 428.x via linkage with Centers for Medicare or 
Medicaid Services research files. Participant residential information was 
geocoded and census tract determined by a spatial join to the US Census 
Bureau TIGER/Line Shapefiles. The neighborhood deprivation index was 
constructed using principal components analysis based on census tract-
level socioeconomic variables. Cox models with Huber–White cluster 
sandwich estimator of variance were used to investigate the association 
between neighborhood deprivation index and HF risk. The study sample 
was predominantly middle aged (mean, 55.5 years), black (69%), female 
(63%), low income (70% earned <$15 
000/y), and >50% of participants 
lived in the most deprived neighborhoods (third neighborhood deprivation 
index tertile). Over median follow-up of 5.2 years, 4300 participants 
were diagnosed with HF. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and 
clinical factors, a 1 interquartile increase in neighborhood deprivation 
index was associated with a 12% increase in risk of HF (hazard ratio, 
1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.18), and 4.8% of the variance in 
HF risk (intraclass correlation coefficient, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 
3.6–6.4) was explained by neighborhood deprivation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this low-income population, scant neighborhood 
resources compound the risk of HF above and beyond individual 
socioeconomic status and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 
Improvements in community resources may be a significant axis for 
curbing the burden of HF.

H
eart failure (HF) is a major public health prob-
lem, particularly in the southeastern United 
States which has been described as the heart 
failure belt.1,2 This region has the highest prevalence 
of established HF risk factors (including coronary heart 
disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and 
obesity) which themselves may be associated with so-
cioeconomic characteristics that influence health out-
comes. Although evidence from middle-class popula-
tions suggests that individual socioeconomic status 
(SES) contributes to HF risk,3–6 recent data support that 
neighborhood factors may also predict HF readmis-
sions independent of individual SES.7 However, it is not 
known whether such neighborhood factors are inde-
pendent predictors of other HF outcomes such as HF in-
cidence among persons with already low individual SES.
The SCCS (Southern Community Cohort Study) is a 
prospective cohort study that recruited persons of low 
SES from 12 states in the southeastern United States. 
Within this cohort, we tested the hypothesis that neigh-
borhood characteristics (defined by a composite depri-
vation index) predict the risk of incident HF beyond indi-
vidual SES (defined by annual household income and 
highest level of education attained).
METHODS
Design and Study Population
The SCCS is an ongoing prospective investigation of the 
incidence of cancer and other chronic conditions, including 
differential patterns by race and sex, in a resource-limited 
underinsured population.8 A total of 84 
797 participants aged 
40 to 79 were enrolled into the SCCS from 2002 to 2009.9 
Approximately 86% of participants were recruited at commu-
nity health centers, which provide primary health and preven-
tive care services for underserved populations, such that the 
cohort is made up of a segment of society underrepresented 
in previous cohort studies, particularly those investigating 
cardiovascular disease (CVD).8,10 The remaining 14% were 
enrolled via mail-based sampling of the general population. 
Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and anthropometric 
data, as well as personal medical history, were ascertained 
at cohort enrollment via standardized computer-assisted per-
sonal interviews for community health centers participants, 
and via self-administered mailed questionnaire for participants 
recruited from the general population. Detailed description of 
SCCS methods has been previously published.8,10,11 According 
to SCCS Guidelines for Data and Biospecimen Use (policy 
manual available online at www.southerncommunitystudy.
org), the data that support the findings of this study are avail-
able from the corresponding author on reasonable request by 
qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality 
protocols and on approval by the SCCS Data and Biospecimen 
Use Committee.
For the current analyses, we included 27 
078 participants 
who were either ≥65 years old at cohort enrollment (n=7001) 
or <65 years at enrollment (n=20 
077) and (1) reported being 
covered by Medicaid (which provides medical benefits to 
low-income adults and uninsured persons) or Medicare (the 
primary health insurance program for persons aged ≥65 and 
those with disabilities under age 65) on the baseline ques-
tionnaire; or (2) did not report Medicare or Medicaid on 
the baseline questionnaire but had a Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS) claim within 90 days of being 
enrolled in SCCS.2 The restriction to these groups increases 
the likelihood of participants having continuous coverage in 
Medicare or Medicaid from the time of SCCS enrollment to 
the end of the follow-up period (December 31, 2010), for the 
ascertainment of incident HF events. Analyses were restricted 
to self-reported African American or black and non-Hispanic 
white SCCS participants because too few persons in other 
racial groups were available for stable statistical analyses.
Census Tracts
Census tracts were used as proxies for neighborhoods in 
this study. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent sta-
tistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are 
updated by local participants before each decennial census 
as part of the US Census Bureau Participant Statistical Areas 
Program.12 Prior literature suggests that census tracts were 
originally designed to be relatively homogenous in socioeco-
nomic characteristics,13 and if neighborhoods are considered 
to be spatially defined collections of people, infrastructures, 
and institutions influenced by common economic and envi-
ronmental forces,14 then census tracts could be regarded as a 
relevant proxy. More so, in addition to the relative socioeco-
nomic homogeneity that may exist between persons living in 
a census tract, the latter may be able to capture disparities 
in social and physical attributes, between small geographic 
units, that are relevant to health outcomes.13 Census tracts 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Prior evidence suggests a strong independent 
association between individual socioeconomic 
characteristics, such as income, education and 
occupation, and heart failure risk.
• Recent data suggest that neighborhood socioeco-
nomic factors also play a significant role in predict-
ing heart failure outcomes including heart failure 
admissions and readmissions.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Neighborhood socioeconomic factors significantly 
predict heart failure incidence independent of 
individual income, level of education, and tradi-
tional cardiovascular risk factors.
• These findings support the position of several 
cardiovascular societies suggesting that upstream 
interventions encompassing preventive measures 
and public policy, namely improvements in com-
munity-level resources particularly in areas with 
acute neighborhood deprivation, may have a 
wide-reaching population-level effect on the miti-
gation of adverse cardiovascular outcomes includ-
ing heart failure.

have also been widely used as the default proxy in prior 
studies investigating the association between neighborhood 
socioeconomic environment and cardiovascular outcomes.7,15
At the time of the SCCS baseline interview, study partici-
pants provided information on their residential address which 
was then geocoded by a multistage process incorporating both 
batch and interactive processes.16 The census tract for the geo-
coded address was then determined by a spatial join to the US 
Census Bureau Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding 
and Referencing (TIGER/Line) Shapefiles17 using ESRI ArcMap 
10.0 software (ESRI, Redlands, CA) that uses geographic infor-
mation systems technology. Non-Post Office box addresses 
failing to geocode in ArcMap and Post Office box addresses 
(2.8% of all addresses) were submitted to the online-based 
EZ-Locate Client version 2.47 available from Tele Atlas at 
www.geocode.com using their USA_Geo_002 base map (Tele 
Atlas, 2006).16 Overall, 99.96% of participants’ addresses were 
geocoded. Details of the geocoding procedure for SCCS par-
ticipants have been published elsewhere.16 The 27 
078 SCCS 
participants included in the current analyses resided in 4666 
census tracts. Geocoding of SCCS participants’ addresses and 
linkage to geographic information data sets such as census 
tract data allowed development of residence-specific metrics 
including the SCCS-derived deprivation index.
Neighborhood Deprivation Index
The SCCS-derived deprivation index is a clustering of social 
and economic indicators which reflect neighborhood depri-
vation and have been linked to adverse health outcomes. It 
was constructed using principal components analysis based 
on 11 census tract-level variables (from Census 2000) repre-
senting 4 main dimensions18,19: (1) social indicators: percent-
age of housing units with ≥1 occupant per room, percentage 
of occupied housing units with renter/owner costs >50% of 
income, and percent female-headed households with depen-
dent children; (2) wealth and income: percentage of house-
holds with income <$30 
000 per year, percentage of persons 
with income below the 1999 poverty status, percentage of 
households with public assistance income, percentage of 
households with no car, and median value of owner-occupied 
housing units; (3) education: percentage of persons aged ≥25 
who did not graduate high school; and (4) occupation: per-
centage of males and females who are unemployed and per-
centage males in professional occupations.
In the original description of the neighborhood deprivation 
index (NDI) by Messer et al,18 the first principal component 
was retained, as it explained over 67% of the variance with 
component loadings ranging between 0.2 and 0.4, suggest-
ing similar contribution of each of the component variables to 
the first principal component. In the SCCS, the first principal 
component explained most of the variability (over 60%) in 
the component measures as well, as such it was retained for 
the construction of the NDI in the SCCS.19
Individual Socioeconomic Variables and 
Other Covariates
SCCS participants reported their highest level of education 
attained and the range of their total household income for the 
year before enrollment. History of tobacco smoking, alcohol 
use, and total amount of moderate and vigorous exercise was 
equally self-reported. The presence of traditional cardiovascu-
lar risk factors at baseline was based on a self-reported history 
of physician-diagnosed hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high 
cholesterol, myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as self-
reported use of medications for these conditions. Many of 
the questions on the SCCS questionnaire were adapted from 
questionnaires used and validated in other settings; a series 
of independent validation studies using biomarkers, repeat 
interviews, or medical records have demonstrated the reliabil-
ity of the questionnaire within the SCCS population for vari-
ables such as smoking status, self-reported diseases including 
diabetes mellitus, height, and weight.8
Outcome Ascertainment
HF events were ascertained via linkage of the SCCS cohort 
with CMS Research Identifiable Files.2 Incident HF was defined 
as the first occurrence of a medical claim with an International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, discharge code of 
428.x within the Medicare institutional (Medicare Provider 
Analysis and Review which includes inpatient, outpatient, and 
skilled nursing facility base files), Part B carrier (includes nonin-
stitutional physician services and durable medical equipment), 
or outpatient-based claims files or the Medicaid Analytic 
Extract Inpatient and Other Services claims files, from the date 
of SCCS enrollment through December 31, 2010. Detailed 
description of the CMS research files is published elsewhere.20 
Death (including date of death) was ascertained via linkage 
of the cohort with the Social Security Administration vital sta-
tus service for epidemiological researchers and the National 
Death Index through December 31, 2010, and death was 
used as a censoring variable during data analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Among the 27 
078 participants, 260 (0.96%) had missing val-
ues for NDI and were therefore excluded from these analyses. 
Descriptive statistics were computed for all study participants 
overall and by tertiles of deprivation index. Tertile cut points 
were based on the distribution of NDI at the census tract level 
(not individuals) for the census tracts (n=4666) covered by the 
population (n=26 
818) included in the final analysis. Tertile 1 
represents the least deprived census tracts (ie, the neighbor-
hoods with the highest socioeconomic level), whereas tertile 
3 represents the most deprived. The inequality in the num-
ber of individuals per tertile of NDI is explained in part by 
the wide variation in the number of persons per census tract 
(mean=6; range: 1–243) and that census tracts with higher 
deprivation tended to have more individuals per census tract, 
that is, more persons lived in the most socioeconomically dis-
advantaged neighborhoods.
Modeling Hierarchical Data
For the current analyses, the data were organized in a hierar-
chical fashion with individual participants (level 1 units) nested 
within census tracts (level 2 units). Given the nested structure 
of the data, the nonindependence of the data points within 
each census tract, and the limitations of a multilevel mod-
eling approach in this setting (unbalanced data with many 
small clusters), we used a Cox proportional hazards model 
that accounts for nonindependence using the Huber–White

cluster sandwich estimator of variance.21 The intraclass cor-
relation coefficient was computed using the latent variable 
approach.22 Elaborate formulae for the intraclass correlation 
coefficient and the cluster sandwich estimator are provided in 
the Data Supplement.
Deprivation Index and HF Incidence
To investigate HF incidence, duration of follow-up was 
computed from date of enrollment into the SCCS until the 
date of the first diagnosis of HF, date of death, or December 
31, 2010, whichever occurred first. Age-standardized inci-
dence rates of HF for each NDI tertile were computed 
using the overall age distribution of the study sample as 
reference.
Multivariable-adjusted Cox analyses were used to model 
a flexible association between NDI (modeled using restricted 
cubic splines with 4 knots) and HF accounting for nonlinearity 
and nonadditivity of effects by race. The log relative hazard 
of incident HF was computed from the fully adjusted model 
for observed values of deprivation index while holding the 
values of covariates at their referent values and plotted (on 
the y axis) against NDI (on the x axis) by race. For each cat-
egorical and dichotomous covariate, the referent value used 
in the computation of log relative hazard (Xβ) was the modal 
category, whereas for each continuous covariate, the refer-
ent value was the median. The covariates included in the full 
model were age at enrollment (restricted cubic splines with 4 
knots), race (white/black), NDI×race interaction terms (linear 
and nonlinear), sex, cigarette smoking (never, former, current 
<19.5 pack-years, current ≥19.5 pack-years, 19.5 being the 
median pack-years among current smokers), alcohol intake 
(linear), total metabolic equivalent-hours of moderate or 
greater exercise (linear and quadratic term), body mass index 
(restricted cubic splines with 4 knots), history of diabetes mel-
litus, hypertension, high cholesterol, myocardial infarction/
coronary artery bypass graft or stroke (all yes/no), as well 
as annual household income (<$15 
000; $15 
000–$24 
999; 
≥$25 
000), and education (<high school, high school/voca-
tional training/junior college, ≥college degree) to investigate 
the potential mediating effects of individual SES. The criteria 
for selecting relevant covariates and choosing their functional 
form are provided in the Data Supplement.
In further analyses, multivariable Cox models assuming 
linearity of effects (with NDI modeled as a rescaled continu-
ous variable using the interquartile range [IQR]) were used to 
estimate the effect of a 1 IQR increase in deprivation index 
on HF incidence while adjusting for the aforementioned 
covariates in a sequential fashion (models 1–3). Hazard 
ratios (HRs) for a 1 IQR increase in NDI compare the hazard 
of the event occurring for a typical person in the middle of 
the upper half (the 75th percentile) of the distribution of NDI 
to the hazard of the event for a typical person in the middle 
of the lower half (25th percentile) of the distribution. Knots 
were placed at quantiles of covariate distributions, equally 
spaced in sample size.21
We conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding HF cases 
diagnosed within 2 years of follow-up to limit the possibility 
that HF cases occurring soon after enrollment may not have 
been influenced by baseline values of NDI.
Model assumptions were verified using Schoenfeld residu-
als and log (−log) plots.
All analyses were performed using STATA (version 12.1; 
Stata Corp, College Station, TX) and the rms package for R 
version 3.1.1 (R Core Team 2014).21,23
Ethical Approval
Participants enrolled in SCCS provided written informed con-
sent, and protocols were approved by the Institutional Review 
Boards of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Meharry 
Medical College.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Population
Baseline characteristics of the 26 
818 included partici-
pants are shown in Table 1, overall and by tertiles of NDI. 
The mean (SD) age of participants at cohort enrollment 
was 55.5 (10.4) years, 62.7% were women, 69.0% 
were black, 69.9% had annual household income 
<$15 
000, 38.6% had less than a high school educa-
tion, and 44.8% were obese (body mass index≥30 kg/
m2). The mean (SD) NDI was 0.85 (1.21) with a range 
of −2.4 to 6.0 (increasing values of deprivation index 
represent increasing levels of neighborhood depriva-
tion or decreasing levels of neighborhood SES). There 
was a modest negative correlation between NDI and 
annual household income (Spearman rank correlation 
coefficient, ρ=−0.23) and education (ρ=−0.17). Com-
pared with persons living in the least socioeconomically 
deprived neighborhoods (tertile 1), participants living in 
the most deprived neighborhoods (tertile 3) were more 
likely to be younger, black, and obese, have less than 
a high school education, earn <$15 
000 a year, and be 
current smokers. They were also more likely to report a 
history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension at baseline.
Deprivation Index and HF Incidence
Over a median (25th, 75th percentile) follow-up time of 
5.2 (3.2, 6.8) years, 4300 participants (16%) developed 
incident HF. SCCS participants in the third NDI tertile 
had the highest age-standardized HF incidence rate, 
37.9 per 1000 person-years, compared with 28.4 per 
1000 person-years and 33.9 per 1000 person-years for 
persons in tertiles 1 and 2, respectively.
The figure shows a graph of the log relative hazard 
(Xβ) of HF plotted against NDI. Among whites, the log 
relative hazard of HF rises sharply with increasing NDI, 
then levels off after an NDI of ≈0.5. Among blacks on 
the other hand, the curve has a more gradual slope 
and it plateaus at higher values of deprivation index 
(≈2.0).
Table 2 shows the risk of incident HF associated with 
NDI adjusted for relevant covariates in a sequential fash-
ion (models 1–3). Overall, after adjustment for age, sex, 
and race, a 1 IQR increase in NDI was associated with

a 14% increase in the risk of HF (HR, 1.14; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.09–1.19). Subsequent adjustment 
for lifestyle and clinical factors was associated with a 
minimal change in the point estimate (HR, 1.15; 95% 
CI, 1.09–1.20). In the full model, further adjustment for 
income and education showed only a modest attenu-
ation of the strength of the association; namely, a 1 
IQR increase in NDI was associated with a 12% increase 
in the risk of HF (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07–1.18). The 
intraclass correlation coefficient was 4.8% (95% CI,

*Tertile cut points were based on the distribution of NDI at the census tract level (not individuals). The third tertile is the most

the significant variation in the number of persons per census tract and the fact that census tracts with higher deprivation had more

3.6–6.4), suggesting that 4.8% of the variance in HF 
risk was explained by neighborhood deprivation.
In the race-stratified analysis, the findings from the 
most parsimonious model (model 1) were suggestive of 
a significant heterogeneity of effects by race (HR, 1.34; 
95% CI, 1.21–1.47 among whites, and HR, 1.09; 95% 
CI, 1.04–1.15 among blacks, P for interaction=0.0005). 
In the full models, the point estimates were less dis-
parate between both racial groups: there was a 20% 
increase in risk (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07–1.34) of HF 
per 1 IQR increase in NDI among whites and a 10% 
increase among blacks (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04–1.17).

within 2 years of follow-up (1752 cases excluded, leav-
ing 2548 cases for the analysis), the effect estimates 
were similar, with an HR of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06–1.20) for 
the overall cohort (n=25 
066) in fully adjusted models.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the association between NDI and HF 
incidence in a large population of low-income blacks 
and whites from the southeastern United States. Our 
main findings were (1) persons living in the most socio-
economically deprived neighborhoods seem to have a 
greater burden of CVD risk factors and (2) higher levels 
of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation are signifi-
cantly associated with an increase in HF risk indepen-
dent of individual SES and traditional CVD risk factors.
The existing literature provides evidence of a strong 
independent association between individual socioeco-
nomic characteristics, such as income, education and 
occupation, and HF risk.3–6 In addition, recent data sug-
gest that neighborhood SES also plays a significant role 
in predicting HF outcomes including HF admissions and 
readmissions,7,24 but evidence for the association with 
HF incidence has been scant. The current investigation 
demonstrates an independent association between 
increasing neighborhood deprivation and increased risk 
of HF with a non-negligible proportion of the variance 
(≈5%) of HF incidence in this population explained by 
neighborhood socioeconomic factors. Furthermore, the 
dose–response curve indicates increasing HF risk with 
increasing levels of neighborhood deprivation in both 
blacks and whites before the curve plateaus. Neighbor-
hood factors have been shown to predict the incidence 
of coronary heart disease15,22 and we now extend this to 
HF. Further, given that our study was conducted within 
a population with relatively low individual SES, under-
represented in previous studies, it is particularly note-
worthy to find that concurrent neighborhood socioeco-
nomic deprivation further compounds the risk of HF in 
this population.
The NDI used for this study was a composite obtained 
from 11 neighborhood-level (census tract) variables 
representing 4 dimensions (wealth and income, educa-
tion, occupation, and social indicators). As an aggre-
gate measure, it represents a construct—neighborhood 
socioeconomic deprivation—which goes above and 
beyond its specific components and could be construed 
as a summary indicator of the area-level socioeco-

heart failure (HF) versus deprivation index by race.  
The y axis shows the log relative hazard of incident HF 
computed from the fully adjusted model for observed values 
of deprivation index while holding the values of covariates 
at their referent values. The curves display the trend in HF 
risk with increasing levels of neighborhood deprivation (on 
the x axis) while simultaneously holding the covariate values 
constant. For both blacks and whites, HF risk increases with 
increasing deprivation index, but the curve for whites seems 
steeper before both eventually plateau. The overlaid histo-
gram shows the distribution of deprivation index.

nomic context and other correlates.13 In addition, prior 
literature suggests that the underlying causal effects 
being investigated when using neighborhood depriva-
tion indices as proxies are not only the literal effects 
of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation but also 
the effect of the social and physical attributes which 
neighborhood socioeconomic context is reflective of in 
part.13 However, the specific mechanistic pathways or 
causal intermediaries underpinning the independent 
link (above and beyond individual-level SES) between 
the neighborhood socioeconomic environment and 
HF risk remain currently uncertain. We advance a few 
plausible hypotheses (based on previous studies inves-
tigating the role of neighborhood socioeconomic envi-
ronment on other health outcomes including coronary 
artery disease, HF readmissions, and mortality7,15,25) that 
need to be investigated further in future studies. Previ-
ous data suggest that the availability of community-lev-
el resources including but not limited to exercise facili-
ties, healthy food outlets, and institutional resources 
(including healthcare facilities) vary considerably across 
neighborhoods.13,26,27 In the geographic area inhabited 
by the participants in the current investigation, if food 
deserts are more preponderant in the most deprived 
neighborhoods, that could reduce access to healthier 
food choices and potentially increase the consumption 
of high-calorie foods and foods with high sodium con-
tent. Also, the combination of fewer physical activity 
resources, unaffordable gym memberships, and higher 
crime rate may predispose persons living in these com-
munities to reduced physical activity and sedentariness. 
The combined influence of poor nutritional habits and 
physical inactivity could explain the higher rates of obe-
sity that have been observed in poverty-dense counties 
in the United States.28,29 The high rates of obesity are 
paralleled by high prevalence of obesity-related comor-
bid conditions including diabetes mellitus and high 
blood pressure (possibly abetted in part by the con-
sumption of foods with high salt content) which further 
compound the risk of HF in these communities.
In the current cohort, compared with the neighbor-
hoods with the highest socioeconomic position, the 
more deprived neighborhoods each had higher preva-
lence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus at 
baseline and this may have contributed to the observed 
trend of increasing HF risk with worsening deprivation. 
Nevertheless, after adjustment for all these factors, a 
strong independent association between neighborhood 
deprivation and HF risk persisted, which could not be 
explained by mediation via CVD risk factors or individual 
SES. This suggests that some of the correlates of neigh-
borhood socioeconomic deprivation may be less tangi-
ble and harder to measure. Some authors have hypoth-
esized that persons living in deprived neighborhoods 
may be at higher risk of unfavorable societal stressors 
like noise, air pollution, and violence which may cul-
minate in chronic psychological stress and predispose 
individuals to adverse health outcomes including HF.15,30 
Marked institutional deficiencies in resource-limited set-
tings are usually mirrored by reduced access to quality 
education, occupational opportunities, and health facili-
ties. These could expose individuals in these communi-
ties to reduced scholarship, income, and logistics and 
hence curtail individual ability to seek preventative care, 
self-management, and adherence to recommended 
treatment guidelines (evidence-based lifestyle strategies 
and multifactorial medical management approaches) for 
conditions such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension—
predisposing them to elevated risk of HF.
The current study has a few noteworthy limita-
tions. Persons <65 who do not use Medicaid were not 
included in this study, and given that these persons may 
have higher individual-level SES than the participants 
included in this study, the findings of this study may not 
be generalizable to young or middle-aged adults with 
higher individual-level SES. However, neighborhood 
socioeconomic environment has been shown to be 
associated with other cardiovascular outcomes (includ-
ing coronary heart disease and HF readmissions)7,15 in 
cohorts recruiting mostly middle-class participants (with 
higher utilization of private health insurance) like the 
ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) or 
the Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes 
trial. Hence, it is plausible that the association with inci-
dent HF could have equally been observed among per-
sons not using CMS services. Some authors consider 
a neighborhood to be a spatially defined collection of 
people, infrastructures, and institutions influenced by 
common environmental, sociocultural, and economic 
forces.31 The extent to which a census tract is a ratio-
nal proxy for neighborhood remains uncertain. How-
ever, census tracts are a well-defined statistical and 
geographic entity which cover a contiguous area with 
long-term boundaries and harbor a population with 
relatively homogenous socioeconomic characteristics.13 
Thus, using them as proxies for neighborhoods seems 
reasonable for the purpose of investigating the health 
outcomes of a population with shared socioeconomic 
environment. More so, they have been extensively used 
in prior studies investigating the association between 
neighborhood socioeconomic context and health out-
comes.7,15,25 The fact that we relied essentially on base-
line neighborhood data and were unable to include 
early-life neighborhood information or consider any 
potential change of address of study participants dur-
ing the study is another potential limitation. However, 
we assumed that any potential movements of partici-
pants may be to similarly deprived neighborhoods given 
that most participants were of low individual-level SES. 
Most of our covariate data (past history of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and 
high cholesterol) were based on self-report of a physi-

cian diagnosis and use of medications. Although self-
report could be susceptible to recall and misclassifica-
tion bias, these methods have been validated in the 
Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and other 
epidemiological studies.8 Several of the questions on 
the SCCS questionnaire were adapted from question-
naires that were validated in other settings; a series 
of independent validation studies using biomarkers, 
repeat interviews, or medical records have demon-
strated the reliability of the questionnaire within the 
SCCS population for variables such as smoking status 
and self-reported diseases including diabetes mellitus.8 
HF was ascertained by linking our baseline SCCS data 
with CMS Research Identifiable Files using International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 428.x, 
rather than independent physician adjudication. None-
theless, the diagnosis codes algorithm for identification 
of HF used in this study has been previously validated 
and used in other cohorts.32–34 A review of the detection 
of HF in administrative claims data that included stud-
ies conducted among Medicare beneficiaries reported 
positive predictive values mostly over 90%.32
Our study leverages data from a large biracial cohort 
with a sizable number of low-income participants living 
in resource-limited settings and who are traditionally 
underrepresented in previous cohorts investigating HF 
outcomes. Thus, it provided the unique opportunity to 
investigate the role of neighborhood factors on HF risk 
in a sample of people already having scant individual 
resources. The ability to perform geocoding of participant 
residential information and linkage to geographic infor-
mation data sets such as census tract data allowed devel-
opment of residence-specific metrics including the SCCS-
derived deprivation index which we were able to use as 
a proxy for neighborhood SES. The large number of level 
2 units (census tracts) covered by the study participants 
allowed for stable statistical analyses and provided some 
credence to the representativeness of the whole SCCS 
cohort by the subsample used for the current analysis.
In conclusion, we found that neighborhood socio-
economic factors significantly predict HF incidence inde-
pendent of individual income and education level and 
traditional CVD risk factors. The American Heart Asso-
ciation and other cardiovascular societies recognize that 
improvements in cardiovascular health require strategies 
that target the entire spectrum of the healthcare system 
including public policy, prevention, acute care, chronic 
care, and rehabilitation. However, the more upstream 
measures which focus on public policy and prevention 
may have the greatest potential to mitigate the burden 
of CVD and improve human health. Areas with the most 
acute socioeconomic deprivation are most likely at the 
highest risk for CVD (including HF) and CVD mortality 
and hence may benefit most from such improvements 
in public health policies including, but not limited to, 
improvements in community-level resources.
