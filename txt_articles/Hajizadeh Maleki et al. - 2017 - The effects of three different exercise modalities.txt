Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), high-intensity continuous 
training (HICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on markers of male reproduction including seminal markers of oxidative 
stress and inflammation as well as semen quality and sperm DNA integrity in healthy human subjects. A total of 397 healthy male 
volunteers were screened and 280 were randomly assigned to one of the MICT (n 
= 
70), HICT (n 
= 
70), HIIT (n 
= 
70) and non-exercise 
(NON-EX, n 
= 
70) groups. Subjects had inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α), oxidants (ROS, MDA and 8-isoprostane), 
antioxidants (SOD, catalase and TAC), semen parameters and sperm DNA damage measured at baseline (T1), the end of week 12 (T2), 
the end of week 24 (T3), and 7 (T4) and 30 days (T5) after training. Chronic MICT, HICT and HIIT attenuated seminal markers of 
oxidative stress and inflammation with different kinetics for the three types of exercise (P 
< 
0.05), and these changes were correlated 
with favorable improvements in semen quality parameters and sperm DNA integrity (P 
< 
0.05). MICT was superior to HICT and HIIT 
in the improvements of markers of male reproductive function (P 
< 
0.05). In conclusion, different exercise modalities favorably affect 
markers of male reproduction with different kinetics, suggesting intensity-, duration- and type-dependent adaptations to exercise 
training in healthy human subjects.

Introduction
Human semen contains a variety of different cytokines 
and other immunological factors that may affect 
physiologic events underlying male reproductive 
function (Politch et al. 2007). Cytokines, at physiological 
concentrations, constitute natural components of 
the seminal plasma and are intrinsically involved in 
normal reproductive physiology (Fraczek & Kurpisz 
2015). However, local or systemic perturbations of 
these cytokines have been associated with poor semen 
quality and may be critically dangerous for sperm 
membranes and DNA integrity (Fraczek & Kurpisz 
2015). Some authors have also suggested that high 
levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, including 
interleukin (IL)-1α/β, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α) upregulate the expression of genes 
responsible for the redox system in semen (Naz & 
Kaplan 1994, Fraczek & Kurpisz 2007). In this sense, 
an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation 
by human sperm was observed after incubation of 
ejaculated spermatozoa with recombinant cytokines 
at pathological concentrations (Martinez et al. 2007, 
Fraczek et al. 2008). Under physiological conditions, 
ROS play an important role in normal physiological 
processes to ensure appropriate fertilization, but the 
same ROS under pathological conditions, may induce 
oxidative stress and can negatively influence the quality 
of spermatozoa and impair their overall fertilizing 
capacity (Fraczek et al. 2008). Oxidative stress has 
been identified as an area of great attention because 
of the fact that ROS and their metabolites can lead to 
largely irreversible perturbations of semen parameters 
and sperm DNA integrity. The consequences are poor 
fertilization, poor embryonic development, pregnancy 
loss, birth defects and childhood cancer (De Iuliis et al. 
2006, Tremellen 2008, Aitken et al. 2010, Agarwal et al. 
2014). To preserve cellular damage by overproduction of 
ROS, seminal plasma contains a number of enzymatic 
and non-enzymatic antioxidants, which act as free 
radical scavengers to eliminate surplus ROS and allow

a balance between ROS generation and scavenging 
activity to be achieved. These antioxidants not only 
prevent these reactive species from being formed but also 
remove them before they can damage vital components 
of the sperm cell (Khosrowbeygi & Zarghami 2007, 
Yousefniapasha et al. 2015).
Over the last decade, a number of studies have been 
published on the relevance and effects of physical 
exercise on reproductive function (Safarinejad et al. 
2009, Tartibian & Maleki 2012a,b, Tartibian et al. 2012, 
Hajizadeh Maleki et al. 2013, Maleki et al. 2014, 
2016b, Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). Previous 
studies have reported that strenuous exercise in the form 
of long-distance running and endurance cycling may 
be deleterious for sperm production (De Souza et al. 
1994, Wise et al. 2011, Tartibian & Maleki 2012b, 
Tartibian et al. 2012, Maleki et al. 2014, 2016b, 
Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). In this sense, 
several studies from the author’s group demonstrated 
that exercise-induced changes in seminal markers of 
oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines were 
negatively correlated with semen quality parameters 
and sperm DNA integrity (Tartibian & Maleki 2012b, 
Maleki et al. 2014, 2016b, Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 
2015). However, another theory supported by more 
recent evidence suggests that exercise might improve 
the semen quality (Tartibian & Maleki 2012a, Hajizadeh 
Maleki et al. 2013, Gaskins et al. 2015). Data from 
recent studies in this context also consistently show an 
association between training status and markers of male 
reproduction (Tartibian & Maleki 2012a, Hajizadeh 
Maleki et al. 2013). A recent study in our lab, for 
instance, showed that in young, healthy male volunteers, 
the higher levels of leisure-time physical activity were 
associated with better semen parameters and DNA 
integrity as well as lower pro-antioxidant ratio, whereas 
both vigorous-intensity physical activities and sedentary 
life style were associated with perturbations in sperm 
DNA integrity and redox homeostasis as well as poor 
semen parameters (Tartibian & Maleki 2012a, Hajizadeh 
Maleki et al. 2013). These findings raise the hypothesis 
that the magnitude and permanence of reproductive 
response to exercise may differ with respect to factors 
such as type of exercise, magnitude of exercise exposure 
and the intensity of exercise protocol.
Although the modulating effects of exercise training 
on immunological and oxidative stress responses are 
widely recognized across body fluids, organs and tissues 
(Tartibian et al. 2011, 2015, Oh et al. 2013, Soares et al. 
2015), its implementation remains challenging in the 
area of male reproduction. Furthermore, the efficacy 
of different types of exercise training is still elusive in 
this field. Up to now, there are also limited data about 
the influence of chronic exercise on markers of male 
reproduction. Hence, taken together, we carried out a 
randomized controlled trial to evaluate comparatively 
the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training 
(MICT), high-intensity continuous training (HICT) and 
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on markers of male 
reproduction including seminal markers of oxidative 
stress and inflammation as well as semen quality and 
sperm DNA integrity in healthy human subjects.
Materials and methods
Ethical approval
The research protocol was approved by the Human Subject 
Internal Review Board committee of the Urmia University 
 
of Iran.
Experimental design and subjects
A total of 397 healthy men (aged 25–40) were enrolled in 
this study. Preliminary screening included a medical history 
and physical examination by medical specialist in Urmia 
University outpatient clinic. Before the initiation of the study 
protocol, each subject also performed a Bruce treadmill test 
(Ergo XELG90 Spezial, Woodway, Weil am Rhein, Germany) 
to determine the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). The 
initial speed and incline were 1.7 
mph and 10% respectively. 
The incline is incremented 2% every 3 
min and the speed 
is incremented 0.8 
mph every 3 
min until the treadmill 
reaches 22% grade and 6.0 
mph. Respiration parameters 
were analyzed using Oxygen record (E. Jaeger, Würzburg, 
Germany). All exercise tests were terminated voluntarily by 
the subjects or when established criteria of test termination 
were met (Bruce et al. 1963). To be eligible to participate in the 
study, subjects had to be married men 25–40 years of age; in 
good health, as determined by a normal physical examination 
and routine laboratory tests within the previous year; with no 
history of chronic illness, serious systemic diseases, testicular 
varicocele and genital infection; with no history of use of 
antioxidants as supplements like vitamins and medications 
that could alter the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) 
axis, such as anabolic steroids; with no history of use of 
cigarette and alcohol in the last 6 months; with regular eating 
patterns and with no history of depressive illness; with normal 
physical and sexual development; not working in professions 
where the activity might influence reproductive capacity; and 
with no relevant previous surgery (e.g., vasectomy reversal 
or varicocele removal). Individuals participating in a regular 
exercise program or accumulating 25 
min or more of moderate 
physical activity on most days of the week or those unable 
to participate in the physical activity program were excluded 
(Tartibian & Maleki 2012a,b, Tartibian et al. 2012, Hajizadeh 
Maleki et al. 2013, Maleki et al. 2014, 2016b, Hajizadeh 
Maleki & Tartibian 2015). Once they met the inclusion 
criteria, eligible subjects (n 
= 
280) provided written informed 
consent and entered the study and were randomly assigned 
to one of 4 groups: MICT (n 
= 
70), HICT (n 
= 
70), HIIT (n 
= 
70) 
and non-exercise (NON-EX, n 
= 
70) groups (Table 1). With an 
α 
= 
0.05, an effect size 
= 
0.89 and a power of 0.97, a sample 
size of 70 was recommended. Randomization was performed 
by random number generation, and group assignment was 
placed in a sealed envelope, which was opened by the study

(MICT, n 
= 
4; HICT, n 
= 
8; HIIT, n 
= 
5; and NON-EX, n 
= 
2) 
could not complete the study protocol and were excluded 
from the study. Thus, 261 subjects remained in the analysis 
(Fig. 1). Subjects had anthropometric characteristics (weight, 
BMI, body fat and waist circumference), aerobic capacity 
(VO2max), inflammatory markers (IL-β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α), 
oxidants (ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-isoprostane), 
antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and total 
antioxidant capacity (TAC)), semen parameters and sperm 
DNA damage measured at baseline (T1), the end of week 12 
(T2), the end of week 24 (T3), and 7 (T4) and 30 days (T5) after 
training.
MICT protocol
During the first 12 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, 
 
subjects walked or jogged on a treadmill 25–30 
min/day,

3–4 days/week, at 45–55% of their VO2max and then increased 
to 40–45 
min/day, 4–6 days/week at an intensity of 56–69% 
of VO2max during the final 12 weeks. All training sessions 
consisted of 10–15 
min of warm-up (40–45% VO2max) and 
cool-down (35–40% VO2max).
HICT protocol
During the first 12 weeks of high-intensity exercise training, 
subjects performed a 40- to 50-min treadmill running protocol, 
3 times a week, consisting of 10 
min of running at 70–75% of 
their VO2max (the work phase) followed by a 3 
min at 50–60% 
of VO2max (the recovery phase). This cycle was repeated four 
times within each exercise session. During the final 12 weeks, 
participants performed a 50- to 60-min treadmill running 
protocol, 3 times a week, consisting of 10 
min of running at 
75–85% of their VO2max (the work phase) followed by 3 
min 
at 50–60% of VO2max (the recovery phase). This cycle was 
repeated five times within each exercise session. All training 
sessions consisted of 10–15 
min of warm-up (50–55% VO2max) 
and cool-down (40–45% VO2max).
HIIT protocol
Subjects participated in supervised HIIT on treadmill 3 times a 
week for 24 weeks. During the first 12 weeks of HIIT, subjects 
performed 10 
× 
1 
-min intervals (75–85% of VO2max) each 
interspersed by 1 
min of recovery with 45–50% of VO2max. 
During the final 12 weeks, subjects performed 15 
× 
1 
-min 
intervals (85–95% of VO2max) followed by 1 
min of recovery 
with 45–50% of VO2max between each interval. In each training 
session, a warm-up of 10- to 15-min (50–55% VO2max) and a 
cool-down of 10–15 
min (40–45% VO2max) were performed.
All training sessions were performed at the same time of 
the day (17:00–19:00 
h) and instructions in correct exercise 
techniques and supervision of the participants throughout 
the entire training period were performed by a professional 
instructor and an experienced physician. Exercise adherence 
was documented through the use of Polar heart rate monitors, 
and subjects received feedback to adjust to the prescribed 
intensity. The NON-EX group subjects were instructed to 
maintain their current physical activity levels during the 
study as previously described. All subjects were requested to 
maintain their normal daily activities and not to modify their 
lifestyles during the 24-week intervention period other than 
to comply with the requirements of the study. Subjects were 
asked to refrain from exercising during the post-training period.
Dietary and medication intake measures
Trained dietitians collected dietary data over preceding 
12 months using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency 
questionnaire (FFQ) (Tartibian & Maleki 2012a,b, 
Tartibian et al. 
2012, Hajizadeh Maleki et al. 2013, Maleki et al. 2014, 
2016a,b, Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). Subjects were 
required to maintain their normal diet during the period of 
study and instructed to consume a diet as similar as possible in 
each sampling days. A detailed diary of all types and household 
measures of food and drinks consumed, including brand 
names, was recorded at baseline and 30 days after training. 
Data from the diary were used to check compliance with the 
diet and ensure that dietary intake did not vary more than that 
would be expected over the study. Subjects were required 
to avoid any prescriptive or over-the-counter medications/
supplements and foods that may influence the reproductive 
function one week before and during the study. Information 
on use of medications/supplements was also obtained through 
standard and self-reported questionnaires.
Anthropometric characteristics and aerobic capacity
Height and body weight were measured to the nearest 0.25 
cm 
and nearest 0.1 
kg respectively, using a floor model physician’s 
scale/stadiometer. Percent body fat and BMI were measured 
using a body fat analyzer (Omron HBF 306, Japan). Waist 
circumference also was measured with the standardized cloth 
tape measure. Additionally, VO2max was measured using the 
Bruce protocol (Bruce et al. 1963).
Measurements
Semen sampling and assays
All the subjects were given clear instructions on how to collect 
their semen samples, and all the samples were provided on 
site. Each subject collected his semen sample by masturbation 
into a sterile container. All subjects were advised to observe 
an abstinence of 3 days and to deliver semen sample on the 
4th day (Tartibian & Maleki 2012a,b, Tartibian et al. 2012, 
Hajizadeh Maleki et al. 2013, Maleki et al. 2014, 2016b, 
Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). Abstinence times did not 
differ between the groups. Samples were taken at baseline, 
12 weeks, 24 weeks and 7 and 30 days after training. All 
samples were taken 24 
h after the last exercise bout. After 
allowing at least 30 
min for liquefaction to occur, semen 
analysis was performed to measure semen volume, progressive 
motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration and number 
of spermatozoa according to World Health Organization 
(WHO) guidelines for the examination of human semen 
(WHO 2010). Liquefied semen samples were centrifuged 
at 10,000 
g for 10 
min. The supernatant seminal plasma was 
then frozen at −80°C until examination. Semen evaluations 
were performed on each sample by the same experienced 
technician throughout the study for the assessment of sperm 
DNA damage, seminal ROS, MDA, 8-isoprostane, SOD, 
catalase, TAC, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α.
Sperm DNA fragmentation assay
Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated with the terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated fluorescein-dUTP nick 
end labeling (TUNEL) assay using Apo-Direct kit (Pharmingen, 
San Diego, CA, USA) as established earlier (Gorczyca et al. 
1993, Mahfouz et al. 2009a). Briefly, 1–2 
million spermatozoa 
were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended 
in 
3.7% 
paraformaldehyde 
with 
adjustment 
of 
the 
concentration to 1–2 
× 
106 
sperm/mL and placed on ice for 
30–60 
min at 4°C. Thereafter, spermatozoa were again washed 
to remove the paraformaldehyde and then resuspended in

70% ice-cold ethanol. Specimens were kept at −20°C until 
the run time. In addition, we also included an internal set of 
samples that were tested negative or positive for DNA damage 
with each run. After a second wash in PBS to remove the 
ethanol, sperm pellets were resuspended in 50 
µL of the freshly 
prepared staining solution for 60 
min at 37°C. According to 
the manufacturer’s instructions, the staining solution contains 
terminal deoxytransferase (TdT) enzyme, TdT reaction buffer, 
fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged deoxyuridine triphosphate 
nucleotides (FITC-dUTP) and distilled water. All specimens 
were further washed in rinse buffer to remove the unbound 
reaction solution, resuspended in 0.5 
mL of propidium iodide/
RNase solution and incubated for 30 
min in the dark at room 
temperature. All fluorescence signals of labeled spermatozoa 
were analyzed by the flow cytometer FACScan (Becton 
Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). About 10,000 spermatozoa 
were examined for each assay at a flow rate of less than 
100 
cells/s. The excitation wavelength was 488 
nm supplied by 
an argon laser at 15 
mW. Green fluorescence (480–530 
nm) 
was measured in the FL-1 channel, and red fluorescence 
 
(580–630 
nm) was measured in the FL-2 channel. Gating was 
done to exclude debris and aggregates using 90° and forward-
angle light scatter. Both percentage of positive cells and the 
mean fluorescence were calculated on a 1023-channel 
scale using the flow cytometer software FlowJo version 6.2.4 
(FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA). The percentage of positive 
cells (TUNEL+ve) was calculated on a 1023-channel scale 
using the flow cytometer software (FlowJo Mac version 8.2.4, 
FlowJo, LLC) (Mahfouz et al. 2009b).
ROS assay
Levels of ROS were measured by a chemiluminescence assay 
(Moein et al. 2007). Fresh semen specimens were centrifuged 
at 300 
g for 7 
min, and seminal plasma was removed. The 
pellet was washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and 
resuspended in the same media. Ten milliliter of luminal 
(5-amino-2,3 dihydro-1,4 phthalazinedione; Sigma Chemical) 
were used as a probe and were added to the aliquot. A negative 
control was prepared by adding 10 
µL of PBS. The ROS levels 
were assessed by measuring chemiluminescence activity with 
an Autolamat LB 935 Luminometer (Berthold technologies, 
Bad-wildbad, Germany) in the integrated mode for 15 
min. 
The results were expressed as RLU (relative light unit) per 
20 
million spermatozoa.
Lipid peroxidation (LPO) assay
The LPO in seminal plasma was estimated by determining the 
MDA levels. Briefly, to prevent the oxidation of polyunsaturated 
free fatty acids during the assay, 0.5 
mL of seminal plasma 
was added to 0.5 
mL of Tris–hydrogen chloride (HCl) 0.04 
M 
and acetonitrile containing 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene 
(BHT). After derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine 
according to the method of Shara and coworkers (1992) with 
minor modifications, the samples were immediately stirred 
and extracted with 5 
mL of pentane; finally, the samples were 
dried using nitrogen and analyzed by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC). A calibration curve with 
concentrations of MDA ranging from 0.5 to 10 
nmol/mL 
was used for the MDA quantifications. The MDA hydrazone 
was 
quantified 
by 
isocratic 
high-performance 
liquid 
chromatography using a Waters 600 E System Controller HPLC 
(Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a Waters Dual k 2487 UV 
detector (Milford, MA, USA) set at 307 
nm. A 5 
L ultrasphere 
ODS column C18 (Beckman, San Ramon, CA, USA) was 
used to separate the hydrazone derivative at the flow rate of 
 
0.8 
mL/min with the acetonitrile (45%)–HCl 0.01 
M (55%) 
as mobile phase. The MDA concentrations were calculated 
by peak areas determined using an Agilent 3395 integrator 
(Agilent Technologies) (Shara et al. 1992).
8-Isoprostane assay
We assessed free form of 8-Isoprostane and only the fraction 
shedded to seminal plasma from cell membranes.
Free 8-isoprostane purification
Free 8-isoprostane was purified by affinity chromatography 
method 
(Nonaka-Sarukawa 
et 
al. 
2003). 
We 
used 
commercially available affinity column (Cayman Chemical, 
Ann Arbor, MI, USA). All samples were centrifuged at 15,000 
g 
for isolation of particulates and precipitates. Then, the 
supernatant was diluted 1:5 with column buffer and applied 
to the column. Other procedures were conducted according 
to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The ethanol 
washed 8-Isoprostane was stored at −80°C until measurement.
Free 8-isoprostane
At first, the elution solution was evaporated to dryness using 
a vacuum centrifugation. Then, the concentration of free 
8-Isoprostane was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) 
method (Nonaka-Sarukawa et al. 2003). We used commercially 
available EIA method (Cayman Chemical). The procedure for 
the EIA was followed according to the instructions provided 
by the manufacturer. The sample volume used was 50 
μL. 
Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 
nm using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (STAT 
FAX 2100, St Louis, MO, USA). The levels of free 8-Isoprostane 
were presented as ng/mL. The intra-assay coefficient of 
variation was less than 10%.
TAC assay
TAC was measured by colorimetric assay (Meucci et al. 2003, 
Said et al. 2003). We used commercially available colorimetric 
method (Randox Laboratories Ltd, UK). The frozen seminal 
plasma was thawed by placing the vials in a water bath at 
37°C for 20 
min and immediately assessed for its antioxidant 
capacity. Twenty microliters of seminal plasma were added 
to 1 
mL of the reconstituted chromogen, 2,2′-azino-di-(3-
ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate) (ABTS)-metmyoglobin (10 
mL 
vial with 10 
mL of phosphate-buffered saline buffer). Twenty 
microliters of Trolox (6-hydroxyl-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-
2-carboxylic acid) at a concentration of 1.71 
mmol/L was used 
as the standard, whereas 20 
μL of deionized water was used as 
a blank. One milliliter of chromogen was added to the standard 
and blank samples. With spectrophotometer adjusted at a 
wavelength of 600 
nm, the initial absorbance (A1) was read.

Two hundred microliters of H2O2 (250 
μmol/L) was then added 
to all tubes (standard, blank and sample), and absorbance 
(A2) was read exactly after 3 
min. The difference between A2 
and A1 (ΔA) was calculated. The TAC of the sample was then 
calculated by the following formula:
TAC =
Concentration of the standard
A Blank
A sample
A b
´ (
)
D
-D
D
lank
A standard
-D
(
)
In this equation, A1 is the initial absorbance rate, A2 is the 
final absorbance rate and ΔA is the difference between A2 
 
and A1.
SOD activity assay
SOD activity was measured by colorimetric assay (Zini et al. 
2002). We used commercially available colorimetric method 
(Randox Laboratories Ltd, Antrim, UK). This method employs 
xanthine and xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide radicals, 
which 
reacts 
with 
2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5-
phenyltetrazoliumchloride (INT) to form red formazan dye. 
The SOD activity is then measured by the degree of inhibition 
of this reaction. One unit of SOD inhibits the reduction of INT 
by 50% under the conditions of the assay. After thawing, the 
seminal plasma was diluted 30-fold with 10 
mM phosphate 
buffer, pH 7.0. Assay was performed at 37°C. Phosphate buffer 
was used as blank. Mixed substrate and xanthine oxidase were 
added into standards and sample tubes and vortexed well. 
With spectrophotometer adjusted at a wavelength of 505 
nm, 
the initial absorbance (A1) was read. Final absorbance (A2) 
was read exactly after 3 
min. Percentages of inhibition of 
standards and samples were calculated. The SOD activity was 
measured using calibration curve of percentage inhibition for 
each standard against Log10 of standards, and SOD activity 
was expressed as U/mL.
Catalase activity assay
Catalase activity was estimated by the method of Aebi (Aebi 
1984). Catalase can degrade hydrogen peroxide, which can 
be measured directly by the decrease in the absorbance at 
240 
nm. The hydrogen peroxide was diluted with phosphate 
buffer pH 7.0 and its initial absorbance was adjusted between 
0.5 and 0.6 absorbance unit at 240 
nm. The decrease in the 
absorbance was measured. One unit of catalase activity was 
defined as the amount of catalase that was absorbed in 30 
s 
at 25°C. The catalase activity was then calculated from the 
change in absorbance and finally expressed as U/mL.
Cytokines assay
The Predicta (Cambridge, MA, USA) IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-
α enzyme immunoassay kits contain a 96-well microtiter plate 
precoated with monoclonal antibody to a proper cytokine. 
A measured volume of the studied samples, either standard 
substance or control buffer, was added to each test well 
and incubated to allow any cytokine present to be captured 
by antibodies on the microtiter plate. The wells were then 
washed, and a biotin-labeled polyclonal antibody to the tested 
cytokine was added to bind the captured IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 or 
TNF-α. The wells were washed again and a peroxidase-labeled 
avidin reagent was added to attach the biotin (in the immune 
complex) on the plate. After incubation, the wells were washed 
and a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G 
was added to attach the polyclonal antibody (in the immune 
complex) on the plate. After a third wash, a substrate buffer 
(peroxide) and chromogen (tetramethylbenzidine) were added 
to the wells, thereby producing a blue color in the presence 
of peroxidase. The color reaction was stopped by the addition 
of sulfuric acid, which converted the blue color to yellow. The 
intensity of the colorimetric reactions was in a direct proportion 
to the amount of tested cytokine present in the studied sample 
or standard. The absorbance was read with Multiscan Plus 
(Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) at 450 
nm, and a standard 
curve was constructed to quantitate cytokine concentrations. 
The results were expressed as pg/mL (Sanocka et al. 2003).
Statistical analysis
Group differences were determined using a one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures, for continuous 
variables. If the main effects F ratio was significant, differences 
among groups were subsequently identified using a Bonferroni 
post hoc analysis. Partial correlation and mixed model 
regression coefficients were used to evaluate the association 
between the variables studied. The statistical software program 
SPSS (SPSS, version 23) for windows was used for data analysis. 
All statistical tests were performed and considered significant 
at a P 
≤ 
0.05.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the four study groups did not 
show any significant differences among groups in weight, 
BMI, body fat, waist circumference, VO2max, semen 
volume, progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm 
concentration, number of spermatozoa, percentage of 
TUNEL-positive spermatozoa, SOD, catalase, TAC, 
ROS, MDA, 8-isoprostane, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α 
(P 
> 
0.05).
Dietary and medication intake
Subjects’ dietary intakes including the quality, quantity 
and frequency of consumption of foods including red 
meat, chicken, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits and milky 
products were similar in all groups, and the dietary 
intakes between the groups or within the groups did not 
alter more than would be expected over the 24 weeks of 
the study (P 
> 
0.05).
Anthropometric characteristics and aerobic capacity
In the MICT and HIIT groups, weight, body fat percent, 
waist circumference and VO2max were significantly 
modulated by 12 and 24 weeks of exercise training 
compared to baseline (P

after training. Only semen volume and progressive 
motility remained significantly altered compared to 
baseline at 30 days after training (P 
< 
0.05) (Fig. 3). In 
the HICT group, sperm concentration was significantly 
modulated by 12 and 24 weeks of exercise training 
compared to baseline (P 
< 
0.05). Progressive motility 
and sperm morphology were significantly altered after 
24 weeks of training protocol compared to baseline 
(P

training compared to baseline. These alterations were 
maintained 7 days after training (P 
< 
0.05) (Table 3). 
Significantly lower values were observed for IL-1β, IL-6, 
IL-8 and TNF-α in the MICT, HICT and HIIT groups 
compared with the NON-EX group (P 
< 
0.05). At 12 
and 24 weeks, the MICT changes of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 
were significantly greater than those observed in any of 
the other groups (P 
< 
0.05). The MICT concentrations 
of TNF-α were significantly lower than those in the 
HIIT and NON-EX groups (P 
<

group demonstrated no significant changes in seminal 
proinflammatory cytokines in the 24 weeks (P 
>

(Table 3).
Correlations
The association among body composition, maximal 
oxygen consumption, oxidants, antioxidants and 
cytokines with semen parameters and sperm DNA 
damage in all groups are shown in Table 4. Significant 
negative correlations were observed among progressive 
motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, 
number of spermatozoa and percentage of TUNEL-
positive spermatozoa with weight, BMI, body fat, 
waist circumference, ROS, MDA, 8-isoprostane, 
IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α (Table 4). Results from the 
mixed model regression revealed that each unit (%) 
increase in progressive motility was associated with 
a 4.3 kg reduction in weight, a 1.6 kg/m2 reduction in 
BMI, a 3.4% reduction in body fat, a 5.3 cm reduction 
in waist circumference, a 3.1 RLU reduction in 
ROS, a 2.2 nmol/mL reduction in MDA, a 0.9 ng/mL 
reduction in 8-isoprostane, a 4.9 pg/mL reduction 
in IL-1β, a 2.6 pg/mL reduction in IL-6, a 2.7 pg/mL 
reduction in IL-8 and finally a 4.6 pg/mL reduction in 
TNF-α. Furthermore, each unit (%) increase in sperm 
morphology was associated with a 4.1 kg reduction in 
weight, a 1.7 kg/m2 reduction in BMI, a 2.1% reduction 
in body fat, a 6.3 cm reduction in waist circumference, 
a 3.3 RLU reduction in ROS, a 1.2 nmol/mL reduction 
in MDA, a 1.7 ng/mL reduction in 8-isoprostane, a 
5.1 pg/mL reduction in IL-1β, a 2.2 pg/mL reduction 
in IL-6, a 3.4 pg/mL reduction in IL-8 and finally 
a 5.8 pg/mL reduction in TNF-α. Likewise, each 
unit (106) increase in number of spermatozoa was 
associated with a 3.1 kg reduction in weight, a 
 
0.8 kg/m2 reduction in BMI, a 0.8% reduction in body 
fat, a 3.3 cm reduction in waist circumference, a 
1.8 RLU reduction in ROS, a 0.9 nmol/mL reduction 
in MDA, a 0.8 ng/mL reduction in 8-isoprostane, a 
3.3 pg/mL reduction in IL-1β, a 1.1 pg/mL reduction 
in IL-6, a 1.8 pg/mL reduction in IL-8 and finally a 
2.1 pg/mL reduction in TNF-α. Additionally, each unit 
(%) improvement in TUNEL-positive spermatozoa was 
associated with a 4.0 kg reduction in weight, a 1.9 kg/m2 
reduction in BMI, a 1.0% reduction in body fat,

Significant positive correlations were also observed 
among progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm 
concentration, number of spermatozoa and percentage 
of TUNEL-positive spermatozoa with SOD, catalase 
and TAC (Table 4). Each unit (%) increase in progressive 
motility was associated with a 1.1 
U/mL increase in 
SOD, a 4.9 U/mL increase in catalase and finally a 
1.7 nM increase in TAC. Also, each unit (%) increase 
in sperm morphology was associated with a 2.7 
U/mL 
 
increase in SOD, a 3.2 
U/mL increase in catalase 
and finally a 3.7 nM increase in TAC. Similarly, each 
unit (×106) increase in number of spermatozoa was 
associated with a 1.3 
U/mL increase in SOD, a 2.5 
U/mL 
 
increase in catalase and finally a 1.9 
nM increase in TAC 
(Table 4). Percentages of TUNEL-positive spermatozoa 
and VO2max levels were negatively correlated, whereas 
positive correlations between VO2max, progressive 
motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration 
and number of spermatozoa were noted. The mixed-
model regression showed that each unit increase in 
VO2max levels resulted in 2.5% increase in percentages 
of TUNEL-positive spermatozoa, and each unit 
increase in VO2max levels was associated with a 1.4% 
increase in progressive motility, a 2.1% increase in 
sperm morphology, a 1.4 × 106/mL increase in sperm 
concentration and finally a 1.1 × 106 increase in number 
of spermatozoa (Table 4).
Discussion
The results showed that 24 weeks of MICT, HICT and 
HIIT decreased seminal markers of oxidative stress and 
inflammation with different kinetics for the three types 
of exercise, and these changes were correlated with 
improvements in semen quality parameters and sperm 
DNA integrity in healthy human subjects. These data 
clearly show that MICT is superior to HICT and HIIT 
in the improvements of markers of male reproductive 
function, representing adaptation to moderate-intensity 
regular training.
To date, no reports have conducted to examine the 
seminal cytokines response to moderate-intensity aerobic 
exercise training. However, there is some evidence 
that aerobic exercise training is anti-inflammatory, and 
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has been shown 
to attenuate the circulating markers of inflammation in 
both healthy and diseased populations (Tartibian et al. 
2011, 2015, Abd El-Kader et al. 2013). Recently, a 
3-month randomized trial aerobic exercise training 
showed reduced plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-2 
and IL-6 among obese type 2 diabetic patients (Abd 
El-Kader et al. 2013). Likewise, previous studies have 
also shown decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), 
prostaglandin (PG) E2, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 levels with 
16 and 24 weeks of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise 
training in postmenopausal women (Tartibian et al. 2011, 
2015). Our results indicate that seminal IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 
and TNF-α were significantly attenuated at both 12 
and 24 weeks after MICT. However, in the HIIT group, 
significant alterations in seminal cytokines observed 
only after 24 weeks of the exercise intervention. Our 
data also show an improvement in seminal inflammatory 
mediators after HICT as reflected by significant decreases 
in IL-6 and TNF-α at 24 weeks. It seems that MICT can 
elicit greater cytokine adaptations than HICT and HIIT. 
Reasons for this include improvements in seminal 
markers of inflammation that are more remarkable 
when exercise is performed at moderate intensities. 
Single bouts of intense exercise have been shown to 
induce systemic inflammatory responses similar to those 
associated with injury (Kaspar et al. 2016). However, 
evidence suggests that long-term exercise training 
reduces plasma inflammatory states (Homaee et al. 
2014). The mechanisms by which exercise training 
attenuates seminal proinflammatory cytokines are 
still not fully understood; however, it is plausible that 
production of proinflammatory mediators induced 
by every single session of HICT and HIIT could be 
progressively reduced as confirmed by previous studies 
(Homaee et al. 2014). Moreover, it has been suggested 
that exercise training lowers resting proinflammatory 
mediators by upregulating the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine levels across body fluids, organs and tissues 
(Gleeson et al. 2006). So, the 24 weeks of training could 
have allowed enough time for the immune systems to 
reduce the acute elevation of each single session of high-
intensity training. Likewise, exercise-induced weight 
loss appears to lower levels of circulating cytokines, and 
the effect is greater with larger amounts of weight loss 
(Lambert et al. 2008). Therefore, in the present study, it 
seems exercise-induced changes in body composition 
(weight, BMI, fat% and waist circumference) also 
mediated these effects. Our finding regarding the 
decrease in proinflammatory cytokines in the HICT 
 
group was somewhat unexpected because previous 
studies by our team have reported significant increases 
in seminal IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α after chronic 
high-intensity cycling training in male road cyclists 
(Maleki et al. 2014, Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). 
These discrepant findings may be due to the different 
training methods used to evaluate chronic cytokines 
responses to exercise training as well as different 
populations studied. The physiological and metabolic 
factors associated with cycling performance and factors 
inherent to cycling training, such as compression of 
the area by the bike saddle and the tight culottes worn, 
may be other possible contributing factors for these 
discrepant results. These data demonstrate that exercise 
training is effective in reducing seminal proinflammatory 
cytokines levels in healthy human subjects and indicate 
that the anti-inflammatory effect is dependent on the 
characteristics of exercise modalities, including volume, 
intensity and type.

It is known that moderate-intensity aerobic training 
improves oxidative stress status in a wide range of 
body fluids, cells and/or tissues (Ennezat et al. 2001, 
Edwards et al. 2004, Linke et al. 2005). In samples of 
skeletal muscle and plasma, twelve weeks of moderate-
intensity aerobic exercise, for instance, has been 
shown to induce significant decreases in markers of 
oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation as well promote 
an upregulation in antioxidant defense, evident by an 
elevation in the activity of SOD, glutathione peroxidase 
and catalase (Ennezat et al. 2001, Edwards et al. 2004, 
Linke et al. 2005). Similar studies, in type 2 diabetics 
and obese individuals, reported a decrease in serum 
and plasma lipid peroxidation as well as an increase 
in glutathione and catalase activity after six months of 
moderate-intensity (50–70% HRmax) aerobic exercise 
protocol (Lazarevic et al. 2006, Rector et al. 2007). In the 
present study, pro- and antioxidants measurements were 
not made in blood; however, relatively good correlations 
have previously been reported between systemic 
and seminal oxidative stress by other investigators 
(Shamsi et al. 2010, Benedetti et al. 2012). Our data 
are in agreement with these results as we observed 
significant attenuation in oxidative stress after exercise 
in the MICT group. In the present study, significant 
alterations in SOD, TAC and 8-isoprostane observed 
only after 24 weeks of MICT (56–69% VO2max), but not 
after 12 weeks (45–55% VO2max). In contrast, catalase, 
ROS and MDA changes were observed after 12 weeks 
of the intervention. Thus, the training duration and 
intensity seem to be important variables affecting these 
adaptations. These findings also raise the hypothesis 
that seminal markers of oxidative stress tend to respond 
differently to exercise intervention.
A trend toward reductions of resting seminal 
antioxidants including SOD, TAC and catalase as well 
as increases of oxidative stress markers, evident by an 
elevation in the seminal concentrations of ROS, MDA 
and 8-isoprostane, were shown in male road cyclists 
after chronic intensive cycling training (≥82.9% VO2max) 
(Tartibian & Maleki 2012b, Maleki et al. 2014, 2016b, 
Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). Conversely, in the 
study by Miyazaki and coworkers, a 12-week strenuous 
endurance training (running at 80% maximal exercise 
heart rate for 60 min/day, 5 days/week) resulted in 
significant increases in resting SOD and GPX activities 
in erythrocytes. This upregulation in antioxidant 
defenses was also accompanied by a reduction in 
exercise-induced lipid peroxidation in erythrocyte 
membrane (Miyazaki et al. 2001). Our data have shown 
attenuation in oxidative stress only after 24 weeks of 
the HICT as reflected by a decrease in ROS levels as 
well as increases in SOD and catalase activities. The 
HICT intervention also induced positive but non-
significant reductions in MDA and 8-isoprostane 
concentrations. This response seems to be affected by 
the training duration and intensity as there were no 
significant changes in these parameters at 12 weeks of 
the intervention in this group.
As for HIIT, the effects on seminal markers of oxidative 
stress are not well understood yet; however, our findings 
parallel previous reports that HIIT promotes antioxidant 
defense system (Tucker et al. 2015, Wadley et al. 2016) 
and decreases markers of oxidative stress in several 
tissue compartments in both healthy and diseased 
populations (Tucker et al. 2015, Wadley et al. 2016). 
Other investigators previously reported (Wadley et al. 
2016) that HIIT was more effective at upregulating 
mRNA expression of renal SOD1 and catalase, 
compared to low-intensity exercise. However, in 
the present study, compared to HICT and HIIT, MICT 
induced significantly more profound effects on oxidant/
antioxidant markers in seminal plasma. This divergence 
could be explained, in part, by the diversity of protocols 
implemented (training methods, protocol duration, 
training volume, age of participants, etc.), tissue-specific 
oxidative stress responses and the individual responses 
of each subject. In addition, improvements in seminal 
oxidative status were apparent in HIIT compared to 
HICT, as HIIT intervention resulted in marked changes 
in seminal TAC and MDA than those seen in the HICT 
group. Mechanisms responsible for beneficial effects 
of chronic exercise on redox balance are training-
induced upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, reduced 
mitochondrial ROS production and increase in 
radical scavenging capacity of body tissues and fluids 
(Finaud et al. 2006, Gomes et al. 2012). Exercise-
induced upregulation of the antioxidant defense in the 
HICT and HIIT groups may also explain the observed 
reductions in seminal markers of oxidative stress in 
these groups. However, one should bear in mind that, 
although the ROS family induces oxidative damages 
when the balance between the generation of ROS and 
the capacity of antioxidation systems to eliminate them 
is disturbed, in recent years, also a significant number 
of research studies have documented a role of ROS as 
second messengers of cell signaling responsible for the 
prevention of diseases either by provoking antioxidant 
response (Meilhac et al. 2001) or other adaptations to 
exercise via activating useful cellular redox-sensitive 
signaling pathways (Gomez-Cabrera et al. 2005, Ji 
2007, Kang et al. 2009). Exercise-induced ROS may 
therefore serve also as signaling molecules to enhance 
the expression of cytoprotective proteins and to preserve 
some other normal physiological functions (Li 2013).
Seminal markers of oxidative stress and inflammation 
have been linked to sperm function and DNA integrity 
(Sanocka et al. 2003, Fraczek et al. 2008, Fraczek & 
Kurpisz 2015). Oxidative stress in seminal plasma 
have been associated with negative changes in sperm 
concentration, motility and morphology (Khosrowbeygi 
& Zarghami 2007, Agarwal et al. 2014) and can cause 
potential damage to the plasma membrane of the sperm 
cell and DNA integrity (Tremellen 2008), leading to poor

semen quality and sperm dysfunction. Elevated levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in seminal plasma have also 
been demonstrated as the factors linked with a decrease 
in number of spermatozoa, progressive motility, sperm 
morphology as well as sperm vitality (Fraczek & Kurpisz 
2015). These cytokines may adversely affect sperm cell 
function and the reproductive process (Sanocka et al. 
2003, Fraczek et al. 2008, Fraczek & Kurpisz 2015). The 
redox imbalance is probably the major etiological factor 
responsible for the destructive effects of proinflammatory 
cytokines on sperm DNA integrity (Sanocka et al. 2003, 
Fraczek et al. 2008).
Our results indicate that progressive motility, sperm 
morphology, sperm concentration and number of 
spermatozoa were significantly elevated at both 12 and 
24 weeks after MICT.
In addition to the enhancement of semen quality, our 
data show an improvement in semen volume and sperm 
DNA integrity after MICT as reflected by a decrease 
in percentages of TUNNEL-positive spermatozoa at 
24 weeks. Several studies (Tartibian & Maleki 2012a, 
Hajizadeh Maleki et al. 2013) have reported that low-to-
moderate-intensity recreational physical activities causes 
an improvement in semen parameters as well as sperm 
DNA integrity than either vigorous-intensity physical 
activities or sedentary life style. It has been proposed 
that low-to-moderate-intensity recreational physical 
activity-induced adaptations in seminal antioxidant 
defense system mediated these effects (Tartibian & 
Maleki 2012a, Hajizadeh Maleki et al. 2013). Our 
data confirm and extend these findings as we observed 
positive correlations among semen quality parameters, 
sperm DNA integrity and antioxidants. Seminal markers 
of oxidative stress also were significantly negatively 
associated with sperm DNA integrity and semen quality 
parameters.
Additionally, significant increases in progressive 
motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration as 
well as marked decreases in percentages of TUNEL-
positive spermatozoa observed only after 24 weeks 
of both HICT and HIIT interventions, but not after 
12 weeks. We could not find any research papers that 
investigated the impact of HICT on male reproductive 
function; however, based on findings of reduced semen 
quality in long-distance runners and endurance cyclists, 
several studies have reported detrimental effects of 
strenuous exercise on male reproductive function (De 
Souza et al. 1994, Miller et al. 1997, Safarinejad et al. 
2009, Tartibian & Maleki 2012b, Maleki et al. 2014, 
2016b, Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). Increased 
percentages of TUNEL-positive spermatozoa were also 
observed in male road cyclists after intensive cycling 
training (Maleki et al. 2016b). The authors suggested 
that this increase may be due to either exercise-induced 
oxidative stress or increased intrascrotal temperature 
produced mainly by the bike saddle and the tight 
clothes worn during long rides in male road cyclists 
(Maleki et al. 2016b). Different training methods and 
different assessment parameters as well as different 
groups of subjects were involved may contribute to the 
inconsistent findings in the present study. In this study, 
improved sperm DNA integrity after HIIT intervention are 
consistent with Vezzoli and coworkers who investigated 
the effect of 8 weeks of high-intensity discontinuous 
training (at 120–140% VO2peak) on 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-
guanosine (8-OH-dG) as a biomarker of DNA base 
modifications in long-distance runners and showed a 
decrease (∼25%) in urinary 8-OH-dG excretion after 
exercise (Vezzoli et al. 2014). These findings may be 
influenced by increases in endogenous antioxidant 
status, upregulation of antioxidant capacity, increase in 
radical scavenging capacity of spermatozoa or seminal 
plasma as well as upregulation in DNA damage-
repairing enzymes after participation in HICT and 
HIIT interventions. In addition, the results confirmed 
that attenuation of seminal proinflammatory cytokines 
with chronic exercise is associated with improvements 
in semen quality and DNA integrity in this cohort of 
healthy subjects, which is consistent with previous 
reports (Sanocka et al. 2003, Fraczek & Kurpisz 2007, 
2015, Fraczek et al. 2008, Tartibian & Maleki 2012b, 
Hajizadeh Maleki et al. 2013, Maleki et al. 2014, 
Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian 2015). These findings 
are important to the fields of exercise science and 
reproductive function because they provide substantial 
evidence regarding the immunological and oxidative 
stress responses of human semen to physical exercise. 
Though all exercise modalities induced significant 
alterations in semen quality parameters and sperm DNA 
integrity, the changes were more pronounced in the 
MICT group than those observed in the HICT and HIIT 
groups. This current investigation also presents evidence 
for intensity- and duration-dependent alterations in 
semen quality parameters and sperm DNA integrity after 
different exercise modalities, as these variables changed 
exponentially in relation to exercise intensity and 
duration. Therefore, the magnitude and extent of semen 
parameters and DNA integrity responses to physical 
exercise seem to be associated with characteristics 
of exercise intervention such as type, intensity and 
duration.
Also, it should be pointed out that, although the 
allotted time was substantially higher for the HICT group, 
there was no increased benefit. Thus, with the fewer 
number and lower duration of exercise sessions as those 
in the HICT group, subjects in the HIIT group achieved 
the same or even better improvements in markers of 
male reproductive function, changes that can greatly 
influence male reproductive health and functions. This 
indicates that the short high-intensity stimuli (on average 
85% of VO2max) were effective in provoking a better 
response than that of a HICT at 70–85% of VO2max.
In addition, the results confirmed that decreases 
in weight, BMI, fat% and waist circumference are

associated with improvements in semen quality 
parameters and sperm DNA integrity, which is 
consistent with previous reports (Kort et al. 2006, 
Kriegel et al. 2009). Reviewed elsewhere, research 
has substantiated the inverse relationship between 
body composition and male reproductive potential 
(Kort et al. 2006, Kriegel et al. 2009). There is some 
evidence that excessive body fat in men reduces 
sperm concentration (Kort et al. 2006), sperm motility 
(Kort et al. 2006) and sperm morphology (Kriegel et al. 
2009). Despite the use of a variety of different 
methodologies to measure sperm DNA integrity, 
several human studies have also demonstrated that a 
relationship exists between obesity and reduced sperm 
DNA integrity (Kort et al. 2006, Kriegel et al. 2009). 
In the present investigation also respectively, negative 
and positive correlations were found between VO2max 
with percentages of TUNEL-positive spermatozoa 
and semen quality parameters. Although the exact 
mechanisms by which improvements in cardio-
respiratory fitness benefits male reproductive potential 
are not clear yet, several lines of evidence have 
correlated post-exercise alterations in VO2max, among 
others, to improved body composition measures (lean-
mass:fat-mass) (Casla et al. 2015). Therefore, in the 
present study, post-exercise improvements in semen 
quality and sperm DNA integrity are likely related, in 
part, to the effects of exercise training on measures of 
body composition and cardio-respiratory fitness.
This study is limited mainly by the difference in 
volume and total work performed. Future studies may 
want to verify whether volume- and work-matched 
MICT, HICT and HIIE exhibit different reproductive 
responses. However, to the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first study in which three different exercise 
modalities have been compared before and after 
training with a control group, with respect to the 
markers of male reproductive function in healthy 
human subjects.
In conclusion, the present study adds to this body of 
evidence and shows seminal markers of inflammation 
and oxidative stress improved significantly after 
24 weeks of MICT, HICT or HIIT; and these changes 
were correspond with favorable improvements in semen 
quality parameters and sperm DNA integrity. These 
results further indicate that MICT was more beneficial 
in improving markers of male reproductive function, 
compared to HICT and HIIT. These observations suggest 
that the intensity, duration and type of exercise training 
could be taken into consideration when investigating 
reproductive responses to exercise training in men. 
It remains to be determined how changes in seminal 
markers of male reproductive function may be 
connected with reproductive outcomes in healthy 
human subjects.
