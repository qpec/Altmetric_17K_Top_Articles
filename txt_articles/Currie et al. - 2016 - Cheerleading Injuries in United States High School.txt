States High Schools

abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Approximately 400 000 students participate in US high school 
cheerleading annually, including 123 386 involved in competitive spirit squads. The 
degree of athleticism and the difficulty of cheerleading skills have increased in recent 
decades, renewing safety concerns. This study describes the epidemiology of high school 
cheerleading injuries and compares cheerleading injury rates and patterns relative to other 
sports.
METHODS: Data collected by the longitudinal, National High School Sports-Related Injury 
Surveillance Study from 2009/2010 through 2013/2014 were analyzed.
RESULTS: Injury rates in cheerleading ranked 18th of 22 sports, with an overall injury rate of 
0.71 per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). Competition (0.85) and practice (0.76) injury rates 
were similar, whereas performance rates were lower (0.49). Although 96.8% of injured 
cheerleaders were girls, the overall injury rate was higher in boys (1.33 vs 0.69, rate ratio 
[RR]: 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30–2.88). Although concussions were the most 
common cheerleading injury (31.1% of injuries), concussion rates were significantly lower 
in cheerleading (2.21 per 10 000 athlete-exposures) than all other sports combined (3.78; 
RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.51–0.66) and all other girls’ sports (2.70; RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72–0.93). 
Over half of all injuries occurred during stunts (53.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although safety remains a concern among cheerleaders, overall injury rates 
are lower than most other high school sports. Although overall injury rates are relatively 
low, cheerleading injuries may be more severe when they do occur. A detailed knowledge of 
cheerleading injury patterns relative to other sports is needed to drive targeted, evidence-
based prevention efforts.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Approximately 
65% of all sports-related catastrophic injuries 
among high-school girls reportedly result from 
cheerleading. However, some studies have indicated 
that overall cheerleading injury rates may be lower 
than or comparable to other sports within this age 
group.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study used data 
from a national injury surveillance system to 
directly compare injury rates between high school-
sanctioned cheerleading and other sports. This 
study also details the epidemiology of cheerleading 
injuries, with particular emphasis on concussions.

Participation in cheerleading has 
increased for individuals aged 6 
years and older from 3 039 000 
in 1990 to 3 579 000 in 2003.1 
Although cheerleading’s history 
is long, until relatively recently it 
was not considered a sport, even 
if participants were athletic. To 
establish itself as a sport, a relatively 
new high school sanctioned event, 
competitive spirit, is now available. 
Increases in skill difficulty and 
athleticism required of high school 
cheerleaders has renewed safety 
concerns.2,3 The National Federation 
of State High School Associations 
(NFHS) estimates approximately 
400 000 students participate in US 
high school cheerleading annually, 
including 123 386 involved in 
competitive spirit squads.4,5 These 
numbers rank cheerleading the 
fourth most popular high school girls’ 
athletic activity, and rank competitive 
spirit squads alone as the ninth most 
popular high school girls’ sport.
Although several studies have 
described cheerleading injury 
epidemiology generally,6–10 in terms 
of specific activities, mechanisms or 
diagnoses,11–13 injuries presenting 
to emergency departments14 
and catastrophic injuries,15,16 no 
study to date has examined the 
injury epidemiology of high school 
sanctioned cheerleading, comparing it 
to other sports. Using a large national 
sports injury surveillance data set, 
this study aimed to (1) describe 
injury rates and patterns in high 
school cheerleading, (2) compare 
injury rates and patterns by type of 
exposure (ie, practice, competition, or 
performance), and (3) compare injury 
rates and patterns in high school 
cheerleading to other sports.
METHODS
Data Collection
This study used data collected by High 
School Reporting Information Online 
(RIO), an Internet-based high school 
sports injury surveillance system 
described previously.17,18 Briefly, the 
study began during the 2005/2006 
academic year, using a nationally 
representative sample of US high 
schools with certified athletic trainers 
(ATs), stratified by school population 
and geographic region. The original 
sample included 9 sports.
Beginning in 2008/2009, High 
School RIO expanded the list of 
sports for which data were collected 
to eventually add 13 sports, 
including cheerleading. Nationally 
representative samples could not 
be recruited for each additional 
sport due to geographic variability 
in popularity of some sports, so they 
are characterized as a convenience 
sample. Cheerleading injury data 
have been collected annually since 
2009/2010. This study analyzed High 
School RIO cheerleading data from 
2009/2010 through 2013/2014, with 
an average of 107 schools reporting 
cheerleading data annually during 
the study period (range: 70–147).
Defi
 nitions
An athletic exposure (AE) was 
defined as 1 athlete participating 
in 1 practice, competition, or 
performance. The performance 
exposure category was collected only 
for cheerleading and is differentiated 
from competition by whether the 
team is cheering at halftime or on 
the sidelines in support of another 
sports’ event (performance) or 
participating themselves in a judged 
competition when a school coach or 
other school-sanctioned supervisor 
is present (competition). High School 
RIO only captures data on school-
sanctioned cheerleading squads, thus 
cheerleading teams from private 
gyms, clubs, etc, are not included.
Injuries reported to High School RIO:
1. Occurred during an organized 
high school practice, competition, 
or performance, and
2. Required medical attention by an 
AT or physician, and
3. Resulted in restriction of the 
athlete’s participation for at least 
1 day beyond the injury date 
(with the exception of fractures, 
concussions, heat illness/injuries, 
or dental injuries, which are 
reported regardless of time loss).
Injury diagnosis is based on the 
expert opinion of the ATs, with no 
study-specific diagnostic criteria 
given for any type of injury.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were completed 
by using SAS software, version 
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Cheerleading was categorized as 
a coed sport in High School RIO; 
therefore, ATs were asked to provide 
exposure data stratified by gender as 
well as exposure type so that injury 
rates could be calculated by gender. 
Injury rates were calculated by using 
2009/2010 through 2013/2014 data, 
and were calculated as the ratio of 
reportable injuries per 1000 AEs.
Rate ratios (RRs) and injury 
proportion ratios (IPRs) were 
calculated as follows:
(#of cheerleadinginjuries/
#of cheerleadingAEs)
RR =
(#of footballinjuries/
#of footballAEs)
IPR =
(#of practiceconcussions/
#of allpracticeinjuries)
(#of performanceconcussion/
#of allperformanceinjuries)
RRs and IPRs with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) not including 1.0 were 
considered statistically significant. 
Trends over time were calculated 
by using simple linear regression. 
Kruskal–Wallis tests were used 
to compare return to play time 
across cheerleading exposure types. 
Statistical significance was set at α = 
0.05.

RESULTS
Injury Rates and Comparisons 
Across Sports
A total of 793 injuries were reported 
in 1 109 489 cheerleading exposures. 
Overall, cheerleading ranked 18th 
out of 22 sports, with an overall 
injury rate of 0.71 per 1000 AEs 
(Table 1). Cheerleading was ranked 
19th in competition injury rates 
(0.85 per 1000 AEs), and 15th in 
practice injury rates (0.76 per 1000 
AEs). The performance injury rate 
(0.49 per 1000 AEs) is reported 
only for cheerleading, preventing 
comparisons with other sports. 
Cheerleading’s overall injury rate 
was significantly lower than that of 
all other sports combined (RR: 0.37, 
95% CI: 0.35–0.40) and all other 
girls’ sports combined (RR: 0.49, 95% 
CI: 0.46–0.53).
Cheerleading injury rates (Fig 1) 
have remained relatively constant 
over time overall (P = .13), in 
competition (P = .15), practice (P 
= .11), and performance (P = .40). 
No significant difference between 
competition (0.85 per 1000 AEs) 
and practice (0.76) injury rates (RR: 
1.12, 95% CI: 0.87–1.45) existed; 
however, performance injury rates 
(0.49) were lower than both practice 
(RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.52–0.79) and 
competition (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 
0.42–0.78).
General Cheerleading Injury 
Characteristics
Overall
Girls (96.8%) represented 
most injuries, with only 3.2% of 
injured athletes being boys. Most 
cheerleading-related injuries were 
new (90.5%) and occurred during 
practice (78.8%). Overall, the most 
commonly injured body sites were 
the head/face (38.5%), ankle (11.7%), 
hand/wrist (9.3%), and trunk (7.7%) 
(Table 2). Concussions were the most 
common injury diagnosis (31.1%), 
followed by ligament sprains (20.2%), 
muscle strains (14.2%), and fractures 
(10.3%).
Comparison by Gender
A total of 752 female cheerleading 
injuries occurred in 1 090 705 AEs for

a female injury rate of 0.69 per 1000 
AEs, whereas 25 male cheerleading 
injuries occurred in 18 784 AEs for 
a male injury rate of 1.33 per 1000 
AEs. The injury rate was significantly 
higher among boys than girls (RR: 
1.93, 95% CI: 1.30–2.88). Gender of 
injured athlete was missing for 2.0% 
of injuries.
The most common injury diagnoses 
for female athletes were concussions 
(31.6%), followed by ligament 
sprains (19.9%) and muscle 
strains (14.6%). For boys the most 
common injury diagnoses were 
ligament sprains (32.0%) followed 
by concussions (16.0%). The most 
commonly injured body parts among 
both genders were head/face (39.0% 
and 24.0%, respectively) and ankle 
(11.7% and 16.0%).
Comparison by Exposure Type
Concussions represented 33.1% 
of practice injuries, 27.7% of 
competition injuries, and 20.6% of 
all performance injuries, whereas 
ligament sprains represented 
24.6% of competition, 22.6% of 
performance, and 19.3% of practice 
injuries (Table 2). A significantly 
higher proportion of practice injuries 
were concussions compared with 
performance injuries (IPR: 1.61, 95% 
CI: 1.08–2.39). Head/face injuries 
were most common in practice 
(41.0% of all practice injuries), 
followed by competition (30.8%) 
and performance (28.4%), whereas 
knee injuries were less common in 
practice (6.2%) than performances 
(11.8%) or competitions (10.8%). 
Ankle injuries were the second most 
commonly injured body part in all 
exposure types, representing 11.4% 
of practice, 16.9% of competition, 
and 10.8% of performance injuries.
Concussions
The most commonly reported 
concussion symptoms were headache 
(96.7%), dizziness/unsteadiness 
(78.4%), and concentration difficulty 
(53.9%). Amnesia (12.2%) and 
loss of consciousness (2.5%) were 
less common. Although symptoms 
resolved in less than 1 day for 
10.6% of concussions, symptoms 
took over 6 days to resolve in 
44.2% of concussions. A majority 
of concussions resulted in time loss 
between 1 and 3 weeks (60.7%). 
Concussion rates were significantly 
lower in cheerleading (2.21 per 
10 000 AEs) than all other sports 
combined (3.78; RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 
0.51–0.66) as well as compared with 
all other girls’ sports (2.70; RR: 0.82, 
95% CI: 0.72–0.93). Despite relatively 
low overall concussion rates, practice 
concussion rates (2.51 per 10 000 
AEs) are higher in cheerleading than 
in most other sports, ranking third 
behind boys’ football (4.78) and boys’ 
wrestling (3.02).
Sport-Specifi
 c Cheerleading Injury 
Characteristics
Overall
Overall, the most common injury 
mechanisms included contact with 
another person (40.0%) and contact 
with the playing surface (36.6%) 
(Table 3). The most common 
activities leading to injury included 
stunts (53.2%), tumbling (20.5%), 
and pyramids (10.8%). Shoulder 
level stunts accounted for 14.8% 
of all stunt injuries, and extended 
above the shoulder level stunts 
account for 37.4%. Stunt injuries 
most commonly occurred during 
the dismount (32.0%). Of injuries 
occurring during dismount, 64.3% 
were dismounting to a cradle, 
whereas 35.7% were dismounting 
to the floor. Most stunt (55.8%) and 
pyramid (64.6%) injuries involved a 
triple base. Almost three-quarters of 
cheerleading injuries did not involve 
a rotation skill (73.5%), whereas 
21.6% involved a single rotation and 
4.9% involved a double rotation.
Stunts represented a large 
proportion of concussions (69.0%), 
with pyramids and tumbling 
representing an additional 15.7% 
and 9.1%, respectively. The most 
common injury mechanisms for 
concussions were contact with 
another person (58.9%) and contact 
with the playing surface (37.9%). 
Most stunt (60.2%) and pyramid 
(76.3%) related concussions 
resulted from contact with another 
person, whereas most tumbling 
(77.3%) concussions resulted from 
contact with the playing surface. 
Most athletes concussed due to 
player contact were struck by the

other athlete’s elbow (26.1%), head 
(17.6%), or foot (12.7%).
Bases accounted for 45.5% of all 
injuries, followed by flyers (36.0%) 
and spotters (9.9%). Position differed 
by gender; 65.2% of injured boys were 
bases and 13.0% were flyers, whereas 
44.7% of injured girls were bases and 
36.8% were flyers. Most base (83.5%) 
and back spotter (77.3%) concussions 
resulted from contact with another 
athlete, whereas 68.1% of flyer 
concussions resulted from contact 
with the playing surface. Most injuries 
occurred on mats (68.8%), but 11.6% 
occurred on basketball courts and 
8.4% occurred on tracks.
Comparison by Exposure Type
Many competition and performance 
injuries resulted from contact with the 
playing surface (40.0% and 43.1%, 
respectively), whereas practice-related 
injuries commonly occurred as a result 
of contact with another person (43.0%; 
Table 3). The proportion of noncontact 
injuries was significantly higher in 
performance (19.6%) than practice 
(12.1%; IPR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.03–2.53). 
Although stunt and pyramid injuries 
were more common in practice 
(57.1% and 11.8%, respectively) 
than performance (42.4% and 6.1%, 
respectively) or competition (31.8% 
and 9.5%, respectively), tumbling and 
jumping injuries were more common 
in both competition (34.9% and 11.1%, 
respectively) and performance (26.3% 
and 13.3%, respectively) than practice 
(18.1% and 6.4%, respectively).
Injury Severity
Overall
Of all cheerleading-related injuries, 
34.3% resulted in return to play 
in <1 week, 40.7% in 1 to 3 weeks, 
11.1% in 3 weeks or more, and 5.1% 
in medical disqualification (MDQ) 
for the season (97.4% of MDQs) 
or career (2.6% of MDQs). The 
most common injuries resulting in 
time loss of 3 weeks or more were 
concussions (35.4%), fractures 
(30.5%), and ligament sprains 
(15.9%). MDQs occurred most 
frequently as a result of fractures 
(29.0%) and dislocations (15.8%). 
Of all cheerleading injuries, 16.2% 
resulted in time loss of either >3 
weeks or MDQ, the second highest 
proportion of all sports in High 
School RIO behind gymnastics.
Surgery was required for 4.0% of all 
cheerleading injuries, most frequently 
for fractures (38.7%) and ligament

Comparison by Exposure Type
Return to play time and need for 
surgery by exposure type are 
presented in Table 4. Time loss of 1 
to 3 weeks most commonly occurred 
for competition (40.0%) and 
practice (42.5%) injuries, whereas 
performance injuries most commonly 
resulted in time loss of <1 week 
(38.7%). No significant difference 
between exposure type and time to 
return to play (P = .24) existed.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to use data 
from a large national high school 
sports injury surveillance system 
to describe the injury epidemiology 
of high school cheerleading, and 
to directly compare injury rates 
in cheerleading to other sports. 
Although studies revealing high 
rates of catastrophic injury in 
cheerleading have understandably 
resulted in safety concerns,2,14 we 
found cheerleading has a relatively 
low injury rate compared with other 
high school sports in terms of all 
time-loss injuries (18th of 22 sports 
studied). Other researchers have 
also noted cheerleading injury rates

are low2,6 or comparable7 relative 
to other sports. Despite the low 
injury rate, our study revealed that 
cheerleading had the second highest 
proportion of injuries resulting 
in time loss of at least 3 weeks or 
MDQ of all 22 sports studied. These 
findings of low overall injury rates 
despite historically high catastrophic 
injury rates in cheerleading (65% 
of female injuries) relative to other 
sports2,16 demonstrate that although 
cheerleading is relatively safe overall, 
when injuries do occur, they may 
be more severe. Thus, prevention 
efforts should focus on activities 
placing cheerleaders at risk for 
severe injuries. Understanding the 
epidemiology of cheerleading injuries 
is the important first step toward 
that goal.
We found cheerleading injury 
rates were comparable between 
competition (0.85 per 1 000 AEs) and 
practice (0.76), whereas performance 
rates were lower (0.49). This is 
similar to reports from a previous 
study.6 However, our finding that 
practice and competition injury rates 
were similar makes cheerleading 
unusual compared with other high 
school sports where injury rates 
tend to be significantly higher in 
competition than practice.18 This may 
be due to the similarity in activities 
between practice and competition 
in cheerleading (ie, learning and 
performing stunts or maneuvers), as 
compared with sports like ice hockey 
or football, where much less player–
player contact is initiated in practice 
than in competition leading to fewer 
injuries.
Concussions represented 31.1% of all 
cheerleading injuries, which is much 
higher than reported in previous 
studies, which ranged from 4% to 
6%.6,9 Although injury definitions 
were similar between studies, 
the time periods were different. 
Our findings reflect the increased 
concussion rates seen in other high 
school sports over the study period, 
possibly due to increased awareness 
and changes in diagnostic criteria 
over the past decade.19 Although 
overall concussion rates were 
significantly lower in cheerleading 
than all other sports combined, as 
well as compared with all other girls’ 
sports, the higher rate of concussions 
in practice compared with other 
sports highlights a point for further 
study and for targeted prevention 
efforts.
We found most injuries occurred 
during stunts (53.2%), consistent 
with previous studies.6,9,10 Similar 
to Shulz et al,9 we found the most 
common injury mechanism was 
contact with another athlete (40.0%); 
however, Shields and Smith6 
reported basing/spotting was most 
common. This discrepancy may be 
explained by different mechanism 
and position definitions, as we found 
that bases were the most common 
position injured (45.5%), but basing 
was not a separate mechanism 
category. Taken together, these 
studies indicate that bases are at 
particular risk of injury from contact 
with another athlete during stunts. 
Future research should focus on 
identifying ways to better protect 
bases during stunts.
Cheerleading athletes have 
historically been marginalized 
as supportive performers, and 
only recently has the activity 
been acknowledged as a sport. As 
Mueller20 notes, the decision by the 
NFHS to request spirit (cheerleading) 
be included in High School RIO is a 
step toward better understanding 
and preventing cheerleading 
injuries. Other positive steps are 
being made to improve cheerleading 
safety. The NFHS Spirit Rules Book, 
updated annually, is a valuable 
resource for high school coaches 
because the NFHS Spirit Rules 
Committee uses epidemiologic data 
to inform evidence-based decision-
making regarding rules to make 
participation safer.21 The American 
Association of Cheerleading Coaches 
and Administrators also has a 
Cheerleading Safety Manual22 and 
offers Spirit Safety Certifications for 
coaches in collaboration with the 
NFHS.23 Future research is needed 
to determine which safety efforts 
are most effective. For example, 
although compelling arguments 
have been made that state-level 
classification of cheerleading/spirit 
as an official high school sport would 
likely reduce injuries,2,20 comparing 
rates and patterns within states pre- 
and postsports classification, and 
comparing across states with and 
without sports classification have not 
yet been done.
The limitations of this study are 
primarily associated with the High 
School RIO data set. Generalizability 
of results is partially sacrificed by 
requiring reporters to be ATs. Not all 
schools use the services of ATs, and 
injury patterns between schools with 
and without ATs may differ. However, 
utilizing ATs makes reporting more 
reliable, because all reporters have 
had similar sports medicine training. 
Whether these patterns differ and 
subsequently affect injury rates and 
patterns should be an area of future 
research with more clearly defined 
exposures. An additional limitation of 
this study is that it does not account 
for variation in activities performed 
by cheerleading squads present in 
US high schools. Because the data 
set does not stratify exposures 
based on cheerleading activity, we 
cannot say whether squads who 
are more competitive or elite have 
different injury rates than less 
competitive squads who perform 
more of a traditional support role. 
Future studies of cheerleading injury 
stratifying exposure by cheerleading 
activity could provide further insight 
into the relative safety of specific 
types of cheerleading. Despite these 
limitations, this study is important 
because it provides the first direct 
comparison of injury rates between

CONCLUSIONS
As high school cheerleading 
participation and athleticism 
continue to increase,1,3 data relating 
to injury patterns can provide 
insight into improving cheerleading 
safety. Associations governing 
cheerleading have recognized the 
need to be proactive in driving 
evidence-based changes relating 
to the safety of cheerleaders. 
This in-depth look at high school 
cheerleading injury epidemiology 
provides further evidence that can 
be used to inform policymakers, 
parents, coaches, ATs, and 
athletes regarding injury risks and 
potential intervention strategies. 
Although cheerleading injury 
research has increased in recent 
years, cheerleading remains less 
well studied than other sports.6,8 
Additional research on the effect of 
state-level sport categorization on 
injury patterns may assist future 
evidence-based prevention efforts.
