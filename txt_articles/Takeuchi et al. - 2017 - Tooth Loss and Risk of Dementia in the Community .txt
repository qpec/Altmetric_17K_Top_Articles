OBJECTIVES: To clarify the effect of tooth loss on devel-
opment of all-cause dementia and its subtypes in an elderly
Japanese population.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: The Hisayama Study, Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling
Japanese
adults
without dementia aged 60 and older (N = 1,566) were fol-
lowed for 5 years (2007–2012).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants were classified into four
categories according to baseline number of remaining teeth
(≥20, 10–19, 1–9, 0). The risk estimates of the effect of
tooth loss on the development of all-cause dementia,
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD)
were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 180 (11.5%) subjects devel-
oped all-cause dementia; 127 (8.1%) had AD, and 42
(2.7%)
had
VaD.
After
adjusting
for
potential
con-
founders, there was a tendency for the multivariable-
adjusted hazard ratio of all-cause dementia to increase
with
decrease
in
number
of
remaining
teeth
(P
for
trend = .04). The risk of all-cause dementia was 1.62 times
as great in subjects with 10 to 19 teeth, 1.81 times as great
in those with one to nine teeth, and 1.63 times as great in
those with no teeth as in those with 20 teeth or more. An
inverse
association
was
observed
between
number
of
remaining teeth and risk of AD (P for trend = .08), but no
such association was observed with risk of VaD (P for
trend = .20).
CONCLUSION: Tooth loss is associated with an increased
risk of all-cause dementia and AD in the Japanese popula-
tion. J Am Geriatr Soc 65:e95–e100, 2017.

T
he increase in the incidence of dementia is a substantial
public health concern in aging societies. Approximately
46.8 million people worldwide have dementia, and the inci-
dence is 9.9 million per year.1 The number of people living
with dementia will nearly double every 20 years, but the
causes of dementia, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are
unclear, and there is a lack of treatments and health service
settings for this disorder.2,3 Therefore, intensified research
studies are needed to identify factors that have the potential
to decrease the risk of dementia and thereby decrease the
burden of this disease on health systems.
A growing number of research studies have focused
on the link between oral health and cognitive status. In
particular, many research studies have assessed the associa-
tion between number of teeth and cognitive function,4–15
but the results of observational longitudinal studies on the
effect of tooth loss on cognitive function are inconsistent.
A recent systematic review of the literature suggested that
tooth loss was associated with greater risk of cognitive
impairment and dementia,16 whereas another reported that
tooth loss was not consistently associated with those
outcomes.17 The inconsistency might be due to method-
ological deficiencies in this field, such as the lack of
representativeness of the population, definitive assessment
of cognitive function, and professional clinical oral exami-
nation. Thus, the existing evidence of a causal relation-
ship between tooth loss and development of dementia is
insufficient.
The purpose of the current study was to elucidate the
effect of tooth loss on the development of dementia and its
subtypes by targeting a general population of elderly adults

for definitive diagnosis of dementia types and data from
clinical oral examinations by dentists for evaluation of
tooth loss.
METHODS
Study Population
This study was based on data from the Hisayama Study, a
population-based prospective cohort study of cardiovascu-
lar disease and its risk factors established in 1961 in the
town of Hisayama, a suburb of the Fukuoka metropolitan
area in southern Japan.18 According to national census
data, the age, occupational distributions, and nutrient
intake of the population of Hisayama have been similar to
those of Japan as a whole during the past 50 years.19 Full
community surveys of health status and neurological con-
ditions of residents aged 40 and older have been conducted
every 1 to 2 years since 1961. In addition, comprehensive
surveys of dementia in elderly adults have been undertaken
since 1985.20
In 2007 and 2008, 1,996 residents aged 60 and older
(86.3% of the total population this age) participated in a
screening examination. After excluding 167 subjects with
dementia at the baseline examination in 2007 and 2008,
202 subjects with missing oral examination, and 61 sub-
jects with missing responses to survey questions on other
covariates used in the analysis, the remaining 1,566 sub-
jects (691 men, 875 women) were enrolled in the present
study. Written informed consent was obtained from all
subjects.
The
Kyushu
University
Institutional
Review
Board for Clinical Research approved this study.
Follow-Up Survey
Subjects were followed prospectively for 5 years (June
2007 to November 2012). Detailed information about the
follow-up survey on dementia has been provided else-
where.18 In brief, a daily monitoring system was estab-
lished in the study team and local physicians or members
of the town’s Health and Welfare Office to obtain infor-
mation on new events, including stroke, cognitive impair-
ment, and dementia.
When a participant was suspected of experiencing
new
neurological
symptoms,
including
dementia,
the
study team evaluated him or her for the presence of
dementia. This team, which consisted of stroke physicians
and psychiatrists, conducted physical and neurological
examinations, neuropsychological tests, interviews of the
family and attending physician, and a review of the clini-
cal records. Letters or telephone calls were also used to
collect
health
information
of
subjects
who
did
not
undergo examinations or had moved away. In addition,
comprehensive surveys of cognitive function, including
neuropsychological
tests
(Hasegawa
Dementia
Scale—
Revised21 and Mini-Mental State Examination22), were
conducted in 2012. When a subject died, all the available
clinical information was reviewed, the attending physician
and the family of the deceased were interviewed, and per-
mission for autopsy was obtained from the family. Dur-
ing follow-up, 108 subjects died, of whom 63 underwent
brain examination at autopsy. No subjects were lost to
follow-up.
Diagnosis of Dementia
Dementia was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised, Third
Edition,
criteria.23
Subjects
with
AD
were
identified
according to the National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.24 Vas-
cular
dementia
(VaD)
was
defined
according
to
the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-
Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l’Enseigne-
ment en Neurosciences criteria.25 Clinical information,
including neuroimaging, was used to diagnose possible or
probable dementia subtypes. Expert stroke physicians and
psychiatrists adjudicated each case of dementia. The accu-
racy of clinical diagnosis of AD and VaD were estimated
using neuropathological data, with AD diagnosed patho-
logically according to the National Institute on Aging—
Reagan
Institute
criteria,26
and
VaD
was
confirmed
according to the absence of neuropathological evidence of
other forms of dementia. Of 347 individuals with demen-
tia (including subjects with dementia at baseline) during
follow-up,
53
underwent
autopsy.
Agreement
rates
between clinical diagnosis and pathological diagnosis were
0.80 for AD and 0.68 for VaD.
Evaluation of Tooth Loss
At the baseline examination in 2007 and 2008, calibrated
dentists performed a clinical oral examination, following
the method of the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey.27 The dentists were trained, and con-
sensus discussions were held before initiation of the exami-
nation. Expert dentists evaluated and verified the reliability
of the oral examination by examining volunteers with
characteristics similar to those of the study population.
The number of remaining teeth was recorded for each sub-
ject to evaluate tooth loss. Remaining teeth were defined
as healthy, carious, or treated (including crowned, inlay,
and abutment teeth for prostheses), inclusive of completely
erupted third molars. Unerupted or congenitally missing
teeth, root tips, and extremely mobile teeth that were indi-
cated for extraction were not included as remaining teeth.
According to the established data of the extent of tooth
loss, the number of remaining teeth was grouped into four
categories (≥20, 10–19, 1–9, 0).28–34 The dentists also
evaluated denture use for each subject during the clinical
oral examination.
Measurements of Other Risk Factors
A wide range of covariates was included in the analyses as
potential confounding risk factors based on prior litera-
ture. At the baseline examination, trained interviewers
reviewed a self-administered questionnaire that covered
demographic characteristics, current occupation, medical
history and treatment, physical activity, smoking habits,
alcohol intake, tooth brushing frequency, and regular den-
tal visits. Sex and age (60–74 or ≥75) were used as

 demographic
characteristics.
Occupation
was
used
to
stratify subjects into socioeconomic strata (white-collar
workers, blue-collar workers, unemployed, homemakers,
part-time workers). White-collar workers included man-
agers, professionals, office workers, and service and sales
workers; blue-collar workers included skilled and elemen-
tary workers and agricultural, forestry, and fishery work-
ers. A low level of education was defined as less than
10 years of formal education. Blood pressure was mea-
sured three times using a standard mercury sphygmo-
manometer in the sitting position after at least 5 minutes
rest. The mean of three measurements was used for the
analysis. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure of
140/90 mmHg or greater or current use of antihyperten-
sive agents. A blood sample was collected from the antecu-
bital vein in the morning after overnight fasting, and
fasting levels of plasma glucose were determined using the
hexokinase method. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
levels were measured using latex aggregation immunoassay
(Determiner HbA1C, Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan) and
were estimated as a National Glycohemoglobin Standard-
ization Program equivalent value. Diabetes mellitus was
diagnosed as a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL
(7.0 mmol/L), 2-hour postload or postprandial plasma glu-
cose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), or current treat-
ment
with
insulin
or
oral
hypoglycemic
medication.
History of stroke was defined on the basis of all the clini-
cal data available in the Hisayama Study. Body height and
weight were measured in light clothing without shoes, and
body mass index was calculated and dichotomized as less
than 25.0 kg/m2or 25 kg/m2 or greater. Physical activity
was defined as engaging in exercise one or more times per
week during leisure time, and subjects were divided into
two groups: an active group and an inactive group.35
Smoking habits and alcohol intake were categorized as
ever or current versus never. Tooth brushing frequency
was categorized as once per day of less versus more than
one time per day. With regard to regular dental visits,
subjects were categorized as visiting the dentist for oral
care at least once every 6 months or not.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the subjects.
Linear trends in frequencies of risk factors across number
of remaining teeth categories (≥20, 10–19, 1–9, 0) were
tested using logistic regression analysis. Subjects were cen-
sored at date of death or end of follow-up for survival
analyses. Incidence rates of dementia were calculated using
the person-year method. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios
(HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were esti-
mated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The
assumption
of
the
proportional
hazards
was
checked
graphically using log cumulative hazard plots for out-
comes. In multivariable adjustment, the covariates were
selected using a backward selection method. Heterogeneity
in the association between subgroups was tested by adding
multiplicative interaction terms to the relevant Cox model.
All analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 (IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY). Two-sided P < .05 was considered
statistically significant in all the cases. The Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
guidelines for the analysis of observational data were
followed.36
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the study population according
to number of remaining teeth are shown in Table 1. The
likelihood of being aged 75 and older, a smoker, a non-
drinker; having hypertension, low education, nonregular
visits to the dentist; brushing teeth less than twice a day;
and using denture increased gradually with decrease in
number of remaining teeth. Frequency of occupation type
was significantly different across number of remaining
teeth categories.

TOOTH LOSS AND RISK OF DEMENTIA
e97
 During the median follow-up of 5.3 years (range 0.1–
5.4 years), 180 subjects (64 men, 116 women) developed
dementia (127 AD, 42 VaD); nine with AD and eight with
VaD had other coexisting subtypes of dementia, of which
eight were a mixed type of AD and VaD. These cases were
counted as events in the analysis for each subtype.
Table 2 shows the crude incidence rates and estimated
HRs and 95% CIs of dementia and its subtypes according to
number of remaining teeth. Having fewer remaining teeth
was significantly associated with greater risk of development
of all-cause dementia (P for trend < .001). This inverse
association remained significant after adjustment for all
covariates (sex, age, occupation, education, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, alcohol intake, tooth
brushing frequency, regular visits to the dentist, and denture
use; (P for trend = .04). The multivariable-adjusted hazard
of all-cause dementia was higher in subjects with 10 to 19
teeth (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.06–2.46), one to nine teeth
(HR =
1.81,
95%
CI = 1.11–2.94),
and
no
teeth
(HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.95–2.80) than in those with 20
teeth or more.
With regard to dementia subtypes, the crude incidence
of AD increased significantly with fewer remaining teeth
(P for trend < .001), but this tendency did not reach statis-
tical significance in the multivariable-adjusted analysis (P
for trend = .08). Although the multivariable-adjusted haz-
ard of VaD was significantly higher in subjects with 10 to
19 teeth (HR = 3.19, 95% CI = 1.38–7.36) than in those
with 20 teeth or more, a significant inverse association
between number of remaining teeth and multivariable-
adjusted
hazard
of
VaD
was
not
observed
(P
for
trend = .20). In addition, no evidence was found of hetero-
geneity in the associations between number of remaining
teeth and risk of dementia and its subtypes between sexes
(all P for heterogeneity > .10).
DISCUSSION
This prospective cohort study of an elderly Japanese
population demonstrated an inverse association between
number of remaining teeth and risk of development of all-
cause dementia and AD, indicating that subjects with
greater tooth loss were at greater risk of onset of demen-
tia. Tooth loss was estimated using data from clinical oral
examinations performed by dentists, and dementia sub-
types were determined on the basis of brain morphological
data (neuroimaging and neuropathology), unlike previous
studies.4–15 The present prospective cohort study investi-
gated the association between tooth loss evaluated through
a professional oral examination and risk of dementia and
its subtypes in an elderly general population. These find-
ings highlighted the clinical value of maintaining healthy
dentition throughout life to reduce the risk of dementia in
the general population.
Several prospective studies have examined the associa-
tion between tooth loss and risk of all-cause demen-
tia.6–9,12 A prospective cohort study of elderly Japanese
adults demonstrated that subjects with few remaining teeth
without dentures had a significantly higher incidence of
all-cause dementia than those with 20 teeth.6 Similarly, in
an elderly cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus, tooth loss
appeared to be significantly related to greater risk of inci-
dent all-cause dementia.8 These findings are in agreement
with those of the current study, although other cohort
studies failed to reveal a significant association.7,9,12 These
discrepancies may have arisen from differences in evalua-
tion of tooth loss (clinical oral examination vs self-report)
and control for the confounding effects of oral health
behavior (adjusted vs unadjusted).
With respect to subtypes of dementia, the present study
revealed that tooth loss is associated with the development
of AD, but not VaD. To the knowledge of the authors, no
prospective study has demonstrated a significant association
between tooth loss and risk of development of AD,4,9,12
although these studies have some limitations, including
small sample size and imprecise (self-reported) assessment
of number of remaining teeth. Meanwhile, few studies have
investigated the association between tooth loss and VaD. A
cross-sectional study reported that multiple tooth loss was
independently associated with vascular cognitive impair-
ment in individuals with acute ischemic stroke,15 whereas a
prospective cohort study of Swedish women revealed that

 tooth loss did not increase the risk of incident VaD.12
Although the present study failed to reveal a significant
association, the number of VaD events were limited. Thus,
further large-scale studies are warranted to elucidate the
association between number of teeth and development of
each dementia subtype.
Several plausible pathways may account for the rela-
tionship between tooth loss and development of dementia
in an elderly Japanese population. First, it has been sug-
gested that masticatory stimulation with normal occlusion
increases cerebral blood flow, activation of the cortical
area, and blood oxygen levels.37–39 Thus, poorer mastica-
tory performance resulting from tooth loss might nega-
tively
affect
brain
function,
which
may
result
in
development of dementia. Second, dietary changes result-
ing from tooth loss have been known to play a role in
dementia risk. It was hypothesized that the decrease in
masticatory performance due to tooth loss could lead to
poor nutritional status, which might in turn affect demen-
tia risk.28,40 Third, the influence of chronic inflammation
on development of dementia, especially in AD, is one pos-
sible pathway. Chronic systemic inflammation linked to
periodontal disease, which is a major cause of tooth loss
in adults, could contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.41,42
Finally, there is a possibility that poor oral health is a mar-
ker of overall health status, including potential risk factors
for dementia, because common oral conditions such as
tooth loss reflect history of diseases, health behavior, and
health care throughout the life course of an individual.43
The strengths of the present study are the population-
based prospective design, the perfect follow-up of the
subjects except for those who died, and the availability
of morphological examination for accurate diagnosis of
dementia subtypes, although some potential limitations of
the study should be noted. One weakness is that informa-
tion was not available regarding confounding factors dur-
ing follow-up. Lack of this information may have reduced
the accuracy of the findings to some extent. In addition,
although
some
potential
confounding
variables
were
adjusted for in the multivariable-adjusted analyses, there
may have been residual confounding at baseline because of
unmeasured factors such as depression.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that
tooth loss is a risk factor for development of all-cause
dementia and AD in an elderly Japanese population. The
findings emphasize the clinical importance of promoting
and supporting opportunities for dental care and treatment,
especially in terms of maintenance of teeth from an early
age for reducing the risk of dementia in later life.
