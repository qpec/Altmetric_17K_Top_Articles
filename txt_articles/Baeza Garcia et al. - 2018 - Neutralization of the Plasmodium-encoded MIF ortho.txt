Plasmodium species produce an ortholog of the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory
factor, PMIF, which modulates the host inflammatory response to malaria. Using a novel RNA
replicon-based vaccine, we show the impact of PMIF immunoneutralization on the host
response and observed improved control of liver and blood-stage Plasmodium infection, and
complete protection from re-infection. Vaccination against PMIF delayed blood-stage
patency after sporozoite infection, reduced the expression of the Th1-associated inflamma-
tory markers TNF-α, IL-12, and IFN-γ during blood-stage infection, augmented Tfh cell and
germinal center responses, increased anti-Plasmodium antibody titers, and enhanced the
differentiation of antigen-experienced memory CD4 T cells and liver-resident CD8 T cells.
Protection from re-infection was recapitulated by the adoptive transfer of CD8 or CD4 T cells
from PMIF RNA immunized hosts. Parasite MIF inhibition may be a useful approach to
promote immunity to Plasmodium and potentially other parasite genera that produce
MIF orthologous proteins.

n 2013, there were approximately 200 million clinical cases
and 584,000 deaths from malaria caused by parasites of the
genus Plasmodium1. Plasmodium sporozoites enter the skin
through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, transit to the
liver, and replicate over several days to produce merozoites,
which then initiate an erythrocytic cycle of infection that pro-
duces the clinical manifestations of malaria2. Immunologically
naïve hosts are at the highest risk of lethal malaria but survivors
may develop partial immunity and tolerance to disease manifes-
tations. Such partial protection does not prevent re-infection and
declines in the absence of re-exposure to parasites2,3. One
mechanism for failure to develop sterilize immunity may be the
inability of the infected host to achieve immunologic memory and
maintain an effective anti-parasite immune response4,5.
The cellular processes responsible for ineffective immunity to
malaria are unclear, although studies support an impaired
development of the adaptive response with poor establishment of
germinal centers (GC) and a disruption of their architecture in
the spleen6–8. Effective GC formation requires CD4 T follicular
helper (Tfh) cells, which may be downregulated by an unresolved
pro-inflammatory response and the expression of TNF-α, IL-12,
IFN-γ, and T-bet9,10. How Plasmodium infection negatively
impacts GCs is not understood, although parasite factors are
likely to play a central role2,4.
Many parasitic pathogens, including all studied Plasmodium
species, express an ortholog of the mammalian cytokine macro-
phage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)11,12. In studies of the
erythrocytic stage of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) malaria,
Plasmodium MIF (PMIF) was observed to be secreted into
infected erythrocytes and released upon schizont rupture13. PMIF
elicits a MIF receptor-dependent inflammatory response that
interferes with the differentiation of Plasmodium-specific CD4 T
effector cells into long-lived memory precursors by increasing the
expression of TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ, and T-bet14. The role of
PMIF also has been examined in the Plasmodium liver-stage of
infection. Genetically-targeted Plasmodium strains that lack
PMIF do not show defects in virulence or in life cycle, however
infection with PMIF-deficient Plasmodium yoelii may be asso-
ciated with retardation of parasite growth in liver and a delay in
blood-stage patency15.
Given the potential role of PMIF in modulating the immune
response and in liver-stage parasite development, we investigated
herein the impact of genetic deletion or immunoneutralization of
PMIF in the PbA experimental model of severe malaria. BALB/c
mice infected with PbAmif− blood-stage parasites showed a
robust induction of antibody-secreting plasma cells and improved
differentiation of germinal Tfh cells when compared to wild type
parasites. PMIF immunization in turn recapitulated the pheno-
type observed with the PbAmif− parasites, with improved
development of CD4 T effector cells into long-lived memory
precursors and enhanced
differentiation of Tfh cells and
antibody-secreting
B
cells.
PMIF-immunized
mice
showed
improved control of liver-stage infection that was associated with
an increase in the number Plasmodium-specific liver-resident
memory CD8 T cells. PMIF immunization also enhanced host
control of the first infection and conferred complete protection to
re-infection.
Results
PMIF impairs germinal center formation during malaria.
Human and experimental mouse studies suggest that strong pro-
inflammatory responses generated during blood-stage infection
can inhibit productive GC and Tfh cell responses7,8, and recent
data suggest a role for PMIF in the suppression of CD4 T cell
differentiation14. To assess whether PMIF pro-inflammatory
activity affects the GC responses, we infected BALB/cJ mice
with PbAWT or PbAmif− parasites. Infection with both strains
results in equivalent parasitemia and splenic parasite burden, and
comparable levels of circulating host MIF14. The frequency and
total numbers of GC B cells (CD19+CD38loGL7+) in the spleens
of PbAmif− infected mice was significantly increased when
compared to PbAWT-infected mice (Fig. 1a and Supplementary
Figure 1a). The frequency and number of memory B cells
(CD19+IgD−CD138−CD38hi) also was significantly lower in the
PbAWT-infected mice than in the mice infected with PbAmif−
parasites (Fig. 1b), and this was associated with a 5-fold increase
in the parasite-specific antibody response (Fig. 1c). Immunohis-
tochemical staining at 15 days after infection of spleen sections
from PbAWT mice showed a significant loss of the T cell zone
and a disorganized follicular architecture when compared with
PbAmif− infected mice. Taken together, these data suggest that
PMIF impairs GC reactions and antibody responses during
experimental malaria infection.
PMIF decreases Tfh cell responses during malaria infection.
Tfh cells are essential for the formation and maintenance of
GCs and enable proper B cell development into antibody-
producing plasma cells and memory B cells16. We investigated
if the impairment in GC formation associated with PMIF
was
a
consequence
of
defective
Tfh
differentiation.
We
examined the frequency and number of activated Tfh cells
(CD4+CD62L−CXCR5hiPD-1hi) in the spleens of mice at days 6
and 15 after infection with PbAWT or PbAmif− parasites. Mice
infected with PbAmif− parasites showed a significant increase in
the number of Tfh activated cells at day 6 when compared to
PbAWT-infected mice (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Figure 2a).
This difference was maintained at day 15 of infection, and
without a change in the number of measured Tfh cells in the
PbAWT-infected mice. We also investigated if the difference in
the number of Tfh cells between the two groups was due to a
defect in their maturation7, despite a similar percentage of pre-
Tfh cells in mice infected with PbAWT or PbAmif−. The number
of
pre-Tfh
cells
(CD4+CD62L−CXCR5intPD-1int)
was
sig-
nificantly elevated after 6 days of infection with PbAWT (Fig. 2c).
We measured the expression of the transcription factor Bcl-6, a
regulator of Tfh cell differentiation17. Bcl-6 expression was higher
in the PbAmif- infected mice, suggesting a defect in the
maturation of these cells in the presence of PMIF (Fig. 2d).
In the setting of malaria infection, the balance between Th1
and Tfh responses is determined by the expression of T-bet and
Bcl-6. Excessive expression of T-bet represses Bcl-6 expression
and interferes with Tfh cell expansion and GC formation7,9. In
the presence of PMIF, there is an evidence of increased
expression of the transcription factor T-bet by Plasmodium-
responsive CD4 T cells as a consequence of elevated host
production of IL-12 and IFN-γ14. We investigated the effect of
PMIF in driving Tfh responses toward Th1 development by
measuring T-bet expression in the Tfh lineage cells. T-bet was
significantly higher in the CD4+CD62L−Bcl6hi splenic cells of
mice infected with PbAWT than PbAmif− parasites (Fig. 2e).
In accordance with this increase in T-bet expression, there also
was an elevation in the expression number of both pre-Tfh and
Tfh cells in mice infected with PbAWT when compared to
those infected with PbAmif− (Supplementary Figure 2b, c).
Finally, Tfh cells from PbAWT-infected mice expressed higher
levels of the cytokine IFN-γ (Supplementary Figure 2d). These
data suggest that a Th1 pro-inflammatory response driven by
PMIF during acute infection has a detrimental effect on the
development of responsive Tfh cells, leading to inadequate
GC formation.

 PMIF influences PbA development in liver. Blood-stage infec-
tion with PbAmif− parasites results in an augmented memory
CD4 T cell response when compared to infection with PbAWT,
although the survival of infected hosts is unchanged14. To
examine the impact of PMIF on liver-stage parasite development,
which may be impaired in the P. yoelii model15, BALB/cJ mice
were infected with 2000 freshly isolated PbAWT or PbAmif−
sporozoites and blood-stage patency assessed. All mice infected
with PbAWT sporozoites developed patent infection at 3 days; by
contrast, fewer than 10% of mice infected with PbAmif− parasites
showed blood-stage patency at 5 days and 25% of mice remained
free of parasitemia at 21 days (Supplementary Figure 3a). The
livers and spleens of mice infected with PbAWT or PbAmif−
sporozoites were harvested 7 days after infection and the
CSP (Circumsporozoite protein) epitope-specific CD8 T cell
responses assessed by flow cytometry. CSP-specific CD8 T cells
(CD8+CD11ahiTetrCSPhi) were identified in both groups of mice
but increased numbers were evident in the livers of mice
infected with PbAmif− (Supplementary Figure 3b). The pheno-
type of CSP-specific CD8 T cells was further characterized by
the
expression
of
CD44,
CD69,
and
KLGR1
to
better
differentiate between the main subsets of CSP-specific cells. We
found two distinct populations of CD8 T cells in the livers of
PbAWT and PbAmif− mice: resident memory cells (Trm:
CD44hiKLGR1−CD69+)
and
effector
memory
cells
(Tem:
CD44hiKLGR1hiCD69−), which are two populations described
recently to persist long term and to be essential for protection
against re-infection11. Consistent with the CSP-specific cell
results, the number of liver Trm and Tem cells was significantly
lower in the PbAWT than the PbAmif− infected mice (Supple-
mentary Figure 3c), with Trm cells representing ~64% of the to-
tal
intrahepatic
CSP-specific
cells.
These
data
support
the notion that PMIF deficiency impairs liver-stage parasite
development, as previously suggested15, and this impairment
is associated with an augmentation in the liver-resident CD8 T
cell response.

 An RNA replicon encoding PMIF elicits humoral and cellular
immunity. The present and previous14 observations suggest
immunoregulatory actions for PMIF in the development of anti-
Plasmodium CD4 central memory T cells, GC Tfh responses, and
B cell maturation. We hypothesized that inhibition of PMIF
activity could improve host immunity against Plasmodium
infection and potentially confer protection against re-infection.
For immunization of naïve mice, we subcloned pmif into a self-
amplifying mRNA “replicon”, which is an antigen delivery
methodology that elicits cellular and humoral responses without
generating a limiting anti-vector response18,19. We studied the
impact of pmif or control RNA immunization on liver- and
blood-stage PbAWT infection in BALB/cJ mice, which under
normal circumstances results in a progressive parasitemia and
death from anemia at 2–3 weeks. If cured by chloroquine treat-
ment, the initially infected mice remain susceptible to the second
infection and develop a patent parasitemia that persists for at least
10 days20,21.
We assessed the immunogenicity of PMIF in mice given two
sequential pmif RNA replicon immunizations followed by
challenge infection with PbAWT-infected red blood cells (iRBCs)
(Supplementary Figure 4a). Single immunization resulted in a
primary anti-PMIF antibody response that increased in titer by 4-
fold after the second immunization (Supplementary Figure 4a).
Anti-PMIF antibody development was associated with the
elicitation
of
PMIF
specific
CD4
T
cells
(Supplementary
Figure 4c), and the elicited anti-PMIF IgG neutralized the
stimulatory action of PbAWT iRBCs or recombinant PMIF on
inflammatory cytokine production by bone marrow-derived
macrophages (Supplementary Figure 4d, e). As host MIF
deficiency may alter the course of Plasmodium infection22, we
also tested the specificity of the antibody response in the PMIF-
immunized mice and found that anti-PMIF IgG from immune
serum neutralized PMIF upregulation of host TLR4 expression
but failed to detect mouse MIF (Supplementary Figure 4f–h). To
exclude a potential contribution for elicited anti-PMIF in the
clearance of free parasites after schizont release, we also
confirmed that PMIF is expressed only in the cytosolic fraction
and not on membranes (Supplementary Figure 4i). As a
specificity control, we studied the impact of anti-PMIF IgG in
mice
infected
with
PbAmif−
iRBCs,
which
show
similar
parasitemia and lethality in this model as mice infected with
PbAWT14. Anti-PMIF IgG administration to mice infected with
PbAmif− did not influence parasitemia, and disease course
resembled that of PbAWT-infected mice treated with a non-
immune (Con) IgG (Supplementary Figure 4j). These results
demonstrate that pmif RNA replicon immunization elicits both a
cellular and humoral immune response against PMIF, and that
anti-PMIF IgG blocks the pro-inflammatory action of PMIF
without inhibiting the action of host MIF.
An RNA replicon encoding PMIF confers protection to re-
infection. Mice immunized with pmif or control RNA replicons
were injected with 106 PbAWT-infected iRBCs and the progress
of infection followed over time. There was a more rapid increase
in parasitemia after day 5 in the control group, which became
moribund on day 21 (Fig. 3a, b). By contrast, the pmif RNA
replicon immunized mice showed better control of parasitemia
during the first 15 days of infection and a 37% prolongation in

 mean survival time. To test for the development of a protective
memory response, a cohort of pmif RNA replicon immunized and
PbAWT-infected mice was cured by treatment with chloroquine
and re-infected 4 weeks later (see scheme Supplementary Fig-
ure 4a). Mice that received the control RNA replicon developed a
rapidly increasing parasitemia that was resolved at day 30. By
contrast, patent parasitemia did not develop in the pmif RNA
replicon immunized mice, nor were parasites detected in organs
(Fig. 3c, d). Challenge infection was associated with a further
increase in anti-PMIF titer, indicating that PMIF immunization
produces a humoral response that persists after blood-stage
infection and is rapidly activated after the second challenge (see
Supplementary Figure 4b, third titer).
We studied the effect of PMIF on pre-erythrocytic stage
Plasmodium by immunizing mice with pmif or control RNA
replicons followed by i.v. injection of 2000 PbA expressing
luciferase (PbAluc) sporozoites. There was a 65% decrease
in the liver burden in the pmif RNA immunized mice at 48 h
after infection (Fig. 3e). While both groups of mice developed
blood-stage
infection,
the
control
mice
showed
a
rapid
increase in parasitemia and became moribund on day 19 after
infection. The parasitemia in the pmif RNA immunized
mice, by contrast, never exceeded 2% and was eliminated in
all mice at day 25 (Fig. 3f). Cohorts of pmif or control RNA
replicon immunized mice also were cured of blood-stage
infection by treatment with chloroquine and re-infected 4 weeks
later
with
PbAluc
sporozoites.
While
both
groups
of
mice showed a reduction parasite liver burden relative to
the first infection (Fig. 3e), the pmif RNA immunized mice
showed a 70% reduction in liver parasites when compared with
the control mice and did not develop blood-stage infection
(Fig. 3g, h).
These data support the conclusion that PMIF blockade by
vaccination enhances the control of first infection and prevents

 re-infection. Notably, protection was more pronounced in mice
infected with PbA sporozoites as these mice cleared blood-stage
parasites after challenge infection and failed to develop detectable
blood-stage infection after re-infection.
A PMIF vaccine enhances liver-resident memory CD8 T cells.
As infection with PbAmif− sporozoites is associated with an
increased number of liver-resident memory CD8 T cells (Trm)
(Supplementary Figure 3), we examined if immunization with
pmif RNA also leads to enhanced Trm numbers after sporozoite
infection. We hypothesized that vaccination with PMIF could
have an impact in the host immunity against Plasmodium liver-
stage by increasing the number of liver-resident memory CD8
T cells. We immunized mice with pmif or control RNA replicons
followed by i.v. injection of 2000 PbA sporozoites 1 month later
and characterized the phenotype of liver CD8 T cells 7 days after
infection. There was a 48% increase in the number of CSP-
specific CD8 T cells in the liver (Fig. 4a) but not the spleen
(Supplementary Figure 5a) in the pmif RNA versus the control
RNA immunized group, and examination of CD8 T cell subsets
revealed a corresponding increase in CSP-specific Trm cells
(Fig. 4b). Liver CD8 Trm cells directed against Plasmodium are
long-lived23. To examine their development and response to a
second infection, we cured immunized mice that had primary
blood-stage infection by chloroquine treatment and examined
CD8 Trm cell frequency 1 month later, both before and after re-
infection with PbAWT sporozoites. While the number of liver
CD8 Trm cells decreased after 1 month in both the pmif and the
control RNA immunized groups, there was a more than 3-fold
increase in the pmif RNA immunized mice when compared with
the control group (Supplementary Figure 5b). Seven days after re-
infection with sporozoites, there was an expansion of this liver
CD8 Trm population, with a 60% increase in CSP-specific CD8
Trm cells in the pmif RNA immunized cohort when second
infection is compared to the number of Trm 1 month after the
first infection (Fig. 4c). Moreover, there was an increase in the
number of IFNγ-expressing CD8 Trm cells after the second

 infection in the pmif versus control RNA group when tested by
ex vivo stimulation with sporozoites lysates (Supplementary
Figure 5c). Taken together, these findings indicate that pmif RNA
vaccination promotes a liver CD8 Trm cell response that func-
tionally expands after re-infection.
PMIF neutralization increases the memory CD4 T cell
response. Infection with blood-stage PbAmif− parasites, when
compared to PbAWT parasites, is associated with lower circu-
lating levels of IFN-γ and increased numbers of Plasmodium-
responsive CD4 T cells that develop into memory precursor CD4
T cells14. We observed a 48% lower serum concentration of IL-12
in mice infected with PbAWT iRBCs that were immunized with
pmif versus control RNA, as well as a 30% and 45% reduction
respectively, in circulating IFN-γ and TNF-α levels (Fig. 5a).
Serum concentrations of PMIF and host MIF also were measured
by specific ELISA. PMIF levels were reduced by 89% in infected
mice previously immunized with pmif RNA and, as expected,
there was no alteration in the levels of circulating host MIF
(Fig. 5b). While there were similar numbers of Plasmodium-
responsive CD4 T cells in both groups of mice during acute
infection (day 7), there was a 50% reduction in the percentage of
CD4 T cells producing IFN-γ in the pmif RNA immunized group
(Fig. 5c), which is consistent with reduced development of an
initial inflammatory CD4 T effector population in the setting of
PMIF neutralization or genetic absence. This difference in IFN-γ
producing CD4 T cell population disappeared by day 10, and with
resolution of infection (day 15) there was a comparative increase
in the Plasmodium-responsive, IFN-γ expressing memory CD4 T
cell population in the pmif RNA immunized group. These data
suggest a time-dependent development and preservation of a

 memory CD4 T cell response during blood-stage infection after
pmif RNA immunization.
Plasmodium infection is associated with a down-regulation of
the T cell survival receptor IL7Rα and an upregulation of T-bet,
which are markers of the terminal differentiation of effector CD4
T cells14,24. Using the markers CD62L and IL7Rα to assess the
phenotype of Plasmodium-responsive memory CD4 T cells, we
observed at 7 days a 90% increase in CD4 T effector memory cells
(Tem: CD62L−IL7Rα+), an 80% increase in CD4 T memory cells
(Tmem: CD62L+IL7Rα+) (Fig. 5d, e), as well as a 20% reduction
in the number of CD4 T cells expressing the exhaustion marker
PD-1 in the pmif RNA versus control RNA immunized mice
(Supplementary Figure 6). This observed phenotype of Plasmo-
dium-responsive effector memory and memory CD4 T cells was
further evidenced by measurements at 15 days of infection
(Fig. 5e). Taken together, these findings support the relative
preservation of a memory CD4 T cell response by PMIF
neutralization during blood-stage Plasmodium infection.
We next examined the impact of re-infection in a cohort of
pmif RNA immunized mice that were cured of primary blood-
stage
PbAWT
infection
by
chloroquine
treatment.
Lower
circulating concentrations of IFN-γ were noted after challenge
infection in the pmif RNA immunized group when compared to
controls, and this was associated with a 94% reduction in serum
PMIF (Supplementary Figure 7a). There also was evidence of
preservation and expansion of the CD4 T effector memory and
memory cell population by 100%. (Supplementary Figure 7b).
After re-infection, the number of Plasmodium-responsive CD4
T cells was similar in both groups but there were 40% fewer
Plasmodium-responsive CD4 T cells producing IFN-γ in the pmif
RNA immunized mice than in the control group (Supplementary
Figure 7c). Moreover, there was a> 25% decrease in the
proportion of memory CD4 T cells expressing PD-1, suggesting
that the neutralization of PMIF during blood-stage infection
reduces
memory

exhaustion
(Supplementary
Figure 7d).
PMIF neutralization promotes anti-PbA cellular and humoral
immunity. Immunohistochemical staining of spleens 15 days
after blood-stage infection with PbAWT revealed an expanded
and less disorganized B cell relative to T cell zone in the pmif
RNA versus control RNA immunized mice (Supplementary Fig-
ure 8a, b). We examined the development of Tfh cells and GC B
cells
in
spleens,

by
enumerating
Tfh
cells
(CD4+CD62L−CXR5hiPD-1hi)7,25 in mice infected with PbAWT
parasites that had been immunized previously. There was a 2.5-
fold increase in the number of CD4 Tfh cells when compared to
infected mice immunized with a control RNA replicon. The
number of pre-Tfh cells also was higher in the controls than in
the pmif RNA immunized mice (Fig. 6a, b), supporting a
maturation defect in Tfh cells in the control group. Consistent
with this observation, we measured the expression of the Tfh
differentiation regulator Bcl-6 and confirmed that its expression
was significantly higher in the Tfh cells from the pmif RNA versus
the control RNA immunized mice (Fig. 6a, c)17. Consistent with
this observation, we found a significant increase in the number
of GC B cells (CD19+CD38loGL7+) and memory B cells
(CD138−CD19+IgD−CD38hi) during the first infection, and the
difference was maintained after the second infection in pmif RNA
immunized mice when compared with the controls (Fig. 6d, e).
That pmif RNA immunization is associated with an improvement
in the host Tfh and B cell responses was confirmed by serum
antibody titers against Plasmodium blood- and liver-stage (CSP)
antigens, and a 6-8-fold higher titer of total IgG, was observed
against blood-stage and liver-stage antigen, respectively, in the
pmif RNA versus control RNA immunized groups (Fig. 6f, g).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that immunoneu-
tralization of PMIF reduces its detrimental effect on the devel-
opment
of
Plasmodium-responsive
Tfh
cells,
restores
GC
formation, and promotes a more effective cellular and humoral
response against pre- and erythrocytic Plasmodium infection.
PMIF vaccination elicits malaria-protective CD4 T cells. The
observation that immunoneutralization of PMIF promotes the
differentiation and maintenance of a memory CD4 T cell
response, improves anti-Plasmodium antibody responses, and
prevents re-infection to blood-stage malaria prompted us to
examine more closely the contribution of the adaptive and
humoral responses to protective immunity. We assessed the
functional significance of an augmented CD4 T cell response by
adoptive transfer into naïve recipients of splenic CD4 T cells
isolated from PbAWT-infected mice that had been immunized
against pmif or control RNA. For this protocol, mice were
sacrificed 7 days after the second infection and 2 × 107 splenic
CD4 T cells (CD45.2) were CFSE-labeled and transferred into
congenic CD45.1 BALB/cJ mice. The recipient mice then were
infected with blood-stage PbAWT 3 days after adoptive cell
transfer (Fig. 7a). Infection was established in recipient mice that
received CD4 T cells from the control group, as evidenced by
increasing parasitemia and organ parasite content, but not in
mice that received CD4 T cells from the pmif RNA immunized
donors (Fig. 7b). The phenotype of the transferred CD4 T cells
also was characterized in mice euthanized at day 7 after infection.
The protection conferred by the adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells
from the pmif RNA immunized donors was associated with a
higher number of proliferating CD4 T cells (CFSElo) (Fig. 7c, d),
higher levels of IFN-γ production (Fig. 7e), and reduced
expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1 when compared to
CD4 T cells adoptively transferred from the control group
(Fig. 7f). These data indicate that the augmented CD4 T cell
response that develops after pmif RNA immunization in infected
mice is sufficient to prevent the establishment of blood-stage
infection.
PMIF vaccination promotes a protective CD8 T cell response
against sporozoite infection. Immunization with pmif RNA
partially protects mice from sporozoite challenge and protects
completely from re-infection when the initially infected mice are
cured by chloroquine treatment (Fig. 3e–h). As this protection is
associated with an expansion of liver CSP-specific CD8 T cells
(Fig. 6), we adoptively transferred 2 × 107 liver CD8 T cells from
immunized CD45.2 mice after the second infection to evaluate
the functional significance of this expanded CSP-specific T cell
population. Three days after adoptive transfer, we infected reci-
pient CD45.1 Balb/cJ mice with 2000 PbAWT sporozoites and
assessed the development of infection and the CD8 T cell
response (Fig. 8a). Hepatic parasite content was significantly
reduced at 48 h in mice that received liver CD8 T cells from the
pmif RNA versus the control RNA replicon immunized hosts
(Fig. 8b). Blood patency was established in recipient mice that
received liver CD8 T cells from the control RNA immunized
hosts but not in mice that received CD8 T cells from the pmif
RNA immunized hosts (Fig. 8c). We euthanized the mice 7 days
after infection to assess the phenotype of the transferred CD8+
T cells. The protection conferred by the adoptive transfer of liver
CD8 T cells from the pmif RNA immunized hosts was associated
with a higher number of proliferating CSP-specific CD8 T cells
(CFSElo) producing IFNγ (Fig. 8d, e). These data indicate that the
augmented liver CD8 T cell response that develops in infected

establishment of infection by Plasmodium sporozoites.
Antibodies elicited by PMIF vaccination enhance malaria
control. We purified serum IgG from PbAWT-infected mice
previously immunized with RNA encoding PMIF or GFP and
tested its effect on malaria development in both the BALB/cJ and

 parasitemia, a 30% reduction in peak parasitemia, a 30% pro-
longation in survival time in BALB/c mice (Supplementary Fig-
ure 9b), and a 30% reduction in lethality in C57/BL/6J mice
(Supplementary Figure 9c). These data indicate that while
humoral IgG was not as protective as CD4 T cell transfer, which
resulted in complete protection to PbAWT infection in BALB/c
mice, antibody produced in the setting of PMIF vaccination was
more effective in ameliorating lethality than antibody from the
vaccine controls.
Discussion
Immunity to malaria is slow to develop and the tolerance that
may develop to clinical disease requires repeated infection over
many years. The cellular and humoral mechanisms responsible
for the failure by the host to develop sterile immunity are not well
understood but have been considered to be features of an
immunosuppressive response. Several lines of evidence indicate
that acute malaria can inhibit T cell development with significant
impact on GC development and activity5,26–29, and recent
studies have identified that many of the same inflammatory fac-
tors that mediate severe malaria have a deleterious effect on Tfh
and B cell development7,8. Herein we provide evidence for a
mechanism by which Plasmodium parasites negatively regulate
the adaptive response via the expression of PMIF. PMIF upre-
gulates IL-12 and IFN-γ expression to increase the inflammatory
environment of the CD4 T cell response and interfere with the
differentiation of Plasmodium-specific CD4 T effector cells14. The
pro-inflammatory action of PMIF during Plasmodium infection
blocks Tfh cell development, leading to a higher frequency of Tfh

 precursors expressing Th1-type molecules such as T-bet and
IFNγ, and a lower frequency of pre-Tfh cells expressing Bcl-6.
This interference in Tfh cell maturation by PMIF is associated
with a detrimental effect on the induction of GC and B cell
responses (Supplementary Figure 11).
These findings prompted us to examine if immunization
against PMIF could reduce its deleterious action during pre-
erythrocytic or erythrocytic stage infection. While initial spor-
ozoite infection produced patent infection in immunized hosts,
parasitemia was significantly attenuated. Moreover, mice that
were cured of infection but received a second sporozoite challenge
were fully protected against re-infection. This protection was
associated with enhanced development of liver CSP-specific CD8
T cells that were predominantly of the Trm phenotype. The
protective action of liver-resident CD8 T cells was confirmed by
adoptive transfer, which fully protected naïve hosts from devel-
oping detectable parasitemia after sporozoite infection. When
infection was initiated with Plasmodium blood-stage malaria,
prior immunization against PMIF reduced the expression of IL-
12 and IFN-γ, resulting in an increased number of Plasmodium-
responsive CD4 T cell memory precursor cells, and an expansion
of CD4 T cell effector memory and memory population. A dis-
organization of GC architecture has long been noted to occur in
human and experimental malaria, and is associated with an
impairment in an effective antibody response7,30,31. PMIF
immunization led to a preservation of splenic GC architecture
and B cell zonal expansion, an increase in the number of CD4 Tfh
cells and GC B cells, and a higher anti-Plasmodium antibody titer.
Adoptive transfer of the CD4 T cells that develop in PMIF-
immunized mice during Plasmodium blood-stage infection also
conferred full protection to blood-stage infection in naïve hosts.
Upon transfer, these CD4 T cells showed enhanced Plasmodium-
specific
proliferation
and
IFN-γ
production,
and
reduced
exhaustion.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate remarkable pro-
tection in a lethal murine model of malaria initiated by sporozoite
or blood-stage infection. These data also affirm the role of the
Plasmodium-encoded factor PMIF in actively interfering with the
adaptive immune response by a pro-inflammatory mechanism
involving engagement of the host MIF receptor14 to suppress the
differentiation of memory CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. We
suggest that the marked protection observed by PMIF immuni-
zation may prompt consideration of this antigen as a vaccine
candidate, either as a standalone immunogen or in combination
with other Plasmodium antigens, where it could act to ensure the
development and maintenance of adequate memory responses in
endemic settings. It is notable that closely homologous MIF
orthologs have been described in other parasitic protozoan and
helminthic species32–35. Conceivably, this family of evolutionary
conserved proteins provides a generalized mechanism by which
parasites interfere with the adaptive response to maintain per-
sistence in the mammalian host and completion of their life
cycles.

 old mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 106 PbA iRBCs and the ensuing
parasitemia assessed by enumeration of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears, flow
cytometry using a Tri-color method (TCM)36 and by qPCR for splenic PbA 18S
rRNA37. For sporozoite infection, PbAWT, PbAmif− (Leiden Malaria Group) or
PbAWT-GFP (MR4) parasites were cycled between Swiss Webster mice and
Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Salivary gland sporozoites were extracted from
infected mosquitoes on day 19 post-blood meal infection. BALB/cJ mice were
infected by tail i.v. injection of 2000 PbA sporozoites and blood patency was
monitored beginning day 3 by blood smear, flow cytometry and when infected with
PbAWT-GFP parasites, the liver burden was monitored using an IVIS imaging
system.
Adoptive transfer of splenic CD4 T cells and liver CD8 T cells. Splenocytes or
liver lymphocytes were isolated from vaccinated and infected CD45.2+ BALB/cJ
mice at day 7 after the second infection and incubated with 10 µM chloroquine for
2 h at 37 °C. Splenic CD4 T and liver CD8 T cells were purified with anti-CD4 or
anti-CD8 microbeads (CD4 (L3T4) and CD8a (Ly-2) Myltenyi Biotech) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. Purified CD4 T or CD8 T cells were labeled with 5 µM
CFSE (Life Technologies) and 2 × 107 cells transferred i.v. into recipient CD45.1+
BALB/cJ mice. Recipient mice were infected with 1 × 106 iRBCs or 2000 sporozoites
3 days after transfer and parasitemia monitored daily. At day 7 post-infection for
iRBC infection or at day 9 for sporozoites infection, mice were sacrificed and donor
CD4 or CD8 CD45.2+ T cells recovered, quantified, and proliferation assessed by
CFSE dilution.
Flow cytometry. For splenic cell profiling assessment, spleens were harvested at
the indicated days after infection, homogenized, and passed through a 70 μm
strainer to obtain single-cell suspensions. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis
buffer and splenocytes were stained using fluorophore-labeled antibodies (BD
Biosciences) directed against Ki67 as a surrogate marker of malaria-specific cells36,
CD3, CD4, IL-7Rα, CD62L, PD-1, CD45.2, and IFN-γ for memory CD4 T cells,
CXCR5, CD4, PD-1, CD62L, T-bet, Bcl6, and IFN-γ for Tfh or pre-Tfh cells, and
B220, CD19, CD138, IgM, Gl7, CD38, and IgD for the B cell lineage. For intra-
cellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated ex vivo by co-culture of naïve
CD45.1 splenocytes with iRBC lysates or recombinant PMIF14 for 5 h in the pre-
sence of 1 μg/mL Brefeldin A (BD Bioscience). To assess the development of
memory immune responses in mice infected with sporozoites, perfused livers were
harvested at the indicated days after infection, homogenized, and the lymphocytes
isolated by centrifugation at 500g for 15 min at RT using a 35% Percoll gradient;
splenocytes were isolated as described previously. Liver and spleen lymphocytes
were stained first with CSP-specific tetramers (NIH Tetramer Facility) for 20 min
at 4 °C, followed by antibodies directed against CD3, CD8, CD69, KLGR1, CD44,
CD62L, CD45.1, and IFNγ (Biolegend) refer to Supplementary Table 1 for anti-
bodies source and concentration. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were
stimulated ex vivo by co-culture of naïve CD45.1 splenocytes with sporozoite
lysates for 5 h in the presence of 1 μg/mL of Brefeldin A before labeling with the
specified antibodies from Biolegend. For each staining, the corresponding Fluor-
escence Minus One (FMO) controls38 were performed (see Supplementary Fig-
ure 10 for representative analysis). Stained cells were analyzed on an LSR II flow
cytometer (BD Bioscience) and data processed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
RNA synthesis, nanoparticle formulation, and vaccination. The synthesis of the
self-amplifying RNA (replicon) from a modified alphavirus encoding pmif or
control RNA was performed as previously described39. The control RNA com-
prised green fluorescent protein (gfp)39, or in experiments requiring luminescent
Plasmodium detection, secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (seap)40. No dif-
ferences in background host responses were noted between the two different
controls (71,74). Briefly, the codon optimized sequences were inserted into the
subgenomic reading frame of a modified DNA plasmid encoding the self-
amplifying RNA41. The plasmid was linearized by restriction enzyme digestion
immediately following the 3′-end of the self-amplifying RNA sequence. Linearized
DNA was transcribed into RNA with the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Life
Technologies). Transcripts were purified by precipitation in the presence of 2.8 M
lithium chloride, capped using the ScriptCap m7G Capping System (CellScript),
and re-precipitated with lithium chloride. A cationic nanoemulsion was prepared
and characterized for particle size, RNase protection, and endotoxin as previously
described and allowed to complex for at least 30 min before immunization42.
Female BALB/cJ mice (8–10 weeks old) were injected i.m. in hind limbs on day 0
and on day 21 with 15 μg of the pmif or control RNA expressing replicon. Blood
was collected in both groups of animals by orbital bleeding of anesthetized mice at
day 0 pre-immunization, and at day 14 and day 35 post-immunization to titer the
anti-PMIF specific antibody response.
Western blotting and anti-PMIF and anti-Plasmodium ELISA. For the detection
of anti-PMIF antibody, microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with 100 ng/mL of
recombinant PMIF or mouse MIF, incubated overnight, washed, and blocked with
assay diluent (eBioscience) for 1 h. Mouse sera were serially diluted and added to
wells for 2 h. Antibody binding to PMIF or mouse MIF14 was measured by addition
of HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies (1/1000, Southern Biotech). To
measure the titer of anti-Plasmodium-specific IgG, mouse sera were collected on
day 7 after infection and the microtiter plates were coated with 1 µg/mL of PbAWT
iRBC lysates as antigen43. Reciprocal endpoint titers were calculated as the reci-
procal of the dilution at which the O.D. was twice background observed in
uninfected mice.
For western blotting, 100 ng of recombinant PMIF or mouse MIF29 were
electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine gel (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a
PVDF membrane (Millipore). The PMIF and mouse MIF proteins were probed for
serum antibody responses by the addition of PMIF or GFP (control) immune serum
(1/1000) and detection with rabbit anti-PMIF antibodies or goat anti-mouse MIF
antibodies (1/1000, Santa Cruz Biotech.) as previously described14. The signal was
developed by ECL HRP substrate and the membrane exposed to a film (Amersham).
For the study of PMIF expression by merozoites, iRBC were lysed with saponin
lysis buffer (0.03% saponin in PBS) and merozoites pelleted by centrifugation at
1500×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Merozoites were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min
in ice44. The lysates were centrifugated at 15,000×g for 15 min (4 °C) and the
supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and pellet (membrane fraction) were separated and
mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (BioRad). Protein extracts were separated by
gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). The
membrane was probed with rabbit anti-PMIF14 (1/1000) or anti-MSP-1 IgG (1/
1000) MRA-667, MR4 ATTC, and after incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-RD800 (1/
15000, Li-Cor), the membrane was imaged with an Odyssey system (Li-Cor). All
uncropped Western Blot scans are included in Supplementary Figure 12.
To measure the titer of anti-Plasmodium-specific IgG14, sera were collected on
day 7 after infection and microtiter plates coated with 1 µg/mL of PbA iRBC lysates
or 100 μg/mL of CSP peptide as antigen43. Reciprocal endpoint titers were
calculated as the reciprocal of the dilution at which the O.D. was twice background
observed in uninfected mice.
Histology. To examine GC architecture, spleens were removed from mice and
fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich). For immunostaining, paraffin sections
where deparaffined, hydrated and treated with antigen retrieval buffer (Dako). The
sections then were permeabilized by 4 min treatment with Triton X-100 (0.1% in
PBS) and incubated for 90 min with blocking buffer (Dako) followed by an over-
night incubation with primary antibodies: rat anti-mouse B220 and hamster anti-
mouse CD3e (1/1000, BD Pharmingen). For immunohistochemistry, antibodies
were detected with AP-conjugated goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG or HRP-
conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (1/10000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
HRP was reacted with DAB (Peroxidase Substrate Kit; Vector), and alkaline
phosphatase with Fast Blue/Napthol AS-MX (Sigma-Aldrich). Levamisole (Sigma)
was used to block endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity and slides were
mounted in Crystal Mount (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were viewed
under a Nikon Microphot FXA light microscope and photographs were taken with
a Spot Insight Camera, using 10× and 40× objectives, then analyzed using Spot
Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments) and ImageJ (NIH).
Statistical analysis. All data were expressed as a mean ± SD of at least two
independent experiments. Differences in parasitemia involving repeated mea-
surements were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. Mouse survival times were
analyzed by the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. All other data were first tested for
Gaussian distribution of values using a D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. The
statistical significance of differences was assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test
for non-parametric data distribution or Student’s t-test for parametric data. All
statistical analysis was performed using Software Prism v.6.0, (GraphPad). p Values
of less than 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001 were used to indicate statistical significance.
Ethics approval. All animal procedures followed federal guidelines and were
approved by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee, approval
number 2017-10929
