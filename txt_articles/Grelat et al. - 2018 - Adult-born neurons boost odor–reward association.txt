Olfaction is an important sensory modality driving fundamental
behaviors. During odor-dependent learning, a positive value is
commonly assigned to an odorant, and multiple forms of plasticity
are involved when such odor–reward associations are formed. In
rodents, one of the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the olfac-
tory bulb consists in recruiting new neurons daily throughout life.
However, it is still unknown whether adult-born neurons might
participate in encoding odor value. Here, we demonstrate that
exposure to reward-associated odors specifically increases activity
of adult-born neurons but not preexisting neurons. Remarkably,
adult-born neuron activation during rewarded odor presentation
heightens discrimination learning and enhances the ability to up-
date the odor value during reversal association. Moreover, in some
cases, activation of this interneuron population can trigger olfac-
tory learning without sensory stimulation. Taken together, our
results show a specific involvement of adult-born neurons in facil-
itating odor–reward association during adaptive learning.

n many species, including rodents, the sense of smell is a strong
driver of animal behavior. Innate odor responses, observed in
animals without prior experience, have been extensively studied
(1–3). However, most odors do not trigger any significant behavior
in naive mice (2, 3), supporting the idea that odor responses are
mainly adaptive and learned following repetitive experiences.
Particularly, the assignment of a positive value to an odorant de-
pends on its association with a reward outcome. These odor–
reward associations are profoundly flexible processes that require
multiple forms of plasticity present in the olfactory system.
In the olfactory bulb (OB), odor information sent from sensory
neurons is received by relay neurons, mitral and tufted cells (M/
TCs), which are involved in early processing before conveying
this information to higher brain regions. Previous studies have
reported reward-associated signals following associative learning
in structures downstream of the OB, such as the piriform cortex
or the olfactory tubercles (4–7). Interestingly, associative learn-
ing has also been shown to modify the firing activity of M/TCs
(8). However, the cellular mechanisms involved in reward encod-
ing at such an early stage of sensory processing and its relevance
for odor-driven behavioral responses remain to be elucidated.
In the adult OB, the continuous production of GABAergic in-
terneurons notably contributes to the functional plasticity of the
olfactory system (9, 10). It represents an alternative mechanism of
neuronal plasticity that acts in parallel to the conventional mo-
lecular, synaptic, and connectivity ones. A small population of
periglomerular cells (PGCs) is produced by this process, but the
majority of the newborn neurons become granule cells (GCs),
which regulate the M/TC activity (10). GCs, and particularly adult-
born GCs, are in a key position to promote reward-associated
changes in OB output neurons because they exhibit unique fea-
tures. First, GCs are about 100 times more numerous than M/TCs,
and they are the converging endpoint of both widespread top-
down inputs to the OB and bottom-up olfactory inputs mediated
by M/TCs (11–13), allowing them to bind sensory inputs together
with top-down influences. Second, OB interneurons display
structural and functional plasticity of their inputs as well as their
output synapses (13–15). Third, several studies have revealed
distinct synaptic (16–19) and functional (20, 21) properties in
adult-born and preexisting neurons. Finally, adult-born GCs
are involved in various behavioral responses, such as odorant
detection (22) and discrimination (23), olfactory innate behaviors
(24–26), and fear memory (27), perceptual learning (28), short-
term (22, 29) and long-term olfactory memory (30–33), and
olfactory learning during a difficult task (32).
Given their key role in learning, we asked whether adult-born GC
activity might be involved in encoding odor value and how manip-
ulation of this signal can drive behavior. We demonstrate that adult-
born neurons contain information about learned positive value and
that activating these neurons simultaneously with rewarded stimuli
could be sufficient to guide goal-directed behaviors. Collectively, our
results show the involvement of a specific interneuron population in
odor–reward association at early stages of sensory processing.
Results
Adult-Born GCs Overreact to Rewarded Odors. We investigated the
potential involvement of adult-born GCs in odor–reward associ-
ation by using a go/no-go operant conditioning paradigm. In this
task, mice were trained to discriminate between a pair of stimuli: a
reinforced odor associated with a water reward (positive stimulus:
S+) and an unreinforced odor (negative stimulus: S−) (Fig. 1A).
We used only difficult tasks in which mice required extended
training to discriminate between the odors correctly (Fig. S1A,
Left) (32). During this associative learning, we observed a simultaneous
Significance
Odor–reward association during appetitive learning is a funda-
mental process that requires multiple forms of plasticity. In the
adult olfactory bulb, the continual production of newborn in-
terneurons contributes to the functional plasticity of the system,
placing the newcomers in a key position to participate in olfac-
tory associative learning. Here, we demonstrate that adult-born
neurons, but not preexisting ones, contain information about
learned positive value. Moreover, specific heightening of this
signal improves associative learning and odor value update and
is enough in some cases to trigger behavior even without odor
stimulus. Collectively, our findings show an important role of
this adult-born interneuron population in odor–reward associa-
tion and unveil the relevance of odor value encoding at early
stages of sensory processing.

 consolidation of a go response only for S+ (hits), and the appearance
of no-go responses for S− (correct rejections: CRs) (Fig. S1A, Right).
Moreover, as we demonstrated with our odor replacement experiment,
after learning, most of the animals had by default a no-go response to
any stimulus different from S+ (Fig. S1B). As a consequence, the S+
odor and its associated reward size (Fig. S1C) became key factors to
drive correct mouse performance, showing the relevance of rewarded
odor perception for learning.
To ascertain the contribution of adult-born and neonatal-born
GCs in encoding odor value, they were labeled with BrdU at
postnatal day (P)60 and P6, respectively; 2 mo later, a go/no-go
task was conducted followed by passive odor exposure (Fig. 1B).
P60- and P6-injected mice were divided in two subgroups, the S+
group and the S− group, according to the odorant to which the
mice were exposed at the end of the learning. For all groups,
performances were similar in terms of the learning rate (Fig. 1C,
Left) and the training blocks necessary to reach the learning
criterion (85% of correct responses) (Fig. 1C, Right).
Once the task was learned, mice were passively exposed to ei-
ther S+ or S− without reward delivery (Fig. 1D). Immediate early
gene c-Fos expression was then used as a proxy for neuronal ac-
tivity, and the density of BrdU-labeled cells expressing c-Fos
protein was counted in the GC layer (Fig. 1E, Left). To evaluate
whether S+ or S− odor exposure alters GC activation, the counted
cell densities were normalized with respect to mean densities
obtained from naive mice exposed to the same two odors but
without previous learning. To avoid odor-specific effects, we used
highly similar binary odor mixtures evoking both identical input
patterns to the OB (34) and equal GC activation and odor-source
approach (Fig. S2 A–C). We found that S+ exposure significantly
increased the density of adult-born GCs expressing c-Fos, com-
pared with S− exposure, when animals have previously associated
S+ with the reward outcome (Fig. 1E, Right). This differential
activation was mainly due to an increase in the density of adult-
born GCs activated by S+ exposure with respect to values
obtained from naive mice. Remarkably, no difference in the
density of activated neonatal-born GCs (Fig. 1E, Right) or PGCs
(Fig. S2D) was found between the S+ and S− odor-exposure
groups. In summary, our results show that adult-born GCs are
specifically prone to react to reward-associated olfactory stimuli.
Activation of Adult-Born GCs Accelerates Learning. Next, we sought to
manipulate the differential activation of adult-born GCs during
S+ and S− odor presentation to probe whether this dissimilarity
is sufficient to trigger appropriate behaviors. To do this, we used
channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to control neuronal activity exclu-
sively in neurons born either at P60 or at P6 (32). We injected a
lentiviral vector encoding ChR2-YFP into the rostral migratory
stream (RMS) of mice, resulting 10 wk later in comparable co-
horts of light-sensitive fully mature GCs (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3 A–
C). To stimulate these neurons in vivo, an LED (465 nm) was
implanted over the OB, allowing 40-Hz light stimulation during
the discrimination learning task (Fig. 2B) (32).
In a first initiation task without light stimulation, controls and
animals injected with ChR2 performed similarly (Fig. S3 D and E).
Then, a difficult task was conducted, with 40-Hz photoactivation
delivered for 500 ms during either S+ or S− presentations (S+ and
S− groups, respectively). In mice expressing ChR2, discrimination
learning was facilitated by simultaneous photoactivation of adult-
born neurons with S+ but not with S− presentations (Fig. 2C,
Left). As expected for a go/no-go task, this facilitation was re-
flected by an accelerated appearance of CRs during S− trials
(Fig. S4A). Animals required fewer training blocks to learn to
discriminate for both single and mixed odors when light was si-
multaneously provided with S+ (Fig. 2C, Right). Despite this
change in learning rate, all groups eventually reached the same
number of correct responses (last two blocks: P = 0.69, Kruskal–
Wallis test, n = 9–12). Interestingly, this differential effect was
specific to adult-born neurons, as there was no improvement in
learning during photoactivation of neonatal-born neurons (Fig.
2D and Fig. S4 B–D). P6-injected groups learned at comparable
rates and reached a similar number of correct responses (last two
blocks: P = 0.49, Kruskal–Wallis test, n = 9–19). Importantly, in
previous work we showed that ChR2+ GCs born at P60 had an
optical threshold to spike similar to those born at P6, and thus
the two groups of neurons were activated by light with a similar
regimen (18). Finally, we observed that movement and discrim-
ination times remained the same for all groups (Fig. S5). Taken
together, our data showed that activating adult-born GCs spe-
cifically during rewarded odor presentation is sufficient to alter
behavioral responses.

port triggered water delivery. This constitutes a correct response (Go, a hit),
whereas not going to lick is considered an error (No-go, a miss). In response to
S−, trained mice refrained from licking, thus constituting the correct response
(No-go, CR), whereas going to lick constitutes an error [Go, false alarm (FA)].

vated by S+ exposure (P = 0.012, Wilcoxon signed rank test vs. theoretical
mean of 1 test, #P < 0.05, n = 9). Data obtained from mice exposed to either S+

NEUROSCIENCE
 The Mere Activation of Adult-Born GCs Is Sufficient to Trigger Behaviors.
Then, we investigated if activating adult-born GCs before reward
delivery, even in the absence of an odor stimulus, was sufficient to
drive appropriate behavioral responses. To address this question,
40-Hz photostimulation without odor presentation was associated
with reward delivery for “S+” trials but not for “S−” trials (Fig. 3A,
Upper). We found that GC photoactivation was sufficient to gen-
erate a reinforceable stimulus in a subgroup of P60-injected mice
(three out of nine mice), whereas all P6-injected (n = 11) and
control (n = 14) mice performed at the 50% chance level (Fig. 3A,
Lower). This learning in the P60-injected group is again reflected
by an appearance of CRs during “S−” trials (Fig. S6A). Differences
between groups persisted if all P60-injected mice were pooled
together (Fig. S6B), but variability in this group cannot be explain
by ChR2-YFP+ cell density (Fig. S6C). P60 learners still succeeded
in learning the task even when the “S−” stimulus was ambiguously
photoactivated by a low-frequency stimulus (“S+”: 40 Hz vs. “S−”:
10 Hz). However, their performance did not differ from that of the
control group if the difference between GC activation during “S+”
and “S−” trials was too small (40 Hz vs. 25 Hz) (Fig. 3A).
In a similar experiment, 40-Hz photostimulation associated
with “S−” unrewarded trials did not drive appropriate behavioral
responses in any of the groups (controls: n = 8; P60: n = 9; P6:
n = 12) (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that activation of adult-
born GCs in association with a reward signal can drive the be-
havioral response. An alternative explanation could be that GC
activation is itself rewarding. However, GC photostimulation
without or with only a partial water reinforcement did not trigger
learning (Fig. S7). In sum, our data support the idea that adult-
born neuron activation during rewarded odor presentation and
preceding complete reward delivery might be sufficient for trig-
gering the learning process.
Adult-Born GC Activation Improves Reversal Learning. We next asked
if GC activation could differentially modify acuity in S+ or S−
trials. However, once the learning criterion was reached without
photostimulation (Fig. S8A), we observed that adult-born GC ac-
tivation did not further improve discrimination acuity of an al-
ready established odor–reward association (Fig. S8B). This result
suggests a predominant role of adult-born GCs in the early phases
of the odor–reward association. To challenge this idea, animals
were trained in a reversal version of the go/no-go task. Mice had to
reverse the values associated with an odor pair that they had

The mere activation of adult-born GCs is enough to trigger reward-
oriented behavior. (A, Upper) Experimental design of the learning task with-
out odor delivery. For “S+” trials, 40-Hz photostimulation was associated with
reward delivery. No light, 10 Hz, or 25 Hz photostimulation was used as a
stimulus for “S−” trials (unrewarded). (Lower) For the 40-Hz vs. no-light task,
some P60-injected mice associate the photostimulation with reward delivery,
whereas the other groups kept performing at chance level (50% of correct
responses; group: F3,30 = 268.9, P < 0.0001, repeated-measures two-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test; **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001 for
P60-learners vs. the other groups, n = 3–14). P60 learners succeeded in dis-
criminating between 40 Hz and 10 Hz (F1,5 = 38.55, P = 0.0016) but not be-
tween 40 Hz and 25 Hz (F1,5 = 3.90, P = 0.11). P6 and P60 control mice showed
identical performances and were pooled together (group: F1,12 = 0.38, P =
0.55, repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, n = 7). (B, Upper) Experimental

 already learned. Without light stimulation all mice reached similar
learning performances (Fig. 4A, Left). Then, the odorant previ-
ously associated with a reward was unreinforced and vice versa
(Fig. 4A, Right). As expected, during the first few blocks of the
reversal task (reset), all animals performed below the chance level,
as they kept following the previous odor–reward association.
However, the adjustment to the new odor–reward association was
facilitated by photoactivation of adult-born neurons but not of
neonatal-born neurons. This increased learning flexibility was
demonstrated by those animals requiring fewer trials before
switching to a go response to the newly rewarded odor (Fig. S9A).
Full learning of the new task was also accelerated; however, the
effect was smaller (Fig. 4B, Left). Despite this improvement in
reversal learning, all groups eventually reached the same number
of correct responses (last two blocks: P = 0.76, Kruskal–Wallis
test, n = 6–10). Similar results were found when analyzing the
number of blocks needed to reach the criterion with the new task
rules (Fig. 4B, Right). It is noteworthy that the dissociation be-
tween odor and reward outcome using an extinction protocol, in
which no reward was delivered, was not affected by GC photo-
activation (Fig. 4C and Fig. S9B). Reacquisition of the task after
extinction was fast, indicating that the odor–reward association
was still partially stored (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these results point
to the specific involvement of adult-born GC activity in the initial
positive value attribution to rewarded stimuli.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that in the OB the activity of
adult-born GCs, but not of neonatal-born GCs, contains infor-
mation about learned positive value. Concomitant stimulation of
ChR2-expressing adult-born neurons with rewarded stimulus pre-
sentation accelerates discrimination learning and improves the
odor valence update that occurs during reversal learning. More-
over, activation of this interneuron population, in the absence of
odor stimulus, is enough to trigger reward-motivated behavior in
some mice. Collectively, our study demonstrates that adult neu-
rogenesis endows the olfactory system with the capacity to enhance
odor–reward association at early stages of sensory processing.
Contribution of Adult-Born Neurons in Olfactory Behavior. It is well
established that adult-born neurons are involved in several be-
havioral processes (22–33). However, reducing adult neuro-
genesis has produced mixed results, frequently not preventing
odor learning (27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35). In general, previous studies
used approaches that were not completely selective and/or in-
duce long-term ablation of adult neurogenesis, which may recruit
homeostatic mechanisms and thereby introduce confounding
factors. Using an optogenetic approach, our recent study showed
an immediate causal relationship between adult-born neuron
activity and difficult (but not easy), odor discrimination learning
(32). These results indicate that the role of adult neurogenesis is
extremely dependent on the behavioral task, as previously dis-
cussed (36). However, how newborn neurons exactly impact the
functioning of preexisting circuits is still unclear (10, 37).
Adding further complexity to this panel of adult neurogenesis-
dependent behavioral responses, the present investigation describes
a role of adult-born neurons in odor–reward association. In our
experiments, we found that adult-born neurons activation can boost
olfactory learning but only when it occurs during rewarded odor
presentations. Interestingly, we observed that facilitated learning
produced by photostimulation during S+ presentations did not
modify the percentage of hits, but it was reflected by an accelerated
appearance of CRs during S− trials (Fig. S4). A possible expla-
nation of this apparent paradox may be the switch from pro-
grammed go to no-go responses observed in this task. During
pretraining sessions, animals learn to exhibit by default a go
response to obtain a reward. However, once odor stimuli have
been presented during the discrimination task, the mismatch
detected between S− presentation and reward outcome triggers
a consolidation of a go response only for the rewarded odor. As
a result, at criterion level, S+ became the key signal, and most
of the animals exhibited by default a no-go response for any
other stimulus, as demonstrated with our odor-replacement
experiment (Fig. S1B). We therefore hypothesize that adult-
born neurons improve learning by facilitating the association of
S+ with the reward, a process required to change the default
response. These results support the idea that adult-born GCs
mostly participate in the associative learning process per se and
not only in the ability to identify and distinguish between the
two different odorants.
Although adult neurogenesis produces both GCs and PGCs,
our present results indicate that PGCs are not involved in odor–
reward coding. As photostimulation of ChR2-positive neurons
led to selective activation of GCs (32), future experiments will be
required to elucidate the specific role of PGCs on associative
learning.
Finally, our gain-of-function approach reveals a role of adult-
born GCs in odor–reward association, but inhibition of GC activity
would be essential to investigate their necessity for this process.
An inducible genetic approach for loss-of-function analysis will be
required to target a large number of GCs. In addition, an inhibi-
tory opsin with higher conductance and a low-intensity level for
activation will be critical to reach deeper regions of the OB using
fiber optics or noninvasive illumination (38).

 Different Functions for Newly Generated and Preexisting GCs. Recent
studies demonstrated that predominant manipulation of preex-
isting GCs alters innate odor attractiveness (3), and their inacti-
vation disrupts responses to innately aversive odors (26). These
experiments therefore support the notion that preexisting GCs are
typically involved in innate responses to odors. On the other hand,
our present findings unveil the unexpected role of adult-born
neurons, but not neonatal-born neurons, in attributing early pos-
itive value to odorants that do not elicit reliable innate attraction
or avoidance behavior (2). Given this context, we propose that
adult-born GCs could be more prone to participate in adaptive
odor responses, while their preexisting counterparts would be de-
dicated to innate behaviors.
How can these functional differences between the two GC
populations be explained? Several studies have revealed distinct
functional properties between adult-born and neonatal-born
neurons. For instance, young adult-born OB interneurons have
been reported to be more excitable than preexisting ones (16) and
to undergo different experience-dependent synaptic modifications
(17) before losing these features once mature. In addition, adult-
generated neurons respond differently to novel odors (20) and are
more prone to cell death compared with their neonatal counter-
parts (21). In our study, newly generated GCs were more than
10 wk old at the time the mice learned the task; therefore they had
already reached their final excitability (39). Interestingly, it has
been shown that OB adult-born neurons undergo experience-
dependent plasticity long after maturation and integration, suggesting
that the potential time window for plasticity of these neurons
extends well into maturity (14, 19). In the same line, we recently
showed matching, robust structural plasticity in GCs and M/TCs of
the OB, and computational modeling demonstrated this plasticity
to be compatible with stable memory (15). Finally, we have shown
that mature adult-born neurons express unique features in their
synaptic outputs that are distinctly sensitive to GABAB receptor
modulation, leading to their escape from autoinhibition (18). This
last property could explain in part why photoactivation of adult-
born neurons is more effective in accelerating learning than acti-
vation of preexisting ones.
Top-Down Control of GC Activity. To be efficient, sensory processing
requires a combination of external sensory inputs and top-down
feedback provided by higher-order brain areas, which assign
meaning to the sensory cue. In the olfactory system, the OB is not
a mere relay for olfactory information. In addition to receiving
sensory inputs from the olfactory epithelium, it receives numerous
centrifugal inputs from different brain areas, such as regions of the
olfactory cortex and limbic and neuromodulatory subcortical re-
gions (10). GCs are therefore perfectly located to integrate both
sensory and top-down information, adapting sensory processing to
the behavioral and/or internal context, which may include valence,
sleep/arousal, stress, nutrition status, attention, and motivation.
Coarse lesioning of centrifugal afferents to the OB impairs the
animal’s ability to perform reward-associated olfactory discrimi-
nation tasks or perceptual learning (40). Along these lines, we
recently found that olfactory associative learning promotes a se-
lective synaptic plasticity of cortico-bulbar inputs to young adult-
born GCs, resulting in the strengthening of top-down inputs (13).
Future experiments will be required to decipher how top-down
inputs could affect adult-born neuron activity during the olfactory
learning process. In addition to the already identified discrep-
ancies between the two GC subpopulations, the possibility of a
unique functional connectivity within the OB circuit and/or with
higher brain regions remains to be explored.
Relevance of Coding Odor Value at Early Stages of Information Processing.
The associative features of reward outcome and the expectation
following learning occur at early stages in several primary sensory
cortices (41–43). In the olfactory system, reward-outcome encod-
ing has been characterized in different regions (4–7). Our present
results show that odor value information is present in GC in-
terneurons, specifically in those produced in the adult brain.
Remarkably, light-induced activity of adult-born GCs, without
odor stimulus, is enough to trigger reward-motivated behavior in a
few blocks for a subgroup of animals. The difficulty with using GC
photoactivation as the only stimulus could explain why only some
animals are able to learn this task. Because mere adult-born GC
activation is able to drive behavioral responses, we propose that
adult-born GCs could target spontaneous M/TC activity to gen-
erate relevant “virtual olfactory information.” Then this in-
formation, instead of odor-evoked signals, could be conveyed to
the cortex. We demonstrated previously that in vivo GC 40-Hz
photoactivation shapes spontaneous M/TC responses in favor of
highly active M/TCs, thus enhancing the contrast between M/TC
firing rates (32). Here, as no odor stimulus was present, we hy-
pothesized that M/TC spontaneous activity might be adjusted by
anticipatory information, potentially mediated by top-down fibers.
This anticipatory activity may thus help to produce regularity of
the virtual olfactory information throughout learning. However,
intertrial variability of this anticipatory information could also be
one of the reasons why this learning is extremely difficult. Addi-
tionally, even if odor stimuli could be replaced in some cases by
GC photoactivation to learn this task, the absence of reward
cannot be replaced by light stimulation, indicating that GC acti-
vation is not itself rewarding and that a real reward is necessary
to trigger this behavior (Fig. S7). Further experiments will be
necessary to decipher which features of GC activity acting on M/TCs
are used by downstream brain structures to trigger an adequate
reward-motivated behavior.
Reward-outcome encoding in adult-born GCs, probably medi-
ated by top-down inputs, might improve stimulus selection and
information extraction, two processes required to cope with am-
biguous sensory inputs. As proposed in other sensory modalities,
odor-reward coding in adult-born neurons might change the state
of the OB circuit to achieve rapid processing of olfactory stimuli
during learning. We and others have previously demonstrated that
GC activation shapes M/TC firing, increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio (32, 34). Furthermore, adult-born neurons might play a role
in supporting coincident activity detection necessary to associate
sensory inputs with reward values. Although odor and reward are
never coincident in our task, both M/TC and GC activity could
be modulated in the long term by local and/or external inputs (44,
45). Recent results suggest the presence of strong sensory-evoked
feedback projections from the anterior olfactory nucleus to the
OB that mediate different brain states (46). We hypothesize that
preferential control of adult-born neurons by the top-down fibers
carrying information about reward outcome could explain the
differences between GC subpopulations (Fig. S10). The odor-
activated GCs might be endowed with a sensory experience-
dependent tag that could be potentiated by top-down fibers
containing reward information. As mentioned before, long-lasting
GC activity could be the potential neural substrate of this tag. For
instance, glomerulus-specific long-term potentiation (LTP) at
GABAergic GC-M/TC synapses, requiring activity-dependent IGF1
signaling, was recently described to be essential for social memory
formation in the OB (47). Alternatively, LTP at the synapses be-
tween centrifugal top-down fibers and adult-born GCs could be a
potential mechanism capturing this sensory experience-dependent
tag (13, 17).
As was classically described for basal ganglia/midbrain dopa-
mine neurons (48), after the association between a sensory cue
and the presence of a reward, reward-predicting cues become
capable of triggering reward expectation. These reward signals in
the adult-born GC population may be boosted by photoactivation,
thereby increasing the likelihood of top-down–mediated synaptic
plasticity specifically in these neurons. Further characterization of
reward-signaling dynamics in the OB during the learning process
as well as the top-down circuits implicated in their generation will
be required to fully understand the circuit basis of olfactory-
associative learning.

 Materials and Methods
Animals. The mice used in this study were young adult (>2 mo old, n = 160)
C57BL/6JRj males, except for those injected at P6, which were either male
(n = 58) or female (n = 55). There was no significant difference between
males and females in learning performance (first initiation task, group:
F1,80 = 0.33, P = 0.57, repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, n = 41). Mice
were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle with dry food and water
available ad libitum except during behavioral experiments. All proce-
dures were consistent with the European Communities Council Directive
of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/EU) and the European Union guidelines
and were reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of
Institut Pasteur. We used the minimum number of animals, estimated from
our previous knowledge in performing the same type of experiments.
Lentiviral Vectors and Stereotaxic Injections. LV-ChR2(H134R)-YFP was injected
into the RMS as described previously (32).
Behavior, in Vivo Light Stimulation, and Odorants. Olfactory stimulation was per-
formed as described previously (32). Odor-exposure sessions were conducted in
modified olfactometers. The difficult pairs of odorants and the dilutions used in
the experiments were 0.6% ethyl butyrate + 0.4% amyl acetate vs. 0.4% ethyl
butyrate + 0.6% amyl acetate (P1) and 1% (+)-limonene vs. 1% (−)-limonene (P2).
BrdU Injection, Immunohistochemistry, and Image Analysis. Optimal detection
and quantification of c-Fos+/BrdU+ cells were obtained as described pre-
viously (32). See SI Materials and Methods for more detailed information.
