IMPORTANCE Skin cancer, primarily melanoma, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To provide an updated systematic review for the US Preventive Services
Task Force regarding clinical skin cancer screening among adults.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
were searched for relevant studies published from January 1, 1995, through June 1, 2015, with
surveillance through February 16, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations 15 years
and older at general risk for skin cancer.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Relevant data were abstracted, and study quality
was rated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Melanoma incidence and mortality, harms from
cancer screening, diagnostic accuracy, and stage distribution.
RESULTS No randomized clinical trials were identified. There was limited evidence on the
association between skin cancer screening and mortality. A German ecologic study
(n = 360 288) found a decrease of 0.8 per 100 000 melanoma deaths in a region with
population-based skin cancer screening compared with no change or slight increases in
comparison regions. The number of excisions needed to detect 1 skin cancer from clinical
visual skin examinations varied by age and sex; for example, 22 for women 65 years or older
compared with 41 for women aged 20 to 34 years. In 2 studies of performing visual skin
examination, sensitivity to detect melanoma was 40.2% and specificity was 86.1% when
conducted by primary care physicians (n = 16 383). Sensitivity was 49.0% and specificity was
97.6% when skin examinations were performed by dermatologists (n = 7436). In a
case-control study of melanoma (n = 7586), cases diagnosed with thicker lesions (>0.75 mm)
had an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.98) for receipt of a physician skin examination in
the prior 3 years compared with controls. Eight cohort studies (n = 236 485) demonstrated a
statistically significant relationship between the degree of disease involvement at diagnosis
and melanoma mortality, regardless of the characterization of the stage or lesion thickness.
Tumor thickness greater than 4.0 mm was associated with increased melanoma mortality
compared with thinner lesions, and late stage at diagnosis was associated with increased
all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Only limited evidence was identified for skin cancer
screening, particularly regarding potential benefit of skin cancer screening on melanoma
mortality. Future research on skin cancer screening should focus on evaluating the
effectiveness of targeted screening in those considered to be at higher risk for skin cancer.

S
kin cancer is among the most common cancers in men and
women in the United States,1 and classified as either non-
melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (ie, basal cell and squamous
cell cancers) or melanoma skin cancer. Although NMSC represents
more than 97% of skin cancers,1 melanoma skin cancer is the pri-
mary public health concern with a higher case-fatality rate.2 Esti-
matesfor2015were73 870peoplediagnosedwithmelanomainthe
United States and 9940 deaths from their disease.3
The rationale for skin cancer screening is to detect skin can-
cers,particularlymelanoma,earlierintheirclinicalcoursethanwould
happen in usual care, potentially allowing for earlier and more ef-
fectivetreatment.Primarycarephysiciansordermatologistscanper-

tect suspicious lesions for potential biopsy.
In 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) con-
cluded that the current evidence was insufficient (I recommenda-
tion) to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening the
adult general population by primary care clinicians.4,5 The purpose
of this report was to provide an updated systematic review for the
USPSTF regarding clinical skin cancer screening among adults.

Scope of Review
An analytic framework and 5 key questions (KQs) were developed
(Figure 1). The KQs were designed to identify direct evidence of
the benefit of clinical visual skin cancer screening for skin cancer
morbidity and mortality (KQ1), the harms and test characteristics
of clinical visual skin cancer screening (KQ2 and KQ3), the effec-
tiveness of clinical visual skin cancer screening for early detection
of skin cancer (KQ4), and the association between earlier detec-
tion of skin cancer and skin cancer morbidity and mortality and
all-cause mortality (KQ5).
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE,PubMed,andtheCochraneCentralRegisterofControlled
Trials were searched for English-language studies published
from January 1, 1995, through June 1, 2015. The reference lists
weresearchedfromincludedstudies,systematicreviews,andmeta-
analyses. Suggestions were also sought from experts, and
Clinicaltrials.gov was searched to identify relevant ongoing trials.
Since June 2015, we continued to conduct ongoing surveil-
lancethrougharticlealertsandtargetedsearchesofhigh-impactjour-
nalstoidentifymajorstudiespublishedintheinterimthatmayaffect
theconclusionsorunderstandingoftheevidenceandthereforethe
related USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance was con-
ducted on February 16, 2016, and no new studies were included in
the review.
Study Selection
Two researchers independently reviewed 12 514 unique titles with
abstracts and 453 full-text articles against a priori inclusion and ex-
clusioncriteria.Weincludedstudiesofasymptomaticadults15years
andolderandconductedincountrieswithaveryhigh(>0.9)Human
Development Index (HDI) according to the United Nations.8 Stud-
ies conducted in very high HDI countries are more likely to be ap-
plicabletoUSsettings.Randomizedclinicaltrials,observationalstud-
ies (ie, cohort and case-control studies), and ecologic studies were
included for all key questions. Case series or case reports were also
includedforidentificationofpotentialharmsduetoscreening(KQ2).
Screening studies were excluded if they focused on skin examina-
tionsinresponsetopatientconcernsaboutsuspiciouslesionsorin-
dividualswithknownskincancer;skinself-screeningbyindividuals
or partners; physician counseling for self-screening; intermediate
or health outcomes relating clinician skin examination to other risk
factors (eg, sun-protection behaviors); or measures of patient-
physician relationship quality (Figure 2).
For effectiveness and harms studies, screening tests were de-
fined as whole or partial visual skin examination conducted by pri-
mary care physicians or dermatologists with or without tools to aid
examination (eg, dermatoscopy, whole-body photography). For
studies focusing on morbidity and mortality, studies of skin cancer
mortality,all-causemortality,ormorbiditiesassociatedwithanyskin
cancer (ie, melanoma in situ, dysplastic nevi, and actinic keratosis),
includingqualityoflife,werereviewed.Fordiagnosticaccuracystud-

evaluatedeitherAmericanJointCommitteeonCancer(AJCC)stage9
or Breslow lesion thickness at diagnosis were included. Detailed
search strategies are listed in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Dual independent critical appraisal of all articles meeting the inclu-
sion criteria was performed. Each study was categorized as good,
fair,orpoorqualityinaccordancewithUSPSTFdesign-specificqual-
ity criteria supplemented with quality criteria for ecologic studies

Effectiveness of Skin Cancer Screening
Key Question 1. What is the direct evidence that visual skin cancer
screening by a primary care clinician or dermatologist reduces skin
cancer morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality?
Noeligibletrialsassessedskincancermorbidityorall-causemor-
tality associated with physician visual skin screening. One fair-
quality ecologic study with 3 publications12-14 compared trends in
melanomamortalityover10yearsinnorthernGermany,wherethere
was a population-based clinical visual skin cancer screening pro-
gram, with trends in the surrounding regions with no population-
based skin cancer screening. The Skin Cancer Research to Provide
Evidence for Effectiveness of Screening in Northern Germany
(SCREEN) study launched a population-based skin cancer screen-
ing intervention in 2003, which included physician training, a skin
cancerpublicawarenesscampaign,andreferralprotocoltoderma-
tology.Duringthe1-yearinterventionperiod(2003-2004),360 288
adults were screened with a visual skin cancer examination primar-
ily by nondermatologists, representing about 19% of the eligible
population. The majority of adults screened were women (73.6%),
and the mean (SD) age was 49.7 (16.2) years. Approximately 39%
of screened individuals were recommended to follow up with der-
matologists but were lost to follow-up and did not return for der-
matology review.
Between1998to1999(prescreening)and2008to2009(post-
screening), age- and sex-adjusted melanoma mortality decreased
by 48% in the intervention region, from 1.7 deaths (95% CI, 1.4-
2.0) to 0.9 deaths (95% CI, 0.7-1.1) per 100 000 persons, repre-
senting an overall absolute mortality difference of 0.8 melanoma
deathsper100 000persons(Table2).Overthesameperiodinthe
5 comparison regions, melanoma mortality remained stable or in-
creasedby0.1to0.3deathsper100 000persons,representingin-
creases of 2% to 32%.

20 to 34 years. Similar patterns were observed in men and across
the other types of skin cancer.
Inapopulationof45adultswhounderwentshavebiopsyafter

metic results as poor for 7.1% of shave sites (mean score, 1.7, be-
tween excellent to good) compared with a physician who rated the
results as poor for 16.1% of shave sites (mean score, 2.5, between
good to fair).15
Screening Diagnostic Accuracy
Key Question 3. What are the test characteristics of visual screen-
ing for skin cancer when performed by primary care clinicians
vs dermatologists?
Two fair-quality cohort studies conducted in Australia evalu-
ated test characteristics of skin cancer screening performed by pri-
mary care physicians or dermatologists (Table 2). In Queensland,
Australia, primary care physicians conducted screenings among
16 383 adults.16 Cancer outcomes were determined by pathology
or biopsy reports for positive screens. The study did not follow up
participants with negative screen results, so the exact number of
true-negative and false-negative findings was unknown. There-
fore, false-negative rates for melanoma were estimated using prior
literature in a population screened for skin cancer and melanoma
rates for the Queensland population. The recall rate was 14.1% for
those who screened positive and were referred to their usual pri-
mary care physicians for follow-up. Although the study did not re-
port sensitivity for melanoma detection, sensitivity could be calcu-
lated using an estimated false-negative rate. Based on melanomas
detected within 3 years of the first screen examination, sensitivity
formelanomadetectionwascalculatedas40.2%,andspecificitywas
86.1% (95% CI, 85.6%-86.6%).

Summary of Findings
Key Question 1
Katalinic et al,12 2012
Waldmann et al,13 2012
Breitbart et al,14 2012 (SCREEN)
Between prescreening (1998-1999) and postscreening (2008-2009), melanoma mortality in the intervention
region decreased from 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.0) to 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7-1.1) deaths per 100 000 persons. There were
no mortality reductions observed in the surrounding comparison areas.
Key Question 2
Waldmann et al,13 2012
Breitbart et al,14 2012 (SCREEN)
The number of excisions needed to detect skin cancer varied by age and sex. Detecting 1 melanoma in women
aged â‰¥65 y required 22 excisions compared with 41 in women aged 20-34 y. Similar patterns were observed
in men and across other skin cancer types.
Gambichler et al,15 2000
Six months after shave biopsy for removal of potential NMSC, patients reported cosmetic outcomes as poor
for 7.1% of shave sites compared with 16.1% of physician assessment.
Key Question 3
Aitken et al,16 2006
With primary care physicians conducting screenings, specificity for melanoma detection was 86.1% (95% CI,
85.6%-86.6%) at 36-mo follow-up. The study did not report sensitivity, but by using the studyâ€™
s estimated
false-negative rates, sensitivity was calculated at 40.2%.
Fritschi et al,17 2006
With dermatologists and plastic surgeons conducting screenings, specificity for melanoma detection was 97.6%
(95% CI, 97.2%-97.9%) and sensitivity was 49.0% (95% CI, 34.4%-63.7%) at 24-mo follow-up.
Key Question 4
Aitken et al,18 2010
Overall 28.3% of controls reported receiving a clinical skin exam in the previous 3 y compared with 35.3% of
melanoma cases. Compared with controls, the OR for receiving a recent clinical skin exam was 1.38 (95% CI,
1.22-1.56) among cases with thin melanoma lesions (â‰¤0.75 mm) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.98) among cases
with thicker lesions (>0.75 mm).

Skin Cancer Screening and Early Detection
KeyQuestion4.Doesvisualskincancerscreeningleadtoearlierde-
tection of skin cancer compared with usual care?
One fair-quality case-control study18measured the association
between whole-body skin examinations by a physician during the
3 years before melanoma diagnosis and risk of invasive melanoma
according to lesion thickness at diagnosis (Table 2). The study
was conducted among 3762 cases with incident melanoma in
Queensland,Australia,and3824controlsrandomlyselectedthrough
electoral rolls and given a referent date. Of controls, 28.3% re-
ported receiving a skin examination within 3 years of their refer-
ence date compared with 35.3% of melanoma cases. When strati-
fied by lesion thickness, prevalence of report of receiving a clinical
skin examination declined as lesion thickness increased: 38.7% for
lesionslessthan0.75mm,30.3%forlesions0.76to1.49mm,28.0%
forlesions1.5to2.99mm,and22.5%forlesions3.00mmorlarger.
In multivariable-adjusted models, cases diagnosed with thin mela-
noma (ï¿½0.75 mm) had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.22-
1.56) for physician skin examination in the previous 3 years com-
paredwithcontrols.Casesdiagnosedwiththickerlesions(>0.75mm)
had an OR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-.98) for recent physician skin ex-

thickest melanoma lesions (ï¿½3.00 mm) had an OR of 0.60 (95%
CI,0.43-0.83)forrecentphysicianskinexaminationcomparedwith
controls.
Early Detection and Morbidity and Mortality
Key Question 5. What is the association between earlier detection
of skin cancer and skin cancer morbidity and mortality and all-
cause mortality?
Eight fair- or good-quality observational studies were included
with a total population of 236 485 (Table 2). These studies exam-
ined the association between either melanoma-specific or all-
cause mortality and lesion thickness or stage at diagnosis (either
AJCC or SEER [US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program]stage)atdiagnosis.Onegood-qualitystudyevaluatedcan-
cer stage and all-cause mortality.
All studies demonstrated a consistent linear increase in risk of
melanoma mortality with increasing tumor thickness or stage, re-
gardlessofcategorization.Tumorthicknessgreaterthan4.0mmwas
associatedwithincreasedmelanomamortalitycomparedwiththin-
ner lesions in multivariable-adjusted models (hazard ratios [HRs]
ranging from 3.17; 95% CI, 2.56-3.92, to 32.62; 95% CI, 18.78-
56.63). In the largest study, with 68 495 melanoma cases diag-
nosed from 1992 to 2006 identified through 13 SEER registries,
greatertumorthicknesswasassociatedwithhighermelanomamor-
tality. Compared with thin lesions (<1.0 mm), HRs for melanoma

thesamestudypopulationandcategorizingbySEERsummarystage,
distant stage was associated with increased melanoma mortality
compared with localized disease. In a cohort study of 39 049 resi-
dents of California who were diagnosed with melanoma, late stage

justed models (HR, 10.39; 95% CI, 8.96-12.0).
Discussion
Asubstantialbodyofevidenceconsistentlysuggeststhatlaterstage
andincreasingskinlesionthicknessatmelanomadetectionisasso-
ciatedwithincreasedmelanomaandall-causemortalityrisk(Table3).
However, the evidence for an association between skin cancer
screening and melanoma mortality is limited (Table 3). One popu-
lation-based ecologic study found that visual skin examination by
physicians was associated with a small reduction in absolute differ-
ences in population-level melanoma mortality. However, study de-
sign limits assessment of the intervention in the absence of a com-
parison population or more robust control of confounding. In
addition,newlypublishedfollow-upresearchhassuggestedthatthe
decline in melanoma mortality was transient, and melanoma mor-
tality has returned to prescreening levels.28
Skin cancer screening could be accompanied by psychosocial
harms, cosmetic harms, or overdiagnosis (ie, the diagnosis of dis-
ease that will not cause symptoms or death in a personâ€™
s expected
lifetime).Formelanoma,biopsyaloneisnotusuallysufficientforre-

ing skin cancers was part of both studies and is likely important for
improving performance, for both screening and responding to pa-
tient concerns. In the United States, some primary care physicians
may not be fully confident in their skills to conduct skin cancer

In the SCREEN study in
Germany, melanoma
mortality decreased
48% from 1.7 to 0.9
melanoma deaths per
100 000 individuals
5 years after the
screening program.
Absolute reduction
was 0.8 melanoma
deaths per 100 000

were no mortality
reductions in the
surrounding
geographic areas.
Consistency could not

only 1 study was

In the main study, an
ecologic study design
permitted only
population-level analysis
of mortality rates
compared with those in
the surrounding areas,
not individual-level data.
In the absence of
comparison of
individual-level data, the
study was not able to
address confounding and
participant screening
bias. The physician
screening component was
part of a multimodal
screening program
involving physician
education, dermatologist
referral for
screen-detected lesions,
public outreach, and
access to physician review
of patient-identified
suspicious lesions.
The screening program made
considerable efforts to be
truly population-based and
screen the entire adult
population in the study area.
However, the screened
population (19% of total
eligible) had a high
proportion of younger
women screened, who are at
low risk for melanoma.

cer screening goals.
The benefits of skin cancer screening may be greatest among
subgroups most likely to develop fatal melanoma. Several algo-
rithms use melanoma risk factors to qualify risk of melanoma and
could have utility for screening programs in identifying individuals
who might benefit most from screening.36-39 However, none have
been externally validated, and they are generally based on risk in
people of white race.36-39 No evidence was identified to suggest

The body of evidence for skin cancer screening would be
improved with prospective studies of both universal and risk-
based screening strategies with sufficient follow-up time (at least
12 months postexamination) to assess individual-level melanoma
outcomes in screened and unscreened people. Researchers con-
ducting skin cancer screening studies should be aware of the
effect of healthy participant bias and assess comprehensive data
on the skin cancer risk factors of study participants. In instances of
multicomponent skin cancer reduction strategies, assessment of
the relative effect of each component, including visual skin exami-
nation performed by physicians independent of media campaigns,
would be beneficial. Advancement of knowledge on potential
overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with population-
based skin cancer screening would help distinguish benefits of
screening from potential harms.
