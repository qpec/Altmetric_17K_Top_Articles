Objectives: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has been shown to reduce HIV trans-
mission in people at high risk of HIV infection. Adherence to PrEP strongly correlates with the level of HIV protec-
tion. Long-acting injectable ARVs provide sustained systemic drug exposures over many weeks and can improve
adherence due to infrequent parenteral administration. Here, we evaluated a new long-acting formulation of
raltegravir for prevention of vaginal HIV transmission.
Methods: Long-acting raltegravir was administered subcutaneously to BALB/c, NSG (NOD–scid–gamma) and
humanized BLT (bone marrow–liver–thymus) mice and rhesus macaques. Raltegravir concentration in peripheral
blood and tissue was analysed. Suppression of HIV replication was assessed in infected BLT mice. Two high-dose
HIV vaginal challenges were used to evaluate protection from HIV transmission in BLT mice.
Results: Two weeks after a single subcutaneous injection of long-acting raltegravir in BLT mice (7.5 mg) and rhe-
sus macaques (160 mg), the plasma concentration of raltegravir was comparable to 400 mg orally, twice daily in
humans. Serum collected from mice 3 weeks post-administration of long-acting raltegravir efficiently blocked
HIV infection of TZM-bl indicator cells in vitro. Administration of long-acting raltegravir suppressed viral RNA in
plasma and cervico-vaginal fluids of infected BLT mice, demonstrating penetration of active raltegravir into
the female reproductive tract. Using transmitted/founder HIV we observed that BLT mice administered a single
subcutaneous dose of long-acting raltegravir were protected from two high-dose HIV vaginal challenges 1 week
and 4 weeks after drug administration.
Conclusions: These preclinical results demonstrated the efficacy of long-acting raltegravir in preventing vaginal
HIV transmission.
Introduction
Despite significant advances in treatment of HIV infection that
remarkably prolong the lifespan and greatly improve the quality
of life of people living with HIV/AIDS, new cases continue to
occur in both developed and developing countries.1 The prevention
of HIV infection remains a critical public health priority. Use of anti-
retroviral drugs (ARVs) for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV
in high-risk populations [pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)] has been
validated in multiple clinical trials.2 –5 Clinical trials showed that
daily use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or Truvada (combination
of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with emtricitabine) reduces the
risk of HIV-1 infection by 44%–75%; however, only 50%–81% of
participants in these clinical trials had consistently detectable teno-
fovir in blood samples.6 Efficacyof PrEP for participants with detect-
able plasma tenofovir increased to 74%–92%, suggesting that
high drug regimen adherence is necessary to effectively prevent
sexual HIV transmission by PrEP.7,8 Long-acting, parenteral ARV
formulations that would require less frequent dosing may represent
a viable alternative for HIV prevention. Two ARVs formulated
as long-acting injectable crystalline nanosuspensions have pro-
gressed to clinical trials.
Cabotegravir (GSK-744) is a potent integrase strand transfer
inhibitor formulated as a long-acting parenteral nanosuspension
at a concentration of 200 mg/mL. Monthly or quarterly intramus-
cular injections of cabotegravir in humans maintained plasma
drug concentrations 4-fold higher than the protein-adjusted
90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC90).9 Protection from rectal
and vaginal SHIV transmission was also observed in macaques
treated with cabotegravir and plasma drug concentrations
appeared similar to those observed in humans.10–12
Long-acting rilpivirine is an NNRTI formulated as a nanosus-
pension with a concentration of 300 mg/mL. A single intramuscu-
lar injection of long-acting rilpivirine provides sustained release of

 rilpivirine into plasma over 3 months in dogs, 2 months in rats13,14
and 3 weeks in mice.14 In humans, a single intramuscular admin-
istration of long-acting rilpivirine leads to substantial levels of ril-
pivirine in plasma, cervico-vaginal fluid and vaginal tissue for
84 days.15 Recently, we evaluated long-acting rilpivirine for pro-
tection from vaginal transmission of transmitted/founder HIVs,
using a preclinical in vivo model of vaginal HIV transmission,
humanized BLT (bone marrow–liver–thymus) mice.16 – 20 Our
results demonstrated that a single intramuscular injection of
15 mg of long-acting rilpivirine offers significant protection from
two consecutive high-dose HIV-1 challenges 1 and 4 weeks
after drug administration.21
One highly desirable pharmacokinetic property for selection of
PrEP agents targeting sexual HIV transmission is their ability to rap-
idly distribute to genital and rectal tissues, where the initial rounds
of viral replication occur.8 ARVs differ greatly in their capability
to penetrate mucosal tissues or secretions.22 – 24 Raltegravir
(Isentress) is an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Several stud-
ies have shown good penetration and distribution of raltegravir in
the female genital tract and cervico-vaginal fluid.25,26 Similarly, ral-
tegravir penetration in the seminal compartment was found to be
higher (although somewhat variable) when compared with
blood.22,27,28Macaques orally treated with 50 mg/kg raltegravir sus-
pension in PBS also showed a high and sustained concentration of
raltegravir in vaginal and rectal secretions.29 These studies suggest
that, in addition to good tolerability, effective antiretroviral activity
and ability to inhibit viral replication by binding tightly to pre-
integration complex, raltegravir may hold promise as an HIV
prophylactic agent for its accumulation in mucosal tissue. This is fur-
ther supported by the fact that in the RAG-hu (humanized BALB/
c-Rag22/2gc2/2) mouse model dailyoral administration of raltegra-
vir was able to protect against a single vaginal HIV-1 challenge.30
Here, we present the in vivo and in vitro evaluation of a new,
long-acting formulation of raltegravir for HIV-1 treatment during
acute infection and for PrEP of vaginal transmission. Our results
demonstrate excellent pharmacokinetic properties in non-human
primates (NHPs) and robust antiretroviral activity and long-term
protection from repeated vaginal HIV challenges in humanized
BLT mice.
Methods
Long-acting raltegravir preparation, administration
and plasma and tissue level analysis
Suspension of long-acting raltegravir was prepared by reconstitution of
milled g-irradiated raltegravir with sterile vehicle containing 5% polyethyl-
ene glycol 3350, 0.2% polysorbate 80 and 5% mannitol in water. The final
drug concentration was 50 mg/mL.
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recom-
mendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
the National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of the University
of North Carolina for mice and Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co.,
Inc. for mice and NHPs.
A 30 mg/kg dosewas administered to rhesus macaques in two injections
per animal (15 mg/kg each injection, 300 mL/kg long-acting raltegravir for-
mulation) subcutaneously between the shoulder blades. One subcutaneous
injection of 30 mg/kg (600 mL/kg formulation) and/or 300 mg/kg (6 mL/kg
formulation) long-acting raltegravir was administered into the lumbar
part of the back of BALB/c (n¼3), NSG (n¼10) and BLT (n¼13) mice.
Plasma was isolated from peripheral blood samples collected in
EDTA-treated tubes from mouse retro-orbital venous sinus or the femoral
vein of macaques and stored at 2808C until analysis.
The concentrations of raltegravir were determined by tandem LC–MS
assays following a protein precipitation step. Aliquots of plasma (50 mL)
were precipitated by addition of 150 mL of acetonitrile containing 0.1% for-
mic acid and the internal standard followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm
for 10 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was combined 1:1 with water
containing 0.1% formic acid prior to analysis. Tandem LC–MS analysis
was performed on a Thermo Transcend LX2 system with an HTS PAL CTC
autosampler interfaced to an API-5000 mass spectrometer utilizing the
turbo ionspray interface (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Separation
of raltegravir was achieved on an Aquity XSelect HSS T3 column
(50×2.1 mm, 2.5 mm) using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic
acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B)
at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. The chromatography was run following
initial equilibration using a step gradient as follows: after sample injection,
solvent B was maintained at 20% for 0.25 min before it was increased lin-
early to 98% of solvent B over a 1.5 min period. The fraction of solvent B was
maintained for 0.42 min, then returned to the initial conditions and kept for
an additional 0.83 min. The total run time was 3 min. Quantification was
done by monitoring the transition of m/z 445.2�m/z 109.1 for raltegravir
and m/z 281.3�m/z 193.1 for imipramine (the internal standard). The
method was linear across a concentration range of 2–5000 nM.
Homogenates of tissues [liver, lung, female reproductive tract (FRT)
and spleen] from non-infected NSG mice (n¼5) were prepared in
3 volumes of deionized water (4 for liver samples) using a Spex Geno/
Grinder tissue homogenizer and analysed using the methods described
above with calibration curves prepared in the appropriate tissue homoge-
nates. Concentrations of raltegravir after administration of the long-acting
formulation were analysed in NSG mice as well as in BLTmice. Similar phar-
macokinetic profiles in peripheral blood were noted in both NSG and BLT
mice (see Figure 2a and b). Given the higher cost of BLT mice, we used
NSG mice for the detailed pharmacokinetic analysis and tissue analysis
of drug levels.
TZM-bl cell culture and in vitro HIV-1 inhibition by the
long-acting raltegravir formulation
TZM-bl cells were obtained from Dr John Kappes and procured through the
NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. TZM-bl cells were
maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 500 units/mL
penicillin and 500 mg/mL streptomycin (TZM-bl medium) and cultured at
378C and 5% CO2. TZM-bl cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density
of 1×105 cells per well in TZM-bl medium the day before infection. The
next day, the medium was removed and serum from long-acting
raltegravir-treated or control animals diluted 1:100 or 1:20 in TZM-bl
medium was added (100 mL per well). Cells were incubated for 30 min
and an additional 100 mL of TZM-bl medium containing 20 mg/mL
DEAE–dextran and HIV-1JR-CSF was added. Final concentration of virus
was 3×103 tissue culture infectious units (TCIU) per well. Approximately
48 h later, the medium was removed and the luciferase substrate
ONE-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) supplemented with
0.01% Triton X-100 was added to inactivate virus and to allow the meas-
urement of luciferase activity. Average values from five replicates of cells
incubated in TZM-bl medium containing serum of treated mice were nor-
malized to the luciferase activity of cells incubated with TZM-bl medium
containing serum from untreated mice.
Generation and quantification of HIV
HIV viral stocks were generated by transfecting 293T cells with proviral
DNA (pTHRO and pCH040 plasmids obtained from Dr John Kappes via

 NIAID, NIH) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Two days post-transfection,
the supernatant was harvested and subsequently concentrated by ultra-
centrifuging through 20% sucrose solution at 30000 rpm with a Beckman
SW-41 Ti rotor for 70 min at 48C. The titre of the virus was determined by
infecting TZM-bl cells. TZM-bl cells were plated in 12-well plates at a dens-
ity of 1×105 cells per well in TZM-bl medium. The next day, the medium
was removed and serial dilutions of HIV were made in TZM-bl medium
containing 20 mg/mL DEAE–dextran. Approximately 48 h later, the
medium was removed and the cells were fixed and stained for
b-galactosidase activity. The number of TCIU was calculated.
Generation of humanized BLT mice and intravaginal
exposure to HIV-1
BLT mice were generated as described previously.16,18,19,31 – 33 Briefly,
a 1–2 mm piece of human liver tissue was sandwiched between two
pieces of autologous thymus tissue (Advanced Bioscience Resources,
Alameda, CA, USA) under the kidney capsule of sublethally irradiated
(0.250 Sv) 6- to 8 week-old NOD.Cg- Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (NSG;
The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Following implantation,
mice were transplanted intravenously with haematopoietic CD34+ stem
cells isolated from autologous human foetal liver tissue. Human immune
cell reconstitution was monitored by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral
blood every 2 weeks, as previously described.16,18,31,33 At the end of the
experiments, mice were euthanized by exposure to an excess of tribro-
moethanol. Mice were maintained at the Division of Laboratory Animal
Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) in accord-
ance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
To test the HIV suppression ability of a long-acting raltegravir formula-
tion, female BLT mice (n¼7) were anaesthetized with sodium pentobar-
bital and intravaginally challenged with transmission/founder viruses
(HIVCHO40 3.5×105 TCIU or HIVTHRO 3.5×105 TCIU and HIVRHPA 3.1×105
TCIU). Four weeks later infected mice were treated subcutaneously in
the lumbar part of the back with (300 mg/kg) 7.5 mg of long-acting ralte-
gravir formulation. Mice were monitored for the presence of viral RNA and
drug level in plasma of peripheral blood and cervico-vaginal lavage (CVL)
until virus rebound. For HIV-1 protection, female BLTmice (n¼6) received a
single injection of 300 mg/kg long-acting raltegravir subcutaneously into
the lumbar part of the back. One week later, mice were anaesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital and intravaginally challenged with transmission/
founder viruses (HIVCHO40 3.5×105 TCIU or HIVTHRO 3.5×105 TCIU). Three
weeks later, uninfected mice were challenged vaginally with different
transmission/founder HIV. Specifically, mice receiving HIVTHRO in the first
challenge received HIVCH040 in the second challenge and mice receiving
with HIVCH040 in the first challenge received HIVTHRO in the second chal-
lenge. Mice were monitored for the presence of viral RNA and drug level
in plasma of peripheral blood for 6 weeks.
Analysis of HIV-1 infection in humanized BLT mice
Infection of BLT mice with HIV-1 was monitored in peripheral blood or
cervico-vaginal secretions by determining levels of viral RNA in plasma
or CVL by isolation of RNA with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by
one-step real-time RT–PCR assay, using primers 5′-CATGTTTTCAGCA
TTATCAGAAGGA-3′, 5′-TGCTTGATGTCCCCCCACT-3′ and the MGB probe
carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-5′-CCACCCCACAAGATTTAAACACCATGCTAA-Q
(non-fluorescent quencher)-3′ (Applied Biosystems). The percentage of
human CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood of BLT mice before and after chal-
lenge was determined by flow cytometry with respective antibodies:
hCD45-APC, hCD3-FITC, hCD4-PE and hCD8-PerCP (eBioscience). Flow
cytometry data were collected using a BD FACSCanto cytometer and ana-
lysed using FlowJo software. In the experiment evaluating the ability of
long-acting raltegravir to protect against HIV transmission, we defined
protection as the absence of viral RNA in the plasma of mice at each time-
point tested as well as the absence of viral DNA in the tissues analysed at
necropsy. The presence of viral DNA in tissues and peripheral blood
collected from BLT mice at the end of the experiment was determined
by real-time PCR analysis of DNA extracted from 5×104–4×106 cells
from harvested tissue (spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, lung
and FRT) or from 15 mL of peripheral blood cells. DNA was isolated using
the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR for viral DNA
was performed using the same primers and probe combination as listed
above. As a control for the presence of human cells as well as for the nor-
malization of viral DNA, real-time PCR was also performed for human
g-globin.
Identification of transmitted viruses
Viruses replicating in infected animals were identified by direct sequence
analysis. Viral RNA was isolated from plasma using QIAamp viral RNA col-
umns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and cDNA was
generated using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with
the primer 5′-GTGGGTACACAGGCATGTGTGG-3′. cDNA was amplified
by nested PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche). PCR
primers were designed to anneal in regions with the fewest possible primer
mismatches to HIV-1CH040, HIV-1RHPA and HIV-1THRO sequences. Primer
sequences were as follows: outer forward primer, 5′-TGCATATTGTGA
GTCTGTTACTATGTTTACT-3′; reverse primer 5′-CAGGAGCAGATGATACAG-3′;
inner forward primer, 5′-GTAGGACCTACACCTGTCAAC-3′; reverse primer
5′-CCTGCAAAGCTAGGTGAATTGC-3′. Amplified viral DNA was sequenced
and compared with sequences of transmitted/founder viruses.
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between treated and control animals in the efficacy
of long-acting raltegravir in protecting against vaginal HIV-1 transmission
were determined with the log-rank/Mantel–Cox test. Correlation between
plasma level of raltegravir and viral RNA in plasma and CVL was evaluated
using the non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficient. All statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6).
Results
Pharmacokinetic profiles of long-acting raltegravir in
peripheral blood of BALB/c mice and NHPs
First, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of long-acting raltegra-
vir in naive BALB/c mice and NHPs. The plasma profile of a single
subcutaneous dose of 30 mg/kg long-acting raltegravir adminis-
tered to naive BALB/c mice is shown in Figure 1(a). Raltegravir
was measureable in plasma at 1 h post-treatment (first time-
point) and diminished below PA-IC90 within 4 days. The plasma
profile of the same dose of 30 mg/kg long-acting raltegravir
in uninfected rhesus monkey administered subcutaneously is
shown in Figure 1(b and c). The decline of raltegravir concentra-
tions in plasma of NHPs was slow compared with that observed
in BALB/c mice. Notably, mean plasma raltegravir concentration
was 3-fold above PA-IC90 at 14 days post-administration of long-
acting raltegravir in NHPs. Differences seen in plasma profiles of
raltegravir between BALB/c mice and rhesus macaques adminis-
tered the same dose of long-acting raltegravir may reflect
interspecies differences in rates of drug release from the adminis-
tration depot and physiology. Similar interspecies differences in
plasma profiles have also been observed for formulations of long-
acting rilpivirine.14

 Plasma and tissue concentrations of raltegravir and
antiviral activity of serum in NSG and BLT mice treated
with long-acting raltegravir
In order to achieve plasma concentrations of raltegravir in mice
that will reach levels above PA-IC90 for several weeks, we tested
a higher dose of long-acting raltegravir. Uninfected immunodefi-
cient mice (NSG) and humanized BLT mice received 300 mg/kg of
long-acting raltegravir subcutaneously and drug levels in plasma
were monitored for 4 weeks. The higher dose of long-acting
raltegravir formulation was well tolerated and no injection site
reactions were observed. We also did not observe any signs of
overt toxicity, changes in mouse behaviour, movement, water
consumption or weight loss. Plasma concentrations were similar
in NSG and BLT mice (Figure 2a and b). Interestingly, the higher
dose of subcutaneous long-acting raltegravir led to sustained
concentrations of plasma raltegravir as mean concentrations
were at or above PA-IC90 for 4 weeks after the administration.
The concentration of raltegravir in liver, lung, spleen and FRT of
NSG mice was measured at day 7 (n¼5) and day 28 (n¼5)
after subcutaneous administration of 300 mg/kg long-acting ral-
tegravir (Figure 2c). At day 7 after administration of long-acting
raltegravir, the concentration of drug in most tissues evaluated
was at least 10-fold higher than PA-IC90. Lung and FRT had ralte-
gravir levels comparable to plasma and the tissue/plasma con-
centration ratios for lung and FRT were 0.83 (range 0.63–1.20)
and 0.93 (range 0.51–2.05), respectively. The concentration of
raltegravir in spleen was lower than in plasma; the mean
spleen/plasma concentration ratio was 0.43 (range 0.33–0.56),
whereas the liver/plasma concentration ratio was much higher
(4.89; range 3.51–6.12), as would be anticipated given that the
liver is the major organ of elimination for this drug. Twenty-
eight days after administration of long-acting raltegravir we
were not able to detect raltegravir in most samples. Levels of ral-
tegravir decreased below the limit of quantification (LOQ: lung,
spleen 0.04 mM, liver 0.05 mM; FRT 0.016 mM) in most tissues. It
should be noted, however, that the LOQ for several tissues was
above the PA-IC90.
Next, we measured the ability of serum from uninfected NSG
mice treated with long-acting raltegravir to block in vitro infection
of TZM-bl cells with HIV-1JR-CSF. For this analysis we administered a
single subcutaneous dose (300 mg/kg) of long-acting raltegravir
to NSG mice, collected serum at days 1, 4, 13 and 22 post-
administration and evaluated for antiviral activity in vitro.
The inhibitory activity of serum from mice treated with long-
acting raltegravir was compared with antiviral activity of serum
from naive (control) mice. As shown in Figure 2(d), serum from
treated animals collected 2 weeks post-drug administration
and diluted 1:20 resulted in �90% inhibition of HIV-1 infection
in TZM-bl cells in vitro, and �45% inhibition when collected
3 weeks after administration of long-acting raltegravir. Serum col-
lected 2 weeks after long-acting raltegravir administration and
diluted 1:100 reduced infection by �35% (Figure 2d). Collectively,
these data showed the presence of active raltegravir in plasma of
drug-treated mice beyond 3 weeks post-drug administration.
Suppression of HIV-1 replication in vivo by long-acting
raltegravir
To establish the effect of long-acting raltegravir on HIV infection
in vivo, BLT mice were challenged vaginally with three different
transmitted/founder viruses (HIV-1THRO, HIV-1CH040 and HIV-1RHPA).
Infection, as determined by the presence of HIV RNA in plasma,
was established 1–2 weeks after exposure to virus. At 3 weeks
post-infection, mice were treated with a single dose of long-acting
raltegravir (300 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously and the
levels of viral RNA and drug concentration were monitored for an
additional 6 weeks or until evidence of viral rebound. Viral rebound
was defined as the timepoint after long-acting raltegravir adminis-
tration when we were able to detect a continuous increase in

 plasma viral RNA after suppression (Figure 3a). Rebound virus was
sequenced to determine whether mutations associated with drug
resistance developed. As shown in Figure 3(b), viral RNA levels
declined rapidly after treatment with long-acting raltegravir in all
animals and reached a nadir within 2 weeks of treatment. In the
case of the animals infected with HIV-1THRO, viraemia was sup-
pressed below the LOQ (800 copies of HIV RNA per mL). Two ani-
mals infected with HIV-1RHPA were suppressed below the LOQ
and in another we observed a .2 log decrease in viraemia. In
the case of HIV-1CH040, viraemia dropped by .1.5–2.5 log but
was not fully controlled in any of the animals treated with long-
acting raltegravir (Figure 3c). Viral suppression was maintained
for an average 11.8+7.7 days (range 1–19 days) and viral rebound
was observed 26.4+7.6 days (range 19–39 days) afteradministra-
tion of long-acting raltegravir (Table 1). In order to determine
whether drug resistance mutations were acquired, viral RNA from
plasma was sequenced. We did not observe any mutations in
any of the samples obtained from animals infected with RHPA
and CH040 strains. In the case of one THRO-infected mouse, we
found a single-nucleotide mutation resulting in an amino acid
change at position 268 (integrase domain) from isoleucine to leu-
cine (I268L). This mutation, however, has not been associated with
resistance to raltegravir.34 We also monitored levels of viral RNA in
the CVL of some animals. Following administration of long-acting
raltegravir, we observed levels of viral RNA in CVL to be suppressed
below the LOQ (400 copies/mL) in all animals analysed (Figure 3d).
Like in plasma, viral rebound was noted in all animals. Suppression
of viral RNA persisted in CVL for an average 12.5+8.3 days (range
1–21 days) and viral rebound appeared on average 29.8+8.8 days
(range 21–42 days) after administration of long-acting raltegravir
(Table 1). These results show that active raltegravireffectively pene-
trated the FRT and suppressed viral replication for several weeks.
Interestingly, HIV-1CH040 replication was suppressed in CVL longer
and more efficiently than in plasma (Figure 3c and d). However,
these differences were not found to be statistically significant
(P¼0.0773). The concentration of raltegravir in plasma was sus-
tained and remained above or at PA-IC90 for 4 weeks after admin-
istration of long-acting raltegravir (Figure 3e). To assess whether

 suppression of HIV correlates with plasma raltegravir concentra-
tion, we compared the concentration of raltegravir in plasma
with viral RNA in plasma and CVL between 14 and 28 days after
long-acting raltegravir administration. As shown in Figure 3(f),
raltegravir plasma concentration negatively correlated with plasma
viral RNA (Spearman correlation coefficient¼20.8048, 95%
CI 20.9094 to 20.6044, P,0.0001). However, no significant correl-
ation between raltegravir plasma concentration and CVL viral RNA
was found (Spearman correlation coefficient¼20.4179, 95% CI
20.7832 to 0.1618, P¼0.1203; data not shown).
A single administration of long-acting raltegravir offers
significant protection from two separate high-dose

The ability of long-acting raltegravir to offer protection against
vaginal HIV transmission was evaluated using BLT mice. BLT
mice have a full complement of human haematopoietic cells
present in the FRT that renders them susceptible to HIV infection
after vaginal exposure.16,20 BLT mice have been validated for the

 approach to evaluating the effect of long-acting raltegravir on
vaginal HIV transmission is depicted in Figure 4(a). BLT mice
were treated once with long-acting raltegravir (300 mg/kg)
via subcutaneous injection or left untreated (controls). One
week later mice were challenged vaginally with a high dose of
HIV-1THRO or HIV-1CH040. The presence of viral RNA and raltegravir
in plasma was monitored weekly. Four weeks after long-acting ral-
tegravir administration, mice were exposed to a second high dose
of HIV-1. Mice exposed to HIV-1CH040 in the first viral challenge
were subsequently exposed to HIV-1THRO and mice challenged
with HIV-1THRO in the first challenge were subsequently exposed
to HIV-1CH040. Monitoring for the presence of viral RNA and ralte-
gravir in plasma was continued as indicated above (Figure 4a). As
shown in Figure 4(b), all control mice became infected 2 weeks
after HIV challenge as viral RNA was detected in their peripheral
blood. In contrast, none of the mice treated with long-acting ral-
tegravir was infected 2 weeks after the first challenge (Figure 4c).
However, 1 week after the second challenge, one mouse became
infected and viral RNA sequence analysis identified the virus as
HIV-1CH040. The mouse (T3) was exposed to HIV-1CH040 during
the first challenge and HIV-1THRO in the second challenge
(Table 2), suggesting that HIV-1 transmission occurred during
the first challenge 1 week after drug administration. Two weeks
after the second challenge, two more mice treated with long-
acting raltegravir developed viraemia. Sequence analysis identified
the virus in both mice as HIV-1CH040, the virus used for the second
challenge. No evidence of plasma viral RNAwas noted in any of the
other long-acting raltegravir treated mice. Analysis of DNA from
tissues of the three uninfected mice treated with long-acting ral-
tegravir revealed the absence of viral sequences in all tissues ana-
lysed and confirmed their protection from HIV transmission after
two high-dose challenges (Figure 4g). Longitudinal analysis of per-
ipheral blood by flow cytometry confirmed that levels of human
CD45+ and human CD3+CD4+ cells were similar and remained
stable throughout the course of the experiment in mice treated
with long-acting raltegravir. Gradual decreases in the levels of
human CD3+CD4+ cells were seen only in the infected mice
(Figure 4e and f). In summary, long-acting raltegravir protected
five out of six mice after the first challenge and four out of six
after the second challenge. These results demonstrate that long-
acting raltegravir offered significant protection from a high dose of
virus administered 1 week (83%, P,0.0016) or 4 weeks (66%,
P¼0.0495) later. In summary, in the presence of long-acting ral-
tegravir only three transmission events were seen after 12 high-
dose exposures to transmitted/founder HIV.
Analysis of plasma levels of raltegravir during the course
of exposures
Raltegravir concentrations were monitored in plasma during the
challenge experiments described above (Figure 4d). At the time
of the first virus challenge the lowest concentration of plasma ral-
tegravir was observed in mouse T1. However, this mouse was pro-
tected from HIV-1 infection after both challenges. At the time of
the second challenge, treated mice, including those that became
infected after this second challenge, had similar raltegravir con-
centrations in plasma, with the exception of mouse T4, which
had plasma raltegravir levels 2.5-fold higher than other mice.
Because virus first appeared in plasma while there were raltegravir
levels significantly higher than its PA-IC90, viruses from break-
through infections were sequenced and analysed for the presence
of known drug resistance mutations that might have been
acquired during the course of infection. No mutations associated
with raltegravir resistance were found in the virus present in any of
the mice treated with long-acting raltegravir. These results indi-
cate that long-acting raltegravir offers significant protection
from HIV infection but that raltegravir plasma levels do not dir-
ectly correlate with protection and do not result in the develop-
ment of drug-resistant viruses.
Discussion
Advances in ARV therapy of HIV-infected individuals and the avail-
ability of potent ARVs with known safety have stimulated interest

 in their use for HIV prevention. Although the success of several
clinical trials using Truvada for PrEP led to its regulatory approval
in USA,35 some of the clinical trials also suggested the importance
of adherence to the drug regimen for PrEP efficacy. This was fur-
ther demonstrated in the VOICE study, in which women from
sub-Saharan Africa received oral or topical tenofovir as PrEP.36
The study failed to demonstrate efficacy, most likely due to the
fact that adherence to the drug regimen among participants
measured by detectable tenofovir in the plasma or vaginal swab
samples was ,30% and 50%, respectively.36 Interestingly, in the
same geographical region, injectable progestins for contraceptive
purposes such as depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)
are among the most popular contraceptive methods. This sug-
gests that ARVs formulated as long-acting injectables might
have good acceptance and therefore could serve as possible alter-
natives to oral ARVs for HIV PrEP, with potential for improved
adherence.37
BLT mice with a functional human immune system have a sig-
nificant potential to serve as an effective tool for assessing drug
efficacy for HIV PrEP, including long-acting ART formulations.
Compared with other animal models, important advantages of
BLT mice include their human target cells; their susceptibility to
infection by highly relevant HIV isolates, including transmitted/
founder viruses; the response of these viruses to the same
drugs used for human treatment; and the fact that BLT mice
can be challenged via relevant routes of transmission. We recently
evaluated a long-acting formulation of rilpivirine for prevention of
vaginal transmission in this model.21 Our results and those from
others indicated that mice and rats have higher clearance rates of
rilpivirine from plasma compared with dogs and humans.13
Therefore, in order to reach effective levels of plasma rilpivirine
to prevent HIV transmission the doses of long-acting rilpivirine
administered had to be adjusted for use in BLT mice (15 mg).21
In the current study, the plasma concentration of raltegravir
decreased to the PA-IC90 level within 4 days in BALB/c mice
dosed with 30 mg/kg long-acting raltegravir subcutaneously.
This same dose in macaques resulted in more sustained plasma
levels of raltegravir, which were above PA-IC90 for 2 weeks after
administration. Administration of the higher dose of long-acting
raltegravir subcutaneously to BLT or NSG mice resulted in a
median raltegravir plasma level of 0.15 mg/mL (range 0.07–0.33)
and 0.09 mg/mL (range 0.07–0.12) 7 and 14 days after long-
acting raltegravir administration, respectively (Figure 2a and b).
In humans, a 400 mg oral dose of raltegravir, administered
twice a day, results in a median Ctrough of 0.09 mg/mL (range
0.002–2.47)38 or mean Ctrough of 0.11 mg/mL.39 Thus, raltegravir
plasma concentration in mice 2 weeks after a single administra-
tion of 300 mg/kg long-acting raltegravir subcutaneously was
within the range of concentration seen in humans administered
400 mg of oral raltegravir twice daily, which makes the higher
dose administered to mice relevant for long-acting raltegravir
evaluation in vivo. Currently, several long-acting ARVs are under
development. Those drugs differ in their pharmacokinetic proper-
ties and tissue penetration. Future human studies are needed for
the selection of an appropriate PrEP agent for targeting sexual HIV
transmission. Andrews et al.11 showed the possible limitation of
cabotegravir in vaginal protection. Only 10% of drug, compared
with plasma, was found in cervical tissues. Low distribution of
drug in the FRT may have resulted in the breakthrough events
that occurred in two out of eight treated animals. In contrast to
cabotegravir, we found comparable distributions of raltegravir in
the plasma and FRT of mice treated with long-acting raltegravir.
This is consistent with previously reported observations from
human studies using oral raltegravir that measured levels of
drug in the female genital tract.25,26 Favourable distribution in
mucosal tissue, particularly in the FRT, is a great advantage of
long-acting raltegravir.
Despite the dramatic spread of HIV-1, the efficiency of
male-to-female intravaginal transmission is surprisingly low,
with only about 1 event per 200–10000 coital acts.40 To model
this rare-event situation in vivo would be challenging. Instead,
high doses of transmitted/founder virus were used for vaginal
challenge during long-acting raltegravir evaluation in BLT mice.
These doses were several-fold higher than expected in sexual
transmission, though it was sufficient to ensure that a single
challenge of untreated (control) BLT mice will result in .90%
HIV transmission. However, as a result of using the high dose of
the virus in the evaluation of long-acting AVR for PrEP, the efficacy
of the drug could be underestimated, as a higher drug concentra-
tion may be needed for prevention of high-dose viral challenge
in BLT mice. This possibility is supported by two recent studies in
macaques. It was shown that female pigtail macaques treated
every 4 weeks with 50 mg/kg of long-acting injectable cabotegra-
vir LA were protected from intravaginal inoculations of lower
doses of chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV,
50 TCIU) twice a week for up to 11 weeks. Using the same dose
of SHIV, placebo controls were all infected after a median
of 4 (range 2–20) vaginal challenges with the same SHIV.12
Nevertheless, in a subsequent study only six of eight female rhe-
sus macaques treated with cabotegravir LA (50 mg/kg) monthly
were protected against three high-dose SHIV (300 TCIU) chal-
lenges and all control animals became infected after the first
challenge.11
In the long-acting raltegravir protection experiment presented
here, all control animals exposed to either HIV-1THRO or HIV-1CH040
transmitted/founder viruses were infected within 2 weeks of the
viral challenge. One out of six of the BLT mice treated with long-
acting raltegravir that were challenged with HIV-1 1 week after
drug administration became infected 4 weeks after the challenge.
This breakthrough infection cannot be explained by lower plasma
concentrations of raltegravir at the time of exposure, as there
were no significant differences in plasma level of raltegravir
between all the long-acting raltegravir treated mice (protected
and unprotected). It is possible that the raltegravir concentration
in the FRT in the breakthrough mouse was lower, allowing trans-
mission of HIV. The fact that no correlation was found between
plasma raltegravir concentration and viral RNA in CVL during the
suppression experiment suggested this possibility. However, this
peripheral blood expressed as a percentage of total live cells (e) and human CD4 levels expressed as a percentage of human CD3-positive cells (f) were
analysed by flow cytometry at the indicated times. (g) Kaplan–Meier plots representing the percentage of BLT mice protected against HIV transmission

 could not be directly examined within the constraints of the cur-
rent experimental design. Specifically, the tissue could not be
removed for analysis since it involves terminal surgery and collec-
tion of CVL could result in removal of the inoculum. Our hypothesis
to explain our breakthrough results and those of Andrews et al.11
is that under these experimental conditions one or a few cells
were productively infected. Virus replication was suppressed for
several weeks due to the systemic presence of drug. Once drug
levels were reduced, replication and spread could take place.
Currently, it is not clear why we did not observe the development
of drug-resistant viruses. However, this is similar to what was
observed in the NHP study.11 Future studies should consider alter-
native experimental designs that would allow sampling of the FRT
and CVL during the course of the study. While this is clearly pos-
sible for NHP studies, it might be challenging for experiments using
humanized mice. In summary, we show here that a single dose of
long-acting raltegravir results in strong virus suppression during
chronic infection. We also show that long-acting raltegravir offers
significant protection against vaginal HIV infection in BLT mice
after a high-dose challenge administered 1 week and 4 weeks
after drug administration. This suggests that long-acting raltegra-
vir is a good candidate for PrEP aimed at preventing vaginal HIV
transmission.

RAL LA, long-acting raltegravir.
BLT mice with the indicated amount of human CD45+ (hCD45) cells and human CD3+CD4+ (hCD4) cells in peripheral blood were treated with 300 mg/kg
long-acting raltegravir formulation subcutaneously or left untreated. One week after administration of long-acting raltegravir, mice were inoculated with
the indicated HIV-1. Three weeks later mice were inoculated again, but this time with a different type of HIV-1. The presence of viral RNA in plasma was
monitored weekly.
Cell-associated DNA was analysed in the indicated tissues: 2, negative for viral DNA; +, positive for viral DNA.
aC indicates control mice and T indicates treated mice.
bVirus in infected mice exposed to two inoculations was identified by sequencing.
