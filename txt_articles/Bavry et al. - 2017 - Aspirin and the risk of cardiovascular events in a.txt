Funding information
There was no funding for this analysis. The
REACH Registry was sponsored by sanofi-
aventis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the
Waksman Foundation (Tokyo, Japan), and is
endorsed by the World Heart Federation.
Background: The benefit of aspirin among patients with stable atherosclerosis without a prior
ischemic event is not well defined.
Hypothesis: Aspirin would be of benefit in outpatients with atherosclerosis with prior ischemic
events, but not in those without ischemic events.
Methods: Subjects from the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health registry
were divided according to prior ischemic event (n =21 724) vs stable atherosclerosis, but no
prior ischemic event (n = 11 872). Analyses were propensity score matched. Aspirin use was
updated at each clinic visit and considered as a time-varying covariate. The primary outcome
was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
Results: In the group with a prior ischemic event, aspirin use was associated with a marginally
lower risk of the primary outcome at a median of 41 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 0.65-1.01, P = 0.06). In the group without a prior ischemic event, aspirin
use was not associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome at a median of 36 months
(HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.73-1.45, P = 0.86).
Conclusions: In this observational analysis of outpatients with stable atherosclerosis, aspirin
was marginally beneficial among patients with a prior ischemic event; however, there was no
apparent benefit among those with no prior ischemic event.

INTRODUCTION
Aspirin has been documented to be beneficial during acute myocar-
dial infarction (MI) and acute ischemic stroke.1,2 In a large meta-
analysis of multiple randomized trials, aspirin was confirmed to be
efficacious in the secondary prevention of future cardiovascular
events.3 Although not well studied, aspirin has been assumed to be
of benefit and recommended in all forms of atherosclerosis, including
those without a prior ischemic event.4–6 However, contemporary
studies are limited. A post hoc analysis of hypertensive patients with
coronary artery disease (CAD) enrolled in a clinical trial found that
aspirin use was associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular events

 among those with a prior ischemic event; however, there was a lack
of evidence for benefit in patients with stable CAD with no prior
ischemic event.7 The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued
Health (REACH) registry is a large international, prospective registry
that enrolled outpatients with atherothrombosis, where the use of
aspirin was at the discretion of the treating physician. This provided a
pragmatic opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of aspirin use across a
wide variety of clinical practice settings in atherosclerosis patients
with and without a prior ischemic event.

METHODS
The design and methods of the REACH registry have been previously
published.8–11 In brief, REACH is a prospective, observational registry
that enrolled consecutive patients at least 45 years of age with CAD,
cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or ≥3 risk factors
for atherosclerosis. Study participants were from 7 geographical
regions. Enrollment occurred between December 2003 and June
2004. The last follow-up data collection was April 2009. Written
informed consent was obtained from all the participants, and the pro-
tocol was approved by the local institutional review board. Data were
centrally collected using standardized case report forms.
For the purpose of the current analysis, aspirin use was updated
at each clinic visit and considered as a time-varying covariate.
Patients using adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists or antic-
oagulants at baseline were excluded from the analysis.12 Patients
were categorized into 2 groups: prior ischemic event (defined as his-
tory of unstable angina, MI, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or stroke,
irrespective of the timing of the event) and stable atherosclerosis, but
no prior ischemic event (defined as stable angina requiring medica-
tion; history of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary
artery bypass grafting; ≥1 carotid plaque or asymptomatic carotid ste-
nosis ≥70%, history of carotid angioplasty, stent, or surgery; ankle
brachial index <0.9 or lower extremity angioplasty, stent, surgery, or
amputation). Participants were followed prospectively for up to
4 years. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of cardiovas-
cular death, MI, or stroke. The secondary outcome was the first
occurrence of all-cause death, MI, or stroke. The tertiary outcomes
were cardiovascular death, all-cause death, MI, and stroke individu-
ally. Bleeding was defined as any event resulting in hospitalization or
transfusion.
Propensity score matching was constructed in an attempt to bal-
ance
the
different
baseline
characteristics
between
exposure
groups.13 Propensity score matching was selected over other models
due to its greater ability to eliminate bias.14 Propensity scores were
calculated using a nonparsimonious multivariable logistic regression
model,13–15 with the dependent variable of time-varying aspirin use,
and 22 baseline characteristics entered as covariates (sex, age, region,
ethnic origin, current smoking, congestive heart failure, hypercholes-
terolemia, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation/flutter, use of
diuretics, β-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, nitrates/other anti-
angina agents, lipid-lowering agents, non–steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, insulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin
receptor blocker, other antihypertensives, aortic stenosis, body mass
index, and peripheral arterial claudication medications). To assess the
propensity-score effectiveness of matching cohorts, we estimated
absolute standardized differences between aspirin and nonaspirin
users, for each variable and in both study groups. An absolute stan-
dardized difference <10% for a given covariate indicated a relatively
small imbalance.
Descriptive statistics including frequencies and percentages for
categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation for continuous
variables were presented. Comparative statistics (Student t test for
continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables) were used
to compare baseline characteristics. The risk of an outcome in aspirin
users vs nonusers was compared using a Cox proportional hazard
regression

the
propensity
score–matched
cohort. To account for excluded patients in the propensity-matched
analysis, a sensitivity analysis using a propensity-adjusted analysis
was also performed.16,17 Another sensitivity analysis for the propen-
sity score–matched cohorts with aspirin status at baseline introduced
in the models (instead of aspirin as a time-varying covariate) was con-
ducted. Subgroup analyses were also performed for the primary out-
come for each cohort on the following variables: diabetes vs no
diabetes, statin use vs no statin use, history of coronary revasculari-
zation vs no coronary revascularization, recent ischemic event
(≤1 year) vs remote ischemic event (>1 year), and history of unstable
angina/MI vs TIA/stroke. All analyses were conducted using SAS
software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Among all participants in the REACH registry, 21 724 were classified
into the prior ischemic event group, and 11 872 patients into the sta-
ble atherosclerosis, but no prior ischemic event group (Figure 1).
3.1
| Prior ischemic event group
In the prior ischemic event group, 19 228 patients (88.5%) reported
using aspirin at baseline. Among aspirin users, aspirin dose was
≥325 mg in 16.2%. Out of the 18 324 patients who reported aspirin
at baseline and had at least 1 aspirin status at any follow-up), 16 072
patients (88%) reported aspirin at the latest available follow-up. Out
of the 2319 patients who did not report aspirin at baseline and had
at least 1 aspirin status at any follow-up), 793 patients (34%)
reported aspirin at the latest available follow-up. The mean number
of follow-up visits was 3.0. There were differences in the baseline
characteristics comparing aspirin users with nonusers (Table 1). Pro-
pensity score matched 2106 aspirin users (11% of the cohort) with
2106 non-users (84% of the cohort). After propensity score matching,
the absolute standardized differences were <10% for all matched
variables (see Supporting Figure 1 in the online version of this article).
The risk of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke
at a median of 41 months was marginally lower with aspirin users vs
nonusers (15.2% vs 15.8%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.65-1.01, P = 0.06). Subgroup analysis for aspirin vs
nonaspirin users, matched on their propensity score for the primary
outcome, revealed no evidence for treatment interaction (Figure 2A).

 Aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of the first occur-
rence of all-cause death, MI, or stroke (18.9% vs 20.6%; HR: 0.74,
95% CI: 0.61-0.90, P < 0.01). The risks of cardiovascular death (HR:
0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.91, P = 0.01) and all-cause death were lower in
the aspirin-users group (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.74, P < 0.01),
whereas the risk of MI (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.68-1.46, P = 1.00), total
stroke (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.61-1.21, P = 0.38), and ischemic stroke
(HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.65-1.75, P = 0.81) were similar for aspirin users
vs nonusers (Figure 3A). Bleeding events were similar between the
groups (HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.19-1.33, P = 0.17). Sensitivity analyses
are provided in the Supporting Table in the online version of this
article.
3.2
| Stable atherosclerosis, but no prior ischemic
event
In the stable atherosclerosis, but no prior ischemic event group, 9526
patients (80%) were aspirin users at baseline. Among aspirin users,
the dose of aspirin was ≥325 mg in 17.5%. Out of the 9003 patients
who reported aspirin at baseline and had at least 1 aspirin status at
any follow-up), 7919 patients (88%) still reported aspirin at the latest
follow-up available. Out of the 2191 patients who did not report
aspirin at baseline and had at least 1 aspirin status at any follow-up,
765 patients (35%) reported aspirin at the latest follow-up available.
The mean number of follow-up visits was 2.9. There were observed
differences in the baseline characteristics between those with aspirin
use vs nonusers prior to matching (Table 2). Propensity score
matched 1782 aspirin users (19% of the cohort) with 1782 nonusers
(76% of the cohort). After propensity score matching, the absolute
standardized differences were <10% for all matched variables (see
Supporting Figure 2 in the online version of this article). The risk of
the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke at a median
of 36 months was similar for aspirin users versus nonusers (10.7% vs
10.5%; HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.73-1.45, P = 0.86). Subgroup analysis for
aspirin vs nonaspirin users, matched on their propensity score, for
the primary outcome revealed evidence for treatment interaction
favoring aspirin therapy with a history of coronary revascularization
vs no coronary revascularization (Pinteraction = 0.05) (Figure 2B).
The risk of the first occurrence of all-cause death, MI, or stroke
was similar (14.7% vs 16.1%; HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.70-1.19, P = 0.49),
as were the risks of cardiovascular death (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.70-
1.79, P = 0.63), all-cause death (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.64-1.21,
P = 0.41), MI (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.51-1.54, P = 0.67), total stroke
(HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 0.86-2.72, P = 0.15), and ischemic stroke (HR:
0.83, 95% CI: 0.36-1.94, P = 0.67) (Figure 3B). Bleeding events were
similar between groups (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.51-2.95, P = 0.66). Sen-
sitivity analyses are provided in the Supporting Table in the online
version of this article.

DISCUSSION
In this large observational analysis from the REACH registry, we
found that aspirin was marginally beneficial for the primary outcome
among patients with a prior ischemic event; however, no benefit was
observed among those with no prior ischemic event. In the cohort
with a prior ischemic event, aspirin use was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower rate of all-cause death, MI, or stroke. The difference in
all-cause mortality was more apparent than the difference in cardio-
vascular mortality, which some have made the case as the preferred
outcome in the evaluation of cardiovascular disease patients.18

 Benefit was not observed among the cohort with stable atherosclero-
sis, but no prior ischemic event; however, subgroup analysis sug-
gested that individuals with prior coronary revascularization might
derive benefit from aspirin.
Several large randomized trials have demonstrated the benefit of
aspirin during acute ischemic events. In the Second International
Study of Infarct Survival, 17 187 acute MI patients were randomized
in 2 × 2 factorial design to aspirin alone, streptokinase alone, both
active treatments, or both placebos for 30 days.1 Aspirin reduced the
risk of all-cause mortality.1 In the International Stroke Trial, 19 435
acute ischemic stroke patients were randomized to aspirin vs no aspi-
rin and to heparin vs no heparin.2 Aspirin was associated with a
reduction in early stroke; however, there was no mortality benefit.2 A
recent meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that aspirin is
associated with a reduction in the risk of early recurrent strokes;
however, this benefit diminishes with long-term use.19
Among the prior ischemic event group, aspirin was associated
with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality,
although there was no apparent reduction in MI. The lack of benefit
for aspirin on the outcome of MI among subjects with a prior

 ischemic event was similar to another observational study and may
have to do with a lack of adjudication of events in this registry.7
Although the short-term use of aspirin initiated during a MI was
shown to reduce the risk of recurrent MI in a large trial,1 other trials
evaluating the long-term use of aspirin in patients with prior MI had
shown conflicting results on the risk of MI with aspirin compared
with placebo.20,21 In addition, up to 50% of incident MIs are clinically
silent, which makes complete ascertainment of this complex outcome
difficult during registry follow-up.22 Among those with a prior ische-
mic event, aspirin may be associated with a survival advantage by
attenuating the severity of recurrent thrombosis-mediated events,
rather than reducing the occurrence of MI per se. Also, the reduction
in risk of all-cause mortality could be driven by other factors such as
reduction in sudden cardiac death or cancer-related mortality.23
Among the stable atherosclerosis, there was no strong evidence
that aspirin was beneficial, except in a sensitivity analysis (propen-
sity-adjusted model with the time-varying use of aspirin). On sub-
group analysis, there was suggestion of lack of benefit for aspirin
among those with no coronary revascularization versus prior coro-
nary revascularization.
A meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials of individuals with stable
CAD concluded that low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of adverse car-
diovascular events and all-cause mortality.24 However, in that meta-
analysis, only 1 of the included trials actually examined the benefits
of aspirin in patients similar to our stable atherosclerosis but no prior
ischemic event cohort. The remainder of the trials in that analysis
enrolled patients with a prior ischemic event. Although the Swedish
Angina Pectoris Aspirin Trial and an analysis of the Physicians’ Health
Study demonstrated that aspirin reduced the risk of MI in patients
with chronic stable angina, patients enrolled in these trials were not
on contemporary medical therapy (eg, statins).25,26 An observational
analysis of the more contemporary INVEST: INternational VErapamil
SR/Trandolapril STudy demonstrated that aspirin use among hyper-
tension patients with CAD, but no ischemic event, was not associated
with fewer adverse events.7 A previous analysis of the REACH regis-
try had indicated that stable patients with previous MI did not benefit

 from β-blocker use,27 which had been the recommendation for dec-
ades in patients with prior MI.28 The present analysis using data from
the REACH registry further evolves our understanding of aspirin in
atherosclerosis patients.
4.1
| Limitations
It is possible that the lack of benefit of aspirin therapy among the
atherosclerosis, but no prior ischemic event, group reflects insuffi-
cient power to detect a difference in outcomes. However, with the
current conditions (HR: 0.90, and event rate of 16.1% in the control
group), we estimated from survival analysis that 1112 patients would
be needed in each group to achieve 80% power for the primary out-
come.27 Because 1782 patients were propensity matched in each
group, there should have been sufficient power to detect a difference
between treatment groups. Outcomes in REACH were not adjudi-
cated, although that is not unusual in registries.8 Moreover, lack of
adjudication is unlikely to impact hard outcomes such as all-cause
mortality, but may have led to under-reporting of MI. Among aspirin
users, the majority used a dose <325 mg; however, higher doses have
not been shown to offer further ischemic benefit.29 In addition, the
total number of major bleeding events was small, which limited our
ability to make firm conclusions on this outcome. Although propen-
sity score matching was employed and use of aspirin was introduced
as a time-varying covariate in the model, other unmeasured confoun-
ders cannot be entirely excluded.

CONCLUSION
In this observational analysis of outpatients with stable atherosclero-
sis, the use of aspirin was marginally beneficial only among athero-
sclerosis patients with a prior ischemic event. Future studies are
needed before concluding that aspirin could be omitted among ather-
osclerosis patients with no coronary revascularization.
