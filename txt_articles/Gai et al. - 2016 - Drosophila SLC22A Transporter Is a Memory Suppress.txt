Gai et al. demonstrate that RNAi
knockdown of the plasma membrane
transporter, SLC22A, enhances olfactory
memory. The gene is therefore a memory
suppressor gene, functioning to limit
cholinergic transmission between
antennal lobe projection neurons and the

SUMMARY
The mechanisms that constrain memory formation
are of special interest because they provide insights
into the brain’s memory management systems and
potential avenues for correcting cognitive disorders.
RNAi knockdown in the Drosophila mushroom body
neurons (MBn) of a newly discovered memory sup-
pressor gene, Solute Carrier DmSLC22A, a member
of the organic cation transporter family, enhances
olfactory memory expression, while overexpression
inhibits it. The protein localizes to the dendrites of
the MBn, surrounding the presynaptic terminals of
cholinergic afferent fibers from projection neurons
(Pn). Cell-based expression assays show that this
plasma membrane protein transports cholinergic
compounds with the highest affinity among several
in vitro substrates. Feeding flies choline or inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase in Pn enhances memory, an
effect blocked by overexpression of the transporter
in the MBn. The data argue that DmSLC22A is a
memory suppressor protein that limits memory for-
mation by helping to terminate cholinergic neuro-
transmission at the Pn:MBn synapse.
INTRODUCTION
Genetic studies have now identified hundreds of genes required
for normal memory formation. Some of these genes regulate the
development of the cells and circuits required for learning; some
mediate the physiological changes that occur with acquisition
and storage (Murakami, 2007; Havekes and Abel, 2009; Ardiel
and Rankin, 2010; Tomchik and Davis, 2013; Walkinshaw
et al., 2015). Of particular interest are gene functions that sup-
press normal memory formation and, by analogy with tumor sup-
pressor genes, are referred to as memory suppressor genes
(Abel et al., 1998). These genes and their products can, in princi-
ple, suppress memory formation by antagonizing the process of
acquisition, limiting memory consolidation, promoting active
forgetting, or inhibiting retrieval. Recently, we completed a large
RNAi screen of �3,500 Drosophila genes and identified several
dozen new memory suppressor genes (Walkinshaw et al.,
2015), identified as such, because RNAi knockdown pro-
duces an enhancement in memory performance after olfactory
conditioning.
Aversive olfactory classical conditioning is a well-studied type
of learning in Drosophila and consists of learning a contingency
between an odor conditioned stimulus (CS) and most often an
unconditioned stimulus (US) of electric shock. Many cell types
in the olfactory nervous system are engaged in this type of
learning (Tomchik and Davis, 2013; Guven-Ozkan and Davis,
2014), including antennal lobe projection neurons (Pn), several
different types of mushroom body neurons (MBn), dopamine
neurons (DAn), and others, but a focused model of olfactory
memory formation holds that MBn are integrators of CS and
US information with the CS being conveyed to the MBn dendrites
by the axons of cholinergic, excitatory Pn of the antennal lobe,
and the US conveyed to the MBn by DAn (Davis, 1993; Tomchik
and Davis, 2013; Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014).
A memory suppressor gene that we identified and describe in
this report encodes a member of the SLC22A transporter family.
The Solute Carrier (SLC) family of transporters in humans con-
sists of 395 different, membrane-spanning transporters that
have been organized into 52 different families (Lin et al., 2015).
Some of these are localized pre-synaptically and involved in
neurotransmitter recycling, others localize to glia for clearance
of neurotransmitter from the synapse. In addition, glutamate
transporters can be localized post-synaptically to regulate
neurotransmission strength via clearance mechanisms (Vanden-
berg and Ryan, 2013). Some of these SLC transporters have
prominent roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders and
in drug design, including SLC1A family members that are
responsible for glutamate uptake and clearance of this neuro-
transmitter from the synaptic cleft and SLC6A2-4 proteins that
transport monoamines into cells (Blakely and Edwards, 2012).
Inhibitors of these proteins, which include the serotonin-specific
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reup-
take inhibitors (SNRIs), increase monoamine dwell time at the
synapse and are used to treat depression and several other
neuropsychiatric disorders (Lin et al., 2015).
The SLC22A family of transporters is distinguished into
two major classes that carry either organic cations (SLC22A1-5,
15, 16, and 21) or anions (SLC22A6-13 and 20) across the plasma
membrane, with generally low substrate binding affinity and high
capacity (Sturm et al., 2007; Koepsell, 2013b). They transport

(A) RNAi-1 targeting gene CG7442 was tested along with the corresponding genetic control line (gal4/60100) for effects on 3 hr olfactory memory (PI, per-
formance index) using a battery of gal4 drivers; N-syb-gal4 (pan-neuronal), 238Y-gal4 (all MBn), OK107-gal4 (all MBn), R13F02-gal4 (all MBn), c772-gal4 (all
MBn), VT64246-gal4 (DPMn), GH146-gal4 (Pn), MZ604-gal4 (CCn), NP2492-gal4 (MB-V2n), TH-gal4 (DAn), repo-gal4 (pan glia), and Nrv2-gal4 (cortex and
subperineurial glia).
(B) Memory enhancement with 238Y-gal4 occurred only in bigenic flies containing the gal4 and RNAi-1 transgenes.
(C) Memory expression was enhanced using two other RNAi transgenes directed against CG7442, RNAi-2, and RNAi-3, confirming that the phenotype is due to
CG7442 knockdown.

 numerous molecules with diverse structures (Koepsell and
Endou, 2004; Koepsell, 2013a), including drugs, acetylcholine,
dopamine, histamine, serotonin, and glycine among others
(Koepsell, 2013b). Ergothioneine has been identified as a high-af-
finitysubstrateforSLC22A4 andspermidinefor SLC22A16(Naka-
mura et al., 2008; Aouida et al., 2010). Mice mutant in the two
organic cation transporters, SLC22A2 and SLC22A3, exhibit
behavioral phenotypes suggestive of functions in anxiety, stress,
and depression (Courousse
´ and Gautron, 2015). These observa-
tions point out the importance of the SLC22A family for brain
function and cognition. Recently, a Drosophila SLC22A family
member, CarT (CG9317) was identified and found to transport
carcinine into photoreceptor neurons for the recovery of essential
visual neurotransmitter histamine (Stenesen et al., 2015).
Here we show that the Drosophila gene, CG7442, functions
as a memory suppressor gene and is a member of the SLC22A
family. This transporter is expressed most abundantly in the den-
drites of the MBn, at the synapses with the cholinergic antennal
lobe Pn. Cell-based expression assays show that Drosophila
SLC22A transports choline and acetylcholine with the highest
affinity among several substrates. Pharmacological and genetic
data support the model that Drosophila SLC22A functions at
the Pn:MBn synapse to terminate cholinergic neurotrans-
mission, differing from well-characterized presynaptic choline
transporters for neurotransmitter recycling, and mechanistically
explaining its role in behavioral memory suppression.
RESULTS
Drosophila CG7442 Is a Memory Suppressor Gene
Functioning in MBn and DAn
One of the memory suppressor genes identified in the afore-
mentioned RNAi screen is Drosophila CG7442 (Walkinshaw
et al., 2015). Flies expressing CG7442 RNAi-1 (RNAi-1 = line
106555) throughout the nervous system using the pan-neuronal
driver Nsyb-gal4 displayed significant memory enhancement
compared to control genotypes (Figure 1A). We found that strong
and broad knockdown of CG7442 using tubulin-gal4 was lethal
and therefore focused on tissue-specific, RNAi knockdown
approaches to provide the desired loss of function condition.
We employed a panel of gal4 lines with cell-type- or region-
specific expression in the brain to map the memory suppressor
function of CG7442. Bigenic progeny, each group containing a
gal4 driver along with CG7442 RNAi-1, were trained with odor
paired with electric shock and tested for memory at 3 hr after
conditioning. Each bigenic group was compared to its gal4 con-
trol made heterozygous with the RNAi-1 parental line (60100).
The 60100 line used for docking RNAi-based transgenes con-
tains a P{attP,y+,w30}VIE-260B insertion at a site selected based
on its low level of basal expression and consistent high level of
gal4-dependent expression across a range of tissues (http://
flybase.org/reports/FBrf0208510.html). Thus, the 60100 geno-
type mated with the relevant gal4 line offers an excellent control
for pairwise comparison with flies expressing RNAis from the
docking site.
Memory of the conditioned aversive event was enhanced with
CG7442 knockdown using multiple drivers that specifically
express in the MBn or in DAn (Figure 1A). Memory remained un-
altered relative to the control when the RNAi was expressed in
DPMn, antennal lobe Pn, neurons of the central complex
(CCn), MB-V2 neurons (MB-V2n), or glial cells (Figure 1A). We
reproduced the memory enhancement with MBn knockdown in
multiple independent experiments and confirmed that memory
enhancement required both gal4 and RNAi transgenes (Fig-
ure 1B). We also employed other RNAi transgenes (RNAi-2 and
RNAi-3) targeting different sequences of the CG7442 mRNA to
ensure that the effects of RNAi-1 were specific to the CG7442
gene product. These two additional RNAis produced memory
enhancement when driven with MBn or DAn gal4 drivers (Fig-
ure 1C). Moreover, we expressed CG7442 RNAi-1 in three major
types of MBn, a/b, a’/b’, and g, which revealed that the memory
suppressor function maps to both a/b and a’/b’ MBn (Figure 1D).
Tests for sensory perception of odors and shock failed to show
any significant difference between the control and experimental
genotypes (Table S1). We conclude from these experiments that
knockdown of CG7442 specifically in the a/b and a’/b’ MBn, or
DAn, enhances olfactory memory expression when tested 3 hr
after conditioning.
We verified the effect of RNAi-induced knockdown of expres-
sion by both quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot-
ting using a polyclonal antibody raised in guinea pigs against
the CG7442 protein product. Our qRT-PCR experiments showed
that pan-neuronal expression of CG7442 RNAi-1 reduced mRNA
levels to about 40% of the control (Figure 1E). Western blotting
identified a strongly reacting protein with a mass of �50 kDa
that was reduced to a level of �75% of the control with pan-
neuronal RNAi-1 expression (Figure 1F). These results confirm
at the molecular level the expected reduction of CG7442 gene
product with RNAi-1 expression.
Drosophila CG7442 Overexpression Impairs Memory
We generated UAS-CG7442 lines using the complete protein
coding sequence to measure the effects of overexpression
on olfactory memory. Two of these lines, #10 and #13, were
(D) Memory expression was enhanced in flies expressing CG7442-RNAi-1 in the a’/b’ (c305a-gal4) and a/b (R28H05-gal4) MBn, but not in the g MBn (1471-gal4).
Statistics for (A), (C), and (D): results are plotted as means ± SEM. Comparisons between each experimental group and its corresponding control group was
performed using Student’s t test. n = 6–8 for each group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Statistics for (B): results are plotted as the mean ± SEM. One-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons with ***p < 0.001. n = 8 for each group.
(E) Total RNA, extracted from the heads of control (N-syb > 60100) and N-syb-driven CG7442 knockdown flies was used for qRT-PCR experiments. An �60%
reduction of CG7442 mRNA was measured in the knockdown flies. Triplicate measurements were performed on each of three biological replicates. Statistics:
results are plotted as the normalized mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t test with **p < 0.01.
(F) Representative western blots of head lysates probed with polyclonal antisera against CG7442. Quantification of the immunoreactivity from both control and

loading control. The CG7442 band intensity was compared to that for GAPDH and then the control normalized to 1.0. Statistics: results are plotted as the
normalized mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t test with **p < 0.01.

 molecularly characterized for changes of CG7442 at the
mRNA and protein levels. We measured an �4- and 10-fold
elevation in mRNA, respectively, for UAS-CG7442-10 and
UAS-CG7442-13 overexpression when driven by N-syb-gal4
(Figure 2A). Using the anti-CG7442 antibody, we measured
an increase in protein expression from N-syb-gal4 > UAS-
CG7442-13 flies at a remarkable and unexpected 40-fold over
the control (Figure 2B). Overexpressing CG7442 with two
different MBn drivers produced a significant decrease in 3 hr
memory (Figure 2C), without altering avoidance of odors or
shock used during conditioning (Table S1). Combining the mem-
ory-enhancing effect of CG7442 RNAi expression with the mem-
ory-inhibiting effect of CG7442 overexpression produced a
mutual suppression of the opposing phenotypes (Figure 2D).
These results indicate that olfactory memory expression is
controlled bidirectionally by the levels of CG7442 protein in the
MBn.
CG7442 Is a Drosophila Organic Cation Transporter of
the SLC22A Family
Drosophila CG7442 is classed as a member of the SLC22A fam-
ily due to its high homology throughout its amino acid sequence
to mammalian SLC22A members and phylogenetic analyses
(Figures S1 and S2). The closest human relatives based on pair-
wise comparisons include SLC22A1-3 with �30% amino acid
sequence identity and �50% sequence similarity, but strong
similarity was also found with SLC22A4, 5, 15, and 16. Mamma-
lian SLC22A1-5 and A16 have been characterized as organic
cation transporters (OCT); Drosophila CG7442 is more distantly
related to the SLC22A family members that transport organic an-
ions (OAT), including SLCA6-13 (Figure S2). These observations
suggest that organic cations rather than anions may be the
favorable substrates for Drosophila CG7442. Signature amino
acid motifs of mammalian SLC22A proteins are conserved in
CG7442, including the 12 predicted transmembrane domains
(TM), an extracellular loop between TM1-2 of �100 amino acids,
a large intracellular loop of �70 amino acids encoded by se-
quences between TM6-7, the ASF (amphiphilic solute facilitator)
motif at residues (146–161), and the MFS (major facilitator super-
family) motif connecting TM2 and TM3 (Burckhardt and Wolff,
2000). Other characteristic sequences of SLC22A proteins
include the LPESVRWLL motif at residues 296–304 and the
SEIYPTNLRN motif at residues 471–480 (Figure S1). Four out
of six cysteine residues residing in the large extracellular loop
required for oligomerization through disulfide bond forma-
tion and proper membrane targeting were also conserved in
CG7442 (Figure S1; Keller et al., 2011). Furthermore, five
different amino acids within TM4 of the rat SLC22A1 are required
for transport of the general substrates, tetraethylammonium
(TEA) and methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+; Popp et al.,

 2005); mutating any of these five amino acids abolishes trans-
port activity. Three of these are conserved in the Drosophila
CG7442 sequence (S227 [rS214], E240 [rE227], and V242
[rV229]), and the two others contain neutral amino acid substitu-
tions (T233 [S/T] and I237 [L/I]). Overall, sequence homology
and functional motifs identified Drosophila CG7442 as a SLC22A
family member that likely transports organic cations. Therefore,
CG7442 will be referred to as DmSLC22A throughout the
remainder of this report.
DmSLC22A Is Expressed in the MB Calyx
We studied the spatial expression pattern of DmSLC22A by
immunohistochemistry using an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-
body. Marked expression was observed in a few specific brain
regions, including the antennal lobe, the protocerebral bridge,

and the MB calyx, along with the large fi-
bers of the median bundle and optic tract
(Figures 3A–3B0). Although we observed
pronounced staining within the calyx of
the MB (Figures 3A and 3B), there was
an unexpected lack of immunoreactivity
within the MB lobe neuropil (Figures 3A0,
3B0, and 3C–3C00).
The
expression
pattern
within
the
calyx as revealed by both confocal and
super-resolution microscopy using two
independent antibodies was especially
unique
and
interesting.
The
staining
occurred within distinct fibers, generally
enveloping the calyx, although some fi-
bers were observed to run through the
central region of the calyx (Figures 3D–
3D00 and S3F–S3H). One interpretation
for this pattern is that DmSLC22A is
expressed in the MB cell bodies and
trafficked specifically to their dendrites
for function. High-resolution images of the calyx border (Figures
3E–3E00) showed that DmSLC22A immunoreactivity opposed
the anti-Brpnc82 puncta, a presynaptic marker, and often sur-
rounded it. These puncta probably define in large part the pre-
synaptic terminals from antennal lobe Pn.
To test the possibility that the anti-DmSLC22A staining in the
calyx represents mushroom body dendritic terminals, we quan-
tified the immunoreactive signal in both control flies and flies
with MB-targeted knockdown and overexpression, using the
signal observed in the optic lobes to normalize the measure-
ments (Figures 4A–4C). We measured an �50% and 30%
reduction in DmSLC22A immunoreactivity in 238Y-gal4 >
CG7742-RNAi-1 and R13F02-gal4 > CG7742-RNAi-1 flies,
respectively (Figure 4C). We performed the same immunohisto-
chemical quantitation for flies overexpressing DmSLC22A and

 measured a 2.5-fold increase in calyx expression (Figures
4D–4F).
We noticed in our analysis of the expression in the calyx that
the DmSLC22A signal was reminiscent of a glial pattern (Doherty
et al., 2009). To test an alternative possibility that DmSLC22A
is expressed primarily in glia, we performed immunohistochem-
istry using anti-DmSLC22A antibody on flies expressing GFP
in all-glia, cortex-glia, ensheathing-glia, and in astrocytes. We
failed to observe significant signal overlap of DmSLC22A immu-
noreactivity in the calyx with the GFP signal representing these
glia (Figure S3), providing no support for the hypothesis that
the primary expression site of DmSLC22A is in MB-associated
glia. This observation is consistent with the failure to detect a
behavioral function for DmSLC22A in glia (Figure 1A). We did
observe a dense, crescent-shaped region of immunoreactivity
in the optic lobe that largely co-localized with the repo-GFP
signal, a pan-glial marker (Figure S3D), suggesting a potential
glial localization and function of DmSLC22A for visual process-
ing. One homolog of DmSLC22A, mouse OCT3, is expressed
in the sub-retinal space for the clearance of histamine (Rajan
et al., 2000). Histamine is also the major insect neurotransmitter
utilized by photoreceptor cells.
In agreement with the functional requirement for DmSLC22A in
the a/b and a’/b’ MBn, we observed that the anti-DmSLC22A
immunoreactive signal was co-localized with GFP reporters for
the a’/b’ and a/b MBn (Figure S4). There was only slight overlap
with GFP signal representing g MBn. Therefore, we conclude
that the primary loci of expression and function are the a’/b’
and a/b MBn.
The DmSLC22A Memory Suppressor Function Occurs
from Adult Expression
We utilized the TARGET (GAL80ts) system to control RNAi
expression across time to determine whether the DmSLC22A
memory suppression is a consequence of developmental or
adult expression. Flies carrying tub-gal80ts, 238Y-gal4, and
either CG7442-RNAi-1 or UAS-CG7442-13, were shifted be-
tween 18�C and 30�C to repress or derepress GAL4 activity,
respectively. When the flies containing the RNAi construct
were kept at 30�C across development and into adulthood,
enhanced memory expression was observed (Figure 5A). This
was also observed when GAL80ts activity was derepressed
only during adulthood. Similarly, an impaired memory phenotype
was observed when DmSLC22A was overexpressed only during
adulthood (Figure 5B). There was no consequence of expressing
the RNAi or the cDNA during developmental periods. These ex-
periments definitively show that knockdown or overexpression
produces memory phenotypes due to expression in the adult
organism.
DmSLC22A Regulates Both Memory Acquisition and
Retention
Next, we asked whether the memory suppression phenotype
was produced by altering memory acquisition or retention. Flies
were trained with odor and a varying number of shock pulses and
immediately tested after the last shock pulse in order to probe
the rate of memory acquisition. Surprisingly, although the control
genotype reached an asymptotic performance index after only
three-shock training, the DmSLC22A knockdown flies required
seven-shock training to reach this value. In other words, these
data suggest that the rate of learning is impaired in the knock-
down flies (Figure 5C). We observed this same acquisition
impairment when DmSLC22A was inhibited using a second
MBn driver, R13F02-gal4, and an a’/b’ MBn-specific driver,
c305-gal4 (Figure S5A). With 7–12 shock pulses during training,
both control and experimental genotypes reach ceiling levels of
performance (Figure 5C).
We tested memory retention after 12-shock training to mea-
sure the rate of memory decay. As illustrated in Figure 5D, the
memory retention curves for control and experimental genotypes
are parallel and qualitatively similar, but quantitatively dissimilar,
with the DmSLC22A knockdown flies exhibiting enhanced per-
formance at 1, 3, and 9 hr after conditioning. This enhancement
was striking, approximating a doubling in performance at 9 hr.
Memory performance a few hours after conditioning is experi-
mentally separable into two major components: a component
that can be disrupted with cold shock and a component that
is resistant to this insult. We measured the cold-shock-sensitive
and -resistant components by imposing a brief cold shock
treatment at 1.5 hr after conditioning and testing performance
at 3 hr. As expected, the DmSLC22A knockdown flies exhibited
enhanced performance without cold shock compared to the con-
trol (Figure S5B). They also showed enhanced performance after
cold shock, indicating that the knockdown enhanced both cold-
shock-sensitive and -resistant forms. Thus, although impaired in
the rate of acquisition compared to the control genotype (Fig-
ure 5C), training the DmSLC22A knockdown flies to ceiling levels
of performance produces a more persistent memory consisting
of both cold-shock-resistant and -sensitive components (Figures
5D and S5B). Putting this conclusion back into the context of the
normal fly, DmSLC22A expression in the MBn speeds acquisition
and suppresses the strength of memory produced, judged by
the elevated and more persistent memory in the knockdown flies
produced by conditioning to ceiling levels of performance (Fig-
ures 5D and 5F).
An alternative possibility is that the memory traces formed dur-
ing acquisition in the knockdown flies become similar in strength
to control flies, but DmSLC22A functions in post-acquisition pro-
cesses of memory stability or expression. We probed this alter-
native hypothesis by measuring the rate of memory decay after
normalizing the initial performance of control and experimental
flies using reduced training intensity for the experimental flies.
The results of this experiment show that the memory decay
rate is identical between the two groups after this normalization
(Figure 5E). We also performed a series of memory interference
assays to probe deeper into the alternatives, predicting that
stronger memory traces instilled during acquisition would
enhance proactive interference and diminish retroactive interfer-
ence. Proactive interference produced by learning a contingency
between odor pairs C/D and electric shock immediately prior
to learning an A/B contingency impaired A/B memory in control
animals tested immediately afterward by about 30% (Figure 5G).
In contrast, the magnitude of this interference was greater than
45% in the DmSLC22A knockdown group, showing that proac-
tive interference produced by the memory of the C/D contin-
gency is more robust in this group. It should be noted that this

 effect is rapid; proactive interference inhibits new acquisition
within minutes afterward. This observation lends support to
the conclusion that memory traces formed at acquisition in
DmSLC22A knockdown animals are stronger than in controls.
Consistent with this conclusion, retroactive interference pro-
duced by learning a C/D odor contingency after A/B was less
robust in the knockdown group than in the control group (Fig-
ure 5H), consistent with the existence of a stronger A/B memory
trace. These results strongly support the conclusion that
DmSLC22A knockdown instills a stronger memory trace during
acquisition (Figure 5F).
Yet another explanation for the elevated memory in the
DmSLC22A knockdown flies is that they may be impaired in
active forgetting (Shuai et al., 2010; Berry et al., 2012). A good
way to test the forgetting hypothesis is to employ transgenes
that express variants of the small GTPase Rac, since constitu-
tively active Rac causes forgetting and dominant-negative Rac
inhibits it (Shuai et al., 2010). Flies were constructed to contain
both the DmSLC22A RNAi transgene that enhances memory
expression, and a Racv12-expressing transgene that promotes
forgetting (Shuai et al., 2010). The memory performance of the
genotype was intermediate between the RNAi-expressing flies
and the Racv12-expressing flies (Figure S5C). Thus, expression
of Racv12 is not epistatic to the effects of DmSLC22A RNAi,
nor is DmSLC22A RNAi expression epistatic to Racv12. This indi-
cates that DmSLC22A knockdown functions in a pathway other
than the forgetting pathway defined by Rac, producing an addi-
tive phenotype.
Cholinergic Compounds Are the Preferred Substrate for
DmSLC22A
We prepared a stable HEK293 cell line with DmSLC22A expres-
sion inducible with doxycycline to identify substrates potentially
transported by this protein. We observed strong, doxycycline-
dependent expression of DmSLC22A as assayed by western
blotting and immunohistochemistry compared to cells without
doxycycline (Figures S6A and S6B). DmSLC22A was properly
targeted to the plasma membrane and concentrated in focal
adhesions.
We then utilized the doxycycline-induced cells expressing
DmSLC22A to survey potential substrates for this transporter.
The battery of compounds that we tested included com-
pounds previously identified as substrates for mammalian
OCTs, including serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, histamine,
acetylcholine, choline, betaine, and the general substrates for
these transporters, MPP and TEA (Koepsell, 2013b). Known sub-
strates for OCT6 and mOCTN1-2, spermidine and L-carnitine,
were included in the assays. We also considered known neuro-
transmitters used for communication with MBn, which include
acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine (Pech
et al., 2013). We assayed each substrate using both induced
and un-induced cells in order to measure the transport activity
above that from endogenous transporters in HEK293 cells.
Our results reveal that 9 of the 11 compounds tested can serve
as substrates for DmSLC22A expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig-
ure 6). Those compounds that failed as substrates included
octopamine and spermidine (Figure S7). The other nine com-
pounds tested exhibited significant substrate activity, but three
of the compounds showed an interesting uptake profile in which
the transport activity of un-induced cells at later assay times
exceeded that of the induced cells. These included TEA, betaine,
and L-carnitine. This unexpected observation must be due to the
DmSLC22A transporter interfering in some way with the trans-
porters endogenously expressed by HEK293 cells, or by confer-
ring bidirectional transport of substrates (Koepsell, 2013b).
Of particular interest were the cholinergic compounds and
dopamine, since these specific substrates exhibited continu-
ously increased transport in induced versus un-induced cells
(Figure 6J).
We confirmed the substrate specificity of DmSLC22A using
dissociated neurons from the adult fly brain for the assays, em-
ploying control neurons (N-syb-gal4>+), neurons overexpressing
DmSLC22A (N-syb-gal4 > CG7442), and neurons expressing
the DmSLC22A RNAi transgene (N-syb-gal4 > CG7442-RNAi)
(Figure S8). Our results indicate that DmSLC22A in Drosophila
neurons transports MPP, TEA, choline, acetylcholine, betaine,
histamine, and dopamine but not spermidine, serotonin, octop-
amine, or carnitine. There was excellent correspondence in the
results using knockdown versus overexpressing neurons.
We varied the substrate concentration across a range of about
an order of magnitude (Figure 6K) in assays within their linear
phase using both HEK293 cells and adult Drosophila neurons
in order to determine the relative Km and Vmax for each substrate
(Table S2). Our results show that choline and acetylcholine are
transported with low mM Km values, while dopamine was trans-
ported with a Km of �10 mM. The combined results indicate
that choline and acetylcholine are the preferred substrates
based on Km and on transport efficiency (Vmax/Km).
DmSLC22A Modulates Memory Strength by Regulating
Cholinergic Neurotransmission in the MB Calyx
The identification of substrates for DmSLC22A prompted us
to test the biological role for three neurotransmitters—acetyl-
choline, dopamine, and histamine—in memory expression. We
began by feeding flies precursors to these neurotransmitters
and measuring memory, after feeding, in control, knockdown,
and flies overexpressing the transporter in the MBn. We pre-
dicted that increasing the levels of the primary neurotransmitter
(F) Schematic diagram of acquisition rate and memory retention for control (gray) and DmSLC22A knockdown (black) flies, showing that the rate of acquisition is
slowed in the knockdown flies but that the strength of memory produced during ‘‘saturation’’ training exceeds the control as well as the ceiling level of behavioral
performance.

conditioning event. Statistics for (G) and (H): results are plotted as the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons with *p < 0.05,

 substrate used in vivo for regulating memory via DmSLC22A
through dietary supplementation would improve memory in con-
trol flies, and knockdown of the transporter would phenocopy
these behavioral gains. In addition, we predicted that overex-
pression of the transporter would limit behavioral memory in
control flies and that this could be partially reversed by
increasing the levels of the relevant neurotransmitter through
dietary supplementation. These predictions were made based
on a synaptic model for the transporter effects: reducing the
DmSLC22A transporter at the synapse would allow its cognate
neurotransmitter to have more persistent and stronger effects,
while overexpressing the transporter would limit the magnitude
and duration of the cognate neurotransmitter’s actions. Dietary
supplementation would provide for increased levels of neuro-
transmitter released at the relevant synapses.
Flies were starved overnight and fed with neurotransmitter
precursors for 12 hr followed by conditioning and memory
testing (Figures 7A–7C). Supplementing food with L-Dopa or his-
tidine impaired memory in control flies. The behavioral gains due
to supplementing the DmSLC22A knockdown flies with these
precursors were quantitatively similar to those observed using
control flies, consistent with the conclusion that precursor sup-
plementation produces behavioral effects through pathways in-
dependent of DmSLC22A. In contrast, choline supplementation
improved behavioral performance in control flies. DmSLC22A
knockdown in choline-supplemented flies produced levels of
performance similar to those with the DmSLC22A knockdown
only, possibly due to saturating the acetylcholine receptor from
nutritional supplementation alone. These results are compatible
only with the model that DmSLC22A knockdown improves mem-
ory by choline/acetylcholine transport. Moreover, overexpres-
sion of DmSLC22A in the MBn impaired memory, and dietary
supplementation with choline partially reversed this impairment
(Figure 7D). Dietary supplementation of L-dopa or histidine to
overexpressing flies produced further impairment in memory
beyond the effects of the DmSLC22A transgene expression itself
(Figures 7E and 7F).
Four observations led to the specific hypothesis that altered
acetylcholine neurotransmission at the Pn:MBn synapse might
underlie the memory gains observed in the DmSLC22A knock-
down flies (Figure 8A). (1) Knockdown of DmSLC22A in the MBn
produced the enhanced memory phenotype. (2) DmSLC22A is
preferentially expressed in the dendrites of the MBn. (3) Dietary
supplementation experiments described above fingered cholin-
ergic transmission as the probable variable underlying memory
suppression. (4) The neurons presynaptic to MBn (Pn) are known
to be cholinergic in their nature (Yasuyama et al., 2002; Gu and
O’Dowd, 2006).
We challenged this hypothesis by testing two strong predic-
tions that follow from the model. First, increasing/decreasing
the abundance of DmSLC22A in the MBn should produce
an inverse response in calcium influx in the MBn dendrites
when flies are presented with odor stimulation. This is the
consequence of increasing or decreasing the neurotransmitter

 persistence at the synapse by facilitating or reducing its
transport from the synapse. Second, reducing the enzymatic
pathway for terminating the acetylcholine signal at the Pn:MBn
synapse by reducing acetylcholinesterase synthesized and
released synaptically by the Pn should enhance memory
expression in ways similar to DmSLC22A knockdown in the
MBn. In addition, this enhanced memory expression should
be suppressed by increasing the transporter-mediated termi-
nation of the signal, obtained by overexpressing SLC22A in
the MBn.

Figure 8. DmSLC22A Regulates Cholinergic Neurotransmission at the Pn:MBn Synapse for Memory Suppression
(A) Model for the role of DmSLC22A at the Pn:MBn cholinergic synapse. Acetylcholine (ACh) released from Pn in response to odor presentation activates its
postsynaptic partner, the MBn, through excitatory acetylcholine receptors (AChR). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the synapse provides one pathway that
terminates synaptic transmission by hydrolyzing acetylcholine. DmSLC22A provides a second pathway by transporting the released acetylcholine and choline
into the MBn. Knocking down the expression of the transporter at the synapse leads to more persistent actions of ACh and stronger memory traces. Over-
expression of the transporter has the opposite effect, prematurely terminating the actions of ACh leading to impaired memory.

Neuron 90, 581–595, May 4, 2016
 We tested the first prediction by expressing G-CaMP6.0f in the
MBn and measuring the postsynaptic calcium response in their
dendrites by in vivo functional imaging. Compared with the
control group, DmSLC22A knockdown in the MBn produced
an �30% increase in GCaMP6.0f fluorescence when flies were
presented with either octanol or benzyaldehyde (Figures 8B–
8D). In contrast, overexpressing the DmSLC22A transporter in
the MBn produced an �30% decrease in the dendritic calcium
response to odors (Figures 8E–8G). These observations are
congruent with the model that DmSLC22a provides a trans-
port-mediated pathway for terminating cholinergic transmission
at the Pn:MBn synapse.
We then tested the model by genetically manipulating cholin-
ergic transmission specifically at the Pn:MBn synapse and
measuring the effects on memory expression. Expression of an
RNAi transgene to acetylcholinesterase in the Pn to reduce the
enzymatic destruction of ACh at the Pn:MBn synapse using
two different Pn drivers (GH146-gal4 and NP225-gal4) enhanced
3 hr memory performance by 25%–50% (Figures 8H and S5D).
This observation is consistent with the model that increased
ACh levels at that synapse enhances olfactory memory. In
contrast, overexpression of DmSLC22A in the postsynaptic
compartment to increase transport of ACh into MBn impaired
memory expression (Figures 8H, S5D, and 2C). When combined,
these two genetic manipulations were mutually suppressive.
These data, produced by specifically manipulating these pre-
and post-synaptic partners in the fly, provide exceptionally
strong evidence for the model that cholinergic neurotransmis-
sion is terminated by a balance between enzymatic destruction
and transport mechanisms and that the memory suppression
function of DmSLC22A is due to its transport role at the Pn:MBn
synapse (Figure 8A).
DISCUSSION
Our data, provided above, connect the SLC22A family of trans-
porters and memory suppression through the mechanism illus-
trated in Figure 8A. DmSLC22A, located on the dendrites of the
adult a/b and a’/b’ MBn, removes ACh from the Pn:MBn synap-
ses in the calyx. The normal expression level of this plasma mem-
brane transporter limits the transference of olfactory information
to the MBn by removing neurotransmitter from the synapse.
Overexpression of DmSLC22A hardens this limit, weakening
the CS representation and weakening memory formation.
Reducing DmSLC22A expression has the opposite effect of soft-
ening the limit, producing a stronger CS representation and
stronger memory formation. Thus, the data indicate that acetyl-
cholinesterase and postsynaptic SLC22A transporter function
jointly to regulate neurotransmitter persistence at the synapse.
This conclusion is notable, given the longstanding emphasis
on ACh degradation as the primary route for termination of the
cholinergic synaptic signal. Although the evidence is strong for
the proposed mechanism shown in Figure 8A, the transporter
exhibits broad substrate specificity and expression outside of
the Pn:MBn synapse. Alternative or additional mechanisms of
action in memory suppression thus remain a possibility.
The current data are consistent with the model that ACh
persistence at the Pn:MBn synapse is a surrogate for the
strength of the CS and therefore a primary effector of olfactory
memory strength. Other data similarly point to the strength of
stimulation of MBn as an important variable for regulating mem-
ory strength. The MBn also receive inhibitory input through
GABAA receptors expressed on the MBn. Overexpressing the
MBn-expressed GABAA receptor Rdl impairs learning, while
RNAi knockdown of this receptor in the MBn enhances memory
formation (Liu et al., 2007). This regulation of memory strength is
independent of the US pathway involved in classical condition-
ing, functioning similarly for both aversive and appetitive USs
(Liu et al., 2009). However, we note that the in vivo functions
for the SLC22A class of transporters must be broader than the
focused model presented above. For instance, the data indicate
that the Drosophila SLC22A protein transports both acetylcho-
line and dopamine in ex vivo preparations. Moreover, the pro-
tein’s memory suppressor function maps to both MBn and the
DAn. We have not yet explored how DmSLC22A might function
in DAn to suppress memory formation, but one reasonable
hypothesis following the logic in Figure 8 is that DmSLC22A
transports acetylcholine at the synapse between upstream and
putative cholinergic neurons that provide input to the DAn that
convey the US in classical condition. Testing this hypothesis
requires identifying the presynaptic neurons to the DAn that carry
the US information.
One unexplained observation is that although DmSLC22A
knockdown enhances the duration of memory produced from
stronger memory traces instilled at acquisition, it slows the rate
of acquisition as measured by acquisition curves. However,
this observation has been made with another memory suppres-
sor gene as well. A knockdown of the pre- and post-synaptic
scaffolding protein, Scribble, has the same effect of producing
more enduring memories but slowing acquisition (I.C.-S. et al.,
unpublished data). In addition, similar observations have been
made in mouse: injection of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
antagonists impairs memory acquisition but enhances retention
(Easton et al., 2012).
Our studies bring a focus on the SLC22A family of plasma
membrane transporters as potential targets for neurotherapeu-
tics. Of the 24 members of this family, only a few have been
studied in some detail in the nervous system. RNA expression
experiments have shown that SLC22A1–5 are all expressed in
the brain, with SLC22A3 and A4 being the most abundant (Al-
nouti et al., 2006; Cui et al., 2009), and immunohistochemistry
experiments have revealed that SLC22A4–5 are localized at
dendrites within the hippocampus (Lamhonwah et al., 2008).
Mammalian members of this family of transporters and, by
extension, probably DmSLC22A, are subject to regulation by
multiple signaling molecules including protein kinase A, cal-
cium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and the mitogen-
activated protein kinases (Wilde et al., 2009). Knockout mice
for SLC22A2 and A3 show reduced basal level of several neuro-
transmitters in a region-dependent manner (Bacq et al., 2012;
Vialou et al., 2008) and decreased anxiety-related behaviors
(Wultsch et al., 2009; Courousse
´
et al., 2015), although
the

of
SLC22A3

debated (Vialou et al., 2008). In addition, the knockouts or anti-
sense insults reveal behavioral changes in depression-related
tasks, with SLC22A2 knockouts exhibiting increased behavioral

 despair, and SLC22A3 antisense-treated animals exhibiting
decreased behavioral despair (Courousse
´ and Gautron, 2015).
Little is known about the biological or behavioral functions of
the other members of the SLC22A family. Our results now
show that the SLC22A family of transporters is also involved in
memory suppression.
DmSLC22A is a unique and new type of memory suppressor
gene. There are, to date, about two dozen memory suppressor
genes identified in the mouse and about three dozen such genes
in Drosophila (Lee, 2014; Walkinshaw et al., 2015). The mecha-
nisms by which all of these genes suppress memory formation
are not yet known, but a few themes have emerged. For
instance, several of the genes suppress memory formation by
limiting excitatory neurotransmitter release and function, or the
expression and function of post-synaptic receptors. DmSLC22A
appears to fall into this category. Another example is Cdk5,
which negatively influences the expression of NR2B and limits
memory formation. Knockouts of some GABA receptors,
mentioned above, reduce inhibitory tone of learning circuitry so
as to facilitate memory formation. Several of the known memory
suppressor genes are known to function in active forgetting
processes. These include damb, a dopamine receptor involved
in forgetting mechanisms (Berry et al., 2012); scribble, a pre-
and post-synaptic scaffolding gene (I.C.-S. et al., unpublished
data); and rac, a small G protein involved in the biochemistry of
active forgetting (Shuai et al., 2010). Memory suppressor genes
can also encode signaling molecules that negatively regulate
transcription factors required for long-term memory and the
transcription factors themselves, such as repressing isoforms
of Aplysia Creb (ApCreb2; Bartsch et al., 2000); ATF4, a tran-
scription factor homolgous to ApCreb-2 (Chen et al., 2003);
and protein phosphatase I (Genoux et al., 2002; Koshibu et al.,
2011). Elucidating all of the genetic constraints on memory for-
mation and their mechanisms will have profound consequences
for understanding of how the brain forms and stores memories
and for the development of cognitive therapeutics.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Drosophila stocks used in this study are listed in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures. Standard olfactory classical conditioning procedures
were used in this study (Beck et al., 2000; Berry et al., 2012). These tests
employed 2- to 4-day-old flies with odors delivered in an air stream and
electric shock pulses (1.25 s pulses every 5 s at 90 V) via a flexible copper
grid. These procedures are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures. mRNA expression in control and DmSLC22A overexpression and
knockdown flies was measured by qRT-PCR using standard procedures
with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a normaliza-
tion control.
Polyclonal antisera were raised in guinea pigs against an E. coli-expressed
DmSLC22A:GST fusion protein. A mouse monoclonal antibody was prepared
against the peptide sequence (DKLQQSSESRFP) found in the large intracel-
lular loop connecting TM6 and TM7. Western blotting experiments were
performed with the polyclonal antibody using standard procedures. Immuno-
histochemistry employing either the polyclonal or monoclonal anti-DmSLC22A
antibody followed standard protocols except that dissected fly brains were
re-fixed with 80% acetone after the paraformaldehyde fixation.
For transport assays, the open reading frame of CG7442 was cloned into the
expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) and stable transformants
were selected after transfection with this construct and pOG44. Single-cell
colonies were selected by limited dilution for further use. Radiolabeled poten-
tial substrates were incubated with the DmSLC22A-expressing HEK cells and
the transport activity terminated by washing in ice-cold buffer. The cells were
then solubilized and the internalized radioactivity counted. A similar experi-
mental design was used to measure transport activity in Drosophila dissoci-
ated brain cells, except that the assays were performed with cell suspensions
rather than monolayers and the cells pelleted by centrifugation for various
wash steps.
Prism 5.0 was used for statistical analyses, with two-tailed t tests for
comparing two groups, and one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc compar-
ison for comparing multiple groups.
