Possible roles of brain-derived signals in the regulation of embryogenesis are unknown. Here
we use an amputation assay in Xenopus laevis to show that absence of brain alters subsequent
muscle and peripheral nerve patterning during early development. The muscle phenotype can
be rescued by an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The observed defects
occur at considerable distances from the head, suggesting that the brain provides long-range
cues for other tissue systems during development. The presence of brain also protects
embryos from otherwise-teratogenic agents. Overexpression of a hyperpolarization-activated
cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel rescues the muscle phenotype and the neural
mispatterning that occur in brainless embryos, even when expressed far from the muscle or
neural cells that mispattern. We identify a previously undescribed developmental role for the
brain and reveal a non-local input into the control of early morphogenesis that is mediated by
neurotransmitters and ion channel activity.

 T
he brain and central nervous system (CNS) generate
information that controls muscle activity to implement
behavior in adult organisms. However, the CNS may also
provide an instructive influence over the behavior of multiple
cell types during the establishment, repair and maintenance
of complex anatomical patterns in vivo. For example, the
patterning disorder known as cancer has been linked to
neural control1. Tumors are readily induced by denervation in

been
observed
with
sarcomas
implanted
into
normal
or
denervated frog limbs4. Even normal tissue can disorganize in the
absence of neural signaling, as occurs in the papillae of the
mammalian tongue after denervation5. Thus, the presence of
growth control signals between the CNS and target cells has led to
suggestions of the CNS as a potential approach to treat tumor
progression in the clinic6.

 Likewise, pattern regulation during regeneration requires
neural signals. Appendage regeneration has long been known to
be dependent on local neural supply7, although this is apparently
an acquired addiction to developmental presence of innervation8.
Recent studies have implicated roles for neural signaling in bone
regeneration9 and epidermal de-differentiation10. The role of
CNS in regeneration is instructive, not merely permissive.
The polarity and contiguity of the CNS determines head/tail
specification in a number of invertebrate models, including
planaria11, 12. In salamander, the presence of nerve in a non-
native location can induce the formation of ectopic limbs at
wound sites13. Moreover, in the frog model, focal damage to the
spinal cord induces alterations in the specific pattern of tail
regeneration, with distinct morphological changes resulting from
spinal cord interruptions at different locations14. Despite recent
advances15, the molecular connection and reciprocal influence
between nerves and patterning remains poorly understood16,
especially with respect to the ultimate source of neutrally medi-
ated patterning signals.
One of the most interesting contexts for neural pattern control
is embryogenesis, when anatomical structures are first established.
Parasympathetic innervation controls morphogenesis of the
submandibular gland, influencing the branching and general
patterning of the organ17. Muscle cells are also affected by
interactions with nerves18, especially in terms of gene expression
of

approaches to birth defects and bioengineered organs requires
addressing neural inputs into large-scale patterning. However,
possible roles of the brain (or brain-derived signals) for early
patterning, long before behavior begins, remain unknown.
In Xenopus, somitogenesis occurs in an anterior-posterior,
bilaterally symmetric manner. In the clock and wavefront
model20, 21, the presomitic mesodermal cells dynamically oscillate
between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for segmen-
tation (clock) as the embryonic development proceeds from
anterior to posterior direction (wavefront along with tissue
shortening-mediated Doppler effect) resulting in formation of
segmented somites. Wnt, Shh, BMP, Fgf and Notch pathways are
involved in regulating the clock with rhythmic activation of these
pathways conserved across vertebrates. The intersection of
antagonistic gradients of retinoic acid (anterior to posterior) and
Fgf and Wnt (posterior to anterior) determine the wavefront22, 23.
Given the tandem physiology of nerves and muscles, might
innervation help orchestrate the symphony of signals that leads to
somitogenesis? Does the presumptive nervous system release
instructive signals that might be involved in somitogenesis
and muscle development? Is there any element of this process
co-opted into muscle regeneration? Similarly, the peripheral
innervation forms a stereotypic and complex neural network,
which also must be precisely patterned in a way that integrates
size and positional information across the whole body24.
Most of the existing knowledge about neural inputs focuses on
the local microenvironment; very few studies have examined the
contribution of the CNS in providing long-range instructive cues
to muscle or peripheral innervation. To probe the role of distal
neural structures and to search for tissues that could provide
complex nerve-mediated information to downstream patterning
targets, we focused on the brain. Here, we establish a brainless
Xenopus embryonic model to reveal a role for the brain in
the patterning of muscle (somite) and peripheral innervation.
Crucially, we show that defects induced by extirpation of
the brain, or by teratogenic agents in the context of normal
embryogenesis, can be largely rescued in the absence of brain by
the dorsal overexpression of an exogenous ion channel or
exposure to a muscarinic-receptor antagonist. The characteriza-
tion of defects and their repair by global (pharmacological) or
spatially targeted (molecular-genetic) reagents reveal the first
molecular components of the signaling cascade by which the
brain directs complex embryonic patterning processes.
Results
Brain is required for normal muscle development and pat-
terning. To investigate the possible role of brain-derived signals
for muscle morphogenesis and patterning, we established an assay
in Xenopus laevis: brain removal at stage 25 (Fig. 1a, b), perfor-
med at a time when its main subdivisions (forebrain, midbrain
and hindbrain) and the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axis are
already defined25. By removing the brain at the early tailbud stage
(i.e., when somitogenesis is starting), we were able to study
muscle structure development in completely brainless developing
animals ( > 85% of the microsurgeries we performed resulted in
viable animals). To determine whether the brain is required for
the onset and/or patterning of myotomes, we evaluated the
muscle phenotype at two relevant time points, corresponding to
the different myogenic waves (reviewed in ref. 23): early- (stages
30–41; first and second waves completed) and late- (stages 42–48;
third wave completed) stages after brain removal, respectively.
Soon after brain removal (stages 30–41), animals developing
without a brain (BR−) began to display a notable decrease
(−43 ± 7%) in the collagen density of the myotomes, compared to
the control animals (Ctrl) (OD mean value of 64 ± 8 units for
BR− group compared to 113 ± 13 units for Ctrl group; t-test
P < 0.01; n = 79) (Fig. 1c, d, turquoise and magenta short arrows).
Analysis of the muscle structure revealed that the somites
were 25% shorter in BR− than those found in control animals
(101 ± 24 μm vs. 148 ± 13 μm, t-test P < 0.01; n = 75) (Fig. 1c, d,
double-headed arrow indicates the length of one myotome).
Moreover, the spatial organization of the somatic muscle was also

embryos to generate BR− animals. Morphological evaluation of muscle phenotype was performed at early- (stages 30–41) and late- (42–48) stages.

 perturbed. The body axis and mean angle of the muscle fibers
along the anteroposterior axis were significantly altered in BR−,
with a mean of 16 ± 2° more-opened angles compared to Ctrl
ones (t-test P < 0.01 for rostral and caudal levels, Mann–Whitney
test P < 0.01 for central level levels; n = 75) (Fig. 1e and Table 1).
We then asked whether the early defects in muscle patterning
were also present during subsequent development in BR−
embryos. To address this question, we analyzed the number of
somites (indicator of segmentation) and the fine muscle structure
(angle and length of the myotome fibers) at late stages (stages
42–48). No significant differences were detected for the mean
number of somites between Ctrl and BR− embryos (33 ± 3 vs.
32 ± 4; t-test P = 0.74; n = 75), suggesting that the brain was not
functionally implicated in segmentation per se, and that our assay
does not generally (nonspecifically) impair embryogenesis of the
somites. In contrast, the analysis of the fine muscle structure
confirmed that the defects in myotome organization were
not
repaired
during
subsequent
development.
Myotomes
in late-staged BR− embryos were 10% shorter (136 ± 14 μm vs.
160 ± 13 μm, t-test P < 0.01; n = 75) than in control animals.
Likewise, the central axis in the late-stage BR− was significantly
displaced, somites lacked the typical chevron-shape, and a
difference of −9 ± 1° in the mean angle of the myotome fibers
was detected when compared to Ctrl animals (Mann–Whitney
test P < 0.05 for rostral and central levels, t-test P < 0.05 for
caudal level; n = 75) (Fig. 1f–h, overlaid dashed axis and
arrowhead-like lines, and Table 1). Control animals subjected
to sham surgeries where either yolk mass or tailbud was resected
(Yolk− or Tail− embryos, respectively) displayed normal muscle
architecture, indistinguishable from control myotome fibers, both
in terms of length/definition and angle of the central myotomes
(at distance from the initial resection, in the case of Tail− sham-
embryos)
(Supplementary
Fig.
1A–G),
demonstrating
that
surgery per se (and subsequent regenerative responses) do not
induce muscle mispatterning. We conclude from these data that
while the brain is not required for the somite segmentation
(partitioning of the presomitic mesoderm into somites), it has a
key role in both the onset and establishment of correct muscle
patterning and structure.
Muscle organization was adversely affected both at the
microscopic tissue organization level, as well as macroscopically
– at the animal morphological level (incidence of aberrant
phenotype within both Ctrl and BR− population; Table 2). A
macroscopic evaluation of embryo morphology revealed a higher
percentage of abnormal embryos in the BR− population, both at
early (66 ± 6% vs. 13 ± 1%; z-test, P < 0.01) and at later stages
(80 ± 1% vs. 16 ± 2%; z-test P < 0.01) compared to Ctrl animals.
Muscle organization was affected by brain absence rather than
any indirect detrimental effect of tissue removal surgery,
as demonstrated the percent of aberration in Yolk− population
(14 ± 2% and 15 ± 5% at the onset and later in development,
respectively; z-test compared to Ctrl P > 0.05 for both cases;
Supplementary Fig. 1H).
Taken together, these results clearly indicate the importance of
the early embryonic brain for normal development of muscle
structure occurring at considerable distance.
Scopolamine exposure rescues the BR− muscle phenotype. To
characterize the brain-dependent signals that were necessary for
normal muscle development, we first asked if the aberrant BR−
muscle phenotype could be rescued by pharmacological treat-
ment. Neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, are conserved
and ubiquitous mediators of the brain’s electrical activity on other
organs and tissues in the body. We reasoned that similar
mechanisms might be at work before behavior, in the develop-
mental process, as neurotransmitters not only mediate adult
physiological function downstream of bioelectrical events but also
play a developmental role in the patterning and formation of the
synapses that they subserve26. Therefore, we targeted this path-
way to attempt to understand and recapitulate the brain’s role in
embryogenesis. We tested several cholinergic drugs that were
known to target muscarinic (mAChRs) and nicotinic cholinergic
receptors (nAChRs) and are standard tools for altering brain
performance, especially in terms of memory, attention, and
relevant-stimulus processing27.

muscarinic-receptor
antagonist)28
or
carbachol
(a
dual
muscarinic-
and
nicotinic-receptor
agonist)29
(Fig.
2a–h).
When comparing percent of abnormal embryos (macroscopic
phenotype) within BR− and Ctrl populations for each pharma-
cological treatment, we found that the absence of brain leads to
a higher incidence of abnormalities at the onset of the
development, irrespective of the drug used (Fig. 2a and Table 2).
When intergroup analysis is performed, however, significant
differences between scopolamine-treated BR− and untreated
BR− were detected (38 ± 18% vs. 66 ± 8%; z-test P < 0.01),
indicating that scopolamine could have a protective effect on
the overall morphology when the brain is absent. Our analysis at
late stage (Fig. 2b and Table 2) revealed that, while carbachol
treatment increased the incidence of aberration in the BR−
population (reaching almost 100% of embryos with abnormal-
ities), scopolamine treatment abrogated those effects completely.
Consequently,

significant
differences
were
found
between scopolamine-treated BR− and scopolamine-treated Ctrl
(25 ± 9%

differences were observed between scopolamine-treated BR−and

 148 ± 13 μm at early stage and mean lengths of 160 ± 13 μm at
late stage; Fig. 2g, h). Conversely, carbachol treatment in BR− had
dramatic negative consequences for muscle formation and
patterning, which was especially clear at the later stages, deviating
the organization of somites and myotomes from the typical
BR−-induced aberrant muscle phenotype. At early stages, the size
of the myotomes (mean length of 137 ± 11 μm) was similar to
what was measured in the Ctrl embryos. However, later on in
development, a significantly lower number of somites (24 ± 4; P
< 0.01 after post-hoc Bonferroni’s test), longer myotome fibers
(196 ± 35 μm; P < 0.01 after post-hoc Dunn’s test), and complete
asymmetric and disorganized muscle patterning were observed in
the carbachol-treated BR−(magenta and yellow arrows in Fig. 2f).
Taken together, we conclude that the brain may inhibit the
muscarinic pathway to achieve correct organization of the
somatic muscle system and that the absence or prevention of
muscarinic signaling (for example, the pharmacological antagon-
ism mediated by scopolamine) is able to rescue the aberrant BR−
muscle phenotype.
We next sought to determine when during muscle develop-
ment the rescue effect of scopolamine occurs. BR− embryos were
exposed to scopolamine for different lengths of time (Fig. 2i left,
for a schematic representation of drug-exposure timing). We
observed that scopolamine treatment is able to fix the BR− muscle
phenotype if the drug exposure starts immediately after the brain
removal (Fig. 2i, right), regardless of whether BR− are treated for
one (first-week experimental group) or 2 weeks (first- and
second-week experimental group). In either case, treatment was
able to significantly decrease the percentage of abnormal tadpoles
(51 ± 13% and 55 ± 7%, respectively; z-test P < 0.01 for both
groups) when compared to the BR− population that had not been
exposed to drug (87 ± 11% of abnormalities). Our results indicate
that scopolamine acts on events during the first week (from stages
25 to 37) after brain removal.
Ectopic HCN2 expression rescues BR− muscle phenotype.
Considering the many examples of muscle formation and
patterning mediated by bioelectrical signaling in both mammals30
and amphibians31, as well as the ability of some channels
to
rescue
profound
embryonic
defects32,
we
wondered
whether the exogenous expression of a specific ion channel,
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel 2
(HCN2), could counter the effects of brain removal. The HCN2
channel is known to be an important modulator of functional
bioelectric state33 and can hyperpolarize cells, and it has been
recently shown to be implied in firing and rhythmic properties
of the cholinergic neurons in both CNS and gastrointestinal
tract34, 35. We found the HCN2 channel to be endogenously
expressed in the developing neural tube along the base and lateral
regions and in the perisomitic area (Supplementary Fig. 2). To
address the role of bioelectric signaling during muscle develop-
ment in organisms incapable of relaying signals from their brains
to other tissue, embryos were injected at two-cell stage, in both
blastomeres, with mRNA encoding wild-type HCN2 (Fig. 3a,
turquoise arrows, HCN2-WT group). Uninjected and water-
injected embryos served as controls. In addition, in order to
understand the signaling between HCN2-expressing cells and the
structural muscle outcome (either a local or long-distance effect),
we evaluated the muscle phenotype after injection of HCN2-WT
mRNA in only one side (left-right) of the embryo (1/2 HCN2-
WT group). Co-injection with lacZ mRNA (as a reporter of
injected cells’ progeny; Fig. 3b, left, blue arrow) and detection of
the β-galactosidase (β-gal) distribution were used to select and
evaluate quantitatively those embryos with strongly unilateral
expression (Fig. 3b, right, blue arrow indicates high β-gal
expression and, thus, ipsilateral injected side).
First, we quantified the proportion of embryos with abnormal
phenotype within each BR− population (untreated or uninjected,
water-injected, HCN2-WT and 1/2 HCN2-WT; Fig. 3c). Our
results revealed that the expression of a WT HCN2 mRNA in
BR− clearly reduced the onset of abnormalities in the macroscopic
morphology and significantly decreased the percent of abnormal
embryos within the population (from 85 ± 7% in non-injected
BR− embryos to 45 ± 7% in HCN2-WT BR− group; z-test
P < 0.01). We observed the same rescue effect of HCN2 channel
when only one side of the animal was injected. The incidence of
aberrant phenotypes in the 1/2 HCN2-WT BR− group was
significantly lower than that for the regular (or uninjected)
BR− population (65 ± 3% of aberrant individuals in the 1/2
HCN2-WT
BR−
group;
z-test
P < 0.01
compared
to
the
non-injected BR−group).
We then microscopically analyzed the somatic-myotome
patterning in BR− embryos under the different ion channel
misexpression conditions (Fig. 3d–g). Analysis of fine muscle
structure revealed that the HCN2-WT BR− mutants exhibited
somites and myotomes that were perfectly organized, differing
clearly from the typical BR− muscle phenotype (Fig. 3d, e for
comparative micrographs). The differences in the number of
somites (30 ± 2) and the mean length of myofibers (134 ± 11 μm
at early stage and 165 ± 15 μm at late stage) were not statistically
significant from those measured in uninjected Ctrl embryos (after
post-hoc Bonferroni’s test). The unilateral HCN2 expression in
animals developing without brain had a protective effect on the
muscle organization of both the local side and the uninjected
contralateral side. Like the results for the both sides HCN2-
injections,
the
size
of
myotome
fibers in
the
uninjected

course (late stage: 170 ± 14 μm). Taken together, these results
indicate that the ectopic expression of the HCN2 channel
counteracts the effects of a missing brain during the somitic
myogenesis, even when the ectopic HCN2 channel is present on

 Brains protect tail patterning from effects of teratogens.
Having seen that the brain provides a beneficial patterning
influence for aspects of development, we sought to test possible
interactions of this effect with teratogenic agents. Could the
adverse effects induced by drugs on macroscopic phenotype and
tail patterning be prevented if the brain were present? Teratogenic
agents targeting the GABAergic, glutamatergic, adrenergic and
dopaminergic pathways have been shown to perturb pre-nervous
functions of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors36, 37.
Thus, we performed a loss- and gain-of-function screen on our
BR− animals (brain removal at stage 25, followed by immediate-
drug exposure) with different neuroactive agents, in order to
identify drugs that provoked the most severe phenotype in the
BR− population (i.e., those that induce more highly aberrant

 phenotypes than the ones induced by brain removal). We
observed that introduction of (RS)-(Tetrazol-5-yl)glycine (RS), an
agonist
of
the
NMDA-glutamate
receptor38
significantly
increased the occurrence of aberrant tail phenotypes within BR−
embryos (P < 0.01 for X2(0.05,6); Fig. 4) after 2 weeks of treatment
(stages 42–48).
The most frequent tail phenotype in (untreated) BR− embryos
is characterized by a single lateral bending, starting approximately
in the one-third posterior of the tail (see the most anterior arrow
drawn on Fig. 4a–d photomicrographs). Continuous treatment
with RS in BR− caused a 99 ± 3% of highly bent tails (including
curvature in notochord and spinal cord and spiraling of the tail;
see Fig. 4d, yellow arrows, for a representative profile). Strikingly,
these RS-induced effects only occurred in animals developed
without brain. The RS treatment of Ctrl animals (normal
development with brain, BR+) had no effect on tail patterning,
and severe phenotypes were not detected. The analysis of the
frequency of distribution of the different phenotypes within each
population revealed significant differences among the experi-
mental conditions (Fig. 4e; X2(0.05,6) = 370.8; P < 0.01). The
macroscopically identifiable changes in tail patterning, induced
by RS treatment in BR− embryos, were also accompanied by clear
qualitative alterations in the fine muscle structure and somite
organization (Fig. 4f, g). We conclude that presence of the brain
helps embryogenesis resist the disrupting effects of otherwise
strongly teratogenic agents.
To identify possible pathways mediating this brain-protecting
effect, we tested whether scopolamine (which rescues BR−-muscle
phenotype) could also protect against the effects of teratogens in
BR− embryos. We found that in the absence of a brain,
scopolamine treatment partially counteracted the teratogenic
effects of RS (Scopo+, Supplementary Fig. 3A–C). Scopolamine-
treated RS-BR− embryos (Drug+BR−Scopo+) are much healthier
than BR− embryos, but they do not exhibit an entirely recovered
Ctrl-like muscle phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Macro-
scopic tail phenotype and muscle structure analysis revealed that
scopolamine significantly decreases the occurrence of highly
aberrant phenotypes (from 92 ± 2% in Drug+BR−Scopo− to
15 ± 1% in Drug+BR−Scopo+, X2(0.05, 4) = 136.3; P < 0.01), leading
to a phenotype distribution similar to what occurs in the regular
BR− population (31 ± 9% in BR− without drug treatment or
Drug−BR−Scopo−). We conclude that scopolamine treatment
prevents the severe deformities caused by this teratogen, but its
effect is not sufficient to fully prevent the muscle defects caused in
BR− by the presence of the drug.
The absence of brain leads to abnormal neural development.
Having seen the profound effects of the brain on the developing
musculature, we next asked what type of alterations/reorganiza-
tions could have occurred on the remaining nervous tissue after
brain removal (peripheral innervation).
We visualized the body-wide neural network at late-stage
embryos by immunolabeling them with acetylated alpha-Tubulin
antibody (Tub) and quantifying the Tub-immunolocalization by
OD measurements (ranging from 0 (black, no expression) to 255
(white, maximal expression)). This antibody is a widely-accepted
marker for nerve fibers because stabilized microtubules, such as
those found in neuronal processes, contain important amounts of
acetylated tubulin39. The typical neural pattern in the peripheral
nervous system (PNS) of Ctrl embryos revealed that, at
late stages, three types of fibers can be clearly identifiable after
Tub-immunostaining (Fig. 5a): (i) commissural nerve fibers,
running along dorsoventral axis (long arrows); (ii) longitudinal
nerve fibers, along anteroposterior axis (short arrows); and
(iii) internal network or neural network underlying the space
between two consecutive segments defined by the commissural
ones (unfilled triangles). The internal neuropil in Ctrl animals
consisted of a thin network, barely detected by OD measurements
(OD mean value of 15 ± 7 units). After brain removal, and
similarly to errors detected for segmentation, commissural and
longitudinal fibers in BR− were mispatterned (note some
incorrect commissural nerve distribution coincident with defects
at the level of the somitic myogenesis, magenta arrow in Fig. 5b).
Strikingly, embryos developed without a brain exhibited a robust
ectopic branching (internal neuropil), with nerve fibers chaoti-
cally orientated through the animal body (yellow unfilled
triangles in Fig. 5b, OD mean value of 32 ± 11 units; P < 0.01
compared to Ctrl group, after post-hoc Bonferroni’s test). Results
from sham-surgery embryos (extirpating non-brain regions)
confirmed that this nerve misspatterning is specifically due to
brain removal, as demonstrated after Tub immunolocalization
(Supplementary Fig. 4). We conclude that the absence of a brain
provokes a dramatic and specific change of the branching of the
internal nerve net in the whole animal body (aberrant neural
network).
To test whether the effect of brain removal was due to lack of
an endogenous pruning phase, we analyzed the motoneuron
axonal
patterning
in
early
stage
embryos
(stages
31–41;
Supplementary Fig. 5) using the antibody znp1. This antibody
labels primary motoneuron axons40, and is widely used for many
different animal models during embryogenesis26. We found no
significant difference in the density of motor axonal branches
(internal neuropil) among stage 31, 35 and 45 Ctrl embryos
(after
post-hoc
Bonferroni’s
test).
Conversely,
both
errors
in axonal establishment (magenta arrows in Supplementary
Fig. 5B, D, F showing lack of trajectory compared to turquoise
arrows in Supplementary Fig. 5A, C, E) and ectopic/aberrant
branching (yellow unfilled triangles in Supplementary Fig. 5B, D, F
pointing branches projecting off the main axons; compare to
turquoise unfilled triangles in Supplementary Fig. 5A, C, E) were
detected from the onset and during the progression of the
development in BR− embryos. Thus we conclude that the
brainless phenotype involved ectopic growth of neural tissue,
not a failure of normal pruning.
Having detected that ectopic branching was a BR−-induced
specific effect on peripheral nerve structure, we asked next if the
pharmacological treatment and/or ectopic ion channel expression
used to rescue the muscle phenotype would have similar effects
on the BR−-aberrant neural network (Fig. 5c–f). Results derived
from cholinergic-drug treatment revealed that the BR−-induced
dense internal neuropil was not fixed by scopolamine or
carbachol. Unlike the rescue effects on muscle phenotype,
scopolamine was not able to prevent the massive internal neural
branching (Fig. 5c; OD mean value of 31 ± 5 units; P < 0.05
compared to Ctrl group, after post-hoc Bonferroni’s test).
Carbachol-treated
BR−
embryos
showed
a
completely
disorganized nerve structure, more aberrant than those in drug-
untreated BR−, with aberrations in the three different types
of nerve fibers (Fig. 5d; OD mean value for internal neuropil of
37 ± 9 units; P < 0.01 compared to Ctrl group, after post-hoc
Bonferroni’s test). However, analysis of HCN2-injected embryos
showed that the nerve sprouting consequent to developing
without a brain was efficiently rescued by expression of HCN2
WT (Fig. 5e; OD mean value of 25 ± 11 units; P > 0.05 compared
to Ctrl group, after post-hoc Bonferroni’s test). We conclude that
the aberrant neural network in BR− can be fixed by ion channel
misexpression providing additional channels, but not by the
pharmacological treatment targeting existing ones.
Given that the BR−-induced aberrant neural network was
rescued by HCN2 overexpression, we tested the spatial signaling
between HCN2-expressing cells and the responding PNS, by

 means of quantitative evaluation of the nerve patterning in the
contralateral uninjected side of 1/2 HCN2-WT overexpressing
embryos (see text above and Fig. 3b for experimental injection
details). 65% of uninjected sides (low HCN2 expression) had
internal neuropil similar to those in both injected side (high
HCN2 expression), and Ctrl animals (compare internal neuropil
in a typical contralateral uninjected side (Fig. 5g) to that one in
injected side (Fig. 5h) and Ctrl animal (Fig. 5a)), displaying an
OD mean value of 20 ± 5 units (P > 0.05 compared to Ctrl group,
after post-hoc Bonferroni’s test; the quantitative evaluation of the
intensity of Tub protein signal on injected side was not performed
because OD values could not be comparable to the other analysis,
due to the characteristic dark precipitate in the cells expressing
β-gal). Our results suggest that the rescue effects of HCN2 are not
only mediated by the cells expressing this specific channel
(autonomous cell behavior), but that, in absence of brain, the
alteration of bioelectrical state could promote accurate nerve
patterning via long-distance signals.
Brain regulates muscle and nerve patterning via distinct
modes. Next we investigated the possible pathway by which brain
acts on distant tissues: electrical efferent pathway, via spinal cord,
vs. alternative or exo-spinal pathway, by severing the spinal
connection between brain and the rest of the body (Fig. 6a and
Table 3). We analyzed the muscle and nerve patterning in
embryos developed with a brain, but with a cervical fragment of
spinal cord resected at stage 25 (SC−; Fig. 6a top panel). The mean

 angle of the myotome fibers in SC− (128 ± 16°) differed
significantly from the typical chevron-shape angle in Ctrl animals
(114 ± 10°, P < 0.05 after post-hoc Dunn’s test), leading to an
overall altered muscle organization (Fig. 6a middle panel,
magenta dashed arrowhead-like line). However, SC− presented
less severe muscle phenotype than BR−: most of the myofibers
presented normal fine structure (with non-significant differences
in the mean length of the myotome fibers compared to Ctrl, after
post-hoc Bonferroni’s test) with unfrequented structural aberra-
tions. SC− neural patterning exhibited some degree of organiza-
tion for commissural and longitudinal fibers, but frequent errors
were present (magenta arrows in Fig. 6a bottom panel). Internal
neuropil was, nevertheless, profoundly altered (yellow unfilled
triangles), displaying the typical BR− aberrant or ectopic nerve
branching. We conclude that while muscles can develop moder-
ately well without direct spinal cord-dependent brain signaling,
the observed brain effects on nerve patterning require an intact
spinal cord.
Having seen the differential effect of brain signaling on muscle
and nerves, and considering the HCN2 rescue effects, we next
specifically targeted the dorsal (neural) regions or ventral (somatic
muscle) regions of brainless animals with HCN2 mRNA. Embryos
were microinjected with HCN2 (wild-type channel) and lacZ
mRNA either in the two ventral cells (Fig. 6b upper panel) or in
the two dorsal cells (Fig. 6c upper panel) at the four-cell stage.
Embryos with HCN2 ventral injections that developed without a
brain (BR− + HCN2 ventral) presented profound defects in muscle
structure, both in angle and in length/organization of the
myotome fibers (Fig. 6b middle panel). Ectopic or aberrant
patterning was also present, as seen in BR−. Conversely, embryos
with HCN2 dorsal injections that developed without a brain
(BR− + HCN2 dorsal) presented a perfectly organized myotome,
with normal myofiber structure and organization, indistinguish-
able from typical Ctrl-muscle patterning (Fig. 6c middle panel).
Nerve patterning in BR− + HCN2 ventral animals was markedly
altered for all the different fiber types, with an extensive and
mispatterned intermyotomal nerve branching (Fig. 6b lower
panel). Conversely, HCN2-mRNA injections in dorsal module of
the embryo lead to a well-organized nerve phenotype, indis-
tinguishable from what occurs in Ctrl embryos (Fig. 6c lower
panel). Quantification is shown in Fig. 6d–f. We conclude that in
order to rescue the BR−-induced effects, HCN2 needs to be
expressed in dorsal structures (neural tube).
Discussion
Here we show that the early morphogenesis and patterning of
trunk muscle structure and innervation in animals developing
without a brain are highly abnormal. Brainless (BR−) animals’
peripheral neural network is profoundly disorganized, with fibers
chaotically oriented through the animal body, while the muscle
organization was adversely affected both at the microscopic tissue
organization level (length/definition and angle of myotomes), as
well as at the animal morphological level (aberrant phenotype).
The effect is brain-specific, as removal of other body regions does
not induce this effect. The brain is not only required for normal
development, but also exerts a protective effect, ameliorating the
effects of teratogenic drugs which are made notably worse in
brainless embryos.
We gained insight into the mechanism of brain-dependent,
long-range patterning effects by rescue assays. Ectopic expression
of a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion
channel
(HCN2)
was
sufficient
to
prevent
muscle
and
nerve mispatterning in brainless animals. The HCN2 rescue
effect only occurs when CNS-fated blastomeres are targeted,
suggesting that bioelectrical signals, when acting within neural
tissues, can mimic the endogenous effects of the brain. Future
work will determine the relative contributions, to the HCN2
rescue, of modulating spiking-encoded activity in the nervous
system41, and alteration of non-neural distributions of resting
potential that have likewise been implicated in developmental
patterning42.
We also started exploring the potential therapeutic implica-
tions of our findings, by recapitulating the protective effects using
pharmacological
agents
targeting
endogenous
channels
(not requiring exogenous misexpression). Drugs targeting the
cholinergic system differentially affected BR−-induced outcomes.
A dual nicotinic and muscarinic agonist exacerbated the defects
in muscle structure; in contrast, suppression of muscarinic
pathway, by means of scopolamine treatment, rescued it. The fact
that scopolamine can partially rescue the defects in muscle, but
not the aberrant nerve phenotype, and that spinal cord-transected
animals develop a partially normal muscle phenotype, suggest
that the brain could play a direct role in muscle development that
may not involve spinal pathway and peripheral nerves (Fig. 7a, b).
Taken together, these data reveal an essential role for brain-
derived signaling during embryogenesis, long before its involve-
ment in behavior, and show that the patterning effects of the
Fig. 6 Brain effects on muscle and nerve patterning are partially mediated via spinal cord and mimicked via the dorsal expression of HCN2. a-c Upper row,

brain (center image in c) and SC (right image in c) and β-gal− for ventral myotomes (right image in c). For lateral views, rostral is left and dorsal is up. Scale

panel), as seen under polarized light. Muscle patterning (angle of the myotomes, magenta dashed arrowhead-like line) in SC− was altered compared to Ctrl.
SC− presented a less severe phenotype than BR− displaying myofibers with normal structure (turquoise arrow) and some incorrect patterning (magenta
arrow). BR− + HCN2 ventral embryos presented profound defects in muscle structure, both in angle (magenta dashed line) and in length/organization
(magenta arrow) of the myotome fibers. Ectopic or aberrant patterning was also present (yellow arrow). BR− + HCN2 dorsal embryos presented an
organized myotome, with normal myofiber structure and organization (turquoise dashed line and arrows). Lower row, typical nerve patterning (commissural
fibers indicated by long turquoise arrow, longitudinal fibers indicated by head arrows, and internal neuropil indicated by unfilled triangles) for SC− (left panel),
HCN2-ventral injected BR− (center panel) and HCN2-dorsal injected BR− (right panel), shown on anti-acetylated alpha-tubulin antibody staining. SC−
exhibited some degree of organization for commissural and longitudinal fibers (turquoise arrows), but frequent errors were present (magenta arrows).
Internal neuropil was, nevertheless, profoundly altered, displaying the typical BR−aberrant or ectopic nerve branching (yellow). Nerve patterning in BR− +
HCN2 ventral was markedly altered for all the different fiber types. Conversely, HCN2-mRNA injections in dorsal cells lead to an entirely well-organized
nerve phenotype, indistinguishable from controls. Rostral is upper right and dorsal is up. Scale bar, 100 μm. d-f. Quantification of the mean angle

 brain can be largely mimicked by available reagents targeting
cells’ bioelectric state.
X. laevis is uniquely suited for the study of biophysical
mechanisms underlying pattern regulation. Somites in X. laevis
are comprised of myotome fibers43 and embryonic myogenesis in
Xenopus involves intricate interplays between several MRFs:
MyoD, Myf5, Myf6 (also called Mrf4), Myogenin and Myf6.
Dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns of these factors
orchestrate the main steps of muscle development: lineage
specification of muscle cells, differentiation of myocytes, fusion
into myofibers, and formation of muscle groups (reviewed in
ref. 23). Future developments integrating in vivo physiological
monitoring with transcriptional reporters will address the
interaction of neurotransmitter and bioelectric signals from
the brain with the transcriptional control of these and other
important factors.
Our results show that brain input is important for patterning
and myotome organization (Fig. 1c–h) rather than the early
events of myogenesis, such as fate or induction of cell lineages.
Somite segmentation is not altered by brain removal, as
demonstrated by the normal number of somites in BR− animals at
late stages, suggesting that the periodicity of somite formation
and initiation of myogenesis (mediated mainly by MyoD and
Myf5) do not require early brain-derived signaling. Brain inputs
might be acting in later events, when the myotome fibers have
been already established in the somite. At these differentiation
steps, expression of Mrf4 and Myogenenin might be susceptible
to brain signaling. In Xenopus, Mrf4 has been showed to be the
main myogenic factor subject to nerve influence. This evidence is,
however, conflicting and some authors postulate that the initial
activation of Mrf4 is nerve-independent in embryonic Xenopus44.
However, different studies demonstrate a neural influence on
Mrf4 expression. In fact, muscle denervation leads to decrease
Mrf4 levels, in both development and regeneration19. Each
myogenic factor might have a distinct role in the regulation of
nerve-regulated genes, such as different subunits of a neuro-
muscular junction (NMJ) receptor: the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor nAChR45.
A variety of studies have demonstrated the relationship
between innervation and correct anatomical development of
muscle structures, in different vertebrates. Denervation of rat
skeletal muscles in utero provokes degeneration and myofiber
fragmentation, as well as a slowing down of myofiber growth46.
Similar findings were seen in frogs, where the denervation of the
hind limb leads to a ~ 12% reduction in growth, and for the
development of limb transplants in chick embryos47. Abnorm-
alities in overall patterning (size and shape) of the limbs in
absence of nerve influence have been also described in sala-
manders, being the muscle the most sensitive to nerve absence48.
Such data are usually thought to be explained by ‘trophic’ or
permissive effect of nerves49. Our results, where brainless
embryos have more innervation than the control ones (Fig. 5a, b),
suggest an additional and ‘instructive’ role, mediated by signals
normally originating in the brain.
Our results reveal a long-distance role of brain-derived
signaling
at
both
organ
level
(overall
muscle
phenotype;
Fig. 2a, b) and tissue level (myofibrillar structure; Fig. 2g, h). The
partially fixed muscle phenotype after the spinal cord resection or
after scopolamine treatment seems to indicate that in addition to
the spinal pathway, muscle is susceptible to a long-distance action
of the brain, perhaps via diffusion of neurotransmitter signals
(schematized in Fig. 7).
Some of the most tantalizing data reveal a role for the brain
and CNS in patterning of distal structures. Older studies have
postulated a role of the brain-derived signals, which are
conducted along the spinal cord, on morphogenesis in Xenopus
tail regeneration; the subcommissural organ was suggested as
the source of this signaling50. Recent experiments using point
ablation in the spinal cord14 showed that patterning of the final
regenerated tail is influenced for both the injury position along
the AP axis and a non-linear combinatory effect when two
different AP injury levels are performed. Hence, shape-instructive
long-distance signaling is not explained by simple presence of
nerve (trophic effects) but appears to generate distinct informa-
tion along different positions in the spinal cord. Our ‘hypercur-
vature’ phenotype in BR− animals (Fig. 4e) is comparable to
Mondia et al.’s most severe one, suggesting that similar signals
from brain might are acting on development and regeneration.
We report the first steps to identify the mediators of the early
brain’s effect by showing that the effects on myopatterning
derived from the absence of a brain can be completely rescued by
ectopic alteration in neurotransmitter (Fig. 2) and ion channel
(Figs. 3 and 6c middle panel) signaling.
Even in the absence of a brain, muscarinic AChR (mAChR)
suppression (via scopolamine treatment) led to close-to-normal
muscle development, while nicotinic AChR (nAChR) and
mAChR activation (carbachol treatment) provoked a more
aberrant muscle phenotype. Exogenous application of acet-
ylcholine modulates the intrinsic properties of spinal motoneur-
ons after SC transection in the juvenile salamander through the
mAChR51. Likewise, functional nAChR have been reported in
spinal motoneurones of X. laevis embryo52. These studies support
the reorganization in spinal cord circuits in absence of brain as
the main target for actions of scopolamine and carbachol on
muscle cells. The alteration of membrane potential (Vmem), by a
direct action of these drugs on receptors in the early muscle cells,
could be an important part of the mechanism. We hypothesize
that scopolamine is acting on NMJ, specifically at presynaptic/
synaptic level, blocking the Ach actions by mAChRs on slow ion
flows52 (If; Fig. 7d). This If disinhibition could counter the excess
of excitability induced by the presence of ectopic branching in
BR−. Our results suggest a strategy to pharmacologically target
muscular defects, by means of regulating the balance between
slow If and action potentials at NMJ level.

roles
of
several
neuro-
transmitters37, 53, and suggested that neurotransmitter drugs
could be potent teratogens36. We found that an NMDA agonist
provoked severe phenotypes in BR− animals (RS, Fig. 3). NMDA-
glutamate receptors (NMDAR) in muscles are also excitatory and
depolarize the muscle cells leading to their contraction (such as
carbachol does on nAChR). Given recent work on the importance
of steady-state developmental voltage gradients during Xenopus
muscle patterning31, our findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that maintaining the balance between developmental
bioelectricity (resting potential gradients) and discrete action

Fig. 7 Brain signaling for muscle and nerve development and patterning a. Schematic representation drawing of a Xenopus embryo, showing the main
components of our experiments: brain (blue), spinal cord-peripheral nerves (pink) and somites-muscle (brown). Brain effects on nerve patterning could
occur directly (2), by using efferent spinal pathway. Brain effects on muscle patterning could occur indirectly (3a), by acting on neurons, or directly (3b), by
acting on muscle. b A spinal mechanism, for coding the information about patterning and morphogenesis, could occur via direct signaling from the brain to
the neurons in the spinal cord (pink circle). According to our results (different treatments are indicated with purple labels), the effects of the peripheral
innervation on muscle cells can be partially explained in terms of developmental bioelectricity or changes in Vmem excitability. We hypothesize that at these
stages, the brain is in part controlling the bioelectric state of peripheral tissues, and a correct balance (turquoise triangle) of brain activity (long-range
instructive cues or top-down perspective) and local signals (bottom-up perspective) is necessary for correct morphogenesis. Both an excess of tonic
activity (induced after carbachol or RS treatment) and an excess of slow If gradients through membrane lead to mispatterning. The extra-spinal pathway by
which the brain is acting on muscles can be mimicked pharmacologically, with pharmacological agents targeting bioelectricity (i.e., scopolamine). We
hypothesize that scopolamine is acting at presynaptic/synaptic level, blocking the inhibitory ACh actions (via mAChRs) on slow ion flows, and leading the
Vmem to appropriate values for muscle patterning. c, d. Schematic representation of neuromuscular specificity in normal development (c, with brain) and in
absence of the brain (d, BR−). Our results suggest that ectopic branching detected in the absence of a brain is not due to deficits in early pruning or target
retrograde signaling. Pathfinding behavior at the onset of Xenopus development starts at the spinal cord level, as early patterned electrical gradients in SC
cells is required for the correct axon guidance. The different treatments applied in our experiments (purple labels and circles) are placed on the cellular/
subcellular domains where they are probably acting

 potentials at NMJ may be important during muscle development
and inhibitory signals from the brain (probably via extra-spinal
alternative pathways) may be acting to shield the developing
muscle cells from such excitatory stimulus that might cause
muscle mispatterning (Fig. 7b, brown rectangle representing
muscle membrane). Recently, it has been showed that activation
of NMDAR impairs the myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells
through mTOR/MAPK signaling pathway54. The protective effect
of brain detected in the RS-treated control animals (vs. the
devastating effects observed in RS-treated BR−-animals) evidences
the key role of the brain signaling for the correct morphogenesis.
The possibility of exploiting and perhaps strengthening brain-
derived protective signals represent an exciting area of research
for future efforts in the field of birth defects.
In addition to the muscle effects, the absence of a brain during
development generates an abnormal patterning and organization
of the peripheral innervation or PNS of the animal (Fig. 5;
somatic component of the PNS). We used immunohistochemistry
with an antibody to acetylated α-tubulin39 to analyze the somatic
neural processes coming from both primary motoneurons and
sensory neurons, in order to study the instructive role of brain
inputs in patterning and global organization of the nervous
system.
Cell fate and differentiation for primary motoneurons and
sensory neurons start early in embryogenesis. Rohon-Beard (RB)
neurons cells originate during gastrulation and present electrical
excitability as early as stage 2024. Neural crest (NC) material
segregates at gastrula stage (around stage 15) and starts migrating
around stage 2025. In our assay, brain removal is done after the
onset of the migration, at stage 25, and hence, when the fate of the
trunk NC cells has been already specified55.
In neural morphogenesis, after differentiation and migration,
and once the progenitors have reached the final location, new
steps are necessary for axon growth and guidance (pathway
selection), formation of initial connections (target selection), and
connection remodeling and pruning (address selection). The early
neural morphogenesis, differentiation and migration of X. laevis,
both for sensory and motor somatic neurons56, earlier than
the time point for the brain removal, lead us to suggest that
aberrations detected in neural patterning in BR− animals might
be due, to the later steps on pathfinding and synapse formation.
Thus, the peripheral innervation pattern is an epigenetic outcome
that depends on complete development of the functional
physiology of the brain; in brain removal, not all of the signals
required for a correct peripheral pattern are conveyed.
The peripheral innervation formed in brainless animals is
mispatterned throughout the whole animal body (Fig. 5). How
neuromuscular specificity arises during embryonic development
has
been
a
controversial
issue.
Are
correct
connections
pre-established from the outset or do motor axons project
randomly into the developing muscles followed by extensive
pruning of incorrect connections? Our analysis of brainless ani-
mals (Supplementary Fig. 5) shows that nerves are altered very
early in development (as soon as stage 31), with clear errors in
finding the correct trajectory (actually in BR− nerve fibers fail in
turning to create the correct intermyotome division, see Supple-
mentary Fig. 5B, ventral magenta arrow). Our results suggest that
brain-derived signals are important for correct early patterning,
not for maintenance of a default pruning program.
HCN2 targeted to dorsal part (brain and spinal cord) rescues
both muscle and nerve. Spinal cord-transected embryos show
the same aberrant ectopic branching than BR−, suggest that
pathfinding behavior at the onset of Xenopus development starts
at the spinal cord (or CNS) level (Fig. 7c; as previously was
showed in zebrafish57 or axolotl58). Moreover, in line with recent
evidence59, we show that the early patterned electrical in spinal
motoneurons (as HCN2 dorsal is able to rescue the whole phe-
notype and brain effects on nerve patterning require an intact
spinal cord) is required for the correct axon guidance. While
previous work did not explain the mechanisms by which the
rhythmic activity in spinal neurons affects early nerve develop-
ment, our data are consistent with a role for the brain in deter-
mining patterned morphogenesis by controlling slow ion flows on
primary-neuron fast firing (Fig. 7b).
Interestingly, we discovered a rescue effect on the neural
phenotype only by means of reagents that target membrane
potential (Vmem), induced by the ectopic expression of HCN2
(Figs. 5e–h and 6c bottom panel). While targeted misexpression
of ion channels has been demonstrated to rescue patterning of the
brain itself32, we report here that using ion channel expression
can overcome developmental defects stemming from brain
damage. Future work will exploit the emerging advances in
optical imaging of neural activity in vivo60 to characterize the
temporal properties of brain-derived signals and their modifica-
tion by HCN2.
One remarkable aspect is that HCN2 expression can rescue
patterning of cells on the other side of the animal – cells that
do not themselves express HCN2 (Fig. 5g). Such long-range
bioelectrical signaling has been observed in bioelectric tumor
suppression61 and control of apoptosis/proliferation32. Our data
reveal that expression of HCN2 at a remote location can induce
repair of peripheral neural structures in a damaged background,
suggesting a range of therapies where easily-accessible tissues are
targeted to induce repair in a difficult-to-reach site. Future
work extending closed-loop optogenetic control to neural and
non-neural somatic tissues62 will refine the specific bioelectric
state that facilitates normal network structure and test these
interventions in adult disease models.
Scopolamine-treated BR− animals display an aberrant neural
network but normal muscle phenotype, suggesting distinct
regulatory mechanisms. We do not claim that correction in nerve
patterning (by HCN2 injection; Fig. 5e–h) is the only factor
responsible for muscle correction by that treatment (Fig. 3b). The
direct action of ion channels in muscle cells and their indirect
action on muscle patterning through peripheral nerves are not
mutually exclusive possibilities. Future work will be directed
towards understanding their mutual contributions to the repair
process. The fact that pharmacological modulation of Ach
transmission does not affect the neural patterning (Fig. 5c, d) but
bioelectrical modulations do (as in vitro studies seems also to
indicate63), suggests that both long-distance brain input and
developmental bioelectricity are potential targets for future
applications

pathologies.
Here, we establish an experimental model for the study of long-
range patterning control, and the discovery of pre-behavior
functions of the nascent brain. This model is amenable to optical,
biophysical, genetic, and chemical approaches, and offers the
unique opportunity to target diverse spatial sites (due to the
Xenopus fate-map) to test non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of
brain-dependent instructive patterning signals. Future develop-
ment of transgenic promoters will allow tissue-specific tests, while
targeted ablation technology may enable finer dissection of brain
regions responsible for various patterning outcomes.
Our data suggest a revision of the view of the brain as quiescent
prior to the animal’s independent activity, showing that its
signaling role spans the control of pattern formation and
behavior. This is consistent with recent proposals that the
important mechanistic and conceptual commonalities exist
between the algorithms of neuroscience and those that guide
pattern regulation64. This model system and dataset serves as a
base for future studies of local and long-range influences over

 large-scale patterning. The relationship of instructive morpho-
genetic signals mediated by bioelectric events to the computa-
tional capabilities of the brain is an exciting direction for future
work. Moreover, our data point to widely-available and already
human-approved drugs as potential ‘morphoceuticals’ – agents
that can be capitalized upon to prevent or perhaps even reverse
specific kinds of anatomical defects. More broadly, these results
suggest a direction for regenerative medicine towards the devel-

Methods
Animal husbandry. Xenopus laevis embryos were fertilized in vitro according
to standard protocols25 in 0.1X Marc’s Modified Ringer’s solution (MMR; 10 mM
Na+, 0.2 mM K+, 10.5 mM Cl–, 0.2 mM Ca2+, pH 7.8). Xenopus embryos were
housed at 14 °C and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber65. All experimental
procedures involving Xenopus embryos were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committees and Tufts University Department of Laboratory Animal
Medicine under protocol M2014-79.
Microsurgery. Stage-25 embryos were randomly grouped in one of the two
experimental groups: Control (Ctrl) and Brainless (BR−; see Fig. 1a for a schematic
representation of the experimental design). Randomized controlled trial conditions
were maintained throughout the experiment. Embryos were anesthetized in a
0.02% tricaine solution (pH 7.5) in 0.1X MMR. Brain removal in BR− group was
performed under dissecting microscope and using a dissecting knife (FST #10055-
12). Once movement ceased, a single cut removed the anterodorsal region corre-
sponding to the brain (from the cement gland to the most anterior somite; Fig. 1b).
After brain removal, animals were allowed to heal in 0.75X MMR for 1 h. After
washing, untreated and surgically treated animals were raised at 14 °C and
scored and analyzed for phenotype distribution and the different morphological
parameters, respectively, at stages 30–41 (early stage) and 42–48 (late stage).
Following the same experimental and care conditions, additional spinal cord (SC)
resection (SC−; Fig. 6a) experiments were performed on stage-25 embryos. To
prevent regeneration66, one segment of the spinal cord, sizing 50–100 μm in length,
was completely removed by using two forceps with super-fine tips (Dumont #5ST,
FST 11252-00). SC segments were removed at cervical level, immediately posterior
to the hindbrain, and taking special care of minimizing the damage on the most
rostral myotomes.
Two different Sham surgeries were performed by removing pieces of tissue of
comparable size at different locations of the stage-25 animal body (Supplementary
Fig. 1): part of the endodermal yolk mass (Yolk− or yolk resection) or the most
posterior part of the embryo body (Tail− or tailbud resection).
In order to feed the BR− tadpoles, a nutritive medium was modified from ref. 67.
The nutritive medium consisted of 9.5% Ham’s nutrient mixture F12 (with 1.0 mM
L-glutamine, Sigma 51651 C) and 0.5% calf serum (from formula-fed bovine calves,
iron supplemented, Sigma C8056) dissolved in 0.1X MMR. From stage 45, Ctrl and
BR− tadpoles were fed with this nutritive medium for 2 h every day.
Microinjections. Capped synthetic mRNAs generated using mMessage mMachine
kit (Ambion) were dissolved in nuclease-free water and injected into embryos
immersed in 3% Ficoll solution using standard methods25. The mRNA injections
were made using borosilicate glass needles calibrated to bubble pressures of 55 to
60 kPa in water, delivering 100- to 130-ms pulses. Each injection delivered between
0.5–1 nl or 0.5–1 ng of mRNA per blastomere into the embryos. Two different
sets of injections were performed. Firstly, at the two-cell stage (Fig. 3a, b), either
one (1/2 HCN2 Inj) or both (HCN2 Inj) blastomeres were injected. Secondly, at the
four-cell stage (Fig. 6b, c), either the two ventral (HCN2 ventral Inj) or the two
dorsal (HCN2 dorsal Inj) blastomeres were injected. Injections were done into the
center of cells at the animal pole.
Constructs used were HCN2-WT-2A-GFP or HCN2-WT68 and β-galactosidase
in PCS2 and both RNAs (HCN2-WT and β-galactosidase) were mixed at 3:5 and
1:5 dilutions respectively, for microinjections. HCN2 is a potassium/sodium
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel, type 269. Embryos
were injected in 3% Ficoll solution and after 30 min, were washed and then reared
in 0.1X MMR until desired stages.
Drug exposure. Ctrl and BR− Xenopus embryos were exposed to specific
pharmacological agents, dissolved in 0.1X MMR, from stage 25 (immediately after
brain removal) to stage 48. The drugs were refreshed every three days. Two drugs
targeting cholinergic receptors and one directed to NMDA-glutamatergic receptor
were used: 10 μM scopolamine (a muscarinic-receptor antagonist; Tocris 1414),
10 μM carbamoylcholine chloride (carbachol, a dual muscarinic- and nicotinic-
receptor agonist; Tocris 2810) and 10 μM (RS)-(Tetrazol-5-yl)glycine (RS; an
NMDA receptor agonist; Tocris 0312), respectively. All drug treatments were
performed using embryos from mixed batches of fertilizations, using at least three
biological replicates.
Stock solutions of all pharmaceuticals were created by dissolving the compound
in Millipore water (to a final drug concentration of 100 mM for both scopolamine
and carbachol, and to 50 mM for RS) and then stored in aliquots at –20 °C. Further
dilution of all compounds was made in normal media (0.1X MMR). Control
experiments were performed using embryos in 0.1X MMR, both for Ctrl and BR−
groups. Drug concentrations were determined through toxicity screens and were
applied at levels that did not result in lethality or observable developmental defects.
Immunofluorescence and histochemistry. Immediately after treatment, at the
relevant time points (immediately after brain removal and first 2 weeks and third
and fourth weeks after brain removal for early- and late-stage studies, respectively),
anesthetized tadpoles were fixed in MEMFA overnight at 4 °C for whole-mount
immunofluorescence25. Briefly, embryos were washed twice in 1× phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), and permeabilized in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for
30 min. Animals were then blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h at
room temperature (RT). Samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C using znp1
(Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, used at 1:250 dilution) and anti-
acetylated alpha-tubulin antibody (Tub; Sigma T7451 used at 1:500 dilution).
Following primary exposure, embryos were washed three times in PBST before a
60-min RT incubation with AlexaFluor-555 conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen) used at 1:500 diluted in PBST. Following secondary incubation,
animals were washed three times for 15 min in PBST and imaged on an Olympus
BX-61 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA AG CCD camera, and
controlled by Metamorph software. Particular care was taken to ensure that
embryos from all the different groups were processed in the same batch at the same
immunofluorescence session.
Beta-galactosidase enzymatic detection. Embryos injected with β-galactosidase
(β-gal) mRNA were fixed (30 min in MEMFA at RT) at the relevant stages, washed
twice in PBS with 2 mM MgCl2, and stained with X-gal (Roche Applied Sciences,
Indianapolis, IN) staining solution at 37 °C for 3 h. Embryos were then rinsed three
times in PBS and analyzed.
In situ hybridization. Xenopus embryos at stage 35 were collected and fixed in
MEMFA25 and in situ hybridization was performed25, 70. The embryos were
washed with phosphate buffered saline 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and transferred
through a series of methanol washes 25%-50%-75%-100%. In situ antisense probe
was generated in vitro from linearized template using DIG labeling mix (Roche).
Chromogenic reaction times were optimized for signal to background ratio.
Antisense RNA probes for Xenopus HCN2 were generated from X. laevis hcn2.L
IMAGE clone 5514485 (purchased from Dharmacon): a HindIII fragment was
deleted, leaving exons 2-4 and part of exon 5 as probe. In situ hybridized embryos
were then agarose embedded and sectioned. Briefly, 4% low melting point agarose
was melted at poured into plastic scaffolds. Gently dried, in situ hybridized
embryos were oriented within the agarose for transverse sectioning. The agarose
blocks were then allowed to solidify, trimmed and sectioned using Leica VT1000S
vibratome to obtain transverse sections.
Phenotype scoring and morphological evaluation. Ctrl-, Sham-Yolk−-, and
BR−-Xenopus embryos were scored for abnormalities in the macroscopic pheno-
type. Average number of animals with clearly identifiable left-right axis bending
and/or tail defects were used to evaluate the percent abnormal within each
population. Embryos were photographed (lateral view) using a Nikon AZ100 with
an attached QImaging CD camera controlled by QCapture software.
Mean collagen density, angle and length of myotome fibers, and number of
somites. All muscle structure studies were performed on 4× or 10× images taken
under polarized light. Birefringence microscopy was performed on an Olympus
BX-61 compound microscope with a universal condenser (U-UCD8). The
transmitted light DIC slider (U-DICTS) was pulled out and the polarizing filter
was rotated such the background appeared darkest. Embryos were positioned at a
45° angle for imaging. Analysis of birefringence images was performed in ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health, Maryland, US).
Collagen density in early-staged embryos (Fig. 1c, d; short arrows) was
evaluated by means of optical density (OD) using a gray scale gradient of 0-255
(white to black), on 4× polarized-light photomicrographs31. Each embryo was
sampled using a systematic procedure in order to measure the OD at different
anatomical levels, along the anteroposterior axis. Six OD-myotome measurements
were used to determine mean value for each animal. At least 30 embryos within
each experimental group were analyzed. Possible aberrations originating from the
optical system of the camera were corrected by background image subtraction.
Mean angle and length of myotome fibers (Fig. 1c–g; overlaid dashed
arrowhead-like lines and double-headed arrows, respectively) for both early- and
late-staged embryos was performed on 10× polarized-light images, using ImageJ
software. For each animal, three somites at anterior, central and posterior levels,
respectively, were systematically random sampled. To obtain a representative mean
value of length, nine myotome fibers, from dorsal to ventral axis, were measured
for each somite at each anatomical level. The number of somites, between end of

 the gut and tip of the tail, for both early- and late-staged embryos was evaluated on
4x birefringence images.
Analysis of the neural network branching (see Fig. 5, unfilled triangles) in early-
and late-staged embryos was performed by evaluating the intensity of znp1 and
acetylated alpha-tubulin (Tub) immunostaining, respectively, through gray-level
measures (OD). In order to obtain one OD-mean value per animal, multiple
measurements were taken along the anteroposterior axis. Each measurement
consisted of the mean value of the pixels of a fixed-size window, placed between
two consecutive somites (intermyotomal or internal neuropil). The size of the
window remained constant across subjects. All individuals among whom
comparisons are being made were produced in the same batch, treated identically
for processing and imaging–conditions were not changed. In addition, possible
aberrations originating from the optical system of the camera were corrected by
background image subtraction.
Statistics. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, Inc., CA, US) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, WA, US)
software. Each dish of tadpoles was considered a replicate.
When comparing numerical variables (OD, number of somites, angle and
length of the myotome fibers), data from, at least, two replicates (minimal replicate
size: n = 25 embryos) were analyzed per each experimental condition. Firstly, data
were tested for homogeneity of variances by Bartlett’s test. If variances are similar,
we applied unpaired and two-tailed Student’s t-test (two independent groups),
one-way ANOVA test (multiple independent groups), or two-way ANOVA
test (two independent variables) followed by post-hoc Bonferroni’s test (when
P < 0.05). In case of unequal variances (or non-normal distributions for a sample
size of less than 50), two-tailed Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis test followed
by pot-hoc Dunn’s test (when P < 0.05), respectively, were used.
For differences in sample proportion (percent of aberrant embryos) or
distribution analysis (frequency of phenotypes), data from, at least, two replicates
and sample size equal or greater than 50 embryos were pooled and analyzed by
multiple-sample z-test or Χ2 test, respectively.
The significance level (α) was set to 0.05 in all cases. The statistical values are
reported as mean ± s.d.
