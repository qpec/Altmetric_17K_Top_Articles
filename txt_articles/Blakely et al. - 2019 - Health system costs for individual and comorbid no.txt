Abstract
Background
There is little systematic assessment of how total health expenditure is distributed across
diseases and comorbidities. The objective of this study was to use statistical methods to dis-
aggregate all publicly funded health expenditure by disease and comorbidities in order to
answer three research questions: (1) What is health expenditure by disease phase for non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) in New Zealand? (2) Is the cost of having two NCDs more
or less than that expected given the independent costs of each NCD? (3) How is total health
spending disaggregated by NCDs across age and by sex?
Methods and findings
We used linked data for all adult New Zealanders for publicly funded events, including hospi-
talisation, outpatient, pharmaceutical, laboratory testing, and primary care from 1 July 2007
to 30 June 2014. These data include 18.9 million person-years and $26.4 billion in spending
(US$ 2016). We used case definition algorithms to identify if a person had any of six NCDs
(cancer, cardiovascular disease [CVD], diabetes, musculoskeletal, neurological, and a
chronic lung/liver/kidney [LLK] disease). Indicator variables were used to identify the pres-
ence of any of the 15 possible comorbidity pairings of these six NCDs. Regression was used
to estimate excess annual health expenditure per person. Cause deletion methods were
used to estimate total population expenditure by disease. A majority (59%) of health expen-
diture was attributable to NCDs. Expenditure due to diseases was generally highest in the
year of diagnosis and year of death. A person having two diseases simultaneously generally
had greater health expenditure than the expected sum of having the diseases separately,
for all 15 comorbidity pairs except the CVD-cancer pair. For example, a 60–64-year-old
female with none of the six NCDs had $633 per annum expenditure. If she had both CVD

 and chronic LLK, additional expenditure for CVD separately was $6,443/$839/$9,225 for the
first year of diagnosis/prevalent years/last year of life if dying of CVD; additional expenditure
for chronic LLK separately was $6,443/$1,291/$9,051; and the additional comorbidity
expenditure of having both CVD and LLK was $2,456 (95% confidence interval [CI] $2,238–
$2,674). The pattern was similar for males (e.g., additional comorbidity expenditure for a
60–64-year-old male with CVD and chronic LLK was $2,498 [95% CI $2,264–$2,632]). In
addition to this, the excess comorbidity costs for a person with two diseases was greater at
younger ages, e.g., excess expenditure for 45–49-year-old males with CVD and chronic
LLK was 10 times higher than for 75–79-year-old males and six times higher for females. At
the population level, 23.8% of total health expenditure was attributable to higher costs of
having one of the 15 comorbidity pairs over and above the six NCDs separately; of the
remaining expenditure, CVD accounted for 18.7%, followed by musculoskeletal (16.2%),
neurological (14.4%), cancer (14.1%), chronic LLK disease (7.4%), and diabetes (5.5%).
Major limitations included incomplete linkage to all costed events (although these were
largely non-NCD events) and missing private expenditure.
Conclusions
The costs of having two NCDs simultaneously is typically superadditive, and more so for
younger adults. Neurological and musculoskeletal diseases contributed the largest health
system costs, in accord with burden of disease studies finding that they contribute large
morbidity. Just as burden of disease methodology has advanced the understanding of dis-
ease burden, there is a need to create disease-based costing studies that facilitate the dis-
aggregation of health budgets at a national level.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Few studies have estimated disease-specific health system expenditure for many diseases
simultaneously, keeping within the total envelope of health expenditure. Most cost of ill-
ness studies focus on a single or small set of disease(s) and overestimate costs due to
attribution of comorbidities.
• Few studies have estimated whether having two or more diseases increases or decreases
health system expenditure, over and above that expected from having the diseases
separately.
What did the researchers do and find?
• Using nationally linked health data for all New Zealanders, the additional or excess costs
from having one or more chronic diseases were calculated using regression equations.

 • Nearly a quarter of all health expenditure (23.8%) on chronic noncommunicable disease
was attributable to costs from having two or more diseases (i.e., costs due to comorbid
conditions, over and above separate costs from single diseases).
• Of the remaining three quarters of health expenditure, its attribution across six chronic
diseases (as though they were the only disease a person had) were: heart disease and
stroke, 18.7%; musculoskeletal, 16.2%; neurological, 14.4%; cancer, 14.1%; chronic lung,
liver, or kidney disease, 7.4%; and diabetes, 5.5%.
What do these findings mean?
• Health system expenditure due to musculoskeletal and neurological diseases is sizeable,
suggesting these diseases need more policy and planning consideration and research
than they currently receive.
• The additional costs from having two or more diseases, over and above the costs of hav-
ing disease separately, reinforce the need for policy and planning to anticipate the effects
of aging populations with comorbidity.
Introduction
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) has achieved the vision of a coherent and comparable set
of epidemiological estimates of disease-specific incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortal-
ity across all countries and since 1990 [1,2]. There are many reasons associated with planning
and comparative analysis that suggest it would also be worthwhile to pursue a similar vision of
national health system expenditure, disaggregating spending by disease in a manner compara-
ble across countries. The Organization of Economically Developed Countries has promulgated
such a vision under the rubric of national health system accounts that disaggregates total
health expenditure by disease [3], and within the United States, there have been proposals for
the creation of such accounts [4]. A comparable set of disease costs across multiple countries
would facilitate comparisons both over time within countries and between countries. Such
accounts would provide measures of disease burden that would generate a consistent set of
costs to use in cost of illness (COI) and cost-effectiveness studies. Achieving such a vision,
though, is challenging. Countries vary in the structuring of their health systems, and there is a
need for standardisation of methods across countries. Using the same disease classification sys-
tems and standardising, or at least accommodating differing boundaries of total health expen-
diture, is critical [5].
A key limitation of disease-specific COI studies that focus on a single or small set of disease
(s) is their tendency to overestimate costs due to attribution of comorbidities. If separate COI
studies are naively summed, overestimation of total expenditure is likely [4]. COI studies
including most/all diseases in a given country, constraining the total cost to the actual total
envelope of health expenditure, are protected against this double-counting problem. Whilst
such multiple or all-diseases COI studies are uncommon, the US has a reasonably long history
of such studies since the 1960s (e.g., [6] through to more recent studies [7,8]), and examples
are emerging in other countries (e.g., [5,9,10]). These studies are usually hybrids of top-down
disaggregation and bottom-up estimation using a range of individual-level data sets. However,

 we are not aware of any studies in which individuals are uniquely identified across multiple
data sets (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, pharmaceuticals, mortality, cancer registrations), allowing
identification of disease diagnosis, progression, and death (and how costs are aligned to disease
progression) and the identification of comorbidities within the same individual, linked to all
event and cost data.
Rosen and Cutler (2009) [4,11] outline three approaches to attributing costs to diseases: (1)
encounter based, (2) episode based, and (3) person based. Encounter based and episode based
both require each encounter or episode to be coded to a primary disease, with associated or
comorbid diseases as secondary codes. This coding is routinely undertaken for hospitalisation
in many countries but is unlikely to be available for primary care encounters and pharmaceuti-
cals (as many drugs are used for more than one disease). ‘Most cost of illness studies take an
encounter-based approach, assigning claims to disease buckets based upon their coded diag-
noses. Comorbidities are a major problem here; attributing each spending item for a patient
who is both hypertensive and diabetic is not easy’ (p. S10 [4]). Dieleman et al. (2017) have pro-
posed an extension to the encounter-based approach, merged with an attributable risk
approach, to determine base costs for each disease and outflows and inflows from comorbid
conditions [12]. However, this approach still requires primary and secondary diagnoses for
each event. In the person-based approach, all of a person’s total expenditure is regressed on
disease indicators and covariates: a model with no disease comorbidity interaction terms will
estimate the independent and unconfounded costs of each modelled disease; a model with
additional covariates for comorbidity interactions will estimate the greater (or lesser) costs of
having two or more diseases simultaneously, over and above that expected for having each dis-
ease separately.
In this study, we capitalise on national-level data tracking all publicly funded noncommu-
nicable disease (NCD) health events of uniquely identified individuals, over multiple years, in
New Zealand to estimate costs by disease. New Zealand is a high-income country with a bur-
den of NCDs similar to other high-income countries [2], although with less than average
healthcare spending per capita than other high-income countries (US$3,648 in purchasing
power parity–adjusted US dollars for 2015, compared with a population-weighted average of
$5,551 across all high-income countries) [13]. We extend previous work in two ways. First, we
attribute health expenditure (1) to mutually exclusive disease categories and (2) split into the
single-disease costs (i.e., the cost of disease as though comorbidities did not exist), and the dis-
ease comorbidity interactions to capture the impact of people having more than one disease
simultaneously.
The second extension is the estimation of costs by phase of disease progression. This
includes estimating the costs in year of diagnosis and year of death if dying of that disease.
These estimates are useful for subsequent simulation modelling of disease prevention and
treatment in cost-effectiveness research, as the differential timing of costs can be better mod-
elled. Our advances over previous national-level and multiple-disease COI studies may not be
replicable in many other countries due to data limitations, but we aim to generate a greater
depth of understanding to assist not only policy within New Zealand but also the generation of
approaches for multicountry COI studies.
We address three specific research questions:
1. What is health expenditure by disease phase for NCDs in New Zealand?
2. Is the cost of having two NCDs more or less than that expected given the independent costs
of each NCD?
3. How is total health spending disaggregated by NCDs across age and by sex?

 Materials and methods
Data
Publicly funded health events make up 82% of all health expenditure in New Zealand, and all
such events are assigned a unique personal health identifier, enabling events to be linked across
data sets and time by individual. These data have been assigned unit costs since 2007; in this
study we used data spanning financial years 2007/2008 to 2013/2014 (i.e., 1 July 2007 to 30
June 2014) for person-year observations among �25-year-olds to model costs, but we also use
data from previous years to determine if someone has prevalent disease(s) entering the study
period. The following national data sets were included: the National Minimum Data Set
(NMDS) for all inpatient events since 1990, the nonadmitted patient data set since 1998 (out-
patients), cancer registrations since 1995, retail pharmaceuticals since 2005, laboratory claims
since 2003, and general medical services claims since May 2000. Retail pharmaceuticals
exclude spending in the inpatient facility and are based on the fee schedule, although the gov-
ernment may pay less due to price negotiations. For 97%–98% of the population, we assigned
the primary care cost as given by the capitation bulk funding formula based on sex, age, ethnic-
ity, deprivation, and high-user status, while the remaining 2%–3% of the population were not
registered with a primary care provider and paid ‘fee for service’ transactions, which are cap-
tured in the data. For the included data sets, Ministry of Health cost weights were assigned to
each event [14], adjusted for inflation to 2016 real dollars, and then converted to US dollars
using the 2016 benchmark purchasing power parity of 1.450 from the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development (http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MEI_
PRICES, accessed 20 November 2017).
Data cleaning undertaken by the authors included ensuring same sex, date of birth, and
date of death; when an individual had multiple records and there was a disagreement, we used
data from the most authoritative source (e.g., mortality record if date of death) or most com-
monly given (e.g., female sex if on all but one record for a given individual).
Disease groupings and case definition
For this study, we used two distinct disease groupings. The first set, the aggregated disease set,
included the first five of eight disease groupings in the 1990–2013 New Zealand Burden of Dis-
ease Study (NZBDS) [15], namely cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes (which we
divided into CVD and diabetes separately), cancer, chronic lung/liver/kidney (LLK) disease,
neuropsychiatric conditions, and musculoskeletal conditions. The coding and capture of men-
tal events was not yet reliable in the study window, so we excluded psychiatric conditions and
had a neurological-only category. The three NZBDS groupings we did not model were as fol-
lows: other NCDs; maternal, neonatal, nutritional deficiency, and infectious disorders; and
injury. The second set of diseases used in this study were 13 disaggregated diseases, including
lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, and other cancers; ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and
other CVD; and chronic lung, chronic liver, and chronic kidney disease.
To determine if any of these diseases were prevalent before or were incident during the 1
July 2007 to 30 June 2014 costing window, a thorough case-finding algorithm was applied,
consistent with that used for the NZBDS (S1 Table). International Classification of Disease
(ICD) codes (primary and other) for events and disease-specific drug and laboratory testing
combinations were developed, disease by disease. For cancers, survival after diagnosis by 5
years for lung, 8 years for colorectal, 10 years for ‘other’ cancers, and 20 years for breast and
prostate resulted in that person being recoded as free of that cancer, based on statistical cure
times [16]. For all other disease, no remission was allowed (i.e., diagnosis was for the

 remainder of his or her life). Each disease was coded by phase as not present (reference cate-
gory), diagnosed in that financial year, died in that financial year of that disease, and otherwise
prevalent. Note, therefore, the costs for the first two categories are for people with an average
of 6 months in that state (but, for the diagnosis category, still including the time and costs for
events preceding the diagnosis date in the same financial year).
Modelling
We did not attempt to classify what healthcare spending was or was not related to each specific
disease. Rather, we used the established ‘excess’ or ‘net’ cost approach [17–20], using a statisti-
cal approach based on regression models, with total health system cost for each individual in
each financial year as the dependent variable and demographics, dummy variables for calendar
year, and disease and disease phase indicators as the independent variables. The coefficients
for the disease indicators are therefore estimates of the excess cost of having that disease phase
and are independent of other diseases (and comorbidities) in the model. The intercept term is
the health system cost not attributed to the diseases in the model (e.g., due to injuries, preven-
tive care, mental illness, maternity, etc.).
To model nonadditive costs associated with comorbidity, we interacted the disease indicators
in order to identify when an individual had both diseases. It was not possible to include all possi-
ble combinations of disease interactions in regression models due to the large number of inter-
action terms. Thus, we retained for regression modelling the disease phase indicators for each
disease as ‘main effects’ but only included all 15 comorbidity pair interactions formed by six dis-
eases (i.e., 6!/([6 − 2]! × 2!) = 15). For example, the cancer–CVD pair was coded ‘1’ for a person-
year observation for which the person had a diagnosis of both diseases, regardless of phase of
diagnosis (i.e., prevalent cancer with prevalent CVD was coded the same as first year of diagno-
sis of cancer with prevalent CVD). In regression modelling, the disease phase indicators and dis-
ease comorbidity pairs were all interacted with age and age squared, first centring age at the
midpoint of the 60–64-year-old age group, 62.5 years, and dividing by 10, so the age interaction
terms are interpretable in per 10-year units. Regression equations are detailed in S1 Appendix.
To prepare the data for regression modelling, we aggregated them into unique strata
formed by cross-classifying 5-year age groups by financial year, by the four levels of each dis-
ease (no diagnosis, diagnosed in that financial year, dying of that disease in that financial year,
otherwise prevalent with that disease). For the disaggregated 13 disease classifications, there
were 151,913 unique strata of these cross-classified categorical variables with at least one male
observation, and 139,717 unique strata for females. Between-person ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions were run on these aggregated data sets, with weights equal to the number of
observations in each stratum. The advantages of this approach included (1) aggregation reduc-
ing the skewness of data, (2) OLS coefficients were directly interpretable as excess costs, (3) the
total predicted expenditure (when applying coefficients back onto observations and summing
regression-predicted costs across all individuals) always gave the exact observed total expendi-
ture in the data sets, and (4) model-run time was considerably reduced compared with analy-
ses on unit-level data. We also trialled gamma regression on unit-level data, which had better
residual plots than OLS but overpredicted disease and total costs, causing us to prefer the
above OLS on aggregate data approach. Both because zero costs were so rare (0.09% of all per-
son-year observations) and previous work has found that for estimating averages, a one-part
model performs (nearly) as well as a two-part regression [21], we did not employ a two-step
process of first estimating individuals with zero expenditure.
Four sets of models were run: disease progression models (models with all the disease-spe-
cific phases) for either the aggregated (n = 6) or disaggregated (n = 13) disease groupings, but

 without comorbidity interactions; and both these models with the additional 15 disease
comorbidity pairs. Note that we retain the same 15 disease comorbidity pairs in the disaggre-
gated 13-disease model, as it was impractical to model and interpret the 78 possible comorbid-
ity pairs formed by 13 diseases.
As part of model fitting, we wanted to ensure that the intercept terms in the model and
regression-predicted costs by age using the models agreed to the annual expenditure in the
data for individuals with none of the disease modelled. There was good correspondence of
these predictions and those observed in the data for models including the disease comorbidity
pairs; however, predictions for models not including the comorbidity pairs underestimated
the costs among the nondiseased at younger ages (both OLS and gamma regressions) due to
strong disease–disease–age interactions. Therefore, for models without comorbidity pair inter-
actions, we rescaled all regression coefficients. First, we used the unscaled regression equations
to predict costs among those with any disease and compared this with their actual total cost in
the data set. We then used age-specific scalars for the disease coefficients in the model to return
the correct total cost of people with diseases. For example, if the sum of OLS regression pre-
dicted that costs of 50–54-year-olds with at least one disease was $200 million, but the actual
observed total cost for these same people was $180 million, then we rescaled all disease coeffi-
cients by 180/200 = 0.9 for this age group. Second, the reciprocal procedure was performed for
people without disease. Notably, no such scaling was needed for the better-fitted models with
the comorbidity pairs and their interactions, with age included.
Given age interactions, we present absolute estimates of disease expenditure for 60–
64-year-olds as the main results, with young (45–49 years) and old (75–79 years) estimates pre-
sented additionally in S4 Table and S5 Table. Actual regression coefficients are presented in
S3 Table, allowing interested readers to calculate excess costs for alternative groupings.
We present cause-deleted estimates, the estimates of spending without the presence of
comorbidities, by setting disease coefficients in the predictive equation to zero.
We undertook several robustness checks. First, for simpler models (six-disease, no disease
comorbidity pairs), an OLS general estimating equation (GEE) regression model on individ-
ual-level data was undertaken to allow for intraclass correlation due to up to 7 years of observa-
tion for each individual. Second, for simpler models we also ran (non-GEE) OLS regressions
on unit-level data. Third, all the above models use between-person comparisons, which may
be residually confounded by unobserved individual characteristics. Therefore, we also ran
fixed effects models that capitalise on within-individual changes in disease status to estimate
disease costs, removing potential time-invariant confounding [22].
Results
There were 18.9 million person-year observations for those 25 years and older between 1 July
2007 and 30 June 2014. A total of 7.1 million (37.7%) of these observations included at least
one NCD (Table 1). There was a total allocated expenditure across the 7 years of US$26.4 bil-
lion, of which $20.3 billion (77.0%) occurred among observations with at least one disease.
Regarding source, half or $13.1 billion arose from inpatient care and about a fifth from each of
outpatients and community pharmaceuticals.
Table 2 shows the observations and total expenditure by disease phase. People with neuro-
logical conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, CVD, and diabetes had the greatest number of
observations at 16.1%, 15.7%, 11.3%, and 7.5%, respectively, mostly as prevalent observations
(i.e., neither diagnosed nor dying in that observation year). People with CVD had the highest
total expenditure (43.1%), although this includes spending on additional diseases.

 Excess disease costs per person
Table 3 shows the modelled health system expenditure per person-year for 60–64-year-olds,
attributed to each disease phase, for both the aggregated and disaggregated-disease models, by
sex, without and with disease comorbidity pairs. The first row of the table results (‘No NCD’)
is the estimated expenditure for a 60–64-year-old with no NCDs; the next panel is the main
effects by disease phase for each of the 6 or 13 diseases; and the last panel is the expenditure
per year for the 15 comorbidity pairings, over and above that attributed to the diseases
independently.
When considering the aggregated-disease model for females, without comorbidity pairs
(FA model in Table 3), a 60–64-year-old without any of the six diseases was estimated to cost
the health system US$626 per year. If she had a cancer diagnosed in that year, her costs were
predicted to increase by $9,747 over and above the $626 base cost, by $9,815 if dying of cancer
in that year, or by $1,716 if living with a prevalent cancer. If she also had prevalent CVD, her
costs were predicted to increase a further $1,439.
Fig 1 shows these independent excess costs for both male and female 60–64-year-olds, for
the disaggregated-disease models (i.e., estimates for the MD and FD model columns of
Table 1). Excess costs in the year of diagnosis and year of death from that disease were higher
than prevalent costs. However, patterns differed by disease. For example, cancer and CVD

 excess costs in the year of diagnosis and last year of life were roughly similar, but diabetes costs
if dying of diabetes ($13,798 and $15,674, Table 1) were much higher than costs in the diagno-
sis year. Last year of life costs for chronic kidney disease were also notably high.
Excess costs for the disease comorbidity pairs were positive, with 95% confidence interval
(CI) excluding the null for all pairs across all models, except for cancer with each of CVD, dia-
betes, and LLK disease (bottom panel of Table 3). That is, the costs of having diseases jointly
was usually greater than the estimated summed costs for having the diseases independently

 (shown in the rest of Table 3). For example, using the male disaggregated-disease model
(model MDC in Table 3), a 60–64-year-old with both CVD and LLK disease was predicted to
cost $2,050 (95% CI $1,837–$2,263) more than that predicted based on the independent excess
costs due to CVD and LLK independently. Only 1 of the 60 comorbidity pairs (15 possible
pairs across four models) had a negative cost with the 95% CI excluding the null, namely the
cancer-CVD pair in the male disaggregated-disease model (−$484, 95% CI −$784 to −$240).
Whilst this in isolation may be a chance finding given the 60 pairs tested, this same cancer-
CVD pair had a negative cost for the male aggregated-disease model and female aggregated
and disaggregated models—but with 95% CI including the null.
There were significant interactions of age and age squared with most separate diseases and
disease comorbidity interactions (S3 Table). Because of these age interactions, excess costs
vary by age (S4 Table and S5 Table give estimates for 45–49- and 75–79-year-olds, respec-
tively). Two patterns were evident for independent disease costs: excess costs in the last year of
life were less with increasing age, and musculoskeletal and neurological excess disease costs
per person in the first year of diagnosis and prevalent cases were greater for 75–79-year-olds
than 45–49-year-olds. Regarding the disease comorbidity pairs, there was a strong pattern of
comorbidity costs being greater for 45–49-year-olds than 75–79-year-olds—often considerably
so (Fig 2). For example, excess expenditure for 45–49-year-old males with CVD and chronic
LLK was 10 times higher than for 75–79-year-olds, and six times higher for females. High
excess costs for comorbidity are notable for cancer and neurological, and CVD and LLK (espe-
cially at younger ages).

 Disease costs at population level
Total expenditure by disease costs is a function of the above per-person costs and how com-
mon the disease phases actually were (Table 2). Across the 7 years in the study, using the mod-
els without comorbidity interactions, the greatest excess expenditures were for neurological
(22.3%), CVD (21.2%), and musculoskeletal (20.8%) disease (Table 4). Fig 3 shows the attribu-
tion of this disease expenditure by sex and age. A greater area under the curve for females is
attributed to nonmodelled diseases at younger ages, consistent with maternity care not being

 included as an explicit category in the modelling. Noteworthy patterns include that neurologi-
cal and musculoskeletal costs were substantial at all ages, with neurological particularly notable
at younger ages for females; diabetes costs and female breast cancer costs were skewed more to
younger ages; and other CVD and IHD costs were considerably greater than stroke costs at all
ages.

 Using the models with the 15 comorbidity pairs, the independent disease costs reduced by
23.8% due to costs now being attributed to one of the 15 possible comorbidity pairs (Table 4).
Of this 23.8% comorbidity expenditure, the five comorbidity pairs including a neurological
condition contributed 60.7%, and the five pairs including musculoskeletal contributed 41.4%.
The comorbidity pair with the greatest contribution was neurological plus musculoskeletal
(18.1%), meaning the 9 out of 15 comorbidity pairs including either/both neurological and
musculoskeletal conditions explained 84.0% of additional health expenditure due to comor-
bidities at the population level (i.e., 60.7% + 41.4% − 18.1%; see S1 Fig for a breakdown of per-
centage comorbidity expenditure for each of the 15 comorbidity pairs).
Of the 76.2% of expenditure not captured by comorbidity pairs, CVD accounted for 18.7%,
followed by musculoskeletal (16.2%), neurological (14.4%), cancer (14.1%), chronic LLK dis-
ease (7.4%), and diabetes (5.5%; Table 4). The expenditure attributed to these six diseases inde-
pendently, when including comorbidity pairs relative to the model excluding comorbidity
pairs, varied by disease, ranging from 0.60 for diabetes (i.e., 40% of apparent independent
expenditure for diabetes can actually be attributed to superadditive costs arising from diabetes
coexisting with other diagnoses) to 0.92 for cancer (i.e., only 8% of apparent independent
expenditure on cancer can be attributed to comorbidity additive effects; last column of
Table 4).
Sensitivity analyses
The coefficients across the preferred aggregated data OLS models and the unit-level OLS and
GEE unit-level OLS regressions were identical (S6 Table). The standard errors were smallest
for unit-level OLS but more similar for aggregate OLS and GEE unit level. However, given the
size of the data sets and the usually sizeable health expenditures for diseases, most disease
excess costs are statistically significant, regardless. Fixed effects analyses that use within-person
variation (i.e., differences in expenditure between years, with and without disease, or with
varying disease phase) were in reasonable agreement with our preferred OLS regressions on
aggregate data (S2 Fig), given conceptual differences between the approaches and data limita-
tions (see S1 Appendix).
Discussion
Main findings and interpretation
This study estimates health system expenditure for many NCDs, by disease phase, for New
Zealand. We capitalised on linked health data with unique identifiers for the entire population
that track medical costs over multiple years. We used a regression approach to estimate the
excess cost to the health system from having a given disease. At the population level, we found
that 59% of all allocated health system expenditure was attributable to the included NCDs.
Attributing costs to separate disease groupings and not yet allowing for comorbidities, neuro-
logical diseases accounted for 22.3% of NCD expenditure, followed by CVD (21.2%), musculo-
skeletal (20.8%), cancer (15.1%), chronic LLK disease (11.5%), and diabetes (9.0%). We were
surprised by large costs due to neurological and musculoskeletal diseases; therefore, we plotted
in Fig 4 years of life lived with disability in New Zealand by sex, age, and disease, from GBD
data using the same disease categorisations for New Zealand, paralleling our Fig 3 for costs.
Other studies have found a correlation of health expenditure with years of life with disability
(YLDs) [9,10], although the correlation is even stronger with disability-adjusted life years. The
New Zealand neurological and musculoskeletal morbidity burdens stand out even more for
YLDs (Fig 4) than for costs (Fig 3), offsetting possible concerns that our costings for neurolog-
ical and musculoskeletal disease might be too high.

 How does this distribution of costs, ignoring comorbidities for now, compare with previous
studies? There is a body of work in the US using methods that attributed events to diseases—
not an excess costing approach using regression. For example, Dieleman and colleagues (2016)
attributed 16 years of health expenditure using multiple data sources in the US and found that
CVD contributed 11% of all health expenditure (12.5% in our New Zealand study, using the
total health expenditure as the denominator in Table 4), cancers 5.5% (New Zealand = 8.9%),
COPD 2.6% (4.9%), neurological 4.8% (13.2%), musculoskeletal 8.7% (12.3%), and diabetes
4.8% (5.3%) [8]. In another comparable study using a GBD grouping of diseases for Switzer-
land, Wieser and colleagues (2018) found that cancer contributed 6.0%, CVD 15.6%, diabetes
1.5%, neurological (including dementia) 3.7%, and musculoskeletal 13.4% [9]. Musculoskeletal
expenditure in New Zealand, at 12.3%, is intermediary between these US and Swiss percentage
estimates. Of note, in GBD 2016, New Zealand also had 1.31 times higher morbidity burden
for back pain and 1.84 times higher ‘other’ musculoskeletal than expected based on its level of
sociodemographic development [23]. This leaves the neurological category as the notable
‘stand-out’ high cost for New Zealand, perhaps due to both the range of disease and conditions
included (e.g., epilepsy, dementia, migraine) and the inclusive capture of people with at least
one neurological diagnosis (e.g., through the range of data sets and classifications; S1 Table).
Where our New Zealand study steps ahead of similar general COI studies is in further dis-
aggregating disease costs by phase and comorbidities, an advance that is possible due to all
health data sets being linked at the individual level. Disease costs were generally higher in the
year of diagnosis and the year of death if dying of that disease (Fig 1), consistent with our pre-
vious work on multiple cancers [24]. Costs in the year of death if dying from chronic kidney
disease, musculoskeletal, or diabetes were particularly prominent, ranging from $13,000 to
$30,000 (Fig 1). Dying-related costs from kidney disease, if also undergoing (failed) transplant
or renal dialysis, are high. Dying of diabetes per se, whilst uncommon compared with dying of
diseases elevated in risk by diabetes, is also expectedly expensive.
Regarding comorbidities, we find that the majority of comorbidity pairs increase costs
more than that expected based on having the same diseases separately (Table 3, Fig 1), and this
superadditive comorbidity cost was far more prominent at younger ages (Fig 2). Whilst we
have no direct evidence, it seems plausible that young people with comorbidities might be
treated more aggressively than old people with comorbidities or perhaps that young people
with comorbidities have more severe disease than their younger counterparts with just one dis-
ease. Further research to understand this this age variation in comorbidity expenditure is
warranted.
We estimated that 23.8% of all NCD health expenditure is attributable to these additional
increments of comorbidity, over and above the independent costs of having diseases separately.
Most previous COI studies analysing the impact of comorbidities have been from the perspec-
tive of one disease only, and its increased costs due to comorbid conditions (e.g., [25–27]). An
exception is Dieleman and colleagues (2017), who used encounter-level data with multiple ICD
codes recorded for each event, to quantify ‘inflows’ and ‘outflows’ between all comorbidities, to
reallocate health spending mutually exclusively [12]. This is a different approach to what we
took using a person-based excess costing approach to directly examine disease–disease interac-
tions based on diagnoses stated on any event linked for the same person, and quantify the inde-
pendent contributions of separate diseases and comorbidity pairs to total health expenditure.
We found that the majority of the 15 comorbidity pairs increased expenditure over and above
having the diseases separately. There was, however, evidence that having cancer and CVD
simultaneously reduced health expenditure compared to that expected from having the two dis-
eases separately. It is possible that a diagnosis of cancer means that treatments for other diseases
are down-prioritised, but this is speculation on our part.

 Strengths and limitations
There are limitations with our study. First, cost weights assigned to events may not have been
the exact price to hospitals or other fund managers. Second, whilst New Zealand has high-
quality linked heath data, it does not capture all costs. Private expenditure is estimated at 18%
of all health expenditure; future research could attempt to include this but will require addi-
tional data and assumptions about how this funding is distributed compared with public fund-
ing. For example, the great majority of NCDs are treated in public hospitals, but breast cancer
treatment and hip/knee replacement surgery are more commonly provided in the private sec-
tor. There are also missing costs due to support care services (e.g., rest home care of people
with dementia). We were unable to capture actual primary care usage by individuals on
national databases; rather, we just imputed an ‘expected’ cost based on the bulk funding for-
mula, and we will thus have underestimated disease costs somewhat, as people with the dis-
eases we captured will (presumably) be higher users of primary care. We also do not include
prevention costs. Nevertheless, we capture the majority of costs, and certainly enough costs to
confidently speak to patterns of cost by sex, age, disease, disease phase, and comorbidity pairs.
Future research should aim to improve these data, however.
Third, whilst we see the excess costing approach using regression modelling as a strength
overall, and it avoids the complexities of attributing each individual medical event to a disease,
it has limitations. People with diseases may be higher users of health services, regardless of
their disease—a form of time-invariant confounding. In fixed effects analyses exploiting
changes in costs within individuals (see S1 Appendix), we found broadly similar costs, sug-
gesting that time-invariant confounding is not too problematic. There may also be time-vary-
ing confounding, whereby people with a disease increase health services use for other reasons,
including increasing surveillance and preventive activities when engaged with the health sys-
tem. Fourth, addition of further comorbidity combinations (e.g., with mental illness) would
likely increase the proportion of all NCD health expenditure attributable to the superadditive
effect of comorbidities.
Potential implications for researchers, planners, and policy makers
So what for researchers and policy makers? There is a surprising lack of disease-attributed
costing studies involving multiple diseases at once. Governments and health systems managers
and funders can improve planning and prioritisation, knowing where the money goes. Also,
cost-effectiveness studies usually need costs by disease to model cost offsets from preventing
disease (presentations) and, conversely, the health systems costs from living longer in evalua-
tions using an unrelated disease costing approach [28,29]. Our analytical framework generates
these costs by disease phase for such cost-effectiveness modelling (e.g., [30]). We believe the
costing methods used in this paper can be applied elsewhere. For example, the OECD has as a
goal that national health expenditure be disaggregated by disease; this will require standardisa-
tion as best as possible of data and methods across countries, but given data variations across
countries, exact standardisation is unlikely. We therefore propose that an approach similar to
that used for estimating epidemiological parameters in the GBD may be useful [2,31]. Here,
one would build up from COI studies in multiple countries (e.g., [5]) and use country-level
parameters such as GPD, health system configuration, and such to build a model predicting
disease costs within an envelope of total health expenditure given by a system of national
health accounts. Our paper and methods may help in that the regression models built within a
given (or few) country predict the relative expenditure by disease—which could be merged
with the population demography, disease epidemiology, and total health expenditure of
another country to at least provide an initial costing.

 Finally, any national costing study will be dependent on the data available and methods
used. That said, we suspect that the general patterns of these results (i.e., of comorbidity
impacts being superadditive) for New Zealand are likely to be generalisable to other high-
income countries. The methods we applied in this paper could be applied elsewhere to test for
such generalisability—or not—of comorbid costs.
