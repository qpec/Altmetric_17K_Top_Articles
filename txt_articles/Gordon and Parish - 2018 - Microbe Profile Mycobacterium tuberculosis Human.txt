Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an expert and deadly pathogen, causing the disease tuberculosis (TB) in humans. It has several
notable features: the ability to enter non-replicating states for long periods and cause latent infection; metabolic remodelling
during chronic infection; a thick, waxy cell wall; slow growth rate in culture; and intrinsic drug resistance and antibiotic
tolerance. As a pathogen, M. tuberculosis has a complex relationship with its host, is able to replicate inside macrophages,
and expresses diverse immunomodulatory molecules. M. tuberculosis currently causes over 1.8 million deaths a year,
making it the world’s most deadly human pathogen.

TAXONOMY
Phylum: Actinobacteria; Class: Actinobacteria; Order: Acti-
nomycetales; family: Mycobacteriaceae; Genus: Mycobacte-
rium; Species: M. tuberculosis.
PROPERTIES
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing, chemo-
organotrophic,
non-motile,
non-spore-forming,
aerobic
bacillus. Under optimal laboratory conditions at 37
�C,
M. tuberculosis doubles every 24 h, taking approximately
3 weeks to form buff-coloured, rough colonies on agar
plates. It is visualized via the Ziehl–Neelsen acid-fast stain
whereby its thick, waxy cell wall retains carbol fuschin stain
in the face of acid-alcohol washes. Biochemical tests, includ-
ing positive niacin production and the ability to reduce
nitrate, are used to differentiate it from other mycobacteria,
although these have been superseded in many cases by
PCR-based analysis of specific genetic loci.
GENOME
M. tuberculosis H37Rv was the first mycobacterium to be
genome sequenced [1], revealing a 4.4 Mb genome encod-
ing 4018 genes and a high GC% content of 65.9 %. Major
findings included the discovery of two large protein fami-
lies with over 160 members that present conserved N-ter-
minal domains containing either proline-glutamine (PE)
or proline-proline-glutamine (PPE) and variable C-termi-
nal domains. PE and PPE proteins have diverse functions,
with distinct members playing roles in lipid metabolism,
cell wall architecture and immune modulation. Over 9 %
of the genome’s coding capacity is dedicated to lipid
metabolism, underlining the metabolic demands for syn-
thesis of the complex, lipid-rich mycobacterial cell wall as
well as the exploitation of host lipids for in vivo carbon
sources. Five ESX Type VII secretion systems are present
and involved in secretion of PE/PPE proteins, virulence
effectors, T-cell antigens and metal homeostasis. Genome-
wide mutagenesis studies have identified ~600 genes that
are essential for M. tuberculosis growth in vitro [2], with
numerous other studies suggesting conditionally-essential
genes for other conditions.
PHYLOGENY
M. tuberculosis is the type strain of the M. tuberculosis
complex (MTBC), the group of mycobacterial pathogens
that cause TB in mammalian species. The MTBC also
includes the human pathogen M. africanum, as well as ani-
mal-adapted strains M. microti, M. pinnipedii, M. orygis,
M. mungii, M. caprae and M. bovis. Comparative genomic
analyses revealed low sequence diversity and clonal evolu-
tion across the MTBC, with the sequential loss of regions
of difference (RD) suggesting an evolutionary scenario that
places M. tuberculosis closest to the common ancestor of
the MTBC. Whole genome sequencing of global M. tuber-
culosis populations has revealed seven major lineages
with distinct geographical localization that reflect human
migration patterns [3]. Estimates for the age of the most
recent common ancestor of the MTBC vary from 70 000,
based
on genome
analysis
of extant
strains [3], to
<6000 years ago using ancient DNA extracted from Peru-
vian and Hungarian mummies with characteristic TB
lesions.
KEY FEATURES AND DISCOVERIES
M. tuberculosis was first described as the causative agent of
tuberculosis by Robert Koch in 1882 – on 24th March
(now World TB Day) [4]. M. tuberculosis is an extraordi-
narily successful pathogen with a long history of afflicting
humans. Disease progression is a complex process, with
only a small proportion of people exposed becoming
infected, and of those the majority having latent infection
during which the bacteria may persist for decades in a
metabolically inactive, or slowly replicating, state. Esti-
mates are that almost 2 billion people are latently infected,
providing a global reservoir of infection. Infection nor-
mally results in granuloma formation around the initial
focus of infection, and can lead to caseous lesions and cav-
ity formation in active disease. Several complex regulatory
programs
mediated
by
master
genetic
regulators
are
involved in switching into this non-replicating state that
can persist for long periods of time.
During infection, the basic metabolism of M. tuberculosis
is geared towards utilization of fatty acids such as choles-
terol, and hence the glyoxylate shunt becomes important
for in vivo survival. Although M. tuberculosis is a proto-
troph, it is likely that a range of metabolites are available
to be scavenged during infection, and some acquisition
systems, such as the iron siderophore mycobactin, are well
characterized.
The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is characteristic of the
mycobacteria; although classified as Gram-positive, it has
a structure similar to that of Gram-negative bacteria with
a second ‘outer membrane’ containing the mycolic acids –
long-chain, branched fatty acids. The layer outside the
cytoplasmic membrane forms a major complex, with the
core comprising peptidoglycan linked to arabinogalactan,
in turn linked to the mycolic acids (mAGP complex) [5].
In addition to imparting many important characteristics
such as relative impermeability to antibiotics, the cell wall
contains myriad immunomodulatory molecules including
lipoarabinomannan, sulpholipids and phthiocerol dimcyo-
cerosate. Cord factor (trehalose dimycolate) is required
for
virulence
and
responsible
for
the
characteristic
growth of M. tuberculosis in culture as long, snake-like
cords. The elaborate cell wall is however the Achilles heel
of the bacillus, since its synthesis is the target of several
frontline
anti-tubercular
drugs
(isoniazid,
ethambutol,
ethionamide).
A defining feature of M. tuberculosis is its slow growth rate.
While the metabolic reasons underlying slow growth are
not fully understood, it may be due to a combination of: the
presence of only a single rRNA operon; the complex

synthetic requirements of the cell wall; nutrient uptake; and
a slow rate of DNA replication.
OPEN QUESTIONS
Many basic questions still perplex mycobacteriologists,
including:
.
What were the key steps in the evolution of M. tubercu-
losis as a human pathogen?
.
What pathogen factors are essential to establish latent
infection and ultimate disease?
.
Is the slow killing of M. tuberculosis by bactericidal anti-
biotics simply related to its slow growth, or are other
factors responsible?
.
What is the physiological state of M. tuberculosis
during infection? What are the key metabolites
that M. tuberculosis scavenges from
the host?
.
How can we optimally mine M. tuberculosis to identify
novel antigens for the next generation of diagnostics
and vaccines?
