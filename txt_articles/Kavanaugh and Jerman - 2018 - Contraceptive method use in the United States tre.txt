Abstract
Objective—The objective was to examine levels of, correlates of and changes in the use of 
individual and grouped methods of contraception among US females aged 15–44 from 2008 to 
2014.
Study design—Using three rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth, we analyzed 
samples of 12,279 (2008), 5601 (2012) and 5699 (2014) females. We conducted simple and 
multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify associations between demographic 
characteristics and contraceptive use, as well as between characteristics and changes in use 
patterns.
Results—In terms of overall trends in contraceptive use between 2008 and 2014, there was no 
significant change in the proportion of women who used a method among either all women (60%) 
or those at risk of unintended pregnancy (90%). Significant changes in use occurred among six 
methods. The largest increase in use was among users of long-acting reversible contraceptive 
(LARC) methods, including the intrauterine device and implant — from 6% to 14% — across 
almost all population groups of female contraceptive users, while the largest decrease occurred 
among users of sterilization — from 37% to 28% — with lower-income women driving the 
decline in female sterilization and higher-income women driving the decline in a partner’s 
sterilization as a primary method. Moderate increases were seen in the use of withdrawal and 
natural family planning.
Conclusion—Most shifts in recent contraceptive use have occurred among the most effective 
methods — sterilization and LARCs. Differences in method-specific user characteristics 
underscore the importance of ensuring full access to the broad range of methods available.
Implications—The lack of change in the overall use of contraceptives among women at risk for 
unintended pregnancy may have implications for the extent to which further declines in national 
rates of unintended pregnancy can be expected.

 1. Introduction
Surveillance of contraceptive method use in the United States is important for several 
reasons. First, the rate of unintended pregnancy declined 18% between 2008 and 2011, from 
54 per 1000 women aged 15–44 to 45 per 1000 [1]. Available evidence suggests that more 
effective contraceptive use over time — more consistent and correct use of methods, 
increased proportions of users switching to more effective methods or both — may have 
contributed to recent declines in unintended pregnancy [1]. There is evidence of both of 
these trends in prior reports of method use among all US women. Between 2007 and 2012, 
the overall proportion of women using contraception remained the same, while the 
percentage of contraceptive users using the most effective and long-acting reversible 
methods, including the intrauterine device (IUD) and implant, increased from 4% to 12% 
[2-5]. There is also new evidence that contraceptive failure rates have improved, which could 
mean that methods are being used more consistently and correctly [6].
Second, 95% of unintended pregnancies occur among women who either use their method 
inconsistently or incorrectly, or use no method at all [7]. Observing trends in and patterns of 
contraceptive use, nonuse and method type in the population, as well as associated user 
characteristics, improves our understanding of unintended pregnancy risk in the United 
States. Additionally, surveillance may help elucidate how behaviors and method preferences 
change over time within changing policy and societal contexts. This information may be 
used to inform clinical guidelines for method provision and patient education and to address 
barriers to use and access.
Third, a better understanding of the mix of methods currently being used may offer insight 
into enabling autonomy in method choice for women to access and use the method that best 
suits their needs. Although long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods such as the 
IUD and implant have received considerable attention in recent years [8,9], patient-centered 
models of care underscore the need to understand LARC use within the broader mix of all 
methods used. Ongoing research is needed to assess trends among all methods, specifically 
examining the intersection of economic and policy factors on method choice and access. For 
example, while research has shown that women use and discontinue select methods based on 
features of those methods, including side effects, effectiveness and ease of use [10,11], 
method use is also constrained by access to and quality of family planning services and the 
legacy of discrimination in health care settings [12-15]. Given the implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2013 as well as subsequent challenges to health care reform, 
efforts to understand contraceptive use in the changing health care and insurance 
environment are also timely.
This study focuses on use of contraception overall as well as individual method use and 
examines short- and long-term changes in trends, highlighting the changes between 2008 
and 2014 for longer-term changes and between 2012 and 2014 to understand change in the 
context of the ACA implementation. We assess changes in method use among all 
contraceptive users by demographic characteristics between 2008 and 2014 and 
characteristics associated with use of specific methods in 2014.

 2. Methods
Data for this cross-sectional, descriptive study come from the female respondent files of the 
2006–2010, 2011–2013 and 2013–2015 National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFGs). The 
NSFG uses a multistage probability sampling design that oversamples Black and Hispanic 
groups and teenagers aged 15–19. These in-home, face-to-face interviews of men and 
women aged 15–44 in the household population of the United States, including persons 
temporarily living away from the household in a college dormitory, sorority or fraternity, 
provide the most comprehensive nationally representative information available on 
contraceptive use in the United States. More detailed information on survey methodology, 
sample design, response rates, fieldwork procedures and variance estimation is published 
elsewhere [16], and the data are deidentified and publicly available for download on the 
NSFG website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm). Institutional review board approval was 
not required for this analysis of secondary data.
Weights were available for both of the 2-year periods of interviews spanning 2011–2015, 
that is, September 2011 to September 2013 and September 2013 to September 2015. 
Analyses are presented using the midpoint of each time period as the reference year (2008, 
2012 and 2014). The samples are made up of 12,279 (2006–2010), 5601 (2011–2013) and 
5699 (2013–2015) females aged 15–44.
We examined use of specific and grouped methods and nonuse, as well as changes in the 
mix of methods used, between 2008 and 2014 for longer-term changes and between 2012 
and 2014 to assess changes in the context of ACA implementation. Because there was no 
change over time in the proportion of women at risk of unintended pregnancy who were not 
using a method, we focus primarily on prevalence and change in method use among 
contraceptive users rather than among all women at risk of unintended pregnancy [a]. 
Current contraceptive use is defined as the use of any contraceptive method during the 
month of the interview based on the CONSTAT1 recode in the NSFG dataset. Of note, this 
analysis presents the primary method used for pregnancy prevention, as determined by the 
most effective method reported, rather than taking into account possible multiple methods 
used. Specific methods included in this analysis include female and male contraceptive 
sterilization; IUD; implant; pill; other hormonal methods such as the ring, patch or 
injectables; condom; withdrawal; natural family planning methods and other coital methods 
(diaphragm, foam, sponge, suppositories and jelly). Following guidelines published by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we grouped methods according to effectiveness 
and also included a summary group of “most or moderately effective methods,” including 
LARCs, pills and other hormonals, in the calculation of overall trends in use [17]. 
Respondents who indicated that they were sterile by nonsurgical or noncontraceptive 
surgical means were omitted from this analysis.
aWe also ran all trend analyses in Tables 1 and 2 among women at risk of unintended pregnancy (women who had had sexual 
intercourse in the 3 months prior to interview who were not pregnant or trying to conceive and women who were not sterile for 
noncontraceptive reasons) and found few differences in findings between this population and among contraceptive users, further 
supporting our decision to focus on contraceptive users as our population of interest for Tables 1-3.

 Independent variables include demographic and sexual and reproductive health 
characteristics that may be associated with contraceptive method use. Characteristics include 
age, race and ethnicity, income as a percentage of the federal poverty level, nativity, 
relationship status, education, health insurance coverage, parity and number of future births 
expected.
For each of the three time points, we tabulated three sets of statistics: first, the proportion of 
all women who used any method; second, the proportion of all women at risk of unintended 
pregnancy who used any method; and third, the proportion of all contraceptive method users 
by method type. To examine change in use over time, we merged the three data sets and 
weighted each time period accordingly. We then used bivariate logistic regression to test for 
significant differences in the proportions of use of contraception overall and of individual 
methods between 2008 and 2014 and between 2012 and 2014 to demonstrate both long- and 
short-term trends.b Next, we tabulated the proportion of all contraceptive users by selected 
characteristics in 2008 and 2014 and used logistic regression to test for significant 
differences between the two reference years for all population groups. For methods for 
which significant changes in use occurred between 2008 and 2014, we present significant 
differences in use by characteristics between the two time points at p<.05 in the tables, but 
for the more detailed analyses examining characteristics associated with method use, we 
describe only those findings that were significant at p<.01 in the text.
For each individual contraceptive method, we used multivariable logistic regression to 
estimate adjusted odds ratios for the relationship between demographic and sexual and 
reproductive health characteristics and current contraceptive method use among all 
contraceptive users in 2014 in order to understand factors that influence use when 
controlling for multiple simultaneous characteristics. Each model began with all independent 
variables; after each iteration of a backward stepwise elimination process, we conducted 
Wald tests for each independent variable at p>.1 in the full model to determine if its 
inclusion affected the model. If the Wald test was not significant at p<.05, the variable was 
omitted from the model. All multivariable models included age, race/ethnicity and poverty 
status regardless of significance due to their theoretical relevance to the models. Age 
categories were consolidated for the multivariable models due to insufficiently large cell 
sizes. Online supplemental tables present these same findings for the remaining methods for 
which there was no significant change in use between 2008 and 2014.
All analyses were conducted using the “svy” command prefix within Stata 14.1 to account 
for the NSFG’s use of a multistage probability sample.
3. Results
Between 2008 and 2014, there were no significant changes in the overall proportion of 
women who used a contraceptive method both among all women and among women at risk 
of unintended pregnancy (Table 1). During this time period, approximately 60% of all 
bWe used logistic regression rather than t tests to test differences in contraceptive use over time due to the smaller standard errors 
achieved with the former approach.

 women were currently using some form of contraception, and approximately 90% of women 
at risk of unintended pregnancy were using one. There were, however, some notable changes 
in the types of methods used among women using some form of contraception during 2008–
2014. The largest increase occurred among LARC users; only 6% of women using 
contraception used an IUD or implant as their primary method in 2008, but this increased to 
12% in 2012 and 14% in 2014. Simultaneously, the largest decreases were seen in the use of 
sterilization, including both male and female sterilization, declining from 37% of all users in 
2008 to 28% in 2014. More moderate increases occurred in use of withdrawal and natural 
family planning during this time period. Within larger groupings of methods by 
effectiveness, most of the trends in use between 2008 and 2014 were echoed in the most 
recent time period from 2012 to 2014, with the exception of a significant increase in the use 
of all coital methods, which occurred only in the most recent time period from 2012 to 2014 
and was driven largely by an increase in withdrawal as a primary method and a parallel 
decrease in the group of most or moderately effective methods from 2012 to 2014. Over the 
full time period from 2008 to 2014, the top three most common methods among 
contraceptive users have remained the pill, female sterilization and the condom, but the IUD 
supplanted male sterilization as the fourth most common method in 2014.
Significant changes in the use of individual methods between 2008 and 2014 have been 
driven in part by changes in contraceptive use among specific demographic subgroups over 
time (Table 2). Decreases in the use of female sterilization were driven primarily by 
decreases in use among women who were ages 25–29, were non-Hispanic Black, had lower 
income, and were not married or cohabiting. Decreases in overall use of male sterilization 
(by a partner) occurred primarily among women who were ages 25–29, were non-Hispanic 
white, had the highest income, were married, were more educated, were covered by private 
insurance, had given birth to 1 or 2 children, and expected no future births.
Significant increases in use of the IUD and implant, on the other hand, occurred across 
almost all populations of women regardless of characteristic. Increases in the use of 
withdrawal occurred among women who were between the ages 25 and 29, were non-
Hispanic white, had high income, were cohabiting, had the highest education, were using 
private insurance, had had 1–2 births and expected no future births. Small increases in the 
overall use of natural family planning over time were driven primarily by women ages 25–
29, born in the United States, who had never given birth and who expected 1 to 2 future 
births.
In multivariable analyses adjusting for key demographic and sexual and reproductive health 
indicators in 2014, predictors of method use differed depending on the specific method 
(Table 3). The strongest predictors of female sterilization use were increasing age and parity, 
while lower levels of female sterilization were associated with higher income levels and 
increased education. Older women and women with higher incomes had increased odds of 
relying on their partner being sterilized, and nonmarried women were less likely to do so. 
Women with higher education levels and who had given birth had increased odds of being 
IUD users, while ages 35 and older were associated with lower levels of IUD use. Older 
ages were associated with decreased odds of implant use in 2014 as compared to women 
ages 15–24.

 Being in the highest income bracket, being born outside of the United States, cohabiting, 
having at least a high school level education and expecting 1–2 future children were all 
associated with increased likelihood of using withdrawal as one’s primary method. Women 
ages 35 and older and those who expected to have 3 or more (additional) births had 
increased odds of using natural family planning methods, while those who were not married 
or cohabiting had decreased odds.
4. Discussion
Over the past decade, shifts in the use of contraceptive methods have occurred, including 
changes in the methods being used as well as in the characteristics of method users. 
Although overall use did not change between 2008 and 2014 and 90% of women at risk of 
unintended pregnancy are using some form of contraception, shifts in the mix of methods 
used have likely played a role in the decreasing rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion 
at the national level [1,18].
The increase in the use of the IUD and implant has not paralleled a decrease in nonuse of 
contraception, indicating that the majority of this increase can be attributed to women who 
were already contraceptive users changing methods. The increase in LARC use also 
parallels a decrease in sterilization. For the most part, women are changing method type 
within the group of most or moderately effective methods and not shifting from less effective 
to more effective methods, with the notable exception of the increase in withdrawal during 
this time period.
Withdrawal is in the lowest tier of effectiveness of methods, suggesting that some women 
(especially women with higher incomes and those born outside of the United States) may be 
prioritizing other factors — such as autonomy, user control over one’s method or sexual 
acceptability — over effectiveness when selecting a method that is best for them [19,20]. 
Although these women are at risk of unintended pregnancy, they may be more ambivalent 
about becoming pregnant [21] or they may have greater resources available to them to 
manage an unintended pregnancy should one occur. Increased attention in the popular media 
on withdrawal over the past few years may also be contributing to higher rates of reporting 
this as a pregnancy prevention method [22,23].
During the time period covered by these data, the ACA was phased into implementation (in 
2013), which included a provision for full coverage of all female-controlled contraceptive 
methods with no cost-sharing. Studies have produced mixed evidence regarding the 
relationship between the implementation of the ACA and contraceptive use patterns [24-27]. 
The role that the contraceptive coverage guarantee played in impacting use of contraception 
at the national level remains unclear, as there was no significant increase in the use of 
methods that would have been covered under the ACA (most or moderately effective 
methods) during the most recent time period (2012–2014) excepting small increases in 
implant use. Prior to the implementation of the ACA, many women were able to access 
contraceptive methods at low or no cost through publicly funded family planning centers and 
Medicaid; existence of these safety net programs may have dampened any impact that the 
ACA could have had on contraceptive use [28]. In addition, cost is not the only barrier to

 accessing a full range of method options; for example, women who consistently use options 
not covered by the contraceptive coverage guarantee — like condoms and withdrawal — 
may be satisfied with their choice and not want to switch to a form of contraception that 
requires a health care visit.
We found patterns in the characteristics of users of specific methods in 2014. When all other 
user characteristics were taken into account, income was associated only with increased use 
of male sterilization and withdrawal and decreased use of female sterilization. It is 
noteworthy that an opposite pattern occurs between users of female sterilization versus those 
who rely on their partner’s sterilization in terms of income levels; factors at the systems, 
provider and patient levels all likely contribute to this marked difference [29]. The fact that 
income is not associated with use of most other methods obtained through health care 
settings may reflect broader access to affordable and/or free contraception made possible 
through programs such as Title X [24].
Several limitations are inherent in the analysis of cross-sectional data. Associations observed 
between respondent characteristics and contraceptive method use do not necessarily imply a 
causal relationship. Of note, contraceptive method use in our analysis represents the most 
effective method reported. As such, use of more than one method is not captured in this 
analysis, despite recent evidence indicating small increases in the use of multiple methods 
[30,31], and less effective methods that may be used in conjunction with more effective 
methods, such as condom and withdrawal, may be underrepresented. Finally, demographics 
of the overall population may have changed over the time period covered in these analyses; 
given associations between some key demographic characteristics and use of certain 
methods, changes in the profiles of method users may reflect, in part, underlying changes in 
population demographics.
The extent to which the recent declines in unintended pregnancy will continue is unclear and 
will be at least partially dependent upon access to and use of effective contraception. We 
continue to document no change in the overall use of contraception among women at risk for 
unintended pregnancy, a population who could potentially reap some of the greatest benefits 
in reductions in unintended pregnancy through uptake of contraception. Because women’s 
primary reasons for not using contraception are not method specific (such as not thinking 
that they could become pregnant and not minding if they did become pregnant [21]), efforts 
to support women at risk of unintended pregnancy should be comprehensive in scope, as 
focusing too narrowly on the uptake of any one particular method may be a disservice to 
women. Importantly, findings highlighting differences in the profiles of users by method 
underscore the importance of ensuring full access, i.e., with no cost barriers as through the 
ACA, to the broad range of methods available. However, expectations of reduced federal 
support for family planning services through funding programs and through repeal of the 
ACA leave recent sexual and reproductive health gains in question. Women use different 
contraceptive methods at different times during their reproductive years, and their choice of 
method is determined by a variety of factors [19]. Ensuring that women can select a method 
based solely on characteristics that they personally prioritize rather than external factors that 
may influence choice of a particular method over another is a key tenet of women-centered 
reproductive health care. Use of contraception is a key driver of a diverse set of positive

 outcomes for women’s health and socioeconomic well-being, and ensuring access for all 
women to the full range of contraceptive methods is high priority to sustain these positive 
outcomes.

aWomen at risk of unintended pregnancy include women who had had sexual intercourse in the 3 months prior to interview, women who were not pregnant or trying to conceive and women who were not 
sterile for noncontraceptive reasons.
bOther methods include the diaphragm, foam, sponge, suppositories, jelly/cream and “other methods” as indicated by the CONSTAT1 variable in the NSFG documentation.

The year 2014 represents the midpoint of the data collection years for the 2013–2015 NSFG survey. Each model began with all independent variables presented in Table 2; after each iteration of a backward 
stepwise elimination process, we conducted Wald tests for each independent variable at p>.1 in the full model to determine if its inclusion affected the model. If the Wald test was not significant at p<.05, 
the variable was omitted from the model. All multivariable models included age, race/ethnicity and poverty status regardless of significance due to their theoretical relevance to the models. Age categories 
were consolidated for the multivariable models due to insufficiently large cell sizes. We report in text characteristics associated with method use in 2014 that are significant at p<.01. aOR, adjusted odds 
ratio.
