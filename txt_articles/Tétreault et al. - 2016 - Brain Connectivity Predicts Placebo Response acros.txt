Abstract
Placebo response in the clinical trial setting is poorly understood and alleged to be driven
by statistical confounds, and its biological underpinnings are questioned. Here we identified
and validated that clinical placebo response is predictable from resting-state functional
magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) brain connectivity. This also led to discovering a brain
region predicting active drug response and demonstrating the adverse effect of active drug
interfering with placebo analgesia. Chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain patients (n = 56)
underwent pretreatment brain scans in two clinical trials. Study 1 (n = 17) was a 2-wk sin-
gle-blinded placebo pill trial. Study 2 (n = 39) was a 3-mo double-blinded randomized trial
comparing placebo pill to duloxetine. Study 3, which was conducted in additional knee OA
pain patients (n = 42), was observational. fMRI-derived brain connectivity maps in study 1
were contrasted between placebo responders and nonresponders and compared to
healthy controls (n = 20). Study 2 validated the primary biomarker and identified a brain
region predicting drug response. In both studies, approximately half of the participants
exhibited analgesia with placebo treatment. In study 1, right midfrontal gyrus connectivity
best identified placebo responders. In study 2, the same measure identified placebo
responders (95% correct) and predicted the magnitude of placebo’s effectiveness. By sub-
tracting away linearly modeled placebo analgesia from duloxetine response, we uncovered
in 6/19 participants a tendency of duloxetine enhancing predicted placebo response, while
in another 6/19, we uncovered a tendency for duloxetine to diminish it. Moreover, the
approach led to discovering that right parahippocampus gyrus connectivity predicts drug
analgesia after correcting for modeled placebo-related analgesia. Our evidence is consis-
tent with clinical placebo response having biological underpinnings and shows that the
method can also reveal that active treatment in some patients diminishes modeled pla-
cebo-related analgesia.

 Author Summary
Placebo response is extensively studied in healthy subjects and for experimental manipula-
tions. However, in the clinical setting it has been primarily relegated to statistical con-
founds. Here, for the first time we examine the predictability of future placebo response in
the clinical setting in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain. We examine resting-state
functional magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) brain connectivity prior to the start of the
clinical trial and in the setting of neutral instructions regarding treatment. Our results
show that clinical placebo pill ingestion shows stronger analgesia than no treatment and is
predictable from resting state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, and right
midfrontal gyrus degree count (extent of functional connectivity) identifies placebo pill
responders in one trial and can be validated (95% correct) in the placebo group of a second
trial, but not in the active drug treatment (duloxetine) group. By modeling the expected
placebo response in subjects receiving active drug treatment, we uncover a placebo-cor-
rected drug response predictive brain signal and show that in some subjects the active
drug tends to enhance predicted placebo response, while in others it interferes with it.
Together, these results provide some evidence for clinical placebo being predetermined by
brain biology and show that brain imaging may also identify a placebo-correctedpredic-
tion of response to active treatment.
Introduction
Positive medical responses to placebo treatments are a well-recognizedphenomenon observed
in many pathologies, with a higher prevalence for neurological and painful conditions [1,2].
Placebo analgesia is observedubiquitously in pain treatment trials, especially in chronic pain
populations, in which it often exhibits sustained effectiveness rivaling in magnitude that of the
active treatment [3–5]. Yet, interpretation of placebo response in clinical observations remains
questionable because of experimental design weaknesses, as repeatedly pointed out in the past
[6–8]. So far, brain markers for placebo pain relief have been mostly studied for acute pain in
the healthy population [9–13], in which individual subject responses seem highly variable and
prone to a multiplicity of influences [12]. Accumulating evidence indicates that neuroimaging
findings of certain brain measures (neuromarkers or neural signatures) can predict acute pain
perception [14], development of chronic pain [15], future learning [16], intelligence [17], and
responses to pharmacological or behavioral treatments [18]. Because placebo response is
believed to be driven by central nervous system mechanisms involved in expectation and infer-
ence about previous experience [11,12,19–22], it is reasonable to presume that specific brain
measures may predispose individuals to a placebo response. Recent neuroimaging [13,21,23]
and genetic polymorphism [24] studies show results consistent with this hypothesis.
Given the enormous societal toll of chronic pain [25], being able to predict placebo respond-
ers in a chronic pain population could both help the design of personalized medicine and
enhance the success of clinical trials [6,26]. In patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis pain
(OA), we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) combined with a
standard clinical trial design to derive an unbiased brain-based neurological marker to predict
analgesia associated with placebo treatment. We hypothesized that brain regional network
information sharing (functional connectivity) properties should identify the placebo response.
We reasoned that if we could uncover a brain marker prior to the start of the trials that fore-
casts how individual subjects will perform during these trials, then we could conclude that clin-
ical placebo response, at least for sugar pill ingestion, is a predetermined brain process

 controlling the placebo response and with biological underpinnings useful in clinical decision
making. After identifying and validating a brain connectivity-basedplacebo predictor derived
from rs-fMRI scans before the start of treatment, we linearly modeled a predicted placebo
response and applied it to the active drug treatment portion of the study. With this approach,
we identified a brain region where functional connectivity was predictive of drug treatment
response presumed to be minimally dependent on the influence of placebo. This procedure in
turn uncovered the adverse effect of active treatment interfering with predicted placebo
response.
Results
We sought to identify a neurological signature for analgesia associated with placebo treatment
in an unbiased setting. To this end, all brain imaging scans were done before the start of the
clinical trials, and we studied rs-fMRI to interrogate and capture ongoing baseline brain infor-
mation sharing properties (functional connectivity-baseddegree counts; the degree count for a
given brain location is the number of voxels zero-lag correlated with this brain location above a
threshold, where threshold is subject specific and determined to maintain a fixed whole-brain
connectivity density; see Methods) in the absence of any manipulations of expectancies for
pain relief. This design enables posing the question: to what extent is clinical placebo response
predetermined by initial brain physiology and thus predictable? Placebo- or drug treatment-
associated analgesia was tracked in knee OA pain patients in the setting of standard clinical tri-
als designed to assess the efficacyof analgesics. All participating patients received the same
standard instructions—i.e.,that they would receive either placebo or a standard-of-care active
treatment. Study 1 (n = 17; see Fig 1 and S1 Table for study design and demographics) was sin-
gle blinded (subjects were unaware of whether they were receiving active treatment or placebo);
all participants received placebo for 2 wk and underwent a washout period of no treatment for
another 2 wk. The washout part of the study tested the extent of reversibility of the placebo
response. Study 2 (n = 39) was a double-blind randomized trial in which OA subjects were ran-
domized to either placebo or duloxetine treatment for 3 mo. In addition, in study 3 (n = 42) we
tracked changes in knee OA pain over a 3-mo period (see S2 Table). These participants did not
undergo brain scans, were not given any new treatments, and were used as a no-treatment
comparison to study 1 and study 2 pain outcomes. Separate experimenters collected study 1,
study 2, and study 3 data. Participants in study 1 and 2 were categorized into placebo respond-
ers and nonresponders based on a fixed threshold for pain relief (visual analog scale [VAS]
score) over treatment duration. Whole-brain degree count maps from study 1 were contrasted
between placebo responders and nonresponders to discover brain connectivity properties that
predict placebo response propensity. Healthy subjects’ (n = 20) brain degree counts were used
to test for correspondences between OA and healthy subjects for the primary outcome derived
from study 1. Given that the identified brain regions were based on categorization of partici-
pants, we also tested whether these brain parameters of interest reflected the continuous mag-
nitude of change in multiple pain scales (magnitude of % analgesia), which would establish the
involvement of the brain regions in future placebo-related analgesia independently from the
specific choice of pain threshold. Study 2 was used to validate the primary outcome derived
from study 1, to explore placebo and active drug interactions, and to identify a brain region
predicting active drug response.
Placebo Pill Analgesia Effect Size
In study 1, 2 wk of placebo treatment was associated with a significant decrease in knee OA
pain, with both VAS and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index

 (WOMAC) scores, across all 17 subjects (Fig 2A and 2E). At the end of the 2-wk placebo treat-
ment period, 8/17 (47%) of participants were classified as placebo responders (based on indi-
vidual knee pain decrease, VAS � 20% analgesia), and the others as nonresponders (Fig 2B).
Knee OA pain and the OA-specific pain and disabilities score (WOMAC questionnaire out-
come) remained unchanged for nonresponders, while responders showed a mean decrease of
54.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29.7–79.0) in knee VAS pain and a mean 38.6% (95% CI
18.0–59.2) decrease in WOMAC score (Fig 2C and 2F) (note that throughout the study we use
VAS scores for classification and WOMAC as an unbiased alternative outcome measure for
knee pain). In comparison to the matched study 3 no-treatment observational group (in which
4 of 20 would be classified as responders to no treatment, based on VAS � 20% analgesia) (see
S1 Fig and S2 Table), placebo responders showed a large decrease in knee VAS pain in 2 wk
(Fig 2D). After a 2-wk washout period (withdrawal of placebo pills), only knee VAS pain was

ysis of variance [ANOVA]: interaction group x time F(2,30) = 23.37, p < 0.001).
Brain Regional Degree Counts Predicting Placebo Analgesia
In study 1, whole-brain degree count maps, collected before the start of treatment, were used to
identify potential brain regional markers for placebo propensity. Group differences in whole-
brain degree count maps between placebo responders and nonresponders identified four brain
regions that differentiated placebo responders from nonresponders. The highest significant dif-
ference was seen for the right midfrontal gyrus (r-MFG) (p < 0.001), (Fig 3A and 3B). Degree
counts derived from r-MFG showed higher connectivity to the rest of the brain for responders
across all densities, with most significant difference seen at 10% density (Fig 3C). At this den-
sity, average per voxel degree count within r-MFG was twice as high in responders as in nonre-
sponders (3,256 ± 237 SE versus 1,777 ± 157 SE; t15 = 5.3, p < 0.001). Similar density-
dependent degree count group differences were also seen for the other three brain regions

the secondary somatosensory and primary motor cortex (r-S2/M1; x = 60, y = −7, z = 21; cluster 31, t-score of 1.7 or

 (posterior cingulate cortex [PCC], anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], and the right secondary
somatosensory and primary motor cortex [r-S2/M1]). The r-MFG counts explained placebo
analgesia magnitude for all participants, based on VAS and on WOMAC changes from base-
line (Fig 3D and 3E). Furthermore, to diminish the possibility that the r-MFG counts are
related to a regression to the mean phenomenon (rather than a placebo pill response), we
examined whether the r-MFG counts reflected symptom severity at time of entry into the
study. We found that r-MFG counts were not correlated with VAS prior to treatment but
became correlated with placebo treatment, and a similar pattern was also observedfor
WOMAC (S3 Table). Therefore, the r-MFG fulfills all the requirements for potentially predict-
ing clinical placebo response, which we sought to validate in study 2.
Placebo and Active Drug Analgesia in a Randomized Trial (Study 2)
Even though results in study 1 suggest that clinical placebo response is predictable and revers-
ible, the results are based on a relatively artificial setting and a single-blinded study, designed to
explore predictability of clinical placebo response. Thus, it was deemed necessary to test
whether these findings can be generalized to the more natural setting of the standard clinical
double-blind placebo versus active drug comparison scenario. To this end, we performed study
2, in which the primary objective was to test-validate the results obtained in study 1.
In study 2, the extent of pain relief, as measured by VAS or WOMAC (Fig 4A and 4D), was
similar for placebo and duloxetine treatments. Also, the number of treatment responders
(based on individual knee pain decrease over the course of a 3-mo treatment, VAS
score � 20% analgesia) did not differ between patients randomized to placebo (10/20, 50%)
and patients randomized to duloxetine (8/19, 42%) (Fisher’s exact test p > 0.75). The magni-
tude of pain relief in treatment responders also did not differ between treatment groups (Fig
4B and 4E) on both VAS and WOMAC outcome scores. Importantly, in comparison to the
matched study 3 no-treatment observational group (in which 7 of 20 would be classified as
responders to no treatment at 3 mo, based on VAS � 20% analgesia) (Fig 4C, S1 Fig, and S2
Table), placebo and duloxetine groups showed a larger decrease in the magnitude of knee VAS
pain in 3 mo. Thus, the subjective self-report pain-related outcomes did not differentiate
between placebo and duloxetine treatments but did show better analgesia for placebo and
duloxetine treatment in contrast to no treatment.
Validation of Placebo Predictability with Brain Functional Connectivity
across Clinical Trials
To establish the generalizability of the primary brain marker for placebo response in study 1,
we tested whether placebo predictive properties of r-MFG could be captured in study 2 partici-
pants. To ensure that the measure remained unbiased, only r-MFG degree counts were
extracted for all study 2 subjects, obtained from the functional rs-fMRI scans performed before
any treatments were dispensed. In study 2 OA patients who received placebo treatment, r-
MFG degree counts were significantly higher in placebo responders (t18 = 4.9; p = 0.0001) (Fig
5A, left) and differentiated between placebo responders and nonresponders at 95% accuracy
(Fig 5A, right). Perhaps more importantly, empirical placebo analgesia could be predicted
from r-MFG degree counts when the best-fit linear regression equations, identified in study 1
between r-MFG degree counts and future placebo analgesia, were applied to study 2 r-MFG
degree counts, both for VAS (p = 0.004) and WOMAC (p = 0.12) scores (Fig 5B, left and right).
Therefore, the placebo response predictive properties of r-MFG degree counts were validated
for the placebo treatment arm of study 2. Once again, to discount that r-MFG counts are a
reflection of regression to the mean, we correlated the r-MFG values from study 2 placebo

 group with VAS and WOMAC values before treatment start and 3 mo after treatment. For
both outcome measures, r-MFG counts were only correlated to knee pain after a 3-mo expo-
sure to placebo pill treatment (S3 Table). We additionally explored, in multiple regression
models, the contribution of demographics (age, gender, and pain duration), Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), past use of medications, and the r-MFG
degree counts to explain VAS-based analgesia. The r-MFG degree count was the main contrib-
utor, explaining 37.5% of the variance. Age and gender also significantly contributed to the
model by explaining 18.8% and 9.7% of unique variance, respectively. Performing the same
analysis for WOMAC-based analgesia did not identify any additional contributions besides the
r-MFG degree counts to the analgesia outcome.

the knee OA pain patients who participated in study 2, 20 were randomized to placebo (P, grey) and 19 to

significant and similar magnitudes of pain relief with a 3-mo treatment (only time-effect repeated-measures
ANOVA, F1,37 = 14.8, p < 0.0001). (B) Participants in both arms were classified as responders (P +, white;
DLX +, pink) or nonresponders (P −, black; DLX −, red) (�20% analgesia over the 3-mo placebo treatment).
Both treatments resulted in similar numbers of improvers and similar magnitudes of pain relief, observed, by
design, only in the treatment responders (white and pink). (C) Twenty knee OA patients (study 3), matched
for age, gender, and knee VAS pain at baseline, followed over 3 mo with no treatment (green). There was no

symptom relief, as observed for VAS, when the WOMAC scale is used as an outcome measure (only time-
effect repeated-measures ANOVA, F1,37 = 13.3, p = 0.001). Error bars are 95% CIs. The illustrated p-values
are post hoc comparisons that were statistically significant.

 Modeling Predicted Placebo in Subjects Receiving Active Drug
Given that in study 2 there was no difference in pain outcomes—VAS or WOMAC—between
placebo and duloxetine treatments, one would conclude that duloxetine is no better than pla-
cebo for pain relief, at least in the OA patients in study 2. The conclusion in turn leads to the
hypothesis that r-MFG degree counts in the duloxetine arm, when entered into the regression
equations derived from study 1, should just as accurately predict analgesic outcome as in the
placebo treatment arm in study 2. In fact, this hypothesis was proven false. Degree counts in r-
MFG did not differentiate between duloxetine responders and nonresponders. A two-way
ANOVA for r-MFG degree count as a function of treatment type (placebo or duloxetine) and
response type (responders and nonresponders) indicated a significant interaction (two-way
ANOVA, F1,34 = 12.60, p = 0.0012); a post hoc Tukey HSD test indicated response type was sig-
nificant for placebo treatment (HSD test = 5.18 with Studentized Range critical p = 0.001
threshold of 5.09), but not for duloxetine treatment (HSD test = 2.01 with 0.05 threshold of
2.87) (Fig 5C, left panel). Comparison of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
obtained for placebo treatment (Fig 5A, right panel) and for duloxetine treatment (Fig 5C,
right panel) indicated that they are significantly different (difference of 0.62, 95% CI (0.578–
0.662), p < 0.0001), and applying the regression equation from study 1 to r-MFG degree counts
in study 2 did not predict empirical analgesia for duloxetine treatment, both for VAS and

future outcomes (A, B for placebo treatment; C, D for duloxetine treatment) was assessed for r-MFG degree counts (based
on brain coordinates derived from study 1). (A) r-MFG degree counts were significantly higher in placebo responders (post
hoc honestly significant difference [HSD] test, p = 0.001), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified
grouping at 95% accuracy. (B) Empirical analgesia was correlated to analgesia predicted from the best-fit line calculated in
study 1, using r-MFG degree counts from study 2, for VAS (p = 0.004) and more weakly for WOMAC (p = 0.12) outcomes. (C)
In contrast, in patients randomized to duloxetine, the r-MFG degree count did not differentiate between responders and
nonresponders (t-score17 = 1.5, p = 0.17; ROC area under the curve [AUC] = 0.67) and (D) did not predict empirical
analgesia for VAS and WOMAC outcomes. Error bars are 95% CIs. Symbol colors represent the same groups as in Fig 3.

 WOMAC scores (Fig 5D). This result demonstrates that the duloxetine treatment and placebo
treatment outcomes are differentiable at the brain circuitry level, although clinically they may
be indistinguishable.
The bedrock assumption of all randomized controlled clinical trials is that placebo and
active treatment responses are linearly additive [27] (more complex interactions may also exist,
for example [28]), that is,
Empirical analgesia ¼ Placebo response þ Drug response:
This model is inherently assumed in all clinical trials, as the primary statistical test in ran-
domized clinical trials is always a competition between the effect sizes of the two responses.
The dissociation between our reported pain relief and r-MFG degree counts in the placebo-
and duloxetine-treated subjects suggests that this linear additive relationship may not always
be valid. We therefore pose the model as a formal hypothesis and examine its implications
regarding (1) observedversus expected analgesia and (2) underlying brain information sharing
properties.

Given that the placebo arm of study 2 was fully explainable from study 1 results, r-MFG degree
counts in the duloxetine treatment arm must also reflect the magnitude of placebo response in
the patients randomized to active treatment. Thus, one can calculate a predicted placebo
response in the duloxetine arm using the regression equation derived from study 1 and based
on r-MFG degree counts in the duloxetine-treated patients. The above equation then becomes
the following:
Empirical analgesia ¼ Predicted placebo response þ Drug response þ Error:
The Error term would have contributions from all parameters of the equation, at least
because of measurement errors, and remains unknown. On the other hand, the individual sub-
ject predicted placebo response compared to the empirical analgesia provides an estimate of
individual participant drug response (assuming that Error = 0 in above equation) (Fig 6A). We
observe in Fig 6A that relative to the individual predicted placebo analgesia (gray bars), inges-
tion of duloxetine appears to have increased observedanalgesia in subjects 1–6 and had no visi-
ble additional effect in subjects 7, 8, 10, and 14–16, while in subjects 9, 11, 13, and 17–19,
duloxetine actually diminished the modeled placebo analgesia. Our model thus unravels the
extent of efficacyof the active drug after correcting for modeled placebo responses. Moreover,
these results indicate that a purely additive model cannot hold for the current data because
only in one subgroup did duloxetine treatment increase observedanalgesia from predicted pla-
cebo analgesia, while in another subgroup, it interfered with and diminished expected placebo
analgesia.
Identification of a Brain Region Predictive of Placebo-Corrected Drug
Response
Banking on the notion that r-MFG is reflecting predicted placebo response, in the duloxetine-
treated subjects we can estimate the expected duloxetine-related analgesia from the difference
between predicted placebo response and observedanalgesia (assuming Error = 0 in the linear
equation). The difference between the red and grey bars in Fig 6A can then be considered the
active drug treatment-related estimated analgesia after correcting for modeled placebo analge-
sia. Therefore, this difference provides the metric with which we test for the existence of a
brain region predictive of future placebo-correctedresponse to duloxetine. Note the fact that

 the failure to differentiate behaviorally between placebo and drug response has no direct bear-
ing on the hypothesis that a drug response prediction can be constructed by linearly modeling
away the expected placebo response. Both duloxetine and placebo responses are mediated
through central mechanisms; as a result, the interaction between and across identifiable brain
regions may in turn explain their pain relief relationships.
In two participants (4 and 6), there was minimal predicted placebo response but above
threshold empirical analgesia (20% analgesia dotted line), suggesting that these subjects were
the drug responders with the least contribution from modeled placebo response. Therefore, a
brain area with higher degree counts for these two subjects compared to the rest of the duloxe-
tine responders (subjects 1–3, 5, and 7–8) may identify a brain region specific to drug treat-
ment propensity. This search resulted in pinpointing the right parahippocampal gyrus (r-
PHG) where the degree count was higher in subjects 4 and 6 from the remaining six duloxetine
responders (Fig 6B). To assess the validity of this region, the r-PHG degree count was extracted
Fig 6. Right parahippocampal gyrus (r-PHG) degree counts predict future duloxetine response, based on
modeling the placebo response in duloxetine-treated patients in study 2. (A) The empirical analgesia of individual
duloxetine-treated patients (red) and the predicted placebo response (grey) are illustrated. The predicted placebo response
was derived from the best-fit equation from study 1, which was applied to r-MFG degree count in duloxetine-treated
patients. Patients with minimal predicted placebo and �20% empirical analgesia were considered mostly duloxetine
responders (subjects 4 and 6; arrows). (B) Contrasting the whole-brain degree counts of these two subjects with the six
other duloxetine responders (subjects 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8) revealed a right parahippocampal gyrus region (r-PHG) in which
degree counts were higher in subjects 4 and 6 (scatter of individual values and median and quartiles are shown; Mann-
Whitney U-test, p = 0.071). (C) r-PHG degree count correlated with the difference between empirical analgesia and
predicted placebo response for VAS (p = 0.048) and WOMAC (p = 0.033) outcomes, suggesting that the regional functional
connections also reflect future placebo-corrected drug response for all 20 duloxetine-treated patients.

 for all duloxetine-treated subjects and correlated to the difference between empirical VAS anal-
gesia and predicted placebo response (i.e., estimated placebo-correcteddrug response). This
correlation was significant (p = 0.048) for the duloxetine-treated group (Fig 6C left). When the
same analysis was done for the unbiased WOMAC outcome measure (based on the best-fit
equation derived from study 1 for WOMAC), it too showed a significant correlation between
r-PHG degree counts and the difference between empirical WOMAC analgesia and predicted
placebo response (p = 0.033) (Fig 6C right). Both correlations reinforce the idea that the r-
PHG degree counts reflect/predictfuture drug responses, after accounting for the modeled pla-
cebo response.
In an exploratory multiple regression analysis, we examined the contribution of demo-
graphics, BDI, PCS, and past use of medications on the relationship between r-PHG and the
difference between empirical analgesia and predicted placebo response, using VAS or
WOMAC measures; no additional significant contributions were identified.
Discussion
In OA patients in the setting of a randomized clinical trial and without manipulating expecta-
tions, we demonstrate that baseline brain connectivity can predict placebo responders and pla-
cebo analgesia magnitude. The approach leads to uncovering a potential detrimental effect of
active treatment on expected placebo response and identification of brain connectivity predict-
ing a drug response corrected for expected placebo response. The methodologicalapproach
advanced should be applicable to clinical trials in general and to the study of various types of
placebo and treatments and suggests potential utility in clinical decision making.
The extent of information sharing (degree count) between a prefrontal cortical region, r-
MFG, and the rest of the brain (obtained before start of treatment) best reflected the placebo
response. We identified r-MFG from a 2-wk single-blinded clinical trial, in which the placebo
analgesia was larger than in the no-treatment observational group and in which the placebo
response was reversed after withdrawing placebo pills, and prospectively generalized its pla-
cebo predictive properties to a double-blind 3-mo treatment clinical trial. The r-MFG counts
were not related to disease burden prior to start of placebo treatment in studies 1 and 2, dimin-
ishing the possibility that the measure is related to regression to the mean rather than a true
placebo response. Therefore, r-MFG connectivity is likely a neural marker for placebo pill
response in the clinical trial setting in OA. The robust validation of placebo response (95%
accuracy) in the placebo-treated arm of study 2 enabled us to model away the expected placebo
response in the drug treatment arm of study 2. This approach demonstrated the differential
variability in drug- and placebo-inducedanalgesia. Moreover, as a proof of concept, we sepa-
rated drug responders from mixed—i.e., drug and placebo—responders,and this then led to
uncovering a brain region, the r-PHG, with properties consistent with being predictive of
future drug response presumably uncontaminated with placebo response (r-PHG was identi-
fied using a contrast of two versus six participants, and its properties could then be generalized
to the whole group of 19 patients that received duloxetine treatment). To our knowledge, this is
the first study identifying a brain site that appears to predict future placebo-correcteddrug
response propensity, even when the verbal reports did not distinguish between placebo and
drug treatment effects. The r-PHG predicting placebo-correcteddrug response should be con-
sidered an exploratory result, as it awaits future validation (especially since in the linear model
we assumed the error term to be zero, and the linear model was an assumption that remains
untested relative to more complex models). On the other hand, the neurobiological properties
of r-PHG that dictate its functional connectivity to the rest of the brain should match the phar-
macology of the action of duloxetine in the brain, and the observation suggests the general

 concept of the possibility of matching patients with treatments given their brain propensities
across therapeutic options.
There is a substantial body of literature regarding mechanisms of placebo response
[6,7,11,12,29–31]. However, studies regarding predicting placebo response in the clinical trial
setting and for chronic pain patient populations are sparse [21,32,33]. The present study is a
major departure from the standard approach in which placebo is assessed for acute painful sti-
muli while expectations are manipulated [9,13,34–36]. Placebo effects observedin the clinical
settings in the past have been ascribed to statistical rather than biological factors [8,37,38].
Putative explanations include (1) improvement being due to the natural history of the disease,
(2) improvements reflecting regression to the mean, and (3) patients benefiting from the posi-
tive psychosocial context of being enrolled in a study. We captured some of such influences in
study 3 and observe over time a smaller nonspecific OA knee pain relief than during placebo
treatments. Consequently, our study results suggest that specific brain biology underlies the
clinical placebo effect. Leading investigators in the field of placebo research have repeatedly
wondered whether placebo response is predictable. As Benedetti [37] states, “
A central issue in
placebo research is whether an individual in whom placebo works possesses one or more spe-
cific characteristics, which can reliably identify him a priori as a placebo responder.” Similarly,
another author poses the question: “Do placebo responders exist?” [39]. Here, we show results
consistent with the notion that in OA subjects, the placebo pill responder is predictable, and
her/his brain connectivity determines a priori both propensity and magnitude of
improvement.
Clinical placebo analgesia is only studied in a few neuroimaging studies in back pain, fibro-
myalgia, and OA [13,21,23]. Diversity of patient types and analysis methods obviate direct
comparison of outcomes, yet in all cases, prefrontal circuitry is implicated. The current study is
the first to employ a rigorous whole-brain contrast regarding brain network information shar-
ing in placebo responders and identifying and validating a biomarker predictive of placebo
response. To uncover perceptual correlates to this placebo response brain marker, we relied on
a meta-analytic approach [40]. Based on 525 studies, the reverse-inference highest-probability
terms associated with r-MFG activity were observedto be related to decision making, memory,
and planning. These associations support the idea that placebo analgesia is driven by top-down
modulation [22], presumably integrating prior experience to define future placebo responses.
Given our limited dataset, we intentionally constrained the analysis to the most robust predic-
tor of placebo response. However, three additional brain regions were also predictive of placebo
response in study 1. Increased connectivity of the ACC and decreased connectivity of the PCC
in placebo responders suggest a shift of balance in attentional circuitry, while decreased con-
nectivity of the sensorimotor cortex implicates sensory, perhaps nociceptive, processing and
motor behavior modulation in placebo propensity. The complexity of the identified circuitry is
consistent with long-standing evidence that placebo effects underlie a multiplicity of mecha-
nisms [7] and that the identified circuitry may be specific to the condition (OA knee pain) and
to the specific placebo response studied (ingestion of pills). The reverse-inference highest-
probability terms associated with the brain region predicting future drug response—i.e., r-PHG
—were related to memory encoding and retrieval, as well as to sadness and negative emotions.
Whether these memory and emotion-related characteristics could predict duloxetine respon-
siveness remains to be tested.
The linear placebo response model we employed uncovered variability in placebo-corrected
duloxetine responses. Observedresponses can be grouped into three categories: (1) the drug
improving placebo response (6/19), (2) the drug having no obvious additional effect beyond
that of the placebo (7/19), and (3) the drug diminishing expected placebo responses (6/19).
Similar to almost all centrally active drugs, duloxetine is associated with a long list of side

 effects. Here, we uncover a hitherto unobservableside effect, namely, the active drug diminish-
ing the placebo response. The specific mechanism underlying duloxetine interference on pla-
cebo response remains to be studied; yet, it might be mediated by engaging r-PHG, which in
turn either disturbs connectivity of r-MFG (and/or other placebo predictive regions) or modu-
lates targets critical to the r-MFG connectivity.
Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Directions
One weakness of the current study is the limited number of subjects used, counterbalanced by
the reversibility of placebo response during washout and a robust validation and by showing
the superiority of placebo analgesia relative to the no-treatment group both at 2 wk and at 3
mo, which altogether distinguish clinical pill placebo in OA from statistical confounds. An
important design limitation of our study was the independent recruitment for study 3. Ideally,
the no-treatment-arm patient entry should have been randomized within study 1 and study 2
recruitments. We should also qualify that observedanalgesia seen in placebo responders may
still be considered (although unlikely) a reflection of natural recovery or symptom fluctuation
rather than definitely caused by the placebo, because study 3 subjects were not randomized
into study 1 and 2, pain ratings were only collected at entry and end of treatment, and the
washout period knee pain was collected over the phone (thus, the rapid and complete reversal
of analgesia may be due not just to cessation of pill administration but also to the change in
environmental cues). Even though we used a single threshold (20%) for defining placebo
responders, the identified brain property—degreecounts of r-MFG—identifying placebo
responders could also predict the continuous measure of magnitude of placebo analgesia for
VAS and for WOMAC in study 1 and study 2, implying that the identified brain marker is not
strictly dependent on the specific analgesia threshold chosen. The ubiquity or specificity of the
brain marker uncovered for placebo response in OA remains to be identified across types of
chronic pain and for various placebo-type manipulations. Moreover, the predictability of
future drug response after modeling away the placebo response requires replication and trial
designs in which the error term in the linear equation can be systematically estimated and the
general applicability of the linear model tested in contrast to more complex model designs
(e.g., equations incorporating multiplicative or higher order polynomial terms), as well as test-
ing for drug-type specificity.
The current study falls within the general effort of using neuroimaging technology to fore-
cast the future health status of individuals, which is showing predictive value across many med-
ical domains [18]. The opportunity presented with identification of placebo and placebo-
corrected drug response predictive brain markers, specificallyin chronic pain patients and for
clinical trials using neutral instructions, presents both a concrete and humanitarian possibility
of decreasing suffering with the recognition and identification of individual differences in
brain function. If future similar studies can further expand and eventually provide a brain-
based predictive best-therapy option for individual patients, it would dramatically decrease
unnecessaryexposure of patients to ineffective therapies and decrease the duration and magni-
tude of pain suffering. Moreover, if placebo response can be predictably removed/reduced in
clinical trials, then, besides reducing the cost of clinical trials, the efficacyand neurobiology of
therapies can be identified more accurately and at the level of the individual.
Methods
Participants
All participants gave written informed consent to procedures approved by the Northwestern
University Institutional Review Board committee (STU00039556 for study 1 and 2,

 STU00059872 for study 3). We recruited a convenience sample of 143 community-based peo-
ple with knee osteoarthritis (OA) through public advertisement and Northwestern University-
affiliated clinics. A total of 20 patients were recruited for study 1, 70 for study 2, and 53 for
study 3. From these, 45 either did not complete the studies they were enrolled in or their brain
scans did not pass the quality assessment pipeline (see Fig 1, S1 and S2 Tables for demograph-
ics). Of the remaining 98 patients, 17 took part in study 1, 39 in study 2, and 42 in study 3
(from which 20 were selected to match our other groups). We also recruited 20 age-matched
healthy control subjects. Healthy subjects were matched to the mean age and gender distribu-
tion of all OA patients. All OA participants met the American College of Rheumatology criteria
for OA (confirmed by TJS) and had pain of at least 1-y duration. A list of inclusion and exclu-
sion (mainly presence of other chronic pain conditions and major depression) criteria was
imposed, including a knee-pain intensity of at least 4/10 on the 11-point numerical rating scale
(NRS) within 48 h of the screening visit. A detailed list of all inclusion and exclusion criteria as
well as clinical trial registrations is presented in the Supporting Information file (see S1 Text).
Study Design
Data from three different studies were used in the manuscript (Fig 1). Study 1 (Clinicaltrials.
gov accession number: NCT02903238; protocol details in S1 Study Protocol; relevant checklists
in S1 and S2 Checklists) constituted the discovery group and was used to identify and localize
brain functional differences between placebo responders and nonresponders. All study 1 par-
ticipants ingested placebo pills (lactose) once a day for 2 wk in a single-blind design. Prior to
the experiment, participants were informed that they would have an equal chance of receiving
a placebo pill or an active drug. The research staff knew that all patients were receiving placebo
pills. Pain and behavioral parameters were collected in person before and after treatment, and
knee pain VAS scores were additionally collected 2 wk after drug washout via a phone call. For
all patients, brain scans were collected prior to treatment.
Study 2 (Clinicaltrials.govaccession number: NCT01558700; protocol details in S1 Study
Protocol; relevant checklists in S1 and S2 Checklists) was performed independently and after
the end of study 1. This study served as the validation group and involved a double-blinded
trial in which patients received placebo or duloxetine for 3 mo. Study 2 participants ingested
either placebo pills or duloxetine at a dose of 30 mg for the first week and escalated to 60 mg
for the rest of the treatment period, except for the last week, when the dose was decreased back
to 30 mg. Drug preparation was made by an independent clinical research assistant, and the
research staff providing treatment to patients were kept blind at all times about subjects’ treat-
ment. For this study, a parallel assignment intervention model was used, with a simple ran-
domization using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization codes were prepared by an
independent clinical research assistant under TJS’s supervision,used for drug preparation, and
then concealed until the end of the study. The research staff performing recruitment and col-
lecting data were never in contact with the randomization codes until the end of the study. The
main purpose of study 2 was to validate the placebo propensity marker found in study 1, but in
a real clinical trial environment to mimic what is normally performed (e.g., by pharmaceutical
companies) for drug efficacyassessment. Another aim of study 2 was to test the specificity of
the brain biomarker to treatment type (i.e., whether the biomarker identified in study 1 reflects
general response to treatment or placebo response specifically).Behavioral and clinical param-
eters were obtained before and after treatment. Brain scans were collected prior to treatment.
For study 1 and 2, patients were asked to discontinue their medications 2 wk prior to the begin-
ning of the trial and were provided with acetaminophen as rescue medication. In this study,
two duloxetine-treated and three placebo-treated patients reported worsening of knee pain;

 four duloxetine-treated and three placebo-treated patients reported dizziness and grogginess
symptoms. No serious adverse events were reported.
Study 3 (protocol details in S2 Study Protocol) was also run independently from study 1 and
2. For this study, participants did not receive any medications and were asked to continue their
regular treatment regimen. Patients from study 3 represent the natural progression of the OA
condition within the same time frame as study 1 and 2. The purpose of study 3 was therefore to
account for regression to the mean or any other biases that could influence the outcome of the
subjects’ report of OA pain in the clinical trial setting.
Behavioral and Clinical Measures
Patients from all studies completed a general health questionnaire and a VAS (on a 0 to 10
scale) for their knee OA pain. Patients from study 1 and 2 also completed the WOMAC, the
BDI, and the PCS. All questionnaires were administered on the day of brain scanning.
Response categorization and brain regions of interest were identified using only the VAS mea-
sure and then tested for consistency using WOMAC. Thus, WOMAC provided an unbiased
estimate of treatment response and of brain regional properties. Analgesic response was
defined a priori on an individual basis as at least a 20% decrease in VAS pain from baseline to
the end of treatment period; otherwise,subjects were classified as nonresponders. This thresh-
old for analgesic response was chosen based on our earlier results [15] and also based on a
recent meta-analysis estimate of the size of placebo analgesia [32]. In study 2, to partially com-
pensate for regression to the mean effects, VAS was measured 3 times over a 2-wk period prior
to the start of treatment and after cessation of medication use, averaged, and used as the indica-
tor of pain at entry (designated as baseline in the figures).
Brain Scanning Parameters (Studies 1 and 2)
For all participants in studies 1 and 2, MPRAGE type T1-anatomical brain images were
acquired as describedbefore [15]. Briefly, a 3T Siemens Trio whole-body scanner with echo-
planar imaging (EPI) capability using the standard radio-frequencyhead coil with the follow-
ing parameters: voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm; TR = 2,500 ms; TE = 3.36 ms; flip angle = 9°; in-plane
matrix resolution = 256 × 256; slices = 160; and field of view = 256 mm. rs-fMRI images were
acquired on the same day and scanner with the following parameters: multi-slice T2�-weighted
echo-planar images with repetition time TR = 2.5 s, echo time TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°,
number of slices = 40, slice thickness = 3 mm, and in-plane resolution = 64 × 64; the number of
volumes was 300. The 40 slices covered the whole brain from the cerebellum to the vertex. All
MRI data are available on openfmri.org.
fMRI Preprocessing and Data Analysis (Studies 1 and 2)
As we describedbefore [15], the preprocessing of each subject's time series of fMRI volumes
was performed using the FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT [41], www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl)
and encompassed the following: discarding the first five volumes to allow for magnetic field
stabilization, skull extraction using BET, slice time correction, motion correction, spatial
smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 5 mm, and high-pass temporal filtering (150 s).
Several sources of noise, which may contribute to non-neuronal fluctuations, were removed
from the data through linear regression. These included the six parameters obtained by rigid
body correction of head motion, the global BOLD signal averaged over all voxels of the brain,
signal from a ventricular region of interest, and signal from a region centered in the white
matter.

 All preprocessed fMRI data were registered into standard MNI space multiplied by a com-
mon gray matter mask generated from all subjects in the study (this step was performed in
order to limit all analyses to a common set of gray matter voxels) and subsequently down-sam-
pled to yield 29,015 regional cortical and subcortical nodes (4 x 4 x 4 mm isometric voxels).
Brain Graph Construction (Studies 1 and 2)
To construct the whole-brain voxel-wise connectivity networks for each subject, we first com-
puted the Pearson correlation coefficient(R) for all possible pairs of the 29,015 cortical and
subcortical voxel time series from the preprocessed rs-fMRI data. For each subject, the thresh-
old was calculated to produce a fixed number of edges M to be able to compare the extracted
graphs [42]. Therefore, the values of the threshold are subject dependent. Each of these
extracted graphs comprised N = 29,015 nodes corresponding to the number of voxels and M
undirected edges corresponding to the significant nonzero absolute values of correlation
greater than the value of the threshold. Since the value of the chosen threshold is important
[42,43], we chose to test several values of threshold, from a conservative threshold correspond-
ing to 2% connection density (the percentage of edges with respect to the maximum number of
possible edges [(N x N– 1) / 2]) to a lenient threshold corresponding to 20% link density. Net-
works constructed at 2% link density are dubbed sparse networks, while those constructed at
20% are dense. In general, results are presented over a range of thresholds to give the reader a
sense of the (lack of)dependence of a property upon thresholds, and no formal definition of
threshold ranges is proposed since it is essentially arbitrary.
Nodal Degree Difference between Responders and Nonresponders
(Study 1)
To localize the nodes (voxels) that exhibited significant changes in number of connections
(degrees) in responders and nonresponders in Study 1, we performed a whole-brain analysis.
First, for each subject and link density, we computed the number of edges (links) for each node
from the brain graph, using the BCT toolbox [44]. The number of degrees was used to con-
struct single brain volume in standard MNI space for each subject, in which the value assigned
for each node corresponds to the degree of that given node. Differences in nodal degree
between responders and nonresponders, at each link density, were carried out using Rando-
mise in FSL [45]. This technique uses permutation-based inference to allow for rigorous com-
parisons of significance within the framework of the general linear model with p < 0.05. Group
differences were tested against 5,000 random permutations, using the threshold-free cluster
enhancement (TFCE) method. The maps between responders and nonresponders were con-
trasted at all densities, and the final difference map represented the conjunction of significantly
different voxels across at least eight out of the ten densities evaluated after TFCE correction.
Finally, the conjunction map presented in Fig 2B was used to determine regions of interest that
serve as brain biomarkers for placebo response.
Validation of Brain Biomarkers (Study 2)
Pretreatment degree counts for the regions of interest identified in study 1 were determined for
all study participants, and we tested whether these values can predict placebo analgesia and/or
duloxetine analgesia in study 2. Prediction accuracy was tested using a binary (i.e., prediction
of group responders versus nonresponders) or a continuous model (prediction of response
magnitude). The significanceof the binary classification was determined by an ROC area-
under-the-curve(AUC) analysis that identifies the sensitivity and specificity of predicting
future treatment outcomes. The significance of the continuous prediction was determined

 using a regression analysis of predicted versus observedoutcomes. The relationship between
outcome and degree was determined from linear fitting (y = ax + b) for study 1, where
y = represents % analgesia response, a = fitted slope, and x = degree count of region of interest
(ROI). This equation was used to determine the outcome (y2) in study 2 (y2 = ax2 + b), where
x2 represents the degree count of the ROI. The significance of the prediction was assessed by
correlation analysis between the predicted outcome (y2) and the observedresponse for patients
in study 2.
Additional Statistical Analysis
For Figs 2 and 4, a repeated-measures ANOVA compared between groups and time effects.
Post hoc comparisons’ p-values (after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison) are indi-
cated on the figures. For Fig 5A and 5C, two-way ANOVA was used, and the post hoc p-value
is indicated on the figure. For Fig 6B, a nonparametric test was used because the number of
observations was small. Multiple regression analysis was performed with the linear regression
tool in SPSS software. VAS analgesia was set as the dependent variable, and r-MFG count
value, gender, age, pain duration, past medication use, and BDI and PCS scores were set as
independent variables. The stepwise forward elimination method was then used to generate a
multifactorial regression model, using a p < 0.05 criterion for adding variables and a p < 0.1
criterion for removing a variable and repeating the process until none improved the process.
To compare between ROC curves in Fig 5, we used the online tool provided from varrstats
(vassarstats.net/roc_comp.html), which is using the method describedin [46]. This provided
us with the difference and standard error. We then calculated the 95% CI using the following
formula: CI = ± Zα/2 � σ / p(n), where Zα/2 represents the z-value at α/2 (where α is the confi-
dence level, here 95%), σ is the standard error, and n is the sample size.

S1 Table. Demographicsfor participants in study 1 and study 2 and healthy controls. Val-
ues are shown as mean and 1 SE (in parenthesis). Duration = duration of OA knee pain, in
years; MQS, Medication Quantification Scale = medication use at time of entry into study.

S2 Table. Demographicsand pain scores for participants in study 3. Values are shown as
mean and 1 SE (in parenthesis). Duration = duration of OA knee pain, which was only avail-
able in 50% of participants; VAS = knee OA pain.

S3 Table. Relationship between knee pain and the brain placebo predictor, r-MFG degree
counts, before and after placebo treatment. The degree counts from the r-MFG region
extracted from scans for study 1 and study 2 (placebo-treated groups) were correlated with the
knee pain values (VAS and WOMAC) obtained before and after the placebo treatment. No cor-
relation was observedwith VAS before treatment for both groups, while VAS after treatment
significantly correlated with r-MFG degree count. A similar, but not as robust, pattern was
observedfor WOMAC as well. Data are shown as R-values (p-values are shown in parentheses,
with significant correlations in bold). This analysis was performed to test the extent to which r-
MFG counts may be reflecting regression to the mean. The obtained results are suggestive (but
do not fully rule out) that r-MFG counts reflect the placebo response rather than regression to
the mean.
