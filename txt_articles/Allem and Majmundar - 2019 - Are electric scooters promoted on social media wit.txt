Electric scooter (e-scooter) companies are growing in popularity across the United States looking to take ad-
vantage of the rideshare economy by providing an independent alternative to cars and bicycles. While e-scooter
transportation could reduce emissions, and automobile congestion in local areas, powered two-wheeler drivers
are extremely vulnerable to road risks. News reports of e-scooter crashes and fatalities have started to accu-
mulate. Earlier research has demonstrated that the ways in which companies promote and demonstrate use of
their product or service through social media influences consumer behavior. In the U.S. in 2018, this study
examined the official Instagram account of Bird, the e-scooter market share leader with over 66,000 followers, to
determine how much it emphasized safety in its posts. All posts to Bird's official Instagram account were col-
lected from 22 September 2017 to 9 November 2018 (n = 324) and rules for coding content were developed.
Among all posts, 69.14% contained a person visible with a Bird e-scooter, 6.17% contained persons wearing
protective gear, 6.79% had protective gear somewhere in the post, and 1.54% of posts mentioned protective gear
in the comment box. About 69.44% of the posts were reposts, and among reposts, 7.11% had persons wearing
protective gear. Posts to Bird's official Instagram rarely showed e-scooters being used with protective gear.
Photos of customers' experiences with Bird, via reposts, rarely featured protective gear potentially normalizing
these behaviors among customers. Public health practitioners may need to establish interventions to promote use
of protective gear while operating escooters.
1. Introduction
Electric scooter (e-scooter) companies are growing in popularity
across the United States looking to take advantage of the rideshare
economy by providing an independent alternative to cars and bicycles
(Irfan, 2018). E-scooters can reach speeds of up to 15 miles per hour
and provide a feasible solution to the “last mile” problem or the dis-
tance that feels strenuous to walk but too short to drive.
E-scooter services are dockless, ride-sharing alternatives for last-
mile connectivity. Customers are able to use e-scooters by downloading
mobile applications to their smartphones. The mobile applications then
direct customers to the nearest available e-scooter via global posi-
tioning system. After completing their ride, customers can leave their e-
scooter anywhere outside restricted zones, as indicated in the mobile
application. While e-scooter transportation could reduce emissions, and
automobile congestion in local areas, powered two-wheeler drivers are
extremely vulnerable to road risks (Hooten and Murag, 2014). News
reports of e-scooter crashes and fatalities have started to accumulate
over the past year (Notopoulos, 2018; Carville, 2018).
Research has demonstrated that the ways in which companies
promote and demonstrate use of their product or service through social
media influences consumer behavior (Kumar et al., 2016). Instagram, in
particular, has become an important platform for companies to com-
municate with their customers (Chu et al., 2016; Allem et al., 2017a;
Allem et al., 2017b). This study examined the official Instagram ac-
count of Bird, the e-scooter market share leader (Huddleston, 2018),
with over 66,000 Instagram followers, to determine how much it em-
phasized safety in its posts.
2. Methods
All
posts
to
Bird's
official
Instagram
account
(https://www.
instagram.com/bird/) were collected from 22 September 2017 to 9
November 2018 (n = 324). Each post was reviewed by one investigator
and characterized as to whether 1) person(s) was/were visible in the
post with an e-scooter, 2) person(s) in the post was/were wearing any
protective gear (e.g., if any of the following were present on the person
(s): helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, or knee pads, then protective

 giver was coded as present), 3) protective gear was visible anywhere in
the post, 4) protective gear or safety was mentioned in the comment
box corresponding to the post, and 5) the post was a “repost” or the
photo credited to a customer that Bird adopted for their own account.
To establish interreliability, a second investigator coded a subsample of
posts (n = 169). Interreliability ranged from κ = 0.96 to κ = 0.81. All
analyses relied on publicly available data (e.g., anyone with internet
access could view the post at the time it was collected) and adhered to
the terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy policy of Instagram.
3. Results
Among all posts, 69.14% contained a person visible with a Bird e-
scooter, 6.17% contained persons wearing protective gear, 6.79% had
protective gear somewhere in the post, and 1.54% of posts mentioned
protective gear in the comment box. About 69.44% of the posts were
reposts, and among reposts, 7.11% had persons wearing protective
gear.
4. Discussion
Posts to Bird's official Instagram rarely showed e-scooters being
used with protective gear. Photos of customers' experiences with Bird,
via reposts, rarely featured protective gear potentially normalizing
these less safe behaviors among customers (Schaefers et al., 2016).
While Bird offers free helmets (https://www.bird.co/safety) to all ac-
tive riders (as long as they cover shipping), reposting its customers'
photos without wearing protective gear signals that Bird approves of
customers riding without a helmet.
While e-scooter companies, like Bird, should consider the im-
portance of road safety, they have instead sponsored a bill that was
recently passed by the California Legislature that allows adults to ride e-
scooters without helmets (the prior law required helmets regardless of
age) (AB-2989, 2018). Public health officials may need to establish
interventions to promote use of protective gear while operating e-
scooters.
Our findings are limited to one social media account from a single e-
scooter company, do not pertain to other forms of Bird's communica-
tions, and traditional survey-based research is needed to document the
use of protective gear among e-scooter customers. This study did not
address the effectiveness in protective gear to deter injury from riding
e-scooters and did not determine if protective gear would lead users to
ride less safely (e.g., risk compensation). These are all areas of future
research.
Regardless of these limitations, this study determined the extent to
which Bird emphasized safety on Instagram—an important platform for
companies to communicate with their customers. It is in the interest of
all e-scooter companies to promote their services with safety in mind
and social media platforms like Instagram may be an excellent venue to
do so.
