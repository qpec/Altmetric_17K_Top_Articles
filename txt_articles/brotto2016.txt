Abstract Althoughlackofsexualattractionwasfirstquantified
by Kinsey, large-scale and systematic research on the preva-
lence and correlates of asexuality has only emerged over the
past decade. Several theories have been posited to account for
thenatureofasexuality.Thegoalofthisreviewwastoconsider
the evidence for whether asexuality is best classified as a psy-
chiatricsyndrome(orasymptomofone),asexualdysfunction,or
aparaphilia.Basedontheavailablescience,webelievethereisnot
sufficientevidencetosupportthecategorizationofasexualityasa
psychiatric condition (or symptom of one) or as a disorder of
sexual desire. There is some evidence that a subset of self-iden-
tified asexuals have a paraphilia. We also considered evidence
supportingtheclassificationofasexualityasauniquesexualorien-
tation. We conclude that asexuality is a heterogeneous entity that
likelymeetsconditionsforasexualorientation,andthatresearchers
should further explore evidence for such a categorization.

Introduction
Prior to 2004, asexuality was a term that was largely reserved
for describing the reproductive patterns of single-celled organ-
isms.Sincethen,however,empiricalresearchonthetopicof
humanasexuality—oftendefinedasalackofsexualattraction—
has grown. Estimates from large-scale national probabil-
ity studies of British residents suggest that approximately 0.4%
(Aicken,Mercer,&Cassel,2013;Bogaert,2013)to1%(Bogaert,
2004, 2013; Poston & Baumle, 2010) of the adult human popu-
lationreportneverfeelingsexuallyattractedtoanyone,withrates
closer to 2 % for high school students from New Zealand
(Lucassen et al., 2011), and up to 3.3 % of Finnish women
(Ho
¨glund, Jern, Sandnabba, & Santtila, 2014).
Althoughthedefinitionofasexualityvariessomewhatacross
these studies,‘‘lack of sexual attraction’’is the generally
accepted definition by the Asexuality Visibility and Education
Network(AVEN)(www.asexuality.org).Itisimportant to note,
however, that individuals can experience sexual attractions
that are not directed towards others—an idea that we elab-
orated on more fully later in this article. When we refer to
asexuals in this article, we mean‘‘self-identified asexuals’’as

uality on AVEN has changed over time as awareness about
asexuality has increased. There is recognition that some asex-
uals can experience sexual attraction in isolated instances, or

 Jay has had a noteworthy effect on cultivating a sense of com-
munity2 for those contemplating their asexual identity, for
housing the largest body of education and information pertain-
ingtotheexperiencesofasexualindividuals,andforservingasa
hub for research participants to the academic community. In
many instances, hypotheses about the correlates and charac-
teristicsofasexuality,thatbecamethefocusoffutureresearch,
were first discussed on the AVEN forum by members. As of
December 2015, there were approximately 120,000 registered
membersonAVENaroundtheglobe.Therelationshipbetween
AVEN and researchers is bidirectional. In particular, discus-
sions on the forum often pertain to the published research on
asexuality and to questions that researchers have posed to
asexual individuals. For example, Bogaert’s questioning in
regard to asexuals’ fantasies triggered a lively exchange on
the forum about the contents of asexuals’ fantasies (Bogaert,
2015,personalcommunication).Forthepastfewyears,AVEN
has also carried out an annual Community Census, intended to
describe the demographic characteristics of AVEN members.
The2014census,whichwasbasedonover14,000respondents
(10,000ofwhomwereself-identifiedasexuals;Ginoza,Miller,
&MembersoftheAVENSurveyTeam,2014),highlightedcon-
siderable diversity in the experiences and identities of those
identifying as asexual. This diversity needs to be borne in mind
as we consider the research findings that follow, with the caveat
that any conclusions drawn may not pertain to the entire popu-
lation who identify as asexual.
Early reactions to the flurry of media attention and the exis-
tence of asexuality were largely negative, particularly from
prime-time talk show figures. For example, Williams (2007)
doubted David Jay’s ability to resist having sex‘‘when hesaw
agirlwalkoutofaroominlingerie’’andCarlson(2006)reported
on national television that after a few sexual encounters, an
asexualwouldlikelygrowtolovesex,inthesamewaythathis
initial aversion to goat cheese transformed into indulgence
after a few ingestions. The opinions among some sex ther-
apists were also negative, with claims that asexuality is likely a
manifestation of trauma, personality disturbance, or problematic
attachments early in life (Asexuality on 20/20, 2006). Given the
centrality of sexual attraction as a core feature of being human,
criticshavealsoarguedthatasexualityisamanifestationofsome
underlying psychopathology (Johnson, 1977), or that it rep-
resents an extreme variant of a sexual desire disorder (Childs,
2009;Westfall,2004).Somehavesuggestedthatatleastasubset
of asexually identified individuals may be paraphilic (Bogaert,
2006).
Over the past 10 years, there has been a burgeoning of
empiricalstudiesonasexuality,andtherearenowdataavailable
topositionscientistsandtheoreticianstobeabletoanswersome
of these intriguing questions about the nature of asexuality. The
objective of this brief review is to review and critically evaluate
data which address some of the putative classifications of asex-
uality, specifically as to whether asexuality might be a psychi-
atric condition (or symptoms of one), a sexual dysfunction, or a
paraphilia.Althoughwerecognizethatthesepossiblecategories
ofasexualityarenotmutuallyexclusive,andthatonemayhavea
mental health concern, a sexual dysfunction, and a paraphilia
simultaneously, we chose to consider each of these separately,
as a possible explanation for asexuality given that such an intel-
lectual exercise may help to consider the phenomenon of asex-
uality more deeply. Ultimately, like Bogaert (2006, 2012a), we
surmisethattheavailableevidencepointstoasexualitybeingbest
conceptualized as a unique sexual orientation.
Asexuality as a Mental Disorder
Could asexuality represent a symptom of a mental disorder (or a
mental disorder itself)? Furthermore, could distress associated
with asexuality be part of a psychiatric condition, or is it a by-
productofsocietaljudgmentstowardsasexuality?Theavailable
science is equivocal with regard to the association between
asexuality and psychological/psychiatric symptoms. Nurius
(1983),whodefinedasexualindividualsasthosewhochosetonot
have sex, found small but statistically significant higher rates of
depression and self-esteem problemsamong the asexuals com-
pared to the other sexual orientation groups, but group diffe-
rences in self-esteem disappeared when controllingforback-
ground characteristics and sexual attitudes. Larger quantitative
studieshavefoundthatself-identifiedasexualindividualshadthe
same rates of depression as population norms (Brotto, Knudson,
Inskip,Rhodes,&Erskine,2010),butweremorelikelytoendorse
symptoms of Social Withdrawal on a self-report screener for per-
sonalitysymptoms,andtoreportmoreinterpersonaldifficultiesin
general (Yule, Brotto, & Gorzalka, 2013). These researchers also
found that asexual individuals were more likely to report symp-
tomsofanxiety,andtoendorsemoresymptomsofsuicidalitycom-
paredtosexualparticipants.Inafollow-upqualitativeinvestigation
withasubgroupofasexualindividualswhoparticipatedinalarger
quantitative study (Brotto et al., 2010), seven out of the 15 par-
ticipants interviewed reported believing that they had traits of
Schizoid Personality Disorder, and several discussed the associ-
ation between Asperger Syndrome and asexuality, which had
been discussed at length by members on AVEN. Further support
of this potential association comes from a study by Ingudom-
nukul, Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, and Knickmeyer (2007),
whofound that 17% of asexual women met criteria for an autism

others with a similar disinterest insex is so strong, and this highlightsthe
centrality of sexuality in human experience. It may also be that such a
strong sense of community helps to challenge perceived stigma against
asexuality.

for an Autism Spectrum condition (Developmental Disabilities
Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal Inves-
tigators, 2014). Of note, the association between asexuality and
either Asperger Syndrome or autism spectrum has been based
oncross-sectionalstudydesigns,andalthoughseveralmembers
of AVEN endorse the link between asexuality and Asperger/
Autismspectrum,large-scalestudiesfurtherelucidatingthisrela-
tionship must be performed.
Some have also suggested that the lack of sexual attraction
may represent a reaction to trauma, or an aversive or disgust
reactiontoviewingthegenitals(Asexualityon20/20,2006;for
adiscussion,seeGressga
¨rd,2013).Neitherofthesehypotheses
have been supported by quantitative data (Brotto et al., 2010);
however, one qualitative study found considerable variability
inasexualparticipants’reactionstoviewinggenitals,withsome
having a sex-neutral view, and others being more sex averse
(VanHoudenhove,Gijs,T’Sjoen,&Enzlin,2015a).Whether
these reportsofaversiontowards genitalsrepresent ananxious
and/or phobic-like reaction to sex and genitals, or reflect an
indifferencetothem,wasnotfullyexploredinthestudy.Onthe
other hand, at least some asexual individuals reported appre-
ciatingtheartisticvalueofgenitals,asinMichelangelo’sstatue
of David, even though seeing them did not trigger sexual attrac-
tion or desire (Brotto et al., 2010).
Although there is some evidence for higher rates of psy-
chiatricsymptomsinasexualindividuals,ithasbeensuggested
that at least some of those symptoms may be explained by
asexuals’ tendency to experience stigmatization and dehuman-
ization. For example,whencollege studentswere provided with
definitions of different sexual orientation groups, asexual indi-
viduals received the most negative evaluations, and were
endorsed as the least likely to possess‘‘human nature traits’’
(MacInnis & Hodson, 2012). Furthermore, participants were
least likely to report wanting future contact with asexual indi-
vidualscomparedtotheothersexualorientationgroups,andthe
findingswerenotaccountedforbyasexualindividuals’greater
likelihood of being single. Therefore, similar to the experiences
of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals (e.g., D’Augelli &
Hershberger, 1993; Toomey, Ryan, Diaz, Card, & Russell,
2010), it is likely that the distress and psychological symptoms
experienced by asexual individuals is secondary to their expe-
rience of prejudice and discrimination, rather than asexuality
beingtheresultofanunderlyingpsychologicaldisturbance.As
a result, elevated levels of distress, when they do exist among
asexual individuals, should not be used to pathologize asexual
individuals or asexuality more broadly (Bogaert, 2006; Yule
et al., 2013). Like Prause and Graham (2007), we believe that
asexuality should not be classified as a psychiatric diagnosis,
norbeseenasasymptomofone.Instead,weagreewithGressga
¨rd
(2013) who urges for discussions that move from pathology to
identity.Ofcourse,theputativerelationshipbetweenasexuality,
Asperger Disorder, and Autism Spectrum conditions suggests
that for some asexuals, their distress arises from these mental
health conditions, rather than from the asexuality itself.
Asexuality as a Sexual Dysfunction
Could asexuality be a symptom of a sexual dysfunction (de-
fined as a clinically significant disturbance in a person’s ability
to respond sexually or experience sexual pleasure) (American
Psychiatric Association,2013)? In other words, could a lack of
sexualarousaltosexualtriggersunderlieandaccountforasexual
individuals’ lack of attraction? This conclusion would be in line
withincentivemotivationmodelswhichproposethatmotivation
for sexual activity is triggered by sexual arousal first (Both,
Everaerd, & Laan, 2007). To explore whether sexual arousal
wasdifferentbetweenasexualandsexualparticipants,genital
sexualresponsewastestedinasmallgroupofasexualwomen
inresponsetosexuallyexpliciteroticfilms.Althoughtheasexual
women self-reported no increase in desire for sex after viewing
theeroticfilms,theirgenitalresponse,asmeasuredwithavaginal
photoplethysmograph, did not significantly differ from the other
sexualorientationgroups(Brotto&Yule,2011).Whethergenital
arousal patterns of asexual men differ from other sexual ori-
entation groups is unknown, and is currently the subject of at
least two ongoing studies—one collaboration between the
University of British Columbia and Brock University, and a
second at Northwestern University.
Disorders of sexual desire, such as the DSM-5’s Female Sex-
ual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD), bear resemblance to
asexuality in that they both pertain to a lack of interest in sex.
Indeed, many have speculated that asexuality represents the
polarlowerendofthesexualdesirecontinuum,andthuslikely
falls within the sexual dysfunction umbrella. However, one
keydifferencebetweenasexualityandasexualdesiredisorder
is that those experiencing the latter are required to experience
clinically significant personal distress, whereas asexual indi-
viduals’ lack of sexual attraction is egosyntonic, and as reviewed
earlier, when distress is present, it is typically in reaction to per-
ceived social disapproval of their asexual status, rather than a
personally derived distress. Moreover, the goal in treatment
for the person with a sexual desire disorder is to increase their
interest in sex, whereas an asexual person in therapy would be
more likely to benefit from a focus on self-acceptance (Hinde-
rliter, 2013), or on developing skills around navigating relati
onships, especially if their partner was sexual and motivated to
have sex. In the DSM-5, the accompanying text for the sexual
desire disorders (both FSIAD in women and hypoactive sexual
desire disorder [HSDD] in men) explicitly mentions asexuality
as an exclusion criterion.
To further explore similarities and differences between a
sexualdesiredisorder andasexuality,werecruited400menand
women to an online study and administered a battery of vali
Arch Sex Behav
123
 dated questionnaires assessing sexual behaviors and response.
Participants who met diagnostic criteria for HSDD were sig-
nificantly more likely than asexuals to be in a relationship (80
vs 22%), to masturbate (88 vs 73%), and to have engaged in
kissing and petting behaviors (84 vs 36 %) (Brotto, Yule, &
Gorzalka,2015).Aftercontrollingforage,asexual individuals
were also significantly more likely to have never engaged in
sexualintercourse (78vs12%),andtohavenever hada sexual
fantasy(38vs16%)comparedtothosewithlowdesire.Alogistic
regression predicting to group found that (higher) sex-related
distress, (higher) levels of sexual desire, (partnered) relation-
shipstatus,and(lower)alexithymiascores(i.e.,inabilityto
identify and express emotions) significantly predicted to the
HSDD group over the asexual group.
Taken together, these findings suggest that asexuality is not
likely to fit under the sexual dysfunction umbrella, at least not
as a sexual desire disorder, nor as a disorder of physical sexual
arousal response (at least among women). In support of this,
another qualitative study found that asexual individuals were
notworriedabouttheirlevelofsexualdesire,nordidtheywish
to speak to a health professional about their lack of attraction
(Prause & Graham, 2007). Whereas a diagnosis of a sexual dy
sfunction is made by a trained clinician, one need not have a
thirdpartyassignthelabelasexual;ratheranindividual’sown
identification with asexuality is deemed sufficient for its adop-
tion(Hinderliter,2013).Ofcourse,thisdoesnotruleoutthepossi-
bility that at least some of the individuals diagnosed with lifelong
HSDD may not better be classified as asexual, given that in the
studybyBrottoetal.(2015)therewerefewdifferencesbetween
those with lifelong HSDD and asexuals on measures of sexual
behavior and sexual desire. We have also previously suggested
thatoverlapbetweenlifelongHSDDandasexualitymaypointto
the fact that these individuals are part of the same group, except
that they differ in self-reported distress. Clearly, fuzzy bound-
aries between individuals with lifelong HSDD and asexuality
warrants further investigation to decipher whether these are, in
fact, distinct or the same groups.
Asexuality as a Paraphilia
Paraphilias are defined as atypical sexual attractions that are
not,bythemselves,consideredadisorder(AmericanPsychiatric
Association,2013).Tomeetcriteriaforaparaphilicdisorder,the
DSM-5 requires that individuals with paraphilic interests expe-
rience significant personal distress or that their desires/behavior
createsdistressforsomeoneelse,orinvolveanunwillingpartner.
Giventhatasexualindividuals’sexualinterestsfalloutsideofthe
experiences typical of most people, Bogaert (2006, 2012a)
wonderedwhetherasexualityisaformofparaphilia.Thefinding
thatasexualindividualsmasturbate—albeitatalowerfrequency
than sexual individuals—with approximately half of asexual
individuals masturbating monthly and over 80 % of sexually
identified individuals masturbating at least monthly (Yule,
Brotto, & Gorzalka, 2014a, but see Yule, Brotto, & Gorzalka,
in press for an exception for men), suggests that asexual indi-
viduals may possess a non-partner-oriented sexual desire under-
lyingtheir masturbatorybehaviors.There maybe lustful feelings
thatarediffusewithnodirectiontowardorconnectiontoothers.A
qualitative exploration into the motivations for masturbation rev
ealed at least some asexual individuals to liken their behavior to
‘‘cleaning out the plumbing’’(Brotto et al., 2010; Prause & Gra-
ham,2007; Scherrer,2008), and thishas beenreplicated by more
recentresearchinwhichasexualindividualsreportedbeingmuch
less likely to masturbate for reasons such as sexual pleasure than
formorefunctionalreasons,suchastorelievetension(Yuleetal.,
in press). In other words, according to some asexuals, masturba-
tion is a physiological act unrelated to sexual incentives. How-
ever, the presence of masturbation plus sexual fantasies, which
may characterize at least half of asexual individuals, raises the
possibility that there may be a great deal of variability across
asexual individuals in their motives for masturbation, with some
having a paraphilic component. Bogaert (2012b) discussed this
further within the context of automonosexualism, a term coined
originallybyMagnusHirschfeld(1914),toreflectaninwarddirec-
tionofone’ssexualinterestssuchthattheasexualindividualmaybe
attracted to themselves.
Bogaert (2006) rejected the possibility that all asexual indi-
vidualsareparaphilic,inpartbecauseextremeparaphiliaswithout
any human interest are rare,andalsobecause there seems to be
more women than men identifying as asexual (Bogaert, 2004,
2013), whereas paraphilias are more common in men. Never-
theless, Bogaert (2012b) goes on to speculate that a specific ty
pe of paraphilia might characterize some asexual individuals.
Specifically, autochorissexualism, which Bogaert defined as
an‘‘identity-less sexuality,’’such that while there is usually a
sense of self within one’s sexual fantasies, an individual with
autochorissexualism may lack a sense of identity as the pro-
tagonistwithinasexualfantasy.Thereissomeindirectempirical
support for this possible link between asexuality and autocho-
rissexuality in that among asexuals who report having experi-
encedasexualfantasy,11%ofthemreportedthattheirfantasies
did not depict any human persons, whereas this was the case for
only 0.5% of those in an age-matched sexual comparison group
(Yule et al., 2014a). Further indirect support for this stems from
our earlier findingof significantly higher ratesof alexithymia tra
its in asexuals compared to sexual participants (Brotto et al.,
2010). It is possible that some shared underlying attribute con-
tributestoboththelackofemotionalattachment(inalexithymia)
and to lack of sense of self during a fantasy or behavior (auto-
chorissexuality). Future research should aim to explore the
association between these constructs among asexually identify-
ing individuals.

autochorissexuality.

whether they are eliciting the fantasy simply as a means of
focusing attention on an object for the purposes of becoming
sexuallyarousedandhavinganorgasm(cf.Brottoetal.,2010).
We encourage other researchers to deploy more precision in
the questions asked about whether or not there is an imagined
‘‘self’’in these fantasy scenes.
Whereasthesedataprovidesomesupportforthepossibility
that asexuality may be an expression of paraphilic interest, it
must be noted that recent studies have shown that a substantial
proportion of sexual individuals also engage in fantasies that
might be considered paraphilic, and some have queried whe-
ther what has been traditionally considered to be‘‘paraphilic’’
might actually reflect normative sexual interests (Ahlers et al.,
2011;Joyal,Cossette,&Lapierre,2015;Ogas&Gaddam,2011).
These researchers, in particular, urge for less emphasis being pl-
aced on the content of sexual fantasies as being indicators of an
individual’s primary erotic preference and, instead, focus on
the effect of particular sexual fantasies when labeling someth-
ingasabnormal(Joyaletal.,2015).Itisworthnoting,however,
thatnon-paraphilicindividualshavesexualfantasieswithlargely

to document the frequency of paraphilic fantasies exhibited
among asexual individuals as a means of discerning whether

Asexuality as a Unique Sexual Orientation
AccordingtoLeVayand Baldwin(2012),sexualorientationis
definedasaninternalmechanism thatdirectsa person’ssexual
andromantic dispositiontoward females,males, or both, to
varyingdegrees.Manyresearchersendorsethisview,andplace
a stronger emphasis on sexual attraction, rather than overt
behavior, in conceptualizing sexual orientation based on the
notionthatsexualattractionisthepsychologicalcoreofsexual
orientation(Bogaert,2003).Acriticismofthisdefinitionisthat
itsuggeststheco-developmentandconcordanceofsexualdesire
and romantic attraction, yet a large body of research challenges
their inter-connectedness (Diamond, 2003). If one adopts this de
finition of sexual orientation, then one might conclude that
asexuality is actually the absence of sexual orientation (and
we would argue that this question has been inadequately expl
ored by the existing science). Asexual advocates have main-
tained, however, that asexuality is a unique sexual orientation
group, and have lobbied for its inclusion in sexual minority
societies and pride day events. Scherrer (2008) highlighted the
similarities between asexuality and other sexual minorities, sp
ecifically in that both have challenged the connection with
medical institutions (with homosexuality historically being
classified as a psychiatric illness, and skeptics of asexuality
suggesting that it is a manifestation of a psychological disor-
der). Both have also used networking to create identity-based
communities(e.g.,Jay,2008).Weacknowledgethatrelyingon
these socio-cultural similarities between asexuals and other
sexual minority groups, alone, to justify asexuality as a unique
sexual orientation might be inappropriate, and that stronger evi
dencesupportingasexualityasauniqueorientationisneededto
make this conclusion.
The focus on sexual attraction, rather than on sexual behav-
ior,fitsother definitionsof sexualorientation, andfitsBogaert’s
(2006) definition, which emphasizes that attraction is the
psychologicalcoreofsexualorientation.Byextension,Bogaert
(2015) also proposed that asexuality be considered as a unique
sexual orientation. The finding that asexual individuals have
Arch Sex Behav
123
 reported‘‘alwaysfeelingthisway’’(Brottoetal., 2010;Van
Houdenhoveetal.,2015a) suggeststhattheir lackofattraction
may be lifelong, and is an innate personal characteristic rather
than a reaction to an adverse (sexual) encounter.
One piece of indirect evidence supporting the innate develop-
ment of a sexual orientation stems from biomarkers research.
Bogaert(2004,2013)postulatedthatasexualwomen’stendency
to have atypical menstrual characteristics relative to sexual
women,shorterstature,andagreaternumberofhealthproblems
provides support for the role of early biological influences on
asexuality. Further evidence for the prenatal origins of asex-
uality comes from a study of 1283 individuals where asexual
women had a significantly greater chance of being non-right-
handed(OR = 2.51)thanandrophilicwomen,andasexualmen
were similarly more likely to be non-righthanded (OR= 2.39)
than gynephilic men, with over a quarter of the asexual par-
ticipants being non-righthanded (Yule, Brotto, & Gorzalka,
2014b). Given that handedness has been regarded as a bio-
logical marker associated with sexual orientation develop-
ment(Lalumie
`re,Blanchard,&Zucker,2000),thesefindings
provideindirectevidenceforasexualityasasexualorientation.
In the same study, further evidence for the prenatal origins of
asexualitystemfromthefindingthatasexualrighthandedmale
participants had significantly more older brothers than right-
handed gynephilic participants (Yule et al., 2014b). The mag-
nitude of the non-righthanded effect seen in Yule et al. was

pants(Lalumie
`reetal.,2000)(OR= 2.39–2.51vs1.39,respec-
tively),providingnoteworthysupportforthestrengthofthisasso-
ciation in asexuals.
Fraternal birth order, another biomarker associated with sex-
ual orientation in men (Blanchard, 2008; Blanchard & Bogaert,
1996), is associated with the maternal immune hypothesis, by
whichagreaternumberofmaternalolderbrothersislinkedwith
a greater likelihood of (homosexual) sexual orientation in men.

innateness of asexuality.
Seto’s (2012) exploration of whether pedophilia should be
consideredauniquesexualorientationmaybeusefulforexplor-
ing whether asexuality similarly fits the definition of a sexual
orientation. Seto suggested that three criteria need to be
considered: namely age of onset, one’s sexual and romantic
behavior,andthestabilityoftheattractionovertime.Regarding
the first criterion, qualitative studies (Brotto et al., 2010; Car-
rigan,2011;Scherrer,2008;VanHoudenhoveetal.,2015a)rev
ealasexualindividualstohave‘‘alwaysfeltthiswayeversinceI
can remember,’’and to deny a significant event in their life that
triggered the loss of sexual attraction. The rise of the Internet,
and AVEN in particular, may have facilitated language and a
conversation around asexuality, but the empirical literature com
bined with discussions on the AVEN forum converge to pa-
int a picture in which the asexual identity has always been
present.
In regard to Seto’s (2012) second criterion pertaining to
behavior, he noted that‘‘the strongest test of sexual orientation
iswhomapersonwouldchooseinahypotheticalsituationwhere
theycouldfreelyhavesex,withoutnegativeconsequences,when
presentedwithalternatechoices’’(p.234).Whereasthereisgreat
variabilityintheextentofromanticattraction(ordesirefora
romantic partner) held among asexual individuals, there is
relative consistency in their lack of motivation for sex. Many
reportthatsexissomethingthatthey,frankly,canlivewithout.
Among asexual individuals who do engage or have engaged
in sexual activity, it is likely that partnership with a sexually
identifying individual accounts for their sexual activity (Van
Houdenhoveetal.,2015a).Ifthisistrue,thenasexualitywould
indeed meet Seto’s second criterion for asexuality as a sexual
orientation since their (relative) lack of sexual behavior par-
allels their lack of sexual attraction.
The third criterion, temporal stability, refers to the stability in
one’s preferences (or lack thereof in the case of asexuality) over
time.UsingdatafromWavesIIIandIVfromtheNationalLong-
itudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), Cranney
(2016) examined the temporal stability for the item‘‘lack of sex-
ual attraction’’from Waves III to IV. Among 25 participants in
WaveIIIwhoreportednosexualattraction,mostdidnotcontinue
toreportalackofsexualattractioninWaveIV,andonlythreepar-
ticipantswho reported no sexual attractionduring Wave III went

ual individual’s sexual orientation, and slightly higher kappas
(0.2–0.4) for the other sexual minority groups. Moreover, the
existenceofdemi-sexualindividuals(i.e.,apersonwhoidentifies
as asexual until they form a strong emotional connection with
someone) and gray-sexual individuals, who fall somewhere in
thespectrumbetweenasexualandsexual,suggeststhattheremay
be fluidity associated with asexuality identification. Sexual flu-
idity has been especially described in samples of women more
sothanmen(asreviewedbyDiamond,2012),andalthoughasex
ualshavenotbeenstudiedinthisbodyofresearch,wecannotrule
out that fluidity also applies to asexually identifying individuals.

(Bogaert,2004,2013).Thesetwoobservations(fluidityamongase
xuals and greater prevalence among women over men) may be
related, and should be explored in the future. In light of these
findings, we conclude that there may be only weak support for
Arch Sex Behav
123
 Seto’s (2012) third criterion of temporal stability among asexual
individuals,thoughofcourse,thepresenceoffluiditydoesnotneg
ate something as constituting a sexual orientation.
Taken together, asexuals would meet only criteria one and
two, but not criterion three, of Seto’sconditions for meetinga
sexual orientation label; however, we must be mindful of the
concerns about studying temporal stability of orientation in
young adults.
Challenges to Considering Asexuality as a Unique
Sexual Orientation
There has been a strong drive from within the asexuality com-
munity to accept asexuality as a sexual orientation, and an
associated openness to research efforts directed at finding evi-
dence for biological innateness, presumably because the‘‘born
that way’’argument may attenuate stigma directed towards
asexuals.However,wemustcriticallyevaluatethetenetthat
evidence of biological correlates or predispositions to asexu-
ality are sufficient for classifying asexuality as a unique sexual
orientation.WeagreewithBogaert(2006),whoarguesagainst
thislineofreasoning,andnotesthat‘‘evenifanessentialistposition
is correct, a biological predisposition is not the same as an actual
sexual orientation’’(pp. 246–247). Gressga
¨rd (2013) also adopts
thiscautionaryviewwithregardtoasexuality.Furthermore,thecau
se(s)ofasexualorientationshouldnotbeequatedwiththepheno-
menonitself,andtheremaybemultiplecausesleadingtothefinal
(asexual) outcome.
One must also consider whether sexual orientation classi-
fication is a process of exclusion, as we have done in this brief
review by first considering whether asexuality is a psychiatric
condition, a sexual dysfunction, and a paraphilia. However, th
ese categories are not mutually exclusive, and even if asexu-
alitywerebestplacedwithinasexualorientationclassification,
thisdoesnotexcludethepossibilitythatitcanalsooverlapwith
theothercategories.Inotherwords,itispossiblethatanindivid
ual may have an asexual orientation, have a psychiatric dis-
order (e.g., major depressive disorder), and have a sexual
dysfunction (orgasmic disorder) simultaneously. In a similar
vein, self-identified asexuals are a heterogeneous group (with
respect to romantic attraction, extent of partnered and solitary
sexual behavior, frequency and content of masturbatory fan-
tasies,relationshipstatus,medicalandpsychologicalcorrelates;
Van Houdenhove, Gijs, T’Sjoen, & Enzlin, 2015b), thus we
must recognize the possibility that it does not fall neatly into
a single category for all asexually identifying individuals.
The category of individuals who adopt the label‘‘asexual’’
appears to be becoming more heterogeneous since Bogaert’s
(2004) original paper. The most recent AVEN Community Ce
nsus(Ginozaetal.,2014)revealedwidespreaddiversityinque
stions about participants’ sexual orientation, gender identity,
and romantic orientation. As such, it is likely that how one
experiences their asexual identity is likely to differ compared
to others who fall under the same asexual umbrella. Future
research should aim to explore the different trajectories that
had led these different subgroups toward adopting an asexual
identity.
Conclusions
Kinsey first defined the lack of sexual attraction inherent to
asexualityasbelongingtocategoryX(Kinsey,Pomeroy,&
Martin 1948), yet rigorous empirical research on this category
has emerged only over the past decade. Research employing a
variety of methodologies, and drawn from many different dis-
ciplines, has examined the nature of asexuality, with a focus on
howtobestconceptualizeit.Here,webrieflyrevieweddata
addressing the possibility that asexuality is a psychiatric dis-
order (or a symptom of one), or that it is a sexual dysfunction.
We conclude thatthere isnot sufficient evidence tosupport either
of these classifications for asexuality. There issome preliminary
support,however,foratleastasubgroupamongasexualindivid
uals to have a paraphilic characterization, and more rese
arch exploring the persistence and pervasiveness of paraphilic
fantasies may be useful to this line of inquiry. Using criteria that
have been applied to considering whether pedophilia should be
consideredauniquesexualorientationornot,weconcludethat
there is modest support for asexuality’s placement as a unique
sexual orientation. There is, however, likely as much variability
amongasexualindividuals’lackofsexualattraction(andwhether
it also extends to lack of romantic attraction) as there is among
sexual individuals’ presence of sexual attraction.
