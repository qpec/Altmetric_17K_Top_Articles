ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether the incidence of pneumonia, 
peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, empyema, 
meningitis, intracranial abscess, and Lemierre’s 
syndrome is higher in general practices that prescribe 
fewer antibiotics for self limiting respiratory tract 
infections (RTIs).
Design
Cohort study.
setting
 610 UK general practices from the UK Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink.
PartiCiPants
Registered patients with 45.5 million person years of 
follow-up from 2005 to 2014.
exPOsures
Standardised proportion of RTI consultations with 
antibiotics prescribed for each general practice, and 
rate of antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs per 1000 
registered patients.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Incidence of pneumonia, peritonsillar abscess, 
mastoiditis, empyema, meningitis, intracranial 
abscess, and Lemierre’s syndrome, adjusting for age 
group, sex, region, deprivation fifth, RTI consultation 
rate, and general practice.
results
From 2005 to 2014 the proportion of RTI consultations 
with antibiotics prescribed decreased from 53.9% to 
50.5% in men and from 54.5% to 51.5% in women. 
From 2005 to 2014, new episodes of meningitis, 
mastoiditis, and peritonsillar abscess decreased 
annually by 5.3%, 4.6%, and 1.0%, respectively, 
whereas new episodes of pneumonia increased by 
0.4%. Age and sex standardised incidences for 
pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess were higher for 
practices in the lowest fourth of antibiotic prescribing 
compared with the highest fourth. The adjusted 
relative risk increases for a 10% reduction in antibiotic 
prescribing were 12.8% (95% confidence interval 7.8% 
to 17.5%, P<0.001) for pneumonia and 9.9% (5.6% to 
14.0%, P<0.001) for peritonsillar abscess. If a general 
practice with an average list size of 7000 patients 
reduces the proportion of RTI consultations with 
antibiotics prescribed by 10%, then it might observe 1.1 
(95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.5) more cases of 
pneumonia each year and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.3) more cases 
of peritonsillar abscess each decade. Mastoiditis, 
empyema, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and 
Lemierre’s syndrome were similar in frequency at low 
prescribing and high prescribing practices.
COnClusiOns
General practices that adopt a policy to reduce 
antibiotic prescribing for RTIs might expect a slight 
increase in the incidence of treatable pneumonia and 
peritonsillar abscess. No increase is likely in 
mastoiditis, empyema, bacterial meningitis, 
intracranial abscess, or Lemierre’s syndrome. Even a 
substantial reduction in antibiotic prescribing was 
predicted to be associated with only a small increase 
in numbers of cases observed overall, but caution 
might be required in subgroups at higher risk of 
pneumonia.
Introduction
Concern is growing that the widespread and sometimes 
unnecessary use of antibiotics is leading to the devel-
opment of antimicrobial drug resistance and poten-
tially to infections caused by resistant organisms that 
are difficult to treat.1  Reducing the inappropriate use of 
antibiotics, as well as ensuring that they can be used 
when needed, represent important components of a 
strategy to control infectious diseases.2  In the health-
care sector, attention has focused on primary care, 
including first point-of-contact ambulatory care, where 
a high proportion of antibiotics are prescribed. About 
60% of antibiotics prescribed in primary care are for

Widespread unnecessary utilisation of antibiotics is leading to an increase in 
antimicrobial drug resistance
Many respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are largely self limiting, but antibiotics 
continue to be prescribed for about 50% of consultations for RTIs in primary care
RTIs are infrequently associated with complications, including pneumonia, 
peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, meningitis, intracranial abscess, and Lemierre’s 
syndrome, but it is not known whether these are more common in general practices 
that prescribe antibiotics less often
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
General practices prescribing antibiotics less often for RTIs had slightly higher rates 
of pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess than higher prescribing practices
There was no evidence that mastoiditis, empyema, meningitis, intracranial 
abscess, or Lemierre’s syndrome were more frequent at low prescribing practices
Even a substantial reduction in antibiotic prescribing was predicted to be 
associated with only a small increase in numbers of cases observed, and this would 
be expected to reduce the risks of antibiotic resistance, the side effects of 
antibiotics, and the medicalisation of largely self limiting illnesses

respiratory tract infections (RTIs).3  RTIs, including 
common colds, sore throat, cough, acute bronchitis, 
otitis media, and sinusitis are often self limiting and 
usually improve without specific treatment.4  Antibiotic 
treatment of RTIs offers negligible benefit to affected 
patients5  and is often associated with side effects.6 
 
Guidance in the United Kingdom recommends that 
either a no antibiotic prescribing strategy or a delayed 
antibiotic prescribing strategy should be agreed for 
most patients with RTIs.3  Nevertheless, around 36% of 
common colds continue to be treated with antibiotics, 
as do 40% of episodes of sore throat, 70% of otitis 
media, and 90% of sinusitis.7  Wide variation exists 
among general practices. About 50% of all general 
practice consultations for RTIs result in an antibiotic 
prescription, but some general practices issue prescrip-
tions at a rate of more than 80% and others at less than 
20%.8  This contrasts with practice in the Netherlands, 
where 22.5% of RTI episodes in 2010 were treated with 
antibiotics.9  A considerable amount of research has 
been done10-12  to develop interventions that might help 
general practitioners to reduce the rate of antibiotic pre-
scribing for RTIs. This has been translated into policy 
guidance3  and public campaigns13 to control unneces-
sary antibiotic use.
Clinical concern that reducing antibiotic use might 
increase the risk of complications following RTIs might 
be realistic. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that 
antibiotics may reduce the risk of suppurative compli-
cations of RTIs,5  but the more serious complications are 
generally too rare to evaluate precisely in randomised 
studies. A cohort study in 162 general practices in the 
General Practice Research Database from 1991 to 2001 
evaluated the effect of antibiotic treatment on the inci-
dence of pneumonia after upper RTI, peritonsillar 
abscess after sore throat, and mastoiditis after otitis 
media.14  The results suggested that antibiotic treatment 
was associated with lower odds of each of these compli-
cations, but the overall risk of complications was gener-
ally small and the number of patients who would have 
to be treated to avoid one complication was estimated to 
be in excess of 4000. However, pneumonia was more 
common; in people aged 65 or more an estimated one 
case for every 39 antibiotic prescriptions might be 
avoided. Infections of the middle ear or sinuses may 
rarely be complicated by intracranial abscess.15 
 
Lemierre’s syndrome,16 from thrombophlebitis of the 
internal jugular vein associated with Fusobacterium 
necrophorum infection, is a rare complication of sore 
throat,16 but F necrophorum might be frequently detect-
able in patients with symptoms of sore throat.17 
18  The 
annual number of cases of Lemierre’s syndrome in 
England was reported to have increased from 19 in 1997 
to 34 in 1999, prompting a reminder from the chief med-
ical officer that some symptoms of sore throat may 
require antibiotic treatment.19  In addition to concerns 
about complications, medical practitioners may be con-
cerned about the potential consequences of diagnostic 
misclassification. The initial symptoms of meningitis 
may sometimes resemble an influenza-like illness.20 
Awareness of the possibility of a more serious diagnosis 
might prompt general practitioners to issue an antibi-
otic prescription for conditions in which antibiotics are 
not usually indicated.
These observations raise important questions for a 
policy to reduce antibiotic prescribing for RTIs in pri-
mary care: Is there a safe level of antibiotic prescribing 
for RTIs? What target can general practices safely adopt 
in reducing the proportion of consultations for RTIs 
with antibiotics prescribed? Is there a threshold for 
antibiotic prescribing below which complications may 
increase? We evaluated the safety of a policy to reduce 
antibiotic prescribing for RTIs in primary care and the 
incidence of pneumonia, peritonsillar abscess, mas-
toiditis, empyema, meningitis, intracranial abscess, 
and Lemierre’s syndrome. We determined whether 
these complications were more common in general 
practices that prescribe fewer antibiotics for self limit-
ing RTIs than higher prescribing practices. We aimed to 
use this information to quantify the potential clinical 
and public health impact of changes in antibiotic pre-
scribing practice.
Methods
The data source for the study was the UK Clinical Prac-
tice Research Datalink (CPRD).21  This is a large database 
containing fully anonymised electronic records from 
about 7% of UK general practices from 1987 to the pres-
ent. CPRD data are considered representative of the UK 
population, and the high quality of CPRD data have 
been confirmed in many studies.21 For the present study, 
we included data for the 10 year period from 2005 to 
2014. During this period the CPRD included data for an 
open cohort of about 4.5 million registered patients.
Definition of infective complications of rtis
We evaluated the number of first episodes of infective 
complications in the entire registered population of 
CPRD from 2005 to 2014. Such complications were 
defined using Read medical codes recorded in partici-
pants’ electronic health records. The Read code classifi-
cation represents a terminology used to code primary 
care electronic health records in the UK.22 Electronic 
health records include diagnoses recorded at primary 
care consultations and home visits. In addition, the 
CPRD referral file includes coded data for hospital refer-
rals and hospital discharges. In analyses we evaluated 
pneumonia (57 codes), empyema (14 codes), peritonsil-
lar abscess (5 codes), mastoiditis (13 codes), bacterial 
meningitis (19 codes), and intracranial abscess (14 
codes). Codes for “pneumonia” were drawn from sec-
tion H2 of the Read code classification, which includes 
codes for “pneumonia and influenza.” Codes were 
included if they indicated the presence of pneumonia 
without a viral cause. “Bacterial meningitis” included 
codes for meningococcal meningitis, meningococcal 
septicaemia, pneumococcal meningitis, and haemoph-
ilus meningitis, as well as unspecified bacterial menin-
gitis. Code lists are available from the authors. Data 
were extracted for all participants with records of infec-
tive complications from 2005 to 2014. We defined inci-
dent events as the first record of an event in a participant

that was recorded more than 12 months after the start of 
the participant’s CPRD record. Sex, year, and age group 
were included as individual level covariates. Nine 10 
year age groups were employed, with categories of 0 to 
14 years and 85 years or more. We aggregated incident 
events by year, age group, sex, and general practice. 
Person time for the registered CPRD population was 
estimated by year, age group, sex, and general practice 
to estimate rates of infective complications. Cluster 
level covariates included CPRD region, with 10 regions 
in England, as well as Wales, Scotland, and Northern 
Ireland. Deprivation fifth was included, based on gen-
eral practice level data for indices of multiple depriva-
tion score (IMD 2010) for England, and equivalent 
scores in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Definition of rti consultation and antibiotic 
prescribing rates
We estimated age standardised measures for RTI con-
sultations and antibiotic prescribing as reported previ-
ously.7 
23  For each CPRD general practice we estimated 
the rate of RTI consultations per 1000 registered 
patients, the antibiotic prescribing rate for RTI per 1000 
registered patients, and the proportion (%) of RTI con-
sultations with antibiotics prescribed. These prescrib-
ing measures were estimated on a sample of CPRD data 
because it was not feasible and our licence did not 
allow us to perform the analysis on the entire CPRD 
database. Participants were sampled from all accept-
able patients included in CPRD. A random sample of 75 
currently registered patients was drawn without 
replacement for each year from 2005 to 2014. This gave 
a maximum sample of 750 participants, with up to 7500 
person years of observation for each practice. We aimed 
to achieve a total sample of fewer than 0.5 million, and 
the total sample for analysis was 411 226 participants 
from 643 general practices. This allowed us to estimate 
practice specific proportions with a 1% margin of error. 
For participants in the sample, we estimated person 
years as denominator from the start of CPRD registra-
tion or 1 January 2005, to the end of the participant’s 
CPRD record or 31 December 2014. We identified self 
limiting RTIs using medical codes recorded during gen-
eral practice consultations. These were classified into 
five groups following the recommendations of the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence3 : 
colds and “upper respiratory tract infections”; sore 
throat, including pharyngitis and laryngitis; cough and 
acute bronchitis; otitis media; and rhinosinusitis. Acute 
bronchitis was included because current recommenda-
tions are to avoid antibiotic treatment.3 Consultations 
for RTIs were identified, and we selected first consulta-
tions within a 14 day time window. Data for participants 
aged 100 or older were excluded. We identified antibi-
otic prescriptions issued on the same day as consulta-
tions for respiratory problems and then estimated for 
each general practice the rate of consultations for RTIs 
per 1000 person years, rate of antibiotic prescribing for 
RTIs per 1000 person years, and proportion (%) of RTI 
consultations with antibiotics prescribed. Rates and 
proportions were standardised for age and sex using 
the 2013 European standard population. After exclud-
ing practices with insufficient data, because of short 
periods of contributing to CPRD, we estimated rates for 
610 CPRD general practices.
statistical analysis
In the final stage of the analysis, we estimated the num-
bers of infective complications with person years at 
risk, in relation to general practice specific rates of RTI 
consultations and antibiotic prescribing. Mixed effects 
Poisson models were fitted using the hglm package24  in 
the R program.25  General practice was fitted as a ran-
dom effect. The log of person years was included as off-
set. Fixed effects included sex, year, age group, region, 
and  
deprivation fifth. We evaluated the association of 
age standardised RTI consultation rate with rates of 
infective complications. After adjusting for the RTI con-
sultation rate, we evaluated the association of the anti-
biotic prescribing rate and the antibiotic prescribing 
proportion with infective complication rates. Incident 
rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) were estimated 
for each fourth of RTI consultation rate, antibiotic

prescribing rate, or antibiotic prescribing proportion, 
using the lowest fourth for reference. The RTI consulta-
tion rate, antibiotic prescribing rate, and antibiotic pre-
scribing proportion were also fitted as continuous 
predictors, and we estimated incident rate ratios for 
each 10 unit change in the predictor. We evaluated 
whether the addition of quadratic terms improved 
goodness of fit. As there were small numbers of events 
for intracranial abscess, and mixed effects models did 
not converge, we omitted the random effect for general 
practice for this outcome. Regression models were not 
fitted for Lemierre’s syndrome because this condition 
was rare. The ggplot226  and forestplot27 packages in R 
were used to present the results.
To present the clinical implications of these findings, 
we calculated the number of events expected in a gen-
eral practice with 7000 patients (the general practice 
mean list size for England) during 10 years of follow-up. 
To estimate the expected number of consultations for 
RTIs we used the median (95% range) for the RTI con-
sultation rate. To estimate expected numbers of compli-
cations and antibiotic prescriptions we used the disease 
incidence and distribution of antibiotic prescribing pro-
portion for the highest prescribing fourth. We used the 
relative risk increase for a 10% change in antibiotic pre-
scribing from the Poisson model to estimate the 
expected change in number of infective complications.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. Results will be dissemi-
nated to relevant patient communities through news 
media.
Results
Data were analysed for 610 UK Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD) general practices, with 
45 465 201 registered person years of observation from 
2005 to 2014. Figure 1  presents data for RTI consulta-
tions and associated antibiotic prescribing between 
2005 and 2014. The RTI consultation rate per 100 000 
continued a long term decline7 during the period, 
decreasing from 256 to 220 per 100 000 in men and from 
351 to 307 per 100 000 in women. The antibiotic pre-
scribing rate for RTIs declined from 128 to 106 per 
100 000 in men and from 184 to 155 per 100 000 in 
women. The proportion of RTI consultations with anti-
biotics prescribed declined from 53.9% to 50.5% in men 
and from 54.5% to 51.5% in women.

declining trends in incidence of peritonsillar abscess 
(1% yearly), mastoiditis (4.6%), and meningitis (5.3%), 
pneumonia showed an increase of 0.4% yearly, and 
empyema and intracranial abscess showed no clear 
change over time.
General practices were divided into fourths accord-
ing to the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiot-
ics prescribed (table 2 ). General practices in the highest 
fourth prescribed antibiotics at a median 65% (range 
58% to 79%) of RTI consultations, whereas general 
practices in the lowest fourth prescribed antibiotics at a 
median 38% (29% to 44%) of RTI consultations. Table 2 
shows the age standardised incidence rates for each of 
the infective complications. The incidence of pneumo-
nia was 157 (95% confidence interval 154 to 159) per 
100 000 at low prescribing practices but 119 (117 to 121) 
per 100 000 at high prescribing practices. The corre-
sponding values for peritonsillar abscess were 15.6 (15.5 
to 15.8) per 100 000 and 12.9 (12.8 to 13.0) per 100 000. 
Mastoiditis, empyema, bacterial meningitis, and intra-
cranial abscess showed lower incidence rates, which 
did not appear to be associated with antibiotic prescrib-
ing category. Fourteen cases of Lemierre’s syndrome 
occurred, which were evenly distributed between pre-
scribing categories, with an overall incidence rate of 
0.31 per million.
Figure 3 presents the occurrence of infective compli-
cations according to the rate of RTI consultations. 
 
General practices in the highest fourth for RTI consulta-
tion rate had higher incidence rates for pneumonia and 
mastoiditis (1.35, 1.14 to 1.61, P=0.001 and 1.67
, 1.20 to 
2.33, P=0.002, respectively) compared with general 
practices in the lowest fourth. Peritonsillar abscess, 
empyema, bacterial meninigitis, and intracranial 
abscess were not associated with the general practice 
RTI consultation rate.
Figure 4 shows the association between the propor-
tion of RTI consultations with antibiotics prescribed 
and the incidence of infective complications. The risk of 
pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess decreased as the 
antibiotic prescribing proportion for RTI increased, but 
there was no clear evidence of an association for mas-
toiditis, empyema, meningitis, and intracranial 
abscess. For general practices in the highest fourth of 
antibiotic prescribing, the incidence rate ratio for pneu-
monia was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.82, 
P<0.001), and for peritonsillar abscess was 0.78 (0.68 to 
0.90, P<0.001) compared with the lowest fourth.
Figure 5 shows the association between the antibiotic 
prescribing rate and infective complications. Pneumo-
nia showed an association with the antibiotic prescrib-
ing rate (incidence rate ratio for highest fourth 0.74, 
0.58 to 0.95, P=0.02). Peritonsillar abscess showed a 
weak association (0.84, 0.68 to 1.03, P=0.09) but the 
other infective complications did not. The antibiotic 
prescribing rate is determined by the RTI consultation 
rate and the proportion of consultations with antibiot-
ics prescribed. It is correlated with both the RTI consul-
tation rate (r=0.82) and the antibiotic prescribing 
proportion (r=0.66).
Table 3 shows incident rate ratios estimated after fit-
ting the predictors as continuous variables. These esti-
mates are consistent with linear associations; adding 
quadratic terms did not improve the goodness of fit. An 
increasing RTI consultation rate was associated with an 
increasing incidence of pneumonia and mastoiditis. An 
increasing antibiotic prescribing proportion was asso-
ciated with a declining incidence of pneumonia and 
peritonsillar abscess. Each 10% increase in antibiotic

prescribing proportion was associated with a 12.8% 
(95% confidence interval 7.8% to 17.5%) relative 
decrease in pneumonia and a 9.9% (5.6% to 14.0%) 
decrease in peritonsillar abscess. Associations with the 
antibiotic prescribing rate fitted as a linear predictor 
were consistent with those for the antibiotic prescribing 
proportion. In additional analyses, we found that the 
incidence rate ratio associating the antibiotic prescrib-
ing proportion with pneumonia was similar for the pop-
ulation aged less than 65 years and 65 years or older.
A general practice with the mean list size for England 
of 7000 registered patients is expected to have 20 300 
consultations (95% range 11 340 to 30 380) for RTIs over 
10 years (table 4 ). A general practice of this size, with 
an average RTI consultation rate, might issue 13 195 
(11 744 to 16 037) antibiotic prescriptions during this 
period if it is in the highest prescribing fourth. If the 
practice reduces the proportion of RTI consultations 
with antibiotics prescribed by 10% it will issue 2030 
(1134 to 3038) fewer antibiotic prescriptions for RTIs. 
This reduction in antibiotic prescribing is expected to 
be associated with 1.1 (0.6 to 1.5) more cases of pneumo-
nia each year and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.3) more cases of periton-
sillar abscess each decade (table 4). The number of 
cases of mastoiditis, empyema, bacterial meningitis, 
intracranial abscess, and Lemierre’s syndrome are not 
expected to increase.
discussion
We used a large dataset of electronic health records to 
investigate the safety of reducing unnecessary antibi-
otic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in 
primary care. The results show that general practices 
prescribing fewer antibiotics for RTIs may expect to 
have a slightly higher incidence of pneumonia and peri-
tonsillar abscess than higher prescribing general prac-
tices. If a general practice with an average list size of 
7000 patients reduced the proportion of RTI consulta-
tions with antibiotics prescribed by 10%, it might 
encounter about one additional case of pneumonia 
each year and one additional case of peritonsillar 
abscess each decade. Changes will be proportionately 
greater for larger reductions in antibiotic prescribing. 
These estimates represent averages across general prac-
tice populations, but complications might be fewer 
than expected if general practitioners are able effec-
tively to stratify antibiotic prescribing according to level 
of risk. There was no evidence that diagnoses of mas-
toiditis, empyema, bacterial meningitis, or intracranial 
abscess might increase. Lemierre’s syndrome was rare, 
with about one case per two million person years, but 
there was no evidence that this was more common at 
low prescribing practices. This is reassuring in view of 
recent suggestions that F necrophorum may often be 
present in patients with sore throat.18  These estimates 
must be viewed in the context of quantitatively import-
ant declining secular trends in incidence for several 
infective complications of RTI, including peritonsillar 
abscess, mastoiditis, and meningitis. Bacterial menin-
gitis from pneumococcal, meningococcal, or haemoph-
ilus infection has declined after the introduction of 
vaccination programmes.28  However, the incidence of 
pneumonia showed a slight increase over time, consis-
tent with previous studies based on hospital admis-
sions.29 
30
Reducing the proportion of RTI consultations with 
antibiotics prescribed by 10% is expected to be accom-
panied by some 2000 fewer antibiotic prescriptions for 
each practice over 10 years. Benefits to individual 
patients from avoiding antibiotics include reductions 
in common adverse reactions to antibiotics, such as 
rashes, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which may affect 
10% of patients,6  as well as less common side effects 
such as anaphylaxis. Benefits to general practices may 
include a demedicalisation of RTIs followed by a 
decline in the rate of consultations, since previous 
observational studies show that higher prescribing 
general practices receive more consultations for RTIs.31 
 
Trial evidence shows that even one antibiotic prescrip-
tion increases the likelihood of reconsultation for a 
new episode of an RTI.32 Most of the complications 
identified do not require hospital admission and cur-
rently respond well to antibiotics, so simply the occur-
rence of an uncommon complication rate is not in

itself a justification for more widespread prescribing of 
antibiotics for initially uncomplicated presentations. 
The results did not support a threshold for safe or 
unsafe prescribing levels. Inspection of forest plots 
suggested some departure from linearity, but addition 
of non-linear terms did not improve the goodness of fit 
of regression models.
strengths and weaknesses in relation to other 
studies
Previous studies have consistently shown high levels of 
unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics for RTIs in pri-
mary care.33  While there has been a declining trend in 
the consultation rate for RTIs,7  the proportion of con-
sultations with antibiotics prescribed has changed lit-
tle,7  despite the efforts of researchers, clinicians, and 
policymakers to bring about changes. General practi-
tioners may often be concerned to meet patients’ expec-
tations for antibiotic prescriptions,34  but both patients 
and prescribers might also have concerns about the 
safety of non-prescribing strategies.34  One study14 pro-
vided evidence that antibiotics reduced the risk of 
pneumonia, mastoiditis, and peritonsillar abscess but 
did not quantify the potential population impact of 
these complications.
The present results represent averages across general 
practice populations. Diversity among the population 
of patients at risk of RTIs is considerable. Current man-
agement guidelines for RTIs recommend that specific 
groups of patients should be considered to have posi-
tive indications for antibiotic treatment. An immediate 
antibiotic prescription is recommended if patients have 
clinical features suggestive of serious illness or compli-
cations,35  have comorbidities, or are very young or very 
old.3  Further research is needed to evaluate whether the 
present results will be confirmed when subgroups that 
might be at higher risk, including older adults, are ana-
lysed separately. It is possible that general practices 
with the same overall level of antibiotic prescribing may 
differ in the appropriateness of their management of 
patients with defined markers of vulnerability, and this 
could influence the rate of complications. However, the 
clinical features of an RTI episode may have only lim-
ited predictive value for the future occurrence of com-
plications, and a high proportion of complications 
might occur in patients who seem to be at low risk.36  A 
delayed antibiotic prescribing strategy, in which a pre-
scription is issued but only used if symptoms fail to 
improve, is sometimes recommended as a method for 
reducing antibiotic utilisation in the management of 
RTIs.3 
37  Delayed antibiotic prescribing may be as effec-
tive as immediate use of antibiotics in the prevention of 
complications of sore throat.4  The development and 
application of point-of-care testing to guide antibiotic 
prescribing might have a future role in identifying those 
who would potentially benefit from antibiotic treat-
ment.38 
39
strengths and weaknesses of this study
This study included more than 600 general practices, 
with a registered population of more than four million 
patients and 45 million person years of observation. 
Consequently, the study provided precise estimates for 
the more common outcomes evaluated. We acknowl-
edge that there was lower power to evaluate potential 
changes in less common outcomes. We can conclude 
that the absolute risks of mastoiditis, empyema, intra-
cranial abscess, and Lemierre’s syndrome remain 
small, even in practices with low rates of antibiotic pre-
scribing. This study adopted a population perspective, 
aiming to quantify the outcomes of either high pre-
scribing or low prescribing strategies in the manage-
ment of RTIs. Consequently, we evaluated changes in 
infective complications at the level of the general prac-
tice population. The research did not deal with varia-
tion in prescribing at the level of the individual doctor. 
The research did not show whether individual patients 
who experienced complications received antibiotics. 
Conclusions might differ if individual level analyses 
showed that complications arise in patients who were 
treated with antibiotics. We did not evaluate the 
 
outcomes of individual patients identified as having 
 
complications in this study. Further research is 
required to evaluate the severity of complications, such

as pneumonia, and their outcomes, including mortal-
ity. Future studies might also make use of linked hospi-
tal episode data, which in recent years have become 
available for selected CPRD practices in England to 
evaluate patients in more detail who have been admit-
ted to hospital. The risk of complications associated 
with different classes of antibiotics also merits study. 
We acknowledge that there may be other complica-
tions, such as a proportion of all cases of septicaemia 
diagnosed in primary care, which might follow from an 
RTI. We acknowledge several sources of misclassifica-
tion: we used a sample of the UK Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD) to estimate consultation and 
prescribing rates; there is variation among general 
practices in the use of diagnostic categories40 ; general 
practice populations may vary in their use of out-of-
hours and emergency services, whose generally higher 
antibiotic prescribing may not be captured in CPRD; 
and some general practices may use delayed antibiotic 
prescribing strategies,4  but these were not distin-
guished in the analysis of prescriptions issued. Use of 
near patient testing might possibly have contributed to 
better diagnosis during the period. These forms of mis-
classification generally tend to diminish estimated 
associations but might cause bias if effects are differen-
tially distributed across prescribing categories. Diag-
nostic coding may have a subjective element41 and bias 
might arise if low prescribing practices are more likely 
than high prescribing practices to code pneumonia to 
justify the prescription of an antibiotic. The research 
utilised non-randomised data, and we adjusted for age, 
sex, region, deprivation category, and general practice, 
but it is possible unmeasured confounders might have 
biased the reported associations. We also caution that, 
in the analysis of large datasets “significant” results 
must be judged in relation to their clinical importance. 
Antibiotic prescribing in the UK is high compared with 
some international comparators, and we cannot be 
sure that the associations reported here would also 
hold at very low antibiotic prescribing levels.
Meaning of the study: possible explanations and 
implications for clinicians and policymakers
This study provides evidence that general practices pre-
scribing antibiotics less often at consultations for RTIs 
may experience a slight increase in the incidence of 
pneumonia and peritonsillar abscess, both of which 
would be expected to respond to treatment while bacte-
rial pathogens remain sensitive to antibiotics. No 
increase is likely in mastoiditis, empyema, meningitis, 
intracranial abscess, or Lemierre’s syndrome. Even a 
large reduction in antibiotic prescribing was predicted 
to be associated with only a small increase in numbers

of cases observed over a 10 year period, and this would 
be expected to reduce the risks of antibiotic resistance, 
the side effects of antibiotics, and the medicalisation of 
largely self limiting illnesses. The safety outcomes of no

ant aspect for communication to patients and the pub-

unanswered questions and future research
Further research is needed to quantify associations 
based on individual patient characteristics and consul-
tation patterns in primary care, particularly in children 
and older adults, as we used age standardised prescrib-
ing  
measures. However, associations might vary in dif-
ferent age groups. We also recommend that future 
randomised studies should be sufficiently large to eval-
uate safety outcomes of strategies to reduce antibiotic 
prescribing.

National Research Ethics Service Committee ethics approval for 
observational research studies. The research was conducted to inform 
a study funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment 
programme. The outcomes were selected from a wider range of safety 
outcomes proposed for the study because they were identified as 
being potentially associated with respiratory tract infections.
Data sharing: CPRD data were analysed under licence and are not 
available for sharing.
Transparency: The guarantor (MCG) affirms that the manuscript is an 
honest, accurate, and transparent account of the study being reported; 
that no important aspects of the study have been omitted; and that 
any discrepancies from the study as planned (and, if relevant, 
registered) have been explained.
