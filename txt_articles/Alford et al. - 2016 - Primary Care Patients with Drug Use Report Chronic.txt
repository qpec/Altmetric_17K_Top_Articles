BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common among patients
with drug use disorders. The prevalence of chronic pain
and its consequences in primary care patients who use
drugs is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To examine: 1) the prevalence of chronic
pain and pain-related dysfunction among primary care
patients who screen positive for drug use, and 2) the
prevalence of substance use to self-medicate chronic pain
in this population.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: This study included 589 adult patients
who screened positive for any illicit drug use or prescrip-
tion drug misuse, recruited from an urban, hospital-
based primary care practice.
MAIN MEASURES: Both pain and pain-related dysfunc-
tion were assessed by numeric rating scales, and grouped
as: (0) none, (1–3) mild, (4–6) moderate, (7–10) severe.
Questions were asked about the use of substances to treat
pain.
KEY RESULTS: Among 589 participants, chronic pain
was reported by 87 % (95 % CI: 84–90 %), with 13 % mild,
24 % moderate and 50 % severe. Pain-related dysfunction
was reported by 74 % (95 % CI: 70–78 %), with 15 % mild,
23 % moderate, and 36 % severe. Of the 576 that used
illicit drugs (i.e., marijuana, cocaine, and/or heroin), 51 %
reported using to treat pain (95 % CI: 47–55 % ). Of the
121 with prescription drug misuse, 81 % (95 % CI: 74–
88 %) used to treat pain. Of the 265 participants who
reported any heavy drinking in the past 3 months, 38 %
(95 % CI: 32–44 %) did so to treat pain compared to 79 %
(95 % CI: 68–90 %) of the 57 high-risk alcohol users.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain and pain-related dys-
function were the norm for primary care patients
who screened positive for drug use, with nearly one-
third reporting both severe pain and severe pain-
related dysfunction. Many patients using illicit drugs,
misusing prescription drugs and using alcohol
reported doing so in order to self-medicate their pain.
Pain needs to be addressed when patients are
counseled about their substance use.

INTRODUCTION
It is estimated that chronic pain currently affects approximate-
ly 100 million people in the US, and is one of the most
common reasons patients seek medical care.1 Chronic pain is
particularly common among those with drug use disorders.
One survey reported that 52 % of treatment-seeking, opioid
dependent veterans complained of moderate to severe chronic
pain.2 Cross-sectional surveys3–5 among patients treated with
medication assisted treatment (methadone, buprenorphine)
report a prevalence of chronic pain ranging from 36 % to
61 %.
According to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health,6 an estimated 9.4 % of the U.S. population has used an
illicit drug, including nonmedical use of prescription drugs in
the past month. In one recent study,7 10 % of patients in an
urban primary care setting screened positive for drug use
(illicit and prescription misuse). However, other studies over
the past decade have shown a wide range (3-26 %) of reported
drug use in primary care.8,9
The prevalence and severity of chronic pain and pain-
related dysfunction in patients who screen positive for the
full spectrum (at-risk use to substance use disorders) of
drug use (Illicit, prescription misuse) in primary care is
unknown. Because alcohol,10 many illicit drugs (e.g., her-
oin, marijuana) and prescription opioids have analgesic
properties, it is possible that patients are using these drugs
to self-medicate pain. While there are numerous reasons
why individuals use substances, one theory is that indi-
viduals use psychoactive substances to Bself-medicate^
disturbing symptoms (e.g., posttraumatic stress).11–13 The
multi-site Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment
Study14 found that 83 % of patients with chronic pain
and prescription opioid dependence initially used opioids
to treat chronic pain. If patients are self-medicating pain,
then counseling interventions aimed at decreasing

 substance use, focused solely on the negative consequen-
ces of drug use, while not addressing pain symptoms, may
be less effective. This issue has particular importance in
light of the recently published studies that demonstrated
lack of efficacy of brief intervention for unhealthy drug
use in primary care.7,15
The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of
chronic pain and pain-related dysfunction among primary care
patients who screen positive for drug use. In addition, we
examine the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use and
prescription drug misuse for the purpose of self-medicating
chronic pain in this population.
METHODS
Study Design
This is a cross-sectional analysis of subjects enrolled in the
Assessing Screening Plus brief Intervention’s Resulting Effi-
cacy to stop drug use (ASPIRE) study (NCT00876941, see
www.clinicaltrials.gov), a randomized trial assessing the effi-
cacy of brief intervention for subjects who screened positive
for illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse over the prior
3 months, in primary care. This study was approved by the
Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review
Board.
Participants
Study participants were recruited and enrolled from
June 2009 through January 2012, from an urban,
hospital-based primary care practice. Inclusion criteria
were the following: (1) age 18 years or older; (2) arrived
for a visit with a primary care clinician; (3) drug-specific
involvement score ≥ 2 based on self-report responses to
the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screen-
ing Test (ASSIST)16 (a minimum score of 2 means drug
use once or twice in the last 3 months). Exclusion criteria
were the following: (1) inability to provide contact infor-
mation for two persons (to facilitate follow-up); (2) in-
ability to interview and consent in English; (3) unwilling
or unable to participate in follow-up research interviews;
(4) pregnancy (self-report); (5) brief intervention by a
clinical Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to
Treatment (SBIRT) program in past 3 months; (6) partic-
ipation in on-site office-based opioid treatment program.
Assessments
Trained research associates conducted in-person structured
interviews with all participants. They assessed both chronic
pain and pain-related dysfunction using questions derived
from the validated Graded Chronic Pain Scale17,18 (Bin the
past 3 months, on average, how intense was your pain rated
on a 0 to 10 scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is pain as bad as
could be^ and Bin the past 3 months, how much has pain
interfered with your daily activities rated on a 0 to 10 scale,
where 0 is no interference and 10 is unable to carry on any
activities^). They also asked four questions about the use of
substances to treat pain (Bin the past 3 months have you used
any of the following to treat your pain or discomfort - (1)
alcohol, (2) drugs such as marijuana, heroin, cocaine, (3)
prescription drugs without a doctor’s prescription, and (4)
prescription drugs used in greater amounts than prescribed^).
Other assessments and variables for this analysis included
demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, homelessness in
past 3 months, current employment and years of education),
substance use using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C)19 for alcohol with scores rang-
ing from 0-12, with ≥ 3 for women and ≥ 4 for men suggesting
unhealthy alcohol use and ≥ 10 suggesting alcohol depen-
dence, the ASSIST16 for alcohol and drug use risk with
substance-specific scores ranging from 0 to 39, with a higher
score meaning riskier use or greater severity (drug: low-
moderate risk 2–26, high risk ≥ 27; alcohol low risk 0–10,
moderate risk 11–26, high risk ≥ 27), the participant’s main
drug (Bwhich substance used in the past month concerns you
most^), use of more than one drug in the past 3 months, misuse
of prescriptions drugs in the past 3 months, injection drug use
and health status using a 100-point visual analog scale
(EuroQol)20 ranging from Bworst^ to Bbest^ imaginable health
status, depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire (PHQ-9),21 anxiety symptoms using the Overall
Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS),22 health
care utilization (hospital, emergency department/urgent care
visit past 3 months), social support (Bare there people that you
feel you could turn to if you were feeling bad and needed to
talk to about something that was important to you^), and
involvement in an automobile accident in the past 3 months.
Definitions of Chronic Pain and Dysfunction
We defined four distinct categories from both the chronic pain
and the pain interfering with daily activities (dysfunction)
rating scales23: none (0), mild (1–3), moderate (4–6) and
severe (7–10).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were obtained for demographics, sub-
stance use variables, mental and physical health variables,
and health care utilization for the overall sample, and
stratified by chronic pain severity (i.e., no pain, mild,
moderate, or severe pain). Bivariate associations were
assessed using chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, or
ANOVA as appropriate. We estimated the prevalence of
chronic pain, pain-related dysfunction and use of substan-
ces to treat pain along with their corresponding 95 %
confidence intervals. Exact binomial confidence intervals
were used in cases where np(1-p) < 5, where p is the
observed sample proportion. Analyses were performed us-
ing SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics (Table 1)
The cohort included 589 patients at an urban, academic
medical center’s primary care practice who screened pos-
itive for drug use (illicit, prescriptions misuse) by scoring
≥ 2 on the ASSIST screening tool (for the main drug).
During study enrollment (May 2009 – January 2012),
25,302 patients were screened for drug use as part of a
clinical program in primary care, and 2,624 patients
(10 %) were found positive for any drug use in the past
3 months. Of those, 1,018 were found eligible when
research staff were available to enroll subjects for the
original RCT study described by Saitz et al.7 with a total
of 589 patients consented and enrolled; they were 32 %
female, 70 % black, with a mean age of 41 years.
Prevalence of Pain and Pain-Related
Dysfunction (Table 1)
Of the 589 participants, 87 % (95 % CI: 84–90 %) reported
having any chronic pain, with 13 % mild, 24 % moderate and
50 % severe. Those with both high-risk drug use (ASSIST ≥
27) and low- to moderate-risk drug use (ASSIST 2–26) had
similarly high prevalence of severe pain, 45 % and 51 %
respectively. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses sug-
gested that those with severe pain were older, more likely to be
Hispanic ethnicity, less likely to have graduated from high
school, more likely to be currently unemployed, had lower
overall health status, more depressive and anxiety symptoms,
were more likely to have a hospitalization and emergency
department visit in the past 3 months, and were less likely to
have used alcohol in the past year (Table 1). Pain-related
dysfunction was reported by 74 % (95 % CI: 70–78 %) of
participants with 15 % mild, 23 % moderate, and 36 % severe.
Concurrent severe pain and severe dysfunction was found in
32 %.
Prevalence of Using Substances
to Self-Medicate Chronic Pain (Table 2)
Of the 576 participants who reported any marijuana,
cocaine or heroin use in the last 3 months, 51 % (95 % CI:
47–55 %) reported using one or more of these drugs to treat
their pain. Of those that used only one drug, either marijuana
(n=341), cocaine (n=43) or heroin (n=7), 43 % (95 % CI:
38–49 %), 42 % (95 % CI: 27–57 %) and 71 % (95 % CI: 29–
96 %) respectively, did so to treat their pain.
Of the 121 participants who misused prescription drugs
(i.e., opioids, sedatives, stimulants) 81 % (95 % CI: 74–
88 %) misused the drug to treat their pain. Among these
subjects, 69 % (95 % CI: 60–77 %) reported using without a
prescription to treat pain and 32 % (95 % CI: 24–41 %)
reported using more drug than prescribed to treat pain.
Of the 265 participants who reported any heavy drinking in
the past 3 months, 38 % (95 % CI: 32–44 %) did so to treat
pain, compared to 79 % (95 % CI: 68–90 %) of the 57
participants who were considered to be high-risk drinkers
(ASSIST ≥ 27) Among the 371 participants with unhealthy
alcohol use in the past year (AUDIT-C score ≥ 3 for women
and ≥ 4 for men), 35 % (95 % CI: 30–40 %) did so to treat
pain, compared to 61 % (95 % CI: 52–70 %) of the 114 with
likely alcohol dependence (AUDIT-C ≥ 10).
DISCUSSION
While approximately one-third of the U.S. population24 and
one-fifth of patients seeking primary care have chronic pain,25
87 % of our cohort of primary care patients who screened
positive for drug use reported chronic pain. Almost half of
these patients reported severe pain and approximately one-
third reported both severe pain and severe pain-related dys-
function. Persons with addiction and pain have a Bsyndrome of
pain facilitation,^ where pain is worsened by withdrawal-
related sympathetic nervous system arousal, sleep disturban-
ces, and affective changes.26 While previous studies have
shown that up to 60 % of patients with drug use disorders
have chronic pain,3,4 our cohort found that patients with lower
risk drug use (ASSIST < 27) had similar levels of pain as those
with higher risk drug use (ASSIST ≥ 27).
Characteristics associated with more severe pain included
less education and higher unemployment, more non-primary
care-based healthcare utilization (emergency department/
urgent care visits, hospitalizations), older age, Hispanic eth-
nicity, lower overall health status and more symptoms of
depression and anxiety and a lower proportion reporting any
past year alcohol use. The associations between chronic pain
and older age,27 depression and anxiety28 and increased
healthcare utilization29 have been well described. While the
association between pain and unemployment, less education
and race is not clear,30 these characteristics are associated with
lower socioeconomic status, which has been associated with
increased prevalence and severity of chronic pain.31 While our
study found a higher prevalence of chronic pain in Hispanic
participants, this is counter to a large U.S. epidemiologic study
that found significantly less chronic pain in Hispanics com-
pared to Non-Hispanics.27 However, Hispanics are at higher
risk for painful conditions given their lower overall socioeco-
nomic status and higher rates of obesity.1 Hispanics of Puerto
Rican decent have been shown to have higher rates of chronic
back and neck pain.32
Individuals use substances for many reasons, including peer
pressure, sensation seeking and self-medication of medical
and psychiatric symptoms.33 In this study, it was common
for patients to attribute their substance use to treating symp-
toms of pain. Over half of the cohort using illicit drugs, two-
thirds misusing prescription drugs without a prescription, and
one-third using their prescription in greater amounts than

 prescribed, reported doing so to treat pain. Among those with
any recent heavy alcohol use, over one-third drank to treat
their pain, compared to over three-quarters of those who met
the criteria for current high-risk alcohol use. Using substances
to self-medicate psychiatric symptoms has been described for
decades. In addition, the association between substance use
and chronic pain has been well described.34,35 Appreciating
this association has important implications when addressing
both the patient’s substance use as well as their pain. Stud-
ies35,36 have found that chronic pain was independently asso-
ciated with relapse to substance use after detoxification, but
not associated with worse office-based buprenorphine
treatment outcomes.37 If drugs are being used to self-
medicate pain, patients may be reluctant to decrease, stop or
remain abstinent if their pain symptoms are not adequately
managed. This issue of self-medicating pain is particularly
relevant with the recent studies showing lack of efficacy of
brief interventions to decrease drug use in primary care.38
Brief interventions, especially those performed by allied
health staff, often focus on the association between substance
use and negative health and life consequences39; they often do
not address alternative approaches to treating symptoms such
as chronic pain. Addressing pain symptoms is complicated for
the most experienced physician and is outside the skill set of

 most allied health staff performing brief intervention counsel-
ing. Brief interventions focusing solely on the harmful effects
of an illicit or misused drug may be ignored or disregarded if
the patient perceives the drug as necessary to treat a symptom.
This study has some important limitations. Since the cohort
includes only patients at an urban, hospital-based primary care
practice who screened positive for drug use in the past
3 months and were enrolled in a clinical trial, it may not be
generalizable to the larger population of people who use drugs.
This limitation in external validity likely applies more to the
prevalence of drug use than it would apply to the prevalence of
pain among those using drugs; we have no hypothesis about
why that prevalence would differ in other populations. Fur-
thermore, we included a wide spectrum of drug use, ranging
from one day’s use in the last 3 months to multiple uses every
day, including use of marijuana, cocaine, heroin and misuse of
prescription drugs, and spanning the ASSIST risk scores from
2 (low risk of problems) to 27 or greater (likely to be substance
use disorder). This gives the study the broadest applicability to
all levels of drug use severity. As with any cross-sectional
analysis, we analyzed data from one point in time and thus
cannot assume causality; the purpose of the study was to
describe prevalences of interest. Lastly, this was a secondary
analysis and not the primary focus of the original study, and as
such, pain data were collected using unidimensional numeric
rating scales derived from the Graded Chronic Pain Scale.17
Had this been the primary question of the original study, we
would have chosen a more comprehensive, multidimensional
pain and functional assessment that would have further char-
acterized pain symptoms. We believe that future studies
should examine in greater detail, with prospective vision, the
relationships that were observed in our findings.
The high prevalence of chronic pain in patients who screen
positive for drug use in primary care highlights the importance
of assessing and managing chronic pain in this population.
While there are many reasons why individuals use psychoac-
tive substances, our finding of substance use in primary care
patients to self-medicate pain has important implications for
how brief counseling interventions are performed. To maxi-
mize the benefits of brief interventions in such patients, it is
prudent to address the patient’s substance use and pain com-
plaints concurrently. There is growing evidence that comanag-
ing pain and opioid use disorders with behavioral treatments
can be effective.40 It is in unclear if comanagement will
improve the efficacy of brief counseling interventions for
nontreatment-seeking patients, identified by universal screen-
ing in general healthcare settings, the majority of whom will
have unhealthy substance use that does not meet criteria for a
use disorder.41 However, it seems unlikely that individuals
using substances to self-medicate pain, even if they have
additional reasons for such use, will discontinue substance
use if their pain symptoms are not adequately addressed with
alternative approaches.
