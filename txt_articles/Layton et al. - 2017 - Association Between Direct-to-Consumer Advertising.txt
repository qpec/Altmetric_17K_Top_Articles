Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Testosterone initiation increased substantially in the United States from 2000 to 
2013, especially among men without clear indications. Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) 
also increased during this time.
OBJECTIVE—To investigate associations between televised DTCA and testosterone testing and 
initiation in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION—Ecologic study conducted in designated market 
areas (DMAs) in the United States. Monthly testosterone advertising ratings were linked to DMA-

 level testosterone use data from 2009–2013 derived from commercial insurance claims. 
Associations between DTCA and testosterone testing, initiation, and initiation without recent 
baseline tests were estimated using Poisson generalized estimating equations.
EXPOSURES—Monthly Nielsen ratings for testosterone DTCA in the 75 largest DMAs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—(1) Rates of new serum testosterone testing; (2) rates 
of testosterone initiation (in-office injection, surgical implant, or pharmacy dispensing) for all 
testosterone products combined and for specific brands; and (3) rates of testosterone initiation 
without recent serum testosterone testing.
RESULTS—Of 17 228 599 commercially insured men in the 75 DMAs, 1 007 990 (mean age, 
49.6 [SD, 11.5] years) had new serum testosterone tests and 283 317 (mean age, 51.8 [SD, 11.3] 
years) initiated testosterone treatment. Advertising intensity varied by geographic region and time, 
with the highest intensity seen in the southeastern United States and with months ranging from no 
ad exposures to a mean of 13.6 exposures per household. Nonbranded advertisements were 
common prior to 2012, with branded advertisements becoming more common during and after 
2012. Each household advertisement exposure was associated with a monthly increase in rates of 
new testosterone testing (rate ratio [RR], 1.006; 95% CI, 1.004–1.008), initiation (RR, 1.007; 95% 
CI, 1.004–1.010), and initiation without a recent test (RR, 1.008; 95% CI, 1.002–1.013). Mean 
absolute rate increases were 0.14 tests (95% CI, 0.09–0.19), 0.05 new initiations (95% CI, 0.03–
0.08), and 0.02 initiations without a recent test (95% CI, 0.01–0.03) per 10 000 men for each 
monthly ad exposure over the entire period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among US men residing in the 75 designated market 
areas, regional exposure to televised direct-to-consumer advertising was associated with greater 
testosterone testing, new initiation, and initiation without recent testing.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted televised direct-to-consumer 
advertising (DTCA) for prescription medications in 1997. An argument for DTCA is that it 
may steer consumers to beneficial treatments for high-priority illnesses,1 but it may also 
contribute to escalating drug prices and reduced patient safety.2 A growing evidence base 
illustrates strong associations between televised DTCA and increased product prescribing 
for a variety of indications,3–5 and the American Medical Association called for a ban on 
such marketing in 2015, attempting to reduce prescription costs and curb consumer demand 
for new, expensive, and potentially inappropriate treatments.6
Increased awareness of and demand for a medication may be beneficial if the risk-benefit 
ratio of the drug is favorable. For many men taking testosterone, that assumption is 
questionable. Testosterone therapies were originally approved to treat hypogonadism 
resulting from the disruption of the pituitary-hypothalamus-gonadal axis. Now many men 
take or are prescribed testosterone for age-related reduced testosterone levels or nonspecific 
symptoms without pathological hypogonadism. Despite considerable disagreement about the 
necessity and safety of treatment for these findings and symptoms, testosterone prescribing 
has increased substantially in the absence of proven new indications,7–9 particularly in the 
United States, where the testosterone initiation rate rose from 20.2 to 75.7 per 10000 person-
years from 2000 to 2011.8

 Although studies have yielded conflicting information on the risks and benefits of 
testosterone,10–13 termination of a clinical trial because of excess adverse cardiovascular 
effects14 and observational studies suggesting increased cardiovascular risk11,15 led the FDA 
to reevaluate the risks and revise product labeling requirements in 2014, and pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, who had previously heavily marketed testosterone products through televised 
branded, product-specific promotions and unbranded, “low T” awareness advertisements, 
voluntarily discontinued televised DTCA for testosterone products.
Given the controversies surrounding DTCA and testosterone, we examined the association 
between exposure to DTCA for testosterone and testosterone testing, initiation, and initiation 
without a preceding testosterone test.
Methods
This project was approved by the institutional review board of the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Individual consent was not required for this analysis of deidentified 
data.
Data Sources
Direct-to-Consumer Advertising—We licensed monthly television ratings data from 
Nielsen Media Research for televised testosterone advertisements in the largest 75 of 210 
US designated market areas (DMAs), which are whole, adjoining counties centered around 
large cities whose populations receive similar television programming. We collected ratings 
between 2008 and 2013 for both brand-specific prescription testosterone advertisements, 
which are regulated by the FDA, and nonbranded, condition awareness (“low T”) ads, which 
are not FDA regulated; we measured DTCA using gross ratings points, a standard metric for 
quantifying advertising exposure reflecting the percentage of the target audience reached 
multiplied by frequency of exposures as measured by a combination of electronic metering 
and surveying across broadcast platforms.16,17 We summed gross ratings points within the 
same DMA and month for all testosterone advertisements and for branded testosterone 
advertisements and condition awareness ads separately, and divided by 100 to obtain the 
mean number of times testosterone advertisements were viewed in television households in a 
given month; an ad with 100 gross ratings points per month can be interpreted as being seen 
1 time per month by 100% of the audience, and each 1-unit increase in monthly exposures 
represented approximately 1 additional viewing of a television ad per household.16,18
Key Points

 testing of 0.6%, new initiation of 0.7%, and initiation without a recent baseline test of 
0.8%.
Meaning
Regional exposure to televised direct-to-consumer advertising was associated with 
greater testosterone testing, new initiation, and initiation without recent serum 
testosterone tests.
Testosterone Testing and Initiation—We used the MarketScan Commercial Claims 
and Encounters databases (Truven Health Analytics) to quantify population level 
testosterone testing and initiation (in-office injection, surgical implant, or pharmacy 
dispensing) within DMAs. The MarketScan databases include individual-level clinical 
diagnoses, procedures, outpatient prescription dispensing (including from retail, mail-order, 
and specialty pharmacies), expenditures, and enrollment data paid for by employer 
sponsored, fee-for-service, fully capitated or partially capitated plans. Claims from 
employees and their dependents and those with employer-based Medicare supplemental 
plans also are included. Claims are fully paid and adjudicated, and the research databases are 
constructed after sufficient time has elapsed to allow for submission, payment, and recording 
of all outstanding claims. Considerable standardization and quality control activities occur 
during database construction.19
We identified men aged 18 years or older residing within defined metropolitan statistical 
areas (MSAs); 1 or more MSAs make up a DMA. Geographic information was not available 
for those residing outside MSAs or in smaller micropolitan statistical areas, so our sample 
focused on those in more urban population centers. Using procedure codes from submitted 
insurance claims, we identified men newly tested for serum testosterone levels following 6 
months without testosterone receipt or testing. Initiation of testosterone gels, patches, 
injections, or implants was defined as pharmacy dispensing or in-office receipt identified 
through procedure codes of testosterone following 6 months without prior testosterone 
receipt. Our main analysis identified initiators of all testosterone products, while subanalyses 
focused on initiators of individual advertised, branded products (AndroGel [Abbvie Inc] and 
Axiron [Eli Lilly Inc]). The denominator for monthly rate calculations was the number of 
adult men enrolled in the MarketScan databases within each MSA on the 15th of each month 
with at least 6 months of prior continuous enrollment.
We collapsed MSA-level information into DMA levels and linked the data with advertising 
information.
DMA Characteristics—We collected county-level characteristics and aggregated them 
into DMAs to account for differences in population demographics, access to health care 
(measured by physician density), and socioeconomic status (median income). We derived 
county-level 5-year estimates of age and race/ethnicity distributions from the 2009–2013 
American Community Survey, an ongoing yearly survey of US households conducted by the 
US Census Bureau; race/ethnicity designation was self-reported by choosing from fixed, 
standard categories. We derived annual estimates of county-level physician density and

 median income from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Area Resource 
File.
Statistical Analysis
We examined the overall pattern of testosterone testing and initiation between 2009 and 
2013. We estimated monthly rates of testing and initiation per 10000 menin each DMA and 
plotted national mean rates with their interquartile ranges. We assessed geographic variation 
by summing all advertising exposures throughout the study period within DMAs and divided 
these cumulative measures into 7 approximately equal strata using an equal-distribution 
(quantizing) algorithm to visualize regional variation in total DTCA; these DTCA levels 
were mapped across the United States by year to observe changes in geographic variation 
over time.
We describe the association between DTCA and testosterone testing and initiation using 
adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals derived from multivariable Poisson 
models with generalized estimating equations20 to account for clustering within DMAs over 
time; we used an autoregressive (AR-1) correlation structure. Direct-to-consumer advertising 
exposures were included as a continuous variable; thus, the resulting RRs indicate the 
association between a 1-unit increase in ad exposures and testosterone rates. Monthly 
advertising data (November 2008 to October 2013) were linked to monthly testosterone data 
2 months in the future, allowing for the passage of time between viewing an ad, seeking 
care, and receiving treatment. To observe the effect of varied lag times, we performed a 
preplanned sensitivity analyses evaluating a 1-month lag and a post hoc analysis of a 3-
month lag.
We adjusted the models for age (proportion of population in age groups of 35–44, 45–54, 
55–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years, included in model as 5 variables), race (proportion of white 
and black population, included in model as 2 variables), physician density, socioeconomic 
status (included in model as a quadratic trend of median income because increases in income 
may be more meaningful for medication use at lower income values), seasonality (modeled 
with 4 variables, 1 for each season, each taking a 0 or 1 value), and overall increasing usage 
time trend8 to facilitate estimation of the increases in testosterone testing and initiation 
within a DMA not due to expected seasonal variation or overall national trends. We modeled 
time trends with cubic splines to allow for flexibility at nodes corresponding to key events: 
FDA warning of testosterone gel transfer from men to women and children21 (May 2009); 
release and approval of new testosterone gel formulations22,23 (April 2011); and National 
Institutes of Health funding of observational studies of the cardiovascular safety of 
testosterone products24 (August 2012).
Our primary exposure variable was total monthly testosterone advertising exposures, but we 
additionally investigated individual branded advertisements and unbranded condition 
awareness advertisements from 2012 to 2013; prior to 2012, there were primarily only 
unbranded “low T” condition awareness advertisements. We estimated the association of 
advertising with(1) new serum testosterone tests; (2) all new testosterone initiations, 
including branded and unbranded patch, gel, injection, and implanted formulations; (3) 
initiation without a recent test; and(4) product-specific initiation of branded testosterone

 gels. Model-based predicted rates were plotted against observed testosterone rates to 
evaluate model fit. As post hoc sensitivity analyses we investigated the associations in each 
year alone because there was substantial variation in advertising intensity by year and more 
diverse advertising, greater competition, and plateaued overall use during later years, and we 
explored nonlinear relationships by modeling DTCA with both a linear and a quadratic term.
We compared RR estimates from different periods and sensitivity analyses using ratios of 
RRs.25 We considered a 2-sided threshold of P<.05 to be statistically significant. All 
analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Of 17 228 599 unique men across the 75 DMAs (mean age, 42.8 [SD, 16.0] years), 1 007 
990 (mean age, 49.6 [SD, 11.5] years) had new serum testosterone tests and 283 317 (mean 
age, 51.8 [SD, 11.3] years) initiated testosterone treatment during the study period (59% 
initiated testosterone gels, 36% injections, 3% patches, and 2% implants). Baseline DMA 
characteristics (Table 1)and testosterone use varied widely, with DMA level testing rates 
ranging from 2.7 (95% CI, 0.7–7.3) to 30.5 (95% CI, 26.0–35.7) per 10000 men and 
initiation rates ranging from 0.6 (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) to 23.2 (95% CI, 5.9–63.0) per 10000 
men (Table 1; see eTable 1 in the Supplement for DMA-level characteristics by year).
Descriptive Trends of Testosterone Testing and Initiation
Monthly testosterone testing and initiation increased between 2009 and 2012 prior to 
decreasing through 2013 (Figure 1, A and B); initiation without a recent baseline test 
decreased slightly but consistently over the period. After introduction of Axiron in 2011, 
Androgel initiation rates increased and then decreased in 2012–2013 (Figure 1C). Mean 
monthly rates per 10000 men were 24.6 (SD, 9.5) for testosterone testing, 7.6 (SD, 3.8) for 
testosterone initiation, and 2.4 (SD, 1.5) for testosterone initiation without prior testing.
Descriptive Trends of Testosterone DTCA
Direct-to-consumer advertising exposure increased over the period with substantial 
variation, ranging from months without any advertising to a mean 13.6 (SD, 0.8) monthly 
household exposures in December 2012 (Figure 2A). Prior to 2012, Abbvie-funded, 
unbranded “low T” advertisements were the primary form of advertising. Following the 
introduction of Axiron and a more concentrated Androgel formulation in 2011, more 
branded, product-specific advertising emerged and unbranded condition awareness 
advertisements decreased (Figure 2B).
Television advertising intensity varied by DMA region, with cumulative exposures ranging 
from 154.9 to 203.5 advertisement exposures per DMA over the study period (mean, 179.1; 
SD, 10.0). The most concentrated advertising occurred in the Southeast and the southern 
Great Lakes regions (Figure 3), a geographic focus consistent through most of the study 
period (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

 Association of DTCA and Testosterone Testing and Initiation
Increases in advertisement exposure were associated with higher rates of testosterone 
testing, initiation, and initiation without testing (Table 2), except Axiron initiation, which 
was introduced later in the period and had lower overall use (Table 2; see eTable 2 and 
eFigure 2 in the Supplement for model goodness-of-fit estimates). Each additional ad 
exposure was associated with a relative 0.6%(95% CI, 0.4%–0.8%) increase in testing, 
0.7%(95% CI, 0.4%–0.10%) increase in initiation, and 0.8%(95% CI, 0.2%–0.13%) increase 
in initiation of testosterone without baseline testing, corresponding to absolute monthly 
increases of 0.14 new tests (95% CI, 0.09–0.19), 0.05 initiations (95% CI, 0.03–0.08), and 
0.02 initiations without baseline testing (95% CI, 0.01–0.03) per 10 000 men across the 
study period.
Prior to 2012, advertising—almost all of which was unbranded “low T” advertising—was 
associated with testosterone testing (RR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.009–1.014) and initiation (RR, 
1.012; 95% CI, 1.007–1.017); after 2012, the advertising was primarily branded, but 
associations with testing (RR, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.995–1.001) or initiation (RR, 0.998; 95% 
CI, 0.994–1.003)were no longer statistically significant (ratios of RRs in 2012–2013 vs 
2009–2011, 0.986 [95% CI, 0.982–0.990]; P < .001 for testing and 0.986 [95% CI, 0.980–
0.993]; P < .001 for initiation, suggesting a statistically significant difference in association 
between the periods). Androgel was the most widely used branded product during the entire 
study period and the most widely advertised branded product after 2012; its advertising was 
associated with increased rates of testing and initiation across all domains (Table 2). 
However, other advertising types showed a more attenuated or no association in 2012 and 
2013.
When exploring nonlinear relationships between DTCA and testosterone by modeling with a 
quadratic term, we observed a “saturation effect” wherein the association between a 1-unit 
increase in DTCA exposure and testosterone became weaker at higher levels of DTCA 
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). For example, when a DMA’s monthly exposure increased 
from 1 to 2, the association between the increase in DTCA with new testing was an RR of 
1.015 (95% CI, 1.012–1.019); from 5 to 6, an RR of 1.012 (95% CI, 1.009–1.014); and from 
10 to 11, an RR of 1.007 (95% CI, 1.005–1.009).
There were no statistically significant associations between DTCA and testosterone testing 
and initiation in sensitivity analyses testing 1- and 3-month lag periods (eTable 5 in the 
Supplement).
Discussion
Increasing televised DTCA for testosterone therapies was observed across US metropolitan 
areas between 2009 and 2013, and both branded and condition awareness ads were 
associated with increased testosterone testing and initiation. Although the average increase 
in testosterone rates associated with a single ad exposure was less than 1%, advertisements 
were widespread and frequent during the study period; with cumulative ad exposures of 
close to 200 in some DMAs, DTCA was associated with substantial overall increases in 
testosterone testing and initiation.

 These associations were strongest when only a single brand was being advertised, and there 
may have been a saturation effect, as DTCA was more prevalent during 2012 and 2013 than 
earlier periods, yet with increasing safety concerns, introduction of new formulations, and 
competing advertising campaigns, testosterone use decreased somewhat and the associations 
of DTCA with testing or initiation became attenuated (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the 
Supplement). Additionally, DTCA was associated with more initiation of test osterone 
without recent serum testing, contrary to treatment guidelines.26
These findings illustrate the association between mass marketing efforts and demand for a 
prescription drug in a context in which it has been widely overused.7,8 Ultimately, 
prescribing decisions rest with physicians, but patient preferences and requests for specific 
medications influence prescribing decisions,27–29 and DTCA may be associated with 
increased patient demand. While other studies have demonstrated associations between 
DTCA and increasing medication use, this study demonstrates increases in potentially 
inappropriate use and increasing initiation during a time when most testosterone use was of 
questionable value for age-related testosterone decreases without strong evidence of benefit. 
Characterizing the role of DTCA in promoting testosterone initiation among a large segment 
of middle-aged and older men for nonspecific symptoms and age-related declines in 
testosterone levels is relevant to ongoing policy debates regarding DTCA. This study 
complements many others that suggest the contribution that DTCA may make in the early 
adoption of recently approved treatments whose risk-benefit profile may be quite unclear.2
Furthermore, concerns remain regarding the safety and benefit of using testosterone to treat 
age-related declines in testosterone levels. Original FDA approval of testosterone 
formulations was based on trials demonstrating increased testosterone blood levels among 
men with specific disorders of the testes or pituitary, not amelioration of any clinical 
symptoms.30 A recent study on the benefits of raising testosterone levels among older men 
with low testosterone but without pathological hypogonadism found moderate improvements 
in sexual function and mood but no benefit in vitality or walking distance31; this may 
reignite the cost-benefit discussion, yet the trials were too small to evaluate safety, and they 
offer little support for widespread use of testosterone outside the narrow approved 
indications. Although the current study lacks individual-level information on patients’ 
indications for treatment, much of the increase in testosterone use in the United States has 
been among men being treated for age related decreases in testosterone or nonspecific 
symptoms.8
This study has limitations. As an ecologic study, it lacks information on individual-level 
DTCA exposures. Some individuals residing near DMA boundaries may view televised ads 
outside their assigned DMA. For pharmacy-dispensed products, the study assessed receipt 
from the pharmacy, not actual use by patients. Although there were no explicitly missing 
data from any data source, the findings may under estimate true testosterone testing and 
initiation if tests or prescriptions were not submitted to insurers for reimbursement. 
Additionally, the Market Scan data bases contain information only on those with employer-
sponsored health insurance in the United States; these results may not be generalizable to 
men covered by public insurance plans or uninsured men. This analysis was limited to 
investigating geographic variation in televised pharmaceutical advertising; there may be

 additional forms of influential promotion, such as physician-targeted promotion, internet 
advertising (including branded ads and unbranded disease awareness symptom quizzes), or 
advertisements by men’s health specialty clinics, thus potentially over attributing some 
testosterone use to televised DTCA. While televised DTCA is the most common and 
influential type of direct-to-consumer advertising medium,32,33 internet advertising was also 
widespread throughout most of the study period, although it likely lacks the geographic 
variation of televised DTCA. However, televised DTCA was consistently associated with 
multiple dimensions of testosterone use. Finally, the statistically significant associations 
between DTCA and testosterone testing and initiation we report at 2 months were not 
apparent in sensitivity analyses testing of 1- and 3-month lag periods; the reasons for the 
dependence of the association on the 2-month lag period are not knowable from our data.
Conclusions
Among US men residing in 75 US DMAs, regional exposure to televised DTCA was 
associated with greater testosterone testing, new initiation, and initiation without recent 
testing.

Geographic Distribution of Cumulative Testosterone Advertisement Exposures From 
Nielsen Television Ratings (Total Summed Ratings, November 2008–October 2013) in the 
75 Largest US DMAs
Monthly advertisement exposures were summed across the entire study period within 
designated market areas (DMAs), and DMAs were stratified into 7 strata of cumulative 
advertising exposures containing approximately equal numbers of DMAs. The borders 
between exposure strata were defined empirically; thus, there are gaps between strata where 
no DMA had measures in that range.

aSource: Truven Health Analytics MarketScan databases, Nielsen television ratings, 2009–2013. The rate ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% 
CI) of mean rates was derived from rate ratio estimates from Poisson generalized estimating equation regression adjusting for income, race/
ethnicity, age, physician density, overall time trend, and seasonality. Testosterone ad exposures was included as a continuous variable, and the rate 
ratios estimate the association between a 1-unit increase in ad exposure and the testosterone rate; for example, across the entire study period, 1 
exposure to a testosterone advertisement was associated with a 0.7% higher subsequent initiation rate (rate ratio, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.004–1.010),

corresponding to a mean absolute increase of 0.05 initiations (95% CI, 0.03–0.07) per 10 000 men per ad. However, the mean number of ad 
exposures per month was 2.9 (SD, 2.8), which was associated with a 2.0% higher subsequent initiation rate (rate ratio, 1.020; 95% CI, 1.011–1.029) 
and a mean absolute increase of 0.15 initiations (95% CI, 0.09–0.22) per 10 000 men.
