BACKGROUND
Combination therapy with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib plus the MEK inhibitor 
trametinib improved survival in patients with advanced melanoma with BRAF V600 
mutations. We sought to determine whether adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib 
would improve outcomes in patients with resected, stage III melanoma with BRAF 
V600 mutations.
METHODS
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 870 
patients with completely resected, stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K 
mutations to receive oral dabrafenib at a dose of 150 mg twice daily plus trametinib at 
a dose of 2 mg once daily (combination therapy, 438 patients) or two matched placebo 
tablets (432 patients) for 12 months. The primary end point was relapse-free survival. 
Secondary end points included overall survival, distant metastasis–free survival, 
freedom from relapse, and safety.
RESULTS
At a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the estimated 3-year rate of relapse-free survival 
was 58% in the combination-therapy group and 39% in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio for relapse or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.58; P<0.001). 
The 3-year overall survival rate was 86% in the combination-therapy group and 77% 
in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.79; P 
= 
0.0006), 
but this level of improvement did not cross the prespecified interim analysis boundary 
of P=0.000019. Rates of distant metastasis–free survival and freedom from relapse 
were also higher in the combination-therapy group than in the placebo group. The 
safety profile of dabrafenib plus trametinib was consistent with that observed with 
the combination in patients with metastatic melanoma.
CONCLUSIONS
Adjuvant use of combination therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib resulted in a 
significantly lower risk of recurrence in patients with stage III melanoma with BRAF 
V600E or V600K mutations than the adjuvant use of placebo and was not associated 
with new toxic effects. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis; COMBI-AD

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he incidence of cutaneous mela-
noma has continued to increase in recent 
years.1 For early-stage melanoma, surgical 
resection is the standard treatment and is associ-
ated with an excellent long-term prognosis, with 
5-year survival rates of 98% for stage I disease 
and 90% for stage II disease.1,2 However, patients 
with stage III disease, who have regional involve-
ment at diagnosis, are at higher risk for recur-
rence after locoregional resection, and many will 
ultimately die from metastatic melanoma.1,3-5
Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, includ-
ing those that target programmed death 1 (PD-1) 
or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), 
and drugs that target the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (BRAF and MEK 
inhibitors and combinations of these drugs) have 
improved the outcome of patients with metastatic 
melanoma,6 but their role as adjuvant therapy is 
still an area of active investigation.1 Systemic 
adjuvant therapies that have been approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration for the treat-
ment of melanoma include interferon alfa-2b and 
pegylated interferon, which have shown incon-
sistent improvements in overall survival along 
with substantial toxic effects,7-9 and the CTLA-4 
inhibitor ipilimumab.10 The use of adjuvant ipili-
mumab has resulted in a significantly higher rate 
of 5-year survival than placebo (65.4% vs. 54.4%; 
hazard ratio, 0.72), although ipilimumab has 
been associated with serious adverse events that 
have led to early treatment discontinuation in a 
substantial proportion of patients and with death 
in 1.1% of patients.10
Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are found in 
approximately 40% of melanomas and result in 
constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway.11,12 
In two independent phase 3 trials (COMBI-d and 
COMBI-v),13,14 treatment with the BRAF inhibitor 
dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus the MEK 
inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily) improved 
overall survival in patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K 
mutations.
Given the need for safe and effective adjuvant 
therapies, we sought to determine whether the 
combination of dabrafenib and trametinib would 
improve relapse-free survival, overall survival, 
distant metastasis–free survival, and freedom 
from relapse in patients with stage III melanoma 
with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations after com-
plete surgical resection. Here, we report the 
primary analysis from COMBI-AD, a randomized 
trial evaluating combination BRAF and MEK 
inhibition as adjuvant therapy in melanoma.
Methods
Patients
From January 2013 through December 2014, we 
enrolled patients at 169 sites in 26 countries. 
Eligible adult patients (≥18 years of age) had 
undergone complete resection of histologically 
confirmed stage IIIA (limited to lymph-node 
metastasis of >1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC cutaneous 
melanoma (according to the criteria of the Ameri-
can Joint Committee on Cancer, seventh edition15) 
with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. None of 
the patients had undergone previous systemic 
anticancer treatment or radiotherapy for mela-
noma. All the patients had undergone comple-
tion lymphadenectomy with no clinical or radio-
graphic evidence of residual regional node disease 
within 12 weeks before randomization, had re-
covered from definitive surgery, and had an East-
ern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher 
scores indicating greater disability). BRAF V600 
mutation status was confirmed in primary-tumor 
or lymph-node tissue by a central reference labo-
ratory. All the patients provided written in-
formed consent. Additional details are provided 
in the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this arti-
cle at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatments
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-
blind, phase 3 trial, patients were assigned to 
receive oral dabrafenib at a dose of 150 mg twice 
daily plus trametinib at a dose of 2 mg once 
daily (combination therapy) or two matched pla-
cebo tablets. Patients were stratified according 
to their BRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) 
and disease stage (IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC). Patients 
were treated for 12 months in the absence of 
disease recurrence, unacceptable toxic effects, 
withdrawal of consent, or death. Follow-up for 
disease recurrence continued until the first re-
currence was observed, and thereafter patients 
were followed for survival. Dose modifications 
or interruptions were used for nonhematologic 
adverse events of grade 2 or higher that could 
not be managed with routine supportive care.

Dabrafenib plus Trametinib in BRAF-Mutated Melanoma
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary end point was relapse-free survival, 
defined as the time from randomization to dis-
ease recurrence or death from any cause. Second-
ary end points included overall survival, distant 
metastasis–free survival (defined as the time 
from randomization to the date of first distant 
metastasis or date of death, whichever occurred 
first), freedom from relapse (defined as the time 
from randomization to recurrence, with censoring 
of data for patients who had died from causes 
other than melanoma or treatment-related toxic 
effects), and safety. All disease-recurrence analy-
ses were based on investigator assessment. Effi-
cacy analyses included all the patients who had 
undergone randomization (intention-to-treat pop-
ulation), and safety analyses included all the 
patients who had received at least one dose of a 
trial drug (safety population).
Assessments
Disease assessments included clinical examina-
tion and imaging by means of computed tomog-
raphy, magnetic resonance imaging, or both. 
(Additional details are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.) Imaging was performed every 
3 months during the first 24 months, then every 
6 months until disease recurrence or the comple-
tion of the trial. Follow-up for survival began 
after recurrence and continued through the end 
of the trial.
Adverse events and laboratory values were as-
sessed at screening, on the date of randomiza-
tion, at least once per month through month 12, 
and at every visit for disease-recurrence assess-
ment after month 12. Adverse events and labora-
tory values were graded according to the Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 4.0.
Trial Oversight
The trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline; 
dabrafenib and trametinib were designated as 
assets of Novartis on March 2, 2015, after which 
Novartis took over sponsorship of the trial. The 
trial was conducted in accordance with the pro-
visions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol (avail-
able at NEJM.org) was approved by the institu-
tional review board at each trial center. The trial 
design was developed jointly by GlaxoSmithKline 
and the academic authors. Data were collected 
by investigators at individual study sites and were 
subsequently transferred to and analyzed by the 
sponsor (GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis after 
March 2, 2015). All the authors developed the 
initial draft of the manuscript and made the deci-
sion to submit it for publication; all the authors 
contributed to subsequent drafts. The authors 
affirm the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and adherence of the trial to the protocol. Edi-
torial support was provided by ArticulateScience 
and was funded by Novartis.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that the enrollment of 870 pa-
tients would result in relapse-free survival in 
approximately 410 patients by the analysis cutoff 
date (with a two-sided type I error rate of 5%) 
and would provide a power of more than 90% to 
detect a hazard ratio of 0.71 (corresponding to a 
median relapse-free survival of 21 months in the 
combination-therapy group and 15 months in the 
placebo group). No interim analysis was per-
formed for efficacy or futility for the primary 
end point. Overall survival, as the key secondary 
end point, was to be tested in a hierarchical man-
ner only if the primary end point met the criteria 
for significance. The overall survival analysis 
used a preplanned three-look Lan–DeMets group 
sequential design with an O’Brien–Fleming–type 
boundary, which was used to determine the sig-
nificance threshold for the first interim overall 
survival analysis (two-sided P 
= 
0.000019).
We used the Kaplan–Meier method to esti-
mate relapse-free survival, overall survival, distant 
metastasis–free survival, and freedom from re-
lapse and a stratified log-rank test to compare the 
two trial groups. Hazard ratios with 95% confi-
dence intervals for all time-to-event end points 
were calculated with the use of the Pike estima-
tor.16,17 All P values are two-sided. The trial was 
not powered to detect differences in outcomes on 
the basis of the type of BRAF mutation.
Results
Patients and Treatment
A total of 870 patients underwent randomization, 
with 438 patients assigned to receive combina-
tion therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib and 
432 patients to receive matched placebo tablets 
for 12 months. The baseline characteristics of the 
patients were similar in the two groups (Table 1).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Among the enrolled patients, 154 (18%) had 
stage IIIA disease, 356 (41%) had stage IIIB dis-
ease, and 347 (40%) had stage IIIC disease; 13 
(1%) had stage III unspecified disease. Of the 
870 patients, 792 (91%) had a BRAF V600E muta-
tion, and 78 (9%) had a BRAF V600K mutation.
As of the data cutoff date for the primary 
analysis (June 30, 2017), the minimum follow-up 
time was 2.5 years (median, 2.8 years). The last 
dose of a trial drug was administered in Decem-
ber 2015, and all the patients had completed the 
trial treatment at the time of this analysis (Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Follow-up 
was still occurring in 331 patients (76%) in the 
combination-therapy group and in 277 patients 
(64%) in the placebo group; 47 patients (11%) 
and 62 (14%) patients, respectively, had with-
drawn from the trial, and the remaining pa-
tients had died (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). All scheduled doses of dabrafenib 
were completed by 272 of 435 patients (63%), all 
scheduled doses of trametinib by 277 of 435 
(64%), and all scheduled doses of placebo by 227 
of 432 (53%); the most common reason for pre-
mature discontinuation was the occurrence of 
adverse events in the combination-therapy group 
(108 patients [25%] for dabrafenib and 104 pa-
tients [24%] for trametinib) and disease recur-
rence in the placebo group (175 patients [41%]). 
Systemic therapy after recurrence was adminis-
tered in 28% of the patients in the combination-
therapy group and in 42% of those in the placebo 
group (Table 2). The most common systemic 
therapies after recurrence were small-molecule 
targeted therapy (in 14% of the patients in the 
combination-therapy group and in 32% of those 
in the placebo group), immunotherapy against 
PD-1 or programmed death ligand 1 (in 16% in 
each group), and anti–CTLA-4 immunotherapy 
(in 12% and 16%, respectively).
Efficacy
As of the data cutoff, disease recurrence had been 
reported in 163 of 438 patients (37%) in the 
combination-therapy group and in 247 of 432 
patients (57%) in the placebo group. Investigator-
assessed relapse-free survival (primary end point) 
was significantly longer in the combination-
therapy group than in the placebo group, repre-
senting a 53% lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio

for relapse or death, 0.47; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.39 to 0.58; P<0.001 by stratified log-
rank test) (Fig. 1A).
At the time of this analysis, 153 deaths had 
occurred, 60 (14%) in the combination-therapy 
group and 93 (22%) in the placebo group. The 
most common cause of death was melanoma (in 
54 patients [12%] and 77 [18%], respectively). For 
all other deaths (6 in the combination-therapy 
group and 16 in the placebo group), the cause of 
death was listed as “other” or unknown; among 
the patients who died from other or unknown 
causes, melanoma had recurred before death in 
5 in the combination-therapy group and in 15 in 
the placebo group. For the first interim analysis 
of overall survival, which was performed at the 
same time as the primary analysis of relapse-
free survival, the estimated rate of overall sur-
vival was 97% at 1 year, 91% at 2 years, and 86% 
at 3 years in the combination-therapy group, as 
compared with rates of 94%, 83%, and 77%, 
respectively, in the placebo group (hazard ratio 
for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.79; P 
= 
0.0006). 
Despite this low P value, the between-group dif-
ference was not significant because it did not 
cross the prespecified conservative interim 
boundary of P 
= 
0.000019 (Fig. 1B).
The estimated rates of relapse-free survival 
were 88% at 1 year, 67% at 2 years, and 58% at 
3 years in the combination-therapy group, as 
compared with rates of 56%, 44%, and 39%, 
respectively, in the placebo group. At the time of 
this analysis, median relapse-free survival had 
not yet been reached in the combination-therapy 
group (95% CI, 44.5 to not reached) and was 
16.6 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 22.1) in the pla-
cebo group. The higher rate of relapse-free sur-
vival in the combination-therapy group than in 
the placebo group was consistent across patient 
subgroups (Fig. 2). At the time of first recur-
rence, 54 patients (12%) in the combination-
therapy group had locoregional recurrence, 7 (2%) 
had both local and distant recurrence, and 96 
(22%) had distant recurrence, as compared with 
107 (25%), 7 (2%), and 126 (29%), respectively, 
in the placebo group.
Fewer patients had distant metastases or died 
in the combination-therapy group than in the 
placebo group (110 patients [25%] vs. 152 [35%]; 
hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.65; P<0.001) 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Two 
patients (1 in each group) died from causes 
other than melanoma, and their data were cen-
sored in the analysis of freedom from relapse. 
Thus, results for the analysis of freedom from 
relapse were very similar to those for relapse-free 
survival (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Percentages are based on the safety population rather than on the number of 
patients who had disease recurrence (163 who received combination therapy 
with dabrafenib plus trametinib and 247 who received placebo). Patients could 
have had more than one type of therapy. Data regarding therapy after recur‑
rence were available only if such information was provided to the investigator 
by the time of the data cutoff and were not available for patients who with‑
drew from the trial or died shortly after recurrence. CTLA‑4 denotes cytotoxic 
T‑lymphocyte antigen 4, PD‑1 programmed death 1, PD‑L1 programmed

The median time from disease recurrence to the initiation of systemic therapy 
was 7.1 weeks (range, 0 to 136) in the combination‑therapy group and 7.3 weeks 
(range, 0 to 78) in the placebo group.

Safety
A total of 435 patients in the combination-ther-
apy group and 432 patients in the placebo group 
were included in the safety analysis (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). At least one ad-
verse event was reported in 422 patients (97%) in 
Figure 1. Relapse-free Survival and Overall Survival.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of relapse‑free survival (Panel A) and overall survival (Panel B) among the pa‑
tients who received combination therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib and those who received placebo in the 
 
intention‑to‑treat analysis. As of the data cutoff at a median of 2.8 years of follow‑up, disease recurrence or death 
had been reported in 166 of 438 patients (38%) in the combination‑therapy group and in 248 of 432 patients (57%) 
in the placebo group. At the same time, death had been reported in 60 patients (14%) in the combination‑therapy 
group and 93 (22%) in the placebo group, and the median overall survival had not been reached in either group.

Dabrafenib plus Trametinib in BRAF-Mutated Melanoma
the combination-therapy group and in 380 pa-
tients (88%) in the placebo group. Of the adverse 
events that occurred in more than 10% of the 
patients in the combination-therapy group, the 
most common were pyrexia (any grade, 63%; 
grade 3 or 4, 5%), fatigue (any grade, 47%; grade 3 
or 4, 4%), and nausea (any grade, 40%; grade 3 or 
4, <1%) (Table 3). Serious adverse events occurred 
in 155 patients (36%) in the combination-therapy 
group and in 44 patients (10%) in the placebo 
group. One fatal serious adverse event (pneumo-
nia) was reported in the combination-therapy 
group. A new primary melanoma was reported 
in 11 patients (3%) in the combination-therapy 
group and in 10 (2%) in the placebo group. Cuta-
neous squamous-cell carcinoma or keratoacan-
thoma was reported in 8 patients (2%) in the 
combination-therapy group and in 7 (2%) in the 
placebo group; basal-cell carcinoma was reported 
in 19 (4%) and 14 (3%), respectively, and non-
cutaneous cancers in 10 (2%) and 4 (1%), respec-
tively.
In the combination-therapy group, 114 patients 
(26%) had adverse events leading to permanent 
discontinuation of a trial drug, 167 (38%) had ad-
verse events leading to a dose reduction, and 289 
(66%) had adverse events leading to a dose inter-
ruption, as compared with 12 (3%), 11 (3%), and 
65 (15%), respectively, in the placebo group. The 
median duration of exposure to a trial drug was 
11.0 months for both dabrafenib and trametinib 
and 10.0 months for both placebo tablets. The 
median daily dose of dabrafenib (283.9 mg; 
range, 88.5 to 300.0) and trametinib (2.0 mg; 
range, 0.6 to 2.0) was similar to the intended 
daily dose (300 mg and 2 mg, respectively).

Discussion
Among patients with stage III melanoma who 
had undergone resection, the adjuvant use of 
combination therapy with dabrafenib plus tra-
metinib for 12 months resulted in a 53% lower 
risk of relapse (the primary end point) than the 
adjuvant use of placebo at a median follow-up of 
2.8 years. At 3 years, the rate of relapse-free 
survival was 58% in the combination-therapy 
group and 39% in the placebo group. Combina-
tion therapy also resulted in higher rates of overall 
survival, distant metastasis–free survival, and 
freedom from relapse than placebo, with clini-
cally meaningful lower risks of 43%, 49%, and 
53%, respectively. The estimated rate of overall 
survival at 3 years was 86% in the combination-
therapy group and 77% in the placebo group.

Dabrafenib plus Trametinib in BRAF-Mutated Melanoma
The between-group difference (P

to claim statistical significance in the first in-
terim analysis of overall survival.
Although cross-trial comparisons should be 
interpreted with caution, these results are favor-
able in the context of findings from randomized 
studies of interferon (meta-analysis hazard ratio 
for death, 0.89)7 and ipilimumab (EORTC [Euro-
pean Organization for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer] 18071 hazard ratio for death, 0.72; 
5-year rate of overall survival, 65.4%).10 In our 
trial, the proportion of patients who received 
therapy after disease recurrence was similar in 
the two groups, which suggests that the higher 
survival rate in the combination-therapy group 
resulted from the trial drugs and not from 
greater access to immunotherapy regimens, given 
the markedly prolonged time to relapse in the 
combination-therapy group. There was some im-
balance between the two groups with respect to 
the types of therapy that were administered after 
recurrence (e.g., a lower rate of BRAF–MEK in-
hibitor therapy in the combination-therapy group 
than in the placebo group), which could have 
had an effect on overall survival outcomes.
The rate of relapse-free survival of 58% in the 
combination-therapy group at 3 years (hazard 
ratio for relapse or death, 0.47) was also superior 
to that in previous randomized melanoma stud-
ies evaluating adjuvant interferon (meta-analysis 
hazard ratio for disease recurrence, 0.82) or 
ipilimumab (EORTC 18071 hazard ratio, 0.75; 
3-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 46.5%).7,18 
Of note, the ipilimumab dose in EORTC 18071 
(10 mg per kilogram of body weight) was sub-
stantially higher than the currently approved 
regimen and was associated with a high rate of 
discontinuation due to adverse events (52% vs. 
4% with placebo) and 5 treatment-related deaths 
due to immune-related adverse events.18 Further-
more, only 42% of the patients in that trial re-
ceived one or more doses of ipilimumab in the 
maintenance phase. Mature data are awaited 
from the phase 3 E1609 study evaluating adju-
vant high-dose interferon alfa-2b versus ipilimu-
mab at doses of 3 mg or 10 mg per kilogram, 
although the study is not powered to compare 
efficacy between the two ipilimumab doses.19 In 
addition, subgroup analyses in the EORTC 18071 
trial of adjuvant ipilimumab versus placebo10 sug-
gested a potential benefit for adjuvant therapy in 
patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease but not 
those with stage IIIA disease. However, in our 
trial, the clinical benefit of a combination of 
dabrafenib plus trametinib was consistent across 
all subgroups of patients in the analysis, regard-
less of lymph-node involvement or primary-tumor 
ulceration.
In our trial, the most common adverse events 
associated with combination therapy were pyrexia 
and fatigue, events that were similar to those 
reported in key trials of dabrafenib plus tra-
metinib in patients with stage IIIC unresectable 
melanoma or stage IV metastatic melanoma 
with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.13,14,20-25 
Although the rate of discontinuation of combi-
nation therapy because of adverse events in our 
trial (26%) was somewhat higher than that ob-
served in patients with metastatic disease (14 to 
16%),23,25 this factor could be related to the nature 
of adjuvant therapy. In contrast with the EORTC 
18071 trial of adjuvant ipilimumab,10 in our trial 
a majority of the patients completed the sched-
uled 12 months of combination therapy with a 
median dose that was close to the scheduled 
dose for each drug. Furthermore, less than one 
third of the patients discontinued treatment be-
cause of an adverse event. Taken together, these 
results confirm the acceptable side-effect profile 
of the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib 
as adjuvant therapy.
Regarding the use of a control group in our 
trial, at the time of enrollment and of the pri-
mary analysis, observation was the standard of 
care after resection of melanoma in most coun-
tries. Similar placebo-controlled trials that are 
currently evaluating targeted therapies or immuno-
therapies as adjuvant treatment for patients with 
melanoma include the BRIM8 trial of vemura-
fenib (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01667419) 
and the KEYNOTE-054 trial of pembrolizumab 
(NCT02362594). Other ongoing trials of adjuvant 
melanoma therapy include ipilimumab as a con-
trol drug but differ by the exclusion of patients 
with stage IIIA melanoma and the inclusion of 
patients with stage IV disease (i.e., the Check-
Mate 238 trial of nivolumab or ipilimumab 
[NCT02388906] and the CheckMate 915 trial of 
nivolumab combined with ipilimumab or either 
drug alone [NCT03068455]). Currently, the most 
effective duration of adjuvant therapy in patients 
with melanoma is unknown; however, no evi-
dence suggests that a longer treatment duration

provides additional clinical benefit. In our trial, 
adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib treatment 
was planned for 12 months, similar to the 
regimens in BRIM8, KEYNOTE-054, CheckMate 
238,26 and CheckMate 915.
In conclusion, in this phase 3 trial evaluating 
a BRAF–MEK inhibitor combination, the adjuvant 
use of dabrafenib plus trametinib resulted in a 
significantly lower rate of recurrence than the 
adjuvant use of placebo in patients with stage III 
melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. 
In addition, the patients in the combination-
therapy group had higher rates of overall and 
distant metastasis–free survival and freedom from 
relapse, with no reports of new safety signals.
