SUMMARY
Sex has a role in the incidence and outcome of neuro-
logical illnesses, also influencing the response to
treatments. Neuroinflammation is involved in the
onset and progression of several neurological dis-
eases, and the fact that estrogens have anti-inflam-
matory activity suggests that these hormones may
be a determinant in the sex-dependent manifestation
of brain pathologies. We describe significant differ-
ences in the transcriptome of adult male and female
microglia, possibly originating from perinatal expo-
sure to sex steroids. Microglia isolated from adult
brains maintain the sex-specific features when put
in culture or transplanted in the brain of the opposite
sex. Female microglia are neuroprotective because
they restrict the damage caused by acute focal cere-
bral ischemia. This study therefore provides insight
into a distinct perspective on the mechanisms under-
scoring a sexual bias in the susceptibility to brain
diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Investigation into the role of microglia, the myeloid cells that
reside in the CNS, has begun to receive intense interest, unrav-
elling the complexity of the effects that these cells have on neural
functions and establishing their major role in the development
and life-long maintenance of brain homeostasis (Kierdorf and
Prinz, 2017; Prinz and Priller, 2014; Salter and Stevens, 2017).
During development, microglia have been shown to influence
neurodevelopmental processes such as axon guidance, neurite
growth, and synaptic pruning (Kettenmann et al., 2013; Schafer
et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015), and to follow a precise and coordi-
nated transcriptional program (Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016). In
addition, it has been demonstrated that microglia participate in
the process of brain masculinization induced by the neonatal
surge of male gonadal activity (Lenz et al., 2013); this process or-
ganizes brain architecture by structuring neuronal circuits to be
activated by sexual functions after puberty (Arnold and Gorski,
1984; MacLusky and Naftolin, 1981). In adults, microglia are
the first line of protection against noxious stimuli such as stress
and pathogenic insults, and they maintain healthy brain function
by pruning synapses (Kettenmann et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015),
clearing debris (Neumann et al., 2009), and synthesizing growth
and repair factors (Hu et al., 2015). In spite of this, prolonged
microglia stimulation may lead to neuronal damage. Indeed,
several recent studies have highlighted the involvement of mi-
croglia and neuroinflammation in the manifestation of major
neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.
The finding that these cells are responsive to estrogens and
that their immune functions and inflammatory response are
significantly mitigated by estrogens (Vegeto et al., 2001) may
point to a role of this hormone in determining the sex-specific
prevalence, onset, and course of numerous brain diseases
(Vegeto et al., 2002; Villa et al., 2016). Furthermore, increasing
evidence suggests that neurological disorders have their roots
in diversions from a normal developmental trajectory, and distur-
bances and a loss of microglial function have been associated
with the onset of brain diseases (Prinz and Priller, 2014). Consid-
ering the role of microglia in brain sexual differentiation, it could
be hypothesized that the effects of estrogens during brain differ-
entiation may induce permanent effects in microglia, enabling
these cells to contribute to sex-related manifestation of brain
diseases (Villa et al., 2016).
The aim of the present study was to identify the differences in
the transcriptome of male and female microglia isolated from
adult healthy mice and to verify the extent to which microglia
sex differences might affect the progress of pathologies where
these immune cells play a major role.
RESULTS
RNA-Sequencing Highlights Sex Differences in Adult
Microglia
To study the expression profile of male and female microglia, we
took advantage of a recently developed methodology to isolate
these cells at high level of purity from adult brain (Hanamsagar
et al., 2017; Pepe et al., 2014) (Figure S1A–S1D). To avoid the
variability related to rearing, environment, or diets affecting the
metabolism and the microbiome, both well-known regulators
of the brain immune system (Hooper et al., 2012), care was taken
to match the mice in terms of age and to take the same number of
males and females from each of the litters utilized in the study. To
limit any circadian influence and facilitate the analysis of the
phase of the cycle, in all experiments, animals were euthanized

 at the same hours (between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.); females were at
metestrus, a phase with low circulating estrogens.
The transcriptome was investigated by RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq; RNA-seq data are available at the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive: SRP104620). The RNAs were prepared from
pools of 6 brains each: 2 pools were from males and 2 pools
from females; thus, we utilized a total of 12 mice/sex. Mice
were 12 weeks old. The transcriptional data were initially
analyzed by AltAnalyze (Olsson et al., 2016) and mapped over
the Tissue Fate Map to demonstrate the absence of contamina-
tions from other neural cells. Indeed, the reads per kilobase
million (RPKM) relative to biomarkers of neutrophils (Ly6g), B
cells (Cd19), T cells (Cd3–Cd8), astrocytes (Aldh1l1), neurons
(Thy1), and oligodendrocytes (Olig1) were found to be negligible
with respect to the predominant microglia markers.
To determine the differently expressed genes (DEGs), we car-
ried out the statistical analysis using the CuffDiff (Trapnell et al.,
2012) software. By applying a threshold of 0.01 to the false dis-
covery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg correction)-adjusted
p values (pVal), we identified 546 DEGs (Figure 1A). The reliability
of the RNA-seq results was tested on microglia isolated from
12 additional individuals (males, n = 6; females, n = 6); the
results obtained with qPCR on a panel of 20 mRNAs randomly
selected among those with sex-dependent and sex-indepen-
dent
expression
demonstrated
the
reproducibility
of
the
RNA-seq data (Figure S1E).
Next, to identify whether the DEGs could be associated with
specific functional categories, we carried out a clustering
analysis by Enrichr (Kuleshov et al., 2016). The majority of the
204 genes more expressed in males belonged to Gene Ontology
classes associated with inflammatory processes, including
regulation of cell migration and cytokine production (Figure 1B).
Whole-genome molecular signature analysis of transcription
factors (TFs) pointed to nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) as the TF
most involved in the regulation of the DEG preferentially ex-
pressed in males, together with other TFs associated with in-
flammatory processes (RUNX1) (Kierdorf and Prinz, 2013),
migration (FOXM1) (Balli et al., 2012), and negative regulation
of neurogenesis (GATA2) (El Wakil et al., 2006). In contrast, no
association with inflammation was found in the DEGs distinctive
of female microglia that were grouped in ontogenies associated
with morphogenesis, development, or cytoskeleton organization
under the control of several TFs such as NANOG (Duan et al.,
2013) and TCF3 (Miao et al., 2014), linked to the inhibition of
inflammatory response and promotion of repair mechanisms
(Duan et al., 2013; Miao et al., 2014), aside from the estrogen
receptor alpha (ESR1) itself. The lack of a sex-dependent
pro-inflammatory profile in macrophages isolated from the
peritoneum of the male mice studied above (G.P. and E.V., un-
published data) suggested that this could be a microglia-specific
feature.
The Inflammatory Phenotype of Male Microglia
We continued our study in the NFkB-luc2 mouse model where
the luciferase gene was under the control of an NF-kB-respon-
sive synthetic promoter. This reporter mouse was specifically
designed to study the inflammatory status in living cells and
animals (Rizzi et al., 2017). Whole-body, in vivo imaging in

 unstimulated conditions showed that the bioluminescence was
comparable in siblings of the two sexes (n = 3) (Figure 1C); this
result suggested a similar, generalized state of NF-kB transcrip-
tional activation in males and females. However, when we
measured luciferase activity in microglia purified from adult sib-
lings of both sexes (n = 3), the luciferase activity was 2.4-fold
higher in males (Figure 1D). These data supported our previous
bioinformatic analysis by demonstrating that in male microglia
NF-kB was transcriptionally activated, suggesting that male
microglia cells were more poised to inflammatory reactions
than female microglia. To substantiate the hypothesis of
male microglia more prone to inflammatory activation, we further
analyzed the RNA-seq data, focusing on a total of 95 genes
that had been experimentally demonstrated to be targets of
NF-kB and involved in immune or inflammatory responses
(http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/).
Consistent with previous results, unbiased male-female
comparative analysis (Figure 2A) showed that 79% of the 95 in-
flammatory genes were more expressed in males, and 34 of
these genes were differentially expressed with a threshold of
0.05 applied to the FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg correction)-
adjusted p values (clusters D, E, and F); of the remaining genes,
14% were expressed similarly in the two sexes (clusters B
and C), and 7% were grouped in cluster A, possibly for having
a trend to be more expressed in females.
Is Circulating 17b-Estradiol Responsible for Microglial
Sex Differences?
To investigate the extent to which estrogens contributed to the
sex differences observed in the NF-kB-regulated genes, we
extended the analysis to the RNA-seq data on microglia isolated
from mice ovariectomized (OVX) with or without estrogen
replacement for 3 or 24 hr; such data were generated using
groups of animals reared and treated in parallel with those
described above. After ovariectomy, we observed a tendency
toward a reduction in differences between the two sexes, with
a generalized increase in the expression of the 95 NF-kB-driven
genes (Figure 2A). However, Pearson analysis did not show sig-
nificant changes when we did correlation analyses between the
NF-kB genes expressed in OVX females/males (R = 0.9327) and
cycling females/males (R = 0.8589), leading us to conclude that
the gene expression of microglia was not significantly influenced
by the lack of circulating sex steroids. Moreover, in the OVX
mice, 17 of the original 34 DEGs were still found to be less ex-
pressed (with a threshold of 0.05 applied to the adjusted
p values) than in males despite the lack of circulating estrogens;
this finding pointed to the contribution of factors other than
estrogens to the low expression of NF-kB-regulated genes. Hor-
mone replacement induced a trend in the expression of these
genes; hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation, average link-
age) identified three clusters of genes for which estrogen admin-
istration induced a rapid, transient increase (78%, clusters B, D,
and F; Figure 2A), and a smaller group of genes (22%, clusters A,
C, and E) showed the opposite trend, with a decreased expres-
sion after 3 hr of 17b-estradiol (E2) treatment.
These findings suggested that the transcriptional differences
of the NF-kB-regulated genes did not depend on estrogens
in a predictable way, and that additional factors played a
role
in
differentiating
the
male
and
female
microglia
transcriptomes.
To evaluate whether the sex differences observed were main-
tained in vitro, we prepared primary cultures of microglia isolated
from adult male and female mice. To enable microglia to survive
and to preserve their responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli, the
adult microglia cells were co-cultured with neurons dissected
from hippocampi of rat embryos differentiated to mature neu-
rons with >98% homogeneity (Gardoni et al., 2002). Bias of the
co-culture was avoided by using a mix of male and female
neurons.
Morphological analysis of microglia in culture (Benedusi et al.,
2017) showed significant sex differences: 75% of male microglia
had the globular morphology associated with the pro-inflamma-
tory phenotype, and the remaining had the ramified branches
connected with the surveilling status; in females, the percentage
of activated microglia cells was much lower (50%) (Figure 2B).
Consistent with this observation, qPCR on a subset of DEGs
showed that the microglia grown in culture preserved, by and
large, the expression pattern of the sex of origin (Figures 2C
and 2D). Thus, microglia in culture appeared to maintain a
gene expression characteristic of the sex of origin.
Female Microglia Retain Their Sex after Transplantation
in the Male Brain
To better demonstrate that the transcriptome of adult microglia
was sexually differentiated and independent of the in vivo hor-
monal environment, we investigated the gene expression profile
of female microglia after transplantation into a male brain. In
designing the transfer experiment, we anticipated several poten-
tial limitations, such as host versus graft reactions, microglia
viability, and the ability to proliferate and migrate throughout
the host brain. To facilitate the host brain repopulation by the
transplanted microglia and limit adverse reactions, we first
depleted the endogenous microglia. Previous reports had
demonstrated that PLX3397, a small-molecule inhibitor of the
CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) and related kinases, was able to pro-
mote selective microglia apoptosis (Elmore et al., 2014). This ef-
fect was transient, and microglia started to proliferate upon
cessation of the treatment (Elmore et al., 2014). We administered
PLX3397 via the transnasal (tsn) route to improve its permeation
and diffusion throughout the brain parenchyma. Dose-response
experiments allowed the identification of 100 mg/die as the
minimum effective dose of PLX3397 necessary to deplete
>90% of microglia after 7 days of treatment; no sign of toxicity
was observed at higher dosages (data not shown). To be sure
to maintain effective concentrations of PLX3397 in the brain,
we treated the mice with 100 mg twice a day. The efficacy of
the treatment was measured by the following: (1) counting the
cells that were isolated from a single brain (Figure S2A); (2)
measuring the whole brain content of the mRNA encoding the
complement C1q subcomponent subunit A (C1qa), constitu-
tively expressed in microglia (Fonseca et al., 2017) (Figure S2B);
and (3) flow cytometry (Figure S2C). As reported previously in the
literature (Elmore et al., 2014), at day 7, only a very small percent-
age (<8%) of the endogenous microglia was spared by the
treatment; interruption of drug administration resulted in a rapid
microglia proliferation starting 24 hr after the end of treatment,

 and 5 days after ending PLX3397 administration, the brain con-
tent of microglia cells was back to normal (Figure S2A). Having
established the procedure to eliminate the majority of the host
microglia, we proceeded with the transplantation using microglia
purified from female UBC-luc2 (G4063), a transgenic mouse
model where the expression of the luciferase reporter is

 constitutive and not affected by sex and age (Rizzi et al., 2017).
Prior to cell transplantation, we showed that in the isolated
microglia, the light emission was directly proportional to the
cell number (Figure S2D). For the cell transfer, we avoided brain
injections and opted for the tsn route to preserve brain inflamma-
tory homeostasis and blood-brain barrier integrity. A total num-
ber of 350,000–400,000 female bioluminescent microglia cells
were tsn-transferred to the microglia-depleted male brains
24 hr after the interruption of PLX3397 treatment. The tsn admin-
istration enabled the distribution of cells throughout the forebrain
and the caudal brain, including the brainstem and cerebellum
(see Figure S2E and its legend). Ex vivo imaging (Stell et al.,
2008) established that 3 days after the tsn administration, the
bioluminescent exogenous microglia cells were located mainly
in the cortex (Figure 3A). This was expected on the basis of the
route of administration selected (Figure S2E). At day 5, the signif-
icant increase of bioluminescence indicated that the trans-
planted female microglia were actively proliferating; furthermore,
these cells had spread in most brain areas including the cortex,
hippocampus, caudate and putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus,
mid-brain, and pons (Figure S2F). The presence in the recipient
male brain of an mRNA that is exclusively expressed in females,
the X-inactive specific transcript (Xist), demonstrated that the
transfer experiment had been successful (Figure 3C). In addition,
the exogenous microglia were alive and transcriptionally active
because the amount of Xist mRNA detectable 3 days after the
transfer was increased at day 5 (Figure 3C). At day 5, the ratio
of Xist to C1qa mRNAs indicated that the transplanted female
cells were approximately 19% of the total host brain microglia
(Figure 3C); this amount was confirmed by flow cytometry of
CX3CR1-GFP male microglia transplanted in wild-type (males
or females) (Figure S2G); the same experiment allowed to
demonstrate that the transplanted cells maintained the expres-
sion of microglia-specific biomarkers (Tmem119) (Bennett
et al., 2016) (Figure S2H). Further experiments with female or
male microglia transplanted into male recipients (F/M or M/M,
respectively) established that the sex of origin did not influence
the ability of these cells to proliferate; indeed, Figure 3D shows
that the expressions of selected genes (C1qa marker of
total microglia content, Ki67 associated with cell proliferation,
and Cdk3 expressed during G0–G1 and G1–S cell-cycle transi-
tions) was the same in male or female transplanted cells. To
investigate the extent to which the transplanted microglia pre-
served their sex-specific identity, we transplanted fluorescent
microglia (from male or female CX3CR1-GFP mice) in WT
males and analyzed the expression of selected genes in the
fluorescent cells isolated by FACS. Male fluorescent cells trans-
planted in males (M/M) maintained the male-specific (M) profile
of expression (relatively high Akt1s1, Trem1, S100a9, and
Cxcl2 and low Shank3, Fxyd1, Aqp1, and Timp3); female cells
transplanted in males (F/M) were able to keep a profile of expres-
sion superimposable with that of the control females (F) (Figures
3E and 3F).
The combination of all the experiments conducted highlighted
the possibility of a genomic and/or epigenetic component that
sexually differentiates microglia gene expression. It is known
that the perinatal androgen surge from male testis and the sub-
sequent local aromatization of testosterone to estradiol is crucial
for the permanent modification of neuronal functions character-
istic of brain masculinization (Arnold and Gorski, 1984; McCarthy
and Nugent, 2015; Villa et al., 2016). In line with these reports,
imaging experiments on ERE-Luc mice showed that perinatal
activation of ERa is restricted to males (Figures S3A and S3B).
To directly show that in addition to neurons the perinatal
exposure to estrogens could affect microglia gene expression
permanently,
we
followed
a
classical
protocol
of
brain
masculinization by treating male and female pups with E2
benzoate at days P2, P5, and P8 (McCarthy, 2008; Wu et al.,
2009). The masculinized females were unable to cycle at
6–8 weeks of age, demonstrating the efficacy of the protocol.
The extent to which the treatment had affected microglia gene
expression was assessed by qPCR of the four DEGs previously
identified as more expressed in males. Figure 3G shows that in
the microglia extracted from the masculinized brains, the
expression of Akts, Trem1, and CxCl2 was not significantly
different than in males; S100a9 was not affected by the brain
masculinization.
Protective Action of Female Microglia in Ischemia
We next asked whether microglia sex-specific gene expression
had any functional relevance. Several authors demonstrated
that in the case of forebrain or focal ischemia, young adult female
rodents sustain smaller injury than males, and females have
lower mortality than males (Murphy et al., 2004; Spychala
et al., 2017). The course of microglia activation after cerebral
ischemia has been largely described, and it is well known that
microglia proliferation at the infarct site limits the ischemic dam-
age possibly because microglia generate neurotrophic factors
that are beneficial for neuronal plasticity (Lalancette-He
´ bert
et al., 2007). Considering this fact, and based on the results ob-
tained with our RNA-seq analyses that unstimulated female
microglia have a higher propensity than male microglia to ex-
press genes involved in cell plasticity, the control of the inflam-
matory response, and repair mechanisms, we questioned
whether transferring female microglia into male brains would
have restricted the brain damage consequent to ischemia. First,
we subjected adult WT male (n = 6) and female (n = 6) mice to
permanent focal cerebral ischemia (permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion [pMCAO]) (Gelosa et al., 2014), and we carried
out diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 2, 24, and 48 hr after
the ischemic insult. In DWI, the ischemic lesion appears hypoin-
tense, consistent with a decrease in the apparent diffusion coef-
ficient of water (ADC), which is a weighted average between the
intracellular (assumed to be lower) and extracellular diffusion co-
efficients (assumed to be higher). The decrease in ADC reflects
the changes in the ratio of intracellular and extracellular volume,
because ischemia-induced energy impairment and membrane
pump failure allow the osmotic drainage of water from extracel-
lular to intracellular spaces that leads to cytotoxic edema (van
Gelderen et al., 1994). The results obtained in control animals
(Figure S4A) showed that in males, the damaged area at
24 and 48 hr was larger than in females, which is in line with pre-
vious reports (Spychala et al., 2017). Next, we transplanted
16 adult male mice with microglia purified either from male (n =
8 M/M) or female mice (n = 8 F/M). Figure 4A shows the DWI of
the transplanted mice at 2, 24, and 48 hr after ischemia. At 2 hr

 after the infarct, the sex of origin of the transplanted microglia did
not influence the volume of the damage (Figure S4B). This was
expected because in our experience, changes in the damage
size are not detectable at early phase after ischemia (Gelosa
et al., 2014). In the M/M group, the progression of the damage
was significantly higher (+26% after 48 hr) than in the F/M group
(Figure 4B), thus pointing to a protective action of the female mi-
croglia. Male microglia into female brain (n = 8) did not provide as
clear and significant results (Figure S4C).
To determine the ability of exogenous microglia to migrate to
the infarct site, we subjected mice transplanted with biolumi-
nescent G4063 microglia to pMCAO. Bioluminescence imaging
revealed that after pMCAO, a large amount of the biolumines-
cent, exogenous microglia accumulated in the vicinity of the
infarct site (Figure S4D). The phenotype of microglia at the
lesion site was investigated by immunostaining of the pMCAO
lesioned brain. We used Ab against Ym1 as a marker for micro-
glia anti-inflammatory activation and against CD16/32 as a
marker for pro-inflammatory activation (Figure 4C). Low-magni-
fication confocal imaging of the fields of view surrounding the
ischemic lesion revealed that Ym1 immunoreactivity was higher
in brain samples obtained from the F/M animals. At higher
magnification (3100), the immunofluorescence showed that
both CD16/32 and Ym1 co-localized with Iba1 immunoreac-
tivity (Figure 4D). Semiquantitative, double-blind analyses of
the average fluorescence brightness in Iba1-positive cells sur-
rounding the ischemic lesion showed Ym1 immunoreactivity
significantly higher (+92%) in F/M versus M/M (Figure 4E).
CD16/32 staining was comparable in both experimental groups
(Figure S4E).

 DISCUSSION
The present study shows that microglia cells are sexually
differentiated, as indicated by the sex-specific expression of
a significant number of genes. Microglia cells maintain sex-
specific expression independently by the circulating sex ste-
roids, which was demonstrated by putting adult microglia in
culture or by their transplant in the opposite sex. In addition,
ovariectomy did not show very significant changes in micro-
glia gene expression. The mechanism involved in microglia
sexual differentiation remains to be determined. The fact
that neonatal treatment of female brain with estrogens (using
a protocol known to induce brain defemination) altered the
expression of selected genes may suggest that similar to
what was reported for neurons, the sex of microglia is deter-
mined at birth. Microglia are an autonomous self-proliferating
population of cells that migrate from the yolk sac prior to
hematopoiesis. Following brain colonization, these cells differ-
entiate into microglia, and the formation of the blood-brain
barrier prevents the infiltration of peripheral cells, at least
under healthy conditions. Therefore, the masculinizing surge
of testosterone might induce the differentiation of this cell
population, because neonatal microglia express the estrogen
receptor alpha (Crain et al., 2013; Sierra et al., 2008). Other
authors studying microglia in embryos, neonates, and adult
mice showed that there are precise temporal phases that
characterize microglia development (Matcovitch-Natan et al.,
2016), and that the immune reactivity of these cells is sexually
differentiated very early in development (Hanamsagar et al.,
2017). In addition, during the first week postpartum in mice,
there are sexual differences in the morphology and the num-
ber of these cells (Lenz et al., 2013), and microglia have an
inflammatory morphology that converts to a largely ramified
state occurring by the third week after birth when male de-
femination is completed. These observations have suggested
that microglia in the neonatal brain are involved in more than a
response to brain injury or inflammation; that is, microglia
actively participate in the formation of specific brain circuitries
by regulating a variety of developmental processes and phys-
iological functions including synapse elimination, spinogene-
sis, spine elimination, and synaptic physiology (Tremblay
et al., 2011).
Our study suggests that the local neonatal synthesis of es-
trogen associated with the androgen surge from the male
testis may not be a cause of transient activation of microglia
but might have permanent (organizational) effects on these
cells by inducing a sexual phenotype that is maintained in
the adult animals. This would explain why male or female
microglia have the tendency to maintain the same gene
expression when transplanted in the opposite sex. Indeed,
analogous to what occurs in neurons where their sensitivity
and ability to respond to specific hormonal and environmental
stimuli (activational effects) is permanently affected by the
neonatal estrogen priming, our data suggest that in male mi-
croglia, the estrogen priming changes their immune capacity
by enhancing their ability to react to inflammatory stimuli.
These data are in agreement with a very recent study aimed
at comparing the male and female microglia transcriptome
in relation with the stage of development (Hanamsagar
et al., 2017).
We do not know what the teleological meaning of this sexual
differentiation is; certainly, our studies show that this biological
event has functional repercussions on the damage caused
from acute cerebral ischemia (MCAO) (Figure 4). It is well known
that the damage induced by MCAO is significantly higher in
males than in females, and several studies have debated
whether this is due to a lower susceptibility of female neurons
to ischemia or to differences in the evolution of the neuroinflam-
matory response (Murphy et al., 2004). The findings reported
here that female microglia are better apt than male microglia to
reduce the ischemic damage also when transplanted in males
highlight an intrinsic sex-specific microglia phenotype that might
be independent from the hormonal environment. This is in line
with the observation that in humans, males have a higher
incidence of stroke and poorer outcomes afterward (Golomb
et al., 2009). However, we cannot definitively conclude that
estrogens
do
not
influence
microglia
activity,
because
aromatase is expressed in the male brain and may convert
locally the circulating testosterone into estradiol (McCullough
et al., 2003).
Our results point to microglia as major actors in the evolution
of the ischemic insult; this is in accordance with prior literature,
as our observations were conducted at 24 and 48 hr after
ischemia. Morphological, immunohistochemical, MRI-based,
and pharmacological studies have shown that in the first 72 hr
after ischemia, the CNS resident microglia control the course
of inflammation, generating anti-inflammatory or repair mole-
cules in the insult area (Gelderblom et al., 2009; Rupalla et al.,
1998). Additionally, microglia participate in attracting peripheral
immune cells that populate the damaged area at later times (Gel-
derblom et al., 2009). At this point, it is possible that in females,
the presence of circulating estrogens limits the damage caused
by an excessive inflammatory response, because female
monocytic cells were shown to better transit toward the anti-in-
flammatory phenotype (Villa et al., 2015) and were likely able to
confine the tissue damage induced by the hypoxic stimulus,
possibly by virtue of the limited expression of genes encoding
inflammatory proteins. Interestingly, when we transplanted
male microglia into female brains, we did not observe an in-
crease in the ischemic area with time. This might be because
the female resident microglia buffered the effects of the grafted
cells.
Neuropsychiatric or neurological diseases may manifest in a
large percentage of the population (approximately 25% of in-
dividuals suffer from brain disorders in their lifespan) with a
pattern of susceptibility that is associated with sex. Females
are more affected by diseases that occur during adulthood,
whereas males are particularly vulnerable to life-long illnesses
of neurodevelopmental origin. Considering the number of
studies underscoring the relevance of inflammation in brain
disturbances, the finding of a sex difference in male and fe-
male susceptibility to neuroinflammation provides a basis for
a sex-related approach to therapy that must be based on a
better understanding of the relationships among the endo-
crine, immune, and nervous systems in young and adult
individuals.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Animal studies were carried out at the Department of Pharmacological and
Biomolecular Sciences. All animal experimentation was carried out in accor-
dance with the ARRIVE and European Guidelines for Animal Care. All animal
experiments were approved by the Italian Ministry of Research and University
(permission numbers: 12-12-30012012, 547/2015, 479/2015) and controlled
by a departmental panel of experts.
C57BL/6 and CX3CR1-GFP mice at 3 months of age were supplied by
Charles River (Charles River Laboratories, Calco, Italy). Both male and female
mice were used throughout experiments as described earlier. Animals were
allowed access to food and water ad libitum and kept in temperature-
controlled facilities on a 12-hr light and dark cycle. More details are available
in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Pharmacological Manipulations
E2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy) was administered by a 100 mL s.c. injection of 5 mg/kg
E2 (which results in circulating E2 levels comparable with those at proestrus
[Ciana et al., 2003]) dissolved in corn oil by overnight (o/n) stirring in the dark
at room temperature; control animals received corn oil injection alone. E2 ben-
zoate was administered by a s.c. injection of 5 mg in 50 mL of corn oil; control
animals received corn oil alone.
Microglia Sorting
Isolation of microglia from the whole brains of adult mice was performed as
described in Pepe et al. (2014). More details are available in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
PLX3397 Administration
8.3 mg of PLX3397 was dissolved in 1 mL of 5% DMSO + 45% polyethylene
glycol 300 (PEG300) + ddH2O (double-distilled water) solution. Prior to tsn
administration, animals were anesthetized with s.c. injection of 50 mL solution
of ketamine (93.6 mg/kg, Ketavet 100; Intervet, Milan, Italy) and xylazine
(7.2 mg/kg, Rompun; Bayer, Milan, Italy). More details are available in the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell Cultures
Primary neuronal cultures were obtained from the hippocampi of 18-day-old
fetal Sprague Dawley rats of both sexes (Charles River Italia). Neurons were
transfected at 7 days in vitro (DIV7) using the calcium-phosphate method
with 2 mg of EGFP plasmid. At DIV10 microglia were isolated from the brain
of adult mice and seeded over rat neurons with a microglia:neuron ratio of
1:10. At DIV14, cells were either processed for immunocytochemistry or resus-
pended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and processed for RNA
preparation.
Morphological Analysis of Iba1-Stained Microglia
Three images of six slides per experimental condition were taken. The size of
the fields analyzed was 173 mm 3 218 mm. Morphological analyses were per-
formed in a double-blind manner as previously described (Benedusi et al.,
2017). ImageJ software was used to measure immunoreactivity through a
threshold method, and the number of positive pixels and the extension of
area of interest were used to determine the fractional area covered by the spe-
cific signal.
Brain Masculinization
Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were individually housed after pups’ birth. All pups
within a litter were subcutaneously injected with vehicle (50 mL corn oil) or treat-
ment (5 mg E2 benzoate in 50 mL corn oil) (Wu et al., 2009) at post-natal
day 2 (P2), P5, and P8. At P21, females and males were housed in separate
cages. At 10–14 weeks of age, vaginal smears were carried out to study the
ability of the females to cycle.
MRI Analysis
Brain infarct size was visualized by DWI at 2, 24, and 48 hr after MCAO using a
4.7 T, vertical super-wide bore magnet of a Bruker Avance II spectrometer with
microimaging accessory. More details are available in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis of RNA-seq data were carried out using the CuffDiff (Trap-
nell et al., 2012) software. A t test was used to calculate the p value for
differential expression. A threshold of 0.01 was applied to FDR-adjusted p
values (q values) in order to select the DEGs to use in downstream analyses.
Cluster analyses were performed with the Genesis software tool (https://
genome.tugraz.at/genesisclient/genesisclient_description.shtml) to log-trans-
form, normalize, and center gene expressions, and populations and genes
were clustered by Pearson correlation. Overrepresentation analysis (ORA)
on DEG lists was performed using Enrichr for enrichment analysis. The mouse
genome was used as background list. Biological processes, molecular
functions, and KEGG pathways were investigated focusing on enriched terms
with a Benjamini-adjusted p value less than 0.05.
Statistical significance of the other reported data were calculated using
Prism 7 software (GraphPad); unless otherwise indicated in the figure legend,
one-way ANOVA for single-treatment comparisons or two-way ANOVA for
multiple treatment comparisons was applied. A p value less than 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.
