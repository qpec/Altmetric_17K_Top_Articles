IMPORTANCE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible
vision impairment in older adults in the United States, yet little is known about whether AMD
is appropriately diagnosed in primary eye care.
OBJECTIVES To examine the prevalence of eyes with AMD in patients seen in primary eye care
clinics who purportedly have normal macular health per their medical record and the
association of AMD with patient and physician characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study of primary eye care
practices in Birmingham, Alabama, 644 persons 60 years or older with normal macular
health per medical record based on their most recent dilated comprehensive eye examination
by a primary eye care ophthalmologist or optometrist were enrolled from May 1, 2009,
through December 31, 2011. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2016, through
December 20, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Presence of AMD as defined by the Clinical Age-Related
Maculopathy Staging system based on color fundus photography and a masked grader.
Types of AMD-associated lesions were noted. Patient health and physician characteristics
were collected.
RESULTS The sample consisted of 1288 eyes from 644 participants (231 [35.9%] male and
413 [64.1%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.4 [6.1] years; 611 white [94.9%]) seen by 31 primary
eye care ophthalmologists or optometrists. A total of 968 eyes (75.2%) had no AMD, in
agreement with their medical record; 320 (24.8%) had AMD despite no diagnosis of AMD in
the medical record. Among eyes with undiagnosed AMD, 32 (10.0%) had hyperpigmentation,
43 (13.4%) had hypopigmentation, 249 (77.8%) had small drusen, 250 (78.1%) had
intermediate drusen, and 96 (30.0%) had large drusen. Undiagnosed AMD was associated
with older patient age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09; P < .001), male sex
(age-adjusted OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91; P = .04), and less than a high school education
(age-adjusted OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.03-5.62; P = .04). Prevalence of undiagnosed AMD was
not different for ophthalmologists and optometrists (age adjusted OR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.71-1.36; P = .94).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 25.0% of eyes deemed to be normal based on
dilated eye examination by primary eye care physicians had macular characteristics that
indicated AMD revealed by fundus photography and trained raters. A total of 30.0% of eyes
with undiagnosed AMD had AMD with large drusen that would have been treatable with
nutritional supplements had it been diagnosed. Improved AMD detection strategies may be
needed in primary eye care as more effective treatment strategies for early AMD become
available in the coming years.

 A
ge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex,
multifactorial disease that affects older adults in which
central retinal photoreceptors are lost by atrophic or
neovascular processes, resulting in progressive loss of cen-
tralacuity.Approximately14millionAmericanshaveAMD,and
as the baby boomer population ages, this public health prob-
lem is expected to worsen.1,2 Even in early AMD, there is a sig-
nificant personal burden attributable to reading difficulty,3,4
driving cessation,5,6 decreased health-related quality of life,7
depression,8 and anxiety about possible blindness.9 Given the
high prevalence of AMD in the older adult population and the
availability of treatment options to slow some types of AMD,
it is worthwhile to examine the extent to which AMD is de-
tected in the primary eye care clinic and to what extent AMD
may be underdiagnosed in this setting. Although there are
currently no proven effective treatments for early AMD, the
next and emerging frontier for AMD treatment development
is targeted at early AMD. Within this context, early detection
of AMD will be beneficial for the individual and public health.
Ophthalmologists and optometrists whose practices focus on
primary care will ultimately be at the center of this process,
tasked with the responsibility of early AMD detection in the
increasing numbers of older eyes at risk for AMD.
This study uses a large sample of older adults who were
judged to have normal macular health in both eyes by their pri-
mary eye care ophthalmologist or optometrist based on a di-
latedeyeexamination.10,11Wereporttheprevalenceofeyeswith
AMD in this sample for which color fundus photography and
photographic grading using a clinical AMD classification sys-
tem were implemented to confirm the presence vs absence of
AMD. How patient and physician characteristics relate to the
prevalence of eyes with undiagnosed AMD is also reported.
Methods
Study participants consisted of 644 adults 60 years or older
enrolled in the Alabama Study on Early Age-Related Macular
Degeneration (ALSTAR) from May 1, 2009, through December
31, 2011.10,11 Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2016,
through December 20, 2016. Participants were recruited from
primaryeyecarepracticesinBirmingham,Alabama;theseprac-
ticescareforpatientswithMedicare,Medicaid,orprivatehealth
insurance. Written informed consent was obtained from par-
ticipants after the nature and purpose of the study were de-
scribed. All data were deidentified. The participants received a
stipend. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and
followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.12
To be eligible, the person’
s medical record from the most
recent comprehensive dilated examination could not indi-
cate a diagnosis of AMD in either eye and the medical record
notes could not contain terms that signified the signs of AMD
(eg, drusen, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation,
geographic atrophy [GA], choroidal neovascularization).
ALSTAR exclusion criteria were no previous diagnoses of glau-
coma, other retinal conditions, optic nerve conditions, cor-
neal disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease,
brain injury, or other neurologic or psychiatric conditions as
revealed by the medical record or by self-report. For the pur-
poses of the study, 3-field, digital color fundus photography
(Carl Zeiss Meditec 450 Plus camera) was completed on each
eye after dilation with tropicamide, 1%, and phenylephrine hy-
drochloride, 2.5%. A trained and experienced grader (M.E.C.)
evaluated fundus photographs for the presence and severity
of AMD by using the Clinical Age-Related Maculopathy Stag-
ing (CARMS) system.13 Digital fundus imaging software
(Sonomed Escalon’
s OphthaVision, version 4.0) was used to
place a 6-mm Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid
centeredonthefoveainfield2(macula)toapproximatea2-mm
disc diameter (based on a 1.5-mm disc diameter) distance from
the fovea for grading. Drusen sizing circles were available to
determine drusen sizes of 63 μm or less, 63 μm or greater but
125 μm or less, and 125 μm or greater (C0 and C1 circle sizes in
the Wisconsin grading protocol) to determine drusen load.
Drusensizeandnumber;retinalpigmentationlevel;retinalpig-
ment epithelial detachment size, type, and location; choroi-
dal neovascular membranes; and/or disciform scar were all as-
sessed according to the CARMS designations. The CARMS was
used in this study because it was designed specifically for use
in clinical practice in which usual care consists of a dilated fun-
dus examination using a slitlamp. Furthermore, the CARMS
has been validated against color fundus photographs evalu-
ated by expert graders. Thus, the CARMS was well suited for
this study because the focus is on the identification of AMD
by primary eye care physicians. The CARMS consists of a 5-cat-
egory scale, briefly summarized here. Stage 1 of the CARMS is
no drusen or fewer than 10 small drusen defined as less than
63 μm in diameter, which serves as our case definition of nor-
mal macular health; stage 2 is approximately 10 or more small
drusen or fewer than 15 intermediate drusen or pigment ab-
normalities associated with AMD; stage 3 is approximately 15
or more intermediate drusen or any large drusen; stage 4 is GA
of the macula center or noncentral GA at least 350 μm in size;
and stage 5 is exudative AMD. In performing CARMS grading,
the grader noted when an eye had any of the following char-
acteristics or lesions: hyperpigmentation, hypopigmenta-
tion, more than 10 small drusen, intermediate drusen (≥63 μm
but <125 μm in diameter), large drusen (≥125 μm in diam-
eter), drusenoid retinal pigment epithelial detachment,
serous retinal pigment epithelial detachment, GA, choroidal
neovascularization, or disciform scar.
Key Points
Question To what extent is age-related macular degeneration
(AMD) undiagnosed by primary eye care physicians when AMD is
actually present?
Findings In this cross-sectional study, 320 of 1288 eyes had AMD
despite no diagnosis of AMD in the primary eye care medical
record, including 30.0% with undiagnosed large drusen.
Meaning As treatments and monitoring strategies for early AMD
are refined in the future, these data suggest that improvements
for correct, prompt identification of AMD seem to be warranted if
subsequent interventions for early AMD safely avoid vision loss.

 Information on demographic characteristics, medical co-
morbidities, smoking status, family history of AMD, and the
use of Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation
nutritional supplements was obtained through participant
interview. General cognitive status was assessed using the
Mini-Mental State Examination.14 Visual acuity, pseudopha-
kia status, the date of the dilated comprehensive eye exami-
nation, and whether the primary eye care physician was an
ophthalmologistoroptometristwereabstractedfromthemedi-
cal record. Logistic regression accounting for clustering of eyes
within patients using generalized estimating equations was
used to compare characteristics between those with and with-
out undiagnosed AMD and to generate crude and age-
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs.
Statistical significance was defined as P < .05 (2-tailed).
Results
The sample consisted of 1288 eyes from 644 participants (231
[35.9%] male and 413 [64.1%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.4 [6.1]
years; 611 white [94.9%]) seen by 31 primary eye care ophthal-
mologists or optometrists. Table 1 gives the demographic char-
acteristics of the participants. Most participants were aged in
their 60s (380 [59.0%]) or 70s (226 [35.1%]), with 38 (5.9%) of
the sample in their 80s. Participants were recruited from 31 eye
care physicians (17 ophthalmologists, 14 optometrists).
Therewere968eyes(75.2%)withnoAMDaccordingtothe
CARMS system in agreement with their medical record; 320
eyes (24.8%) had AMD based on the CARMS system even
though there was no AMD diagnosis in the medical record
(Table 2). The AMD stage for these 320 eyes was as follows: 220
(68.8%)hadearlyAMD,99(30.9%)hadintermediateAMD,and
1 (0.3%) had GA. For these undiagnosed AMD eyes, Table 3 lists
the types and number of macular characteristics indicative of
AMD noted during fundus photograph grading. Approxi-
mately three-fourths of the 320 undiagnosed eyes had 10 or
more small drusen (249 [77.8%]) and/or intermediate drusen
(250 [78.1%]), with 96 (30.0%) of undiagnosed eyes having
large drusen. Older adults were more likely to have small, in-
termediate, and large drusen than younger adults. Hyperpig-
mentation (32 eyes [10.0%]) and hypopigmentation (43 eyes
[13.4%]) were less commonly represented. Older adults were
also more likely to have hyperpigmentation than younger age
groups. No eyes had serous retinal pigment epithelial detach-
ment, choroidal neovascular membrane, or disciform scar.

 Eyes more likely to be undiagnosed for AMD in the medi-
cal record were from older persons, men, those with less than
a high school education, those with worse visual acuity, those
who were pseudophakic, or those who had hypertension
(Table 2). Undiagnosed AMD eyes were slightly more com-
moninpersonswithbettermentalstatus(Table2).Othermedi-

the last dilated eye examination was not different between
those with and without undiagnosed AMD. The prevalence of
undiagnosed AMD was not different for ophthalmologists and
optometrists. The number of eyes in patients using AREDS nu-
tritional supplements was the same regardless of whether the
eyes were in normal macular health (21 [2.2%]) or had AMD
that was undiagnosed (7 [2.2%]).
After adjusting for age, men had significantly higher odds
of having undiagnosed AMD than women (age-adjusted OR,
1.39; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91) (Table 4). Compared with those with
some college or more, those with less than a high school edu-

Discussion
Age-relatedmaculardegenerationrepresentsasignificantpub-
lic health concern given its high prevalence in the older adult
population and its threat to central vision. This study sug-
gests that AMD is sometimes not diagnosed in older adults re-
ceiving a dilated comprehensive eye examination in primary
eye care despite its presence. We found that 25% of eyes with
no diagnosis of AMD in the medical record or notations about
AMD characteristics in the fundus examination actually had
AMD according to a clinical classification staging system.
Furthermore, approximately 30% of those undiagnosed eyes
had large drusen, indicating these patients would have been
candidates for therapeutic intervention with nutritional
supplements15; however, only 3 (3.0%) of 99 eyes with inter-
mediate AMD were from persons taking AREDS formulation
nutritional supplements.
It is important to consider factors that could be contrib-
uting to the absence of an AMD diagnosis. The most common
AMD funduscopic characteristics that were not noted in the
medical record but were present were drusen, with 84.4% of
undiagnosed eyes having intermediate or large lesions. Dru-
sen are small targets to visually discern in a fundus examina-
tion and often appear sparsely or even in isolation in earlier
stagesofAMD,makingvisualdetectionchallengingduringbrief
inspection. In contrast, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmen-
tation, which present as more spatially distributed patterns,
were less commonly present in undiagnosed eyes. In our cur-
rent era of emphasizing improved efficiency of eye care yet
maintaining high quality, it is critical that sufficient attention
be devoted to the dilated fundus examination during the com-
prehensive eye examination for older adults so that treatable
disease, such as AMD, is not overlooked. Another factor that
could impede detection of AMD lesions is the presence of cata-
ract, which could hamper visualization of the fundus even
when cataract is in its early stages. However, the prevalence
of AMD for undiagnosed eyes was similar for phakic and pseu-
dophakic eyes in our sample, suggesting that a poor view of
the fundus was not a contributing factor to nondiagnosis.
Age-related macular degeneration was more likely to be
present yet undiagnosed in older eyes. Older eyes were also
more likely to have drusen of all sizes. It is widely known
that risk of AMD increases with increasing age in late adult-
hood; thus, it is puzzling that primary eye care physicians
would be less likely to identify AMD in older eyes. Instead,
one would surmise that a patient’
s advanced age would lead
primary eye care physicians to more closely scrutinize the
fundus for signs of AMD. Men were more likely to have undi-
agnosed AMD. This finding is the opposite of a large body of
research on sex-related health disparities in chronic diseases
of aging that indicates that women are more likely to have
underdiagnosed conditions (eg, heart disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease16-19). Persons with less than a
high school education were more likely to have undiagnosed
conditions even though AMD was present. This finding is
reminiscent of a study20 that found that educational attain-
ment is closely tied to health.
We found that ophthalmologists and optometrists work-
ing in primary eye care were equally likely to miss a diagnosis
of AMD. This finding suggests that both types of physicians
could benefit from better training in identifying AMD in the
dilated fundus examination. Ultimately, given the rapid ad-
vancements in retinal imaging technologies, AMD underdiag-
nosis could potentially dissipate if affordable yet high-
quality retinal imaging modalities are implemented in primary
eye care settings, an issue worthy of further investigation.
A common approach to identifying eyes as normal con-
trol eyes in studies on AMD is to recruit patients whose di-
lated eye examinations by primary eye care physicians do not
reveal diagnoses or impressions of AMD. Our study suggests
that this approach is likely to be problematic because all the
eyes in this study had such a designation by the primary eye
care physician. Our results suggest that many of these so-
called normal control eyes will actually have early or interme-
diate AMD. A more objective and rigorous approach in defin-

 ing normality (ie, the absence of AMD) in AMD studies is the
use of fundus photography and standard and accepted AMD
classification systems used by trained and masked graders.
Clear case definitions of the absence of AMD will also facili-
tate comparison across studies.21
In using fundus grading systems such as the CARMS in
AMDresearchwhendistinctionsneedtobemadebetweennor-
mal macular health and AMD presence, a cut point must be se-
lected to create a case definition of normality beyond which
the eye is considered to have AMD. Setting a cut point is some-
what arbitrary, for example, in terms of drusen number and
size. In the present study, stage 1 of the CARMS was defined
as normal macular health; a strong rationale for adopting this
definition was that stage 1 specifies no or minimal presence
of small drusen and no pigmentary changes. Moving the cut
point of normality to stage 2, which signifies the presence of
pigmentary changes, more small drusen, and the presence of
fewer than 15 intermediate drusen, would correspondingly
reduce the percentage of eyes that were undiagnosed. How-
ever, defining eyes as normal only when they have no dru-
sen, a stricter definition, would increase the undiagnosed rate.
Thus, readers need to be aware of the subtleties in definitions
of normality and disease when interpreting and comparing
studies on underdiagnosis.

 namely, advanced age and male sex. Limitations should also
be acknowledged. Although the study focused on the preva-
lence of undiagnosed AMD among those whose primary eye
care physicians indicated they did not have AMD, the study
design allowed us to examine the converse: the prevalence of
AMD among those who have been diagnosed with AMD in
primary eye care but do not have it. The time that elapsed be-

lar degeneration may not have been present on the date of the
eye examination but may have developed in the ensuing
months. However, the prevalence of nondiagnosis was highly
similar regardless of how much time elapsed between eye ex-
aminationandphotography.Theresultsofthisstudyarebased
on the primary eye care physicians who referred patients to
ALSTAR; the extent to which these findings generalize to other
eye care physicians whose patient case mix may be different
remains to be determined.
Conclusions
This study suggests that underdiagnosis of AMD is not
uncommon in primary eye care. One of 4 eyes studied was
not diagnosed with AMD in a dilated fundus examination
performed by primary care ophthalmologists and optom-
etrists despite these eyes having macular characteristics
indicative of AMD. This finding is concerning because
30.0% of eyes had drusen characteristics consistent with
intermediate AMD, which is treatable with nutritional
supplementation. The reasons underlying AMD underdiag-
nosis in primary eye care remain unclear. As treatments for
the earliest stages of AMD are developed in the coming
years, correct identification of AMD in primary eye care will
be critical for routing patients to treatment as soon as pos-
sible so that the disease can be treated in its earliest phases
and central vision loss avoided.
