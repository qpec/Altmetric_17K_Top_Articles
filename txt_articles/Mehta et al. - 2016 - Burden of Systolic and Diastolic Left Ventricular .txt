Background—Population-based estimates of cardiac dysfunction and clinical heart failure (HF) remain undefined among 
Hispanics/Latino adults.
Methods and Results—Participants of Hispanic/Latino origin across the United States aged 45 to 74 years were enrolled into 
the Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (ECHO-SOL) and underwent a comprehensive echocardiography examination 
to define left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Clinical HF was 
defined according to self-report, and those with cardiac dysfunction but without clinical HF were characterized as having 
subclinical or unrecognized cardiac dysfunction. Of 1818 ECHO-SOL participants (mean age 56.4 years; 42.6% male), 
49.7% had LVSD or LVDD or both. LVSD prevalence was 3.6%, whereas LVDD was detected in 50.3%. Participants 
with LVSD were more likely to be males and current smokers (all P<0.05). Female sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
higher body mass index, and renal dysfunction were more common among those with LVDD (all P<0.05). In age–sex 
adjusted models, individuals of Central American and Cuban backgrounds were almost 2-fold more likely to have LVDD 
compared with those of Mexican backgrounds. Prevalence of clinical HF with LVSD (HF with reduced EF) was 7.3%; 
prevalence of clinical HF with LVDD (HF with preserved EF) was 3.6%. 96.1% of the cardiac dysfunction seen was 
subclinical or unrecognized. Compared with those with clinical cardiac dysfunction, prevalent coronary heart disease 
was the only factor independently associated with subclinical or unrecognized cardiac dysfunction (odds ratio: 0.1; 95% 
confidence interval: 0.1–0.4).
Conclusions—Among Hispanics/Latinos, most cardiac dysfunction is subclinical or unrecognized, with a high prevalence 
of diastolic dysfunction. This identifies a high-risk population for the development of clinical HF.  (Circ Heart Fail.

higher rates of diabetes mellitus (both diagnosed and undiag-
nosed),8,9 obesity,6 and hypertension10; (2) Hispanics/Latinos 
have an almost 2-fold higher prevalence of structural heart 
disease (stage B HF) with high rates of left ventricular (LV) 
hypertrophy and abnormal LV geometry.11 A high prevalence 
of stage A and stage B HF predisposes to higher rates of car-
diac dysfunction.12,13 (3) Hispanics/Latinos are unfavorably 
affected by health disparities, such as undertreated diabetes 
mellitus14 and hypertension.10 Furthermore, the Hispanic/
Latino population >65 years of age is expected to grow 328% 
between 2000 and 2030.6 As the Hispanic/Latino population 
ages, it is likely that an epidemic of cardiac dysfunction and 
clinical HF among Hispanics/Latinos will emerge.15
Because of under-representation in prior community-
based HF cohorts, few studies have highlighted the prevalence 
of cardiac dysfunction among Hispanics/Latinos. Our objec-
tive was to establish the prevalence of the 2 components of 
cardiac dysfunction—LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and 
LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD)—as well as self-reported 
clinical HF, in a large representative community-based cohort 
of US Hispanic/Latino adults.
Methods
The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/
SOL) is a prospective, population-based study of the prevalence of 
multiple health conditions and their risk factors among 16 415 diverse 
Hispanic/Latino individuals aged 18 to 74 years and residing in 4 
US metropolitan areas, the Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and 
San Diego, CA.16,17 Participants included Hispanics/Latinos who self-
identified as Cuban, Central American, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto 
Rican, and South American heritage. Probability sampling was used 
to ensure a broad representation of the target population and to mini-
mize the various sources of bias that may otherwise enter into the 
cohort selection and recruitment process. Ineligibility criteria for the 
HCHS/SOL included being on active military service, not currently 
living at home, planning to move from the area in the next 6 months, 
unable to complete the study in English or Spanish, or unable to at-
tend the clinic examination.
The Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (ECHO-SOL), an an-
cillary study to the HCHS/SOL, was designed to provide echocar-
diographic parameters characterizing cardiac structure and function 
in a representative HCHS/SOL subsample. ECHO-SOL used a 
stratified random sampling design to assure that ECHO-SOL repre-
sents not only the overall HCHS/SOL population, but also the ma-
jor Hispanic/Latino background group distribution found in HCHS/
SOL. A detailed description of the design, rational, and methods has 
been described elsewhere.18 Across all ECHO-SOL sites, enrollment 
was conducted from October 2011 to June 2014 with participation 
rates averaging ≈80% among eligible participants. The Institutional 
Review Board at the Wake Forest School of Medicine and at each 
study site provided approval and oversight of all study materials and 
activities. All ECHO-SOL participants gave informed consent.
Echocardiographic Measurements
A standardized echocardiography ultrasound examination, includ-
ing M-mode, 2-dimensional, spectral, color flow, and tissue Doppler, 
was performed by experienced Registered Diagnostic Cardiac 
Sonographers at each of the 4 parent study field sites using Philips 
IE-33 or Sonos 7500 scanners interfaced with a standard 2.5- to 
3.5-MHz phased-array probe, according to American Society of 
Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations.19,20
Echocardiograms were analyzed and interpreted centrally at 
Wake Forest School of Medicine (Winston-Salem, NC). All ECHO-
SOL echocardiograms were read by a certified technical reader 
and over-read by a board-certified cardiologist with expertise in 
echocardiography (Dr Rodriguez). Over-reads of echocardiograms 
were performed to confirm the accuracy of key quantitative measure-
ments and to identify clinically important findings.21,22Inter- and in-
trareader reproducibility was assessed and previously reported.18 For 
inter-reader reproducibility, intraclass correlation values ranged from 
0.80 to 0.99 with left atrial volume and LV end-diastolic volumes 
having the highest intraclass correlation values (0.97–0.99). intra-
class correlation values were slightly better from intrareader assess-
ments for all measures.
LVSD was assessed using LV ejection fraction (LVEF) derived 
from volumetric assessments and defined as LVEF <50%. Two-
dimensional imaging of the LV was performed to obtain the best 
possible images of the LV endocardium without foreshortening of 
the LV cavity or echo drop out. Using the apical 4- and 2-chamber 
views, LV end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolicvolumes were de-
rived using biplane method of discs, as per the ASE-recommended 
methodology.20 The modified Simpson’s rule states that the volume of 
a 3-dimensional structure can be determined by dividing the structure 
into a sequence of 2-dimensional slices (or discs) and then summing 
the product of the cross sectional area and thickness of each disc. 
EF was calculated from EDV and end-systolic volume estimates us-
ing the following formula: LVEF=(EDV−end-systolic volume)/EDV. 
LVEF could not be ascertained in 4.9% of the cohort because of im-
age quality.
Echocardiographic assessment of LVDD included (1) pulse-wave 
Doppler performed in the apical 4 chamber view with the sample vol-
ume placed in the mitral valve orifice at the level of the leaflet tips to 
obtain peak early (E) and late (A) diastolic transmitral inflow veloci-
ties; (2) tissue Doppler imaging to acquire mitral early diastolic (e′) 
annular velocities from the apical 4-chamber view. We used the aver-
age of septal and lateral annular velocities; and (3) left atrial volume 
measured in biplane views indexed to body surface area. The grading 
scheme for LVDD was grade I (mild), grade II (moderate), or grade 
III (severe; Figure 1). Our grading algorithm was developed using a 
combination of published ASE and Redfield definitions.19,23 For the 
analysis of LVDD, we excluded participants with unclassifiable or 
indeterminate LVDD (n=32; 1.8%), current pregnancy (n=2; 0.1%), 
EDV indexed to body surface area >97mL/m2 (n=1; 0.05%), atrial 
fibrillation by ECG (n=2; 0.1%), moderate or severe left-sided valvu-
lar disease (n=20; 1.1%), or LVEF <50% or missing (n=149; 8.2%); 
hence, participants classified as having LVDD had isolated LVDD 
and no LVSD. Abnormal isovolumetric relaxation time was defined 
as isovolumetric relaxation time outside of the range of 0.06 to 0.1 s. 
Abnormal LV stroke volume was defined as LV stroke volume <55 
mL, and abnormal E/e′ is defined as value >10.
Clinical Covariates
Methods for HCHS/SOL baseline clinical parameters have been 
previously described.10,14,24 Briefly, trained personnel administered a 
standardized questionnaire assessing participant sociodemographic 
characteristics, such as age, sex. Socioeconomic status was assessed 
using information collected on educational attainment and income. 
Self-report questionnaires were used to assess whether participants 
have ever smoked or were current smokers, as well as whether they 
have ever been diagnosed with HF by a healthcare provider. Coronary 
heart disease (CHD) was defined as history of angina, myocardial 
infarction or revascularization, and ECG evidence of old myocardial 
infarction. Physical activity levels were assessed using the Global 
Physical Activity Questionnaire25 to collect information on physical 
activity participation in 3 settings (work, travel, and leisure). Low, 
medium, and high physical activity categories were defined based 
on type of physical activity and time spent on each specific activity. 
Information on both prescription and over-the-counter medications 
used by participants in the 4 weeks preceding the examination date 
was obtained via scanning of medication package bar code symbols, 
transcription of pill bottle labels, and survey interviews.
Trained technicians measured each participant’s height and 
weight twice and then averaged these 2 measures to calculate body 
mass index (BMI=weight [kg]/height [m2]). Participants with BMI 
of ≥30 kg/m2 are categorized as obese. Medical personnel measured

resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures using a standardized 
protocol. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 
≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg, the partici-
pant’s self-report of a history of hypertension, or if the patients were 
on antihypertensive treatment. Participants were classified as having 
hypercholesterolemia if they were currently using cholesterol-low-
ering medication, had low-density lipoprotein levels ≥160 mg/dL or 
total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was defined 
based on American Diabetes Association definition26 using one or 
more of the following criteria: (1) fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 
(2) oral glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL, (3) self-reported diabe-
tes mellitus, (4) hemoglobin A1C ≥6.5%, or (5) taking anti-diabetic 
medication or insulin. Renal disease was defined as an estimated glo-
merular filtration rate <60 mL/min.
The prevalence of HF was assessed based on self-reported history 
of physician-diagnosed clinical HF. Participants with no HF diagno-
sis but with either diastolic or systolic cardiac dysfunction at echo-
cardiography were considered to have subclinical or unrecognized 
diastolic or systolic dysfunction. This designation does not imply that 
the participant did not have symptoms, only that the participant had 
not sought evaluation or had not had an evaluation that resulted in a 
diagnosis of HF. Participants with a clinical HF history and LVEF 
<50% or >50% were classified as HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) or HF 
with preserved EF (HFpEF), respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Survey methods using sampling weights were used to obtain weight-
ed frequencies of descriptive variables and population estimates of 
cardiac dysfunction prevalence rates, as well as LVSD and LVDD 
estimates in the ECHO-SOL target population. All weights were cali-
brated to the age, sex, and Hispanic/Latino background distributions 
from the 2010 US Census for the 4 study field centers. The corre-
sponding distribution of all baseline sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristics was summarized for the overall population using 
means±standard errors for continuous variables and proportions for 
categorical variables. The prevalence of LVSD, LVDD, and cardiac 
dysfunction was calculated for the overall cohort as well as across 
sex, age strata, and Hispanic/Latino background group.
The association between the prevalence of LVSD, LVDD, and 
cardiac dysfunction with clinical and sociodemographic variables 
was investigated using the Rao-Scott χ2 test for univariate associa-
tions. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed for 
LVSD, LVDD, and cardiac dysfunction as outcomes with inclusion 
of all potential predictor variables to determine independent asso-
ciations. Covariates of interest included age, sex, BMI, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, renal disease, prevalent 
coronary heart disease, physical activity, current tobacco use, current 
alcohol use, educational level, income level, health insurance status, 
and study site.
Prevalence estimates of subclinical or unrecognized LVSD, 
LVDD, and cardiac dysfunction were determined. Logistic regres-
sion models assessed the association of different variables with the 
presence of subclinical or unrecognized LVSD, LVDD, and cardiac 
dysfunction. Sequential logistic regression models (unadjusted; age–
sex adjusted; then fully adjusted models) assessed the association of 
Hispanic/Latino background group as a predictor of LVSD, LVDD, 
and cardiac dysfunction as separate outcomes after adjustment for all 
covariates of interest listed earlier. Additional exploratory analysis as-
sessed age-adjusted prevalence estimates of LVSD, LVDD, and car-
diac dysfunction by center and Hispanic/Latino background groups. 
Sampling weights and survey statistics were used for all analyses. 
All analyses were weighted to adjust for sampling probability and 
nonresponse. All analyses were conducted using SAS v. 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Seventy-nine percent of the ECHO-SOL study population was 
under age 65, and predominantly 57.4% were female (Table 1). 
Almost half were obese. Half of the study participants had 
hypertension, and over two thirds had either pre-diabetes mel-
litus or diabetes mellitus. Renal disease by estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate was present in 6.4%, whereas prevalent CHD 
was reported in 18%. More than two thirds reported low lev-
els of physical activity. Almost one fifth of participants were 
current smokers, and over 40% were current drinkers. Over 
a third reported having less than high school education, and 
over half reported annual incomes below $20 000 (Table 1). 
Only 6.9% of the participants had abnormal left atrial volume 
index. With regard to functional indices, e/e′ and LV stroke 
volume were abnormal in almost half of the cohort, whereas 
isovolumetric relaxation time was abnormal in almost a third 
of participants.
Systolic Dysfunction
LVEF was obtained in ≈95% of participants with a mean 
LVEF of 59.8% (±0.2). LVEF was essentially the same among 
participants with a history of clinical HF versus those without

(59.8% versus 59.0%, respectively). LVSD was prevalent in 
60 (3.6%) cohort members. Prevalence of LVSD was signifi-
cantly higher among men compared with women across all 
age groups and did not increase significantly with older age 
(Table 2). In multivariable models, female sex and current 
tobacco smoking were the only factors independently asso-
ciated with LVSD. LVSD did not vary by age, BMI, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, renal disease, 
prevalent heart disease, physical activity, alcohol use, educa-
tional level, income, or health insurance status (Table 3).
Diastolic Dysfunction
Diastolic function was classified as abnormal in 817 (50.3%) 
participants; 16.1% had mild (grade I), 32.7% had moderate 
(grade II), and 1.5% had severe (grade III) LVDD (Table 1). 
The prevalence of LVDD increased significantly with age and 
was significantly higher in women versus men. Sex differences 
persisted across age groups, except in those 65+ years of age, 
LVDD prevalence became similar among men and women 
(Table 2). In fully adjusted models, age, male sex, BMI, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease were indepen-
dently associated with the presence of LVDD (Table 3).
Cardiac Dysfunction (LVSD and LVDD)
Because some participants with LVSD also had LVDD, there 
is overlap seen within participants classified as having LVSD, 
LVDD, and cardiac dysfunction (Figure 2A). Among our com-
munity cohort of Hispanics/Latinos, the prevalence of cardiac 
dysfunction was high, with 49.7% of participants having either 
LVSD or LVDD. The prevalence of cardiac dysfunction was 
somewhat higher in women and increased with older age, par-
ticularly among men compared with women (Table 2). Hav-
ing health insurance was associated with less prevalent cardiac 
dysfunction in unadjusted models. Only age, hypertension, 
BMI, and diabetes mellitus were independently associated 
with the presence of cardiac dysfunction (all P<0.05; Table 3).
Subclinical or Unrecognized Cardiac Dysfunction
Self-reported clinical HF prevalence was 4.4% (n=64). Among 
participants with cardiac dysfunction, Figure 2B shows the 
prevalence of clinical and subclinical cardiac dysfunction. 
Even though self-reported clinical HF was more common 
among those with an abnormal LVEF (HFrEF) than those 
with an LVEF >50% (HFpEF; 7.3% versus 3.6%, respec-
tively), the more prevalent clinical HF was HFpEF. Among 
those with self-reported HF, 53 (93.6%) participants had an 
EF >50%. The prevalence of self-reported HF did not sig-
nificantly vary with age, sex, or Hispanic/Latino background 
group (all P>0.19), but did vary by insurance status (P<0.01). 
Of all participants with cardiac dysfunction, 94.7% had sub-
clinical or unrecognized cardiac dysfunction. The proportion 
of subclinical or unrecognized cardiac dysfunction did not dif-
fer when looking at LVSD or LVDD separately (Table 4). Of 
all participants with subclinical or unrecognized cardiac dys-
function, 19.5% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor, 14.2% were on a β-blocker, and 15.6% on diuret-
ics as opposed to 33.5%, 36.9%, and 30.0%, respectively, 
among those with clinical cardiac dysfunction (all P<0.01). In

multivariable models, only having prevalent CHD was inde-
pendently inversely associated (odds ratio: 0.1; confidence 
intervals 0.1–0.3) with having subclinical or unrecognized 
cardiac dysfunction.
Hispanic/Latino Subpopulation and Cardiac 
Dysfunction
Individuals of Mexican background consistently had the low-
est unadjusted prevalence of cardiac dysfunction, whereas 
the prevalence was higher among those of Central Ameri-
can backgrounds (Table 2). Among individuals of Central 
American backgrounds, more prevalent cardiac dysfunction 
was seen among younger age groups (Table 2). These differ-
ences were mostly driven by LVDD. In age-adjusted analy-
sis, only participants of Central American background (odds 
ratio: 2.0; confidence intervals 1.2–3.2) had an increased 
odds of having LVDD compared with those of Mexican 
heritage. Differences among Central Americans persisted on 
multivariable models for LVDD (odds ratio: 1.7; confidence 
intervals 1.0–2.8). In additional models adjusted by study 
site, these differences were no longer significant. However, 
age-adjusted models stratified by site and Hispanic/Latino 
background revealed that LVDD prevalence among partici-
pants of Central American heritage did not significantly vary 
by site (P=0.2).
Discussion
To our knowledge, ECHO-SOL is the largest community-
based cohort to date representing diverse Hispanic/Latino 
groups that has been systematically examined with stan-
dardized echocardiography. No prior study has evalu-
ated the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction, both systolic 
and diastolic, as well as the presence of subclinical or 
unrecognized cardiac dysfunction, in a community-based 
cohort of Hispanic/Latino adults representative of the 6 
major Hispanic/Latino background groups. Previous popu-
lation-based studies of US Hispanics/Latinos were smaller, 
single-site, and provided only limited information on 
LVSD, LVDD, and clinical HF. In ECHO-SOL, the preva-
lence of HF risk factors was high. Half of the participants 
were obese or hypertensive and two thirds being diabetic or 
prediabetic. Cardiac dysfunction was present in almost half 
of the cohort and due predominantly to diastolic dysfunc-
tion. This is important given the epidemic of HFpEF, which 
is projected to increase in the United States.27,28 Moreover, 
of all cardiac dysfunction, upwards of 95% was unrec-
ognized or subclinical. Finally, there was a suggestion 
of differentially higher LVDD prevalence among certain 
Hispanic/Latino groups, in particular Central Americans, 
which may be more at risk.
Systolic Dysfunction and Diastolic Dysfunction
Prevalence of LVDD in the ECHO-SOL cohort was higher 
compared with previously published data for European 
cohorts: 11%29; 37%.30 In a community-based sample of 2042 
non-Hispanic white residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, 
Redfield et al31 reported an LVDD prevalence of 28%, clini-
cal HF prevalence of 2.2%, and LVSD prevalence of 6% (EF 
≤50%). In comparison, although the Olmstead cohort had 
study design similar to ECHO-SOL and also included partici-
pants aged ≥45 years, ECHO-SOL comprises exclusively of 
Hispanics/Latinos with greater proportion of women, higher 
mean BMI (28.4 versus 30.1), diabetes mellitus prevalence 
(4.5% versus 28.4%), and current tobacco use (17.6% versus 
8.9%). Importantly, longitudinal follow-up of the Olmstead 
cohort showed that LVDD prevalence and severity worsened

over 4 years, predicting the occurrence of incident clinical HF.4 
This finding has notable implications given the higher preva-
lence of LVDD in ECHO-SOL compared with the Olmstead 
County. Interestingly, the prevalence of LVSD was higher in 
the Olmstead cohort, perhaps reflecting the fact that LVDD and 
possibly HFpEF are more significant problems in Hispanics/
Latinos compared with whites. This would be consistent with 
the findings by Russo et al32 who reported significantly worse 
echocardiographic diastolic dysfunction characteristics among 
Hispanics/Latinos compared to non-Hispanic whites mostly 
attributable to a worse cardiovascular risk factor profile.
A study by Halley et al33 using retrospective analysis of a 
hospital database of >36 000 residents from Cleveland, Ohio, 
reported prevalence of LVDD was 65.2% in patients referred 
for an outpatient cardiac echocardiogram. The high preva-
lence was expected given the higher probability for cardiac 
abnormalities in a population referred for testing by a physi-
cian. Thus, the high prevalence of LVDD in the ECHO-SOL 
community–based study population is surprising. Castro et 
al34 reported on LVDD prevalence among Hispanics/Latinos in 
southwest Texas by doing a retrospective analysis of 166 con-
secutive echocardiogram from a hospital database. One hun-
dred and twenty-nine of 166 (77.8%) were Hispanics/Latinos; 
87 of 129 (67.4%) has some degree of LVDD. Although the 
LVDD prevalence in ECHO-SOL cohort was similar to the 
data published by Castro et al, the southwest Texas cohort was 
older, with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hyper-
tension as would be expected from hospitalized patients.
Clinical Heart Failure Among Hispanic/Latino 
Adults
Our analysis suggests that the prevalence of self-reported 
clinical HF in the Hispanic/Latino community is relatively 
low, despite the high prevalence of stage A and stage B HF. 
The majority of HF in our Hispanic/Latino study population 
seems to be stage B HF, which includes asymptomatic LVSD 
or asymptomatic LVDD. In predominantly non-Hispanic, 
white cohorts, the prevalence of asymptomatic LVSD and 
LVDD is estimated at 3% to 6%35 and 26%,36 respectively. 
Prior estimates of projected clinical HF prevalence in US His-
panics/Latinos have been low.37 However, these estimates are 
only based on Hispanics of one particular background group. 
When one examines a representative sample of all Hispanics/
Latinos, such as in our study, the projected HF prevalence, 
particularly for future HFpEF, appears high. Furthermore, 
only approximately one third of Hispanics/Latinos with clini-
cal cardiac dysfunction were on an angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor, β-blocker, or diuretic. This prevalence of 
cardiac medication use among those with clinical cardiac dys-
function is lower compared with previous publications38 and is 
even lower among ECHO-SOL participants with stage A and 
stage B HF. Because antecedent cardiac dysfunction (systolic 
or diastolic) is associated with increased incidence of clinical 
HF,4,27,39 the increased prevalence of subclinical or unrecog-
nized functional abnormalities (stage B HF) coupled with a 
high burden of HF risk factors (stage A HF) makes the ECHO-
SOL study population highly vulnerable to progression to

clinically overt HF (stage C or stage D HF). Income, educa-
tional level or insurance status were not significantly associ-
ated with subclinical or unrecognized cardiac dysfunction, 
suggesting that the reasons for the high presence of stage B 
HF among Hispanics/Latinos goes beyond these variables and 
deserves further attention.
The available information regarding HF in Hispanics/
Latinos from community-based cohorts is insufficient and 
conflicting. For example, national statistics from National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey shows HF preva-
lence as being the lowest in Hispanics/Latinos, followed by 
non-Hispanic Whites.40 However, others reported that HF inci-
dence was greater in Hispanics/Latinos than in non-Hispanic 
Whites.41 Vivo et al42 reported on the prevalence of HFrEF 
(54%) and HFpEF (46%) in a registry of 6117 Hispanic/Latino 
patients hospitalized with HF. Hospitalized Hispanics/Latinos 
were younger, more obese, and more likely to have diabetes 
mellitus and hypertension compared with non-Hispanics/
Latinos in the registry. Despite these differences, compared 
with non-Hispanic Whites, the prevalence of HFpEF (46% 
versus 55%) was lower and the prevalence of HFrEF was 
higher (54% versus 45%) in these Hispanic/Latino patients.42 
Our study found that the prevalence of subclinical or unrec-
ognized cardiac dysfunction was lower among those with 
clinical CHD. Thus, having the comorbid condition of clinical 
CHD increases the likelihood of having received attention of 
the healthcare system so that their cardiac dysfunction is less 
likely to be subclinical or unrecognized.
Hispanic/Latino Subpopulation Differences
We observed a differential prevalence of LVDD by Hispanic/
Latino subpopulation where participants of Central Ameri-
can background had an almost 2-fold chance having LVDD 
compared with those of Mexican background. In additional

models adjusted by site, these differences were no longer sig-
nificant. However, age-adjusted analysis stratified by site and 
Hispanic/Latino background group revealed that LVDD prev-
alence among Central Americans did not vary by site. Because 
the correlation between study site and Hispanic/Latino back-
ground group in ECHO-SOL is high, it becomes impossible 
to distinguish their effects separately. Although it is notable 
in our study that individuals of Central American background 
in Chicago and the Bronx were similar with respect to LVDD 
prevalence, it doesn’t help clearly distinguish whether the 
differentially higher LVDD prevalence in Central American 
background is because of site factors (such as environmental 
differences) or to intrinsic Hispanic/Latino background group 
differences (such as genetic ancestry).
Comparisons With Other Populations in the 
Context of the Hispanic Paradox
Hispanics in ECHO-SOL have higher prevalence of HF risk 
factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity) com-
pared with non-Hispanic whites in the Multiethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA), despite being younger.43 Non-His-
panic blacks in the MESA and the Atherosclerosis Risk In 
Communities (ARIC) study cohorts had similar prevalence 
of these risk factors when compared with ECHO-SOL His-
panics.43,44 Prevalence of asymptomatic LVSD in MESA was 
1.7% among Whites, 2.7% among Non-Hispanic blacks, and 
1.6% among Hispanics45; however, MESA excluded prevalent 
CHD and clinical HF which were included in ECHO-SOL. 
When compared with non-Hispanic white cohorts of similar 
age, prevalence of LVSD in ECHO-SOL (3.6%) is lower than 
that in Framingham (5%),46 Heart of England Screening study 
(5.3%),47 and Mayo cohorts (6%),31 despite a higher level of 
HF risk factors among ECHO-SOL participants.
Using only transmitral Doppler in defining LVDD, the 
prevalence of asymptomatic LVDD was 25% among Non-
Hispanic blacks in ARIC.48 ECHO-SOL Hispanics have a 
similarly high prevalence of HF risk factors as non-Hispanic 
blacks in ARIC, but a much higher prevalence of asymptom-
atic LVDD (47.1%). Prevalence of LVDD in population-based, 
non-Hispanic white cohorts, mean age was 53 to 65 years, has 
varied from 11% to 35%.4,29,30,36 In comparison, ECHO-SOL 
LVDD prevalence is higher, with a higher prevalence of HF 
risk factors, compared to non-Hispanic whites despite ECHO-
SOL participants being younger or of similar age as seen in 
these published cohorts. This implies more HF risk among 
ECHO-SOL Hispanics despite a younger or similar age.
The Hispanic Paradox states that despite a high preva-
lence of risk factors, Hispanics seem to have a more favorable 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality experience than non-
Hispanic whites.49 Despite the increased prevalence of HF 
risk factors, ECHO-SOL Hispanics have a similar or lower 
prevalence of LVSD as non-Hispanic whites. These findings 
provide support for the Hispanic Paradox as it applies to the 
LVSD. However, LVDD prevalence is higher in ECHO-SOL 
with a higher prevalence of HF risk factors, despite a younger 
or similar age, which does not support the Hispanic paradox. 
The higher LVDD prevalence can be partly attributed to our 
comprehensive criteria for defining LVDD, which may be 
more sensitive than prior studies. Predominantly, this speaks 
to the complexity of the Hispanic Paradox and how it has been 
understudied in the context of cardiac dysfunction and HF.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. Our measures of LVDD are 
comprehensive, do not rely on a single component, and are 
inclusive of tissue Doppler assessment and left atrial volume 
index measurements as per the ASE and Redfield criteria.19,31 
Previous LVDD criteria based solely on diastolic relaxation 
velocity has its own limitations.50 ASE has recommended 
that the best assessment of LVDD is when a combination of 
several diastology components are used.19 Our study tries to 
move closer to an ideal assessment by incorporating various 
components into our LVDD algorithm (Figure 1). A related 
strength is that LVDD could not be classified in <2% of our 
sample. This is a testament to our LVDD algorithm and the 
quality of our measures. We used modified Simpson’s biplane 
method, the ASE-recommended method for calculating 
LVEF,20 in all ECHO-SOL participants, whereas many prior

studies calculated LVEF using the Teichholz method, an older 
M-mode method based on fractional shortening which is no 
longer recommended.
Some study limitations do exist. ECHO-SOL, by design, 
recruited specific Hispanic/Latino background groups by 
site because US Hispanic/Latino background groups have 
differential geographic immigration patterns. Second, 
echocardiographic studies were not performed simultane-
ously with other HCHS-SOL data. To alleviate this, all 
efforts were made to keep the time interval between base-
line HCHS-SOL measurements and ECHO-SOL assess-
ments as negligible as possible; additionally, key covariates 
(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, self-reported HF) were 
updated using the most recent HCHS-SOL annual follow-
up assessment. Some participants could have had a reduced 
LVEF when they first self-reported HF, and the LVEF may 
have recovered by the time the echocardiography exami-
nation was performed, possibly limiting our HFpEF and 
HFrEF estimates. We obtained only the list of medications 
but not the actual indication for those medications. Various 
schemes have been used to define LVDD in prior studies, 
which make pure comparisons difficult. Finally, the diag-
nosis of clinical HF may be inaccurate because it is based 
on self-report and has not been validated by review of med-
ical records.
Conclusions
The prevalence of cardiac dysfunction, especially LVDD, is 
high among the Hispanics/Latinos population. Even though 
the prevalence of HFpEF is higher than HFrEF among 
Hispanics/Latinos, overall cardiac dysfunction (LVDD or 
LVSD) is primarily subclinical or unrecognized. Our study 
substantiates the need for aggressive risk factor modification 
in this at-risk population as recommended in the guidelines 
to prevent further cardiac remodeling and progression to 
clinical HF.51

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
The Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (ECHO-SOL) is the largest study to date of U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults. This arti-
cle presents the left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure (HF) data from this cohort. Our key findings indicate that 
the prevalence of HF risk factors (stage A HF) and LV diastolic dysfunction is high among Hispanics/Latinos. Prevalence of 
clinical HF is low, and most of the cardiac dysfunction is subclinical or unrecognized (stage B HF). Despite the increased 
prevalence of HF risk factors, ECHO-SOL Hispanics have a similar or lower prevalence of LV systolic dysfunction as non-
Hispanic whites. These findings provide support for the Hispanic Paradox because it applies to the LV systolic dysfunction. 
However, LV diastolic dysfunction prevalence is higher in ECHO-SOL, with a higher prevalence of HF risk factors, despite 
a younger or similar age, which does not support the Hispanic Paradox. The findings from our study raise awareness of the 
increased prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction and subclinical HF among Hispanics/Latinos. Our study substantiates the 
need for aggressive risk factor modification in this at-risk population.
