Abstract
Most currently available antidepressants target monoamine neurotransmitter function. However, a 
purely neurotransmitter-based explanation for antidepressant drug action is challenged by the 
delayed clinical onset of most agents and the need to explain how neurochemical changes reverse 
the many different symptoms of depression. Novel approaches to understanding of antidepressant 
drug action include a focus on early changes in emotional and social processing and the role of 
neural plasticity. In this Review, we discuss the ways in which these two different theories reflect 
different or complementary approaches, and how they might be integrated to offer novel solutions 
for people with depression. We consider the predictions made by these mechanistic approaches for 
the stratification and development of new therapeutics for depression, and the next steps that need 
to be made to facilitate this translation of science to the clinic.
Introduction
The first clinically useful antidepressant medications were discovered serendipitously about 
60 years ago.1 Subsequently, laboratory studies revealed that these drugs increased synaptic 
concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine,2 and this action was hypothesised to 
underpin their antidepressant action. Decades later, a range of antidepressant drugs have 
been developed that, with few exceptions, act to enhance monoamine neurotransmission.
It was realised fairly early that the onset of neurochemical and therapeutic effects of 
antidepressants had very different time scales, with potentiation of monoamine function 
occurring within hours of drug administration and clinical improvement often taking days or 
weeks.3 This finding led researchers to challenge the central role for acute monoamine 
potentiation in the mechanism of antidepressant action. Recent approaches, therefore, have 
sought to target more directly the neurobiological processes that might underlie this delay,

 with the hope of finding rapid-acting antidepressant agents. In this Review, we summarise 
contemporary approaches to understanding of the delayed clinical effects of antidepressant 
drug action, and consider how this information can be used to refine future treatments.
Current pharmacological treatment approaches
Following the discovery of their antidepressant effect, the tricyclic antidepressants rapidly 
became the most widely used agents for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of tricyclic 
antidepressants such as amitriptyline—particularly in severe melancholic depression—has 
never been surpassed, but modern agents have been developed to be more selective 
inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and, in particular, to reduce the 
anticholinergic and membrane stabilising (so-called quinidine-like) effects that make 
tricyclic antidepressants poorly tolerated and dangerous in overdose.4
National and international guidelines currently recommend selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) as first-line treatment for most patients with major depression.4,5 Other 
selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors are available—eg, reboxetine, a selective 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Reboxetine, however, seems less efficacious than SSRIs 
in some meta-analyses,6 although these findings could be due to its relatively poor 
tolerance.7 Another agent, bupropion, is an inhibitor of norepinephrine and dopamine 
reuptake, which gives it a more activating profile than SSRIs. Two drugs, venlafaxine and 
duloxetine, are classified as dual serotonin– norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), 
although the efficacy for blockade of norepinephrine reuptake in clinically used doses is 
unclear.8 Clinical guidelines commonly recommend the use of an SNRI in patients who do 
not respond to SSRIs.4,5
More recent developments have led to drugs that block serotonin reuptake while having 
additional effects on a variety of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes. For 
example, vilazodone has partial agonist activity at the 5-HT1A receptor, whereas vortioxetine 
binds to several other 5-HT receptor subtypes (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT1D, 5HT3, and 5-HT7). 
Whether these agents have advantages over SSRI treatment is not fully clear, although 
vilazodone is suggested to produce less sexual dysfunction and vortioxetine to have 
particular benefits in depression-related cognitive impairment.9
Additionally, some antidepressant agents do not act through blockade of norepinephrine and 
serotonin reuptake. The most widely used is mirtazapine, which blocks α2-adrenoceptors on 
norepinephrine cell bodies and terminals, thereby facilitating norepinephrine release. 
Mirtazapine's ability to antagonise 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors could also increase 
norepinephrine and dopamine release in cortical regions.4 A similar antagonist action at 5-
HT2C receptors has been suggested to contribute to the antidepressant action of the 
melatonin agonist agomelatine, although whether agomelatine blocks 5-HT2C receptors in 
people at clinical doses is questionable.10 Overall, however, all currently licensed 
antidepressants are believed to relieve depression by increasing serotonin or norepinephrine 
availability, or both, at least initially.

 Explaining the delayed clinical onset of antidepressant drugs
Neurochemical theories
The disjunction in the timescale of monoamine increases versus clinical changes led 
researchers to study the neuroadaptive changes that evolve in the days and weeks after the 
initiation of antidepressant treatment. The underlying assumption was that neurobiological 
adaptive changes that correlate in time with the onset of the therapeutic response could 
represent a more direct antidepressant target than the initial action of antidepressants to 
block serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
To some extent the adaptive mechanisms identified have gone hand-in-hand with technical 
advances in laboratory science. For example, the development of ligand receptor binding led 
to studies of the effects of antidepressant treatment on monoamine receptor populations. 
Initially, these studies focused on postsynaptic β-adrenoceptors that are downregulated by 
both repeated tricyclic antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibitor treatment.11 
However, the notion that decreasing β-adrenoceptor activity—with, for example, a β-adreno-
ceptor antagonist—could be a useful antidepressant strategy was implausible, and served as 
a warning that neuroadaptive changes might represent homoeostatic mechanisms by which 
the brain of a healthy animal attempts to regulate monoamine neurotransmission in the 
presence of a monoamine enhancing drug.12
As the era of SSRI treatment developed, attention shifted to the role of 5-HT1A 
autoreceptors that act normally to inhibit serotonin release from nerve terminals. Repeated 
SSRI treatment decreases the functional sensitivity of 5-HT1A autoreceptors both in animals 
and human beings. This finding gave rise to the suggestion that the delay in therapeutic 
onset of action of SSRIs might represent the time needed for autoreceptor desensitisation, 
which results in greater serotonin availability in the synapse.13 It would therefore be 
expected that combining an SSRI with drugs that selectively block 5-HT1A autoreceptors 
should speed the onset of therapeutic effect of SSRIs but this approach has not, thus far, 
proved clinically useful.14
Neuroplasticity theories
With the elucidation of molecular and cellular path ways that regulate neuronal function, 
research has progressed beyond monoamine neurotransmitter receptors to focus on 
intracellular signalling cascades, gene expression, and protein translation as central for 
antidepressant drug action. A major theme of this work has been to explore mechanisms of 
neuroplasticity—a fundamental process that underlies learning and memory, but also the 
ability of neuronal systems to incorporate and adapt to environmental stimuli and then to 
make appropriate adaptive responses to future related stimuli. Complex mechanisms mediate 
neuroplasticity, including regulation of presynaptic mechanisms of neurotransmitter release, 
postsynaptic Ca2+ signalling, trafficking of glutamate AMPA receptor subunits, and 
increased number and function of synapses.15 Evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity 
mechanisms are affected by chronic stress, and that antidepressant treatments oppose or 
reverse these effects.

 Stress and depression: intracellular and morphological changes—Chronic 
stress substantially alters neuronal circuits in the brain, including disruption of intracellular 
signalling and the number and function of synapses. Findings from rodent studies show 
synaptic loss in cortical and limbic areas associated with depression, notably the prefrontal 
cortex and hippocampus—regions that control emotion, mood, and cognition in response to 
chronic physical or psychological stress.16,17 Additionally, evidence suggests that stress 
decreases the formation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus.18 Brain imaging studies 
show that depression is associated with reductions in the volume of the prefrontal cortex and 
hippocampus, suggesting atrophy and disruption of connectivity.19,20 By contrast with the 
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, chronic stress causes hypertrophy of neurons in the 
nucleus accumbens and amygdala,21,22 effects that could contribute to disruption of 
behaviours that are regulated by these regions, including motivation, reward, and emotion.
At the molecular level, chronic stress causes alterations of glutamate, intracellular signalling, 
transcription factors, and gene expression (including epigenetic changes). Evidence suggests 
that stress increases extracellular glutamate, and that this increase could contribute to 
excitotoxic damage.23 There have been extensive studies of brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), a major neurotrophic factor that plays an important role in the formation, 
guidance, and survival of neurons during development but also in synaptic plasticity and 
survival in the adult brain (figure 1). BDNF is decreased by chronic stress in rodents and 
postmortem brains of indviduals with depression.24,25 Mice with a single nucleotide 
polymorphism of BDNF—ie, Val66Met, which blocks the processing, trafficking, and 
release of BDNF—show decreased synapse number in the hippocampus and medial 
prefrontal cortex.26,27 The Met polymorphism is found in approximately 25% of people who 
are white, and has been associated with decreased hippocampal volume and executive 
function and increased susceptibility to depression.28,29
BDNF signalling pathways are also decreased by stress and in post-mortem brains of 
indviduals with depression.25,30 Additionally, the mechanistic mammalian target of 
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is decreased by chronic stress via induction of a 
negative regulator REDD1.31,32 Expression of REDD1 causes depression-like behaviours 
and decreases the medial prefrontal cortex synapse number in rodent models, whereas 
REDD1 null mice are resistant to these effects. REDD1 is also increased in the post-mortem 
prefrontal cortex of indviduals with depression.31 These findings show that disruption of 
BDNF signalling contributes to the synaptic and behavioural deficits of stress, and provide a 
mechanism for how exposure to stress and genetic factors might modify risk for depression.
Chronic administration of typical antidepressants—Chronic, but not short-term 
administration of SSRI or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants can enhance 
synaptic plasticity and block the synaptic deficits caused by stress.25,28,33–35 However, the 
actions of SSRI and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agents on synapse number are subtle 
and delayed, possibly due to the modulatory actions of serotonin and norepinephrine 
neurotransmitter systems (figure 1). The ability of typical antidepressants to increase 
synaptic plasticity has been directly tested in well designed rodent models, showing that 
chronic fluoxetine administration reinstates ocular dominance neuroplasticity even in adult

 rodents and enhances fear extinction training by causing fear circuitry to convert to a more 
immature and plastic state.36,37
BDNF and intracellular signalling—By contrast with stress, chronic antidepressant 
administration, both SSRI and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agents, increases the 
expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (figure 
1).25,30 Moreover, the behavioural actions of typical antidepressants in animal models are 
blocked by deletion of BDNF, and infusion of BDNF into the prefrontal cortex or 
hippocampus is sufficient to produce antidepressant effects.24,25,30 Additionally, fluoxetine-
induced synaptic plasticity in the ocular dominance and fear extinction studies is dependent 
on BDNF, and BDNF infusions are sufficient to produce these effects.36,37 These studies 
show that antidepressant induction of BDNF expression, over the course of several weeks of 
treatment, enhances synaptic plasticity that contributes to behavioural response to these 
agents. Antidepressant treatment also increases downstream signalling, including the cAMP 
and Ca2+ that increase the expression of BDNF.38
If reduction of BDNF in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus plays a causal role in 
vulnerability to depression, then we would expect that BDNF deletion would cause 
depressive behaviours. But this is not the case in rodent models with BDNF gene 
deletion.25,30 This finding could be due to differential effects of BDNF in the mesolimbic 
dopaminergic system, in which BDNF produces depressive-like behaviours in social defeat 
models,22,39 indicating that it is required for plasticity of different circuits—some of which 
could be prodepressive whereas others produce antidepressant actions. Evidence for this 
possibility is supported by studies showing that region-specific deletion of BDNF in the 
hippocampus is sufficient to produce depressive behaviours.40 Mutant mice with BDNF 
deletion are also more vulnerable to depressive behaviours upon exposure to mild stress.28 
Additional signalling pathways and brain regions have been implicated in antidepressant 
drug action.33,41
Cognitive neuropsychological approaches
In parallel to the research reviewed, which focuses on molecular and cellular pathway 
actions, there has been recent interest in understanding of the effects of antidepressant drugs 
on core psychological processes important in depression (figure 2). It is unclear to what 
extent these psychological changes relate to the effects on synaptic plasticity, and there is no 
research directly addressing this question. It is possible that these psychological and synaptic 
plasticity changes describe different levels of analysis rather than competing theories.
Negative affective biases in depression—The incidence of depression is increased 
following a period of life events or stress,42 and individual differences in how negative 
events are experienced, perceived, and recalled can exacerbate these effects. Depression is 
associated with the tendency to perceive social cues as more negative, to preferentially 
attend to aversive information, and to recall negative more than positive information 
concerning oneself.43,44 This style of focusing on and remembering affective and social 
information that is negative, while disregarding positive information, is hypothesised to 
reinforce negative thoughts, feelings, and beliefs seen in depression. Negative affective

 biases during remission are associated with an increased risk of relapse,43 and improved 
positive emotional processing has been found to precede changes in symptoms of 
depression.45 These observations highlight that negative bias might not be just an 
epiphenomenon of low mood but play a role in determining response to everyday social and 
emotional situations, life events and stressors, and the evolution of symptoms of depression 
over time. Recent studies have highlighted negative bias as a target for pharmacological and 
psychological treatments in depression.44,46,47
Reversal of negative affective bias with antidepressant drug administration—
Antidepressant administration increases the relative processing of positive versus negative 
affective information very early on in treatment in both patients who are depressed and 
participants who are healthy.46 For example, a single dose (4 mg) of reboxetine facilitated 
the recognition of happy facial expressions and the recall of positive versus negative self-
referent memory in patients with depression compared with double-blind administration of 
placebo.48 Similarly, single and repeated administration of antidepressants across different 
pharmacological classes has been found to increase the relative recognition of positive over 
negative social cues in a facial expression recognition task in healthy people.46,49 Early 
effects of antidepressants on negative affective bias might act to reduce the influence of this 
key maintaining factor and set the scene for improved symptoms over time.50,51 Early 
changes in affective processing following other treatment types for depression and anxiety 
have been described, including transcranial direct current stimulation,52 negative ion 
treatment,53 and with cognitive behavioural therapy in panic disorder.54 Thus, early effects 
on the way in which information is processed might be important across treatment types.
At a neural level, depression is associated with an increased response in limbic areas of the 
brain (such as the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate) to negative versus positive 
stimuli, important for the detection and response to emotionally salient stimuli. This limbic 
overactivity has been coupled with decreased engagement of areas important for regulation 
and inhibition of such responses, including the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex.47 
Antidepressant treatment reverses this pattern of neural response to affective information in 
patients with depression, and introduces a similar direction of change in healthy people.55 
For example, acute clinical doses of SSRIs decrease amygdala response to negative affective 
faces,56,57 and this effect is also seen after 7 days administration in healthy participants58 
and patients with depression.59 These effects tend to occur in the absence of any changes in 
the symptoms of depression, suggesting that they might be an early mechanism of change 
rather than just a correlate of feeling better during the scan. Nonetheless, these changes in 
affective processing observed early are maintained during long-term treatment. For instance, 
6 weeks of SSRI treatment was associated with reduced responses in the amygdala, anterior 
cingulate, and fusiform face area to negative facial expressions in patients with 
depression.55,60 Likewise, responses to happy faces were enhanced across similar regions 
after 6 weeks of SSRI treatment.55,61
The effects of antidepressants seen in these models after just a single dose highlight that the 
reversal of negative bias might occur, at least in part, before changes in the measures of 
neuroplasticity or neurotrophic factors (such as BDNF) with conventional anti-depressants 
examined in animal models in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Further work is

 therefore needed to examine the timescale of neuroplasticity markers in relation to these 
early changes in non-conscious emotional bias across different mechanisms and neural 
systems.
Prediction of clinical action—If early changes in negative bias are involved in the 
evolution of clinical response over time, we might expect that patients who show the greatest 
resolution of negative bias early in treatment might be more likely to respond to the 
antidepressant drug with continued administration. In line with this hypothesis, early change 
in the perception and neural response to positive facial expressions has been associated with 
subsequent improvement in depression severity.50,51,62 A classification-based approach of 
data from Tranter and colleagues' study50 suggests that if an early change in positive 
processing is not seen with antidepressant treatment, patients have little chance of 
responding to this same treatment later (table 1). A similar effect was seen in older adults in 
which a group of patients with depression who did not show an improvement in the 
recognition of happy faces after 1 week of citalopram treatment also did not respond after 8 
weeks of treatment.51 A recent study found that early response to happy facial expression 
predicted later clinical response to novel candidate treatment for depression (a nociception 
antagonist) but not placebo.63 These results suggest that the effects on emotional bias might 
not be restricted to monoamine antidepressant drug action, and might be applicable to the 
development of novel agents. They also suggest that drug-induced variation in emotional 
processing is a specific treatment effect rather than being a more general mediator of 
placebo response or expectation.
The early change in neural response to emotional information has also been associated with 
later clinical response. In a recent study, Godlewska and colleagues62 found that clinical 
response to escitalopram after 6 weeks of treatment was associated with early change during 
affective processing in the amygdala, thalamus, cingulate, and insula. The responder group 
showed a greater reduction in neural response in these areas during the processing of 
negative versus positive facial expressions, consistent with the hypothesis that these early 
changes are important for the expression of later clinical benefit. These findings, along with 
the studies reviewed, challenge the view that antidepressants do not have clinically relevant 
effects until they are administered over weeks of treatment. Rather these results suggest that 
there are rapid changes in non-conscious mechanisms involved in how stressors, life events, 
and interactions with others are managed, processed, and remembered.
Can these effects help to elucidate the delays in clinical effects of 
antidepressants?—Given that antidepressants have rapid effects on emotional 
processing, why are the clinical effects of drug treatments still delayed? We have argued that 
such non-conscious changes are only apparent to the patient after interaction with the social 
environment—ie, the patient is aware of the products of having a more positive bias (more 
positive feedback) rather than the processing style itself. In line with this argument, 
experimentally inducing a negative affective bias in healthy volunteers does not affect 
subjective state directly but impairs mood response after exposure to a stressor.64 The role of 
negative bias in mood response is shown by a positive correlation between the effects of 
SSRI treatment on negative affective bias and resistance to a negative mood induction in

 healthy people.65 The translation of change in negative bias into clinical response might, 
therefore, involve relearning a range of emotional associations— ie, where ambiguous 
events or cues are perceived more positively while taking antidepressant drug treatment. The 
effect of antidepressants on synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neurogenesis, and learning in 
animal models could help to consolidate early changes in emotional bias and allow these 
effects to have long-lasting influence.
The requirement for changes in negative affective biases and interaction with the external 
social environment might help to explain some of the variance in clinical response to 
antidepressant treatment. For example, patients with treatment-resistant depression might 
have highly entrenched, long-standing negative affective biases that are resistant to change 
or highly adverse social environments that cannot support an improvement in mood even 
with remediation of the negative affective biases. A study from 2014 found that improved 
accuracy of happy facial expression recognition by perceived level of social support is a 
significant predictor of change in depressive symptoms.51 In particular, the increase in 
emotional bias towards positive information was associated only with a therapeutic response 
in patients with a good level of social support. This approach highlights the need for a more 
integrative perspective in depression and antidepressant drug research, for which the psycho-
pharmacology, neurobiology, psychological, and environmental influences are explored 
together. Rose66 suggested that depression should be viewed as arising from more than the 
brain alone, drawing on an understanding of the whole person, in a particular environment, 
and with a shaping role for social experiences and milieu. In a similar way, multiple factors 
need to be considered when understanding antidepressant drug action, its limitations, blocks 
to successful treatment, and methods to facilitate its effects.
Rapid-acting agents for the treatment of depression
Although currently available antidepressants have a delayed clinical onset, a single dose of 
ketamine, a non-competitive open channel NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonist, 
produces rapid antidepressant actions within hours67 and leads to a rapid resolution of 
suicidal ideation. Moreover, many of these studies include patients who have not responded 
to two or more typical antidepressants (eg, SSRI or SNRI agents).
Data from preclinical studies show that a single dose of ketamine produces rapid 
antidepressant-like effects in rodent models and reverses the depressive behaviours caused 
by chronic stress.68–70 The results also show that a single dose of ketamine rapidly increases 
synapse number and function in medial prefrontal cortex neurons, and reverses the synaptic 
deficits caused by chronic stress (figure 1).69,70 The synaptic and behavioural actions of 
ketamine are blocked in BDNF null mice or BDNF Met knock-in mice.27,71 Patients with 
major depressive disorder and carrying the BDNF Met allele show a 50% lower response 
than do Val/Val carriers, identifying a potential biomarker that might be explored as a 
predictor of treatment response to ketamine, although further studies are required to confirm 
this finding.72 Preclinical studies also show that the synaptic and behavioural actions of 
ketamine are dependent on BDNF signalling via the Akt and mTORC1 signalling cascade, 
leading to increased synthesis of synaptic proteins (figure 1).69,70,73 Evidence also suggests 
that other rapid-acting antidepressants act through a similar mechanism.74,75

 Ketamine produces a paradoxical increase in extracellular glutamate in the medial prefrontal 
cortex, and the behavioural actions of ketamine are blocked by pre treatment with a 
glutamate receptor antagonist,28 suggesting that ketamine could result in activity-dependent 
release of BDNF and the rapid synaptogenic response.29,69 Activity-dependent BDNF 
release distinguishes ketamine from typical antidepressants that slowly increase BDNF 
expression, but not BDNF release (figure 1). Increased extracellular glutamate is thought to 
occur via blockade of tonic firing NMDA receptors on GABA neurons, resulting in 
disinhibition and increased glutamate transmission.69,73 Other theories propose that 
ketamine acts via blockade of NMDA receptors on postsynaptic principal neurons in the 
medial prefrontal cortex or hippocampus to increase synaptic function via a homoeostatic 
mechanism.71,73 Studies are being done using approaches for cell-specific knockdown of 
NMDA receptor subunits to address this question.
These findings provide potential molecular mechanisms for rapid-acting antidepressant 
agents, but how can these effects be explained at a psychological level? Neural and 
behavioural changes in emotional processing are also observed rapidly following ketamine 
administration in people,76 although the nature and timing of these effects have not been 
directly compared with conventional antidepressants to identify possible reasons for its 
faster onset of action. However, recent work using a rodent model of negative affective bias 
suggests that although conventional antidepressants affect the acquisition of a positive bias 
they do not affect the retrieval of previously acquired negative memory associations.77 By 
contrast, ketamine did not affect the learning of positive affective information but was able 
to abolish memory for negative associations for which stimuli had been paired with 
psychosocial stress or administration of an anxiogenic drug via effects within the medial 
prefrontal cortex.77 It is therefore possible that although conventional antidepressants change 
only positive processing of incoming information, novel rapid-onset drugs might be able to 
change or reduce memories of already encoded negative information, which would be 
predicted to have faster effects on mood because there is less dependence on the 
environment. The role of glutamate in memory and memory consolidation provides an 
interesting link to this hypothesis.
The antidepressant effect of ketamine can persist for several days but then wanes. Thus far, it 
has not been possible to sustain the therapeutic effect of ketamine with clinically available 
glutamatergic agents, such as riluzole and memantine.78 New forms of ketamine that can be 
administered more continuously, orally, or intranasally are being developed and are in 
clinical trials. The issue will be to assess whether the antidepressant effects of ketamine can 
be sustained without the development of therapeutic tolerance or safety concerns—eg, 
dependence, psychosis, or bladder toxicity. A potentially important development, based on 
animal studies, is the finding that the antidepressant effect of ketamine might depend 
principally on the ability of its active metabolite, hydroxynorketamine, to produce a rapid 
and sustained stimulation of glutamatergic AMPA receptors, although whether efficacious 
concentrations of the metabolite are achieved with the ketamine doses used is 
questionable.79 Additional studies are required to identify the initial target of 
hydroxynorketamine, to confirm that the effects are independent of NMDA receptor 
blockade, and to further characterise its actions in other brain regions, notably the medial 
prefrontal cortex. Nevertheless, hydroxynorketamine could be free of the many safety

 problems associated with ketamine, and studies of its clinical efficacy in patients with 
depression are, therefore, a priority.
The compelling antidepressant effect of ketamine has led to interest in other agents acting on 
the glutamate system, particularly the NMDA receptor. For example, traxoprodil and 
MK-0657 are selective antagonists at the GluN2B subtype of the NMDA receptor, whereas 
lanicemine is a low trapping non-selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor that should 
theoretically be associated with fewer psychotomimetic effects than ketamine. All these 
drugs have shown promise of a rapid antidepressant effect in initial studies but development 
of traxoprodil and lanicemine for major depression was suspended after disappointing 
results in phase 2 trials.80 Another approach has been to develop agents acting at the glycine 
modulatory site of the NMDA receptor such as the partial agonist GLYX-13 (rapastinel), 
which is in phase 3 trials in patients with major depression.81 There are also studies with 
drugs acting at metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) with a variety of possible targets 
and promising preliminary clinical results with the mGlu5 receptor antagonist 
basimglurant.82
Future perspectives
This Review has considered two contemporary approaches to understanding the delay in 
antidepressant drug efficacy in depression focused on neural plasticity and negative affective 
bias. The extent to which these reflect similar, parallel, or dependent processes requires 
further investigation; table 2 summarises predictions made by these different approaches. 
Research in people is limited by the absence of reliable markers of neural plasticity in vivo, 
which makes it difficult to explore the inter dependence of changes in plasticity and bias in 
the same individual. Furthermore, the observation that emotional bias is typically affected 
before changes in plasticity would be expected suggests that these might not be markers of 
exactly the same underlying mechanism. The development of a rodent model of affective 
bias, which shows similar effects of antidepressant agents to human models,83 provides a 
novel opportunity to investigate both cellular and psychological processes in the same 
animal. This rodent model would allow the timescale of specific changes in bias and 
different aspects of plasticity to be related, and test whether blocking the expression of 
intracellular signalling pathways would prevent the induction of positive affective biases. It 
is also conceivable, however, that changes in neuroplasticity are a consequence of alterations 
in emotional processing. That is, in the same way that changes in external environment can 
lead to alterations in plasticity and neurogenesis in animals, it might be that transformations 
in the emotional world might stimulate similar experience-dependent plasticity changes. 
Exploring these relationships in animal models can therefore provide unique hypotheses for 
how we conceptualise and speed up antidepressant drug action (table 2). The effects of these 
two processes would be expected to be mutually synergistic—ie, increased neural plasticity 
might facilitate the relearning of new emotional associations to inner and external 
environmental cues, thereby consolidating and generalising the implicit changes produced 
by initial doses of medication. Characterisation of the neural circuitry and signalling 
pathways that underlie early changes in emotional processing will further inform 
understanding of the relationship with synaptic plasticity.

 Conclusion
Considerable progress has occurred in understanding mechanisms of antidepressant drug 
action in recent years. Work in this area has moved from an exclusive focus on the 
neurochemical theories of antidepressant drug action to a broader understanding of the 
effects of antidepressants on neuroplasticity and emotional and cognitive function. The 
neurotrophic theory has focused on intracellular mechanisms, largely characterised in animal 
models but contextualised in human MRI and post-mortem studies. These effects evolve 
over days to weeks, mirroring the delayed clinical onset of antidepressant drugs. By contrast, 
the neuropsychological theory has moved into the domain of clinical psychology, exploring 
the effects of antidepressants on emotional processes at a neural and cognitive level in 
people but with recent extension to animal models. These effects occur very early, before 
changes in mood, but are related to later clinical change.
The two theories also provide different perspectives on the underlying mechanisms of rapid-
acting agents such as ketamine in the treatment of depression. However, these processes are 
possibly related or might operate synergistically for treatment success. The contrasting 
perspectives on rapid-acting agents (disruption of fixed negative memories vs BDNF 
release) might reflect different levels of analysis explaining the psychological experience as 
opposed to the underlying cellular changes. Both of these approaches offer perspective for 
the future development, screening, and improvement of treatments in depression. A key 
challenge is to elucidate and harness the potential synergistic effects of changes in negative 
bias and plasticity to overcome the widely acknowledged limitations of current treatments.

Table 2
Predictions made by the neuroplasticity and cognitive neuropsychological theories
Neuroplasticity theory
Neuropsychological theory
Target development
Novel agents should target neural plasticity that 
reverses synaptic deficits in prefrontal cortex and 
hippocampus caused by stress
Novel agents should target neural plasticity or 
transmitter systems in amygdala and cortex that control 
emotional processing
Speeding up of antidepressant 
effects
Faster or more direct actions on neural plasticity; 
environmental enrichment to facilitate effects of 
plasticity
Enhance the translation of emotional processing change 
into clinical change by environmental enhancement and 
targeted psychological treatments
Example reasons for non-
response
Insufficient neural architecture to support 
plasticity change; insufficient effect of drug on 
plasticity
Entrenched emotional processing response, which is 
difficult to shift; toxic environment or reduced 
environmental engagement
Prediction of individual drug 
response
Measures of plasticity-induced neurotrophic and 
synaptic markers should predict treatment success
Early change in emotional processing should predict 
later clinical change
Exploration of the relationship 
between the two theories
Restriction of plasticity change should reduce the 
effect of agents on emotional bias in animal 
models
Blockade of the expression of negative bias change 
should reduce the plasticity changes induced by 
antidepressant agents
Combination approaches
Agents that target neural plasticity combined with 
emotional processing change will have effects 
greater than either target in isolation; in particular, 
effects of ketamine will be sustained when 
combined with agents that shift negative biases in 
emotional processing
Agents that target neural plasticity combined with 
emotional processing change will have effects greater 
than either target in isolation; in particular, effects of 
ketamine will be sustained when combined with agents 
that shift negative biases in emotional processing
These predictions do not necessarily represent competing views but rather different perspectives, levels of analysis, and methods that can be 
synergistic or overlapping.
