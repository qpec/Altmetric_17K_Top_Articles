IMPORTANCE Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have gained unprecedented popularity, but
virtually nothing is known about their cardiovascular risks.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that an imbalance of cardiac autonomic tone and increased
systemic oxidative stress and inflammation are detectable in otherwise healthy humans who
habitually use e-cigarettes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional case-control study of habitual
e-cigarette users and nonuser control individuals from 2015 to 2016 at the University of
California, Los Angeles. Otherwise healthy habitual e-cigarette users between the ages of 21
and 45 years meeting study criteria, including no current tobacco cigarette smoking and no
known health problems or prescription medications, were eligible for enrollment. Healthy
volunteers meeting these inclusion criteria who were not e-cigarette users were eligible to be
enrolled as control individuals. A total of 42 participants meeting these criteria were enrolled
in the study including 23 self-identified habitual e-cigarette users and 19 self-identified
non–tobacco cigarette, non–e-cigarette user control participants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Heart rate variability components were analyzed for the
high-frequency component (0.15-0.4 Hz), an indicator of vagal activity, the low-frequency
component (0.04-0.15 Hz), a mixture of both vagal and sympathetic activity, and the ratio of
the low frequency to high frequency, reflecting the cardiac sympathovagal balance. Three
parameters of oxidative stress were measured in plasma: (1) low-density lipoprotein
oxidizability, (2) high-density lipoprotein antioxidant/anti-inflammatory capacity, and (3)
paraoxonase-1 activity.
RESULTS Of the 42 participants, 35% were women, 35% were white, and the mean age was
27.6 years. The high-frequency component was significantly decreased in the e-cigarette
users compared with nonuser control participants (mean [SEM], 46.5 [3.7] nu vs 57.8 [3.6]
nu; P = .04). The low-frequency component (mean [SEM], 52.7 [4.0] nu vs 39.9 [3.8] nu;
P = .03) and the low frequency to high frequency ratio (mean [SEM], 1.37 [0.19] vs 0.85
[0.18]; P = .05) were significantly increased in the e-cigarette users compared with nonuser
control participants, consistent with sympathetic predominance. Low-density lipoprotein
oxidizability, indicative of the susceptibility of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins to
oxidation, was significantly increased in e-cigarette users compared with nonuser control
individuals (mean [SEM], 3801.0 [415.7] U vs 2413.3 [325.0] U; P = .01) consistent with
increased oxidative stress, but differences in high-density antioxidant/anti-inflammatory
capacity and paraoxonase-1 activity were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, habitual e-cigarette use was associated with a
shift in cardiac autonomic balance toward sympathetic predominance and increased
oxidative stress, both associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

E
lectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), first marketed in the
United States in 2006, have gained unprecedented
popularity, especially among young people.1,2
E-cigarettes are not actually cigarettes at all: there is no com-
bustion and they contain no tobacco. Electronic cigarettes are
handheld devices that, when puffed, deliver a heated, aero-
solized mixture of nicotine, flavorings, and a humectant into
the mouth and lungs of the user. Electronic cigarettes have cre-
ated significant controversy in the medical community. They
have been viewed as either a safer alternative to lethal to-
bacco cigarettes or as a gateway to expanding tobacco ciga-
rette addiction.3-5 Unfortunately, scientific data supporting
either side of the controversy are sparse.
More than 50 years ago, based on decades of observational
data in habitual tobacco cigarette users, the Surgeon General
of the United States warned the public about the lethality of
tobacco cigarettes.6 Only years later were the mechanisms by
which tobacco cigarettes led to adverse cardiovascular effects
uncoveredsuchasincreasedoxidativestressandinflammation,
increasedsympatheticactivity,andenhancedplateletactivity.7-9
Although tobacco cigarettes are widely recognized as the most
common preventable cause of cardiovascular disease in the
world,virtuallynothingisknownaboutthecardiovascularrisks
of e-cigarettes. Rather than wait decades for epidemiological
data in habitual e-cigarette users to become available, we rea-
sonedthatinvestigationsintoseveraloftheknownmechanisms
by which tobacco cigarettes increase cardiovascular risk would
provide insights in the health risks of e-cigarettes.

Methods
Study Population
Otherwise healthy habitual e-cigarette users between the ages
of 21 and45 years, who had used e-cigarettes most days for a
minimum of 1 year, were eligible for the study if they met the
following criteria: (1) no current tobacco cigarette smoking,
(2) nonobese (body mass index ≤30 [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), (3) no known
health problems, (4) not taking prescription medications ex-
cept oral contraceptive pills, (5) alcoholic intake 2 or fewer
drinks per day and no illicit drug use, and (6) not exposed to
secondhand smoke or using licensed nicotine replacement
therapies. Participants who were former tobacco cigarette
smokers were eligible for the study if they had quit smoking
more than 1 year prior to the study. Healthy volunteers meet-
ingtheseinclusioncriteriawhowerenote-cigaretteuserswere
eligible to be enrolled as control participants.
Theexperimentalprotocolwasapprovedbytheinstitutional
reviewboardattheUniversityofCalifornia,LosAngeles,andwrit-
ten informed consent was obtained from each participant.
A total of 42 participants meeting these criteria were en-
rolled in the study including 23 self-identified habitual
e-cigarette users and 19 self-identified non–tobacco ciga-
rette, non–e-cigarette user control participants. Two of the 23
e-cigarette users were eliminated when their plasma carboxy-
hemoglobin levels were found to be elevated, consistent with
recent tobacco cigarette use.16 One of the 19 control partici-
pants was eliminated when his plasma cotinine level was el-
evated, consistent with recent exposure to cigarettes.
Because the goal of the study was to investigate the effects
of chronic, not acute, e-cigarette exposure, participants were
asked not to use their e-cigarette on the day of the study. After
abstainingfromcaffeineande-cigaretteuseforatleast12hours,
volunteerswereplacedinasupinepositioninaquiet,tempera-
ture-controlled (21°C) room in the Human Physiology Labora-
tory located in the University of California, Los Angeles Clini-
cal Translational Research Center. No cell phones or digital
stimuli were permitted during the study, and during data
acquisition, there was no unnecessary talking.
Heart Rate Variability
To avoid the potential influence of circadian rhythm or men-
strual cycle phases on autonomic tone, participants were stud-
ied midday (between 10 AM-2 PM), and women were studied
during the early follicular phase, confirmed by plasma estro-
gen and progesterone levels. All women had negative urine
pregnancy test results on the day of the study.
Electrocardiogramelectrodeswereplacedonthechest,and
the participants then rested undisturbed for 10 minutes. The
Key Points
Question Do habitual electronic cigarette users have increased
cardiac sympathetic activity and oxidative stress, both risk factors
for future adverse cardiac events?
Findings In this cross-sectional case-control study of 42
otherwise healthy habitual electronic cigarette users and nonuser
control individuals, heart rate variability was shifted toward
increased sympathetic predominance, with the low frequency to
high frequency ratio significantly increased. Furthermore,
low-density lipoprotein oxidizability, which is a measure of
oxidative stress, was significantly increased in habitual electronic
cigarette users.
Meaning Habitual electronic cigarette use is associated with
physiologic effects. Further research into potential adverse health
effects of electronic cigarettes is warranted.

ing controlled breathing, participants were cued visually by

lyzed using standard commercial software (LabChart7; Ad
Instruments) in the frequency domain according to published
guidelines.19 Three main spectral components were distin-
guished: high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz), low frequency (LF;
0.04-0.15 Hz), and very LF (0.003-0.04 Hz). As recommended
in the published guidelines, HRV is presented in normalized

analysis was not applied to these recordings because a mini-
mum of 20-minute recordings, and preferentially 24-hour
recordings, are recommended for this methodology.19

andthenonparametricPvaluewascomputedviatheWilcoxon

were assessed using the nonparametric Spearman correlation.
Missing data values were not imputed; only the observed data
were used. Differences or associations were considered statis-
tically significant when P was less than or equal to .05.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Although e-cigarette users were asked to abstain from using
their e-cigarette on the day of the study, nicotine was present
in plasma in 5 habitual e-cigarette users, consistent with re-
cent use (range, 2.6-27.3 mg/L [to convert to micromoles per
liter, multiply by 6.164]). These 5 e-cigarette users were ex-
cluded from further analysis; an analysis inclusive of these ad-
ditional 5 e-cigarette users is available in eTables 1-5 in the
Supplement. Plasma cotinine levels were elevated on the day
of the study in 12 of the remaining 16 e-cigarette users, (range,
3.8-139 ng/mL, eFigure in the Supplement). Baseline charac-
teristics of the 16 e-cigarette users and 18 nonusers are com-
pared in Table 1. All parameters were within normal limits.

Correlation of HRV With E-Cigarette Burden
Plasma cotinine levels, an estimate of e-cigarette use, were sig-
nificantlycorrelatedwitheachoftheHRVcomponents:plasma
cotinine levels were inversely related to HF component
(rs, −0.34; P = .04) and directly related to the LF component
(rs, 0.35; P = .03) and LF to HF ratio (rs, 0.36; P = .03).
Controlled Breathing (Vagal Maneuver)
Within each group (e-cigarette users and nonuser control indi-
viduals), the HF component was significantly increased during
controlled breathing compared with spontaneous breathing.
Similarly, within each group, the LF and LF to HF ratio were de-
creased during controlled breathing compared with spontane-
ous breathing, consistent with a relative increase in cardiac va-
galtoneanddeclineincardiacsympatheticinfluence(Figure2).
However, between e-cigarette users and nonuser groups, the
magnitudeoftheincreaseinHFanddecreaseinLFandLFtoHF
ratio during controlled breathing were not different (Figure 2).
Oxidative Stress and Inflammation
Low-density lipoprotein oxidizability, indicative of suscepti-
bility of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins to oxida-
tion, was significantly increased in e-cigarette users (n = 12)
compared with nonuser control participants (n = 18) (mean
[SEM], 3801.0 [415.7] U vs 2413.3 [325.0] U, P = .01), consis-
tent with increased oxidative stress (Figure 3). Paraoxonase-1

649.9 [125.7] nmol p-nitrophenol/min/mL vs 892.8 [110.0]
nmol p-nitrophenol/min/mL; P = .17), consistent with de-
creased protection against oxidative stress, although this dif-
ference did not meet statistical significance. High-density
lipoprotein antioxidant index was not different between the
groups (e-cigarette users [n = 12] vs nonusers [n = 18]: mean
[SEM], 0.42 [0.05] U vs 0.38 [0.04] U; P = .55). Inflammatory

between e-cigarette users and nonusers (abnormal in
3 e-cigarette users [n = 15] and 1 nonuser [n = 17]; P = .15).
Plasma cotinine levels were directly related to LDL oxi-
dizability (rs, 0.35; P = .05) but not the other indices of oxida-

were nondetectable at the time of the study. These findings are
important for 2 reasons: first, because both increased cardiac

mechanisms by which tobacco cigarettes increase cardiovas-
cular risk,8,9 these findings have critical implications for the
long-termcardiacrisksassociatedwithhabituale-cigaretteuse.

In the 1980s, clinical studies first recognized perturbations
in HRV as a powerful independent predictor of increased mor-

Limitations
Humanstudiesrelyonself-reportingformanyofthebehaviors
that cannot be controlled when participants are away from the
laboratory and thus are vulnerable to misstatements and
misrecollections.39 To circumvent this problem, we required
biochemical verification of e-cigarette use and absence of to-
bacco cigarette use.16,39 Nonetheless, we cannot be completely
certainthat1ormoreofourparticipantswasnotsurreptitiously
consuming tobacco products. We did not perform toxicology
screening to eliminate marijuana and other drug exposures.

cigarette exposure, which can be quantified by the number of
tobacco cigarettes smoked per day. Although we did ask
e-cigarette users how much time per day they used their
e-cigarettes and how much liquid they used per day, answers
were vague and varied on repeated questioning and were un-
reliableoverall.Althoughmeasuredonlyonce,plasmacotinine
levels seemed the most objective means to assess e-cigarette
burden. There were more former smokers in the habitual
e-cigaretteusergroupcomparedwithnonusercontrolindividu-
als. This difference is unlikely to explain the difference in HRV
or oxidative stress between the groups because several stud-
ieshaveconfirmedthatHRVcomponentsimprovesignificantly,
and cardiovascular risk similarly improves following tobacco
cigarette cessation.40-44

findings in e-cigarette users, Barutcu et al18 found that vagal
modulation in response to controlled breathing was blunted in

ing the day of the study, compared with age-matched non-
smoker control participants. In our study, vagal responses to
controlled breathing were not different between e-cigarette
users and nonusers, perhaps indicative of a less severe abnor-
malityofautonomicfunctionassociatedwithe-cigarettescom-
pared with tobacco cigarettes.
Conclusions
In summary, in this cross-sectional study of non–tobacco ciga-
rettesmokingadultswhohabituallyusee-cigarettescompared
with nonuser control participants, evidence is presented dem-
onstrating that e-cigarette use is not harmless. Habitual
e-cigarette use is associated with a shift in cardiac autonomic
balance toward sympathetic predominance and increased oxi-
dativestress,bothassociatedwithincreasedcardiovascularrisk.
Further studies are required to determine whether these risks
are similar to those associated with habitual tobacco cigarette
use. However, the nonlinear relationship between number of
tobacco cigarettes smoked per day and cardiovascular risk sug-
gests that there may be a low threshold above which underly-
ing physiologic processes are saturated45; habitual e-cigarette
users may cross this threshold. On the basis of these studies,
wecanconcludethathabituale-cigaretteuseisassociatedwith
physiologic effects. Nonetheless, we cannot confirm causality
on the basis of this single, small study; further research into the
potential adverse cardiovascular health effects of e-cigarettes
is warranted.
