IMPORTANCE Precise stratification of cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary heart
disease (CHD) is needed to inform treatment decisions.
OBJECTIVE To derive and validate a score to predict risk of cardiovascular outcomes among
patients with CHD, using large-scale analysis of circulating proteins.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study of participants with stable
CHD. For the derivation cohort (Heart and Soul study), outpatients from San Francisco were
enrolled from 2000 through 2002 and followed up through November 2011 (�11.1 years).
For the validation cohort (HUNT3, a Norwegian population-based study), participants were
enrolled from 2006 through 2008 and followed up through April 2012 (5.6 years).
EXPOSURES Using modified aptamers, 1130 proteins were measured in plasma samples.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A 9-protein risk score was derived and validated for 4-year
probability of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and all-cause death. Tests, including
the C statistic, were used to assess performance of the 9-protein risk score, which was
compared with the Framingham secondary event model, refit to the cohorts in this study.
Within-person change in the 9-protein risk score was evaluated in the Heart and Soul study
from paired samples collected 4.8 years apart.
RESULTS From the derivation cohort, 938 samples were analyzed, participants’ median age
at enrollment was 67.0 years, and 82% were men. From the validation cohort, 971 samples
were analyzed, participants’ median age at enrollment was 70.2 years, and 72% were men.
In the derivation cohort, C statistics were 0.66 for refit Framingham, 0.74 for 9-protein,
and 0.75 for refit Framingham plus 9-protein models. In the validation cohort, C statistics
were 0.64 for refit Framingham, 0.70 for 9-protein, and 0.71 for refit Framingham plus
9-protein models. Adding the 9-protein risk score to the refit Framingham model increased
the C statistic by 0.09 (95% CI, 0.06-0.12) in the derivation cohort, and in the validation
cohort, the C statistic was increased by 0.05 (95% CI, 0.02-0.09). Compared with the refit
Framingham model, the integrated discrimination index for the 9-protein model was 0.12
(95% CI, 0.08-0.16) in the derivation cohort and 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05-0.10) in the validation
cohort. In analysis of paired samples among 139 participants with cardiovascular events after
the second sample, absolute within-person annualized risk increased more for the 9-protein
model (median, 1.86% [95% CI, 1.15%-2.54%]) than for the refit Framingham model
(median, 1.00% [95% CI, 0.87%-1.19%]) (P = .002), while among 375 participants without
cardiovascular events, both scores changed less and similarly (P = .30).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with stable CHD, a risk score based on 9
proteins performed better than the refit Framingham secondary event risk score in predicting
cardiovascular events, but still provided only modest discriminative accuracy. Further
research is needed to assess whether the score is more accurate in a lower-risk population.

oronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of
mortalityandmorbidity.1 Despitetheimportanceofrisk
assessment,2 considerable room for improvement
remains.3 Genetic risk factors4,5 and candidate proteins, such
asC-reactiveprotein,havedeliveredonlymodestadvances2and
do not adequately enable precision medicine—management
based on accurately stratified personal phenotyping.
A recent scientific statement from the American Heart
Association predicted that proteomics will be transformative,6
but the proteomic characterization of cardiovascular risk
phenotypes in large populations requires a high-throughput
technology. In this study, such a technology was applied,
based on modified aptamers as binding reagents,7 to quan-
tify 1130 proteins in 2 prospective cohorts of participants
with stable CHD. The objectives of this study were the fol-
lowing: (1) to evaluate a broader range of prognostic plasma
protein biomarkers than previously possible; (2) to create a
multiprotein model of biomarkers for prognostic stratifica-
tion; (3) to validate the performance of the model in an
external cohort8; (4) to assess the robustness of this model
and key prognostic proteins within it to typical variations in
sample collection and processing9; (5) to determine whether
inclusion of this multiprotein panel in a risk score com-
posed of traditional risk factors improves risk prediction;
and (6) to determine from analysis of paired samples col-
lected nearly 5 years apart whether the interval change in
multiprotein panel risk score is greater among participants
who experience a cardiovascular event after the second
sample than among participants who do not. This study
focused on participants with stable CHD because they have
a broad range of risk that is not adequately identified by tra-
ditional risk factors.10,11
Methods
Study Populations
Studies in both cohorts were approved by the appropriate
institutional review boards, and all participants provided
written informed consent. The derivation cohort consisted of
938 baseline plasma samples from the Heart and Soul
study—a prospective cohort of patients with stable CHD from
12 clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area (enrollment, Septem-
ber 2000-December 2002; last follow-up, November 2011).
The Heart and Soul study included participants with history
of myocardial infarction (MI), angiographic evidence of at
least 50% stenosis in 1 or more coronary vessels, prior evi-
dence of inducible ischemia by stress testing, or history of
coronary revascularization. Participants were excluded if
they had an MI within the previous 6 months, were unable to
walk 1 block, or were planning to relocate from the local area
within 2 years. From this cohort, a prognostic 9-protein
model was constructed and then validated on 971 samples
from HUNT3, a prospective population-based cohort study
from Nord-Trøndelag County in Norway (enrollment, 2006-
2008; last follow-up, April 2012).12 HUNT3 participants were
included who met Heart and Soul study inclusion criteria and
had not had an MI within the previous 6 months. In the Heart
and Soul study, race was self-identified in a questionnaire
with categories of white, black, Asian, Latino, or other.13
HUNT3 was a racially homogeneous cohort (≥98% white).14
The information about race was used to discern whether the
racial composition of the subset of participants with paired
samples was similar to that of the overall Heart and Soul
population in this study.
In contrast to the more standardized sample collection in
the derivation cohort (fasted samples were collected at the
same time of day and centrifuged and frozen within 1 hour of
collection),samplecollectioninthevalidationcohortwasmore
representative of likely clinical practice conditions: partici-
pants did not fast, and samples were collected at random times
of day and processed (≤24 hours) after blood draw.
Changes in the 9-protein risk score were assessed by using
paired samples from 514 participants in the Heart and Soul
study in whom second plasma samples were taken a median
4.8 years after the first; participants had no cardiovascular
events between these 2 samples. The study evaluated whether
the second 9-protein risk score or the change from the base-
lineriskscorecouldhelptodifferentiatethoseparticipantswho
had a cardiovascular event after the second sample from those
who did not. A flowchart of the sample and statistical process
is shown in Figure 1 and explained further in section 1 of the
Supplement.
Quantification of Proteins in Human Plasma
by Modified Aptamers
The method of quantification of proteins by modified
aptamers has been previously described.7,15,16 In brief, each
of the 1130 individual proteins measured (eTable 1 in the
Supplement) has its own binding reagent made of chemically
modified DNA, referred to as modified aptamer.7 Each
sample of plasma was incubated with the mixture of modi-
fied aptamers to generate modified aptamer-protein com-
plexes. Unbound modified aptamers and unbound or non-
specifically bound proteins were eliminated by 2 bead-based
immobilization steps. After eluting the modified aptamers
from the target protein, the fluorescently labeled modified
aptamers were directly quantified on an Agilent hybridiza-
tion array (Agilent Technologies). Calibrators were included
so that the degree of fluorescence was a quantitative reflec-
tion of protein concentration. The 1054 proteins that passed
quality control (eTable 1 in the Supplement) had median
intraassay and interassay coefficient of variation of less than
5%. The key data processing steps, statistical modeling, and
specific assessments are summarized in Figure 1.
Statistical Methods
The primary outcome in this study was defined as the first
event among MI, stroke/transient ischemic attack (referred to
as stroke), heart failure hospitalization, or all-cause death. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to estimate the asso-
ciation between levels of individual proteins and risk of pri-
mary outcome. In single-variable analysis of an association of
individual proteins with the primary outcome, Bonferroni-
corrected significance levels were reported, adjusting for 1054
comparisons, resulting in a nominal significance level

(P < 4.74 × 10−5). All other statistical tests were 2-sided using
anominal5%significancelevel(P < .05).Toconstructthemul-
tiprotein risk model for primary outcome, the least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator17 (LASSO) was used for vari-
able (protein) selection with the Cox model. This method pe-
nalized the sum of the absolute values of the regression coef-
ficients leading to some coefficients shrinking to zero and thus
simultaneously performed variable selection.17-19 LASSO regu-
larization level was chosen by cross-validation using the 1 stan-
dard error rule (section 3 in the Supplement). LASSO was used
for variable selection only, with the fully parametric (Weibull)
survival model as the final prognostic model. Stepwise back-
ward elimination, starting from the set of LASSO-selected pro-
teins, was used to remove proteins that were not significant
predictors in the absence of the constraint imposed by the
LASSO penalty using the Bayesian information criterion stop-
ping criteria.
Asacomparativereferenceforthemultiproteinriskmodel,
the variables from the Framingham secondary event risk
model20 were refit to the Heart and Soul derivation cohort
(referred to as refit Framingham). This model included age,
sex, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and current smok-
ing status.20 The 4-year time horizon was retained, for which
this risk score was originally validated.20
Model performance within each cohort was assessed by
discrimination and calibration. For discrimination, both the
C statistic21 and discrimination slope8 are reported. The
category-free net reclassification index (NRI>0)22 and inte-
grated discrimination index (IDI)8 were used to assess reclas-
sification performance and improvement in discrimination
over the refit Framingham model. Calibration performance
was assessed with a calibration plot and summarized across
the full range of risk scores using the Hosmer-Lemeshow sta-
tistic. Calibration-in-the-large is also reported—the difference
between the observed 4-year event frequency and the mean
predicted risk score. Both the refit Framingham and protein
models were recalibrated (Section 4, eTables 2 and 3; eFig-
ures 1 and 2 in the Supplement) for use in the validation
cohort to enable an equal comparison and reduce the effect
of miscalibration.23,24 Distribution-free (nonparametric) 95%
CIs were reported for median values and bootstrap intervals
for point estimates of performance metrics when asymptotic
intervals were not available.
Changesinriskscoreinpairedsampleswereassessedusing
the Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing the within-person
change for patients with and without events after their sec-
ond blood sample. Within-person risk score differences were
expressed, relative to the elapsed time between the 2 blood
collections, and annualized. A likelihood ratio test was used
to compare the fit of the augmented model and combining
within-person change with the baseline proteomic risk score.
All statistical computing was performed using the R Lan-
guage for Statistical Computing (version 3.2.1).25
Results
Population Characteristics
The characteristics of the derivation and external validation
cohorts are summarized in Table 1. There were fewer events
in the validation cohort, primarily because of shorter follow-
up.

and α2-antiplasmin (SERPINF2) (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.59-
0.71]; P < 1.00 × 10−16).
9-Protein Risk Score
The 9-protein risk score reflects the probability of a cardio-
vascular event occurring within 4-years and is given by risk
score (Supplement, section 5.2):
risk score = 1 – e-
e 
Log(4)–PI
(
)
0.85
,
where the prognostic index (PI) combines the measurements
of the 9 proteins as follows:
prognostic index = 16.61 − 1.55 × ANGPT2 + 1.22 × GDF8/11
− 2.12 × C7 + 2.64 × SERPINF2 − 0.57 × CCL18 −1.02 ×
ANGPTL4 − 1.43 × SERPINA3 − 0.72 × MMP12 − 0.59 ×
TNN13.
Table 2 provides the estimated HRs and associated model
coefficients for a Cox proportional hazards model based on
the refit Framingham variables for the full duration of
follow-up, with and without the addition of prognostic
index from the 9-protein model. In the presence of the
information from 9 proteins, most clinical variables
remained as significant risk predictors except for HDL-C.
Systolic blood pressure was not a significant risk predictor
either in the refit Framingham model or with the addition of
the 9 proteins. Adjusting the 9-protein prognostic index for
the Framingham variables reduced its HR only modestly
(eFigure 4 in the Supplement), suggesting that the 9 pro-
teins contained prognostic information that was at least
partly independent of traditional risk factors.
Proteomic Model Performance
Risk stratified survival curves of the 2 study populations are
shown in Figure 2, illustrating that in both the derivation
and validation cohorts, the participants had 4-year cumula-
tive event rates of 60% to 80% in the 10th deciles and less
than 10% in the first deciles. Discrimination performance

was assessed using the 4-year time horizon, the same as the
original Framingham secondary event model.20 Table 3 lists
the performance metrics for the refit Framingham model,
the 9-protein model, and for the combination of both mod-
els. In the derivation cohort, the C statistic increased from
0.66 for the refit Framingham model to 0.74 (Δ C statistic,
0.09 [95% CI, 0.06-0.12]) for the 9-protein model alone and
to 0.75 (Δ C statistic, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.08-0.12]) for the
9-protein model combined with the refit Framingham
model. The discrimination slope was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.07-
0.11) for the refit Framingham model, 0.21 (95% CI, 0.17-
0.24) for the 9-protein model, and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.19-0.26)
for the refit Framingham combined with the 9-protein
model. When compared with refit Framingham, the
9-protein model had an IDI of 0.12 (95% CI, 0.08-0.16),
which indicates an absolute increase of 12% in mean risk for
participants with events compared with participants with-
out events over the clinical variable model. The 9-protein
model had an NRI(>0) of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.40-0.65), with
event-specific components of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11-0.36) and
no event-specific components of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.22-0.36).

with the refit Framingham model generated an NRI(>0) of
0.48 (95% CI, 0.33-0.62) (Table 3). The mean 4-year risk
proteomic risk was within 2 percentage points of the
observed event rate in the external validation cohort
(calibration-in-the-large). Calibration performance across
the full range of the 9-protein risk scores is shown in
Figure 3 (eFigure 2 [for refit Framingham model] in the
Supplement); for the 9-protein model, the observed risk in
each decile of the validation cohort was within 5 percentage
points of the mean protein risk score. The 9-protein model
was developed for the composite end points of MI, heart
failure, stroke, and death. For individual end points, median
9-protein risk score in derivation for MI was 33% (95% CI,
25.6%-38.6%); for heart failure, 37% (95% CI, 31.5%-43.7%);
for stroke, 24% (95% CI, 19.6%-29.7%); and for death, 30%
(95% CI, 27.0%-34.0%). In the absence of any event, the
median 4-year 9-protein risk score was 14.2% (95% CI,
13.5%-15.2%). Similar risk score distributions across these
event types were observed in the validation cohort (eFigure
5 in the Supplement).
Analysis of Paired Samples
Changes in the 9-protein risk score were evaluated from paired
samples from 514 participants (Heart and Soul study) in whom
second plasma samples were taken a median of 4.8 years after
the first, and participants were event-free between these 2
samples. The baseline characteristics of this subset of partici-
pantsweresimilartoallHeartandSoulparticipantsinthisstudy
(Table 1) except the time to the first event was longer because
of the requisite absence of events prior to the second sample.
Among the participants with paired samples, 139 had an
event (MI, heart failure, stroke, or death) after the second
sample; the paired samples were taken a median of 2.8 years
and 7.7 years prior to that event. The remaining 375 partici-
pants had paired samples a median of 4.3 and 9.0 years prior
to completing their event-free follow-up. This analysis as-
sessed whether the 9-protein risk score changed to a greater
extent for participants approaching an event compared with
participants who remained event free.
As Figure 4 shows, 139 participants who experienced an
event after the second sample had a median 9-protein risk of

24.6% (95% CI, 22.6%-27.7%) at baseline and 34.0% (95% CI,
29.2%-38.4%) at 4.8 years while median refit Framingham
risk was 28.7% (95% CI, 26.6%-30.3%) at baseline and 33.8%
(95% CI, 32.5%-36.2%) at 4.8 years. The 375 participants
who were event free during the entire study had a median
9-protein risk of 14.4% (95% CI, 13.5%-16.5%) at baseline and
17.4% (95% CI, 16.0%-19.0%) at 4.8 years while median refit
Framingham risk was 20.3% (95% CI, 19.0%-21.5%) at base-
line and 23.8% (95% CI, 22.2%-25.8%) at 4.8 years. The
absolute within-person change in the 9-protein risk was
greater than for the refit Framingham model for participants
with events (P = .002); median annualized within-person
change was 1.86% (95% CI, 1.15%-2.54%) for the 9-protein
model compared with 1.00% (95% CI, 0.87%-1.19%) for refit
Framingham. Over 5 years, these annualized values repre-
sent an absolute change in risk of 9.3% for the 9-protein
score and 5.0% for refit Framingham. For both risk models,
these within-person changes were greater than for the
event-free group (P < .001), in which the median annualized
within-person change in the 9-protein risk group was 0.65%
(95% CI, 0.45%-0.86%) compared with 0.72% (95% CI,
0.64%-0.80%) for refit Framingham (P = .3). The IDI for the
9-protein risk predictions at baseline, compared with 4.8
years, was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04-0.10)—an absolute increase in
mean risk of 7% for participants with events after the second
sample over their baseline risk. Combining the 9-protein
prognostic index at 4.8 years with the within-person change
from baseline yielded an augmented model that fit slightly
better (P = .03) than the 9-protein prognostic index at 4.8
years alone, although the discriminatory power was not
meaningfully improved (IDI, 0.009; NRI(>0), 0.26; Δ C sta-
tistic, 0.006).

Discussion
Individualized risk assessment in patients diagnosed with
apparently stable CHD is necessary because stable CHD
appears to be a heterogeneous entity with a broad range of
outcomes.10,11 For stratification of cardiovascular risk using
the “omics” technologies, genomics has been investigated
most extensively, but genomic risk scores do not substan-
tively improve risk discrimination over traditional risk
factors.4,5,26 Even if genomic approaches are ultimately suc-
cessful, they will succeed primarily in predicting risk related
to lifelong exposure and will not discern any changes in risk
over time.4,5,11,26 Compared with genomics, proteomics
offers several advantages: proteins integrate both environ-
mental and genetic influences; proteins are responsive to
lifestyle and therapeutic interventions, informing of changes
in risk27,28; and proteins are effectors of biological process
and thus potential targets of therapies.29 However, limita-
tions in proteomic techniques have to this point hindered the
implementation of these advantages.
In this study, levels of 1130 plasma proteins were mea-
sured using modified aptamers7,15,30,31 to identify prognostic
proteins that improve cardiovascular risk prediction. A pre-
diction time horizon of 4 years was chosen—sufficiently long
toimplementtherapeuticchanges11—andyetnotsodistantthat
risk becomes deniable, losing its motivation. In the discovery
cohort, 200 proteins were prognostic of cardiovascular events
(eTable 4 in the Supplement), many of which are newly dis-
covered biomarkers of cardiovascular risk.
An unbiased statistical approach was used to arrive at a
9-protein risk prediction model which, by itself, performed
better than traditional risk factors represented by a refit
Framingham secondary event model20 and offered fair dis-
crimination based on the C statistic (Table 3). The discrimina-
tion slope represents the separation in mean risk between par-
ticipants with and without events.8,18 The addition of the
9-protein risk score to refit Framingham offered a substantial
improvement in this separation (Table 3). Admittedly, the large
magnitude of the improvement in discrimination (in C statis-
tic, discrimination slope separation, and IDI) and net reclas-
sification by the 9-protein model (Table 3) was partly reflec-
tive of the weak performance of traditional risk factors in
predicting the risk of secondary events,32 also observed in the
present study.
By including an independent external cohort in this study,
best practices for validation were followed,8 reducing the risk
of translation to clinical use by verifying the predictive capac-
ity of the key prognostic proteins and their combination in the
proteomic model to less-stringent sample collection and pro-
cessing that are more typical of clinical practice.6,9,12 In apply-
ing protein-based risk assessment to patients with stable CHD,
this diagnosis was found to be associated with a broad range
of cardiovascular and mortality risks (Figure 2, Figure 3), sug-
gesting that stable CHD may not represent a single homoge-
neous entity.
Paired samples were used to evaluate whether the pro-
teomicriskchangedovertimeasparticipantsapproachedacar-
diovascular event. The 9-protein risk score changed more than
the refit Framingham model among participants approach-

ing new events. In addition, the 9-protein risk score gener-
ated at the follow-up sample was a stronger predictor of sub-
sequent outcomes than the preceding baseline risk score. The
mutability of the proteomic risk score, in relation to future
events, offers a potential advantage over genetic risk predic-
tion, which remains unchanged during lifetime. It remains
unclear, however, whether the magnitude of changes in the
proteomic risk score among participants with future events
might lead to a change in management.

able, including a model from the REACH (Reduction of Athero-
thrombosisforContinuedHealth)registry,whichcombinestra-
ditional risk factors with information about the extent of
diseased vascular beds, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, medi-
cal treatments, and geographic location.33 The REACH registry
algorithm reported a C statistic for the prediction of a next car-
diovascular event of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.68) and lacked ex-
ternal validation. The present study results could not be di-
rectly compared with the REACH model because some of the
REACH variables were unavailable in its 2 cohorts.
Anothercardiovascularriskpredictionmodelusedthebest
available candidate biomarkers for cardiovascular outcomes
in the Heart and Soul cohort,10 including high-sensitivity tro-
ponin, NT-proBNP, C-reactive protein, and urine albumin:
creatinine ratio. This risk prediction model did not replicate
well in external validation.10 Genetic variants have also been
associated with the risk of CHD. A recent study tested how well
a genetic risk score based on 27 variants could predict recur-
rent CHD events in the CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent
Events) and PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin
Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocar-
dial Infarction 22) trial populations.4 The adjusted quintile HR
was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.22-2.67), a risk prediction that is apprecia-
bly smaller than proteomics yielded in the present study, with
an adjusted quintile HR of 7.63 (95% CI, 4.53- 12.85) in the vali-
dation set (Table 3).
Study Strengths
This study conducted a large-scale proteomic analysis of car-
diovascular risk, using a high-throughput proteomic
platform.7,16,30,31 The study was conducted in 2 large well-
characterized cohorts with standardized adjudication of out-
come events12,34 across 2 continents and included cross-
sectional and longitudinal assessments. Specimen quality has
been noted as an important reason why omics findings re-
ported from one laboratory may not replicate in others.9
Accordingly, the analyses in the present study were con-
ducted across a range of specimen qualities, representative of
standardized (derivation) and clinical practice conditions
(validation). The findings were consistent across this range of
specimen quality.
Limitations
This initial analysis of circulating proteins focused on a
population of relatively high-risk individuals with estab-
lished CHD. There is additional need for accurate cardiovas-
cular risk prediction in the lower-risk general population or
in even higher-risk individuals with CHD. Another limita-
tion is that this study investigated only the sensitivity to
increasing risk as represented by an approaching event; it
will be important to evaluate individual medical interven-
tions that alter risk to learn how well proteins can discern
changes in risk in specific settings.
Conclusions
Among patients with stable CHD, a risk score based on 9 pro-
teins performed better than the refit Framingham secondary
eventriskscoreinpredictingcardiovasculareventsbutstillonly
provided modest discriminative accuracy. Further research is
needed to assess whether the score is more accurate in a lower-
risk population.
