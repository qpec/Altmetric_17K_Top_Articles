Abstract
Gadolinium chelates are widely used as
contrast media for magnetic resonance imaging. The
approved gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs)
have historically been considered safe and well
tolerated when used at recommended dosing levels.
However, for nearly a decade, an association between
GBCA administration and the development of nephro-
genic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been recognized in
patients with severe renal impairment. This has led to
modifications in clinical practices aimed at reducing
the potential and incidence of NSF development.
Newer reports have emerged regarding the accumu-
lation of gadolinium in various tissues of patients who
do not have renal impairment, including bone, brain,
and kidneys. Despite the observations of gadolinium
accumulation in tissues regardless of renal function,
very limited clinical data regarding the potential for
and mechanisms of toxicity is available. This signif-
icant gap in knowledge warrants retrospective cohort
study efforts, as well as prospective studies that
involve gadolinium ion (Gd3?) testing in patients
exposed to GBCA. This review examines the potential
biochemical and molecular basis of gadolinium
toxicity, possible clinical significance of gadolinium
tissue retention and accumulation, and methods that
can limit gadolinium body burden.

Introduction
It was previously widely believed that GBCAs are
rapidly and completely excreted from the human body
in an intact state. In recent years, however, there is a
rapidly growing body of data that demonstrate that
gadolinium accumulates in tissues (including brain,
bone, and kidneys) of patients exposed to GBCAs
during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), despite
normal renal function. Retention of gadolinium
increases in those who have repeated GBCA exposure.
Patient-initiated survey results available through the
Lighthouse Project (patient advocacy group) show the
onset of a series of symptoms (including neurological,
musculoskeletal, and dermal) in patients within a
month of their last MRI. Given the increasing data
available regarding tissue deposition in patients with-
out renal impairment, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) published a safety announce-
ment in July 2015 that it is investigating the risk of

 brain deposits associated with the repeated use of
GBCAs MRI (FDA Drug Safety Communication
2015).
Due to a lack of retrospective or prospective
clinical cohort studies regarding the association of
post-exposure
medical
conditions
and
recurrent
GBCA exposure, the clinical significance of gadolin-
ium tissue accumulation in patients without renal
impairment is not fully known. Nonetheless, the
potential for toxicity can be gleaned from published
data of in vivo and in vitro studies of gadolinium
toxicity,
GBCA
biochemistry,
and
differential
gadolinium chelate stability. The understanding of
the mechanisms of gadolinium toxicity can help
determine the clinical significance of gadolinium
retention in tissues so that the risks of GBCA use for
MRI can be better assessed. This then can serve to
develop guidelines for GBCA use, the possible
development of new gadolinium chelates with higher
stability and less toxicity, and determining the utility
of gadolinium chelation therapy.
In 2006, Grobner (2006) established an association
between NSF development and exposure to GBCAs
during MRI. A number of published studies suggest
several explanations for GBCA-related NSF develop-
ment including, impaired clearance of gadolinium by
the kidneys leading to tissue accumulation of dissoci-
atedGd.Moreoftheadministereddoseofgadoliniumin
those with severe renal dysfunction is available due to
reduced elimination from the kidneys. The increased
level of Gd3? available leads to adverse effects includ-
ingNSF.Thosewithnormalrenalfunctionwhoundergo
repeated GBCA administration will, over time, have
higher levels of Gd3? tissue deposition and potentially
increase the risk of gadolinium-related toxicity. Studies
done in vitro uncover a number of biochemical and
molecular alterations that may be associated with
adverse effects seen in vivo. Although some acute
effects of GBCA exposure have been reported, includ-
ing anaphylactic and other acute reactions (Blasco-
Perrin et al. 2013; Terzi and Sokmen 1999; Unal and
Arslan 1999), the potential for chronic and delayed
manifestation of toxicity should be considered.
Toxicity of GBCAs has primarily been attributed to
the dissociation of Gd3? from the chelated complexes.
This dissociation is believed to be related to differ-
ences in the stability of the complexes among the
various types of GBCAs (Port et al. 2008; Sieber et al.
2008a). However, there is data that suggest that
competitive chelation with components in the extra-
cellular matrix may also play a role in the tissue
distribution and toxicity of GBCAs (Taupitz et al.
2013). Non-complexed Gd3? and other members of
the lanthanide series (e.g., samarium, europium, and
cerium) have long been known to deposit in bone
tissue of animals and humans. However, a number of
studies measuring Gd3? deposition show that it can be
found in other tissues including the skin, kidneys
(Koeberl and Bayer 1992; Sieber et al. 2008b; Wang
et al. 2015), liver (Sieber et al. 2008b; Wang et al.
2015), and brain (Darrah et al. 2009; Gibby et al. 2004;
Koeberl and Bayer 1992; Murata et al. 2016). The non-
chelated Gd3? retained in body tissues can serve as a
source of toxicity.
Overview of gadolinium-based contrast agents
The chemical bonds in GBCAs are made of a gadolin-
ium ion (the MRI active aspect) and a carrier molecule.
A carrier molecule is called a chelating agent, which
modifies the distribution of gadolinium within the body
to overcome its toxicity while maintaining its contrast
properties. Gadolinium-based contrast agents are used
intravenously to enhance the detail and clarity of
diagnostic MRI or magnetic resonance angiography.
The current FDA and EMA-approved GBCAs are
gadobenate
(MultiHance),
gadobutrol
(Gadavist),
gadodiamide (Omniscan), gadopentetate (Magnevist),
gadoterate
(Dotarem),
gadoteridol
(ProHance),
gadoversetamide (OptiMARK), gadoxetate (Eovist),
and gadofosveset (Ablavar, US only). These agents
consist of a central paramagnetic Gd3? chelated to a
ligand to prevent direct toxicity by free Gd3?. Free
Gd3? is a toxic lanthanide heavy metal with a size
similar to that of Ca2?. This similarity can lead to
competitiveinhibition of biologicalprocesses requiring
Ca2? and cause toxicity. Lanthanide ions such as Gd3?
can bind to Ca2? binding enzymes and affect voltage-
gated calcium channels, and therefore, lead to adverse
biological effects (Sherry et al. 2009).
During MRI, tissues are pulsed with radio fre-
quency in the presence of a magnetic field. This
induces excitation of protons within water molecules.
The release of energy when the protons relax back to
their ground state is recorded, producing an MR
image. Varying tissue signal intensity is determined by
the relaxation time (T1 and T2) and proton density.

 GBCAs function to reduce the relaxation times
increasing the signal intensity.
The primary categories of GBCAs are macrocyclic
and linear. Gadobutrol, Gadoterate meglumine, and
Gadoteridol are macrocyclic GBCAs, and the remain-
ing are linear forms. Macrocyclic GBCAs form cage-
like structures with Gd3? enclosed in the cavity of the
complex. The macrocyclic GBCAs tend to have lower
dissociation constants and are therefore thought to be
more stable than the linear GBCAs. The higher the
dissociation constant, the more likely free gadolinium
can be released into the circulation and tissues (Port
et al. 2008). The GBCAs (both linear and macrocytic)
can be ionic (dissociates into charged particles in a
solution), nonionic, nonspecific extracellular, and
tissue-specific.
Sieber et al., conducted in vivo studies in rats to
compare the potential for the development of NSF
between different GBCAs (Sieber et al. 2008a). Their
data suggest that GBCAs differ in the potential to
release Gd3? into the skin. They observed fibrosis,
increased cellularity, and increased cell swelling in
80 % of animals treated with Omniscan (a non-ionic,
linear GBCA). The skin lesions appeared to correlate
with high Gd3? concentrations in the skin, liver, and
femur.
In a review by Morcos (2008), it was determined
that studies in rodents with normal renal function
demonstrate that Gd3? tissue retention was greater
after injection with a non-ionic linear GBCA (gado-
diamide) when compared to an ionic linear GBCA
(gadopentetate). The lowest level of tissue retention
occurred with a non-ionic macrocyclic agent (Gado-
teridol). This similar observation (more deposition
with a linear GBCA) was made by Gibby et al. who
studied the retention of gadolinium in human bone
tissue collected from patients undergoing hip joint
replacement surgery (Gibby et al. 2004).
Gadolinium tissue accumulation
Chelated Gd3? has been thought to be swiftly cleared
by the kidneys in those with normal renal function.
However, studies in animals and humans have
revealed that Gd3? (free or chelated) is retained in a
number of tissues in those without renal impairment.
In rats repeatedly administered linear GBCAs, Gd3?
deposition in the cerebellum was observed, as well as
progressive and persistent T1 signal hyperintensity
(Robert et al. 2015). Healthy rats were administered
IV injections of 0.6 mmol/kg of a GBCA or saline 4
times per week for 5 weeks (a total of 20 injections).
T1-weighted MRI was performed before injection,
once a week during the administration of compounds,
and 4 weeks after the administration period. Induc-
tively coupled, plasma mass spectrometry was used to
measure total gadolinium concentration. The linear
GBCAs studied induced increased signal intensity in
the deep cerebellar nuclei. By Week 10, the total
gadolinium concentration in the cerebellum of rats
treated with linear GBCAs was higher than in rats
treated with a macrocyclic GBCA.
Using inductively coupled plasma mass spec-
troscopy, Kanda et al. evaluated gadolinium accumu-
lation in post-mortem brain tissues of subjects who
received GBCAs but who were not diagnosed with any
renal disease (Kanda et al. 2015a). They found that
gadolinium accumulated in the brain, particularly in
the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus. Administra-
tion of GBCAs is also associated with increasing
signal intensity within the dentate nucleus and globus
pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted MRIs (Stojanov
et al. 2016). In a number of studies by different
researchers, signal intensity ratios between the dentate
nucleus and globus pallidus were compared to control
regions via retrospective analyses on T1-weighted MR
images. GBCA deposition in the dentate nucleus and
globus pallidus appears to depend on the GBCA class
administered (Kanda et al. 2015b; Radbruch et al.
2015) and is also dose dependent (Kanda et al. 2014).
Studies by Radbruch and Kanda demonstrate that
the administration of the linear GBCAs is associated
with higher signal intensities. Kanda et al. performed a
longitudinal analysis of data of a group of 381
consecutive patients who had undergone whole-brain,
contrast-enhanced brain MRI. Comparisons were
made between patients who had 6 or more contrast-
enhanced brain MRIs and those who had unenhanced
MRI. The dentate nucleus and globus pallidus signal
intensity ratios in patients who had undergone con-
trast-enhanced examinations were greater than those
of patients who had undergone unenhanced examina-
tions. The ratios also correlated with the number of
previous GBCA administrations.
McDonald et al. also demonstrated the association
of the administration of GBCAs in patients with

 gadolinium in neuronal tissue. Comparisons were
made of post-mortem neuronal tissue between subjects
that received unenhanced MRI and those who received
at least 4 enhanced MRIs. Increased levels of
elemental gadolinium were detected in all studied
neuronal tissues of all patients exposed to multiple
GBCA administration, and the dentate nucleus con-
tained the highest concentrations of the regions
studied. T1-weighted signal intensity and tissue
gadolinium concentrations were also found to be
dose-dependent.
Murata et al. used inductively coupled plasma mass
spectroscopy to analyze brain, bone, and skin tissue
for gadolinium in subjects undergoing autopsy. Com-
parisons were made between those who had received
macrocyclic or linear GBCAs (Murata et al. 2016).
This group also found gadolinium deposition in
normal brain and bone tissue of patients with normal
renal function.
A study by Wang et al. demonstrated the deposition
of gadolinium in the skin, bone, and liver in rats
exposed to gadodiamide (a non-ionic linear GBCA) or
gadoteric acid (an ionic macrocyclic GBCA) (Wang
et al. 2015). The skin Gd3? concentration was
significantly higher (180-fold) in rats that received
gadodiamide than in those treated with gadoteric acid.
Significantly higher concentrations were also found in
the femur and liver. In addition, there were more
histological alterations (e.g., spindle and stellate cells
under epidermis layer and thicker epidermis layer) in
the skin of rats treated with gadodiamide rats
compared with gadoteric acid treated rats.
Gadolinium deposited in the bone can persist long
term. Femoral head bone samples were collected from
patients who underwent total hip replacement surgery
up to 8 years after GBCA exposure (Darrah et al.
2009). Gadolinium bone concentrations were com-
pared between bones from those patients exposed to
GBCAs and those who were not. High concentrations
of gadolinium were observed in the bone tissue from
GBCA-exposed patients even when taking into
account the bone-incorporation of gadolinium from
natural sources. The observed bone deposition was
seen in bone collected even 8 years after GBCA
exposure. The gadolinium deposition levels did not
correlate with the amount of time that elapsed since
exposure.
These studies demonstrate that gadolinium can
accumulate in tissues regardless of renal function.
Whether the accumulated gadolinium is free Gd3? or
chelated is not completely clear. However, adminis-
tration of GBCAs with higher dissociation constants
(i.e., linear GBCAs) is associated with higher tissue
accumulation. Therefore, the possibility that the
accumulated gadolinium is free Gd3? should be
strongly considered, as well as the potential toxico-
logical effects.
Gadolinium-based contrast agent toxicity data
Data linking GBCA exposure with toxicological
endpoints (apart from NSF in individuals with severe
renal impairment) is limited. Although the toxicity of
free lanthanide ions is well known (Haley et al. 1961;
Spencer et al. 1998, 1997; Yoneda et al. 1995), the
mechanism of GBCA toxicity in people with renal
impairment is not fully elucidated. Further, the
mechanism of gadolinium dissociation and subsequent
exposure of tissues to free Gd3? is not well described.
Reports from patients describing adverse effects after
repeated GBCA administration and study results
(in vitro, in vivo animal, and human case reports, see
Table 1) provide data that demonstrate the need to
further investigate the potential toxicity of GBCA
exposure in those with normal renal function.
A number of studies have demonstrated adverse
effects associated with GBCA exposure or adminis-
tration. Induction of necrosis and apoptosis by GBCA
exposure has been demonstrated in exposed renal
tubular cells in vitro (Heinrich et al. 2007). In a study
by Heinrick et al., confluent proximal tubular epithe-
lial cells (LLC-PK1 cells) were incubated for 24 h
with either control media (serum-free M199) or
different contrast agents, including GBCAs, at con-
centrations used for angiography. GBCAs induced
higher cytotoxicity than iodinated radiographic con-
trast media. Necrosis and apoptosis was induced by
gadopentetate
dimeglumine
and
apoptosis
was
observed in cells exposed to gadoterate meglumine.
Results from an in vivo study in pigs also demon-
strate the higher toxicity of GBCAs when compared to
iodine contrast agents (Elmstahl et al. 2006). Pigs were
injected, via the right renal artery, with various
concentrations of iodine contrast media (Mannitol/
iohexol) or GBCAs (gadopentetate dimeglumine,
gadodiamide). Gadopentetate and gadodiamide had
higher nephrotoxicity (reduced glomerular filtration

123
 rate) than iohexol. The acute nephrotoxic effect of
GBCA administration to humans has been demon-
strated in a case report by Akgun et al. A 56-year-old
woman with normal baseline renal function had 2
consecutive vascular imaging procedures employing
GBCA administration. A few days later, the patient
developed acute renal failure. A renal biopsy revealed
acute tubular necrosis (Akgun et al. 2006).
The effects of GBCA administration are not limited
to nephrotoxic effects. Histopathological and molec-
ular changes (apoptosis) in the liver, lungs, and kidney
tissues have been observed in GBCA-treated mice
(Chen et al. 2015). In a study reported by Chen et al.,
Balb/c mice were dosed IV with different contrast
agents, including gadopentetate dimeglumine. The
studied GBCA induced a number of changes including
reduction in total white blood cell count, increases in
serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and
TNF-R), and hepatic histopathologic changes (vacuo-
lar
degeneration,
disorganized
hepatic
cords).
Gadolinium-induced recurrent acute pancreatitis was
reported
in
a
58-year-old
woman
administered
gadobenate dimeglumine for MRI (Blasco-Perrin
et al. 2013). Pancreatitis ensued approximately 3 h
after initial GBCA exposure and upon repeated
dosing. Another case report demonstrates the onset
of pancreatitis after GBCA administration (Erenoglu
et al. 2007). A previously asymptomatic 45-year old
woman experienced upper abdominal pain and vom-
iting 4 h after cranial MRI with gadodiamide. Twelve
hours after the onset of her abdominal symptoms, an
MRI was performed that revealed severe necrotizing
pancreatitis requiring surgical intervention.
The neurotoxic potential of GBCA administration
has also been demonstrated. In a study to determine
the potential for gadolinium-induced neurotoxicity,
male rats received gadopentetate dimeglumine via
injection into the lateral ventricle. This produced acute
neurotoxicity manifested as myoclonus, ataxia, and
tremor. Behavioral effects and morphological abnor-
malities (hemorrhage and damage to the corpus
callosum) were also induced (Ray et al. 1996). Hui
reports the development of encephalopathy in a
woman who received a GBCA for MRI (Hui and
Mullins
2009).

Review of gadolinium biochemical and molecular
mechanisms of action
Significant data regarding brain and other tissue
accumulation of gadolinium are now available. How-
ever, the clinical significance of this phenomenon is
not fully understood. This effort can be facilitated by a
better understanding of the mechanisms associated
with the development of gadolinium-induced toxico-
logical endpoints such as NSF. Mechanistic data is
crucial to determine therapeutic and preventive mea-
sures to treat and reduce the risk of adverse events
associated with GBCA exposure.

 Various studies (summarized in Table 2) have
suggested the role of apoptosis, oxidative stress,
transmetallation, and competition of Gd3? with Ca2?
for cellular processes. In a review by Ide
´e, dechelation
leading to the release of free Gd3? may lead to the
release of chemokines and subsequent attraction of
CD34 ? fibrocytes followed by the development of
fibrosis (Idee et al. 2014). Galdo et al. also attributes
the release of chemokines to the pathogenesis of NSF
(Del Galdo et al. 2010). Activated macrophages were
exposed in vitro to 50 mM gadodiamide. This induced
significant increases in chemokine gene expression.
The chemokine gene expression was found to be
dependent on NFkappaB activation.
Newton and Jimenez studied the role of macro-
phages in NSF pathogenesis. There may be a direct
profibrotic and proinflammatory effect of the chelated
gadolinium in macrophages. They review the results
of studies conducted in human peripheral blood
monocytes exposed to varying concentrations of

 GBCAs or GdCl3. Real-time PCR was used to
determine gene expression of various cytokines.
Gadodiamide and gadopentetate were found to stim-
ulate the expression and release of the cytokines
involved in the development of tissue fibrosis.
Wermuth and Jimenez also studied the effects of
GBCAs treatment on monocytes with the objective of
measuring the levels of various interleukins, TGF-b,
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the
gadodiamide-treated monocytes (Wermuth and Jime-
nez 2014). They also treated human dermal fibroblasts
with conditioned media from monocytes exposed to
GBCAs. They observed increased IL-4, IL-6, IL-13,
and VEGF expression in the GBCA-treated mono-
cytes. Types I and II collagen expression was elevated
in fibroblasts that were cultured with monocyte
supernatant. Their data suggest that GBCAs (regard-
less of chelate class) induce expression of a number of
profibrotic chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors
in normal human monocytes. Therefore, GBCA
stability may not be the main factor associated with
the development of NSF.
One well-recognized factor related to the toxicity of
Gd3? is its size similarity and resulting competition
with Ca2? in cellular and biochemical processes. It is
capable of inhibiting stretch-activated and voltage-
gated calcium channels. As such, Gd3? can cause
inhibition of vital physiologic processes associated
with (but not limited to) muscle tissue and neurons. It
can also block Ca2?-dependent enzymes such S-trans-
ferases, dehydrogenases, kinases, ATPase, and glu-
tathione (Laine et al. 1994; Mlinar and Enyeart 1993;
Ramalho and Semelka 2015).
Do et al. provides data that suggest that the
induction of fibronectin expression in fibroblasts is
involved in the pathogenesis of NSF (Do et al. 2014).
The in vitro (human foreskin fibroblasts) and in vivo
(rats) consisted of exposure of the test subjects to
GBCA with low (gadodiamide) or high (gadoteridol)
thermodynamic
stability
constants.
Gadodiamide
induces fibronectin expression in the cultured fibrob-
lasts. Also, gadodiamide appears to cause both apop-
tosis and necrosis in the fibroblasts. For the rat study,
fibrocyte markers (CD34 and procollagen type I) are
induced by GBCAs in skin. Both gadodiamide and
gadoteridol had similar toxicology profiles and led to
proximal tubule vacuolization. The data suggest that
chelates with low thermodynamic stability constants
are more likely to induce NSF.
Studies by Bose et al., indicate that iron participates
in GBCA-toxicity mechanisms. Gadolinium-based
contrast agent administration induces mobilization of
iron and differentiation of peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells into ferroportin-expressing fibrocytic cells
(Bose et al. 2015). In chronic renal disease–induced
mice injected with gadodiamide, iron chelator therapy
with deferiprone was found to prevent gadodiamide-
induced NSF. This was evidence by a decrease in skin
lesions such as redness, hair loss, and ulceration, and
these effects were confirmed via histopathological
analysis. Biopsy measurements showed reduced skin
thickness in mice treated with gadodiamide and
deferiprone when compared with the gadodiamide-
only treated mice. There was also a reduction in
markers CD163 and procollagen after deferiprone
treatment. An increase in cells positive for ferroportin
was observed with gadodiamide injections; this was
reduced with deferiprone treatment.
Deferiprone treatment inhibited gadodiamide-in-
duced differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells into fibrocyte-like cells. It also decreased the
release of catalytic iron by cells treated with gadodi-
amide. This data suggest that iron is involved in the
pathogenesis of NSF in mice with chronic renal
failure.
Mizgerd et al. studied the effects of on rat alveolar
macrophages in vitro (Mizgerd et al. 1996). Different
concentrations of gadolinium trichloride was added to
the cell wells and incubated for different durations (0,
8, 16, or 24 h). Morphological, DNA, and flow
cytometry data showed evidence of apoptotic cell
death in the treated cells. Electron spectroscopy
confirmed intracellular localization of gadolinium.
Another role of apoptosis in gadolinium toxicity is its
induction in hepatocytes (which also occurs subse-
quent to lanthanum and ytterbium exposure). This
induction of apoptosis in hepatocytes may be related to
elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (Liu et al.
2003).
Gadolinium chloride causes in vitro neurotoxicity.
Xia et al. conducted in vitro studies with neurons from
rat brains (Xia et al. 2011). The neurons were treated
with gadolinium chloride for different time periods.
The gadolinium treatment reduced neuron cell viabil-
ity and disrupted intracellular calcium homeostasis.
As in studies with a human hepatocyte cell line,
gadolinium causes an elevation in reactive oxygen
species levels. Expression levels of endoplasmic
Biometals (2016) 29:365–376

123
 reticulum stress genes (e.g., XBP1) were analyzed and
found to be elevated in gadolinium-exposed cells.
Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine pretreatment inhibits
gadolinium-induced cell death and endoplasmic retic-
ulum stress further indicating a role of reactive oxygen
species in gadolinium-induced toxicity.
Gadolinium blocks ATP and ADP hydrolysis,
increases the vascular reactivity of rat aortic rings to
phenylephrine via stimulation of angiotensin II AT1
receptors, and reduces nitric oxide bioavailability
(Angeli et al. 2011). Incubation of rat aortic rings in
3 lM gadolinium results in an increase in ATP-
induced vasorelaxation, indicating a reduction in ATP
hydrolysis. The data from this study suggests that
gadolinium induces endothelial dysfunction in rat
aortic segments of rats by activation of ACE. This then
leads to the release of vasoconstrictors from the
endothelium. Corot et al. investigated transmetallation
between marketed GBCAs and zinc-dependent angio-
tensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Both in vitro (rabbit
lung ACE) and in vivo (rats) studies were conducted to
determine the differences in the inhibition of ACE
activity between the various GBCA forms. The in vitro
studies showed a dose-dependent inhibition of ACE
activity by the two linear GBCAs studied. For rats
injected with a given GBCA, ACE activity was
assayed in plasma, and the urinary zinc excretion
was measured. The results for these studies showed
inhibition of ACE by the linear, but not the macro-
cyclic GBCAs (Corot et al. 1998).
A 55-year-old man developed myelopathy, and
progressive neurologic symptoms including hand and
foot numbness, gait ataxia, and weakness in the
extremities. A year after the onset of neurologic
symptoms, serum zinc levels were found to be
elevated and a diagnosis of idiopathic zinc toxicity
was made. During the evaluation periods, the patient
underwent MRI imaging examinations using gadopen-
tetate dimeglumine. Urine analyses of several ele-
ments
(including
gadolinium)
were
performed
periodically during chelation therapy to monitor zinc
removal. After 2 years of periodic chelation therapy,
gadolinium retention was evident. It was also found
that the patient had long-term use of a dental product
that contained high levels of zinc. Therefore, the
chronic zinc toxicity contributed to tissue retention of
gadolinium due to transmetallation (Greenberg 2010).
Data from studies by Taupitz suggest that compet-
itive chelation with the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
heparin in the extracellular matrix may affect tissue
distribution and toxicity of GBCAs (Taupitz et al.
2013). The researchers incubated three linear GBCAs
(Omniscan, OptiMARK, and Magnevist) for 2 h in
heparin at 37 �C in the presence of ZnCl2. This led to
an increase in T1-relaxivity for each GBCA. Also,
incubation of three macrocyclic complexes (Gadovist,
Dotarem, and Prohance) in heparin led to minor
increases in T1-relaxivity. However, no differences in
relaxivity between linear and macrocyclic GBCAs
were observed when ZnCl2 was not present. It is
possible that transchelation of Gd3? from GBCA
complexes to GAGs may contribute to Gd3? retention
and NSF-related inflammatory processes.
Toxicity of other lanthanide complexes
In light of the modest amount and still emerging data
regarding the toxicity of gadolinium complexes, it is
useful to examine toxicity data regarding other
lanthanide series elements given their chemical and
physical similarity to gadolinium. A number of
lanthanide series element complexes have been stud-
ied and found to deposit in tissues and contribute to
toxicity. Nanoceria infusion in rats is associated with
an increase in hepatic apoptosis (Tseng et al. 2014).
Tseng et al. performed studies to determine the
toxicologic potential of nanoceria given the human
industrial exposure and its development as a thera-
peutic agent. Rats were infused with nanoceria (or
water) via femoral vein cannula. The rats were
sacrificed at different time points up to 90 days after
the infusion. Histopathological, immunohistochem-
istry, serum biochemistry, and electron microscopy
analyses were performed on rat tissues. The ceria
caused Kupffer cell surface bulging and cellular
enlargement. Granulomata were seen in rats sacrificed
30 and 90 days post infusion. Hepatic cell apoptosis
and liver cell proliferation increased subsequent to
nanoceria infusion. Gadolinium also affects Kupffer
cells and may have other hepatic effects.
Europium-doped
gadolinium
oxide
nanotubes
(Gd2O3:Eu3?) has the potential for use as a multi-
modal contrast agent because of its superparamag-
netism and T1 relaxation characteristics. Since these
can accumulate in the bone, Jin et al. studied these
nanotubes for their potential to adversely affect bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) (Jin et al. 2015).
372
Biometals (2016) 29:365–376
123
 Europium-doped gadolinium oxide nanotubes were
added to female mouse BMSC cultures for 24 h. Cell
viability, apoptosis, and membrane integrity were
assessed. Mitochondrial membrane potential, lyso-
some permeability, and reactive oxygen species
measurements were also made.
Cell
viability
was
adversely
affected
by
Gd2O3:Eu3?, and the percent of apoptotic and late
necrotic cells increased with Gd2O3:Eu3? treatment.
There was also loss of BMSC membrane integrity
associated with Gd2O3:Eu3? treatment. Mitochon-
drial damage was involved in Gd2O3:Eu3 ? nan-
otube-induced necrosis in BMSCs, and exposed cells
underwent substantial DNA damage. GBCAs are also
found to accumulate in bone tissue. Therefore, the
potential effects on BMSC should be considered and
investigated.
Samarium, another lanthanide series element, is
also toxic in its free ionic form. Samarium nitrate
elicits reproductive toxicity in male mice treated for
90 days (Zhang et al. 2014). Specifically, the treat-
ment was associated with disorganized seminiferous
tubules,
reduction
in
spermatogenic
cells,
and
decreased sperm count. It appears that the testis may
be a target organ of samarium toxicity, while gadolin-
ium has various effects including nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity.
Discussion
There is significant in vitro, animal, and human data
available that indicates the potential for adverse
effects in people who have multiple or recurrent
exposures to GBCAs. Studies over the years have
demonstrated the possible mechanisms that contribute
to some GBCA-induced endpoints such as NSF.
Although gadolinium deposition is now well estab-
lished to occur despite normal renal function, it is not
known if the gadolinium retained in tissue is in the
chelated or free ion form. Prospective studies incor-
porating measurement of serum and urine Gd3? levels
can help correlate the Gd3? body burden with MRI
T-weighted intensity data. Detection of persistent
Gd3? that is higher than background for those exposed
to GBCAs will provide more insight into the associ-
ation of abnormal health effects that occur subsequent
to GBCA exposure. Retrospective cohort studies will
also add a valuable set of data and information to
determine adverse effects potential of GBCAs. This
information along with the growing body of mecha-
nistic data can allow the development of therapeutic
and preventative measures.
The results of a patient advocacy group-initiated
survey of 17 patients (Gadoliniumtoxicity.com) show
the onset of a group of symptoms within a month of
their last MRI (Gadolinium Toxicity: A Survey of the
Chronic Effects of Retained Gadolinium from Con-
trast MRIs 2015). These symptoms range from
neurological, musculoskeletal, to dermal, including
pain (reported by 100 % of patients surveyed), muscle
symptoms reported by 88 %, and ocular symptoms
(reported by 76 %). For each additional symptom
category (e.g., dermal, cognitive, ENT), more than
50 % of those surveyed reported symptoms in each of
these and other categories. Notably, 15 of the 17
patients surveyed had urinary gadolinium levels above
expected levels for patients with normal renal function
(reference range is 0.0–0.4 mcg Gd/24-h). This
information can serve as a guide for retrospective
and prospective studies to determine associations
between multiple GBCA administration and adverse
health effects.
Studies regarding specific cytotoxic and other
adverse outcomes from non-gadolinium lanthanide
elements can also be considered when assessing the
toxicity potential of GBCAs. Cerium, samarium, and
europium have very similar biologic and chemical
characteristics to gadolinium. These affect some of the
same biochemical/molecular processes such as induc-
tion of apoptosis and necrosis, oxidative stress, and
competition with Ca2?. Comparisons between the
level of tissue retention (such as that measured in
biopsied tissues when feasible) and urine gadolinium
level, particularly in those who receive repeated
GBCA administration, can also provide additional
data and insight regarding tissue sources of free Gd3?.
This may be done by measuring the level of gadolin-
ium excretion over time and concurrently measuring
the level of tissue gadolinium–deposit detection via
biopsy if feasible (Thakral et al. 2007; Xia et al. 2010)
or the use of T1-weighted MRI to determine if the
gadolinium tissue-level changes correspond to excre-
tion levels.
Studies to distinguish between chelated and Gd3?
levels and considering the mechanistic data is neces-
sary to determine the best therapeutic and preventive
measures for GBCA-related health effects. Thus far, it

 has been determined that deferiprone protects against
GBCA-induced NSF in mice. If GBCA administration
is the best option for a given patient, a pretreatment
approach that protects against toxicological endpoints
may be a viable option. A compound that can
effectively compete with Gd3? may be an approach
to reduce any Gd3? retained by the body. N-acetyl-
cysteine pretreatment inhibits gadolinium-induced
cell death and endoplasmic reticulum stress in vitro.
It also protects against GBCA-induced nephrotoxicity
in rats with chronic renal failure (Pereira et al. 2012).
Chelators used for iron chelation therapy may have
efficacy for gadolinium chelation. Examples are
deferoxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox. In a case
report of a 65-year-old woman with confirmed NSF,
deferoxamine was administered intramuscularly at
500 mg/day, and then 1 week later at 1000 mg/day.
While deferoxamine doubled urinary excretion of
gadolinium, serum levels did not reduce significantly.
The authors estimated that at the deferoxamine-
induced increased rate of excretion, it would still take
78–156 years to rid the patient of all gadolinium.
Therefore, a search for a stronger chelator was
recommended (Leung et al. 2009). Chelators for
mercury and lead toxicity can be investigated to
determine the most efficient option for the chelation of
rare earth elements (Flora and Pachauri 2010).
Nanoparticles linked to chelators have been proposed
as a treatment for Alzheimer disease to remove metals
from neural tissue. This could serve as another
approach to reduce the level of Gd3? in various
tissues, especially given the ability to cross the blood–
brain barrier to chelate metals in brain tissue, followed
by clearing the tissue of the nanoparticle-chelator-
metal complexed molecule (Liu et al. 2005).
Conclusions
Unequivocal data regarding the effects of multiple
GBCA exposure are limited. However, the informa-
tion regarding the thermodynamic stability constants
for GBCAs, in vitro, animal, and human data, and the
emerging data regarding gadolinium tissue accumu-
lation in those with normal kidney function indicate
that the potential toxicity associated with GBCA must
be seriously and urgently considered. This concept
must be addressed with retrospective and prospective
cohort
studies.
Research
providing
additional
mechanistic data is also paramount and will provide
valuable
information
regarding
how
to
prevent
GBCA-related toxicity, treat existing GBCA-related
health issues, guide the use of existing GBCAs, and
direct the design of safer MRI contrast agents.
