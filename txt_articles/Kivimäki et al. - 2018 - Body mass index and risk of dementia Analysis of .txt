Abstract
Introduction: Higher midlife body mass index (BMI) is suggested to increase the risk of dementia,
but weight loss during the preclinical dementia phase may mask such effects.
Methods: We examined this hypothesis in 1,349,857 dementia-free participants from 39 cohort
studies. BMI was assessed at baseline. Dementia was ascertained at follow-up using linkage to
electronic health records (N 5 6894). We assumed BMI is little affected by preclinical
dementia when assessed decades before dementia onset and much affected when assessed
nearer diagnosis.
Results: Hazard ratios per 5-kg/m2 increase in BMI for dementia were 0.71 (95% confidence
interval 5 0.66–0.77), 0.94 (0.89–0.99), and 1.16 (1.05–1.27) when BMI was assessed 10 years,
10-20 years, and .20 years before dementia diagnosis.

 Conclusions: The association between BMI and dementia is likely to be attributable to two different
processes: a harmful effect of higher BMI, which is observable in long follow-up, and a reverse-
causation effect that makes a higher BMI to appear protective when the follow-up is short.

1. Introduction
The costs of dementia are enormous and increasing glob-
ally [1]. Current clinical guidelines for dementia prevention
view obesity as one of the modifiable risk factors [2,3], but
the evidence is based on a relatively limited number of
observational studies and the findings are mixed [4–12].
The most recent meta-analysis, including 4 studies and
16,282 participants, suggested a 1.4-fold increased risk of
dementia in the obese [9]. The largest study in the field, pub-
lished after the inclusion date for the meta-analysis, found no
increase in dementia incidence among the obese [13]. On the
contrary, higher body mass index (BMI) was linked to lower
dementia risk.
The reasons for this discordance in findings are unclear.
One possibility is that the observed association between
BMI and dementia is attributable to two processes: one is
a direct association between higher BMI and increased de-
mentia risk, and the other is an association confounded by
weight loss during the preclinical dementia phase, which
leads a harmful exposure to appear protective via reverse
causation (Fig. 1). This hypothesis is supported by the fact
that clinical diagnosis of dementia is often preceded by a
long (20–30 years) preclinical phase [14–17] during which
cardiometabolic
changes,
including
weight
loss,
are
common [5,6,18,19]. Thus, lower BMI close to dementia
onset might be a consequence of preclinical disease rather
than a cause
of dementia. The investigations [4–7]
supporting this two-process hypothesis are based on small
numbers (N , 3000) and thus vulnerable to random errors.
A further limitation is that these studies did not directly seek
to determine the etiological phase at exposure measurement
by stratifying the analyses by the length of follow-up be-
tween the assessment of BMI and dementia onset.
The purpose of the present analyses was to investigate the
BMI-dementia association using raw unpublished data from
over 1.3 million adults from Europe, the United States, and
Asia. To separate direct and biased associations, we stratified
the analysis by duration of follow-up. We assumed that BMI
is little affected by preclinical dementia when the BMI
assessment is long before dementia onset and is considerably
affected when BMI is assessed nearer the diagnosis.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
We searched the Individual-Participant Data Meta-
analysis in Working Populations (IPD-Work) consortium
[20,21], the Inter-University Consortium for Political and
Social Research (www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR),
and the UK Data Service (http://ukdataservice.ac.uk) to
identify eligible large-scale prospective cohort studies for
which data on BMI and dementia were available. We
included 39 prospective cohort studies from Europe, the
United States, and Asia (Appendix 1), which comprised a to-
tal of 1,349,857 participants with no history of dementia;
were population based with BMI assessed from all partici-
pants before the ascertainment of dementia; recorded
hospital-treated dementia or dementia deaths; and had
accrued a minimum of 3 years of follow-up.
2.2. Measurements
Height and weight at baseline were measured in 11
studies and self-reported in 28 (Appendix 1, avaliable in
the online Supplementary Materials). BMI was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
We assessed the following baseline covariates because they
are known to be associated with BMI and dementia risk: ed-
ucation/socioeconomic position (harmonized into high, in-
termediate, and low), smoking (current smoker vs. other),
and prevalent cardiometabolic disease (coronary heart dis-
ease, stroke, and diabetes; one or more vs. none) [2,3].
We obtained information about dementia status at follow-
up from national death and hospital admission registries,
reimbursements for medical treatment of dementia, and

 surveys on physician-diagnosed diseases, although the exact
definition varied between the studies (Appendix 1). We used
all underlying diagnoses in electronic medical records. In
line with the National Health Service’s recommendations,
dementias were denoted by International Classification of
Diseases (10th revision) codes ICD-10 F00, F01, F03,
G30, and G31 [22,23].
2.3. Statistical analysis
We used a two-step individual-participant data meta-
analysis including study-specific analyses in the first step
and pooling the study-specific estimates in the second. In
each study, we performed Cox regression to generate hazard
ratios and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
the association between BMI and dementia. In the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the National Health and
Nutrition Survey (NHANES), and the Health and Retire-
ment Study (HRS) [24–27], appropriate sampling weights
were used. As one study was based on twins [28], individual
observations were not independent, and we therefore used
Cox regression with cluster information to get robust stan-
dard error estimates applying Breslow’s method for handling
ties. In all studies, each participant was followed up from the
date of BMI assessment to the first record of dementia,
death, or the end of follow-up.
In the basic Cox model, BMI was included as a contin-
uous variable to allow inclusion of studies with few dementia
cases (minimum 10). As in previous large-scale pooled ana-
lyses [29–31], hazard ratios were expressed per 5-unit (kg/
m2) increase in BMI, which represents the increase in rela-
tive risk associated with moving up one BMI category
(e.g., from healthy weight to overweight or from overweight
to obese). Age at BMI assessment, sex, and ethnicity were
included as covariates. Additional adjustments were under-
taken for education/socioeconomic status, smoking, and
prevalent cardiometabolic disease.
To study reverse causation bias, we excluded the first years
of follow-up [32], using a standard procedure in epidemi-
ology, which involves increasing the length of time (follow-
up) between measurement of the exposure and the outcome,
thus reducing the likelihood that BMI levels are affected by
preclinical dementia. Initially, we excluded the first 5 years
of follow-up and then progressively increased the exclusion
period in 5-year increments up to an exclusion period of
20 years. We expected these analyses to provide estimates
increasingly less affected by reverse causation. In a second
set of analyses, we examined the BMI-dementia association
by follow-up time. To ensure sufficient numbers in these strat-
ified analyses, we divided follow-up time into three 10-year
categories: ,10 years, 10–20 years, and .20 years after base-
line. The first category includes BMI measurements during
the preclinicalphase ofdementia, whereasinthelast category,
most BMI assessments are likely to be before this stage.
Studies with dementia death as outcome are vulnerable to
ascertainment bias if the exposure (BMI) is associated with sur-
vival. For example, participants who died before the age of
late-onset dementia (65 years) have less opportunity to receive
a diagnosis of dementia than those who live longer. In contrast,
participants dying around the median age of dementia
recording (85 years in this study), have increased opportunities
to be diagnosed with dementia. To study this bias, we exam-
ined whether BMI was associated with mortality before the
age of 65 years and mortality after the age of 85 years [33].
In addition, we repeated the main analyses excluding dementia
cases ascertained from death registries only.
We used SAS (version 9.4) or Stata (MP version 13.1) to
analyze the study-specific data. In the second step of the
analysis, we used meta-analysis to combine study-specific
estimates. To provide conservative estimates and take into
account that the associations are not necessarily similar
across cohort studies, we present the summary hazard ratios
from the random-effect analysis. We examined heterogene-
ity of the study-specific estimates with the I2 statistic (higher
values denote greater heterogeneity). We used Stata (MP,
version 13.1) to compute the meta-analysis.
3. Results
Descriptive characteristics for each cohort study are pro-
vided in Appendix 1. The weighted mean follow-up across
studies was 16.1 years and ranged from 4.3 to 37.7 years.
Over the 21,798,141 person-years at risk in 1,349,857 partic-
ipants, 6894 incident dementia cases were recorded. Overall,
we observedan inverse association between BMI and demen-
tia. The age-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratio per
5-unit increase in BMI was 0.87 (95% CI 5 0.82–0.93). An
I2 statistic of 65.9% indicated significant heterogeneity in the

 study-specific hazard ratios (P ,.0001). To further examine
this association, we undertook four sets of analyses.
3.1. Incremental exclusions to the follow-up
We performed a detailed analysis of incremental exclu-
sions to the follow-up period (Table 1). To assess BMI before
the preclinical phase, we excluded up to 20 years of the
follow-up (the numbers of participants and dementia cases
in these analyses are shown in Appendix 1). With the pro-
gressive exclusions of follow-up, the magnitude of the
BMI-dementia association changed in a stepwise manner
such that the hazard ratio for higher BMI and reduced de-
mentia risk was first attenuated to the null and then increased
significantly above 1.0, suggesting higher BMI to be associ-
ated with greater risk of dementia (Fig. 2A, study-specific
estimates in Appendix 2). The age-, sex-, and ethnicity-
adjusted hazard ratios per 5-unit increase in BMI were
0.87, 0.92, 0.99, 1.06, and 1.16 after excluding the first
0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years of follow-up. The last estimate,

 20 years of follow-up, was robust to further adjustments for
potential confounders, including education/socioeconomic
status, smoking, and cardiometabolic disease at baseline
(Table 2). Furthermore, in these analyses, there was no
evidence of heterogeneity in the study-specific effect esti-
mates. Galbraith plots in Appendix 3 confirmed that no sin-
gle study or studies drove these associations.
We repeated the age-, sex-, and ethnicity-adjusted ana-
lyses using BMI categories (Fig. 3). Without exclusions of
the follow-up period, the highest hazard ratio was observed
for underweight (BMI , 20 kg/m2; 1.22, 95% CI 5 1.06–
1.41, P 5 .005), the lowest for obesity (BMI � 30 kg/m2;
0.84, 95% CI 5 0.75–0.94, P 5 .002), and overweight
(BMI 5 25–29.9 kg/m2; 0.83, 95% CI 5 0.77–0.90,
P , .0001). This ordering was reversed when we sought to
reduce reverse causation bias by excluding 20 years of the
follow-up.
Assuming that less biased effect estimates are observed af-
ter the exclusion of cases with BMI assessment close to
dementia diagnosis (i.e., during the preclinical phase), the
opposite associations before and after exclusions support the
hypothesis that the BMI-dementia association is attributable
to two processes, a direct effect and reverse causation.
3.2. Analysis stratified by follow-up time
In the second set of analyses, we examined stratification by
follow-up. Fig. 4A shows a forest plot for the association of
BMI with dementia risk during the first 10 years, 10–20 years,
and more than 20 years after baseline (study-specific results in
Appendix 4). The corresponding age-, sex-, and ethnicity-
adjusted summary hazard ratios were 0.71 (95% CI 5 0.66–
0.77, P , .0001), 0.94 (95% CI 5 0.89–0.99, P 5 .02), and
1.16 (95% CI 5 1.05–1.27, P 5 .004), respectively. The latter
hazard ratiowas 1.14 (95% CI 5 1.04–1.25, P 5.02) in studies
with measured weight and height and 1.09 (95% CI 5 0.99–
1.19, P 5 .07) in studies with self-reported weight and height,
suggesting that the result does not significantly vary by the
method of BMI assessment. The increasing strength of the as-
sociation between higher BMI and dementia as the length of
follow-up increases and the diagnosis of dementia is increas-
ingly distant from the assessment of BMI is consistent with
the hypothesis that the harmful effect of a higher BMI becomes
evident after removal of reverse causation bias.
3.3. Sensitivity analyses
We performed a series of sensitivity analyses with mortal-
ity as the outcome to examine potential ascertainment bias
(Appendix 5). In most data sets included in this study,
dementia cases included those ascertained using death cer-
tificates; thus, dementia could be ascertained only in partic-
ipants who died. Higher baseline BMI was associated with
higher overall mortality before the age of 65 years (when de-
mentia is still rare) and lower mortality after 85 years (the
median age of dementia diagnosis in this study). These find-
ings suggest that survival bias, if anything, underestimates
the status of high BMI as a risk factor.
To further examine the robustness of our findings, we
repeated the main analyses after excluding 34 studies where
dementia was ascertained only using death certificates. In to-
tal, 437 dementia cases in five studies (total N 5 95,851)
were ascertained using data other than death certificates.
The pattern of results in the main analyses was replicated.
In fact, the hazard ratios per 5-unit increase in BMI were
slightly higher: 0.92, 0.99, 1.11, 1.17 and 1.33 after
excluding the first 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years of follow-up
(Fig. 2B; study-specific findings in Appendix 6). Higher ef-
fect estimates in Fig. 2B, corresponding to approximately
one 5-year exclusion, are expected given that dementia is re-
corded first in morbidity data and only later in mortality data
(Fig. 2A). In analysis stratified by duration of follow-up, the
hazard ratio per 5-unit increase in BMI was 0.72 during the
first 10 years of follow-up, 0.98 between 10 and 20 years,
and 1.33 more than 20 years after baseline, again replicating
findings in the main analysis (Fig. 4B, Appendix 6).

 4. Discussion
In this collaborative study of over 1.3 million adults from
Europe, the United States, and Asia, higher BMI was associ-
ated with increased dementia risk when weight was
measured .20 years before dementia diagnosis, but this as-
sociation was reversed when BMI was assessed ,10 years
before dementia diagnosis.
Thefindings ofthisstudy are consistentwiththe hypothesis
that the BMI-dementia association is attributable to two pro-
cesses: a direct (causal) effect and reverse causation as a result
of weight loss during the preclinical dementia phase. Analyses
stratifiedbydurationoffollow-upofferedanapproachtostudy
this because BMI assessment long before dementia onset is
more likely to reflect a causal process, whereas BMI assess-
ment near dementia onset is likely to be biased by preclinical
dementia. Consistent with this hypothesis, higher BMI
increased
dementia
risk
when
weight
was
measured
.20 years before dementia diagnosis (typically in midlife)
but was associated with reduced risk when BMI was assessed
,10 years before dementia diagnosis (i.e., typically in old
age). This pattern of results was replicated in analyses serially
excluding the first years of follow-up.
Our findings are in agreement with the most recent system-
atic review and meta-analysis, published in 2016, which iden-
tified four cohort studies with BMI assessed in midlife and
incident dementia ascertained at older ages by clinical exam-
inations at follow-up [9]. Although this is not a universal
observation [34,35], the summary relative risk of dementia
for obesity compared with normal weight in midlife was
significantly elevated. In the Cardiovascular Health Study of
2800 US adults, an increased risk of dementia was found
among those obese in midlife but was reversed for late-life
BMI [5], a finding replicated in the CAIDE study of 1300
Finnish adults [7]. In the Honolulu-Asian Aging Study of
2000 men, midlife BMI was nonsignificantly higher in indi-
viduals who subsequently developed dementia, but at older
ages, they lost weight and had a lower BMI than those who re-
mained free of dementia [4]. In the Gothenburg study of 1500
Swedish women, those who developed dementia had less in-
crease in BMI from age 38 to 70 years than those who re-
mained dementia free [6,36]. Our findings, based on data
from 1.3 million individuals from different regions of the
world, add to this evidence by demonstrating the reversion
of the BMI-dementia association as a function of decreasing
distance between BMI assessment and dementia onset (and
increasing impact of preclinical dementia).
Our use of electronic health records to ascertain dementia,
like all methods, has some advantages and disadvantages. An
advantage of this method is that there is virtually no loss to
follow-up and thus selection bias arising from differential
sample retention is avoided. For comparison, in studies that

 use repeated cognitive testing as part of dementia ascertain-
ment, dropout may be as high as 40% at examination, leading
to a significant cumulated sample attrition and therefore po-
tential bias [9]. A disadvantage of electronic health records,
however, is that they are unlikely to capture all dementia cases
[37,38]. In particular, studies where dementia outcomes are
based on mortality data are not complete as they are based
only on deceased patients and, even for them, dementia
recording is delayed by the 3- to 9-year median lag between
the clinical onset of dementia and death [39,40]. Other
concerns include the possibility that dementia as a cause of
death is listed only among those who have experienced
weight
loss
(“wasting”)
before
death
as
this
would
contribute to overestimation of a reverse causation effect.
Asthe present meta-analysis isbased ona series of studies in
which investigators ascertained dementia in different ways, we
had the possibility to undertake a validation exercise. Thus, we
repeated the main analyses excluding dementia status drawn
from death certificates. The same pattern of results was evident
asinthe mainanalyses:higher BMI wasassociatedwithgreater
risk of dementia when BMI was measured many years before
dementia onset, whereas an inverse relationship was apparent
when BMI was measured closer to dementia ascertainment.
In analyses exploring survival bias, we found that higher base-
line BMI was associated with an increased risk of all-cause
mortality before the age of 65 years but lower mortality risk af-
ter the age of 85 years (the median age of dementia diagnosis).
These findings suggest that, comparedwith their normal weight
counterparts, obese individuals were less likely to live long
enough to develop dementia and more likely to die from condi-
tions that are known to be related to increased dementia risk,
such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [30,31,33,41].
Given these findings, differences in survival may have
contributed, if anything, to an underestimation of the strength
of the association between BMI and dementia.
Stratification and progressive exclusion to the follow-up
period to examine direct effect and reverse causation are, in
effect, subgroup analyses, raising the question as to whether
our findings could be an artifact of random variability as a
result of reduced sample size. However, the consistent step-
wise change in the BMI-dementia association at each addi-
tional exclusion of 5 years of the follow-up period in the
main and supplementary analyses suggests that random vari-
ability is an unlikely explanation of our findings.
Taken together, these findings provide new evidence for
the hypothesis that the association between BMI and demen-
tia is attributable to two distinct processes; one of which is a
harmful effect of higher BMI and the other reverse causation
bias contributing to an inverse association between BMI and
dementia. By dissecting these processes in stratified ana-
lyses, our study provides a plausible explanation for the in-
consistencies in some of the prior studies on BMI and
dementia. Further research is needed to examine underlying
mechanisms for weight loss during the preclinical stage,
including cognitive impairment leading to impaired self-
care, reduced appetite due to decreased olfactory perception
or changes in the regulation of satiety, and disturbed energy
homeostasis. Future studies should also examine whether the
role of BMI in dementia etiology varies between dementia
subtypes, such as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia,
frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: High body mass index (BMI) is
suggested to increase the risk of dementia, but evi-
dence is inconsistent. One hypothesis to explain
this inconsistency is that weight loss during the pre-
clinical phase of dementia biases the association,
such that studies with a short follow-up, which
assess BMI in late life, show that BMI has a pro-
tective association with dementia. However, few
studies have examined the importance of length of
follow-up and whether high BMI is more strongly
related to dementia when assessed before preclinical
dementia stage, that is, decades before dementia
onset, than when assessed near dementia onset.
2. Interpretation: We explored the BMI-dementia asso-
ciation using raw, unpublished data from 1.3 million
adults from Europe, the United States, and Asia. Our
findings from analyses stratified by duration offollow-
up lend support for a direct association between BMI
and dementia and also provide some support for
reverse causation. Higher BMI was associated with
increased dementia risk when BMI was assessed more
than 20 years before dementia diagnosis, but lower
BMI predicted dementia when BMI was assessed less
than 10 years before diagnosis.
3. Future directions: To avoid bias, the etiologic phase
should be taken into account in studies examining de-
mentia risk factors.
