The unfulfilled promise of the
antidepressant medications
W
e need more effective treatments for depres-
sion, because current treatments avert less
than half of the considerable burden caused by
the illness.1 Antidepressants are the most commonly used
medications, taken by 10% of adult Australians each day,
and at a rate that has more than doubled since 2000 to be
among the highest in the world.2 Two broad forces have
been argued to have driven this trend — in Australia, as in
other economically developed countries. First was the
broadening of the diagnostic concept of depression
with publication of the Diagnostic and statistical manual of
mental disorders, third edition (DSM-III) in 1980. Previ-
ously, depressive illness was considered to have two
subtypes — a “neurotic” illness that responded to
psychological therapies and a rarer melancholic depres-
sion that had a biological cause and responded to medi-
cations. But starting with the DSM-III, the distinction was
dropped and the categories were collapsed into the
broader “major depressive disorder”. This was followed
shortly afterwards by the release of the first selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — the short-lived
zimelidine in 1982, and then fluoxetine in 1986 — and
the ensuing cultural phenomenon that encouraged us to
think of depression as resulting from a chemical imbal-
ance that could be corrected with medication. Evidence
for depression being caused by a serotonin deficiency is
inconclusive and contested.3
The use of antidepressants has continued to rise despite
accumulating evidence that they are not as effective as
was previously thought. Recent meta-analyses show a
modest overall effect size of about 0.3 (although it is larger
in severe depression compared with mild depression).4
The overall effect size, while modest, is similar to that of
other treatments in medicine: of similar magnitude, for
example, to corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease.5 Earlier studies had reported much
largereffect sizes for themedications, in partdriven bythe
influences of the pharmaceutical industry on selective
publishing of positive results, and the substitution of
outcome measures to report ambiguous findings as pos-
itive.6 Revelations of these publication strategies have
done significant damage to the reputation of the medi-
cations and to the pharmaceutical companies who make
and market them.7
Antidepressant use in children and adolescents has
increased over the past two decades in the same way as it
has for the population in general,8 and similarly, meta-
analyses of their use in this group have shown smaller
effect sizes than had previously been reported.9 Rean-
alysis of previously published trial data has shown how
it was manipulated to inflate the effectiveness of the
medications — by substituting pre-specified outcome
measures with those more favourable to the trial medi-
cations.10 However, just as significantly, meta-analytic
approaches have confirmed what had previously been
suspected clinically: that antidepressants can induce an
increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours (although
not completed suicides) in some young patients.9 A
recent study reported that antidepressants can also
cause an increase in aggressive behaviour in children
and adolescents.11 Both problems are likely to be medi-
ated by the capacity of antidepressants to cause
increased agitation in some young people. Although
these problems are not common (the number needed to
treat for antidepressants in youth depression is 10, while
the number needed to harm, in terms of increased
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, is 1129), they should
be considered when assessing the potential benefits and
risks of using these medications in young patients.
The increasing power of placebos
Much effort has gone into delineating the reasons for the
apparent falling effectiveness of antidepressants. There
are likely to be multiple reasons, including the unearthing
of unpublished negative trial results for inclusion in meta-
analyses, thereby diluting the positive outcomes from
published studies,6 and the inclusion of more “real
Summary
� Australia has one of the highest rates of
antidepressant use in the world; it has more than
doubled since 2000, despite evidence showing that
the effectiveness of these medications is lower than
previously thought.
� An increasing placebo response rate is a key reason
for falling effectiveness, with the gap between
response to medications and placebo narrowing.
� Psychotherapies are effective treatments, but recent
evidence from high-quality studies suggests that
their effectiveness is also modest.
� Combined treatment with medication and
psychotherapy provides greater effectiveness than
either alone.
� The number of patients receiving psychotherapy had
been declining, although this trend is probably
reversing with the Medicare Better Access to Mental
Health Care initiative.
� Antidepressant medications still have an important
role in the treatment of moderate to severe
depression; they should be provided as part of an
overall treatment plan that includes psychotherapy
and lifestyle strategies to improve diet and increase
exercise.
� When medications are prescribed, they should be
used in a way that maximises their chance of
effectiveness.

 world” patients (those with comorbid conditions and
clinical complexity) in effectiveness trials. Perhaps the
culprit given most attention, however, is the increasing
rate of response to placebo, which is particularly high in
young people. The proportion of patients responding to
placebo has increased steadily over the past two decades,
leading to a narrowing of the gap between response to
medication and placebo.12 The placebo response is a
complicated phenomenon. In part, it is driven by a posi-
tive expectation bias, but it also illustrates the statistical
concept of regression to the mean, whereby patients with
depressive symptoms at baseline tend to recover over
time irrespective of treatment.
Why should these properties of the placebo be becoming
more powerful? It is not clear. One hypothesis is that since
the broadening of the diagnostic criteria for depression in
the DSM-III, patients with less severe symptoms have
been enrolled in treatment trials, and such patients are
more susceptible to the placebo response. While there is
some evidence for this,4 an analysis of severity cut-offs for
study entry showed that where these were higher (ie,
when depression had to be more severe for patients to be
included), the placebo response rate was even greater.13
An alternative explanation is that patients in more
recent trials have had a greater expectation that they will
get better with medication: the placebo response rate is
greatest in trials when the chance of receiving placebo is
low (ie, in multi-arm trials), and lowest in two-arm trials
when the chance is high, lending weight to this theory.14
The factors behind the increasing rate of response to
placebo, and consequent decreasing effectiveness of
medications, are evidently complicated.
Modest effect sizes are not confined
to antidepressants
Despite these concerns, antidepressant medications are
effective, even if only modestly so. Other treatments for
depression are also effective, although the most studied
of these — the psychotherapies — also have evidence of
declining effectiveness in more recently published
trials.15 Two particular psychotherapies have the most
favourable evidence: cognitive behavioural therapy
(CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Both are
structured, time-limited therapies that directly address
the core features of depression. While both psychother-
apies are effective, meta-analyses have shown that early
studies reported inflated effect sizes.16,17 The reasons for
this are clearer for psychotherapies than for medications.
Many psychotherapy trials, especially those conducted
earlier,
adopted
low-quality
methods
that
were
biased towards overestimating the interventions’ effects.
Many therapy trials enrolled non-clinical participants
(previously undiagnosed patients who scored above a
threshold on a rating instrument), used non-active con-
trol conditions (eg, patients on a waiting list), analysed
only
participants
who
had
completed
treatment
(rather than using the more rigorous intention-to-treat
principle), or did not use blinded assessors.16,17 The
effect size of high-quality psychotherapy trials (d ¼ 0.2)
is, consequently, less than a third of the effect size for low-
quality trials (d ¼ 0.7), and similar in magnitude to the
effect size for antidepressants.17
There has been a recent focus on exercise and diet as
potential interventions. While it is clear that exercise and
healthy eating are associated with good mental health, it
is less clear that they are effective interventions for
depression.18,19 One reason for this is that adherence to
exercise and diet plans is often insufficient to produce
improvement,19 and even when they are adhered to, the
effect sizes for such non-specific interventions are
unlikely to be large. While there is yet insufficient evi-
dence to suggest that exercise and dietary interventions
can be effective as stand-alone treatments, they are still
worth pursuing as adjunctive treatments — and the
evidence suggests that clinicians do not recommend them
often enough.20
Combined treatments
The modest effect sizes for depression treatments — and
there are no well-studied treatments for depression that
have large effect sizes — suggest that combining treat-
ments might provide the best outcomes for patients. The
combination of psychotherapy and medication is more
effective than either alone. In adults, the effect of com-
bined treatment compared with placebo is about twice
that of medication only compared with placebo.21
Combined treatment also seems to be more effective in
children and adolescents,22 although there have been
fewer studies in these groups. The effects of psychother-
apy and medication appear to operate independently of
each other,21 providing a good rationale for their
combination.
Despite the evidence of superior effectiveness for com-
bined treatments, recent reports suggest that psycho-
therapy is being offered less rather than more often, at
least in the United States. In the decade from 1998 to 2007,
the percentage of adult patients with depression who
were treated with psychotherapy declined from 54% to
43%.23 A similar decline was noted in children and ad-
olescents, although more recent evidence suggests that
this has been reversed with the increasing concerns
about the safety of medications.8 In Australia, while we
have clear evidence that the rate of antidepressant use is
increasing, we lack comparable data for the use of psy-
chotherapy. There are some promising signs that it is
becoming easier to access psychotherapy. The federal
government’s Better Access to Mental Health Care
scheme was introduced in 2006, and allows general
practitioners to refer depressed patients to qualified
therapists for up ten sessions of Medicare-funded treat-
ment. It has led to significant uptake and is helping to
reverse the trend,24 albeit with demographic distortions
in the groups who access the scheme. The uptake of
psychotherapy is disproportionately higher in wealthier
suburbs, and lowest in outer suburban and regional
communities where rates of depression are highest.24
And although the gender gap is narrowing, use of

 psychotherapy is still disproportionately higher among
women.25 While there is evidence that access to therapy
is improving, we are yet to see whether this is translating
into a reduction in the prevalence of depression.
An unfortunate nexus has developed between the diag-
nosis of depression of any severity and the reflexive pre-
scription of medications as monotherapy, for which the
medical profession must accept some responsibility.
There is a long tradition of medical psychotherapy —
important psychotherapies were developed by medical
practitioners such as Sigmund Freud, Aaron Beck (CBT),
and Gerald Klerman (IPT) — that seems to be in decline.
Fewer doctors now have the expertise to deliver psycho-
therapy, the teaching of which has been de-emphasised in
psychiatry training,26 and psychotherapy is now largely
the domain of psychologists, social workers, and other
health professionals. This appears to have had the effect
of encouraging
psychiatrists and other doctors to
consider medication, which is their area of expertise,
rather than psychotherapy as the first-line treatment for
depression.
Future directions
The pharmaceutical industry has scaled back invest-
ment in developing new drugs for mental illnesses,
mainly because of so many development failures,27 and
it is unlikely that we will see new medications with
substantially greater effectiveness in the coming years.
The psychotherapies too have their limitations, and
while they can be made more available, it is unlikely that
new forms of psychotherapy will be developed that will
have substantially greater effectiveness than existing
therapies.
Some psychiatrists and researchers argue that reinstating
melancholia as an illness, separate from neurotic depres-
sion, provides a solution to refining treatments.28 They
argue that melancholic depression shows a distinct and
selective response to antidepressant medications. Differ-
entiating the illness subtypes, however, was never as clear
in practice as some now argue. Australian psychiatrist, Sir
Aubrey Lewis, pointed out in 1934 that the separation
between the two was arbitrary — “a setting up of types or
ideal forms, a concession to the requirements of conve-
nient thinking in categories”29 — with most patients
showing aspects of both. The belief that melancholia
responds much better to medications has also not been
reliably confirmed. A recent large study could find no
difference in medication response between those with
and without melancholic symptoms.30
Major depressive disorder is undoubtedly a heteroge-
neous disorder, and clearer distinctions between sub-
types would make it easier to target treatments, but there
is little at present to guide us as to how best to make such
divisions. There is, however, a significant research effort
aimed at characterising treatment biomarkers — genetic,
brain
imaging
and
neuropsychological
parameters
that might predict a patient’s response to particular
treatments. With no likelihood that significantly better
treatments for depression will emerge in the near future,
better targeting of existing treatments towards patients
who are most likely to respond to them is probably our
best hope for improving treatment outcomes.
Treatment recommendations
While recent evidence might have tempered the initial
enthusiasm for antidepressants, these agents still have a
role in treating depression. Some patients show particu-
larly strong responses to the medications31 (although we
are not reliably able to predict who they will be), and there
is good evidence that antidepressants are effective in
preventing relapse of depression.32 The task for medical
practitioners now is to place antidepressant medications
in an overall treatment framework.
All patients should be offered psychotherapy where it is
available, and medication should be considered if
�
the depression is of at least moderate severity;
�
psychotherapy is refused; or
�
psychotherapy has not been effective.
When medications are prescribed, they should be used in
a way that maximises their chance of effectiveness. The
dose should be increased if there has been no improve-
ment after 4 to 6 weeks. The medication should be
changed if there has been no improvement after a subse-
quent 6 weeks. Usually, the medication should be
changed to another within the same class in the first
instance (eg, from an SSRI to an alternative SSRI), and to
an antidepressant of an alternative class (eg, from an SSRI
to a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, such as
venlafaxine) if a second change is required. If this strategy
is ineffective, more expert guidance is indicated: this
might include considering augmentation strategies, such
as lithium, or the use of neurostimulation (electrocon-
vulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation).33
At all stages, therapy with ineffective medications should
be ceased and unnecessary polypharmacy avoided.
Alongside these treatment strategies, we should continue
to recommend and encourage good eating and exercise,
both of which are likely to help engender a healthy mind
and a healthy body.
