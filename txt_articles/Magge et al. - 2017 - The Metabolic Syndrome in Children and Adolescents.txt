abstract
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was developed by the National Cholesterol 
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, identifying adults with at 
least 3 of 5 cardiometabolic risk factors (hyperglycemia, increased central 
adiposity, elevated triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure) who are at increased risk of 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The constellation of MetS component 
risk factors has a shared pathophysiology and many common treatment 
approaches grounded in lifestyle modification. Several attempts have been 
made to define MetS in the pediatric population. However, in children, the 
construct is difficult to define and has unclear implications for clinical care. 
In this Clinical Report, we focus on the importance of screening for and 
treating the individual risk factor components of MetS. Focusing attention 
on children with cardiometabolic risk factor clustering is emphasized over 
the need to define a pediatric MetS.

IntroductIon
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor clustering has been well 
recognized for decades in both children and adults, but it was not 
until 1988 when Gerald Reaven described a specific clustering of 
cardiometabolic risks as “syndrome X” that the concept that evolved 
into “the metabolic syndrome” (MetS) was born. Reaven’s syndrome 
X was an explanatory framework to understand the myriad effects of 
hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance on physiology, not a diagnostic 
category.1 His formulation of syndrome X described mechanisms 
underlying insulin resistance and the effects of hyperinsulinemia on 
glucose and lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and coronary artery 
disease risk. Over time, the risk factors associated with syndrome X 
grew to include other factors, such as central obesity, microalbuminuria, 
abnormalities in fibrinolysis, and inflammation.1,

concept of syndrome X promulgated 
the idea of insulin resistance causing 
a constellation of factors that 
increased diabetes and CVD risk.
After publication of Reaven’s 
landmark article, clustering of 
CVD risks was variously described 
as insulin resistance syndrome, 
syndrome X, and the dysmetabolic 
syndrome. In 2001, the National 
Cholesterol Education Program 
(NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III 
(ATP III) coined the term “metabolic 
syndrome” to describe the presence 
of any 3 of 5 particular risks: 
hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, 
central adiposity, elevated blood 
pressure, and low high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). 
Research on MetS has increased 
dramatically since 2001, with more 
than 1000 articles per year published 
on this topic since 2006. MetS has 
been associated with both diabetes 
and CVD in adults. Insulin resistance, 
obesity, aging, inflammation, 
hormonal factors, sedentary lifestyle, 
dietary sugar intake, and genetics 
all have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of MetS.1 
– 
6
Despite this vast literature, MetS 
remains a controversial topic in 
pediatrics for several reasons. First, 
MetS is challenging to define in 
pediatric populations. MetS in adults 
consists of a subset of at least 3 out 
of 5 risk factors: increased central 
adiposity, elevated triglycerides, 
decreased HDL-C, elevated blood 
pressure, and hyperglycemia. In 
adults, MetS (the presence of 3 or 
more of these risks) is predictive of 
CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.3, 
 
7 
In children and adolescents, however, 
many different definitions of MetS 
have been proposed (Table 1), and 
there is no clear consensus on which 
to use.8, 
9 In addition, because the 
majority of MetS cases in childhood 
and adolescence occur in individuals 
with obesity, the utility of MetS as a 
construct above and beyond obesity  
itself has been questioned.8, 
 
10 
– 
12  
Regardless of the definition 
used, there is no uniform way to 
treat MetS when it is diagnosed 
other than weight management. 
Instead, each risk factor must be 
treated individually, which leaves 
pediatricians wondering whether 
they should (and how to) define 
MetS in their patients. Our purpose 
with this Clinical Report is to provide 
an overview of the current state 
of the field in relation to MetS in 
pediatric populations. Given its name 
recognition, MetS terminology will 
be used in this report. However, 
the clinical relevance of MetS 
lies in its ability to be used as an 
organizational framework for the 
identification of cardiometabolic risk 
factor clustering. Recommendations 
for pediatricians regarding how 
to approach the concept of MetS 
in children and adolescents are 
provided.
PathoPhysIology
The pathophysiologic origins of 
MetS are in insulin resistance, a 
physiologic state associated with 
obesity. Insulin binds to receptors 
on multiple tissues of the body, 
including liver, fat, muscle, and blood 
vessels, with a myriad of effects (Fig 
1). Insulin secreted by the pancreatic 
β cells travels to the liver via the 
portal system, where it normally 
acts to suppress glucose production. 
In the insulin-resistant state, the 
suppression of hepatic glucose 
production is impaired, resulting 
in abnormal glucose homeostasis. 
However, even in an insulin-resistant 
state, not all insulin effects are 
impaired; there is “selective” insulin 
resistance.17 For unknown reasons, 
insulin action stimulating hepatic 
lipogenesis is not impaired, causing 
the release of free fatty acids and 
triglycerides into the circulation. 
This results in dyslipidemia and 
ectopic adipose deposition.6 The 
MetS dyslipidemia pattern consists of 
elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C,  
relatively normal low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
increased small, dense low-density 
lipoprotein particles, 
18 which are 
known to be atherogenic and to 
increase cardiovascular risk.
One of the major clinical 
consequences of insulin resistance 
is adipose tissue dysfunction, or 
“adiposopathy.” As adipose expands, 
the cells hypertrophy, and these 
hypertrophic adipose cells are 
more resistant to insulin’s action 
to suppress lipolysis. These large 
adipocytes also secrete increased 
proinflammatory chemokine 
monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1.19 As stated previously, 
insulin action stimulating fatty acid 
synthesis is preserved, promoting 
adipose tissue expansion. MetS is 
characterized by increased visceral 
as opposed to subcutaneous fat 
as well as ectopic fat deposited in 
abnormal locations, such as the liver.6 
Ectopic fat distribution results in the 
release of adipocytokines, causing a 
state of low-grade inflammation, with 
increased inflammatory factors, such 
as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, 
tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 
6, and acute phase reactants such as 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
and fibrinogen.20 The endoplasmic 
reticulum acts as a nutrient sensor. 
Energy or nutrient excess can 
trigger endoplasmic reticulum 
stress, resulting in activation of 
inflammatory pathways, increased 
reactive oxygen species production, 
and mitochondrial dysfunction.21 
Some emphasize the importance of 
the inflammatory state, with insulin 
resistance being a consequence of 
inflammation.20 Irrespective of what 
is the consequence or cause, insulin 
resistance, ectopic fat distribution, 
and inflammation are all key 
pathologic players in the components 
of MetS.

syndrome or MetS among adults: 
the World Health Organization 
(WHO), 
22 the NCEP’s ATP III, 
23 the 
American Association of Clinical 
Endocrinologists/American College 
of Endocrinology, 
24 the International 
Diabetes Federation (IDF), 
25 and the 
American Heart Association (AHA) 
in conjunction with the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
(NHLBI) of the National Institutes 
of Health.16 A detailed comparison 
of these definitions is beyond the 
scope of this report. The definitions 
differ significantly, with most but not 
all requiring a minimum number of 
risk factors, some excluding those 
with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and most differing in the 
types, required number, and specific 
cut points for the criterion risk 
factors. As noted previously, in 2001, 
the NCEP first developed the “any 3 
of 5” risk criteria definition. The 5 
risks included in the NCEP ATP III 
definition are (1) hyperglycemia, 
(2) hypertriglyceridemia, (3) low 
HDL-C, (4) hypertension, and (5) 
increased waist circumference. In 
2005, the AHA/NHLBI modified this 
definition by revising the glucose cut 
point down and adding allowance 
for drug treatment of dyslipidemia 
and impaired fasting glucose. That 
same year, the IDF introduced its 
“worldwide” definition of MetS, 
25 
lowering the waist circumference cut 
points for certain racial and ethnic 
groups and putting greater emphasis 
on abdominal obesity by making 
it a necessary criterion for MetS 
diagnosis.
Although the AHA/NHLBI and IDF 
definitions have many similarities, 
there are important differences 
between them with respect to cut 
points of the various component 
risks (Table 1). The differences in 
these definitions have important 
implications for case identification. 
For example, an adult with 
hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, 
and low HDL-C but with a normal 
waist circumference would have 
MetS according the NCEP but not 
the IDF. In contrast, a person with 
hyperinsulinemia, low HDL-C,  
and obesity would have MetS 
according to the WHO criteria 
but not per the NCEP guidelines 
because hyperinsulinemia is not a 
risk factor used by the NCEP. These 
differences between definitions lead 
to differences in their prognostic 
ability and case identification.3,

example, in one of the earliest articles 
on MetS in adolescents, Goodman 
et al27 found a greater than twofold

difference in the prevalence of WHO-
defined MetS compared with NCEP-
defined MetS in the Princeton School 
District Study.
defInIng Mets In PedIatrIcs
Definitions of MetS for children and 
adolescents have been even more 
varied than the definitions used 
for adults. The first researchers 
addressing MetS in a pediatric 
population focused on  
adolescents.13, 
 
14, 
 
27 
–29 Even 
researchers that used the same 
database (the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey III) 
had divergent prevalence estimates, 
ranging from 4.2%‍13 to 9.2%‍, 
14 a 
difference of greater than twofold. 
More than 40 different pediatric 
definitions of MetS have been used.30 
In 2007, the IDF brought together an 
international group of experts and 
developed a consensus definition.9 
In that report, the IDF recommended 
that pediatric MetS be based on the 
adult IDF definition but that it should 
only apply to children 10 years and 
older and that, among those between 
10 and 16 years of age, the 90th 
percentile for waist circumference 
or adult cut point (whichever was 
lower) should define abdominal 
obesity. The IDF stated that for 
those 16 years and older, adult 
criteria should apply. Two years 
later, the AHA published its scientific 
statement on MetS in children and 
adolescents, 
8 which emphasized 
the need to identify pediatric 
cardiometabolic risks and noted that 
only some of these were found in the 
criteria used to define MetS. The AHA 
did not include a definition of MetS 
for use in pediatric populations and 
indeed made particular note of the 
limitations of adapting definitions 
derived for adults to pediatric 
populations. To date, there is no clear 
consensus on whether MetS should 
be defined in pediatric populations 
and, if defined, which definition to 
use.8, 
 
9
The controversy over the utility 
of MetS in pediatrics goes beyond 
its definition. In adulthood, MetS 
predicts CVD and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.2, 
 
31 Malik et al7 found that 
compared with those who have no 
MetS risk factors, the hazard ratio 
for coronary heart disease mortality 
was 2.87 for those with MetS without 
diabetes and 5.02 for those with 
MetS and diabetes. Depending on 
the definition used, Laaksonen et al3 
found that the odds ratio (OR) for 
men with MetS developing diabetes 
in the 4-year follow-up period was 
5 to 8.8. Data from the Princeton 
Prevalence and Follow-up Studies 
demonstrated that pediatric MetS 
predicted adult MetS with an OR 
of 9.4 and adult type 2 diabetes 
mellitus with an OR of 11.5; this 
study arbitrarily used 2 different 
MetS definitions.32 However, the 
utility of the syndrome in adolescents 
has also been questioned, given 
studies indicating instability of the 
definition when transitioning from 
adolescence to adulthood.10, 
 
33 
– 
35 
Large proportions of children defined 
as having MetS during childhood do 
not meet the diagnostic criteria on 
follow-up 3 to 6 years later.10, 
 
34 In 
multiple observational longitudinal 
studies, although population-level 
prevalence has increased, within-
person variation in presence or 
absence of MetS has been large, with 
many studies showing 50%‍ or more 
of MetS-positive subjects becoming 
MetS-negative over time, whether 
that be with short-term (∼3 weeks)36 
or longer-term (9 years)35 follow-up. 
The instability was not related to 
change in weight status.35 Thus, 
MetS is highly unstable throughout 
childhood. A child can meet the 
criteria at 1 point in time and not 
meet it at another point in time, and 
it is unclear whether this variation 
represents an improvement or 
deterioration in health status.35
Ethnic or racial differences in rates 
of obesity and MetS components also 
exist. Hispanic and black non-Hispanic 
children demonstrate higher rates 
of obesity than white non-Hispanic

children across age categories.37 
However, similar to adults, black 
non-Hispanic youth demonstrate 
lower rates of dyslipidemia, 
38 greater 
insulin resistance, and higher blood 
pressure than white non-Hispanic and 
Hispanic youth.8 Hispanic children 
have increased dyslipidemia (elevated 
total cholesterol, low HDL-C, or high 
non–HDL-C) compared with black 
non-Hispanic and white non-Hispanic 
children.39 Because of the racial and/
or ethnic differences in dyslipidemia, 
and despite increased prevalence of 
obesity and greater risk for type 2 
diabetes mellitus, black non-Hispanic 
youth have a lower prevalence of 
MetS than white non-Hispanic or 
Hispanic youth, 
28 which can lead to an 
underestimation of cardiometabolic 
risk.40
Given the absence of a consensus on 
the definition of MetS, the unstable 
nature of MetS, and the lack of clarity 
about the predictive value of MetS for 
future health in pediatric populations, 
pediatricians are rightly confused 
about MetS. The high prevalence of 
pediatric obesity and limited resources 
to address the obesity problem in 
pediatrics reveal the need to identify 
a subset of children with obesity or 
who are overweight and at increased 
risk for cardiovascular and metabolic 
complications beyond the physical 
complications of obesity. Although 
obesity is, in general, associated with 
increased mechanical stress and 
potential orthopedic complications, 
not all children with obesity 
manifest metabolic dysregulation 
as a consequence of their obesity. 
Identifying children with multiple 
metabolic derangements allows 
targeting of focused interventions 
toward children at the highest risk for 
cardiometabolic disease. Thus, rather 
than focus on defining MetS in youth, 
the American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) recommends that pediatricians 
focus on the concept of cardiovascular 
risk factor clustering and associated 
risk factor screening. This concept 
is especially important because the 
Bogalusa Heart Study demonstrated 
substantially increased development 
and severity of atherosclerotic lesions 
associated with increased clustering 
of atherosclerotic CVD risk factors.41 
Furthermore, the AAP recommends 
that pediatricians do not need to use 
cut points based on MetS definitions. 
The MetS construct identifies multiple 
component risk factors that appear 
to cluster together and whose 
pathologic origins arise from insulin 
resistance and adiposopathy. Much 
of the discrepancy in definitions 
derives from differences in these 
thresholds. Moreover, for many 
risk factors, the risk is a continuum. 
Continuous variables may be more 
reliable in predicting young adult 
risk from early adolescence and 
might help determine future risk.42 
A number of researchers have used 
factor analysis of MetS components 
to develop a continuous risk score 
measure to identify children at higher 
risk for developing a chronic disease 
related to MetS into adulthood.43, 
 
44 
Although such work currently is not 
clinically applicable, with advances in 
research and development of clinically 
applicable risk score guidelines, a 
continuous risk score approach may 
be created for use in general pediatric 
practice in the future. At the moment, 
however, risk factor screening and 
identification of youth with MetS risk 
factor abnormalities allow providers 
to target scarce resources to children 
at increased cardiometabolic risk, 
particularly those with multiple 
component abnormalities. Such 
screening and associated treatment 
(see below) is an important component 
of preventive pediatric care.
deterMInants of MetaBolIc rIsk 
factor clusterIng
There are multiple determinants of 
the 5 risk factors currently used to 
define MetS in adolescents or in adults. 
Familial influences include shared 
genetic and environmental factors, 
which combine to make heritability 
of these individual MetS components 
strong. Twin and family studies 
have revealed substantial familial 
aggregation of MetS risk factors. Family 
history of atherosclerotic CVD is a 
well-known genetic risk for high lipid 
concentrations, high blood pressure, 
and high glucose concentration.45 
Obesity, at the core of MetS, is itself 
highly heritable through shared genetic 
and environmental factors. If a parent 
is obese, his or her child is twice as 
likely to be obese, and conversely, 
more than half of children with obesity 
have at least 1 parent with obesity.46
Several MetS risk factors have 
origins during the prenatal and 
early postnatal period. The presence 
of maternal gestational diabetes; 
low birth weight, especially with 
rapid catch-up growth; infant 
feeding practices (restrictive and 
pressuring); and early adiposity 
rebound are associated with later 
development of obesity and other 
MetS components.8, 
 
9 Throughout 
childhood and adolescence, 
socioeconomic factors and parental 
obesity also affect development of the 
5 MetS component risk factors.8, 
 
9
Health behavioral factors also are 
associated with and can predict the 
presence of MetS risks, particularly 
obesity, in youth. Specific behaviors 
include short duration of sleep, 
excessive screen time, specific 
dietary factors, low physical activity, 
and tobacco smoke exposure.47, 
 
48  
Even after controlling for 
demographic factors, the number 
of hours a child spends each day in 
front of a screen is directly related 
to BMI and calories consumed 
per day and inversely related to 
minutes of physical activity.49 New 
AAP policies discourage screen use 
except for video chatting before 18 
to 24 months of age and recommend 
that pediatricians help families 
develop a Family Media Use Plan 
specific for each child that ensures 
entertainment screen time does 
not displace healthy behavioral 
factors, such as adequate sleep 
and physical activity. (The AAP

org/ 
MediaUsePlan.)50, 
51 Physical activity 
is beneficial for weight management, 
and it has also been negatively 
associated with MetS and factors that 
overlap with MetS, independent of 
weight status. Short sleep duration 
inversely predicts cardiometabolic 
risk in adolescents with obesity, 
even when controlling for degree 
of obesity and levels of physical 
activity.52 Some studies in adults 
and children have found a U-shaped 
relationship between sleep duration 
and cardiometabolic risk, with 
either too much or too little sleep 
being problematic.53 
– 
55 Although 
exact mechanisms remain unknown, 
factors related to inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and antioxidant 
status are thought to mediate the 
sleep duration–cardiometabolic 
health relationship.56
Among the multiple dietary factors 
associated with obesity, lack of 
whole grain and fiber intake is 
most strongly correlated with the 
development of insulin resistance 
even after adjusting for BMI.57 Higher 
consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
which contribute dietary fiber as 
well as micronutrients, is known to 
reduce risk of atherosclerotic CVD, an 
end point of MetS in adulthood.58
coMorBIdItIes
Comorbidities of MetS, insulin 
resistance, and obesity include 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD), polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 
and mental health disorders. NAFLD 
represents a spectrum of damage to 
the liver, from steatosis to fibrosis 
and cirrhosis. NAFLD is defined by 
having liver fat >5%‍ liver weight (not 
caused by alcohol consumption) and 
is strongly associated with insulin 
resistance.59 Although there is not a 
consensus about testing frequency 
among professional organizations, 
current AAP recommendations, 
published in 2007, suggest biannual 
screening for NAFLD by measuring 
aspartate aminotransferase and 
alanine aminotransferase among 
children with BMI at or greater than 
the 85th percentile.60
The risk for PCOS is increased in girls 
with obesity. PCOS is characterized 
by hyperandrogenism (elevated 
free testosterone), menstrual 
irregularities and/or ovulatory 
dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. 
Obesity and insulin resistance (with 
resulting hyperinsulinemia) are 
associated with PCOS as well as 
with increased free testosterone 
and ovarian and adrenal 
hyperandrogenism. The increased 
luteinizing hormone pulse frequency 
and increased luteinizing hormone–
follicle-stimulating hormone ratio 
observed in PCOS (although not 
part of diagnostic criteria) result in 
increased androgen secretion from 
theca cells in the ovaries.61
Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
have been associated with worse 
mental health, including increased 
risk for anxiety and depression.60, 
 
62, 
 
63 
 
Chronic disease is a well-
recognized stressor, and obesity 
is associated with social stigma 
and discrimination. Thus, obesity 
and diabetes screening guidelines 
often recommend mental health 
screening, as do the current AAP 
recommendations for children who 
are overweight or children with 
obesity.60
OSA is a condition characterized by 
complete or partial obstruction of 
the upper airway and is associated 
with obesity. OSA causes sleep 
fragmentation, intermittent hypoxia, 
and increased negative airway 
pressure in the thoracic cavity.64 
Obesity increases the risk for OSA 
because of enlarged soft tissues in 
and around the airway as well as 
decreased lung volumes because 
of increased abdominal fat.64 
Interestingly, OSA is independently 
associated with CVD, insulin 
resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and endothelial dysfunction 
and is related to hypertension. 
Moreover, studies have revealed 
that treatment of OSA improves 
multiple components of MetS, such 
as blood pressure, lipids, and glucose 
control.65, 
 
66 As in MetS, the comorbid 
conditions mentioned here share 
associations with insulin resistance 
and obesity, which potentially play a 
role in their pathology as well.
screenIng
Given the complexity of defining 
MetS in adolescence, the evolving 
understanding of MetS, and the lack 
of consensus regarding definition, 
it is not surprising that there is 
no consensus as to whether or 
how MetS should be identified in 
pediatric populations, particularly 
adolescents. However, there is a 
consensus among the American 
Diabetes Association and AHA that 
obesity prevention and treatment in 
childhood and adolescence should be 
the first-line approach to alleviating 
cardiometabolic risk.67 Published 
guidelines recommend that primary 
care clinicians perform annual obesity 
screening for all children by using 
BMI and refer children with BMI at or 
greater than the 95th percentile to a 
comprehensive weight-management 
program.60, 
 
68, 
 
69 In practice, it is 
sometimes not possible to refer all such 
children to a comprehensive program. 
Pediatricians can develop the expertise 
and resources necessary to manage 
these patients themselves, especially 
when no comprehensive program 
exists in their catchment area.
In addition to obesity screening with 
BMI, children should be screened 
annually for elevated blood pressure 
in primary care by using auscultatory 
methods for obtaining blood 
pressure.69 Nonfasting non–HDL-C 
or fasting lipid screening should be 
performed in all children between 
the ages of 9 and 11 years.69 This 
approach will help to identify children 
with genetic forms of dyslipidemia

 PEDIATRICS Volume 140, number 2, August 2017
and will also identify those with 
high triglycerides and low HDL-C 
because of metabolic problems. 
Although insulin resistance is the key 
to the etiology of MetS, the Insulin 
Resistance Consensus group did not 
recommend screening for insulin 
resistance with fasting insulin.70 
Screening for glucose intolerance and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus is important 
because hyperglycemia is one of the 
MetS component risks. Risk factors 
for type 2 diabetes mellitus include 
overweight or obesity, belonging to a 
high-risk racial and/or ethnic group, 
family history of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, physical signs of insulin 
resistance (acanthosis nigricans), 
PCOS, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. 
Methods of screening have included 
the oral glucose tolerance, hemoglobin 
A1c, fasting glucose, and random 
glucose tests.67, 
71 The authors of the 
expert committee obesity guidelines 
from 2007 recommended that children 
 
10 years or older (or pubertal)  
with a BMI at or greater than  
the 85th percentile and 2 additional 
risk factors be screened with  
a fasting glucose test every 2 years.60
treatMent
Treatment of MetS involves both 
behavioral and pharmacotherapeutic 
interventions aimed at reducing 
obesity, glucose abnormalities, 
hypertension, and dyslipidemia. 
Once identified, pediatricians should 
treat these component risk factors 
by using current best practices 
(summarized or referenced later in 
this report) to reduce future risk for 
cardiometabolic disease.
Obesity treatment is grounded in 
lifestyle modification, and early 
treatment of obesity in childhood 
and adolescence is recommended as 
the first-line approach to reducing 
cardiometabolic risk.60, 
 
67, 
 
69 Obesity 
is a more stable trait than MetS, 
more likely to be present at multiple 
points in time, and more likely to 
persist into adulthood. Furthermore, 
treatment of obesity and treatment 
of MetS components share many 
common elements, and interventions 
that improve 1 condition are likely to 
ameliorate the other. Meta-analyses 
of pediatric lifestyle intervention 
studies have revealed that dietary 
modification and increased 
physical activity decrease weight 
and also improve cardiometabolic 
risk factors such as dyslipidemia 
and hypertension.68, 
72 Decreased 
obesity also results in decreases in 
insulin resistance and inflammatory 
markers.73 Good evidence suggests 
that moderate- to high-intensity 
weight-loss programs combined 
with behavioral counseling, negative 
energy balance diets, and increased 
physical activity, can successfully 
address obesity.68 Combining diet 
and exercise is more effective at 
achieving decreases in BMI than 
either intervention in isolation. No 
researchers have demonstrated 
evidence for recommending a specific 
dietary plan because appropriate 
restriction of calories is the main 
issue. Low-glycemic-load diets and 
low-carbohydrate diets may be 
more effective than low-fat diets in 
reducing weight and improving CVD 
risk, at least in the short-term.69 
Specific lifestyle targets that have 
demonstrated efficacy in reducing 
BMI include substitution of sugar-
sweetened beverages with water, 
milk, or artificially sweetened 
beverages74 
– 
77 and reducing 
television or screen time.77 
–79 It is 
important to note that achieving 
a normal BMI is not necessary to 
decrease cardiometabolic risk. 
Studies have revealed that weight 
loss and improvement in BMI by 5%‍ 
to 10%‍ can have metabolic benefits.80
The mechanisms that explain 
the association between lifestyle 
modification and effects on MetS 
components are not fully understood. 
Dietary interventions that lower 
intake of simple sugars may reduce 
stimulus for insulin production. 
Reducing mitochondrial substrate 
by caloric restriction, particularly 
lipogenic substrates, 
6 could also 
be effective. In addition, increased 
dietary fiber intake decreases 
the glycemic load to the liver. 
Increased physical activity improves 
mitochondrial efficiency, which 
is preventive against MetS, 
6 and 
improves insulin sensitivity. As 
activity levels increase, inflammatory 
cytokines and markers of oxidative 
stress decrease, insulin sensitivity 
increases, endothelial function 
improves, and HDL-C concentrations 
increase.81 Time spent in moderate to 
vigorous physical activity is inversely 
associated with a MetS continuous 
risk score, and those who spent at 
least 88 minutes per day in moderate 
to vigorous physical activity were 
least likely to have MetS.82
Pharmacotherapeutic options to 
treat obesity in children are limited.83 
Currently, only orlistat has an 
FDA indication for weight loss in 
adolescents as young as 12 years 
of age. Orlistat, an intestinal lipase 
inhibitor, results in a mean 3%‍ weight 
loss (on the basis of starting weight) at 
6 months.84, 
 
85 Adverse effects include 
steatorrhea and flatulence, making it 
difficult to use in practice. Insurance 
coverage for orlistat is variable.85 
Bariatric surgery in adolescents is 
effective86 and reserved for the most 
severely affected.
Treatment of MetS risk factor 
components is well described in 
several evidence-based guidelines. 
The authors of the NHLBI Expert Panel 
guidelines, published in 2011, provide 
evidence-based guidance for dietary 
and pharmacotherapeutic treatment 
of dyslipidemia and hypertension 
in children and adolescents. The 
type of dyslipidemia associated 
with MetS usually is treated with 
lifestyle intervention only, not with 
pharmacologic agents.69 Treatment 
of insulin resistance involves lifestyle 
modification only. Anecdotally, some 
providers are using metformin to

treat children and adolescents who 
have insulin resistance with normal 
glucose concentrations. Although 
some studies have revealed beneficial 
effects of metformin on BMI and 
homeostatic model assessment of 
insulin resistance score in adolescents 
with insulin resistance, these trials 
were only 6 months in length and 
involved small numbers of subjects.87 
Thus, metformin is not currently 
recommended for treatment of insulin 
resistance.70 No consensus exists in 
the pediatric diabetes community as to 
treatment of prediabetes in children, 
other than lifestyle management. 
Children found to have prediabetes 
or type 2 diabetes mellitus on 
screening can be referred to a pediatric 
endocrinologist for management and/
or monitoring.88 It is also critical to 
screen for and address any comorbid 
conditions, such as PCOS or OSA, which 
often share the causal link of insulin 
resistance with MetS component risk 
factors.
suMMary
MetS evolved from Reaven’s 
concept of syndrome X, a tool used 
to understand the many effects 
of insulin resistance on human 
physiology. In adults, a diagnosis 
of MetS is associated with an 
increased risk for CVD and diabetes. 
In pediatrics, there remain many 
unanswered questions regarding 
the definition of and utility of the 
diagnosis of MetS. Therefore, 
1. although pediatricians can use 
MetS as an organizing frame, 
the focus for clinical screening 
and treatment should be on 
cardiometabolic risk factors, many 
of which cluster together and are 
associated with obesity;
2. pediatricians should not focus the 
specific levels of cardiometabolic 
risk factors from the multitude of 
MetS definitions because the risk 
lies on a continuum and in the 
context of the whole child;
3. by following current 
recommendations to screen 
for and treat obesity, glucose 
abnormalities, hypertension, 
and dyslipidemia, pediatricians 
are addressing the major MetS-
associated cardiometabolic risks 
in pediatric populations;
4. identification of children with 
multiple component risks enables 
pediatricians to apply their most 
intensive intervention efforts to 
the children and adolescents in 
greatest need of risk reduction; 
and
5. increasing awareness of 
comorbid conditions such as 
NAFLD, mental health disorders, 
PCOS, and OSA enables 
pediatricians to address and refer 
to specialists, as needed.
Continued efforts to prevent and 
treat obesity and its associated 
metabolic abnormalities among 
children and adolescents and 
vigilant attention to the early 
diagnosis of diabetes provide the 
pediatrician with the most evidence-
based methods for addressing 
cardiometabolic risk factor clustering 
(MetS) in adolescence.
