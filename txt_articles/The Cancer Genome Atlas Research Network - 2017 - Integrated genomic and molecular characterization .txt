Integrated genomic and molecular 
characterization of cervical cancer
The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network* 
Cervical cancer accounts for 528,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths 
worldwide each year, more than any other gynaecological tumour1. 
Ninety-five per cent of cases are caused by persistent infections with 
carcinogenic HPVs2. Effective prophylactic vaccines against the most 
important carcinogenic HPV types are available, but the number of 
people receiving the vaccine remains low. Although early  
cervical 
 
cancer can be treated with surgery or radiation, metastatic  
cervical 
cancer is incurable and new therapeutic approaches are needed3.
While most HPV infections are cleared within months, some  
persist 
and express viral oncogenes that inactivate p53 and RB, leading to 
increased genomic instability, accumulation of somatic mutations, 
and in some cases, integration of HPV into the host genome4. The 
association with cancer risk and histological subtypes varies sub-
stantially among carcinogenic HPV types, but the reasons for these 
differences are poorly understood. Furthermore, clinically relevant 
subgroups of cervical cancer patients have yet to be identified. Here 
we  
present a comprehensive study of invasive cervical cancer conducted 
as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, with a focus on 
 
identifying novel clinical and molecular associations as well as func-
tionally altered signalling pathways that may drive tumorigenesis and 
serve as  
prognostic or therapeutic markers.
Samples and clinical data
Primary frozen tumour tissue and blood were obtained from women 
with cervical cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy or radio-
therapy (Supplementary Information 1 and Supplementary Tables 1, 2). 
 
DNA, RNA and protein were processed as previously described5 
(Supplementary Information 1, 3, 5 and 8). Mutations were called 
for 192 samples (the extended set), while all other platform (aside 
from protein) and integrated analyses were performed on a subset of 
178 samples (the core set). Protein levels were measured on 155 samples 
(119 samples from both the core and extended sets plus 36 additional 
samples). The total number of non-overlapping samples in these three 
sets was 228 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Of the 178 core-set samples, 
 
surgery was the primary treatment in 121 cases, median follow-up time 
was 17 months, and 145 patients were alive at the time of last follow-up. 
A committee of expert gynaecological pathologists reviewed most cases 
(Supplementary Information 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1b–g). The core 
set included 144 squamous cell carcinomas, 31 adenocarcinomas and 
3 adenosquamous cancers.
Somatic genomic alterations
Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 192 extended-set tumour–
blood pairs. All samples had at least 32 Mb of target exons  
covered 
with a median depth of 49× (range: 7–351× 
) for tumour samples and 
47× 
 (range: 9–341× 
) for normal samples. Collectively, the samples 
contained 43,324 somatic mutations, including 24,551 missense, 2,470 
nonsense, 9,260 silent, 5,841 non-coding, 535 splice-site, 74 non-stop 
mutations, 475 frameshift insertions and deletions (indels) and 118 
in-frame indels. Eleven tumours with outlier mutation frequencies 
 
(> 
600 per sample) were classified as ‘hypermutant’
. The aggregate 
mutation density was 4.04 mutations per Mb across all tumours, and 
2.53 when the hypermutant tumours were excluded.
Fourteen genes that are significantly mutated (SMGs) with false- 
discovery rates (FDR) < 
 0.1 were found using the MutSig2CV6 
 
algorithm (Supplementary Table 4). We identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, 
CASP8, HLA-A and TGFBR2 as novel SMGs in cervical cancer, and 
confirmed that PIK3CA, EP300, FBXW7, HLA-B, PTEN, NFE2L2, 
ARID1A, KRAS and MAPK1 are SMGs, as previously reported7,8 (Fig. 1, 
 
Extended Data Fig. 2a–g and Supplementary Fig. 6). Supplementary 
Table 4 shows the comparison of SMGs identified in the current 
TCGA set and a previously published dataset8. Mutations in 7 of the 
14 SMGs in the TCGA set were present in at least one squamous cell 
carcinoma and one adenocarcinoma; however, mutations in HLA-A, 
HLA-B, NFE2L2, MAPK1, CASP8, SHKBP1 and TGFBR2 were found 
 
exclusively in squamous tumours.
PIK3CA had mostly activating helical-domain E542K and E545K 
mutations, with a marked relative decrease in mutations elsewhere in 
the gene (Extended Data Fig. 2g). This observation resembles  
findings 
in bladder cancer9 and HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell 
cancers (HNSCs)10, but it differs from observations in breast and 
most other cancers11. The underlying nucleotide substitution pattern 
in the E542K and E545K mutations is associated with mutagenesis by 
a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminases8,12–15, with 150 out of 192 
Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here we report the extensive 
molecular characterization of 228 primary cervical cancers, one of the largest comprehensive genomic studies of cervical 
cancer to date. We observed notable APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A and 
TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in cervical cancer. We also discovered amplifications in immune targets 
CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2), and the BCAR4 long non-coding RNA, which has 
been associated with response to lapatinib. Integration of human papilloma virus (HPV) was observed in all HPV18-related 
samples and 76% of HPV16-related samples, and was associated with structural aberrations and increased target-gene 
expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative 
tumours with relatively high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of 178 samples 
identified keratin-low squamous, keratin-high squamous and adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses 
reveal new potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancers.

exomes displaying significant (q < 
 0.05) enrichment (up to sixfold) for 
the APOBEC signature. Further, the APOBEC mutation load corre-
lated strongly with the total number of mutations per sample (Extended 
Data Fig. 2h), suggesting that APOBEC mutagenesis is the predominant 
source of mutations in cervical cancers.
We found an average of 88 somatic copy number alterations per 
tumour, fewer than in HNSC, ovarian and serous endometrial carci-
nomas, but more than in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas10,16,17. 
GISTIC2.0 analysis (with a threshold of q < 
 0.25) revealed 26 focal 
amplifications and 37 focal deletions along with 23 recurrently altered 
whole arms (Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 7). Novel 
recurrent focal amplification events were identified (in genomic order) 
at 7p11.2 (EGFR, 17%), 9p24.1 (CD274, PDCD1LG2, 21%), 13q22.1 
(KLF5, 18%) and 16p13.13 (BCAR4, 20%). Other previously reported 
amplification events occurred at 3q26.31 (TERC, MECOM, 78%), 3q28 
(TP63, 77%), 8q24.21 (MYC, PVT1, 42%), 11q22.1 (YAP1, BIRC2, 
BIRC3, 17%), and 17q12 (ERBB2, 17%). Novel recurrent deletions 
were identified at 3p24.1 (TGFBR2, 36%) and 18q21.2 (SMAD4, 28%), 
in addition to previously identified deletions at 4q35.2 (FAT1, 36%) 
and 10q23.31 (PTEN, 31%). A cluster with high copy number altera-
tions mostly contained squamous tumours with amplification events 
involving 11q22 (YAP1, BIRC2, BIRC3) and 7p11.2 (EGFR), whereas 
the cluster containing low copy number variations included most 
 
adenocarcinomas and was enriched for tumours with deletions in 
TGFBR2 and SMAD4, and gains in ERBB2 and KLF5 (Extended 
Data Fig. 3a, b). Notably, both groups had amplifications involving 
CD274 (PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2) that correlated significantly 
(P < 
 0.0001) with expression of two key immune cytolytic effector 
genes, granzyme A and perforin18 (Extended Data Fig. 3d). This high-
lights the potential of immunotherapeutic strategies for a subset of 
cervical cancers.
Structural rearrangements were identified by analysis of RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) (core set, n = 
 178) and whole-genome 
 
sequencing (WGS) data with low-pass (n = 
 50) and deep (n = 
 19) 
coverage. Both RNA-seq and WGS detected 22 putative structural 
rearrangements in 14 patients (Supplementary Table 8). In total, 26 
recurrent fusions were found (Supplementary Table 9, with examples 
in Extended Data Fig. 4d). RNA-seq analysis revealed four samples with 
16p13 ZC3H7A–BCAR4 gene fusions, whereby exon 1 of ZC3H7A was 
linked to the last exon of BCAR4. WGS revealed tandem duplication 
and copy number gain of BCAR4 on chromosome 16p13.13 (Extended 
Data Fig. 4c). BCAR4 is a metastasis-promoting long non-coding RNA 
that enhances cell proliferation in oestrogen-resistant breast cancer 
by activating the HER2/HER3  
pathway. Lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 
 
inhibitor,  
counteracts BCAR4-driven tumour growth in vitro, and 
warrants evaluation as a possible therapeutic agent in BCAR4-positive 
cervical cancer19.
Integrated analysis of molecular subgroups
Integration of copy number, methylation, mRNA and microRNA 
(miRNA) data using iCluster20 highlighted the molecular heterogeneity 
 
of cervical carcinomas. Three clusters were identified that largely 
corresponded to mRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig. 9): a  
squamous 
cluster with high expression of keratin gene family members 
 
(keratin-high), another squamous cluster with lower expression of 
 
keratin genes (keratin-low), and an adenocarcinoma-rich cluster 
 
(adenocarcinoma). Keratin-high and keratin-low clusters included 
133 out of 144 squamous cell carcinomas and the adenocarcinoma 
cluster contained 29 out of 31 adenocarcinomas (Fig. 2). KRAS 
(P = 
 9.7 × 
 10−5), ERBB3 (P = 
 2.6 × 
 10−3) and HLA-A (P = 
 0.03) 
mutations were significantly associated with clusters, whereby KRAS 
mutations were absent from the keratin-high cluster and HLA-A muta-
tions were absent from the adenocarcinoma cluster (Fig. 2). Members 
of the SPRR and TMPRSS cornification gene families and the SMGs 
ARID1A (P = 
 0.02), NFE2L2 (P = 
 6.9 × 
 10−6) and PIK3CA (P = 
 0.01) 
were  
differentially expressed between keratin-low and keratin-high 
clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4b).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of variable DNA-methylation 
probes produced three groups (Extended Data Fig. 5a), including a 
small ‘CpG island hypermethylated’ (CIMP-high) cluster, a CIMP-
intermediate cluster and a CIMP-low cluster that were associated 
with an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) mRNA score10,21 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b). Most of the samples in the adenocarcinoma 
cluster were CIMP-high, whereas the other iCluster groups contained 
a  
mixture of CIMP-intermediate and CIMP-low samples (Fig. 2). 
Comparing all cervical carcinomas to 120 normal samples drawn from 
12 TCGA projects, we identified 1,026 epigenetically silenced genes that 
were methylated to a greater extent in cancers than in normal tissues,

including several zinc-finger (ZNF), protease (ADAM, ADAMTS), and 
collagen (COL) genes (Supplementary Tables 11 and 12).
Unsupervised clustering resulted in six miRNA clusters that were 
 
associated with the iCluster groups (P = 
 1.7 × 
 10−19) (Extended Data 
Fig. 6a). Samples from the adenocarcinoma cluster almost exclu-
sively  
overlapped with miRNA cluster 5, and were characterized by 
high expression of miR-375 and low expression of miR-205-5p and 
 
miR-944 (Supplementary Table 31). Expression levels of tumour 
 
suppressors miR-99a-5p and miR-203a were significantly higher 
in samples from the keratin-high cluster than samples from the 
 
keratin-low  
cluster (Supplementary Table 31; P = 
 0.01 and P = 
 0.008, 
respectively). Among miRNAs with  
significant and functionally 
 
validated gene and protein anti-correlations22, one large subnetwork 
involved the miR-200  
family and other miRNAs with expression 
 
patterns that anti-correlated with those of the EMT-related transcrip-
tion factors ZEB1, ZEB2 and SNAI2, the Hippo and p73 transcriptional 
co-factor YAP1, the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) ERBB2, ERBB3 
and AXL, and the hormone receptor ESR1 (Extended Data Fig. 6b, 
Supplementary Figs 17, 18 and Supplementary Table 15).
Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of 155 samples with 
192 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 17) 
identified three clusters significantly associated with the  
iCluster 
groups (P = 
 1.8 × 
 10−4) and EMT mRNA score (Fig. 3a, c, d and 
Supplementary Table 16). Samples from the EMT cluster were enriched 
in the keratin-low cluster, whereas PI3K–AKT and hormone cluster 
 
samples were enriched in the keratin-high and adenocarcinoma 
clusters, respectively, suggesting distinct pathway activation across 
integrated cervical cancer subtypes. Differential expression levels 
of phosphorylated (p)-MAPK, p-EGFR (Y1068), p-SRC (Y416), 
IGFBP2 and TIGAR between keratin-high and keratin-low clusters 
suggest diverse activation patterns of RTK, MAPK, PI3K and metabolic 
 
signalling pathways that may underlie the molecular diversity of 
 
cervical squamous cancers (Fig. 2).
The core members of each RPPA cluster with the highest  
silhouette 
width (> 
0.02, n = 
 115) were associated with five-year survival 
 
(Fig. 3b; P = 
 6.1 ×

outcome. Notably, this was the only platform where clusters associated 
with outcomes (Supplementary Figs 8, 9, 12 and 22; Supplementary

Information 6). Samples in the EMT cluster exhibited high ‘reactive’ 
pathway scores11 (Supplementary Fig. 20), illustrating for the first time 
in cervical cancer the presence of a subset of stromal reactive tumours 
that have high expression of caveolin-1, MYH11 and RAB11, a subset 
which also appears in other diseases23 (Supplementary Table 16). YAP 
 
was the most significantly differentially expressed protein distinguishing 
 
samples from the EMT cluster from all others (Supplementary Table 18; 
P = 
 1.7 × 
 10−15) and YAP1 was significantly amplified in the  
samples 
from the EMT cluster compared to the hormone (P = 1.1 × 10−5) and 
PI3K–AKT cluster (P = 
 6.4 × 
 10−4) samples. Regulation of the EMT-
related molecules YAP and ZEB1 (refs 24–26) may also be driven by 
significantly lower expression levels of miR-200a-3p in the samples 
from the EMT cluster compared to samples from the other RPPA 
 
clusters (Extended Data Figs 6b, 7a; P = 
 3.8 × 
 10−3). These results 
highlight potential roles for YAP and reactive stroma in EMT-regulated 
progression of cervical cancers.
The mutual exclusivity modules in cancer (MEMo) algorithm27 uses 
somatic-mutation and copy number data to identify oncogenic  
networks 
with mutually exclusive genomic alterations. Because miR-200a 
 
and miR-200b (miR-200a/b) expression was negatively correlated with 
EMT mRNA scores (Extended Data Fig. 7b, d), we used MEMo to 
examine alterations in miR-200a/b and EMT gene networks and found 
a potential link between the TGFβ 
 pathway and miR-200a/b alterations 
in regulating EMT28,29. Deletions and mutations affecting the  
receptor 
gene TGFBR2, the modulating genes CREBBP and EP300, and the 
transcription factor SMAD4 probably all affect growth- 
suppressive and 
pro-apoptotic functions driven by TGFβ 
 (Fig. 4c) and were observed 
in 30% of squamous cell carcinomas (Fig. 4d). Tumours with both 
hypermethylation and downregulation of miR-200a/b (referred to as 
altered) were restricted to squamous cell carcinomas, were enriched 
in the keratin-low cluster (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8; P = 0.001 
for both miR-200a and miR-200b), showed significant  
upregulation of 
both ZEB1 and ZEB2 (Extended Data Fig. 9a–d), and were  
mutually 
 
exclusive with alterations in the TGFβ signalling pathway (Fig. 4d). 
Notably, samples with altered miR-200a/b exhibited higher EMT 
mRNA scores than unaltered samples, whereas no significant  
difference 
was found between samples with or without TGFβ 
-pathway altera-
tions (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7c, e). These findings highlight 
potential treatment approaches for this subgroup of cervical cancer 
patients, as targeting EMT may render tumours more sensitive to small- 
molecule inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapy21,30,31.
MEMo analysis also showed differences in therapeutically  
relevant 
alterations in RTK, PI3K and MAPK pathways across cervical  
cancers. 
MEMo identified mutual exclusivity modules involving alterations 
within both the PI3K and MAPK pathways (Supplementary Table 27; 
 
adjusted P = 
 0.06); however, there was a strong tendency for co- 
occurrence of ERBB2 and ERBB3 alterations within adenocarcino-
mas (P < 
 0.001, log odds ratio > 
 3), indicating that a subset of these 
tumours may exhibit aberrant HER3 signalling through interactions 
between mutant HER3 and activated HER2 and therefore could 
potentially benefit from HER2- and HER3-targeted therapies32  
(Fig. 4a, b). Although not statistically significant, aberrations in 
PIK3CA also tended to co-occur with PTEN somatic mutations and 
deletions (P = 
 0.078, log odds ratio = 
 0.71), which is similar to endome-
trial tumours with few copy number alterations and suggests potential 
therapeutic benefit from PI3K-pathway-targeting agents17.

PARADIGM33,34, which integrates copy number, RNA-seq and 
 
pathway-interaction data, showed markedly different pathway 
 
activation profiles between squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas 
 
(Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 48). PARADIGM 
identified higher inferred activation of p53, p63, p73, AP-1, MYC, 
HIF1A, FGFR3 and MAPK signalling as key distinguishing features 
of squamous cell carcinomas, similar to other squamous cancers35. 
By contrast, adenocarcinomas exhibited higher inferred activation 
of ERα 
, FOXA1, FOXA2 and FGFR1 pathways (Extended Data 
Fig. 10, Supplementary Figs 25, 48 and Supplementary Table 18). 
Possible underlying mechanisms for ERα 
 upregulation may stem 
from the expression of miR-193b-3p, a direct regulator of ESR1  
that was  
significantly downregulated in adenocarcinomas compared 
 
to  
squamous carcinomas (Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supple-
mentary Table 14; P = 
 0.04), or from oestrogen signalling in stromal 
cells36.
Cross-cancer analysis
We next evaluated the relationship of cervical cancer subtypes with 
endometrial cancer, an adjacent cancer site with hormone-related 
carcinogenesis, and HNSC, a subset of which is caused by HPV. For 
this, hierarchical clustering of cervical, uterine corpus endometrial 
(UCEC)17, and HNSC10 mRNA-expression data was performed. 
Three major groups were observed, with cluster 1 including all UCEC 
 
samples and most cervical adenocarcinomas and characterized by over-
expression of hormone-receptor genes ESR1 and PGR (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 4a). Cluster 2 included predominantly squamous cervical carcino-
mas and 23 out of 27 HPV-positive HNSC samples. Cluster 3 included 
few cervical cancers and the remaining HNSC cancers, which were 
mostly HPV-negative. This highlights the similarity of HPV-related 
squamous cancers at different anatomical sites.
Since a subset of cervical cancers clustered with endometrial  
samples, 
a gene-expression classifier was developed to predict whether carci-
nomas were cervical or endometrial (Supplementary Information 5). 
 
We classified 8 out of 178 (4.5%) cervical cancer samples as 
 
endometrial-like (UCEC-like) cancers, which were confirmed to 
be cervical cancers by study pathologists (Extended Data Fig. 1f, g). 
These tumours included 7 out of 9 HPV-negative cancers and 5 of the 8 
 
were adenocarcinomas. Six UCEC-like cancers were in the adenocarci-
noma cluster and two were in the keratin-low cluster. Despite their low 
number, the UCEC-like tumours accounted for 33%, 27% and 20% of 
mutations in ARID1A, KRAS and PTEN, respectively. They were asso-
ciated with the RPPA hormone and miRNA C6 clusters, and all but one 
sample was CIMP-low and copy number-low (Supplementary Table 1).
HPV genotypes, variants and integration
Of the 178 core-set tumours, 169 (95%) were HPV-positive, 120 (67%) 
had alpha-9 (A9) types (103 HPV16), 45 (25%) had alpha-7 (A7) types 
(27 HPV18), and 9 (5%) were HPV-negative (Supplementary Table 3). 
 
HPV variants were predominantly European (137 out of 169, 81% 
 
A variants), and there was a significant association of non-European 
HPV16 variants with cervical adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Table 3; 
 
odds ratio = 
 5.3, P = 
 3 × 
 10–3). All HPV-positive cancers had detectable 
 
expression of HPV E6- and E7-oncogene mRNAs, which encode 
proteins that inhibit p53 and RB function, respectively37,38. Notably, 
HPV18 cancers had significantly higher ratios of unspliced to spliced 
transcripts encoding the active E6 oncoprotein than the HPV16 cancers 
(Extended Data Fig. 11a; P = 
 2 × 
 10–10), suggesting different functional 
implications of E6 and E7 in cancers associated with different HPV 
genotypes.
HPV A7 types were enriched in the keratin-low and  
adenocarcinoma 
clusters (P = 
 5 × 
 10–4). Most HPV clade A7 tumours were CIMP-low,

and HPV-negative tumours formed a distinct  
subgroup 
within the CIMP-low cluster with a significantly lower mean 
 
promoter-methylation level than other samples in that cluster 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a; P = 
 5 × 
 10−3). Samples with the highest rate 
of gene silencing were HPV-positive adenocarcinomas, particularly 
those related to A9 types (t-test P < 
 0.001). Functional epigenetic 
module (Supplementary Information 13) analysis39, which integrates 
DNA-methylation and gene-expression data using protein–protein 
 
interaction networks, identified inverse correlations between methyla-
tion and gene expression in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative  
cervical 
cancers and HPV-positive (n = 
 36) versus HPV-negative (n = 
 243) 
HNSCs. The analysis revealed 12 statistically significant  
subnetworks 
for cervical cancer and 11 for HNSCs, with one common subnetwork 
centred around Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) (Supplementary Table 19 
and Supplementary Fig. 32). miR-944, miR-767-5p and miR-105-5p 
were the most differentially expressed miRNAs between HPV-positive 
and HPV-negative samples (Supplementary Fig. 14e). miR-944 
 
expression was also significantly higher, whereas miR-375 expression 
was significantly lower in HPV16-positive squamous  
cancers  
compared 
to HPV18-positive squamous cancers (Supplementary Fig. 14d). 
 
Notably, HPV-negative cancers had a significantly higher EMT mRNA 
score and a lower frequency of the APOBEC mutagenesis signature 
compared with HPV-positive tumours (Extended Data Fig. 11b and 
Supplementary Fig. 27; P = 0.02 and P = 0.004, respectively).
PARADIGM was used to evaluate molecular pathways differentially 
activated in squamous samples with A7- and A9-HPV infections. We 
observed higher inferred activation of p53 and p63 signalling and 
lower FOXA1 signalling in tumours infected with A9 types (Fig. 5a 
and Supplementary Fig. 23a). Higher SFN pathway activation was also 
observed for A9-positive tumours, which is consistent with the low 
methylation and high gene-expression patterns of SFN found in func-
tional epigenetic module analysis (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 19). 
Notably, the SFN-encoded stratifin (also known as 14-3-3σ 
) adaptor 
protein has previously been associated with epithelial immortalization 
and squamous cell cancers40,41, altered p53-pathway activation42, and 
Wnt-mediated β 
-catenin signalling43.
Viral–cellular fusion transcripts indicating integration of HPV into 
the host genome were observed in 141 out of 169 (83%) HPV-positive 
cancers, including all HPV18-positive cancers. Of these 141 samples, 
90 (64%) had a single HPV integration event, 35 had two events, 
and 16 had three or more events (totalling 220 unique integration 
events) (Supplementary Table 3). HPV integration events affected all 
 
chromosomes, including some previously described hotspots such as 
3q28 and 8q24 (ref. 44) (Fig. 5b). Genomic loci affected by integra-
tion were characterized by increased somatic copy number alterations 
(P = 
 6.9 × 
 10−13 for HPV16 and P = 
 0.058 for HPV18) and increased 
gene expression (P = 
 1.6 × 
 10−11 for HPV16 and P = 
 0.011 for HPV18) 
(Extended Data Fig. 11c, d). In addition, 153 (70%) fusion transcripts 
included known or predicted genes, whereas the remainder included 
intergenic regions (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 3).
Conclusion
Through comprehensive molecular and integrative profiling, we 
 
identified novel genomic and proteomic characteristics that subclassify 
cervical cancers. Integrated clustering identified keratin-low squamous, 
keratin-high squamous, and adenocarcinoma-rich clusters defined by 
different HPV and molecular features (Extended Data Fig. 8). ERBB3, 
CASP8, HLA-A, SHKBP1 and TGFBR2 were identified as SMGs for the 
first time in cervical cancer, with ERBB3 (HER3) immediately applicable 
 
as a therapeutic target. For the first time in cancer, we report ampli-
fications and fusion events involving the BCAR4 gene, which can be 
targeted indirectly by lapatinib. Further, we identified amplifications in 
CD274 and PDCD1LG2, two genes that encode well-known immuno-
therapy targets. A set of endometrial-like cervical cancers  
comprised 
predominantly of HPV-negative tumours and  
characterized by 
mutations in KRAS, ARID1A and PTEN was discovered, with PTEN 
and potentially ARID1A proteins serving as therapeutic targets. 
Importantly, over 70% of cervical cancers exhibited genomic alterations 
in either one or both of the PI3K–MAPK and TGFβ 
 signalling pathways 
(Extended Data Fig. 9e), illustrating the potential clinical significance 
of therapeutic agents targeting members of these pathways. For the 
first time, we report distinct molecular pathways activated in cervical 
carcinomas caused by different HPV types, highlighting the biological 
diversity of HPV effects.
Together, these findings provide insight into the molecular subtypes 
of cervical cancers and rationales for developing clinical trials to treat 
populations of cervical cancer patients with distinct therapies.

RESEARCH
METHODS
Data reporting. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. 
The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to 
allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Samples and data freeze. Each tissue source site provided documentation that 
their IRBs either: a) approved their participation specifically in the TCGA project, 
through an approved protocol, amendment, exemption, or waiver, and the docu-
mentation must include specific mention of TCGA; or b) provided documentation 
that the IRB does not consider participation in TCGA to constitute ‘human subjects 
research’
, and therefore does not have purview.
The Core Data Freeze (core set) included 178 samples from cervical  
carcinoma 
batches 88, 114, 127, 148, 169, 179, 200, 217, 236, 256, 280, 297, 335 and 350 
(Supplementary Table 1). This is a standard data freeze whereby the case list was 
‘frozen’ and analyses used the one set even though other samples came through 
the pipeline. Samples in the core set had mRNA-seq, whole exome DNA-seq 
(WES), miRNA-seq, methylation, SNP6 copy number and clinical data available. 
Additional samples that had multicentre mutation calls and/or RPPA data included 
67 samples from cervical carcinoma batches 88, 114, 127, 148, 169, 179, 200, 217, 
236, 256, 280, 297, 335, 350, 361, 373, 380, 394 and 420 (Supplementary Table 2). Of 
these samples, 14 had mutations called and 60 had RPPA data available; however, 
RPPA data for 17 samples was excluded owing to low protein content within the 
samples (Supplementary Table 2). Mutations were called for 192 samples (extended 
set), while all other platform and integrated analyses (aside from protein) were 
performed on the subset of 178 core-set samples. Protein levels were measured on 
155 samples, which included 119 samples from both the core and extended sets 
as well as 36 samples outside of these sets. The total number of non-overlapping 
samples across core, extended and RPPA datasets is 228 (Extended Data Fig. 1a).
HPV detection, variant calling and transcript analysis. HPV status was deter-
mined using consensus results from MassArray and RNA-seq (Supplementary 
Information 2). MassArray uses real-time competitive polymerase chain reaction 
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectros-
copy with separation of products on a matrix-loaded silicon chip array, similar 
to the work described in ref. 45. Two approaches for pathogen detection from 
RNA-seq data were used. The first used the microbial detection pipeline at the 
British Columbia Cancer Agency’s Genome Sciences Centre (BC), which is based 
on BioBloom Tools (BBT, v1.2.4b1)46. The second used the PathSeq algorithm47 
at the Broad Institute (BI) to perform computational subtraction of human reads 
followed by alignment of residual reads to a combined database of human reference 
genomes and microbial reference genomes including HPV
. In 97% of samples, com-
plete agreement between MassArray and both RNA-seq approaches was observed. 
The remaining discrepant samples were resolved by majority decision, assigning 
the genotype called by at least two of the methods. RNA-seq data in FASTA format 
was used to identify HPV variants (Supplementary Fig. 1). Unaligned reads were 
taken from the PathSeq analysis and aligned to HPV reference genomes using 
TopHat48 with default parameters49. The HPV variant lineages/sublineages were 
assigned based on the phylogenetic topology and confirmed visually using the SNP 
patterns50. HPV splice junctions from RNA-seq were determined using TopHat. 
Two transcript types were distinguished for HPV16 and HPV18:  
transcripts 
that included evidence of an unspliced sequence of E6, and transcripts spliced at 
the E6 splice donor site (position 226 for HPV16 and position 233 for HPV18) 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Read counts for unspliced, spliced, as well as the ratio of 
unspliced/spliced transcripts were categorized into quartiles separately for HPV16 
and HPV18.
HPV integration analysis. Using RNA-seq data, concordance of integration 
events based on alignments of contigs from de novo transcriptome assembly (BC) 
and read alignments (BI) was evaluated (Supplementary Fig. 3). We identified 
 
method-specific integration events by assigning all sites within a 500-kb sliding 
window to a single integration event located at the median coordinate of that 
assigned sites for that event. An integration event was labelled as ‘confident’ when 
the total read support for each of its supporting integration sites passed centre- 
specific read evidence thresholds. To take advantage of differences between the two 
integration methods (that is, contig and read), for the concordance analysis we used 
all method-specific integration events (both confident and non-confident events). 
We labelled an integration event as ‘concordant’ when both methods reported an 
integration event within 500 kb in the same patient’s sample. For some concordant 
events, both methods reported a confident event. An integration event was labelled 
as ‘discordant’ when only one centre reported a confident integration event within 
500 kb (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). For both intragenic and intergenic concordant 
 
events, we reported a range of coordinates that extends from the most proximal 
to the most distal supported integration site. We assessed gene-level expression 
relative to somatic copy number and structural-variant data for genes into which 
we had mapped viral–human junctions from RNA sequencing data and for genes 
that were associated with enhancers into which we had mapped RNA junctions.
DNA sequencing and mutation calling. Detailed methods for library hybrid 
capture, read alignments and somatic variant calling are documented in 
Supplementary Information 3. MutSig2CV6 was used to identify significantly 
mutated genes (SMGs) within the cervical cancer exome sequencing data. 
Mutations were analysed for the core set plus 14 samples for a total of 192 extended- 
set samples. Eleven samples were identified to exhibit greater than average 
 
mutations rates and were termed hypermutants (somatic mutations > 
 600). These 
11 samples were excluded from the analysis for identifying SMGs. All three sample 
subsets (all samples, squamous carcinomas only, adenocarcinomas only)  
without 
hypermutants (Supplementary Table 4) were analysed using an FDR cut-off of 
 
0.1. FDR values are shown in Supplementary Table 4. SMG analysis using the entire 
sample cohort in from ref. 8 was performed as described previously8.
Copy number analysis. DNA from each tumour or germline sample was 
 
hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays using protocols at the Genome Analysis 
Platform of the Broad Institute as previously described51. Briefly, Birdseed was 
used to infer a preliminary copy number at each probe locus from raw .cel files52. 
For each tumour, genome-wide copy number estimates were refined using tangent 
normalization, in which tumour signal intensities are divided by signal intensities 
from the linear combination of all normal samples that are most similar to the 
tumour16. Individual copy number estimates then underwent segmentation using 
circular binary segmentation53, and segmented copy number profiles for tumour 
and matched control DNAs were analysed using Ziggurat Deconstruction54. 
Significance of copy number alterations were assessed from the segmented data 
using GISTIC2.0 (version 2.0.22)54. For the purpose of this analysis, an arm-level 
event was defined as any event spanning more than 50% of a chromosome arm. For 
copy number-based clustering, tumours were clustered based on copy number at 
regions using GISTIC analysis. Clustering was done in R on the basis of Euclidean 
distance using Ward’s method. Allelic and integer copy number, tumour purity and 
tumour ploidy were calculated using the ABSOLUTE algorithm55.
Detecting structural variants from RNA-seq and WGS data. Integrative  
analysis 
was performed to identify putative driver fusions using both WGS (low-pass and 
high-coverage) and RNA-seq data. RNA-seq data for 178 core-set samples were 
analysed using the TopHat-Fusion and BreakFusion, PRADA and MapSplice 
algorithms. To identify structural variations in WGS data, 50 low-pass WGS and 
19 high-pass WGS samples were analysed. Detection of structural variations in 
low-pass WGS data was performed using two algorithms, BreakDancer56 and 
Meerkat57, with a requirement for at least two discordant read pairs supporting 
each event and at least one read covering the breakpoint junction. High-pass 
WGS data were analysed to detect somatic structural variations using two runs 
of BreakDancer and one run of SquareDancer (https://github.com/ding-lab/
squaredancer). The gene fusion lists generated by all methods and platforms were 
integrated (see Supplementary Tables 8–10).
APOBEC mutagenesis analysis. Analysis is based on previous findings that 
APOBECs deaminate cytidines predominantly in a tCw motif and that the 
APOBEC mutagenesis signature is composed of approximately equal numbers 
of two kinds of changes in this motif: tCw→ 
tTw and tCw→ 
tGw mutations 
(flanking nucleotides are shown in small letters; w = 
 A or T). Using mutation 
data from all 192 extended-set samples, we calculated on a per-sample basis the 
enrichment of the APOBEC mutation signature among all mutated cytosines in 
comparison to the fraction of cytosines that occur in the tCw motif among the 
 
± 
20  
nucleotides surrounding each mutated cytosine (APOBEC_enrich column in 
data files). The minimum estimate of the number of APOBEC-induced mutations 
in a sample (APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate) was calculated using the formula: 
[tCw→ 
G + 
 tCw→ 
T]× 
[(APOBEC_enrich− 
1)/APOBEC_enrich], which allows 
 
estimation of the number of APOBEC signature mutations in excess of what would 
be expected by random mutagenesis. APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate was calcu-
lated only for  
samples passing the threshold of FDR < 
 0.05 for APOBEC enrichment 
 
([BH_Fisher_p-value_tCw] < 
 0.05). Samples with a BH_Fisher_p-value_tCw > 
 0.05 
were given a value of 0. The APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate value shows high 
correlation (0.9–0.95) with all other parameters used to  
characterize the APOBEC 
 
mutagenesis pattern, such as APOBEC enrichment, and absolute and relative APOBEC 
mutation loads. For some analyses and figures, the APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate 
parameter was converted into categorical values as follows: no, APOBEC_MutLoad_
MinEstimate = 
 0; low, 0 < APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate > 
 median of non-zero 
values; high, APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate > 
 median of non-zero values. The 
median of non-zero values in the extended set = 33.
Methylation analysis. The Illumina Infinium HM450 array58 was used to  
evaluate 
DNA methylation in the core set of samples from cervical cancer patients. 
Unsupervised consensus clustering was performed with Euclidean distance and 
partitioning around medoids (PAM) using the most variable 1% of CpG-island 
promoter probes. Epigenetically silenced genes were identified as previously 
described59. A total of 120 normal samples were used for this analysis by selecting 
10 samples at random from the 12 TCGA projects that included normal samples.

RNA-seq analysis. RNA was extracted, converted into mRNA libraries, and paired-
end sequenced (paired 50 nucleotide reads) on Illumina HiSeq 2000 Genome 
Analyzers as previously described5. RNA reads were aligned to the hg19 genome 
assembly using Mapsplice version 12_0760. Gene expression was quantified for 
 
the transcript models corresponding to the TCGA GAF2.1 (https://gdc-api.nci.nih.
gov/v0/data/a0bb9765-3f03-485b-839d-7dce4a9bcfeb) using RSEM4 (ref. 61) and 
normalized within a sample to a fixed upper quartile. To predict whether a cancer 
sample was from the cervix or the uterus, the data matrix of normalized gene-level 
RSEM values from 170 UCEC samples was merged with the data matrix from the 
core set (n = 
 178) of cervical cancers. This merged dataset was then randomly split 
into a training set (87 cervical carcinoma samples; 86 UCEC samples) and a test 
set (91 cervical carcinoma samples; 84 UCEC samples). A sample was predicted to 
be cervical carcinoma if the t-statistic versus UCEC was significant (P < 
 0.05), but 
was not significantly different from the cervical carcinoma mean (and vice versa for 
the UCEC prediction). A data matrix of RSEM values from 178 cervical carcinoma, 
170 UCEC and 279 HNSC samples was used to identify expression patterns across 
the 3 cancer types. The gene expression matrix was further filtered to only include 
the top 25% most variable genes by mean absolute deviation (n = 4,039 genes).
EMT mRNA score analysis. The EMT score was computed as previously 
described10,21. Briefly, the EMT score was the value resulting from the  
difference 
between the average expression of mesenchymal (M) genes minus the  
average 
expression of epithelial (E) genes. All values for unavailable data (NA) 
 
were removed from the calculation. Two-sample t-test and ANOVA were applied 
to each comparison accordingly.
miRNA sequencing and analysis. MicroRNA-sequencing (miRNA-seq) data was 
generated for the core set of tumour samples using methods described  
previously11. 
We identified miRNAs that have been associated with EMT62–66 and then  
calculated 
Spearman correlations between the EMT scores and normalized  
expression 
(reads per million, RPM) for 5p and 3p mature strands for each of the miRNAs 
using MatrixEQTL and filtering by FDR < 
 0.05. An miRNA was  
considered to 
be  
epigenetically controlled if the BH-corrected P values were less than 0.01 for 
both (i) a Spearman correlation of miRNA abundance (RPM) to beta for probes in 
promoter regions associated with the miRNAs, and for (ii) a t-test of RPM between 
unmethylated (β < 
 0.1) and methylated (β > 
 0.3) samples (an  
epigenetically 
 
controlled pattern). We assessed potential miRNA targeting for all 178 samples 
and then separately for the 144 squamous samples by  
calculating miRNA–mRNA 
and miRNA–protein (RPPA) Spearman correlations with MatrixEQTL v2.1.1 using 
gene-level normalized abundance RNA-seq (RSEM) data and normalized RPPA 
data. Correlations were calculated with a P value threshold of 0.05, and then the 
anti-correlations were filtered at FDR < 
 0.05. We extracted miRNA–gene pairs that 
were functionally validated in publications reported by miRTarBase v4.5 (ref. 22). 
For miRNA–RPPA anti-correlations, all gene names that were associated with each 
antibody were used. Results were displayed with Cytoscape v2.8.3.
PARADIGM analysis. Integration of copy number, RNA-seq and pathway 
 
interaction data was performed on the core set of samples using PARADIGM33,34. 
Briefly, PARADIGM infers integrated pathway levels (IPLs) for genes, complexes 
and processes using pathway interactions, genomic and functional genomic data 
from each patient sample. One was added to all expression values, which were 
then log2-transformed and median-centred across samples for each gene. The 
log2-transformed, median-centred mRNA data were rank-transformed based on 
the global ranking across all samples and all genes and discretized (+ 
1 for values 
with ranks in the highest tertile, − 
1 for values with ranks in the lowest tertile and 
0 otherwise) before PARADIGM analysis.
Pathways were obtained in BioPax level 3 format, and included the NCIPID 
and BioCarta databases from http://pid.nci.nih.gov and the Reactome database 
from http://reactome.org. Gene identifiers were unified by UniProt ID and then 
converted to Human Genome Nomenclature Committee’s HUGO symbols using 
mappings provided by HGNC (http://www.genenames.org/). Altogether, 1,524 
pathways were obtained. Interactions from all of these sources were then  
combined 
into a merged superimposed pathway (SuperPathway). Genes, complexes and 
abstract processes (for example, cell cycle and apoptosis) were retained and hence-
forth referred to collectively as pathway features. The resulting pathway structure 
contained a total of 19,504 features, representing 7,369 protein-coding genes, 9,354 
complexes, 2,092 families, 82 RNAs, 15 miRNAs and 592 abstract processes.
The PARADIGM algorithm infers an IPL for each pathway element that reflects 
the log likelihood that contrasts the probability of activity against inactivity. An 
initial minimum variation filter (at least 1 sample with absolute activity > 
0.05) was 
applied, resulting in 15,502 concepts (5,898 protein-coding genes, 7,307 complexes, 
1,916 families, 12 RNAs, 15 miRNAs and 354 abstract processes) with relative 
activities showing distinguishable variation across tumours.
iCluster analysis. Integrative clustering of RNA-seq, methylation, copy number 
and miRNA data was performed using the R package iCluster20. The core set of 
samples was used since all samples in this set had data available across these four 
platforms. RNA-seq, methylation, copy number and mature-strand miRNA  
datasets 
had 20,531, 395,552, 23,109 and 1,213 features, respectively. The 500 most variable 
features based on the standard deviation from each dataset were selected for the inte-
grative clustering analyses. For analysis involving the RNA-seq and miRNA datasets, 
a log[x + 1] transformation was used in order to deal with skewness in the data67. 
Methylation data was logit transformed to make it closer to normal distribution. The 
CNV data included the regions determined from GISTIC2.0, with CNVs treated as 
a continuous measurement based on the segmentation mean value for the region.
MEMo analysis. High DNA-methylation levels upstream of miR-200a and 
 
miR-200b corresponded to transcriptional downregulation of the miRNAs 
(Extended Data Fig. 9a). For a sample to be called altered for either miR-200a or 
miR-200b (or both), we required both high DNA-methylation level upstream of 
the miRNA (β > 0.3) and low miRNA expression (log2[RPM] < 9.3 for miR-200a 
and log2[RPM] < 
 9 for miR-200b). Binary calls were given to altered and unaltered 
samples based on this double threshold (1 = altered, 0 = unaltered).
The mutual exclusivity modules in cancer (MEMo) algorithm27 was run on all 
core-set samples. MEMo was first run on 27 regions of recurrent copy  
number 
gain, 36 regions of copy number loss and 22 recurrently mutated genes. In order 
to include alterations for miR-200a and miR-200b in the MEMo analysis, a 
 
custom network was designed where each miRNA was connected to its known 
and  
validated targets (see above). Second, this network was merged with the com-
prehensive pathway network used by MEMo to search for modules of altered 
genes that include at least one of the miRNAs. Extracted modules were tested 
for mutual exclusivity using statistical framework of MEMo (Supplementary 
 
Table 27). A Student’s t-test was performed for comparison of the EMT mRNA 
scores between groups.

non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Tongues of highly atypical 
polygonal neoplastic squamous cells infiltrate through a fibrotic stroma. 
The cells show abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with pleomorphic 
nuclei and prominent mitotic figures. Although the tumour cells contain 
abundant cytokeratin filaments, this tumour has traditionally been termed 
non-keratinizing because of the absence of characteristic keratin pearls.  
c, An example of a large-cell keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.  
Nests of atypical squamous cells infiltrate through a fibrotic stroma.  
In addition, this tumour shows highly eosinophilic keratin pearls with 
small, inky dark nuclei that imperfectly mimic the normal keratinization 
that is found in the epidermis. This differentiation pattern is aberrant 
in the cervix in which the squamous epithelium is normally a non-
keratinizing squamous mucosa. d, An example of an endocervical 
adenocarcinoma (well differentiated). Closely set, atypical glands with 
enlarged nuclei and scattered mitotic figures infiltrate through the 
connective tissue of the cervix. The tall columnar tumour cells show 
basally placed, crowded, enlarged nuclei that show frequent mitotic 
figures. Compared with normal endocervical cells, the tumour cells  
show relative loss of intra-cytoplasmic mucin and are frequently called 
mucin-depleted, although most, but not all endocervical adenocarcinomas 
show varying amounts of intracytoplasmic mucin at least focally.  
e, Adenosquamous carcinoma of cervix. This tumour shows both nests of

potential, adenosquamous carcinomas are relatively uncommon in the 
cervix. f, UCEC-like HPV-negative endocervical adenocarcinoma from

cancer mutagenesis. a–f, High-confidence somatic mutations in SMGs 
among 192 exome-sequenced samples in the extended case set are shown. 
Domains are labelled according to Gencode 19, corresponding to Ensembl 
74. Mutations at canonical intronic splice acceptor (e− 
1 and e− 
2) are 
labelled based on proximity to the nearest coding exon. Panels display 
somatic mutations detected in novel cervical cancer SMGs, with HLA-B 
included for comparison with its family member HLA-A. Each axis is the 
protein-coding portion of a gene and each highlighted section represents 
the UniProt functional domain. Vertical lines indicate the boundaries 
of multiple annotation sources within common domain annotations 
as outlined in Supplementary Table 5. Horizontal lines distinguish 
overlapping domains. Circles represent a single mutation and  
are coloured based on mutation type. Mutations present in squamous  
cell carcinomas are black, whereas those present in adenocarcinomas are 
pink. g, PIK3CA mutations and recurrence are shown in a stacked circle 
plot, as above. Additionally, lolliplot sticks are coloured red if the mutation 
type coincides with patterns of APOBEC mutagenesis. h, The minimal 
estimated number of APOBEC-induced mutations (APOBEC_MutLoad_
MinEstimate column in Supplementary Table 1) strongly correlates 
with total number of mutations in a sample, as well as with the number 
of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in G:C pairs that are the exclusive 
substrate for mutagenesis by APOBEC cytidine deaminases. Although 
correlation with mutagenesis in A:T base pairs, which cannot be mutated 
by APOBEC enzymes, is statistically significant (two-tailed P = 0.047), it is 
very weak. Pearson correlation and R2 were calculated for all 192 exome-
sequenced samples, including samples with zero values. Only samples with 
non-zero values of APOBEC_MutLoad_MinEstimate are presented.

features that also distinguish the clusters, including the presence of miR-
200a/b alterations, UCEC-like samples and BCAR4-fusion events. The key 
for each feature is shown on the right.

Extended Data Figure 9 | miR-200a/b associations with EMT-regulating 
genes and somatic alterations within RTK, PI3K, MAPK and TGFβR2 
pathways in cervical cancer. a, Expression levels for miR-200a and miR-
200b compared to DNA-methylation level at their promoter. Samples were 
called altered if the miRNAs were concurrently hypermethylated (β > 0.3) 
and downregulated (red). b, mRNA expression levels for ZEB2, a target of 
both miR-200a and miR-200b, in subsets of miR-200a/b altered samples. 
ZEB2 is upregulated in samples with concurrent hypermethylation and 
downregulation of the miRNAs. c, mRNA expression levels of both ZEB1 
and ZEB2 in miR-200a/b hypermethylated/downregulated (altered)  
and all other (WT) samples. d, Correlations of miR-200a and miR-200b  
expression with multiple genes involved in EMT signalling across 
squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. e, Extent of genetic 
alterations and miRNA downregulation in the RTK, PI3K, MAPK and 
TGFβ pathways across all cervical tumours.

Extended Data Figure 10 | Pathway biomarkers differentiating 
squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. a, Cytoscape display 
of the largest interconnected regulatory network of PARADIGM pathway 
features that are differentially activated between squamous cell carcinomas 
and adenocarcinomas connected through hubs with ≥ 
10 downstream 
targets. Hubs with ≥ 
10 downstream targets are labelled. Genes showing 
mRNA–miRNA expression anti-correlation with strong supporting 
evidence are highlighted with a thicker black outline and are labelled. 
Top differentially expressed genes relating to immune function are also 
labelled. Node size is proportional to significance of differential activation. 
b, Zoom-in display of the p63 sub-network neighbourhood. First 
neighbours (upstream or downstream) of four p63 complexes (bold text) 
are displayed in this view.

characteristics in cervical cancer. a, E6 unspliced/spliced ratio for 
HPV16 and HPV18 intragenic, enhancer and intergenic sites. HPV16, 
median = 0.44 (n = 102); HPV18, median = 0.93 (n = 40). The P value is 
from a two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. b, Distribution of RNA-seq-
based EMT score for HPV-negative (HPV− 
) and HPV-positive (HPV+ 
)  
samples (n = 178). The P value was calculated as in a. c, Distributions of 
somatic copy number alterations and mRNA abundance ranks (left) and 
distribution functions for somatic copy number alterations and mRNA 
abundance ranks with 500 random samples shown close to the diagonals 
(grey) (right) for genomic loci with integrated HPV16. d, Distributions 
as in c for genomic loci with integrated HPV18. Benjamini–Hochberg-
corrected P values for the somatic copy number alteration and mRNA 
abundance ranks are medians of the P values from Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
tests for all random samples.
