Abstract
Objective The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment 
contained in current clinical practice guidelines for patients with non-specific low back pain in primary care. We also aimed 
to examine how recommendations have changed since our last overview in 2010.
Method The searches for clinical practice guidelines were performed for the period from 2008 to 2017 in electronic data-
bases. Guidelines including information regarding either the diagnosis or treatment of non-specific low back pain, and 
targeted at a multidisciplinary audience in the primary care setting, were considered eligible. We extracted data regarding 
recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, and methods for development of guidelines.
Results We identified 15 clinical practice guidelines for the management of low back pain in primary care. For diagnosis of 
patients with non-specific low back pain, the clinical practice guidelines recommend history taking and physical examination 
to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicular syndrome, use of imaging if serious pathology is suspected 
(but discourage routine use), and assessment of psychosocial factors. For treatment of patients with acute low back pain, 
the guidelines recommend reassurance on the favourable prognosis and advice on returning to normal activities, avoiding 
bed rest, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids for short periods. For treatment of 
patients with chronic low back pain, the guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs and antidepressants, exercise therapy, 
and psychosocial interventions. In addition, referral to a specialist is recommended in case of suspicion of specific patholo-
gies or radiculopathy or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks. While there were a few discrepancies across the current 
clinical practice guidelines, a substantial proportion of recommendations was consistently endorsed. In the current review, 
we identified some differences compared to the previous overview regarding the recommendations for assessment of psy-
chosocial factors, the use of some medications (e.g., paracetamol) as well as an increasing amount of information regarding 
the types of exercise, mode of delivery, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and invasive treatments.

Key points
1.
For diagnosis of patients with LBP, guidelines recommend diagnostic triage (i.e. classification in 
non-specific LBP, radiculopathy/sciatica and specific LBP), history taking and physical 
examination to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicular pain/radiculopathy, 
no routine imaging unless serious pathology is suspected, and assessment of yellow flags based 
on psychosocial factors.
2.
For treatment of patients with acute LBP, guidelines endorse recommendations for patient 
education, reassurance about a favourable prognosis and advice on returning to normal 
activities, avoiding bed rest, the use of NSAIDs, and the use of weak opioids for short periods 
when there is contraindication or lack of improvement with NSAIDs.  
3.
For treatment of patients with chronic LBP, guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs and 
antidepressants where necessary, prescription of exercise therapy, and psychosocial 
interventions. In addition, considering referring to a specialist is recommended in case of 
serious pathologies or radiculopathy, or if there is no improvement after four weeks.

Take Home Messages
1. Fifteen clinical practice guidelines containing recommendations for nonspecific LBP have 
been issued or updated since our last overview in 2010. 
2. While there were a few discrepancies across the current clinical practice guidelines, a 
substantial proportion of recommendations for diagnosis and treatment were consistently 
endorsed. 
3. We identified some differences compared to the previous overview regarding the 
recommendations for assessment of psychosocial factors, the use of some medications (e.g. 
paracetamol) as well as an increasing amount of information regarding the types of exercise, 
mode of delivery, acupuncture, herbal medicines, and invasive treatments. 
Keywords Low back pain · Clinical guidelines · Diagnosis · Treatment
Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is the leading contributor to years 
lived with disability [14]. Non-specific LBP is defined as 
low back pain not attributable to a known cause [21] and 
represents 90–95% of the cases of LBP [4]. The estimated 
point prevalence of non-specific LBP is 18% [13]. Annually, 
total costs of LBP are estimated to be US $100 billion in the 
USA [8], €3.5 billion in the Netherlands [19], €6.6 billion 
in Switzerland [35], €17.4 billion in Germany [5], and AUD 
$9.17 billion in Australia [34]. Although LBP imposes an 
enormous economic burden on healthcare systems, this con-
dition is responsible to affect individuals’ daily lives. Hence, 
effective strategies play an important role to minimize the 
impact of LBP.
Clinical practice guidelines provide evidence-based rec-
ommendations to assist decision making about health inter-
ventions. These documents, developed by expert panels, 
are normally updated every 3 to 5 years or if the available 
evidence suggests a reformulation of the previous document 
is necessary [33]. A brief search of the Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) reveals that the number of 
randomized controlled trials in LBP has nearly doubled 
since 2010. This finding suggests that some recommenda-
tions of clinical practice guidelines for the management of 
LBP may have changed in recent years.
Since 2001, we have been conducting overviews of clini-
cal practice guidelines for the management of patients with 
non-specific LBP in primary care settings [17, 18]. These 
overviews have summarized the overall consensus messages, 
any differences between clinical practice guidelines, the 
scientific support for the recommendations, and changes in 
recommendations over time. The importance of these pub-
lications is evidenced by the number of citations received; 
Web of Science citation index notes that the 2001 review [18] 
was cited 377 times and the 2010 review [17] 316 times. 
It has been 8 years since our last review and some of the 
recommendations for the management of low back pain have 
likely changed. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was 
to provide an overview of the recommendations regarding 
the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-specific 
LBP in primary care in current international clinical practice 
guidelines. We also aimed to examine if recommendations 
have changed since our last overview.
Methods
Searches
The searches for clinical guidelines were performed for 
the period from 2008 to 2017 in the following databases: 
MEDLINE via OVID (key words: combination of search 
terms regarding low back pain AND clinical guidelines), 
PEDro (key words: low back pain AND practice guidelines), 
National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.guide 
line.gov; key 
word: low back pain), and National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) (www.nice.org.uk; key word: 
low back pain). We also checked the guidelines included in 
our previous review for updates. Furthermore, we conducted 
citation tracking in the content and reference lists of relevant 
reviews on guidelines, completed a search of Web of Sci-
ence citation index for articles citing the previous reviews, 
and asked experts in the field. Two authors (C.B.O. and C.G 
M.) independently screened titles and abstracts of the search 
results. In case of disagreement, a third author (B.W.K.) 
arbitrated.
Types of study included
Guidelines including information regarding either the diag-
nosis or treatment of non-specific LBP, and targeted at a 
multidisciplinary audience in the primary care setting, were 
considered eligible. Only guidelines available in English, 
 2793
European Spine Journal (2018) 27:2791–2803 
1 3
French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, or Dutch 
were included because the authors can read these languages. 
For languages beyond these, we included English language 
summaries of the guideline if they contained sufficient 
information. We included one guideline per country unless 
there were separate guidelines for acute and chronic LBP. 
We also included guidelines issued by a multinational com-
mittee (e.g., Africa, Europe). If more than one guideline 
was considered eligible, we included the most recent issued 
by a national body (e.g., national pain society, or national 
health body).
Data extraction and data synthesis
Two independent authors extracted the following data using 
a standardised form: recommendations regarding diagnosis 
and treatment, target population, committee membership, 
the evidence base of the recommendations (e.g., literature 
search, grade of evidence), consensus methods (e.g., com-
mittee meetings, discussion groups), and dissemination of 
guidelines (e.g., publication in website or scientific jour-
nals). To examine changes in recommendations over time, 
we compared results of the previous overviews with the cur-
rent review. We presented the recommendations from the 
included guidelines in tables.
Results
Electronic searches conducted on June 16, 2017 retrieved 
1611 records after removing duplicates. After the screen-
ing of titles and abstracts, we assessed 61 full texts against 
our inclusion criteria. Of these, we excluded 46 full texts 
because they were: not the most recent guideline issued 
(n = 19), not guidelines (n = 15), not targeted at a multidis-
ciplinary audience (n = 10), and not in a language where we 
could obtain a translation (n = 2). Finally, 15 clinical practice 
guidelines [1, 3, 7, 9–11, 15, 20, 24, 27, 30–32] for the man-
agement of LBP were included from the following countries: 
Africa (multinational), Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, the Neth-
erlands, Philippine, Spain, the USA, and the UK.
Six guidelines [1, 7, 11, 20, 26, 28] (40%) provided rec-
ommendations for patients with acute, subacute, and chronic 
LBP (i.e., Canada, Finland, Mexico, Philippine, Spain, 
and the USA), two guidelines [15, 31] (13%) focussed on 
acute and chronic LBP (i.e., Malaysia and the Netherlands), 
three guidelines [9, 25, 30] (20%) focussed on acute LBP 
(i.e., Australia, and Denmark), and one guideline [3] (7%) 
focussed on chronic LBP (i.e., Brazil). In addition, three 
guidelines [10, 24, 32] (20%) provided recommendations 
regardless of the duration of symptoms (i.e., Africa, Bel-
gium, Germany and the UK). Therefore, ten guidelines 
contained recommendations for patients with acute LBP, 
six guidelines contained recommendations for patients with 
subacute LBP, and nine guidelines contained recommenda-
tions for patients with chronic LBP.
Three guidelines [1, 11, 28] defined acute LBP as less 
than 4 weeks duration, two guidelines [6, 26] specified less 
than 6 weeks duration and four guidelines [15, 25, 30, 31] 
defined acute LBP as less than 12 weeks duration. The Cana-
dian guideline [7] defined acute and subacute LBP as less 
than 12 weeks duration but without specifying the cutoffs 
for each one. All guidelines defined chronic LBP as more 
than 12 weeks’ duration.
Diagnostic recommendations
Table 1 describes the recommendations regarding diagnosis 
endorsed by each clinical practice guideline, and “supple-
mentary material: Appendix 1” details these recommen-
dations. Fourteen guidelines provided at least one recom-
mendation regarding diagnosis of patients with LBP. The 
American guideline [28] did not provide any recommenda-
tion regarding diagnosis because the committee group was 
instructed to make only recommendations for treatment of 
LBP.
Recommendations for diagnostic triage were found in 
13 guidelines. Over half of guidelines [1, 7, 24–26, 31, 32] 
(7 out of 13; 54%) recommend diagnostic triage to clas-
sify patients into one of three categories: non-specific LBP, 
radiculopathy/sciatica or specific LBP. Almost half of the 
guidelines [3, 9–11, 15, 20] (46%) recommend the classifi-
cations of non-specific LBP and specific LBP without dis-
tinguishing the group of patients with radicular pain/radicu-
lopathy. Most guidelines [1, 7, 11, 15, 20, 24–26, 31, 32] 
(10 out of 12; 83%) recommend history taking and physical 
examination to identify patients with specific conditions as 
the cause of the LBP. Box 1 describes the red flags endorsed 
by most clinical practice guidelines to identify serious con-
ditions in the assessment. In addition, most guidelines [1, 7, 
11, 15, 25, 26, 31] (7 out of 9; 78%) recommend neurologic 
examination to identify radicular pain/radiculopathy includ-
ing straight leg raise test [1, 7, 15, 26, 32] and assessment 
of strength, reflexes, and sensation [1, 11, 15]. Only three 
guidelines [11, 15, 26] (3 out of 12; 25%) recommend an 
assessment that also includes palpation, posture assessment, 
and spinal range of movement testing.
All guidelines recommend against the use of routine 
imaging for patients with non-specific LBP. Most guide-
lines [1, 7, 9–11, 25, 30] (7 out of 12; 58%) recommend that 
imaging should only be considered if red flags are present. 
In addition, five guidelines [1, 7, 10, 24, 32] (42%) sug-
gest imaging when the results are likely to change or direct 
the treatment (e.g., invasive treatments), and two guidelines 
 2794
 
European Spine Journal (2018) 27:2791–2803
1 3
(17%) recommend imaging if pain persists beyond 4 to 
6 weeks [7, 26].
Twelve guidelines contain recommendations for assess-
ment of psychosocial factors, or yellow flags, to identify 
patients with poor prognosis and guide treatment. Most 
guidelines [1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 20, 26, 31] (8 out of 12; 67%) 
recommend the assessment based on a list of yellow flags 
reported in the guideline. Box 2 provides these yellow flags 
endorsed by most clinical practice guidelines. Four guide-
lines [10, 24, 25, 32] (33%) recommend assessment using 
validated prognostic screening tools (e.g., STarT Back and 
Orebro) which combine a number of yellow flags. The Dan-
ish guideline [30] recommends against targeted treatment 
for a subgroup of patients with specific prognostic factors. 
Regarding the optimal timing to assess yellow flags, most 
guidelines [7, 10, 11, 15, 24, 25, 32] (7 out of 12; 58%) rec-
ommend assessment during the first or second consultation.

Treatment recommendations
Table 2 provides the recommendations regarding treatment 
endorsed by each clinical practice guideline, and “supple-
mentary material: Appendix 2” details these recommenda-
tions. All guidelines provided at least one recommendation 
regarding the treatment of LBP.
Recommendations regarding bed rest were provided in 12 
guidelines. Most guidelines [7, 9, 11, 15, 25, 30, 31] (7 out of 
11; 64%) recommend avoiding bed rest for patients with acute 
LBP, and four guidelines [1, 10, 20, 26] (36%) recommend for 
any duration of symptoms. The only exception was the Belgian 
guideline [32] (8%) which notes an absence of evidence on the 
benefits or harms of bed rest when used in the short term.
Recommendations on reassurance or advice for patients with 
non-specific LBP were identified in 14 guidelines. Most guide-
lines (7 out of 12; 58%) recommend advice to maintain normal 
activities for patients with acute LBP [1, 7, 10, 15, 25, 30, 32], 
and some guidelines (42%) recommend the same advice for 
patients with any duration of symptoms [20, 24, 26, 31, 32]. 
In addition, most guidelines (10 out of 14; 71%) recommend 
reassuring the patient that LBP is not a serious illness regardless 
of the duration of symptoms or reassuring patients with acute 
LBP of the favorable prognosis [7, 15, 20, 24–26, 28, 30–32].
The recommendations for the prescription of medication 
vary depending on the class of medication and symptom 
duration. Most guidelines (14 out of 15; 93%) recommend 
the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
for patients with acute and chronic LBP considering the 
risk of adverse events (e.g., renal, cardiovascular, and gas-
trointestinal) [1, 3, 7, 15, 24–26, 28, 32]. For paracetamol/
acetaminophen, while most guidelines recommend in favor 
of this medication [1, 3, 7, 11, 15, 20, 26, 31] (8 out of 
14; 57%), five guidelines [10, 24, 27, 30, 32] (36%) advise 
against the use of paracetamol. The Australian guideline [25] 
recommends the use of paracetamol but advises that clini-
cians and patients should be made aware that the medicine 
might not be effective. Most guidelines (13 out of 15; 87%) 
recommend weak opioids [1, 15, 24, 26, 31, 32] for short 
periods [3, 7, 10, 20, 31, 32], if there is no improvement 
with NSAIDs or other treatments. The guidelines recom-
mend opioids for acute LBP [1, 7, 9–11, 24, 26, 32] (8 out 
of 13; 61%), chronic LBP [1, 3, 10, 27, 31] (38%), and for 
any symptom duration [15, 20] (23%). For antidepressants, 
most guidelines (6 out of 8; 75%) recommend its use for 
patients with chronic LBP where necessary [1, 3, 7, 11, 26, 
28]. For muscle relaxants, most guidelines [1, 7, 11, 20, 26, 
28] (6 out of 11; 54%) recommend this medication for acute 
LBP [1, 26, 28] (3 out of 6; 50%), chronic LBP [1, 7] (33%), 
and for any symptom duration [11, 20] (33%). In contrast, 
five guidelines (5 out of 11; 45%) recommend against mus-
cle relaxants [3, 9, 10, 31, 32]. Two guidelines mentioned 
the use of herbal medicine for LBP (2 out of 15; 13%); one 
recommends its use for patients with chronic LBP [7], but 
the other recommends against it for any type of LBP [10].
Recommendations for referral to a specialist were found in 
13 guidelines. Most guidelines [1, 7, 15, 20, 24, 26, 30, 32] 
(9 out of 13; 69%) recommend referral to a specialist in cases 
where there is suspicion of serious pathologies or radiculopa-
thy. In addition, most guidelines [7, 9, 10, 20, 25, 30, 31] (7 
out of 13; 54%) recommend referral to a specialist if there is 
no improvement after a time period that ranges from 4 weeks 
to 2 years.
Recommendations on invasive treatments (e.g., injec-
tions, surgery, and radiofrequency denervation) for non-
specific LBP were identified in 8 guidelines. Of these, five 
guidelines (5 out of 8; 62%) recommended against the use 
of injections for non-specific LBP [7, 10, 24, 25, 31]. In 
addition, four guidelines [7, 10, 24, 25] (50%) recommend 
against surgery or radiofrequency denervation [7, 10, 25, 
31] (50%) for non-specific LBP. In contrast, three guide-
lines [1, 24, 32] (37%) recommend radiofrequency dener-
vation for chronic LBP; however, two guidelines [24, 32] 
(25%) recommended only in strict circumstances such as 
lack of improvement after conservative treatment, a positive 
response to a medial branch nerve block, and moderate to 
severe back pain. Some guidelines recommend surgery for 
chronic LBP due to disk herniation or spinal instability [1, 
15] and common degenerative disorders [1].
Recommendations for multidisciplinary rehabilitation 
were identified in nine guidelines. Most guidelines (9 out 
11; 90%) recommend multidisciplinary rehabilitation for 
patients with chronic LBP [7, 10, 11, 15, 24–26, 28, 32]. One 
guideline [20] recommends multidisciplinary rehabilitation

for any duration of symptoms, and one guideline [31] rec-
ommends if there is no improvement after monodisciplinary 
approach.
Recommendations for psychosocial strategies were found 
across eleven guidelines. Most guidelines (10 out of 11; 
91%) endorse the use of a cognitive behavior approach [7, 
10, 11, 20, 24–26, 28, 31, 32]. In addition, most guidelines 
(9 out of 11; 82%) recommend these therapies for patients 
with chronic LBP [7, 10, 15, 20, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32] with 
some of them recommending only if psychosocial factors 
are identified [15, 24, 31, 32].
All clinical practice guidelines provided recommenda-
tions for exercise therapy. Most guidelines (10 out of 14; 
71%) recommend exercise therapy for patients with chronic 
LBP [1, 3, 7, 11, 15, 20, 26, 28, 31]. Noteworthy, we identi-
fied great discrepancy in the type of exercise program (e.g.,

acute LBP, but there are some discrepancies on the indi-
cations. The guidelines recommend spinal manipulation 
in addition to usual care [30], if there is no improvement 
after other treatments [7, 31], or in any circumstance [10, 
28]. Three guidelines [15, 24, 32] (33%) recommend spi-
nal manipulation as a component of a multimodal or active 
treatment program for patients with any symptom duration. 
Three guidelines (33%) recommend spinal manipulation as 
a component of a multimodal treatment program [10] or 
in any circumstance for chronic LBP [28]. In contrast, two 
guidelines recommend against spinal manipulation for acute 
LBP [9] or chronic LBP [31].
Similarly, the recommendations for acupuncture were 
inconsistent. Four guidelines [1, 7, 10, 28] recommend the 
use of acupuncture. Of these, three guidelines recommend 
acupuncture for patients with acute and chronic LBP [1, 
28]. One guideline [7, 10] recommends acupuncture as an 
adjunct of an active rehabilitation program for patients with 
chronic LBP. Four out of eight guidelines do not recom-
mend acupuncture [9, 24, 30] (37%) or state that acupunc-
ture should be avoided [25] (13%).
Methods of development of the clinical practice 
guidelines
Table 3 provides the methods of development and imple-
mentation reported by each clinical practice guideline, 
and “supplementary material: Appendix 3” details these 
methods. Most guidelines [1, 7, 10, 11, 15, 20, 24–26, 28, 
30–32] were issued by a multidisciplinary group including 
healthcare professionals such as primary care physicians, 
physical and manual therapists, chiropractors, psychologists, 
orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, and radiologists. The 
African guideline [9] was developed by a medical group, and 
the Brazilian guideline [3] was developed by an association 
comprised of physiatrists.

Most guidelines based their recommendations on system-
atic literature searches of electronic databases and previous 
version of guidelines (14 out of 15; 93%) [1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 15, 
20, 24–26, 28, 30–32], evaluated the strength of the evidence 
(10 out of 15; 67%) [1, 3, 10, 11, 20, 24–28, 30, 32], and 
used consensus in the working group when necessary (11 out 
of 15; 73%) [1, 9–11, 20, 24–26, 30–32]. In addition, most 
guidelines gave direct links between the recommendations 
and the evidence (9 out of 15; 60%) [1, 3, 7, 9–11, 25, 30] 
and provided clear and specific recommendations (11 out of 
15; 73%) [1, 7, 10, 20, 24–26, 28, 30–32]. In contrast, few 
guidelines provided sufficient information regarding their 
external review process (5 out of 15; 33%) [20, 24, 28, 30, 
32] and the time frame for updates (4 out of 15; 27%) [10, 
24, 26, 30]. Where it was reported, this ranged from 2 to 
5 years.
Most guidelines were available on the website of the par-
ticipating organization, and some guidelines [3, 10, 11, 28, 
30] were published in scientific journals. Most guidelines (9 
out of 15; 60%) were accompanied by additional materials 
for dissemination [1, 7, 10, 20, 24–26, 31, 32] such as dif-
ferent versions for patients and clinicians, a care pathway, a 
summary version, an interactive flowchart, or videos. A few 
guidelines (6 out of 15; 40%) reported strategies or the bar-
riers and facilitators for implementation [1, 20, 24, 26, 32].
Changes in recommendations over time
Few changes were identified in the recommendations on 
diagnosis of non-specific LBP compared to the previous 
guidelines. Currently, most guidelines still recommend the 
assessment of psychosocial factors based on yellow flags 
at the first or second consultation. Of note, an increasing 
proportion (33%) of guidelines are recommending the use 
of validated prognostic screening tools (e.g., STarT Back 
screening tool or Örebro).
Some recommendations changed compared to the previ-
ous guidelines for the use of medications for non-specific 
LBP. Our 2010 overview found a hierarchical order includ-
ing paracetamol as the first choice and NSAIDs as the sec-
ond choice. In this review, we identified that most guidelines 
recommend only the use of NSAIDs as the first choice for 
any duration of symptoms. Of note, most current guidelines 
recommend antidepressants, where necessary, for chronic 
LBP which was not endorsed by the previous guidelines. The 
recommendations regarding the NSAIDs and antidepressants 
were consistent across guidelines included in this review.
We also identified more details on the recommendations 
regarding some approaches compared to the past guidelines. 
The current clinical practice guidelines suggest some types 
of exercise and modes of delivery for patients with chronic 
LBP compared to the previous guidelines which only noted 
the preference for using intensive training. We also found 
recommendations regarding some approaches in this review 
which were not previously cited in past guidelines such as 
the use of herbal medicines, acupuncture, and invasive 
treatments. However, the recommendations regarding these 
approaches were inconsistent or cited in a small proportion 
of guidelines (i.e., less than 50% of the guidelines).
Discussion
Fifteen clinical practice guidelines containing recommen-
dations for non-specific LBP have been issued or updated 
since our last overview in 2010. For the diagnostic recom-
mendations, guidelines recommend diagnostic triage (i.e., 
classification in non-specific LBP, radiculopathy/sciatica, 
and specific LBP), history taking and physical examination 
to identify red flags, neurological testing to identify radicu-
lar pain/radiculopathy, no routine imaging unless serious 
pathology is suspected, and assessment of yellow flags based 
on psychosocial factors cited in the guidelines in the first or 
second evaluation. For treatment of patients with acute LBP, 
most guidelines endorse recommendations for patient educa-
tion, reassurance about a favourable prognosis and advice 
on returning to normal activities, avoiding bed rest, the use 
of NSAIDs and weak opioids for short periods when there 
is contraindication or lack of improvement with NSAIDs. 
For treatment of patients with chronic LBP, most guidelines 
recommend the use of NSAIDs and antidepressants where 
necessary, prescription of exercise therapy, and psychoso-
cial interventions. In addition, considering referring to a 
specialist is recommended in case of serious pathologies or 
radiculopathy, or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks 
to 2 years.
Discrepancies in the recommendations 
across the guidelines
We identified discrepancies in the recommendations for the 
use of paracetamol, muscle relaxants, and herbal medicines. 
For paracetamol, the most recent guidelines [10, 24, 28, 30, 
32] do not recommend this medication. This change might 
be attributable to recent studies demonstrating the lack of 
efficacy of paracetamol for non-specific LBP [29, 36]. In 
addition, the inconsistent recommendations for the use of 
muscle relaxants, and herbal medicines might be attribut-
able to different care settings and cultural context across 
the countries.
Most guidelines recommend the use of weak opioids for 
short periods if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not effective 
for patients with acute LBP, despite an absence of relevant 
clinical trials as demonstrated by a recent systematic review 
[2]. Considering the rising prescription of opioids [22], the 
use of this pain medication has been discouraged due to 
 2801
European Spine Journal (2018) 27:2791–2803 
1 3
the small benefit on pain intensity in chronic LBP as well 
as potential side effects (e.g., misuse or physical depend-
ence) [2, 23]. Although the current review found that most 
guidelines recommend opioids for acute LBP, this recom-
mendation is not supported by the evidence and may result 
in increased harms for patients with non-specific LBP.
The recommendations on spinal manipulation and acu-
puncture are inconsistent but in different aspects. The rec-
ommendations on spinal manipulation vary mainly regard-
ing the circumstances in which the intervention should be 
administered (e.g., any circumstance, in addition to usual 
care, after lack of improvement). The recommendations on 
acupuncture have discrepancies related to its use in patients 
with non-specific LBP. In addition, four guidelines [1, 7, 10, 
28] recommend acupuncture, but disagree regarding dura-
tion of symptoms. These discrepancies might be attributable 
to the lack of high-quality evidence which may result in rec-
ommendations based on group consensus considering dif-
ferent aspects. Future studies should be conducted to clarify 
these recommendations.
Few changes in the recommendations over time
Although the number of randomised controlled trials has 
nearly doubled since 2010, the recommendations regard-
ing management remain similar compared to the previous 
review. We identified an increasing proportion (33%) of 
guidelines recommending the assessment of yellow flags 
using prognostic screening tools [10, 24, 25, 32]. This 
might be attributable to a recent randomised clinical trial 
that showed small improvements from targeting treatment 
based on responses to a validated prognostic screening tool 
[12]. However, this was based on one study only, and a 
recent review [16] found that screening tools poorly identify 
patients who will develop chronic pain and worse outcomes 
in patients with LBP. Future studies should be conducted 
before any definitive conclusion can be made regarding the 
use of prognostic models.
The guidelines still uniformly recommend exercise for 
chronic LBP. However, the clinical practice guidelines are 
now suggesting a greater variety of types of exercise. For 
example, guidelines include options such as sports reha-
bilitation, physical activity as tolerated, aquatic exercises, 
stretching, aerobic, strength training, endurance, motor 
control exercise, yoga, and tai-chi. Although the guidelines 
endorsing some types of exercise increased [1, 7, 20, 24, 26, 
28], there is no consistency in the recommendations favour-
ing one particular modality. Hence, we would argue that 
the choice may rely on patients’ preferences and therapists’ 
experience.
Future developments in research and guideline 
development
Our overview included clinical practice guidelines that 
issued recommendations for patients with nonspecific LBP. 
Although some guidelines also include recommendations for 
different types of LBP, future studies should investigate the 
recommendations for radicular pain/radiculopathy and spe-
cific LBP. Another limitation of this review is the absence 
of quality assessment of the guidelines using a validated tool 
(e.g., AGREE). Nevertheless, we provided an overview of 
the methods of the clinical practice guidelines included in 
the current review.
Based on the recommendations for the development 
of guidelines for LBP provided by the previous review, 
the methods for developing the guidelines seem to have 
improved over the years (Box 3). Most guidelines provided 
a description for obtaining the evidence to be used in the 
recommendations, with some describing the method for 
assessing the strength of the evidence (Recommendation 1). 
However, only two guidelines [20, 30] (13%) included non-
English publications (Recommendation 2). The target group 
and the committee of the guideline were well described 
(Recommendations 3 and 4). A substantial proportion (53%) 
of guidelines provided a direct link between the evidence 
and recommendations (Recommendation 5). Although an 
increasing number of guidelines reported details regard-
ing the consensus methods, this topic was still not appro-
priately described by the guidelines (Recommendation 6). 
One issue that remained over the years was that the clini-
cal practice guidelines did not often incorporate informa-
tion regarding effectiveness and health benefits as well as 
the cost-effectiveness (Recommendation 7). As mentioned 
earlier, the strategies for dissemination of the guidelines 
have improved substantially with several types of materi-
als available for patients and clinicians. However, although 
the details regarding implementation also improved, most 
guidelines did not specify the strategies as well as the barri-
ers and facilitators for implementation in the clinical practice 
(Recommendation 8). In addition, few guidelines [10, 24, 
26, 30] provided the methods and time frame for updating 
(Recommendation 9).
Conclusion
The current clinical practice guidelines recommend diagnos-
tic triage using history taking and physical examination to 
identify red flags and neurological testing to identify radicu-
lar pain/radiculopathy, against routine imaging unless seri-
ous pathology is suspected, and assessment of yellow flags 
based on psychosocial factors cited in the guidelines in the 
first or second evaluation. For acute LBP, most guidelines

endorsed recommendations for patient education, reassur-
ance about the favourable prognosis and advice on returning 
to normal activities, avoiding bed rest, the use of NSAIDs 
and weak opioids for short periods where necessary. For 
chronic LBP, most guidelines recommended the use of 
NSAIDs and antidepressants where necessary, prescription 
of exercise therapy, and psychosocial interventions. In addi-
tion, referring to a specialist is recommended in cases where 
there is suspicion of serious pathologies or radiculopathy or 
if there is no improvement after 4 weeks to 2 years.
