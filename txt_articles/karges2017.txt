IMPORTANCE Insulin pump therapy may improve metabolic control in young patients with
type 1 diabetes, but the association with short-term diabetes complications is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are
lower with insulin pump therapy compared with insulin injection therapy in children,
adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study conducted between
January 2011 and December 2015 in 446 diabetes centers participating in the Diabetes
Prospective Follow-up Initiative in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Patients with type 1
diabetes younger than 20 years and diabetes duration of more than 1 year were identified.
Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses with age,
sex, diabetes duration, migration background (defined as place of birth outside of Germany
or Austria), body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin as covariates were used to account
for relevant confounders.
EXPOSURES Type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy or with multiple (�4) daily
insulin injections.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were rates of severe hypoglycemia and
diabetic ketoacidosis during the most recent treatment year. Secondary outcomes included
glycated hemoglobin levels, insulin dose, and body mass index.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among young patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin pump
therapy, compared with insulin injection therapy, was associated with lower risks of severe
hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and with better glycemic control during the most
recent year of therapy. These findings provide evidence for improved clinical outcomes
associated with insulin pump therapy compared with injection therapy in children,
adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes.

 T
he use of insulin pumps for intensive insulin therapy
among patients with type 1 diabetes has substantially
increased from 0.6% to 1.3% in 1995 to 44% to 47% be-
tween 2012 and 2016.1-4 Pump therapy with rapid-acting in-
sulin allows for a more physiologic insulin replacement and
may thus contribute to improved metabolic control, thereby
reducing the risk of long-term complications.5,6 Randomized
clinicaltrials7andobservationalstudies3,4,8,9haveshownlower
levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with insulin pump
therapy than with multiple daily insulin injections. Insulin
pumps have also become an integral part of closed-loop treat-
ment systems (“artificial beta cell” systems) in which subcu-
taneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring
devices are linked to automatically deliver insulin in re-
sponse to current and predicted glucose levels.10-12
Several studies reported an increased risk of ketoacidosis
associatedwithinsulinpumptherapyinpediatricpatientswith
diabetes,8,9,13raising concerns about the safety of pump
therapy.Adeclineinthefrequencyofseverehypoglycemiadur-
ing recent years along with an increase in insulin pump use has
been observed,1,14 but a causal relationship between insulin
regimen and outcome remains controversial.15 The associa-
tion of pump therapy with the risk of acute diabetes compli-
cations has not been comprehensively studied in direct com-
parison to injection therapy, because evaluating rare events
such as severe hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis requires ad-
equately sized large datasets.
The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of
current insulin pump therapy, compared with injection
therapy, in young patients with type 1 diabetes using a large
population-based clinical practice database to identify par-
ticipants. We hypothesized that insulin pump therapy, com-
pared with injection therapy, would be associated with
reduced rates of acute diabetes complications and lower
HbA1c levels.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
This was a population-based cohort study comparing
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who used insulin
pump therapy and patients who used insulin injection
therapy between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015.
Patients included in the study were identified from the
Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) Initiative database
at the University of Ulm, Germany. As of December 31, 2015,
446 diabetes centers (hospitals and practices) in Germany,
Austria, Luxembourg, and Switzerland have documented
treatment and outcome of diabetes care using the DPV Dia-
betes Documentation System.1,16,17 Parameters collected
in the DPV system have been described previously.17 Twice
a year, locally collected longitudinal data are transmitted
anonymously for central analysis, and inconsistent data are
reported back to participating centers. The DPV database
covers an estimated proportion of more than 80% of all
pediatric patients with diabetes in Germany, Austria, and
Luxembourg.
InformedconsentforparticipationintheDPVInitiativewas
obtainedfrompatientsortheirparentsbyverbalorwrittenpro-
cedure, as approved by the responsible administrators for data
protectionofeachcenter.Theanalysisofanonymizeddatawas
approved by the ethics committee of the University of Ulm.
Study Population
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had a
clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and were treated with
intensive insulin therapy administered by either pump or
injection, defined as 4 or more insulin injections per day.
Exclusion criteria were younger than 6 months at diagnosis;
20 years or older; diabetes duration less than 1 year; use of 3
or fewer daily insulin injections; and use of continuous glu-
cose monitoring. All patients continuously used either pump
therapy or injection therapy during the entire observation
period of 12 months, thus excluding treatment crossover. For
each patient, clinical data including HbA1c level, total daily
insulin dose, prandial to total insulin ratio, frequency of self-
monitoring of blood glucose level, and body mass index
(BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) of the most recent treatment year were
aggregated as medians, and hypoglycemic and ketoacidosis
events were summed and related to the individual time at
risk, as described previously.16
Propensity Score Analyses
Propensity score matching was used to ensure that both the
pump therapy group and injection therapy group had similar
baseline characteristics, because patients who are presented
with the option of using pump therapy may have different
baseline characteristics, affording them the opportunity to
use this technology. Propensity score for pump therapy was
estimated applying a multivariable logistic regression model,
with age, sex, duration of diabetes, migration background,
BMI, and HbA1c level as covariates. Migration background
was defined as birthplace outside of Germany or Austria for
the patient or of 1 or both parents. For each patient, the prob-
ability (propensity score) for pump therapy was estimated
from the logistic model based on the patient’
s specific covari-
ate values. Matching was conducted with a one-to-one
Key Points
Question Are the rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic
ketoacidosis lower with insulin pump therapy than with insulin
injection therapy in young patients with type 1 diabetes?
Findings In this population-based observational study including
30 579 young patients with type 1 diabetes, pump therapy,
compared with injection therapy, was associated with significantly
lower rates of severe hypoglycemia (9.55 vs 13.97 per 100
patient-years) and ketoacidosis (3.64 vs 4.26 per 100
patient-years), and with lower hemoglobin A1c levels (8.04% vs
8.22%) in a propensity score–matched cohort.
Meaning Insulin pump therapy was associated with reduced risks
of short-term diabetes complications and with better glycemic
control compared with injection therapy.

 matching process (greedy-matching algorithm).18,19 Stan-
dardized differences were assessed to evaluate balancing of
covariates between treatment groups. A standardized differ-
ence of less than 10% for a baseline covariate reveals a negli-
gible imbalance.18 Treatment effects were estimated by
directly comparing outcomes between an equal number of
pump-treated and injection-treated individuals with the
same propensity score (matched cohort).
Since a considerable proportion of eligible patients were
lost during the matching process, we performed additional ex-
ploratory analyses with inverse probability of treatment
weighting using the propensity score19,20 to estimate the as-
sociation between treatment and outcomes including all eli-
gible patients (entire cohort).
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were the rates of severe hypoglycemia
and diabetic ketoacidosis during the most recent year of
treatment. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as requiring
assistance from another person to actively administer carbo-
hydrates, glucagon, or intravenous glucose consistent with
guidelines from the International Society of Pediatric and
Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD)21 and the American Diabetes
Association.22 Hypoglycemic coma was defined as loss of
consciousness or occurrence of seizures according to ISPAD
classification.23 In preschool children, severe hypoglycemia
was defined as the presence of altered mental status and the
inability to assist in their care, and coma as unconsciousness
or occurrence of convulsions, requiring parenteral treat-
ment.23 Hypoglycemic events and other parameters were
actively enquired and recorded at each medical visit using
the standardized DPV questionnaire across all participating
centers during the whole study period.1,17 Diabetic ketoacido-
sis was defined as pH less than 7.3 or bicarbonate concentra-
tion less than 15 mmol/L (all events) and as severe ketoacido-
sis if pH was less than 7.1 or bicarbonate concentration was
less than 5 mmol/L.24
Secondary outcomes were HbA1c level, total daily insulin
dose, prandial to total insulin ratio, frequency of self-
monitoring of blood glucose level, and BMI during the most
recent year of treatment. HbA1c values were mathematically
standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
reference range (4.05%-6.05%) using the multiple-of-the-
mean transformation method.1 BMI values were transformed
to SD scores based on German reference values by applying the
3 parameter–based lambda-mu-sigma method.16
Statistical Analyses
Event rates of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic coma, dia-
betic ketoacidosis, and severe ketoacidosis were evaluated in
pump therapy and injection therapy by negative binomial
regression analyses including matched pairs (in the matched
cohort) or treatment center (in the entire cohort) as a random
factor. Individuals with no available information on severe
hypoglycemia or coma events were not included in these
regression analyses. In additional analyses, event rates of
severe hypoglycemia, coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, and
severe ketoacidosis were estimated by age groups from nega-
tive binomial regression models including a therapy × age
group interaction term in the matched cohort. Age groups
were defined as 1.5 to 5 years; 6 to 10 years; 11 to 15 years; or
16 to 19 years.
HbA1c levels, total daily insulin dose, prandial to total in-
sulin ratio, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose level,
and BMI were compared between pump therapy and injec-
tion therapy by linear regression analyses, and use of rapid-
acting insulin analogues by logistic regression analysis, in-
cluding matched pairs (in the matched cohort) or treatment
center (in the entire cohort) as a random factor. In additional
analyses, HbA1c levels and the insulin treatment–related para-
meters were estimated stratified by age groups from linear re-
gression models including a therapy × age group interaction
term in the matched cohort.
Results from regression analyses are presented as means,
event rates per 100 patient-years, absolute between-group dif-
ferences, and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with 95% CIs. Ad-
justment for multiple comparisons was performed sepa-
ratelyforthematchedcohortandtheentirecohortconsidering
primary and secondary outcomes by controlling the false dis-
covery rate according to the method of Benjamini and
Hochberg.25 Because the percentage of missing data was small
(0%-6%), no imputation was performed.
P < .05 (2-sided) was considered statistically significant.
All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows, version
9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Study Population
Of the 446 diabetes centers, 350 treated 30 579 individuals
with type 1 diabetes (mean age, 14.1 years [SD, 4.0]; 53% male)
meeting the inclusion criteria (Figure 1), with a mean number
of 4.8 visits (SD, 2.5) per patient during the most recent treat-
ment year. Among the treated patients, 14 119 used insulin
pumptherapy,withamediandurationof3.7years;16 460used
multiple (≥4) daily insulin injections, with a median duration
of 3.6 years. In the propensity score–matched cohort, 9814
patients using insulin pump therapy were matched with 9814
patients using injection therapy from 328 diabetes centers.
In this matched cohort the standardized differences were 1.8%
or less for all baseline characteristics, demonstrating only
minor differences between both treatment groups (Table 1).
The median duration of insulin pump therapy was 3.6 years
and of insulin injection therapy was 4.4 years in the matched
cohort. Since 10 951 individuals were lost during the match-
ing process, we additionally conducted an analysis for the en-
tire cohort with inverse probability of treatment weighting
using propensity scores (Figure 1).
Primary Outcomes
Severe Hypoglycemia
In the matched cohort, a total of 2371 events of severe hypo-
glycemia in 1251 patients (6.4% of patients), including 520
events of hypoglycemic coma in 406 patients (2.1%), were
recorded at 97 451 medical visits during the most recent

 622 patients (2.0%), were documented at 146 919 visits dur-
ing the most recent treatment year. Data on these events were
available for 94% of individuals. Event rates for severe hypo-
glycemia were significantly lower with pump therapy com-
pared with injection therapy (10.30 vs 15.53 per 100 patient-
years; difference per 100 patient-years, −5.23 [95% CI, −6.93

Event rates for hypoglycemic coma were also significantly
lower with pump therapy compared with injection therapy
(2.26 vs 3.43 per 100 patient-years; difference per 100 patient-
years, −1.16 [95% CI, –1.72 to –0.60]; IRR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.55
to 0.80]) (Table 2, Figure 2). These differences remained sig-
nificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (P < .001 for
severe hypoglycemia, P < .001 for hypoglycemic coma).
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
In the matched cohort, a total of 842 events of diabetic keto-
acidosis in 719 patients (3.7% of patients), including 542 events
of severe ketoacidosis (pH <7.1) in 476 patients (2.4%), were
noted during the most recent treatment year. Compared with
injection therapy, pump therapy was associated with signifi-
cantly lower event rates for ketoacidosis (3.64 vs 4.26 per 100
patient-years; difference per 100 patient-years, −0.63 [95% CI,
−1.24 to −0.02]; IRR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.995]) (Table 2,
Figure 2). Event rates for severe ketoacidosis were signifi-

(2.29 vs 2.80 per 100 patient-years; difference per 100 patient-
years, −0.50 [95% CI, −0.99 to −0.02]; IRR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68
to 0.99]) (Table 2, Figure 2). These differences remained sig-
nificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (P = .048 for
diabetic ketoacidosis, P = .048 for severe ketoacidosis).
Age-group analyses showed significantly lower rates of dia-
betic ketoacidosis and severe ketoacidosis with pump therapy
vs injection therapy in adolescents and young adults aged 16
to 19 years but not in other age groups (eFigure 1C and eFig-

with injection therapy (3.17 vs 5.17 per 100 patient-years; dif-
ference per 100 patient-years, −2.00 [95% CI, −2.79 to −1.21];
IRR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.72]) (Table 2, Figure 2). These dif-
ferences remained significant after adjusting for multiple com-
parisons (P < .001 for diabetic ketoacidosis, P < .001 for se-
vere ketoacidosis).
Secondary Outcomes: Metabolic Control
and Insulin Treatment–Related Parameters
In the matched cohort, mean HbA1c level was lower with pump
therapycomparedwithinjectiontherapy(8.04%vs8.22%;dif-
ference, −0.18 [95% CI, −0.22 to −0.13]) (Table 3). In matched
pairs aged 1.5 to 5 years, HbA1c values were similar if treated
with pump therapy or injection therapy, while HbA1c levels
were significantly lower with pump therapy in all other age
groups (all P ≤ .02) (eTable in the Supplement). In the entire
cohort, mean HbA1c level was lower with pump therapy com-
paredwithinjectiontherapy(7.99%vs8.17%;difference,−0.18
[95% CI, −0.21 to −0.15]) (Table 3).
Total daily insulin dose was lower and prandial to total in-
sulin ratio was higher in pump therapy compared with injec-
tion therapy (Table 3), significant for all age groups of the
matched cohort (P < .001 for all) (eFigure 2A and 2B in the
Supplement).Rapid-actinginsulinanalogueswereusedin96%
of patients with pump therapy and 74% of patients with in-
jection therapy (Table 3). The more frequent use of rapid-
acting insulin analogues with pump therapy was observed in
all age groups of the matched cohort (P < .001 for all) (eFig-
ure 2C in the Supplement). Individuals with injection therapy
used long-acting insulin analogues in 80% (matched cohort)
and 77% (entire cohort), respectively.
Mean daily frequency of self-monitoring of blood glu-
cose level was higher with pump therapy compared with in-
jection therapy (Table 3), significant in all age groups (P < .001
for all) (eFigure 2D in the Supplement). There was no differ-
ence in BMI between treatment regimens (Table 3).
Discussion
In this contemporary cohort of young patients with type 1 dia-
betes, the risk of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoaci-
dosisassociatedwithinsulinpumptherapywaslowerthanthat
associated with insulin injection therapy. Pump therapy was
associated with a lower rate of severe hypoglycemia and of hy-
poglycemic coma compared with injection therapy, particu-
larly in school-aged children. Similarly, pump therapy was as-
sociated with a lower rate of diabetic ketoacidosis and severe
ketoacidosisvsinjectiontherapy,especiallyinadolescentsand
young adults. These results favor pump therapy, with lower
ratesofacutecomplicationsand,atthesametime,lowerHbA1c
levels reflecting improved metabolic control. There was no dif-
ference in BMI between treatment regimens.
Single randomized clinical trials comparing pump therapy
with injection therapy have not been sufficiently powered to
assess differences in the rates of severe hypoglycemia or
ketoacidosis.26,27Inapreviousmeta-analysisincluding23trials
(with 976 randomized participants),7 the data suggested that
pump therapy may be better than injection therapy for reduc-
ing the incidence of severe hypoglycemia.7 However, using the
same meta-analysis methodology, the rate ratio for severe hy-
poglycemia in randomized clinical trials of injection therapy
vs pump therapy varied from 1.56 to 3.91, according to the trial
selection.28,29
Another approach to study rare but clinically relevant out-
comes of pump therapy and injection therapy is to analyze ob-
servational data from registry-based documentation of rou-
tine diabetes care. In an analysis from 2015 involving pediatric
patients from 3 diabetes registries,30 bivariable analyses
showed lower ketoacidosis frequency with pump therapy than
with injection therapy. However, in multivariable analysis,
pump therapy was associated with elevated ketoacidosis risk
in children younger than 12 years but with reduced ketoaci-
dosis risk in adolescents aged 13 to 18 years.30 These studies
included patients from different health care systems, with
pump use varying between 11.5% and 56.1% of respective
patients,30 as well as lowest or highest rates of pump therapy
in the youngest patients.3
Thestrengthsofthepresentstudyincludethelargesample
size of a population-based cohort of more than 30 000 pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes, with stringent prospective data col-
lection and a nationwide capture rate of more than 80% of pe-
diatric patients in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Using

 robust statistical methodology including a matched pair ap-
proach, a direct comparison of hypoglycemia and ketoacido-
sis frequencies in pump users and injection users was per-
formed. Sample size and data collection at the time of adverse
event allowed for further categorizing the severity of hypo-
glycemia and ketoacidosis, consistently showing lower event
rates with pump therapy. Whereas previous randomized clini-
cal trials have been too small to assess the risk of these short-
termdiabetescomplications,thisstudyprovidesoutcomedata
inclinicalusethatarelikelyrepresentativeofpatientswithtype
1 diabetes across the pediatric age spectrum and with a dis-
ease duration longer than 1 year.
This study has several limitations. This was a nonrandom-
ized, observational study and thus was prone to residual se-
lection bias despite effective propensity score matching. In-
tensity of diabetes education, motivation, family support, and
mental health factors were not addressed, all relevant to hy-
poglycemia and ketoacidosis risk15,31-33 but difficult to mea-
sure quantitatively in a large population. Another potential
limitation is that the individual duration of insulin pump use
was not considered in the analyses, and a patient adopting this
technology might have a higher frequency of short-term com-
plications. In addition, the use of continuous glucose moni-
toring, which has been shown to improve glycemic control and
reduce HbA1c levels and hypoglycemic events,12,15,26 was not
analyzed in this study. Moreover, the treatment discontinua-
tionrateforinsulinpumptherapywasnotexaminedinthepre-
sent study, but previous studies in the DPV population have
shown a low discontinuation rate of only 4%.34
In the present study, the reduced risk of severe hypogly-
cemiawithpumptherapywasassociatedwithlowertotaldaily
insulin dose and a higher proportion of bolus insulin. These
findings are in accordance with those from previous
studies4,14,35,36 reporting smaller but more frequent single in-
sulindoseswithpumptherapythanwithinjectiontherapy.The
morecommonuseofrapid-actinginsulinanalogueswithpump
therapy in this and other studies allows for more flexible
therapywithlowerglycemicvariability,37leadingtolowerrates

therapy in the present study was associated with more fre-
quent self-monitoring of blood glucose level in patients re-
ceiving pump therapy, as observed in other studies.2,8,35 Pre-

Lower HbA1c levels with pump therapy in this study were as-
sociated with reduced ketoacidosis risk, in line with previous
observations showing lower risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in pa-
tients with lower HbA1c levels.40
The data from the present study may have implications for
the future care of patients with type 1 diabetes. Pump therapy

 is rapidly moving toward semi-independent closed-loop sys-
tems that combine sensor-based continuous glucose moni-
toring and automatic subcutaneous insulin infusion (“artifi-
cial beta cell” systems).10-12 Recent clinical trials have shown
that sensor-responsive insulin delivery may optimize glyce-
mic control by increasing time within target range of glucose
concentrations.15 Results of this study provide further evi-
dence that insulin pump therapy, which is a core element of
artificial beta cell technology, is safe and effective, even in rou-
tine diabetes care for unselected patients at a population-
based level.
Conclusions
Among young patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin pump
therapy, compared with insulin injection therapy, was asso-
ciated with lower risks of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic
ketoacidosis and with better glycemic control during the most
recent year of therapy. These findings provide evidence for im-
provedclinicaloutcomesassociatedwithinsulinpumptherapy
compared with injection therapy in children, adolescents, and
young adults with type 1 diabetes.
