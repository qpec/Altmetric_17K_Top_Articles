 National Variation in Opioid Prescribing and Risk of Prolonged Use for
Opioid-Naive Patients Treated in the Emergency Department for Ankle
Sprains
Abstract
Between 2011 and 2015, nearly one in four patients with ankle sprains were prescribed opioids in the
emergency department. The overall prescribing rate declined during the study period, but varied significantly
by state, ranging from 2.8% in North Dakota to 40% in Arkansas. Patients prescribed the largest amounts of
opioid were nearly five times more likely to transition to continued use as those prescribed lesser amounts.

 THE QUESTION
Long-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. Most 
patients prescribed opioids for acute pain are left with extra opioid tablets, 
which present a risk for diversion or misuse. Furthermore, most people 
in the U.S. who have misused prescription opioids were given them by 
a friend, family member, or a doctor, and most who abuse heroin first 
abused prescriptions opioids. In response to the ongoing epidemic of 
opioid deaths, many states, insurers, pharmacy chains, and most recently 
the federal government have advocated supply limits on new opioid 
prescriptions, ranging from as little as a 3-day supply to no more than a 
7-day supply. Whether these policies will reduce the number of opioid 
tablets entering the community, and/or limit the number of patients 
transitioning to long-term use, remains unclear, as do the possible 
unintended consequences.
T
o understand current patterns of opioid prescribing for an 
uncomplicated, self-limited condition, the authors studied a national 
sample of patients treated in an emergency department (ED) for an ankle 
sprain between 2011 and 2015. They analyzed private insurance claims 
for opioid-naïve patients to determine patient- and state-level variation 
in opioid prescribing, and the association between the amount of opioid 
prescribed and transition to continued use (defined as filling at least 
four opioid prescriptions in the subsequent 30 to 180 days.) The authors 
standardized the amount of opioids prescribed by converting quantity of 
tablets and days supplied to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs).
THE FINDINGS
The study included 30,832 patients treated in the ED for an ankle sprain 
who had not filled a prescription for opioids in the previous six months. 
The overall prescription rate declined from 28.1% in 2011 to 20.4% in 
2015. The national median rate was 24.1%. Hydrocodone was the most 
commonly prescribed opioid (64.9%), followed by tramadol (16.2%), 
oxycodone (14.4%), and codeine (5.5%).
The median number of tablets prescribed per patient was 16, median 
total MMEs was 100, and median days supplied was three. Less than 
five percent of patients were given more than 225 MMEs (equivalent to 
more than 30 tablets of oxycodone). Patients prescribed more than 225 
MMEs had a risk-adjusted probability of transition to continued use five 
times greater than patients prescribed 75 MMEs or less (4.9% vs 1.1%). 
The probability of continued use was even greater for patients prescribed 
higher-potency drugs (hydrocodone and oxycodone). Among patients 
with prolonged use, most subsequent prescriptions were not associated 
with the initial ankle injury, but rather other conditions, such as headache 
or back pain.
State-level prescribing rates ranged from 40% in Arkansas to 2.8% in 
North Dakota in 2014 and 2015. The authors compared the observed 
prescribing rates with expected rates, taking socioeconomic, demographic 
and other patient-level clinical risk factors into account. Southern states 
accounted for most of the higher-than-expected prescribing rates (Figure 
1). Reducing excess variation in state-level prescribing could significantly 
reduce the number of pills entering the community. For example,

reducing states’ above-average prescribing rates to the median of 24.1% 
would result in 18,300 fewer tablets prescribed. Similarly, if states that 
dispensed quantities above the median reduced prescribing to match the 
median (16 tablets), it would result in 32,000 fewer tablets prescribed.
THE IMPLICATIONS
Opioid prescriptions for ankle sprain remain common and highly variable. 
This is concerning because ankle sprain is a minor, self-limited condition 
for which pain usually improves within two weeks. The findings support 
efforts to keep opioid-naive patients opioid naive, and to use the smallest 
quantities of opioid possible for treatment of acute pain.
Patients prescribed greater quantities of opioid were nearly five times 
more likely to transition to continued use. This points to the need to 
examine amounts prescribed and the risk of long-term use in other 
contexts in which prescriptions are much larger, such as for postoperative 
pain. By focusing on ankle sprains, which usually resolve quickly without 
development of chronic pain, this study suggests that prolonged use may 
have been due to other factors such as patients requesting opioids as 
default pain control, or development of misuse or dependence.
Significant statewide variation suggests ample opportunity to reduce 
excessive prescribing. Additionally, most current guidelines are written 
with regard to days supplied; however, the lack of specificity about how 
many tablets and MMEs constitute a day’s supply is problematic. A 7-day 
prescription could vary anywhere from one to 84 tablets, or 7.5 to 630 
MMEs. Higher-risk prescriptions of 225 MMEs could still fall within 5- or 
7-day supply-limit policies aimed at promoting safer opioid prescribing. 
Since decreasing the number of leftover tablets is critical to reducing 
diversion and overdoses, prescribing guidelines based on tablet quantities 
or MMEs may be more useful. A promising approach is implementing 
default opioid quantities (e.g., 10 tablets) in the electronic medical record, 
which has been shown to significantly shift ED discharge prescribing 
patterns to the default quantity and is consistent with emergency 
department prescribing guidelines in many states.  If widely adopted, 
default orders have the potential to decrease the number of leftover 
opioid tablets in the community, but still allow clinicians to adjust the 
orders according to their patient’s needs.  Finally, there is need for clearer 
guidelines for pain management strategies by indication and setting, 
including when opioids should not be considered the first-line treatment.  
THE STUDY
The authors analyzed claims data of 13 million privately insured enrollees 
in the U.S. and identified all first-time ED encounters for ankle sprains in 
patients older than 18 between 2011 and 2015. They excluded patients 
who had any other injury diagnosis, and those who had recurrent visits for 
ankle sprain during the study period to reduce likelihood of a severe initial 
injury.
The authors described variation in opioid prescription rate and 
characteristics at the patient and state levels and over time. They 
modeled patients’ expected probability of receiving an opioid 
prescription, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors 
and prior history of drug abuse and mental illness. They then calculated 
observed to expected state-level prescribing ratios.  State-level analysis 
was limited to those treated in 2014-2015, and excluded states with fewer 
than 25 patients in the study sample.
The authors quantified the number of tablets that would be prevented 
from entering the community from reducing excess variation by reducing 
states’ above-median prescribing rates to the median, and above-median 
prescription supplies to the median. Finally, they quantified the risk-
adjusted association between initial MMEs prescribed and transition to 
prolonged use.
