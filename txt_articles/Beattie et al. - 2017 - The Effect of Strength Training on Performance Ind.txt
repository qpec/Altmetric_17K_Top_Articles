Abstract 
Running economy (RE) and velocity at maximal oxygen uptake (V O
V
&
2 max) are considered to 
be the best physiological performance indicators in elite distance runners.  In addition to 
cardiovascular function, RE and V O
V
&
2 max are partly dictated by neuromuscular factors.  One 
technique to improve neuromuscular function in athletes is through strength training.  The 
aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 40 week strength training intervention on 
strength (maximal- & reactive-strength), V O
V
&
2max,  economy and body composition (body 
mass, fat & lean mass) in competitive distance runners.  Twenty competitive distance runners 
were divided into an intervention group (n = 11; 29.5 ± 10.0 years; 72.8 ± 6.6 kg; 1.83 ± 0.08 
m) and a control group (n = 9; 27.4 ± 7.2 years; 70.2 ± 6.4 kg; 1.77 ± 0.04 m).  During week 
0, 20 and 40, each subject completed three assessments: physiology (v2mmol/L BLa, 
v4mmol/L BLa, RE, V O
V
&
2max, O
V
&
2max), strength (1RM back squat; countermovement jump & 
0.3m drop-jump) and body composition (body mass, fat mass, overall-lean & leg-lean).  The 
intervention group showed significant improvements in maximal- and reactive-strength 
qualities, RE and V O
V
&
2max, at weeks 20 (p < 0.05) and 40 (p < 0.05).   The control group 
showed no significant changes at either time point.  There were no significant changes in 
body composition variables between or within groups.  This study demonstrates that forty 
weeks of strength training can significantly improve maximal- and reactive-strength qualities, 
RE and vVO2max, without concomitant hypertrophy, in competitive distance runners.   
Key Words: strength, running economy, V O

INTRODUCTION 
1 
Performance in distance running is multi-faceted; relying on an intricate interaction of 
2 
physiological, biomechanical and psychological factors.  Even within the physiological 
3 
domain, there is a complex synergy between the central and peripheral system’s role in 
4 
facilitating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regeneration for sustained running locomotion (4). 
5 
Since the original work of Hill & Lupton (15), there has been an abundance of research 
6 
studies investigating the role of maximal oxygen consumption ( O
V
&
2max) in distance running.  
7 
Research has shown strong relationships between 
O
V
&
2max and middle- (800m, r = 0.75) and 
8 
long-distance (marathon, r = 0.78) performance in heterogeneous groups (17, 37).  Due to 
9 
this, maximal oxygen uptake ( O
V
&
2max) protocols have been traditionally used in the 
10 
laboratory to monitor and predict the performance potential of both middle- and long-distance 
11 
runners.  However, at elite long-distance level (marathon time < 2 h 30 min), the relationship 
12 
between 
O
V
&
2max and performance is weak (r = 0.01), and it is likely that this relationship is 
13 
negligible at ‘world-class’ standard (marathon time < 2 h 10 min) (37).  A high O
V
&
2max (> 70 
14 
mL/kg/min) may be a pre-requisite to be an elite distance runner, but additional physical 
15 
qualities are needed to succeed at this level.  Key performance indicators such as running 
16 
economy (RE), velocity at maximal oxygen uptake (V O
V
&
2max) and anaerobic function 
17 
(velocity during maximum anaerobic running test: vMART; & max-velocity sprinting) have 
18 
been established as superior markers of success in these elite populations (5). 
19 
RE is defined as the metabolic cost to cover a given distance at a constant velocity (36).  
20 
RE represents the ability of a runner to translate cellular energy production into running 
21 
locomotion and is normally expressed as the volume of oxygen consumption per unit of body 
22 
mass required to run a kilometer (mL/kg/km) (36).  RE has been shown to be a stronger 
23 
indicator of performance than O
V
&
2max alone within elite homogenous populations, with inter-
24 
individual variability ranging between 20-30% (27).  The east African dominance in distance 
25

running has been partly attributed to their superior economy (36).  RE is determined by the 
26 
athlete’s 
physiology, 
anthropometrics, 
biomechanics 
and 
environment; 
however 
27 
improvements in RE may be difficult to obtain in trained runners, and therefore any novel 
28 
training modality that results in marginal improvements may be crucial for success (2). 
29 
The velocity attained at O
V
&
2max (V O
V
&
2max) is a ‘functional’ expression of maximal oxygen 
30 
consumption in velocity units (km/h).  V O
V
&
2max is a composite of both maximal oxygen 
31 
consumption and economy.  Due to this, the variable has shown to be strongly associated 
32 
with elite middle- (r = 0.71) (17) and long-distance (r = 0.89–0.94) (27) running performance.  
33 
Even though O
V
&
2max may remain stable throughout an elite distance runner’s career, research 
34 
has shown that the velocity at 
O
V
&
2max can improve by approximately 14% (19).  This 
35 
demonstrates that elite distance runners can improve their ability to translate maximal aerobic 
36 
energy production into faster running velocities.   During middle-distance events (800m & 
37 
1500m), or sprint finishes in long-distance events where velocities exceed V O
V
&
2max, the 
38 
contribution of the anaerobic energy system is increased (27). Endurance-specific ‘muscle 
39 
power’ is the ability of the neuromuscular system to rapidly produce force following a 
40 
sustained period of high-intensity exercise (high glycolytic and/or oxidative energy demand) 
41 
(28).  This ability may be the differentiating factor for succeeding in elite distance running 
42 
(i.e. sprint finish).  Therefore, rate of force development (RFD) is essential not only in short-
43 
distance events (i.e. 100m, 200m & 400m), but also in middle- and long-distance running.   
44 
Consequently, in addition to cardiovascular capacity, limitations to elite distance running 
45 
performance may be dictated by peripheral neuromuscular force production ability. 
46 
One training technique for improving rate of force production in athletes is strength 
47 
training.  Early work from Paavolainen et al (29, 30) demonstrated that the neuromuscular 
48 
adaptations from strength training (i.e. musculotendinous stiffness, motor unit recruitment 
49 
and synchronization, rate coding, intra- and intermuscular coordination & neural inhibition)

(10, 45) have the potential to improve performance in distance runners (44) by improving RE 
51 
(2), V O
V
&
2max and/or anaerobic function (24). However, strength training is generally still an 
52 
uncommon physical preparation modality in the distance running community.  This is most 
53 
likely due to the ‘hypertrophic’ connotations associated with lifting weights, with distance 
54 
runners inadvertently linking strength adaptations to increased musculature and body mass - 
55 
which would potentially negatively affect relative physiological performance parameters (i.e. 
56 
O
V
&
2max, RE).  Nonetheless, a recent systematic review by Beattie et al (5) in competitive 
57 
distance runners reported that strength training can improve 3 km (2.7%, ES = 0.13) (38) and 
58 
5 km time-trial performance (3.1%) (30), economy (4.0 – 8.1%, ES: 0.3 – 1.03) (6, 21, 24, 
59 
30, 32, 38, 40), V O
V
&
2max (1.2%, ES: 0.43 – 0.49) (6, 24) and maximum anaerobic running 
60 
velocity (VMART) (3%) (24, 30). However, Beattie et al.’s (5) review showed that the 
61 
strength interventions in these studies were relatively short-term (~ 8 weeks), and used 
62 
inadequate exercises (i.e. machine-based, isolated exercises) that may have limited optimal 
63 
strength development of the leg musculature for distance running performance (41).  
64 
Therefore, the current study addressed for the strength and conditioning community, the 
65 
uncertainty surrounding long term adaptations to strength training in trained distance runners 
66 
(1500 m – 10 000 m). 
67 
To our knowledge, the effects of a strength training intervention longer than 10 weeks, on 
68 
V O
V
&
2max and RE in distance runners, is unknown.  Therefore, the aim of the current study was 
69 
to investigate the effect of a 40 week (20 week pre-season & 20 week in-season) strength 
70 
training intervention on strength qualities (maximal- & reactive-strength), key physiology 
71 
performance indicators (V O
V
&
2max and RE) and body composition in collegiate and national-
72 
level distance runners (1500 m – 10 000 m).  The experimental approach to answer this 
73 
research question was to conduct a 40 week longitudinal strength intervention study with a 
74 
parallel control group, measuring physiological, strength and body composition variables at 
75

weeks 0, 20 and 40.  We hypothesised that a 40 week strength intervention in distance 
76 
runners would result in significant changes in strength qualities (maximal- & reactive-
77 
strength), key physiology performance indicators (V O
V
&
2max & RE) and body composition. 
78 
METHODS 
79 
Experimental approach to the problem 
80 
To investigate the hypothesis of the study, a longitudinal and controlled experimental 
81 
design was used to investigate the effect of a 40 week  (20 week pre-season & 20 week in-
82 
season) strength training intervention on strength qualities (maximal- & reactive-strength), 
83 
key physiology performance indicators (V O
V
&
2max and economy) and body composition in 
84 
collegiate and national-level distance runners (1500 m – 10 000 m). A two group, repeated 
85 
measures (pre-, mid- and post-testing) design was used. After an 8-week off-season, subjects 
86 
were divided into the two groups based on their ability to adhere to the study conditions (i.e. 
87 
time commitments and location relative to training facility).  The two groups consisted of an 
88 
intervention group (endurance training AND strength training: n = 11; 29.5 ± 10.0 years; 72.8 
89 
± 6.6 kg; 1.83 ± 0.08 m) and a control group (endurance training ONLY: n = 9; 27.4 ± 7.2 
90 
years; 70.2 ± 6.4 kg; 1.77 ± 0.04 m).  There were no significant differences between groups at 
91 
baseline for all measures.  All athletes and coaches were instructed not to deviate from their 
92 
normal 1500 m – 10 000 m endurance training.   It is known that the control group did not 
93 
employ any strength training as part of their normal training programme. Due to the extensive 
94 
longitudinal nature of the study, endurance training (volume & intensity) was not controlled. 
95 
In addition to their endurance training, the intervention group strength trained twice a 
96 
week during the pre-season period (weeks 1-20, December – March, winter months), and 
97 
once a week during the in-season ‘racing’ period (weeks 20-40, April – July, summer 
98 
months) (see Figure 1).  All strength sessions were coached by an experienced UK Strength

& Conditioning Association (UKSCA) accredited coach (the lead author).  Each strength 
100 
session lasted approximately sixty minutes (see Table 1). 
101 
Subjects 
102 
Thirty competitive collegiate and national-level distance runners (1500 m – 10 000 m) 
103 
participated in the study, however due to unrelated injury and time commitment, twenty 
104 
subjects (n = 20; 28.2 ± 8.6 years; 71.6 ± 6.6 kg; 1.80 ± 0.07 m) completed the study.  The 
105 
subjects had a mean maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 61.3 ± 3.2 mL/kg/min, which is 
106 
close to the BASES ‘national-level’ physiological standard (65-75 mL/kg/min) for male 
107 
distance runners (Jones, 2006).  It is also important to note that all subjects had no strength 
108 
training experience.  All subjects were recruited through poster and email.  After being 
109 
informed of the benefits and potential risks of the investigation, each subject completed a 
110 
health-screening questionnaire and provided written informed consent prior to participation in 
111 
the study. All experimental procedures were ratified by the University of Limerick Research 
112 
Ethics Committee in accordance with the provisions of the most recent Declaration of 
113 
Helsinki.

Strength, Physiology & Body Composition Assessment   
120 
During week 0, 20 and 40, each subject completed three assessment days: physiology, 
121 
strength and a body composition assessment day. All strength, physiology and body 
122 
composition assessments were undertaken at the same time of day to avoid diurnal variation 
123 
in performance.  There were 48 hours between each testing day.  To control the effect of diet 
124

and physical readiness, each subject was asked to consume a habitual diet and avoid alcohol 
125 
(< 48 hours), limit caffeine ingestion (< 4 hours), and avoid vigorous exercise (< 24 hours) 
126 
prior to assessments. For body composition assessment, participants reported to the 
127 
laboratory following a 3h fast, having consumed 500ml of water, one hour prior to 
128 
measurement.   
129 
 
130 
Strength Assessment   
131 
Prior to the strength assessment day, each subject carried out a familiarisation day to 
132 
ensure habituation with the back squat, countermovement jump and drop-jump tests.  The 
133 
familiarisation day included the same protocol as the strength assessment day (see below).  
134 
Also, all subjects were familiarised with the physiological measurement equipment during the 
135 
warm-up period before physiological measurements (v2mmol/L BLa, v4mmol/L BLa, RE, 
136 
V O
V
&
2max, O
V
&
2max) were taken.  Before back squat 1 repetition maximum (RM) testing, each 
137 
subject completed a five minute warm-up (self-myofascial release, stretching and dynamic 
138 
mobility exercises).  Following completion of the warm-up, subjects started the back squat 1 
139 
RM testing protocol to assess maximal-strength (25). This protocol consisted of a warm-up of 
140 
10 repetitions at 50% of their [estimated] 1RM load, 5 x 70% 1RM, 3 x 80% 1RM, and 1 x 
141 
90% 1RM.  Each participant’s 1RM was estimated by the researcher based on the athlete’s 
142 
body mass, age and gender (25). Following the warm-up protocol, each subject had three 
143 
attempts to determine their actual 1RM (with 3 minutes in between sets).  To ensure safe 
144 
conditions during testing, a box was set at the lowest depth the athlete could squat while 
145 
keeping optimal lumbar spinal position.  Therefore, squat depth was specific to each subject 
146 
and knee angles ranged from 90o - 120o flexion.  Only trials in which the subject touched the 
147 
box were considered successful lifts.  The knee flexion angle was recorded to ensure the same 
148 
squat depth during week 0, 20 and 40 assessments.

Approximately ten minutes after the 1RM back squat, subjects started the reactive-
150 
strength assessment.  Reactive-strength movements are categorised depending on their slow 
151 
or fast stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) characteristics (34). Slow SSC function was assessed 
152 
through a countermovement jump (CMJ), and fast SSC function was assessed through a 0.3m 
153 
drop-jump.  Both jumps were performed on a force platform (AMTI OR6-5; AMTI, 
154 
Watertown, MA, USA) operating at a sampling rate of 1000Hz.  Each subject addressed the 
155 
CMJ in a standing position while keeping their hands on their hips in order to restrict arm 
156 
movement.  After instruction, subjects initiated the jump via a downward countermovement.  
157 
All subjects were instructed to choose a depth that they felt would maximise jump height. For 
158 
each trial the subject was told to “jump as high as possible”. Two minutes recovery was given 
159 
between jumps.  Three jumps were performed with the highest value used for analysis.  
160 
Following CMJs, subjects performed three individual drop-jumps from a 0.3 m box onto a 
161 
force platform.  Each jump was separated by two minutes of recovery.  Prior to each drop-
162 
jump, the subject was instructed to step forward off the box, and on contact with the platform 
163 
to immediately jump as high as possible.  They were also instructed to keep their hands on 
164 
their hips in order to restrict arm movement.  Three drop-jumps were performed with the 
165 
highest reactive-strength index [RSI = jump height (m) / contact time (s)] used for analysis.   
166 
 
167 
Physiology Assessment 
168 
All physiological variables ( O
V
&
2max, v O
V
&
2max, RE, v2mmol/L & v4mmol/L BLa) were 
169 
determined during a two-part treadmill protocol (H/P/Cosmos Pulsar treadmill, H/P/Cosmos 
170 
Sports & Medical gmbh, Germany).  The treadmill was set at 1% gradient throughout the 
171 
protocol.  Oxygen consumption was determined continuously using a gas analyser (MOXUS, 
172 
Model DC-3A, AEI Technologies, Naperville, IL, USA).   Before each test, the metabolic 
173 
cart was calibrated for air flow, and the gas analyser was calibrated against a certified gas

mixture.  Prior to the protocol, each subject warmed-up on the treadmill for ten minutes.  The 
175 
first five minutes was completed at a velocity that was 7 km/h slower than their estimated 4 
176 
mmol/L blood lactate velocity (v4mmol/L BLa), and the second five minutes at a speed that 
177 
was 6 km/h slower than v4mmol/L. Following the warm-up, a resting BLa sample was taken 
178 
using a Lactate Pro Analyser (Lactate Pro, ARKAY Europe, Amstelveen, Netherlands). 
179 
The first part of the treadmill protocol consisted of a twenty minute sub-maximal 
180 
‘step’ test.  The step test consisted of five, four minute stages.  Each stage was four minutes 
181 
in length to allow for steady-state oxygen consumption, heart rate and BLa levels. The first 
182 
stage was performed at a velocity 5 km/h slower than the subject’s estimated v4mmol/L. Each 
183 
stage increased by 1 km/h every four minutes so the final stage was at estimated v4mmol/L 
184 
BLa.  Heart rate (Polar s610 HR Monitor, Kempele, Finland) and VO2 values used for 
185 
analysis were the mean values from the last minute of each sub-maximal stage. RE, the 
186 
oxygen cost of running a kilometer at a specific velocity was calculated using the following 
187 
formula: O
V
&
2 (mL/kg/min) / [speed (km/h) / 60]. After every stage the subject stepped off the 
188 
treadmill for 15–20 s to allow ear-lobe blood samples to be taken for determination of BLa 
189 
concentration. The velocity at 2mmol/L & 4mmol/L of blood lactate were calculated using 
190 
Lactate-E 2.0 Software (26). The subjects rested for ten minutes following the sub-maximal 
191 
treadmill protocol.   
192 
The second part of the treadmill protocol consisted of a maximal ‘ramp’ test until 
193 
exhaustion. The initial velocity of the treadmill was set at 2 km/h slower than the subjects’s 
194 
estimated v4 mmol/L BLa stage velocity, and increased by 0.5 km/h every 30s until 
195 
exhaustion. To ensure that 
O
V
&
2max was reached, each subject had to meet the following 
196 
criteria: respiratory exchange ratio (RER) > 1.00; heart rate within 5% of their age-predicted 
197 
maximum; and/or BLa of 8–10 mM.  Maximal oxygen uptake was taken as the highest 60s 
198 
VO2 value.  Velocity at VO2max was taken as the minimum velocity that elicited 
O
V
&
2max.

Following the maximal ramp test, the subject cooled-down for ten minutes at a velocity that

Body Composition Assessment   
203 
A Lunar iDXA™ (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scanner (GE Healthcare, 
204 
Chalfont St Giles, Bucks., UK) with enCORE™ 2007 v.11 software was used to perform 
205 
total body scans. Each subject was instructed to refrain from exercise for 12 h, to refrain from 
206 
eating for 3 h and to consume 500 ml of water 1 h prior to testing. Each subject emptied their 
207 
bladder immediately prior to the measurement.  Participants were positioned on the scanner 
208 
bed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and instructed to remain as still as 
209 
possible for the duration of the scan.  
210 
 
211 
Strength Programme 
212 
The lead author, an experienced UKSCA accredited S&C coach, designed and 
213 
coached the strength programme over the 40 weeks.  The subcategories for strength training 
214 
in this programme included (1) maximal-strength that targets maximal force development 
215 
through high-load, low-velocity movements (e.g. back squats); (2) explosive-strength 
216 
(strength-speed and speed-strength) that improves RFD and maximal power output through 
217 
medium to high-load, high-velocity movements (e.g. jump-squats); and (iii) reactive-strength 
218 
that targets musculotendinous stiffness and stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) function through 
219 
low-load, high-velocity exercises (e.g. pogo-jumps, drop jumps) (12). 
220 
The programme’s aim can simplistically be described as to “increase the athlete’s 
221 
motor potential, and gradually improve their capacity to use [this] motor potential during the 
222 
performance of specific competition exercises” (41).  Reactive-strength is the most important 
223 
strength quality for short-, middle- and long-distance running events (42).  The kinematic and 
224

kinetic characteristics of ‘fast’ SSC reactive-strength exercises (i.e. knee & hip joint 
225 
displacement, elastic musculotendinous force production) are similar to that of running.  
226 
However, during the first twenty weeks (pre-season, December - March), the primary focus 
227 
of the programme was maximal-strength development, with a secondary focus on 
228 
developmental reactive-strength training (see Table 1).  There were two strength sessions per 
229 
week with at least 48 hours of recovery between sessions during the pre-season period.  The 
230 
rationale for a ‘general’ maximal-strength emphasis is that (i) there is a positive correlation 
231 
between relative maximum-strength and reactive-strength levels in athletes (r = 0.63) (11), 
232 
(ii) a maximum-strength programme can concurrently improve maximal-strength, explosive- 
233 
and sSSC reactive-strength qualities in relatively ‘weak’ athletes (7), (iii) maximum-strength 
234 
training improves stiffness (Kleg ) in relatively ‘weak’ athletes (8), and (iv) relatively ‘strong’ 
235 
athletes adapt quicker to power training when compared to the ‘weaker’ athletes (9). 
236 
During the in-season ‘racing’ period (weeks 20 to 40, April - July), after an increased 
237 
level of maximum-strength had been attained, the primary emphasis of the programme 
238 
changed to reactive- and explosive-strength development, with the secondary focus on 
239 
maintenance of maximal-strength adaptations.  The frequency of strength sessions decreased 
240 
to one per week during the in-season ‘racing’ period.  
241 
Assistance work throughout the forty weeks consisted of either single-leg squat (e.g. 
242 
split-squat, reverse-lunge & single-leg squat) or single-leg deadlift variations (e.g. single-leg 
243 
Romanian deadlift) in the 5-12 repetition range to target (i) additional strength development 
244 
through the ‘sub-maximal effort’ method (45) and (ii) gluteal strength and femoral control for 
245 
knee stability (43).  Supplementary gluteal and abdominal strength work was performed 
246 
during the warm-up and ‘core-circuit’ at the end of each session.  The strength programme 
247 
was designed and developed from the works of Haff & Nimphius (12), Rippetoe & Baker 
248 
(31), Verkhoshanky & Verkhoshanky (41) and Zatsiorsky & Kraemer (45).

Statistical Analyses 
255 
Independent variables were defined in terms of the different interventions (strength 
256 
vs. control) and the three measurement points (pre-test vs. mid-test vs. post-test).  The 
257 
dependent variables were strength (maximum-strength: 1RM back squat; slow SSC reactive-
258 
strength: CMJ; fast SSC reactive-strength: 0.3m drop-jump), physiology (2 & 4 mmol/L BLa 
259 
LT, VO2max, vVO2max & economy) and body composition (body mass, body fat, overall lean 
260 
& leg lean).  All data sets are presented as mean ± standard deviation or percentage change.  
261 
To test for differences between groups at week 0, an independent t-test was used.  For each 
262 
group, variables (physiology, strength & body composition) at week 0, week 20 and week 40 
263 
were compared using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA.  To test for differences between 
264 
groups, two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used.  Homogeneity of variance was 
265 
evaluated using Mauchly’s test of sphericity and when violated, the Greenhouse-Geisser 
266 
adjustment was used. To determine the magnitude of within group change in variables, a 
267 
Cohen’s d effect size was performed.  The criteria to interpret the magnitude of the effect size 
268 
were: 0.0-0.2 trivial, 0.2-0.6 small, 0.6-1.2 moderate, 1.2-2.0 large, and > 2.0 very large (16).

The level of significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.  IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software (IBM Corp.

RESULTS 
277 
There were no significant differences between the strength and control group at 
278 
baseline (week 0) with respect to strength, physiological and body composition variables (see 
279 
Table 2).  
280 
 
281 
Strength   
282 
No significant differences were observed for any strength measures between the 
283 
intervention and control groups at baseline.  The change in absolute maximal-strength in the 
284 
intervention group (85.7 ± 14.7 kg → 99.3 ± 19.0 kg) was not significantly different to the 
285 
change in the control group (100.0 ± 18.4 kg → 101.6 ± 17.1 kg) throughout the 40 weeks (p 
286 
= .116).  However, the change in relative maximum-strength (1RM back squat) in the 
287 
intervention group was significantly different to the change in the control group throughout 
288 
the forty weeks (p = .039).  Specifically, there was a 19.3 ± 24.1 % increase in the 
289 
intervention group maximum strength from week 0 to week 40 (d = 0.7, p = .052), largely 
290 
accounted for by week 0 to 20 increases (d = 1.2, p = .001).  The control group had a 3.1 ± 
291 
9.2 % increase in maximum-strength from week 0 to 40 (d = 0.2, p > 0.05); however these 
292 
changes were not significantly different.  There was a significant 12.7 ± 13.2 % increase in 
293 
sSSC reactive-strength from week 0 to week 40 (d = 0.6, p = .007), largely accounted for by 
294 
week 0 to week 20 increases (11.2 ± 15.2 %; d = 0.5, p = .009).  The change in sSSC 
295 
reactive-strength in the intervention group was not significantly different to the change in the 
296 
control group.  The change in ‘fast’ SSC (fSSC) reactive-strength (drop-jump RSI) in the 
297 
intervention group was significantly different to the change in the control group (p = .035).

Specifically, there was a 7.2 ± 20.1 % increase in fSSC reactive-strength in the intervention 
299 
group from week 0 to week 20 (d = 0.3, p = .596), and a 14.7  ± 27.8 % increase from week 0 
300 
to week 40 (d = 0.5, p = .155).  However, in the control group, fSSC reactive-strength 
301 
deteriorated by 1.6 ± 22.4 % from week 0 to week 20 (d = 0.9, p > 0.05), and by 9.5 ± 24.0 % 
302 
from week 0 to week 40 (d = 0.5, p = .793). 
303 
 
304 
Physiology   
305 
No significant differences were observed for any physiological measures between the 
306 
intervention and control groups at week 0.  Throughout the forty week intervention period, 
307 
the increases in v2 mmol/L BLa, v4 mmol/L BLa and VO2max for both intervention and 
308 
control groups were not significant (all p > 0.05). There was a 3.5 ± 2.9 % increase in 
309 
vVO2max in the intervention group from week 0 to week 20 (d = 0.7, p = .013), and a 4.0 ± 
310 
3.1% increase from week 0 to week 40 (d = 0.9, p = .003).  The control group demonstrated 
311 
no significant increase from week 0 to week 20 (d = 0.3, p = .579) or week 0 to week 40 (d = 
312 
0.3, p = .507). There was a 3.5 ± 3.2 % increase in RE in the intervention group from week 0 
313 
to week 40 (d = 0.6, p = .183), largely accounted for by week 0 to 20 increases (d = 1.0, p 
314 
=.01).  The control group had a 1.7 ± 2.2 % increase from week 0 to week 20 (d = 0.3, p = 
315 
.648), and a 2.3 ± 4.4 % increase from week 0 to week 40 (d = 0.5, p = .353). These changes 
316 
were not significantly different from week 0 values.   
317 
 
318 
Body Composition   
319 
No significant differences were observed for any body composition measures (body 
320 
mass, fat, overall lean & leg-lean) between intervention and control groups at week 0.  Over 
321 
the forty week intervention period there were no significant changes in body composition 
322 
variables between or within groups.

DISCUSSION 
330 
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a forty week strength training 
331 
intervention on key physiological performance indicators, strength and body composition in 
332 
competitive distance runners. The main finding of this study was that strength training can 
333 
significantly improve strength (maximal- & reactive-strength) and key physiological 
334 
performance indicators, specifically RE and vVO2max, in competitive distance runners.  
335 
Interestingly, the improvements in strength, RE and vVO2max were attained without 
336 
significant changes in body composition (body mass, fat & lean tissue mass). These results 
337 
strongly support the application of strength training within the distance running community; 
338 
demonstrating that to optimise endurance performance, strength training should be a vital 
339 
component in the physical preparation of distance runners. 
340 
 
341 
Economy & vVO2max.   
342 
RE and V O
V
&
2max are accepted as the two most important performance indicators in 
343 
elite distance running (5).  RE represents the ability of a runner to translate energy production 
344 
at a cellular level into running locomotion (36).  An economical runner will use less energy 
345 
for any given workload and spare vital reserves for maximal and supra-maximal stages of 
346 
competition (i.e. a sprint finish).  RE is dictated by a complexity of factors such as volume 
347 
and intensity of endurance training, nutrition and environment (2).  In this study, the strength 
348

training group displayed a significant 3.5 ± 3.2 % improvement in economy from week 0 to 
349 
week 40, largely accounted for by week 0 to week 20 increases (4.8 ± 3.2 %).  These 
350 
improvements in RE occurred without significant changes in v2 mmol/L BLa, v4 mmol/L BLa 
351 
and 
O
V
&
2max.  The control group showed no change in RE throughout the forty weeks (see 
352 
Figure 3).  The results support previous research that noted similar improvements (4.0–8.1%) 
353 
in RE following strength training in competitive distance runners albeit in shorter time-
354 
frames (6, 21, 24, 30, 32, 38, 40).  
355 
Velocity at VO2max (vVO2max) has strong associations with both middle- (r = 0.71) (17) 
356 
and long-distance (r = 0.89 – 0.94) (27) performance in elite running populations. These 
357 
relationships are most likely due to V O
V
&
2max being a composite variable of both economy and 
358 
maximal oxygen consumption.  Interestingly, the maximal anaerobic running test (VMART) 
359 
was found to be strongly associated with V O
V
&
2max (r = 0.85) and maximal-velocity sprinting 
360 
(r = 0.96) (29); emphasising the anaerobic system’s contribution in providing energy 
361 
production for race velocities at, and above, 
O
V
&
2max (28). In this study, the strength training 
362 
group showed a significant improvement in vVO2max (3.5 ± 2.9 %) during the first twenty 
363 
weeks of strength training (week 0→20), and a significant (4.0 ± 3.1%) improvement 
364 
throughout the forty weeks (see Figure 3).  The control group however showed no significant 
365 
changes in vVO2max throughout the forty weeks.  The change in vVO2max in the strength group 
366 
most likely resulted from an accumulation of improvements in economy (3.5 %), 
O
V
&
2max 
367 
(3.4%) and potentially other anaerobic factors that were not assessed in this study (i.e. VMART 
368 
& maximum-velocity sprinting).  The results support the work of Mikkola et al (24) and 
369 
Berryman et al (6) who found similar improvements (1.2 – 4.2 %) in vVO2max in competitive 
370 
distance runners following an eight week strength intervention.

Strength Qualities

Elite endurance running performance is not only influenced by cardiopulmonary 
374 
factors that dictate oxygen transport and utilisation, but also peripheral aspects relating to 
375 
neuromuscular force production.  Reactive-strength is the most important strength quality in 
376 
middle- and long-distance running events, as athletes need to have proficient leg 
377 
musculotendinous stiffness and SSC function to rapidly absorb and utilise the elastic energy 
378 
during each stance-phase ground contact (42). Due to this, the primary aim of the strength 
379 
programme in this study was to increase the subject’s reactive-strength ability over the forty 
380 
week intervention period.  However, during the pre-season period (week 0→20), the author 
381 
designed the programme to focus on maximal-strength development (see ‘Strength 
382 
Programme’ in Methods for rationale), with a secondary focus on reactive-strength (see Table 
383 
1).  This study showed that a maximal-strength emphasised programme in competitive 
384 
distance runners resulted in a significant increase in sSSC reactive-strength (11.2 ± 15.2 %), 
385 
an increase in fSSC reactive-strength (7.2 ± 20.1 %), as well as a significant increase in 
386 
maximal-strength (21.1 ± 16.3 %) throughout the pre-season period (see Figure 2).   
387 
During the in-season period (week 20→40), the primary emphasis of the programme 
388 
shifted towards reactive-strength development (especially fSSC), with the secondary focus on 
389 
maintenance of maximal-strength. As the intervention group increased their level of 
390 
maximal-strength at the end of the pre-season training (1.18 ± 0.18→1.42 ± 0.22 kg/kg BW), 
391 
this change in programming focus was deemed appropriate.  This focus on plyometric 
392 
development was reflected in the results as the intervention group increased their fSSC 
393 
reactive-strength by a further 6.8% throughout the racing season, while their maximal-
394 
strength levels were maintained (see Figure 2).  Interestingly, the control group’s fSSC 
395 
reactive-strength decreased by 9.4 % throughout the forty week period (1.28 ± 0.31→1.16 ± 
396 
0.12 RSI).  This highlights the importance of strength training to ‘maintain’ reactive-strength 
397 
ability and musculotendinous elastic properties throughout the season.

Mechanisms 
400 
There are various potential mechanisms on how strength training can improve both 
401 
economy and V O
V
&
2max.  Strength training increases maximal peak force and/or RFD (45), and 
402 
therefore the force required during each stride to produce a desired running velocity may 
403 
decrease to a lower percentage. Theoretically, this would lower the relative exercise intensity 
404 
and overall metabolic strain.  However, the adaptations that result in increased maximal peak 
405 
force and/or RFD are complex.  Strength training, whether maximal-, explosive- and/or 
406 
reactive-, can result in morphological (muscle fibre type, architecture & tendon properties) 
407 
and neural (motor unit recruitment & synchronisation, firing frequency, inter-muscular 
408 
coordination) changes to the musculotendinous system (10). However, the physiological 
409 
adaptations that aid economy and v O
V
&
2max (and maximal-velocity sprinting) most likely come 
410 
from a mixture of both neural and morphological adaptations.  From a neural perspective, a 
411 
more efficient recruitment pattern of leg musculature may decrease running cost.  Aligning 
412 
with Henneman et al.’s (14) size principle of motor units, strength training may increase the 
413 
neural recruitment of type I fibres, thereby decreasing their time to exhaustion and delay the 
414 
activation of the aerobically ‘inefficient’ type II fibres. This would reduce sub-maximal 
415 
oxygen consumption (economy) and increase the capacity for high-intensity (v O
V
&
2 max) and 
416 
anaerobic-dominant sections of a race (i.e. sprint finish).  However, the most important 
417 
morphological adaptation from strength training may be from improved stiffness and 
418 
elasticity of tendon structures.  Theoretically, improved utilisation of elastic energy from the 
419 
tendon would reduce the demand of ATP from the musculature, thus improving running 
420 
economy, v O
V
&
2max and maximum-velocity sprinting.

Despite increasing evidence supporting the positive effect of strength training on 
424 
endurance performance, it is still an uncommon or less emphasised physical preparation 
425 
modality in the distance running community (5).  One possible reason may be due to the 
426 
‘hypertrophic’ connotations associated with lifting weights, with distance runners 
427 
inadvertently linking strength training to increased musculature and body mass.  Increased 
428 
body mass can negatively affect relative physiological parameters (i.e. O
V
&
2max, economy) that 
429 
would inevitably affect running performance.  However, this study demonstrates that when a 
430 
strength programme is designed and implemented appropriately (see Table 1), forty weeks of 
431 
strength training can result in significant improvements in maximum- (19.3 ± 24.1 %) and 
432 
reactive-strength qualities (14.7 ± 27.8 %), RE (3.5 ± 4.4 %) and vVO2max (4.0 ± 4.0 %), 
433 
without significant changes in body composition variables (body mass, fat mass, overall lean 
434 
& leg-lean) (see Figure 4). Recently, there has been a growth in the literature investigating 
435 
the compatibility of ‘concurrent’ training methodologies and their underpinning mechanisms 
436 
for protein synthesis (e.g. Baar, 2014) (1).  Molecular physiologists have found that there is 
437 
an ‘interference’ effect, where signalling pathways activated by endurance training inhibit 
438 
skeletal muscle hypertrophy from strength training.  However, the concurrent training 
439 
literature only discusses myofibrillar hypertrophy as the sole adaptation from strength 
440 
training. They do not acknowledge other neural adaptations that contribute to increased rate 
441 
of force production (i.e. musculotendinous stiffness, motor unit recruitment, intermuscular 
442 
and intramuscular coordination) (10).  
443 
Some applied sport scientists argue that low-intensity aerobic endurance training (i.e. 
444 
zone 1-3 / < LT2 / < 80% 
O
V
&
2max) is compatible with maximal-strength and speed 
445 
development (18). Both of these modes of training are physiologically harmonious as they 
446 
mutually target central mechanisms; low-intensity aerobic training increasing blood / oxygen 
447 
transport (cardiac dimension enlargement and capillarisation), whereas maximal-strength and 
448

maximal-speed sprinting improves the rate of neuromuscular force production and absorption 
449 
qualities (39).  Research has found that successful elite endurance athletes spend 
450 
approximately 80% of their training  in these low-intensity, aerobic-dominant training zones 
451 
(zone 1 – 3, < Lactate Threshold 2 / < 80% 
O
V
&
2max) (35) - which gives opportunity to 
452 
appropriately program strength training sessions without hampering the preparation or 
453 
recovery of more specific and intense ‘threshold,’ ‘race-pace’ and / or maximum-aerobic 
454 
sessions (zone 4 & 5 /  >  Lactate Threshold 2 / > 80% O
V
&
2max).  In fact, elite sprint coaches 
455 
over the last few decades have placed a large emphasis on programming low-intensity 
456 
aerobic running, termed ‘extensive tempo’, to complement maximal-speed development by 
457 
increasing work capacity and enhancing recovery from intense sessions, thereby 
458 
demonstrating the compatibility of both low-intensity aerobic and strength / power training in 
459 
an elite setting (13).   
460 
This study demonstrated that forty weeks of strength training can significantly 
461 
improve maximal- and reactive-strength qualities, as well as physiological markers of 
462 
economy and V O
V
&
2max in competitive distance runners.  Therefore, the research hypothesis of 
463 
significant changes in maximal-strength, reactive-strength, V O
V
&
2max and economy is 
464 
accepted; the research hypothesis for a significant change in body composition is rejected. 
465 
Interestingly, the improvements in strength were attained without significant changes in body 
466 
composition (body mass, fat & lean). A large proportion of the maximal-strength 
467 
improvements were gained through the pre-season period, and then maintained throughout 
468 
the ‘racing’ season as programming shifted towards reactive-strength development.  
469 
However, within the control group, fSSC reactive-strength ability, arguably the most 
470 
important strength quality in running, deteriorated throughout the forty week period. It is 
471 
important to note that the main limitation to this study was that we did not control for each

participant’s endurance training (volume or intensity), nutrition, or randomisation of groups 
473 
(as per methods section). 
474 
 
475 
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS 
476 
A general maximal-strength orientated programme (2 x week, with low-volume 
477 
plyometrics) during the pre-season is an appropriate and efficient method for improving both 
478 
maximal- and reactive-strength capabilities in distance runners.  This study demonstrated that 
479 
this structure of strength programming can significantly improve economy and V O
V
&
2max over 
480 
a 20 week pre-season period.  It is advised that during the ‘racing’ season, strength sessions 
481 
are performed once per week to maintain strength qualities, especially reactive-strength.  In 
482 
fact, the intervention group in this study were able to improve reactive-strength by a further 
483 
6.8% with only one session per week, while maintaining maximal-strength. This study 
484 
showed that in distance runners who do not perform strength training, reactive strength can 
485 
deteriorate by 7.9 % throughout the racing season period. Distance runners who are already 
486 
‘strong’ and have high force capabilities, may need to place a greater emphasis on specific 
487 
reactive-strength training (9) and maximal-velocity sprinting (13) to gain further 
488 
improvements in economy and V O
V
&
2max.  It is important to note that for optimal adaptation 
489 
and development of endurance and strength qualities, strength sessions should be carefully 
490 
programmed around ‘intense’ aerobic (i.e. ‘race-pace’ / > Lactate Threshold 2 / > 80% 
491 
2max) and anaerobic endurance training.
