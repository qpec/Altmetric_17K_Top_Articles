Summary
Background Increased blood pressure is the biggest contributor to the global burden of disease and mortality. Data 
suggest that less than half of the population with hypertension is aware of it. May Measurement Month was initiated 
to raise awareness of the importance of blood pressure and as a pragmatic interim solution to the shortfall in 
screening programmes.
Methods This cross-sectional survey included volunteer adults (≥18 years) who ideally had not had their blood 
pressures measured in the past year. Each participant had their blood pressure measured three times and received a 
a questionnaire about demographic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The primary objective was to raise awareness 
of blood pressure, measured by number of countries involved, number of people screened, and number of people 
who have untreated or inadequately treated hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic 
blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or both, or on the basis of receiving antihypertensive medication). Multiple imputation 
was used to estimate the mean of the second and third blood pressure readings if these were not recorded. Measures 
of association were analysed using linear mixed models.
Findings Data were collected from 1 201 570 individuals in 80 countries. After imputation, of the 1 128 635 individuals 
for whom a mean of the second and third readings was available, 393 924 (34·9%) individuals had hypertension. 
153 905 (17·3%) of 888 616 individuals who were not receiving antihypertensive treatment were hypertensive, and 
105 456 (46·3%) of the 227 721 individuals receiving treatment did not have controlled blood pressure. Significant 
differences in adjusted blood pressures and hypertension prevalence were apparent between regions. Adjusted blood 
pressure was higher in association with antihypertensive medication, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, smoking, 
and alcohol consumption. Blood pressure was higher when measured on the right arm than on the left arm, and 
blood pressure was highest on Saturdays.
Interpretation Inexpensive global screening of blood pressure is achievable using volunteers and convenience 
sampling. Pending the set-up of systematic surveillance systems worldwide, MMM will be repeated annually to raise 
awareness of blood pressure.

Introduction
Raised blood pressure continues to be the biggest 
contributor to the global burden of disease1,2 and to 
global mortality, leading to 10·5 million deaths each 
year.1,2 This situation is expected to worsen in the coming 
decades as the global population increases and ages.1,3
Despite the existence of several major drug classes 
that are effective at lowering blood pressure and 
reducing the associated risk of adverse cardio 
vascular 
events,4 only a small minority of patients with hyper­
tension have their blood pressures controlled to hitherto 
generally accepted targets (<140 mm Hg systolic blood 
pressure and <90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure).5–7 
This is mainly because most people with hyper­
tension are not treated, which is largely due to the 
low levels of awareness and screening for increased 
blood pressure.5–7
The World Heart Federation8 and the Lancet Commission 
on Hypertension9 highlighted the importance of improving 
awareness of increased blood pressure as a crucial action 
that is needed to address the associated health burden.
Measurement of blood pressure is a cheap, simple, and 
non­invasive technique to detect hypertension and, 
assuming effective therapy is supplied, leads to highly 
cost­effective protection against death and disability,4,9 
which otherwise usually arises from myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure.
In high­income countries such as the UK10 and 
Canada,11 where relatively high rates of awareness of 
hypertension prevail,6 routine blood pressure surveillance

is implemented as part of routine health services12 or 
occupational services (or both), but very often through 
opportunistic screening.13
By contrast, access to free or cheap health care is not 
available via the workplace or health­care system in most 
countries. Routine blood pressure screening is therefore 
not usually available, and awareness of hypertension is 
low.5–9,12,13 Unfortunately, introduction of systematic blood 
pressure surveillance systems needs substantial funding 
and governmental support and is unlikely to happen in the 
near future. Meanwhile, with more than 10 million people 
dying from increased blood pressure each year,2 urgent 
action is required. As a pragmatic and rapid approach to 
addressing the problem of insufficient awareness of 
hypertension, we expanded World Hypertension Day to 
become May Measurement Month (MMM)14—a month of 
standardised global blood pressure measurement and 
data collection.
Methods
Study design
The MMM cross­sectional survey was set up between 
October, 2016, and April, 2017, and more than 
100 countries worldwide were approached. A detailed pro­
tocol to be used by all countries was developed by the 
International Society of Hypertension (ISH) and 
distributed to all participating countries. Communication 
and distribution of the protocol, essential training 
material, videos, and marketing information were shared 
using the bespoke MMM website. In each country, one or 
more national leaders were identified and made 
responsible for obtaining ethical clearance for the survey, 
if required, and for recruiting volunteer staff to set up 
screening sites. Sites were set up in a wide range of 
locations, including pharmacies, supermarkets, places of 
worship, shopping malls, sports grounds, schools, and 
existing clinics in primary and secondary care facilities. 
Target participants were volunteer adults (≥18 years) who 
ideally had not had their blood pressures measured in the 
previous year. The campaign was promoted internationally 
by the ISH and the World Hypertension League and 
locally by celebrity and government endorsements, on 
television and radio, and through the media and 
social media.
Volunteer staff were trained to measure blood 
pressure via video recordings housed on the MMM 
website. Recommendations for standard methods 
included three seated recordings taken on the left arm 
(preferably) or right arm (where using the left arm was 
impractical) with 1 min intervals between readings 
when the pulse rate was recorded. Omron Healthcare 
donated 20 000 blood pressure devices, of which more 
than 10 000 were distributed to sites as required. At least 
40% of blood pressures were measured by Omron 
devices. Staff were recommended to use automated 
blood pressure devices, but training on both automated 
and manual sphygmomanometers were provided 
because equipment varied at different sites.
A questionnaire was used to collect a limited amount 
of additional data from each participant (appendix), and 
these data were entered, where internet was accessible, 
onto a study­specific mobile application produced in 
six languages. Alternatively, data were entered on paper 
forms and later transferred to spreadsheets.
Blood pressure was calculated from the mean of the 
second and third readings, and hypertension was defined 
as a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or a 
diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg (or both). 
Participants receiving antihypertensive treatment were 
also assumed to have hypertension. Among those on 
treat 
ment, controlled blood pressure was defined as a 
blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Participants 
found to have blood pressures in the hypertensive range 
were provided, as a minimum, with printed evidence­
based dietary and lifestyle advice designed to lower blood 
pressure (the Top Ten Tips are listed in the appendix). 
Advice for fur­ther follow­up tailored to locally available 
facilities was also provided.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Increased blood pressure is the biggest cause of global mortality 
and disease burden despite the existence of effective treatments. 
The identification of hypertension remains a major challenge, 
with effective blood pressure surveillance systems unavailable in 
most countries of the world.
Added value of this study
May Measurement Month (MMM) 2017 is the largest ever 
synchronised, standardised multinational screening campaign 
of any cardiovascular risk factor. Data on the blood pressures of 
more than 1·2 million individuals from 80 countries are 
presented, with three measurements for two-thirds of 
participants. MMM was the largest ever blood pressure survey 
in more than 34 countries. 153 905 (17·3%) of 
888 616 participants not receiving antihypertensive treatment 
had high blood pressure. 105 456 (46·3%) of the 
227 721 participants receiving treatment did not have 
controlled blood pressure. The scale of this survey permits the 
exploration of potential associations between blood pressure 
levels and other participant characteristics and environmental 
factors, including day of the week.
Implications of all the available evidence
Volunteer screening with convenience sampling can be 
cost-effective and can be used to identify large numbers of 
individuals who could benefit from treatment or enhanced 
treatment. MMM will be repeated annually for the purposes of 
screening and boosting awareness of raised blood pressure until 
systematic blood pressure screening systems are established.

Data handling and statistical analysis
Data cleaning was done either locally or centrally 
depending on local capacity. Data cleaning rules (ap­
p 
en 
dix) and cut­off ranges were devised and provided 
to all sites.
Submitted data from 80 participating countries were 
collated centrally and analysed using Stata version 14.2. 
Countries providing ten participants or less were ex­
cluded post­hoc because of concerns with the origins 
and validity of these data. Data from 190 955 individuals 
from India could not be provided at an individual level 
for regulatory reasons and instead were analysed locally. 
These results were submitted centrally and incorporated 
where possible using weighted averages. Global data 
were subdivided by seven UN geographical regions with 
some modifications.15 Information on country income 
was sourced from the World Bank classification of 
economies (as of June, 2017).16
Ideally, three blood pressures were recorded and 
crude analyses were done using the mean of the second 
and third blood pressure readings, where available. 
Using only those individuals with all three readings, 
we compared mean blood pressures and the propor­
tion of participants with hypertension using different 
combinations of the three readings.
To provide a comparable blood pressure reading for all 
individuals, multiple imputation was used to estimate 
the average of the second and third readings where 
either reading was not documented. Six separate models 
were run on a single reading (three each for systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures), using either the first, second, 
or third reading as predictors. Both systolic and diastolic 
components were included within the imputation 
models. Age (as a restricted cubic spline with five knots) 
and sex were included, along with an interaction term. 
Region was included as a determinant of missingness 
(appendix p 13).
Mean blood pressures were standardised for age and 
sex according to the WHO world age­standard population 
along with an assumed sex ratio of 1:1.17,18 Linear mixed 
models were run separately for systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures, allowing for random effects of country to 
account for clustering. In all models, the association of 
blood pressure was adjusted for age and sex (with an 
interaction term) and antihypertensive medication. 
A multivariable model measuring the association of 
national income strata with blood pressure included all 
potential predictors in the model.
Full details of the statistical analysis are provided in 
the appendix.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing 
of the report. The first and corresponding authors had 
full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
Results
97 countries participated in MMM, but 17 countries were 
excluded from the analysis because they had data for less 
than ten participants. A complete list of countries by 
region can be found in the appendix (p 9). Data from 
1 201 570 participants were cleaned, collated centrally, and 
analysed. Only about 8% of data were collected onto the 
bespoke mobile application. Because data collection was 
incomplete for some of the variables in the study 
questionnaire, numbers used in different analyses vary.
The numbers of participants included in the database 
were stratified across seven regions, and mean ages and 
distribution between men and women were calculated 
(table 1). The percentages of participants from high­
income, upper­middle income, lower­middle income, 
and low­income countries were 9·6%, 20·0%, 68·8%, 
and 1·6% respectively.
More women than men were screened in all regions 
except in the south Asian, northern African, and Middle 
Eastern regions. Mean ages ranged from 37·4 years in 
northern Africa and the Middle East to 55·0 years in east 
Asia. 24·2% of participants were taking antihypertensive 
medications, and this pro 
portion varied at a regional 
level, from 3·3% in northern Africa and the Middle East, 
to 56·8% in east Asia (table 1).
Of 1 201 570 screenees, 103 201 (8·6%) participants 
reported having type 2 diabetes, 37 758 (3·1%) reported 
a history of myocardial infarction, and 21 980 (1·8%) 
reported a history of stroke. 138 798 (11·6%) respon­
dents reported smoking, 90 469 (7·5%) reported al­
co 
hol consumption once or more per week, and more 
than 7000 women (1·1% of female respondents) re­
ported being pregnant. The mean body­mass index 
(BMI) of respondents was 24·6 kg/m² (SD 4·5; 
appendix p 11).
Of 818 353 respondents with three blood pressures 
readings, blood pressures decreased on average by 
2·9/1·5 mm Hg between the first and third readings 
(table 2). Likewise, the proportion of participants with

hypertension decreased on subsequent readings, with a 
3·9% difference in the prevalence of hypertension 
between the first and third readings. The mean of the 
second and third readings, which was used in subsequent 
analyses, generated the lowest prevalence.
In a simple regression model of the mean of the second 
and third readings against the first reading, the R² value 
was 0·83 for systolic blood pressure and 0·74 for diastolic 
blood pressure, implying that a large proportion of the 
variation in the mean was explained by a single blood 
pressure measurement.
Multiple imputation was used to impute the mean of 
the second and third readings based on any single reading 
reported. 20 imputation sets were created, with a total of 
293 819 readings imputed. Plots of residuals against fitted 
values from subsequent analyses showed no significant 
differences between imputation sets.
After imputation, of the 1 128 635 individuals for 
whom a mean of the second and third readings was 
available or known to be on antihypertensive treatment, 
393 924 (34·9%) participants were hypertensive (table 3). 
Excluding participants taking antihypertensive medication, 
153 905 (17·3%) of 888 616 participants with hyper­
tension were not receiving treatment. Among participants 
who 
were 
receiving 
treatment 
for 
hypertension, 
105 456 (46·3%) of 227 721 participants receiving treatment 
for hypertension had uncontrolled blood pressure.
The differential distribution in age and sex in the 
seven regions shows the need for standardisation to 
make comparisons between regions. This is exemplified 
by the difference in ranking of regions on the basis 
of proportion of populations with hypertension and 
uncontrolled, treated hypertension (table 3; table 4). 
The age­standardised and sex­standardised mean blood 
pressures were calculated by region along with the 
standardised pro 
portion of untreated participants with 
hypertension, and the proportion of participants 
receiving treatment but with uncontrolled hypertension 
(table 4). We found a strong correlation between mean 
blood pressure and proportion of respondents with 
hypertension (0·80 for systolic blood pressure; 0·86 for 
diastolic blood pressure). Mean systolic and diastolic 
pressures and the proportion of participants with 
hypertension were highest in sub­Saharan Africa. Mean 
systolic blood pressure was lowest in southeast Asia and 
Australasia, whereas mean diastolic blood pressure was 
lowest in the Americas. The crude measurements, 
along with the age­standardised and sex­standardised 
blood pressures before imputation are shown in the 
appendix (p 14).
Based on a linear mixed model, the global associ­
ation between age and sex with systolic blood pressures 
in people who were not receiving antihypertensive 
treatment showed a linear increase, with the mean blood 
pressure in women exceeding the mean blood pressure 
in men at 80 years of age. For diastolic blood pressure,

the relationship shows an inverted U shape, with highest 
levels at age 50–55 years, and with blood pressure in 
women lower than in men until aged 80 years (figure 1).
After adjustment for age and sex (allowing for an 
interaction), significantly higher systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures were apparent in people receiving 
antihypertensive treatment (figure 2). Adjusting for age, 
sex, and antihypertensive treatment, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures were significantly higher in those with a 
previous history of stroke, and systolic blood pressure 
was significantly higher in people with diabetes (figure 2). 
Smoking, alcohol intake (figure 2), and increasing BMI 
(figure 3) were also associated with significant increases 
in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The 
association with smoking was unaffected by further 
adjustment for BMI. By contrast, blood pressure readings 
in pregnant women, in people with a previous history of 
myocardial infarction, and those measured on the left 
arm were significantly lower than readings from the 
comparator groups (ie, non­pregnant, no history of 
previous myocardial infarction, and readings on the right 
arm, respectively; figure 2). Coefficients for the regression 
analyses are shown in the appendix (pp 15–17).
After adjusting for age, sex and antihypertensive 
medication, systolic and diastolic blood pressures varied 
significantly by day of the week (figure 4), with the highest 
systolic blood pressures recorded on Saturdays and the 
lowest systolic blood pressures measured on Tuesdays. 
Adjusting further for levels of alcohol consumption did 
not significantly alter the results (not shown).
Relatively modest differences in systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures were apparent across the four strata of 
national incomes. After multivariable adjustment for 
other participant characteristics (age, sex, treatment, 
BMI, ethnicity, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction 
or stroke, alcohol intake, smoking habit, measure­
ment arm, and day of the week), and using mean blood 
pressure in lower­middle­income countries as the 
referent group, only diastolic blood pressures were 
significantly different (lower) in upper­middle­income 
countries, with a trend towards higher systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures in low­income countries 
(figure 5).
Discussion
MMM 2017 is the largest synchronised, standardised 
multinational screening campaign of any cardiovascular 
risk factor ever to be done. After the survey, we contacted 
attendees at our investigator meeting (January, 2018) by 
email and asked the question, “Was MMM17 the largest 
blood pressure screening event that has ever taken place in 
your country?”. 34 (74%) of the 46 responders said it was 
the largest screen in their country. That 1·2 million adults 
could be screened in 80 countries during a 1­month period, 
with only 7 months’ preparation, shows that mass 
screening is possible and can greatly enhance blood 
pressure awareness in large numbers of people.
That more than 250 000 adults (about 20% of those 
screened) were detected with either untreated or 
inadequately treated hypertension is commensurate with 
extensive, previously collated data showing low levels of 
awareness and inadequate control of hypertension.5–7
Because MMM relied heavily on volunteer staff, 
donations of devices to measure blood pressure, and 
locally raised support and funds, the cost of the cam­
paign was modest, with ISH spending only about 
US$0·22 per patient screened. The identification of 
more than 250 000 adults with increased blood pressure 
(153 905 untreated adults plus 105 456 treated adults, but 
with uncontrolled blood pressure) for this modest level 
of central funding makes the exercise appear cost­
effective, at approximately $1 per identified case. Pending

the establishment of blood pressure surveillance systems 
around the world, this inexpensive annual screening 
campaign could help offset the enormous health burden 
attributed to increased blood pressure.
In trials, clinic­based blood pressure measurements are 
often done by recording three readings and calculating 
the mean of the second and third readings. This practice 
is supported by our findings in that worldwide, blood 
pressures decreased significantly with each subsequent 
reading, with a marked difference in the proportion of 
people with hypertension depending on which reading 
was used, and the prevalence of hypertension was 
lowest when derived from the mean of the second 
and third readings. Thus, if values from only one set of 
readings are to be used to diagnose hypertension, which is 
unfortunately very common, the mean of the second and 
third readings are perhaps most suitable, unless further 
readings can be taken.
In view of the convenience sampling, which involved the 
use of divergent screening sites and a wide range of types 
of participants, it is inappropriate to compare the variable 
prevalences of hypertension observed around the world. 
However, associations with blood pressure in such large 
cross­sectional datasets are of interest, being internally 
valid.19 Their external validity is much less affected in a 
sample of this size and diversity by not necessarily 
representing the global population. We confirmed lower 
blood pressures in pregnant women, the usual patterns of 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures with age, and alcohol 
consumption was also found to be associated with 
increased blood pressures. Our findings highlight that 
people with treated hypertension and established diabetes 
or cerebrovascular disease have less well controlled blood 
pressure, which emphasises the need for more assertive 
treatment in such high­risk patients.
That blood pressures were higher with readings from 
the right arm than from the left arm could be associated 
with right handedness being more common than left 
handedness and that, on average, right upper arms are 
larger than left upper arms. However, other hypothesised 
explanations for higher blood pressure on the right arm 
include the anatomy of the aortic arch and its branches.20 
The increased blood pressures in smokers is at odds with 
findings from several previous studies21 and might reflect 
reporting bias by participants or the inability to distinguish 
duration and degree of exposure.
The variation in systolic blood pressure by day of the 
week, with the highest systolic blood pressures on Saturday 
and lowest blood pressures on Tuesdays, presumably 
relates to increased and decreased exposure, respectively, 
to one or more environmental factors that exert a pressor 
effect. For example, in some cultures, intakes of alcohol 
are higher during the weekend than during the week, 
although adjustment for the crude strata of alcohol intakes 
we recorded did not affect this finding. However, alcohol 
consumption is also likely to be under­reported, and the 
accuracy of reported intake might differ by region and 
culture. Further interrogation of these data in regions 
where alcohol is rarely consumed might shed light on 
these findings.
The proportion of participants with hypertension 
(including those on treatment) worldwide was high 
(34·9%), but had we applied the definition espoused in 
the most recent American guidelines, in which stage­1 
hypertension was redefined as systolic blood pressure

above 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure above 
80 mm Hg, or both,22 the proportion of people with 
hypertension almost doubles to 57·4%.
Limitations of these data include that, by design, they 
were not intended to be based on representative samples 
of the countries where screening took place and hence true 
prevalences cannot be reported. Furthermore, although 
almost 40% of readings were taken using OMRON devices 
and common training materials, standardisation of blood 
pressure measurement methods around the world was 
undoubtedly suboptimal; this was exemplified by 
three readings not being taken from about a third of 
participants. However, by virtue of having more than 
800 000 participants with all three recordings, we could 
adjust submitted data based on one reading to the mean of 
the second and third readings using multiple imputation. 
The need to make this adjustment is evident in the 
decrease in mean blood pressure and hypertension 
between the three readings (table 2), with the proportion of 
people with hypertension being lower after imputation 
than when derived from any single reading.
As in any blood pressure screening taking place on a 
single occasion, a proportion of false­positive diagnoses is 
likely to have arisen. However, healthy diet and lifestyle 
advice was provided, and appropriate follow­up advice 
was given. Even if only 50% of new hypertension cases 
were correctly identified, about 75 000 adults with true 
hypertension were identified in MMM 2017, and at worst, 
harmless advice was provided to those who had blood 
pressure in the high end of the normal range rather than 
truly hypertensive pressures. Unfortunately, we could not 
assess the effect of these interventions on participants with 
increased blood pressure.
The mobile application produced for the campaign 
was suboptimally designed and caused several logistical 
problems. Most of the data were therefore entered onto 
spreadsheets, often having been collected manually 
and transferred. This resulted in under­reporting of 
several questions and also slowed down data collection. 
Furthermore, data cleaning was a much more protracted 
procedure, which delayed the generation of this report.
The analyses of mean blood pressures and prevalence of 
hypertension, and the choice of which readings are used to 
define these outcomes (table 2), highlight the importance 
of standardising such data when making comparisons 
between populations and when making the diagnosis at an 
individual level. As expected, a high mean blood pressure 
correlated with a high prevalence of hypertension across 
regions after adjusting for age and sex. Hence small 
differences in mean blood pressure, albeit highly 
significant, also reflect differences in the prevalence of 
hypertension. We found significant differences across 
regions in the proportions of individuals with hypertension 
who were not receiving treatment and in the proportion of 
patients receiving antihypertensive treatment who had 
controlled blood pressure. The differences (albeit mainly 
non­significant) in blood pressure by income level could 
explain some of the observed regional differences in blood 
pressure. Future region­specific and country­specific 
analyses will help elucidate these questions.
With valuable lessons learnt, the MMM campaign is 
being repeated in 2018 with a much improved data 
collection system, and it is anticipated that at least a similar 
sized population will be screened in May, 2018, with more 
complete data. Increased focus on the effect of other 
variables such as room temperature and altitude (at the 
site of blood pressure measurement) will be investigated 
more thoroughly in 2018.
Meanwhile, pending the establishment of systematic 
blood pressure surveillance systems around the world, we 
believe that MMM as a large blood pressure screening 
campaign based on convenience sampling is a useful and 
reasonably inexpensive tool to help raise awareness in the 
general population, and potentially among health policy 
makers, and to thereby help address the burden of disease 
caused by hypertension. We therefore propose that MMM 
should continue on an annual basis as long as large 
numbers of people with increased blood pressure can 
be identified and until suitable surveillance systems 
are in place.
