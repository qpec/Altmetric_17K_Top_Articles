Trophically transmitted parasites frequently increase their hosts’ risk-taking
behaviour, to facilitate transmission to the next host. Whether such elevated
risk-taking can spill over to uninfected group members is, however,
unknown. To investigate this, we confronted groups of 6 three-spined stick-
lebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, containing 0, 2, 4 or 6 experimentally infected
individuals with a simulated bird attack and studied their risk-taking behav-
iour. As a parasite, we used the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus, which
increases the risk-taking of infected sticklebacks, to facilitate transmission
to its final host, most often piscivorous birds. Before the attack, infected
and uninfected individuals did not differ in their risk-taking. However,
after the attack, individuals in groups with only infected members showed
lower escape responses and higher risk-taking than individuals from
groups with only uninfected members. Importantly, uninfected individuals
adjusted their risk-taking behaviour to the number of infected group mem-
bers, taking more risk with an increasing number of infected group
members. Infected individuals, however, did not adjust their risk-taking to
the number of uninfected group members. Our results show that behaviour-
al manipulation by parasites does not only affect the infected host, but also
uninfected group members, shedding new light on the social dynamics
involved in host–parasite interactions.
1. Introduction
Many parasites manipulate behaviours of their host [1–3]. Particularly, para-
sites with complex life cycles, involving more than one host species, have
evolved strategies to manipulate host behaviour to facilitate transmission to
the next host [3–6]. A prominent example is Toxoplasma gondii, a felid parasite
which encysts in the brain of its natural intermediate rodent hosts, mice and
rats, and changes their innate aversion to cats into imprudent attraction [7,8].
Another example is the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis, infected roach (Rutilus
rutilus) swim closer to shore, to facilitate transmission to its final bird hosts [9].
An important consequence of complex life cycles is that these parasites gen-
erally do not transmit directly between individuals of the same host species.
Thus, interactions between uninfected and infected conspecifics do not directly
increase the infection risk of the uninfected individuals. Nevertheless, the pres-
ence of infected individuals in social groups may still be costly for uninfected
conspecifics, when information flows between group members generate
collective responses [10,11].

 The presence of a threshold number of infected individ-
uals within a group might influence the decision-making
process of the whole group, because quorum responses are
often involved when making collective movement decisions,
both in the presence and absence of predators [12–17].
Accordingly, if an infection alters the behaviour of the infected
individual, this might influence the behaviour of uninfected
group members and the group as a whole. Increased risk-
taking behaviour of infected individuals might, therefore,
also affect behaviours of other group members.
To address this question, we used three-spined stickle-
backs (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and their infection with the
tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus, an important model in
ecological and evolutionary parasitology [18,19]. The three-
spined stickleback is a small teleost fish that occurs in coastal
marine and freshwater habitats all over the Northern Hemi-
sphere [20]. The anti-predator behaviour of sticklebacks
covaries with predation risk, so that sticklebacks display
more anti-predatory behaviour in predator-rich environ-
ments [21]. To reduce the risk of detection by a predator,
sticklebacks generally avoid open areas and stay near veg-
etation or other forms of cover [21]. Once a predator is
encountered, sticklebacks can form large shoals, up to sev-
eral hundred individuals, to minimize individual predation
risk [21,22].
The tapeworm S. solidus is a frequent parasite in stickle-
backs [20]. Schistocephalus solidus reproduces in the gut of
its final bird host. The eggs are then passed with the bird’s
faeces into water where the larvae hatch and infect the first
intermediate host, a cyclopoid copepod [19]. The infected
copepods are then ingested by the second, specific and obli-
gatory host of S. solidus, the three-spined stickleback [18,23].
In the stickleback, S. solidus penetrates the gut wall and
grows substantially in the body cavity and reaches in extreme
cases up to 50% of the fish’s body weight [24].
Schistocephalus
solidus
infections
can
cause
distinct
changes in the anti-predator behaviour of individual stickle-
backs [5,25]. First, S. solidus infection reduces the escape
response of its stickleback host to predators and increases
their risk-taking behaviour in dangerous feeding situations,
thus facilitating the parasite’s transmission to its final host,
most often piscivorous birds [26–29]. Second, S. solidus infec-
tion reduces sociality of sticklebacks [30]. One proposed
explanation for this is that infection reduces competitive fora-
ging ability, forcing infected individuals to move away from
conspecifics to reduce feeding competition [30].
However, even when satiated, S. solidus-infected stickle-
backs spend less time shoaling than uninfected sticklebacks
[30]. Separation of infected sticklebacks from the shoal
might also increase the parasite’s likelihood of transmission
to the next host [30].
The observation that S. solidus-infected sticklebacks
decrease social responsiveness to conspecifics and increase
risk-taking, in turn, may have consequences for the behaviour
of nearby uninfected sticklebacks. To investigate this, we
studied groups of six sticklebacks with either 0, 2, 4 or 6
S. solidus-infected conspecifics. We determined the risk-taking
behaviour of each shoal member before and after a simulated
bird attack. We expected that uninfected sticklebacks are sus-
ceptible to the presence of infected, behaviourally altered
conspecifics in their shoal. Conversely, S. solidus-infected stick-
lebacks were predicted to be unaffected by the behaviour of
uninfected conspecifics.
2. Material and methods
(a) Experimental animals
Laboratory-bred F1 offspring of wild-caught three-spined stickle-
backs and S. solidus parasites, collected in April 2016 at the brook
Ibbenbu
¨rener Aa (Germany, 52817033.5100 N 7836045.4600 E), were
used. F1 families were obtained by in vitro fertilization and
housed in family groups in 16 l tanks (VewaTech, Germany)
with artificial plants as shelter. Sticklebacks were maintained in
recirculating tap water at 188C with a constant 16 L : 8 D cycle
and fed daily ad libitum with frozen Chironomid larvae. Four
weeks before the start of the experiment, dry food flakes (Tetra,
Germany) were added to the diet to familiarize the sticklebacks
with the food stimulus used during the experimental trials.
For parasite reproduction, the tapeworms were bred in vitro
[31,32] in size-matched pairs to increase the probability of out-
crossing [33]. Parasite eggs were washed and stored at least
two weeks at 48C to simulate winter conditions. The eggs were
then incubated for three weeks at 208C in the dark to enable cor-
acidia (i.e. tapeworm larvae) development. The hatching of
coracidia was initiated subsequently by illumination and eggs
were kept in a 16 L : 8 D cycle for 2 more days. Hatched coracidia
(1–8) were transferred to individual copepods in wells of 24 well
plates with 2 ml tap water. Fourteen days post-exposure, the
copepods were checked with a microscope for S. solidus infection.
At three months of age, the experimental sticklebacks (n ¼ 324)
were taken from nine families and placed in 18 groups of 18 fish,
each group containing two fish from each family, in 14 l home
tanks. Two months later, after being starved for 2 days and trans-
ferred into individuals jars with 400 ml tank water, the sticklebacks
were either offered S. solidus-infected copepods (n ¼ 216) or unin-
fected copepods (n ¼ 108). After 69 days, the presence of S. solidus
plerocercoids in the sticklebacks’ body cavity was determined by
inspecting the swelling of the body of all exposed sticklebacks [34];
85 out of 216 exposed sticklebacks were determined to be success-
fully infected (which was furtherconfirmed by direct measurement
of parasite burden after the experiment, see below).
(b) Experimental set-up
To investigate the effects of shoal composition on the risk-taking
behaviour of infected and uninfected sticklebacks before and
after an artificial bird attack, four treatment groups were created:
six uninfected sticklebacks (6u), four uninfected and two infected
sticklebacks (4u/2i), two uninfected and four infected stickle-
backs (2u/4i) and six infected sticklebacks (6i). All uninfected
sticklebacks were taken from the group sham exposed to the
parasite. All treatment groups were replicated seven times
resulting in a total of 84 infected and 84 uninfected sticklebacks.
The experimental tank (40 � 40 � 60 cm) was divided into two
vertical zones (figure 1): a ‘safe’ zone at the bottom with three artifi-
cial plants providing shelter and a ‘dangerous’ upper zone without
shelter and including the surface, where the artificial bird attack
wastriggered(seebelow).Atransparentfloatingringwaspositioned
under a funnel to provide the food stimulus and an artificial bird
beakwasattachedtotheexperimentaltank.Thebirdbeakwasunob-
servable for the sticklebacks when not triggered [35]. Opaque
Plexiglas covered three walls and the bottom of the tank. On the
open side of the tank, a Logitech HD pro c 920 webcam was
placed to record the trials and a Canon EOS 5D mark II camera
took high-resolution photos every minute. The complete set-up
was shielded by black cloths, from behind which the operator
provided the food stimuli and triggered the bird attack.
(c) Test procedure and behavioural observation
Sticklebacks were not fed on the day of testing in order to
increase their motivation to feed. For each trial, the required

 number of infected and/or uninfected sticklebacks was ran-
domly taken from six home tanks, assuring that all sticklebacks
within a shoal were unfamiliar to each other. Fish were put sim-
ultaneously into the experimental tank and given a 30 min
acclimatization period, before the observation started. After
10 min of observation (i.e. before the bird attack), a food stimulus
was provided in the floating ring. When at least five sticklebacks
had approached the water surface (i.e. within two body lengths),
an artificial bird attack was triggered and a second food stimulus
was provided in the floating ring, to stimulate the sticklebacks to
re-enter the ‘dangerous’ zone. Behavioural observations contin-
ued for another 10 min (after the bird attack). Then the
sticklebacks were collected and transferred to a new home
tank. The experimental tank was cleaned and filled with new
water between trials.
The behaviour of each individual was analysed using the
photo and video recordings. The videos were analysed with
VLC player. A mask marking the border between the ‘safe’
and ‘dangerous’ zone was placed on the video screen. For each
shoal, every individual was marked on the first photo and the
video was started when the individual was in the same position
as on the photo. The infection status of each individual was
determined by examining the swelling of the body cavity [34]
on the high-resolution photographs. For each stickleback, the
time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone was recorded 10 min before
the bird attack. Once the bird attack was triggered, it was
recorded for each fish whether it escaped to the ‘safe’ zone or
remained in the ‘dangerous’ zone. After all six sticklebacks had
stopped their escape behaviour (i.e. when they stopped their
rapid downward movement and resumed swimming at slow
speed), the time each stickleback spent in the ‘dangerous zone’
was recorded for another 10 min.
(d) Statistical analysis
For statistical analyses R v. 3.3.2 [36] was used. The data were
tested in four subsets: ‘pure groups’, comprising the shoals
with all uninfected (6u) and all infected (6i) individuals; ‘unin-
fected’ sticklebacks, to test whether uninfected individuals
were affected by the abundance of infected shoal members;
‘infected’ to test whether S. solidus-infected individuals were
affected by the abundance of uninfected shoal members and
‘mixed groups’, comprising uninfected and infected sticklebacks
(4u/2i and 2u/4i) to test for an interaction between individual
and shoal infection status.
Visual inspection of the data suggested a possible need to
model a variance structure for all models. Three different
variance structures (i.e. group, individual and individual
nested within group) were compared to determine the optimal
variance structure for all models. This was done with a para-
metric bootstrap ‘PBmodcomp’ (package ‘pbkrtest’ [37]) test,
and comparison of the Akaike information criterion (AIC)
values (package ‘stats’ [36]). Both the bootstrap and the AIC
values indicated that the models containing only the intercept
for group were the best fit, so this structure was used for further
analyses in all but one model (see below for details).
The residuals of all selected models were visually inspected
for normality and homogeneity. In the case of non-normality of
the residuals, another model that met the assumptions of the
model was used for further analysis, which occurred only for
the time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone for the ‘pure groups’.
In this case, a random intercept for group number and a
random slope for treatment group were used. The fixed effect
parameters with function ‘fixef’ (package ‘nlme’ [38]) were
used to inspect all generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)
for possible over-fitting.
To analyse the effect of individual infection status and treat-
ment group on the likelihood of remaining in the ‘dangerous’
versus escaping to the ‘safe’ zone after the bird attack, we used
a GLMM with the function ‘glmer’ (package ‘lme4’ [39]) with a
binomial distribution. Treatment group was fitted as a fixed
effect in all subsets. For the ‘mixed groups’, we additionally
fitted
as
fixed
effects
individual
infection
status
and
its
interaction with treatment group.
To analyse the effect of individual infection status, treat-
ment group and bird attack on time spent in the ‘dangerous’
zone, we used linear mixed models with the function ‘lmer’
(package ‘lme4’ [39]). Treatment group, time before or after
the bird attack and their interaction were fitted as fixed effects
in all four subsets. For the ‘mixed groups’, we additionally
fitted as fixed effects individual infection status, the two-way
interactions between infection status and treatment group, the
two-way interaction between infection status and time before
or after the bird attack and the three-way interaction between
individual infection status, treatment group and time before
or after the bird attack.
All full models were refitted to maximum likelihood, after
which a parametric bootstrapping with function ‘PBmodcomp’
(package ‘pbkrtest’ [37]) was used to find the minimum ade-
quate model (MaM) by manually testing all interactions and
fixed effects. All parametric bootstraps were run with 10 000
simulations, using the function ‘makeCluster’ (package ‘parallel’,
[36]), in combination with the function ‘detectCores’ (package
‘parallel’, [36]). After finding the MaM, all models were refitted
to restricted maximum likelihood, post hoc tests were performed
with only the function ‘glht’ (package ‘multcomp’ [40]), when no
interactions were significant, and in combination with the func-
tion ‘lsm’ (package ‘lsmeans’ [41]) for pairwise comparison,
whenever an interaction was significant.

 (e) Quorum decision-making
To investigate whether potential behavioural responses of unin-
fected sticklebacks to the number of infected shoal members
followed linear or nonlinear responses, we studied quorum
decision-making. In a quorum response, the probability that
an individual shows a particular behaviour increases in a step-
like manner with the number of other individuals showing a
particular behaviour. We used the following equation [15,42,43]:
p ¼
xk
xk þ Tk ,
where p is the probability that a focal individual chooses a par-
ticular option (here, the response of uninfected individuals to
the bird attack: escape zone and time spent in ‘dangerous’
zone after bird attack), x is the number of individuals that have
already chosen this option (here, the number of infected shoal
members), T is the threshold quorum at which the response
has the steepest increase and k determines the steepness of this
increase. A quorum response occurs if k � 2 [15,42,43] with
higher values implying stronger quorum responses. The T and
k values of uninfected individuals for both the escape behaviour
and the time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone were calculated using
the function ‘nls’ (package ‘stats’ [36]) in R.
(f) Parasite burden
To confirm infections, all individuals labelled as ‘infected’ were
dissected two months after the behavioural trials. They were
weighed (to the nearest mg), killed by decapitation, dissected
and screened for parasites. Parasites were weighed (to the near-
est milligrams) and the parasite burden was calculated as per
cent parasite weight of total weight (i.e. stickleback weight
plus parasite weight). A generalized linear model with a
gamma distribution and the function ‘glm’ (package ‘stats’
[36]) were used to test for a difference in parasite burden
between treatment groups.
The average number of parasites per infected stickleback
was 1.5 + 1.06, resulting in an average parasite burden of
25 + 7% w/w. There were no differences in parasite burden
between the infected sticklebacks of the different treatment
groups (x2 ¼ 2.396, d.f. ¼ 2, p ¼ 0.3).
3. Results
(a) Effects of parasite infection on escape behaviour
To study the escape behaviour of uninfected and S. solidus-
infected sticklebacks after an artificial bird strike,
we
recorded for each individual if it escaped to the ‘safe’ zone
or remained in the ‘dangerous’ zone. In the ‘pure groups’
comprising only uninfected and only infected sticklebacks,
uninfected (u) sticklebacks were more likely to escape into
the ‘safe’ zone after the bird attack (6u: 93% ‘safe’ zone),
than infected (i) fish (6i: 55% ‘safe’ zone) (x2 ¼ 12.841,
d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.007; figure 2a,d).
Comparing across all groups, the escape behaviour of
infected sticklebacks was not influenced by the number of
uninfected shoal members (x2 ¼ 0.377, d.f. ¼ 2, p ¼ 0.82;
figure 2b–d), but uninfected sticklebacks changed their
escape behaviour according to the number of infected
shoal members (x2 ¼ 8.282, d.f. ¼ 2, p ¼ 0.037; figure 2a–
c). Post hoc tests revealed that uninfected sticklebacks in
the treatment group 2u/4i remained more often in the
‘dangerous’ zone compared with the uninfected stickle-
backs in treatment groups 6u (Z ¼ 2.544, p ¼ 0.03) and
4u/2i (Z ¼ 2.294, p ¼ 0.06; figure 2a–c). Uninfected sticklebacks
in the treatment groups 6u and 4u/2i did not differ (Z ¼ 20.011,
p ¼ 1.000; figure 2a,b).
In the ‘mixed groups’ 2u/4i and 4u/2i, a significant inter-
action between infection status and treatment group was
detected (x2 ¼ 6.6805, d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.02; figure 2b,c). In
groups with a minority of infected sticklebacks (4u/2i), unin-
fected sticklebacks more often escaped to the ‘safe’ zone
compared to infected ones (Z ¼ 2.812, p ¼ 0.02; figure 2b).
By contrast, in groups with a majority of infected sticklebacks
(2u/4i), there was no difference in escape behaviour between
infected and uninfected fish (Z ¼ 0.302, p ¼ 0.99).
(b) Effect of parasite infection on risk-taking behaviour
To investigate whether S. solidus-infected sticklebacks influ-
ence the risk-taking behaviour of sticklebacks in shoals
with different numbers of infected sticklebacks, we looked
at the time individuals spend in the ‘dangerous’ zone of
the test tank, before and after an artificial bird attack. In
the ‘pure groups’ with either ‘all uninfected’ or ‘all infected’
sticklebacks, the time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone was sig-
nificantly
influenced
by
the
interaction
between
the
simulated bird attack and treatment group (x2 ¼ 48.462,
d.f. ¼ 1, p , 0.001; figure 3a,b). Before the bird attack, unin-
fected and infected individuals from these groups did not
differ in their time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone (t ¼ 0.875,
p ¼ 0.81; figure 3a). After the bird attack, individuals from
‘all infected’ groups spent more time in the ‘dangerous’ zone
than individuals from ‘all uninfected’ groups (6u) (t ¼ 25.487,
p , 0.001; figure 3b). Moreover, individuals from ‘all infected’
groups did not change their time spent in the ‘dangerous’
before
and
after
the
bird
attack
(t ¼ 21.634,
p ¼ 0.35;
figure 3a,b), whereas individuals from ‘all uninfected’ groups
spent significantly less time in the ‘dangerous’ zone after the
bird attack (t ¼ 212.237, p , 0.001; figure 3a,b).
Comparing the time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone for
uninfected sticklebacks across all groups, revealed a signifi-
cant interaction between the bird attack and the number of
infected sticklebacks in the group (x2 ¼ 41.163, d.f. ¼ 2, p ,
0.001; figure 3a,b). Before the bird attack, the time uninfected
individuals spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone groups did not
differ across groups (all p . 0.7; figure 3a). After the bird
attack, however, the time uninfected individuals spent in
the ‘dangerous’ zone differed between groups: uninfected
sticklebacks in the treatment group 2u/4i spent more time
in the ‘dangerous’ zone than uninfected sticklebacks in
the treatment groups 6u (t ¼ 213.287, p , 0.001) and 4u/2i
(t ¼ 27.757, p , 0.001; figure 3b).
Infected individuals showed a non-significant trend for
an interaction between bird attack and the number of unin-
fected
group
members
(x2 ¼ 5.071,
d.f. ¼ 2,
p ¼ 0.09;
figure 3a, b). However, their time in the ‘dangerous’ zone
was neither significantly influenced by the bird attack (x2 ¼
0.487, d.f. ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.50; figure 3a,b), nor by the number
of uninfected group members (x2 ¼ 0.517, d.f. ¼ 2, p ¼ 0.80;
figure 3a,b).
In the ‘mixed groups’ (4u/2i and 2u/4i), the time spent in
the ‘dangerous’ zone showed a significant three-way inter-
action between treatment group, infection status and bird
attack (x2 ¼ 19.472, d.f. ¼ 1, p , 0.001; figure 3a,b). Before
the bird attack there was again no difference in the time unin-
fected and infected sticklebacks in both treatment groups
spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone (4u/2i: t ¼ 20.491, p ¼ 1 and
rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Proc. R. Soc. B 285: 20180956
4
 2u/4i: 2.093, p ¼ 0.31; figure 3a). After the bird attack, unin-
fected sticklebacks in the groups with more uninfected
individuals (4u/2i), spent significantly less time in the ‘danger-
ous’ zone than their infected group members (t ¼ 24.919,
p , 0.001; figure 3b). By contrast, in the groups with more
infected individuals (2u/4i), uninfected sticklebacks spent
similar amounts of time in the ‘dangerous’ zone after the
bird attack as their infected group members (t ¼ 20.697,
p ¼ 0.98; figure 3b).
(c) Sticklebacks adjust their behaviour to infected
conspecifics with quorum decisions
Uninfected sticklebacks thus adjusted their escape behaviour
(figure 2) and their time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone
(figure 3) to the behaviour of S. solidus-infected group mem-
bers. This ‘decision’ of uninfected sticklebacks was based on
the number of infected group members and it was tested
whether uninfected sticklebacks responded in a quorum-like
manner. The estimated k value of 3.5 for escape behaviour
and 3.1 for time spent in the ‘dangerous’ zone after the
bird attack suggest that uninfected sticklebacks indeed used
quorum responses rather than linear responses when adjusting
their behaviour to that of infected conspecifics. In sum, unin-
fected sticklebacks appear to behave like infected ones above
a certain threshold number of infected fish in the shoal.
4. Discussion
Although many parasites alter the anti-predator behaviour of
their hosts to facilitate transmission to the next host, effects of
such behavioural changes on the hosts’ social environment
have received far less attention. Here, we tested how stickle-
backs, behaviourally altered by infections with the tapeworm
S. solidus, influenced the escape and risk-taking behaviour of
uninfected group members after a simulated bird attack.
Strikingly, when the infected sticklebacks within a group
outnumbered the uninfected sticklebacks, the uninfected
sticklebacks changed their response to the bird attack and
behaved
like
S.
solidus-infected
sticklebacks.
In
these
shoals, uninfected sticklebacks did not escape to the ‘safe’
zone as frequently and remained in the ‘dangerous’ zone
longer. Uninfected sticklebacks adjusted their behaviour
in a quorum-like manner to the risk-taking behaviour of
S. solidus-infected sticklebacks. The decisions of uninfected
sticklebacks to follow their infected conspecifics, may be an
attempt to maintain shoal cohesion rather than a motiva-
tion for higher risk-taking, even though the latter was the
consequence of their behavioural response.
The adjustment of the risk-taking behaviour of uninfected
sticklebacks based on a quorum threshold is presumably
originally an anti-predatory strategy as it increases the likeli-
hood of the uninfected sticklebacks to join the largest shoal.
Ward et al. [12,13] showed that quorum responses to conspe-
cifics explained sticklebacks’ collective movement decisions
in the context of predator avoidance and food patch detec-
tion. The authors suggested that a quorum threshold of two
individuals has probably evolved because it is rare that two
individuals make the same mistake (e.g. of approaching a
‘dangerous’ predator) at the same time [12,13].
Quorum decision-making can contribute to higher group
cohesion [42], higher decision accuracy [15,42–46] and faster
decision-making [42], all of which might contribute to a
higher confusion effect in the presence of a predator [47].
Even when the shoal makes a wrong decision, staying
together might still be the more beneficial option, as the
chance of an individual fish to be captured by a predator
may increase when leaving the shoal [47,48]. In this study,
infected
behaviourally
manipulated
individuals
made
decisions, and the consequential quorum decision of unin-
fected
specimen,
to
follow
the

 decisions [49]. However, humans use social information to
adjust their quorum threshold [45] and if the wrong decisions
were displayed by a group of robot peers, test persons did not
conform to the ‘peer pressure’, suggesting that they evaluated
the quality of the source of information [50]. In this study,
uninfected sticklebacks might have been unable to sense the
infection status of their conspecifics and failed to readjust
their quorum threshold accordingly.
In the wild, the prevalence (% infected sticklebacks) of
S. solidus infections varies substantially across seasons, years
and habitats [24]. Long-term monitoring of S. solidus preva-
lence revealed habitats with consistently low prevalence of
1–3% or even less and others with consistently high (greater
than 50%) prevalence of the parasite [24,51–53]. Accordingly,
it would be interesting to compare quorum thresholds of popu-
lation of sticklebacks varying in parasite prevalence (but
similar predation pressure) to test whether parasite prevalence
covaries with quorum thresholds.
Contrary to uninfected sticklebacks, the S. solidus-infected
ones did not adjust their risk-taking behaviour to the group com-
position. We propose two possible, non-mutually exclusive,
explanations for this result. First, the trade-off between shoaling
and foraging [47] might differ between S. solidus-infected and
uninfected sticklebacks. This is likely because S. solidus-infected
sticklebacks have a higher energy requirement [18,54] and due
to the distension of their stomach, S. solidus-infected sticklebacks
alsoneedtoconsumepreymorefrequentlythanuninfectedstick-
lebacks [26]. Additionally, the energetic demands caused by the
parasites also increase the resting metabolism of the infected
sticklebacks, which makes swimming even more costly for
them [55]. Taken together, a higher metabolism and urge to
forage, might explain why the S. solidus-infected sticklebacks
did not seem to be influenced by the number of uninfected
sticklebacks within their shoal.
Second, an S. solidus infection may directly influence the
social behaviour of the infected host. Barber et al. [30] showed
that an S. solidus infection also influences the shoaling behav-
iour of infected sticklebacks, so that S. solidus-infected
sticklebacks prefer positions outside the shoal and spend less
time near a shoal than their uninfected conspecifics. The
alterations in shoaling behaviour might make the infected
sticklebacks less susceptible to theinfluencesof their uninfected
conspecifics, while at the same time making them more sus-
ceptible to predators. Similarly, Barber & Huntingford [56]
observed that infection of European minnows, Phoxinus
phoxinus, with the cestode L. intestinalis affected their shoaling
behaviour: infected minnows had larger nearest neighbour dis-
tance and more likely occupied peripheral shoal positions
compared to uninfected minnows.
We did not observe differences in risk-taking behaviour
between
S.
solidus-infected
and
uninfected
sticklebacks
before the bird attack. A possible explanation for this might
be that the sticklebacks had not yet experienced predation
(they grew up in our aquaria facility), they did not have a
reason to avoid the potentially more ‘dangerous’ open
water before the bird attack occurred. However, after the
bird attack, all sticklebacks were aware of the presence of a
predator and had to reconsider the risk-balancing trade-off
[47,57] between foraging and staying in the ‘safe’ zone. We
did not expose the sticklebacks to bird attacks repeatedly.
Future research could use repeated simulated predation
events to test if this amplifies or erodes differences in
risk-taking between infected and uninfected individuals.
In natural situations, with real bird predators, behavioural
changes of uninfected sticklebacks, as observed in the present
study, could make them more prone to predation as well. This
might not only have implications for the uninfected hosts,
which follow the infected ones and become a bird’s target, it
might also increase the attractiveness of the habitat for fish-
eating birds, in general. Higher life cycle completion rates of
the parasites are a possible outcome if the bird predation rates
on the parasite affected population increase due to elevated
prey availability. Thus, the behavioural change of uninfected
sticklebacks, as observed in the present study could benefit the
fitness of S. solidus. On the other hand, uninfected sticklebacks
would dilute the presence of S. solidus in the bird’s prey,
which might neutralize positive fitness effects for the parasite.
In the wild, survivors of predation attacks might increase their

 cautiousness thus potentially readjust their quorum escape
response according to infection intensity of the manipulative
parasite and the predation pressure by its bird hosts.
5. Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, the present study showed for the
first time that a parasite with a complex life cycle indirectly
manipulates the shoaling behaviour of uninfected individuals
of its host species. Thereby the infection rate within a shoal was
a major determinant for the occurrence of a manipulation of
the behaviour of uninfected hosts. By manipulation of the unin-
fected individuals, a population as a whole might become more
attractive to predators, thereby increasing the predation risk for
all individuals in the shoal and potentially increasing the life
cycle completion rates of the parasite. This result highlights the
importance for increasing our knowledge on how extensive
the influence of infected individuals is on the behaviours of
uninfected individuals, engaged in social networks.
