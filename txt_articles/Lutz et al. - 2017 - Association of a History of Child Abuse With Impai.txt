Objective: Child abuse has devastating and long-lasting
consequences, considerably increasing the lifetime risk of
negative mental health outcomes such as depression and
suicide. Yet the neurobiological processes underlying this
heightened vulnerability remain poorly understood. The
authors investigated the hypothesis that epigenetic, tran-
scriptomic,andcellularadaptationsmayoccurintheanterior
cingulate cortex as a function of child abuse.
Method: Postmortem brain samples from human subjects
(N=78) and from a rodent model of the impact of early-life
environment(N=24) were analyzed. The human samples were
from depressed individuals who died by suicide, with (N=27)
or without (N=25) a history of severe child abuse, as well as
frompsychiatricallyhealthycontrolsubjects(N=26).Genome-
wide DNA methylation and gene expression were investigated
using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA
sequencing, respectively. Cell type–specific validation of dif-
ferentially methylated loci was performed after fluorescence-
activated cell sorting of oligodendrocyte and neuronal nuclei.
Differential gene expression was validated using NanoString
technology.Finally,oligodendrocytesandmyelinatedaxons
were analyzed using stereology and coherent anti-Stokes
Raman scattering microscopy.
Results: A history of child abuse was associated with cell
type–specific changes in DNA methylation of oligodendro-
cyte genes and a global impairment of the myelin-related
transcriptional program. These effects were absent in the
depressed suicide completers with no history of child abuse,
and they were strongly correlated with myelin gene ex-
pression changes observed in the animal model. Further-
more, a selective and significant reduction in the thickness of
myelinsheathsaroundsmall-diameteraxonswasobservedin
individuals with history of child abuse.
Conclusions: The results suggest that child abuse, in part
through epigenetic reprogramming of oligodendrocytes,
may lastingly disrupt cortical myelination, a fundamental
feature of cerebral connectivity.

Child abuse is a major public health problem, affecting 5%2
15% of all children in the Western world (1). Considerable
clinical and epidemiological evidence shows that early-life
adversity significantly increases the lifetime risk for stress-
related psychiatric disorders, including depression and sui-
cide. In particular, it has been suggested that this relationship
may be mediated by various traits, including neuroticism (2),
high levels of impulsivity and aggressive behaviors (3), and
highanxiousness trajectories (4),which are typicallyobserved
in depressed individuals with a history of abuse. However,
the neurobiological processes underlying this heightened
vulnerability remain unclear.
Brain imaging studies have described brain network activity
and structural abnormalities associated with child abuse, which
may ultimately affect various aspects of cognitive and emotional
processing(1).Inparticular,theanteriorcingulatecortex,acritical
region for the regulation of mood states, is among the brain areas
mostfrequentlyassociatedwithimpairmentsinindividualswitha

ARTICLES
 and disruption of white matter integrity (reviewed in reference
1). While these studies bring invaluable insight into macro-
structural adaptations associated with child abuse, underly-
ing cellular and molecular alterations are largelyunknown.
Recently, epigenetic regulation of gene expression has
emerged as a mechanism of long-term genomic plasticity that
has the potential to explain how early experiences may drive
behavioral changes over the lifetime (5). In particular, ac-
cumulating data suggest that patterns of DNA methylation, a
major epigenetic mark, are progressively established during
brain development and may be disrupted by early-life ad-
versity (6). We therefore hypothesized that child abuse, by
affecting the epigenetic programming of key developmental
processes, may lead to long-term structural and functional
changes that potentiate the vulnerability to psychopathology.
In the present study, focusing on the anterior cingulate
cortex, we used a cohort of subjects with a history of severe
child abuse(assessedthroughpsychologicalautopsies[7]). We
first performed genome-wide screenings of DNA methylation
and geneexpression andfound that child abusewas associated
with a severe disruption of oligodendrocyte function. We
further demonstrated that part of the epigenetic adaptations
in abused subjects selectively occurred in oligodendrocyte-
lineage cells, but not in neurons. Notably, these effects were
absent in depressed suicide completers with no history of
child abuse, strongly suggesting that they are not accounted
for by psychopathology. Furthermore, we provide evidence
showing that offspring of dams with low maternal care, a
well-investigated rat model of early-life environmental var-
iation, present myelin gene expression changes that correlate
with the effects of child abuse in humans.
Finally, associated cellular and subcellular changes were
assessed using stereology and coherent anti-Stokes Raman
scattering (CARS) microscopy, representing the first high-
throughput analysis of individual myelinated axons in human
subjects. The results demonstrate that child abuse selectively
affects small-diameter axons and their myelin sheaths.
Altogether, our studies reveal with unprecedented resolu-
tion the impact of child abuse on the anterior cingulate cortex
epigenomic and histopathological architectures, and unveil
oligodendrocytes and myelination as potential major substrates
mediating the long-term consequences of child abuse.
METHOD
Brain Samples
Anterior cingulate cortex tissue was obtained from the
Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank from 1) subjects who died
suddenly without prolonged agonal state or medical illness, and
withnopsychiatrichistory(controlgroup);2)subjectswhodied
bysuicideinthecontextofamajordepressiveepisodeandhada
historyofseverechildabuse(childabusegroup);and3)subjects
whodiedbysuicideinthecontextof amajordepressiveepisode
andhadnohistoryofchildabuse(depressedgroup).Thegroups
were matched for age, postmortem interval, and brain pH (8)
(see the data supplement that accompanies the online edition of
this article). Psychological autopsies were performed as de-
scribed previously (9), with diagnoses assigned based on
DSM-IV criteria. Characterization of early-life history was
based on adapted Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse
interviews (10). We considered as severe adversity reports of
nonrandom major physical and/or sexual abuse, up to age 15.
Only cases with the maximum severity ratings of 1 and 2 were
included. Histories of abuse were validated with available
reports from medical charts, coroner files, or reports from
youth protection services. Cingulate cortex tissue dissections
and the rat model are described in the online data supplement.
Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)
Libraries were prepared as described previously (see reference
11, the data supplement, and Table S1 in the data supplement).
Differentialmethylation.Toidentifydifferentiallymethylated
regions, we used a windows approach defined by clusters of
CG sites. Windows were defined using Bumphunter (http://
bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bumphunter.
html) as any CG within 50 bp of another CG, with no limit on
the number of CGs in a given window but with a minimum of
two. The CGs included in differential methylation analyses
were determined as follows: only CGs with $5X coverage
were included; 2) only CGs informed in .15 subjects in each
group were included; 3) for each subject contributing to a
given window, at least two-thirds of the CGs in that window
were informed; and 4) the 0.1% of CGs showing the highest
coverage were discarded as potential polymerase chain re-
action (PCR) amplification.
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)
Nuclei preparation. Frozen samples were homogenized, lay-
ered on a cushion of 0.8-M sucrose solution, and centrifuged
at 2500 g (20 minutes at 4°C). Pellets were resuspended in
blocking buffer containing primary antibodies against Sox10
(1:100; R&D Systems, Minneapolis) and NeuN (1:500; Alexa
700-conjugated; Novus, Littleton, Colo.). For the detection
of Sox10+ nuclei, nuclei were incubated with a fluorophore-
conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500).
Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain was added to the nuclei solution.
Cell sorting. Using a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, Calif.), a gating was applied to filter singlets using physi-
cal parameters and violet fluorescence (405-nm laser, 525/50
filter). Nonoverlapping gates were adjusted to collect neuronal
nuclei based on NeuN-Alexa 700 immunoreactivity (640-nm
laser, 730/45 filter), and oligodendrocyte nuclei based on Sox10-
Alexa 488 immunoreactivity (488-nm laser, 530/30 filter).
Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing on FACS-Sorted Nuclei
DNA extractions. After overnight proteinase K digestion,
samples were mixed with 770 mL of 20% PEG 8000 2.5-M
NaCl and 200 mL of Agencourt AMPureXP Beads for every
200K nuclei. DNA extraction was subsequently conducted
using a DynaMag-5 magnetic stand.

HISTORY OF CHILD ABUSE AND IMPAIRED MYELINATION IN THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE
 Library preparation. We used our PCR-based library prep-
aration procedure (12) (see the online data supplement and
Tables S2–S4). Libraries were quantified using an Agilent
TapeStation, pooled, diluted to 8 pM, and sequenced on an
Illumina MiSeq.
Bioinformatic analyses. After trimming universal primers,
reads with a Phred quality score below 20 were discarded.
Reads were aligned to the human genome hg19. CGs with a
coverage lower than 10X were discarded.
RNA Sequencing
OnlysampleswithRNAintegrity numbersabove5wereused.
Libraries were prepared at the Genome Quebec Innovation
Center using the TrueSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample
Preparation and Ribo-Zero Gold kits (Illumina) and quan-
tified using PCR (KAPA Library Quantification). Three li-
braries were run per lane of an Illumina HiSEquation
2000 (100-bp paired-end), yielding ∼62 million reads/library
(see Table S5 in the data supplement).
Differential expression analysis. We used FASTX-Toolkit and
Trimmomatic for adapter trimming, TopHat (version 2.1.0)
for alignment, and HTSeq-count for gene-level quantifica-
tion. Differential expression was analyzed using DESeq2, and
validations were conducted using reverse transcription PCR
and NanoString.
Gene set enrichment analysis. As previously described (13),
log2 fold changes were obtained from the differential expres-
sion analysis. Genes were ranked based on fold changes. The
GSEAPreranked tool and the C2 curated gene sets were used.
CARS Microscopy
Frozen blocks of white matter adjacent to the anterior cin-
gulate cortex were fixed in 10% formalin, and 300-mm thick
sections cut on a vibratome. A custom-built video-rate laser
scanningmicroscope andtwolasersourceswere usedtoprobe
CH2 stretching bands in myelin (2,845/cm). To extract nerve
fiber morphometric information, a segmentation algorithm
(14) was applied. For each fiber, standard morphometric
measurementswerecomputedfromthesegmentationresults
using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Mass.).
Statistical Analysis
Differential methylation analysis (RRBS) was performed us-
ing a general linear model with age and gender as covariates
and applying the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For dif-
ferential expression analysis (RNA sequencing), DESeq2 was
used to perform general linear models with age, gender,
and RNA integrity number as covariates. NanoString data
were analyzed similarly with general linear models using
child abuse and psychopathology as fixed factors. For DNA
methylation in FACS-sorted nuclei, cellular densities after
immunohistochemistry, and CARS morphometry analyses,
one-way and two-way analyses of variance were used,
followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference post hoc
tests. The significance threshold was set to 0.05.
RESULTS
Epigenetic Effects of Child Abuse
Levels of DNA methylation were assessed with RRBS in the
child abuse (N=27) and control (N=26) groups, covering on
average 696,000 (SEM=40,000) CG dinucleotides per subject
(see Figure S1 in the data supplement). Widespread differ-
ences were uncovered between groups (Figure 1A) (see also
Figure S1E,F), and 115 genomic windows passed multiple-
testing corrections (Benjamini-Hochberg, q,0.1). Among
these, both hyper- and hypomethylation were detected in the
child abuse group compared with the control group (see Fig-
ure S1F), suggesting that child abuse bidirectionally regulates
epigenetic patterns in the cingulate cortex, as previously ob-
served in the hippocampus (7). Strikingly, we noted that the
three most significantly differentially methylated regions in-
tersected with genes directly related to myelin and oligoden-
drocytes: LINGO3, of the LINGO family of proteins implicated
in myelination (16); POU3F1, a transcription factor controlling
myelination (17); and ITGB1, one of the integrins that mediate
interactions between oligodendrocytes and axons (18).
Recent animal and human data suggest that DNA meth-
ylation patterns are cell type specific (6), and we therefore
hypothesized that child abuse may selectively regulate oli-
godendrocytes through epigenetic processes. We conducted
FACS sorting of nuclei from oligodendrocyte-lineage and
neuronal cells (Figure 1B) (see also Figure S2 in the data
supplement), using independent samples taken from adja-
cent tissue from the same subjects included in the RRBS study,
and processed them through a targeted bisulfite sequencing
analysis of DNA methylation in our top three RRBS differ-
entially methylated regions. To control for the possible ef-
fects of depressive psychopathology and suicide, we included
a third group of depressed individuals who died by suicide
but had no history of child abuse (depressed group, N=25).
Interestingly, for both LINGO3 and POU3F1 (Figure 1C–H)
(see also Figure S3 in the data supplement), decreased
methylationinthechildabusegroup wasconfirmedandfound
to occur specifically in oligodendrocyte, but not neuronal,
nuclei. These effects were absent in the depressed group. We
found, however, no significant DNA methylation differences
for ITGB1 in either Sox10+ or NeuN+ nuclei between groups.
Altogether, therefore, child abuse, but not suicide or de-
pressive psychopathology, accounted for oligodendrocyte-
lineage specific decreased DNA methylation in LINGO3
and POU3F1 genes, suggesting oligodendrocyte-specific
epigenetic reprogramming as a result of child abuse.
Transcriptomic Effects of Child Abuse
We used RNA sequencing to further characterize genomic
consequences of child abuse. Similar to the RRBS data,
widespread differences were observed between the control
and child abuse groups (see Figure S4E,F in the data

epigenetic adaptations associated with a history of child abuse are widespread along the genome. The top three windows showing the most significant
differential methylation were located in genes related to myelin function, with decreased DNA methylation in the child abuse group for LINGO3 and
POU3F1 and increased DNA methylation for ITGB1. Panel B illustrates the isolation of nuclei from neurons and oligodendrocytes using fluorescence-

HISTORY OF CHILD ABUSE AND IMPAIRED MYELINATION IN THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE
 supplement), with 3,734 differentially expressed genes (out
of the 20,893 genes interrogated, i.e., 17.9% of p values ,0.05
with no multiple testing correction). Compared with this
genome-wide frequency, a list of 55 genes related to myelin
and oligodendrocytes showed a strong enrichment for dys-
regulation (35/55, 63.6%) (see Figure S4F), which was con-
firmed by permutation testing (p,1026) (see Figure S5 in the
data supplement). Among these 55 genes, 32 genes were
down-regulated and three up-regulated in the child abuse
group (32/55 genes, Figure 2A–D). This enrichment for
down-regulation was further confirmed by gene set en-
richment analysis (enrichment score: 20.753; false discovery
rate q,0.01) (Figure 2D). Down-regulations affected genes
that are essential constituents of myelin (Figure 2A) and that
critically control the synthesis of myelin lipids (Figure 2B) or
the differentiation of oligodendrocytes (Figure 2C). Of note,
this pattern of global down-regulation was absent in RNA
sequencing data generated using tissue from the amygdala
(see Figure S8 in the datasupplement), suggesting that abuse-
induced dysregulation of myelination may exhibit brain re-
gion specificity.
Focusing on the top differentially methylated genes
identified by RRBS, we found that ITGB1 was strongly down-
regulated in the child abuse group (Figure 2B), while the
expression of LINGO3 (Figure 2B) and POU3F1 (Figure 2C)
was not affected. Integrins are cell-cell interaction proteins,
and numerous studies have shown that ITGB1, when ex-
pressed by oligodendrocytes, promotes myelination (18) by
forming heterodimers with ITGA6 and ITGAV (20). Of note,
the two latter genes were also down-regulated in the child
abuse group (see Figure S7 in the data supplement), sug-
gesting impaired communication between oligodendrocytes
and nearby neurons or the extracellular matrix.
RNA sequencing results were validated using NanoString,
and a strongly significant correlation was found between the
two technologies (see Figure S4G). Notably, the global down-
regulation of myelin genes was virtually absent in the de-
pressed group (Figure 2E), suggesting that child abuse, but
not depressive psychopathology, is specifically associated
with impaired transcription of essential myelin genes.
To complement our findings, we used a well-established
rodent model of maternal care (21) to measure how variation
in early-life environmental experiences affects myelin in
controlled experimental settings. We compared adult off-
spring of dams displaying high versus low levels of maternal
behavior (high or low licking and grooming; see the data
supplement) and quantified in the cingulate cortex the ex-
pression of the myelin-related genes that we observed dif-
ferentially expressed in the human subjects as a function of
child abuse. We observed a strong correlation (p,0.0001)
betweenmyelingeneexpressionchangesinratsraisedbylow
licking and grooming dams and expression changes in human
subjects who had experienced child abuse (see Figure S9 in
the data supplement). Although this model does not capture
the whole spectrum of childhood abuse in humans, these
results nevertheless strengthen the notion that myelin
transcription is sensitive to the early-life environment.
Effects of Child Abuse on Oligodendrocyte Density
Genomic myelin alterations may reflect modifications in
numbers of oligodendrocytes. Using stereology, we found that
although the density of oligodendrocyte-lineage Sox10+ cells
wassimilarbetweengroupsinthecingulatecortexgraymatter
(Figure 3B), compared with the control group it was signifi-
cantlyreducedinthecingulatecortexwhitematterofthechild
abuse group but not of the depressed group (Figure 3C).
In the adult brain, mature oligodendrocytes originate
from oligodendrocyte progenitors. To investigate whether the
effects of child abuse may stem from impaired proliferation
in the oligodendrocyte lineage, we used the PDGFRa marker.
We found that the density of PDGFRa+ cells was not differ-
ent between groups (Figure 3C), suggesting that early-life ad-
versity does not affect the proliferation of oligodendrocyte
progenitors but reduces the pool of more mature myelinating
oligodendrocytes in the cingulate cortex white matter.
Effects of Child Abuse on Myelin Ultrastructure
Molecularchangesaffectingmyelinandassociatedwithchild

FACS, targeted bisulfite sequencing was used to generate high-coverage data in the control and child abuse groups as well as in a third group of
depressed suicide completers who had no history of abuse (the depressed group, N=25). Comparison with the latter group was used to discard
epigenetic adaptations potentially associated with psychopathology. In panels C–E, a group of four CGs showed decreased DNA methylation in the
LINGO3geneinthechildabusegroupthatspecificallyoccurredintheoligodendrocytelineage(Sox10+nuclei:two-wayrepeated-measuresanalysisof

difference in ITGB1 methylation patterns between groups in either Sox10+ or NeuN+ nuclear fractions, suggesting that the differential methylation
observed for this gene at the whole tissue level (using RRBS, panel A), which is further associated with decreased ITGB1 expression (see Figure 2), may
occur in nonneuronal, nonoligodendrocyte cells. Of note, expression of ITGB1 by microglial cells has been reported (15) (two-way repeated-measures

 individuals. To explore whether these changes may affect
myelin integrity and abundance, we conducted a high-
throughput morphometric analysis of myelin using CARS
microscopy (Figure 4A–C) (25). We implemented this tech-
niqueforitsuseinhumanbraintissue(seeFigureS10A–Cand
Table S10 in the data supplement), and analyzed a total of
18,949 axonal fibers with similar cross-sectional orientations.
As expected, axonal diameter was significantly correlated
with g-ratio, the commonly used myelination index (Figure
4D) (see also Figure S12 in the data supplement).
The results showed a moderate but significant decrease in
axonal diameter in the child abuse group (Figure 4E) compared
with the two other groups. Furthermore, in agreement with the
down-regulation of myelin genes described above, we measured
a decrease in average myelin thickness that was specific to the
child abuse group (Figure 4F). Finally, we found that the g-ratio
was significantly higher in the child abuse group (Figure 4G).
Altogether, the decrease in axon diameter associated with child
abuse was accompanied by an even stronger decrease in myelin
thickness, resulting in an increased g-ratio (Figure 4H). These

E, NanoString technology was used for the validation of myelin dysregulation in the child abuse group compared with the control group, focusing on
the 32 genes that were down-regulated and the three genes that were down- and up-regulated in RNA sequencing data, and using the same RNA
samples as in RNA sequencing. A strongly significant correlation was found between RNA sequencing and NanoString fold changes (Pearson linear
regression, r2=0.87, p,0.0001), with fold changes defined here as the ratio between groups, with the control group as the denominator (see Figure S4G
in the data supplement). The expression of myelin genes was also measured in the group of depressed suicide completers who did not have a history of
child abuse (depressed group, N=14). A general linear model was used to explore potential effects of child abuse and psychopathology and revealed
significant effects of child abuse for 10 genes (asterisks): CNTNAP1 (F=6.73, df=1, 61, p=0.012), ITGB1 (F=4.69, df=1, 61, p=0.034), MOBP F=5.04, df=1,
61, p=0.028), PLP1 (F=5.09, df=1, 61, p=0.028), KLK6 (F=4.81, df=1, 61, p=0.032), MAG (F=4.46, df=1, 61, p=0.039), MOG (F=4.33, df=1, 61, p=0.042),
PLLP (F=4.30, df=1, 61, p=0.042), MBP (F=4.27, df=1, 61, p=0.043), and CD9 (F=4.05, df=1, 61, p=0.049). In contrast, we found no significant effect of
depressive psychopathology for any of the 35 genes examined, indicating that child abuse is specifically associated with impaired transcription of genes
that are essential for myelin physiology. Fold changes correspond to ratios between groups, with control subjects as the denominator.

HISTORY OF CHILD ABUSE AND IMPAIRED MYELINATION IN THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE
 results suggest that both axonal morphology and myelination
are affected by early-life adversity.
Axon caliber and myelin sheath thickness are tightly regu-
lated properties that reflect the length, conduction velocity,
and firing rate of individual fibers (26), as well as their neu-
roanatomical localization (27). To gain deeper insight into the
impact of child abuse on myelination, we categorized fibers
by axonal diameter. Notably, the two smallest-caliber categories
(0.5–1.25 mm), encompassing more than 50% of all fibers,
showed reduced myelin thickness specifically in the child abuse
group (Figure 4K). Accordingly, the g-ratio was increased in the
child abuse group for these two categories (Figure 4L), indicating
that early-life adversity preferentially affects small-diameter
axons in the cingulate cortex. Finally, we note that child
abuse was also associated with increased diameter in the largest
axons (.1.75 mm, Figure 4J), which likely correspond to long-
range subcortical connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex
(28). We speculate that the latter changes, which do not have an
impact on the g-ratio of these fibers, may nevertheless alter
functionalcouplingbetweenthecingulatecortexandsubcortical
structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens and
contribute to altered emotional processing in abused subjects.
DISCUSSION
MRI studies have suggested that early-life adversity may be
associated with structural alterations in white matter (1). A
recent report further provided evidence that interventions,
such as placement in high-quality foster care, may partly
counteractsomeoftheseeffects,suggestingthatwhitematter
deficits could be reversed to alleviate lifelong consequences
of early-life adversity (29). MRI technologies, however, offer
limited specificity and spatial resolution: changes in diffusion
tensor imaging fractional anisotropy, for example, may be
related to changes in myelination, axonal number, axonal
diameter, gliosis, or tissue edema (30). Most recent MRI
strategies are able to more specifically interrogate myelin
content (31), but they still only allow, at best, characterization
of bundles of hundreds or thousands of axons. Here, we used
state-of-the-art microscopy to precisely measure micro-
structural changes associated with early-life adversity. Our
results provide direct evidence that axonal integrity and
myelination of individual fibers may be disrupted in adults
who have a history of abuse during childhood. Importantly,
they suggest that this phenomenon predominantly affects
small-diameter axons, possibly corresponding to cortico-
cortical projections (32), while leaving other axonal pop-
ulations unaffected. We propose that these selective myelin
adaptations may provide a microstructural explanation for
white matter defects previously detected by brain imaging
studies of child abuse.
Beyond white matter myelin dysregulation, our results
indicate that early-life adversity is also associated with
profound epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations that

a Panel A is a schematic representation of the polarization-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) setup. The fundamental Nd:
YVO4 (brown) and OPO (red) signal-pulse trains are used as the Stokes vs and pump vp beams, respectively. The signal emitted from the sample
(S) is collected in the epi direction (yellow). M=mirror; DM=dichroic mirror; L=lens; PBS=polarization beam splitter; l/2=half-wave plate;
O=objective lens; S=sample; F=anti-Stokes filter; PMT=photomultiplier tube. Panels B and C are images of myelinated fibers visualized by CARS
microscopy before (panel B) and after (panel C) polarization-based segmentation. Myelin segments detected as oriented in the same plane
(colored) are extracted for subsequent morphometric analysis. The scale bar is 8 mm. Panel D illustrates linear fits of g-ratio (defined as the ratio
between the inner and outer diameters of the myelin sheath; see panel H) versus axon diameter of fibers detected by CARS of the control, child
abuse, and depressed group. In panel E, the child abuse group showed an overall decrease in mean axonal diameter (one-way analysis of variance
[ANOVA]: F=8.37, df=2, 18946, p,0.001; control group [N=5,597] versus child abuse group [N=6,090], p,0.01 by Tukey’s honest significant
difference; control group versus depressed group [N=7,262], p.0.05). In panel F, axons are less myelinated in the child abuse group (one-way
ANOVA: F=27.05, df=2, 18946, p,0.0001; control group versus child abuse group, p,0.0001 by Tukey’s honest significant difference; control
group versus depressed group, p.0.05). In panel G, the mean g-ratio of cingulate cortex fibers is increased in the child abuse group (one-way
ANOVA: F=11.68, df=2, 18946, p,0.0001; control group versus child abuse group, p,0.001 by Tukey’s honest significant difference; control
group versus depressed group, p.0.05). These effects could not be attributed to differences in age or quality of postmortem tissue, as these
parameters did not affect axon diameter, myelin thickness, or g-ratios (see Figure S13 in the online data supplement). Panel H is a schematic
representation of the effects of child abuse on myelinated axon morphometry. The g-ratio of cingulate cortex fibers is increased in the child abuse
group (panels G and H) asa consequenceof decreased axon diameter(panelE) and,to a greater extent,decreased myelin thickness(panelF).Panel I
shows the distribution of cingulate cortex fibers based on their axonal diameter. No difference between groups was found in the frequency of fibers
per category (two-way ANOVA, group effect F=1.056e-012, df=2, 155, p.0.05; class effect: F=93.23, df=4, 155, p,0.0001; interaction: F=1.156,
df=8, 155, p.0.05) or in the number of fibers imaged per category and subject (see Figure S11 in the data supplement). In panel J, larger-caliber
fibers (.1.75 mm) from the cingulate cortex show increased axon diameter in the child abuse group (two-way ANOVA, class-by-group interaction:
F=11.41, df=8, 18934, p,0.0001; for fibers .1.75 mm: control group versus child abuse group, p,0.001 by Tukey’s honest significant difference;

HISTORY OF CHILD ABUSE AND IMPAIRED MYELINATION IN THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE
 affect oligodendrocytes located in the cingulate cortex gray
matter. Using FACS, we conducted the first analysis of DNA
methylation in human oligodendrocytes and showed that
cell type–specific epigenetic reprogramming may account, at
least in part, for child abuse effects on myelin. Accordingly,
for POU3F1 and LINGO3, the results indicated that DNA
methylation levels were specifically decreased in oligoden-
drocytes, but not neurons. Oligodendrocyte-specific differ-
ential methylation of these twogenes had no detectable effect
ontheirtranscriptionalactivityatthewholetissuelevel(RNA
sequencing data). Because of the dynamic relationship be-
tween DNA methylation and gene expression during brain
development (33), it is possible that these two adaptations
represent epigenetic “traces” of child abuse that no longer
have an impact on gene expression in adulthood.
Ultimately, we found that individuals abused during
childhood showed decreased expression of a large collection
of myelin-related genes in the cingulate cortex, suggesting a
strong impairment in oligodendrocyte function. Strikingly, this
global down-regulation was completely absent in depressed
suicide completers with no history of child abuse, and it
correlatednicely with gene expression changes observed in an
animal model of unfavorable maternal care. Altogether, these
results document the crucial role of early-life experiences in
setting appropriate myelin genes’ activity in the cingulate
cortex. They also suggest a pathophysiological model whereby
global cingulate cortex myelin down-regulation following a
history of child abuse is not necessary for the emergence of
depression. Rather, it may represent a neurobiological vul-
nerability that results fromchildabuseand potentiatestherisk
of psychopathology throughout life in affected individuals,
thereby contributing to higher impulsive, aggressive, or anx-
iety traits and more frequent substance use and depressive
disorders (3). Finally, an important question raised by these
findings is whether myelin changes also occur in resilient
individuals, that is, those who remain psychiatrically healthy
despite adverse experiences in early life.
A limited number of postmortem studies on depression
have reported transcriptional dysregulation of myelin-
related genes in the temporal (34) and prefrontal cortices
(35, 36). Of note, these studies wereconducted in cohorts that
were not characterized for early-life experiences of care and
abuse. In the present work, depressive symptoms and suicide
were not associated with any changes in the expression of
myelin genes in a third brain structure, the cingulate cortex.
Therefore, our findings highlight the need for further re-
search to disentangle potential brain region–specific effects
of child abuse and depression on myelin.
Recent preclinical evidence clearly supports the essential
contribution of the quality of early-life experiences to cortical
myelination. Accordingly, postweaning social isolation in ro-
dents leads to decreased myelination in the frontal cortex (37,
38) that does not recover after social reintegration, indicating
that myelination is critically regulated in early life by the so-
cial environment. Our own results are concordant with these
findingsandsuggestthatinhumans,early-lifeexperiencesalso
have an impact on myelination, at least in the cingulate cortex.
Because myelination has been shown to adapt to neuronal
activity during motor learning (39), we speculate that this
phenomenonmay besimilarlymodulatedinthesocialbrain by
thequalityoflifeexperiences.Bythreateningthedevelopment
of healthy attachment patterns, early-life adversity may last-
ingly disrupt oligodendrocyte differentiation, cellular density,
and transcriptional programming within the cingulate cortex,
inpartthroughepigeneticprocesses.Whereinthebrain,when
during development, and how at the molecular level these
effects are necessary and sufficient to have an impact on af-
fectiveregulationcannot,bydefinition,bedeterminedthrough
human postmortem studies but hopefully will be explored in
animal models by conducting time-controlled, brain region–
specific manipulations of myelination. Ultimately, we propose
that persistent myelin alterations induced in the cingulate
cortex by child abuse may contribute to behavioral dysregu-
lation and the emergence of interpersonal difficulties (40),
thereby potentiating the risk of depression and suicide.
