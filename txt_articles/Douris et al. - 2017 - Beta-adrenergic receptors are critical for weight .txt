ABSTRACT
Objective: We have previously shown that the consumption of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) by mice leads to a distinct physiologic
state associated with weight loss, increased metabolic rate, and improved insulin sensitivity [1]. Furthermore, we identified fibroblast growth
factor 21 (FGF21) as a necessary mediator of the changes, as mice lacking FGF21 fed KD gain rather than lose weight [2]. FGF21 activates the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) [3], which is a key regulator of metabolic rate. Thus, we considered that the SNS may play a role in mediating
the metabolic adaption to ketosis.
Methods: To test this hypothesis, we measured the response of mice lacking all three b-adrenergic receptors (b-less mice) to KD feeding.
Results: In contrast to wild-type (WT) controls, b-less mice gained weight, increased adipose tissue depots mass, and did not increase energy
expenditure when consuming KD. Remarkably, despite weight-gain, b-less mice were insulin sensitive. KD-induced changes in hepatic gene
expression of b-less mice were similar to those seen in WT controls eating KD. Expression of FGF21 mRNA rose over 60-fold in both WT and b-
less mice fed KD, and corresponding circulating FGF21 levels were 12.5 ng/ml in KD-fed wild type controls and 35.5 ng/ml in KD-fed b-less mice.
Conclusions: The response of b-less mice distinguishes at least two distinct categories of physiologic effects in mice consuming KD. In the liver,
KD regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa)-dependent pathways through an action of FGF21 independent of the SNS
and beta-adrenergic receptors. In sharp contrast, induction of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and increased energy expenditure
absolutely require SNS signals involving action on one or more b-adrenergic receptors. In this way, the key metabolic actions of FGF21 in
response to KD have diverse effector mechanisms.

1. INTRODUCTION
In humans, the consumption of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate KD leads
to weight-loss and improves glucose tolerance, with no adverse effects
on lipid profile [4]. In mice, we have previously shown that KD feeding
leads to a distinct metabolic state characterized by weight loss,
increased energy expenditure, activation of BAT, increased systemic
insulin sensitivity, and a distinct pattern of hepatic gene expression [1].
Subsequently, we evaluated long-term effects of KD feeding and found
long-term resistance to weight-gain on this diet by WT mice with no
adverse effects on morbidity and mortality [5].
Unlike in humans, hepatic expression of FGF21 increases in mice
consuming KD and is a necessary mediator of the physiologic adap-
tations to the diet. FGF21 knockout (KO) mice gain, rather than lose
weight on the diet [6]. FGF21 also activates BAT in part by increasing
SNS drive [3,7]. In addition, the ob/ob mouse, a model with a

 diminished SNS outflow [8], is also partially resistant to the full effects
of KD; glucose tolerance is improved, but weight loss is not observed
[6]. As it is known that both metabolic rate and the BAT thermogenic
program are regulated by the SNS [9], we hypothesized that the SNS
may play a role in the adaptation to ketogenic diets.
To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model lacking all b-
adrenergic receptors (b-less mice) [10] and measured the response to
KD. In contrast to weight-loss observed in normal WT mice, b-less
mice consuming KD had a distinctly different phenotype gaining rather
than losing weight. This weight-gain was observed despite demon-
strating a typical pattern of ketotic gene expression in the liver.
Interestingly, unlike in the liver, the adipose tissue of b-less mice failed
to show the expected adaptation to KD. While increased uncoupling
protein 1 (UCP1) protein was observed in WT BAT, this increase was
not observed in the b-less mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
increased UCP1 expression observed in WT mice consuming KD was
mediated through increased SNS drive to BAT 24-hours after switching
to the KD diet. This SNS outflow profile was absent in the b-less mice.
Our findings confirm that SNS activity, mediated through b-adrenergic
receptors, is required for the physiologic response and adaptation to
the ketogenic diet that ultimately results in weight loss.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Mouse maintenance and diets
All experiments were carried out on 8- to 16-week old male WT (FVB/
C57BL6/DBA/2/129SvJ) and b-less mice (mice homozygous for
disruption of b1, b2, and b3 adrenoceptors). These mice have been
used in the genetic sympathectomy studies [10] and have been
maintained as distinct colonies: a WT colony and b-less colony at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the Bradford Lowell Laboratory
since 2002. Parental strains of the b-less mice have the following
genotypes e b1,2 receptor double knockout (Ardb1,2tm1Bkk FVB/
C57BL6/DBA/2/129SvJ) and b3 receptor knockout (Ardb3tm1Lowl FVB)
bred to generate the triple receptor knockout.
Mice were provided with ad libitum access to water and one of two
diets; chow diet and KD. The control chow diet had a composition of
6.5% fat, 23.5% protein, and 56% carbohydrate (2.5% sucrose),
(LabDiet 5008 e Pharmaserv, Framingham, MA). The KD had a
composition of 78.9% fat, 9.5% protein, and 0.76% carbohydrate (0%
sucrose), (Bio-Serv F3666, Frenchtown, NJ). This formulation has been
demonstrated to induce ketosis in rodents [11] and was previously
used by us for KD studies [1].
Mice were kept under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle and an ambient
temperature of 22 � 2 �C. All procedures were in accordance with
National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston MA) and The University
of Iowa (Iowa City, IA).
2.2. Dynamic physiological tests
Glucose Tolerance Test: Mice were fasted for 16 h before an intra-
peritoneal (IP) injection D-glucose (2 g/kg body WT; Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) was administered 4 h after onset of the light cycle, and glucose
was measured at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the injection.
Insulin Tolerance Test: Ad libitum-fed-mice were injected IP with in-
sulin (0.75 U/kg; Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) 8 h after onset of the light cycle
and glucose was measured at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and
140 min after the injection.
Glucose levels for both tests were measured using a OneTouch Ultra
glucometer (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA).
2.3. Indirect calorimetry
Mouse energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry using
the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus
Instruments, Columbus, OH). Mice were individually housed with ad
libitum access to food and water. Analysis was performed at 24 �C
under a 12:12-h lightedark cycle (light period 0600e1800). Mice
were acclimated in the metabolic chambers for 48 h before collecting
measurements used for data analysis.
2.4. Serum analysis
Serum FGF21 concentrations were measured using Quantikine
mouse FGF21 ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), b-hydrox-
ybutyrate (b-hydroxybutyrate colorimetric assay, Stanbio Labora-
tory), and insulin (Ultra-sensitive mouse insulin ELISA; Crystalchem,
Chicago, IL).
2.5. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from tissue flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using
Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). cDNA was
made from isolated RNA using oligo(dt) and random hexamer primers
and reverse transcriptase (QuantiTech RT Kit; Qiagen, Germantown,
MD). Quantitative PCR was performed using the 7800HT (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) thermal cycler and SYBR Green master
mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative mRNA abundance
was calculated and normalized to levels of the housekeeping gene
36B4. Primers are included in Supplementary Table 1.
2.6. Recording of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA)
SNA to BAT was measured by multi-fiber recording. Using a dis-
secting microscope, the nerve subserving the BAT was identified
and carefully dissected free and placed on a bipolar 36-gauge
platinum-iridium electrode (A-M Systems, Carlsborg WA). When
an optimum recording of SNA was obtained, the electrode was
covered with silicone gel (Kwik-Sil; World Precision Instruments Inc,
Sarasota FL).
Nerve electrodes were attached to a high impedance probe (HIP-511,
Grass Instruments Co., Quincy, MA). The nerve signal was amplified
105 times with a Grass P5 AC pre-amplifier, filtered at a low and high
frequency cutoff of 100 Hz and 1000 Hz, respectively. The amplified,
filtered nerve signal was directed to speaker system and to an oscil-
loscope (model 54501A, HewlettePackard Co., Palo Alto, CA) for
auditory and visual monitoring of the nerve activity and finally to a
resetting voltage integrator (model B600C, University of Iowa Bioen-
gineering) that sums the total voltage output in units of 1 s before
resetting to zero. The resetting voltage integrator and the amplified,
filtered neurograms were continuously routed to a MacLab analoge
digital converter (model 8S, AD Instruments Castle Hill, New South
Wales, Australia) for permanent recording and data analysis. To ensure
that background electrical noise was excluded in the assessment of
sympathetic outflow in the integrated voltage, SNA was corrected for
post-mortem background activity.
2.7. Data analysis
Data are shown as means � standard error of the means (SEM). Time
course experiments were analyzed for significant differences using a
two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Bonferonni’s
post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Single point measures for
four-way studies were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferonni’s post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Single point
measures for two-way studies were analyzed using a two-tailed un-
paired T-test.

 3. RESULTS
3.1. Long-term consumption of a ketogenic diet causes weight-
loss in wild type mice, but not in beta-less mice
We have previously shown that the consumption of a KD by WT C57BL/
6 mice leads to weight loss [1]. To investigate whether intact b-
adrenergic receptors are necessary for KD induced weight loss, we
chronically fed KD to mice lacking all three b-adrenergic receptors (b-
less mice). Consistent with our previously published studies, WT mice
consuming KD for 11 weeks lost 19% of their initial body weight (6 g).
By contrast, we found that b-less mice consuming a KD for 11 weeks
significantly gained weight instead of losing weight on the diet. By 11
weeks, a 23% weight gain of 7 g was seen (Figure 1A, B). WT and b-
less mice on a control chow diet gained a modest 1.4 g over this
interval.
The change in body weight seen in the mice was reflected in changes
in fat and lean body mass. Although initial fat and lean mass were the
same between wild type and b-less mice, after 11 weeks, WT mice fed
KD lost body fat compared to their chow-fed counterparts, while b-less
mice fed KD gained an excess of almost 10 g of body fat (Figure 1C).
Lean mass was increased in the chow-fed cohorts but not the KD-fed
cohorts (Figure 1D). The increase in adiposity is partly attributable to an
increase in the epididymal white adipose tissue fat depot weight
(Figure 1E).
3.2. Beta-less mice are unable to increase energy expenditure
when consuming the ketogenic diet
In WT mice, consumption of KD led to increased energy expenditure, as
assessed by increased VO2 consumption. In contrast, b-less mice
showed no increase in VO2 consumption (Figure 2A, B). Both WT and
b-less mice consuming a KD had a consistently low respiratory ex-
change ratio (RER) between 0.70 and 0.75, demonstrating a loss in its
diurnal rhythmicity, suggestive of utilizing fat as a fuel for both the fed
and fasted state (Figure 2C, D). These changes were independent of
caloric intake (Figure 2E).
3.3. Consumption of ketogenic diet improves glucose metabolism
in both wild-type and beta-less mice, but differentially alters lipid
profile
After 11 weeks of KD feeding, there was a significant decrease in
fasting glucose in both WT and b-less groups (Figure 3A), although the
effect was more prominent in WT mice. KD also improved insulin
sensitivity in WT and b-less groups as assessed by an insulin tolerance
test. Despite the absence of weight-loss while consuming KD, b-less
Figure 1: b-less mice are unable to lose weight on consumption of the Ketogenic Diet. b-less mice fed ketogenic diet fed gain weight compared to chow fed controls
(P < 0.01), unlike WT mice that lose weight on the diet (P < 0.0001) (A, B) (Overall: Groups P < 0.0001; Time P < 0.0001; Interaction P < 0.0001). Both fat (C) and lean (D) mass
are reduced in KD fed mice compared to chow fed counterparts as measured by MRI (P < 0.001). b-less mice fed KD have significantly increased epididymal fat depot mass (E)
compared to chow fed counterparts (P < 0.05) and KD fed WT mice (P < 0.0001). Data represented as Mean � SEM; n ¼ 8e10 mice/group. Significance in weight curve was
determined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by a post-hoc analysis using Bonferonni’s Test. Significance in body composition was determined with one-
way ANOVA with Bonferonni’s post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Significance is designated by asterisks with *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.

 Figure 2: Ketogenic diet induced weight loss is due to an increase in energy expenditure. Wild-type mice fed KD for 11 weeks have a higher metabolic rate of VO2 (A)
compared to chow fed counterparts (P < 0.0001) whereas b-less mice fed KD show no changes in VO2 from their chow fed counterparts (B) (Overall: Groups P < 0.0001; Time
P < 0.01; Interaction P < 0.0001). The cyclic nature of the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is lost in both WT and b-less KD-fed mice (C, D) due to constant utilization of lipid as a
fuel source. There is no difference in total caloric intake between the groups (E). Data represented as Mean � SEM; n ¼ 8e10 mice/group. Significance in VO2 was determined
using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by a post-hoc analysis using Bonferonni’s test for all four groups together. Significance in energy intake was determined
with one-way ANOVA with Bonferonni’s post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Significance designated by asterisks with *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.

fasting glucose was determined with one-way ANOVA with Bonferonni’s post-hoc test for individual comparisons. Significance in ITT was determined using two-way ANOVA with

 mice fed KD were insulin sensitive with a 20% decrease in basal
circulating glucose levels (Figure 3B). As previously shown [1], WT
mice fed KD were also remarkably insulin sensitive with a decrease to
22% of basal levels (Figure 3B). Insulin sensitivity was observed as a
consequence of the diet and was independent of genotype.
3.4. Ketogenic diet alters hepatic gene expression in both wild type
and beta-less mice, independent of the sympathetic nervous system
Consumption of KD leads to marked alterations in hepatic mRNA
profile. We evaluated gene expression of 15 genes involved in lipid
oxidation, lipid synthesis, ketone body metabolism, and PPARa targets.
Fatty acid oxidation: After 11 weeks of KD feeding, expression of genes
required for fatty acid oxidation/b-oxidation was elevated. The
increased gene expression was seen as function of the diet and not
genotype. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, 1B (Cpt1a, Cpt1b) were
elevated 4- and 20-fold, respectively, in both WT and b-less mice
(Figure 4A, B). Medium-chain long-chain and very long-chain acyl-
coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD, LCAD, VLCAD) and 3-hydroxyacyl-
coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Hadh) were all elevated 2e3 fold when
feeding WT or b-less mice KD (Figure 4CeE).
Fatty acid synthesis: Enzymes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway
were either suppressed or remain unchanged on KD feeding, and
genotype had no additional effect on this expression e Stearoyl-CoA
desaturase-1 (Scd1) expression was lower than to 3 to 4-fold of
chow-fed values, while there was no change in fatty acid synthase
(Figure 4A).
Ketone body formation: Genes involved in ketone body formation
were all increased on KD feeding and again, this was observed as a
function of the diet and not genotype. The gene encoding the
mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of ketogen-
esis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) is also
increased in both WT fed KD and b-less fed KD as is 3-
hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (Bdh1), which encodes a protein
that catalyzes the inter-conversion of acetoacetate and b-hydrox-
ybutyrate (Figure 4HeJ).
PPARa target genes: PPARa target genes UCP2 and CD36 were also
up-regulated by KD feeding (UCP2; 2e3 fold, CD36; 7e8 fold), while
there was no additional effect of genotype (Figure 4K, L).
3.5. Wild type mice on a ketogenic diet increase energy
expenditure independent of browning in subcutaneous inguinal
white adipose tissue
It
has
been
previously
established
that
cold
exposed b-3-
adrenoreceptor knockout mice have white adipocytes that do not ex-
press UCP1 and have reduced thermogenic markers such as PGC-1a,
CIDEA, and C/EBPb [12]. By contrast we observed browning of inguinal
white adipose tissue (IWAT) in b-less mice fed KD, suggesting that the
effect of KD on this process is independent of b-adrenergic receptors.
Figure 4: Ketogenic diet induced hepatic gene expression profile is independent of the SNS. Ketogenic diet feeding induces genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketone
body formation (A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J) in both WT and b-less mice. Expression in liver of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis/triglyceride synthesis in both WT and b-less mice are
either unchanged or suppressed upon KD feeding (F,G). Critical metabolic regulators remain elevated (K, L). CPT1a: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha (P < 0.0002); CPT1b:

(P < 0.0001); UCP2: uncoupling protein 2 (P < 0.0001); Cd36: cluster of differentiation 36 (P < 0.0001). Data represented as Mean � SEM of fold change expression compared to

 Both WT mice and b-less mice on a KD showed an increase in certain
thermogenic markers such as UCP1, Cox 7a1, C/EBPb, and CPT1b
(Figure 5A,B, E, F) in the Inguinal White Adipose Tissue (IWAT).
However, b-less mice had blunted levels of Cox8b and CIDEA
(Figure 5C, D) compared to WT mice, and KD did not induce the
expression of these genes.
3.6. Brown adipose tissue is not activated in beta-less mice fed
ketogenic diet
We have previously shown that UCP1 is up-regulated in BAT of WT
mice consuming KD [1]. As b-less mice did not exhibit increased
energy expenditure (EE), we suspected KD did not have the effect of
increasing uncoupling in the BAT of these mice. We measured UCP1
protein levels in BAT and found that KD-feeding did increase UCP1
protein concentration in WT mice, but not in b-less mice (Figure 6A, B).
Increased levels of UCP1 protein in BAT of WT mice was not a
consequence of increased gene expression (Figure 6C).
3.7. Ketogenic diet increases energy expenditure in wild-type mice
by increasing sympathetic nervous system outflow to brown adipose
tissue 24-hours after exposure to the diet
In order to determine the timing of increase in EE after KD feeding, we
put WT mice in an indirect calorimeter and switched them from chow
to KD. We observed that WT mice show an immediate increase in EE,
as early as 24 h after a switch to KD, and a sustained increase in EE
36 h after exposure to the diet (Figure 7A). The early onset of increased
EE in WT mice on KD was likely due to sympathetic nerve activation as
indicated by the increased BAT SNA 24 h after exposure to the diet
(Figure 7B). This experiment cannot be performed in b-less mice as
they have no mechanism of increasing SNS outflow to BAT.
3.8. Circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 increases 3-fold higher
in beta-less mice compared to wild-type mice consuming ketogenic
diet
We examined circulating FGF21 levels in serum and found that WT
mice fed KD had FGF21 serum levels that were 43-fold higher than WT
mice fed chow. Surprisingly, b-less mice fed KD had circulating serum
levels of FGF21 that were 294-fold higher than b-less mice fed chow
and 121-fold higher than WT mice fed chow (Figure 8A). FGF21 gene
expression in liver and BAT was induced by KD feeding in WT mice and
induced to a significantly greater extent in b-less mice (Figure 8B, C).
By contrast, while FGF21 expression was significantly induced in IWAT
of WT mice consuming KD, this induction was blunted in b-less mice
consuming KD (Figure 8D). This suggests that SNS signaling and b-
adrenergic receptors are required for the activation of BAT in the
context of increased systemic FGF21.
4. DISCUSSION
In humans, ketogenic diets have generated interest as a dietary
intervention for both weight loss [4,13,14] and the management of
type II diabetes [15]. These low-carbohydrate, high fat diets have also

 been studied in mouse models to better understand the physiologic
mechanisms that mediate weight loss and to define long term con-
sequences of the diets. KD feeding in mice induces a unique metabolic
state in mice characterized by weight loss, activation of BAT, and
improved insulin sensitivity [1,6,16]. Furthermore, mice consuming
this diet demonstrate long term resistance to weight gain with no
adverse effects on morbidity or mortality [5]. The data presented here
demonstrate for the first time that, sympathetic nerve activity acting
through b-adrenergic receptors is critical for the energy expenditure
induced weight loss in mice consuming KD, but not for other long term
adaptations to the diet.
We found that unlike WT mice consuming KD [1], b-less mice gain
rather than lose weight due to a failure to increase energy expenditure.
This is consistent with previous observations in mouse models with
diminished SNS activity, such as the ob/ob mouse, that are unable to
increase energy expenditure and also gain weight when consuming the
diet [6,17]. BAT is a specialized fat depot, the activation of which can
lead to increased energy expenditure, heat production, and a negative
energy balance in mice, limiting weight gain [18e20]. KD consumption
in WT mice leads to increased EE and activation of BAT as indicated by
a remarkable 5-fold increase in UCP1 protein level [1]. In contrast, b-
less mice showed no increase in EE and were unable to activate BAT,
suggesting that intact sympathetic tone is required for BAT activation
and subsequent weight loss on KD.
Sympathetic activation of BAT is mediated through b-adrenergic
receptors. In rodents, brown adipocytes are characterized by pre-
dominant expression of b3 adrenergic receptor, very low levels of the
b1 receptor, and likely vascular tissue expression of b 2-receptors
[21,22]. The hormone norepinephrine, released from sympathetic
nerve terminals and acting primarily through the b3 adrenergic re-
ceptor, has long been known to be a key regulator of BAT activation
[23,24]. In cold exposed b3 knockout mice, b1 receptors have been
shown to be capable of mediating an increase in BAT UCP1 [25].
Therefore in this study, we used the b1, b2, b3 triple receptor knockout
(b-less) model to determine the role of beta-receptors in mediating this
response.
Here, we conclusively demonstrate that in the context of KD feeding, a
dietary stimulant of BAT activation, an intact SNS response and its
peripheral effectors are required for activation. Furthermore, our data
show that in WT mice, KD rapidly increases SNS outflow to BAT. Since
b-less mice on the diet are unable to lose weight, we conclude that this
acute increase in SNS outflow to BAT, acting via b-adrenergic re-
ceptors, is critical for energy expenditure driven weight loss observed
in WT mice feeding KD.
Ketogenic diets are more effective in promoting weight loss than
conventional caloric restriction [26] however, their effect on hepatic
glucose and lipid metabolism remains inconclusive. Blood glucose
homeostasis is tightly regulated. In both mice and humans
consuming KD, baseline blood glucose decreases and insulin falls
dramatically as ketones become the primary fuel for both brain and
muscle [14,16]. As a result, systemic insulin requirements decrease
in patients with diabetes [15]. Similarly, mice on KD show increased
systemic insulin sensitivity as assessed by an insulin tolerance test
(ITT) [5]. Therefore, by the parameter of systemic sensitivity, KD
consuming mice and humans have increased insulin sensitivity. By
contrast, studies in rats [27] and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
studies in mice [28] have reported that KD causes hepatic insulin
resistance at the level of gluconeogenesis and suggested that the
diet renders animals overall insulin resistant. Our interpretation of the
somewhat conflicting results is that liver insulin resistance results
from a long term inactivation of pathways involved in insulin action,
Figure 6: Ketogenic diet feeding induced BAT activation is dependent on intact
SNS activity. Ketogenic diet feeding activates BAT at the post-translational level as
indicated by elevated UCP1 protein in WT mice. This effect is absent in b-less mice (A,
B) (P < 0.001). The diet does not increase UCP1 at the gene expression level in BAT (C)

Figure 7: Wild-type mice are able to acutely activate SNS outflow BAT within 24 h of consuming the ketogenic diet. Wild-type mice exposed to the ketogenic diet rapidly
increase energy expenditure within 24e36 h of exposure to the diet (A). Increased energy expenditure on exposure to the diet is consistent with increased sympathetic nerve
activity to BAT 24 h after exposure to the diet (B) (P < 0.001). b-less mice lack this effect due to a disrupted sympathetic nervous system. Data represented as Mean � SEM;
n ¼ 6e8 mice/group. Significance determined with two-tailed unpaired T-test. Significance designated by asterisks with ***P < 0.001.

 which is also seen in diabetic ketoacidosis, a state of complete in-
sulin insufficiency [29]. We speculate that in animals consuming KD,
glucose is rapidly utilized by peripheral tissues such as fat and
muscle in response to insulin, contributing to reduced serum glucose
in the context of low circulating insulin. These beneficial effects on
glucose homeostasis are seen in both WT and b-less mice
consuming KD, demonstrating that the SNS, and the effects it has on
body weight, are dispensable for the observed glucose lowering
effects of KD.
KD feeding activates transcription factor PPARa in the liver, resulting in
hepatic gene expression signatures that promote increased fatty acid
oxidation and reduced fatty acid synthesis [1,2,6,30]. Both WT and b-
less mice consuming KD demonstrated an increase in PPARa
mediated fatty acid oxidation enzymes CPT1a, CPT1b, acyl CoA de-
hydrogenases MCAD, VLCAD, and LCAD, and expression of enzymes
involved in lipogenesis SCD and FAS. Collectively, these data indicate
that the b-adrenergic receptors are dispensable for the adaptation of
the liver to ketosis.
The effect of KD consumption on browning of IWAT has not been
previously examined. In cold exposed b3-adrenoreceptor knockout
mice, white adipocytes do not increase expression of UCP1 and have
reduced browning markers such as PGC-1a, CIDEA, and C/EBPb
[12]. By contrast, here we observed that b-less mice on KD are able
to partially activate the thermogenic program in white adipose tissue,
increasing expression of markers such as UCP1, Cox7a, C/EBPb, and
CPT1b while expression of other browning markers such as Cox8b
and CIDEA is blunted. Together, these data show that (i) chronic
consumption of KD requires intact SNS action and b-adrenergic
receptors to induce certain browning markers but not the entire
thermogenic program and (ii) KD induced IWAT browning is not
sufficient for weight loss.
Hepatic FGF21 has been established as an essential mediator of the
physiologic adaptations to KD [2], and chronic consumption of the
diet leads to marked induction of circulating FGF21 in both normal
mice and obese mouse models [5,16]. Here we find that in b-less
mice consuming KD, this effect is exaggerated with circulating FGF21
levels three fold higher than WT mice consuming KD (12,576 pg/ml in
WT KD; 35,490 pg/ml in b-less KD). Despite having three-fold higher
circulating FGF21 levels compared to WT mice on the diet, b-less
mice on KD are unable to increase energy expenditure and activate
BAT. This suggests that circulating FGF21 may require b-adrenergic
receptors to activate BAT and induce weight loss on KD, indicative of
a possible regulatory feedback loop from b-adrenergic receptors to
FGF21 levels.
We have previously observed that central or peripheral administration
of FGF21 in b-less mice fails to induce IWAT browning [3]. By contrast,
here we observe that chronic consumption of KD in b-less mice is able
to partially activate the browning program in IWAT. We hypothesize
that b-less mice on KD are able to brown IWAT through a cell
autonomous mechanism involving a possible direct interaction be-
tween the very high circulating FGF21 levels and the KD itself. This is
consistent with our previous demonstration that FGF21 can brown
IWAT in a cell autonomous manner in WT mice [31], in addition to
acting centrally to brown IWAT through SNS activation [3,7].
The studies presented here demonstrate for the first time that intact
sympathetic nerve activity is required or critical in mice consuming KD
in order to facilitate the energy expenditure driven weight loss effects
of the diet. While intact SNS outflow to BAT is critical for weight loss,
we find that KD induced browning observed in IWAT can be partially
activated by peripheral mechanisms in the absence of b-adrenergic
receptors, but this is not sufficient for weight loss observed on the diet.
In addition, the SNS and b-adrenergic receptors are also not required
for KD induced improved systemic insulin sensitivity and activation of
fatty acid oxidation in the liver. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate
the requirement for the SNS and intact b-adrenergic receptors for the
physiologic adaptation to KD that results in weight loss, but not for
several other metabolic adaptations to the diet.

Figure 8: Ketogenic diet feeding causes a 43-fold rise in circulating FGF21 of WT
mice and 294-fold rise in circulating FGF21 of b-less mice. Ketogenic diet in-
creases circulating FGF21 of WT mice by 43-fold compared to WT chow-fed coun-
terparts (293 pg/ml vs 12.5 ng/ml). The diet causes a larger rise in serum FGF21 of b-
less mice, 294-fold compared to b-less chow fed mice (121 pg/ml vs 35.5 ng/ml) (A)
(P < 0.0001). FGF21 gene expression in the liver (P < 0.0001) and BAT (P < 0.01)
follows a pattern similar to serum levels (B, C). Ketogenic diet consumption increases
FGF21 gene expression in IWAT of WT mice but not b-less mice (D) (P < 0.0003).
