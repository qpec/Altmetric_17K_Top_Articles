ABSTRACT
Objective
To examine the association between alcohol 
consumption and risk of dementia.
DeSiGN
Prospective cohort study.
SettiNG
Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II 
study).
ParticiPaNtS
9087 participants aged 35-55 years at study inception 
(1985/88).
MaiN OutcOMe MeaSureS
Incident dementia, identified through linkage to 
hospital, mental health services, and mortality 
registers until 2017. Measures of alcohol consumption 
were the mean from three assessments between 
1985/88 and 1991/93 (midlife), categorised as 
abstinence, 1-14 units/week, and >14 units/week; 
17 year trajectories of alcohol consumption based on 
five assessments of alcohol consumption between 
1985/88 and 2002/04; CAGE questionnaire for 
alcohol dependence assessed in 1991/93; and 
hospital admission for alcohol related chronic 
diseases between 1991 and 2017.
reSultS
397 cases of dementia were recorded over a mean 
follow-up of 23 years. Abstinence in midlife was 
associated with a higher risk of dementia (hazard 
ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.89) 
compared with consumption of 1-14 units/week. 
Among those drinking >14 units/week, a 7 unit 
increase in alcohol consumption was associated 
with a 17% (95% confidence interval 4% to 32%) 
increase in risk of dementia. CAGE score >2 (hazard 
ratio 2.19, 1.29 to 3.71) and alcohol related 
hospital admission (4.28, 2.72 to 6.73) were also 
associated with an increased risk of dementia. Alcohol 
consumption trajectories from midlife to early old 
age showed long term abstinence (1.74, 1.31 to 
2.30), decrease in consumption (1.55, 1.08 to 2.22), 
and long term consumption >14 units/week (1.40, 
1.02 to 1.93) to be associated with a higher risk of 
dementia compared with long term consumption of 
1-14 units/week. Analysis using multistate models 
suggested that the excess risk of dementia associated 
with abstinence in midlife was partly explained 
by cardiometabolic disease over the follow-up as 
the hazard ratio of dementia in abstainers without 
cardiometabolic disease was 1.33 (0.88 to 2.02) 
compared with 1.47 (1.15 to 1.89) in the entire 
population.
cONcluSiONS
The risk of dementia was increased in people who 
abstained from alcohol in midlife or consumed >14 
units/week. In several countries, guidelines define 
thresholds for harmful alcohol consumption much 
higher than 14 units/week. The present findings 
encourage the downward revision of such guidelines 
to promote cognitive health at older ages.
Introduction
Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading risk 
factor for several chronic diseases and mortality.1 2 
With continuously increasing life expectancy and the 
expected tripling of dementia prevalence by 2050,3 
understanding the impact of alcohol consumption 
on aging outcomes is important.4 Moderate alcohol 
consumption has been suggested to lower the 
risk of dementia, and the association of alcohol 
consumption with cognitive outcomes is thought 
to be J-shaped or U-shaped.5-7 However, several 
issues remain unresolved that might explain why 
alcohol consumption is not listed in the most recent 
guideline on modifiable risk factors for the prevention 
of dementia.8 Firstly, as most studies rely on face-to-
face assessment for dementia diagnosis, people who 
drop out of the study or die during follow-up are not 
included in the analyses, resulting in potential bias 
due to selection in results.9 10 This is particularly likely 
in relation to excessive alcohol consumption, which 
is known to be associated with greater mortality and 
drop-out rates.9 Secondly, most studies on aging

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Moderate alcohol consumption is thought to be associated with a lower risk of 
dementia; the association of alcohol with cognitive outcomes appears to be 
J-shaped or U-shaped, with harmful effects of both abstinence and excessive 
alcohol consumption
The evidence is far from robust, however, as excessive alcohol consumption is 
not included in current guidelines to prevent or delay dementia onset
Inconsistency in findings stems from the fact that most studies assess alcohol 
consumption in late life, which may not reflect lifetime consumption, and 
selection bias is likely to affect these findings as studies used face-to-face 
assessment of cognitive status
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
The results show a greater risk of dementia in those who abstain from alcohol or 
consume >14 units/week, with risk increasing in a linear fashion at higher levels 
of consumption
Data on hospital admission for chronic disease caused by high alcohol 
consumption showed a fourfold higher risk of dementia in these people
The study also found support for a mediating role of cardiometabolic disease; 
some of the excess risk of dementia in abstainers was explained by greater risk 
of cardiometabolic disease in this group

assess alcohol consumption in late life,5-7 which 
may not reflect lifetime consumption, and this may 
be critically important for dementia as it involves 
neuropathological changes over many years, perhaps 
decades. The tendency to reduce alcohol consumption 
at older ages may bias results11 and prevent accurate 
analyses of the quantity of alcohol consumed.5 7 
Thirdly, most studies use a single assessment of 
alcohol consumption, which is prone to measurement 
error. Furthermore, indicators of heavy drinking other 
than the reported frequency and units of alcohol 
consumed may add to understanding dementia but are 
rarely used.12 In addition, the mechanisms underlying 
the association between alcohol and cognitive aging 
remain unclear.5-7 Non-moderate alcohol consumption 
is associated with a higher risk of cardiometabolic 
disease,1 13-15 which is itself associated with a higher 
risk of dementia,4 16 suggesting a potential role of 
these diseases in the association between alcohol 
consumption and dementia.
To tackle some of these limitations, we used repeat 
data spanning nearly three decades to investigate the 
association between alcohol consumption and risk 
of dementia, assessed through linkage to electronic 
health records for all participants irrespective of their 
continued participation in follow-up. We examined 
associations of dementia with alcohol consumption 
in midlife, alcohol dependence, hospital admission 
for alcohol related disease, and trajectories of 
alcohol consumption over 17 years. In addition, we 
examined whether cardiometabolic disease modifies 
the association between alcohol consumption and 
dementia.
Methods
Study population
The Whitehall II study is an ongoing cohort study of 
men and women originally employed by the British 
civil service in London based offices.17 A total of 10 308 
adults (6895 men and 3413 women, aged 35-55) were 
recruited during 1985-88. Since baseline, follow-up 
clinical examinations have taken place about every 
four or five years, with each wave taking two years 
to complete; the last one was for 2015/16. Written 
informed consent from participants and research 
ethical approvals were renewed at each contact.

1991/93. We converted measures on frequency and 
number of alcoholic drinks (“measures” of spirits, 
“glasses” of wine, and “pints” of beer) consumed to 
units of alcohol consumed per week.
We classified participants who reported no alcohol 
consumption over the five previous years in 1985/88 
and no alcohol consumption in the previous year in 
1989/90 and 1991/93 as 10 year abstainers (n=269, 
3.0%). Participants who reported alcohol cessation 
in the previous five years in 1985/88 and those 
consuming alcohol in 1985/88 or 1989/90 but not in 
1991/93 were categorised as former drinkers (n=172, 
1.9%). Participants who reported consuming alcoholic 
beverages in the previous year but not in the last week 
at all three waves were classified as occasional drinkers 
(n=862, 9.5%). As these three categories had similar 
hazards of dementia (see appendix table S2), we 
combined them into a single category of “abstinence.” 
Among drinkers, we categorised average alcohol 
consumption (1985/88 to 1991/93) as 1-14 units/
week and >14 units/week to reflect alcohol guidelines 
in the United Kingdom.18
Alcohol consumption trajectory from midlife to 
early old age—We constructed trajectories of alcohol 
consumption between 1985/88 and 2002/04 (mean 
age 44.8 and 61.2, respectively; fig 1 and appendix 
table S1) using our defined categories of alcohol 
consumption data from 1985/88, 1989/90, 1991/93, 
1997/99, and 2002/04 based on 8927 participants 
who were alive and free of dementia in 2002/04 
and who had at least two assessments of alcohol 
consumption. Trajectories were determined using 
group based trajectory modelling, fitted using the traj 
command in Stata.19 We chose the trajectories based 
on model fit statistics (bayesian information criterion 
values and average posterior probabilities) and 
judgment about whether they adequately addressed 
the research question (appendix table S3).20 The 
identified trajectories (appendix figure S1) were long 
term abstinence, decreased alcohol consumption, 
long term consumption of 1-14 units/week, increased 
consumption, and long term consumption of >14 
units/week.
Alcohol dependence
Alcohol dependence was measured by the CAGE 
questionnaire in 1991/93. This brief four item scale 
(felt need to Cut down on drinking, Annoyed by people 
criticising your drinking, Guilty about drinking, Need 
a drink first thing (Eye-opener)).21 It is a validated 
screening instrument for alcohol dependence that was 
originally developed for general practice settings and 
correlates well with a clinical diagnosis of alcoholism. 
A cut-off threshold of two or more positive responses 
has been found to identify problems with alcohol.22
Hospital admission for alcohol related chronic 
disease
Using the national hospital episode statistics database 
we identified hospital admissions attributable to 
alcohol related chronic disease according to the ICD 
codes (international classification of diseases, ninth 
and 10th revisions) defined by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention23 (appendix table S4).
Dementia
We used comprehensive tracing of electronic health 
records for dementia ascertainment based on three 
databases: the national hospital episode statistics, 
the Mental Health Services Data Set, and the mortality 
register. Record linkage was until 31 March 2017, using 
ICD-10 codes F00-F03, F05.1, G30, and G31. The UK 
National Health Service (England, Scotland, and Wales) 
provides most of the healthcare, including outpatient 
and inpatient care; private medical insurance, held 
by around 12% of the UK population (1997 figures),24 
is mainly used for elective surgery rather than for 
chronic conditions such as dementia. The Mental 
Health Services Data Set is a national database that 
contains information on people in contact with mental 
health services in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and the 
community. Mortality data were drawn from the British 
national mortality register (National Health Services 
Central Registry). The tracing exercise was carried out 
using the unique NHS identification number given to 
each UK resident. The date of dementia was set at the 
first record of dementia diagnosis in any of the three 
databases used for ascertainment.
To assess the validity of the method of dementia 
ascertainment, we used a mixed model with a 
backward time scale and determined trajectories of 
global cognitive score based on performance in three 
cognitive domains (memory, reasoning, fluency), 
assessed five times between the 1997/99 and 2015/16 
waves.25 These results show an accelerated decline in 
global cognition in the 10 years before the dementia 
diagnosis (appendix figure S2), as has been shown in 
studies that use a “gold standard” method for dementia 
ascertainment.26
Covariates
Sociodemographic 
variables 
included 
age, 
sex, 
ethnicity (white, non-white), marital status (married/
cohabiting, other), and socioeconomic status using 
occupational 
position 
(three 
categories: 
high, 
intermediate, and low, representing income and status 
at work) and education (five categories: less than 
primary school (age <11), lower secondary school 
(age <16), higher secondary school (age <18), and 
university degree and higher).
Health behaviours were assessed over the follow-up 
period by questionnaire and included smoking (current, 
former, never), hours of moderate to vigorous physical 
activity (using questions on moderately energetic (eg, 
dancing, cycling, leisurely swimming) and vigorous 
(eg, running, hard swimming, playing squash) 
physical activity at baseline and then using a modified 
version of the Minnesota leisure time physical activity 
questionnaire),25 and dietary behaviour (frequency of 
fruit and vegetables consumed in a week).
Health related covariates included systolic blood 
pressure, total cholesterol level, prevalent diabetes

mellitus (determined by fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 
mmol/L, reported doctor diagnosed diabetes, use of 
antidiabetic drugs, or hospital records), body mass 
index (categorised as <20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9, and ≥30 
kg/m2) assessed by a trained nurse at the clinical 
examination through blood tests and standard clinical 
protocols, cardiovascular diseases (including coronary 
heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart 
failure) identified using linkage to national hospital 
records, self reported use of drugs for cardiovascular 
disease, and the 30 item general health questionnaire 
on anxiety and depression symptoms.27
Statistical analysis
Three sets of analyses were undertaken (fig 1 and 
appendix table S1). Cox regression was used in all 
analyses, with age as the timescale to model the 
associations with hazard of incident dementia. 
Participants were censored at date of record of 
dementia, death, or 31 March 2017, whichever came 
first. Models were first adjusted for sociodemographic 
factors, then additionally for health behaviours, and 
finally for health status.
Analysis of midlife alcohol consumption
We examined the association of alcohol consumption 
in midlife (mean of 1985/88, 1989/90, and 1991/93), 
alcohol dependence in 1991/93, and hospital 
admission for alcohol related chronic diseases from 
1991, with follow-up for dementia starting in 1991. 
Covariates were assessed in 1991/93 (or the closest 
wave if missing), apart for the analysis on hospital 
admission for alcohol related chronic diseases, for 
which all covariates were time varying. We first 
examined the shape of the association of midlife 
alcohol consumption and dementia using restricted 
cubic spline regressions with Harrell knots,28 and Stata 
command xblc29 with 14 units/week consumption 
as the reference. In subsequent Cox regression we 
assessed the association of alcohol consumption 
categories (abstinence, 1-14 units/week, and >14 
units/week) with risk of dementia. In those reporting 
consumption of >14 units/week, we used spline 
regressions to examine whether there was a linear 
trend in the association of alcohol consumption with 
dementia and then estimated the risk of dementia for 
every increment of 7 units/week.
Trajectories of alcohol consumption from midlife to 
early old age
The aim of these analyses was to examine the 
association of long term alcohol consumption with risk 
of dementia using trajectories of alcohol consumption 
between 1985/88 and 2002/04 waves; the follow-up 
started in 2002/04 and covariates were drawn from the 
2002/04 wave (or the closest wave if missing).
Role of cardiometabolic disease in association 
between alcohol consumption and dementia
In subsequent analyses we examined the mediating 
role of cardiometabolic disease (stroke, coronary 
heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and 
diabetes) over the follow-up period in the association 
between alcohol consumption and risk of dementia. 
These analyses were carried out using multistate 
models (package mstate, R software) in participants 
free of dementia and cardiometabolic disease in 
1991/93. The models allow simultaneous estimation 
of the risk associated with alcohol consumption 
in three transitions: from healthy state to incident 
cardiometabolic disease, from cardiometabolic disease 
to incident dementia, and from healthy state to incident 
dementia in those free of cardiometabolic disease. 
Age was used as the timescale, and the analyses were 
adjusted for sociodemographic factors.
Sensitivity analysis
Five sets of sensitivity analyses were undertaken. 
Firstly, we examined the association between alcohol 
consumption in midlife and risk of mortality in the 
total sample using Cox regression and then in those 
without a diagnosis of dementia during the follow-
up period using multistate models. We used the 
modified Fine and Gray competing risks method to 
address the possibility that those who died could have 
developed dementia had they lived longer.30 Secondly, 
we repeated analysis on the shape of the association 
between alcohol consumption and risk of dementia 
excluding abstainers in order to check for potential 
distortion of the association due to abstainers. Thirdly, 
to examine whether alcohol consumption at age 
50, 60, and 70 was similarly associated with risk of 
dementia, we extracted data on alcohol consumption 
at these ages for each participant across the data 
waves, allowing a five year margin either way for each 
age category, and we assessed the association with 
incident dementia using Cox models; start of follow-
up and covariates were from age 50, 60, and 70, 
respectively. Fourthly, we examined the associations 
of type of alcohol consumed using mean midlife 
consumption (1985/88, 1989/90, and 1991/93) using 
restricted cubic splines adjusted for sociodemographic 
variables and mutually adjusted for types of alcohol 
consumed. 
Finally, 
to 
examine 
whether 
poor 
sensitivity of our method of dementia ascertainment 
biased our results, we simulated scenarios with 
differential misclassification (ie, the hypothesis that 
proportion of misclassified dementia cases depends 
on midlife alcohol consumption categories) using a 
SAS macro provided by Fox et al.31 We allowed the 
sensitivity to range between 60% and 90% and the 
specificity between 97% and 100% using a trapezoidal 
probability density function. We first analysed the 
impact of potential differential misclassification on 
the hazard ratio estimate associated with abstinence 
compared with alcohol consumption of 1-14 units/
week. To account for differential misclassification, we 
used separate sensitivity (specificity) distributions in 
the two alcohol consumption groups (abstinence and 
1-14 units/week). We simulated two scenarios: first 
where the correlation of the two sensitivity (specificity) 
distributions in the alcohol consumption groups was

0.8 and then 0.6 (a correlation of 1 would correspond 
to non-differential misclassification). We repeated 
these analyses to assess the impact of differential 
misclassification on the comparison between alcohol 
consumption of >14 units/week compared with 1-14 
units/week. Cox regression analyses were undertaken 
using STATA 15, multistate models using R, and 
sensitivity analyses on dementia misclassification 
using SAS 9.4.
Patient involvement
Participants of the Whitehall II study were not involved 
in setting the research question or the outcome 
measures, nor were they involved in developing 
plans for recruitment, design, or implementation 
of the study. No participants were asked advice on 
interpretation or writing up of results. However, all 
results are disseminated to study participants through 
newsletters and our website, which has a participant 
portal, www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII/participants/.
Results
Among the 10 231 participants alive in 1991/93, 9087 
had at least two measurements of alcohol consumption 
between 1985/88 and 1991/93 and complete data on 
covariates (fig 1). Among these participants, a total 
of 397 cases of dementia were recorded over a mean 
follow-up of 23.2 (SD 4.4, range 0.08-25.6) years. 
Mean age at dementia diagnosis was 75.6 (SD 5.8; 
interquartile range 72.2-80.0; range 53.4-85.9) years, 
with the first case recorded in 1995 and 72% (287 
cases out of 397) of the cases recorded in the last five 
years of follow-up. Greater age (hazard ratio 1.21 per 
1 year older age at study baseline, 95% confidence 
interval 1.18 to 1.23), female sex (1.57, 1.29 to 1.92), 
education less than secondary school diploma (1.68, 
1.38 to 2.05), and low occupational position (2.39, 
1.94 to 2.95) were associated with a greater hazard 
of dementia. Table 1 presents the characteristics 
of the study population (n=9087). Abstainers were 
more likely to be women, non-white, and from the 
lower socioeconomic group. They also had a worse 
cardiometabolic profile (table 1). Participants in the 
1-14 units/week alcohol consumption group were 
more likely to drink wine and those in the >14 units/
week group to drink beer (table 1).
Midlife alcohol consumption
Age at dementia diagnosis was 76.1, 75.7, and 74.4 
years (P=0.13) in the abstinence, 1-14 units/week, 
and >14 units/week groups, respectively. As no 
evidence was found of an interaction between alcohol 
consumption and age (P=0.76), or sex (P=0.92), 
or occupational position (P=0.95) in associations 
with dementia, we combined these subgroups in the 
analyses.
Figure 2 shows the association between alcohol 
consumption in midlife and risk of dementia in analysis 
adjusted for sociodemographic factors; age at which 
alcohol consumption was assessed did not modify this 
association (fig 2 and appendix table S5). Abstinence 
was associated with a higher risk of dementia when the

reference was alcohol consumption of 14 units/week; 
in these analyses alcohol consumption >14 units/week 
was associated with an increased risk of dementia in a 
linear fashion (among those drinking >14 units/week, 
P for non-linearity=0.97 using spline regressions). 
In a model adjusted for sociodemographic factors 
alcohol abstinence was associated with a greater risk 
of dementia (hazard ratio 1.47, 1.15 to 1.89) compared 
with alcohol consumption of 1-14 units/week 
(table 2). Among those drinking >14 units/week, a 7 
unit increase in alcohol consumption was associated 
with a 17% (95% confidence interval 4% to 32%) 
increase in risk of dementia. Additional adjustment 
for health behaviours and health related variables did 
not attenuate the observed associations. Use of time 
varying health related factors (data not shown) did 
not change the results: the hazard ratio for abstainers 
was 1.44 (1.11 to 1.85) and for each 7 unit increase 
in consumption among those drinking >14 units/week 
was 1.18 (1.05 to 1.34).
Compared to those with a CAGE score of 0, a higher risk 
of dementia was observed in those with a CAGE score >2 
(hazard ratio 2.19, 1.29 to 3.71). This association was 
slightly attenuated in the fully adjusted model (table 2). 
In analysis adjusted for sociodemographic factors, one 
hospital admission or more for alcohol related chronic 
disease over follow-up was associated with a 4.3 times 
higher risk of dementia (95% confidence interval 2.7 
to 6.7). This hazard ratio reduced to 3.0 (1.9 to 4.7) in 
fully adjusted analysis (table 2).
trajectories of alcohol consumption between 
midlife and early old age
We identified five trajectories of alcohol consumption 
(appendix figure S1): long term abstinence (9% 
of participants were in this group), decreased 
consumption (6%), long term consumption 1-14 
units/week group (59%), increased consumption 
(11%), and long term consumption >14 units/week 
(14%). Compared with participants in the long term 
consumption 1-14 units/week group, those with 
long term abstinence (1.74, 1.31 to 2.30), decreased 
consumption (1.55, 1.08 to 2.22), and long term 
consumption >14 units/week (1.40, 1.02 to 1.93) had 
a higher risk of dementia. These associations remained 
after adjustment for behavioural and health related 
factors (table 3).
role of cardiometabolic disease in association 
between midlife alcohol consumption and dementia
The mediating role of cardiometabolic disease was 
examined using multistate models (figs 3 and 4). Among 
those without cardiometabolic disease, compared with 
alcohol consumption of 1-14 units/week, the hazard 
ratio for dementia associated with abstinence was 1.33 
(0.88 to 2.02) and with consumption >14 units/week 
was 1.28 (0.85 to 1.92) (fig 3); corresponding hazard 
ratios in the entire population, when cardiometabolic 
disease was not taken into consideration, were 
1.47 (1.15 to 1.89) and 1.08 (0.82 to 1.43; table 2). 
In participants consuming >14 units/week (fig 4), 
cardiometabolic disease did not seem to play a role, 
as the hazard ratio associated with each increase of 
7 units/week was 1.16 (0.96 to 1.41), similar to that 
observed when cardiometabolic diseases were not 
taken into account (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32; table 2).

hazard ratio for mortality over follow-up for abstinence 
was 1.15 (0.99 to 1.32) and for alcohol consumption 
>14 units/week was 1.31 (1.15 to 1.48; appendix 
table S6). Multistate models (appendix figure S3) 
showed that these hazard ratios among participants 
without a dementia diagnosis during follow-up were 
reduced to 0.97 (0.67 to 1.41) and 1.10 (0.74 to 1.66), 
respectively, and the risk of mortality increased by 
13% (7% to 19%) for each 7 unit increment among 
participants consuming >14 units/week.
Results for dementia from the modified Fine and Gray 
model that accounts for competing risks of mortality 
were similar to those in the main analysis (table 4). 
Appendix figure S4 shows the shape of the association 
between alcohol consumption in midlife and risk 
of dementia to be unaffected by the exclusion of the 
large group of abstainers from the analysis. Regardless 
of type of alcohol consumed, the risk of dementia 
increased linearly, starting around 14 units/week 
(appendix figure S5). Subsidiary analyses examining 
potential bias due to differential misclassification 
of dementia suggested our main findings on the 
association of alcohol consumption with dementia to 
be robust (appendix table S7).
discussion
In this longitudinal study, multiple approaches to 
examine the association between alcohol consumption 
and dementia present converging evidence on 
three key findings on abstinence, excessive alcohol 
consumption, and the role of cardiometabolic 
disease. First, the risk of dementia was higher in 
those abstaining from alcohol in midlife. Alcohol 
consumption trajectories from midlife to early old age 
supported these findings—both long term abstainers 
and those reporting decreased alcohol consumption 
had an increased risk of dementia. Second, alcohol 
consumption >14 units/week increased the risk of 
dementia in a linear fashion; an excess risk that was 
evident when alcohol consumption was assessed 
at ages 50, 60, and 70 years. Data using hospital 
admission for chronic disease caused by high alcohol 
consumption showed a four times higher risk of 
dementia, supporting findings on the neurotoxic 
effects of alcohol consumption >14 units/week. Thirdly, 
multistate models showed that part of the excess risk of 
dementia in abstainers was attributable to the greater 
risk of cardiometabolic disease in this group. Taken 
together, these results suggest that abstention and 
excessive alcohol consumption are associated with an 
increased risk of dementia, although the underlying 
mechanisms are likely to be different in the two 
groups. Overall, no evidence was found that alcohol 
consumption between 1 unit/week and 14 units/week 
increases the risk of dementia.
Strengths and limitations of this study
The present study has several strengths. Repeat 
assessment of alcohol consumption allowed us to 
assess mean midlife alcohol consumption in order to 
minimise biases due to measurement error, examine 
associations with dementia of trajectories of alcohol 
consumption between midlife and early old age, and 
examine whether age modifies associations between 
alcohol consumption and dementia. These features, 
along with a mean follow-up period of 23 years, 
allowed a comprehensive assessment of the association 
of alcohol consumption with dementia. Besides 
measurement error, studies that recruit participants 
at older ages are not able to assess the excess risk in 
those who change their alcohol consumption with 
age. We were also able to examine the shape of the

association between alcohol consumption >14 units/
week and dementia, which was similar to that reported 
in a recent meta-analysis.7 Dose-response assessment 
by meta-analysis can be problematic for heavy alcohol 
consumption as the estimate is constrained to the 
mean or median consumption in the high alcohol 
consumption category.7 Finally, we used multistate 
models to examine the role of cardiometabolic 
disease and we undertook further analyses to take the 
competing risk of mortality into account where results 
were similar to those obtained using Cox regression, 
increasing confidence in our main findings.
The study findings need to be interpreted keeping 
in mind the observational nature of the data. A 
key limitation, as in other observational studies, 
is the measurement of alcohol consumption using 
self reports. It is possible that systematic reporting 
biases affected findings, although comparison of 
alcohol consumption reported by the participants 
of the Whitehall II study suggests patterns similar to 
those in several other UK cohort studies.11 The use 
of multiple approaches, including the measures of 
hospital admission for alcohol related chronic disease 
with converging findings, suggest that our results on 
excessive alcohol consumption are robust.
The ascertainment of dementia based on linkage 
to electronic health records has advantages and 
disadvantages. A recent study32 reported that 
passive assessment of dementia through UK hospital 
records has high specificity but modest sensitivity 
(78%) owing to milder cases of dementia being 
missing, as also found in the Mayo Clinic Study of 
Aging and the Adult Changes study.33 In addition to 
hospital records, we used other sources of dementia 
diagnosis, such as the UK mental health database, 
which is likely to improve the sensitivity of dementia 
diagnosis. 
Accordingly, 
our 
analyses, 
which 
simulated differential misclassification scenarios, 
show the results to be robust. Our findings are also in 
accordance with previous findings from the Whitehall 
II study suggesting that both alcohol abstinence 
and high alcohol consumption are associated with 
accelerated cognitive decline.34 The advantage of 
ascertainment through linkage to health records is that 
it allows analysis of everyone recruited to the study 
rather than only those who continue to participate in 
the study over a long follow-up and are available for 
an in-person ascertainment of dementia. A further 
difficulty of face-to-face assessment is that people can 
develop dementia and die between two assessments, 
which prevents them from being categorised as having 
dementia. Such bias is particularly likely with risk 
factors that also affect mortality, as is the case with 
excessive alcohol consumption.
comparison with other studies
A recent meta-analysis of observational studies 
concluded that light to moderate alcohol consumption 
is associated with a reduced risk of dementia, whereas 
both abstinence and heavy drinking are associated with 
a higher risk of dementia.7 In seven of the 10 studies 
included in the analysis, the mean follow-up period 
was less than 10 years, with alcohol consumption 
being assessed later in life and thus potentially 
modified by health related problems.11 In two of 
the three other studies, the CAIDE35 and the Finnish 
Twin36 cohorts, although a U-shaped association was 
suggested, results were not robust owing to the small 
number of cases in the extreme alcohol consumption 
categories. In a study based on the Swedish Twin 
Registry with 43 years of follow-up, where dementia 
was assessed through electronic health records, a

quadratic association was found whereby both no 
alcohol consumption and high alcohol consumption 
were associated with an increased risk of dementia, 
although the excess risk in abstainers did not reach 
statistical significance and the excess risk of high 
consumption began at 12 g/day (corresponding to 
around 10.5 units/week).37 The study also found, as 
in our investigation, a reduced risk of dementia for 
moderate wine consumption and a linear increased risk 
of dementia in those consuming spirits. Furthermore, a 
recent study based on a nationwide dataset of patients 
admitted to hospital in France between 2008 and 2013 
reported that those with a hospital admission record 
for alcohol use disorders had a 3.3-times higher risk of 
dementia in multivariate analysis,12 providing further 
support for our findings.
We, as with others,7 observed an increased risk 
of dementia in alcohol abstainers, a finding subject 
to much debate. As studies usually assess alcohol 
consumption only once, excess risk might be driven 
by the inclusion of former drinkers in the same group 
as abstainers.7 Our analyses using repeat data on 
alcohol consumption across midlife suggest that 
former drinking might not explain the excess dementia 
risk in abstainers, although we cannot exclude the 
possibility that those who report alcohol abstinence 
in midlife were heavy drinkers in young adulthood 
or misreported their alcohol consumption. We 
accounted for several sociodemographic and health 
related characteristics in the analysis, but residual 
confounding cannot be excluded as an explanation 
for the higher risk of dementia among abstainers. 
Indeed, this group is particular in that it is composed 
mainly of women from the lower socioeconomic group 
with higher prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors 
and disease at baseline, a pattern that has also been 
observed in other studies.35 37
Alcohol abstinence is also associated with a higher 
risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,1 15 which 
might increase the risk of dementia.4 16 A recent 
study of nearly 600 000 people, for example, found a 
J-shaped association between alcohol consumption 
and cardiovascular disease, with a weekly alcohol 
consumption of 100 g (12.5 units) being associated 
with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease and a 
higher disease risk observed in those consuming smaller 
amounts of alcohol.14 Moderate alcohol consumption 
has been hypothesised to benefit cardiovascular 
health through favourable impacts on lipid profile, 
inflammation level, endothelial function, and insulin 
sensitivity.13 38 In agreement with this, a meta-analysis 
of interventional studies (alcohol use versus a period 
of no alcohol use) reported that moderate alcohol 
consumption had favourable effects on levels of high 
density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, 
adiponectin, and fibrinogen,38 potentially underlying 
the apparent neuroprotective effects of moderate alcohol 
consumption. Our multistate models lent partial support 
for a mediating role of cardiometabolic disease in the 
association between alcohol abstention and increased 
risk of dementia; the hazard ratio of dementia associated 
with alcohol abstinence, compared with moderate 
consumption, was reduced to 1.33 (95% confidence 
interval 0.88 to 2.02) in those without cardiometabolic 
disease, compared with 1.47 (1.15 to 1.89) in the 
entire population. Nevertheless, studies using other 
approaches such as mendelian randomisation39 
and brain imaging data from a subsample of the 
Whitehall II study40 suggest linear adverse effects of 
alcohol consumption. The present findings on alcohol 
abstinence should therefore not motivate people who do 
not drink to start drinking given the known detrimental 
effects of alcohol consumption for all cause mortality 
and diseases such as neuropsychiatric disorders, 
cirrhosis of the liver, and cancer.1
Excessive alcohol drinking is detrimental for the 
brain,6 7 41 42 but the level from which this effect is 
evident is less clear. We assessed the impact of alcohol 
consumption using the 14 units/week threshold 
advocated by guidelines in the United Kingdom.18 
From this level onwards, the risk of dementia increased

in a linear fashion. In addition, long term exposure to 
alcohol consumption above this limit increased the risk 
of dementia by 50% compared with long term moderate 
consumption (1-14 units/week). These results support 
the recent downward revision of UK guidelines that 
moved the recommended alcohol consumption limit 
to 14 units/week in men compared with 21 units/week 
before, bringing them in line with women. Analyses on 
alcohol dependence scale and hospital admission for 
alcohol related chronic disease strengthen the evidence 
that excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for 
dementia. The negative impact of heavy alcohol intake 
on the risk of dementia has been suggested to involve 
nutritional deficiency,42 43 the direct neurotoxic effects 
of ethanol,42 and the indirect negative impacts through 
increased risk of diabetes,44 hypertension,45 and 
stroke.46 47
conclusion
Given the number of people living with dementia 
is expected to triple by 20503 and the absence of a 
cure, prevention is key.4 We show that both long term 
alcohol abstinence and excessive alcohol consumption 
may increase the risk of dementia. The UK guidelines 
suggest an alcohol threshold of 14 units/week but 
many countries use a much higher threshold to 
define excessive consumption.48 The present study 
encourages the use of a lower threshold of alcohol 
consumption in such guidelines, applicable over the 
adult life course, in order to promote cognitive health.
