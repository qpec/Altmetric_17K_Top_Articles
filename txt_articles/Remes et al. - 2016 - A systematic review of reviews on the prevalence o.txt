Abstract
Background: A fragmented research field exists on the prevalence of anxiety
disorders. Here, we present the results of a systematic review of reviews on this
topic. We included the highest quality studies to inform practice and policy on
this issue. Method: Using PRISMA methodology, extensive electronic and man-
ual citation searches were performed to identify relevant reviews. Screening,
data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by two reviewers.
Inclusion criteria consisted of systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the preva-
lence of anxiety disorders that fulfilled at least half of the AMSTAR quality cri-
teria. Results: We identified a total of 48 reviews and described the prevalence
of anxiety across population subgroups and settings, as reported by these stud-
ies. Despite the high heterogeneity of prevalence estimates across primary stud-
ies, there was emerging and compelling evidence of substantial prevalence of
anxiety disorders generally (3.8–25%), and particularly in women (5.2–8.7%);
young adults (2.5–9.1%); people with chronic diseases (1.4–70%); and individu-
als from Euro/Anglo cultures (3.8–10.4%) versus individuals from Indo/Asian
(2.8%), African (4.4%), Central/Eastern European (3.2%), North African/Mid-
dle Eastern (4.9%), and Ibero/Latin cultures (6.2%). Conclusions: The preva-
lence of anxiety disorders is high in population subgroups across the globe.
Recent research has expanded its focus to Asian countries, an increasingly
greater number of physical and psychiatric conditions, and traumatic events
associated with anxiety. Further research on illness trajectories and anxiety
levels pre- and post-treatment is needed. Few studies have been conducted in
developing and under-developed parts of the world and have little representa-
tion in the global literature.
Introduction
Anxiety disorders – defined by excess worry, hyperarou-
sal, and fear that is counterproductive and debilitating –
are some of the most common psychiatric conditions in
the Western world (Simpson et al. 2010). The prevalence
of anxiety disorders in the United States is estimated to
be 18% (Kessler et al. 2005), and their annual cost is
reported to be $42.3 billion (Greenberg et al. 1999). In
the European Union (EU), over 60 million people are
affected by anxiety disorders in a given year, making
them the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in the EU
(Wittchen et al. 2011). The Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) study estimated that anxiety disorders
contribu-
ted to 26.8 million disability adjusted life years in 2010.
(Whiteford et al. 2013). While a number of reviews have
focused on the burden of depression and its economic,
social, and health care policy implications, substantially
fewer have assessed anxiety.
The past decade has seen increased research interest
into anxiety disorders, in large part because of a greater
recognition of their burden and the implications associ-
ated with untreated illness. Clinical reviews have shown
that the presence of an anxiety disorder is a risk factor
for the development of other anxiety and mood disor-
ders and substance abuse. In clinical and population-
based studies, the development of comorbidities makes
the treatment of primary and secondary disorders diffi-
cult, contributes to low remission rates, poor prognosis
and risk of suicide (Nutt and Ballenger 2003; Simpson
et al. 2010). Untreated anxiety has been associated with
significant personal and societal costs, related to frequent

 primary and acute care visits, decreased work productiv-
ity, unemployment, and impaired social relationships
(Simpson et al. 2010).
A number of primary studies on the prevalence of anx-
iety have been undertaken, but the variability in findings
has made generalizability to the wider population diffi-
cult. This variability mainly results from differences in
study setting (i.e., culture; clinical vs. population-based),
age and sex composition of samples, length of follow-up,
methods of anxiety assessment, and caseness criteria (i.e.,
types and number of disorders examined). Systematic
reviews on the prevalence of these conditions in highly
select, homogeneous population subgroups have been
undertaken, but the selective citation of such estimates
presents a distorted view of the overall burden of anxiety
and limits generalizability.
The aim of this systematic review of reviews was to pro-
vide a comprehensive synthesis and description of the
prevalence of anxiety disorders in the general population,
as well as in clinical outpatient and inpatient groups
affected by a range of chronic physical diseases and psychi-
atric disorders, as reported by individual reviews. Individ-
uals recruited from the community can have different risk
factor profiles than those sampled from clinical settings,
potentially giving rise to different rates of mental health
problems amongst these groups (Nutt and Ballenger 2003;
Simpson et al. 2010). As a result, the burden needs to be
assessed across different settings and segments of the pop-
ulation. To provide insight into the demographic groups
that are most affected, we reported on estimates for men
and women and different age groups, if this information
was available. Since a number of studies (Walters et al.
2004; Skapinakis et al. 2005; Simpson et al. 2010) have
identified the need to better understand the geographical
variation of mental health problems, we included reviews
that captured studies conducted across the globe at
national and subnational levels. To provide insight into
the chronicity of anxiety disorders, we provided period
(i.e., 12-month) and lifetime prevalence estimates. If the
duration criterion was not clearly stated or the “point” or
“current” prevalence was indicated, we simply referred to
these estimates as “prevalence”.
Findings from this systematic review will shed light on
the groups that are most affected by anxiety disorders, and
can be used to inform targeted screening and treatment
efforts. This will be important in the planning of health ser-
vices and the development of evidence-based policy.
Finally, results from this review can be used to identify
areas where further research is needed.
This is the first study to provide a comprehensive syn-
thesis of the disparate findings from systematic reviews
undertaken on the burden of anxiety across the globe and
using a systematic approach.
Methods
Search strategy
We defined a systematic review in accordance with the
Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
Statement (Moher et al. 2009). (Appendix 1) We included
high-quality reviews that reported the prevalence of anxiety
disorders in the general population or clinic-based settings.
We searched for reviews on young, middle-aged, and older
adults with risk behaviors (i.e., drug abuse), chronic or infec-
tious diseases, psychiatric conditions, who are vulnerable,
and living in countries across the globe. Reviews on the treat-
ment of anxiety were not included, as we consider this to be a
separate review topic that would merit an in-depth analysis.
To identify reviews meeting the inclusion criteria,
we searched Medline (inception-May, 2015), PsycInfo
(1987-May, 2015), and Embase (inception-May, 2015)
using combinations of keywords relating to anxiety and
prevalence (Appendix 2). Reference lists were hand-searched
for additional reviews. Titles and abstracts of non-English
language articles were translated to assess relevance. We
excluded unpublished data. The review protocol is registered
on PROSPERO (Remes et al. 2014).
Inclusion criteria
We searched for reviews that reported the lifetime, per-
iod, or point prevalence (or simply “prevalence”) of gen-
eralized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) or social
phobia, agoraphobia, panic disorder (PD) with or without
agoraphobia, and simple or specific phobia, and anxiety
not otherwise specified (NOS). Studies that reported the
prevalence of aggregated anxiety disorders, subthreshold
disorders,
or
anxiety
symptoms
were
also
included.
Reviews were included regardless of the sampling frame-
work used in primary studies.
Reviews were included regardless of the method of anx-
iety assessment. Specifically, reviews capturing primary
studies on threshold and subthreshold disorders that were
assessed through fully, semi-, or unstructured interviews
administered by clinicians or trained professionals, symp-
tom checklists, clinician diagnoses, and self-report were
accepted. Interviews or self-reported questionnaires that
mapped to standard classificatory systems, such as the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 2010) or the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World
Health Organization, 2016), were also included.

 reports, letters, and commentaries were excluded. Full-text
articles were retrieved for further assessment by OR.
Quality assessment
Quality assessment of the reviews meeting the inclusion
criteria was undertaken by OR and RvdL. If reviews met
at least five of the criteria stipulated by AMSTAR (Shea
et al. 2009), a validated measurement tool for assessing
the quality of systematic reviews, they were included. For
example, some of the AMSTAR quality criteria assess
whether an “a priori” design was established, whether
there was duplicate study selection and data extraction, if
the literature search was comprehensive, whether the
quality of primary studies was examined, etc.
Data extraction and analysis
Data extraction was performed by OR and RvdL using the
standardized form capturing device: the dates of publica-
tion and literature search; objectives; number of studies
reviewed; prevalence of anxiety; sample characteristics;
sample size range of primary studies; recommendations for
future research, and limitations of primary studies and
review. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.
Studies
were
grouped
according
to
five
common
themes and prevalence was described in the context of:
(1) addiction, (2) other mental and neurological disor-
ders, (3) chronic physical diseases, (4) trauma, and (5)
vulnerable population subgroups. If there were fewer than
three reviews on a chronic physical disease, it was
grouped under: “other chronic physical diseases” or
“other chronic physical diseases in end-stage”. Vulnerable
population subgroups refer to individuals at high risk for
poor health, who may experience stigma, marginalization,
or health service access barriers.
We did not perform a meta-analysis because of the
heterogeneity in study methodology. Quantitative mea-
surement of heterogeneity was not undertaken. Finally, a
meta-analysis of primary studies included in 48 systematic
reviews would not have been feasible. We described the
prevalence of individual and aggregate anxiety disorders,
subthreshold
disorders,
or
symptoms
of
anxiety,
as
reported by the systematic reviews. If reviews provided
clear prevalence estimates for men and women and differ-
ent age groups, we also included this information.
Results
The search identified 1232 reviews on anxiety. After 338
duplicates
were
removed,
titles
and
abstracts
were
screened, and the full text of 198 articles was retrieved. In
total, 46 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria
(Fig. 1).
Reference
searches
identified
two
additional
reviews as relevant, yielding a total of 48 reviews in this
systematic review (Appendix 3).
Of the 48 reviews, seven focused on the descriptive epi-
demiology of anxiety disorders, while five reviewed anxi-
ety in relation to addiction. Four focused on mental and
neurological disorders. A total of 19 reviews assessed anx-
iety in the context of chronic physical diseases: most of
these focused on CVD (n = 6) and cancer (n = 7), fol-
lowed by respiratory disease (n = 3) and diabetes (n = 3);
the rest examined end-stage physical disease (n = 4), and
conditions that have been less commonly studied in the
anxiety field (n = 4). Three reviews examined anxiety in
the context of trauma, and ten focused on vulnerable
population subgroups. Most of the reviews included
international studies.
The global distribution of anxiety disorders
Seven reviews focused on the descriptive epidemiology of
anxiety disorders, presenting age-, sex-, and time trends. In
one international review (Somers et al. 2006), the pooled
one-year and lifetime prevalence of total anxiety disorders
was estimated to be 10.6% (95% CI: 7.5%, 14.3%) and
16.6% (95% CI: 12.7%, 21.1%), respectively. Given the
health care policy and service planning implications of high
estimates, a high-quality meta-analysis (Baxter et al. 2014)
investigated whether the age-standardized point prevalence
of anxiety increased over the last decade. Studies on cul-
tures across the globe were reviewed and findings showed
that the prevalence in 1990 (3.8% [95% CI: 3.6%, 4.1%]
was very similar to that in 2005 and 2010 (4.0% [95% CI:
3.7%, 4.2%]). A sharp rise in younger people over time was
noted, but changing age and population structures were
hypothesized to be the drivers of this. Prevalence was found
to be lowest in East Asia (2.8% [95% CI: 2.2%, 3.4%]) and
highest in North America (7.7% [95% CI: 6.8%, 8.8%])
and the North African/Middle Eastern region (7.7% [95%
CI: 6.0%, 10%]) (Baxter et al. 2014). A less rigorous review
(Somers et al. 2006) estimated the highest lifetime preva-
lence of anxiety disorders in Swiss and US populations
(23–28.7%), and the lowest in studies on Korea (9.2%). In
Pakistan (Mirza and Jenkins 2004), the prevalence of total
anxiety ranged from 1.76% to 25%, while a meta-analysis
on Germany (Vehling et al. 2012) reported it to be 13.5%
(95% CI: 7.1%, 24.3%).
Women are almost twice as likely to be affected as men
(female:male ratio of 1.9:1), with sex differences persisting
over time and across high and low resource settings
(Somers et al. 2006; Baxter et al. 2013; Steel et al. 2014).
Irrespective of culture, individuals under the age of
35 years are disproportionately affected by anxiety disor-
ders (Baxter et al. 2013, 2014) with the exception of

Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders in Adult Populations
 Pakistan, where midlife represents a period of high bur-
den (Mirza and Jenkins 2004).
Globally, specific phobia (4.9% [95% CI: 3.4%, 6.8%]
and GAD (6.2% (95% CI: 4.0%, 9.2%) appear to have
the highest lifetime prevalence, and panic disorder the
lowest (1.2% [95% CI: 95% CI: 0.7%, 1.9%]) (Somers
et al. 2006). In Germany, however, specific phobia (5.2%,
[95%CI: 3.3%, 8.2%]) and GAD (3.7%, [95% CI: 2.3%,
6.0%]) are reported to be the most prevalent anxiety dis-
orders (Vehling et al. 2012). In addition to geographical
variation, caseness criteria are an important consideration
when comparing
estimates.
One
review reported
an
almost twofold higher prevalence of subthreshold GAD
when the duration criterion was relaxed from 3 to
1 month (3.6% vs. 6.1%). In this review, older age groups
showed the lowest estimates of past-year subthreshold
GAD (3%) (Haller et al. 2014).
Addiction
Five reviews focused on anxiety experienced in relation to
addictive behaviors, including substance misuse, patholog-
ical gambling, and compulsive internet use. A global
review on nonmedical prescription opioid use (NMPOU)
reported the overall lifetime anxiety prevalence in patients
at admissions or in treatment for substance abuse prob-
lems to range from 2% to 67% (Fatseas et al. 2010).
While the prevalence of anxiety diagnoses is reportedly
high at 29% (95% CI: 14%, 44%), that of subthreshold
anxiety is higher still, with half of NMPOU populations
enrolled in substance abuse treatment in North America
reporting symptoms (50% [95% CI: 16%, 84%]) (Gold-
ner et al. 2014). In contrast, general population samples
of NMPOU in North America show a substantially lower
prevalence of anxiety (16% [95% CI: 1%, 30%]) (Fischer

Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders in Adult Populations
O. Remes et al.
 et al. 2012). No significant age or sex-effects were found
in NMPOU groups enrolled in substance use treatment
(Goldner et al. 2014).
Two other risk behaviors that have received attention
in the addiction field include problem and pathological
gambling, and more recently, internet addiction. When a
global meta-analysis assessed 11 community samples of
pathological gamblers, the prevalence of anxiety disorders
was reported to be 37.4% (Lorains et al. 2011). The
prevalence of anxiety in the context of internet addiction
is lower and comes mostly from studies conducted in
Asian countries. A meta-analysis found the prevalence of
anxiety to be over two times higher in community sam-
ples of people with Internet addiction compared to con-
trol subjects (23.3% [95% CI: 14.8, 34.8%] vs 10.3%
[95% CI: 5.0, 19.9%]), with those under the age of 39
being most affected (Ho et al. 2014).
Other mental and neurological disorders
In Europe, approximately 13–28% of people with bipolar
disorder recruited from clinical and community settings
have comorbid anxiety, with GAD and panic disorder being
frequently experienced by this population (Fajutrao et al.
2009). In the US and Italian samples with bipolar disorder
(Amerio et al. 2014), OCD is also common. The prevalence
of this anxiety disorder in those who are bipolar has been
shown to range from 11.1% to 21% in population-based
studies, and 1.8% to 35.1% in clinical samples.
OCD is also highly comorbid with schizophrenia. A glo-
bal review (Swets et al. 2014) estimated the prevalence of
this disorder in people diagnosed with schizophrenia to be
12.3% (95% CI: 9.7%, 15.4%). The prevalence of obsessive
compulsive symptoms (OCS) not meeting full caseness cri-
teria was over twice that of OCD (30.7% [95% CI: 23%,
39.6%]). Lower anxiety prevalence was linked to sub-
Saharan African origin. Age and sex did not influence
OCD or OCS rates (Swets et al. 2014). These estimates
were mainly based on groups from clinical settings.
One of the highest prevalence figures of psychopathology
was found by a review on multiple sclerosis (MS) (Marrie
et al. 2015), which reported that almost 32% of people
with MS have an anxiety disorder and over half experience
symptoms. Some of the primary studies included in this
review were based on participants recruited from the gen-
eral population, suggesting that men and women with MS
are at high risk for psychopathology. Health anxiety may
be an important issue in this population subgroup, given
that 26.4% of those with MS are affected. Study methodol-
ogy made a significant contribution to the figures reported.
Estimates of anxiety prevalence were substantially higher if
they were derived through self-reported questionnaires
(25.5%
[95%
CI:
16.7%,
34.3%])
compared
to
administrative databases or medical records (15.4%, [95%
CI: 0%, 39.0%]) (Marrie et al. 2015).
Chronic physical diseases
Cardiovascular disease
Six reviews reported the prevalence of anxiety in the con-
text of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Approximately a
tenth of patients with cardiovascular disease and living in
Western countries are affected by GAD (10.94% [95% CI:
7.8%, 14.0%] (Tully and Cosh 2013), with women show-
ing higher anxiety levels than men (Clarke and Currie
2009). Anxiety symptom prevalence among patients with
congestive heart failure is 2–49% (Janssen et al. 2008),
and in end-stage patients suffering from heart disease, it
is 49% (Solano et al. 2006). Further, panic disorder is a
common diagnosis in patients with coronary artery dis-
ease, with the prevalence ranging from 10% to 50% in
this subgroup (Clarke and Currie 2009).
Individuals with noncardiac or nonspecific chest pain
presenting to emergency departments, particularly women
and those who are younger, appear to be disproportion-
ately affected by anxiety. Compared to those with a deter-
mined cause of chest pain, anxiety prevalence was found
to be higher in those with unknown etiology (21–53.5%
of noncardiac chest pain patients have probable anxiety)
(Webster et al. 2012).
A high-quality, global meta-analysis of population-, hos-
pital-, and rehabilitation-based studies found the preva-
lence of anxiety disorders in stroke patients to vary between
18% (95% CI: 8%, 29%) and 25% (95% CI: 21%, 28%)
when measured by clinical interview and rating scales,
respectively (Campbell Burton et al. 2013). Age and sex did
not influence the probability of having anxiety after stroke
in most of the included studies. GAD and phobic disorders
were the commonest anxiety disorders post-stroke.
Cancer
Seven reviews assessed anxiety among individuals diag-
nosed with or receiving treatment for cancer and in
spouses of cancer patients. The prevalence of anxiety
among cancer patients varies between 15% and 23%, with
symptoms rising to 69–79% in the later stages of disease.
There was no reported evidence with respect to age and
sex (Solano et al. 2006; Clarke and Currie 2009).
A meta-analysis (Yang et al. 2013) on working-age and
older adults living in Mainland China showed that the
overall prevalence of anxiety in individuals with a cancer
diagnosis was higher than that in noncancer controls
(49.7% [95%CI: 20.0%, 89.1%] and 17.5%, respectively).

Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders in Adult Populations
 prevalence of anxiety was comparatively lower than in
Chinese patients, ranging from 28.0% to 33.0% (Vehling
et al. 2012).
Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and non-RCT
studies conducted across the globe showed that approxi-
mately a fourth to over half of individuals undergoing or
who had undergone breast cancer treatment experienced
anxiety (Lim et al. 2011). Lower levels of anxiety were
observed in patients undergoing radiotherapy rather than
chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, young age and high
trait anxiety measured before infusions were correlated
with the intensity of anxiety experienced (Lim et al.
2011).
Among
ovarian
cancer
patients,
younger
age
groups were also disproportionately affected by anxiety.
Following treatment for ovarian cancer, psychopathology
tended to persist, with almost half (47%) of individuals
experiencing anxiety symptoms at three months post-
treatment (Arden-Close et al. 2008).
Long-term cancer survivors and their spouses also
experience elevated levels of anxiety. In a global meta-
analysis of outpatient clinic, hospital, and population-
based samples (Mitchell et al. 2013), the prevalence of
anxiety in individuals who had been diagnosed with
cancer at least 2 years previously was found to be much
higher than in healthy controls (17.9% [95% CI: 12.8%,
23.6%] and 13.9% [95% CI: 9.8%, 18.5%], respectively).
Further, almost half (40.1% [95% CI: 25.4%, 55.9%]) of
spouses of long-term cancer survivors developed anxiety.
No age or sex effects were reported.
Respiratory disease
Three reviews focusing on anxiety in the context of respi-
ratory disease indicated that the prevalence of anxiety was
high among adults with COPD (32–57%) (Janssen et al.
2008), and higher still among those with far-advanced,
end-stage respiratory disease (51–75%) (Solano et al.
2006). Among acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ALI/ARDS) survivors discharged from inten-
sive care units in the United States and Germany, anxiety
levels ranged from 23% to 48% (Davydow et al. 2008).
No age or sex effects were reported.
Diabetes
Three systematic reviews assessed anxiety in adults with
diabetes. One high-quality global review of mostly North
American
and European
studies
(Smith et al. 2013)
showed that the prevalence is significantly elevated in
those with diabetes compared to other groups, but is also
dependant on caseness criteria. Approximately 15% to
73% of people with diabetes have anxiety symptoms not
meeting
threshold
criteria
(vs.
19.9%
to
43.1%
of
nondiabetic individuals), while 1.4% to 15.6% of people
with diabetes meet threshold criteria for an anxiety disor-
der (vs. 1.6% to 8.8% of nondiabetic individuals). In
another review capturing studies predominantly con-
ducted in primary care or clinical settings, women with
diabetes were found to have an almost two-fold higher
prevalence of anxiety than men with diabetes (55.3% and
32.9%)
(Grigsby
et al.
2002).
Age
effects
were
not
reported. The anxiety disorders that are most common in
the context of diabetes are anxiety not otherwise specified,
specific phobia, GAD, and social phobia (Grigsby et al.
2002; Clarke and Currie 2009).
Other chronic physical diseases
Four reviews assessed anxiety in population subgroups
with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), benign joint
hypermobility syndrome, musculoskeletal pain, and age-
related macular degeneration. Clinical, mostly Western
samples
of
women
with
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(PCOS) had a much higher prevalence of generalized anx-
iety symptoms than control groups (20.4% and 3.9%,
respectively) (Dokras et al. 2012). There is some evidence
that social phobia and OCD are comorbid with PCOS.
Differences in anxiety levels according to age were not
found (Dokras et al. 2012).
Widely varying anxiety prevalence figures have been
reported for Mediterranean populations with benign joint
hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) (5–68%) (Smith et al.
2014), as well as for Western populations with muscu-
loskeletal pain (0–20.9%) (Andersen et al. 2014). In rela-
tion to the latter group, the link between fibromyalgia
and anxiety appears to be particularly strong. In people
with BJHS, commonly occurring comorbidities are agora-
phobia and panic disorder (Smith et al. 2014). The only
chronic condition that has failed to show a link with anx-
iety is age-related macular degeneration; while this review
recruited patients from clinics, it was largely based on US
studies (Dawson et al. 2014).
Other chronic physical diseases in end-stage
Four reviews assessed anxiety in end-stage conditions. A
global meta-analysis of mostly Western studies (Mitchell
et al. 2011) estimated the pooled prevalence of anxiety
disorders in palliative cancer patients to be 9.8% (95%
CI: 6.8%, 13.2%). Estimates appear to vary widely by
condition. Among patients with chronic renal failure, the
prevalence of anxiety symptoms was found to be 25% in
the terminal stage (Janssen et al. 2008), whereas another
review found a prevalence of 38% in patients with end-
stage
renal
disease
(Murtagh
et al.
2007).

 symptom prevalence of 8–34%, the highest estimates were
found for end-stage COPD (51–75%) and cancer patients
(13–79%) (Solano et al. 2006). No associations between
age or sex and anxiety were found in palliative-care set-
tings (Mitchell et al. 2011).
Trauma
Three reviews tackled the issue of anxiety in the context of
trauma. The first was primarily based on findings from UK
and US studies and focused on traumatic limb amputees,
and included veterans that had served in Vietnam, Iraq and
Afghanistan (Mckechnie and John 2014). Very high preva-
lence figures were found, with anxiety affecting a fourth of
traumatic limb amputees in some studies to over half in
others. The second review was global in scope and assessed
the frequency of lifetime anxiety among individuals with a
history of sexual abuse (Chen et al. 2010). Widely varying
anxiety estimates were reported by this review, ranging
from 2% to 82%. Finally, a third review focused on GAD
in refugees resident in high-income Western countries;
over half of the refugees were from southeast Asia. This
meta-analysis estimated that 4% of refugees experience
GAD (Fazel et al. 2005). No age or sex effects in relation to
anxiety disorders were reported.
Vulnerable population subgroups
Older people and their caregivers
Five reviews assessed anxiety in older people and their
caregivers. The prevalence of anxiety disorders in old age
varies
widely
in
community
(1.2–14%)
and
clinical
(1–28%) studies conducted mostly in European and North
American settings. Estimates are even higher when anxiety
symptoms are accounted for. GAD is the commonest anxi-
ety disorder in old age, with the prevalence ranging from
1.3% to 4.7% (Bryant et al. 2008). A random-effects model
(Volkert et al. 2013) showed that specific phobia also
occurs frequently in older samples living in the commu-
nity, while agoraphobia is the rarest anxiety disorder (Bry-
ant
et al.
2008).
Women
are
at
higher
risk
for
psychopathology than men (Bryant et al. 2008).
Older population subgroups with cognitive dysfunction
and their caregivers are disproportionately affected by
anxiety (Monastero et al. 2009). In older people with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prevalence of anxi-
ety symptoms varies from 11% to 75% (Monastero et al.
2009; Yates et al. 2013). Caregivers of older people with
cognitive impairment are also affected by anxiety (preva-
lence estimates of 3.7–76.5%), with women and younger
caregivers showing elevated levels (Cooper et al. 2007;
Bryant et al. 2008).
Pregnant women
Three reviews focused on pregnant women. A meta-analy-
sis of international studies (Russell et al. 2013) reported
higher OCD prevalence in pregnant (2.07%, [95% CI:
1.26%, 3.37%]) and postpartum (up to 12 months)
(2.43%, [95% CI: 1.46%, 4.00%]) women compared to
the general population (1.08%, [95%: 0.80%, 1.46%]).
Asia and Europe had the lowest prevalence of OCD across
conditions, while the Middle East and Africa had the
highest. In Ethiopian and Nigerian samples recruited
from health clinics and the community (Sawyer et al.
2010), the prevalence of anxiety was found to be high
during both the pre- and post-natal periods (14.8% [95%
CI: 12.3%, 17.4%] and 14.0% [95% CI: 12.9%, 15.2%],
respectively), with younger women showing elevated anxi-
ety compared to older women (Sawyer et al. 2010). There
is also some evidence from UK and US studies that a
high BMI may contribute to anxiety symptoms during
pregnancy (Molyneaux et al. 2014).
Individuals identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual,
and self-harm patients
Two reviews focused on (1) predominantly Western indi-
viduals living in the community and identifying as les-
bian, gay or bisexual (LGB), and (2) self-harm patients
presenting to general hospitals in countries across the
globe. In LBG men, anxiety prevalence was estimated to
be 3–20%, while LGB women showed somewhat higher
estimates, at 3–39% (King et al. 2008). In a global meta-
analysis of self-harm patients presenting to hospitals, the
prevalence of anxiety disorders was found to be 35%
(95% CI: 21.9%, 48.6%). Age- and sex-based differences
were small, while rates of anxiety were highest in young
and old age groups of self-harm adults (Hawton et al.
2013). All non-Western studies of self-harm patients were
based in Asia, while most of the Western studies were
conducted in the United Kingdom.
Discussion
We have synthesized 48 reviews on prevalence studies
conducted across the globe. This is the first review to
undertake a comprehensive synthesis of the systematic
reviews conducted to date on the prevalence of anxiety
disorders. It provides a comprehensive, up-to-date sum-
mary of the state of knowledge in this area.
A number of studies within the reviews were conducted
in North America (predominantly the United States) and
Europe (Fazel et al. 2005; Cooper et al. 2007; Arden-
Close et al. 2008; Davydow et al. 2008; Fajutrao et al.

2014; Mckechnie and John 2014; Molyneaux et al. 2014;

tion samples (Mirza and Jenkins 2004; Bryant et al. 2008;
Fajutrao et al. 2009; Monastero et al. 2009; Chen et al.
2010; Sawyer et al. 2010; Lim et al. 2011; Campbell Bur-

Russell et al. 2013; Yates et al. 2013; Amerio et al. 2014;
Haller et al. 2014; Molyneaux et al. 2014), and used
mainly DSM or ICD criteria to ascertain diagnoses (Faju-
trao et al. 2009; Hawton et al. 2013; Mitchell et al. 2013;
Amerio et al. 2014; Goldner et al. 2014; Mckechnie and
John 2014; Baxter et al. 2013; Swets et al. 2014). Younger
age groups (Arden-Close et al. 2008; Sawyer et al. 2010;
Lim et al. 2011; Webster et al. 2012; Hawton et al. 2013;
Yates et al. 2013; Baxter et al. 2014; Haller et al. 2014;
Ho et al. 2014; Baxter et al. 2013), women (Somers et al.
2006; Bryant et al. 2008; Clarke and Currie 2009; Webster
et al. 2012; Baxter et al. 2013, 2014; Hawton et al. 2013;
Yates et al. 2013; Haller et al. 2014; Steel et al. 2014), and
people from North America and North Africa/Middle
East (Somers et al. 2006; Baxter et al. 2014) showed the
highest prevalence of anxiety. Estimates remained stable
or declined with age (Somers et al. 2006; Baxter et al.
2013), and secular trends were not observed in relation to
the prevalence of total anxiety 4 (Baxter et al. 2014).
Compared to healthy populations or control groups,
prevalence was higher in individuals with chronic physical
diseases (Mitchell et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013), and the
burden was particularly high in the end stage (Solano et al.
2006; Murtagh et al. 2007; Mitchell et al. 2011). Anxiety
symptoms tended to persist post-disease if present before
disease onset (Sawyer et al. 2010), reflecting a chronic,
unremitting
pattern
of
psychopathology.
Individuals
exposed to trauma or who were vulnerable and at risk for
stigma (Cooper et al. 2007; Bryant et al. 2008; King et al.
2008; Monastero et al. 2009; Sawyer et al. 2010; Hawton
et al. 2013; Russell et al. 2013; Volkert et al. 2013; Yates
et al. 2013; Molyneaux et al. 2014), such as older people
with cognitive impairment (Yates et al. 2013), were also
more likely to experience anxiety. Prevalence figures were
heterogeneous, and this made comparison between studies
difficult. Heterogeneity was driven by differences in case-
ness criteria and sampling methods. For example, a meta-
regression (Swets et al. 2014) that assessed the influence of
instrument differences on OCD prevalence in the context
of schizophrenia showed that the prevalence was higher
with the use of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
Scale (YBOCS)/Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (OCI)
(Goodman et al. 1989; Foa et al. 1998) compared to other
instruments. Also, the lower the threshold of the YBOCS,
the higher the estimated prevalence. A range of methods
was used to measure anxiety, such as, standardized, struc-
tured interviews administered by trained professionals,
clinician diagnoses, symptom checklists, and self-report.
Some reviews attempted to handle the assessment of anxi-
ety in alternative ways. For example, one review (Baxter
et al. 2013) mapped estimates onto ICD or DSM diagnos-
tic criteria and conducted a meta-analysis to provide an
aggregate measure of anxiety. Other reviews either did not
attempt a meta-analysis, or because of very large differ-
ences
in
sampling
methods
within
primary
studies,
reported disaggregated estimates and ranges found in pri-
mary studies. Across reviews, higher prevalence figures
were found when subthreshold disorders or symptoms
were assessed (Bryant et al. 2008; Goldner et al. 2014; Hal-
ler et al. 2014; Swets et al. 2014; Marrie et al. 2015) and
when lifetime rather than past-year or current prevalence
was estimated (Somers et al. 2006; Volkert et al. 2013).
With the exception of one review (Monastero et al. 2009),
authors did not account for the use of psychoactive pre-
scription medicines, such as anxiolytics, which could influ-
ence the reporting of anxiety symptoms.
Reviews produced inflated prevalence estimates with
the use of less robust methodologies. Within reviews, low
and variable response rates across primary studies were
identified as another limitation (Somers et al. 2006; Hal-
ler et al. 2014). In one review, response rates across stud-
ies ranged from 45.9% to 99.5% (Steel et al. 2014).
The areas that received the most attention in the anxi-
ety field include addiction and chronic physical diseases
(mainly cancer, CVD, and respiratory diseases), while
anxiety disorders other than PTSD in the context of (1)
trauma and (2) psychiatric or neurological conditions,
such as internet addiction and multiple sclerosis, are rela-
tively new and underresearched areas. Surprisingly, only
one review (King et al. 2008) examined LGB groups,
despite this population being at high risk for poor health
(Fredriksen-Goldsen et al. 2013). Authors of this review
(King et al. 2008) called for further research to produce
more refined and consistent definitions of LGB and the
recruitment of more representative samples.
Although most of the reviews included in this system-
atic review were conducted in the last few years, the field
of anxiety is rapidly gaining research interest. Some dif-
ferences in findings and methodologies between older and
more recent reviews were noted. For example, recent
reviews are increasingly recognizing that early adulthood
is the period with the highest peak in anxiety (Arden-
Close et al. 2008; Sawyer et al. 2010; Lim et al. 2011;
Webster et al. 2012; Hawton et al. 2013; Yates et al. 2013;
Baxter et al. 2014; Haller et al. 2014; Ho et al. 2014; Bax-
ter et al. 2013), and the contexts within which psy-
chopathology is assessed are expanding to a greater
number of physical diseases and newly emergent disorders

Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders in Adult Populations

 [e.g. internet addiction (Ho et al. 2014)]. Also, newer
research is starting to expand its scope to Asian countries
(Yang et al. 2013; Ho et al. 2014), a previously identified
limitation. More recent reviews are of higher quality, and
have started considering instrument differences and their
effects on prevalence estimates (Lorains et al. 2011; Swets
et al. 2014), another previously identified limitation.
Recommendations for future research and
clinical practice
Recommendations for future research were made by
review authors, such as the use of longitudinal designs to
address temporality issues (Murtagh et al. 2007; Arden-
Close et al. 2008; Bryant et al. 2008; Janssen et al. 2008;
King et al. 2008; Clarke and Currie 2009; Sawyer et al.
2010; Dokras et al. 2012; Fischer et al. 2012; Webster
et al. 2012; Russell et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2013; Goldner
et al. 2014; Ho et al. 2014; Mckechnie and John 2014);
population-based research that is less susceptible to the
help-seeking/self-selection bias often present in clinical
studies (Grigsby et al. 2002; Murtagh et al. 2007); and the
use of valid and reliable instruments and consistent
approaches to examine anxiety levels pre- and post-dis-
ease (Davydow et al. 2008; Monastero et al. 2009; Sawyer
et al. 2010; Webster et al. 2012; Campbell Burton et al.
2013; Smith et al. 2013; Volkert et al. 2013; Goldner et al.
2014; Molyneaux et al. 2014; Swets et al. 2014; Marrie
et al. 2015). The measure of “total” or “any anxiety” is
not clinically meaningful and is discouraged in favor of
the assessment of individual disorders (Smith et al. 2013;
Tully and Cosh 2013). Consensus on definitions used to
define study samples (e.g., sexual orientation) (King et al.
2008; Fischer et al. 2012; Ho et al. 2014) and diagnostic
standardization with respect to the measurement of psy-
chiatric disorders were also emphasized (Monastero et al.
2009; Goldner et al. 2014; Swets et al. 2014), as well as
research into the risk factors, illness trajectory, hereditary,
and biological markers of anxiety (Somers et al. 2006;
Davydow et al. 2008; Monastero et al. 2009; Chen et al.
2010; Dokras et al. 2012; Russell et al. 2013; Amerio et al.
2014; Ho et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014), and the appro-
priateness of anxiety screening measures in the context of
physical diseases and cultures around the world (who
may express distress differently) (Fazel et al. 2005; Bryant
et al. 2008; Sawyer et al. 2010; Baxter et al. 2013; Hawton
et al. 2013; Steel et al. 2014). Research questions should
be structured around theories (Arden-Close et al. 2008;
Webster et al. 2012). Recommendations were made for
the inclusion of appropriate control subjects in studies to
determine whether prevalence differs between exposed
and comparison groups (Yang et al. 2013; Dawson et al.
2014). Finally, further treatment or intervention studies
are needed to alleviate anxiety (Mirza and Jenkins 2004;
Murtagh et al. 2007; Arden-Close et al. 2008; Clarke and
Currie 2009; Fatseas et al. 2010; Lim et al. 2011; Amerio
et al. 2014; Goldner et al. 2014; Haller et al. 2014; Ho
et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014; Swets et al. 2014).
Clinical recommendations included the administration
of targeted anxiety screening and, if necessary, treatment.
For example, suggestions were made for the screening of
substance users at treatment entry (Fatseas et al. 2010) or
patients with noncardiac chest pain presenting to acute
care (Webster et al. 2012). It was also shown that certain
anxiety disorders were more common in certain groups,
such as OCD in schizophrenia (Swets et al. 2014), PD
and GAD in CVD (Campbell Burton et al. 2013), and SP
in diabetes (Grigsby et al. 2002). Additional research on
individual anxiety disorders is needed to confirm these
findings, but once this is underway, further impetus will
be provided for the targeted screening of high-risk groups
in relation to individual anxiety disorders.
This review has some limitations. Despite extensive
database searches, it is possible that some reviews have
been missed. Also, the high heterogeneity in anxiety
assessment methods and sampling frameworks within pri-
mary studies contributed to large differences in prevalence
estimates within and across reviews, making it difficult to
draw conclusions about the burden of anxiety. Also, a
number of the reviews were based on English-language
studies conducted in predominantly Western settings,
making generalizability to other parts of the world
difficult.
Conclusions
Anxiety disorders are increasingly being recognized as
important determinants of poor health and major con-
tributors to health service use across the globe (Nutt and
Ballenger 2003; Simpson et al. 2010). Despite epidemio-
logic advances in this field, important areas of research
remain under- or unexplored. There is a need for further
studies on the prevalence of anxiety disorders in the con-
text of: personality disorders; Indigenous cultures in
Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia;
African, Middle Eastern, Eastern European, Asian and
South American countries; and marginalized populations,
such as injection drug users, street youth, and sex work-
ers. These recommendations can serve to guide the
research agenda, and most importantly, help develop tai-
lored and timely interventions.
