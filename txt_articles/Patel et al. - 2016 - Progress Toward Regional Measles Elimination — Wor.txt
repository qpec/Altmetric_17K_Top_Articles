Adopted in 2000, United Nations Millennium Development 
Goal 4 set a target to reduce child mortality by two thirds by 
2015, with measles vaccination coverage as one of the progress 
indicators. In 2010, the World Health Assembly (WHA) set three 
milestones for measles control by 2015: 1) increase routine cov-
erage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) 
for children aged 1 year to ≥90% nationally and ≥80% in every 
district; 2) reduce global annual measles incidence to <5 cases per 
1 million population; and 3) reduce global measles mortality by 
95% from the 2000 estimate (1,2).* In 2012, WHA endorsed 
the Global Vaccine Action Plan† with the objective to eliminate 
measles in four World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 
2015. Countries in all six WHO regions have adopted measles 
elimination goals. Measles elimination is the absence of endemic 
measles transmission in a region or other defined geographical area 
for ≥12 months in the presence of a well performing surveillance 
system. This report updates a previous report (3) and describes 
progress toward global measles control milestones and regional 
measles elimination goals during 2000–2015. During this period, 
annual reported measles incidence decreased 75%, from 146 to 36 
cases per 1 million persons, and annual estimated measles deaths 
decreased 79%, from 651,600 to 134,200. However, none of the 
2015 milestones or elimination goals were met. Countries and 
their partners need to act urgently to secure political commit-
ment, raise the visibility of measles, increase vaccination coverage, 
strengthen surveillance, and mitigate the threat of decreasing 
resources for immunization once polio eradication is achieved.
Immunization Activities
To estimate coverage with MCV1 and the second dose of 
measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine immu-
nization services,§ WHO and the United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF) use data from administrative records and sur-
veys reported annually by 194 countries. During 2000–2015, 
estimated MCV1 coverage increased globally from 72% to 
85%, although coverage has not increased since 2009. The 
number of countries with ≥90% MCV1 coverage increased 
from 84 (44%) in 2000 to 129 (66%) in 2012, but then 
declined to 119 (61%) in 2015. Since 2003, countries also have 
reported the number of districts with ≥80% MCV1 coverage. 
Among countries with ≥90% MCV1 coverage nationally, the 
percentage with ≥80% MCV1 coverage reported in all districts 
increased from 2% of countries (one of 43) in 2003 to 44% 
(57 of 129) in 2012 and then declined to 39% (47 of 119) 
in 2015. Among the estimated 20.8 million infants who did 
not receive MCV1 through routine immunization services in 
2015, approximately 11 million (53%) were in six countries: 
India (3.2 million), Nigeria (3 million), Pakistan (2 million), 
Indonesia (1.5 million), Ethiopia (0.7 million), and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.6 million).
During 2000–2015, the number of countries providing 
MCV2 nationally through routine immunization services 
increased from 97 (51%) to 160 (82%), with six countries 
(Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Sierra Leone, and 
Zimbabwe) introducing MCV2 in 2015. Estimated global 
MCV2 coverage increased from 15% in 2000 to 61% in 2015. 
During 2015, approximately 184 million persons received 
MCV during mass immunization campaigns known as supple-
mentary immunization activities (SIAs)¶ implemented in 41 
countries, with 32 (78%) providing one or more additional 
child health interventions during the SIA (Table 1). Based 
on doses administered, SIA coverage was ≥95% in 21 (51%) 
countries; however, among the four countries conducting post-
SIA coverage surveys, only one estimated coverage at ≥95%.
* The coverage milestone is to be met by every country, whereas the incidence 
and mortality reduction milestones are to be met globally.
† The Global Vaccine Action Plan is the implementation plan of the Decade of 
Vaccines, a collaboration between WHO, UNICEF
, the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the African 
Leaders Malaria Alliance, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and others to extend the full 
benefit of immunization to all persons by 2020 and beyond. In addition to 2015 
targets, it also set a target for measles and rubella elimination in five of the six WHO 
regions by 2020. http://www.who.int/immunization/global_vaccine_action_plan/
en and http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/wha65/a65_22-en.pdf.
§ For MCV1, among children aged 1 year or, if MCV1 is given at age ≥1 year, 
among children aged 24 months. For MCV2, among children at the recommended 
age of administration of MCV2, per the national immunization schedule. WHO/
UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage are available at http://
www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/en.
¶ Supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) generally are carried out using 
two target age ranges. An initial, nationwide catch-up SIA focuses on all children 
aged 9 months–14 years, with the goal of eliminating susceptibility to measles 
in the general population. Periodic follow-up SIAs then focus on all children 
born since the last SIA. Follow-up SIAs generally are conducted nationwide 
every 2–4 years and focus on children aged 9–59 months; their goal is to 
eliminate any measles susceptibility that has developed in recent birth cohorts 
and to protect children who did not respond to MCV1.

 †† Measles cases are defined differently in different countries. Some countries 
define measles cases as those that are laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically 
confirmed; others define measles cases as those that are laboratory-confirmed, 
epidemiologically confirmed, or clinically compatible. Laboratory-confirmed 
cases are suspected measles cases with specimens with detectable measles 
virus-specific immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies, or specimens from 
which measles virus can be isolated or measles virus genome can be detected 
in appropriate clinical specimens by a proficient laboratory. Epidemiologically 
linked confirmed measles cases are suspected measles cases that have not 
been confirmed by a laboratory but are geographically and temporally related 
to a laboratory-confirmed case or, in the event of a chain of transmission, 
to another epidemiologically confirmed measles case, with dates of rash onset 
between cases occurring 7–21 days apart. Clinically compatible measles cases 
are suspected measles cases with fever and maculopapular rash and cough, 
coryza, or conjunctivitis, for which no adequate clinical specimen was 
collected and which have not been linked epidemiologically to a laboratory-
confirmed case of measles or to a laboratory-confirmed case of another 
communicable disease.
 §§ A case-based surveillance system is defined as one that collects information 
about each case at the individual level; in the case of measles, effective case-
based surveillance includes confirmatory laboratory testing.
 ¶¶ Countries without case-based measles surveillance in 2015 were Mauritius, 
Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, and Somalia.
 *** Countries without access to standardized quality-controlled testing by the WHO 
Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network in 2015 were Cape Verde, Sao Tome 
and Principe, and Seychelles.
 ††† A discarded case is defined as a suspected case that has been investigated and 
discarded as nonmeasles using 1) laboratory testing in a proficient laboratory or 
2) epidemiological linkage to a laboratory-confirmed outbreak of a communicable 
disease that is not measles. The discarded case rate is used to measure the sensitivity 
of measles surveillance.
 §§§ Countries not reporting in 2013 were Cuba (AMR); Bahrain, Libya, and the 
United Arab Emirates (EMR); Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Malta, 
Monaco, San Marino, and Ukraine (EUR); and Brunei Darussalam, Cook Islands, 
Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Samoa, and T
uvalu (WPR). In 2015, member 
states not reporting were Mauritius (AFR); El Salvador and the United States of 
America (AMR); Libya (EMR); Albania, Andorra, Finland, Greece, Monaco, 
Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and San Marino (EUR); Indonesia 
(SEAR); and Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, 
Singapore, Tonga, and T
uvalu (WPR). Delays in reporting could affect 2015 data.
Disease Incidence
Countries report the number of measles cases**,†† from either 
case-based§§ or aggregate surveillance systems to WHO and 
UNICEF annually. In 2015, 189 (97%)¶¶ countries conducted 
case-based surveillance in at least part of the country, and 191 
(98%)*** had access to standardized quality-controlled testing 
through the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory 
Network. However, surveillance is weak in many countries, and 
43% did not achieve the sensitivity indicator of reporting ≥2 
discarded measles††† cases per 100,000 population
During 2000–2015, the number of measles cases reported 
annually worldwide decreased 70%, from 853,479 to 254,928, 
and measles incidence decreased 75%, from 146 to 36 cases per 
1 million population (Table 2). During 2013–2015, incidence 
declined from 40 to 36 per 1 million, although fewer countries 
reported case data in 2015 (169) than did in 2013 (176).§§§ 
The percentage of reporting countries with an incidence of 
<5 cases per 1 million increased from 38% (64 of 169) in 2000 
See table footnotes on next page.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to 58% (98 of 168) in 2014, and to 65% (109 of 169) in 2015. 
During 2000–2015, the Region of the Americas (AMR) main-
tained measles incidence of <5 cases per 1 million.
From 2014 to 2015, the number of reported measles cases 
increased 33% in the African Region (AFR), 18% in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region (EMR), and 83% in the European 
Region (EUR), primarily because of outbreaks in several coun-
tries. There was minimal change in reported cases in the South-
East Asia Region (SEAR), and reported cases decreased 78% in 
AMR, with interruption of outbreaks in Brazil, Canada, and the 
United States. In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), reported 
measles cases declined 50%, with decreases in the three most 
populous countries in the region: China, the Philippines, and 
Vietnam (Table 2).
Genotypes of viruses isolated from measles cases were reported 
by 80 (51%) of the 157 countries that reported measles cases 
in 2015. Among the 24 recognized measles virus genotypes, 11 
were detected during 2005–2008, eight during 2009–2014, and 
six during 2015, excluding those from vaccine reactions and 
cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a fatal progressive 
neurologic disorder caused by persistent measles infection¶¶¶ 
(4). In 2015, among 8,076 reported measles virus sequences,**** 
847 (from 48 countries) were genotype B3; 70 (10 countries) 
were D4; 1,801 (52 countries) were D8; 76 (10 countries) were 
D9; one was G3; and 5,281 (20 countries) were H1 (Table 1).
Disease and Mortality Estimates
A previously described model for estimating measles disease 
and mortality was updated with new measles vaccination cover-
age data, case data, and United Nations population estimates for 
all countries during 2000–2015, enabling a new series of disease 
and mortality estimates (5,6). According to the updated data, the 
estimated number of measles cases declined from 32,768,300 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 23,393,300–63,222,700) in 
2000 to 9,719,600 (CI = 5,731,800–35,451,000) in 2015. 
During this period, the number of estimated annual measles 
deaths decreased 79%, from 651,600 to 134,200 (Table 2). 
Compared with no measles vaccination, measles vaccination 
prevented an estimated 20.3 million deaths during 2000–2015 
(Figure).
Regional Verification of Measles Elimination
In September 2016, the AMR regional verification com-
mission declared the region free of endemic measles (7). The 
WPR regional verification commission reclassified Mongolia 
as having reestablished endemic measles virus transmission 
because of an outbreak that lasted for >1 year; thus, five WPR 
member states have been verified as having eliminated endemic 
measles (8). In 2015, the EUR regional verification commission 
verified measles elimination in 21 countries (9).
Discussion
During 2000–2015, increased coverage worldwide with 
routine doses of MCV, combined with SIAs, contributed 
to a 75% decrease in reported measles incidence and a 79% 
reduction in estimated measles mortality. During this period, 
measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.3 million 
deaths. Moreover, the number of countries with measles 
incidence <5 per million has increased, although there is a 
large amount of underreporting. The decreasing number of 
circulating measles virus genotypes suggests interruption of 
some chains of transmission. However, despite progress since 
2000, the 2015 global control milestones and regional measles 
elimination goals were not achieved and much effort is needed 
if elimination in five of six regions is to be achieved by 2020.

* SIAs generally are carried out using two approaches: 1) An initial, nationwide catch-up 
SIA targets all children aged 9 months to 14 years; it has the goal of eliminating 
susceptibility to measles in the general population. Periodic follow-up SIAs then target 
all children born since the last SIA. 2) Follow-up SIAs are generally conducted nationwide 
every 2–4 years and generally target children aged 9–59 months; their goal is to eliminate 
any measles susceptibility that has developed in recent birth cohorts and to protect 
children who did not respond to the first measles vaccination. The exact age range for 
follow-up SIAs depends on the age-specific incidence of measles, coverage with 1 dose 
of measles-containing vaccine, and the time since the last SIA.
† Values >100% indicate that the intervention reached more persons than the estimated 
target population.

increase their commitment for additional financial and human 
resources to 1) enable public education on the importance of 
vaccination; 2) strengthen health systems with staff, outreach 
services, and access to reliable vaccine supply to deliver 2 doses 
of measles vaccine; 3) improve surveillance; and 4) invest in 
research and innovations to overcome hurdles to achieving 
high vaccination coverage.
The 2015 global control milestones and regional measles 
elimination goals were not met because vaccination cover-
age gaps persist. Globally, MCV1 coverage has stagnated at 
84%–85% since 2009 and MCV2 coverage only reached 61% 
in 2015. SIA quality was inadequate to achieve ≥95% coverage

 * Mortality estimates for 2000 might be different from previous reports. When the model used to generate estimated measles deaths is rerun each year using the 
new WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) data, as well as updated surveillance data, adjusted results for each year, including the 
baseline year, are also produced and updated.

cases and estimated deaths.

in the majority of countries. Furthermore, the discrepancy 
between high SIA coverage reported by administrative methods 
and lower coverage found by a limited number of post-SIA 
coverage surveys indicates that SIA quality might also be inad-
equate in countries with high reported administrative cover-
age. Countries need to allocate more time for early planning 
and preparation for high-quality immunization campaigns, 
with careful assessment of pre-SIA readiness, well-conducted 
intra-campaign and postcampaign monitoring, and proper 
implementation of appropriately budgeted activities to vac-
cinate persons missed during the SIA.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, SIA coverage data might be biased by inaccurate 
reports of the number of doses delivered, doses administered 
to children outside the target age group, and inaccurate esti-
mates of the target population size. Second, there are large 
differences between the estimated and reported incidence, 
indicating variable surveillance sensitivity, making compari-
sons difficult; in addition, not all ill persons seek care. Finally, 
misclassification might occur for reported cases that are not 
laboratory-confirmed or in countries that report aggregate 
numbers of unconfirmed cases rather than case-based data 
for confirmed cases.
The decrease in measles mortality is one of four main con-
tributors (the others are decrease in mortality from diarrhea, 
malaria, and pneumonia) to the decline in overall child mortal-
ity worldwide and progress toward Millennium Development 
Goal 4, but continued work is needed to help achieve regional 
elimination (10). Of serious concern is the possibility that the 
gains made so far and future progress in measles control and 
elimination could be threatened if polio-funded resources that 
support routine immunization services, measles SIAs, and 
measles surveillance activities diminish or disappear following 
polio eradication. Those countries with the highest measles

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
During 2000–2010, global vaccination coverage with the first 
dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) increased from 72% 
to 85%, and annual measles incidence decreased from 146 
reported cases per 1 million population to 50 cases per 1 million.
What is added by this report?
During 2000–2015, an estimated 20.3 million deaths were 
prevented by measles vaccination, and measles incidence 
decreased 75%, from 146 to 36 cases per 1 million population. 
The number of countries providing the second dose of 
measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) nationally through routine 
immunization services increased to 160 (82%) in 2015, and 
global MCV2 coverage was 61%. In 2015, a total of 184 million 
persons were vaccinated against measles during supplemen-
tary immunization activities. Although measles vaccination has 
saved millions of lives since 2000, data indicate that the 
progress toward elimination goals has slowed since 2010.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Reaching measles control and elimination goals will require 
addressing policy and practice gaps that prevent reaching 
larger numbers of children with measles vaccination, increasing 
visibility of measles elimination efforts, assuring funding as 
polio funding decreases, and ensuring adequate resources for 
strengthening health systems.

mortality rely most heavily on polio-funded resources and are at 
highest risk if these resources are not transitioned to adequately 
support other parts of the immunization program after polio 
eradication is achieved. Countries and partners need to act 
urgently to secure political commitment, raise the visibility of 
measles, increase vaccination coverage, strengthen surveillance, 
and mitigate the threat of resources for immunization programs 
decreasing once polio eradication is achieved.
