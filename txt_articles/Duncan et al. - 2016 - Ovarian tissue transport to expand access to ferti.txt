Abstract
Primordial follicles dictate a female’s reproductive life span and therefore are central to fertility preservation for both endangered 
species and individuals with fertility-threatening conditions. Ovarian tissue containing primordial follicles can be cryopreserved and 
later thawed and transplanted back into individuals to restore both endocrine function and fertility. Importantly, increasing numbers 
of human live births have been reported following ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation. A current limitation of this 
technology is patient access to sites that are approved or equipped to process and cryopreserve ovarian tissue – especially in larger 
countries or low resource settings. Here, we review empirical evidence from both animal models and human studies that suggest that 
ovarian tissue can be transported at cold temperatures for several hours while still maintaining the integrity and reproductive 
potential of the primordial follicles within the tissue. In fact, several human live births have been reported in European countries 
using tissue that was transported at cold temperatures for up to 20 
h before cryopreservation and transplantation. Ovarian tissue 
transport, if implemented widely in clinical practice, could therefore expand both patient and provider access to emerging fertility 
preservation options.

Introduction
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy, although used 
successfully to treat a myriad of malignant and non-
malignant conditions, can have the unintended long-
term consequence of damaging reproductive function 
(Lobo 2005, Meirow et al. 2005, Jeruss & Woodruff 
2009, Woodruff 2010, Hirshfeld-Cytron et al. 2011, 
De Vos et al. 2014, Wallace et al. 2014). In females, 
these treatments can negatively affect several aspects of 
the reproductive system, including the hypothalamic–
pituitary–gonadal axis, the ovary and the uterus (Gracia 
& Woodruff 2012, Duncan et al. 2014). Impaired 
reproductive function can ultimately result in infertility, 
sterility and other outcomes, including depression, 
psychological disorders and sexuality issues (Canada & 
Schover 
2012, 
Gracia 
& 
Woodruff 
2012, 
Lewis 
et 
al. 
2012, 
Chambers et al. 2013, Milbury et al. 2013, Lawson et al. 
2014, Morrow et al. 2014, Levine et al. 2015). To avoid 
 
some of these consequences, fertility preservation 
strategies have been developed and are being 
implemented in clinical practice (Waimey et al. 2013, 
De Vos et al. 2014).
The American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine 
(ASRM), along with the American Academy of Pediatrics 
and the European Society of Human Reproduction and 
Embryology (ESHRE), have all recognized the need to 
address the potential threat of gonadotoxic treatments 
to fertility, each assembling expert committees and 
publishing guidance documents emphasizing the need 
for consultation at the time of diagnosis and rapid referral 
of patients to reproductive endocrinology and infertility 
specialists (Ethics Committee of American Society 
for Reproductive Medicine 2013, Loren et al. 2013). 
To date, female fertility preservation options that are 
recognized by ASCO and the ASRM/ESHRE are limited 
to embryo and egg cryopreservation (Ethics Committee 
of American Society for Reproductive Medicine 2013, 
Loren et al. 2013). Although these assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) procedures are successful, they may 
not be available to all patients. For example, embryo 
and egg freezing are not possible or are contraindicated 
in prepubertal females or those who cannot delay 
treatment for their primary condition (Jeruss & Woodruff 
2009). For these patients, one experimental fertility 
preservation option is ovarian tissue cryopreservation 
(OTC) (Backhus et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2014, De Vos 
et al. 2014, Dolmans et al. 2014, Ross et al. 2014,

Stoop et al. 2014, Suzuki et al. 2015). OTC involves the 
removal of a whole ovary or cortical biopsies that are 
then cryopreserved by either slow freezing or vitrification 
(Rosendahl et al. 2011, Ting et al. 2013, Suzuki et al. 
2015). This tissue can be thawed at a later date and used 
to restore reproductive function (Backhus et al. 2007, 
Chen et al. 2014, De Vos et al. 2014, Dolmans et al. 
2014, Ross et al. 2014, Stoop et al. 2014). OTC followed 
by orthotopic or heterotopic transplantation has resulted 
in restoration of endocrine function and fertility, with 
at least 60 live human births reported to date (Smitz 
et al. 2010, Gamzatova et al. 2014, Dittrich et al. 2015, 
Donnez & Dolmans 2015). Although OTC and ovarian 
tissue transplantation have resulted in live human births, 
this technology is still considered investigational and 
may be associated with a reintroduction of the cancer 
the patient has just survived. As with all experimental 
technologies, this procedure can only be performed 
under appropriate ethical protocols.
Despite the investigational designation of OTC, there 
has been an upward trend in the interest in and use of 
this technology. In the USA, the National Physicians 
Cooperative (NPC), which is part of the Oncofertility 
Consortium, is a nationwide infrastructure of clinical and 
allied sites committed to providing personalized fertility 
preservation care (Gracia & Woodruff 2012, Gracia 
et al. 2012) (http://www.oncofertility.northwestern.
edu/health-professionals/npc-membership-info-and-
npc-resources). Several NPC sites offer OTC under 
institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols, 
and the number of OTC cases reported through the 
NPC has increased steadily in the past decade (Duncan 
et al. 2015). Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, 
the largest increase in the use of OTC in the NPC has 
occurred in the pediatric and young adult population, 
potentially because of increased awareness about this 
option and the expanding list of medical conditions 
and treatments that can compromise fertility (Hirshfeld-
Cytron et al. 2011, Duncan et al. 2015).
The ability to perform OTC requires trained staff, 
specialized equipment, designated space and time 
to prepare the ovarian cortex and to freeze it using 
specified protocols (Backhus et al. 2007, American 
Society for Reproductive Medicine 2014). Because of 
these requirements, the number of clinical sites that 
offer OTC for fertility preservation remains low. One 
approach to increasing patient access to OTC is to 
facilitate efficient ovarian tissue transport. The concept 
of preserving organ viability during transport has been 
instrumental for life-saving transplantation of organs, 
including kidneys, liver, pancreas, lungs and heart. The 
most common organ preservation technique for transport 
is induced hypothermia to approximately 4°C (Cantu & 
Zaas 2011). Hypothermia suppresses metabolism and 
catabolic enzymes, such that with each 10°C drop in 
temperature, the metabolic rate is halved (Cantu & Zaas 
2011). As a result, at 4°C, the remaining metabolic rate 
is approximately 10% of normal (Cantu & Zaas 2011). 
The lower metabolic rate reduces mitochondrial enzyme 
activity, which in turn reduces the accumulation of 
lactic acid and slows down the decrease in intracellular 
pH, proteolysis, lipolysis and lipid peroxidation 
associated with ischemia (Guibert et al. 2011). Induced 
hypothermia protects organs from damage while they 
are removed from the blood supply, but perhaps not 
surprisingly, the maximum time of preservation at cold 
temperatures varies depending on the specific organ 
(Guibert et al. 2011). Specifically, the heart (6 
h) and the 
lungs (8 
h) have the lowest tolerance for cold ischemia, 
whereas the liver (12–15 
h) and kidneys (24 
h) have the 
highest (Guibert et al. 2011).
Ovarian transplantation as a clinical concept has 
been in existence since the late 1800s; yet, it has lagged 
behind other organ systems (Rodriguez & Campo-
Engelstein 2011). Although cold storage transport is 
used widely for kidneys, liver, pancreas, lungs and 
heart, it is not yet standard of care for ovaries in the 
setting of fertility preservation. However, two European 
countries – first Denmark and subsequently Germany – 
have successfully pioneered the clinical use of ovarian 
tissue transport (Dittrich et al. 2012, 2015, Muller 
et al. 2012, Bastings et al. 2014, Jensen et al. 2015). 
They describe this model, which has been ongoing for 
10 
years, as ‘the woman stays – the tissue moves’ (Jensen 
et al. 2015). In this process, ovarian tissue is removed 
and prepared at a local hospital and then transported to 
an approved site where the cryopreservation procedure 
is performed. Following cryopreservation, the tissue is 
stored for the individual’s future use. Ovarian tissue 
transport is particularly challenging because there are 
several structures and cell types within the tissue that 
need to be maintained in a healthy state. The ovarian 
cortex is of particular interest because it is enriched in 
primordial follicles, which comprise a female’s ovarian 
reserve and dictate her reproductive life span (Schmidt 
et al. 2003a). Once the thawed tissue is transplanted, 
it is these dormant follicles that will eventually grow, 
produce hormones and restore reproductive function 
and fertility. The success of clinical ovarian tissue 
transport in Europe demonstrates that cold storage of 
ovarian tissue is efficacious.
Integrating ovarian tissue transport into fertility 
preservation protocols would expand access to OTC by 
allowing remote or small clinical practices that may not 
have resources or staff, the ability to offer this option 
to their patients. This is especially important in large 
countries and/or in low resource settings. Additionally, 
some patients may not have the time to delay treatment 
for their primary condition in order to travel to a site 
that offers OTC, or they may not want to seek fertility 
preservation at a different and/or distant institution. 
Ovarian tissue transport would overcome these barriers 
and expand the fertility preservation options available 
to these patients. In this review, we highlight the

current status of ovarian tissue transport, first discussing 
research findings in domestic animals and preclinical 
studies with human tissue, and then presenting clinical 
results documenting live births following ovarian tissue 
transport, OTC and transplantation of the thawed tissue. 
Taken together, there is strong empirical evidence 
supporting the safe and efficient use of ovarian tissue 
transport for fertility preservation. 
Evidence from animal studies
The mouse is a critical research model, and recently, a 
comprehensive study was performed that interrogated 
the effect of storage temperature and duration on 
ovarian tissue function (Kamoshita et al. 2016). Storage 
at 4°C for up to 24 
h did not significantly affect the 
histological morphology of the tissue or the number 
of mature gametes that could be collected or fertilized 
post-orthotopic transplantation (Kamoshita et al. 2016). 
However, cold storage did significantly reduce the 
incidence of implantation and live offspring (Kamoshita 
et al. 2016). The findings from this mouse study, while 
important, should be interpreted with caution because 
the mouse ovary is fundamentally different from ovaries 
in large mammalian species – especially in terms of 
architecture and size.
Studies on large animal models have demonstrated 
that the transport of ovarian tissue is possible without 
harming the pool of primordial follicles (Baird et al. 
1999, 2004, Onions et al. 2008, Alves et al. 2015, 
Salih et al. 2015). Although the majority of studies 
focus on the health of fully grown oocytes as an 
end point of ovarian tissue transport (see section on 
‘Effect of ovarian tissue transport on oocytes from 
antral follicles’), some have analyzed the effect of 
the transport time and temperature specifically on the 
population of preantral follicles (Silva et al. 2000, Lucci 
et al. 2004, Lopes et al. 2009, Lima et al. 2010, Gomes 
et al. 2012). For example, in goats, transport of ovarian 
tissue at 4°C for up to 24 h maintained morphologically 
normal primordial follicles (Silva et al. 2000). Once the 
temperature was increased to 20°C or 39°C, or the time 
was extended past 24 h, however, there was a significant 
loss of primordial follicles (Silva et al. 2000). These 
results are consistent with work done on zebu cow 
ovaries. When ovarian tissue was stored at 4°C for up to 
18 h, more than 90% of the preantral follicles exhibited 
normal structure and morphology (Lucci et al. 2004). 
When the ovarian tissue was stored at 20°C and for 
longer than 6 h, the morphology of preantral follicles in 
the ovarian tissue significantly diminished (Lucci et al. 
2004). In the canine model, one study concluded that 
ovarian storage at 4°C for up to 12 h provides optimal 
preservation conditions for preantral follicles and 
ensures the maintenance of morphology and viability 
of these follicles (Lopes et al. 2009). This observation 
is supported by another study that found that when 
ovarian tissue was held between 3°C and 9°C, more 
than 80% of the primordial follicles appeared normal 
and viable. After 36 h at these temperatures, however, 
only 59.8% of the primordial follicles survived (Lima 
et al. 2010). More recently, a study with equine 
ovarian tissue concluded that increasing the time and 
temperature of tissue transport significantly reduced 
the percentage of morphologically normal follicles 
(Gomes et al. 2012). The greatest percentage of viable 
follicles was found in equine ovarian tissue that was 
transported at 4°C for 4 h.
Ongoing work through the NPC is consistent with this 
published data in large animal models. For example, we 
have examined the transport of bovine, feline and canine 
tissue at 4, 25 and 37°C for 24 
h. In each of the ovarian 
tissue types, our histological analysis found that the 
structure and morphology of primordial and preantral 
follicles were best maintained when the ovarian tissue 
was kept at 4 or 25°C (Figs 1 and 2). In our experience, 
antral follicles were compromised under all transport 
conditions as evidenced histologically by the disruption 
of the integrity of the cumulus–oocyte complex (COC) 
(Fig. 2; see section on ‘Effect of ovarian tissue transport 
on oocytes from antral follicles’).
Some of the most convincing evidence supporting 
the clinical use of ovarian tissue transport in the 
setting of fertility preservation comes from the non-
human primate model. A recent study determined 
that transport of primate ovarian tissue at 4°C for 
up to 24 h did not compromise the quality of the 
tissue or the health of the follicles (Hornick et al. 
2012). When compared with freshly fixed controls, 
morphology markers in the transported ovarian tissue 
were indistinguishable and there were no differences 
in the number of apoptotic cells (Hornick et al. 2012). 
In addition, follicles isolated from these transported 
tissues survived and grew in an encapsulated in 
vitro follicle growth (IVFG) system that recapitulates 
oogenesis and folliculogenesis, demonstrating the 
functionality of these cells after transport (Hornick 
et al. 2012). Thus taken together, there was better 
preservation of primordial follicles than of developing 
follicles at colder temperatures in ovarian tissue from 
most large animal models. Because the majority of 
primordial follicles are presumably quiescent, it is 
possible that they may be less affected by the reduced 
cellular metabolism rate at cooler temperatures (Silva 
et al. 2000, Gomes et al. 2012). In addition, the less 
complex cellular structure as well as the smaller 
oocyte volume may also contribute to the relative 
resilience of primordial follicle to cold temperatures.
Evidence from preclinical studies with human  
ovarian tissue

animal models have been replicated successfully with

human ovarian tissue by several groups (Schmidt et al. 
2003b, Isachenko et al. 2009, Laronda et al. 2014). 
The 
transport of human ovarian tissue at cold temperatures 
and within a period of 4–26 h maintains functional 
parameters of the tissue as assessed by morphology, 
viability and follicle development in vitro and in vivo 
(Schmidt et al. 2003b, Isachenko et al. 2009, Laronda 
et al. 2014). In one recent study, ovarian cortical tissue 
from 24 individuals was transported for up to 22 h at 
4°C, and cell quality and morphology were compared 
in histological and TUNEL analyses to pre-transport 
control tissue from the same individual (Laronda et al. 
2014). In more than half of the samples, the transported 
tissue was histologically similar to the freshly fixed 
control tissue, and TUNEL analysis demonstrated a 
similar percentage of apoptotic cells in the pre- and 
post-transport tissues. In some samples, significantly 
more TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the 
post-transport tissue compared with freshly fixed 
control tissue. These TUNEL-positive cells, however, 
were primarily constrained to the edge of the tissue. 
Preantral follicles at the secondary follicle stage 
isolated from this transported human ovarian tissue 
were able to survive and grow to the antral stage 
in culture and to develop with normal morphology 
(Laronda et al. 2014).
The findings from the study by Laronda et al. (2014) 
are consistent with another study that also evaluated 
the quality of transported human ovarian tissue using 
an IVFG assay (Isachenko et al. 2009). In that study, 
storage of ovarian cortical fragments at suprazero 
temperatures for up to 26 
h did not compromise the 
in vitro development of follicles during subsequent 
culture of intact tissue pieces (Isachenko et al. 2009). 
Interestingly, the storage of human ovarian cortex at 5°C 
for 24 
h before cryopreservation increased the viability 
of the follicles after thawing as assessed by culture in 
the chorioallantoic membrane system followed by 
immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation marker 
expression within the cultured tissue (Isachenko et al. 
2013). Immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian tissue 
after 24 
h at 5°C also showed that neovascularization 
was increased compared with non-cooled control tissue, 
which is important because this process is critical for 
implantation and function of transplanted ovarian tissue 
(Isachenko et al. 2012). The physiological basis for these 
phenomena, however, is unclear. Moreover, without 
evaluation of the number and viability of follicles as 
Figure 1 Ovarian tissue transport at colder temperatures maintains primordial follicle morphology in multiple species. Bovine (A–D), canine 
(E–H) and feline (I–L) ovarian tissue was harvested from individual animals and divided. One piece of tissue was fixed immediately upon organ 
removal (A, E and I), and the remaining pieces were transported at 4°C (B, F and J), 25°C (C, G, K) and 37°C (D, H and L) for 24 
h. In this 
manner, the only variable was transport temperature. Following transport, the ovarian tissue was fixed and the morphology of the primordial 
follicles within the ovarian cortex was examined by standard histological evaluation by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Primordial follicle 
integrity was compromised in all species following transport at 37°C. However, primordial follicles at both 4 and 25°C looked similar to fresh 
fixed controls. These experiments were repeated a minimum of three times and representative images are shown. Scale bar

well as the extent of vascularization in the tissue pieces 
before experimental manipulation, it is impossible to 
conclude whether cooling per se had a significant effect 
on these parameters.
Reports of consistent histology and IVFG following 
transport are robustly supported by the successful 
xenotransplantation of human ovarian tissue that was 
transported before cryopreservation (Schmidt et al. 
2003b). Following transport on ice for approximately 
4 
h, ovarian tissue was cryopreserved, then thawed 
and xenotransplanted into a mouse. After 4 
weeks, 
each of the transplanted pieces of ovarian tissue was 
recovered and found to contain healthy follicles at the 
primordial, primary and secondary stages (Schmidt 
et al. 2003b). This work is of particular significance 
because it demonstrates the function of the transported, 
cryopreserved, thawed and transplanted tissue in an 
in vivo model. Taken together, this research demonstrates 
that transport of human ovarian tissue at or around 
4°C before cryopreservation maintains the primordial 
follicle pool and may even have a positive effect on the 
subsequent growth and development of the follicles 
within the tissue (Schmidt et al. 2003b, Isachenko et al. 
2013, Laronda et al. 2014).
Clinical studies
The strongest unequivocal support of the safety and 
efficacy of ovarian tissue transport are the live births that 
have been reported after transplantation of transported 
ovarian tissue. Transplantation of ovarian tissue has led 
to at least 60 live births to date, and several of these 
were achieved after transplantation of ovarian tissue that 
was transported for up to 22 
h before cryopreservation 
(Andersen et al. 2008, Ernst et al. 2010, Rosendahl 
et al. 2011, Dittrich et al. 2012, Muller et al. 2012, 
Dittrich et al. 2015, Donnez & Dolmans 2015, Jensen 
et al. 2015). These cases indicate that transport before 
cryopreservation does not compromise the functional 
potential of the tissue. Moreover, these reports 
demonstrate that (1) live births can be obtained following 
cold tissue transport at 4°C, (2) tissue can be transported 
up to 20 
h and remain viable and (3) multiple live births 
can be obtained from the same tissue.
In several European countries, primarily Denmark and 
Germany, ovarian tissue transport has been combined 
with OTC and transplantation with successful clinical 
outcomes. In Denmark, OTC is only performed at the 
Laboratory of Reproductive Biology at Copenhagen

to fresh fixed controls. Antral follicles did not appear to tolerate any transport conditions. This is highlighted in the feline sample where 
disruption of the cumulus layer surrounding the oocyte was evident following transport (J and K) but not in the control (I). These experiments 
were repeated a minimum of three times and representative images are shown. Scale bar

University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, which provides 
a centralized localization (Rosendahl et al. 2011). 
Ovaries removed from patients at other centers around 
the country must be placed on ice and transported by 
airfreight, train or car within 4–5 
h to the Copenhagen 
University Hospital for cryopreservation. As of 2015, 
this program performed 53 transplantations to 41 
patients over the course of 10 
years, and nine of these 
women had a tissue that was transported on ice before 
cryopreservation (Jensen et al. 2015). This group reports 
a pregnancy rate of ~30% using this technology, again 
supporting the combined use of ovarian tissue transport 
with OTC and transplantation (Jensen et al. 2015).
Two case reports from the Danish and German 
experiences are described in more detail below because 
they highlight the longevity and functionality of ovarian 
tissue grafts post-transport and illustrate the relative 
resistance of ovarian tissue to cold transport. In the first 
case from Denmark, a 27-year-old woman who had been 
diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma had undergone OTC 
for fertility preservation. The patient’s ovarian tissue was 
transported on ice for 5 
h and then cryopreserved for 
21 
months. For the ovarian transplantation procedure, 
tissue corresponding to approximately 15–20% of one 
entire ovary was transplanted into subperitoneal pockets 
in the patient’s parietal peritoneum (Andersen et al. 
2008, Ernst et al. 2010). This woman had two healthy 
girls from this tissue, making her the first patient to have 
two separate pregnancies and births resulting from a 
single OTC–autotransplantation procedure. At the time 
of OTC, the woman only had her right ovary because the 
left one had been removed previously due to a dermoid 
cyst. A part of the right ovary was removed for OTC. 
Although it is possible that the pregnancies resulted 
from residual ovarian tissue rather than the transplanted 
tissue, a biopsy of the remaining ovary was performed at 
the time of transplantation, and no follicles were found 
by histological examination.
In the second case from Germany, a live birth follow-
ing ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation 
was reported after 20 
h of cold transport, suggesting that 
the ovary is similar to the kidneys and liver in terms of 
its tolerance to cold temperatures (Dittrich et al. 2012, 
Guibert et al. 2011). In this case, a 25-year-old woman 
with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma had two-
thirds of the ovarian cortex from each ovary removed, 
and the tissue was transported at 5–8°C for 20 
h from 
Dresden University Hospital to the Reproductive 
Medicine Laboratory in Bonn for cryopreservation 
(Dittrich et al. 2012). After 5 
years of cryopreservation, 
the tissue was transplanted into a deep pouch of the 
peritoneum in the region of the broad ligament. The 
patient had a spontaneous pregnancy and delivered a 
healthy male (Dittrich et al. 2012). During the cesarean 
section, the research team stated that healthy follicles 
were clearly visible on the surface of the transplanted 
tissue (Muller et al. 2012). Further, biopsy samples 
taken from the transplanted ovarian tissue revealed 
numerous follicles in all stages of development. This 
histological analysis confirms the viability of ovarian 
tissue that had been transported up to 20 
h at 4°C before 
cryopreservation (Muller et al. 2012).
Thus, it is clear that in the short time that ovarian 
tissue transport protocols have been employed in 
Europe, there have been multiple live births following 
autotransplantation (Andersen et al. 2008, Ernst et al. 
2010, Rosendahl et al. 2011, Dittrich et al. 2012, 
Muller et al. 2012, Dittrich et al. 2015, Jensen et al. 
2015). These impressive clinical results illustrate 
the potential for integrating ovarian tissue transport 
before cryopreservation as a way to expand global 
access to OTC.
Effect of ovarian tissue transport on oocytes from  
antral follicles
The majority of this review has focused on ovarian 
tissue transport conditions that favor the preservation of 
preantral follicles. However, ovarian tissue also contains 
antral follicles at various stages of development. 
Cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) from both small 
and large antral follicles can be isolated directly from 
harvested ovarian tissue and matured in vitro to obtain 
mature gametes. In fact, COCs in the ovarian medulla 
are often released from antral follicles during cortical 
ovarian tissue processing for OTC and can be used for 
fertility preservation if they are from follicles that have 
reached adequate maturity and if they are of high quality 
(Revel et al. 2003, Duncan et al. 2012). Mature eggs 
derived from IVM can be cryopreserved or fertilized 
and then cryopreserved as embryos. In vitro maturation 
(IVM) is another promising fertility preservation option, 
and importantly, pregnancies and live births have been 
obtained using this method (Guzman et al. 2012, Chian 
et al. 2013, Segers et al. 2015, Uzelac et al. 2015).
In animal studies, the data regarding how well COCs 
withstand cold transport are not consistent. In one study, 
bovine ovaries were transported for 3–4 
h at 15, 25 and 
35°C; oocytes from the ovaries transported at 15°C 
had a higher developmental competence and lower 
apoptotic index compared with the other transport 
groups (Wang et al. 2010). In the canine model, oocytes 
obtained from ovaries transported for up to 4 
h at 4°C 
had a significantly higher MII maturation rate than those 
transported at 35–38°C (Tas et al. 2006). However, in 
another study, transport at 37°C for up to 8 
h resulted in 
the greatest oocyte viability, although this study did not 
directly compare outcomes with oocytes from ovarian 
tissue transported at 4°C (Hanna et al. 2008). Conflicting 
results regarding COC viability after ovarian tissue 
transport have been seen in other animal models as well. 
One study concluded that when equine ovaries were 
transported within 7 
h, temperature played no role in 
determining the developmental competence of retrieved

oocytes (Ribeiro et al. 2008), whereas another group 
reported that transport at 4°C for up to 4 
h was optimal 
for oocyte viability (Gomes et al. 2012). Experimental 
data from the feline model showed that oocytes from 
ovaries transported for up to 24 
h at 4°C were capable of 
producing blastocysts after in vitro fertilization (Wolfe & 
Wildt 1996, Naoi et al. 2007, Evecen et al. 2009). The 
effect of cooler transport temperatures was also seen in 
a study with Iberian red deer, which showed that ovarian 
transport for up to 12 
h at 5–8°C produced oocytes 
that had a higher embryonic cleavage rate than those 
transported at 20–25°C (Garcia-Alvarez et al. 2011).
In humans, the data be more conclusive that COCs do 
not withstand extended transport at cold temperatures 
well. Duncan et al. (2012) reported that although 
COCs can be isolated directly from fresh human 
ovarian tissue, there were no viable COCs recovered 
from tissue that had been transported for 22 
h at 4°C. 
Short-term transport before OTC has also been shown 
to significantly compromise the oocyte maturation rate 
(Wilken-Jensen et al. 2014). Cryopreserved ovarian 
tissue from a cohort of 61 patients (0–38 
years of age) 
from Denmark’s centralized cryopreservation program 
was examined; the tissue transport time for these samples 
was between 2 and 5 
h at 4°C. A total of 682 immature 
oocytes within cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) 
were collected; 11% of oocytes from non-transported 
tissue were successfully matured in vitro to the MII stage 
compared with 1.4 and 4.6% of oocytes from tissue that 
had been transported 2–3 
h and 4–5 
h respectively.
Taken together, these results suggest that there are 
species-specific 
and 
follicle 
class-dependent 
differences 
in optimal ovarian tissue transport conditions. For 
human ovarian tissue, cold temperatures favor the 
preservation of preantral follicles but may not be 
optimal for antral follicles.
Summary and future directions
In summary, critical advances have been made in 
ovarian tissue transport. Preclinical studies support 
the use of this technique in the setting of fertility 
preservation for both endangered species and patients 
with fertility-threatening conditions (Fig. 3). Studies are 
ongoing to further optimize ovarian tissue transport 
conditions. For example, in studies using sheep ovaries 
as a model, addition of anti-apoptotic agents in the 
transport, processing and cryopreservation media 
improved the quality of primordial follicles post-thaw 
as assessed by culture and histological evaluation 
(Henry et al. 2016). It is especially encouraging for the 
field of fertility preservation that multiple human live 
births have been reported following transplantation of 
transported ovarian tissue. This technique, should it be 
Figure 3 Schematic detailing how ovarian 
tissue transport integrates into clinical fertility 
preservation. Ovarian tissue transport would 
expand the fertility preservation options to 
those individuals who currently do not have 
access. Ovarian tissue that is removed as an 
entire organ or as a biopsy would be prepared 
into cortical strips upon harvesting and 
transported to an approved processing site. 
Upon arrival at the processing site, the ovarian 
tissue could be cryopreserved by slow freezing 
or vitrification methods. Following thawing, the 
ovarian tissue could be used for transplantation 
to restore endocrine function and/or fertility. 
Ovarian follicles could also be isolated from 
the thawed ovarian tissue and used for in vitro 
follicle growth (IVFG) to obtain mature eggs 
that can be used to generate embryos following 
in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection. Another option is that follicles could 
be isolated directly from the transported tissue 
without the need for tissue cryopreservation. 
These isolated follicles could be cryopreserved 
or used for IVFG.

implemented in clinical practice in larger countries or 
in those with limited resources, will increase the options 
for patients who are in geographic areas that lack an 
oncofertility program to have ovarian tissue preserved 
for their later use for transplantation or other emerging 
fertility preservation options (Fig 3).
