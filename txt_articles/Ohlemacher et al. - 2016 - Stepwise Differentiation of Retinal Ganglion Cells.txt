ABSTRACT
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem
cells, possess the unique ability to readily differentiate into any cell type of the body, including
cells of the retina. Although previous studies have demonstrated the ability to differentiate
hPSCs to a retinal lineage, the ability to derive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from hPSCs has
been complicated by the lack of specific markers with which to identify these cells from a pluri-
potent source. In the current study, the definitive identification of hPSC-derived RGCs was
accomplished by their directed, stepwise differentiation through an enriched retinal progenitor
intermediary, with resultant RGCs expressing a full complement of associated features and
proper functional characteristics. These results served as the basis for the establishment of
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with a genetically inherited form of glau-
coma, which results in damage and loss of RGCs. Patient-derived RGCs specifically exhibited a
dramatic increase in apoptosis, similar to the targeted loss of RGCs in glaucoma, which was sig-
nificantly rescued by the addition of candidate neuroprotective factors. Thus, the current study
serves to establish a method by which to definitively acquire and identify RGCs from hPSCs and
demonstrates the ability of hPSCs to serve as an effective in vitro model of disease progression.
Moreover, iPSC-derived RGCs can be utilized for future drug screening approaches to identify
targets
for
the
treatment
of
glaucoma
and
other
optic
neuropathies.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
The current study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the ability to differentiate
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to date. Due to a lack
of truly specific features, definitive identification of RGCs from other cell types with similar fea-
tures has proven difficult. The data presented details the ability to conclusively assign presump-
tive RGCs to the retinal lineage, with subsequent confirmation by morphological, phenotypic,
and functional approaches. Utilizing this ability to generate RGCs, induced pluripotent stem
cells were then derived from a patient with a genetically inherited form of glaucoma. These
cells exhibited an increased susceptibility to apoptosis specifically upon the acquisition of an
RGC fate, with subsequent approaches significantly rescuing this phenotype, underscoring the
potential for disease modeling and pharmacological screening applications.
INTRODUCTION
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer the
unique and unprecedented ability to study the
differentiation of specific cellular lineages, par-
ticularly at those stages of development that
would otherwise be inaccessible to investiga-
tion. As such, they have been demonstrated to
serve as powerful in vitro models for human
ontogenesis [1, 2]. When derived from specific
patient populations, human induced pluripo-
tent stem cells (iPSCs) are capable of serving
as in vitro models of disease progression
[3–8], effectively bridging the gap between
basic and translational research. Among the
diseases that may be effectively modeled with
iPSCs, those affecting the retina have been of
particular interest [4, 5, 9–11] as a number of
methods exist to derive all of the major cell
types of the retina [4, 12–20], and a relative
lack of effective treatments and cures exist for
many blinding disorders.

EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS/INDUCED
PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
 While many previous studies have focused upon the abil-
ity to derive and utilize retinal cells such as photoreceptors
and retinal pigment epithelium [4, 5, 12–21], retinal ganglion
cells (RGCs) have been largely overlooked to date. As the pro-
jection neurons of the retina, RGCs effectively serve as the
connection between the eye and the brain. Furthermore,
RGCs are the predominant affected cell type in a group of dis-
eases known as optic neuropathies, the most common of
which is glaucoma with a current incidence of over 60 million
individuals worldwide [22, 23]. Within the context of the ret-
ina, RGCs are often identified by the expression of a limited
set of markers that are specific to these cells. However, when
derived from a pluripotent cell source, these markers are no
longer specific for RGCs as they are expressed elsewhere in
the nervous system. To date, the detailed description and uti-
lization of hPSC-derived RGCs has been largely lacking likely
due to the shortage of reliable markers with which to defini-
tively identify these cells without the assurance of a retinal
lineage, although previous studies have demonstrated the
ability to derive cells with RGC-like characteristics [4, 12,
14–18, 24–28]. Thus, a systematic, detailed analysis of these
cells is warranted in order to serve as a comprehensive in
vitro model of RGC development, as well as the application of
patient-derived RGCs for disease modeling.
To this end, efforts were undertaken to comprehensively
detail the differentiation of RGCs, with subsequent application
of these approaches to a glaucoma patient-derived line of
iPSCs. Lines of hPSCs were directed to differentiate in a step-
wise fashion specifically toward a retinal lineage, and highly
enriched populations of retinal progenitor cells were readily
identified and isolated, yielding a highly purified population.
Upon further differentiation of these retinal progenitor cells,
presumptive RGCs were identifiable within a total of 40 days
of differentiation and were characterized for morphological,
phenotypic, and physiological features of native RGCs. These
cells were found to express all of the observed features associ-
ated with RGCs and importantly, the possibility was excluded
to have differentiated into alternate lineages bearing similar
phenotypic markers. Furthermore, hPSC-derived cells possessed
expected physiological properties of RGCs [29]. Following the
conclusive identification and characterization of hPSC-derived
RGCs, similar approaches were undertaken for iPSCs derived
from a glaucoma patient possessing an E50K mutation in the
Optineurin (OPTN) gene, responsible for some familial forms of
glaucoma [30–36]. These cells were differentiated to an RGC
fate, at which point their ability to serve as an in vitro model
for studies of disease progression and drug screening were
tested. The results of these studies support a role for hPSCs as
an effective in vitro model for human RGC development and
functionality, as well as for use in studies of cellular mecha-
nisms underlying disease progression in optic neuropathies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Maintenance of hPSCs
hPSCs were maintained as previously described [15, 17].
Briefly, three lines of control human pluripotent stem cells
(H9, H7 [37] and miPS2 [38]) were used, and three lines of
patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells from an OPTN
E50K patient were derived. All cell lines were maintained in
the pluripotent state with mTeSR1 medium (Stemcell Technol-
ogies,
Vancouver
Canada,
http://www.stemcell.com)
on
matrigel-coated six-well plates.
Cells were passaged upon
reaching confluency of approximately 70%. Areas of spontane-
ous differentiation were initially identified by their distinct
appearance and were mechanically removed. Colonies of
hPSCs were then enzymatically lifted with dispase (2 mg/ml)
for approximately 15 minutes and passaged at a ratio of 1:6
onto freshly-coated matrigel plates in mTeSR1 medium. Pas-
saging of hPSCs typically occurred every 4-5 days.
Differentiation of hPSCs
Differentiation of hPSCs to a retinal lineage was performed
with modifications to previously established protocols [15].
Briefly, embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated from undiffer-
entiated colonies of hPSCs by lifting adherent cultures with
dispase. EBs were gradually transitioned into Neural Induction
Medium
(NIM)
consisting
of
Dubelco’s
Modified
Eagle
Medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1), N2 supplement, Minimal Essential
Medium (MEM) nonessential amino acids and heparin (2 lg/
ml). After a total of 7 days of differentiation, EBs were plated
onto uncoated six-well plates and induced to adhere by the
addition of 10% FBS overnight. The next day, NIM was
replaced without FBS and medium was subsequently changed
every other day until day 16. At this point, cells were lifted
from plates by mechanical scraping or pipetting to dislodge
colonies and generate neurospheres in suspension cultures.
Neurospheres
were
maintained
in
Retinal
Differentiation
Medium consisting of DMEM/F12 (3:1), MEM nonessential
amino acids, B27 supplement, and antibiotics.
Medium was
replenished every 2-3 days thereafter until the desired day of
differentiation was reached. At this point, retinal neuro-
spheres were isolated according to previously established pro-
tocols [4, 15, 17, 18, 39] based upon morphological cues
exhibited by the neurospheres. As indicated in some experi-
ments, OPTN iPSC-derived neurospheres were treated with
either Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) (100 ng/mL)
or Pigment Epithelial-Derived Factor (PEDF) (100 ng/ml) from
day 50 to day 70 of differentiation. Neurospheres were either
harvested for RNA analysis, or partially dissociated with accu-
tase and plated onto poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated cover-
slips for immunocytochemical analysis.
Reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs
The generation of OPTN glaucoma patient iPSCs was per-
formed using mRNA reprogramming strategies as previously
described [40]. Synthetic mRNAs with a microRNA booster kit
(Stemgent, Lexington MA, http://www.stemgent.com) were
introduced into OPTN fibroblasts through the use of Stemfect
Transfection Reagent following manufacturers instructions.
mRNAs were transfected daily for a total of 14 days. Within
the first 20 days of reprogramming, some fibroblasts began to
lose their elongated morphology and displayed the typical
tightly packed morphology of iPS cell colonies. Individual colo-
nies of prospective iPSCs were identified, manually isolated,
and clonally expanded to yield lines of patient-specific iPSCs.
Newly established lines of iPSCs were maintained as described
above.

 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-
PCR)
RNA was isolated from retinal neurospheres using the Pico-
pure RNA Isolation Kit (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad CA, http://
www.lifetechnologies.com), with subsequent cDNA synthesis
achieved utilizing the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad, Her-
cules CA, http://www.bio-rad.com). PCR analysis was accom-
plished using Go-Taq PCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison WI,
http://www.promega.com),
while
qPCR
analysis
was
per-
formed with SybrGreen (Life Technologies). For RT-PCR experi-
ments, reactions were performed for 35 cycles and products
were run on 2% agarose gels. Primers for RT-PCR and qRT-
PCR analysis can be found in Supporting Information Tables 1
and 2.
Immunocytochemistry and Data Quantification
Samples were collected at indicated timepoints of differentia-
tion and plated on poly-L-orinithine and laminin-coated cover-
slips.
Cells
were
fixed
in
a
4%
paraformaldehyde
and
phosphate buffer (PBS) solution for 30 minutes. Alternatively,
neurospheres were processed for cryostat sectioning as indi-
cated. For this purpose, neurospheres were fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde and PBS for 45 minutes and then introduced
into a 20% sucrose solution in PBS for equilibration overnight
at 4 degrees. The following day, sucrose solution was aspi-
rated and changed to a 30% sucrose solution at 4 8C. Follow-
ing
equilibration,
neurospheres were embedded
in
OCT,
frozen in dry ice and stored at 280 8C until sectioning. Cryo-
stat sections were cut at a thickness of 10 microns and stored
at 280 8C until use for immunocytochemistry.
For immunostaining of both coverslips and cryostat slides,
samples were initially washed three times with PBS and per-
meabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Ten percentage of donkey serum in PBS was
used as a blocking agent for one hour at room temperature
and primary antibodies (Supporting Information Table 3) were
applied in a solution consisting of 5% donkey serum and 0.1%
Triton X-100 overnight at 4 8C. The next day, samples were
washed with PBS and 10% donkey serum blocking agent was
applied for 10 minutes at room temperature. Samples were
treated with secondary antibodies diluted in a 5% donkey
serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 solution for one hour at room
temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. Samples
were mounted onto slides and cells were imaged with either
a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany, http://www.leica-microsystems.
com) DM5500 fluorescence microscope or an Olympus (Tokyo,
Japan,
http://www.olympus-lifescience.com)
Fluoview

confocal microscope.
Quantification of cell counts was performed with Image-J
software using immunostained samples. For each experimen-
tal condition, three different lines of hPSCs were utilized.
Within these different cell lines, a minimum of three images
were collected from at least three separate experiments per-
formed at different passage number from each cell line. Each
image was quantified to calculate the percentage of BRN3-
positive cells, as well as the abundance of activated caspase-3
expression relative to the total number of BRN3-positive cells.
ANOVA statistical analyses or student’s t-tests were performed
with Prism software (Graphpad, La Jolla CA, http://www.
graphpad.com) to determine statistically significant differences
at a p value of less than .05. Size of the Golgi complex was
determined by GM130 staining similar to previous reports
[41–43] by calculating the total area of GM130-positive stain-
ing utilizing ImageJ software, and then dividing this number
by the total number of DAPI-positive nuclei. A minimum of
three samples were analyzed per experiment to obtain the
average Golgi area per cell. A student’s t-test was used to
determine statistical significance using Prism software, and
significant differences were identified at a p value less than
.05.
Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were carried out at room
temperature (21 8C) as previously described [44] using an EPC-
10 amplifier and the Pulse8.31 program (HEKA, Lambrecht/
Pfalz, Germany, http://www.heka.com). Fire-polished electro-
des were fabricated from borosilicate capillary glass (1.2-mm
outer diameter, 0.69-mm inner diameter; Sutter Instrument
Co., Novato, CA, http://www.sutter.com) using a P-97 puller
(Sutter Instrument Co.,). After filling with the intracellular
solution containing (in mM): KCl 140, MgCl2 5, EGTA 5, CaCl2
2.5, Hepes 10, ATP 4, GTP 0.3, Phosphocreatine 8, pH7.3
(adjusted with KOH), the access resistance of electrode pip-
ettes ranged between 4 and 5 MX. The bathing solution con-
tained (in mM): NaCl 140, MgCl2 1, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, Hepes 10,
Glucose 10, pH7.3 (adjusted with NaOH). After establishing
the whole-cell recording configuration, cells were allowed to
stabilize for 2-3 minutes in current-clamp mode before initiat-
ing ramp current injection to measure action potential activ-
ity. Cells were held at 2100 mV to stabilize for 5 minutes in
voltage-clamp mode before applying depolarizing voltage
steps to measure potassium and sodium currents. A -P/4 sub-
traction protocol was used to remove linear leak current and
capacitance artifact for all voltage clamp recordings. Voltage
errors were minimized using more than 80% series resistance
compensation. Membrane currents were filtered at 5 kHz and
sampled at 20 kHz. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 5 mM) and tetraethyl-
ammonium (TEA, 100 mM) stock solutions were made using
the bathing solution. TTX or TEA was diluted into a 300 ll
recording chamber to achieve the final concentration.
RESULTS
Identification of hPSC-Derived Retinal Ganglion Cells
The definitive identification of RGCs from a pluripotent source
has been complicated by the lack of specific markers to iden-
tify these cells. The expression of the transcription factor
BRN3 has been widely utilized to identify cells with RGC-like
characteristics [4, 12, 14–18, 24–26]. However, when derived
from hPSCs, such markers lose their specificity as BRN3 is also
expressed in other cell types of the central nervous system,
particularly hair cells of the auditory system [45] as well as
somatosensory neurons [46]. Thus, to conclusively establish
the RGC nature of these cells, their derivation and identifica-
tion necessitates the detailed stepwise differentiation through
early neural and retinal progenitor intermediaries.
To this end, initial efforts were focused upon the differen-
tiation and definitive identification of hPSC-derived RGCs. As
a starting point, hPSCs were directed to differentiate to an
optic vesicle-like stage of retinogenesis as previously described

 [4, 15, 17, 18, 25], at which point highly enriched populations
of
CHX10-positive
retinal
progenitor
cells
comprised
50.02% 6 1.95% of all neurospheres. These retinal populations
were readily identified and isolated apart from their nonreti-
nal forebrain counterparts based upon morphological cues
(Fig. 1A--1C), allowing for the subsequent classification of fur-
ther differentiated phenotypes to the retinal lineage. Within
40 total days of differentiation, enriched populations of optic
vesicle-like retinal neurospheres began to express BRN3 as
well as a compliment of other retinal-associated transcription
factors when analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Conversely, no
expression of genes characteristic of the auditory [45] and
somatosensory [46] lineages was detected. Taken together,
these results confirm the retinal phenotype associated with
these BRN3-positive cells. Immunocytochemistry analysis fur-
ther confirmed the expression of BRN3 with other markers of
the retinal lineage (Fig. 1E--1G). Specifically, BRN3 expression
was often found colocalized with markers typically associated
with retinal progenitor cells and some RGCs such as PAX6 and
SIX6. However, colocalization of BRN3 with markers indicative
of other retinal cell types was not observed (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. S1).
The temporal birth order of specific retinal cell types has
been well characterized in vivo, with retinal progenitors giving
rise to RGCs and cone photoreceptors early while rods and
M€
uller glia emerge later [47, 48]. Through immunocytochemical
analysis, early stages of this stepwise progression to an RGC fate
could be observed (Fig. 2A), with PAX6-positive neural progeni-
tors the first stage in this differentiation process. Following the
identification and isolation of retinal neurospheres, robust differ-
entiation of CHX10-positive retinal progenitors was observed.
The appearance of BRN3-expressing RGCs could be observed
shortly thereafter, followed by the onset of recoverin-positive
photoreceptor-like cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis further
confirmed this stepwise pattern of retinal fate determination
(Fig. 2B).
Characterization and Functional Analysis of hPSC-
Derived Retinal Ganglion Cells
The expression of BRN3, along with the differentiation of
hPSCs through the stepwise process of retinal differentiation,
aids in the identification of resultant RGCs. Overall, approxi-
mately 36.1% 6 1.7% of cells expressed the RGC-associated
transcription factor BRN3 within the first 40 days of differen-
tiation (Fig. 3A). Beyond the expression of BRN3, however, a
variety of other features are associated with the development
of RGCs. Upon differentiation, presumptive RGCs coexpressed
a wide array of such factors associated with RGC specification
(Fig. 3B--3E). Furthermore, maturation and morphological

Definitive identification of presumptive retinal ganglion
cells (RGCs) using BRN3 expression in differentiated cultures of
hPSCs. After 25 days of differentiation, two morphologically dis-
tinct populations of neurospheres were observed (A), from which
optic vesicle-like neurospheres were identified and isolated based
upon their phase-bright appearance (B). Isolated optic vesicle
neurospheres were highly enriched for CHX10-expressing retinal
progenitor cells (C). After a total of 40 days of differentiation, RT-
PCR analysis demonstrated that presumptive RGCs expressed
BRN3 in conjunction with other retinal markers, but not markers
of other BRN3-expressing lineages (D). Genomic DNA (Gen.)
served as a positive control for RT-PCR experiments. Immunocyto-
chemical analysis confirmed expression of BRN3 localized with
other retinal markers (E-G). Images were captured at timepoints
of 30 days of differentiation in A-C, 50 days of differentiation in
E-F, and 70 days of differentiation in G. Scale bars equal 500 lm
in A-B, 100 lm in C, and 50 lm in D-F.

cells (RGCs) are generated in a temporally appropriate sequence.
Immunocytochemistry analysis revealed that BRN3-positive RGCs
appeared subsequent to the establishment of neural (PAX6) and
retinal (CHX10) progenitor fates, but prior to the generation of
photoreceptor-like (Recoverin) cells (A). qRT-PCR analysis con-
firmed that genes associated with retinal and RGC development
were expressed at developmentally-appropriate timepoints, with
those genes associated with retinal progenitors expressed prior
to the onset of RGC-specific genes (B). Scale bar equals 50 lm.

 changes of these cells were readily observed, as BRN3-
positive RGCs were found associated with MAP2-positive neu-
rite extensions (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, a small population of
melanopsin-expressing
cells
were
observed,
indicative
of
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).
These cells expressed high levels of melanopsin (Fig. 3G) and
largely lacked BRN3 expression (Fig. 3G0), typical of the M1
class of ipRGCs [49–51].
The ability to exhibit lengthy neurite outgrowths is a fur-
ther characteristic of RGCs when compared to other neurons
of the retina. Following prolonged growth in vitro, extensive
neurite
outgrowth
was
readily
observed
from
BRN3-
expressing RGCs (Fig. 3H). Cytoskeletal components became
compartmentalized with clear separation of MAP2 expression
in somatodendritic regions and Tau expression confined to
axonal extensions that fasciculated and extended over long
distances. The progressive acquisition of RGC characteristics,
as well as the differential expression of these characteristics
apart from non-retinal forebrain cells, was further character-
ized by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3I–3J). In comparison to retinal
progenitor cells identified at earlier stages of differentiation,
RGC populations exhibited a robust increase in the expression
of RGC-associated genes, along with a significant decrease in
the expression of retinal progenitor-associated genes (Fig. 3I).
Furthermore, when compared to age-matched nonretinal fore-
brain populations as indicated above (Fig. 1A), a significant
increase was observed in the expression of retinal and RGC-
associated genes (Fig. 3J).
As projection neurons connecting the eye with the brain,
and unlike most other neurons of the retina, RGCs transmit
visual information via elicitation of action potentials through
the use of voltage-gated ion channels [29]. To confirm
whether hPSC-derived RGCs are capable of similar physiologi-
cal activity, prospective RGCs were first morphologically iden-
tified for electrophysiological analysis based upon extensive
neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4A) typical of these cells [15, 52, 53].
Electrophysiological activity of hPSC-derived RGCs was then
analyzed by patch clamp analysis, and recorded cells were
filled with Lucifer Yellow for subsequent immunocytochemical
analysis for BRN3 expression to definitively identify analyzed
cells as RGCs (Fig. 4B). hPSC-derived RGCs demonstrated the
ability to fire action potentials (Fig. 4C) and exhibited a hyper-
polarized resting membrane potential (Fig. 4D). These electro-
physiological properties were associated with ionic currents,
including outward flow that could be blocked by the addition
of TEA, indicating the presence of voltage-gated K1 channels
(Fig. 4E), as well as inward current flow that was sensitive to
the voltage-gated Na1 channel blocker TTX (Fig. 4F). Further-
more, both K1 and Na1 ionic currents were shown to be
voltage-dependent in nature.
In Vitro Modeling of Optic Neuropathies Using Patient
Specific iPSCs
The ability to derive RGCs from an hPSC source has important
implications beyond studies of developmental biology [1, 2],
including translational applications [3–5, 7] such as in vitro
disease
modeling
and
pharmacological
screening
[54–56]
when derived from specific patient sources. Mutations in the
OPTN gene have been extensively documented to result in
severe RGC degeneration associated with primary open angle
Figure 3.
Phenotypic characterization of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). After 40 days of differ-
entiation, BRN3-positive RGCs comprised approximately 36.1% 6 1.7% of the total differentiated population (A). BRN3-positve RGCs
expressed numerous RGC-associated markers (B-E), and began to extend MAP2-positive neurites (F) within a total of 50-70 days of differ-
entiation. A small subset of intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-positive RGCs were observed that were BRN3-negative (G-G0) by 70
days of differentiation. Prolonged differentiation of hPSC-derived RGCs eventually gave rise to elaborate RGC-like morphologies exhibiting
compartmentalized expression of MAP2 and TAU, including fasciculated TAU-positive axons (H) within 100 total days of differentiation. qRT-
PCR analysis revealed that BRN3-expressing cultures exhibited significantly increased expression of RGC-associated transcripts compared to
their retinal progenitor precursors (I), as well as their age-matched non-retinal forebrain counterparts (J). Significant differences indicated
as * 5 p < .05, **5 p < .01, *** 5 p < .005, ****5 p < .001. Scale bars equal 200 lm in A, 25lm in B-F, and 10lm in G-H.

 glaucoma [30–35] and therefore, should provide an effective
in vitro tool for studies of underlying disease mechanisms, as
well as subsequent pharmacological screening. To this end,
skin fibroblasts from a patient possessing an E50K missense
mutation in the OPTN gene were reprogrammed to pluripo-
tency, exhibiting robust expression of a full complement of
pluripotency-associated factors (Supporting Information Fig. S2)
and the ability to give rise to cell types of all three germ layers
(Supporting Information Fig. S3).
Upon differentiation, enriched populations of OPTN iPSC-
derived retinal neurospheres (Fig. 5A) were characterized by
robust expression of CHX10 (Fig. 5B), indicative of a retinal
progenitor state [4, 39, 57]. Subsequent differentiation of
these retinal progenitors yielded BRN3-positive cells that
could be definitively identified as RGCs due to their retinal

was performed and retinal ganglion cell morphologies were high-
lighted by DIC microscopy, including long neurite outgrowth in
RGCs derived between 80 and 90 total days of differentiation (A).
Recorded cells were filled with Lucifer Yellow for subsequent
immunocytochemical confirmation of their RGC identity (B).
hPSC-derived RGCs demonstrated the ability to fire action poten-
tials (C) and exhibited a hyperpolarized resting membrane poten-
tial (D). These features were associated with the conductance of
potassium and sodium through voltage-gated channels, which
could be blocked by the addition of either TEA (E) or TTX (F).

Patient-derived hPSCs can be utilized as an effective
model of RGC neurodegeneration. Normal tension glaucoma
patient fibroblasts, due to a mutation in the OPTN gene, were
directed to differentiate to a retinal progenitor fate (A) as charac-
terized by extensive expression of CHX10 (B) by a total of 30
days of differentiation. Retinal ganglion cells were subsequently
differentiated and characterized by the expression of BRN3 as
well as the development of complex neural networks, indicated
by MAP2 (C) and mGluR2 (D) at 70 days of differentiation. In the
pluripotent state, control and OPTN hPSCs exhibited no significant
differences in apoptosis (E-G). Following differentiation for 70
days, OPTN RGCs demonstrated significantly increased apoptosis

 lineage. These RGCs exhibited elaborate MAP2-positive neuro-
nal morphologies and formation of complex neural networks
(Fig. 5C--5D). Undifferentiated OPTN iPSCs exhibited a disor-
ganized Golgi morphology that led to a significant increase in
size (Supporting Information Fig. S4A--S4C), as previously
reported [32, 33, 42]. Interestingly, however, differentiation to
the affected RGC phenotype yielded no significant difference
in the size and organization of the Golgi of OPTN RGCs com-
pared to control RGCs (Supporting Information Fig. S4D--S4F).
To further examine the applicability of OPTN iPSC-derived
RGCs as an in vitro model for glaucoma, the activation of
caspase-3 was analyzed and quantified via immunocytochem-
istry in comparison to unaffected control lines. In undifferenti-
ated cultures, little activation of caspase-3 was observed and
no significant differences were seen between control and
OPTN iPSCs (Fig. 5E--5G). Upon differentiation of these cells
to the affected RGC cell type, caspase-3 activation was mini-
mal
in
control
iPSC-derived
RGCs
but
was
significantly
increased in OPTN iPSC-derived RGCs (Fig. 5H--5J). Given
these increased levels of apoptosis, the ability of these cells
to serve as a tool for pharmacological screening was subse-
quently tested, utilizing factors previously identified as neuro-
protective in other systems [58–63]. Upon treatment of OPTN
iPSC-derived RGCs with either BDNF or PEDF, a significant
reduction in caspase-3 activation was observed (Fig. 5K--5M).
DISCUSSION
The results presented here demonstrate the robust derivation
and definitive identification of RGCs from hPSCs as identified
by the combination of morphological, phenotypic, and physio-
logical measures. Furthermore, these efforts were applied to
establish an in vitro model of glaucoma with patient-derived
iPSCs, allowing for the ability to study associated underlying
features of the disease itself, as well as the potential use as a
tool for pharmacological screening [54].
Although previous reports have demonstrated that hPSCs
can acquire retinal characteristics upon differentiation [4,
12–20, 25], including features of retinal ganglion cells [4,
12–18, 24–28], many markers used to identify RGCs, particu-
larly BRN3, are also expressed in other neural cells, including
some auditory neurons [45] as well as somatosensory neurons
[46]. Thus, efforts to unequivocally assign an RGC identity are
complicated without thorough and systematic characteriza-
tion. Moreover, BRN3 exists in three different forms, namely
BRN3A, BRN3B, and BRN3C [64, 65]. While the current studies
analyzed the overall expression of BRN3, it is likely that most
of the cells expressed BRN3B, as this form is known to play a
critical role in the differentiation and survival of RGCs, and is
also known to be expressed earlier in development than
other forms of BRN3.
In the current study, multiple approaches were under-
taken to ensure that presumptive RGCs had indeed adopted
this fate. First, retinal differentiation proceeded through a ret-
inal progenitor stage that could be readily identified and iso-
lated,
yielding
highly
enriched
populations
of
CHX10-
expressing retinal progenitor cells, with subsequent expression
of BRN3 allowing for more definitive identification of RGCs.
Additionally, BRN3 expression was often found expressed in
close association with other retinal cell types, while expres-
sion of markers associated with auditory and somatosensory
lineages was not observed. Thus, the data presented provides
the strongest evidence to date of the ability to conclusively
differentiate RGCs from hPSCs.
Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)
are a specific subtype of RGC that function in non-visual pho-
totransduction processes including circadian entrainment and
pupillary responses [49–51]. The data presented within the
current study is the first to demonstrate the differentiation of
ipRGCs from hPSCs, as detected by the expression of the pho-
totransduction protein melanopsin. While the derivation of
these cells was exceedingly rare, the presence of these cells
allows for future investigation into the developmental specifi-
cation of ipRGCs, as well as studies analyzing the damage and
loss of ipRGCs in a variety of injuries and degenerative disor-
ders of the retina [66].
Beyond phenotypic features, these hPSC-derived RGCs
also possessed appropriate morphological and physiological
features. After prolonged growth in vitro, hPSC-derived RGCs
were capable of extensive neurite outgrowth, which was spe-
cifically directed toward other aggregates of cells, perhaps
due to paracrine signaling. Further maturation of hPSC-
derived RGCs was also observed in the compartmentalization
of MAP2 and Tau, cytoskeletal proteins that are found widely
expressed
in
immature
neurons
but
whose
expression
becomes confined to somatodendritic and axonal regions,
respectively, in mature neurons [67]. Furthermore, these cells
exhibited the ability to function physiologically, with the abil-
ity
to
conduct
sodium
and
potassium
through
voltage-
dependent channels as well as the ability to fire action poten-
tials. Although these features are characteristic of many types
of neurons [29], in the retina these characteristics are specifi-
cally found within the RGCs as well as a subset of amacrine
cells. While these cells exhibited a hyperpolarized resting
membrane potential, this potential was recorded at an aver-
age of approximately 240 mV, indicating that these cells have
not yet reached a fully mature state. Future experiments will
necessitate the development of methods by which these
hPSC-derived RGCs can be induced to mature further in vitro.
Beyond the differentiation and characterization of hPSC-
derived RGCs, efforts were also focused on the development
of iPSC-based models of optic neuropathies. Glaucoma is the
most prevalent of the optic neuropathies, with a current inci-
dence of more than 60 million individuals worldwide [22, 23].
However, a variety of factors exist which are causative or at
least associated with the onset of glaucomatous neurodegen-
eration [68, 69]. Mutations in the OPTN gene were selected
for study, particularly the E50K mutation which has been pre-
viously demonstrated to result in a particularly severe neuro-
degenerative phenotype [30–32]. While the results obtained
with these cells will be of significance for future studies of
this glaucoma-associated genotype, these results could also
prove to be more profound for other glaucoma phenotypes
as well. As other factors such as elevated intraocular pressure
have been suggested to serve as a trigger for subsequent
degeneration of RGCs [69], mutations in genes including
OPTN could provide a similar trigger, with downstream effects
mimicking features of glaucoma common to many underlying
causes.
Whereas previous studies have analyzed features of glau-
coma in RGCs by utilizing animal models or nonaffected cell

 types in vitro [42, 70, 71], the development of a iPSCs model
of glaucoma allows for precise analysis of the affected cell
type. The ability to study features of the disease process in
human cells from the affected cell type is of utmost impor-
tance, as some previous studies have identified disruptions in
the Golgi complex as a hallmark of certain mutations in
OPTN, including the E50K mutation [32, 33, 42]. While this
phenotype was recapitulated in undifferentiated OPTN iPSCs,
this Golgi fragmentation was not observed upon differentia-
tion to RGCs, the cell type directly affected by the disease
process. It is not completely surprising that the Golgi pheno-
type changed following differentiation, as previous studies
have demonstrated that the shape and size of the Golgi com-
plex can, and indeed often does, vary from one type of cell to
another [72, 73]. The size and shape of the Golgi complex are
often larger in those cells that have greater intracellular traf-
ficking demands, particularly those that are mitotically active
such as undifferentiated hPSCs. This is reflected in the fact that
the Golgi size was markedly larger in the undifferentiated state
compared to differentiated RGCs, regardless of whether the
cells were from control or E50K sources. Thus, there is not nec-
essarily any reason to expect that differences between cell
sources in the undifferentiated state will be maintained at later
stages of differentiation. In fact, the data presented strongly
suggest that differences in Golgi morphology do not likely con-
tribute to increased caspase-3 activation observed in OPTN
E50K cells. Thus, disruptions to the Golgi complex may not
have any direct connection to the health and survival of RGCs
and consequently, may not play a role in glaucomatous neuro-
degeneration observed in patient samples. Such a result under-
scores the importance of iPSC-based models of inherited
diseases and the ability to differentiate these cells to the
affected cell type. The increased apoptosis observed in OPTN
cells appeared to be specific for RGCs, the affected cell type, as
no significant differences were observed in undifferentiated
OPTN iPSCs compared to control cell lines. As such, the devel-
opment of this in vitro model of glaucoma will allow for future
studies analyzing precise mechanisms underlying glaucomatous
neurodegeneration. The results of these studies also highlight
the potential of iPSCs to serve as a tool for pharmacological
screening [54–56], as treatment of OPTN iPSC-derived RGCs
with either BDNF or PEDF was able to partially rescue these
cells from apoptosis. Interestingly, treatment with these neuro-
protective factors yielded similar levels of cell survival. While
the reason for this similarity is not known, the possibility exists
for overlap in these two signaling pathways. While both BDNF
and PEDF are known to inhibit the apoptotic pathway [59–61,
63], they also affect transcription through MEK/ERK signaling
pathways [58]. Thus, the similar net effects produced by BDNF
and PEDF could be due to convergence of these signaling path-
ways within the cell.
CONCLUSION
Taken together, the results of the current study represent the
most comprehensive description of RGC derivation from an
hPSC source by morphological, phenotypic, and functional
parameters, as well as the ability to utilize these approaches
for studies of optic neuropathies such as glaucoma. On a
broader level, this study establishes the suitability of hPSCs to
analyze critical stages of RGC development from a human
source. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the applicabil-
ity of hPSC-derived RGCs for disease modeling and pharmaco-
logical screening for a host of optic neuropathies, both
complementing existing animal models as well as narrowing
the gap to clinical applications.
