Abstract
Background: Current policy priorities to strengthen the nursing sector in India have focused on increasing the
number of nurses in the health system. However, the nursing sector is afflicted by other, significant problems
including the low status of nurses in the hierarchy of health care professionals, low salaries, and out-dated systems
of professional governance, all affecting nurses’ leadership potential and ability to perform. Stronger nurse
leadership has the potential to support the achievement of health system goals, especially for strengthening of
primary health care, which has been recognised and addressed in several other country contexts. This research
study explores the process of policy agenda-setting for nurse leadership in India, and aims to identify the structural
and systemic constraints in setting the agenda for policy reforms on the issue.
Methods: Our methods included policy document review and expert interviews. We identified policy reforms
proposed by different government appointed committees on issues concerning nurses’ leadership and its progress.
Experts’ accounts were used to understand lack of progress in several nursing reform proposals and analysed using
deductive thematic analysis for ‘legitimacy’, ‘feasibility’ and ‘support’, in line with Hall’s agenda setting model.
Results: The absence of quantifiable evidence on the nurse leadership crisis and treatment of nursing reforms as a
‘second class’ issue were found to negatively influence perceptions of the legitimacy of nurse leadership reform.
Feasibility is affected by the lack of representation of nurses in key positions and the absence of a nurse-specific
institution, which is seen as essential for creating visibility of the issues facing the profession, their processing and
planning for policy solutions. Finally, participants noted the lack of strong support from nurses themselves for these
policy reforms, which they attributed to social disempowerment, and lack of professional autonomy.
Conclusions: The study emphasises that the nursing empowerment needs institutional reforms to facilitate nurse’s
distributed leadership across the health system and to enable their collective advocacy that questions the status
quo and the structures that uphold it.
Background
Nurses form the backbone of India’s health system repre-
senting 30.5% of all health workers in India [1]. Neverthe-
less, the inability to train, retain and deploy an adequate
number of qualified nurses has been recognized by experts
as one of the greatest challenges for achieving health
system effectiveness [2, 3]. It is estimated that India needs
an additional 2.4 million nurses to reach their optimal
number in the health system [4, 5]. Recent initiatives have
attempted to redress the nurses’ shortages in health care
delivery and tried to correct imbalances in their geograph-
ical distribution [6].
Nevertheless, the lack of numbers is not the only
problem faced by the Indian nursing. Their role in deci-
sion making, both in the clinical and public health
domains is not recognised in India. Several experts have
documented the state of affairs of nursing in the public
and private sector and the official apathy towards them.
They have described how status hierarchy among various
cadres of health professionals which positions nurses at a
lower place compared to medical professionals and the
nurses’ dominant gender identity within the socio-cultural
contexts constrain their ability to take up leadership posi-
tions in their own professional realm as well as in health
sector [7, 8]. Nair and Prescott have argued that nurses’

 compromised professional and social acceptance has direct
repercussions on their performance and contribution to
health system [9]. The low position of nurses in the hier-
archy of health care professionals, poor working conditions,
low salary, and out-dated personnel norms, all operate in
vicious cycles to create compromised professional position
of nurses. Skill development and career progression oppor-
tunities for nurses in India are meagre [8]. Abjuration of
several nursing leadership positions at the district and state
level in the public sector has been reported in a previous
study [10]. Likewise, the experts who have commented
on a major strike of the nurses working in private sec-
tor in the national capital had identified exploitative
working conditions akin to bonded labour as the reason
for their strike [9].
The current situation of nursing in India warrants sev-
eral policy reforms to counter the adverse service and
social conditions in order to facilitate their overall profes-
sional contribution as a valuable human resource. The
situation of nurses has special significance for equitable
health services in developing country contexts such as in
India as most of them are placed as the frontline health
workers in remote and difficult locations and play key role
in addressing various social determinants of health. Sev-
eral official committees appointed by government to look
into nursing issues in the past have recommended various
reform proposals. These recommendations vary from
increasing the number of nurses in the health system to
establishment of key positions for nurses in the higher bur-
eaucracy. Nevertheless, the recent reforms have only focused
on recruiting and deploying more nurses and the leadership
challenges faced by nurses are generally overlooked.
The agenda of building nurse leadership occupies a
central position in the WHO’s strategic directions for
nursing and midwifery globally, in recognition of their
potential to act as “agents of change” within health systems
[11]. The 1987 WHO report on nursing promotes a vision
of nurse leadership which is about creation of ‘empowered
nurses’ who mobilize, influence and collaborate at multiple
levels [12]. Previous studies on nursing have established
the link between strengthening nursing leadership and
better health system performance [13–15]. However,
nurses’ leadership potential is negatively impacted when
their status among the professional hierarchy are com-
promised compared to medical and other health profes-
sionals [16, 17].
Most literature on nurse leadership conceptualise lead-
ership as individual ability to influence others towards
achievement of relevant organizational goals [13, 14]. In
this article, we examine nursing leadership as a means to
strengthen the health system, by building structures that
facilitate and support the leadership potential of every
nurse in the system in order to achieve health system
goals [18]. This concept of ‘distributed leadership’ is a
shift from focus on the agency of individual leaders to
the characteristics and design of the systems that facili-
tate leadership culture [19, 20]. The focus of this paper
is on the policy reforms that are required to address the
structural and systemic change that could facilitate
nurses’ distributed leadership and enhance their roles as
“agents of change in the health system”.
This study explored the process of agenda-setting for
policies that could facilitate distributed nurse leadership
in India, in public and private sector and in clinical and
public health field, with the intention of understanding
what factors are preventing action to strengthen the nurse
leadership in India. Analysing the ‘agenda setting’ process
is a way of understanding which issues, under what con-
texts gain policy attention. A key focus of such research is
the attention on the process through which new ideas or
policies may or may not be accepted within a political and
policy system [21]. Therefore, research on agenda setting
may also help in understanding the dynamics of status
quo in policy process and explore potential pathways
through which change can be facilitated.
Methods
In order to understand the policy propositions for ad-
dressing nurses’ leadership crisis, we reviewed various key
official documents at the national level and their prescrip-
tions regarding nursing administrations, education and
deployment. Two key documents included in this review
are a report of the High Power Committee set up by the
government of India that recommend several nursing
reforms and a review report of status of nursing in five
states undertaken by the National Health System Resource
Centre, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and AN-
SWERS [22, 23]. The other documents are Bhore commit-
tee report of 1946, the Indian Nursing Council Act of
1947 and its three amendments, the code of ethics and
professional conduct prescribed by the Indian Nursing
Council, the professional conduct etiquettes by Trained
Nurses Association of India, Chadah committee report
of 1963, National Health Policies of 1982 and 2002 and
Clinical Establishment Act of 2010. The review of these
documents helped to identify the reform proposals, status
of their implementation and various challenges with re-
spect to the agenda of strengthening nursing leadership.
In addition, nine (09) interviews took place (between 5
and 24 August 2013) in New Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and
Kerala with experts who were identified according to their
interest in nursing governance and the extent to which
they have information and knowledge on decision-making
and implementation of policies dealing with nurse leader-
ship. Though three interviews were carried out at the state
level, all interviewees had expertise on nurse leadership
issues at the national level. Except for three, all the other
participants were qualified nurses. The Table 1 describes

 the characteristics of Key Informants interviewed in the
study.
Though this study was based on limited number of ex-
pert interviews, it was felt that saturation was reached
with each informant identifying similar barriers to nurse
leadership and solutions to these.
A topic guide was developed to help conversations
with informants and questions were formulated with the
aim of obtaining relevant, complete and contextualized
information on nurse leadership and on appropriate policy
solutions that address nurses’ leadership crisis in India.
The interviews were held in August of 2013 and started
by exploring the context of nurse leadership in India and
structural and systemic constraints in setting the agenda
for policy reforms on the issue.
All the interviews were in English and handwritten notes
were taken at the time of interview and later transcribed
into text format. Data were thematically organized and
classified according to ‘legitimacy’
, ‘feasibility’ and ‘support’
,
in line with Hall’s agenda setting model [24]. The model
stipulates that a policy issue needs to fulfil the criteria of
legitimacy, feasibility and support in order to be included
in the policy agenda. Legitimacy is conceptualised as the
“characteristic of issues which governments believe they
should be concerned with and in which they have a right
or even obligation to intervene”. Feasibility is about imple-
mentation potential, which is dependent upon i) technical
and theoretical knowledge; ii) financial resources and
human capital; iii) administrative capability and infra-
structure. ‘Support’ denotes the level of public support for
government in relation to the issue.
Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethics Com-
mittee of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medi-
cine, the institutions of two of the authors. Consent was
obtained from the study participants interviewed, after
providing them with information regarding the study’s
aims and objectives. Consent forms ensured their confi-
dentiality and anonymity, and codes were assigned to
protect their identity.
Findings
Drawing on the document review, we first clarify the
structure of nursing institutions in India. Section B then
presents main policy reform proposals for advancing
nurse leadership extracted from our review of the key
documents and the status of these reforms at the time of
the study. Based on the core objectives of these reform
proposals, we group them under two headings; policies
proposed for creating social mobility and policies for
strengthening nursing institutions. Under section C, based
on expert interviews which reflected on contextualised
assessment of the policy process concerning nurses’ leader-
ship reforms in India, we outline our findings about agenda
setting using Hall’s agenda setting model.
An overview of nursing in India
Figure 1 shows the hierarchical cadre structure of nurses in
the Indian health system organised according to different
functions.
The figure shows the complex hierarchical structure of
nursing in India and the leadership positions available to
nurses at the national, state and district level. There are
different hierarchical structures for nursing education
and administration as is the case for public health and
clinical nursing. The senior most administrative position
for nursing at national level is the nursing advisor in
the national ministry of health. Nursing councils at the
national and state levels are autonomous bodies which
are mandated to regulate the nursing education and
registration and monitoring of nursing practice. The
different leadership positions are also designated separ-
ately for community (public health) and clinical nurses
at the sub-district level. The leadership positions for
community nursing such as Public Health Nurse (PHN)
and District Public Health Nurse Officer (DPHNO) po-
sitions can be availed by nurses across clinical and
community and education sectors as denoted by the
dotted lines.
While the above structure depicts the normative
requirement, there are a number of inadequacies. For
example, senior positions at the level of Director or
Joint Director or Deputy Director of nursing, which is
the highest nursing official in provinces, are either not
created or are officiated by medical doctors in most
states. Similarly, a review of nursing sector in five
states carried out in 2011 reported that a key public
health leadership position at the district level, DPHNO
is vacant in most districts [23]. The same review also
identified that only very few Auxiliary Nurse Mid-wife
(ANM), the entry level community nurses, are given
opportunity to move to the first supervisory position
of Lady Health Visitor (LHV) or higher in their entire
career.

 Principal policy reform agendas for developing nurse
leadership
Based on our document review, we identify the reforms
that are considered crucial and grouped them under
two headings, those help in uplifting the status of nursing
and those which strengthen the nursing institutions, both
are considered important for distributed nurse leadership.
Policies proposed for creating social mobility
Bhore committee report of 1946 and the High Power
committee on nursing of 1987 recommended the need
for nurse leaders at all levels of administration for facili-
tating their active participation in decision making. The
pre-independence Bhore committee advocated for giving
higher rank to nurses to address the low status of the In-
dian nursing professionals. These committees have also
asked for better salary and living conditions for nurses.
Another committee constituted by the government in
1954 specifically to review the service conditions of nurses
recommended improvements in service and living condi-
tions so as to attract ‘educated young women from good
families’ to the profession.
Enhancing the quality of education was seen as an im-
portant step to enhance professional position of nurses
among different cadres of health workers. Various commit-
tees have recommended reforming the nursing education
to professionalise nursing. For example, the high power
committee (1987) suggested two streams of nursing
namely professional stream of graduate nurses and lesser
qualified auxiliary nurses’ stream. Specialization by way of
post-graduate and doctorate degrees was also proposed
as an important step towards professional development
[25, 26].
Improving the working conditions and providing def-
inite paths for career progression of nurses to improve
the social and professional position of nurses are two
long standing demands of various nurses’ associations
like Trained Nurses Association of India (TNAI) and
Society of Midwifes in India [27]. The federal ministry of
health and family welfare had written several letters, be-
tween 1999 to 2011 to state governments on the issue of
working conditions of nurses; number of working days;
allowances; upgradation of posts; payscales; promotions
and study leave. TNAI’s proposal for instituting a separ-
ate professional code of conduct for nurses is another

 attempt to uplift the professional status and to provide
distinct professional identity for nurses [27].
Strengthening nursing institutions
Developing nurses’ leadership relies on the capacities of key
nursing institutions to deliver against their mandate and
their empowerment in doing so. Different committees that
looked into nursing issues have noted that nurses are gen-
erally not involved in making policies that govern their sta-
tus and practice [22, 28]. The High Power committee
recommended the inclusion of nurse leaders at all levels of
administration in order to facilitate their active participation
in planning for health sector. Institutional reforms were
seen as a central component to operationalizing nurse lead-
ership in the country. The most prominent solution put
forward by the High Power committee was the establish-
ment of Nursing Directorates at state level. With this
arrangement, the committee had argued for bringing all
nursing personnel technically and administratively under
the control of nursing personnel themselves. The central
ministry of health and family welfare has also issued guide-
lines in the year 2002 for establishment of separate nursing
cadres in states with delegation of administrative and finan-
cial powers.
Despite several reform proposals for improving status
and strengthening leadership of nurses, realization of such
proposals to actual policies and its implementation
remained faulty at the time of this study. A 2011 report of
the central health ministry which was prepared for an ex-
pert group consultation on management capacity at the
state and district level had observed this as a critical gap
[29]. “These cadres would be excluded from senior levels of
management, even of their own cadre”. Similarly, a situ-
ational analysis of status of nursing reforms in five states
carried out in 2008–09 shows lack of progress in many of
the reform initiatives. The Table 2 provides details on the
status of nursing reforms as observed at the time of situ-
ational analysis and its implication on nursing profession
and health system.
Agenda setting process for policy reforms for nurse

work, we identify the inadequacies in the agenda setting

 process of policy reforms and try to identify the reasons
and solutions based on our analysis of expert opinion.
Legitimacy
The process of determining the legitimacy of nurse lead-
ership reform proposals involves examining the issues
that are recognized as a problem by a significant number
of policy actors especially the decision makers. Key in-
formants interviewed for this study also noted that most
of the issues identified as deficits in the nursing sector
could not be resolved without the recognition of the is-
sues by the highest levels of authority. Table 3 describes
the issues which are classified as legitimate based on our
analysis of key informant interviews.
In the absence of perception of severity of nurses’ lead-
ership issue by national and state level decision makers,
the legitimacy of nursing reforms is drawn towards other
issues. Interviewees have noted the need for a facilitating
factor, a focusing event that would unambiguously call for
action and redress by government to bring attention on
nursing issues back to policy makers. It was further ex-
plained that in government decision making settings, the
perceived severity may be inferred from quantitative data
or statistics, which allows for an appreciation of the scale
of the issues at hand. Prioritization of policies for increas-
ing nursing educational institutions and improving staffing
levels in public sector is attributed by experts to the publi-
cation of large number of recent researches and data on
nurse shortages and migration. The same considerations
have also led to an attention on deficits in the reliability,
validity and completeness of data regarding workforce
quantification, qualifications, registration of nurses. The
healthcare areas where nurses could add more value than
medical professionals have also received recent policy
attention and experts acknowledged increasing legitimacy
for nurses’ leadership roles in geriatric and palliative care
in recent years.
The policies supporting larger professional roles for
nurses and strengthening nurse leadership were not
perceived as legitimate in the sight of policy makers.
Some informants saw the reason for these as embedded
within the country’s socio-cultural context, particularly in
relation to “woman’s place in society and her place outside
the home”, which affected the perception of nursing issues
by government and other stakeholders “as second class is-
sues” (IA; IB; IF; ID; IE; IG). The dominant perception that
nursing is an unskilled work, which can be equated with
menial jobs is also contributing towards disregard for
reforms for empowerment of nursing workforce. Some in-
formants suggested that this lack of recognition of nursing
issues is explained by insufficient clarity around what the
nursing function actually entails (IG), as their role is often
perceived as “limited to taking orders from doctors” (IH).
The current division of labour at service delivery point
was described as reflecting nursing’s subservience to the
medical profession.
Nursing profession came from UK and came as a
small group to give care to British soldiers. Nursing
was under a very regimented structure, trained to
obey, trained to take supplementary role, not to take
first role. In India there is very little chance of nursing
becoming independent. (ID)
Feasibility
Feasibility of policy reforms for nurse leadership is about
the structural and functional capabilities required to
carry the agenda of nursing leadership reforms forward.
The Table 4 lists the factors identified as important for
feasibility.
The experts observed that most of the issues identified
as deficits in the nurse leadership sector could not be re-
solved without allowing nurses to hold positions of hier-
archy within the government. In spite of several reform
proposals, nurses’ relative position within the hierarchy of
health workers has not significantly progressed over the

 years. “Leadership grows in social contexts and hierarchical
settings, but a nurse is the lowest in this hierarchy” (ID).
Informants reported that there is currently no position
with decision-making power in the nursing sector and
therefore, they are excluded from policy making process.
“Such a post is yet to be created” (IA) and “leadership will
only be achieved if we reach professional equality” (ID).
Leadership of nursing is disempowered by the high
number of vacancies at key institutions, including the
Ministry of Health and the Indian Nursing Council
(INC). At the state level, nurses are neither involved nor
represented in decision making (IG; IA; IF). Some infor-
mants stressed that the INC, the only national institution
represented by nurses, may be better governed and better
staffed, but they still lacked the political clout to influence
decisions and policies at state level. While some infor-
mants referred to INC as the ‘go-to’ institution for nurses,
others felt it neither had the constitutional authority nor
the power to act upon nursing issues other than matters
concerning nurses’ education (IG, IH).
Regarding the feasibility of the national directives to
states (province) on strengthening of the nursing sector, the
experts identified the division between state and national
responsibilities for health as a factor. “Policy direction is
given to states but it is up to states to implement and there
is little leverage, as the state is the supreme decision-maker
in health matters” (IC). The state nursing councils are
described as weak in the state-level political hierarchy, as
power is always located at the directorate of health, where
nurses are neither involved nor represented. The ab-
sence of a nurse-specific institution at the state level,
such as directorate of nursing is reported as a key limi-
tation, as a separate directorate for nursing would have
highlighted the issues facing the profession and advanced
many policy solutions. Absence of separate nursing direct-
orate is perceived as the most glaring gap and its establish-
ment is considered important for allocating funding for the
nursing sector and for addressing poor working conditions
of nurses. “Without it we are not represented and the power-
less cannot lead” (ID).
Improving feasibility of the proposed reform solutions
to nurse leadership deficits is described as complex. In-
formants discussed a number of solutions, yet their
feasibility is seen as hampered by a dismembered nurse
leadership, corruption and a lack of vision for nursing at
the institutional level. The profession is described by one
of experts as “weak in the head, led and managed by those
who neither have the time or the inclination to invest their
efforts at quality improvements” (ID). The processes by
which policy solutions are debated and designed were also
characterized as detrimental to agenda setting. The com-
position of working groups and committees set up to ad-
dress specific issues was seen as unrepresentative of the
nursing profession (II, IB). While the inclusion of new
people into such forums was seen as important, it was also
recognized that high-level appointments are political and
candidates are not selected on the basis of merit but
rather on the degree to which they will not disrupt the sta-
tus quo. “These were systematically led by a group of
tightly knit individuals” (II). “This reproduces the vicious
circle of inaction”, where “nobody wants to take the lead
for fear of losing their job” (II).
Support
In line with Hall’s model, understanding the level of sup-
port for policy reforms for nurse leadership is made on
the basis of experts’ opinion on nature of support from
government and other decision-makers. The position of
all key actors, and specifically, their non-objection to the
issue were ascertained (Table 5).
Informants unanimously and unambiguously reported
a lack of high level of support for developing nurse lead-
ership at all levels of the health system. “It is difficult to
move people around this issue” (IF). For example, the
long lead-times for application processing, candidate selec-
tion and recruitment for key nursing positions (which is de-
scribed as taking on an average two years) is explained as a
reflection of the low prioritization of nursing at the national
level (IA).
The majority of informants noted the lack of strong
support from nurses themselves for these policy reforms.
Lack of buy-ins from nurses and their non-participation
in decision making process is described as a systemic
weakness of the nursing sector. “Leadership in nursing is
dispersed across the country, disjointed in its efforts and
lacked the vision, the sustenance and the unity to plead
its own cause” (ID). A lack of belief among nurses that
their conditions can be improved and their lack of inter-
est in these matters are given as other reasons for this.
The situation is described by experts with statements
such as “nurses are being against nursing” (II) or “nurses
aspiring to do well… leaving the country” (ID).
Experts have observed that the interests of the medical
profession are steering the directions of debates in
health sector. Over-dominance of medical professionals
is attributed to nursing profession’s disempowerment,
and its lack of autonomy and independence. One
respondent felt that the public opinion that shapes the

 perception of nursing should be challenged. “We need to
convince people about our potential” (II). However, at the
same time, securing the support of key stakeholders and
making use of the current opportunities are seen as stra-
tegic. “Beneficial alliances can be forged with the medical
profession, we need to work with doctors, not against them,
and if doctors take credit, then so be it. But, if it means
that our profession will rise, it is worth joining hands” (II).
Discussion
Policy reforms needed to address the nursing leadership
crisis are challenged by the range and complexity of is-
sues as identified in the study. The limitation of the
study is the small number of key informants who partici-
pated. The Hall’s framework which analyses the process
of agenda setting of policies based on the concept of le-
gitimacy, feasibility and support provides an opportunity
to compare and understand the experience of nursing
leadership in other settings.
An unclear clinical responsibility assigned to nurses in
their healthcare domain is described as a reason for low
legitimacy for policies facilitating nurse leadership in
Jordan [30]. Enhancing the image of nursing sector is seen
as crucial step towards creating an enabling environment
for national structures and processes that facilitate nurses’
leadership [31, 32]. The structural forces that shape the
perception of nursing will be a major challenge in India.
As a 1987 WHO report on nursing highlighted, “the nurs-
ing culture remains heavy with subordination without
influence…(and) burdened with obligation without power”
and had predicted that the nursing sector should “expect
to face resistance yet take up positions from where it can
voice its opinions at policy and decision-making levels”
[12].
Understaffing at key national-level nursing institutions
weakens the feasibility of framing relevant issues and pol-
icy solutions. The experience of nursing in other countries
point to the need for creating strong leadership among
academic nurses as a precursor for changes across the sec-
tor [33]. An attempt in the past to develop nurse leaders
in academic setting in India has shown challenges. This
isolated effort to build academic nurse leaders met with
only limited and unsuitable gains in the context of several
structural constrains, including social and organizational
constraints [34].
Gaining support for policy reforms is contingent upon
nurses’ ability to collectively demand for change. Ab-
sence of tactical advocacy strategy targeting key actors
and civil society is seen as a major shortcoming of the
nursing sector in India. Nurses should consider building
strategic alliances across the health system to push for
policy reforms promoting nurses’ leadership within the
health system. Carter identifies nurses’ own reluctance
to challenge the male domination of the health system
as the major hurdle in changing the structural limita-
tions of the nursing profession [35]. Fletcher argues that
the style of leadership in nursing has been a reflection of
an oppressed group, shaped by the oppressing social
forces. He calls for increased self-reflection and dialogue
as a way ahead to break the cycle of oppression and lead
to changes in the structures that oppress nurses [36].
Experiences of the nursing sector in other countries
resonate with Indian scenario. For example, the experi-
ence of South Africa, which is known for stronger partici-
pation of nurses in the health system, shows that nurses’
leadership
development
during
apartheid
years
was
strongly entangled in the political context and depended
on their ability to create strategic alliances and protect
self-interest [16]. Another article on Democratic Nursing
Organization of South Africa describes the role played
by the organization in uplifting the status of nurses by mobi-
lising, unifying and organising nurses as a collective group
in South Africa [37]. Unification of the nurses and their col-
lective power is identified as the way forward for empower-
ing nurses in Iran, where, as in India various contextual
factors constrain nurses’ leadership potential [17, 38].
Furthermore, the possibility of achieving results with
active government support should not be understated.
The recent government interventions and reforms that
promote scaling-up of nursing education and strength-
ening of nursing curricula include strong inputs towards
communication, policy and planning modules [26]. The
expectation is that empowered by their newly acquired
skills, nurses will be able to advocate for their increased
role in health sector.
Conclusion
The absence of effective policies that create distributed
and bottom-up nurse leadership in India called for this
analysis of policy-making processes. This paper specific-
ally sought to examine the agenda-setting process to
understand the constraints on policy development for
nurse leadership. This paper shows that the agenda of
strengthening distributed nurse leadership in India is
constrained by both the compromised social position of
nurses and the imbalance in distribution of power and
influence of nurses within the health system. This analysis
also brings to attention the need to go beyond a strategy
of creating few nurse leaders at the top. There is consen-
sus among the experts that the nurse participation in deci-
sion making from the grassroots to the institutional level
requires several facilitating policies targeting various levels
of health system.
The study reinforces the argument that the determi-
nants of nursing empowerment and leadership can only
be addressed through deliberate attempts to enact institu-
tional reforms that facilitate nurse leadership and through
nurses’ collective advocacy to question the status quo and

 the structures that uphold it. This study further highlights
the importance of generating further evidence on linkages
between governance and policy reforms for health human
resources and its influence of health system performance.
A deeper understanding of the health system leadership
arrangements, especially the distributed leadership will
play a key role in creating equitable, efficient and account-
able system.
