We used data on 3,139 female social network friendship dyads from 3 waves of the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent to Adult Health (wave I: 1994–1995; wave II: 1996; and wave IV: 2007–2008) to assess whether
friends’ reports of experiencing sexual violence (SV) and friends’ substance use risk scores predicted whether ado-
lescents and young adults would experience SV themselves. We also used longitudinal analyses to test the asso-
ciations of combined wave-I and -II risk factors with wave-IV reports of SV and of combined wave-I and -II SV with
network connectivity at wave II. After adjustment for a participant’s substance use risk score, each 1-point increase
in a friend’s substance use risk score increased a respondent’s odds of experiencing SV by 1.19 (95% confidence
interval: 1.03, 1.36). Having a friend who reported SV increased a respondent’s odds of reporting SV by 1.95 (95%
confidence interval: 1.25, 3.07), although not after we included school-level fixed effects. Having a friend who expe-
rienced SV in adolescence did however increase the respondent’s odds of reporting SV as a young adult by 1.54
(95% confidence interval: 1.00, 2.37). Respondents who reported SV by wave II had less network connectedness
at wave II. Experiences of SV and substance use within adolescent girls’ friendship networks are linked to risk for
SV into young adulthood, which suggests that network-focused SV prevention and intervention approaches may
be warranted.

Abbreviation: SV, sexual violence.
Adolescent girls are at high risk of experiencing sexual vio-
lence (SV). More than 1 in 10 high school girls in the United
States reports a history of forced sex. Among women with a his-
tory of SV, 30% were first assaulted between the ages of 11 and
17 years, and 37% were first assaulted between the ages of 18
and 24 years (1, 2). SV is a pervasive and difficult-to-monitor
human rights violation; it threatens the health and well-being of
girls through well-documented physical, sexual, behavioral, and
mental health consequences (3), including substance use, injury,
unintended pregnancy, poor birth outcomes, human immunodefi-
ciency virus infection, and sexually transmitted infections (4–7).
Furthermore, girls who experience SV may engage in maladap-
tive coping by withdrawing socially (8), with the potential con-
sequence of limiting their sources of social support. Emphasis
on young populations is of particular importance because they
have higher rates of victimization but also because such experi-
ences have been found to have long-lasting effects on girls’ tra-
jectories into adulthood (3, 9). Prevention and intervention are
needed; however, despite increased funding and focus on this
issue over the past 20 years, there has been no reduction in the
rate of SV among adolescents or any other population in the
United States over this time. Innovations in prevention are
essential (10).
National efforts to prevent sexual assault emphasize the
importance of using an ecological approach that is inclusive
of peers, schools, and communities; recent efforts have focused
on the prevention of perpetration. Historically, prevention ef-
forts were directed at females (e.g., self-defense training), but
these approaches directed responsibility at potential victims
rather than perpetrators (11). Research was primarily limited
to analysis of individual risk behaviors that place girls at risk
for victimization and identified substance use as a major risk
factor, both in the United States and cross-nationally (5). It is
important to consider, however, that although consumption of
an intoxicating substance may hinder a girl’s ability to defend
herself against a perpetrator, perpetration of SV is likely

 greater within social contexts in which drinking and other risk
behaviors occur (12, 13). Because adolescent friendship net-
works are significant determinants of girls’ substance use (14,
15), they may offer important context to help understand other
related risks, such as SV. In prior research among adolescent
males, researchers documented that boys with social networks
characterized by violence perpetration were more likely to per-
petrate violence (16), which suggests that there may be some
social contexts in which girls are at higher risk of experiencing
SV, including social contexts in which substance use is occur-
ring. These contexts may include neighborhood or schools (17)
or more proximal social networks of peers and family. School-
level factors, including norms of acceptability of violence, inter-
personal climate, and school responsiveness to violence, have
been demonstrated as predictors of students’ physical aggres-
sion, with school effects being stronger for female students than
for male students (18).
Social network studies offer important insights into social
contexts by demonstrating how risks and exposures, including
those specific to sexual behavior, substance use, and perpetration
of violence (14, 15, 19–22), cluster between socially connected
individuals (23–25). By identifying associations between clus-
ters of socially connected people, network analyses can help
identify descriptive norms, or behaviors that are regularly prac-
ticed by people within a specific group (26). Network studies
also provide insight into how to engage in innovative norma-
tively focused interventions for groups of people rather than
individuals. Finally, network studies can help identify the rela-
tionships between social structural characteristics and risk fac-
tors. For instance, in some previous research it has been shown
that girls with lower social status are more likely to experience
sexual harassment (27), although the relationship between sex-
ual victimization and social status may be dependent upon the
context of the girl’s social network (28). Experience of sexual
violence can cause girls to socially withdraw, resulting in a
change in network after the experience of trauma (8). Despite
evidence of these dynamics, there have been few studies in
which the associations between networks and experiences of SV
have been investigated.
In the present study, we used girls’ friendship networks to
assess experiences of SV and substance use reported by their
friends and their associations with the respondent’s likelihood of
experiencing SV in adolescence and (via longitudinal examina-
tion) into young adulthood. Secondarily, to further understand
the social structural context of SV, we considered whether an
adolescent girl’s experience of SV influenced her connectedness
within friendship networks. Findings from this work can guide
innovative network-level SV prevention efforts for girls.
METHODS
Data
To assess the associations of friendship networks with the inci-
dence of SV against adolescent girls and young adult women, we
used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, which is a nationally representative study in which in-
vestigators explored adolescent well-being (29). Four waves
of the study have been completed (29). Wave I was conducted
in 1994–1995 and included adolescents in grades 7 through
12; wave II was conducted in 1996, wave III was conducted in
2001–2002, and wave IV was conducted in 2007–2008. In wave
I, researchers collected an “in-school” sample of 90,118 ado-
lescents chosen from a nationally representative sample of 142
schools. A subset of adolescents was sampled for follow-up inter-
views. In all 4 waves of data collection, this nationally representa-
tive “in-home” sample completed longer questionnaires about
their social networks, health behaviors, family dynamics, and
emotional/developmental outcomes (see Web Appendix 1, avail-
able at https://academic.oup.com/aje). Students named up to 5
male and 5 female friends who were later identified from school-
wide rosters to generate information about each school’s complete
social network. We drew our information about social networks,
experiences of SV, and correlated risk behaviors from questions
available in the wave I, wave II, and wave IV in-home data sets.
Social networks
To identify the friendship networks, we treated each friend-
ship nomination as a “directed tie” from the respondent to the
named friend. Dyadic observations were created based on these
nominations and included data from both the respondent and a
friend at waves I and II for each respondent-friend pair; the
dyadic data structure meant that respondents could appear in
multiple observations (i.e., friendship dyads)—as both the nomi-
nating respondent and as the friend—and that the same friend
pairing can appear in 2 observations if each respondent in the
pairing is listed as the respondent in one and the friend in the
other. Sibling dyads and dyads with missing data were removed
from the data set. We further restricted the data set to female-
female relationships because our primary outcome and primary
predictor was a measure of SV that was only asked of female re-
spondents, leaving a sample of 3,139 girl dyads based on 1,658
individual interviews (see Web Appendix 2).
Measures
Experience of SV.
Respondents in wave I and wave II who
reported having sexual intercourse were asked to report SV with
the question, “Were you ever physically forced to have sexual
intercourse against your will?” Sexual intercourse was defined as
follows: “When we say sexual intercourse, we mean when a male
inserts his penis into a female’s vagina.” In wave IV, they were
asked 2 questions. 1) “Have you ever been forced, in a nonphysi-
cal way, to have any type of sexual activity against your will? For
example, through verbal pressure, threats of harm, or by being
given alcohol or drugs? Do not include any experiences with a
parent or adult caregiver.” 2) “Have you ever been physically
forced to have any type of sexual activity against your will? Do
not include any experiences with a parent or adult caregiver.”
Because there were relatively few changes in responses
between wave I and II, we collapsed responses to create a
binary measure of whether or not a respondent experienced
SV by wave II (“adolescent SV”). We considered a respon-
dent to be a victim of young-adult SV in wave IV if they re-
sponded yes to either of the 2 questions regarding verbal or
physical coercion. Although respondent’s reports of SV in
adolescence and adulthood were our primary dependent vari-
ables, a friend’s report of SV in adolescence was our primary
independent variable (see Web Appendix 3).

 Substance use risk score.
In a comprehensive section on
substance use in wave I and II, adolescents were asked a variety
of detailed questions about prior and current substance use related
to alcohol use, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, and binge drink-
ing (see Web Appendix 3 for exact questions). Wave-IV respon-
dents were asked similar questions.
We coded 6 separate dichotomous substance use outcomes
from questions asked in waves I and II to represent either hav-
ing engaged in the behavior or not. Cronbach’s α on these mea-
sures as a scale was 0.80. We then used an item response theory
model to create a combined risk score for each girl using these
questions (see Web Appendix 4).
Many of the substance use questions were changed in wave
IV, and the questions that were available did not cluster into a
reasonable index. We therefore used 2 dichotomous yes or no
questions on problem drinking and marijuana use. Smoking in
wave IV was assessed using the same question that was asked
in waves I and II. Substance use by friends was a primary inde-
pendent variable for the dependent variables of SV in adolescence
and young adulthood.
Network connectedness.
Using the igraph library in R
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria),
we calculated 2 individual-level network centrality measures
for each respondent in each school. Degree (30) is the total
number of unique social contacts that nominate or are nomi-
nated by the respondent. The second measure, eigenvector
centrality (31), is a measure of popularity that assumes the
centrality of a given individual is an increasing function of
the centralities of all the individuals that support her (see
Web Appendix 4). Network connectedness was our second-
ary dependent variable, with experience of SV as its primary
independent variable.
We included respondent age and race/ethnicity (white,
Hispanic, black, or Asian), as well as mothers’ self-reported
education and household income as covariates in the analyses.
Statistical analyses
We conducted a series of logistic regression analyses using
friendship dyads as the unit of analysis. We first tested the asso-
ciation between respondent and friend risk scores for adolescent
substance use. We then tested whether a friend reporting SV in
waves I/II was a predictor of a respondent’s report of SV, first in
waves I/II (n = 3,139) then in wave IV (n = 2,732). It should be
noted that the measure used in waves I/II was limited to forced
physical sex, whereas that used in wave IV included coercion.
We used generalized estimating equation procedures, clustering
on individual respondents, to account for multiple observations
of the same respondent across respondent-friend pairings and
assumed an independent working correlation structure for the
clusters. The generalized estimating equation regression models
in the tables presented in the main text and Web Tables 2–5 pro-
vide parameter estimates in the form of β coefficients. Because
associations between friends’ behaviors could be the result
of neighborhood, school, or other contextual factors related to
geographic proximity, we also conducted all analyses with and
without school fixed effects. Inclusion of fixed effects effectively
eliminates any spurious correlations that may arise because of
between-school variation in the incidence of the dependent vari-
ables. However, this inclusion could mask friendship network
associations, so we also included analyses without the school-
level fixed effects (32).
For the analysis of wave IV data, we only included respon-
dents who did not report a history of SV in waves I or II; because
the wave-IV questions did not specify when in a respondent’s
life the violence occurred, reports of SV at wave IV could reflect
SV that occurred at either wave I or II or sometime after. This
sample of dyads allowed us to look for a relationship between
new reports of SV from individuals who did not report SV in the
earlier wave I and wave II surveys and the SV status of those in-
dividuals’ friends. The wave-IV analysis therefore allowed us to

 examine whether there was evidence that SV travels through the
friendship network observed earlier.
We then ran a separate set of individual level logistic regres-
sion models (nondyadic n = 1,459) in which we considered the
network position of a respondent in wave II as a function of her
experience of SV in wave I, controlling for her network position
in wave I. Because the network centrality measures were heavily
skewed, we dichotomized the measures to categorize respon-
dents as above or below the mean of each measure.
RESULTS
A total of 8% of respondents reported having experienced
SV in adolescence: 5% in wave I and an additional 3% in wave
II. By wave IV, that proportion had increased to 20%. Table 1
shows the summary statistics for our sample, and Web Table 1
shows a summary of our item response theory model, including
the prevalence of risk behaviors in our sample. In waves I and
II, 45% of respondents reported the use of alcohol, 29% re-
ported the use of tobacco, 15% reported the use of marijuana,
27% reported binge drinking, 12% reported regret because of
drinking, and 8% reported regret because of sexual behavior
while drinking. The latent variable from the item response the-
ory model allowed us to discriminate between respondents who
engaged in various combinations of risk-taking behaviors by
using all of the information from these 6 indicators and then
comparing those behaviors systematically between friends.
We first considered whether a respondent’s substance use
risk score was predicted by her friends’ substance use risk

 scores. Table 2 shows that a friend’s overall risk score sig-
nificantly predicted the respondent’s risk score, even with all
demographic and fixed effect controls included (for bivariate
results see Web Table 2). The risk score is a normally distrib-
uted latent variable with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Each 1-point increase in a friend’s risk score is equivalent to a
1-standard-deviation change in this variable. For such a
change, the respondent’s risk score increases by 0.24 standard
deviations, showing that, on average, only 76% of the respon-
dent’s risk score is explained by her own characteristics, whereas
24% is explained by her friend’s risk score.
We next considered the outcome of SV in adolescence by
wave II. Model 1 in Table 3 shows that each 1-point increase in
the friend’s risk score increased a respondent’s odds of SV by
1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.36) even after adjust-
ment for her own risk score (see Web Table 3 for bivariate re-
sults). Each one-point increase in the respondent’s risk score
increased her odds of reporting SV by 1.72 (95% confidence
interval: 1.41, 2.09). In model 2, a friend’s report of SV increased
the respondent’s odds of experiencing SV by 1.95 (95% confi-
dence interval: 1.25, 3.07). Figure 1 depicts the social network
of girls in 1 school, with clustering of SV and risk scores
between socially connected girls. In model 3, the association
between a friend’s report of SV and a respondent’s odds of
experiencing SV decreased in magnitude and significance
with the inclusion of respondent’s and friend’s risk factors,
although the direction of association was the same. When we
added in the school-level fixed effects, we found that the associa-
tion with a friend having experienced SV became insignificant,
potentially because of significant school-level determinants on
SV. Fixed effects removed between-school variation, which was
substantially important in explaining the patterns we observe. The
fixed-effects estimator should be considered a conservative result.
A multilevel model log likelihood test showed a significant
school-level association, which supported this possibility.
We next considered the outcome of experiencing SV in young
adulthood in wave IV. In Table 4, we show thatif a friend reported
SV in adolescence by wave II, a respondent had 1.54 times the
odds of reporting SV by wave IV (95% confidence interval: 1.00,
2.37) (see Web Table 4 for bivariate results). Adolescent sub-
stance use risk scores for respondents or friends were not associ-
ated with this outcome, but adult substance use was. These results
were robust to the inclusion of demographic control variables.
Finally, we considered the outcome of adolescent network
connectedness at wave II for those who reported prior SV at
wave I. In Table 5, we show the results of a set of individual
(nondyadic) logistic regressions in which we used SV expe-
rience as a predictor of network centrality (see Web Table 5

lence are indicated in pink, and those who had not are indicated in blue. The large-sized nodes represent girls who had above average risk scores,
and the smaller sized nodes represent girls with below average scores. Square nodes represent girls who had a friend who experienced sexual vio-
lence. Note that the pink nodes are likely to be large and square. Also note the clustering of large square nodes, which represent high-risk girls who
had not experienced sexual violence themselves but who had friends who did.

 for bivariate results). After we controlled for whether or not a
respondent was above or below the mean centrality in wave
I, demographic characteristics, risk score, and school-level
fixed effects, we found that experiencing SV by wave II was
associated with a greater likelihood of being below the mean
degree (i.e., fewer friends) and below the mean eigenvector
centrality (i.e., lower overall popularity) in wave II. Figure 2
is a loess plot showing that the probability of experiencing
SV increased with lower eigenvector centrality.
DISCUSSION
Overall, our findings suggest that the risk of SV among adoles-
cent girls is socially clustered and that the occurrence of SV is also
associated with behavioral risks such as substance use that occur
within social networks. Our findings suggest that if a respondent
has a friend who has experienced SV, she is also more likely to
have experienced SV. However, this association is dampened
when school-level fixed effects are included, which suggests that

 the significant association of SV experience between socially con-
nected girls might be explained by school-level factors, including
school- or community-level descriptive norms (32). Thus, school-
wide social norms related to SV may play a significant role in
determining respondents’ risks of experiencing SV. In addition,
adolescents who reported substance use were more likely to asso-
ciate with others who did, and both a respondent’s substance use
as well as her friends’ substance use was predictive of the respon-
dent’s risk for SV. Substance use may therefore be indicative of a
social risk environment in which perpetration of SV is more likely
to occur. These results hold with school-level fixed effects, pro-
viding clues toward friendship clustering of behavior.
Although our discussion is focused on the nexus of risk
factors that includes SV, we are not making claims about the
causality of the relationship; rather, we are observing the cluster-
ing of certain risk factors associated with SV and the continua-
tion of risks in time periods after adolescence. These findings
suggest that sharing a social context or network in which SV oc-
curs is associated with an increase in a girl’s risk of experiencing
SV. The social clustering may be indicative of risk environments
in which SV perpetration is more likely to occur, as well as a
normalization of SV within that social context. That there seems
to be significant variation in the proportion of respondents who
experience SV across schools supports such a possibility. Although
neighborhood effects could also cause school-level associations,
not all adolescents attend schools within their neighborhoods.
The persistent association between a friend’s risk behavior and a
girl’s experience of SV supports the likelihood that school-level
social norms are at play and that school-level efforts may
address norms permissive of SV.
We also show that there is a directional relationship between
experience of SV and network connectivity: Respondents who
reported SV by wave II also became less central by wave II, even
after adjustment for their social position in wave I. This result
suggests a downward social trajectory for girls who are already
victims of a traumatic act of violence.
It is possible that this finding does not suggest a negative out-
come (girls may have fewer but closer friendships). However, a
number of studies have highlighted the psychosocial and mental
health consequences (e.g., depression, anxiety, posttraumatic
stress disorder) of SV and how these may affect girls’ attachment
and trust in relationships including the possibility of social with-
drawal as a maladaptive coping strategy (33–35). Our study is
among the first to demonstrate that SV specifically affects girls’
social connectivity.
Limitations and strengths
Our analyses have several limitations. First, we do not
know the personal or social networks characteristics of the
perpetrators who committed the violence against these girls.
Although in some cases it may be friends, in others it may be
adults outside of or within the school environment. Second, any
measure of a sensitive nature will be understandably susceptible
to response bias; therefore, we potentially underestimated the
actual extent of SV within this population. Relatedly, the act of
reporting abuse may be a behavior that clusters in the social net-
works of these individuals, which might influence our results.
Third, the wave-I and wave-II data are relatively old (collected
in the 1990s); however, the use of this data set allowed us to fol-
low individuals into adulthood. Although there has been increas-
ing attention to SV among adolescents and college students across
the United States, there is no reason to believe that this phenome-
non or its risk factors have changed significantly since that time.
Fourth, although school-level fixed effects may to some degree
adjust for neighborhood influences, they are an imperfect proxy
given the likelihood of attending a school out of neighborhood.
Despite these limitations, the present study provides a un-
ique and important lens through which to view a serious prob-
lem that has gained increasing attention over the past several
years. Although intuitively we expect that cultures of SV grow
and are maintained within socially connected groups of peo-
ple, we have little quantitative evidence to support this infer-
ence. This analysis provides important evidence of the need
to address SV within social contexts while addressing the social
clustering of associated risk factors as well. Not only did we see
a significant association within friend relationships, but we
also found that these associations varied across schools,
which suggests that schools may have a role in maintaining
norms, either negative or positive. Network-based interven-
tions within schools may be a powerful strategy for reduction
of SV against adolescent girls.
