Objectives To inform healthcare workforce policy 
decisions by showing how patient perceptions of hospital 
care are associated with confidence in nurses and doctors, 
nurse staffing levels and hospital work environments.
Design Cross-sectional surveys of 66 348 hospital 
patients and 2963 inpatient nurses.
setting Patients surveyed were discharged in 2010 
from 161 National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England. 
Inpatient nurses were surveyed in 2010 in a sample of 46 
hospitals in 31 of the same 161 trusts.
Participants The 2010 NHS Survey of Inpatients obtained 
information from 50% of all patients discharged between 
June and August. The 2010 RN4CAST England Nurse 
Survey gathered information from inpatient medical and 
surgical nurses.
Main outcome measures Patient ratings of their hospital 
care, their confidence in nurses and doctors and other 
indicators of their satisfaction. Missed nursing care was 
treated as both an outcome measure and explanatory 
factor.
results Patients’ perceptions of care are significantly 
eroded by lack of confidence in either nurses or doctors, 
and by increases in missed nursing care. The average 
number of types of missed care was negatively related to 
six of the eight outcomes—ORs ranged from 0.78 (95% 
CI 0.68 to 0.90) for excellent care ratings to 0.86 (95% 
CI 0.77 to 0.95) for medications completely explained—
positively associated with higher patient-to-nurse ratios 
(b=0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.19), and negatively associated 
with better work environments (b=−0.26, 95% CI −0.48 to 
−0.04).
conclusions Patients’ perceptions of hospital care are 
strongly associated with missed nursing care, which in 
turn is related to poor professional nurse (RN) staffing and 
poor hospital work environments. Improving RN staffing 
in NHS hospitals holds promise for enhancing patient 
satisfaction.
IntrODuctIOn
Highly publicised reports citing prevent-
able deaths and deficiencies in hospital 
care in England have uniformly concluded 
that inadequate hospital professional nurse 
(RN) staffing is a contributing factor.1–3 
Studies confirm large variation in patient 
to RN ratios across National Health Service 
(NHS) hospitals, and this variation is asso-
ciated with higher mortality in hospitals 
where RNs care for more patients each.4–6 
However, despite national guidance on safe 
nurse staffing,7 substantial variation still 
exists and the value of higher RN staffing 
levels is still questioned at the policy level.8 
Recently introduced NHS workforce initia-
tives have been framed in the unsubstanti-
ated narrative that quality deficiencies in 
hospitals are due to ‘uncaring’ nurses.9 10 
The National Advisory Group on the Safety of 
Patients in England specifically advised that 
nurses and other NHS staff not be blamed 
for quality deficits, pointing instead to the 
need to address insufficient RN staffing.3 
Nevertheless, new workforce initiatives have 
been introduced by the NHS purportedly 
to produce more caring nurses. One such 
initiative creates a new provider category, 
the nursing associate, with substantially 
lower qualifications than RNs.11 Adding 
lesser trained providers to the hospital work-
force without adding more RNs results in 
eroding the nursing skill mix that evidence 
suggests is associated with higher mortality 
and lower patient satisfaction.12 Also, the 
NHS is reinstating apprentice training for

Research
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This is the first quantitative study to determine the 
association between patients’ confidence in nurses 
and doctors, RN staffing, and patient experiences 
with hospital care in National Health Service (NHS) 
hospitals in England using the national NHS Adult 
Inpatient Survey.
 
► Unique data previously unavailable enable a rigorous 
analysis of patient to RN staffing ratios, missed 
nursing care and patient satisfaction with hospital 
care.
 
► The study uses cross-sectional data, and while a 
number of alternative explanations are considered 
in our models, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
omitted variables contribute to associations found.

RNs,13 in direct opposition to a major recommendation 
of the 2010 Prime Minister’s Commission on the Future 
of Nursing and Midwifery in England14 that all nursing 
education should take place in universities because 
evidence shows that hospitals with a higher proportion 
of bachelors-prepared nurses have significantly better 
patient outcomes.6 15 16 
The concern about nurses being uncaring or lacking 
in compassion, and subsequent NHS nursing initiatives, 
have come about largely in response to case studies of 
poor care in a relatively small number of NHS trusts and 
anecdotal reports of patient dissatisfaction. Surprisingly, 
little use has been made of the NHS National Inpatient 
Survey of patients to inform strategies to improve care.17 
When initiated in 2001, England’s annual national survey 
of patients following a hospital inpatient stay was the first 
in the world; it aimed to make the NHS more patient-cen-
tred and more responsive to patient feedback.18 A report 
published in 2007 using the NHS Inpatient Survey found 
evidence that the experiences of staff working in the NHS 
mirrored the experiences of patients receiving care.19 
This is a worrisome finding given the evidence showing 
high nurse burnout and job dissatisfaction is common in 
NHS hospitals,10 20 and that 85% of RNs in NHS hospi-
tals report not being able to complete needed nursing 
care due to lack of time associated with high patient-to-
nurse workloads.21 Furthermore, missed nursing care 
associated with high patient-to-nurse workloads is associ-
ated with an increased risk of patient mortality following 
common surgical procedures in nine European countries 
including England.22
Studies of patients’ experiences with inpatient care 
in the USA, another country with mandated hospital 
patient satisfaction surveys, reveal that better RN staffing 
is associated with higher overall patient ratings of their 
hospitals.23 24 Missed nursing care is associated with less 
favourable patient satisfaction in the US hospitals25 and 
in some European hospitals (not including England).26 
There are not comparable studies in England using the 
NHS National Inpatient Survey that could help determine 
whether better RN staffing and better clinical hospital 
work environments are associated with more favourable 
patient experience with hospital care.
This paper seeks to identify an action agenda that may 
hold promise for improving patients’ experiences with 
hospital care in England. Specifically, we first provide 
evidence of the importance of RNs to patients using 
data from a large sample of patients in NHS hospitals 
in England to show how patients’ experience with care 
is strongly related to their confidence in nurses as well 
as doctors, and their perceptions of whether there were 
enough nurses in their hospitals. We then use data from 
patients and nurses in a subset of these hospitals to show 
how lower nurse workloads and better nurse work envi-
ronments are related to less missed nursing care and 
how, in turn, less missed nursing care is related to better 
patients’ experience with their care.
MethODs
Data sources and samples
Patient survey data are from the 2010 NHS Survey of 
Inpatients, which gathered information from over 66 000 
patients who were discharged from 161 acute and specialist 
NHS trusts in England.27 Nurse survey data are from the 
2010 RN4CAST-England study,20 28 which gathered infor-
mation from 2963 inpatient medical and surgical direct 
care RNs in a representative sample of 31 of the same 161 
NHS trusts. These 31 trusts comprise 46 different hospi-
tals from which 12 581 of the 66 348 patients surveyed 
were discharged. Of these 12 851 patients, 5311 were in 
general medicine or general surgery wards. The sample 
of hospitals in which nurses were surveyed, described 
elsewhere in detail,21 28 was a stratified random sample 
selected to include teaching and non-teaching hospitals 
of different sizes in every geographic region of England. 
There are no remarkable differences between the sample 
of hospitals in which nurses were surveyed and the other 
hospitals participating in the NHS Survey of Inpatients, 
nor were there any differences in patient characteristics 
or responses between the full NHS survey and the 31 
trusts studied, as noted in the (online supplementary 
appendix) . The response rate for the NHS patient survey 
was 50%. The response rate for the nurse survey was 
37%. The nurse survey has good established predictive 
validity in previous research,6 29 showing, for example, 
that nurses’ reports of quality of care are closely associ-
ated with patient mortality derived from independent 
data sources.30
Patients were not participants in the initial design of 
the overall study, but were actively engaged in the devel-
opment of measures of patients’ experiences with care 
used in the study. The Picker Institute, developers of 
the NHS Adult Inpatient Survey, employed patient focus 
groups and cognitive interviews with patients during pilot 
testing. Patients were offered one page to describe what 
they thought of the inpatient questionnaire and which 
aspects of patient care were most important to them. 
The qualitative research did not identify major questions 
missing from the survey but it did lead to minor modifi-
cations that were incorporated.31 Patients in our study are 
anonymous. We have a detailed plan to disseminate the 
study results through print, broadcast and social media 
in every participating country. The authors gratefully 
acknowledge the contributions of participating patients 
in the 'Acknowledgements' section.
Analysis strategy
These data were used to undertake three distinct but 
related analyses. First, we use patient data from all 161 
trusts to describe how patients rated their care, how their 
ratings varied depending on their perceptions of whether 
there were enough nurses on duty to provide needed 
care and how they were as much a function of their confi-
dence in nurses as their confidence in doctors. We then 
used the nurse data from the 46 hospitals in the 31 trusts 
to describe the variation in RN staffing and hospital work

environments, and then used least-squares regression 
models with and without control variables to show how 
lower RN staffing levels and poorer work environments 
are related to needed but missed nursing care. Finally, 
since patient survey data were only available at the trust 
level, we merged the nurse data from the 31 trusts with 
patient data from those same trusts and used logistic 
regression models to estimate whether and to what extent 
the overall level of missed nursing care in the different 
trusts affect patients’ ratings of their care and their confi-
dence in nurses, before and after controlling for poten-
tial confounds. Because the nurse survey was restricted to 
nurses on medical and surgical units, this final step of the 
analysis was restricted to patients in general surgical and 
medical wards (5311 out of 12 851 patients in the study 
trusts).
results
nurses, doctors and patient ratings of care
Table 1 and figure 1 use data from 66 348 patients in 
161 trusts collected in the 2010 NHS Survey of Inpa-
tients to show how patients’ ratings of their care are 
highly associated with their confidence in nurses and 
in doctors, and with their perceptions of whether there 
were enough nurses to provide needed care. The first 
column of table 1 shows that more than three-fourths of 
patients responding to the NHS survey reported having 
confidence and trust in the doctors and nurses treating 
them, while only 60% reported that there were always or 
nearly always enough nurses to care for them. The second 
column of table 1 shows the percentages of patients that 
rated their care as excellent, based on how much confi-
dence and trust they had in their nurses and doctors, 
and their perceptions of the adequacy of the number of 
nurses caring for them. Hospital care was rated excellent 
by over half of the patients who indicated that they always 
had confidence and trust in their doctors or confidence 
and trust in their nurses, but by only 3% of the patients 
who never had confidence and trust in their doctors or in 
their nurses. Similarly, hospital care was rated as excellent 
by over half of the patients who indicated that there were 
always enough nurses to care for them, but by far lower 
percentages of patients who said there were only some-
times enough, or rarely or never enough, nurses.

While table 1 makes it clear that nurses, like doctors, are 
importantly related to patients’ perceptions of the quality 
of their care, figure 1 shows more directly that confidence 
and trust in nurses is of similar importance to confidence 
and trust in doctors. In figure 1, we show the per cent of 
patients that rated their care ‘excellent’ after grouping 
the patients into four categories, to distinguish patients 
who always have confidence and trust in both doctors and 
nurses, in doctors but not nurses, nurses but not doctors 
and neither doctors not nurses. Sixty per cent of patients 
who have confidence and trust in both doctors and nurses 
rate their care as excellent, while only 3% of patients who 
have confidence and trust in neither rate their care as 
excellent. When confidence and trust in either group 
erodes, the result is virtually identical. Only 16% of the 
patients who have confidence and trust in their doctors 
but not nurses rate their care as excellent, and only 17% 
of the patients who have confidence and trust in their 
nurses but not doctors rate their care as excellent.
nurse staffing, work environments and missed nursing care
Nurse (RN) staffing was estimated for the 46 hospitals 
included in RN4CAST-England by average nurse work-
loads in each hospital on the day shift. Nurses reported 
how many patients they cared for on their last shift, and 
then responses are averaged across all nurses in each 
hospital working the day shift. Nurse workloads aver-
aged 8.6 patients per RN during the day, and ranged 
from 5.6 patients per RN to 11.5 patients per RN across 
the 46 hospitals. Patient-to-RN ratios were much higher 
and more variable at night so we elected to use day shift 
staffing only in our analyses.
Hospital work environment was measured by the Prac-
tice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index, an 
extensively used survey-based measure with established 
reliability and validity32–35 leading to its adoption by 
the National Quality Forum as a nurse sensitive quality 
of care indicator.36 The measure of work environment 
used is a composite measure formed from five subscales 
(comprising 28 nurse survey items) measuring resource 
adequacy (four items), nurse participation in hospital 
affairs (eight items), nursing foundations for quality 
care (nine items), nurse manager ability, leadership and 
support of nurses (four items) and nurse-physician rela-
tions (three items). The staffing and resource adequacy 
subscale was dropped from the global measure used in 
the analysis because of its high correlation with the direct 
measure of RN staffing in the model, as in previous publi-
cations.12 37
What makes the variability in staffing and work environ-
ments across hospitals of considerable importance is that 
when RNs have high patient loads, and when RNs practice 
in poor work environments, necessary nursing care can 
be missed because of lack of time.21 Nurses in this study 
were asked whether any of 13 important types of nursing 
care were needed but missed because of lack of time. 
Figure 2 shows that while 7% of nurses reported that they 
lacked time to complete necessary pain management, and 
11% missed treatments and procedures, much greater 
percentages reported lacking the time to educate patients 
and their families (52%) and comfort or talk with their 
patients (65%). More than a quarter of the nurses (27%) 
lacked the time to complete three or four of the types of 
care listed, just under one in five (19%) lacked the time 
to complete five or six of them, and another 19% lacked 
the time to complete seven or more of the 13 types of 
care listed.
Table 2 provides regression coefficients that indicate the 
effects of RN staffing and the hospital work environment 
on the average number of types of missed care, before 
and after controlling for various hospital characteristics 
(including size, technology and location), and charac-
teristics of nurses that may have affected their reports 
of missed care, including their role (primary nurse or 
shared responsibility for group of patients with other 
nurses), full-time status, years of experience and unit type 
(medical, surgical or combined). Higher nurse workloads 
(higher patient-to-RN ratios) are significantly related to 
higher numbers of types of missed care, while better work 
environments are significantly related to fewer types of 
missed care, both before and after adjustment.
Figures 3 and 4 show how much the number of tasks left 
undone varies as a function of RN staffing and hospital 
work environments, as estimated from the adjusted 
models. As the number of patients per RN goes down, 
from 12 patients to 8 patients to 4 patients, the average 
number of types of missed care goes down, from 4.4 (out 
of 13) to 3.8 to 3.2. And, as hospital work environments 
improve, from relatively poor (lowest tertile) to average 
(middle tertile) to relatively good (highest tertile), the 
average number of types of missed care also goes down, 
from 4.2 to 4.0 to 3.7.
Missed nursing care and patient outcomes
The association of the number of types of missed care 
with patient outcomes is shown in table 3. The coef-
ficients in the table are ORs which indicate how much 
the odds on providing a positive response to the nine 
different dimensions of patient satisfaction go down as 
the average number of types of missed care goes up, both 
before (unadjusted) and after (adjusted) taking account 
patient characteristics that might affect their responses, 
including gender, age, length of stay, ward, number of 
long-standing conditions and type of admission (emer-
gent/urgent or planned). In all cases, the ORs are <1, 
indicating that positive patient appraisals of care decrease 
as the number of types of missed care increases; in six of 
the eight aspects of patient care rated the ORs are signif-
icant, and range from 0.78 to 0.86. These values indicate, 
for example, that in hospitals in which the number of 
types of missed care averaged 4.5 per nurse per shift, the 
odds on patients rating care as excellent and responding 
that the purpose of medicines were completely explained 
were 22% lower and 14% lower, respectively, than in 
hospitals in which the number of types of missed care 
averaged 3.5 per nurse per shift.

evidence that refutes the narrative blaming quality of care 
deficits in NHS hospitals on uncaring nurses. However, 
only 60% of patients indicated that there were always 
enough RNs to care for them, and 1 in 10 patients indi-
cated that there were never or rarely enough RNs. The 
importance to patients of adequate RN staffing is evident 
in their responses; 57% of patients who indicated that 
there were always or nearly always enough RNs to care for 
them rated care as excellent, compared with only 14% of 
the patients who said there were rarely or never enough. 
Additional analyses undertaken (not shown) indicate that 
patients in hospitals with poorer RN staffing are much 
less likely to say there were always enough nurses to care 
for them. We estimate, from models that took account 
of numerous confounds, that the likelihood of patients 
saying there were always enough nurses to take care of 
them were about 40% lower in hospitals in which the 
average nurse took care of 10 patients than in hospitals 
in which the average nurse took care of 6 patients. These 
findings reinforce from patients’ perspectives the impor-
tance of adequate hospital RN staffing.
Further insights into how quality of care might be 
improved in NHS hospitals is revealed when data from 
the NHS Inpatient Survey is linked with information on 
actual hospital RN staffing and nurses’ assessments of the 
quality of their work environments. We found substantial 
variation across NHS general acute hospitals in patient-
to-nurse workloads. Nurses in some NHS hospitals are 
caring for twice as many patients at a time as nurses in 
other hospitals. Current NHS policies devolving greater 
autonomy to hospital management to make decisions 
about RN staffing may be contributing to the substantial 
observed variation in staffing, and have led experts to 
point to the need for checks and balances to minimise 
the risk of more quality failures linked to inadequate RN 
staffing.38 Our findings show that the substantial differ-
ences in RN staffing across NHS hospitals are associated 
with the extent to which needed nursing care is missed. 
The most frequently missed types of care include those 
that patients may readily recognise are missing--com-
forting and talking with patients, and teaching patients 
and family members how to manage care following 
discharge. Our results are consistent with other research 
showing that higher patient workloads for RNs in NHS 
hospitals are associated with adverse patient outcomes 
including higher hospital morality.4 5 22 Initiatives such as 
those recently adopted in Wales39 establishing an upper 
limit to how many patients nurses can safely and effec-
tively care for holds promise for further improvements 
in patients’ satisfaction with hospital care, and may save 
lives as well.
Another modifiable feature of hospital care found to 
be relevant to patients’ perceptions of their care is the 
quality of the hospital work environment. In hospitals 
rated by nurses to have less favourable clinical work envi-
ronments, needed but missed nursing care is more exten-
sive. Patients’ perceptions of care are less favourable when 
missed care is more extensive. Research suggests that 
hospital work environments that support RNs to provide 
care efficiently and effectively, and without constant inter-
ruptions because of operational failures such as missing

medications and equipment,40 are reasonably low cost 
interventions and return good value in terms of better 
patient outcomes at the same or lower costs.41 42 Magnet 
hospitals formally recognised for their good hospital 
work environments have significantly higher patient satis-
faction than matched non-Magnet hospitals.43 One of the 
first Magnet hospitals accredited outside the USA was 
an NHS trust in England, which research showed signifi-
cantly improved its work environment and care quality 
during the process of achieving Magnet accreditation.44 
Unfortunately, the NHS merged the Magnet facility 
out of existence after a year, and there has not been a 
Magnet-accredited hospital in England in over 15 years.
Patients’ confidence in both doctors and nurses is 
equally important in how patients rate their hospitals; few 
patients who have high confidence in their doctors but 
little confidence in their nurses rate their hospitals highly. 
This finding is relevant to policy decisions governing the 
composition of the NHS workforce in England. Between 
2010 and 2015, the number of physician consultants 
(mostly inpatient physicians) increased by more than 
one-fifth while the number of RNs increased by only 1%.45
Our study has many strengths including use of vali-
dated measures of patient satisfaction, nurse staffing, 
hospital work environment and missed nursing care 
across large numbers of NHS hospitals. The study has 
limitations as well. Data from both patients and nurses are 
cross-sectional, thus limiting causal inferences about the 
associations found. We take into account, to the extent 
possible, alternative explanations about factors that could 
be associated with our findings including characteris-
tics of hospitals such as teaching status, and character-
istics of the patients responding to the national survey, 
including their health status since self-reported limiting 
long-term conditions have been found to be associated 
with less favourable perceptions of care.46 Our data are 
from 2010 but remain the only comprehensive data on 
hospital nurse workforce and patient satisfaction across 
large numbers of NHS hospitals in England. Moreover, 
our interest is in the relationship between patient satisfac-
tion and nurse resources, and there is no reason to expect 
the relationship to have changed since 2010. Indeed, Sir 
Robert Francis, author of the public inquiry into quality 
of care deficiencies at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust,1 
commented as recently as July 2017 that safe nurse 
staffing in England still lacks a standardised approach 
and substantial variation across hospitals in nurse staffing 
remains.47
cOnclusIOns
Patients express a high level of confidence and trust in 
nurses, and their satisfaction with hospital care is less 
favourable when they perceive there are not enough 
nurses available. The narrative that quality deficits in 
hospitals in England are due to ‘uncaring’ nurses is not 
supported by the evidence. On the contrary, our findings 
suggest that reducing missed nursing care by ensuring 
adequate numbers of RNs at the hospital bedside and 
improved hospital clinical care environments are prom-
ising strategies for enhancing patient satisfaction with 
care.
