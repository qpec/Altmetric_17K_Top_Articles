ABSTRACT
Background: Systemic enzyme therapy may improve
symptoms of exhaustive eccentric exercise due to anti-
inflammatory properties.
Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled, two-
stage clinical trial, systemic enzyme therapy
(Wobenzym) was administered for 72 hours before and
72 hours following a day on which subjects performed
an exhaustive eccentric exercise (isokinetic loading of
the quadriceps). Efficacy criteria (maximal strength and
pain) and time points were selected to account for the
multidimensional nature of exercise-induced muscle
damage symptoms. Subjects were randomised in a
crossover (stage I, n=28) and parallel group design
(stage II, n=44).
Results: Analysis of stage I data demonstrated a
significant superiority (Mann-Whitney=0.6153;
p=0.0332; one sided) for systemic enzyme therapy
compared with placebo. Stage II was designed as a
randomised controlled parallel group comparison.
Heterogeneity (I2>0.5) between stages led to separate
analyses of stage I (endurance-trained subjects) and
stage II (strength-trained subjects). Combined
analysis resulted in no evidence for corresponding
treatment effects. Analysis of pooled biomarker data,
however, demonstrated significant favourable effects
for systemic enzyme therapy in both
stages.
Conclusion: Systemic enzyme therapy before and
after exhaustive eccentric exercise resulted in higher
maximal concentric strength in the less strength-
trained subjects (stage I) and in significant favourable
effects on biomarkers (inflammatory, metabolic and
immune) in all subjects. The application of these
findings needs further evaluation.
INTRODUCTION
Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD)
and its most common symptom, delayed
onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), impact
an athlete’s training frequency and perfor-
mance.
Strenuous
exercise,
acute
or
postsurgical trauma and certain diseases
can all be sources of skeletal muscle injury.
Regardless
of
the
type
of
injury,
the
general injury and repair mechanism are
similar1 2 and have been well characterised
in EIMD.3–11
Inflammation
contributes
to
fibrosis12
and causes pain that may impair skeletal
muscle function.11 Therefore, it has been
common practice to reduce inflammation
with drugs, such as COX-2 inhibitors. The
problem with this approach is that while
inflammation
causes
further
injury
to
muscles,1 2 13 14 preventing inflammation
may hinder recovery.1
15–17 As a result,
current treatment options for inflamma-
tion are not necessarily effective and, in
some cases, they may be unsafe.
What are the new findings?
" This study confirms a substantial and significant
effect of systemic enzyme therapy (SET) on
fatigue, muscle soreness and damage, as well as
immunological and metabolic biomarkers, in
male sportsmen with medium performance level
(mostly runners and general athletes). Muscle
soreness
and
maximal
strength
were
not
improved in those subjects with a higher level of
strength training at baseline.
" Use of SET showed a significant reduction in
inflammatory biomarkers in sportsmen across all
training levels, indicating an application for SET
in supporting normal inflammatory processes for
muscle recovery.
" Clinicians may recommend the use of SET for
mediating muscle fatigue, reducing soreness and
attenuating potential muscle damage in endur-
ance athletes.

 Systemic enzyme therapy (SET)i allows inflamma-
tory
processes
to
progress
naturally
and
this
overcomes the problem of preventing inflammation
in a manner that may hinder recovery. The antioxi-
dant
rutin
reduces
oxidative
stress
during
inflammation.18

Orally
administered
proteolytic
enzymes, also called proteinases, are mainly absorbed
in the small intestine and are active in body fluids
and tissues as free and bound proteinases, despite
their low concentrations (pmol–nmol).20 Trypsin and
bromelain share two main biological activities with
other proteinases: (i) they degrade proteins by their
proteolytic activity which cleaves peptide bonds at
specific sites, both in digestion and as markers of
cell destruction and inflammation, and (ii) they bind
to specific (eg, a2-antitrypsin) or unspecific (eg, a2-
macroglobulin)
antiproteinases
to
prevent
uncon-
trolled protein degradation.
Accumulating evidence points to a role of protease-
activated receptor 2, expressed on T cells, eosino-
phils, neutrophils and mast cells, in the regulation of
inflammation
and
immune
function.20–23
Further,
both trypsin and bromelain form complexes with a2-
macroglobulin leading to a conformational change
that exposes receptor recognition sites in each of its
four subunits.20
24 These complexes are recognised
by
low-density
lipoprotein
receptor-related
protein
and cell surface glucose-regulated protein (GRP78)
receptors24
on
blood
and
immune
cell
surfaces
resulting in modification of cellular activities25 and
rapid elimination by hepatocytes.20 26 During inflam-
mation the complex of protease and antiprotease is
subject to further modifications.20 Oxidation of the
proteinase antiproteinase complex may serve as a
switch mechanism that downregulates the progression
of acute inflammation by sequestering TNF-a, inter-
leukin
(IL)
2
and
IL-6,
while
upregulating
the
development of tissue repair processes by releasing
bFGF, b-NGF, PDGF and TGF-b.20 Thus, SET may
affect EIMD and DOMS by balancing the inflamma-
tory response to injury.
The influence of oral proteinases on EIMD was
investigated in several clinical trials focusing on pain
and/or muscle function and strength.27–29 Bromelain
and other proteinases may reduce muscle inflamma-
tion after EIMD,1 but controversy persists.27 28 The
aim of the current trial was to investigate the effects
of SET before and after exhaustive eccentric exercise
on functional and biochemical parameters of EIMD
and DOMS in male sportsmen who had a medium
level of performance.
METHODS
Trial design
This
was
designed
as
a
prospective,
randomised,
double-blinded,
placebo-controlled,
two-stage
trial.
Stage I was a crossover with a washout phase of 21 days
between phases; stage II was continued as parallel
group comparison. Subjects were randomised to either
SET or placebo (stage I: n=2�14, crossover; stage II:
n=2�22, parallel group) and involved parties were
blinded, except for the person responsible for interim
(stage I) and final confirmatory analyses. Administra-
tion
of
medication
began
72 hours
before
an
exhaustive eccentric exercise day and continued for
72 hours following the muscle damaging exercise. Each
subject
completed
an
activity
diary
and
a
food
frequency questionnaire. The clinical trial complied
with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by
the local health authority and ethical committee. It was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01845558).
Subjects
Subjects were aged 20–50 years, had a body mass
index between �20 kg/m2 and �32 kg/m2 and had a
moderate performance level and moderate strength
ability defined by a medium concentric strength ability
of 150–300 Nm (newton metre) peak torque maximum
(PTM). Nutritional status was assessed via question-
naire at screening; subjects were asked not to change
nutritional habits; and standardised meals were offered
during the exercise day. Subjects were not to practise
any physical activity (including driving to work by
bicycle) during the study. All physical activities were
documented. Subjects were also instructed to avoid
activities after the exercise such as massages or hot
bathing or showering. Relevant exclusion criteria were
history or presence of any medical disorder, intake of
anti-inflammatory medication, food supplements or
use of other procedures directly affecting muscle func-
tion or performance within 4 weeks prior to or during
trial. Intake of analgesic medication or consumption of
alcohol was not allowed 24 hours prior and until
72 hours after exercise.
Sample size
Non-parametric sample size calculation within the
framework of a multiple outcome approach30–33 was
performed
applying
the
validated
software
Nnpar
V.1.0 (IDV, Gauting, Germany). With the sample size
of 30 subjects, the power calculation for stage I indi-
cated a 64% chance (power of 90%) to detect a
‘medium-sized’ group difference with respect to the
multidimensional test. If neither success nor futility was
formally determined after stage I, a subsequent stage II
could be planned based on the results of stage I
(sample
size
reassessment
with
adaptive
design
features).34 35 Recalculated total sample size for stage
II was 2�22 subjects (one phase, no crossover design).
iWobenzym plus contains 67, 5–76, 5 mg bromelain (standardised to
450 FlP units); 32–48 mg trypsin (standardised to 24 �kat) and 100 mg
rutoside 3 H2O, and is manufactured by Mucos Pharma GmbH &

 Interventions
Subjects were recruited through a telephone question-
naire and invited to the screening visit 2–4 weeks
before exercise to give informed consent and confirm
eligibility. Demographic data, medical history, physical
activity (Freiburger Activity Questionnaire), nutritional
performance status, vital signs and blood samples for
routine parameters were collected.
After a 5 min warm-up period on an ergometer,
the maximal concentric strength of the quadriceps
femoris muscle of the stronger leg, determined at
screening,
was
measured
on
a
desmodrom
(Fa.
Schnell). Three repetitions of 20 maximal concentric
contractions were performed (60 s at 20 oscillations
per minute) with 1 min passive recovery between
sets. The highest value was used for analysis. For
each measurement, peak torque and angle of peak
torque were documented. On day 4 of the trial (visit
1),
EIMD
was
induced
by
exhaustive
eccentric
exercise according to McLeay.36 Maximal eccentric,
isokinetic loading of the right and left quadriceps
femoris was determined by using a desmodrom (Fa.
Schnell) as before, but with the difference of eccen-
tric,
not
concentric,
exercise.
The
same
observer
motivated
all
subjects
following
a
standardised
protocol to avoid interobserver bias.
Trial medication
All subjects received four tablets of SET or placebo of
identical shape and colour three times a day starting
72 hours before exhaustive eccentric exercise day and
for 72 hours post exercise. Trial medication was taken
on an empty stomach 30 min before meals with 250 mL
water. Date and time of intake and time of subsequent
meals were documented in a diary. Residual tablets
were counted to control for compliance.

 Outcome measures
The maximal concentric strength of the M. Quadriceps
femoris of both legs was assessed at screening (2–4 weeks
before visit 1), pre visit 1 (day 0, before start of trial
medication), at visit 1 (day 4 of administration of trial
medication), immediately before (pre) and immediately
after exhaustive eccentric exercise (0 hour), as well as
after 3 hours and 6 hours, and at day 5 (24 hours),
day 6 (48 hours) and day 7 (72 hours). PTM and angle
of
peak
torque
were
measured
as
parameters
of
maximal concentric strength.
Pressure-induced pain (PIP) was assessed by the same
observer for all subjects using a 1 cm2 metal disk
against the middle of the muscle belly. Pressure was
constantly increased until it became unpleasant. PIP
was assessed at the indicated time points and the mean
of three tests was used for analysis.
Biomarkers
Biomarkers
of
muscle
metabolism
and
damage,
inflammatory
and
immune
response,
and
redox status were determined. Samples were taken at
individual time points, stored frozen below �80
�C,
except for lactate and natural killer (NK) cell activity,
and analysed batchwise for each subject after trial
completion according to manufacturer’s instructions,

 if not otherwise indicated. Creatine kinase and lactate
dehydrogenase as markers of muscle damage were
determined
at
Medizinisches
Versorgungszentrum
Leinfelden for samples taken pre-exercise, and at 0,
3, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exercise. Lactate was
determined pre-exercise, and 10 and 30 min after
exercise taken by capillary blood samples by trial site.
Inflammatory response was investigated as IL-6 (pre-
exercise, and 0, 3 and 24 hours after exercise) (Quan-
tikine High Sensitivity ELISA; R&D Systems) and
prostaglandin E derived from cyclooxygenase 2 (pre-
exercise, and 3, 6 and 24 hours) (Prostaglandin E
Metabolite EIA kit; Cayman Chemical) at BioTeSys,
Esslingen. Immune function was investigated by IL-2
inducible NK cell activity (pre, 3 hours, 24 hours) at
the Institut f€
ur Medizinische Diagnostik, Berlin.37 38
Total antioxidative status (TAS) and total oxidative
status (TOS) (pre, 3 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours) were
assessed using a photometric test assay (ImAnOx
[TAS/TAC] Kit; perOS [TOS/TOC] Kit; Immundiag-
nostik AG, Bensheim, Germany).
Safety assessments
Blood samples for routine laboratory tests, including
haemogram, liver enzymes, lipids, glucose, uric acid
and creatinine, were taken at screening, before, and 24
and 72 hours after exercise and analysed by Synlab
Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum Leinfelden. Vital
signs were determined at all visits. Concomitant medi-
cation and adverse events were documented.
Statistical analysis
As no single measure captures the multidimensional
nature of recovery from EIMD, the combination of
single efficacy endpoints reduction of maximal strength
(PTM) and PIP was chosen to be evaluated by a multi-
variate, directional test approach in stage I of the
trial.39
The multiple level alpha of the trial (multiple level of
significance) was defined as a=0.025 (one sided). The
confirmatory analyses were performed with the inten-
tion-to-treat population. Missing values were replaced
by last observation carried forward technique. Results
are given as p values and effect size measures with
their
CIs
(Mann-Whitney
(MW)
statistic
as
corre-
sponding effect size measure of the Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test). The traditional benchmarks for the MW
effect size measure are as follows: 0.29 = large inferi-
ority,
0.36

medium
inferiority,
0.44
=
small
inferiority, 0.50 = equality, 0.56 = small superiority,
0.64

superiority
and
0.71

Multiple a priori ordered hypothesis testing was
performed as a two-stage procedure30 40 41 including
the possibility to stop the trial after stage I due to
success (proof of efficacy) (p1�a1=0.0102) and futility

 (p1�a0=0.5) or to plan stage II of the trial based on
results of stage I, including reassessment of sample size
and finalisation of the trial design. This procedure
based on Fisher’s combination test shows only negli-
gible loss in test power compared with fixed sample
size trials42 and uses the adjusted value a1=0.0102 as a
critical value for the test of stage I.34 Recalculated total
sample size for stage II was 2�22 subjects with no
crossover design.
RESULTS
Trial population
In stage I, 30 subjects were enrolled between 20 April
20 and 1 August 2013, and 28 subjects (safety popula-
tion) were treated in a crossover design. Per protocol
(PP) analysis consisted of 26 subjects (figure 1).
In stage II, a total of 44 subjects were enrolled
between 15 May and 27 July 2014. The safety popula-
tion was comprised of all enrolled and treated subjects
(n=44). The PP population (41 subjects; SET: 20;
placebo: 21) resulted from exclusion of two subjects
due to protocol violation (timing of PTM >20% and
severe violation of screening PTM) (figure 1).
Stage I
The PTM and PIP results for both treatment groups
(all subjects pooled) compared with mean baseline
values are provided in figure 2.
As expected, PTM is reduced in the ‘acute’ phase at
3 hours (3.4%; 201 Nm) and 6 hours (4.8%; 198 Nm)
after exhaustive eccentric exercise compared with base-
line
(100%;
208 Nm)
(figure
2A).
However,
during’recovery’
phase
(24–48 hours),
the
average
PTM returns to 205 Nm at 24 hours and to 209 Nm at
48 hours, the level before exercise. Thus, the potential
to discover
differences
between
two
treatments
is
substantially reduced beyond 24 hours. PIP measured
by
algometry
(both
treatment
groups
combined)
resulted in a reduction of pain threshold after exhaus-
tive eccentric exercise in both phases (figure 2B).
The PTM results in stage I (phase 1) with SET or
placebo are shown in figure 3. Exhaustive eccentric
exercise led to a reduction in PTM in the SET group
of 2.8% at 3 hours and 1.5% at 6 hours compared with
placebo of 6.2%, 10% and 5.7% at 3, 6 and 24 hours,
respectively. Physical performance returned to baseline
at 24 hours with SET but not until 48 hours with
placebo. The associated MW effect size indicated more
than
‘small’
superiority
of
the
SET
group
(MW=0.6153, p=0.0332) compared with placebo.
Stage II
In contrast to stage I, confirmatory analysis of both
hypotheses of stage II resulted in no evidence for
corresponding
treatment
effects
(hypothesis
1:
p=0.8596, hypothesis 2: p=0.8783, both one sided).
As shown in figure 4, there is ‘severe’ heterogeneity
between both stages for both hypotheses (hypothesis 1:
MW=0.6153 vs MW=0.4379; I2=0.7692, p=0.0374;
hypothesis 2: MW=0.5917 vs MW=0.4267; I2=0.6778,
p=0.0781). As both I2 values are above 0.5, indicating
‘large’ heterogeneity, results are to be interpreted
separately for each stage.
Biomarkers
Pooled biomarker analysis at 3 hours after exercise
demonstrated significant advantages for SET compared
with placebo (stage I: p=0.0011; stage II: p=0.0114)
(figure 5) and no heterogeneity (I2=0.0) between
stages I and II. Stage I and II combined biomarker

 effect size shows significant and ‘more than small’ supe-
riority of the SET group (MW=0.5847, p=0.0001)
compared with the placebo group (figure 5).
Safety
In stage I, out of 16 single adverse events, only one was
characterised as ‘possibly’ related (diarrhoea, SET). In
stage II, two single adverse events, one possibly related
to SET (acne-like rush at chin and mild pruritus), were
reported. No adverse event was ‘serious.’ Both events
related to SET were characterised as mild and resolved.
In both stages, there were no clinically relevant find-
ings in any of the treatment groups. SET is well
tolerated at the dosage of 3�4 tablets per day.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrated the superiority of SET compared
with placebo in maintaining strength and reducing
pain in response to exhaustive eccentric exercise (acute
phase, stage I). Stage II data were evaluated separately
due
to
significant
heterogeneity
(I2>0.5)
and,
in
contrast to stage I, did not result in differences of SET
or placebo on EIMD. Biomarkers responded to SET
across both study stages.
Strengths and limitations
The trial was carefully planned using a multidimen-
sional
approach
for
outcome
assessment
and
classification, taking into account the multidimensional
aspect of recovery from EIMD. Additionally, a two-
stage approach with interim analysis and continuation
with refined hypotheses and readjusted sample size
offered
all
opportunities
to
finalise
the
trial
successfully.
Surprisingly, the preplanned test for carryover effects
was statistically significant on the defined level a1
(p=0.0092, one sided, Wei-Lachin procedure, Bauer-
K€
ohne a1=0.0102) in stage I. Thus, according to statis-
tical plan, only phase 1 data from stage I could be used
for
non-parametric
confirmatory
analysis,
and
the
crossover approach had to be abandoned in stage II in
favour of a parallel group comparison. One possible
explanation for carryover effects is that impairment of
muscle function could have been influenced by recent,
that is, within some months,43 high-force eccentric
work using the same muscle(s). This effect is commonly
referred to as the ‘repeated-bout effect.’44 However, as
EIMD during the current trial was only mild, the
washout phase during the eccentric exercise sessions
should have been sufficient to avoid a repeated bout
effect. A carryover effect from SET to placebo cannot
be excluded as irreversible changes of cell surface
receptors
of
blood
and
immune
cells
have
been
reported.20 21 23
Stages I and II revealed ‘severe’ heterogeneity even
though inclusion criteria were unchanged at screening
for both stages at PTM 150–300 Nm and a variability
of
below
20%.
Large
interindividual
variation
in
response to eccentric exercise is commonly reported.45
EIMD should even be higher in this age range as the
magnitude of muscle damage is increased from pread-
olescent,
adolescent
to
postadolescent
men.46
Flexibility,47 48 eccentric peak and end-range torque49
as well as angle of peak torque (cf. the joint angle–
torque relationship) are further factors contributing
generally to a variety of EIMD responses.50 Addition-
ally,

Study model may be limited in ability to observe a
functional response in more strength-trained athletes
A closer look at single subject data at baseline revealed
differences between stages in the number of main disci-
plines and training duration per week (table 1).
Participants in stage I were primarily runners/joggers
(endurance training) whereas participants in stage II
primarily focused on strength (resistance) training.
The duration of weekly strength training was reported
at nearly three times for stage II compared with stage I
(179 vs 61 min). Further, overall training duration
across all disciplines was higher in stage II than stage I
(482 vs 369 min). Therefore, stage II participants were
more well trained than stage I participants, particularly
related to strength (resistance) exercises. This may
increase PTM by higher physical performance and by
increase in pain threshold or the ability to increase
PTM despite pain. Insensitivity of the study model to
detect advantages of SET might have been caused by
these differences in baseline resistance training. It has
been suggested to report individual data and to classify
subjects, for example, low, medium/moderate or high
responders, to allow for a better presentation and
interpretation of the data.49 51
Biomarker data confirm anti-inflammatory effects of SET
In contrast to functional parameters PTM and PIP,
biomarker analysis resulted in a significant and ‘more
than small’ superiority of the SET group compared
with placebo group in single stages and both stages
combined. Cytokines may play a relatively minor role
in regulating the health benefits of low-intensity exer-
cise, such as brisk walking.55 In contrast, marathon
running induces high physiological stress and a large
cytokine response56 as a more generalised response to
internal and/or external stress. Factors such as oxida-
tive
or
nitrosative
stress,
damaged
or
unfolded
proteins, hyperthermia or energy imbalance likely
induce cytokine production during exercise through
catecholamines, endotoxin, alarmins, ATP and proin-
flammatory cytokines themselves.57 58 SET is likely to
contribute to a reduction of large cytokine response in
EIMD and DOMS independent of physical perfor-
mance/training status.
CONCLUSION
SET
administered
orally
72 hours
before
and
72 hours post exhaustive eccentric exercise resulted
in higher maximal concentric strength and lower PIP
in subjects who were less experienced in resistance
training and in significant favourable effects on anti-
inflammatory and other biomarkers in all subjects.
The potential role of SET in managing EIMD and
DOMS across different training groups needs further
investigation.
