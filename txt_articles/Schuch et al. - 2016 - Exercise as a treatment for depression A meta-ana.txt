Abstract 
The effects of exercise on depression have been a source of debate. Meta-analyses have 
demonstrated a range of effect sizes. Both inclusion criteria and heterogeneity may influence 
the effect sizes reported.  The extent of publication bias is also unknown.  Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from a recent Cochrane review and searches of major 
electronic databases from 01/2013 to 08/2015.  We included RCTs of exercise interventions in 
people with depression (including those with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) 
or ratings on depressive symptoms), comparing exercise versus any non-active arm.  A random 
effects meta-analysis calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD, 95% confidence 
interval; CI), meta-regressions and trim and fill and fail-safe n analyses were conducted. 
Twenty-five RCTs were included comparing exercise versus non-active comparisons groups, 
including 9 examining participants with MDD. Overall, exercise had a large and significant 
effect on depression (SMD adjusted for publication bias=1.11 (95% CI 0.79-1.43)) with a fail-
safe number of 1,057. Most adjusted analyses suggested publication bias leading to an 
underestimated SMD.  Larger effects were found for interventions in MDD, utilising aerobic 
exercise, at moderate and vigorous intensities interventions, in a supervised and unsupervised 
format. In MDD, larger effects were found for moderate intensity, aerobic,  and interventions 
supervised by exercise professionals.  Exercise has a large and significant antidepressant effect 
in people with depression (including MDD).  Previous meta-analyses may have underestimated 
the benefits of exercise due to publication bias.  Exercise is an evidence-based treatment for 
depression.

Abstract 
The effects of exercise on depression have been a source of contentious debate. Meta-
analyses have demonstrated a range of effect sizes. Both inclusion criteria and heterogeneity 
may influence the effect sizes reported.  The extent and influence of publication bias is also 
unknown.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from a recent Cochrane review 
and searches of major electronic databases from 01/2013 to 08/2015.  We included RCTs of 
exercise interventions in people with depression (including those with a diagnosis of major

control conditions. A random effects meta-analysis calculating the standardized mean 
difference (SMD, 95% confidence interval; CI), meta-regressions, trim and fill and fail-safe n 
analyses were conducted. Twenty-five RCTs were included comparing exercise versus control 
comparison groups, including 9 examining participants with MDD. Overall, exercise had a large 
and significant effect on depression (SMD adjusted for publication bias=1.11 (95% CI 0.79-

antidepressant effect in people with depression (including MDD).  Previous meta-analyses may 
have underestimated the benefits of exercise due to publication bias.  Our data strongly 
support the claim that exercise is an evidence-based treatment for depression.

1. Introduction 
Depression is a prevalent condition, with a long-life prevalence ranging from 10% to about 20% 
in different countries (Andrade et al., 2003). Depression is a major cause of disability, 
responsible for 40.5% of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by mental and 
substance-use disorders (Whiteford et al., 2013).  
Physical activity and exercise are suggested as potential treatments for depression, and 
incorporated in guidelines as a complementary form for illness of mild to moderate severity 
(Cleare et al., 2015). Several meta-analyses have demonstrated that exercise is an effective 
treatment for depression, with a pooled standardized mean deviation (SMD) ranging from 
small (-0.4) (Krogh et al., 2011) to very large (-1.4) (Cooney et al., 2013, Craft and Landers, 
1998, Daley, 2008, Danielsson et al., 2013, Josefsson et al., 2014, Krogh et al., 2011, Rethorst 
et al., 2009, Silveira et al., 2013, Stathopoulou et al., 2006). However, a number of different 
approaches have been undertaken in prior meta-analyses and uncertainty remains over the 
magnitude of the effects of exercise on depression.   
The 2013 update of the Cochrane review on exercise for depression, provided new data for 
discussion, showing that when analysis was restricted to the six trials considered of low risk of 
bias only, the SMD was small and non-significant (Cooney et al., 2013). This review has been 
criticized, with a particular emphasis on the potential inappropriate selection criteria applied 
(Ekkekakis, 2015).  For example, the review proposed excluding studies that had a control arm 
with any "active control comparison". However, some studies that compared different exercise 
arms were included (Krogh et al., 2009), thus clearly precluding a fair comparison. In addition, 
the review included studies that compared exercise plus well-established treatments versus 
other well-established forms of treatment, such as pharmacological antidepressants 
(Blumenthal et al., 1999). As a result, these limitations directly affected the effect size (ES), 
producing a "shrinkage" effect on the efficacy of exercise for depressive symptoms when

compared to previous meta-analyses (Ekkekakis, 2015). In addition, separate subgroup 
analyses of studies that assessed the effects of exercise on Beck depression inventory (BDI) 
(Beck et al., 1961) scores were also criticized regarding the inclusion criteria (e.g. including a 
trial which used the Hamilton HAM-D (Hamilton, 1967) scale for depression and not the BDI 
(Blumenthal and Doraiswamy, 2014, Cooney et al., 2014)).  
No recent (within the last decade) comprehensive meta-regression analyses have been 
conducted investigating exercise and depression.  Previous meta-analyses (Craft and Landers, 
1998, Rethorst et al., 2009) evaluated the moderating role of sample characteristics, such as a 
diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), which were found to be significant moderators 
of the antidepressant effects of exercise. However, a number of additional eligible studies 
have since been published.  
Another limitation within the available literature investigating the effects of exercise on 
depression is that no previous meta-analyses have adjusted for publication bias, which is a 
considerable threat to the validity of any such synthesis (Ioannidis et al., 2014). Previous 
studies of psychotherapy for depression have demonstrated that publication bias is evident in 
RCTs, and effect sizes have consequently been overstated (Cuijpers et al., 2010). It remains 
unclear, however, if publication bias threatens the validity and interpretation of the exercise as 
a treatment for depression literature.   
The present review sets out to address these limitations. Specific aims were: (1) to establish 
the updated effects of exercise on depression comparing exercise versus non-active control 
groups, (2) to identify moderators through meta-regression analyses, including sample 
characteristics (sex, use of medication and severity of baseline symptoms) and exercise 
intervention variables (length of the trial, frequency) that could impact the effects of exercise 
on depression, (3) to investigate, through subgroup and sensitivity analyses, the magnitude of 
the effects of exercise considering study quality, group format, setting, intensity, type,

supervision, presence of clinical co-morbidities, type of publication and diagnosis of MDD, (4) 
to assess the influence of publication bias on the reported effects of exercise on depression, 
and (5) to quantify the strength of the existing evidence by calculating the number of negative 
studies required to nullify the pooled ES of the analyses performed.

2. Methods 
This systematic review is in line with the PRISMA statement (Moher et al., 2009) and the 
MOOSE guidelines (Stroup et al., 2000). 
 
2.1 Inclusion criteria 
Included in this meta-analysis were studies that: (1) Investigated adult participants with a 
primary diagnosis of MDD according to established criteria (e.g. Research Diagnostic Criteria 
(RDC) (Spitzer et al., 1978), DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) or ICD-10 (World 
Health Organization, 1993)) or those with above-threshold depressive symptoms determined 
by a validated screening measure (e.g. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) 
(Hamilton, 1967), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961) or (BDI-II) (Beck et al., 
1996)).  Studies included using this criterion were those that included participants with at least 
mild (or equivalent) scores on validated scales, or had the scale revised by a psychiatrist, 
confirming the presence of depression or, in cases where the scale did not have a validated 
cut-off, the cut-off used by the author was accepted. Only studies where all participants met 
criteria for depression were included in the analyses (e.g. studies that presented a subsample 
of depressed participants were not included). Studies including people with depressive 
disorders other than MDD, such as dysthymia, were also included. (2) Measured depressive 
symptoms pre- and post-intervention, or reported a mean change and standard deviation 
using a validated measure (e.g. HAM-D, BDI). (3) Were RCTs investigating exercise, as defined 
by Caspersen (1985) as planned, structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity, in the 
sense that improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness was 
an objective, in the active arm of the trial. Trials that used yoga, tai chi or qi going, were not 
included since such mind-body activities also comprise a core set of behavioral techniques 
such as, but not limited to, deep breathing, meditation/mind-fullness and self-awareness 
(Larkey et al., 2009). These techniques are known to have an influence on depressive

symptoms (Goyal et al., 2014). Moreover, previous studies found significant heterogeneity in 
trials incorporating these mind-body approaches when compared with conventional aerobic or 
strength exercises (Bridle et al., 2012). (4) Included a non-active control group such as: usual-
care, wait-list control conditions, placebo pills or other social activities. Trials that included any 
other exercise intervention (such as stretching or low-dose exercise) for comparison or other 
structured active treatment comparisons (such as pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy 
[ECT] or psychotherapy) were excluded. (5) Were  published in peer-reviewed journal articles 
or as part of a dissertation.   
 
2.2 Information sources and searches 
Articles were identified in a two-step strategy.  First, three authors (BS, FS, SR) reviewed all 
articles identified (both included and excluded with reasons) by the recent Cochrane review on 
exercise for depression (Cooney et al., 2013). Second, three independent reviewers (BS, FS, SR) 
searched Academic Search Premier, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, 
PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL Plus and Pubmed without language restrictions from January 
2013 until August 1st, 2015, using the key words: ((exercis* OR aerobic* OR running OR 
jogging OR walk* OR hiking OR swim* OR aquatic* OR cycling OR bicycl* OR strength* and 
activit* OR fitness OR train* OR "physical medicine" OR resistance OR lift*) AND (depression 
OR dysthymia)). In addition, reference lists of all eligible articles of recent reviews investigating 
the effectiveness of exercise versus control were screened to identify potentially eligible 
articles (Cooney et al., 2013, Josefsson et al., 2014, Silveira et al., 2013). Dissertations and 
studies from the same center were identified to avoid sample overlap. In case of overlap the 
most recent and/or most extensively reported version of study was included.  
 
2.3 Study selection 
 MANUSCRIPT

8 
 
Three authors (BS, FS, SR) determined potentially eligible articles meeting the inclusion 
criteria. After removal of duplicates, two independent reviewers screened all potentially 
eligible articles using the titles and abstracts. These authors then applied the eligibility criteria, 
after obtaining the full texts, and generated a final list of included articles through consensus. 
 
2.4 Outcomes 
Our primary outcome of interest was the mean change in depressive symptoms in the exercise 
group, assessed by any validated scale, from baseline to post-intervention, in comparison with 
the mean change of the control group, calculated as the SMD together with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). If an author reported the results of two outcome measures meeting our criteria 
(i.e. mean change/ pre and posttest change in depressive symptoms according to two different 
measures), we used the primary outcome chosen by the author.  If this was not clear, we used 
the HAMD or the BDI in order to increase homogeneity in our results.  These outcome 
measures were also prioritized since they are commonly used in the exercise and depression 
literature (Cooney et al 2013). For studies reporting the effects of two or more different 
exercise groups (home-based and supervised, aerobic and anaerobic, high and low dose), the 
arm reporting the greater ES was included in the analysis. 
2.5 Data Extraction 
Two authors (FS, SR) independently extracted data using a data extraction form, including: 
sample (number of participants, % of women, % of participants taking antidepressants, 
presence of clinical co-morbidities and severity of baseline symptoms), exercise (length of the 
trial, intensity of intervention [according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 
(Garber et al., 2011) classification of intensity], weekly frequency, type and supervision [if 
exercise was supervised and if supervision was provided by exercise professionals, such as 
physiotherapists, physical educators, exercise physiologists etc.]) and methodological factors 
(study quality, instruments used for diagnosis and symptom assessment, clinical setting, and 
 MANUSCRIPT

type of document). Finally, we extracted the pre- and post-test means and standard deviations 
(SD) of the depressive symptom rating scales for the exercise and the control group (primary 
outcome).  If this was not available, we used the mean change and SD from pre- and post-test, 
if reported within the study. 
 
2.6 Risk of bias and quality assessment 
Three authors (FS, JR, BS) assessed studies on the presence of high, low or unclear risk of bias 
according to the Cochrane Handbook definition (Higgins and Green, 2011). The risk of bias was 
assessed by considering the following factors: random sequence generation, allocation 
concealment, blinding of participants, blinding of those delivering the intervention, blinding of 
outcome assessors, incomplete data outcome, selective reporting or others. To be considered 
a low risk of bias, studies had to involve adequate allocation concealment AND had to involve 
the analysis of outcome data according to intention-to-treat principles AND had to have 
blinding of outcome assessors. The criteria used for risk of bias assessment was modeled on 
that employed in  a previous meta-analysis (Cooney et al., 2013). 
 
2.7 Meta-analysis 
We used a random effects meta-analysis due to expected heterogeneity. The SMD and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the ES measure.  The meta-analysis was conducted 
using the following procedure. First, we calculated the SMD statistic, together with 95% CIs, to 
establish the effects of exercise on depression across all studies using Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis software (CMA; Version 3, Biostat, Englewood, New Jersey).  We subsequently 
conducted a sensitivity analysis computing the effects of exercise on depression in high quality 
studies only. Further, we conducted meta-regression analyses to investigate the potential 
moderators of the antidepressant effects of exercise. Potential moderators were chosen a-
priori, according to the previous literature, and included: sex, age, use of medication, length of 
 MANUSCRIPT

the trial weekly frequency and the rate of dropout. Next, we conducted subgroup analyses to 
compare exercise response according to depression diagnosis (MDD [studies that included only 
patients with MDD and used a diagnostic instrument based on Research Domain Criteria (RDC), 
DSM or ICD criteria] versus depressive symptoms), study setting (inpatient, outpatient, mixed), 
type of publication (peer review article or dissertation), high quality (low risk of bias) versus 
low quality, presence of other clinical comorbidities (yes or no), supervision (yes or no), the 
qualification of the professional supervising the exercise sessions, exercise type (aerobic, 
resistance, mixed) and exercise intensity.  Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q and 
I2 statistics for each analysis (Higgins et al., 2003). Publication bias was assessed with a visual 
inspection of funnel plots and with the Begg-Mazumdar Kendall's tau (Begg and Mazumdar, 
1994) and Egger bias test (Egger et al., 1997). In addition, we conducted a trim and fill adjusted 
analysis (Duval and Tweedie, 2000) to remove the most extreme small studies from the 
positive side of the funnel plot, and recalculated the ES at each iteration, until the funnel plot 
was symmetric about the (new) ES. Finally, the fail safe number of negative studies that would 
be required to nullify (i.e. make p>0.05) the ES was calculated (Rosenthal, 1979).

3. Results 
3.1 Search results 
In the first stage of the search strategy, 35 RCTs were identified from a previous review 
(Cooney et al., 2013).  In the second stage, following the removal of duplicates, 819 potentially 
relevant articles were identified.  At the full text review stage, we reviewed 76 articles (N=35 
from stage 1 and 41 from our stage 2 searches) and 45 were excluded with reasons (details 
summarized in figure 1). There were 30 full texts that met the eligibility criteria (Blumenthal et 
al., 2007, Brenes et al., 2007, Danielsson et al., 2014, Doyne et al., 1987, Epstein, 1986, Gary et

Singh et al., 2005, Veale et al., 1992, Williams and Tappen, 2008) provided complete data to 
enable inclusion within our meta-analysis. One of the studies included in the Cooney et al 
(2013) review, reported preliminary data from a trial (Schuch et al., 2011) and this data was 
replaced with the final updated results from that trial (Schuch et al., 2015).

3.1.1 Characteristics of included trials and participants 
Across the 25 studies, 1,487 adults with depression were included, of whom 757 and 730 were 
randomised to exercise and control conditions respectively. The mean age ranged from 18.4 to 
76.4 years and the percentage of females ranged from 17% to 100%. Overall, 9 studies  
contained patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MDD, and a further three included 
participants with depression and participants with additional co-morbid diagnoses, such as, 
cardiovascular or neurological diseases (Gary et al., 2010, Sims et al., 2009, Williams and 
Tappen, 2008). There were two studies (Singh et al., 1997 & 2005) that included participants 
with MDD and other mood disorders (MDD and dysthymia). The majority of included studies 
involved outpatients with depression (N=22), were published in peer-reviewed journals 
(N=21), and included people without reported clinical co-morbidities (N=21). The most 
commonly used measures of depressive symptoms were the HAM-D (N=7), BDI (N=7), or 
MADRS (N=3). Participant details and symptom measures are presented in table 1. Full details 
of other characteristics can be found in supplementary table 1. 
 
3.1.2 Risk of bias 
Four studies were judged to be of good methodological quality and at low risk of bias 
(Blumenthal et al., 2007, Danielsson et al., 2014, Hallgren et al., 2015, Schuch et al., 2015) and 
the remaining 21 were low quality (high risk of bias).  Full details of the risk of bias are 
presented in supplementary table 2.

Data pooled from 25 studies showed a large significant improvement favoring exercise (SMD= 
0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, p<0.001, Q=135, p<0.01) (figure 2). The Begg-Mazumdar Kendall's 
Tau" (=-0.41, p=0.001) and the Egger tests indicated publication bias (intercept =2.21, 
p=0.004). Therefore, the ES was recalculated using Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method 
with nine studies being adjusted and a new ES of 1.11 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.43, p<0.001). The fail-
safe number of additional negative studies required to nullify the significance of the main 
analysis was of 1,057 studies with negative results. Means, standard deviations and sample 
sizes of each study are summarized in the supplementary table 3.

All of the subgroup analyses are presented in table 2.  Briefly, studies including people with 
MDD presented a larger decrease in symptoms when compared to studies in samples without 
a clinical diagnosis of MDD (SMD=1.135, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.81, p<0.001). Studies using aerobic 
exercise (SMD=1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43, p<0.001), with moderate (SMD=1.33, 95% CI 0.46 to 
2.19, p=0.003) or vigorous intensities (SMD=1.34, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.24, p=0.004), with a mixed 
supervised/unsupervised format (SMD=3.01, 95% CI -0.61 to 1.97, p<0.0001) and supervised 
by qualified physical exercise professionals (SMD=1.26, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97, p<0.001) were 
associated with larger antidepressant effects.  
 
3.2.1 Adjustment of publication bias and fail safe number of studies 
Several of the meta-analyses were adjusted for publication bias, with most original analyses 
being underestimates due to publication bias. For instance, studies in MDD, study quality (both

low and high) and group exercise all had an increased ES after adjustment (see table 2).  The 
fail safe number of studies provided further evidence of magnitude of exercise ES, with a 
higher number of negative studies required to nullify the ES in outpatients (N=911), low quality 
studies (N= 589), aerobic exercise (N= 543) and supervised exercise (N=450). Full details are 
summarised in table 2.

3.3 Meta-regression of antidepressant effects in main analysis 
Mean age, gender, dropout, use of antidepressant medications, baseline depressive 
symptoms, frequency of exercise sessions and length of the trial did not moderate the 
antidepressant effect of exercise. A summary of all meta-regression analyses is presented in 
table 3.

3.4 Sensitivity analyses 
3.4.1 Exercise effects on people with MDD only  
All analyses investigating exercise in MDD are presented in table 4. Briefly, a larger pooled 
SMD was evident in low quality studies (SMD=1.32, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.42, p=0.001), for RCTS 
without a group format (SMD=2.58, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.62, p=0.013), in outpatients (SMD=1.51, 
95% CI 0.45 to 1.57, p=0.005), and when the intervention was supervised by qualified exercise 
professionals (SMD=1.53, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.59, p=0.003). There were no studies using strength 
or mixed interventions. No studies were conducted in a sample with major clinical 
comorbidities.

3.4.2 Adjustment of publication bias and fail safe number of studies 
Adjusting for publication bias, studies of high methodological quality, in inpatients, and that 
used aerobic exercise interventions had larger effects sizes. The fail-safe number of studies in 
RCTs composed exclusively of people with diagnosed MDD was 84 for RCTs in outpatient 
settings and 132 in RCTs using aerobic exercise RCTs. Full details are summarised in table 4.

3.4.3 Meta regression of moderators of control group response in MDD 
Mean age, gender, dropout, use of antidepressant, baseline depressive symptoms, frequency 
of exercise and length of the trial did not moderate the antidepressant effect of exercise. The 
full meta-regression data can be found in table 3.  
 
3.5 Mean change in depressive symptoms 
Data from 25 studies found an improvement of -4.52 points (95% CI 2.03 to 7.01, p<0.001) and 
of -6.46 (95% CI 4.18 to 8.41, p<0.001) points on the HAM-D and the BDI scales, respectively. A 
sensitivity analysis including only studies in MDD established a mean improvement in 
depressive symptoms of -5.07 points (95% CI 1.37 to 8.78, p =0.007) in the HAM-D.

4. Discussion 
This meta-analysis found large antidepressant effects of exercise on depression when 
compared to non-active control conditions (e.g. studies that did not compare exercise versus 
alternative treatments). The anti-depressant effect of exercise was higher for studies that 
included participants diagnosed with MDD. Moreover, our adjusted analyses demonstrate that 
publication bias generally resulted in an underestimation of the positive effects of exercise. 
Larger effect sizes were found for outpatients, in samples without other clinical co-morbidities, 
and when supervised by qualified exercise professionals, both in the main analysis and when 
restricted to MDD participants alone.   
Overall, our results provide robust evidence that exercise can be considered an evidence-
based treatment for the management of depression. The fail safe assessment suggests that 
more than a thousand studies with negative results would be needed to nullify the effects of 
exercise on depression. The large effect of exercise on depression found in our meta-analysis 
differs in magnitude, being larger than the effects found in a recent Cochrane review (Cooney 
et al., 2013). The differences in the magnitudes of the effects are mainly due to three factors: 
(1) the inclusion criteria, (2) the statistical test used to evaluate the ES, and (3) the inclusion of 
more recent trials. In the present review, we removed the studies without true control groups 
that were included in Cooney review (Blumenthal et al., 1999, Fremont and Craighead, 1987). 
These studies compared exercise plus an established treatment versus an established 
treatment and were included by Cooney et al., (2013) using the prerogative that one can add 
and subtract therapeutic efficacies in an algebraic fashion (e.g. exercise + selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) - SSRI/CBT = exercise) (Ekkekakis, 
2015). However, this argument is flawed since exercise may potentially overlap, at least in 
part, with some of the potential mechanisms of SSRI (e.g. increase on neurotrophic markers) 
and CBT (e.g. improved perceived coping ability and self-appraisal) (Ekkekakis, 2015). Second, 
we calculated the ES based on the mean change (baseline to endpoint) of symptoms of control

and exercise groups, not only the endpoint measure (Cooney et al., 2013). This approach is 
particularly important when pooling studies that have different baseline values for the main 
outcome (Mota-Pereira et al., 2011, Sims et al., 2009, Veale et al., 1992). Third, one trial that 
was included in the Cooney et al., (2013) review contained preliminary results from one RCT, 
which were replaced by the published final results in our updated meta-analysis (Schuch et al., 
2015) and a further five new trials were included. The inclusion of these recent trials may have 
influenced our findings, particularly our analyses of high quality studies, since three of the new 
studies were classified as being of high quality (Danielsson et al., 2014, Hallgren et al., 2015, 
Schuch et al., 2015). The inclusion of these recent trials led to the change from "small and non-
significant" effects of high quality trials in Cooney review (Cooney et al., 2013) to large and 
significant effects in the present review. The magnitude of those effects was larger in studies in 
MDD than in samples where clinical diagnoses were not stated. It should be noted that 
samples with clinical diagnoses have greater baseline depression scores and consequently 
more potential to achieve greater reductions in symptoms. Unlike the larger effects in samples 
diagnosed with MDD, the effect of exercise in samples without a clinical diagnosis of MDD was 
moderate.  
Both aerobic and mixed exercises were associated with large effects across all studies. In 
clinical samples, only aerobic exercises had large and significant effects on depression, while 
mixed interventions had non-significant effects. This finding deserves further investigation 
since no RCT investigating the effects of resistance exercise in samples comprised entirely of  
participants with MDD was identified. Moderate and vigorous intensity exercises where shown 
to be more effective than light to moderate intensity exercises. However, this finding needs to 
be interpreted with caution, since it is based on a small number of studies.  
Supervised interventions had the largest effects, in our main analysis. This is in line with 
previous reviews on exercise and lifestyle interventions (Ward et al., 2015). Exercise 
 MANUSCRIPT

supervised by professionals with relevant training, including physical educators, 
physiotherapists and exercise physiologists, was associated with the greatest improvements. 
Additionally, exercise supervised by other health professionals appears to have a large effect 
although this did not reach statistical significance. This result, added to previous findings of 
lower drop-out rate in interventions delivered by exercise professionals in people with 
depression (Stubbs et al., 2016) highlighting the importance of adequately trained 
professionals providing exercise interventions. Therefore, this finding has a practical 
implication in the design of further trials, as well as providing evidence for policy makers to 
consider including  competent exercise professionals in mental health care treatment teams 
(NICE, 2009).  
Unlike psychotherapy RCTs for depression (Cuijpers et al., 2010), the effects of exercise studies 
in depression appear to have been underestimated due to publication bias. Previous meta-
analyses have largely ignored the potential impact of publication bias, and none to our 
knowledge have re-calculated the effect sizes accounting for publication bias. These analyses 
confirm and strengthen the evidence-base regarding the benefits of exercise in people with 
depression. 
Lastly, we found a reduction of about 5 points in HAM-D scale, and greater than 6 points in the 
BDI scale, in the overall sample and in MDD patients considered separately. This reduction is 
above the clinically significant reduction of three points in the HAM-D as formulated in the 
NICE  guidelines (NICE, 2009).  
In summary, compared to non-active interventions, exercise has a large and significant 
antidepressant effect, and it would require over 1,000 negative studies to nullify this result.  
Publication bias is evident in exercise RCTs, but this has largely resulted in an underestimation 
of the ES of exercise. Our novel ES, calculated adjusting for publication bias, confirms and 
strengthen the case that exercise is an evidence-based treatment for depression.
