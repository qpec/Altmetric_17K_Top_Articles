In Brief
The role of ILC2s in the initiation phase of
inflammatory arthritis has remained
unclear. Omata et al. demonstrate that
the ILC2-derived IL-4/13 decrease pro-
inflammatory cytokine secretion by
macrophages, thereby attenuating
arthritis.

SUMMARY
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were detected
in the peripheral blood and the joints of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) patients, serum-induced arthritis (SIA),
and
collagen-induced
arthritis
(CIA)
using
flow
cytometry.
Circulating
ILC2s
were
significantly
increased in RA patients compared with healthy con-
trols and inversely correlated with disease activity.
Induction of arthritis in mice led to a fast increase in
ILC2 number. To elucidate the role of ILC2 in arthritis,
loss- and gain-of-function mouse models for ILC2
were subjected to arthritis. Reduction of ILC2
numbers in RORacre/GATA3fl/fl and Tie2cre/RORafl/fl
mice significantly exacerbated arthritis. Increasing
ILC2 numbers in mice by IL-25/IL-33 mini-circles or
IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex and the adoptive transfer
of wild-type (WT) ILC2s significantly attenuated
arthritis by affecting the initiation phase. In addition,
adoptive transfer of IL-4/13-competent WT but not
IL-4/13�/� ILC2s and decreased cytokine secretion
by macrophages. These data show that ILC2s have
immune-regulatory functions in arthritis.
INTRODUCTION
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are rare immune cells defined by
their lack of T cell receptors and absence of lineage markers.
Nevertheless, they share many functional similarities with
T cells. Although T cells outnumber ILCs by far, ILCs are often
the first responders, initiating critical immune responses before
adaptive immunity starts. ILCs may therefore play a role in the
initiation of arthritis, but functional data on ILCs in arthritis are
limited to date. Recent work suggested that a specific form of
ILCs, ILC3s, which are a source of IL-17 and IL-22, reside in en-
theses and are enriched in the joints of patients with spondyloar-
thritis (Ciccia et al., 2012, 2015; Cuthbert et al., 2017; Leijten
et al., 2015). Some analyses have also been carried out in rheu-
matoid arthritis (RA) patients showing that ILC1 and ILC3 reside
in the synovial fluid of RA patients (Dalbeth and Callan, 2002; Koo
et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2011) and are positively correlated with
clinical disease activity (Koo et al., 2013). In one study of subjects
with pre-clinical RA, in which the authors did not distinguish be-
tween ILC1 and ILC2, the combined ILC1/2 population pre-
sented a larger proportion of ILCs in lymph nodes compared
with healthy controls, suggesting that ILCs may be involved in
RA from the very beginning (Rodrı
´guez-Carrio et al., 2017). Apart
from these descriptive studies on ILC1 and ILC3, data on the
function of ILCs in RA are rare. Recently, we showed that
ILC2s induce the resolution of arthritis via the production of
IL-9, which in turn restores the suppressive capacity of Tregs,
enabling them to suppress chronic inflammation (Rauber et al.,
2017). In this context, studies of ILC2s are highly interesting,
as they are linked to Th2 cell activation, which has recently
been described as a regulatory pathway in RA (Chen et al., 2016).
In this study we addressed the role of ILC2s in the initiation
phase of RA. On the basis of the cytokine signature and the in-
duction of type 2 immune responses that lead to enhanced tis-
sue repair, along with control of inflammation (Chen et al.,
2016; Gause et al., 2013), we hypothesized that ILC2s have an
attenuating effect on RA. To test this concept, we investigated
different ILC2 gain- and loss-of-function models during inflam-
matory arthritis. We could show that ILC2 numbers are increased
both in RA patients and in inflammatory arthritis mouse models.
In two settings of genetically reduced ILC2 numbers, arthritis
was exacerbated, while therapeutic enhancement of ILC2
numbers significantly attenuated arthritis. This regulatory action
of ILC2s was dependent on their capacity to secret IL-4/13, as
IL4/13�/� ILC2s failed to attenuate arthritis after adoptive cell
transfer. Mechanistically, ILC2-derived IL-4/13 significantly sup-
pressed IL-1b section by macrophages, and it was shown that
both IL-1b and macrophages are key players driving early clinical
symptoms in SIA and RA (Ji et al., 2002; Misharin et al., 2014).
This mechanism was critical only during the initiation phase of

 arthritis, as therapeutically adoptive ILC2 transfer at later time
points also failed to attenuate arthritis. Our data thus reveal
essential regulatory functions of ILC2s in inflammatory arthritis.
RESULTS
ILC2s Are Increased in RA Patients and Inversely
Correlate with Disease Activity
We first assessed ILC2 numbers in peripheral blood samples
from RA patients and healthy controls using flow cytometry.
ILC2s
were
identified
as
lineage-negative
(CD3,
CD11c,
CD123, CD14, CD34, TCRab, TCRgd, CD303, and CD94)
CD127+ CD161+ CRTH+ GATA3+ cells. Although circulating
ILC2s were low in healthy controls, their relative and absolute
numbers were elevated in RA patients (Figure 1A). When
analyzing RA patients, who had elevated ILC2s (>0.7% of leuko-
cytes), ILC2s were inversely correlated to disease activity as
measured by DAS28-ESR scores (Figure 1B). Furthermore,
when comparing RA patients with inactive (DAS28-ESR < 3.2)
versus active (DAS28-ESR R 3.2) disease, ILC2s were signifi-
cantly higher in RA patients with inactive disease (Figure 1B).
Of note, ILC2s were also detected in the synovial tissue of RA pa-
tients with a tendency toward elevated numbers compared with
peripheral blood samples taken from the same patients (Fig-
ure 1C). Hence, the observed increase in RA patients together
with their presence in the synovial tissue highlights their possible
systemic as well as local involvement during RA.
ILC2s Are Induced during Experimental Arthritis and
Primarily Secrete IL-4
Next, two different arthritis mouse models, namely the K/BxN
serum transfer (SIA; passive transfer of antibodies) and the
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model (active immunization
with chicken collagen type II followed by collagen boost injection
21 days later), were analyzed for the dynamics of ILC2 regulation
during arthritis. ILC2 numbers, identified as lineage-negative
(CD3ε, CD4, CD8a, CD11b, and CD16l) CD90.2+ KLRG1+ ST2+
GATA3+, rapidly increased after disease onset in SIA (Figure 1D)
and CIA (Figure 1E). Along with the initiation phase of arthritis
IL-4-competent ILC2s accounted for the most significant pro-
portion of ILC2s, followed by IL-5-competent and IL-13-compe-
tent ILC2 in descending order (Figures 1D and 1E). Although we
observed a significant increase of ILC2s in the SIA model, only
Th1 (CD4+ T-bet+) cells increased at a comparable rate, whereas
Th2 (CD4+ GATA3+), Th17 (CD4+ RORgt+), and Tregs (CD4+
Foxp3+) were not significantly changed (Figure 1F).
To further confirm the presence of ILC2s in the inflamed joints,
we analyzed synovial tissue using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) and could show that ILC2s can be found in the
blood and the synovial tissues when clinical signs of arthritis
were fully developed at 8 days post-SIA induction (Figure 1G).
In the bone marrow, where ILC2s develop from their progenitors,
IL-4-competent ILC2s were significantly upregulated and ac-
counted for more than 80% of total ILC2s already on day 4
post-SIA induction (Figure 1H). Interestingly, their numbers in sy-
novial tissue increased at later time points, at 8 days post-SIA in-
duction (Figure 1H), possibly showing their early accumulation in
the bone marrow, followed by their later egress to the synovial
tissue. Also, we investigated ILC2s immunohistochemically at
8 days post-SIA induction in the inflamed joints by using bone
marrow chimeras with Roracre TdTomatofl/fl reporter as donor
mice and wild-type as recipient mice (to reduce the strong fluo-
rescence of radio-resistant cells in the Roracre TdTomatofl/fl
mice) after SIA induction. There, we could show the presence
of ILC2s, identified according to the expression of RORa as the
essential transcription factor besides GATA3 (Halim et al.,
2012; Mjo
¨ sberg et al., 2012) in combination with IL-17RB in the
inflamed arthritic tarsal joints of the hind paws (Figure 1I). These
results show that similar to RA patients, ILC2s are upregulated in
two different arthritis mouse models both systemically and
locally in the inflamed joints.
Reduced ILC2 Numbers in Mice Exacerbate Arthritis and
Bone Destruction
To examine the functional role of ILC2s, we investigated two in-
dependent mice strains showing genetically reduced ILC2
numbers, namely RoracreGata3fl/fl (Figures 2A–2F) and Tie2cre/
Rorafl/fl mice (Figures 2G–2L). First, RoracreGata3fl/fl mice
showed higher arthritic scores after induction of SIA compared
with littermate control mice RoracreGata3wt/wt (wild-type [WT])
(Figure 2B). Exacerbated arthritis scores in RoracreGata3fl/fl
were associated with increased bone erosions and inflamed
areas in the affected paws analyzed by histomorphometry (Fig-
ures 2C and 2D). Systemically, RoracreGata3fl/fl mice showed
no obvious difference in systemic bone mass, presented as
bone volume per total volume (BV/TV), but significant upregu-
lated osteoclast numbers (Figure 2E). In addition, there was no
difference in Th17 and Treg numbers (Figure 2F) and T cell-
derived serum cytokine levels, except for reduced IL-22 serum
concentrations (Figure S1A), while a significant increase in
CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages, a well described source of pro-in-
flammatory cytokines like IL-1b, was detected (Figure 2G).
Also Tie2cre/Rorafl/fl mice showed exacerbated arthritis after
SIA induction compared to littermate Tie2cre/Rorawt/wt (WT) con-
trol mice (Figures 2H and S2A) along with significantly reduced
ILC2 numbers (Figures 2I and 2J). Of note, among the analyzed
cytokines secreted by ILC2s in Tie2cre/Rorafl/fl mice, IL-4,
together with IL-5, were the most prominent ones when detected
by intracellular FACS analysis (Figure 2I). To investigate if other
lymphocyte subsets or cytokines are involved, we analyzed
Treg, Th1, Th2 and Th17 cell populations and T cell-derived cy-
tokines and could not detect any differences at day 8 post-SIA
induction (Figures 2K, 2L, and S1B). These data support a func-
tional role of ILC2s in arthritis, which is related to immune regu-
lation rather than activation, as two mice strains with genetically
reduced ILC2 numbers showed exacerbated clinical arthritis.
Systemic In Vivo Induction of ILC2s Attenuate Arthritis
and Bone Destruction
IL-25 and IL-33 were shown to elicit ILC2s (Fallon et al., 2006;
Moro et al., 2010; Neill et al., 2010; Salimi et al., 2013), and
recently a role of IL-33 in the egress of ILC2s from the bone
marrow has been reported (Stier et al., 2018). Therefore, we
used
the
mini-circle
(mc)
technology
(Liu
et
al.,
1999;
McHedlidze et al., 2013) to systemically overexpress IL-25 and
IL-33 (Figure S2B) in order to analyze if increased ILC2 numbers

 respectively, showed significantly increased ILC2 numbers
following IL-25/33 mc treatment (Figure 3C). Histomorphological
analysis of the paws revealed reduced bone erosions along
with less inflammation in IL-25/33 mc-treated mice after SIA in-
duction on day 14 (Figure 3D). Also systemically, BV/TV was
increased, and osteoclast numbers per analyzed bone surface
were reduced in tibial sections (Figure 3E). Analysis of Treg,
Th1, and Th2 cells revealed no significant difference, whereas
Th17 cells were surprisingly increased in IL-25/33 mc-treated
mice at 14 days post-SIA induction (Figures 3F and 3G). Serum
cytokines were unchanged (Figure S1C). To further strengthen
the regulatory role of ILC2 gain of function during SIA, IL-2/IL-2
antibody complex (IL2c) treatment was used (Pelly et al., 2016).
IL2c treatment resulted in significantly attenuated arthritis
scores compared with untreated controls (Figures 4A and
S2D) as well as significantly increased ILC2 numbers in the
spleen (Figure 4B) and locally in the inflamed synovial tissue
(Figure 4C). Inflamed areas in the joints (Figure 4D), bone ero-
sions, and osteoclast numbers in the joints (Figure 4E) were
reduced
upon
IL2c
treatment,
while
bone
volume
was
improved, confirming our previous observations in ILC2 induc-
tion experiments by IL-25/33 mc treatment. However, in
the IL2c-treated mice, we could not observe any significant
changes in Treg, Th1, Th2, or Th17 cell populations or
serum cytokines (Figures 4F, 4G, and S3A). Of note, IL2c
treatment in Tie2cre/Rorafl/fl mice failed to attenuate arthritis
scores compared with untreated control Tie2cre/Rorafl/fl mice

(Figure S2E). Although we cannot rule
out any other non-investigated cell type
being
responsible
for
the
observed
attenuating effects after in vivo ILC2
expansion, these results strongly suggests that ILC2s have a
positive role on arthritic disease severity.
Transfer of ILC2s Attenuates Arthritis and Bone
Destruction
Furthermore, in order to have direct proof that ILC2s alone can
attenuate arthritis, we performed adoptive transfer experiments
with sorted and ex vivo expanded ILC2s (Duerr et al., 2016) trans-
ferred into WT recipient mice before SIA was induced (Figure 5).
ILC2 transfer into WT mice significantly reduced arthritis (Fig-
ure 5A). We also found systemically increased ILC2 numbers in
the spleen, with IL-4-competent ILC2s contributing to more
than 60% of total analyzed ILC2s (Figure 5B) as well as locally
in the affected, inflamed synovial tissue by FACS analysis (Fig-
ure 5C). Similar to the results obtained by systemic induction of
ILC2s (Figures 3 and 4), adoptive transfer of ILC2s reduced
bone erosions and inflamed areas in the affected paws 14 days
after SIA induction (Figure 5D). Even systemically, we observed
an increase in BV/TV and a concomitant decrease in osteoclast
numbers per analyzed bone surface (Figure 5E). Furthermore,
WT ILC2s were adoptively transferred also into IL-7R�/� recipient
mice (Figures 5F–5J), as it was shown that IL-7 is essential for
ILC2 differentiation (Moro et al., 2010; Robinette et al., 2017;
Vonarbourg and Diefenbach, 2012). The observed anti-arthritic
effect after adoptive WT ILC2 transfer into WT recipient mice
was even more pronounced in IL-7R�/� recipient mice (Fig-
ure 5F). Similar to WT recipient mice, IL-7R�/� recipient mice
Cell Reports 24, 169–180, July 3, 2018

 showed increased ILC2 numbers (Figures 5G and 5H), and
decreased inflamed area and bone erosions (Figure 5I) in the
affected paws as well as increased systemic BV/TV along with a
reduction in osteoclast numbers in the tibia (Figure 5J). Again,
as IL-7R�/� are not completely lacking ILC, and IL-7 signaling
might affect other potentially important cell types as well, we addi-
tionally performed the SIA mouse model in IL-7R�/� mice without
adoptively transferred ILC2s. Surprisingly, we observed per se
improved clinical arthritis scores (Figures S4A and S4B) but un-
changed Treg, Th1, and Th2 immune cells responses, whereas
Th17 cells were significantly upregulated in IL-7R�/� mice
compared withWT controls (Figures S4C andS4D). Nevertheless,
adoptive WT ILC2 transfers further attenuated the observed
phenotype in IL-7R�/� mice. These results corroborate that the
observed phenotypes after in vivo ILC2 expansion were indepen-
dent of other potential target cells types, as the induction of ILC2s
and the adoptive transferof these cells yielded very similar results.
IL-4/13-Competent ILC2s Are Essential for the
Observed Attenuating Effects
Because in our experiments shown so far, IL-4-competent ILC2s
represented the highest proportion of total ILC2, we adoptively
transferred ILC2 from IL-4/13�/� mice and compared them with
WT ILC2s (Figure 6). Interestingly, adoptive transfer of IL-4/13�/�
ILC2s did not show significant attenuation of clinical arthritis,
whereasWT ILC2s did (Figures6A and S2F). Again, FACS analysis

revealed the successful ILC2 transfer, as
both
ILC2
recipient
groups
showed
increased ILC2 numbers compared with

group
that
did
not
receive
ILC2s (Figure 6B). Serum cytokine analysis on day 8 post-SIA in-
duction showed significant upregulated IL-4 concentrations in
WT ILC2-transferred recipient mice (Figure 6C). The levels of
pro-inflammatory IL-1b and TNFa were reduced, although non-
significantly, after transfer of WT ILC2s and even significantly
increased after IL-4/13�/� ILC2 transfer (Figure 6D). Other inves-
tigated effector serum cytokines, except IL-6 at day 4, remained
unchanged at day 4 and day 8 post-SIA induction (Figures S3B
and S3C). Interestingly, Treg numbers were only significantly
increased in WT ILC2 recipient mice (Figure 6E), whereas the
Th1 cells were upregulated only in IL-4/13�/� ILC2 recipient
mice and Th2, Th17 remained unchanged in both (Figure 6F).
Furthermore, we investigated the potential therapeutic effect of
ILC2 adoptive transfers (either from WT or IL-4/13�/� donor
mice) by transferring ILC2s during established disease 4 days af-
ter the induction of SIA (Figure 6G). In line with our hypothesis that
IL-4/13 play an important role in the initiation phase of SIA, we did
not observe any clinical improvement in the later stages of the dis-
ease. Together, these data show the critical involvement of ILC2-
derived cytokines IL-4/13 in the initiation phase of arthritis.

On the basis of the reduced IL-1b and TNFa serum cytokine
levels after ILC2 transfers, we further investigated the potential
of ILC2s to affect IL-1b and TNFa cytokine secretion in vitro.

the presence or absence of ILC2s from WT or IL-4/13�/� mice.
As shown in Figure 7A, WT ILC2s significantly suppressed
IL-1b secretion. This was dependent on IL-4/13, as IL-4/13�/�
ILC2s were lacking this suppressive effect (Figure 7A). Although
significant, the effect on TNFa (Figure 7B) was only mild, and no
effect on IL-6 cytokine concentrations was observed (Figure 7C).
These results show that ILC-derived IL-4/13 is capable of block-
ing IL-1b, a key effector cytokine in SIA (Ji et al., 2002) secreted
by macrophages, which are the essential effector cells in SIA
(Misharin et al., 2014).
DISCUSSION
Recent studies have elucidated the role of ILCs in inflam-
matory diseases, demonstrating their multi-functionality in dis-
ease exacerbation and prevention. For instance, ILC1 protect

mice against Toxoplasma gondii infection
(Klose et al., 2014), but they were also
linked to pathogenic mucosal inflamma-
tion (Bernink et al., 2013). Similarly, ILC3
were reported to fuel intestinal inflamma-
tion (Pearson et al., 2016) but at the same
time have been shown to be involved in
wound healing after skin injury (Li et al.,
2016).
Although
ILC3
and
potentially
also ILC1 may indeed have pro-inflamma-
tory properties in arthritis, particularly
related to IL-17 and IL-22 production
and their role in spondyloarthritis, the ef-
fect of ILC2s on arthritis seems to be sub-
stantially different. ILC2s play prominent
roles in the expulsion of helminths (Fallon et al., 2006) and in
type 2 immunopathology after allergen exposure in the lungs
(Halim et al., 2012). Importantly, type 2 immune responses
have previously shown to exert regulatory effects on arthritis
(Chen et al., 2016). Recently, Rauber et al. (2017) identified
IL-9 as one regulator for the resolution of arthritis by showing
that IL-9-secreting ILC2s restore the suppressive capacity of
Tregs, enabling them to dampen already established chronic in-
flammations. In this study, we report on the fast and early in-
crease in IL-4/13+ ILC2s and demonstrate their importance on
the initiation phase of arthritis rather than the resolution of estab-
lished chronic inflammatory arthritis. We can show that IL-4/13+
ILC2s are beneficial in the early initiation phase.
ILC2s rapidly increased after induction of arthritis and could
be detected in the synovial tissue of two different arthritis models
(SIA and CIA) as well as in human RA patients. Functional exper-
iments revealed that genetically decreased ILC2 numbers in
RoracreGata3fl/fl or Tie2cre/RORafl/fl mice exacerbated arthritis,

 while in vivo gain-of-function models, such as IL-25/33 mc or IL2c
treatment, consistently attenuated arthritis and mitigated bone
destruction. Although IL-25/33 mc and IL2c treatments both pro-
vide strong support for ILC2s being regulatory cellular mediators
in arthritis, additional effects not directly based on ILC2s cannot
be excluded. For instance, it was shown that IL2c enhances
Arg1 expression (Pelly et al., 2016), IL-25 induces Th2 responses
(Fort et al., 2001), and IL-33 increases Treg frequency (Biton et al.,
2016; Schiering et al., 2014), upregulates FcgRIIB expression on
macrophages (Anthony et al., 2011), and suppresses osteoclast
numbers (Zaiss et al., 2011). Of note, recently it was shown that
IL-33 is important for the egress of ILC2s from the bone marrow,
further supporting our attenuating effects of IL-25/33 mc treat-
ment on arthritis scores (Stier et al., 2018). Also, differences of
ILC2s in the capacity to induce Tregs might evolve of diverse stim-
uli used to in vivo increase ILC2 numbers compared with adoptive
transfers of mature, ex vivo pre-activated ILC2s. To exclude non-
ILC2-mediated effects of IL-25/33 mc and IL2c treatments, we
performed adoptive transfer experiments of sorted ILC2s and
found that these cells directly attenuated arthritis scores. This ef-
fect was dependent on the capacity of ILC2 to secret IL-4/13, as
IL4/13�/� ILC2s failed to attenuate arthritis. IL-4/13+ ILC2s were
critical during the initiation phase of arthritis, as adoptive transfer
of ILC2 at later time points failed to affect arthritis. Beside the
prominent downregulation of IL-1b by IL-4/13+ ILC2s, which is a
key effector cytokine in arthritis (Ji et al., 2002; Lamacchia et al.,
2012), IL-4 itself acts as a regulatory cytokine in arthritis, as it fos-
ters Th2 cell commitment, induces Ig class switching to the Th2-
associated isotypes IgG1 and IgE (Nelms et al., 1999), and has
the ability to suppress synoviocyte proliferation (Dechanet et al.,
1993). In accordance, most (Horsfall et al., 1997; Joosten et al.,
1997; Myers et al., 2002) but not all (Ohmura et al., 2005) studies
showed that IL-4 has attenuating effects on arthritis. Studies of
IL-13 and arthritis are limited, and although IL-13 is found in RA
(Liu et al., 2016; Silos
xi et al., 2016; Tokayer et al., 2002), only one
study addressed its functional role by showing that IL-25/IL-13
has an attenuating effect on arthritis (Liu et al., 2016; Silos
xi et al.,
2016; Tokayer et al., 2002). Taken together these previous works
and our findings suggest that a key regulatory factor in arthritis is
the generation of IL-4/13-competent ILC2s.
In summary, we identified ILC2s as a regulatory cell lineage in
the early development of arthritis. Enhancement of ILC2
numbers may therefore be a method to effectively block the
development of this severe inflammatory joint disease.

¨ klinisches Experimentelles Tier-
zentrum (PETZ) (Erlangen, Germany). The local ethics committee of the gov-
ernment of Mittelfranken approved all experiments.
Experimental Model of Arthritis
For CIA, arthritis was induced in 8-week-old female DBA/1J mice by subcu-
taneous (s.c.) injection at the base of the tail with 100 mL. Mice were re-chal-
lenged after 21 days by intradermal immunization in the base of the tail with
0.25 mg bovine type II collagen (CII; ChondrexRedmond, WA) in complete
Freund’s adjuvant (CFA; Difco Laboratory), containing 2.5 mg/mL killed Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra). The paws were evaluated for joint swelling
three times per week. Each paw was individually scored using a 5-point
scale: 0 = normal paw, 1 = minimal swelling or redness, 2 = redness and
swelling involving the entire forepaw, 3 = redness and swelling involving the
entire limp, and 4 = joint deformity or ankylosis or both. Paw width was
measured using calipers. Likewise, serum-induced arthritis (SIA) was induced
in 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 150 mL
pooled K/BxN serum. The paws were evaluated for joint swelling three times
per week, the same as for CIA. Each paw was individually scored using the
same scales as for CIA. For in vivo treatment with mc vectors, 8-week-old fe-
male C57BL/6 mice and BALB/cJRj were treated with 4 mg of mc vector of
IL-25 and IL-33 hydrodynamically 5 days before the initiation of arthritis
(SIA), as described previously (Liu et al., 1999). For in vivo treatments with
IL-2 complex, 8-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were treated with IL-2 com-
plex (IL2c) formed of recombinant IL-2 (R&D, Abingdon, UK) and anti-IL-2 anti-
body (clone JES6-1A12; BioXcell, West Lebanon, NH). These materials were
prepared at a 1:10 ratio of IL-2 to anti-IL-2 (2.5 mg:25 mg) in sterile PBS for
i.p. delivery, as described previously (Pelly et al., 2016). Mice were challenged
with two i.p. doses of IL2c on days �7 and 0 before SIA was initiated.
Human Study Subjects
Peripheral blood from RA patients (n = 59) and healthy controls (n = 21) was
analyzed using flow cytometry for ILC2s and their demographic and disease ac-
tivity by disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-ESR, in which we counted the number
of tender joints and swollen joints and recorded general health scale by patient
for themselves and measured erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in blood.
The samplesofsynovial tissueswereobtained from patientswithactiveRAusing
needle arthroscopy. All analyses of human material were performed in full agree-
ment withinstitutionalguidelinesandwiththeapprovaloftheethicscommitteeof

Flow Cytometry
For detection of ILC2s in human blood samples, cells were stained with bio-
tinylated CD11c (337232; BioLegend), CD123 (306004; BioLegend), CD14
(367106; BioLegend), CD34 (343524; BioLegend), FcdR1 (13-5899-82;
eBioscience), TCRab (306704; BioLegend), TCRgd (331206; BioLegend),
CD303 (orb114050; Biobyt), and CD94 (130-098-966; Miltenyi Biotec), fol-
lowed by streptavidin-labeled Texas red (562318; BD Bioscience) and CD3

CD161
(339942;
BioLegend), CRTH (350118; BioLegend), and GATA3 (653804; BioLegend)
(Figure S5A). For detection of ILC2s in mice, cell suspensions from blood,
spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and lung were stained with biotinylated
CD3e (100304; BioLegend), CD4 (100508; BioLegend), CD8a (100704;
BioLegend), CD19 (115504; BioLegend), CD11b (101204; BioLegend), and
CD161 (108704; BioLegend) followed by streptavidin-labeled Texas red
(562318; BD Bioscience) and CD45 (103108; BioLegend), CD90.2 (140322;
BioLegend), KLRG1 (138426; BioLegend), ST2 (101001PE; MD Bioscience),
and GATA3 (653806; BioLegend). Prior to staining with antibodies (Abs), a
LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) was used
to exclude dead cells. For intracellular cytokine staining of ILC2s, total lympho-
cytes were incubated in vitro overnight with GATA3 AB. ILC2s were gated on
CD45+ Lin� ST2+ KLRG1+ CD90.2+ GATA3+ LIVE/DEAD Violet single cells (Fig-
ure S5B). All flow cytometry analyses were performed using the CytoFLEX
Platform (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using Kaluza analysis-software
(Beckman Coulter). For ILC2 cell sorting, a MoFlo Astrios EQ cell sorter (Beck-
man Coulter) was used to purify ILC2s (Figure S5D). Cells from spleen were
stained with CD3 (130-192-294; Miltenyi Biotec), CD5 (100606; BioLegend),
B220 (11-0452-82; eBioscience), NKp46 (137618; BioLegend), CD11b (17-
0112-82; eBioscience), CD11c (17-0114-82; eBioscience), KLRG1 (138426;
BioLegend), ICOS (564070; BD Bioscience), and ST2 (101001PE; MD Biosci-
ence). ILC2s were identified as CD5� B220� CD45R� NKp46� CD11b�
CD11c� ICOS+ KLRG1+ ST2+ cells. The purity of ILC2 populations was
95%, as verified by post-sort flow cytometric analysis.
Cell Cultures
For cell culture, ILC2s were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Life Technologies)
containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution
Figure 7. IL-4/-13-Competent ILC2s Suppress IL-1b Secretion in

 (HyClone), 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technolo-
gies), non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies), and 20 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), plus various stimulants. Sorted ILC2s from the spleens of mice
treated with mcIL-25 and mcIL-33 were stimulated with 50 ng/mL of IL-2,
IL-7, IL-25, and IL-33 and 20 ng/mL TSLP to activate and expand ILC2s
for 14 days before flow cytometric analysis or adoptive transfer experiments,
as previously described (Duerr et al., 2016). Before the experiments,
the expanded cells were analyzed using FACS again (Figure S5E). For
BMDM co-cultures with ILC2s, hematopoietic bone marrow cells were purified
from tibial bone with a 70 mm cell strainer, cultured overnight, and stimulated
with appropriate growth medium (MEM Alpha Medium 13 GlutaMAX,
32571-028 [Gibco], containing 10% L929 conditioned medium, 10% FCS,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37�C with 5% CO2. To obtain BMDMs,
bone marrow cells were incubated with growth medium (MEM Alpha
Medium 13 GlutaMAX, containing 10% L929 conditioned medium, 10%
FCS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 4 days and then seeded for
experiments. BMDMs were seeded 60,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Thirty
thousand ILC2s were seeded with BMDMs. The supernatant were collected
after stimulation with LPS (0.1 ng/mL) ± ATP (5 mM) and were analyzed using
ELISA.
Measurement of Cytokine Expression
For measurement of the expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-25, IL-33, and TNFa,
ELISA kits from Invitrogen Thermo Fisher Scientific were used. To analyze
expression of Th serum cytokines, we used LEGENDplex (BioLegend) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. For measurement of IL-4 (562915;
BioLegend) (Figure S5C), IL-5 (504311; BioLegend), and IL-13 (25-5941-82;
eBioscience) expression on ILC2s by FACS, splenocytes were incubated for
4 hr with PMA (50 ng/mL) and ionomycin (1 mg/mL).
Adoptive Transfer Experiment
For ILC2 cell adoptive transfer, donor mice were hydrodynamically injected
with 4 mg of IL-25 mc and IL-33 mc for induction of ILC2s. Five days after
plasmid injection, flow cytometry-purified donor splenic ILC2s were expanded
in vitro (see Cell Cultures) before 1 3 106 cells intravenous (i.v.) injection into
C57BL/6 or BALB/cJRj mice. ILC2s were analyzed in the splenocytes of recip-
ient mice post-ILC2 cell transfer. To examine the presence of ILC2s in the
joints, we generated bone marrow chimeras. We isolated bone marrow from
Roracre TdTomatofl/fl mice and transferred 1 3 106 cells of femoral and tibial
bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) into irradiated naive C57BL/6 mice
(10 Gy). Eight weeks after the transfer of BMMs, 150 mL serum of K/BxN
mice was injected to initiate arthritis. Mice were sacrificed 8 days later, and
tibial bones and paws were analyzed histologically.
Histology
For histological analysis, tarsal joints of hind paws and tibial bones were fixed
in 4% formalin for 12 hr and decalcified in EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). Serial paraffin
sections (2 mm) were stained for H&E and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(TRAP) using a Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Inflammation, bone destruction, and osteo-
clast numbers were quantified using a microscope (Nikon) equipped with a
digital camera and an image analysis system for performing histomorphometry
(Osteomeasure; OsteoMetrics). For histological analysis in bone marrow
chimera experiment using Roracre TdTomatofl/fl mice, we stained ILC2s using
Abs against IL-17RB (sc11754; Santa Cruz), CD3ε (17-0031; eBioscience), and
DAPI. For other histological analyses, we stained ILC2s using Abs against
IL17RB, ST2 (3363; ProSci), CD3ε, CD11b (1124; R&D Systems), CD11c
(ab33483; Abcam), B220 (14-0452; eBioscience), Ly6G (MAB1037; R&D Sys-
tems), and DAPI.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test, the Mann-Whitney
test, and one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-compari-
son post-test. For all experiments, p values are indicated as *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, or ***p < 0.001. Graph generation and statistical analyses were per-
formed using Prism version 6c software (GraphPad).
