Abstract
Purpose—The decline in U.S. adolescent fertility has accelerated since 2007. Modeling fertility 
change using behavioral data can inform adolescent pregnancy prevention efforts.
Methods—We used data on sexual activity and contraceptive use from National Surveys of 
Family Growth for young women 15–19 years of age, and contraceptive failure rates, to estimate a 
Pregnancy Risk Index (PRI) for the periods 2007, 2009, and 2012. Logistic regression was used to 
test for change over time in sexual activity, contraceptive use, and PRI. Statistical decomposition 
was used to calculate attribution of change in the PRI to changes in sexual activity or contraceptive 
method use.
Results—Sexual activity in the last 3 months did not change significantly from 2007 to 2012. 
Pregnancy risk declined among sexually active adolescent women (p = .046), with significant 
increases in the use of any method (78%–86%, p = .046) and multiple methods (26%–37%, p = .
046). Use of highly effective methods increased significantly from 2007 to 2009 (38%–51%, p = .
010). Overall, the PRI declined at an annual rate of 5.6% (p = .071) from 2007 to 2012 and 
correlated with birth and pregnancy rate declines. Decomposition estimated that this decline was 
entirely attributable to improvements in contraceptive use.
Conclusions—Improvements in contraceptive use appear to be the primary proximal 
determinants of declines in adolescent pregnancy and birth rates in the United States from 2007 to 
2012. Efforts to further improve access to and use of contraception among adolescents are 
necessary to ensure they have the means to prevent pregnancy.

After substantial declines in the 1990s and early 2000s and a stall from 2005 to 2007, the 
U.S. adolescent birth rate declined rapidly between 2007 and 2013—dropping 36%, among 
15- to 19-year olds [1]. There has also been a 25% decline in the adolescent pregnancy rate

 over a shorter period, falling from 70 pregnancies per 1,000 women in 2007 to 52 
pregnancies per 1,000 women in 2011 [2]. The declines in adolescent pregnancy and birth 
rates since 2007 have occurred in all 50 states, across racial and ethnic groups, and among 
both younger and older teens, although differentials across subgroups and geographic 
locations remain [2,3]. Increasing use of abortion has not contributed to these declines, and 
abortion ratios (the ratio of abortions to live births) have declined very slowly over this 
period [2].
Despite these substantial declines, the United States continues to have adolescent birth and 
pregnancy rates that are higher than rates of other developed countries. Comparing rates of 
adolescent pregnancy in 2011, the U.S. rate (52 per 1,000 females, 15–19) is more than six 
times as high as Switzerland (8 per 1,000), more than twice as high as France (25 per 1,000) 
and slightly higher than England and Wales (47 per 1,000) [4]. Most adolescent pregnancies 
in the United States are unintended [5], and the majority of sexually active adolescent 
women report that they would be upset if they became pregnant [6].
To date, there has been limited research focused on identifying the causes of these rapid and 
large declines in the United States since 2007. Adolescent fertility is influenced by both 
distal and proximate factors. Distal factors may occur at many levels, including individual, 
household, community, and other structural contexts [7]. Given the broad scope of the 
declines, research has generally focused on macro-level social and economic factors such as 
the economy, media, and public policies [8–11]. These distal factors may influence fertility 
via proximate determinants, including sexual activity and use of contraception; changes in 
these behaviors and outcomes are national goals for Healthy People 2020 [12].
A focus on adolescent sexual activity and contraceptive use can improve our knowledge of 
the direct mechanisms driving the observed declines in adolescent pregnancy and 
childbearing. Understanding these two proximate factors can prime further research to 
examine distal determinants of adolescent fertility trends and inform policy development and 
implementation.
We have examined declines in adolescent pregnancy risk across the period from 1991 to 
2007 in multiple analyses, using data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) 
as well as from high school students in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS) [13–
15]. Using NSFG data for 1995–2002, we found that 86% of the reduction in pregnancy risk 
among young women aged 15–19 (including both those in and out of school), was due to 
contraception, with the remainder due to declines in sexual activity (concentrated entirely 
among younger teens) [14]. Similarly, using YRBS data on high school students—a 
systematically younger group—we found that the substantial declines in adolescent 
pregnancy rates in the United States from 1991 to 2007 could be primarily attributed to 
improved contraceptive use [15].
A previous analysis estimated borderline increases in the pregnancy risk between 2003 and 
2007 that paralleled a small increase in the actual adolescent birth and pregnancy rates from 
2005 to 2007 [15]. This study and others validate our approach to measuring pregnancy risk, 
which accounts for sexual activity, contraceptive use, and contraceptive failure [16,17].

 Building directly on these previous studies, this article uses NSFG data to examine how 
changes in adolescent sexual activity and contraceptive use influence adolescent fertility risk 
in the United States from 2007 to 2013. This analysis utilizes newly estimated method-
specific contraceptive failure rates for the United States [18]. We estimate trends in sexual 
activity and contraceptive use patterns and use statistical decomposition to attribute declines 
in pregnancy risk to these two behavioral components.
Methods
Data
The NSFG is a periodic national probability household survey of women and men aged 15–
44 years in the United States [19]. The NSFG used a multistage, stratified-clustered 
sampling frame; interviews were conducted continuously from June 2006 to December 2010 
and again from June 2011 to June 2013. Sampling weights provided by the National Center 
for Health Statistics allow division of the data into three nationally representative and 
nonoverlapping periods: June 2006–June 2008, July 2008–December 2010, and June 2011–
June 2013, which we refer to as 2007, 2009, and 2012, respectively. Our analyses were 
limited to women aged 15–19 at the time of the interview (2007 n = 1,085, 2009 n = 1,199, 
and 2012 n = 1,037). Methods of data collection and dissemination of the public use data set 
were reviewed by National Center for Health Statistics’ institutional review board 
protections of human subjects.
Measures
Following the methodology we developed and refined in prior work [13–16], we calculated 
the Pregnancy Risk Index (PRI) for each period estimating the annual risk of becoming 
pregnant among adolescent women based upon recent sexual activity (vaginal-penile sex in 
the last 3 months), contraceptive method(s) used at last sexual intercourse, and method-
specific contraceptive failure rates (CFRs); nonuse of contraception was assigned a specific 
risk of pregnancy as well. Thus, the PRI score represents each woman’s risk of pregnancy in 
1 year, given her sexual activity and contraceptive use. The overall PRI summarizes, at the 
population-level, the risk of pregnancy among all adolescents, incorporating information 
about both the level of recent sexual activity and the level of contraceptive risk.
For each individual i, we calculated a PRI score with the following formula:
The mean of these individual scores is the overall PRI of the entire population. As indicated 
by the formula, the PRI score for a woman who was not sexually active in the past 3 months 
(or had never had sexual intercourse) was set to zero, as she did not face a current risk of 
pregnancy. The PRI for each sexually active woman was estimated as the CFR of the 
methods used at last intercourse. We used new typical-use 1-year CFRs estimated from the 
2006 to 2010 NSFG pregnancy and contraceptive calendars and adjusted for abortion 
underreporting [18]. A “typical-use” CFR is the number of pregnancies occurring among 
100 women using a specific contraceptive method over a 12-month period; typical use refers

 to the way a method is actually used by women and their partners, including inconsistent or 
incorrect use [20]. Recent research has found significant variation in CFRs by race/ethnicity 
but not age [18]. Thus, for the most common methods (pill, patch, condom, and withdrawal), 
we used race/ethnicity-specific CFRs for 15- to 44-year olds (Failure rates stratified by race/
ethnicity are available for women identified as Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-
Hispanic black. For the 6% of respondents identified as “other”, we applied the CFR for 
non-Hispanic white women.). For less common methods, only overall CFRs were available. 
To represent the reduced pregnancy risk associated with the use of two methods at most 
recent intercourse, we followed the practice of earlier research and multiplied the method-
specific CFRs [15,16]. (Although women could report simultaneous use of up to four 
contraceptive methods, we limited our failure rate calculations to the two most effective 
methods.)
Sexually active women using no method at last intercourse were assigned a PRI score of 85, 
based on widely accepted estimates of the risk of pregnancy over a 12-month period [21]. 
Finally, following the approach of earlier research, women who were pregnant at the time of 
interview (n = 30 cases in 2007, 28 in 2009, and 27 in 2011) were assigned the contraceptive 
method that they reported using at the time they became pregnant [14]; (90.5% reported 
using no method at the time they got pregnant).
Analysis
For each of the three time periods (2007, 2009, and 2012), we estimated the percentages of 
sexually active female adolescents (sex in the last 3 months), the contraceptive methods used 
at most recent intercourse (or when pregnancy occurred), and the number of methods used, 
testing for significant changes over time between adjacent periods (2007 vs. 2009 and 2009 
vs. 2012) and across the whole time period (2007 vs. 2012) using logistic regression. As a 
sensitivity analysis, we also examined changes over time in alternate measures of adolescent 
sexual activity (sex in the last 12 months, sex in the last 4 weeks, and ever had vaginal 
intercourse). Contraceptive method use was estimated for individual methods, as well as the 
overall use of highly effective methods (including intrauterine device, implant, injectable, 
pill, patch, and ring).
Next, we estimated the mean PRI among sexually active adolescents, and all adolescent 
women, for each period. We used paired t tests for the difference in means to test for 
significant changes over time. All analyses accounted for the complex survey design of the 
NSFG data using the svy commands in Stata 14 [22].
To compare the PRI estimated from the NSFG to actual pregnancy rates and birth rates for 
15- to 19-year olds, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients and compared the 
annualized rate of change in each measure. Pregnancy rates were available through 2011, 
while we examined birth rates through 2013 to align with the behavioral data from the 
NSFG (sexual and contraceptive behaviors in 2012 would result in births in 2013). Birth 
rates are a good proxy for pregnancy rates in assessing trends over time, as the ratio of 
abortions to live births has changed little from year to year among adolescents since 2007 
[2].

 Finally, to assess the extent to which the decline in the PRI from 2007 to 2012 was due to 
changes in sexual activity or changes in contraceptive use, we statistically decomposed the 
PRI into these two component parts. In the standard demographic decomposition formula 
described by Das Gupta [23] for decomposing change over two time periods, the first 
component of the PRI (sexual activity, in this case) is held constant in order to calculate a 
standardized rate: the amount we would expect the PRI to change if only the second 
component (contraceptive use) had changed. To extend this methodology to address change 
over three time periods, we instead calculated standardized changes in the rate between the 
first and second periods as well as between the first and third periods; we then averaged the 
two to arrive at the standardized change in the rate over the full period 2007–2012. This 
standardized change is divided by the observed change in the rate from 2007 to 2012 to give 
us the estimated proportion due to contraceptive use over the three time periods; the 
expected proportion due to sexual activity is calculated as its complement.
Results
Sexual activity in the last 3 months among all females ages 15–19 did not change 
significantly between 2007, 2009, and 2012 (31% 2007, 33% 2009, and 30% 2012), Table 1. 
Similarly, none of the alternate measures of sexual activity (sex in the last 12 months, sex in 
the last 4 weeks, and ever had vaginal intercourse) changed significantly between periods 
either.
Overall, contraceptive use patterns indicate increases in the use of methods by adolescent 
females during the examined period (Table 2). There was a statistically significant decline 
from 2007 to 2012 in the share of adolescents reporting no method use at last sex (22%–
14%, p = .046). Conversely, the share of teens reporting one or more methods used at last 
sex increased significantly from 2007 to 2012, rising from 78% to 86%. There also was a 
statistically significant increase in the share of adolescent females reporting multiple method 
use (two or more methods) at last sex, increasing from 26% in 2007 to 37% in 2012 (p = .
046); pill and condom were the most common combination across the period. Few young 
women reported use of three or more contraceptive methods at last sex. Overall, the use of 
all highly effective methods (IUD, implant, injectable, pill, patch, and ring) increased from 
2007 to 2009 (from 38% to 51%, p = .01) but then did not change significantly from 2009 to 
2012.
Despite these increases in use of any method and multiple methods, we found few 
significant increases in use of any specific methods at last intercourse. Use of IUD or 
implant had a marginally significant increase from 2007 to 2009 (from 1% to 4%, p = .072) 
but was unchanged in the later period, while use of injectables did not change significantly 
over time. From 2007 to 2012, there was a marginally significant increase in use of the pill 
(26%–35%, p = .068) but a significant decline in use of the patch or ring (5%–1%, p = .007). 
There were also nonsignificant increases in condom use (49%–55%) and withdrawal (15%–
20), while use of the rhythm method did not change and remained at or less than 2%.
Together, these shifts in contraceptive use resulted in a significant decline in the PRI (Table 
3). Among adolescents sexually active in the last 3 months, the PRI declined 26% from 2007

 to 2012 (annual rate of 5%), p = .046. Among all adolescent women, the PRI declined 28% 
from 2007 to 2012 (annual rate of 6%), p = .071. Our decomposition analysis estimated that 
106% of the change in the overall PRI from 2007 to 2012 was attributable to improvements 
in contraceptive method use, and −6% was attributable to changes in the percentage of 
sexually active young women. The negative attribution to sexual activity indicates that if 
only the observed changes in sexual activity had occurred (specifically the nonsignificant 
increase from 31% to 33% from 2007 to 2009), this would have resulted in an increase in the 
PRI. Instead, the entire decline in the PRI is attributed to improvements in contraceptive use, 
which compensated for the increase in sexual activity.
Figure 1 shows the trends in the PRI, pregnancy rate, and birth rate. The pregnancy risks 
estimated from behavioral data were highly correlated with actual changes in adolescent 
pregnancy and birth rates (Pearson correlations of .88 and .84, respectively). The 5.6% 
annual rate of decline in the overall PRI from 2007 to 2012 compares similarly to the 6.3% 
annual rate of decline in the adolescent pregnancy rate from 2007 to 2011 and the annual 
rate of decline in the adolescent birth rate (declining 5.8% from 2007 to 2012 and 6.0% from 
2007 to 2013).
Discussion
Substantial declines in adolescent pregnancy and birth rates in the United States occurred 
between 2007 and 2012. During this period, we estimated significant declines in the PRI—a 
behavioral indicator determined by sexual activity, contraceptive use, and contraceptive 
efficacy—correlated to the declines in the pregnancy and birth rates.
Our analysis indicates that improvement in contraceptive use accounted for all the decline in 
the PRI from 2007 to 2012. Statistically significant improvements in contraceptive use 
included increases in the share of adolescent girls using any contraceptive method at last sex 
(and thus an equal decline in use of no method) and increases in multiple method use. Both 
of these trends were influenced by an increase in highly effective methods, particularly the 
pill. These findings extend and parallel the conclusions of our previous research analyses 
that found that improvements in contraceptive use drove much of the decline in teen 
pregnancy rates from 1991 to 2007. However, during this earlier period, some of the PRI 
decline also was attributed to declining sexual activity. Here, the NSFG shows no decline in 
adolescent sexual activity from 2007 to 2012 (and a nonsignificant increase from 2007 to 
2009), suggesting that this behavioral factor did not play a role in the recent PRI declines. 
Most recently (since this article was initially peer reviewed), data from the national YRBS 
shows sharp declines in sexual activity among high school students from 2013 to 2015—
after a long plateau from 2001 to 2013 [24]. At this point, it is unclear whether these new 
data represent a new trend or are the result of other factors.
The PRI methodology, which creates a composite measure, identified reductions in overall 
risk not apparent in the individual contraceptive method use measures. Although overall 
contraceptive use increased, changes over time in specific methods generally were not 
statistically significant at conventional levels. However, with less than one-third of 
adolescent women sexually active, our statistical testing for changes in contraceptive use

 was underpowered. Although we found small (and not statistically significant) changes in 
some contraceptive methods, it was in combination that, these changes resulted in significant 
reductions in the PRI.
Although some studies have descriptively linked increased access to LARC (long-acting 
reversible contraceptive) methods to localized declines in adolescent birth rates [25,26], our 
analysis indicates that LARC use has played a modest role at the national-level through 
2012. While the share of adolescents using LARC at last sex did not change significantly 
during the period under study, this may change moving forward with newer clinical 
guidelines supporting LARC methods as first-line contraceptive choices for adolescents 
[27,28]. Recent data collected from high school students in the YRBS survey documents an 
increase in IUD and implant use from 2013 to 2015 for female students [24]. Given its 
relatively low failure rates, even with typical use, future increases in LARC use would 
reduce pregnancy risk. But any efforts to promote LARC use should be guided by 
individuals’ method preferences and reproductive autonomy, recognizing that contraception 
is a personal decision and not “one size fits all” [29].
These analyses rely on new typical-use CFRs estimated from the 2006–2010 NSFG [18]. 
These new failure rates have decreased as compared to estimates derived from earlier rounds 
of the NSFG, indicating improvements in how couples use contraception. (These 
improvements contrast with little change in CFRs between 1988 and 2002.) [30–32]) 
Estimates for all methods from the 2006–2010 survey are more than one-third lower than 
those from the 1995 survey. Studies that do not incorporate these improvements in CFRs 
may miss an important influence on adolescent pregnancy and birth rates [8,33].
The recent declines in adolescent pregnancy and birth rates in the United States have not 
occurred in isolation but are part of nearly universal reductions in adolescent fertility during 
the second half of the 20th century. Since the 1950s in both the United States and Western 
Europe, declining adolescent fertility has been influenced by widespread social forces such 
as rising educational opportunities for young women, the invention of modern methods of 
contraception, rising age at marriage, and legalization of abortion [34]. Prior research found 
that much of the difference in adolescent pregnancy rates between the United States and 
European countries resulted from lower rates of contraceptive use among U.S. adolescents 
[35]; the increasing rates documented here may reduce these differences.
Limitations
This analysis had several limitations. Although the overall NSFG sample size is adequate, 
small sample sizes in key subgroups, particularly sexually active adolescents, constrained 
our ability to examine differential patterns by racial/ethnic or age groups within the 
adolescent population. Estimates of method-specific contraceptive use among sexually 
active adolescents were underpowered, reducing the likelihood of estimating statistically 
significant changes.
We applied CFRs estimated from the 2006–2010 NSFG; any potential changes within this 
period, or since 2010, cannot be identified. We also assumed that there was no change in 
adolescents’ biological fecundity during the relatively short study period. The analysis relies

 on self-reports which may reflect social desirability bias or other reporting errors. Our 
analysis did not consider changes in the composition of which adolescents use which 
contraceptive methods, and further attention should be given to heterogeneity among 
adolescents by their method of contraception.
We recognize that by focusing on changes in the proximate determinants of adolescent 
pregnancy—sexual activity and contraceptive use—this analysis does not measure how 
upstream social or ecological influences impact these behaviors. Future research should 
continue to investigate the distal influences of the recent declines in adolescent pregnancy. 
The findings of this analysis also argue for a focus on mechanisms that influence 
contraceptive use patterns instead of influences on sexual activity, which has contributed 
little to the ongoing declines in adolescent pregnancy risk.
Public health implications
The rapid declines in adolescent pregnancy and births from 2007 to 2012 occurred despite 
stagnant rates of sexual activity. Instead, we find that the contraceptive behaviors of sexually 
active adolescents have driven the recent shifts in fertility outcomes. The increases in overall 
contraceptive use at last sex from 2007 to 2012 are part of a longer trend. Between 1995 and 
2012, any method use at last sex among adolescent women increased from 66% to 86%, 
while use of multiple methods increased from 11% to 37% [14]. Taken together, evidence 
from this study and our previous studies indicates that the substantial long-term decline of 
57% in adolescent birth rates from 1991 to 2013 [1] can be primarily attributed to increases 
in overall contraceptive use. With the risk of pregnancy associated with no method use at 
85%, adolescents’ uptake of any method, regardless of its failure rate, markedly reduces this 
risk. Policy discussions should focus on supporting adolescent contraceptive use generally, 
including access to the full range of methods.
Public policy and programs can play a critical role in supporting adolescent contraceptive 
use. Since contraceptive use is the critical driver of adolescent fertility, it is important to 
ensure adolescents’ access to comprehensive sexuality education that provides medically 
accurate information about contraception. A recent meta-analysis of comprehensive 
sexuality education and abstinence-only programs evaluation data indicates that 
comprehensive sexuality education can increase condom and contraceptive use; however, 
abstinence-only programs have not demonstrated effectiveness in changing adolescent 
sexual behavior or in reducing teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections [36]. 
Despite recent declines in adolescent pregnancy, the percentage of adolescents who report 
receiving formal instruction about birth control has declined, while the share receiving only 
abstinence instruction has increased [37]. The increased availability of the Internet to 
adolescents and the anonymity it provides for searching sensitive topics, offers new 
opportunities to meet the sexual health needs of adolescents [38]. Further research should 
examine adolescents’ use of online sexual and reproductive health information online, as 
well as the quality of this information.
The increase in adolescent contraceptive use may reflect recent efforts to increase 
adolescents’ access to reproductive health services, including expanding private and public 
insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act and changing clinical guidelines

 [27,28,39]. Despite insurance expansion, publicly funded family planning centers remain an 
important source of contraceptive and reproductive health care, serving more than one 
million adolescents in 2013 [40]. Continued support of funding mechanisms that provide 
adolescents with confidential and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care are 
necessary to maintain and expand the contraceptive use patterns observed in this study and 
to ensure access to supportive and essential adolescent health services.

 IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTION
Rapid declines in adolescent pregnancy and birth rates from 2007 to 2012 can be 
attributed to increases in contraceptive use, including use of any method, multiple 
methods, and of more effective methods. Based on this and previous research, adolescent 
fertility declines since 1991 can be primarily attributed to improved contraceptive use.
