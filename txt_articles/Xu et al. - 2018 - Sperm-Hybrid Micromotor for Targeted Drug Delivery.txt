ABSTRACT 
A sperm-driven micromotor is presented as cargo-delivery system for the treatment of 
gynecological cancers. This particular hybrid micromotor is appealing to treat diseases in the 
female reproductive tract, the physiological environment that sperm cells are naturally adapted to 
swim in. Here, the single sperm cell serves as an active drug carrier and as driving force, taking 
advantage of its swimming capability, while a laser-printed microstructure coated with a 
  
2 
nanometric layer of iron is used to guide and release the sperm in the desired area by an external 
magnet and structurally imposed mechanical actuation, respectively. The printed tubular 
microstructure features four arms which release the drug-loaded sperm cell in situ when they bend 
upon pushing against a tumor spheroid, resulting in the drug delivery, which occurs when the 
sperm squeezes through the cancer cells and fuses with cell membrane. Sperms also offer higher 
drug encapsulation capability and carrying stability compared to other nano and microcarriers, 
minimizing toxic effects and unwanted drug accumulation. Moreover, sperms neither express 
pathogenic proteins nor proliferate to form undesirable colonies, unlike other cells or 
microorganisms do, making this bio-hybrid system a unique and biocompatible cargo delivery 
platform for various biomedical applications, especially in gynecological healthcare.  
 
INTRODUCTION  
The development of drug delivery systems that provide effective doses locally in a controlled way 
is one of the main challenges in the worldwide fight against cancer.1, 2 Among such nano- and 
microcariers, liposomes were shown to be able to lower the cytotoxicity, improve the solubility 
and control the release of drugs.3 Despite surface functionalization that allows them to increase the 
circulation time4 and active tumor targeting ability,5 there are still a lot of challenges to address, 
such as unspecific uptake by other organs,6  limited tissue penetration7 and the decrease of effective 
concentration due to the dilution in body fluids.8 To overcome the abovementioned challenges, 
novel cellular carriers have been proposed, that take advantage of the membrane fluidity, long 
lifespan and high biocompatibility of cells.9 As examples, stem cells as a combinatorial drug 
delivery system have been used for regenerative therapy,10 macrophages for anticancer drug 
  
3 
delivery11 and red blood cells for sustained drug release in blood.12  However, a precise transport 
method is particularly necessary for targeted drug delivery. Self-propelled cells, which provide a 
combination of cellular encapsulation and propulsion, are attractive due to their biocompatibility, 
ability to interact with other cells/tissue and optimal swimming performance in physiological 
microenvironments.13, 14 Bacteria, for example, have been reported as promising self-propelled 
carriers.15 Combined with their chemotactic,16 and/or magnetotactic properties17 or associated 
guidance components,18 bacteria can transport and deliver drugs or perform in situ sensing. It is 
however noteworthy that rapid clearance or even autoimmune reactions might be caused  by the  
immune response to certain bacteria.19  
In this work, we report a new type of sperm-hybrid micromotor and its potential application in 
targeted drug delivery to treat gynecologic cancers, including cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, 
vulvar and fallopian tube cancers, which are affecting more than 100.000 women every year in the 
United States.20 The here reported micromotor comprises a motile sperm that serves as the 
propulsion source and drug carrier, and a 3D printed four-armed microtube, also called “tetrapod”, 
used for the magnetic guidance and mechanical release (Figure 1a). Compared to other drug 
carriers, sperms are naturally optimized to swim efficiently through the female reproductive 
system and can load a high amount of drugs,21 making them good candidates as drug carriers 
toward gynecologic cancer treatment. The sperm cell provides an extraordinary ability to 
encapsulate protein and other hydrophilic drugs owing to its crystalline nucleus.22 The sperm 
membrane can protect drugs from body fluid dilution, immune-reactions and the degradation by 
enzymes. Sperms, with their compact membrane system, can efficiently avoid dose dumping, 
which is regarded as a major issue of micelles.23 For microscale carriers such as microspheres, 
micro capsules, and drug-loaded micromotors,24, 25  drug uptake is always a problematic issue.26 
  
4 
Sperm cells, with their somatic cell-fusion ability,27 are expected to improve the drug transfer to 
the target cells and the drug availability as well. Several proteins from the sperm membrane, such 
as CD9 and integrins are involved in this process.27  It solves the uptake problem of microscale 
carriers via the nanoscale mechanism of membrane fusion. Providing controllable guiding and 
release mechanisms, sperm-hybrid micromotors can potentially deliver drugs precisely to tumor 
tissue and furthermore avoid undesired drug accumulation in healthy tissue. The concept of a 
hybrid microdevice consisting of a sperm cell and a synthetic component was introduced in our 
previous research, where micromotors have been successfully employed to transport and guide 
single sperm cells as a promising approach for in vivo assisted fertilization.13, 28 In the here 
presented work, we pursue a different application, however staying in the field of gynecologic 
medicine to take advantage of the sperms' natural adaptability to the reproductive system. This 
novel system combines several intriguing features, namely self-propulsion, in situ mechanical 
release of the drug-loaded sperm, penetration ability and high drug loading capacity. Besides, 
sperm-hybrid micromotors are exceptionally well-suited to swim through the female reproductive 
tract due to the naturally developed specialization of the cellular component. 
RESULTS 
Guidance and sperm release 
The tetrapod microstructure was designed to have a tubular body and four flexible arched arms 
(Figure 1a). These arms protrude from one opening of the microtube in a curved manner.  The 
dimensions of the microstructure are shown in Figure 1b,c. At the narrowest point between the 
four arms, the maximum distance is 4.3 µm. In preliminary experiments, the dimensions of the 
structure were optimized according to the dimensions of a sperm cell  (for the experiments shown 
  
5 
in this manuscript, bovine sperm cells were selected for their similar paddle-like shape to human 
sperms), of which the head is on average 4.5 µm wide, 1 µm thick and 10 µm long.29, 30 Therefore, 
the sperm can be captured to propel the microstructure. Once the arms hit a substantial barrier, 
such as a cell cluster, they bend to enlarge the distance between the arms allowing the sperm to 
escape from the tube in the process (Figure 1a). The polymeric structure was designed and 
fabricated by means of two-photon 3D nanolithography (Figure 1c). Then the tetrapod 
microstructure was asymmetrically coated with 10 nm of iron with a tilt angle of 15º to create a 
magnetic “easy axis”. An additional layer of 2 nm of titanium was deposited to improve the 
composite’s biocompatibility. A simulation was performed with finite element software to validate 
the optimum tetrapod geometry (detailed parameters shown in SI). This simulation indicated that 
the applied force of 128 pN by a motile sperm31 results in the arms deformation, increasing the 
aperture or diagonal distance between them in about 328 nm (Figure 1d). Such deformation is 
enough for the sperm to be released. The enlargement would be increased up to 1018 nm when the 
applied force is 450 pN which could be generated by a hyperactivated sperm.32 To ensure the 
sperm release from the microstructure, progesterone was added to the sperm medium to 
hyperactivate sperms.33 Video S1 demonstrates the elasticity and shape memory of the arms by 
repeatedly pressing down the arm with an AFM tip towards the substrate. The arms were bent but 
returned to their original position without damage.

sperm. (ii) Applied force is 450pN from a hyperactivated sperm. 
 
When an approaching sperm reaches the microstructure, it gets mechanically trapped inside the 
cavity of the tubular part and start to push the tetrapod forward (Video S2). The tubular body of 
the tetrapod is only 2 µm longer than the sperm head, thus the sperm tail can still beat freely outside 
  
7 
the tube to provide powerful propulsion as it was previously demonstrated by our group.34 
Compared to free sperms, the average swimming velocity of the sperm-hybrid micromotors is 
nonetheless decreased by 43% from 73 ± 16 µm/s to 41 ± 10 µm/s (for 15 samples of sperm-hybrid 
micromotors). The main reason for the velocity reduction is thought to be the increase of the fluid 
drag that is provoked by the synthetic material and the complex structure of the tetrapod.  It was 
reported that the swimming velocity of sperms is influenced by temperature and the rheology of 
the medium as well.35 The asymmetrically distributed metal coating makes it possible to guide a 
tetrapod microstructure or a sperm-hybrid micromotor and even manipulate several of them 
simultaneously (Video S3).  Figure 2a illustrates a rectangular track of a guided sperm hybrid-
micromotor, also shown in Video S3. The hybrid motor was easily steered by changing the 
direction of the external magnet. In most cases, the hybrid micromotor rotates while it moves 
forward due to the helical motion of the sperm,36 which means the tetrapod does not change the 
characteristic motion of the sperm. Figure 2b illustrates vertical guidance of a sperm-tetrapod. The 
hybrid micromotor was steered to swim vertically out of plane simply when the external magnet 
was placed vertically. Thereby the swimming depth of the tetrapod could be adjusted. Pluronic® 
F-127 solution was reported previously as sperm repellent agent.37 Prior to the experiments with 
sperm cells, tetrapods were thus treated with Pluronic® F-127 solution to reduce undesired 
adhesion between the sperm membrane and the tetrapod surface. Video S4a shows the motion of 
the sperm-tetrapod without adhesion in which the sperm cell rotates inside the tetrapod. In the non-
adhesion situation, sperms immediately swam out when the tetrapod arms hit an obstacle. 
However, the majority of tetrapods was found to rotate together with captured sperms due to either 
surface interaction between the sperm membrane and the material surface or the mechanical 
locking of the sperm head inside the structure (Figure 2c). In these cases, it always took several 
  
8 
seconds from the moment the tetrapod hit a wall until complete release of the contained sperm 
(Video S4b,c). 
PDMS microfluidic channels were fabricated as a platform for the investigation of the sperm 
release mechanics. Sperm release occurred when two arms hit a corner (Video S4a,b) or when four 
arms hit a wall (Video S4c), while the release processes are different in both cases. When the 
motors came into contact with the targeted barriers, they still rotated for a while after the forward 
swimming was stopped. The rotating sperm-tetrapod stopped faster when two arms hit a corner 
because of the geometric gap between the arms which was easily caught on a corner. Once the 
rotation stopped, the sperm cell escaped when the tetrapod arms opened (release in 7 s). When four 
arms hit a wall, the rotation was not stopped because the arms were not locked. Thus, the sperm 
release took longer when four arms were bent on a wall (12 s). In both cases, tetrapods were pushed 
back by around 3 µm after the sperms escaped. The reason for these recoils is the existence of an 
elastic force that makes the tetrapod arms recover their original shape once the pushing sperm is 
gone. Even though there is a substantial diversity in bovine sperm dimensions, swimming 
behaviors and fabricated tetrapods within a sample, more than 2/3 (15 out of 22) of the coupled 
motors were shown to successfully release sperm cells.

Previous research has reported similar elastic structures on the microscale that were also fabricated 
by two-photon lithography.38 For example, a microscale beam  was deformed by around 5 µm 
under compression with 68 pN.39 The elasticity of such photosensitive polymeric material depends 
on the type of monomer and the cross-linking parameters.38 In order to avoid uncontrolled release 
  
10 
events, we did not choose a softer polymer material but optimized the laser power that initializes 
cross-linking (5 mW). In our simulation, the applied force was given according to the maximum 
pushing force of a sperm in low-viscosity fluid (2.29 × 10-3 Pa·s).31 It has been reported that the 
sperm can generate a more powerful force when the head is pushing against an obstacle.40 
Furthermore, the force can be up to 20 times higher when the sperm is hyperactivated and swims 
in the viscoelastic fluid of the female reproductive system.32 Consequently, we believe that sperms 
can be released with such a mechanical trigger system also, and maybe even more efficiently, 
under physiological conditions. 
 
Drug loading of sperm 
We used DOX-HCl as a model drug to evaluate the encapsulating performance of sperms. 
Doxorubicin (DOX) has been approved as a chemotherapy medication with a broad application 
spectrum in cancer therapy since 1974.41 Its liposomal form (Doxil) is also used primarily for 
gynecological cancer treatment.42 DOX-HCl-loaded sperms are obtained by simple co-incubation 
of DOX-HCl and live sperms. After purification by centrifugation, the incubated sperm sample 
can be redispersed in sperm medium (Figure 3a). The fluorescence image in Figure 3b(i) shows 
that the majority of the sperm cells have been loaded with DOX-HCl (self-fluorescent at 470 nm 
excitation wavelength), demonstrating an efficiency of 98% with a count of 3502 sperm cells. A 
3D reconstruction from a z-stack of images of a single sperm cell is shown in Figure 3b(ii). DOX-
HCl was predominately found in the head and the midpiece of the sperm. The cross-section of the 
sperm in Figure 3b(iii) indicates that a larger amount of DOX-HCl was loaded in the cytoplasm 
and the nucleus as compared to the cell membrane. Drug loading efficiency was evaluated by 
  
11 
calculating the loading ratio. The drug loading amount was determined by the difference between 
the initial amount of DOX-HCl before incubation and the residual amount in the supernatant after 
co-incubation, which were both quantify by their respective fluorescence signals. Figure 3c depicts 
the drug loading profiles related to the DOX-HCl concentration. In the solution with a 
concentration of 3×106 sperms per mL, the loading amount of DOX-HCl increased 
approximatively linearly with the concentration of DOX-HCl ranging from 10 to 200 µg/mL. 
Hence, the loading ratio remains at around 15 % for all concentrations. For the maximum 
concentration of DOX-HCl in our experiments, the loading amount was up to 37 µg/mL in 500 µL 
sperm solution. This amount indicates an average encapsulation of 15 pg of DOX-HCl per single 
sperm cell. We also carried out a test on the encapsulating stability. The result shows that only 18 
% of drug was leaked into the solvent after 96 h (Figure S2). This means that the DOX-HCl 
encapsulation by sperm is sufficiently stable for subsequent drug delivery experiments.  
The sperm membrane consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins. Sperms are expected to 
encapsulate most of the hydrophobic drugs into the cytoplasm and the nucleus.43 After maturation, 
reduced cytoplasm remains in the midpiece and the head of a healthy sperm.44 In addition, the 
condensed chromosomes can absorb a specific amount of hydrophilic substance by binding to 
proteasomes.45 After a certain time of co-incubation with sperms, most of the DOX-HCl and BSA 
(Bovine Serum Albumin, used as a model for protein drugs) was found in the sperm head and the 
midpiece (Figure 3b and Figure S3). In contrast, BSA was also retained in the sperm tail, which is 
the result of the protein absorbability of the cell membrane. DOX-HCl attacks cancer cells by 
interfering with the macromolecular biosynthesis.46 Unlike cancer cells, mature sperms have 
terminated most of their macromolecular synthesis due to the lack of the complete endomembrane 
system, which avoids the digestion of the drug inside the sperm cell.47 What is more, it is not 
  
12 
necessary for sperm cells to express new proteins to maintain their motility. The propelling power 
is generated in the mitochondria in the midpiece.44 Since DOX-HCl also interferes with the 
macromolecular synthesis in mitochondria,48 it may also inhibit the energy metabolism of sperms, 
which is probably the reason for the observed decrease of the sperm’s average swimming velocity 
from 71 µm/s to 57 µm/s, which is, however, still an acceptable velocity to serve the sperms' 
purpose. The result of the drug loading ratio calculation highlights the high encapsulation capacity 
of sperm cells. Previous research showed successful loading of DOX into macrophages.49 It was 
demonstrated that a more concentrated dose of DOX was found inside the cell (2.5 pg per cell), 
particularly in the nucleus, compared to the DOX solution that was co-incubated with the 
macrophages (cell size roughly 15-20 µm). We observed a similar phenomenon during the drug 
loading into sperm cells, as depicted in Figure 3. ATP-mediated permeabilization of the cell 
membrane was regarded as an explanation for this loading profile. Sperm cells exhibit  improved 
uptake of ionic DOX-HCl50 compared to molecular DOX, which is normally taken in by facilitated 
diffusion.41 Further research is required to investigate the transport mechanism through the sperm’s 
cell membrane. We believe that this approach of using living cells could lead to a new dosage 
strategy that allows high local doses of anticancer agents while reducing systemic toxic effects. 
Another advantage of the sperms comes from their incomplete metabolic system.44 A Sperm cell 
can protect a contained drug within its lipid bilayer like a liposome, but does not metabolize the 
drug like stem cells or other somatic cells would do. Because of our observation that the swimming 
velocity significantly decreased when the DOX-HCl concentration was higher than 100 µg/ml, a 
concentration of 100 µg/mL was used to prepare DOX-HCl-loaded sperms in the subsequent 
experiments.

Sperm release and drug distribution in tumor spheroids 
Drug-loaded sperms were first tested on adherent HeLa cells and then on HeLa spheroids with two 
different model drugs (FITC-BSA and DOX-HCL). Figure S5 illustrates the morphology change 
of the adherent HeLa cells after DOX-HCl treatment. There was no significant difference between 
the sample of HeLa cells and the sample of HeLa cells with unloaded sperms. After 24 hours, 
proliferated cells covered the whole substrates of the dishes in both samples. The majority of the 
cells were in fusiform shape,51 which suggests that unloaded sperms had no influence on the 
viability of adherent HeLa cells. In the sample with DOX-HCl-loaded sperms, DOX-HCl was 
barely found in HeLa cells on the substrate initially because most of the sperms swam freely in the 
bulk solution. During 72 h of incubation, more and more DOX-HCl was detected around the HeLa 
cells together with the sperm motility decreasing. After 24 hours, the density of HeLa cells was 
only half of that of the other two groups. Cells were round in morphology and exhibited blebbing 
or cytoplasmic extrusions, which indicates cell apoptosis and the termination of cell proliferation.52 
After 72 hours, ruptured membranes and nuclei were observed in the sample. DOX-HCl-coupled 
nuclei and organelles were stained in red.  
Hela spheroids were cultured as three dimensional in vitro model of tumor tissue.53 To avoid the 
cell apoptosis effect of DOX-HCl, we employed FITC-BSA (Fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled 
bovine serum albumin) at first as a model drug to observe the drug distribution in spheroids (Figure 
S4). After 24 hours co-incubation of BSA-loaded sperms with spheroids, sperms were found not 
only in the solution, but also in the spheroids as shown in the overlaid z-stack images. This proves 
the tissue penetration capability of sperms. According to a semi-quantitative analysis by ImageJ, 
the integrated fluorescence intensity which represents the total amount of BSA increased 1.8 times 
compared to the amount at the beginning. The spreading area of FITC-BSA increased 7.4 times. 
  
15 
This indicates that the increase of the fluorescent area was not only because more sperms 
penetrated into the spheroid over time, but also because more FITC-BSA was transferred from 
sperms into the HeLa spheroid.  
Cell-killing efficacy was investigated by co-incubation of DOX-HCl-loaded sperms (8×104 
sperms) with HeLa spheroids. Spheroids without any sperms or drugs, with only unloaded sperms 
and with only DOX-HCl solution were cultured as control experiments. Figure 4a illustrates the 
drug transport into a spheroid during 72 h when it was treated with DOX-HCl-loaded sperms. Red 
fluorescence shows the average intensity of 36 overlaid z-stack images and indicates the presence 
of DOX-HCl. Gradually, DOX-HCl was found in the center of the spheroid over time. After 72 h, 
the size of all spheroids decreased owing to drug-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, broken 
clusters and ruptured cells were observed in the medium (Figure 4a at 72 h). Cell viability analysis 
was performed by LIVE/DEAD staining method.54 Fluorescence images of cells of digested 
spheroids after staining are shown in Figure 4b, in which live cells and dead cells are in green and 
red color, respectively. After 72 h, the percentage of dead cells after treatment with DOX-HCl-
loaded sperms was higher than in the control samples. Quantitative results of cell counting are 
shown in Figure 4d. In the first 24 h of culture, there was no significant change in all groups, while 
after 48 h, DOX-HCl-loaded sperms showed a cell-killing effect comparable to the treatment with 
DOX-HCl solution with the same amount of DOX-HCl as the one loaded into the sperm cells (1.5 
µg). A lower percentage of live cells was found after the treatment with DOX-HCl-loaded sperms 
(47%) and DOX-HCl solution (45%) compared to the spheroid control group (68%). The group 
with DOX-HCl-loaded sperms showed the lowest percentage of live cells (13%) among all groups 
after 72 h. Unloaded sperms showed a negative effect on HeLa spheroids as well, as the percentage 
of live cells was only 37%, attributed to the spheroid disintegration induced by the sperm beating 
  
16 
and hyaluronidases reaction (from sperm membrane) with the extracellular matrix. No significant 
decrease of cell viability was found in the other two groups between 48 and 72 h. 
During cell culture in the lab, HeLa spheroids sustain a balance between cell proliferation and 
apoptosis.55 When the number of live cells increases, the number of dead cells also increases, 
especially in the necrotic core of the spheroid as the nutrients can hardly reach the interior cells. 
In our experiment, unloaded sperms showed no influence on HeLa cells in the first 48 h of 
treatment. The significantly improved cell-killing effect that we observed after 72 h on HeLa 
spheroids compared to the adherent HeLa cells can be explained by the penetration of motile 
sperms which results in spheroid disaggregation. This effect of the sperm cells might be attributed 
to the vigorous sperm tail beating and a sperm-membrane enzyme reaction with extracellular 
hyaluronic acid, a ubiquitous carbohydrate polymer that is part of the extracellular matrix in tumor 
tissue. DOX-HCl in solution phase can be rapidly taken in by the spheroid's outer cell layer. 
Consequently, a pronounced effect of the DOX-HCl solution group in the first 48 h was observed. 
However, when dissipated in the cell medium, diluted DOX-HCl was apparently not sufficient to 
induce apoptosis of more cells from 48 h to 72 h (Figure 4d). This manifests an advantage of the 
sperm-hybrid delivery system in an in vivo application scenario: the ability to avoid drug dilution 
in body fluids. While protecting the drug by the cell membrane, sperm cells transport it through 
the diffusion barrier of the tumor spheroid with their motility and cell-fusion ability. Overall, by 
means of functional combination of cargo protection and tissue penetration of sperms and the cell-
killing efficacy of the drug, this biocompatible delivery strategy employing DOX-HCl-loaded 
sperm cells poses an intriguing alternative dosage form that is able to induce a death rate of nearly 
90% after 72 h of treatment on HeLa spheroids, as was shown in Figure 4d.

A complete in vitro targeted drug delivery experiment was performed by means of a microfluidic 
channel to mimic in vivo drug administration by sperm-hybrid micromotors (Figure S5). DOX-
HCl-loaded sperms were prepared as mentioned before (detailed information in SI). Considering 
the auto-fluorescence of DOX-HCl, a fluorescence microscopy video was taken under illumination 
of a 470 nm laser in order to check the motility of drug-loaded sperms (Video S5). Although 
immotile sperms tend to agglomerate, both motile and immotile sperms were able to encapsulate 
the drug. To clearly observe the details of the sperm release process on cells, sperm-hybrid 
micromotors were guided first to HeLa clusters instead of dense spheroids (Figure 5a, Video S6). 
Here, the coupled sperm cell swam into the cell cluster after being released, and then the sperm 
head connected to the cells in the cluster due to membrane adhesion. Videos S7 and S8 display 
FITC-BSA- and DOX-HCl-loaded sperm cell transport through the constriction channel and sperm 
release onto a tumor spheroid, respectively. The whole journey path was around 2 cm long and the 
journey took 8 minutes. The sperm was released into the spheroid when the tetrapod arms hit the 
outer boundary of the tumor spheroid, and then continued swimming into the spheroid until it was 
trapped inside. Figure 5b shows the distribution of released DOX-HCl within the spheroid over 
time. The fluorescence intensity at the sperm position decreased while the fluorescent area within 
the spheroid increased. This indicates that DOX-HCl was released from the sperm and distributed 
within the spheroid. However, the integrated fluorescence intensity of the whole sperm-spheroid 
complex increased by two times over time, probably due to unanticipated DOX-HCl release from 
other nearby sperms (Figure S6).  Although the microfluidic channel was designed to separate the 
dosing region (where the drug-loaded sperm is coupled to the micromotor) from the disease region 
(HeLa cell spheroid), it was not possible to completely avoid that active sperms unintentionally 
reached the spheroid. Nonetheless, a number of cells were found with apoptotic blebs after 24 
  
19 
hours. Figure 5c shows the membrane fusion of a sperm head and a HeLa cell in 24 hours after 
sperm release, the anterior part of the sperm head was not visible anymore while the posterior part 
of the sperm head and the flagellum could still be distinguished. Previous research explained this 
interaction with the somatic fusion ability of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa.27 Taking advantage 
of the cell fusion ability of sperms, our sperm-hybrid system shows a practical potential to enhance 
the drug uptake and availability by transporting it from cell to cell (sperm to HeLa cell) without 
dilution into the extracellular medium.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
We have proposed a novel drug delivery system based on sperm-hybrid micromotors. In such 
assembly, sperms are utilized as drug carriers for potential cancer treatment in the female 
reproductive tract, as the sperm membrane can penetrate cancer cells thanks to its capacity to fuse 
with somatic cells,56 efficiently transferring the drug to the target cell/model tumor in the process. 
Moreover, the sperm cells serve as propulsion source while the magnetic microstructure is used 
for guidance and release of the sperm: When the arms of the microstructure hit Hela cells, they 
bend and thus open a way to free the sperm. Bovine sperms were used as model cells to load DOX-
HCl drug for treatment of cervical cancer. For that, HeLa cell spheroids were cultured as an in 
vitro tumor model. DOX-HCl was locally distributed into the HeLa cell clusters after the sperm 
cells were released, showing higher tumor cell-killing efficacy within the first 48h, compared to 
the drug solution with the same dose. Sperms also showed surprisingly high drug encapsulation 
capacity compared to liposomes or other synthetic carriers. Furthermore, the sperm was capable 
to swim through complex environments in an efficient manner not only due to their tail beating 
but also due to their membrane biochemistry. A set of enzymes is expressed by sperms to catalyze 
  
21 
the degradation of hyaluronic acid, which contributes to the constitution of the extracellular matrix 
of oocyte-surrounding cumulus cells.57 It was widely reported that hyaluronic acid also plays an 
important role in the proliferation and migration of tumor tissue.58 Therefore the motility and the 
hyaluronidases wielded by sperm cells allow them to penetrate deep into a tumor spheroid for 
effective in situ drug administration. Besides, sperm cells can remain functional in the human body 
for a longer time in comparison to other foreign cells due to the ability to inhibit the immune 
response by displaying specific glycans on the membrane.59 This reduces undesired immune-
response and thus makes this system compatible to the host body. Such sperm-hybrid micromotors 
not only have potential application for gynecologic cancer treatment but also for treating other 
diseases in the female reproductive tract such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory diseases, 
among others. Such devices can be also engineered to carry genes, mRNA, imaging contrast 
agents, among other substances of interest for diverse biomedical applications. Furthermore, these 
self-propelled carriers are promising to avoid the dilution in body fluids and undesired 
accumulation of such cargo, in contrast to other conventional carriers, as the cargo is internalized 
by the sperm and protected by its membrane. This drug loading process does not seem to interfere 
with sperm motility due to the sperm cell's incomplete metabolism that avoids intracellular 
degradation of the drug. Although there are still some challenges to overcome before this system 
can be applied in in vivo environments (e.g. imaging, biodegradation of the synthetic part, multiple 
sperms carrying and delivery, and improved control of sperm release), sperm-hybrid systems may 
be envisioned to be applied in in situ cancer diagnosis and treatment in the near future.

EXPERIMENTAL PART 
 
Microfluidic platform fabrication 
Microfluidic channels were fabricated by soft lithography. Briefly, a silicon wafer was spin 
coated with the negative photoresist SU-8 (SÜSS Microtec) and patterned by maskless 
lithography (μPG 501 Maskless Aligner, Heidelberg Instruments). After that, a mixture of 
PDMS and curing agent (Dow Corning Corp.) was poured onto the obtained mold and cured 
at 75 °C for 2h. The channels were designed to be 200 µm deep and 3 cm long. Two 
reservoirs were punched out at the inlet and the outlet after peeling off the PDMS channel 
from the mold. Finally, to complete the channel fabrication, the PDMS channel and a cleaned 
glass substrate were physically bonded after being exposed to oxygen plasma for about 0.5 
min. To condition the inner channel surface, channels were filled with Pluronic® F-127 
solution (10 μg/mL in DI water) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 
Pluronic® F-127 has been previously used to repel sperm cells, making it suitable for 
minimizing unspecific adhesion between sperms, the channel, and micromotor surfaces.1 
Before performing an experiment, the resulting channels were always rinsed with sperm 
medium (SP-TALP, see Table S1) 3 times.  
Tetrapod fabrication 
Arrays of polymeric tetrapods were fabricated by 3D laser lithography (Photonic Professional 
GT, Nanoscribe GmbH). Briefly, dip-in laser lithography photoresist (IP-Dip, Nanoscribe 
GmbH) was dropped onto cleaned quartz glass substrates (25x25 mm²) as the basis polymer 
material for laser writing. The negative-tone photoresist was then polymerized specifically at 
preprogrammed exposure positions by two-photon absorption (laser wavelength 780 nm). The 
design of the tetrapod arrays was programmed with DeScribe software (Nanoscribe GmbH). 
  
S3 
 
The samples were then dried in a critical point dryer (Autosamdri®-931, Tousimis Research 
Corporation) after 20 min of development in mr-Dev 600 (Micro Resist Technology GmbH) 
and 3 min of washing in isopropanol. The dried samples were coated with 10 nm Fe and 2 nm 
Ti of high purity (99.995 %) by E-beam metal evaporation (Edwards auto 500 e-beam, 
Moorfield Nanotechnology Limited). To create a magnetic easy axis, the sample holder was 
tilted at an angle of 75° during the deposition process. The metal-coated samples were also 
immersed in Pluronic® F-127 solution for 1 h at 37°C and rinsed with water and SP-TALP 
for subsequent experiments to avoid unspecific adhesion of target cells. 
Tetrapod printing quality was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss NVision 40, 
Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH). The samples were fixed on a metal stub and coated with 10 
nm of platinum. Imaging was performed at a working distance of 5 mm in the secondary 
electron imaging mode at a working voltage of 2 kV. 
The finite element analysis of the arm deformation was performed with Autodesk Inventor 
software (applied Young’s modulus and poisson ratio are 0.15 GPa and 0.45, respectively)2. 
The relationship between the deflection and the distributed load was calculated according to 
the Euler–Bernoulli equation3 as: 
������������ = ������������2
������������������������2 ������������������������� ������������2ω
������������������������2� , 
where ω and q represent the deflection and distributed load, respectively, and ������������ describes the 
orientation direction of an arm and E is the Young’s modulus of the material. I is the second 
moment of area of an arm's cross-section. For an arm with a loading along the z axis,  
������������ = � ������������2������������������������ ������������������������ .

Preparation of drug-loaded sperm cells 
Bovine sperm cells were recovered by thawing cryopreserved sperm straws rapidly in a water 
bath at 38 °C for 2 min, and washed with BoviPure 100 / BoviDilute (40%/ 80%).4 After 5 
min centrifugation at 300 g in soft mode, the sperms were resuspended in 1 mL SP-TALP for 
subsequent use. Sperm concentration was calculated by using a cell counting chamber. 1 
mg/mL of FITC-BSA (Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated bovine serum albumin) (Sigma-
Aldrich, Germany) and DOX-HCl (doxorubicin hydrochloride) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) 
solution were prepared in SP-TALP, respectively, and stored under dark conditions at 4 °C. 
To prepare drug-loaded sperm cells, a mixture of sperm solution and FITC-BSA or DOX-HCl 
solution at specific concentrations were co-incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 
in air at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing the sample 2 times with SP-TALP by centrifugation at 
300 g for 5 min, the pellet of drug-loaded sperms was redispersed in SP-TALP and stored in 
the incubator under dark conditions for subsequent use. It is important to note that the samples 
were to be used within 6 h to guarantee sperm motility. 
HeLa cell spheroid preparation 
HeLa cells were cultured in a 25 mL adherent flask for 2 weeks after recovering (for details of 
the medium see Table S2). To prepare tumor spheroids, the cells were first incubated in 2 mL 
Trypsin/EDTA for 10 min to be detached from the substrate. After dilution in 8 mL medium, 
the cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3.5 min to remove the medium. Then 
the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL medium. After calculation, 3×105 cells were 
suspended  into 3 mL of medium and seeded in a spheroid-culture dish (Cellstar® Cell-
Repellent Surface, Greiner bio-one).5 After 3 days maturation, the spheroid solution was 
transferred into a 15 mL falcon and incubated for 5 min to separate the sediment cells. 
  
S5 
 
Finally, the bottom pellet of the spheroids was resuspended in 3 mL of new medium in the 
spheroid-culture dish for subsequent experiments. 
Evaluation of sperm transport procedure 
PDMS-based microfluidic chips were employed to evaluate the sperm-tetrapod coupling 
procedure, the magnetic guidance of the hybrid micromotors, and the sperm release by the 
mechanical trigger function. The chip featured a 500 µm wide channel where the sperm-
tetrapod coupling and guidance occurred, and obstacles in 3 different shapes where the sperm 
release occurred (see Video S4).  Tetrapods, PDMS channels and sperms were prepared and 
treated as mentioned before. After that, an array of tetrapods (1296 devices in total) was 
detached from the substrate by mechanical scratching and dispersed into 50 µL of SP-TALP. 
For the evaluation of the sperm-tetrapod hybrid micromotor performance, 50 µL of a mixture 
of equal parts sperm solution (3×105 per mL) and tetrapod suspension (ca. 750 in 25 µL SP-
TALP) was introduced into the channel. Real time videos of the samples were recorded under 
the microscope (ZEISS Axio Scope.A1, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) with a high speed 
camera (Phantom Miro eX4, Vision Research Inc.) with 30 frames per second. Working 
temperature was maintained at 38 °C to assert the motility of the respective sperm sample. 
After coupling, the sperm-hybrid micromotor was guided by simply rotating a permanent 
magnet and the resulting directional changes were recorded to evaluate the guidance 
performance. The operating distance between the magnet and the sample was about 10 cm, 
resulting in an effective magnetic field of roughly 5 mT. Sperm release was evaluated by 
guiding the coupled motor onto different obstacles.  
Evaluation of the drug loading procedure 
The success of the drug loading procedure was evaluated by the determination of the 
encapsulation efficiency. DOX-HCl-loaded sperm cells were prepared as mentioned before 
  
S6 
 
with a concentration of 3×106 sperms per mL. The samples of DOX-HCl solution were 
designed as a series of concentrations with 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 µg of drug per mL. FITC-
BSA-loaded sperms were prepared with FITC-BSA solution with a concentration of 100 
µg/mL. After incubation of sperms in these solutions, the respective supernatant was collected 
after centrifugation and filtered through a 2 µm pore size membrane. The sperms were 
resuspended after purification as mentioned before. Fluorescence images were taken at an 
excitation wavelength of 470 nm (DOX-HCl: Ex 470 nm, Em 580 nm;6 FITC-BSA: Ex 470 
nm. Em 509 nm7) (Cell Observer, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH). The concentration of DOX-
HCl was determined with a fluorescence spectrometer in FL-RL mode (SpectraMax® M2, 
Molecular Devices, LLC.) and the total weight was calculated. SP-TALP solution was used as 
blank control for all measurements. The concentration of the residual DOX-HCl was 
determined by measuring the supernatant of each sample after centrifugation. The 
encapsulation efficiency was calculated as the ratio of encapsulated drug to the total amount 
of the used drug:

Evaluation of drug-loaded sperm delivery toward tumor spheroids 
Figure S6 shows the microfluidic chip that was designed for drug delivery experiments. The 
chip was designed to have a wide dosing region (where sperms are coupled to the tetrapods), a 
treatment region (where the tumor spheroid is located) and a constricted neck region in the 
middle to prevent the entry of non-coupled sperms into the treatment region. Drug-loaded 
sperms were prepared as mentioned earlier and observed under a fluorescence microscope 
using an excitation light with a wavelength of 470 nm (see Video S5, exposure time: 800 ms). 
  
S7 
 
After chip treatment with Pluronic® F-127 and SP-TALP, HeLa cell medium was first filled 
into the chip as the experimental environment. Then the HeLa spheroid was introduced into 
the chip from the left end and then 5 µL of tetrapod suspension (around 300) and 5 µL of 
drug-loaded sperms solution (3×105 /mL) were introduced from the right end. Real time 
videos of the transport process were recorded under the aforementioned microscope. With the 
guidance by an external magnet at a distance of ca. 10 cm, sperm-hybrid micromotors were 
guided to the target spheroid and the coupled drug-loaded sperms were released into the 
spheroid. Afterwards, the whole system was incubated in appropriate cell culture conditions 
(5% CO2 in air at 37 °C). At fixed time points, z-stack images of the sperm embedded 
spheroids were captured under the aforementioned fluorescence microscope. The exposure 
time of the fluorescent channel for all images was fixed at 800 ms. Subsequent 
semiquantitative analysis of the multi-channel images was executed with ImageJ.

Figure S4. FITC-BSA distribution in a HeLa spheroid after the co-incubation of FITC-BSA 
loaded sperms with a HeLa spheroid. (a) Overlaid z-stack images. Red lines circle the 
spheroid. FITC-BSA is fluorescing in green under an excitation light of 470 nm. (b) 
Semiquantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the spheroid shown in (a). Area of 
BSA distribution describes the spreading area of FITC-BSA fluorescence signals on the 
spheroid, i.e. drug distribution. Integrated intensity describes the sum of fluorescence intensity 
in the red-circled spheroid in (a), which corresponds to the total amount of FITC-BSA 
present.
