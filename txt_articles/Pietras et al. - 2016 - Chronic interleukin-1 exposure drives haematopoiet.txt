Abstract
Haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) maintain lifelong blood production and increase blood cell 
numbers in response to chronic and acute injury. However, the mechanism(s) by which 
inflammatory insults are communicated to HSCs and their consequences for HSC activity remain 
largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1), which functions as a key pro-
inflammatory ‘emergency’ signal, directly accelerates cell division and myeloid differentiation of 
HSCs via precocious activation of a PU.1-dependent gene program. While this effect is essential 
for rapid myeloid recovery following acute injury to the bone marrow (BM), chronic IL-1 
exposure restricts HSC lineage output, severely erodes HSC self-renewal capacity, and primes 
IL-1-exposed HSCs to fail massive replicative challenges like transplantation. Importantly, these 
damaging effects are transient and fully reversible upon IL-1 withdrawal. Our results identify a 
critical regulatory circuit that tailors HSC responses to acute needs, and likely underlies 
deregulated blood homeostasis in chronic inflammation conditions.

 All lineages of haematopoietic cells, including those of the immune system, arise from a rare 
population of self-renewing HSCs residing in the BM of adult mammals1. Blood production 
by HSCs is regulated by the concerted action of cell-intrinsic transcription factors such as 
PU.1 and GATA-1, and cell-extrinsic determinants produced by the stromal and 
haematopoietic components of the BM niche, which together regulate HSC self-renewal and 
specify lineage commitment2,3. While normally maintained in a largely quiescent or 
dormant state, most HSCs can be rapidly activated to proliferate and differentiate in response 
to acute needs such as regenerative challenges including myeloablation and transplantation, 
and physiological insults that induce an inflammatory state4–6. Inflammation is a critical 
physiological process that mediates host defence against invading pathogens, injury and 
other insults, and is characterized by rapid mobilization and overproduction of specialized 
immune cells, particularly myeloid cells7. Inflammation is communicated to the 
haematopoietic system, and HSCs in particular, either by direct sensing via Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs), or indirectly via a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines8–10. In particular, 
interferons (IFN), both type-I (IFN-α/β) and type-II (IFN-γ), and tumour necrosis factor 
alpha (TNFα) directly impact HSC fate during an inflammatory response11–14 and drive 
HSC specification during embryonic development15,16. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are 
therefore exciting new regulators of HSC function17, with much remaining to be understood 
regarding how inflammatory insults tailor blood production under homeostatic and disease 
conditions.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the first interleukin identified and the founding member of a group of 
11 cytokines (IL-1 family), with a central role in responses to infections or sterile 
insults18,19. IL-1 consists of two related genes (Il1a and Il1b) with distinct regulation but 
similar biological activities18, which bind a broadly expressed surface receptor (IL-1R) and 
trigger downstream transcriptional responses via the adaptor protein MyD88 and a broad 
range of signalling pathways including NF-κB, p38 MAPK, JNK, and AP-120. IL-1 is a key 
‘emergency’ signal that rapidly activates host defence and repair in many tissues, including 
the blood system, but also drives tissue dysfunction in the context of chronic inflammation 
and autoimmune diseases7,19. Acute IL-1 signalling is associated with increased myeloid 
cell production both in culture and in vivo in response to infection, irradiation or 
myeloablative chemotherapy21–24. Many of the inflammatory disease conditions associated 
with chronic IL-1 production such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), obesity and type-2 diabetes 
also feature severe haematological complications, including overproduction of tissue-
damaging myeloid cells, loss of naïve lymphoid cell production and chronic anemia25–27. 
However, the mechanism by which IL-1 contributes to deregulated blood output in these 
conditions, and the functional consequences of both acute and chronic IL-1 exposure on 
HSC fate, is largely unknown.
 RESULTS
 IL-1 accelerates HSC differentiation
To investigate IL-1 effects, we isolated HSCs (Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1+Flk2−CD48−CD150+) 
(Supplementary Fig. 1a) from wild-type mice and monitored their expansion in liquid 
culture with or without (±) IL-1α or IL-1β (25 ng/ml). Notably, HSCs cultured with IL-1

 differentiated and expanded significantly faster than untreated HSCs over an 8-day period 
(Fig. 1a), which appeared to result from faster division rates as measured by CFSE dilution 
assay after 60 hours (Fig. 1b). To confirm accelerated cell division in HSC cultures, we used 
an automated single-cell tracking approach to continuously monitor cell division over a 6-
day period (Fig. 1c)28. Remarkably, while the timing of the exit from quiescence first 
division appeared relatively unaffected in IL-1-treated HSCs, the kinetics of the subsequent 
differentiation divisions were significantly compressed (Fig. 1d,e). This effect was specific 
to HSCs, as expansion, survival and proliferation were unchanged in IL-1-treated 
granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP: Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1−CD34+FcγR+) and 
multipotent progenitors (MPP), including myeloid-biased MPP2 
(Lin−cKit+Sca1+Flk2−CD48+CD150+) and MPP3 (Lin−cKit+Sca1+Flk2−CD48+CD150−) or 
lymphoid-primed MPP4 (Lin−cKit+Sca1+Flk2+)29,30, which all express IL-1R at similar 
levels as HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 1a–e). These results indicate that IL-1 specifically 
targets HSCs and accelerates their division kinetics.
To directly address IL-1 effects on HSC differentiation, we performed colony formation 
assays in methylcellulose ± IL-1β (Fig. 1f). Strikingly, IL-1-treated HSCs produced almost 
exclusively myeloid-committed granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-type colonies containing 
abundant macrophages, in contrast to untreated HSCs, which had a higher proportion of 
immature multilineage granulocyte/macrophage/megakaryocyte/erythrocyte (GMMkE)-type 
colonies containing mostly immature myeloblasts and mast cells (Fig. 1g,h). We also re-
plated the progeny of these cultures once in methylcellulose without IL-1β, and observed 
near exhaustion of colony-forming ability in cells from IL-1-treated HSC cultures (Fig. 1i). 
Moreover, HSCs grown in liquid culture with IL-1β rapidly lost expression of the immaturity 
markers c-Kit and Sca-1, while gaining expression of the myeloid differentiation markers 
Mac-1 and FcγR, resulting in greatly increased absolute numbers of c-Kit+ progenitors and 
mature myeloid cells in IL-1-treated HSC cultures (Fig. 1j,k and Supplementary Fig. 1f). 
This pro-myeloid differentiation effect was diminished in MPPs and completely absent in 
GMPs (Supplementary Fig, 2a–e). Collectively, these results demonstrate that IL-1 
accelerates the production of mature myeloid cells by HSCs.
 Precocious activation of a PU.1 molecular circuit
To understand IL-1 effects at the molecular level, we used qRT-PCR and a custom-made 
Fluidigm PCR array to analyse gene expression in HSCs cultured ± IL-1β for 12 or 24 hours 
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Remarkably, we observed a strong induction of the 
transcription factor PU.1 (Spi1) and its target genes GM-CSFR (Csf2ra) and M-CSFR 
(Csf1r) in IL-1-treated HSCs (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). In contrast, lymphoid and 
megakaryocyte/erythrocyte (MkE) lineage genes were largely unaffected, suggesting that 
IL-1 functions by activating, rather than suppressing, lineage-specific gene programs in 
HSCs31. Consistent with the effects of IL-1 on cell division, we also observed activation of 
the cell cycle machinery and decreased expression of the quiescence-enforcing cyclin D1 
(Ccnd1) and p57 (Cdkn1c) genes, alongside induction of p21 (Cdkn1a), another PU.1 target 
(Fig. 2b). We confirmed rapid upregulation of M-CSFR and two other PU.1-dependent 
myeloid surface markers, Mac-1 and CD18, in IL-1-treated HSCs (Fig. 2c), and found 
limited or absent activation of PU.1 and its target genes in IL-1-treated MPPs and GMPs

 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) Moreover, using HSCs isolated from PU.1-eYFP reporter mice, we 
confirmed fast upregulation of PU.1 activity upon IL-1 exposure, with uniformly high PU.1 
levels in IL-1-treated PU.1-eYFP HSCs prior to their first division in single-cell tracking 
experiments (Fig. 2d,e, and Supplementary Fig. 3c). We also uncovered a small 
subpopulation of PU.1hi HSCs in untreated cultures whose progeny showed division kinetics 
similar to IL-1-treated HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3d). In particular, both had a delayed first 
division when compared to untreated PU.1lo HSCs, consistent with the decreased BrdU 
incorporation observed after 24 hours in IL-1-treated HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3e). The 
subsequent divisions of untreated PU.1hi HSCs were also accelerated, thus directly linking 
elevated PU.1 activity with the overall effect of IL-1 in accelerating division kinetics. This is 
in contrast to the recently reported function of steady-state PU.1 levels in limiting HSC cell 
cycle re-entry32 and likely reflects differences in gene dosage. In fact, high PU.1 levels 
similarly delayed HSC first division while simultaneously priming their progeny to undergo 
accelerated proliferation via induction of myeloid lineage determinants and cell cycle 
activators including Cdk4, Myc, Ccnb and Ccne1 (Fig. 2b). To directly demonstrate the 
importance of PU.1 for IL-1 effects, we isolated HSCs from PU.1ΔURE hypomorphic mice 
lacking the PU.1 upstream regulatory element (URE) and expressing PU.1 at 10–20% 
normal levels33. Strikingly, myeloid differentiation, including Mac-1 expression, was 
severely attenuated in PU.1ΔURE HSC cultures (Fig. 2f), confirming the requirement for PU.
1 in IL-1-driven HSC differentiation. Moreover, to establish that PU.1 upregulation is 
sufficient to drive accelerated HSC differentiation, we overexpressed PU.1 in HSC using a 
validated lentiviral vector34. Similar to IL-1-treated HSCs, PU.1-overexpressing HSCs 
showed accelerated gain of the myeloid markers Mac-1/FcγR relative to control HSCs (Fig. 
2g). These results establish that IL-1 acts instructively and ‘primes’ HSCs to undergo 
accelerated myeloid differentiation via precocious activation of a PU.1-dependent molecular 
circuit.
 Mechanism of PU.1 activation
To gain insight into the mechanism of PU.1 activation by IL-1, we first addressed its 
dependency on IL-1R signalling. As expected, Il1r1−/− HSCs did not show accelerated 
myeloid differentiation in the presence of IL-1β (Fig. 3a), and IL-1-treated Il1r1−/−::PU.1-
eYFP HSCs failed to upregulate PU.1 (Fig. 3b). We then exposed PU.1-eYFP HSCs cultured 
for 12 hours ± IL-1β (25 pg/ml, a lower dose titrated for sensitivity), to inhibitors of various 
signalling pathways acting downstream of IL-1R (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 3f,g)20. 
Interestingly, while blockade of p38, MEK and PKC partially decreased IL-1-induced PU.1 
levels, inactivation of IKK almost entirely abolished PU.1 activity, consistent with the ability 
of its downstream target, NF-κB, to bind the PU.1 promoter35. On the other hand, PI3K and 
mTOR inhibition had no effect, while blockade of Src kinase, which drives PU.1 activation 
downstream of M-CSFR36, only partially inhibited IL-1 effects. Since M-CSFR expression 
was increased in IL-1-treated HSCs, we also tested whether IL-1 could directly activate an 
M-CSF autocrine loop to induce PU.1. However, treatment with an anti-M-CSFR blocking 
antibody did not attenuate IL-1-mediated PU.1 activation in PU.1-eYFP HSCs, despite 
preventing M-CSF-mediated macrophage differentiation in BM cultures (Fig. 3e, 
Supplementary Fig. 3h). Furthermore, the effect of IL-1 required constant IL-1R signalling 
and was lost if IL-1 was washed out after 24 hours (Fig. 3f), further arguing against a role

 for IL-1-induced secondary factors. These results demonstrate that direct and sustained IL-1 
signalling, mediated largely through NF-κB pathway activation downstream of IL-1R, is 
required for PU.1 induction.
 Haematopoietic remodelling following IL-1 exposure
To investigate IL-1 effects on haematopoiesis in vivo, we injected mice intraperitoneally 
with 0.5 μg IL-1β for 1 day (acute treatment) up to 20 consecutive days (chronic exposure) 
(Fig. 4a). As expected, IL-1-treated mice exhibited a rapid and sustained increase in 
circulating myeloid cells, with concomitant decreases in lymphoid cells and erythrocytes 
(Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Fig. 4a). In the BM, 1 day acute IL-1 treatment did not 
significantly alter the overall cellularity or mature cell populations, save for a small but 
significant increase in Mac1+Gr1int pre-granulocytes/monocytes (preGr) (Supplementary 
Fig. 4b–d). However, acute IL-1 treatment already resulted in a rapid MPP expansion and 
substantial erosion of common lymphoid progenitors (CLP: Lin−Flk2+IL-7R+c-
KitintSca-1int) (Supplementary Fig. 4c,d), suggesting quick myeloid priming upon IL-1 
exposure. These changes were maintained and associated with a clear rebalancing of lineage 
output upon 20 days chronic IL-1 exposure, with significant expansion of Mac-1+Gr-1+ 
granulocytes (Gr) and corresponding loss of B220+CD19+ B cells (Fig. 4d). This was 
associated with a specific amplification of GMPs and myeloid-biased MPP2 and MPP3 
subsets (Fig. 4e), suggesting direct activation of a myeloid differentiation axis at the level of 
HSCs28. Consistently, we observed a rapid and sustained increase in the metabolically 
activated MPP1 (Lin−cKit+Sca1+Flk2−CD48−CD150+CD34+), which is produced by 
dormant long-term HSCs (HSCLT; Lin−cKit+Sca1+Flk2−CD48−CD150+CD34−)29, and 
solely accounted for the overall expansion of phenotypic HSCs observed upon 20 days 
chronic IL-1 exposure (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 4e). Importantly, HSC activation and 
BM remodelling was not observed in IL-1-treated Il1r1−/− mice, confirming its dependency 
on IL-1R signalling (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Moreover, using a sensitive in vivo CFSE 
dilution assay37 and 7 consecutive days of IL-1β treatment, we demonstrated that fewer 
IL-1-treated HSCLT remain in an undivided state compared to untreated HSCLT (Fig. 4h,i 
and Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). This confirms in vivo that IL-1 exposure directly increases 
HSC division rates, which likely fuels the MPP overproduction observed even after acute 
treatment. In addition, we showed persistent PU.1 activation in a substantial fraction of 
HSCs from PU.1-eYFP mice upon both acute and chronic IL-1 treatment (Fig. 4j). We also 
found decreased Cebpa levels and increased Runx1 expression in HSCs exposed to IL-1 for 
20 days (Fig. 4k), which is strikingly similar to the molecular changes observed in 
regenerating HSCs that overproduce myeloid-biased MPP2/3 as they re-build the myeloid 
lineage30. PU.1 was also activated in MPP4 from IL-1-treated PU.1-eYFP mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 5c), which likely reflects the myeloid lineage reprogramming of this 
lymphoid-primed MPP subset upon IL-1 exposure. This is consistent with the observed loss 
of lymphoid output and previously reported inhibition of lymphopoiesis by IL-138. 
Collectively, these results indicate that in vivo IL-1 exposure triggers a rapid PU.1-mediated 
myeloid differentiation program in HSCs, which amplifies myeloid cell production at the 
expense of the other blood lineages.

  Acute IL-1 stimulation contributes to myeloid recovery
To interrogate the importance of IL-1 for blood regeneration, we focused on 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU)-mediated myeloablation, as we found that both IL-1α and IL-1β levels were 
significantly increased in BM plasma, but not in blood serum, while no other pro-
inflammatory cytokines were induced following one injection of 150 mg/kg 5-FU (Fig. 5a 
and Supplementary Fig. 6a). To identify the cellular source(s) of IL-1, we analysed Il1a and 
Il1b expression by qRT-PCR in mature BM myeloid and lymphoid cells, as well as in BM 
stromal populations39, specifically osteoblastic lineage cells (OBC: 
Lin−CD45−Sca-1−CD51+), multipotent stromal cells (MSC: Lin−CD45−Sca-1+CD51+) and 
endothelial cells (EC: Lin−CD45−Sca-1+CD31+) (Supplementary Fig. 6b). At steady state, 
Il1a was expressed largely by BM CD4+ T cells, and Il1b by Grs (Fig. 5b). However, upon 
5-FU treatment, Il1a was strongly induced in myeloid cells and ECs, while no increase in 
Il1b expression was detected, suggesting that it might be released by dying Grs upon 
inflammasome activation40. Strikingly, myeloid recovery was significantly and specifically 
delayed in 5-FU-injected Il1r1−/− mice (Fig. 5c), emphasizing the importance of IL-1R 
signalling for myeloid recovery following BM injury. However, HSCs isolated from Il1r1+/+ 
and Il1r1−/− mice 10 days post-5-FU treatment, and at the peak of IL-1 production, 
displayed equivalent engraftment and long-term multilineage reconstitution upon 
transplantation (Fig. 5d–g). This indicates that acute exposure to IL-1 and transient 
activation of pro-myeloid differentiation pathways required for optimal blood recovery does 
not affect HSC self-renewal activity. In addition, Il1r1−/− mice had unaffected blood 
production as previously described41, and normal stem and progenitor BM compartments, 
aside from a specific decrease in myeloid-biased MPP3 that may represent impaired basal 
myeloid lineage priming in the absence of tonic IL-1 signalling (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). 
Together, these results demonstrate that while IL-1 signalling is dispensable in HSCs at 
steady state, it becomes important in physiological ‘emergency’ conditions when acute IL-1 
production rapidly activates HSC myeloid differentiation to enhance blood regeneration. 
They also identify ECs as one of the key producers of IL-1 following haematopoietic 
damage, consistent with a local delivery of IL-1 to quiescent HSCs lodged in their 
perivascular BM niches42.
 Chronic IL-1 exposure impairs HSC function
To better understand the consequence of chronic IL-1 exposure, we used HSCs isolated from 
mice injected ± IL-1β for 20 days. First, we confirmed that IL-1-treated HSCs had 
unaffected clonogenic efficiency in methylcellulose and normal survival as measured by 
cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) levels compared to naïve HSCs isolated from PBS-treated mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). We then transplanted both naïve and IL-1-treated HSCs into sub-
lethally irradiated congenic recipients that were subsequently injected ± IL-1β for another 30 
days to track lineage reconstitution and BM HSC chimerism (Fig. 6a). We observed 
accelerated donor blood output from naïve HSCs exposed to IL-1 after transplantation (Fig. 
6b), which is consistent with earlier literature describing enhanced myeloid regeneration in 
similar conditions21. In contrast, donor blood output rapidly eroded in mice transplanted 
with IL-1-treated HSCs upon continued IL-1 exposure (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 7b). 
In both cases, IL-1 treatment following transplantation completely blocked donor lymphoid 
output and rebalanced blood production towards enhanced myelopoiesis (Fig. 6c and 
Pietras et al.

 Supplementary Fig. 7b). However, chimerism analyses uncovered a near complete 
exhaustion of donor HSCs in the BM of mice transplanted with IL-1-treated HSCs, even in 
recipients not subsequently injected with IL-1 (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 7c). To 
determine whether these effects were due to IL-1-mediated PU.1 activation, we transplanted 
lentivirus-transduced HSCs overexpressing PU.1 into sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice 
and tracked these mice for 30 days (Fig. 6e). Strikingly, compared to control-transduced 
HSCs, we observed rapid erosion of donor blood output and complete exhaustion of PU.1-
overexpressing HSCs in the BM (Fig. 6f,g and Supplemental Fig. 7d), a behaviour similar to 
IL-1-exposed HSCs. Together, these short-term lineage-tracking results indicate that while 
IL-1 treatment always enhances myeloid cell production regardless of its duration, it also 
severely compromises HSC function and blood regeneration in conditions of chronic 
exposure, likely via hyperactivation of PU.1.
To confirm the functional impairment of HSCs chronically exposed to IL-1, we transplanted 
naïve and IL-1-treated HSCs into lethally irradiated recipient mice to assess long-term 
engraftment and self-renewal activity after 4 months, and also performed limiting dilution 
analyses (LDA) with unfractionated BM cells to address HSC function independently of 
surface markers (Fig. 7a and Supplemental Fig. 8a). In both cases, we observed significantly 
decreased donor chimerism and reduced lymphoid output from IL-1-treated HSCs (Fig. 7b,c 
and Supplementary Fig. 8b,c), reflecting compromised self-renewal activity. To investigate 
whether long-term IL-1 treatment could lead to HSC exhaustion, we also injected mice ± 
IL-1β for a total of 70 days (Fig. 7d). Remarkably, even after such a long exposure, the HSC 
pool remained numerically intact though with an elevated frequency and number of 
myeloid-primed CD41+ HSCLT 43–45 and expansion of myeloid-biased MPP2/3 
(Supplementary 8d,e). We also found that 70 day IL-1-treated HSCLT had unaffected 
survival in methylcellulose (Supplementary Fig. 8f), but significantly impaired self-renewal 
activity following transplantation (Fig. 7,e,f). These results demonstrate that chronic IL-1 
exposure restricts HSC lineage output and severely compromises HSC regenerative function, 
thus priming IL-1-exposed HSCs to fail replicative challenges like transplantation.
 IL-1 effects are reversible upon withdrawal
Lastly, we tested whether the damaging effects of chronic IL-1 exposure were retained by 
the HSC pool. We first re-transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice donor HSCs 
harvested from mice initially reconstituted with naïve and IL-1-exposed HSCs (20 days or 
70 days) (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 8g). Remarkably we observed a complete 
recovery relative to naïve controls in donor chimerism and lineage output in HSCs derived 
from IL-1-treated donor mice, regardless of the length of the original IL-1 exposure (Fig. 
7h,i and Supplementary Fig. 8h,i). These results suggest that the remaining portion of the 
IL-1-exposed HSC pool was not functionally compromised. To assess whether IL-1 effects 
were reversible under native conditions, we used mice that were injected ± IL-1β for 20 days 
and allowed to rest without further treatment for 8 weeks (Fig. 8a). After the rest period, 
blood parameters had fully normalized to untreated levels with a complete restoration of 
myeloid and B cell numbers (Fig. 8b). Moreover, most of the BM changes had also reverted 
to untreated levels, with normal numbers of HSCs and MPPs, including MPP1, and 
restoration of the CLP compartment (Fig. 8c,d). The only persisting differences were

 increased GMP and decreased MPP4 numbers, likely reflecting residual myeloid priming 
effects of the initial IL-1 treatment. Most importantly, donor chimerism and lymphoid output 
were indistinguishable from untreated HSCs, indicating full restoration of self-renewal 
activity (Fig. 8e,f). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the damaging effects of 
chronic IL-1 exposure on HSC regenerative functions are fully reversible upon interruption 
of IL-1 exposure.
 DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that IL-1 directly regulates HSC fate and instructs quick myeloid 
differentiation via precocious activation of an instructive PU.1 gene program and exclusive 
production of myeloid cells in ‘emergency’ situations such as myeloablation and 
transplantation (Fig. 8g)46. These results imply that previous models, in which sustained low 
PU.1 levels initiate eventual myeloid commitment in progenitors47, do not apply in stress 
conditions. IL-1 has long been known to inhibit lymphopoiesis and erythopoiesis38,48,49 
though, paradoxically, high PU.1 levels also play a key role in B cell development47. It is 
therefore likely that rapid PU.1 induction in HSCs by IL-1 drives myelopoiesis while 
preventing the establishment of other gene programs specifying lymphopoiesis and 
erythropoiesis. Interestingly, PU.1 activation proceeds via IKK kinase, which is the primary 
activator of NF-κB, a known IL-1 target that is also downstream of TLRs20. As TLRs also 
induce HSC myeloid differentiation50, it is possible that PU.1 serves as a convergence point 
for these pro-inflammatory signals. Interestingly, the transcription factor C/EBPβ also 
regulates ‘emergency’ myeloid differentiation in response to IL-3 or GM-CSF in 
haematopoietic progenitors51, or to IFN-γ stimulation in HSCs52. It will therefore be 
interesting to investigate whether activation of PU.1 and C/EBPβ represents distinct or 
converging mechanisms accelerating HSC myeloid differentiation in response to 
inflammation.
Our results also demonstrate that chronic IL-1 exposure significantly impairs HSC function. 
Notably, the numerical HSC pool is not depleted, consistent with prior results of long-term 
in vivo exposure to IFN-α13. This may reflect the recently described ability of the MPP 
compartment to ‘buffer’ myeloid demand independently of HSCs53,54, or the replenishment 
of an IL-1-responsive HSC subset from quiescent HSCLT similar to the IFN-responsive 
CD41+ HSCs recently involved in emergency megakaryopoiesis55. This latest interpretation 
is supported by our observation that a fraction, rather than all, HSCs activate PU.1 following 
IL-1 exposure, and the partial, rather than complete, functional impairment of IL-1-exposed 
HSCs. In this context, neither CD34 nor CD41 expression appears to separate IL-1 
responsive from IL-1 non-responsive HSCLT, and further analyses will be required to 
identify ways to separate these two functional subsets. Interestingly, the deleterious effects 
of chronic IL-1 exposure on HSC function are largely resolved following IL-1 withdrawal, 
suggesting they are not permanently ‘imprinted’ onto the HSC pool via epigenetic or other 
means. As IL-1 receptor blockers including Anakinra are highly efficacious treatments for a 
wide range of chronic inflammatory diseases featuring deregulated blood production19,, 
restoration of HSC function could be a key benefit of IL-1 blockade. Moreover, it is likely 
that IL-1 could plays a similar dual role, both beneficial and pathogenic, in a variety of 
tissues by directly reprogramming their stem cell populations. Collectively, our findings

 demonstrate that IL-1 acts as a double-edged sword for HSC function, promoting myeloid 
regeneration without functional cost to HSCs during acute need, but significantly impairing 
their self-renewal and lineage output following chronic exposure. Modulation of IL-1 
signalling, particularly its duration, may therefore be an important approach for broadly 
improving stem cell health and tissue function in the context of chronic inflammation or 
physiological aging.
 ONLINE METHODS
 Mice
Congenic wild type C57Bl/6 mice of both genders were bred in house and used for these 
studies. Il1r1−/− mice40 and PU.1-eYFP mice (gift from Dr. C. Nerlov, Oxford University, 
UK) were on a pure C57Bl/6 background, while PU.1ΔURE mice33 were on a mixed 
129X1/SvJ × C57Bl/6 background. All experiments were performed in accordance with 
UCSF IACUC approved protocols.
 In vivo assays
For in vivo IL-1 treatment, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.5 μg IL-1β 
(Peprotech) in 100 μl PBS/0.2% BSA or 100 μl PBS/0.2% BSA alone once daily for up to 
70 days in primary mice and 30 days in transplanted mice. For myeloablation treatment, 
mice were injected once i.p. with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. 
For transplantation experiments, 8–12 week old CD45.1 C57Bl/6-Boy/J recipient mice were 
sublethally irradiated (9Gy, split dose 3hr apart) or lethally irradiated (11Gy, split dose 3hr 
apart) using a Cs137 source (J.L. Shepherd), and injected retro-orbitally with CD45.2+ donor 
HSCs either alone following sublethal irradiation or together with 3×105 Sca-1-depleted BM 
cells following lethal irradiation. For transplantation experiments from 5-FU-treated mice, 
500 HSCs were injected per lethally-irradiated recipient. For transplantation experiments 
from 20 days (with or without 8 week rest period) and 70 days IL-1-treated mice, 250 HSCs 
or HSCLT were injected per lethally-irradiated recipient. For limiting dilution assays (LDA), 
1×104, 1×105, or 1×106 unfractionated CD45.2+ donor BM cells were combined with 2×105 
CD45.1+ competitor cells, and injected per lethally-irradiated recipient. For secondary 
transplantations, 500 HSCs were injected per lethally-irradiated recipient. For 
transplantation experiments in sublethally irradiated mice receiving ± IL-1β, 1000 HSCs 
were injected per recipient. For in vivo CFSE dilution assays, 1.0–1.1×105 CFSE-labelled 
CD45.2+ LSK cells or 1.5×106 naïve T-cells were injected per non-irradiated CD45.1+/
CD45.2+ F1 recipient. Mice were analysed 21 days after transplantation and the zero-
divisional cell fraction was determined according to the CFSE intensity of naïve donor T-
cells as described36. Irradiated mice were maintained on antibiotic-containing water for at 
least 4 weeks following transplantation, and analysed for donor-derived chimerism by 
regular bleeding. Peripheral blood (PB) was obtained from retro-orbital bleeding, and 
collected in 4 ml of ACK (150 mM NH4Cl/10 mM KHCO3) containing 10 mM EDTA for 
flow cytometry analyses, or in EDTA-coated tubes (Becton Dickenson) for complete blood 
count (CBC) analysis using a Hemavet 950 CBC analyser (Drew Scientific). HSC 
frequencies from LDA experiments were calculated using ELDA software (http://

chimerism at 16 weeks post transplantation.
 Flow cytometry
BM stem and progenitor populations were analysed and/or isolated as described30. For cell 
sorting, BM cells were obtained by crushing leg, arm and pelvic bones from mice in Hanks’ 
Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Erythrocytes and 
contaminating bone cells were removed by ACK lysis followed by centrifugation on a Ficoll 
gradient (Histopaque 1119, Sigma-Aldrich). BM was subsequently enriched for c-Kit+ cells 
using c-Kit microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-224) and an AutoMACS cell separator 
(Miltenyi Biotec). For population analyses, BM cells were flushed from one tibia and one 
femur per mouse and cellularity was determined using a ViCell automated cell counter 
(Beckman-Coulter). For wild-type mice, cells were incubated with purified, unconjugated 
lineage antibodies against CD3 (BioLegend, 100202), CD4 (eBioscience, 16-0041-82), CD5 
(eBioscience, 14-0051-85) CD8 (eBioscience, 16-0081-82) B220 (eBioscience, 16-0451-82) 
Ter119 (eBioscience, 16-5921-85), Mac-1 (eBioscience, 16-0112-85) and Gr-1 
(eBioscience, 14-5931-85), followed by goat anti-rat-PE-Cy5 (Invitrogen, A10691), 
subsequently blocked with purified rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with c-Kit APC-
eFluor780 (eBioscience, 47-1171-82), Sca-1-PB (BioLegend, 108120), Flk2-Bio 
(eBioscience, 13-1351-82), CD48-A647 (BioLegend, 103416), CD150-PE (BioLegend, 
115904), FcγR-PerCP-eFluor710 (eBioscience, 46-0161-82), CD34-FITC (eBioscience, 
11-0341-85) and either SA-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-4317-82) or SA-Qdot605 (Invitrogen, 
Q10101MP). For identification of CD41+ HSC, a staining including Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-
APC-eFluor780, Sca-1-PB, CD48-A647, CD150-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend, 115913), CD34-Bio 
(BioLegend, 119304) followed with SA-Qdot605, CD41-FITC (eBioscience, 11-0411-82) 
and CD229-PE (BioLegend, 122905). For identification of CLP, a separate staining 
including Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-APC-eFluor780, Sca-1-PB, Flk2-Bio/SA-Q-dot605 and IL7R-
PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-1271-82) was performed. For PU.1-eYFP mice, two separate 
stains were performed, one including CD150-PE, CD48-A647 and Flk2-Bio/SA-PE-Cy7, 
and the second one FcγR-PerCP-eFluor710 and CD34-Bio followed with SA-Qdot605 
alongside Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-APC-eFluor780 and Sca-1-PB. For sorting HSCs from IL-1 or 
5-FU-treated mice, CD34 and FcγR were excluded and Mac-1 was stained separately from 
the lineage markers using Mac-1-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-0112-82) to control for potential 
increases in expression caused by IL-1, and HSC purity was further verified by inclusion of 
ESAM-FITC (Biolegend, 136205). Stromal BM EC, MSC and OBC were isolated from 
hematopoietic-depleted, collagenase-treated bone chips as described40 using Lin/PE-Cy5, 
Sca-1-PB, CD45-APC-Cy7 (BD Biosciences, 557659), CD31-FITC (BD Biosciences 
558738) and CD51-Bio (BD Biosciences 551380) followed by SA-APC (eBioscience 
17-4317-82). BM granulocytes (Mac-1+Gr-1hiM-CSFR−), pre-granulocytes 
(Mac-1+Gr-1intLy6Clo), monocytes (Mac-1+Ly6C+M-CSFR+F4/80−) and macrophages 
(Mac-1+Gr-1loM-CSFR−F4/80+SSCint/lo) were identified and isolated as described57 using 
Mac-1-PE-Cy7, Gr-1-PB (eBioscience, 57-5931-82), Ly6C-PE-Cy5.5 (Biolegend, 128012), 
M-CSFR-Bio (eBioscience 13-1152-81) followed by SA-Qdot605, and F4/80-APC 
(eBioscience, 17-4801-82). BM B-cells (B220+CD19+), CD4+ T cells (CD4+) and CD8+ T 
cells (CD8+) were identified and isolated using B220-APC-Cy7 (eBioscience, 47-0452-82),

 CD19-PE (eBioscience, 12-0193-82), CD3-APC (eBioscience, 17-0032-82), CD4-FITC 
(BD Biosciences, 553729), and CD8-PE (Biolegend, 100908). For assessing myeloid 
differentiation in cultures, the same c-Kit-APC-eFluor780, Sca-1-PB, FcγR-PerCP-
eFluor710 and Mac-1-FITC (eBioscience 11-0112-82) were used, plus either M-CSFR-
Bio/SA-Qdot 605 or CD18-Bio (BD Biosciences, 557439) followed by SA-PE-Cy7, in 
separate stains. For transplantation experiments, donor and recipient cells were distinguished 
using CD45.1-FITC (eBioscience, 11-0454-85) and CD45.2-PE (eBioscience, 12-0453) with 
Mac-1-PE-Cy7, Gr-1-PB, CD3-APC, and B220-APC-Cy7 to assess lineage reconstitution in 
PB and BM, and CD45.1-FITC and CD45.2-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-0453-82) with c-Kit-
eFluor780, Sca-1-PB, Flk2-Bio/SA-Qdot605, CD48-APC, and CD150-PE to assess lineage 
reconstitution in HSCs. Stained cells were re-suspended in HBSS/2% FBS and 1 μg/ml 
propidium idodide (PI) to exclude dead cells. For CFSE dilution assays, cells were stained 
with biotinylated lineage antibodies and enriched for Lin− cells using anti-biotin microbeads 
(Miltenyi Biotec, 130-090-485) on MACS cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec), 
followed by SA-PB (Invitrogen, S11222), c-Kit-PE-Cy5 (BioLegend, 105810) and Sca-1 
APC-Cy7 (BioLegend, 108126). T-cells were enriched from spleen cells with a CD4-Bio 
(eBioscience, 13-0041-82) antibody and anti-biotin microbeads on MACS columns and 
subsequently stained with SA-PE-Cy5 (BioLegend, 405205) and CD62L-PE (eBioscience, 
12-0621-81). Sorted LSK cells and CD4+CD62L+ naïve T-cells were subsequently labelled 
with 2μM CFSE (Molecular Probes) as described34. For analysis of CFSE-labelled donor 
cells following transplantation, cells were stained with biotinylated lineage antibodies and 
enriched as above, followed by SA-QDot 605, CD45.1-eFluor 450 (eBioscience, 
48-0453-82), CD45.2-PerCP-Cy5.5 (eBioscience, 45-0454-82), c-Kit-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 
25-1171-81) Sca-1-APC-Cy7 (BioLegend, 108126), FcγR-BV510 (BioLegend, 101333), 
CD150-PE, and CD34-A660 (eBioscience, 50-0341-80). Dead cells were excluded using 
Zombie Aqua™ Dye (BioLegend, 423102). For intracellular Ki67/DAPI staining, 
unfractionated BM cells were stained with Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-APC-eFluor780, Sca-1-PE-
Cy7 (BioLegend, 108113), CD150-PE and CD48-A647 and HSCs identified without Flk2, 
Isolated cells were washed in PBS, fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 30 
min at 4°C, washed in Permwash, permeablized with Cytoperm Plus for 10 min at room 
temperature, washed again in Permwash, and stained with anti-Ki67-FITC (eBioscience, 
11-5698-80) in Permwash for 2h at 4°C. Cells were washed with Permwash and re-
suspended in PBS/3% FBS containing 1 μg/ml DAPI and incubated for 20 min prior to 
analysis. Cell isolation was performed on a FACSAria II or III (Becton Dickenson) using 
double sorting, and cell analyses were performed using a FACS LSR II (Becton Dickenson). 
Additional antibody information, including clones and dilutions, are listed in Supplementary 
Table 3.
 Cell culture
All cultures were performed at 37°C in a 5% CO2 water jacket incubator (Thermo 
Scientific). Cells were grown in StemPro34 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 
penicillin (50 U/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and L-glutamine (2 mM), SCF (25 ng/ml), 
Flt3L (25 ng/ml), IL-11 (25 ng/ml), IL-3 (10 ng/ml), GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), Epo (4 U/ml) and 
Tpo (25 ng/ml) (Peprotech). IL-1α or IL-1β (Peprotech) was added at 25 ng/ml and M-CSF 
(Peprotech) at 100 ng/ml where indicated. For expansion assays, cells (400/well) were

 directly sorted into 96-well plates and cultured for up to 8 days. For surface marker tracking 
experiments, cells (2,500–5,000/well) were directly sorted into 96-well plates and cultured 
for up to 8 days. Cytokines were refreshed every other day by removing ~30% of the total 
well volume and replacing with fresh media, and cultures were split as needed. For cleaved 
caspase-3 and ATP activity assays, cells (400/well) were directly sorted into 384-well white 
luminescence culture plates containing 40 μl of media. Either directly after sorting or after 
12hr an equal volume of Caspase-Glo 3/7 or CellTiter Glo substrate (Promega) was added to 
wells and the assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. For pathway 
blockade assays, HSC were cultured for 12h ± 25pg/ml IL-1β with either DMSO vehicle 
(1:1000 dilution) or 10 μm PD-0325901 (MEK inhibitor; Shanghai Chemokine Co., CAS 
391210-10-9), 10 μm Rottlerin (PKC inhibitor; Tocris, 1610), 10 μm SB203580 (p38 
inhibitor; Millipore, 559389), 10 μm BMS-345541 (IKK inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich, B9935), 
10 μm PP2 (Src inhibitor; Calbiochem, 529576), 50 μm LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor; Cell 
Signaling, 9901), and 200 μm Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich, R8781). For M-
CSFR blocking assays, 10 μg/ml purified anti-M-CSFR (Biolegend, 135501) or Rat IgG2a 
isotype control (Biolegend, 400501) were added to the culture media. For colony formation 
assays, cells (100/1 ml/3 cm dish, or 1/100 μl/well of a 96-well plate) were cultured in 
methylcellulose (Stem Cell Technologies, M3231) supplemented with the above cytokines 
and colonies were scored visually after 7 days. For serial replating, cells from primary 
methylcellulose cultures in 3 cm dishes were disaggregated and washed three times in PBS, 
and 1×104 cells were re-plated in fresh methylcellulose without IL-1β. For morphology 
analyses, 5×104 cells were spun directly onto glass slides using a Cytospin centrifuge 
(Beckman) and stained with Wright-Giemsa according to standard protocols. For BrdU 
incorporation assays, cells (5,000/well) were directly sorted into 96-well plates and cultured 
for 24hr in the presence of 60 μM BrdU (Sigma). Cells were then fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS/50mM 
NH4Cl, permeablized with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS, washed once in 0.2% PBS/3% BSA, 
incubated with anti-BrdU-APC (BD Biosciences, 51-23619L) for 30 min at room 
temperature, washed once more, re-suspended in 0.2% PBS/3% BSA and analysed on a 
FACS LSR II as described above. For CFSE dilution assays, cells (at least 5000 per point) 
were labelled with CFSE as previously described58 and cultured for up to 60 hour before 
analyses.
 Lentiviral transduction
Lentiviral transduction experiments were performed as previously described59. Filtered 
lentiviral supernatants were produced by the UCSF ViraCore facility from empty and PU.1-
containing pCAD-GFP constructs34 (gift from Dr. Ulrich Stiedl, Albert Einstein Medical 
College, New York, USA) with titers ranging from 1×106 to 4.5×106 infectious viral 
particles per ml. Freshly isolated HSCs were rested in StemPro medium without cytokines 
for 2hr and subsequently spin-infected with a 1:5 to 1:20 dilution of viral supernatant at 
37°C for 90 min. Viral supernatants were removed and cells were cultured overnight (8–12 
hours) in medium + cytokines. Spin-infection was repeated the next morning. GFP+ 
transduced cells were analysed for myeloid surface marker expression starting 1 day after 
the last spinoculation.

  Continuous single-cell tracking
HSCs isolated from PU.1-eYFP mice (200 per chamber) were cultured within fibronectin-
pre-coated silicon chamber inserts (IBIDI, Martinsried, Germany) placed inside a sealed 
25cm2 tissue culture flasks containing CO2-saturated StemPro medium supplemented as 
described above, and 1 μg/ml custom-conjugated Sca-1-A647 and FcγR-A555 antibodies for 
continuous live staining by time-lapse microscopy as described28. Briefly, culture flasks 
were imaged on a Zeiss CellObserver system (Zeiss, Hallbergmoos, Germany) with a 
motorized stage and 37°C heated culture chamber. Phase-contrast images were obtained 
using a 10x objective (Zeiss) and recorded by an AxioCamHRm camera controlled with 
self-written Timm’s Acquisition Tool (TAT) and Zeiss AxioVision 4.5 software. In addition, 
three fluorescence channels (YFP, A555 and APC) were acquired using mercury or xenon 
lamps. Phase-contrast images were acquired every 180 seconds, and fluorescence images for 
each channel every 240 minutes. Single-cell tracking analysis was performed using self-
written Timm’s Tracking Tool (TTT) software described previously28. Individual cells were 
manually analysed and annotated at each time frame for relevant features including division, 
apoptosis, and fluorescence, and data were subsequently stored as individual trees for each 
cell. HSCs were tracked for two subsequent generations (three total cell divisions). Rare 
apoptotic cells, or those with questionable identities or outlier division kinetics (i.e., initial 
division shorter than 12h or longer than 48h), were excluded from the analyses. Cells 
undergoing endomitosis during the tracking period (i.e., differentiating into megakaryocytes) 
were also excluded from the analyses. PU.1-eYFP reporter levels of bulk cells were 
automatically quantified from background-corrected fluorescence images at 0 and 15hr 
using self-written CAT software (T.S., unpublished). For individual tracked cells, PU.1-
eYFP levels were quantified from fluorescence images of each tracked cell, acquired prior to 
the first division, using ImageJ software.
 Gene expression
For direct qRT-PCR analysis, 1×104 cells were cultured ± IL-1β for 12hr or isolated directly 
from IL-1-treated mice and resuspended into Trizol LS (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and reverse-
transcribed using a Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). 200 cell-equivalents of cDNA per sample 
were run in triplicate in 384-well qRT-PCR plates (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 7900HT 
Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using 2x Sybr Green master mix 
(Applied Biosystems). Ct values were normalized to Gapdh and relative changes were 
calculated using the ΔΔCt method. For Fluidigm gene expression analyses, pools of 100 
cells were directly sorted per well of a 96-well plate containing 5ul of 2x CellsDirect 
reaction buffer (Invitrogen) and snap-frozen on dry ice until use. RNA was reverse-
transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and subjected to 18 rounds of pre-amplification 
using a custom-designed set of target-specific primers as described30. Pre-amplification 
products were subsequently treated with Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) to remove 
excess primers and diluted in DNA dilution buffer (Clontech). Pre-amplified cDNAs and 
custom-designed primer sets were loaded onto a Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC and 
run on a BioMark System (Fluidigm) using SsoFast Sybr Green for detection (BioRad). 
Data were analysed using Fluidigm software and normalized to Gusb expression. For 
analysis of Il1a and Il1b expression, pools of 100 cells were directly sorted into 2x

 CellsDirect reaction buffer and pre-amplified as described above, and 1μl of pre-amplified 
cDNA per sample was run in triplicate in 384-well qRT-PCR plates using KAPA Fast Sybr 
Green Master Mix (KAPA Biosystems) on the ABI 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System. Ct 
values were normalized to B-actin and relative changes were calculated using the ΔΔCt 
method. Primer information, including sequences and NCBI gene IDs, are included in 
Supplementary Table 4.
 Cytokine analyses
For PB serum, blood was harvested from euthanized mice via cardiac puncture, allowed to 
coagulate at room temperature for 30 min, and subsequently spun down at 12,000 × g for 10 
min to remove blood cells. For BM plasma, the four long bones (two femurs and two tibiae) 
of the same mice were flushed with 150–200 μl HBSS/2% FBS using a 0.3cc insulin syringe 
with a 28g needle and spun at 500 × g for 5 min to remove BM cells. Supernatants were 
further clarified by spinning down at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and samples were subsequently 
stored at −20°C until use. For cytokine measurement, 50 μl of 2x-diluted sample was 
analysed with a Luminex Cytokine Mouse 20-plex panel (Life Technologies) using a 
BioPlex instrument (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. M-CSF levels 
were analysed using an antibody sandwich ELISA kit (Raybiotech) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
 Statistics and reproducibility
All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated as indicated. N indicates the 
numbers of independent experiments performed. For in vivo experiments, sample sizes were 
predetermined based on estimation of the minimum number of animals required to obtain 
biologically meaningful results (at least 80% power). For other experiments no statistical 
method was used to predetermine sample size, and replicate experiments were performed 
based on the variability of results obtained, as well as experiment type. Data were expressed 
as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.0 
software (GraphPad). Pairwise statistical significance was evaluated by two-tailed Mann-
Whitney u-test or Student’s t-test. Statistical significance between multiple groups was 
evaluated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s or Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. The 
experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. Source data are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Exact P-values and 
statistical tests used are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

 the BM, primarily by granulocytes (Gr) and CD4+ T cells and has minimal impact on HSC 
function. Upon infection or injury, IL-1 is produced at elevated levels in the BM 
microenvironment, in particular by endothelial cells (EC) that form an essential component 
of the HSC niche, and thus can provide localized IL-1 signalling to HSC. In this context, 
IL-1 functions as an ‘emergency’ signal that directly instructs HSCs towards myeloid 
differentiation, via activation of the NF-κB pathway and engagement of a PU.1-dependent 
myeloid gene program resulting in accelerated cell division and precocious differentiation 
into myeloid progenitors and ultimately mature myeloid cells. While such a response is 
advantageous in the context of acute inflammation and blood regeneration, it is ultimately 
detrimental in situations of chronic exposure since IL-1 exposed HSCs lose their ability to 
differentiate into the lymphoid and erythroid lineages, and exhibit decreased self-renewal 
activity and regenerative potential in response to replicative challenges such as 
transplantation. However, these damaging consequences are fully reversible upon IL-1 
withdrawal, indicating that IL-1 effects are essentially transient and require continuous 
exposure to negatively impact HSC function. Source data for b–f are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1. Data are means ± S.D.; * p ≤ 0.05. All P-values were determined by 
Mann-Whitney u test. Exact P-values, number of replicates used to derive statistical data (n) 
and statistical tests used are shown in Supplementary Table 2.
