Abstract
Background: Microbial communities present in environmental waters constitute a reservoir for antibiotic-resistant
pathogens that impact human health. For this reason, a diverse variety of water environments are being analyzed
using metagenomics to uncover public health threats. However, the composition of these communities along the
coastal environment of a whole city, where sewage and beach waters are mixed, is poorly understood.
Results: We shotgun-sequenced 20 coastal areas from the city of Montevideo (capital of Uruguay) including beach
and sewage water samples to characterize bacterial communities and their virulence and antibiotic resistance
repertories. As expected, we found that sewage and beach environments present significantly different bacterial
communities. This baseline allowed us to detect a higher prevalence and a more diverse repertory of virulence and
antibiotic-resistant genes in sewage samples. Many of these genes come from well-known enterobacteria and
represent carbapenemases and extended-spectrum betalactamases reported in hospital infections in Montevideo.
Additionally, we were able to genotype the presence of both globally disseminated pathogenic clones and
emerging antibiotic-resistant bacteria in sewage waters.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first in using metagenomics to jointly analyze beaches and the sewage
system from an entire city, allowing us to characterize antibiotic-resistant pathogens circulating in urban waters.
The data generated in this initial study represent a baseline metagenomic exploration to guide future longitudinal
(time-wise) studies, whose systematic implementation will provide useful epidemiological information to improve
public health surveillance.

Introduction
Human activity shapes the microbial communities resid-
ing in urban environments. In particular, urban sewage
systems are designed to evacuate human wastes from
the houses to areas of low human exposure and grad-
ually reinstate them into natural watercourses such as
creeks, beaches, or the sea. This cycle is of tremendous
importance for public health as waste waters can be a
reservoir and vehicle for the transmission of pathogenic
bacteria and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Indeed,
the rapid emergence and spread of pathogenic bacteria
with extensive antibiotic resistance has been recognized
by the World Health Organization as a top health issue
[1], since water can easily move microorganisms be-
tween humans and other animal species. Accordingly,
the analysis of environmental waters is being adopted as
an
effective
method
to
monitor
the
dynamics
of
antibiotic-resistant pathogens [2], as this kind of envi-
ronments can play a role as important as clinical settings
for the selection of antibiotic resistance [3].

 exploration
of
microbial
communities
based
on
culture-independent approaches using metagenomics.
This enables us to quantify and functionally characterize
environmental microbiomes with unprecedented preci-
sion and comprehensiveness [4]. Indeed, the very recent
implementation of this methodology to explore the mi-
crobial diversity in the urban environment is providing a
completely new layer of information to be integrated in
the management of cities, potentially assisting decisions
that range from urban design to public health [5, 6]. In
particular, urban sewage or beach water systems have
been previously characterized using metagenomics not
only aiming to uncover ecological patterns [7] but also
to characterize pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bac-
teria [8, 9]. However, the joint analysis of bacterial com-
munities present at the same time in the sewage and
beach waters from the same metropolitan area remains
to be explored in depth.
Sewage waters have been shown to accurately reflect
the population’s gut microbiota composition [10], raising
the possibility of using metagenomics to directly gain in-
formation about infection dynamics [11]. Additionally,
beaches not only are important for recreational use but
also are frequently recognized as risky environments for
the contagion and transmission of bacterial infections
[12], particularly if they are constantly or sporadically
impacted by sewage spillovers. Accordingly, we per-
formed a cross-sectional shotgun metagenomic analysis
along the urban coast of Montevideo, the capital of
Uruguay, aiming to characterize bacterial communities
present in the sewage and beach water due to the im-
portant role of these environments for human health. Our
study is centered in the assessment of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, representing the first of that kind in a South
American city and the kickoff towards the incorporation
of metagenomics in the surveillance of microbiological
risks at city scale.
Results
Composition of sewage and beach communities
First, we explored the structure of microbial communi-
ties present in our beach and sewage samples using a
multiset k-mer counting approach. This strategy pro-
vides an unbiased view that is not affected by taxonomic
or functional assignment; conversely, it just evaluates the
differential abundance of unique DNA segments [13].
Figure 1a shows a clustering analysis based on this
methodology that shows a complete discrimination be-
tween sewage and beach samples, suggesting substantial
differences in the composition of communities in these
environments. Second, we confirmed the observed dis-
crimination from a taxonomic point of view by calculat-
ing relative abundances of bacterial species present in
each sample using an approach based on the identifica-
tion and quantification of marker genes [14]. Figure 1b
shows a dendrogram based on beta diversities (between
samples) calculated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity

profiles,

 complete discrimination between beach and sewage. Beta
diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) was 0.42 within sew-
age samples (SD = 0.23) and 0.41 within beach samples
(SD = 0.22) but increased to 0.63 (SD = 0.12) when com-
paring sewage against beach samples. Alpha diversity
(within samples) was calculated using the Shannon index
and averaged 3.65 (SD = 0.64) for sewage and 3.71 (SD =
0.42) for beach samples (Additional file 1: Figure S1). As
expected, these results indicate that taxonomic compos-
ition of bacterial communities from these environments
are substantially different and can discriminate between
beach or sewage origin (geographic location of each sam-
ple along the coast of Montevideo is displayed in Fig. 1c).
This provided us the baseline to compare their repertories
of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes.
Occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
Due to the impact of fecal contamination in sewage
water, we hypothesized that these samples were more
rich and diverse in antibiotic resistance mechanisms
than beach water. To test this, metagenomic assemblies
were screened against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Re-
sistance Database (CARD) [15], because it is currently
the most up-to-date and manually curated resource for
ARGs detection. We found that 108 out of 2177 (~ 5%)
ARGs had hits in our samples and they belong to 10 dif-
ferent antibiotic classes (Additional file 2: Table S2). The
clinically relevant TEM-4 and TEM-33 betalactamases were
the most frequent genes and aminoglycoside-modifying en-
zymes (like acetyltransferases or phosphotransferases) the
most diversely represented class of ARGs. In particular, a
significant difference (p = 0.002, Mann-Whitney U test) in
ARG occurrence and a significantly higher diversity (p =
0.0024, Mann-Whitney U test) of ARGs according to the
Simpson’s index were found in favor of sewage compared to
beach samples (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Furthermore,
when inspecting antibiotic classes, we observed that sewage
samples encoded ARGs belonging to 90% of antibiotic clas-
ses found in these environments while beach samples only
encoded 40% of antibiotic classes, evidencing a more com-
plex composition of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in the
urban sewage waters (Fig. 2a). Indeed, only elfamycin resist-
ance genes were present in beach but absent in sewage sam-
ples. On the other side, the occurrence of ARGs for
aminoglycosides, betalactams, tetracyclines, sulfonamides,
macrolides, and streptogramins was significantly greater (p
< 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) in sewage compared to beach
samples (Fig. 2b).
Distribution of ARGs in mobile elements
As a general trend, we found that ARGs present in our
samples were more prevalent in plasmids than in bacter-
ial chromosomes. Specifically, ARGs for sulfonamides,
betalactams, aminoglycosides, phenicols, macrolides and

 streptogramins were more prevalent in plasmids than in
bacterial chromosomes (Fig. 3a). Additionally, these
plasmids
carrying
ARGs
are
extensively
distributed
among many clinically relevant enterobacteria like E.
coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter,
and Acinetobacter, among others (Fig. 3b). ARGs for tet-
racyclines, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones, and elfamy-
cins were more frequently encoded in chromosomes.
We also looked for integrons and found a higher
prevalence of them in sewage (74%) than in beach (24%)
samples. Furthermore, clinically relevant integron classes
1, 2, and 3 were almost exclusively found in sewage sam-
ples (~ 90%) (Fig. 3c). Also, we were able to identify cas-
sette ARGs with conserved attC sites associated to 24
out of 39 integrons (61%). These cassette genes mostly
coded for multidrug efflux pumps, but also we found
carbapenemases (OXA family), GES extended-spectrum
betalactamases (ESBLs), aadA1 aminoglycoside nucleoti-
dyltransferases, cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferases,
and aac6-Ib amikacin resistance genes. These cassette
genes were exclusively found in sewage integrons.
Occurrence of virulence factors (VFs)
To complement the characterization of ARGs, we also
screened metagenomic assemblies against the Virulence
Factor Database (VFdb) [16]. Ninety-nine out of 451 (~
22%) VFs were detected in our samples. Specifically, VFs
were found in 7 out of 8 (87.5%) sewage samples and 4
out of 12 (33%) beach samples. Sewage samples also pre-
sented a higher occurrence and diversity of VFs compared
to beach samples (Additional file 1: Figure S3A). The
functional classification of these VFs showed that those in-
volved in bacterial motility, cell adherence, iron uptake,
and secretion were predominant among sewage samples.
Interestingly, we found the presence of the ShET2 entero-
toxin (senB) in a single sewage sample. We also examined
the taxonomic distribution of these VFs and found that
they are predominantly distributed in Pseudomonas, Sal-
monella, Escherichia, Yersinia, and Shigella, among others
(Additional file 1: Figure S3B). These results highlight the
importance of urban waters as a reservoir and vehicle for
VFs responsible of determining well-known pathogenic
mechanisms in clinically relevant bacteria.
Taxa carrying mobile ARGs and VFs are sewage
biomarkers
We also aimed to identify bacterial taxa associated to
sewage or beach that can explain the observed differ-
ences in the composition of the overall bacterial com-
munity and their ARGs and VFs repertories. Then, we
applied a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and effect
size estimation [17] to determine statistically significant
taxa associated to beach or sewage. We summarized the
results at the genus level and found 6 genera associated
to the beach environment while 47 genera were charac-
teristic of the sewage environment (Fig. 4a). Interest-
ingly, 10 out of 47 (~ 21%) sewage-associated genera
comprise bacterial species that are well-known human
pathogens, including Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, Arco-
bacter,
Citrobacter,
Enterobacter,
Klebsiella,
Pseudo-
monas,
Sphingobacterium,
Stenotrophomonas
and
Streptococcus (Fig. 4b). Most of these taxa match with
those found carrying mobile ARGs and VFs.
Identification of pathogenic genotypes
To gain further insight on the microbiological risks in
these environments, we attempted to resolve the pres-
ence of previously reported pathogens at the strain level

 using metagenome-derived multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) [18, 19]. Despite the fact that this method was
unable to identify complete previously reported se-
quence types (STs), the detection of partial allele
combinations allowed us to infer the presence of sev-
eral genotypes of clinical importance. In sewage sam-
ples, we found three alleles of Citrobacter freundii
whose combination determines the ST-209, which has
been detected from isolates recovered from diarrheal
patients [20]. Also, we detected three alleles from
Escherichia coli defining the clonal complex ST-131,
which is a globally disseminated multidrug-resistant
clone associated with human extraintestinal (urinary
and bloodstream) infections [21]. Furthermore, the
detection of two alleles of Arcobacter cryaerophilus
defined the presence of ST-392, a recently character-
ized genotype causative of persistent diarrhea [22].
We also identified several Salmonella alleles that di-
verged from known genotypes, preventing the infer-
ence
of
putative
STs.
Many
unknown
alleles
of
Pseudomonas fluorescens were also identified both in
sewage and beach samples. This species is mainly as-
sociated to food spoilage but has been sporadically re-
ported as an opportunistic human pathogen causing
systemic infections associated to the consumption of
animal byproducts [23]. Overall, these results indicate
the presence of pathogenic genotypes in urban waters
of Montevideo.
Discussion
Pharmaceutical products, including antibiotics, can be
only partially metabolized by humans, so these com-
pounds or their derived metabolites are excreted [24]
lastly reaching the environment. Sewage pipes have been
largely considered as passive water transport systems,
but recent studies uncovered hotspots of microbial di-
versity and activity in these urban environments. Indeed,
the sewage system is the first step of city wastewater
cycle and thus the most likely place where excreted
antibiotic
residues
can
induce
the
emergence
of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria [25]. This is particularly rele-
vant since recent studies have demonstrated that micro-
bial communities present in the sewage recapitulate
those found in the human gut microbiome [10]. Conse-
quently, the exposure of human-derived bacteria to en-
vironmental pressures facilitates the emergence and
spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that can be
transmitted and impact population’s health [26].
The baseline characterization of urban waters in our
capital city revealed an expected distinct taxonomic
composition of bacterial communities found in sewage
and beach environments, suggesting that hazardous

 bacteria present in sewage waters are rapidly diluted
when mixed with environmental freshwater. Indeed, the
vast majority of virulence and antibiotic resistance
mechanisms associated to clinically relevant pathogens
were found in the sewage but not in beach samples.
However, a more dense and longitudinal sampling is ne-
cessary to further characterize the dynamics of hazard-
ous microorganisms circulating in these environments.
Also, the comparison with metagenomes from hospital
effluents along the city would provide a detailed picture
of
how
nosocomial
pathogens
are
being
dispersed
through the environment.
Indeed, many clinically relevant ARGs that we found
in the city environment, such as carbapenemases and
ESBLs, have been frequently reported in nosocomial
infections in Uruguay during the last decade [27–30].
This indicates that important antibiotic-resistant patho-
gens are being somehow transmitted among clinical
settings and the urban environment, representing a
public health threat. However, other ARGs such as
metallo-β-lactamases that have also been reported in
Uruguay [31–34] were not found in the sewage or bea-
ches. Beyond technical biases that are possible, this can
be attributed to a differential capacity between dis-
tinct antibiotic-resistant clones to survive and spread
in the environment; given that selective fitness of
antibiotic-resistant pathogens (adapted to high anti-
biotic pressures in hospital settings) may be lower in
less-exposed environmental waters [35].
In this sense, despite the urban environment not being
directly exposed to similar concentrations of antibiotics
than those used to treat infections, sewage systems have
been recognized as ARG reservoirs. So, considering that
we found most environmental ARGs typically wide-
spread in enterobacterial plasmids and that clinically
relevant integrons were fundamentally recovered from
sewage samples, genetic platforms for horizontal gene
transfer can be playing a relevant role as a reservoir of
ARGs. Additionally, plasmids and integrons are prone to
recombination [36] and genetic plasticity of certain bac-
teria has been proved to increase under subinhibitory
pressures (as those probably found in the environment)
with certain antibiotics [37]. So, the city sewage should
be also considered as a birthplace for new antibiotic re-
sistance mosaics mediated by recombination and hori-
zontal gene transfer.
Regarding this, we were able to identify multidrug-resistant
genotypes with great capacity of recruiting new resistance
genes like the internationally disseminated E. coli ST-131
clonal complex. Also, we uncovered the presence of clinically
underestimated bacteria like Arcobacter cryaerophilus, which
is today considered an emerging waterborne pathogen and
whose resistance to third-generation cephalosporins has been
already reported [38]. So, the compositional complexity of
urban waters where different genotypes and gene repertories
can coexist within a fluctuating bacterial community opens
the possibility of using environmental samples to monitor
population’s health. However, the detection of environ-
mental DNA by metagenomics does not necessarily indi-
cate the presence of viable bacteria, so the extrapolation
to antibiotic-resistant phenotypes from biomarker se-
quences should be validated with traditional microbiology
approaches. For this reason, we are also creating the Bac-
terial Biobank of the Urban Environment (BBUE), which
consists in phenotyped and whole-genome sequenced iso-
lates obtained from the same sampling points that we per-
formed metagenomics [39]. Accordingly, the integration
of these complementary data will provide the framework
to support the possibility of using high-resolution metage-
nomics
to
study
the
epidemiological
dynamics
of
antibiotic-resistant pathogens using urban waters as a
proxy at the population level.
Conclusion
Our study represents a cross-sectional analysis of a
metropolitan area encompassing more than 2.2 million
inhabitants and, to the best of our knowledge, consti-
tutes the first work using metagenomics to jointly
characterize bacterial communities found in the sewage
and beach waters of an entire city.
Our approach demonstrated its usefulness to identify
antibiotic resistance determinants which were known to
be present in nosocomial infections, as well as to un-
cover the presence of globally-widespread or underesti-
mated pathogens with strain-level resolution. Future
longitudinal studies (time-wise) will be useful to monitor
the fluctuations of bacterial communities, allowing the
development of associative models with relevant meta-
data like outbreak information, rainfall, or antibiotic pre-
scription and stewardship.
The data generated in this initial study represent a
baseline metagenomic characterization of environmental
waters of Montevideo, which will be useful to guide fu-
ture efforts to implement systematic studies aiming to
evaluate antibiotic-resistant pathogen dynamics through
time and space across different cities. This information
can be later incorporated to improve public health sur-
veillance for antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
Methods
Sample collection
The coastal city of Montevideo spans over a 20-km long
system of sandy beaches. The municipal sewage system
of the city connects over 90% of houses in the urban
area, whose wastes are finally pumped to a single treat-
ment facility placed in the peninsula of Punta Carretas
(34°56′15.3″ S 56°09′36.4″ W) which filters out most
macroscopic particles before delivering wastewater 5 km

 away inside the estuary Rio de la Plata. However, the
western region of the city is still not connected to this
system and sewage pipes pour wastewater directly in the
shore. We collected 20 water samples from 12 beaches
and 8 sewage pipes. Beach samples are distributed along
the whole coastal line of Montevideo, while sewage sam-
ples represent those points in the western region where
wastewater is directly poured into the shore (Fig. 1c,
Additional file 3: Table S1). The samples were collected
all on the same day (around 3 h elapsed from the first to
the last). All samples were collected using sterile 200 mL
plastic bottles and preserved in ice until they were proc-
essed within the same day.
DNA purification, metagenomic sequencing and quality
analysis
Each sample was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 15 min at 4 °
C. The supernatants we discarded and pellets were proc-
essed using the FastDNA™ Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s protocol. Extraction controls
were included but as they resulted negative in a PCR using
16S universal primers, they were not included for subse-
quent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Paired end (2 ×
125 bp) sequencing reads were generated on the Illumina
HiSeq2500 machine, yielding in average 39.2 M (SD ± 5.4
M) reads per sample. Initial data quality inspection was
performed with FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.bab-
raham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) and then reads were filtered
and trimmed using Trimmomatic [40] with the following
parameters: LEADING:20, TRAILING:20, SLIDINGWIN-
DOW:5:20, AVGQUAL:20, and MINLEN:90. On average,
30.85 M (SD ± 4.07 M) reads passed this filter and were
used in all further analyses. Sequencing data was depos-
ited at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repository under
BioProject number PRJNA515946.
Metagenomic data analysis
First, an unbiased description of the variability among
communities in sewage and beach was obtained by run-
ning Simka [13] with default parameters. This method
builds k-mer abundance vectors from raw reads that are
subsequently used to calculate classical ecological dis-
tances to compare between samples. Second, MetaPh-
lan2 [14] was used to identify species and to determine
their relative abundances across samples. Beta diversities
were
calculated
over
taxonomic
profiles
using
the
Bray-Curtis distance as implemented in the Vegan R
package [41], and alpha diversities were calculated using
the Shannon index in the base R package [42]. The iden-
tification of environment-associated biomarker taxa was
performed with LEfSe, an approach that calculates effect
sizes using a linear discriminant analysis from relative
abundances (of taxa in this case) [17]. Characterization
of bacterial pathogens at the strain level was performed
with metaMLST [19], which tries to identify multilocus
sequence typing alleles directly from metagenomic se-
quences by mapping reads against reference genes.
Metagenomes
were
de
novo
assembled
for
each
sample with MEGAHIT [43]. Then, contigs over 1 kb
were retained and merged at 99% of identity using
CD-HIT-EST [44]. Resulting contigs were secondary as-
sembled using Minimus2 [45] requiring a minimum
overlap of 100 bp with at least 95% of identity at contig
boundaries. A mean of 19,065 (SD = 6500) contigs longer
than 1000 bp were obtained per sample. Mean N50 for
these contigs was 2051 bp (SD = 336) and mean L50 was
5111 (SD = 1996). Additional assembly statistics can be
found at Additional file 3: Table S1. Genes were pre-
dicted on the resulting contigs using Prodigal [46]. Anti-
biotic resistance and virulence genes were identified
with Abricate (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) by
comparing contigs against CARD [15] and VFdb [16],
respectively. Only hits with query coverage > 90% and
sequence identity > 70% were kept.
The occurrence of ARGs in chromosomes or plasmids
was determined using BLAST+ blastx [47] against 10,393
complete plasmid sequences from the NCBI RefSeq data-
base (updated on 20 September 2017), and against the
representative set of 2064 closed bacterial chromosomes
from the PATRIC database [48]. Hits with > 70% of query
coverage and > 70% of amino acidic identity were kept.
Taxonomic classification was extracted from the descrip-
tion header of both plasmids and chromosomes.
Integrons were identified using IntegronFinder [49]. We
used MAFFT [50] (with the L-INS-i option) to align the
amino acid sequences of IntI genes recovered from meta-
genomes together with reference sequences of class 1 (IntI1,
AAQ16665.1), class 2 (IntI2, AAT72891.1), class 3 (IntI3,
AAO32355.1), class 4 (IntI4, AAC 38424), and class 5 (IntI5,
AAD 55407.2) integrases. The resulting alignment was used
to build a phylogenetic tree with RAxML [51]. Scripts used
to process metagenomic data are freely available at http://
