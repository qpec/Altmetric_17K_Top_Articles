ABSTRACT  
Purpose: To assess the effects of sucrose versus glucose ingestion on post-exercise 
liver and muscle glycogen repletion. Methods: Fifteen well-trained male cyclists 
completed 2 test days. Each test day started with glycogen-depleting exercise, followed 
by 5 h of recovery, during which subjects ingested 1.5 g·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ sucrose or glucose. 
Blood was sampled frequently and 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging 
were employed 0, 120, and 300 min post-exercise to determine liver and muscle 
glycogen concentrations and liver volume. Results: Post-exercise muscle glycogen 
concentrations increased significantly from 85±27 vs 86±35 mmol·L-1 to 140±23 vs 
136±26 mmol·L-1 following sucrose and glucose ingestion, respectively (no differences 
between treatments: P=0.673). Post-exercise liver glycogen concentrations increased 
significantly from 183±47 vs 167±65 mmol·L-1 to 280±72 vs 234±81 mmol·L-1 following 
sucrose and glucose ingestion, respectively (time x treatment, P=0.051). Liver volume 
increased significantly over the 300 min period after sucrose ingestion only (time x 
treatment, P=0.001). As a result, total liver glycogen content increased during post-
exercise recovery to a greater extent in the sucrose treatment (from 53.6±16.2 to 
86.8±29.0 g) compared to the glucose treatment (49.3±25.5 to 65.7±27.1 g; time x 
treatment, P<0.001), equating to a 3.4 g·h-1 (95%CI: 1.6 to 5.1 g·h-1) greater repletion 
rate with sucrose vs glucose ingestion. Conclusion: Sucrose ingestion (1.5 g·kg-1·h-1) 
further accelerates post-exercise liver, but not muscle glycogen repletion when 
compared to glucose ingestion in trained athletes. 
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02344381.

New & Noteworthy statement (69 words) 
 
This is the first study to assess both muscle and liver glycogen repletion post-exercise 
after ingesting different types of carbohydrates in large amounts. We observed that 
sucrose ingestion accelerates post-exercise liver glycogen repletion compared to 
glucose ingestion in spite of lower insulinemia and reduced gut discomfort. Therefore, 
when rapid recovery of endogenous carbohydrate stores is a goal, ingestion of sucrose 
at 1.5 g/kg/h would be more appropriate than glucose.

INTRODUCTION 
1 
Carbohydrates are a main substrate source used during prolonged moderate to high 
2 
intensity exercise (35, 42). Both exogenous and endogenous carbohydrate stores 
3 
can contribute to carbohydrate oxidation during exercise. Endogenous carbohydrate 
4 
stores include liver and skeletal muscle glycogen, which can provide sufficient 
5 
energy to sustain 45-60 min of high-intensity exercise (8, 10). However, at longer 
6 
exercise durations (>60 min) endogenous glycogen stores may become depleted, 
7 
causing early fatigue (1, 4-6, 9, 16, 20, 39). Due to the apparent relationship between 
8 
glycogen depletion and exercise capacity (1, 4-6, 9, 12, 19, 20), the main factor 
9 
determining the time needed to recover from exhaustive exercise is the rate of 
10 
glycogen repletion. This is particularly relevant when exercise performance needs to 
11 
be regained within 24 h, for example during tournament-style competitions or in 
12 
between stages in races such as during the Tour de France.  
13 
Previous studies have shown that muscle glycogen repletion rates can reach 
14 
maximal values when glucose (polymers) are ingested in an amount of 1.2 g·kg-1·h-1 
15 
(2, 43), with no further improvements at higher glucose ingestion rates (18). It has 
16 
been speculated that post-exercise muscle glycogen synthesis rates may be further 
17 
increased when ingesting multiple transportable carbohydrates (i.e., mix of glucose 
18 
and fructose). Glucose and fructose are absorbed by several similar (GLUT2, GLUT8 
19 
and GLUT12) as well as different intestinal transporters (SGLT1 and GLUT5, 
20 
respectively) (24, 37). Hence, the combined ingestion of both glucose and fructose 
21 
may augment intestinal carbohydrate uptake and accelerate their subsequent 
22 
delivery into the circulation (24, 37). To date, only one study investigated this 
23 
hypothesis, showing no further improvements in post-exercise muscle glycogen 
24 
repletion rates after the ingestion of ~1.2 g·kg-1·h-1 (or 90 g·h-1) of multiple 
25 
transportable carbohydrates compared to an equivalent dose of glucose (44).  
26 
The use of multiple transportable carbohydrates is potentially more relevant for liver 
27 
  
 
 
 
 3 
glycogen repletion, as fructose is preferentially metabolized and retained in the liver 
28 
(30). Factors that contribute to this are the high first pass extraction of fructose by the 
29 
liver and the high hepatic expression of fructokinase and triokinase, which are 
30 
essential enzymes for the metabolism of fructose (30). Furthermore, it has been 
31 
shown that intravenously administered fructose leads to greater increases in liver 
32 
glycogen content when compared with intravenous glucose administration (33). Yet, 
33 
few studies have tried to assess the effects of carbohydrate ingestion on post-
34 
exercise liver glycogen repletion (9, 14, 15, 31). This is mainly due to obvious 
35 
methodological limitations, as liver biopsies are not considered appropriate for 
36 
measuring liver glycogen concentrations for research purposes in vivo in humans 
37 
(17). With the introduction of 13C-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (13C-MRS), a 
38 
non-invasive measurement to study changes in liver and muscle glycogen (40, 41), it 
39 
has been demonstrated that post-exercise liver glycogen resynthesis is stimulated by 
40 
carbohydrate ingestion (9, 14, 15). Only two studies assessed the effects of fructose 
41 
ingestion on post-exercise liver glycogen resynthesis rates. Décombaz et al. (14) 
42 
reported elevated liver glycogen resynthesis rates when co-ingesting fructose with 
43 
maltodextrin (~0.93 g·kg-1·h-1), whereas Casey et al. (9) reported no differences in 
44 
post-exercise liver glycogen repletion following ingestion of ~0.25 g·kg-1·h-1 glucose 
45 
versus sucrose (9). No study has assessed the impact of ingesting multiple 
46 
transportable carbohydrates on both liver and muscle glycogen repletion when 
47 
optimal amounts of carbohydrate are ingested during post-exercise recovery.  
48 
We hypothesize that ingestion of large amounts of sucrose leads to higher liver and 
49 
muscle glycogen repletion rates when compared to the ingestion of the same amount 
50 
of glucose. To test this hypothesis, 15 well-trained cyclists completed glycogen 
51 
depleting exercise, after which we applied 13C MRS to compare liver and muscle 
52 
glycogen repletion rates following the ingestion of 1.5 g·kg-1·h-1 sucrose or 1.5 g·kg-
53 
1·h-1 glucose during 5 hours of post-exercise recovery.

METHODS 
55 
 
56 
Subjects 
57 
Fifteen well-trained male cyclists participated in this study (age: 22±4 y, bodyweight: 
58 
74.4±7.5 kg, body mass index: 22.6±1.8 kg/m2, maximal workload capacity (Wmax): 
59 
350±30 W, peak oxygen uptake (
peak): 61.5±5.2 mL·kg-1·min-1). Subjects were 
60 
fully informed of the nature and possible risks of the experimental procedures, before 
61 
written informed consent was obtained. Trials were conducted at the Newcastle 
62 
Magnetic Resonance Centre (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK) in accordance with the 
63 
Second Declaration of Helsinki, and following approval from the Northumbria 
64 
University Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Ethics Committee. 
65 
 
66 
Preliminary testing 
67 
All subjects participated in a screening session, which was performed 1 wk before 
68 
the first experiment. Subjects performed an incremental cycling test on an 
69 
electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Velotron, RacerMate Inc., Seattle, WA, 
70 
USA) to determine maximal workload capacity (Wmax) and peak oxygen uptake 
71 
(
peak). Following a 5 min warm-up at 100 W, the workload began at 150 W and 
72 
was increased by 50 W every 2.5 min to exhaustion (27). Expired gas was sampled 
73 
continuously to determine oxygen uptake (Oxycon gas analyser, CareFusion 
74 
corporation, San Diego, CA, USA). 
75 
 
76 
Diet and physical activity  
77 
All subjects received the same standardized dinner (2797 kJ; 666 kcal; providing 
78 
23.9 g fat, 83.7 g carbohydrate and 23.9 g protein) the evening before each test day. 
79 
All volunteers refrained from exhaustive physical activity 24 h before each main trial 
80 
and kept their diet as constant as possible 2 d before each experimental day. In 
81 
  
 
 
 
 5 
addition, subjects filled in food intake and physical activity diaries for 2 d before the 
82 
start of the first and second trial.  
83 
 
84 
Study design 
85 
Participants performed 2 trials in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design 
86 
separated by at least 7 d. During each trial, they were first subjected to a glycogen 
87 
depletion protocol on a cycle ergometer. Thereafter, subjects were studied for 5 h 
88 
while ingesting only glucose in the control trial (GLU) or sucrose in the SUC trial. 
89 
During the 5 h post-exercise recovery period, subjects remained at rest in a supine 
90 
position. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) was performed immediately 
91 
post-exercise and after 2 and 5 h of post-exercise recovery to determine liver and 
92 
muscle glycogen concentrations. In addition, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
93 
was performed immediately post-exercise and after 2 and 5 h of post-exercise 
94 
recovery to determine liver volume.  
95 
 
96 
Experimental protocol 
97 
Participants arrived at Newcastle Magnetic Resonance Centre at 0700-0730 h 
98 
following a 12 h fast. Liver and muscle glycogen depletion was established by 
99 
performing an intense exercise protocol on an electromagnetically braked cycle 
100 
ergometer (26). The exercise protocol started with a 10 min warm-up at 50% Wmax. 
101 
Thereafter, subjects cycled for 2-min block periods at alternating workloads of 90% 
102 
and 50% Wmax, respectively. This was continued until subjects were no longer able to 
103 
complete a 2 min, 90% Wmax exercise period at a cycling cadence of 60 rpm. At this 
104 
point, the high intensity blocks were reduced to 80% Wmax after which the same 
105 
regimen was continued. When subjects were no longer able to complete the 2 min 
106 
blocks at 80% Wmax, the exercise intensity of the blocks was further reduced to 
107 
70%. Subjects were allowed to stop when pedaling speed could not be maintained at 
108 
  
 
 
 
 6 
70% Wmax. Water was provided ad libitum during the exercise protocol. Two fans 
109 
were placed 1 m from the subjects to provide cooling and air circulation during the 
110 
exercise protocol. After cessation of exercise, gastrointestinal (GI) comfort was 
111 
assessed using a visual analogue scale. Subsequently, the participants underwent a 
112 
basal MRS and MRI measurement for approximately 45 min (Fig. 1). After this, they 
113 
were allowed to take a brief ( 15 min) shower before the post-exercise recovery 
114 
period started. While supine, a catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein of the 
115 
forearm to allow frequent blood sampling. Following a resting blood sample (10 mL), 
116 
subjects filled out another visual analogue scale for GI comfort before the first test 
117 
drink was given (t=0 min). Participants were observed for the following 5 h during 
118 
which they received a drink with a volume of 3.33 mL·kg-1 every 30 min until t=270 
119 
min. Blood samples were taken at 15 min intervals for the first 90 min of recovery 
120 
and every 30 min thereafter until t=300 min. Further visual analogue scales for GI 
121 
comfort were completed every 30 min until t=300 min. Due to time constraints of the 
122 
MR measurement it was not possible to acquire a blood sample and collect a visual 
123 
analogue scale at time point t=150 min. At t=120 and 300 min in the post-exercise 
124 
recovery period another MR measurement was performed to assess liver and muscle 
125 
glycogen concentrations as well as liver volume.  
126 
 
127 
GI (dis)comfort 
128 
Subjects were asked to fill out computerized visual analogue scales to assess GI 
129 
comfort. The visual analogue scales consisted of 16 questions. Each question 
130 
started with “To what extent are you experiencing … right now?” and was answered 
131 
by ticking a 100 mm line (0 mm = not at all, 100 mm = very, very much). The 
132 
questions consisted of six questions related to upper GI symptoms (nausea, general 
133 
stomach problems, belching, an urge to vomit, heartburn, stomach cramps), four 
134 
questions related to lower GI symptoms (flatulence, an urge to defecate, intestinal 
135 
  
 
 
 
 7 
cramps, diarrhea), and six questions related to central or other symptoms (dizziness, 
136 
a headache, an urge to urinate, a bloated feeling, side aches (left), side aches 
137 
(right)).  
138 
 
139 
Drinks 
140 
Subjects received a drink volume of 3.33 mL·kg-1 every 30 min during recovery to 
141 
ensure a given dose of 1.5 g·kg-1·h-1 glucose (GLU) or 1.5 g·kg-1·h-1 sucrose (SUC). 
142 
To minimize differences in carbon isotope ratio between GLU and SUC, similar plant 
143 
sources with low natural 13C enrichments (i.e. wheat, potato and beet sugar, all of 
144 
which use C3 metabolism) were selected for use in this study. The carbohydrates in 
145 
the glucose drink (GLU) consisted of 60% dextrose monohydrate (Roquette, 
146 
Lestrem, France) and 40% maltodextrin (MD14, AVEBE, Veendam, The 
147 
Netherlands). The carbohydrate in the sucrose drink (SUC) consisted of 100% 
148 
sucrose derived from sugar beet (AB Sugar, Peterborough, United Kingdom). Both 
149 
drinks contained 20 mmol·L-1 NaCl (Tesco, Cheshunt, United Kingdom).  
150 
 
151 
Measurement of muscle and liver glycogen concentrations 
152 
Glycogen concentration was determined from the magnitude of the natural 
153 
abundance signal from the C-1 carbon of glycogen at a frequency of 100.3 ppm. A 
154 
Philips 3 Tesla Achieva scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) was 
155 
used with a 6 cm diameter 13C surface coil with integral 1H decoupling surface coil 
156 
(PulseTeq, Worton under Edge, UK) to measure muscle glycogen concentration and 
157 
an in-house built 12 cm 13C/1H surface coil used to measure liver glycogen 
158 
concentration. The intra-individual coefficient of variation of hepatic glycogen content 
159 
measured by 13C MRS has been shown to be 7% (36). 
160 
For muscle glycogen concentration measurements, the surface coil was placed over 
161 
the widest part of the vastus lateralis muscle and was held in position with fabric 
162 
  
 
 
 
 8 
straps to prevent movement. Pulse power was calibrated to a nominal value of 80° 
163 
by observing the power dependent variation in signal from a fiducial marker located 
164 
in the coil housing, containing a sample exhibiting 13C signal with short T1 (213 mM 
165 
[2-13C]-acetone and 25 mM GdCl3 in water). Automated shimming was carried out to 
166 
ensure that the magnetic field within the scanner was uniform over the active volume 
167 
of the 13C coil. The 13C spectra were acquired over 15 min using a non-localized 1H 
168 
decoupled 13C pulse-acquire sequence (TR 120 ms, spectral width 8 kHz, 7000 
169 
averages, WALTZ decoupling). 1H decoupling was applied for 60% of the 13C signal 
170 
acquisition to allow a relatively fast TR of 120 ms to be used within Specific 
171 
Absorption Rate safety limitations. 
172 
For liver glycogen measurements the 13C/1H surface coil was placed over the right 
173 
lobe of the liver. Spectra were acquired over 15 min using non-localized 1H 
174 
decoupled 13C pulse acquisition sequences (TR 300 ms, spectral width 8 kHz, 2504 
175 
averages, WALTZ decoupling, nominal 13C tip angle of 80°). Scout images were 
176 
obtained at the start of each study to confirm optimal coil position relative to the liver.  
177 
Tissue glycogen concentration was calculated from the amplitude of the C1-glycogen 
178 
13C signal using Java Based Magnetic Resonance User Interface (jMRUI) version 3.0 
179 
and the AMARES algorithm [7]. For each subject the separation between RF coil and 
180 
muscle / liver tissue was measured from 1H images, and 13C coil loading assessed 
181 
from 13C flip angle calibration data. Tissue glycogen concentration was determined 
182 
by comparison of glycogen signal amplitude to spectra acquired from liver- and leg-
183 
shaped phantoms filled with aqueous solutions of glycogen (100 mM) and potassium 
184 
chloride (70 mM). Phantom data were acquired at a range of flip angles and 
185 
separation distances between coil and phantom. Quantification of each human 13C 
186 
spectrum employed a phantom dataset matched to body geometry and achieved flip 
187 
angle so that account differences in coil sensitivity profile and loading were taken into 
188 
account for each subject. 
189 
  
 
 
 
 9 
 
190 
Measurement of liver volume 
191 
A turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted axial images of 
192 
the liver with a repetition time (TR) of 1687 msec. The matrix size was 188x152 mm, 
193 
with a field of view of (303x240x375) mm. The body coil was used for both 
194 
transmission and reception. Slice thickness was 10 mm with a 0 mm gap. Scans 
195 
were obtained on expiration. The total number of liver slices used for volume analysis 
196 
differed between subjects due to anatomical differences but numbered on average 
197 
20 slices. Liver volumes were measured in the open source Java image processing 
198 
program ImageJ (38). 
199 
 
200 
Calculation of liver glycogen content 
201 
Total liver glycogen content was calculated by multiplying liver volume with liver 
202 
glycogen concentration. Subsequent conversion from mM to g was performed by 
203 
using the molar mass of a glycosyl unit (i.e., 162 g·M-1).  
204 
 
205 
Plasma analysis 
206 
Blood samples (10 mL) were collected in EDTA-containing tubes and immediately 
207 
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Plasma was then aliquoted and stored at -
208 
80°C for subsequent determination of glucose and lactate concentrations (Randox 
209 
Daytona spectrophotometer, Randox, Ireland), insulin (IBL International, Hamburg, 
210 
Germany) and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations (WAKO Diagnostics, 
211 
Richmond, VA). 
212 
 
213 
Statistics 
214 
Sample size estimation was based on previous data on liver glycogen content (14). 
215 
Based on this, the expected effect size was calculated from the difference in post-
216 
  
 
 
 
 10 
exercise liver glycogen content after ingesting a mixture of maltodextrin with fructose 
217 
vs glucose (polymer) (52±23 vs 23±9 g, respectively). A sample size of n=10 in a 
218 
crossover design would provide statistical power above 90% with an α-level of 0.05. 
219 
We therefore recruited 15 participants to ensure adequate power and ample data 
220 
sets. 
221 
Unless otherwise stated, all data are expressed as mean±SD. Differences between 
222 
primary outcomes in the text and the data in the figures are presented as mean±95% 
223 
confidence interval (CI). All data were analyzed by two-way repeated measures 
224 
ANOVA with treatment (GLU vs SUC) and time as within-subject factors. In case of a 
225 
significant interaction, Bonferroni post hoc tests were applied to locate the 
226 
differences. For non-time-dependent variables, a paired Student’s t-test was used to 
227 
compare differences between treatments. A P value <0.05 was used to determine 
228 
statistical significance. All calculations were performed by using the SPSS 21.0.0.0 
229 
software package.

RESULTS 
233 
 
234 
Glycogen depletion protocol 
235 
Maximal workload capacity measured during preliminary testing averaged 350±30 W 
236 
(4.75±0.6 W/kg). Consequently, average workload settings in the depletion protocol 
237 
were 315±27, 280±24, 245±21, 175±15 W for the 90, 80, 70, and 50% Wmax workload 
238 
intensity respectively. On average, subjects cycled a total of 21±7 and 19±5 high-
239 
intensity blocks, which resulted in a total cycling time of 93±27 and 89±21 min in the 
240 
SUC and GLU experiments, respectively. Total cycling time did not differ between 
241 
trials (P=0.434).  
242 
 
243 
Drink ingestion and gastrointestinal complaints 
244 
The total amount of drink ingested in both treatments was 2.48±0.25 L. The first 
245 
drinks were ingested 75±7 min after cessation of exercise, due to timing of the MR 
246 
measurements. Subjects reported upper GI issues following ingestion of the glucose 
247 
drink only, and these issues included nausea, general stomach problems, belching 
248 
and urge to vomit. These symptoms all displayed significant differences over time 
249 
and between treatments (time x treatment, P<0.05; data not shown) and for every 
250 
symptom the sucrose drink was better tolerated than the glucose drink. 
251 
 
252 
Liver glycogen concentration 
253 
No significant differences in baseline liver glycogen concentrations were found 
254 
between SUC and GLU (P=0.210; Table 1). Liver glycogen concentrations increased 
255 
significantly over time during post-exercise recovery in both SUC and GLU 
256 
(P<0.001). Liver glycogen repletion rates during 5 h of post-exercise recovery in SUC 
257 
and GLU were 19±8 versus 14±12 mmol·L-1·h-1, respectively (P=0.052). Differences

in liver glycogen repletion rates between SUC vs GLU were 5.8 mmol·L-1·h-1 (95%CI: 
259 
0.4 to 11.2 mmol·L-1·h-1). 
260 
 
261 
Liver volume 
262 
Liver volume data are shown in Table 1. Over the 5 h post-exercise recovery period, 
263 
liver volume increased significantly in SUC (P=0.036), whereas no significant 
264 
changes were observed in GLU (P=0.151). A significant time x treatment interaction 
265 
was found between SUC and GLU (P=0.001).  
266 
 
267 
Liver glycogen content 
268 
Liver glycogen content increased over time in both treatments (P<0.01; Fig. 2). Over 
269 
time, liver glycogen content increased significantly more in the SUC compared to the 
270 
GLU treatment (time x treatment interaction, P<0.001). Liver glycogen repletion rates 
271 
during 5 h of post-exercise recovery in SUC and GLU were 6.6±3.3 versus 3.3±3.0 
272 
g·h-1, respectively (P=0.002). Differences in liver glycogen repletion rates between 
273 
SUC vs GLU were 3.4 g·h-1 (95%CI: 1.6 to 5.1 g·h-1), leading to a 17 g difference 
274 
(95%CI: 8 to 26 g) over the 5 h recovery period.        
275 
 
276 
Muscle glycogen concentration 
277 
No significant differences in baseline muscle glycogen concentrations were observed 
278 
between SUC and GLU (P=0.940; Fig. 3). Muscle glycogen concentrations increased 
279 
significantly over the 5 h recovery period in both SUC and GLU (P<0.001). No 
280 
significant differences were observed between treatments (time x treatment, 
281 
P=0.673). Muscle glycogen repletion rates during 5 h of post-exercise recovery in 
282 
SUC and GLU were 11±3 versus 10±5 mmol·L-1·h-1, respectively (P=0.558). 
283 
Differences in muscle glycogen repletion rates between SUC vs GLU were 0.9 
284 
mmol·L-1·h-1 (95%CI: -1.9 to 3.6 mmol·L-1·h-1). 
285

286 
Plasma analyses 
287 
In both experiments, plasma glucose concentration increased during the first 45 min 
288 
of post-exercise recovery, after which concentrations gradually declined to baseline 
289 
values (Fig. 4A). Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly higher at t=60, 75 
290 
and 90 min in the GLU compared to SUC treatment (P<0.05), whereas they were 
291 
significantly higher in the sucrose treatment at time point 270 min (P<0.05). Plasma 
292 
lactate concentrations increased significantly after 15 min in the SUC trial compared 
293 
to GLU and remained significantly higher over the entire post-exercise recovery 
294 
period (P<0.01; Fig. 4B). Plasma insulin concentrations increased during the first 120 
295 
min of post-exercise recovery. Thereafter, plasma insulin concentrations decreased 
296 
but remained elevated compared to baseline values during the entire post-exercise 
297 
recovery period (Fig. 4C). Plasma insulin concentrations were significantly higher in 
298 
the GLU compared with the SUC treatment at t=45, 75 and 90 min (P<0.05). Plasma 
299 
NEFA concentrations decreased immediately after carbohydrate ingestion and 
300 
remained low over the entire recovery period, with no differences between 
301 
treatments (Fig. 4D).

DISCUSSION 
305 
In this experiment we observed that sucrose ingestion (1.5 g·kg-1·h-1) during recovery 
306 
from exhaustive exercise results in more rapid liver glycogen repletion, despite lower 
307 
plasma insulin levels, when compared with the ingestion of glucose. Ingestion of 
308 
sucrose or glucose did not result in differences in post-exercise muscle glycogen 
309 
repletion rates.  
310 
Carbohydrate ingestion during 5 h of post-exercise recovery allowed substantial 
311 
increases in muscle glycogen concentrations (Figure 3). This represents muscle 
312 
glycogen repletion rates of 10±5 mmol·L-1·h-1 after glucose ingestion and 11±3 
313 
mmol·L-1·h-1 after sucrose ingestion. Assuming a skeletal muscle mass density of 
314 
1.112 g·cm3 (46) and a wet-to-dry mass ratio of 4.28 (22), our muscle glycogen 
315 
repletion rates assessed using 13C MRS would translate to glycogen repletion rates 
316 
of 39±20 and 42±11 mmol·kg-1 dw·h-1, respectively. These values are in line with 
317 
previously published data on post-exercise muscle glycogen resynthesis rates when 
318 
ingesting ample amounts of carbohydrate (~1.2 g·kg-1·h-1), based upon muscle 
319 
biopsy collection and concomitant muscle glycogen analyses, showing values 
320 
ranging between 30-45 mmol·kg-1 dw·h-1 (3, 23, 43, 44). We did not observe 
321 
differences in muscle glycogen repletion rates following ingestion of either sucrose or 
322 
glucose (polymers) during the 5 h post-exercise recovery period (P=0.558). Hence, 
323 
muscle glycogen resynthesis rates are not limited by exogenous carbohydrate 
324 
availability when large amounts of glucose, glucose polymers and/or sucrose (≥1.2 
325 
g·kg-1·h-1) are consumed. This supports the contention that ingestion of ≥1.2 g 
326 
carbohydrate·kg-1·h-1 maximizes post-exercise muscle glycogen synthesis rates. This 
327 
also implies that the limitation in exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates residing in 
328 
the rate of intestinal glucose absorption does not impose a restriction for post-
329 
exercise muscle glycogen synthesis in a post-exercise resting condition. 
330 
After exhaustive exercise, the ingestion of glucose and sucrose resulted in liver 
331 
  
 
 
 
 15 
glycogen repletion rates of 14±12 and 19±8 mmol·L-1·h-1, respectively. These liver 
332 
glycogen repletion rates together with our observed liver glycogen content values 
333 
(Figure 2) are comparable to previous observations made by Décombaz and 
334 
colleagues (14). However, we extend on previous work by showing a doubling of liver 
335 
glycogen synthesis rates during recovery from exercise when sucrose as opposed to 
336 
glucose (polymers) were ingested (6.6±3.3 versus 3.3±3.0 g·h-1, respectively: 
337 
P=0.002). When looking at the present data together with the results of Décombaz et 
338 
al. (14), it can be concluded that ingestion of both submaximal (~0.93 g·kg-1·h-1) and 
339 
maximal amounts (1.5 g·kg-1·h-1) of multiple transportable carbohydrates further 
340 
accelerate post-exercise liver glycogen repletion compared to the ingestion of 
341 
glucose (polymers) only. These observations can be attributed to the differential 
342 
effects that glucose and fructose exert on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. Glucose 
343 
is a relatively poor substrate for hepatic glycogen synthesis (14, 32, 33) and much of 
344 
it seems to be released into the systemic circulation to be either oxidized or stored as 
345 
muscle glycogen (7, 10, 11). In contrast, fructose is primarily taken up by the liver 
346 
where it can be phosphorylated and converted to glycogen or metabolized to lactate 
347 
and glucose (28, 29). Lactate will subsequently be released into the bloodstream for 
348 
oxidation in extrahepatic tissues or can be used as substrate for muscle glycogen 
349 
synthesis (via gluconeogenesis) (45). In agreement, we observed substantial 
350 
differences in circulating plasma lactate concentrations between treatments (Figure 
351 
4B).  
352 
With liver glycogen contents returning to 66 and 87 g it seems that hepatic glycogen 
353 
stores were not fully replenished within the 5 h recovery period, despite ingesting 
354 
large amounts of glucose and sucrose. Liver glycogen content was significantly 
355 
greater and closer to a normal liver glycogen content of ~100 g (21) following 
356 
sucrose ingestion when compared to glucose ingestion. Since a significant 
357 
relationship has been found between liver glycogen content at the end of post-
358 
  
 
 
 
 16 
exercise recovery and subsequent exercise time-to-exhaustion (9), sucrose as 
359 
opposed to glucose ingestion may be of benefit for those athletes who need to 
360 
maximize performance during a subsequent exercise task. To put this into 
361 
perspective, the difference in liver glycogen content (15-20 g; 57-76 kJ assuming 
362 
22% efficiency) could provide enough energy to sustain an additional 3-5 minutes of 
363 
exercise at 75% Wmax. This difference is by no means negligible for trained cyclists 
364 
as it represents a 7-14% difference in time to exhaustion (9). Future research should 
365 
aim to prove the ergogenic benefit of accelerating liver glycogen repletion on 
366 
subsequent performance in various (laboratory) exercise settings. 
367 
Besides the benefits of sucrose over glucose (polymer) ingestion to maximize liver 
368 
glycogen repletion, we also observed much better tolerance to the ingestion of large 
369 
amounts (1.5 g·kg-1·h-1) of sucrose when compared with glucose (polymers). In the 
370 
present study we found considerably lower subjective ratings of upper gastro-
371 
intestinal complaints (including nausea, general stomach problems, urge to vomit 
372 
and belching) after sucrose as opposed to glucose ingestion (P<0.05). These 
373 
findings are not surprising, as after ingesting large amounts (≥1.2 g/kg/h) of a 
374 
multiple transportable carbohydrate source (i.e., sucrose) more transporters in the 
375 
gastrointestinal tract will be utilized, thereby decreasing water retention, enhancing 
376 
absorption and subsequently causing less upper abdominal discomfort when 
377 
compared to the ingestion of glucose (polymers) only (13).  The form in which these 
378 
carbohydrates are ingested may be of lesser importance, as previous work has 
379 
shown no differences in post-exercise muscle glycogen repletion when ingesting 
380 
carbohydrate in either liquid or solid form (25, 34). 
381 
In conclusion, post-exercise sucrose ingestion (1.5 g·kg-1·h-1) accelerates liver, but 
382 
not muscle glycogen repletion when compared with glucose (polymer) ingestion. 
383 
Ingestion of large amounts of sucrose are better tolerated than glucose (polymers), 
384 
  
 
 
 
 17 
making sucrose a more practical carbohydrate source to ingest during acute, post-
385 
exercise recovery.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the experiment. The initial glycogen depletion exercise protocol 
was followed by three 13C MRS & MRI measurements at t=0, t=120 and t=300 min of post-exercise 
recovery. The test drink was ingested every 30 min from t=0 to t=270 min in the post-exercise recovery 
period as indicated in the figure. Blood samples were obtained every 15 min during the first 90 min of 
post-exercise recovery. Thereafter they were obtained every 30 min. Visual analogue scales of 
gastrointestinal (GI) comfort were obtained immediately post-exercise and every 30 min thereafter. At 
t=150 min, no blood sample and visual analogue scale were obtained due to MR scanning.
