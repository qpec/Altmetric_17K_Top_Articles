Summary
Background The achievement of glycaemic control remains challenging for patients with type 1 diabetes. We assessed 
the effectiveness of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy 
in people with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes aged 6 years and older.
Methods In this open-label, multicentre, multinational, single-period, parallel randomised controlled trial, participants 
were recruited from diabetes outpatient clinics at four hospitals in the UK and two centres in the USA. We randomly 
assigned participants with type 1 diabetes aged 6 years and older treated with insulin pump and with suboptimal 
glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7·5–10·0%) to receive either hybrid closed-loop therapy or sensor-
augmented pump therapy over 12 weeks of free living. Training on study insulin pump and continuous glucose 
monitoring took place over a 4-week run-in period. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned using central randomisation 
software. Allocation to the two study groups was unblinded, and randomisation was stratified within centre by low 
(<8·5%) or high (≥8·5%) HbA1c. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time that glucose concentration was within 
the target range of 3·9–10·0 mmol/L at 12 weeks post randomisation. Analyses of primary outcome and safety measures 
were done in all randomised patients. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02523131, and is closed 
to accrual.
Findings From May 12, 2016, to Nov 17, 2017, 114 individuals were screened, and 86 eligible patients were randomly 
assigned to receive hybrid closed-loop therapy (n=46) or sensor-augmented pump therapy (n=40; control group). The 
proportion of time that glucose concentration was within the target range was significantly higher in the closed-loop 
group (65%, SD 8) compared with the control group (54%, SD 9; mean difference in change 10·8 percentage points, 
95% CI 8·2 to 13·5; p<0·0001). In the closed-loop group, HbA1c was reduced from a screening value of 8·3% (SD 0·6) 
to 8·0% (SD 0·6) after the 4-week run-in, and to 7·4% (SD 0·6) after the 12-week intervention period. In the control 
group, the HbA1c values were 8·2% (SD 0·5) at screening, 7·8% (SD 0·6) after run-in, and 7·7% (SD 0·5) after 
intervention; reductions in HbA1c percentages were significantly greater in the closed-loop group compared with the 
control group (mean difference in change 0·36%, 95% CI 0·19 to 0·53; p<0·0001). The time spent with glucose 
concentrations below 3·9 mmol/L (mean difference in change –0·83 percentage points, –1·40 to –0·16; p=0·0013) 
and above 10·0 mmol/L (mean difference in change –10·3 percentage points, –13·2 to –7·5; p<0·0001) was shorter 
in the closed-loop group than the control group. The coefficient of variation of sensor-measured glucose was not 
different between interventions (mean difference in change –0·4%, 95% CI –1·4% to 0·7%; p=0·50). Similarly, total 
daily insulin dose was not different (mean difference in change 0·031 U/kg per day, 95% CI –0·005 to 0·067; p=0·09) 
and bodyweight did not differ (mean difference in change 0·68 kg, 95% CI –0·34 to 1·69; p=0·19). No severe 
hypoglycaemia occurred. One diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in the closed-loop group due to infusion set failure. 
Two participants in each study group had significant hyperglycaemia, and there were 13 other adverse events in the 
closed-loop group and three in the control group.
Interpretation Hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery improves glucose control while reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia 
across a wide age range in patients with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes.

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes represents 5–10% of cases with diabetes 
worldwide, and is presently incurable.1 Achievement of 
recommended glycaemic control remains challenging 
across all age groups,2 in part because tight glycaemic 
control increases the risk of hypoglycaemia.3,4
Over the past decade, considerable progress has been 
made in the development of closed-loop insulin delivery 
systems (the artificial pancreas), which couple continuous 
glucose monitoring and algorithm-directed insulin pump 
delivery.5 Hybrid closed-loop systems are characterised 
by automated insulin delivery, apart from when the user

administers insulin boosts at meal time. In 2017, the first 
hybrid closed-loop system entered clinical use on the 
basis of a pivotal safety non-randomised, single-arm trial 
of a hybrid closed-loop system in patients with type 1 
diabetes.6
Two meta-analyses of randomised trials reported that 
outpatient use of closed-loop systems increases the time 
sensor-measured glucose is near-normoglycaemia, and 
reduces the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia.7,8 
However, most trials had a small sample size, a short 
intervention period, and were done predominantly in 
adults. Only two studies9,10 reported glycated haemo-
globin [HbA1c] outcomes. This implies that effectiveness 
assessments from larger and appropriately designed and 
powered clinical trials are needed to support reim-
bursement and wider adoption of hybrid closed-loop 
systems.
In the present multicentre randomised trial, we 
hypothesised that the use of a hybrid closed-loop system 
improves glucose control and reduces the risk of 
hypoglycaemia compared with sensor-augmented pump 
therapy in individuals with suboptimally controlled 
type 1 diabetes. Hybrid closed-loop was applied over 
12 weeks in a mixed population, including adults, 
adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older. We 
studied people with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes 
because we anticipated that this population might accrue 
particular benefits subject to satisfactory compliance and 
regular closed-loop use.
Methods
Study design
The study had an open-label, multicentre, multinational 
(the UK and the USA), randomised, parallel design. 
Insulin was delivered by contrasting day-and-night hybrid 
closed-loop (closed-loop group) or sensor-augmented 
pump therapy (control group) during free living over 
12 weeks.11 Participants were recruited from diabetes 
outpatient clinics at four hospitals in the UK and two 
centres in the USA (see below).
Before study initialisation, approval was received from 
an independent research ethics committee in the UK (East 
of England–Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee), 
independent review boards in the USA (Jaeb Center for 
Health Research Institutional Review Board), regulatory 
authorities in the UK (Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency) and in the USA (Food and Drug 
Administration). Safety aspects were overseen by an 
independent data safety monitoring board. The study 
protocol is available online. 
Participants
Inclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, as defined by 
WHO,12 for at least 1 year, insulin pump therapy for 
at least 3 months, and HbA1c between 7·5% and 10% 
(58–86 mmol/mol). Participants were aged 6 years or 
older, with an equal proportion of children and young 
adults aged between 6 years and 21 years, and adults aged 
22 years and older. Key exclusion criteria included regular 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published up to 
June 12, 2018, using the terms (“artificial pancreas” OR 
“closed-loop”) AND (“type 1 diabetes mellitus” OR “diabetes”) 
AND (“outpatient” OR “home”) AND (“randomised” OR 
“randomised controlled trial”), for reports of randomised 
controlled trials published in English only. We identified 
27 randomised trials that tested automated or semiautomated 
glucose control outside hospital settings. Outpatient use of 
automated insulin delivery systems is associated with an 
increased percentage of time during which sensor glucose is 
within the near normoglycaemic range, and reduced 
hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, while modestly reducing 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in studies that were of long 
enough duration to report results for HbA1c. 13 of the 27 trials 
assessed day-and-night use of closed-loop systems. Seven of 
these 13 trials tested insulin-only systems, of which one trial 
assessed long-term use (≥12 weeks) of 24 h per day, 
7 days per week, closed-loop. However, this study was done in 
adults only, and the participant number was small (n=33).
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this multinational, multicentre study is the 
largest randomised study of closed-loop use in outpatient 
settings so far. It is also the longest randomised outpatient 
study of 24 h per day, 7 days per week, closed-loop use in 
children as young as 6 years and older. We showed that 
compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, 
day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery 
significantly improved the percentage of time spent within 
the glucose target range (3·9–10·0 mmol/L) and mean 
glucose concentrations, and led to a significant decrease in 
HbA1c while reducing hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia 
in a mixed population with suboptimally controlled 
type 1 diabetes. These improvements were seen irrespective 
of age.
Implications of all the available evidence
The use of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery 
improves glycaemic control while reducing the risk of 
hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children with 
type 1 diabetes compared with conventional pump therapy or 
sensor-augmented pump therapy. Results from our study 
together with those from previous studies support the 
adoption of closed-loop technology in clinical practice across 
all age groups.

use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in the 
preceding 3 months, history of one or more episodes of 
severe hypoglycaemia in the preceding 6 months, and 
substantially reduced hypoglycaemia awareness in par-
tici 
pants aged 18 years and older, as defined by a Gold 
score of 5 or more.13 A complete list of all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria is provided in the appendix.
We identified eligible adults from diabetes clinics 
attending Addenbrooke’s Hospital (Cambridge, UK), 
Manchester Royal Infirmary (Manchester, UK), Inter-
national Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet (Minneapolis, 
MN, USA), and Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes (Aurora, 
CO, USA). Children and adolescents were recruited from 
paediatric diabetes centres at Addenbrooke’s Hospital 
(Cambridge, UK), Royal Hospital for Sick Children 
(Edinburgh, UK), Leeds Teaching Hospital (Leeds, UK), 
and International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet, 
(Minneapolis, MN, USA). Eligible children and adolescents 
were identified by clinical teams at each centre, and were 
recruited by member of the local study team.
Study participants aged 16 years or older in the UK, 
18 years or older in the USA, and parents or guardians of 
participants aged 15 years or younger in the UK and 
17 years or younger in the USA gave written informed 
consent; written assent was obtained from minors.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible participants who met criteria after the run-in 
period (see below) were randomly assigned using central 
randomisation software (SAS, version 9.4) to the use of 
day-and-night hybrid closed-loop or sensor-augmented 
pump therapy. The randomisation was stratified within 
centre by low (<8·5%) or high (≥8·5%) HbA1c. Implicit 
randomisation by age applied, given that each centre 
recruited either children and young adults (6–21 years), or 
adults (≥22 years). PC (study statistician) generated the 
sequence, which was used by local research teams to enrol 
and assign participants to the trial groups.
Procedures
Participants in both study groups used a modified 
640G insulin pump (investigational use only; Medtronic, 
Northridge, CA, USA), Enlite 3 glucose sensor (Medtronic), 
and Contour Next Link 2.4 glucometer (Ascensia Diabetes 
Care, Basel, Switzerland). Participants were not remotely 
monitored or supervised, and were able to do their usual 
activities. They were free to consume any meals of their 
choice and were allowed to participate in any indoor or 
outdoor physical activity. Participants were required to be 
present at regular visit intervals to receive appropriate 
training, and to be contactable via phone or email for 
scheduled study contacts to review device use. Data from 
the study insulin pump and glucometer were downloaded 
once per week by participants using Carelink software and 
stored on Carelink Clinical server (Medtronic). Blood 
samples were drawn for HbA1c measurements at the 
hospitals where the patients were enrolled by qualified 
members of the centre’s study team. Blood samples were 
taken at baseline, and at the start and at the end of the 
respective intervention period (closed-loop intervention or 
control intervention). An age-appropriate Pedatric Quality 
of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire was administered 
to participants (participant version) and guardians of 
participants aged 17 years and younger (parent proxy 
version) before and after the intervention period.
After training on the study pump and continuous 
glucose monitoring, participants underwent a run-in 
period of at least 4 weeks. During this period, participants 
were contacted once per week. Data obtained during this 
period could be used for adjustment of the insulin therapy. 
At the end of the run-in period, adherence to the use of 
study pump and continuous glucose monitoring was 
assessed. Before being randomly assigned to treatment, 
participants were required to show use of continuous 
glucose monitoring for at least 12 days, and use of the 
bolus calculator for at least 75% of meal boluses in the 
2 weeks before randomisation.
Participants randomly assigned to the closed-loop group

Training was provided on initiation and discon 
tinuation of 
the hybrid closed-loop system, switching between closed-
loop and standard insulin pump therapy, meal bolus 
procedure, and the use of study devices during exercise. 
Competency on the use of the closed-loop system was 
assessed. After discharge, participants applied the closed-
loop system for the following 12 weeks. Participants 
randomly assigned to the control group (sensor-augmented 
insulin pump therapy) received additional training on the 
effective use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring 
for optimisation of insulin therapy. Participants were 
instructed not to activate the pump’s threshold suspend or 
predictive low glucose features. Participants were free to 
optimise their treatment independently or on advice from 
health-care professionals.
Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia alarms were acti-
vated according to personal preference and req 
uirements 
in both study groups. The participants in both study 
groups had an identical number of planned contacts with 
the local study team. Participants were contacted within 
24–48 h after the initiation of study treatment. During the 
first 2 weeks of the intervention, participants in the UK 
were contacted by phone or email, and those in the USA 
were seen in the clinic once per week. Thereafter, partici-
pants were contacted once per month. All participants 
were provided with a 24-h helpline to contact the study 
team in the event of study-related issues.
The closed-loop system (appendix) used a model 
predictive control algorithm (version 0.3.46, University of 
Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) on a smartphone (Galaxy S4, 
Samsung, Seoul, South Korea). Every 10 min, the con-
trol algorithm calculated an insulin infusion rate, which 
was set on the study pump. The control algorithm was 
initialised using preprogrammed basal insulin delivery 
downloaded from the study pump. Information about 
the participant’s bodyweight and total daily insulin 
dose were entered at set-up. The treat-to-target con-
trol al 
gorithm aimed to achieve glucose concentrations 
between 5·8 mmol/L and 7·3 mmol/L, depending on the 
accuracy of model-based glucose predictions.
The threshold suspend feature on the modified 640G 
pump was turned on during closed-loop operation and 
allowed insulin delivery to be suspended even when the 
smartphone was not within range or not operational. 
Further safety mitigations during closed-loop are detailed 
in the appendix.
HbA1c was measured locally at screening, and at a central 
laboratory (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 
USA) at the beginning and end of study interventions by 
use of an International Federation of Clinical Chemistry 
and Laboratory Medicine aligned method (Tosoh HPLC 
Glycohemoglobin Analyzer, Tosoh Medics, CA, USA; 
coefficient of variation range of 1·4–1·9%).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the between-group difference 
in the proportion of time spent in the target glucose range 
of 3·9–10·0 mmol/L (70–180 mg/dL) based on sensor-
measured glucose concentrations during the 12-week 
free-living phase.14 Secondary endpoints in 
cluded HbA1c 
concentration at 12 weeks; the mean (SD) and coefficient 
of variation of sensor-measured glucose concentrations 
over the 12-week study period; percentage of time with 
glucose concentrations in hypoglycaemia (<3·9 mmol/L, 
<3·5 mmol/L, and <2·8 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemic 
(>10·0 mmol/L and >16·7 mmol/L); the area under the 
curve below 3·5 mmol/L; insulin requirements (total, 
basal, and bolus); bodyweight; and participant and parent 
PedsQL score. A subset of end 
points, to restrict multiple 
comparisons, including the proportion of time spent in 
the glucose target range of 3·9–10·0 mmol/L, the 
percentage of time with glucose concentrations of less 
than 3·5 mmol/L, and the mean (SD) sensor-measured 
glucose concentration, was assessed during the day 
(0800 h to 2359 h) and night (2400 h to 0759 h). The utility 
analysis assessed the amount of sensor-measured glucose 
use in both study groups, and the amount of closed-loop 
system use in the closed-loop group.
The safety analysis assessed the frequency of severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes, frequency of severe hyper-
glycaemia (capillary blood glucose >16·7 mmol/L) with 
substantial ketosis (plasma ketones >0·6 mmol/L), and 
nature and severity of other adverse events, including 
diabetic ketoacidosis.
Statistical analysis
On the basis of previous day-and-night closed-loop 
studies,9,15 and an estimate of 10 percentage points 
(SD 14·5) improvement in time when glucose is within 
target range, 76 participants were required to achieve

85% power and an α level of 0·05 (two-tailed t test). 
84 participants were planned to be randomly assigned to 
allow for dropouts.
Statistical analyses were done on an intention-to-treat 
basis. Mean and SD were reported for the primary and 
secondary outcomes, which had approximately normal 
distribution. For outcomes with skewed distribution, 
median and IQR are reported. For the primary outcome 
and secondary outcomes, the treatment group differences 
were analysed using linear models, while adjusting for 
HbA1c at treatment initiation, corresponding run-in values 
for the study outcomes (ie, adjusting time spent in target 
glucose range during run-in when comparing the primary 
endpoint), and a random site effect. For comparison of 
bodyweight at 12 weeks, age and sex were additionally 
adjusted in the linear model. Normality of the residuals 
was assessed; if the residuals had highly skewed 
distribution, then ranked normal score transformation of 
outcome data was applied in the regression model and 
point estimate with 95% CI was constructed on the basis 
of the rank test.16 A per-protocol analysis was limited to 
participants with sensor glucose data availability for at least 
50% of the time over the 12-week study period (both 
groups) and closed-loop use for at least 80% of the time 
when sensor glucose data were available (closed-loop 
group). All p values reported are two-sided, and no formal 
adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. A 
5% significance level was used to declare statistical 
significance for the primary endpoint. Among the 
secondary endpoints, p values of less than 0·05 were used 
to define statistical significance for HbA1c, coefficient of 
variation of sensor glucose, percentage of time sensor 
glucose was below 3·9 mmol/L, percentage of time sensor 
glucose was above 10·0 mmol/L, total daily insulin, and 
bodyweight. For all other endpoints, statistical significance 
was defined at p values of less than 0·01. Separate p values 
for day and night glucose metrics were only calculated 
when the 24-h version of the same metric was statistically 
significant based on the above criteria. No formal statistical 
comparisons were made for safety outcomes (diabetic 
ketoacidosis and severe hyperglycaemia events) because of 
the small number of events. Outcomes were calculated 
using GStat, version 2.2.4, and statistical analyses were 
done using SAS, version 9.4.

Results
From May 12, 2016, to Nov 17, 2017, 114 individuals were 
screened. Nine participants did not meet inclusion criteria 
following screening assessment, and three withdrew 
before entering the run-in period. Another 15 participants 
did not successfully complete the run-in period. One 
participant was withdrawn after run-in because of non-
compliance. 86 eligible participants were randomly 
assigned to treatment (figure 1). 46 participants were 
assigned to the closed-loop group and 40 participants to 
the control group. Of those enrolled, 44 participants were 
aged 22 years or older, 19 were aged 13–21 years, and 
33 were aged 6–12 years.
Baseline characteristics are summarised in table 1 
(breakdown in the appendix). After the run-in period, no 
participant failed the competency assessment and no 
participant withdrew post randomisation.
Primary and secondary endpoints are summarised 
in table 2. 24-h sensor glucose profiles are shown 
in figure 2. The primary endpoint, the proportion of 
time sensor glucose was within the target range of 
3·9–10·0 mmol/L, was 10·8 percentage points higher 
(95% CI 8·2–13·5; p<0·0001) in the closed-loop group 
(65%, SD 8) than in the control group (54%, SD 9). 
Improvements in time within target range were present 
in all three age groups (<13 years, 13–21 years, ≥22 years), 
in both sexes, and for both high and low baseline HbA1c 
(appendix), with the majority of greater improvements 
present in participants with high baseline HbA1c 
(post-hoc analysis, appendix). All participants in the 
closed-loop group had an improvement in percentage of 
time spent with glucose concentrations in target range 
compared with run-in period (appendix). A consistent 
difference of 10–15 percentage points occurred between 
the two groups across the whole range of time in range 
values, and a difference of nearly 20 percentage points 
among users with the highest time in range in the 
two groups (figure 3).
In both groups, HbA1c concentration was reduced from 
screening (closed-loop 8·3% [SD 0·6], 68 mmol/mol 
[SD 7]; control 8·2% [SD 0·5], 66 mmol/mol [SD 5]) 
to post run-in assessment (closed-loop 8·0% [SD 0·6], 
63 mmol/mol [SD 7]; control 7·8% [SD 0·6], 62 mmol/mol 
[SD 6]). HbA1c concentrations were significantly lower after 
closed-loop intervention (7·4% [SD 0·6], 57 mmol/mol 
[SD 7]) compared with control intervention (7·7% [SD 0·5], 
60 mmol/mol [SD 6]), with a mean difference between 
groups favouring the closed-loop group by 0·36% (95% CI 
0·19–0·53; 4·0 mmol/mol, 95% CI 2·2–5·8; p<0·0001). 
HbA1c improvements were not different among children, 
adolescents, and adults (appendix).
Day-and-night closed-loop therapy significantly reduced 
mean glucose (p<0·0001) and time spent above target 
(p<0·0001) compared with the control group. Glucose 
variability, measured as the SD of sensor glucose was 
lower in the closed-loop group than in the control group 
(p<0·0001). The coefficient of variation of sensor glucose 
was not different between groups (p=0·50).
Closed-loop therapy significantly reduced the per-
centage of time sensor glucose was below 3·9 mmol/L 
(p=0·0130). The percentage of time spent with sensor 
readings below 3·5 mmol/L and 2·8 mmol/L was low, 
and not different between interventions (table 2). The 
burden of hypoglycaemia, as measured by the area 
under the curve when sensor glucose was less than 
3·5 mmol/L, was not different between the groups 
(p=0·08).
Increased time when glucose was within target range, 
reduced mean glucose, reduced time when glucose was 
below target, and a reduction in HbA1c was achieved by 
the closed-loop group without increasing total daily 
insulin (p=0·09). Higher basal insulin delivery than the

control group during closed-loop therapy (p<0·0001) was 
offset by lower bolus delivery (p<0·0001). The change in 
bodyweight from the screening value was not different 
between groups (closed-loop 2·2 [SD 2·3] vs control 
1·4 [SD 2·6]; p=0·19). The use of the closed-loop system 
was not associated with any additional burden, as 
assessed by the participant version of PedsQL (p=0·85) 
or the parent version (p=0·29; table 2).
Benefits of closed-loop therapy were prominent during 
the night (table 3, figure 2). Closed-loop therapy 
significantly reduced daytime and night-time mean 
glucose and glucose variability (for both, daytime 
p=0·0003, night-time p<0·0001). The proportion of time 
when glucose was within the target range, between 
3·9 mmol/L and 10·0 mmol/L, was significantly greater in 
the closed-loop group than the control group (day and 
night, both p<0·0001).
Day-and-night closed-loop therapy was used for a 
median of 71% (63–83) of the time over the 12-week 
period, and participants in the closed-loop group wore a 
glucose sensor for a median of 90% (83–95) of the time 
(appendix). Control group participants wore a glucose 
sensor over a median of 90% (81–95) of the time. The 
number of planned contacts (ie, visits, email, or phone 
calls) was the same in both groups. However, more 
unscheduled contacts took place in the closed-loop group 
than in the control group (n=69 vs n=17; appendix). In the 
closed-loop group, a greater number of threshold 
suspend events occurred during the day than the night 
(appendix).
In a prespecified per-protocol analysis of the primary 
endpoint, comprising 24 participants in the closed-loop 
group and 39 participants in the control group (appendix), 
similar results to those from the intention-to-treat analysis 
were observed (closed-loop 68% [SD 8] vs control 
54% [SD 9]; p<0·0001; appendix). These results did not 
change when less stringent per-protocol criteria were used 
(post-hoc analysis, appendix).
Post randomisation, no severe hypoglycaemia occurred 
in either study group. One diabetic ketoacidosis 
presented in the closed-loop group due to infusion set 
failure, and was not related to the closed-loop therapy 
(table 4). Two participants in each study group had 
significant hyperglycaemia with capillary glucose greater 
than 16·7 mmol/L and elevated plasma ketones 
(>0·6 mmol/L). There were 13 other adverse events in 
the closed-loop group and three in the control group 
(appendix); all were unrelated to treatment. All partici-
pants recovered fully without clinical sequelae. Protocol 
deviations were comparable between study groups 
(appendix).

Discussion
In this multinational, multicentre, open-label, random-
ised trial, we show that 12-week use of a day-and-night 
hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system, compared 
with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, was 
associated with an improvement in overall glucose 
control and a reduction in hypoglycaemia risk in 
suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes in children, 
adolescents, and adults. The hybrid closed-loop system 
was used safely during daily living without supervision 
or remote monitoring.
We report a 10·8 percentage point increase in time 
with glucose concentrations within the target glucose 
range across all age groups. This improvement resulted 
from a reduction of time spent in hyperglycaemia 
without change in total insulin delivery. We observed a 
lower amount of bolus insulin and a higher amount of 
basal insulin in the closed-loop group than in the 
control group. Lower bolus insulin requirements in the 
closed-loop group than in the control group could be 
explained by lower glucose concentrations in this group 
during closed-loop use, lessening the need for correction 
boluses. The insulin to carbohydrate ratio did not need 
to be increased, unlike in other closed-loop systems,17 
simplifying clinical adoption of our closed-loop system. 
Benefits of the closed-loop were greater overnight 
because, even with the use of a closed-loop system, 
daytime control is typically confounded by meals and 
physical activity. These improvements are attributable 
to the use of the closed-loop system alone because no 
regular adjustments of insulin pump therapy driven by 
a health-care professional took place, unlike in another 
study.17
The findings of the present study are consistent with 
results from our previous trials during free living in 
children and adolescents,9 adults with well controlled 
type 1 diabetes,18 and adults with less well controlled 
type 1 diabetes.9 This consistency of findings underpins 
the robustness of our model predictive algorithm, and 
supports the application of our closed-loop systems 
across a wide range of people with type 1 diabetes.
Use of hybrid closed-loop therapy led to a modest, but 
clinically significant, 0·36% reduction in HbA1c, com-
pared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. This 
reduction was additive to that observed during the run-in 
phase, the latter attributable to the observer bias and 
initiation of continuous glucose monitoring. The 
decrease in HbA1c during closed-loop use was slightly 
greater than that observed in two randomised trials9,10 
run for long enough to assess changes in HbA1c, both 
adopting 
sensor-augmented 
pump 
therapy 
as 
a 
comparator. Thabit and colleagues9 showed a mean 
reduction in HbA1c by 0·3% with day-and-night hybrid 
closed-loop therapy, whereas Kropff and colleagues10 
reported a reduction of 0·2% for evening-and-night 
closed-loop application. These two trials were small, with 
approximately 30 participants per trial, and closed-loop 
application was restricted to adults. In comparison, the 
present study randomly assigned 86 participants and 
the age range was wider. Improvements in HbA1c in the 
present study were consistent across all age groups.
The proportion of patients who experienced a hypo-
glycaemic event was low in the present study and 
comparable to other outpatient closed-loop studies.9,17 The 
reduction in the proportion of time spent in hypo-
glycaemia below 3·9 mmol/L with closed-loop therapy 
was statistically significant; time below 3·5 mmol/L and 
2·8 mmol/L did not reach statistical significance. Because 
no severe hypoglycaemia presented in either group, the 
effect of closed-loop therapy on severe hypoglycaemia 
remains unclear. Further reduction of hypoglycaemia risk 
might be achieved through the addition of glucagon in 
bihormonal closed-loop systems,19,20 particularly during 
exercise.21,22
The strengths of our study are the multicentre, multi-
national design and the wide age range of participants, 
which support generalisability of study findings. The 
study was done without remote monitoring or close 
supervision in free-living settings, allowing for real-world 
assessment of performance of closed-loop systems. No 
investigator-led optimisation of insulin therapy took 
place, and improve 
ments in glucose outcomes with 
closed-loop therapy are solely attributable to its use. 
Limitations include the number of devices comprising 
our hybrid closed-loop system, which increased the risk 
of device and connectivity problems, and resulted in 
more frequent non-protocol contacts to address technical 
issues. Threshold suspend and predictive low glucose 
suspend features4,23 were not enabled in the control group 
because the study objective was to compare algorithmic 
and non-algorithmic insulin delivery approaches. We 
excluded participants with HbA1c outside the range of 
7·5–10·0% and other groups, such as those with an 
impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia or a history of 
recurrent severe hypo 
glycaemia, although these sub-
groups might benefit from use of the closed-loop system.
In conclusion, we found that free-living use of hybrid 
closed-loop insulin delivery over a period of 12 weeks led to 
clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control, 
while reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia in suboptimally 
controlled type 1 diabetes in adults, adolescents, and 
children aged 6 years and older.
