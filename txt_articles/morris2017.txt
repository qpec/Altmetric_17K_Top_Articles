Background: As age is not modifiable, pregnancy risk information based on age 
alone is unhelpful for older women.
Aim: To determine severe morbidity/mortality rates for women aged ≥35 years 
according to maternal profile based on parity, pre- 
existing medical conditions 
and prior pregnancy complications, and to assess the independent contribution 
of age.
Materials and methods: Population- 
based record- 
linkage study using NSW hos-
pitalisation and birth records 2006–2012. Maternal and perinatal mortality/mor-
bidity were assessed for non- 
anomalous singleton births to women aged 
≥35 years.
Results: For 117 357 pregnancies among 99 375 women aged ≥35 years, the me-
dian age at delivery was 37 years (range 35–56 years), including: 35 652 (30.4%) 
multiparae without pre- 
existing medical or obstetric complications, 33,058 
(28.2%) nulliparae without pre- 
existing medical conditions and 30 325 (25.8%) 
multiparae with prior pregnancy complications. Maternal and perinatal mortal-
ity/morbidity varied by maternal profile with ranges of 0.9–3.5% and 2.4–11.9%, 
respectively. For nulliparae, each five- 
year increase in age did not contribute sig-
nificantly to maternal risk after controlling for medical conditions (adjustedodds 
ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.25), but did confer perinatal risk (1.14; 1.05–1.25). For 
multiparae, each five- 
year increase in age beyond 35 years was independently 
associated with adverse maternal (1.23; 1.09–1.39) and perinatal outcomes (1.23; 
1.09–1.39).
Conclusions: For women aged ≥35 years, presence of medical conditions con-
ferred a greater risk for morbidity/mortality than age itself. For multiparous 
women, the effects of medical and obstetric history were additive. The contribu-
tion of maternal age to adverse outcomes in pregnancies without significant 
medical and obstetric history is modest.

Advanced maternal age and morbidity/mortality
INTRODUCTION
Maternal age is increasing in Australia1 as in many other devel-
oped countries, driven by various and complex factors related 
to fertility and contraceptive options and socio- 
cultural trends.2 
Much societal debate has arisen from the notion that early 
planned motherhood is optimal,3 leading to the wide acceptance 
that women over the age of 35 are of ‘advanced maternal age’.4 
This is predicated on the increased risks of infertility5 and chro-
mosome anomalies6 that occur in these women and their preg-
nancies. Other complications of pregnancy such as gestational 
diabetes, hypertensive disorders and perinatal death are also 
more common as maternal age advances.7–9 However, in contrast 
to fertility and aneuploidy, which are powerfully determined by 
age, the probability of these other pregnancy complications is 
possibly more influenced by medical history and previous preg-
nancies. Despite this, many studies report outcomes as a function 
of age with limited consideration of the different circumstances 
relating to medical history.10–12
Accurate population data are important for women and cli-
nicians to understand pregnancy risks and the extent to which 
age- 
related risks are modified according to existing medical con-
ditions or previous pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study, 
therefore, was to determine the frequency of severe morbidity 
or mortality (maternal and perinatal) for women of advanced ma-
ternal age (≥35 years of age at time of birth), with and without 
co- 
existent medical conditions, and with and without previous 
obstetric history. A secondary aim of the study was to examine 
whether the contribution of maternal age to a woman’s risk of 
severe morbidity or mortality was independent of medical and 
obstetric history.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population and data sources
The study included all women who gave birth to a singleton in-
fant with no major birth defects when ≥35 years of age in New 
South Wales (NSW), Australia during January 2006 to December 
2012. Relevant data were obtained from three routine data collec-
tions: the Perinatal Data Collection (PDC) which includes records 
for all live births or stillbirths ≥20 weeks gestation or ≥400 g birth 
weight, the Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) which in-
cludes records for every inpatient admission with diagnoses and 
procedures coded according to the International Classification of 
Diseases Australian Modification (ICD- 
10AM) and the Australian 
Classification of Health Interventions (ACHI), and the Registry of 
Births Deaths and Marriages (RBDM). The data collections were 
linked by the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) using 
probabilistic linkage methods with complete linkage of mother 
and baby records for 97% of births.13,14 Anonymised data were 
provided to the researchers with linkage keys to allow merging of 
records. Ethics approval was obtained from the NSW Population 
Health Services Research Ethics Committee.
For this study, birth records were combined with maternal 
and infant hospital birth admissions to obtain a more complete 
record of each delivery. If a woman had more than one birth be-
tween 2006 and 2012, all eligible births were included. Birth and 
hospital admission records were also combined longitudinally to 
determine medical and obstetric histories for women.15 Medical 
histories were obtained from hospital records which were avail-
able from July 2000, giving a minimum of five years history for 
each woman. Multiparae were required to have information on 
their immediately preceding pregnancy available and this infor-
mation was obtained from the birth records. Birth records are 
available for a longer period, from January 1994, allowing previ-
ous births from up to 18 years prior to the pregnancy of interest 
to be included.
Exposures
The exposures of interest were maternal age, medical history and 
prior pregnancy complications. Maternal age and parity came 
from a combination of the birth and hospital records. Medical his-
tory and prior pregnancy complications that may be associated 
with adverse pregnancy outcomes were chosen in collaboration 
with clinicians and from established risk factors for future preg-
nancy complications.16
Women were considered to have significant medical history 
if they had: cardiac diseases, renal disease, pre- 
existing diabetes, 
chronic hypertension, bleeding disorders, thyroid disorders, au-
toimmune diseases, neurological diseases, inflammatory bowel 
diseases, prior venous thrombosis and morbid obesity. A his-
tory of smoking, and two or more spontaneous early pregnancy 
losses (14–19 weeks gestation) were also considered significant 
 
medical history.15
Multiparous women were considered to have prior pregnancy 
complications if previous pregnancies resulted in: perinatal death, 
preterm birth, preterm preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, very 
small or large for gestational age infant (<third or >97th percen-
tile, respectively),17 post partum haemorrhage, placental abrup-
tion, placenta praevia, caesarean section and inter- 
pregnancy 
interval less than one year.18 All of these factors are reliably re-
ported in the NSW population data.19,20
Outcomes
The two outcomes of interest were maternal mortality/morbid-
ity and perinatal mortality/neonatal morbidity. Maternal mortal-
ity was defined as death prior to discharge home from the birth 
admission. Perinatal mortality was defined as the occurrence 
of stillbirth, or neonatal death (death within 28 days of birth) of 
any infants at least 400 g birth weight or at least 20 weeks gesta-
tion. Severe maternal and neonatal morbidity were determined 
using validated composite outcome indicators that include both

life- 
threatening conditions (eg respiratory failure, cerebrovascu-
lar haemorrhage, shock and cardiac arrest) and procedures as-
sociated with severe morbidity (eg mechanical ventilation, blood 
transfusion, acute dialysis and surgical procedures).21,22
Analysis
The distribution of maternal age in the cohort was described by 
parity. The frequency of medical conditions and prior pregnancy 
complications were tabulated by parity and maternal age. The fre-
quency of severe morbidity or mortality (maternal and perinatal) 
by medical and obstetric history were described by five- 
year age 
groups. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals we calculated 
with women aged 35–39 without medical conditions or prior preg-
nancy complications as the reference groups.
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to inves-
tigate the impact of maternal age on the outcomes, with and 
without adjustment for medical conditions and prior pregnancy 
complications. Models for each outcome were built separately 
for nulliparous and multiparous women. The Huber–White 
method was used to correct the covariance estimates for cor-
related births from the same mother. All terms were nominal 
with the exception of maternal age and inter- 
pregnancy interval 
which were continuous. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR)and 95% con-
fidence intervals (95% CI) are reported for each five- 
year increase 
in age. All analyses were conducted in R version 3.3.2 (R Core 
Team, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
There were 99 375 women ≥35 years who had 117 357 pregnan-
cies, including 37 764 (32.2%) to nulliparae and 79 593 (67.8%) 
to multiparae. Maternal age ranged from 35 to 56 years with a 
median age of 37 years; 98 184 (83.7%) women were 35–39 years 
old; 18 369 (15.7%) women were 40–44 years old; and 804 (0.01%) 
women were ≥45 years old at the time of birth. The distribution of 
maternal age was similar in nulliparous and multiparous pregnan-
cies but there was a higher number of advanced- 
age multiparae 
in the cohort overall (Fig. 1).
The prevalence of medical conditions was generally higher in 
women aged 40+ years compared to women aged 35–39 (Table 1). 
The prevalence of most conditions was higher in the multiparae 
compared to the nulliparae. For multiparae, prior pregnancy 
gestational diabetes and preterm birth increased with age. Few 
multiparous women had an inter- 
pregnancy interval of less than 
one year and an inter- 
pregnancy interval of at least five years was 
more common for women over 40 years of age.
Maternal mortality/morbidity occurred in 1.7% of women 
aged 35–39 years, 2.1% of women aged 40–44 years, and 2.0% of 
women aged 45 years or more. Perinatal mortality/morbidity was 
4.4% among women aged 35–40 years, 5.2% among women aged 
40–44, and 6.3% among women aged 45 years or more. Maternal 
and perinatal mortality/morbidity were lowest among multip-
arous women without medical conditions or poor prior preg-
nancy outcomes (Table 2). Nulliparae with no medical conditions 
had higher rates of both outcomes than multiparae with neither 
medical conditions nor prior pregnancy complications. Having a 
medical condition was associated with increased risk of severe 
morbidity or mortality in both nulliparae and multiparae, as were 
previous pregnancy complications among multiparae (Table S1). 
Multiparous women with both medical conditions and prior preg-
nancy complications were at greatest risk.
The independent effects of maternal age on adverse 
outcomes, with and without adjustment for medical condi-
tions and prior pregnancy complications (where applicable) 
are shown in Figure 2. In nulliparous women, each five- 
year 
increase in maternal age was associated with significantly 
increased perinatal mortality/morbidity (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 
1.05–1.25) but not with maternal mortality/morbidity (aOR 
1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.25). In contrast, among multiparae, even 
after adjustment for medical conditions and prior pregnancy 
complications, each five- 
year increase in maternal age was as-
sociated with a modest increased risk of both maternal (aOR 
1.23, 95%CI 1.09–1.39) and perinatal (aOR 1.15, 95%CI 1.06–
1.25) mortality/morbidity.
In practical terms, maternal age itself was associated with 
a relatively low increase in the risk of severe morbidity or mor-
tality. For example, a 35- 
year old nullipara with no medical 
conditions had an estimated 5.0% risk of perinatal mortality/
morbidity compared to 5.7% for a nullipara aged 40. By compar-
ison, a 35- 
year old nullipara with diabetes had a 12.4% risk of 
perinatal mortality or morbidity. Similarly, from 35 to 40 years 
of age the risk of maternal mortality/morbidity for a multipara 
with no medical conditions or prior pregnancy complications 
increased an estimated 0.8–1.0%. However, a 35- 
year old multi-
para with a bleeding disorder had a 2.2% risk of maternal mor-
tality or morbidity.

Advanced maternal age and morbidity/mortality
DISCUSSION
Pregnancy at advanced maternal age is becoming more com-
mon. We described population- 
based pregnancy outcomes for 
women aged over 35 at the time of birth. It is clear that such 
data are important for women in this age group, especially as 
assisted reproduction is allowing new prospects of motherhood: 
we found that approximately one in seven first- 
time mothers

birthed between 35–39 years of age and one in three pregnan-
cies over the age of 40 involved assisted reproduction. Our 
findings suggest that the contribution of maternal age beyond 
35 to pregnancy outcomes is relatively modest with a greater 
risk conferred by pre- 
existing medical morbidities and/or prior 
severe morbidity or mortality. These findings refine previously 
held views that maternal age is a significant risk factor for com-
plications in pregnancy.8,9,23
For nulliparous women the rates of significant maternal mor-
bidity were similar for those aged between 35–39 years compared 
with those over 40 years of age. The likelihood of perinatal severe 
morbidity or mortality was 6.1% compared with 6.8%. For multip-
arous women the rates of morbidity or mortality were lower for 
all age groups compared to nulliparous women. For both nullipa-
rous and multiparous women the presence of medical conditions 
conferred a greater risk of adverse outcomes than age itself. For 
nulliparous women the rate of adverse perinatal morbidity or 
mortality was around 10% if there were medical co- 
morbidities 
present. For multiparous women a lower rate was evident and it 
is noteworthy that medical conditions carried a greater risk than 
previous pregnancy complications; however, there did appear to 
be an additive effect if both are present. Taken together these 
data suggest that regardless of age the majority of pregnancies in 
women aged over 35 are free from significant maternal or perina-
tal mortality/morbidity. Multiparous women with no medical con-
ditions or prior pregnancy complications comprise the greatest 
number of the birthing population aged over 35 and these women 
have the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In contrast, the highest 
risk of severe morbidity or mortality is associated with co- 
existent 
medical problems, regardless of parity.
A key strength of our study is the population cohort which 
provides current data relevant to the Australian healthcare 
setting. We have taken into account factors other than mater-
nal age, in an older birthing population, to understand the de-
terminants of pregnancy outcomes. We included a wide range 
of conditions and complications such that women and their 
carers can better infer a personalised likelihood of pregnancy 
outcome than simply using an age- 
based approach. We pro-
pose that this is not only helpful but provides the majority of 
women with considerable reassurance that birthing between 
the ages of 35 and 45 does not confer considerably increased 
risks of maternal or perinatal morbidity. Notably, we did not 
make comparisons to birth outcomes for younger women, 
as age at pregnancy is not modifiable and therefore such 
 
information would be unhelpful to women who have passed 
those ages.
We acknowledge the limitations of our study. It is likely that 
we have under- 
ascertained medical conditions as we only looked 
back over five years to identify them from available hospital and/
or birth records. Some significant chronic medical conditions that 
have implications for pregnancy outcomes may not result in hos-
pitalisation and would therefore be missed if they were absent in 
these records. We were unable to assess the severity of medical 
conditions or the relative contribution of any particular condi-
tion to outcomes. Some medical conditions will confer a greater 
risk than others but our approach was to group them together. 
However, all of these factors would under- 
estimate the contribu-
tion of medical conditions so that the reported impact of age in 
the study is larger than in reality.
There may be women who chose not to have further pregnan-
cies on the basis of previous complications such that the impli-
cations of our findings may not be applicable to all multiparae. 
We have no data about the rates of early pregnancy problems, 
including aneuploidy, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy and the

Advanced maternal age and morbidity/mortality
risk of these may also influence a woman’s decision to attempt 
pregnancy at an advanced age. It is important to note that in our 
population we had a small number of women aged over 45, and 
therefore our conclusions about this small but increasing sub-
group may need to be interpreted with caution.
It is important to be able to provide women with accurate, 
non- 
emotive information about the likelihood of pregnancy out-
comes and the results of the current study form the basis for such 
information and counselling. Women perceive persistent, nega-
tive messages about age when counselling dwells on increased 
risks. These findings suggest that the absolute increase in the risk 
of severe morbidity or mortality associated with age is minimal; 
women can be reassured on that basis and can defer some of 
the rhetoric that undermines women’s confidence in their plan-
ning of, and during, their pregnancy. The findings will also help to 
inform the current societal debate around the risks of ‘delayed’ 
childbearing and public health and policy approaches to the issue.
