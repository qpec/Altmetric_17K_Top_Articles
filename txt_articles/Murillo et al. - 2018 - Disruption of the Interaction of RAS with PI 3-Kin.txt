In Brief
The interaction between RAS and PI 3-
kinase is essential for RAS-mutant-
induced carcinogenesis. Murillo et al.
show that in EGFR-mutant-driven lung
cancer, disruption of the interaction of PI
3-kinase with normal RAS proteins blocks
tumor initiation and promotes regression
of existing tumors, highlighting an
unexpected vulnerability of EGFR-driven
lung cancer.

SUMMARY
RAS family GTPases contribute directly to the regula-
tion of type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) via
RAS-binding domains in the PI3K catalytic p110 sub-
units. Disruption of this domain of p110a impairs
RAS-mutant-oncogene-driven tumor formation and
maintenance. Here, we test the effect of blocking
the interaction of RAS with p110a on epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant-driven lung
tumorigenesis. Disrupting the RAS-PI3K interaction
inhibits activation of both AKT and RAC1 in EGFR-
mutant lung cancer cells, leading to reduced growth
and survival, and inhibits EGFR-mutant-induced tu-
mor onset and promotes major regression of estab-
lished tumors in an autochthonous mouse model of
EGFR-mutant-induced lung adenocarcinoma. The
RAS-PI3K interaction is thus an important signaling
node and potential therapeutic target in EGFR-
mutant lung cancer, even though RAS oncogenes
are not themselves mutated in this setting, suggest-
ing different strategies for tackling tyrosine kinase in-
hibitor resistance in lung cancer.
INTRODUCTION
The most frequently mutated oncogenes in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) encode the small GTPase KRAS and the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Pao and Girard,
2011). The discovery of tumor-driving mutations in EGFR (Lynch
et al., 2004; Paez et al., 2004), most commonly in-frame dele-
tions in exon 19 (E746-A750) and a point mutation in exon 21
(L858R), led to the effective use of EGFR-targeted tyrosine ki-
nase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC patients harboring such muta-
tions. However, even though the initial response to these drugs
is impressive, secondary mechanisms of resistance eventually
lead to disease progression in the majority of patients within a
couple of years. Among these mechanisms, the most prevalent
is the secondary mutation in EGFR, T790M (Yu et al., 2013). A
new generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibits T790M-
mutant EGFR, including osimertinib, which has been approved
for clinical use (Ja
¨ nne et al., 2015; Sequist et al., 2015), but addi-
tional mechanisms of resistance have been found in patients
treated with these drugs, most notably a C797S mutation in
EGFR (Thress et al., 2015). Thus, despite enormous advances
in the therapeutic targeting of EGFR, further progress will be
needed to achieve effective control or eradication of EGFR-
mutant lung cancer.
EGFR controls the activation of several downstream signaling
pathways, including RAS small GTPases and the RAF-MEK-ERK
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways. RAS is
critical for the activation of the RAF pathway and also contributes
directly to activation of the PI3K pathway through direct binding
of RAS proteins to a RAS-binding domain (RBD) in the PI3K p110
catalytic subunit (Cox et al., 2014; Fritsch et al., 2013; Rodriguez-
Viciana et al., 1994). This interaction is needed for normal devel-
opment; when the RBD in Pik3ca, the gene encoding p110a, is
mutated in the mouse germline so that it cannot bind RAS, tran-
sient defects in normal lymphatic development occur as a result
of impaired VEGF-C signaling via VEGFR3. Fibroblasts derived
from these mice displayed attenuated epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-induced signaling to PI3K. Most strikingly, endogenous
RAS-mutant-driven tumorigenesis in the lung and the skin is
abrogated in these mice with RBD-mutant p110a (Gupta et al.,
2007). Moreover, disruption of the RAS-PI3K interaction in pre-
existing RAS-mutant-driven lung tumors causes partial regres-
sion and long-term stabilization (Castellano et al., 2013). This ef-
fect is not entirely tumor cell autonomous, as disruption of the
interaction of RAS with PI3K p110a only in host tissue also re-
duces tumor growth and metastasis to some extent by mecha-
nisms that include reduced tumor-induced angiogenesis and
alterations in the tumor microenvironment (Murillo et al., 2014).
Since EGFR acts upstream of both RAS and PI3K in lung
tumorigenesis, here we explore the effect of disrupting the
endogenous RAS-PI3K interaction in a mouse model of EGFR-
driven NSCLC, showing that this interaction is required for
both tumor onset and maintenance and providing proof of
concept that targeting this interaction has potential for treating
EGFR-mutant NSCLC, even though RAS genes are not mutated
in this setting. The molecular mechanisms underlying the defec-
tive signaling of EGFR in the presence of RBD-mutant PI3K
involve impaired activation of both AKT and the RHO family
GTPase RAC1. It is possible that direct targeting of RAS effector
interactions or RAS activation by guanine nucleotide exchange
factors may be effective in EGFR-mutant tumors, including those
that have become tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant.

 RESULTS
RBD-Mutant p110a Expression Inhibits EGF-Induced
AKT and RAC Activation
We have previously generated a mouse with an RBD-mutant
allele of Pik3ca, the gene encoding PI3K p110a (T208D plus
K227A, referred to here as Pik3caMUT) (Gupta et al., 2007). In
addition, we have also generated a conditional RAS-binding-
domain-mutant p110a mouse model, which has one RBD-mutant
allele of Pik3ca (Pik3caMUT) and one floxed, inducibly deletable
allele (Pik3caFlox), along with a tamoxifen-activatable ubiquitously
expressed Crerecombinase,ROSA26-CreERT2(Castellanoetal.,
2013; Murillo et al., 2014). We have previously reported
that Pik3caMUT/� and Pik3caMUT/MUT mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts (MEFs) show defective epidermal-growth-factor-induced
signaling (Gupta et al., 2007; Murillo et al., 2014). To investigate
the mechanism involved in this and also the possible effects of
p110a RBD mutation on oncogenic EGFR-induced tumor forma-
tion, we tested the effect of endogenous expression of RBD-
mutant p110a on EGFR signaling. Analysis of non-recombined
or recombined MEFs, with either a Pik3caWT or a Pik3caMUT allele,
showed that the total levels of EGFR and its tyrosine auto-
phosphorylation in response to EGF were similar (Figure 1A), as
were cell-surface EGFR expression levels (Figure S1A). Activation
of ERK by EGF was also constant, while induction of AKT activa-
tion was decreased, but not abolished, in Pik3caMUT/� MEFs.
Pik3caMUT/Flox MEFs activate AKT less than Pik3caWT/Flox MEFs
but more than Pik3caMUT/� MEFs. Activation of AKT downstream
of PI3K in response to EGF is thus attenuated, but not abolished,
when p110a is unable to bind to endogenous RAS proteins.
In order to extend our observations to the human cancer cell
setting, we investigated the effect of impairing p110a RBD
function in EGFR-mutant human NSCLC cell lines. We expressed
the
RBD-mutant
form
of
p110a
in
PC9
cells
(mutant
EGFRDE746-A750), H1975 cells (double-mutant EGFRL858R-T790M),
and H820 cells (double-mutant EGFRDel E746-E749-T790M, plus
MET amplification) (Figures 1B, 1E, and S1B–S1D). Even though
these cells express the activated EGFR mutant, downstream
signaling pathways remain responsive to EGF stimulation. The
expression of exogenous MUT-p110a resulted in decreased
fold stimulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway upon EGF treatment
without significant impairment of ERK pathway activation (Fig-
ures 1B, 1C, 1E, 1F, and S1D). Also, cells showed major growth
inhibition (Figures 1D, 1G, and S1C), with cells overexpressing
a wild-type (WT) form of p110a behaving as parental cells.
Thus, some degree of overexpression of a mutant form of
p110a that cannot bind to RAS is enough to suppress the activa-
tion of the PI3K-AKT pathway in several EGFR-oncogene-driven
lung cancer cell lines, including those with additional EGFR
T790M resistance mutations and also MET amplification,
providing evidence of dominant-negative activity of the RBD-
mutant p110a protein over the WT form of the protein.
Another important signaling pathway downstream of PI3K
p110a is the RAC family of RHO GTPases (Campa et al., 2015;
Castellano et al., 2016). We explored here whether the expres-
sion of RBD-mutant p110a might affect the activation of RAC1,
as measured by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) loading, upon
EGF stimulation in EGFR-mutant human lung cancer cell lines.
While parental H1975 cells activate RAC1 upon EGF stimulation,
those expressing RBD-mutant p110a do not, and those exoge-
nously expressing WT p110a show some increased basal
RAC1 activation even without EGF addition (Figures 2A and 2B).
Expression of RBD0-Mutant p110a or Dominant-
Negative RAC Inhibits the Growth of EGFR-Mutant Lung
Cancer Xenografts
To determine whether impairing the interaction of RAS with PI3K
p110a can affect the in vivo growth of human EGFR-mutant lung
cancer cells in a tumor cell-autonomous manner, we tested the
ability of the PC9 and H1975 cell lines described above to form
subcutaneous tumors in immunodeficient mice using luciferase
expression to monitor tumor growth using bioluminescence.
PC9 cells (Figure 2C) and H1975 cells (Figure 2D) expressing
MUT-p110a either did not grow or grew only after a long delay,
while parental cells and those expressing WT-p110a grew
steadily throughout. At the end of the experiment, tumors from
WT-p110a or parental PC9 cells were 10-fold larger than tumors
from PC9 MUT-p110a cells (Figure S2A), while in H1975 cells,
the differential was 10,000-fold (Figures S2B and S2C), demon-
strating that expressing an RBD-mutant form of p110a that
cannot bind to RAS abrogates the growth of EGFR-driven human
NSCLC cell lines in vivo in a tumor cell-autonomous manner.
We further extended this analysis to investigate the role played
by RAC proteins by infecting H1975 and PC9 cells with a WT or
dominant-negative version of RAC1 (RAC1-N17) and monitoring
their growth in vivo in immunodeficient mice. PC9 cells (Fig-
ure 2E) and H1975 cells (Figure 2F) expressing RAC1-N17 either
did not grow or grew only after a long delay, while parental cells
and those expressing RAC1-WT grew steadily throughout. At the
end of the experiment, tumors from RAC1-WT or parental PC9
cells were more than 10-fold larger than tumors from PC9
RAC1-N17 cells (Figure S2D), while in H1975 cells, the differen-
tial was over 100-fold (Figures S2E and S2F). RAC1 activation is
thus needed for in vivo tumor growth of human EGFR-mutant
NSCLC cell lines.

EGFR-mutant driven lung cancer, we used the conditional

were then starved and stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) or vehicle for 10 min. Proteins were collected and subjected to western blot analysis as indicated. One
representative experiment from three is shown.

 RAS-binding-domain-mutant p110a mouse model previously
described, which has one RBD-mutant allele of Pik3ca (T208D
plus K227A, referred to here as Pik3caMUT) and one floxed,
inducibly deletable allele (Pik3caFlox), along with a tamoxifen-acti-
vatable ubiquitously expressed Cre recombinase, ROSA26-
CreERT2 (Castellano et al., 2013; Murillo et al., 2014). We crossed
this strain with mice that inducibly express an EGFRL858R-mutant
transgene in the lung (Politi et al., 2006) (Figure S3A). These com-
pound mice express a reverse tetracycline-controlled transactiva-
tor (rtTA) transgene under the control of the Clara cell secretory
protein (CCSP) promoter. Upon tetracycline or doxycycline expo-
sure, the transactivator binds to the tetracycline-responsive pro-
moter of an activated human EGF-receptor-mutant transgene,
EGFRL858R, inducing its expression and driving lung adenocarci-
noma formation. Upon tamoxifen exposure, Cre recombinase be-
comes active and excises the floxed p110a allele throughout the
mouse,leaving onlytheRBD-mutantallele.Cre-mediateddeletion
of the floxed p110a allele is essentially complete in various tissues
2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment of mice. Previous work also
showed that recombination persisted at this level for at least
8 weeks (Castellano et al., 2013; Murillo et al., 2014), suggesting
that there was no appreciable outgrowth of unrecombined cell
populations.

We analyzed whether we could tightly
control the expression of the EGFR onco-
gene to induce lung tumor formation using
micro-computerized
X-ray
tomography
(micro-CT) in vivo and immunohistopathol-
ogy
with
an
antibody
against
the
EGFRL858R mutant that does not recognize
the endogenous, WT EGFR (Figure S3B).
Mice containing both the CCSP-rtTA and EGFRL858R genes,
but not either singly, express the EGFR mutant only when fed
doxycycline-containing food and subsequently develop lung hy-
perplasia (as seen in the micro-CT images) and discrete tumor
nodules (as shown in the histology images).
Given the multifocal hyperplasia characteristic of this EGFR-
induced lung tumor model, the use of micro-CT did not readily
allow us to monitor the growth of discrete nodules over time (Fig-
ure S3B). Therefore, we used micro-CT to compare the amount
of air remaining in the lungs after inducing the expression of the
oncogene with final tumor burden as measured by histological
analysis. A robust inverse correlation between tumor burden
and air in the lungs suggests that the latter can be used as a
convenient surrogate to follow tumor burden in vivo (Figure S3C).
EGFR-Mutant Lung Tumors Lacking the RAS-PI3K
Interaction Show Strongly Delayed Development
We first analyzed whether early disruption of the RAS-PI3K inter-
action would affect EGFRL858R-driven tumor initiation and forma-
tion. Ten-week-old mice were fed tamoxifen-containing pellets
for 2 weeks to induce the deletion of the floxed Pik3ca allele.
The mice were then fed doxycycline-containing pellets for
18 weeks to induce sustained EGFRL858R oncogene expression,

 and the amount of air remaining in the lungs was monitored as the
tumors grew (Figure 3A). We observed that the air content
decreased considerably faster in the lungs of Pik3caWT/� mice
than in those of Pik3caMUT/� mice. After 18 weeks, Pik3caWT/�
mice had only �40% of the initial air content, while Pik3caMUT/�
mice retained �75%. Lungs from Pik3caWT/� mice were highly hy-
perplastic and contained a large number of tumor nodules, while
lungs from Pik3caMUT/� mice looked normal in size and had a
smooth surface, with little or no signs of tumor growth (Figure 3B,
central panels). Micro-CT analysis revealed that while Pik3caWT/�
mouse lungs showed a high tumor burden and hyperplasia, the
Pik3caMUT/� lungswerelargelynormal(Figure3B,leftpanels).His-
tological analysis showed a diffuse hyperplasia with several
discrete nodules in Pik3caWT/� mice, while Pik3caMUT/� samples
showed a normal parenchymawithvery small areas ofhyperplasia
and were almost devoid of tumor nodules (Figure 3B, right panels).
The number of tumor foci per lung was much larger in Pik3caWT/�
samples than in Pik3caMUT/� samples, as was the tumor area
(Figures 3C and 3D). Given these differences, we then analyzed
proliferation in Pik3caWT/� nodules compared with Pik3caMUT/�.
Ki-67 staining of different samples clearly showed that there
was much greater proliferation in Pik3caWT/� samples than in
Pik3caMUT/� samples (Figures 3E and 3F).
We finally performed a survival experiment comparing these
two groups of animals, plus mice that contained two WT copies
of p110a (Pik3caWT/Flox not treated with tamoxifen) (Figure 3G).
The results showed that survival of Pik3caWT/Flox mice was
shorter than that of Pik3caWT/� mice, and survival of the latter
group was shorter than that of Pik3caMUT/� mice, several of
which survived beyond the end of the experiment (48 weeks
old, with 36 weeks of doxycycline treatment). These results sug-
gest the existence of a gene-dosage effect, as Pik3caWT/Flox
mice, with two functional Pik3ca alleles, have shorter survival
than Pik3caWT/� mice, with one functional Pik3ca allele.
We analyzed the degree of recombination in the few tumors
that do form in the Pik3caMUT/� mice, finding that in all cases,
these samples contained non-recombined cells, thus indicating
that these tumors have escaped the activity of Cre recombinase
and continue to express an unrecombined Pik3ca gene (Fig-
ure S3D). Altogether, these results show that prior mutation of
the RBD of p110a massively diminishes the onset and develop-
ment of lung tumors in mice driven by the oncogene EGFRL858R.
Removal of the RAS-PI3K Interaction Causes Major
Regression of Established EGFR-Mutant Lung Tumors
We next analyzed the effect of disrupting the RAS-PI3K interac-
tion on the continued maintenance of preexisting tumors. For
this, Pik3caWT/Flox and Pik3caMUT/Flox mice expressing lung-spe-
cific doxycycline-inducible EGFRL858R and ubiquitous tamox-
ifen-inducible Cre recombinase were first fed doxycycline-con-
taining pellets for 11 weeks to induce EGFRL858R oncogene
expression and drive tumor formation. A cohort of mice was
sacrificed at this point to analyze whether unrecombined
Pik3caWT/Flox and Pik3caMUT/Flox mice have a similar level of
tumor burden. Lungs from both genotypes showed multiple
nodules on the surface and a marked hyperplasia (Figure S4A),
with similar numbers of tumors and similar overall tumor area
(Figures S4B and S4C), although there is a tendency toward
slightly lower tumor burden in the Pik3caMUT/Flox mice, perhaps
reflecting the gene-dosage effect observed above. We found
no significant differences in the histological grade between
Pik3caWT/Flox and Pik3caMUT/Flox samples (Figure S4D).
After 11 weeks of doxycycline treatment, we fed the mice
tamoxifen-containing pellets for 2 weeks to induce the recombi-
nation of the floxed Pik3ca allele, during which time doxycycline
was administered by oral gavage. A cohort of mice was sacri-
ficed at different time points to ensure that the EGFRL858R was
still expressed and for subsequent histological analysis (Fig-
ure S4E). Mice resumed a diet of doxycycline-containing pellets
afterward.
Micro-CT analysis after induction of deletion of the floxed
Pik3ca allele revealed a striking increase in the amount of air in
the lungs of Pik3caMUT/� mice (Figure 4A), with neither nodules
nor hyperplasia detectable by micro-CT scanning or histology
(Figure 4B). By contrast, Pik3caWT/� mice showed a much
smaller increase in lung air content and had continued lung hy-
perplasia and nodules. Histological analysis 7 weeks after
tamoxifen treatment revealed that Pik3caWT/� lungs samples still
had high levels of hyperplasia and discrete nodules, while Pik3-
caMUT/� lung samples where virtually devoid of them (Figure 4C).
There is a dramatic difference between the level of tumors
in Pik3caWT/� mice compared to Pik3caMUT/� (Figure 4C),
while there is little difference between Pik3caWT/Flox and
Pik3caMUT/Flox lungs (Figures S4B and S4C), suggesting that a
threshold exists in terms of the amount of Pik3ca function
needed to support tumor maintenance.
To analyze whether tumor cells in Pik3caMUT/� mice were
dying upon floxed Pik3ca deletion, we isolated lung samples af-
ter 5 days of tamoxifen treatment and subjected them to TUNEL
and Ki-67 staining (Figures 4D– 4G). Tumors in Pik3caMUT/�
samples showed a very high rate of TUNEL-positive cells, while
lower rates were seen in Pik3caWT/� samples. Conversely, we
detected a much higher frequency of Ki-67+ cells in Pik3caWT/�
samples compared to Pik3caMUT/� samples. When TUNEL
data were broken down by tumor grade, there were no differ-
ences in Pik3caWT/� nodules according to the tumor grade, but
there was a clear increase in TUNEL-positive cells in grade 3
Pik3caMUT/� nodules compared to grade 2 Pik3caMUT/� nodules
(Figure S4F), suggesting an increasing dependency on the
Pik3ca WT allele in more malignant tumors. The tumors in this

 model do not reach the most invasive state (grade 4), which may
require additional deletion of p53; we cannot rule out the possi-
bility that grade 4 tumors might respond differently to Pik3ca
RBD mutation.
These results show that disruption of the RAS-PI3K interaction
promotes a very major regression of existing EGFRL858R-driven
lung tumors in mice through both a strong induction of tumor
cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. This is
achieved without obvious toxicity to the mouse, even though
the Cre-driven recombination event removing the Pik3ca flox
allele occurs throughout the animal.
DISCUSSION
The p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K is required for signal propa-
gation from RTKs such as EGFR to AKT activation and cellular
transformation by oncogenic EGFR mutants (Zhao et al., 2006).
In addition, the ability of WT endogenous RAS proteins to
interact with p110a via the RBD has been shown to be important
for normal EGF signaling to PI3K (Gupta et al., 2007). However,
the significance of the interaction of endogenous WT RAS pro-
teins with p110a has not previously been addressed in the
context of oncogenic EGFR signaling and in EGFR-mutant-
driven cancer models. The development here of a mouse model
to determine the effect of disrupting the binding of PI3K p110a to
endogenous WT RAS proteins in EGFR-driven lung adenocarci-
noma shows that this interaction is critical in tumors that are
driven by upstream activators of the RAS pathways and not
just those in which RAS is mutationally activated. Mechanisti-
cally, EGF-induced activation of both AKT and RAC via PI3K
was
attenuated
in
cells
expressing
RBD-mutant
p110a
compared to those expressing WT p110a. Blocking RAS’s inter-
action with PI3K p110a and also activation of RAC1 abrogates
the growth of human EGFR-mutant NSCLC in xenografts. This
suggests that both RAC and AKT signaling pathways are likely
to be important in EGFR-mutant-induced tumorigenesis and
that disruption of the RAS-PI3K interaction compromises both
events.
The clinical effectiveness of PI3K inhibitors in the treatment of
solid tumors remains unclear, and there may be limitations to the
ability of these drugs to inhibit oncogenic PI3K signaling in tu-
mors without excessive toxicity to normal tissue. Our experi-
ments here suggest that the RBD of p110a could be a good
target for therapy, as blocking its function appears to have
limited toxicity in the adult animal while being effective in causing
tumor regression. This approach could be effective not only in
RAS-mutant-driven cancers but also those driven by mutations
in EGFR, and, by extension, possibly in tumors driven by other
upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, such as MET and ALK. As
the scale of the problem of drug resistance to EGFR tyrosine ki-
nase inhibitors becomes apparent, despite their initial effective-
ness, it is likely that other additional approaches will be needed
to block signaling though this pathway in order to reduce the like-
lihood of the evolution of drug resistance (Ramalingam et al.,
2018).
There has been much interest recently in the possibility of
targeting RAS directly using a number of strategies. Fragment-
based screening for RAS inhibitors has identified several com-
pounds that block the interaction of RAS with guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (Cox et al., 2014). While there are concerns
that inhibitors of RAS activation by exchange factors may be
ineffective in tumors with many common activating RAS muta-
tions, the data presented here suggest that such inhibitors could
possibly be effective in EGFR-mutant tumors, including those
that have become tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant. This pro-
vides a rationale for the further development of existing inhibitors
of RAS activation by exchange factors (Burns et al., 2014; Evelyn
et al., 2014; Maurer et al., 2012; Patgiri et al., 2011), although the
potential toxicity of such an approach remains unclear. In addi-
tion, our observations provide support for the more speculative
development of inhibitors of the interaction of RAS with PI3K
p110a as an approach to treating tumors driven by mutationally
activated receptor tyrosine kinases.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mouse strains and in vivo recombination
The Pik3caMUT/Flox / ROSA26-Cre-ER mouse strain was generated in our laboratory as previously described (Murillo et al., 2014).
Targeted allele nomenclature (www.informatics.jax.org) for the RBD mutant Pik3ca mouse was Pik3catm1Jdo, for the floxed Pik3ca
mouse was Pik3catm1Jjz and for the ROSA26-CRE-ER mouse was Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(cre/ERT2)Tyj, with mice being available from
the Jackson Laboratory. The tetracycline inducible EGFR-L858R mouse strain was from the Mouse Repository of the National
Cancer Institute (allele name Tg(tetO-EGFR*L858R)56Hev). The lung specific reverse tetracycline transactivator CCSP-rtTA mouse
(allele name Tg(Scgb1a1-rtTA)2Jaw) was from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were backcrossed to a C57BL/6J background. The
breeding program followed to obtain the final mouse model is depicted in Figure S3A. Experiments were conducted on age matched

 female mice. In vivo recombination of the floxed Pik3ca allele was achieved by feeding mice for 14 days with tamoxifen-containing
food pellets (400 ppm; Harlan Teklad) ad libitum.
Initial genotyping of all new litters was performed by Transnetyx (Memphis, USA). Assessment of LoxP-p110a recombination
was performed by standard PCR using the following primers: forward 50-CTGTGTAGCCTAGTTTAGAGCAACCATCTA-30; reverse
50-CCTCTCTGAAGAGTTCATGTTTGATGGTGA-30.
All animal experimentation was subject to ethical review by the Francis Crick Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and regu-
lation by the UK Home Office project licence 70/8095.
Cell culture and stable cell lines
All human cells lines were purchased from ATCC and grown according to ATCC instructions. To generate stable cell lines expressing
Luciferase, WT-PIK3CA, MUT-PIK3CA, WT-RAC1 and N17-RAC1, retrovirus containing the indicated genes were generated in
Phoenix cells using Lipofectamine 2000 following manufacture instructions. Retrovirus were used to infect cell lines followed by a
selection period using a standard protocol.
METHOD DETAILS
Micro-CT
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane oxygen gas, and images of the lung region were acquired on a SkyScan 1176 micro-CT
analyzer. Data were sorted using Tsort (SkyScan) and reconstructed using the NRecon program (SkyScan). Reconstructed data were
subsequently imaged using DataViewer and CTAn programs. The volume of air in the lungs was quantified using CTAn as per man-
ufacturer’s instructions (SkyScan).
Tumor burden and bioluminescence
Tumor burden was measured in H&E-stained tissue sections or by bioluminescence. Quantification on H&E samples was performed
using NIKON NIS-Elements software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For bioluminescence, PC9 and H1975 cells were
infected with retroviruses containing a pBabe-Luciferase. This vector was engineered by cloning a Luciferase gene containing a
poly-A tail in the Bamh1-Sal1 restriction sites of a pBabe-Blastocidine empty vector. Bioluminescence was measured using
an IVIS Spectrum Pre-Clinical In Vivo Imaging System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lines were screened
periodically to ensure that the levels of luciferase were stable.
Histopathological analysis
Tissue samples were fixed overnight in 10% formalin and subsequently stored in 70% ethanol. Samples were then embedded
in paraffin and sectioned. Sections were stained for Haematoxylin and Eosin, Ki-67 and TUNEL (Promega G7131) following
standard methods or manufacturer instructions. For EGFR-L858R staining (Cell Signaling antibody 3197) sections were microwaved
for 15 minutes in 1 mM EDTA pH = 8, followed by an overnight incubation with the antibody at a 1:100 dilution. Scale bars shown are
100mm.
Engineering of cDNA constructs
cDNAs for Luciferase, Rac1 and Rac1-N17 were subcloned into a retroviral pBabe vector (Addgene 1764). cDNAs for pic3ca-WT and
pic3ca Mutant were subcloned into a retroviral pLXSN vector (Clontech 631509).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All data groups were subjected to a normality test (Shapiro-Wilks). When all data groups within an experiment were normally distrib-
uted, a two-tailed unpaired Student’s test was performed to determine differences, and data was represented as means ± SEM.
When any group within an experiment was not normally distributed, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used, and the me-
dian was displayed (Figures 3C, 3D, 4C, S2, S4B, and S4C). Figure 3G statistics were generated using a Kaplan-Meir estimator.
