Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they 
are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal “active principle” and 
“other ingredients,” with the latter collectively also known as “adjuvants.” These include 
surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the 
absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. 
Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the 
United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, 
adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects 
having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity 
of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects 
being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they 
are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. 
Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used 
pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, 
which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse 
disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example 
glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active 
principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and 
within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of com-
mercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants 
in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, 
and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied 
by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human 
population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments.

iNTRODUCTiON
Human tissues are impregnated with chemicals used in commercial formulations of pesticides (1), 
which are collectively referred to as “pesticide residues.” This is the conclusion reached by govern-
mental biomonitoring programs, raising questions about long-term health effects of a daily exposure 
to pesticide residue mixtures. These residues generally arise from the ingestion of contaminated 
 FigURe 1 | Pesticides are never used alone but in combination with 
adjuvants. Agricultural preparations of pesticides include adjuvants mixed 
with an active principle to increase toxic effects. For glyphosate-based 
herbicides, the active principle primarily targets the EPSPS enzyme but 
needs adjuvants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine to penetrate into plant 
tissues and cells. These adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right; 
numerous toxic effects have been reported in humans and the environment. 
However, adjuvants are regulated differently than active principles, and their 
long-term toxic effects are generally ignored and thus missing from pesticide 
risk assessment procedures.

agricultural crops sprayed with herbicides, insecticides, or fungi-
cides. However, pesticide formulations are not only used in agri-
culture but also in other sectors (public or private parks, gardens, 
along roads and railway tracks, etc.), providing additional routes 
of exposure. Some recent studies indicate that the domestic use of 
insecticides (e.g., repellents, acaricides), fungicides (as furniture 
treatments), or herbicides (for domestic gardening) could be a 
major source of human exposure (2).
Recent toxicological studies indicate that some pesticides 
cause cancer and affect the central nervous system, or even inter-
fere with (neuro)endocrine functions, resulting in metabolic and 
reproductive defects (3). However, regulatory studies have been 
often unsuccessful at predicting the toxic effects of these pesti-
cides based on the multiple tests conducted before commercial 
approval (4). A number of pesticides were thus banned after dec-
ades of use because certain unexpected health effects occurred in 
human populations after major contamination accidents or after 
decades of exposure as highlighted by epidemiological studies.
The different ingredients present in a given pesticide formula-
tion can be regulated differently, and some are even unregulated 
because they are considered to be “inert” additives, in the sense 
that are devoid of pesticide activity. However, studies have 
revealed that these supposedly “inert” diluents can be more toxic 
than the regulated active pesticide principles (5). We describe 
here how unregulated chemicals present in commercial formula-
tions of pesticides could provide a missing link between observed 
negative health outcomes and pesticide exposure.
COMPONeNTS OF COMMeRCiAL 
PeSTiCiDe FORMULATiONS
Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single 
ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of 
an active principle and “other ingredients.” Sometimes also called 
“inerts,” “co-formulants,” or “adjuvants,” these other ingredients 
are specifically added to influence the absorption and stability 
of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action 
(Figure 1) (6). These compounds are generally included as co-
formulants in commercial formulations of pesticides with an 
active ingredient, but they are also sold and used separately as 
adjuvants and added during the preparation of the agriculturally 
applied pesticide mixture. Their use is expected to increase. The 
market for agricultural adjuvants, valued at USD 2.51 billion in 
2015, is projected to increase by 5.8% to reach USD 3.18 billion 
by 2019 (7).
The major adjuvants are surfactants. The most common 
are non-ionic surfactants such as ethoxylated alkylphenols. 
Surfactants are added to pesticides to form micelles, which 
increase the solubility of the active ingredient and protect it from 
degradation. This increases the half-life of the active ingredient 
and improves its pesticidal activity (8). For instance, penetration 
of the active ingredient diclofop-methyl into maize leaves was 
increased by seed oil additives (9). Experiments were conducted 
to estimate the effect of an addition of adjuvants (oil, surfactant, 
and multicomponents) on the behavior of the herbicide active 
ingredient metazachlor in soil. The adjuvants increased the 
half-life of metazachlor and slowed down its leaching and deg-
radation in soil (10). Adjuvants used in pesticide formulations 
also include spreaders, stickers, (anti)foaming agents, dyes, and 
drift retardants that modify the physicochemical properties of 
the spray mixture (Table 1) (11). For example, diesel fuel and 
kerosene are used as antifoam agents to reduce foam formation in 
the tank during spray mixture preparation (12). Drift retardants 
such as polyvinyl and polyisobutylene polymers increase spray 
droplet size and thus reduce the number of small droplets that 
are susceptible to be carried and spread by the wind (9). Solvents 
can also be used to increase pesticide mobility. Heptanol, octanol, 
and nonanol were able to increase the mobility of 2,4-D in cell 
membranes of bitter orange leaves by 25- to 30-fold (9). The com-
position of adjuvants depends on the physicochemical properties 
of the active principle, as well as on the types of formulation 
(emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, solution, granules, 
etc.).
One should also note that adjuvants do not only increase the 
penetration of the active pesticide ingredient into plants but also 
of the skin of those exposed, as shown in the comparison of the 
dermal penetration of atrazine, alachlor, and trifluralin to their 
commercial formulations Aatrex, Lasso, and Treflan (17).
ADJUvANTS CAN Be MORe TOXiC THAN 
ACTive PRiNCiPLeS
It is recognized that adjuvants alone can have phytotoxic activi-
ties (9). However, adjuvants are generally stated to be inert for 
non-target species. Historically, the classification of a compound 
as either active or inert in pesticides was first introduced by the

Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act in 1947 in 
the United States (18). A pesticide compound is considered to 
be active when intentionally added to be toxic to target species. 
All others are defined as inert ingredients, although this does 
not exclude their own toxicity, including on non-target species. 
However, the term “inert” was still understood as meaning bio-
logically inactive 50 years later and, therefore safe, as shown by a 
consumer survey conducted by the US Environment Protection 
Agency (19). This is why the US EPA started to use the term 
“other ingredients” to describe adjuvant mixtures.
In this review, we have focused on the co-formulants included 
in the commercial formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides 
(5), in particular the polyethoxylated tallow amines (POEAs), 
which we consider as a representative good model system because 
they are the most used pesticides worldwide (20) (Figure 1). We 
also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are 
strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony 
collapse disorder.
example 1: glyphosate-Based Herbicides
A total of 750 different formulations of glyphosate-based herbi-
cides are marketed worldwide (21). Indeed, each name of a given 
formulation represents a different mixture of active principle 
and co-formulants (Table 1). As a result of the variability in 
co-formulants, and since most of them are not compulsorily 
declared, the effects of pesticides are complex and combinatorial. 
The literature is quite heterogeneous because these co-formulants 
vary between commercial pesticide formulations and thus have 
different and/or additive side effects between themselves and with 
glyphosate. In fact, this causes confusion in the scientific com-
munity, with authors not always declaring the formulation that 
they tested (22). Authors even sometimes confuse commercial 
formulations with the active ingredient; they state that “glypho-
sate” was used when in reality they employed a formulation in 
their studies. The problem of reproducibility and consistency in 
the results of toxicological studies (23) could be partly due to the 
fact that comparisons are performed between different formula-
tions. Some studies even compare formulations and glyphosate 
alone treating the two as equivalent and therefore ignoring the 
effects of adjuvants in the former (22). This adds yet further 
confusion and questions over the reliability of the data obtained. 
For example, a recent study investigating effects of a Roundup 
formulation on damselfly larvae concluded that “the toxicity of 
Roundup cannot be fully attributed to the surfactant POEA” and 
that “Roundup® […] contains POEA as surfactant” (24). This is 
not accurate as not all Roundup formulations contains a POEA 
surfactant and that the manufacturer company Monsanto has 
moved away from the use of POEA-based surfactants in their lat-
est generation of Roundup formulations (5). The authors of this 
study do not indicate which commercial formulation of Roundup 
they have tested on damselfly larvae, and thus it is unknown if 
POEA was present. Therefore, although they present interesting 
results on the toxicity of Roundup on an environmental toxicity 
indicator organism, at the same time they bring confusion to the 
field by concluding that their study “confirms the toxicity of the 
surfactant POEA.”
Séralini and colleagues have conducted the most extensive 
study on the composition and toxicity of the different ingredients 
that constitute glyphosate-based herbicides. They have compared 
the toxicity of different brands of glyphosate-based herbicides 
in tissue culture cell assays and showed that several commercial 
formulations were up to 1,000 times more toxic than glyphosate 
alone, the regulated active ingredient (5). In addition, adjuvant 
mixtures generally contain several ingredients, and these can 
sometimes be mixtures themselves. For example, POEAs are mix-
tures of diethoxylates of tallow amines with different toxicological 
properties (25), which are characterized by their oxide/tallow 
amine ratio. The toxicity of POEA increases as the tallow amine 
chain is shortened. The most commonly used POEA is POE (15) 
tallow amine (POE-15), which was used in the first formulations 
of glyphosate commercialized under the trade name “Roundup.” 
By using cell culture model systems, Séralini and colleagues 
demonstrated that the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations 
was proportional to their concentration of POE-15 or other eth-
oxylated surfactants (5). The formulations that did not contain 
ethoxylated surfactants were approximately 100 times less toxic 
to human cells. It was quite a surprising finding to see that the 
toxicity of two formulations of the same active ingredient could 
differ by a factor of 100. Thus, the consumer could buy one or 
another glyphosate-based herbicide formulation without being 
aware of this difference in toxicity.

The study by Séralini and colleagues based on tissue culture 
cell lines clearly has its limitations, including exacerbating the 
observed differential toxicity profiles of the formulations tested. 
However, the findings of greater toxicity of commercial formula-
tions over glyphosate alone in vitro have been replicated in vivo in 
laboratory animals (26), other animal model systems such as sea 
urchins (27), microorganisms (bacteria, microalgae, protozoa), 
and crustaceans (28). A more recent study on two life stages of 
the Pacific oyster shows that POEA-based adjuvants can be very 
toxic to embryonal and larval development (EC50, 262 µg/L) 
(29). Metamorphosis tests revealed that although EC50 values 
exceeded 100,000 µg/L for glyphosate and its metabolite ami-
nomethylphosphonic acid, they were as low as ~6,000 μg/L for 
some commercial formulations (30). Studies have also revealed 
that some ethoxylated adjuvants can be endocrine disruptors at 
lower non-toxic concentrations. Recently, it has been reported 
that POEA-based adjuvants promote triglyceride accumulation 
in 3T3-L1 adipocytes at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 µM (31). 
This is in contrast to glyphosate alone, which did not promote 
lipid accumulation in this same adipocyte cell line (Mesnage and 
Antoniou, unpublished results). Another study has shown that 
ethoxylated adjuvants can inhibit aromatase activity disrupting 
estrogen–androgen balance (32).
A comparison of the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide 
and glyphosate at an equivalent concentration of 25 mg/kg/d 
on the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiome in 
Sprague-Dawley rats found that the commercial formulation but 
not glyphosate alone affected the numbers of observed species in 
both the cecum and the colon (33). Although glyphosate has been 
patented as an antiparasitic agent and suggested to be a bacterial 
antibiotic (US patent number: US7771736 B2), it is likely that 
the effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on the gut microbiome 
could be due to the damaging properties of surfactants present in 
the adjuvant mixture on the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. 
In support of this possibility is the observation that emulsifiers 
have been shown to alter gut microbiome composition in mice 
by sweeping the lining of the gut, which consequently gave rise 
to colitis and metabolic syndrome (34).
More recently, we have shown that the chronic (2 years) admin-
istration of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup) induced liver 
toxic effects in rats at an environmental concentration and daily 
intake of active ingredient was declared safe by regulatory agen-
cies worldwide (35, 36). However, further research is required to 
elucidate whether the glyphosate, the adjuvants, or the combina-
tion of the two is at the basis of the observed kidney and especially 
liver toxicity seen in these animals. It is difficult to attribute the 
toxicity of a commercial formulation to a given ingredient if they 
are not tested in parallel in an experiment. Glyphosate-based 
herbicides can not only contain POEA but also contain multiple 
adjuvants having intrinsic toxicological properties. These for-
mulations can also include methylchloroisothiazolinone having 
allergenic properties, light aromatic petroleum distillates having 
liver toxic effects, or sodium o-phenylphenate considered as pos-
sibly carcinogenic to humans (22).
This and other work has led the European Commission to rec-
ommend a ban on the use of POEA-type adjuvants in glyphosate-
based herbicide products. Although this can be seen as a positive 
step forward for public health, this does not exclude the use of 
POEA in other non-glyphosate-based products. For example, 
in France, 126 formulations of glyphosate were removed from 
the market in July 2016, but other POEA-containing pesticides 
can still be bought. In addition, French farmers can still source 
POEA as a separate adjuvant mixture (product name Regain, 
authorization 9300433) to mix with a glyphosate formulation in 
the spray tank (https://ephy.anses.fr/adjuvant/regain). POEA is 
also still authorized as a co-formulant in pesticide formulations 
containing other ingredients such as 2,4-D. Thus, farmers and 
the general public can still readily be exposed to POEA despite it 
being banned in glyphosate-based herbicides.
Furthermore, the finding that POEA is widely found in fields 
in the United States where glyphosate-based herbicides are 
applied (37) raises concerns that this and other classes of pesticide 
adjuvants may be entering the food and feed chain undetected, 
with as yet unknown health consequences.
example 2: Neonicotinoid insecticide 
Formulations
Neonicotinoids are synthetic insecticides targeting nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system of insects. 
Their intensive use in agriculture has been associated with a wide 
range of toxic effects on non-target organisms leading to, for 
example, colony collapse disorders in social insects such as hon-
eybees and bumblebees (38, 39). Another well-documented case 
of adjuvant toxicity of note is the organosilicon surfactants used 
in some neonicotinoid insecticide formulations. Organosilicon 
surfactants are a class of silicon-based polymers used to modify 
the surface tension of plant cells and insect cuticles to increase the 
penetration of pesticide active ingredients and can constitute up 
to 2% of the spray tank mix.
A series of publications by Mullin and colleagues have 
revealed their profound effects on honeybees (40). This ranged 
from acute toxic effects to olfactory learning impairments (41). 
These authors analyzed the contamination of honey, pollen, or 
beeswax by trisiloxane surfactants and found it was present in 
every beeswax (up to 390 ng/g) and 60% of the pollen (39 ng/g) 
samples (42). They also studied pesticide applications in almond 
orchards in California and showed that the use of organosilicon 
surfactants increases during the flowering season (43). This is the 
period when two-thirds of US honey bee colonies are present. 
This suggests that the neglect of pesticide tank mixture-derived 
toxicities could account for the knowledge gap in the cause of bee 
colony collapse syndrome. Although some studies suggest that 
organosilicon surfactants are among the least toxic surfactants to 
bacteria compared to ethoxylated surfactants such as POEA (13), 
the situation is very different for honey bees as a concentration of 
100 pM of an organosilicon surfactant induced 60–100% mortal-
ity when the POEA had no effect at this concentration (40). The 
effects of co-formulants can also be more indirect as a study has 
even shown that adjuvants can potentiate viral pathogenicity in 
honey bee larvae (44).
Another more recent study showed that a co-formulant used 
in insect growth regulators (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) can have 
adverse effects on honey bee reproduction and development

(45). The authors of this study also revealed that the adjuvant co-
formulants can also have an unexpected persistence. A growth 
chamber experiment showed that N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone can 
persist in pollen for up to 7 days at concentrations reaching 
69.3 ppm. As N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone is widely used and can also 
be present in neonicotinoid formulations (such as Confidor), it 
has the potential to negatively affect the well-being of wild bee 
populations via the use of this class of pesticides. In addition, the 
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone is a developmental toxicant and caused 
malformations such as incomplete ossification of the skull in 
rats, suggesting toxicity to other non-target organisms including 
mammals (46).
The differential effects between neonicotinoid-based formula-
tions and their active principles have been confirmed on other 
invertebrates. The toxicity of Apache 50 WG® formulation was 
found to be 46.5 times more toxic than could be explained by 
its active ingredient clothianidin alone on Daphnia magna (47). 
Contrastingly, preparations of Calypso 480SC® (containing thia-
cloprid) and Actara 240 SC® (thiamethoxam) were two to three 
times less toxic than their respective active insecticide principles.
RegULATORY gUiDANCe vALUeS FOR 
PeSTiCiDeS CAN Be MiSCALCULATeD 
BY igNORiNg ADJUvANT TOXiCiTY
The identity of these “inert” additional adjuvant ingredients in 
pesticide formulations is frequently undisclosed as they are con-
sidered to be confidential commercial information. The US EPA 
has a list of compounds authorized in pesticide formulations, but 
it does not require the registration or labeling of spray adjuvants. 
As they are proffered as “inert,” they are ignored by regulatory 
agencies in the determination of acceptable daily intake (ADI) 
levels, a threshold value of exposure in terms of a unit of weight, 
usually milligrams, per kilogram body weight per day of ingestion 
to a “pesticide.” A dose at or below the ADI is deemed unlikely to 
result in any negative health effects.
In the field of public health, a large paradigm shift took place 
in the middle of the twentieth century in the form of a growing 
awareness of the health risks associated with chemical pollut-
ant exposures arising from food and feed. This resulted in the 
implementation of ADIs in 1954 by the US FDA (48). The ADI 
for a given pesticide active ingredient is derived from laboratory 
animal experiments performed by industry in support of regula-
tory approval. The objective of these experiments is to ascertain 
the dose of the chemical that results in a no observed adverse 
effect in the animals. Once this “no observed adverse effect level” 
is defined for the chemical in question, it is divided by a predeter-
mined value to account for uncertainty factors and thus provide 
a greater margin of safety. Typically, a factor of 10 is applied for 
animal to human extrapolation and another factor of 10 for 
interindividual variability in the human population. Testing of 
whole pesticide formulations instead of just active ingredients 
alone would constitute a precautionary approach ensuring that 
the calculated guidance value (ADI) is valid for the worst case 
exposure scenario. Such chronic tests in animals are also used to 
predict other combined effects with different compounds, such 
as the estimation of the hazard index. However, the current risk 
management includes many safety guidance values in addition to 
the ones described. Considering adjuvants as inert compromises 
the validity of some pesticide environmental risk indicators, for 
instance the Groundwater Ubiquity Score or the Environmental 
Impact Quotient (49). It is established that the half-life of pesticide 
active ingredients in soil is extended by the presence of adjuvants 
as has been demonstrated for chloridazon (50). A study investi-
gating the leaching of four pesticide formulations (azoxystrobin, 
propyzamide, triadimenol, and cyproconazole) through a sandy 
loam soil found that leaching was greater than was the case with 
their respective active ingredients alone (51).
Neglecting adjuvants may also impact the validity of the 
authorized maximum residue level (MRL). The MRL is supposed 
to ensure the safety of food/feed consumption. These chemical 
residue limits represent the maximum expected when applying 
a pesticide according to good agricultural practice. However, 
livestock feeding studies are generally performed with active 
ingredients alone, which therefore ignore the mixture effects 
from the adjuvants that are also consumed.
Issues regarding the differential and combined toxic effects of 
pesticide ingredients can also be considered from the perspective 
of chemical mixture toxicology. The understanding of combined 
effects of chemical mixtures is a massive challenge for toxicology 
as humans and the environment as a whole are exposed to a huge 
number of chemical pollutants. To simplify this problem, a com-
mon strategy is to prioritize the study of chemical mixtures, which 
are frequently found together. This is typically the case of pesticide 
commercial formulations. These mixtures can be deconstructed 
to either predict the toxicity of the mixture from the toxicity of 
their constituents or the whole mixture can be tested directly as 
it is found in the environment. According to scientific commit-
tees of the EU (adopted by EFSA), the whole-mixture approach 
is recommended for any unidentified materials in the mixture 
and for any interactions among mixture components (52). This 
is typically the case of pesticides, which are nevertheless evalu-
ated as single ingredients. A similar approach is suggested in the 
US by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, which has been 
implemented for pesticide assessment to reflect real-life scenarios 
(53). This includes recommendations to consider aggregate risk 
from exposure to some pesticide ingredients. The first, immediate 
exposure to a mixture in a typical general public and occupational 
context is that of active principles and adjuvants sold and used 
as pesticides. Following current strategies recommended by 
regulatory bodies to estimate the risk arising from the combined 
exposures to pesticide residues, would thus in principle lead to the 
consideration of mixture effects arising within the components of 
pesticide commercial formulations.

products as used in both agricultural and urban/domestic envi-
ronments. Chronic effects on mammals of complete commercial 
formulations of pesticides are never tested. Only short-term acute 
toxic effects are studied, which appears to be based on the promise 
that a combined exposure to the ingredients of these formulations 
is only likely to occur in exceptional circumstances such as inten-
tional ingestion in suicide attempts and accidental exposure due 
to mishandling. Nonetheless, exposure to environmental levels of 
some of these adjuvant mixtures has been associated with chronic 
human disease. For example, in epidemiological studies of farm-
ing populations, people exposed to supposedly inert ingredients 
such as solvents or petroleum distillates present a higher risk of 
their children developing hypospadias (54) and present more 
allergic and non-allergic wheeze (55). A recent study identified 
a role of prenatal environmental and occupational exposures to 
endocrine disruptive chemicals in the development of hypospa-
dias (56). The types of compounds involved were diverse, but 
detergents, pesticides, and cosmetics accounted for 75% of the 
cases of hypospadias. One should note that these are complex 
mixtures, which can contain adjuvants. In fact, the role of sol-
vents in the toxicity of pesticides is well characterized, and most 
incidences of intoxication caused by organophosphorus pesti-
cides can be attributed to their solvent content (57). Similarly, 
in cases of glyphosate-based herbicide exposure, the adjuvant 
content is known to be responsible for acute toxic effects (58). 
Thus, it is clear that adjuvants are responsible for most cases of 
acute toxicity of some commercial formulations of pesticides. 
The in vitro studies conducted by Séralini and colleagues using 
human cell culture model systems demonstrating far higher 
toxicity of commercial pesticide formulations, namely three 
insecticides (containing pirimicarb, imidacloprid, and acetami-
prid), three fungicides (containing tebuconazole, epoxiconazole, 
and prochloraz), and three herbicides (containing glyphosate, 
isoproturon, and fluroxypyr) (59), corroborates these findings. Of 
the nine formulations tested, eight were up to one thousand times 
more toxic than their stated active principle. This was due to the 
presence of xylene, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, solvent naphtha, 
or N,N-dimethyldecanaminde, among other toxic compounds, in 
the adjuvant mixtures present in the pesticide formulations (59).
In typical chronic environmental exposures, when pesticide 
residues are found in tap water, food, or feed, they arise from 
the total formulation and not only from the active ingredients. 
Adjuvants are indeed found in groundwater. The total concentra-
tion of six alcohol ethoxylates was found to be 710 ng/L in the 
groundwater of one agricultural area (60). High concentrations 
of these compounds (10–190 mg/kg), as well as of nonylphenol 
(25–600 mg/kg), can be found in sewage sludge collected from 
treatment plants (61). Nonylphenol is of particular concern as 
it is a known endocrine disruptive chemical originating from 
surfactants and has been found to be involved in the widespread 
feminization of wild fish in UK rivers (62). However, little is 
known about the contamination of the environment, or even of 
human body fluids, by surfactants used as adjuvants in pesticides.
The exposure to molecules viewed as “inert” by regulators, 
but which are known to be toxic, is widespread and not limited 
to agricultural pesticides. This also includes cosmetics, drugs 
(including veterinary products), disinfectant products, and even 
food additives. In the United States, additives in food products 
are covered and regulated by the Food Additives Amendment 
passed by Congress in 1958 (63). This encompasses the status of 
substances that are “generally recognized as safe,” so they can be 
added to food without a review of safety by the Food and Drug 
Administration. This includes synthetic dyes or preservatives, 
which have been linked to negative health outcomes in humans 
(34, 64). Moreover, some chemicals are considered to be active 
ingredients in some products and inert adjuvants in others, with 
the distinction between “inert” and “active” being more of a 
regulatory question rather than a toxicology issue (65).
ReCOMMeNDATiONS
The study of the effects of chemical mixtures on health indicators 
is frequently aired as a priority for the field of toxicology in the 
twenty-first century. However, within this framework, ignoring 
the toxicity of the combination of each active ingredient with its 
adjuvants could lead to misrepresentations of the safety profile of 
commercial pesticides. Therefore, we recommend the following 
actions to protect the public from toxicity that may arise from 
ingestion of adjuvants:
 
1. Biomonitoring of different human population groups to 
identify the true body burden of adjuvant classes of chemicals.
 
2. Surveying of food products to accurately identify sources of 
exposure.
 
3. Long-term laboratory animal toxicity studies comparing com-
mercial formulations with their active principle to measure 
adverse outcomes stemming from the adjuvants.
 
4. The gaps in knowledge and consequent uncertainties in risk 
assessment concerning the toxicity of chemical mixtures, 
including adjuvants, need to be acknowledged by regulators. 
Thus, an additional safety factor needs to be added when 
calculating MRL and ADI values.
 
5. All ingredients used in the manufacture of commercial formula-
tions of pesticides should be subjected to the same risk assess-
ment. The classification as inert or active has no scientific basis.
Given the all-pervasive nature of adjuvants in products used in 
both an agricultural and urban/domestic environment, potential 
toxicity arising from exposure to these chemical mixtures can 
be greater than from any pesticide active principle. Although we 
are aware that all chemicals have intrinsic toxicological proper-
ties and that hazardous chemical properties do not necessarily 
translate into a risk for human health, it is scientifically not sound 
to argue that adjuvants are so safe that they can be ignored. The 
implementation of the above recommendations will allow major 
progress to be made in protecting the environment and general 
human population from these toxicants. Current practices in 
risk assessment and regulation fall far short of providing such 
protection.
