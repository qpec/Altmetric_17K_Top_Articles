Innovative approaches to the use of existing antibiotics is an important strategy in efforts to address the escalating antimicrobial
resistance crisis. We report a new approach to the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections
by demonstrating that oxacillin can be used to significantly attenuate the virulence of MRSA despite the pathogen being resistant
to this drug. Using mechanistic in vitro assays and in vivo models of invasive pneumonia and sepsis, we show that oxacillin-treated
MRSA strains are significantly attenuated in virulence. This effect is based primarily on the oxacillin-dependent repression of
the accessory gene regulator quorum-sensing system and altered cell wall architecture, which in turn lead to increased susceptibility
to host killing of MRSA. Our data indicate that β-lactam antibiotics should be included in the treatment regimen as an adjunct
antivirulence therapy for patients with MRSA infections. This would represent an important change to current clinical practice
for treatment of MRSA infection, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in a safe, cost-effective manner.

New drug discovery, innovative deployment of existing
antimicrobials, and exploration of antivirulence drugs are stra-
tegically important in efforts to combat resistance to antimi-
crobial drugs. Healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) remains a predominant
nosocomial pathogen in which resistance to all licensed anti-
staphylococcal drugs has been reported. Resistance to methi-
cillin and related β-lactam antibiotics is achieved via the
acquisition of a mobile resistance cassette chromosome
(SCCmec) carrying mecA, which encodes an alternative
penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a, with a lower affinity for
β-lactam antibiotics than the native S. aureus PBPs. β-Lactam
resistance is highly regulated, and mecA expression is con-
trolled by the mecR1-mecI inducer-repressor system [1].
Beyond SCCmec, exposure to oxacillin has pleiotropic effects
because activation of mecA and PBP2a expression leads to re-
pression of the accessory gene regulator (Agr) operon [2–4].
Agr downregulation by β-lactam antibiotics promotes expres-
sion of numerous surface proteins and repression of
extracellular toxins and enzymes [3]. We previously reported
that expression of high-level methicillin resistance, which is
generally characteristic of HA-MRSA isolates, is accompanied
by reduced toxin production and virulence [2–4]. In contrast,
community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are gener-
ally resistant to lower concentrations of β-lactams (CA-
MRSA lineage USA300 is susceptible to >32 µg/mL oxacillin,
compared with >256 µg/mL for most HA-MRSA isolates) and
have emerged as an important cause of skin and soft-tissue in-
fections, pneumonia, and sepsis in healthy individuals [5].
Because methicillin resistance is a regulated phenotype, we
hypothesized that upregulation of methicillin resistance
induced by exposure to oxacillin would downregulate the
Agr system and virulence. Here we demonstrate that oxacillin
significantly attenuates the pathogenesis of MRSA infections
in mouse models of sepsis and pneumonia. RNA sequencing
of the MRSA transcriptome following exposure to subinhibi-
tory oxacillin revealed the basis of oxacillin-mediated attenu-
ation via repression of toxin production and altered cell wall
architecture, which led to enhanced complement deposition
and opsonophagocytic killing with a decreased bacterial bur-
den in the organs of infected mice. These data indicate that

 MRSA infections should significantly improve patient
outcomes.
METHODS
Strains
The strains used in this study are all derivatives of USA300. A
USA300 ΔlukS-PV mutant was a generous gift from Michael
Otto. Mutants harboring transposon insertions in toxin genes,
which were constructed in the USA300 derivative JE2, were ob-
tained from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant library [6].
RNA Isolation
Fifty-microliter bacterial cultures were seeded at a ratio of
1:1000 from overnight cultures and grown for 20 hours in
250-mL conical flasks, followed by total RNA isolation with
the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit, with the addition of 0.2 µg/µL
of lysostaphin (Ambi Products, New York) to the lysis step.
RNA quality and concentration were determined using the
Life Technologies Qubit fluorometer and visualization on an
agarose gel.
RNA Sequencing and Read Mapping
To compare global gene expression profiles, total RNA was ex-
tracted from 2 biological replicates of USA300 LAC grown for
20 hours in brain-heart infusion (BHI) medium and 3 biological
replicates of USA300 LAC grown for 20 hours in BHI supple-
mented with 2.0 µg/mL oxacillin. RNA sequencing was per-
formed using an Illumina MiSeq platform by the Biomedicum
Functional Genomics Unit (Finland). We screened 301-bp
paired-end RNA reads for quality, using FastQC (available at:
http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and
the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/
index.html) trimmed to the first high-quality 150 bp, and the po-
tential adaptor sequence was removed using Trimmomatic v0.32
[7]. The high-quality RNA reads had a mean length of 102 bp,
with an insert size of 133 bp: 93% of these mapped to the
USA300 reference chromosome (USA300_FPR3757; accession
number NC_007793.1) or plasmids (accession numbers
NC007790-93) using Bowtie2 [8]. The lowest and highest mean
coverage levels were 83-fold and 174-fold, respectively.
Gene Expression Quantification
Reads mapping to genes were counted using htseq-count from
HTSeq [9]. One surrograte variable was identified by surrogate
variable analysis, using svaseq v3.12.0 [10]; this variable was in-
cluded as an adjustment factor in the differential expression
model. Differentially expressed genes was compared between
samples with 0 µg/mL oxacillin versus those with 0.5 µg/mL ox-
acillin and between samples with 0 µg/mL oxacillin versus those
with 2 µg/mL oxacillin. This was conducted using the Wald test
in DeSeq2 v1.6.1 [11] where there was (1) a log2 fold change
(log2 FC) of >0.5 (as specified in the Wald test) and (2) a
false-discovery rate (FDR) Benjamini-Hochberg–adjusted P
value of < .1. The threshold of log2 FC >0.5 was more stringent
than the default value (>0). Eight genes (lacA-G and nuc) were
excluded owing to conflicting direction of expression changes
across comparisons.
Gene Expression in Pathways
Pathways and gene ontologies (GOs) with statistically elevated
levels of differentially expressed protein-coding genes were de-
tected using GOseq v1.18 [12], based on their QuickGO data-
base (available at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO) GO terms
and RefSeq identifiers. Genes present KEGG pathways were re-
trieved using the kegg.gsets function in GAGE v2.16.0 [13] and
were corrected for length. Overrepresented GO terms and
KEGG pathways had Benjamini-Hochberg–adjusted P values
of < .1, using the wallenius method in GOseq.
Reverse-Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-qPCR)
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated from messenger
RNA by using the Roche Transcriptor First Stand Synthesis kit
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, using ran-
dom hexamers. The following primers were used to amplify the
cDNA: gyrB forward, CCAGGTAAATTAGCCGATTGC; gyrB

Standard curves were produced for each primer set by using
serial dilutions of cDNA to determine primer efficiency.
RT-qPCR analyses were performed using SYBR reagent
(Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each
RT-PCR experiment, target gene mRNA levels were compared
to those for gyrB, and at least 3 biological replicates were used
(ie, RNA was extracted from at least 3 independent bacterial cul-
tures). In addition, duplicate RT-qPCRs for gyrB and each target
gene were performed on RNA extracted from each biological rep-
licate. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were subsequently determined,
and for each reaction, the ratio of the target gene (x) and gyrB
transcript numbers was calculated as 2[Ct × gyrB− × Ctx].
Phage Adsorption Assays
Phage ΦWS2 was initially propagated on S. aureus strain 8325-
4. Fifty-milliliter bacterial cultures were seeded at a ratio of

 1:1000 from overnight cultures and grown for 20 hours in 250-
mL conical flasks. Where indicated, antibiotics were added 4
hours after inoculation. A 200-µL cell suspension normalized
to an A600 of 0.5 was mixed with 100 µL of phage (at a titer
of approximately 100–200 plaques/plate) and incubated at
37°C for 15 minutes to allow phage adsorption. The cells
were then placed on ice for 5 minutes, and bacteria plus ad-
sorbed phage was removed via centrifugation. Fifty microliters
of supernatant containing any unbound phage was added to a
50-µL suspension of 8325-4 cells from an overnight culture,
mixed with 5 mL of semisoft tryptone soy agar (TSA), and
poured onto TSA plates supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2 before
being incubated at 37°C for 20 hours. Plaques were subse-
quently counted, and adsorption efficiency was calculated as
the percentage of adsorbed phage relative to the number of
phage used to infect the bacterial cells.
Neutrophil Lysis Assays
Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of
healthy volunteers following informed consent, as approved by
the University of Liverpool Ethics Committee. Heparinized
blood was incubated with 6% dextran in phosphate-buffered sa-
line (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes at room temperature.
The top, clear layer containing leukocytes was transferred to a
fresh tube, and the cells were underlaid with 7 mL of Histopa-
que (Sigma) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 20 minutes. The
overlying plasma and PBMC layers were aspirated, and the neu-
trophil/red blood cell pellets were suspended in 1 × red blood
cell lysis buffer (eBioscience). Cells were then washed in sterile
PBS and resuspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) 1640 medium (Invitrogen) buffered with 10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.2) to a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/mL.
For the neutrophil lysis assay, the bacteria were subcultured
in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth, RPMI medium, or CCY
broth with or without oxacillin for 20 hours. Bacterial cell den-
sities were adjusted to an A600 of 1, and supernatants were col-
lected. A total of 30 µL of the neutrophil suspension was mixed
with 10 µL of culture supernatant and incubated at 37°C for 30
minutes. Assays were performed in duplicate, and cell integrity
was assessed using trypan blue live/dead staining microscopic
analysis. Where indicated by asterisks in Figure 2, differences
between groups were deemed significant as assessed using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test and 2-tailed Student t tests.
C3b Deposition and Opsonophagocytic Assays
C3b deposition assays were performed as described previously
[14]. Briefly, 107 colony-forming units (CFU) of USA300 LAC,
JE2, and JE2 tarS::Tn were incubated in 20 µL of S. aureus–
treated human serum (20%) for 25 minutes. Bound C3b was de-
tected using mouse anti-human C3 monoclonal antibody
(Abcam) and anti-mouse IgG2a APC (EBioscience) and subse-
quently measured using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer. Thiazole
orange (BD) was added to each sample to isolate bacteria. The
opsonophagocytic assay was performed as described previously
[15, 16]. A total of 4 × 105 HL-60 human neutrophil cells were
incubated with 1 × 103 opsonized USA300 LAC, JE2, and JE2
tarS::Tn and complement. The number of CFU was counted
by plating onto blood agar plates following incubation for a fur-
ther 45 minutes (for HL-60 cells) or 60 minutes (for J774 cells).
Intravenous immunoglobulin at a final dilution of 1:16 was used
as the source for pathogen-specific antibody for opsonization.
Nonopsonized staphylococci were used as a control. Statistical
significance was assessed using a 2-tailed Student t test.
Mouse Infection Experiments
Age-matched, 6–8-week-old, outbred CD1 female mice
(Charles River, United Kingdom) were used in a nonlethal
model of sepsis and a lethal model of pneumonia. USA300 cul-
tures were grown to an A600 of 1 in BHI broth for the sepsis
model and overnight for the pneumonia model, washed in
PBS, and adjusted to appropriate cell densities. For bacteremia,
5 × 106 CFU USA300 (10 mice/group) were injected into the
tail vein and left untreated (PBS control) or treated with 7.5
mg or 75 mg oxacillin/kg/12 hours (the first antibiotic dose
was administered 9 hours after infection), before being eutha-
nized after 28 hours and 7 days. For pneumonia, mice were
anesthetized with O2 and isoflurane and infected intranasally
with 2–3 × 108 CFU. Survival was followed over 7 days in un-
treated and oxacillin-treated mice (7.5 or 75 mg oxacillin/kg
in 1 dose after 3.5 hours; 10 mice/group). Blood specimens
were obtained from tails 15 hours after infection to assess bac-
teremia. Blood specimens collected from animals with pneumo-
nia or homogenates of organs obtained from mice with sepsis
were plated on blood agar. Statistical significance was assessed
using the 2-tailed Student t test. Mouse experiments were ap-
proved by the United Kingdom Home Office (Home Office
Project License Number 40/3602) and the University of Liver-
pool Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.
RESULTS
Oxacillin Treatment Significantly Improves Survival of Mice Infected by
CA-MRSA
The therapeutic potential of oxacillin in the treatment of MRSA
infections was assessed in mice. Based on clinical protocols in
humans (flucloxacillin is administered intravenously at 100–
200 mg/kg/day), oxacillin was intravenously administered to
mice twice daily at a therapeutic concentration of 75 mg/kg/
12 hours (high dose) or at one tenth the therapeutic dose
(7.5 mg/kg/12 hours; low dose). To establish sepsis, groups of
5 mice were infected via the tail vein with 5 × 106 CFU of
USA300, and the infection was allowed to establish for 9
hours before oxacillin or PBS (control) were administered.
Thereafter, oxacillin was administered every 12 hours, and the
infection was allowed to proceed for 28 hours or 7 days
(Figure 1). Oxacillin reduced the bacterial burden in the kidneys
and spleens of infected animals after 28 hours or 7 days,

 reaching significance after 7 days at both low and high doses,
reducing the number of CFUs in kidneys by 4 logs and clearing
CFUs from spleen (Figure 1A). No visible abscesses were pre-
sent on kidneys recovered from infected mice treated with
high-dose oxacillin, while kidneys recovered from only 40% of
infected mice treated with low-dose oxacillin had visible kidney
abscesses, compared with 80% of untreated mice (Figure 1B).
Oxacillin treatment was also therapeutically effective in a mu-
rine pneumonia model, with survival increasing from 20% in
the untreated group to 60% in mice treated after 3.5 hours
with high or low doses of oxacillin (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
the number of bacteria recovered from the blood of mice with
pneumonia was significantly reduced in the low- and high-dose
oxacillin treatment groups—a key stage in the development of
sepsis secondary to pneumonia (Figure 1D).
Oxacillin Represses Cytolytic Toxin Production by CA-MRSA via
Downregulation of Agr
The previously reported strain-dependent effects of oxacillin on
the production of a number of S. aureus toxins [4] prompted
further investigation of oxacillin-modulated USA300 cytolytic
activity. The susceptibility of neutrophils isolated from fresh
human blood (which are susceptible to lysis by S. aureus toxins,
including Panton-Valentine leukocidin [PVL]) was tested
against supernatants from cultures of USA300 or the
USA300-derivative strain JE2, the parent strain of the Nebraska
transposon mutant library [6], grown in BHI, RPMI, or CCY
media. Previous experiments showing that upregulation and
increased cytolytic activity of PVL by S. aureus grown in a
sub–minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin
were performed only in CCY medium [4, 17], which appears
to artificially induce higher PVL levels than measured in
human abscesses or serum [18]. Western blots showed that
PVL was expressed in BHI and CCY but not RPMI medium
(data not shown). Mutation of lukS-PV in USA300 or JE2 sig-
nificantly reduced neutrophil lysis but only in CCY medium
(Figure 2A and 2B). Oxacillin-supplemented BHI or RPMI
culture supernatants were less toxic to neutrophils, reaching
significance in BHI medium (Figure 2A), whereas oxacillin-
supplemented CCY supernatants were significantly more tox-
ic (Figure 2A). Agr mutant supernatants were significantly
less toxic (Figure 2B). Mutations in hlb, hlgA, and hlgB
toxin genes did not attenuate toxicity (Figure 2B). Medium-
dependent effects were associated with mutations in lukD,
lukE, and hlgA, which attenuated toxicity in RPMI medium
(lukD), RPMI and CCY media (lukE), and CCY medium
(hlgA), respectively (Figure 2B). Thus, potential concern
about upregulation of PVL toxin by oxacillin are ameliorated
by these data showing that this was only evident in CCY medi-
um and not in RPMI or BHI media. Collectively these data re-
veal a dominant role for the Agr system under all growth
conditions (with a relatively minor role for other toxins) in ox-
acillin-induced attenuation of cytotoxicity.
Oxacillin-Induced Activation of Teichoic Acid Biosynthesis
Is Associated With Enhanced Complement Deposition and
Opsonophagocytosis
To further investigate the basis for oxacillin-induced virulence
attenuation, RNA extracted from USA300 grown for 20 hours
in sub-inhibitory oxacillin (2.0 µg/mL) was sequenced. Oxacil-
lin down-regulated 25 genes and up-regulated 174, including
activation of mecA and concomitant repression of agr (Supple-
mentary Figure S1 and Table S1). By using a 4-fold lower oxa-
cillin concentration (0.5 µg/mL), a subset of genes exhibiting
highly elevated (16) or reduced (9) expression at both antibiotic
concentrations was identified (Figure 3A) and confirmed
by qPCR (Figure 3B). Two major themes emerged from these
data, namely that (1) 3 genes encoding major global regulators
(agr, rot [repressor of toxins {Rot}], and vraR [vancomycin
resistance regulator {VraR}]) and (2) genes encoding enzymes
involved in the wall teichoic acids (WTA) biosynthesis were
regulated by oxacillin. The >5-fold activation of rot was con-
sistent with repression of agr, and VraR is known to activate

 a cell-wall-stress regulon in response to β-lactam and glycopep-
tide antibiotics [19].
The highly conserved mraZ and mraW genes, located at the
head of the division and cell wall dcw (division and cell wall)/
mra (murein A) gene cluster, may also contribute to altered cell
wall architecture in response to oxacillin. The transcriptional
regulator MraZ controls expression of genes within and outside
the dcw cluster [20]and mraW (rsmH) encodes a 16S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) methyltransferase. rRNA methyltransferases have
been implicated in control of ribosome function in response to
various stresses [20, 21]. Repression of the purine biosynthetic
operon (apparently via activation of the purR repressor) was

 the largest fold change (>20-fold) identified, and although the
biological reason for this remains unclear, the purine nucleotide
signaling molecules cyclic diadenosine monophosphate and
ppGpp have been implicated in homogeneous oxacillin resis-
tance [2,22,23],perhaps suggesting a physiological requirement
to maintain intracellular purine homeostasis under oxacillin
stress. Activation of the spa gene (presumably mediated by
Rot [24]), which encodes protein A, an antibody-evasion pro-
tein, was not consistent with reduced virulence and may suggest
that oxacillin-mediated attenuation of virulence is primarily as-
sociated with increased susceptibility to innate, rather than ac-
quired, immune responses.
The dlt operon, tarS, and tagH, which are involved in mod-
ification and export of WTAs, were activated by oxacillin. Fur-
thermore, activation of the Rot- and Agr-regulated dlt operon is
consistent with oxacillin-induced activation of rot and repres-
sion of agr [24, 25]. WTA in S. aureus is composed of multiple
ribitol phosphate units modified with D-alanine and O-N-ace-
tylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in either an α or β configuration
[26, 27] and is implicated in cell division, biofilm formation,
and virulence. α-O-GlcNAc and β-O-GlcNAc WTA modifica-
tions are catalyzed by the TarM and TarS glycosyltransferases,
respectively [26], and loss of WTA or deletion of tarS alone in-
creases MRSA susceptibility to β-lactams [26]. Furthermore
WTA N-acetylglucosamine residues contribute to opsonopha-
gocytosis by activating the complement system [27]. The
approximately 5-fold activation of tarS (Supplementary
Figure S2) can be predicted to contribute to increased resistance
to β-lactams, enhanced complement deposition and opsono-
phagocytosis, and promote interactions with phage for which
glycosylated WTA acts as a receptor [27]. Binding of phage
WS2 to USA300 and JE2 was tars dependent, and WS2 binding
to wild-type cells grown in subinhibitory oxacillin (0.5 µg/mL)
was significantly elevated, increasing to 100% in cells exposed to
high-dose oxacillin (data not shown). TarS-dependent deposi-
tion of complement protein C3b on oxacillin-grown cells was
also significantly increased, which in turn was associated with
significantly higher levels of opsonophagocytosis, using HL-
60 neutrophil cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Apparently, increased
oxacillin-induced β-O-GlcNAcylation of WTA promotes opso-
nophagocytosis. Collectively, among the pleiotropic effects of
oxacillin, activation of rot, repression of agr, activation of
WTA biosynthesis, increased WTA β-O-GlcNAcylation, and
enhanced opsonophagocytosis are predominant effectors of ox-
acillin-induced virulence attenuation.
DISCUSSION
The widespread and generally safe clinical use of β-lactam anti-
biotics means there are few barriers to their redeployment as
antivirulence agents in combination with other antibiotics.
Although our data are limited to USA300, which was chosen
because its oxacillin MIC can be significantly increased in the
presence of the antibiotic, the dominant phenotypes associated
with MRSA exposure to oxacillin were entirely consistent with
virulence attenuation. The USA300 data presented here are sup-
ported by a 1981 study showing the therapeutic potential of an
ampicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination against nafcillin-
resistant S. aureus in a rabbit model of endocarditis [28] and by
more-recent studies showing that β-lactam antibiotics can po-
tentiate the activity of antimicrobial peptides against methicil-
lin-susceptible S. aureus and MRSA [29, 30]. Potential concern
about upregulation of PVL toxin by oxacillin [4] was ameliorat-
ed by data showing that this was only evident in CCY medium
and not in RPMI or BHI media. In the animal experiments de-
scribed in this study, the bacteria were grown in BHI medium to
ensure that PVL levels were not artificially activated and, thus,
that they were more physiologically relevant [18]. A recent ran-
domized, controlled study with 60 patients revealed that the du-
ration of bacteremia was reduced from 3 to 1.9 days in patients
treated with both vancomycin and flucloxacillin, compared with
those treated with vancomycin alone [31], further indicating
that potential induction of PVL by β-lactams does not exacer-
bate MRSA infections. In addition, our findings provide mech-
anistic insights that explain and support the therapeutic benefits
observed in this clinical trial. The therapeutic benefit and cost-
effectiveness of using β-lactams to repress toxin production,
