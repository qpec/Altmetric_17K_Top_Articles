Abstract
The Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) developed methods and tools 
for conducting multi-scanner functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Method and 
tool development were based on two major goals: 1) to assess the major sources of variation in 
fMRI studies conducted across scanners, including instrumentation, acquisition protocols, 
challenge tasks, and analysis methods, and 2) to provide a distributed network infrastructure and 
an associated federated database to host and query large, multi-site, fMRI and clinical datasets. In 
the process of achieving these goals the FBIRN test bed generated several multi-scanner brain 
imaging data sets to be shared with the wider scientific community via the BIRN Data Repository 
(BDR). The FBIRN Phase 1 dataset consists of a traveling subject study of 5 healthy subjects, 
each scanned on 10 different 1.5 to 4 Tesla scanners. The FBIRN Phase 2 and Phase 3 datasets 
consist of subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder along with healthy comparison 
subjects scanned at multiple sites. In this paper, we provide concise descriptions of FBIRN’s 
multi-scanner brain imaging data sets and details about the BIRN Data Repository instance of the 
Human Imaging Database (HID) used to publicly share the data.
1. Introduction
The Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) was a National Institutes 
of Health (NIH), National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) funded program designed 
to develop methods and tools to enable multi-center functional MRI studies. Multi-center 
studies can address several issues in medical research, including representative sampling 
and faster acquisition of large data sets of common2 or rare cases that are slow to acquire at 
individuals sites3. Representative sampling allows for broader generalization of findings, 
such as sampling based on census data1, an important problem given the typical 
demographic, ethnic, geographic, dietary, and co-morbidity variability found in many

 disorders. However, multi-scanner studies are only feasible if one can adequately control 
between-site variance.
To enable multi-scanner fMRI studies, FBIRN developed the FBIRN agar phantom and 
associated software for scanner quality assurance4, 5, standardized fMRI scanner sequences 
and recommendations for multi-center functional imaging studies6, and the open-source 
Federated Informatics Research Environment (FIRE; Figure 1)7–9, which includes the BIRN 
Human Imaging Database (HID; www.nitrc.org/projects/hid) and web interface.
The HID provides the following capabilities: a) double data entry and validation (e.g., for 
clinical scale data), b) imaging and associated behavioral, and physiological (e.g., heart rate, 
respiration) data upload, and c) imaging, clinical, and derived data storage, query, and 
download7, 8. The HID was designed to manage federated data acquisition, hosting, and 
querying but can also be used as a centralized database for storing and sharing imaging and 
associated behavioral and clinical data with the broader research community.
This manuscript describes the FBIRN Data Repository (BDR), a simplified instance of the 
HID used for sharing FBIRN data, which were collected in the process of developing multi-
center fMRI methods, with the wider research community. In the methods section we 
address several questions about the FBIRN BDR, including: 1) what was the BDR designed 
to do, 2), which data sets does it provide, 3) which data formats are available, 4) what 
quality control was performed on these data sets, 5) how do you access the BDR, 6) can new 
data be contributed to the BDR, and 7) what are the long term plans for the BDR? We 
conclude the manuscript referring to some of the published findings and works in progress 
based on data hosted on the BDR.
2 Methods
2.1 Purpose of the BIRN Data Repository
The BDR (fbirnbdr.nbirn.net:8080/BDR) was designed for the purpose of public sharing of 
FBIRN multi-modal (imaging, clinical, cognitive, and physiological) data with the research 
community. The BDR was built using a modified instance of the BIRN HID (version 1.6.2). 
To create the BDR, the full HID system was reduced. Query capabilities were limited to 
streamline use by those unfamiliar with the HID system and new data entry was disallowed. 
The data was collated by subject/project/site and linked on the HID home screen to enable 
easy downloads. Moreover, access control was modified to allow public access based on 
email addresses.
The BDR makes downloading large amounts of data simple. Users select and submit 
datasets for download using checkboxes. This process generates a request to the job 
management service, which handles transferring the bundle to the HID web server. The user 
can return later to check if the job has been completed. Once the bundle is available on the 
web server, the dataset can be downloaded to a local computer. The datasets will remain in 
the job management console until the user removes the entry or the BDR cache reaches 
capacity, at which time the oldest bundles will be deleted to free up space.

 2.2 BIRN Data Repository Imaging Data Sets
This section describes the FBIRN Phase I, II, and III multi-center data sets. Currently, the 
BDR hosts FBIRN Phase I and Phase II data. The BDR FBIRN Phase III data will become 
publicly available in the fall of 2015. For information on sites involved in data collection for 
each project see S1, Table 7.
2.2.1 FBIRN Phase I Traveling Subjects Dataset—The FBIRN “Phase I” study 
objectives were to identify sources of inter-site differences in fMRI studies, to find ways to 
decrease variability by standardizing studies where possible, and to develop methods for 
correcting remaining inter-site differences4, 10, 11.
2.2.1.1 Study Design: The Phase I study included 5 right-handed, native English speaking, 
healthy male subjects between 20–29 years of age. Three subjects were Caucasian and two 
were African, each having at least 15 years of education. The subjects had no history of 
psychiatric or neurological illness, no MRI contraindications, and normal hearing. None of 
the subjects used nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, or regular medications. To measure inter-site, 
inter-subject, and intersession variance, the 5 traveling subjects were assessed with structural 
(sMRI) and functional (fMRI) scans on 2 separate days on ten different scanners across the 
country (see S1, Table 1,2). The scanner manufacturer, model, field strength (1.5-4 Tesla), 
head coil, and auditory, visual, and response devices varied across sites (see S1, Table 3). 
Since there is no obvious way to calibrate functional signals from cognitive tasks, FBIRN 
developed a sensorimotor (SM) task, to activate motor, visual, and auditory cortices, and a 
breath-hold (BH) task to measure vascular response.
2.2.1.2 Imaging Assessments: The imaging protocol at each site included: high-resolution 
T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fMRI scans of Mismatch Negativity, Serial Item 
Recognition Paradigm (SIRP, 2 runs),12 SM10, resting state (REST), and BH13, 14 tasks. All 
tasks were performed in the same order at each site (see S1 Table 4). The tasks were 
programmed in E-Prime (www.pstnet.com), started by scanner trigger, and collected 
behavioral responses and response times. A basic in-scanner reaction time task was 
administered for comparison of response devices across sites.
2.2.1.3 Additional Assessments: All study participants were clinically assessed with the 
Structured Clinical Interview for the DSMN-on-Patient 15, the Beck Depression Inventory16, 
the Zung Self-Administered Anxiety Scale17, and the North American Adult Reading 
Test18. The Quick Mood Scale19 was also administered before and after each scan.
2.2.2 FBIRN Phase II Schizophrenia Dataset—The FBIRN Phase II study objective 
was to conduct a multi-center fMRI study in a clinical population to further develop multi-
center methods to decrease inter-site variance in normal and clinical populations by 
standardization, building on the lessons learned during the FBIRN Phase I study.
2.2.2.1 Study Design: The Phase II study was able to share data from 87 individuals with 
DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnoses (SZ, 59 males) and 85 healthy 
comparison subjects (HC, 70 males) between the ages of 18–70. All subjects had normal

 hearing levels, sufficient eyesight to see visual displays, an IQ > 75, were fluent in English, 
were able to perform the study tasks, had no previous head injury or prolonged 
unconsciousness, substance and/or alcohol dependence, migraine treatments, or MRI 
contraindications. SZ subjects were excluded if they had a current or past history of a major 
medical illness, had significant extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia (measured 
by the Global section of the AIMS20), or were not clinically stable (had significant changes 
in their psychotropic medications in the previous two months). HC subjects were excluded if 
they had a current or past history of a major neurological or psychiatric medical illness or 
had a first degree relative with a psychotic illness diagnosis. Scanner field strengths ranged 
from 1.5 to 4.0 Tesla and included General Electric (GE), Siemens, and Marconi (Picker) 
imaging platforms. The scanner manufacturer, model, field strength, head coil, and auditory, 
visual, and response devices varied across sites (see S1 Table 5). Subjects had a normal 
night’s sleep, no more than one alcoholic drink the night before each scan, and abstained 
from drinking coffee 2 hours and smoking 40 minutes prior to scanning. Each scan session 
consisted of brief training to familiarize the subject with the paradigms and placement in the 
scanner for about 1.5 hours during which all images were collected. For each subject, the 
entire imaging session was repeated between 24 hours to 3 weeks later.
2.2.2.2 Imaging Assessments: The imaging protocol at each site included: T1-weighted and 
T2-weighted scans, B0 field mapping, the SM task (4 runs)10, a Serial Item Recognition 
Paradigm (SIRP; 3 runs)12, Auditory Oddball (AO) task (4 runs)21, 22, and a BH task23. All 
tasks were performed in the same order at each site. The tasks were programmed in E-Prime 
(www.pstnet.com) and recorded behavioral responses and response times. Stimulus 
responses were recorded using an SRBox response device. A basic in-scanner reaction time 
task was administered for comparison of response devices across sites. Visual stimuli were 
delivered using either rear-projection screens, front-projection screens with coil-mounted 
mirrors, or MRI-compatible goggles. Auditory stimuli were standardized as much as 
possible using an auditory setup program. The stimuli were delivered using pneumatic, 
sound-insulated headphones adjusted to a volume level that could be heard comfortably over 
the scanner noise. The relative volume was recorded, as it varied by scanner, subject, and 
headphones.
For every task, except AO, subjects completed one practice run prior to scanning. A 
behavioral analysis was run immediately to determine subjects were performing at 
acceptable levels (greater than 75% on the SIRP task). A reaction time task was also 
performed prior to scanning. In addition, the reaction time task was administered once 
subjects were inside the scanner, for comparison of response devices across sites. Responses 
were monitored using keypads, and reaction times were recorded for subsequent 
psychophysical analysis of timing and accuracy of task performance.
2.2.2.3 Additional Assessments: Prior to participating in scanning procedures, all subjects 
received extensive diagnostic evaluations by experienced raters. Subjects were diagnosed 
using the SCID15, 24. All participants received a demographics assessment, the Edinburgh 
Handedness Inventory25, Socio-economic Status Questionnaire (SES), Fagerstrom Test for 
Nicotine Dependence26 (FTND), Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS), and the

 NAART18. In addition, all patients received the following symptom and side effect ratings: 
Scales for the Assessment of Positive (SAPS)27 and Negative Symptoms (SANS)28, a 
modified Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS)29, Calgary Depression Scale 
(CDS)30, Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS), Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), the 
InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking31, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)20, 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)32, and Simpson-Angus Scale33 (SAS). All subjects 
completed an expanded version of the Quick Mood Scale immediately before/after each 
scanning session. The demographics assessment included age, gender, handedness, 
ethnicity, education (individual/family), occupation, living arrangements, number of 
children, and marital status.
The assessment data were collected electronically using forms designed in CALM and 
deployed on the HID. The forms were designed to mimic the physical layout of the 
corresponding paper assessments whenever possible. The data were double-entered into the 
HID and discrepancies resolved using a reconciliation interface. Each participating site 
entered the assessments into their local HID and data were made available to consortium 
members using the HID federated query interface.
2.2.3 FBIRN Phase III Schizophrenia Dataset—The FBIRN Phase III study objective 
was to conduct a large multi-center fMRI study in a clinical population, using the mature 
FBIRN multi-center methods6, 34 to decrease inter-site variance in both normal and clinical 
populations by standardization, building on the lessons learned and tools developed during 
the previous Phase I and II studies. The Phase III study was the second major multi-site 
FBIRN study of a clinical population, beginning in January of 2010.
2.2.3.1 Study Design: The dataset includes sMRI, fMRI, DTI, behavioral data, and 
demographic and clinical assessments, on 186 healthy controls and 176 individuals with 
schizophrenia from around the U.S. The goals of the Phase III study were similar to the 
Phase II study, to decrease inter-site variance by further standardization and by testing the 
methods for correction in normal and clinical populations developed in Phase l and ll. Study 
participants were between the ages of 18–62. The exclusion criteria were the same as those 
described for the Phase II study (see Section 2.2.2).
2.2.3.2 Imaging Assessments: The imaging protocol at each site included: localizer, T1-
weighted, T2-weighted, B0 field mapping scans (4), arterial spin labeling, a diffusion tensor 
imaging scan (30 directions, 4 b=0), an Emotional Distracter Object Working Memory (7 
runs), AO (2 runs), and two resting state (short+long) fMRI scans. All sites used 3.0 Tesla 
MRI scanners and included GE and Siemens imaging platforms. The order of the tasks was 
constant, unless technical difficulties precluded this and is provided with the data. All tasks 
started by scanner trigger. The stimuli and responses were presented and collected using 
Cigal (www.nitrc.org/projects/cigal)35, 36. The scanner manufacturer, model, head coil, and 
auditory, visual, and response devices varied across sites. The site IDs were kept constant 
relative to the Phase I and Phase II studies, enabling comparison of within site data across 
the data sets.

 2.2.3.4 Additional Assessments: Subjects were diagnosed using the SCID15, 24 (modules 
A-E excluding anxiety disorders). All participants received a demographics assessment, the 
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory25, SES, FTND26, and the NAART18. In addition, all 
patients received the following symptom and side effects ratings, SAPS27, SANS28, 
PANSS29, SDS37, CDI30, Clinical Global Impression (CGI), AIMS20, BARS32, and SAS33. 
An expanded demographics assessment relative to the Phase II study was administered 
which included the following additional variables: drug history, diagnosis, body mass index, 
suicide attempts, and number of hospitalizations. An extensive neurocognitive tests battery 
was administered using the CMINDS™ platform38 (www.neurocomp.com/neurocomp/
Solutions/Cminds; (see S1, Table 6).
The assessment data were collected electronically using forms deployed on a clinical 
assessment tablet system39. Once data was collected on the tablet, they were electronically 
imported into the local HID and made available to the entire consortium using the HID 
federated query interface.
2.3 Data Formats
All BDR imaging data are unprocessed and shared in NIfTI format. The fMRI task data are 
shared as E-Prime 1.0 Edat files (www.pstnet.com) or CIGAL text output (www.nitrc.org/
projects/cigal) and the clinical data are shared in Microsoft Excel format. The BDR does not 
provide derived data, data processing pipelines, or citable DOIs or URIs.
2.4 Quality Control Performed on BDR Data Sets
Quality control (QC) of the FBIRN data was assessed during data collection. Our methods 
matured over the course of the projects, as we gained greater insight about previously 
unknown problems in collecting large imaging datasets in a distributed consortium. Here we 
summarize the primary QC components, see 4, 6 for additional information.
After acquisition the image data were uploaded to a locally installed HID data management 
system using the FBIRN data upload scripts (www.nitrc.org/projects/fbirn). The scripts 
include a graphical user interface to collect metadata about the scan (e.g. slice timing, 
project name, etc), which is saved in XCEDE (www.xcede.org) XML files. XCEDE is an 
extensive meta data hierarchy for storing, describing, and documenting data generated by 
scientific studies9. The XCEDE files were checked for consistency with respect to the 
consortium protocol using a Schematron validator (www.schematron.com). Image QC was 
then performed automatically after HID upload. The FBIRN developed a battery of QC 
metrics included with the XCEDE tools (www.nitrc.org/projects/bxh_xcede_tools)4. The 
results of the QC reports were reviewed by a data curator and posted on a Wiki. For Phase 
III, a study-tracking dashboard was created, tracking all steps of the data collection progress 
of each site, including entries for clinical assessments, imaging sessions, data availability, 
and QC reports. Data that did not pass QC was not made available through the BDR.
2.5 BIRN Data Repository Access and Download
The BDR is an open-access, public repository for the FBIRN data sets. It requires only an 
email address to login. A BDR user benefits from submitting a valid email address because 
Keator et al.

 notifications are sent to those email addresses when there is a change to the data archive or if 
notices about problem data sets needs to be communicated. Data collected as part of the 
FBIRN project are under the governance of the BIRN Data Usage Agreement 
(www.birncommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/FBIRN_Data_Use_Agreement.pdf). 
The agreement specifies that publications using the FBIRN data sets cite the appropriate 
FBIRN grant. Redistribution of original Function BDR data is permitted so long as the data 
are redistributed under the same terms and conditions as described in the original document.
2.6 Contributing New Data to the BIRN Data Repository
The FBIRN Phase I, II, and III BDR data sets are static. While the BDR is actively 
maintained and additional data sets could theoretically be added to the BDR, there is no 
financial support for hosting other public data sets, but we are supportive of collaborations 
with research groups interested in hosting their public data in the BDR (e.g., BrainScape 
data hosted at fbirnbdr.nbirn.net:8080/BDR) or the HID (e.g., Autism Brain Imaging Data 
Exchange [ABIDE] hosted at computed2.bic.uci.edu:8080/abide).
2.7 Long Term Plans for the BIRN Data Repository
The BDR will continue to play a significant role in sharing both the FBIRN control-only and 
schizophrenia-control data sets with the research community into the foreseeable future, as 
long as there appears to be a demand for the data (data download rate is currently at about 
~80 downloads/month). In addition, there is a plan to also make FBIRN’s schizophrenia-
control data sets available via the SchizConnect resource (www.schizconnect.org)40. 
SchizConnect has been designed to federate schizophrenia data and provides an integrated 
domain model with other data resources. The FBIRN component of SchizConnect is 
managed through a HID database but the data are federated through the SchizConnect 
mediation service. The FBIRN Phase II schizophrenia data set is already available on 
SchizConnect and the Phase III schizophrenia data release is in progress.
3. Discussion and Conclusions
This paper describes the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network Data 
Repository (BDR), which hosts the FBIRN Phase I and Phase II data and will host Phase III 
data for use by the wider scientific community. The Phase I and II imaging data sets have 
yielded numerous publications important to the fields of multi-center imaging and 
schizophrenia6, 10, 12, 21, 41–44.
The FBIRN consortium is actively working on publishing a first wave of scientific findings 
based on the multi-center Phase III clinical 45, cognitive, structural imaging46 and functional 
imaging47–49 data, which will be released to the public in the fall of 2015.
All the tools and methods developed by the Function Biomedical Informatics Research 
Network (FBIRN) are open source and open access or in the process of being made 
available in service of scientific teaching and discovery. The FBIRN data sets are freely 
available to the extent allowed by the member site’s IRBs. Many of the FBIRN tools 
continue to support multi-site research and some have formed the basis for state-of-the-art 
neuroimaging metadata tools such as the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM;

FBIRN’s FIRE is an open-source and integrated set of tools for performing multi-site 
neuroimaging studies which includes: 1) centralized authentication and authorization 
services to support federated group management across resources, 2) support for both 
locally-mounted (e.g., NFS) and distributed file systems (i.e. Gridftp and the Storage 
Resource Broker), 3) a Clinical Assessment Layout Manager (CALM) for creating online 
data entry forms, 4) the Human Imaging Database (HID; www.nitrc.org/projects/hid) which 
provides all data management processes required for multi-center fMRI studies, 5) a 
standardized directory structure, and 6) the fBIRN image processing stream (http://
www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~greve/fbirn/fips/).
