Abstract
Background: Stroke is one of the most common causes of acquired disability, leaving numerous adults with
cognitive and motor impairments, and affecting patients’ capability to live independently. There is substancial
evidence on post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation benefits, but its implementation is generally limited by the use of
paper-and-pencil methods, insufficient personalization, and suboptimal intensity. Virtual reality tools have shown
potential for improving cognitive rehabilitation by supporting carefully personalized, ecologically valid tasks through
accessible technologies. Notwithstanding important progress in VR-based cognitive rehabilitation systems, specially
with Activities of Daily Living (ADL’s) simulations, there is still a need of more clinical trials for its validation. In this
work we present a one-month randomized controlled trial with 18 stroke in and outpatients from two rehabilitation
units: 9 performing a VR-based intervention and 9 performing conventional rehabilitation.
Methods: The VR-based intervention involved a virtual simulation of a city – Reh@City - where memory, attention,
visuo-spatial abilities and executive functions tasks are integrated in the performance of several daily routines. The
intervention had levels of difficulty progression through a method of fading cues. There was a pre and post-
intervention assessment in both groups with the Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination (primary outcome) and the
Trail Making Test A and B, Picture Arrangement from WAIS III and Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (secondary outcomes).
Results: A within groups analysis revealed significant improvements in global cognitive functioning, attention,
memory, visuo-spatial abilities, executive functions, emotion and overall recovery in the VR group. The control
group only improved in self-reported memory and social participation. A between groups analysis, showed
significantly greater improvements in global cognitive functioning, attention and executive functions when
comparing VR to conventional therapy.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that cognitive rehabilitation through the Reh@City, an ecologically valid VR
system for the training of ADL’s, has more impact than conventional methods.
Trial registration: This trial was not registered because it is a small sample study that evaluates the clinical validity
of a prototype virtual reality system.

 Background
In most countries, stroke is among most common causes
of death and one of the main causes of acquired adult
disability [1]. Because most patients with stroke survive
the initial illness, the greatest impact is usually caused
by the long term consequences for patients and their
families [2]. It is estimated that 33 to 42 % of stroke sur-
vivors require assistance for daily living activities three
to six months post stroke, and of these, 36 % continue
to be disabled five years later [3, 4]. Although remark-
able developments have been made in the medical treat-
ment
of
stroke,
it
continues
to
heavily
rely
on
rehabilitation interventions. In addition to motor disabil-
ities, more than 40 % of stroke survivors are left with
cognitive impairment after the event and almost two
thirds are affected by mild cognitive impairment, and
therefore are at risk of developing dementia [5]. Besides
having a direct influence on the quality of life of patients
and their caregivers, cognitive impairment after stroke is
also associated with higher mortality [6] and greater
rates of institutionalization [7]. Cognition is important
for overall recovery since its impairment reduces a per-
son’s ability to plan and initiate self-directed activities, to
solve problems, to sustain and divide attention, to
memorize information and to understand task instruc-
tions. It has been shown that recovery of cognitive func-
tion of stroke patients in inpatient rehabilitation is
directly related to their level of participation in rehabili-
tation activities [8]. Thus, reducing the impact of post
stroke cognitive impairment through appropriate re-
habilitation programs is an essential goal.
Current cognitive rehabilitation practice tends to be
directed towards isolated cognitive domains including
attention (focusing, shifting, dividing or sustaining), ex-
ecutive functions (planning, inhibition, control), visuo-
spatial ability (visual search, drawing, construction),
memory (recall and recognition of visual and verbal in-
formation) and language (expressive and receptive) [9].
Although there is evidence on the efficacy of current
methods [10], an important concern is how effectively
the improvements of these abilities that are trained sep-
arately generalize, leading to sustained improvement in
everyday functioning [11, 12]. When we consider the
cognitive domains required for activities of daily living
(ADL’s) such as a successful meal preparation – the pa-
tient must define a menu, identify the needed ingredi-
ents, write a shopping list, organize the time for
shopping and preparing the meal – we acknowledge that
multiple dimensions of cognition are engaged and,
thereby, suggesting that need to be rehabilitated as a
whole as opposed to independently [13]. Unfortunately,
there is insufficient evidence to determine if and how
the ecological validity of current cognitive rehabilitation
methods impacts recovery [14, 15].
Current cognitive rehabilitation methodologies suffer
other limitations besides the generalization of improve-
ments to functional activities, social participation and
life satisfaction. For instance, it is known that an inten-
sive and individualized training is preferable [16]. Per-
sonalized rehabilitation involves an assessment of each
patient’s impairments, a definition of attainable goals for
improvement, an intervention to assist in the achieve-
ment of goals and, finally, a reassessment to measure
improvements [2]. However, in-depth patient assessment
is expensive and time consuming, and currently imprac-
ticable due to the scarcity of professionals and resources,
resulting in a suboptimal intensity, personalization and
duration of rehabilitation interventions [17]. Further, al-
though there is growing evidence that patients may
achieve improvements on functional tasks even many
months after having a stroke [18], most rehabilitation
therapies are only guaranteed within three to 6 months
post stroke [19]. Additionally, a James Lind Alliance
study [20] interviewed 799 chronic stroke patients who
reported that cognitive problems had not been addressed
appropriately, especially when compared with mobility,
confirming that it is essential to find adaptable and ac-
cessible tools that can be used frequently and intensively
by patients at the clinic or at home after discharge, in
order to maximize rehabilitation outcomes. Caregivers
and health professionals were also interviewed and indi-
cated that investigating ways to improve cognition after
stroke should be a research priority [21].
Virtual Reality (VR) and interactive technologies have
emerged as a valuable approach in stroke rehabilitation
by providing the opportunity to practice cognitive and
motor activities that are not or cannot be usually prac-
ticed within the clinical environment, such as training
attention abilities in street crossing situations [22], ex-
ecutive functions by visiting a supermarket [23], or per-
forming simulations of real-life scenarios and activities
in urban virtual environments [24, 25]. Yet, the advan-
tages of VR to address stroke impairments go beyond
ecological validity of training, with a growing body of
evidence especially in the motor rehabilitation domain
[26]. Virtual environments are designed to be more en-
joyable than conventional rehabilitation methods. The
introduction of gaming elements and immediate feed-
back on performance enhance motivation, thereby en-
couraging
higher
numbers
of
repetitions
[27].
Additionally, it enables the systematic presentation of
stimulus and challenges in a hierarchical fashion, which
can be varied from simple to complex upon success [28],
making it progressively challenging according to patients
abilities. Further, when stroke survivors suffer of hemi-
paresis in their dominant arm, this interferes with their
ability to perform paper-and-pencil tasks, which in turn
may impede cognitive training. Thus, another central

 advantage of VR is the possibility to be integrated with
accessible interfaces such as adapted joysticks, natural
user interfaces or robotic systems [29].
Despite important scientific and engineering activity in
VR based systems for cognitive and motor rehabilitation,
the majority of studies to date have evaluated interven-
tions that were designed to address motor impairments.
According to the most recent Cochrane review [26],
there are only few randomized controlled studies that in-
clude cognitive rehabilitation and/or cognition assess-
ment. Kim and colleagues [30] performed a study with
USN patients, where 12 experimental group patients re-
ceived computer-based cognitive rehabilitation, includ-
ing IREX system® (Vivid group, Toronto, Canada), and
12 control group patients received only computer-based
cognitive rehabilitation with ComCog® (Maxmedica Inc.,
Seoul, Korea). Their results suggested that VR training
might be a beneficial therapeutic technique on USN in
stroke patients. Kim and colleagues [31] also investigated
the effect of VR on the recovery of cognitive impairment
in 28 stroke patients by comparing VR training with the
IREX system® to computer-based cognitive rehabilitation
with ComCog®. Results showed significant improve-
ments in both groups, with the VR group having greater
improvements in the attention domain. A study from
Chirivella and colleagues [32] had 12 stroke patients in a
stroke rehabilitation program using Neuro@Home, a
cognitive and motor software-based rehabilitation plat-
form. After an intervention of 8 weeks with 60 min ses-
sions focused in attention, working memory, executive
functions
and
visual
perception
training,
patients
showed significant improvements in attention, memory
or executive functions. More recently and, in a more
ADL’s simulation perspective, Gamito and colleagues
[33] tested the effectiveness of a VR application for
neuropsychological rehabilitation in a group of 20 stroke
patients. Results showed significant improvements in at-
tention and memory functions in the intervention group,
but not in the control group, not subject to any inter-
vention. Also in an ADL’s perspective, a pilot study from
Rand and colleagues [34] explored the potential of a vir-
tual supermarket (V-Mall) with 4 stroke patients. The
intervention entailed ten 60-min sessions and was fo-
cused on improving multitasking while the participant
was engaged in a virtual shopping task. Their main re-
sults support V-Mall potential as an effective tool for the
rehabilitation of post stroke multitasking deficits during
the performance of daily tasks. Most of these VR-based
interventions do not address cognitive deficits in an in-
tegrative manner [30, 32, 33], or are not ecologically
valid [30, 31]. The ADL’s simulation systems may repre-
sent a better real-world transfer rehabilitation, however,
these systems lack difficulty customization [33, 34]. The
AGATHE project developed a tool to suppress this
demand, offering patients customized rehabilitation ses-
sions through simulated ADL’s [25], however there are
no efficacy clinical trials with this tool. Overall, we can
conclude that results are encouraging but further re-
search is needed, especially to clarify if VR, and more
concretely training through the simulation of activities
of daily living, is equivalent or more effective than con-
ventional cognitive training [26].
In this paper we present a one-month clinical random-
ized controlled trial with 18 stroke patients: nine per-
forming a VR-based intervention and nine performing a
conventional intervention. The VR-based intervention
involves a virtual simulation of a city – the Reh@City –
where several activities of daily living are trained.
Reh@City
enables
an
integrative
and
personalized
cognitive rehabilitation process, targeting several cog-
nitive domains such as memory, attention, executive
functions and visuo-spatial abilities in a more ecologically
valid approach. Additionally, Reh@City makes the inter-
action with the virtual world accesible through its inter-
face, and the complexity of the scenarios is adapted to the
patients’ profile.
Methods
Participants
The selection of participants took place at the Nélio
Mendonça and João Almada Hospitals (Madeira Health
Service, Portugal). In total, we selected 18 out and inpa-
tients, based on the following inclusion criteria: no
hemi-spatial neglect as assessed by the clinicians with
the Line Bisection test [35]; capacity to be seated; ability
to read and write; minimum cognitive function as
assessed
by
the
Mini-Mental
State
Examination
(MMSE) ≥ 15 [36]; and motivation to participate in the
study. The Token Test [37] was used to identify and ex-
clude patients with moderate or severe language com-
prehension deficits. The study was approved by the
Madeira Health Service Ethical Committee (reference
number: 47/2013) and all the patients gave informed
consent previous to participation.
Protocol
The 18 patients were randomly assigned to two different
conditions: nine to the experimental group and nine to
the control group (Fig. 1), by a researcher not involved
in the
collection of the data, using the Research
Randomizer, a free web-based service that offers instant
random sampling and random assignment [38]. Both
groups
underwent
a
twelve-session
intervention,
of
20 min each session, distributed from 4 to 6 weeks. Pa-
tients assigned to the experimental group used, during
the training sessions under the supervision of a psych-
ologist, a VR-based simulation of ADL’s, the Reh@City.
The control group intervention involved time-matched

 cognitive training. Ideally, these participants should have
performed the same simulated ADL’s in the real-world
environment, as previously done in similar studies [39].
However, in addition to the logistics that could not be
supported in this study (insurance and transportation
outside the clinical environment), in this clinical popula-
tion motor impairments would interfere with the tasks
accomplishments and unsuccessful actions could be a
result of motor instead of cognitive deficits. For this rea-
son, and consistent with the current cognitive rehabilita-
tion exercises at the study hospitals, patients performed
puzzles, calculus, problem resolution and shape sorting
involving the training of executive functions, visuo-
spatial abilities, attention and memory, under the super-
vision of their occupational therapist.
Simulation of ADL’s with the Reh@City
Paper and pencil tasks allow a very specific intervention in
one or several cognitive domains but they lack ecological
validity. In an attempt to address this limitation, our VR-
based cognitive intervention consisted of a simulation of a
city – Reh@City: a three-dimensional environment with
streets, sidewalks, commercial buildings, parks and mov-
ing cars [40]. Because we are dealing with patients of gen-
erally older age and low computer literacy, the city was
designed to have only square or rectangular building
blocks and regular street intersections. This arrangement
helps in memorizing the number of turns to get to a des-
tination, and allows a more precise control of task
difficulty.
Reh@City provides an integrative cognitive training
experience where patients are required to accomplish
some common ADL’s in four frequently visited places: a
supermarket, a post office, a bank, and a pharmacy. To
help the patient relate the VR tasks to the real world,
these places display billboards and products of real
spaces and trademarks commonly found in Portugal.
When a task is given, the goal’s optimal path is displayed
on a general map highlighted in green. The Reh@City
can be configured to provide a mini-map in the lower
half of the screen and/or a guidance arrow (Fig. 2),
which allows increasing, or decreasing the visuo-spatial
orientation demands involved in the navigation task. If
needed, the patient can press a help button to recall the
task instructions and have access again to the task map.
Visual feedback elements, such as time and point coun-
ters, are used to give feedback on the accomplishment of
the task objectives as well as to reward successful actions
(Fig. 2). Points are accumulated at each objective com-
pletion (+20) and at each intermediate task (+1), and
points are subtracted (−1) whenever a mistake is per-
formed or a help button is used.
Attention training tasks bridge traditional paper and
pencil cancellation tasks (where patients need to cross
out target elements among distractors) and real tasks
(where target and distractors are embedded in a real 3D
environment). The implementation of the supermarket,
the pharmacy and the post-office enables full control
over the elements that determine the difficulty of train-
ing (number of targets, number of distractors and spatial
arrangement of the grid). The list of tasks located in the
up-right screen corner supports the patient by displaying
the current objective and recently completed objectives.
By removing the list we require the patient to memorize
the sequence of tasks to perform. Further, the Reh@City
targets executive functions by defining objectives that
the patient needs to accomplish by using problem reso-
lution, planning and reasoning skills (Table 1).
Accessibility
The navigation in the city is three-dimensional but the
arrangement in the different locations, such as shelves
and cash machine (Fig. 3a and b) are two dimensional to
facilitate the selection of targets and to avoid motor dif-
ficulties in the interaction with hyper-realistic scenarios.
Since most stroke patients have motor impairments, the
navigation within the virtual environment was made
through a joystick handle with only one button for “se-
lection” and one for “help”. This simplified interface fa-
cilitates the learning process for those who never used a
computer. A pilot study of the Reh@City prototype for a
single session with 10 stroke patients [40] revealed a
good level of usability (M = 77 %) as assessed through
the System Usability Scale [41].

 Difficulty gradation and task personalization
Besides
defining
incrementally
objectives
with
in-
creased complexity (for instance “Go to the Super-
market
and
buy
what
is
needed
for
breakfast”)
(Table 1), we employed a method of fading cues: the
Decreasing Assistance (DA) [42]. Following this meth-
odology, in the first sessions the patient is immedi-
ately given all the cues available: mini-map; direction
arrow and objectives list. The training continues with
all the cues until correct performance is achieved on
three consecutive sessions. On the following trial the
cues supporting the well-succeeded actions are re-
moved: if the patient easily navigates in the city, the
direction arrow is removed; if the patient rapidly lo-
cates the places, the mini-map is removed; and if the
patient correctly performs the objectives, the list is
removed. If at any time the patient fails to produce
the correct response, the cues are re-introduced until
the performance is successful again.
Reh@City implementation and setup
Reh@City was implemented using the Unity 3D game
engine (Unity Technologies, San Francisco, USA). The
experimental setup consisted of a desktop computer
running Windows 7 (CPU: Intel core 2 duo, RAM: 4Gb)
with a 24” LCD monitor. For the study an arcade type of
joystick was used (Topway’s Digiusb Joystick Tp-usb670,
China) with 2 customized colored buttons correspond-
ing to the in-game actions “selection” and “help”.
Neuropsychological assessment instruments
The same psychologist who supervised the experimental
intervention assessed all participants for the trained cog-
nitive domains before and after the interventions with a
battery consisting of four neuropsychological instru-
ments, with normative information available to indicate
domain-specific deficits.
The primary outcome measure was the global cogni-
tive functioning as assessed through the Addenbrooke
Fig. 2 Three-dimensional street view of Reh@City. In a first-person navigation, users are given goal instructions supported with a mini-map indicating
the optimal path (green line and arrow). Time and point counters are used to provide feedback on performance

 Cognitive Examination (ACE) [43], which has good sensi-
tivity (83 %) and specificity (73 %) for MCI after transient
ischemic attack and stroke [44]. The ACE is built around
the shell of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
[45] but assesses a wider range of cognitive functions. The
application of the instrument takes 20 to 30 min and as-
sesses attention and orientation, memory, verbal fluency,
language and visuo-spatial abilities. Additionally, it pro-
vides the MMSE score, which was used as exclusion cri-
teria for patients with severe cognitive deficits.
As secondary outcome measures, we had detailed atten-
tion and executive functioning assessments. To assess at-
tention we used the Trail Making Test A and B (TMT A
and B) [46], a very popular neuropsychological test that pro-
vides information on visual search, visual scanning, selective
and divided attention, processing speed, mental flexibility,
and also executive functioning. In part A, circles numbered
from 1 to 25 needs to be connected in numerical order. In
part B, numbers from 1 to 13 and letters from A to L need
to be connected alternating numbers and letters in ascend-
ing order. To specifically assess executive functions we
used the Picture Arrangement test from the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III) [47]. This task con-
sists of 11 sets of picture cards, presented in a standard
mixed-up order, and the participant has to rearrange these
to create a logical story within the specified time limit. It re-
quires perceptual organization, sequencing, verbal compre-
hension and planning skills, as well as social knowledge.
Also, as a secondary outcome measure we had the sub-
jective general health status, as assessed by the Stroke Im-
pact Scale 3.0 (SIS 3.0), a self-reported questionnaire that
functionally assesses 8 domains: motor strength, hand
function, ADL’s, mobility (which are aggregated in the
physical domain), communication, emotion, memory, and
social participation [48]. The SIS 3.0 also includes patient’s
subjective assessment on the perception of recovery since
their stroke on a visual analog scale of 0 to 100, with 0
meaning no recovery and 100 meaning full recovery. In-
ternal consistency and test-retest reliability of the SIS 3.0
domains ranges between 0.79 and 0.98 [49].
Both pre and post assessment moments had an approxi-
mate duration of 60 min. At the end of the VR-based inter-
vention we additionally used the System Usability Scale
(SUS) [41], to assess satisfaction and usability with the
Reh@City system. Final scores for the SUS can range from
0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better usability: 90s
is exceptional, 80s is good and 70s is acceptable [50]. The
questionnaire is technology agnostic, making it flexible
enough to assess a wide range of interface technologies.
Data analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS soft-
ware (version 20, SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA). As criter-
ion for significance we used a α of 0.05. Normality of
data was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
test. As some data were not normally distributed, non-
parametric tests were used to evaluate the inter-group
and intra-group differences. The Wilcoxon signed-rank
test (W) was used to analyze the within group changes
over time, while the two-tailed Mann-Whitney (MW)
test was used to compare the between-group differences
from baseline to the end of the study. No corrections for
multiple comparisons were performed.
Results
According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, data
were normally distributed in both groups for age
(KSExperimental = .156, p = .200; KSControl = .196, p = .200) and
in the control group for years of schooling (KSExperimental
= .394, p = .001; KSControl = .267, p = .063). Data were not
normally distributed for gender, lesion location and months
post-stroke. No differences between groups were found
with the Mann-Withney test (Table 2).
Concerning the neuropsychological assessment mea-
sures at baseline, data were normally distributed in both
groups for ACE (KSExperimental = .218, p = .200; KSControl
= .185, p = .200) and only in the control group for the
TMT A time (KSExperimental = .390, p < .001; KSControl
= .169, p = .200) and the Picture Arrangement test
(KSExperimental = .371, p = .001; KSControl = .240, p = .143).

 Data were also normally distributed in both groups
for the subjective general health status for the mem-
ory (KSExperimental = .227, p = .200; KSControl = .122, p
= .200), emotion (KSExperimental = .254, p = .096; KSControl
= .147, p = .200), communication (KSExperimental = .151, p

ery

distribution only in the control group (KSExperimental
= .299, p = .020; KSControl = .149, p = .200).
Global cognitive functioning
Table 3 describes the global cognitive functioning, as
assessed by the ACE, of both groups in the pre and post
intervention assessments. A Wilcoxon test for within-
groups differences revealed that only the experimental
group presented significant statistical improvements be-
tween pre and post assessment moments in both ACE
(W(9) = 44.000, Z = −2.549, p = .011, r = .85) and MMSE
(W(9) = 34.000, Z = −2.246, p = .025, r = .75). Additionally,
we also have found significant improvements in atten-
tion (W(9) = 28.000, Z = −2.375, p = .018, r = .79), mem-
ory (W(9) = 28.000, Z = −2.384, p = .017, r = .79) and
visuo-spacial ability (W(9) = 28.000, Z = −2.388, =.017,
r = .80) domains only in the experimental group. Con-
cerning the control group, the only significant change
was a decline in verbal fluency (W(9) = 2.500, Z =
−2.209, p = .027, r = .74).
A Mann-Whitney test indicated that the experimen-
tal group improved, significantly more than the con-
trol group, in terms of general cognitive functioning,
as assessed by ACE (U = 13.500, Z = −2.388, p = .014,
r = .56) and MMSE (U = 18.000, Z = −1.996, p = .050,
r = .47). The experimental group presented also sig-
nificantly higher scores in the attention domain (U =
17.000, Z = −2.066, p = .040, r = .49). We also found
significant differences between groups in the fluency task
(U = 13.000, Z = −2.487, p = .014, r = .59) with improve-
ments in the experimental group and decline in the control
group. There were no differences between groups for
memory (U = 23.000, Z = −1.578, p = 136, r = .37), language
(U = 32.500, Z = −.713, p = 489, r = .17) and visuo-spatial
(U = 26.500, Z = −1.263, p = .222, r = .30) domains.
Attention
Table 4 describes the TMT A and TMT B performance
for both groups, in terms of errors and completion time,
pre and post intervention. No within group differences
were identified by comparing the time to completion of
the TMT A test in the experimental (W(9) = 16.500, Z =
−.711, p = .477, r = .24) and control (W(9) = 17.500, Z =
−1.153, p = .249, r = .38) groups, nor were there differ-
ences for the number of errors in the experimental
(W(9) = 1.000, Z = −1.089, p = .276, r = .36) and control
(W(9) = 5.000, p = −1.190, p = .234, r = .40) groups. Con-
sistently for the TMT B, there were no differences for

5.000, Z = −1.153, p = .249, r = .38) and the control (W(9)
= 3.000, Z = −1.572, p = .116, r = .52) groups, as well as
differences in the number of errors in the experimental
group (W(9) = .000, Z = −1.890, p = .059, r = .63). How-
ever, we found differences in the control group (W(9)
= .000, Z = −2.060, p = .039, r = .69).
For the TMT A, both groups took less time to
complete the post intervention test but with no signifi-
cant differences between groups (U = 39.000, Z = −.132,
p = .931, r = .03). For the TMT B, the experimental group
took less time to completion when comparing to the
control group, although this difference was not signifi-
cant. There were no significant between group differ-
ences for the number of errors for both TMT A (U =
40.000, Z = .047, p = 1, r = .01) and TMT B (U = 35.500,
Z = −.482, p = .666, r = .11).
Executive functions
Table 4 describes the Picture Arrangement test perform-
ance for both groups pre and post intervention. In this
executive functioning test, we have found significant dif-
ferences within the experimental (W(9) = 21.000, Z =
−2.232, p = .026, r = .74) but not within the control
(W(9) = 2.000, Z = −.447, p = .655, r = .15) group. There
was a tendency to significance for the experimental
group to have better performance, when compared to
the control, at the end of the intervention (U = 19.500,
Z = −2.042, p = .063, r = .24).

groups in the strenght, mobility, hand function, ADL’s,
memory, emotion, communication, social participation,
and overall recovery dimensions of the SIS.
Usability
Although only 3 out of 9 participants from the experi-
mental group had previous computer experience, there
was a good acceptance of the system with no reported
problems in the execution of the VR task. Observational
information and subjective statements from the partici-
pants were consistent with the SUS scores, which re-
ported good levels of usability and satisfaction for the
Reh@City (Mdn = 80/100, IQR = 75–87.5).
Discussion
In the past several VR systems have been developed for
brain injury rehabilitation, some of which were devel-
oped but not field tested [24, 25] or have only gone
through studies with a small number of participants
and/or without control groups [23, 32, 51]. Most of the
existing randomized controlled trials with VR-based cog-
nitive rehabilitation, focus in specific cognitive domains,
as memory [52, 53] and attention [33], or specific defi-
cits, as USN [22, 30]. Instead, Reh@City was developed
to target the rehabilitation of multiple cognitive domains
simultaneously requiring the execution of daily routines
in progressive levels of cognitive complexity. Our study,
besides its limitations, is the first randomized controlled
trial

 rehabilitation in an ecologically valid context could be
more effective than conventional training.
Comparing VR and control interventions, in terms
of global cognitive functioning, as assessed with the
ACE and the MMSE, only the experimental group
improved significantly from pre to post-intervention.
These significant improvements were also verified in
the between-groups analysis. We have found signifi-
cant improvements in attention, memory and visuo-
spatial abilities for the experimental group. Attention
and
memory
improvements
are
consistent
with
a
study from Gamito and colleagues [33], which com-
pared a VR-based intervention (ADL’s simulations tar-
geting
attention
and
memory)
with
conventional
rehabilitation.
The
visuo-spatial
improvements
are
consistent with Kim and colleagues [30] study, which
compared a VR-based intervention with a computer-
based
intervention
in
USN.
Considering
executive
functions, our control group had a significant decline
in verbal fluency from pre to post intervention. The
Picture Arrangement Test specifically assessed prob-
lem resolution and processing speed and its results
revealed a pre to post intervention improvement only
in the experimental group, which we consider a very
promising result for further research.
The assessment of processing speed and attention with
the TMT A and B revealed only a significant difference
in the reduction of the number of errors, from pre to
post intervention in the performance of the TMT B, in
the control group. This result is not consistent with the
other assessments and with previous studies, which
found significant attention improvements, only in the
experimental group [31]. The fact that this test is highly
influenced by schooling [54] and that our sample had
few years of education might explain the persistence of
low
performance
in
this
test
from
pre
to
post
assessment.
Besides cognition, we assessed the intervention’s im-
pact in the multiple domains of health and life with the
SIS 3.0. Self-reported data revealed that the experimental
group improved significantly in the physical domain,
namely strength and mobility, memory, emotion, social
participation and overall recovery. Instead, the control
group decreased in the physical domain and only im-
proved in memory, mobility and social participation.
Nevertheless, no differences between groups were identi-
fied. There are CID’s cut-offs for SIS 3.0 motor dimen-
sions (strength = 9.2; ADL’s = 5.9; mobility = 4.5; hand
function = 17.8) [55] and both groups’ improvements
were clinically important for strength, ADL’s and mobil-
ity. These findings are especially relevant because our
VR intervention targeted cognitive aspects but also im-
proved the physical domain, more specifically motor
strength, and the emotional condition of patients, as well
as their own perception of overall recovery after stroke.
Finally, the interaction with the our system was reported
as very positive, with high levels of engagement and mo-
tivation, which is important to enhance adherence to
treatment. The good usability and satisfaction scores ob-
tained with the SUS confirmed these observations.
Despite the positive impact, some limitations of our
study must be considered when interpreting the results.
Concerning the sample, eighteen participants can be
considered a small number, though it is comparable with
previous similar interventions [31, 33]. In addition, there
was heterogeneity between groups, especially related to
time post-stroke. Although the experimental group was
more chronic than the control, this difference was not
statistically significant. The dosing of 4 h was of low in-
tensity, and therefore might have not been sufficient to
achieve greater or measurable improvements in both
groups. Intervention duration of similar previous studies
range from 6 to 18 h distributed in sessions of 30 to
60 min, 3 to 5 times a week [30–34]. Furthermore, the
intervention was not blind since the same person per-
formed the assessment and the intervention. Regarding
the cognitive assessment, there might have been learning
effects of the tools since none of them have parallel ver-
sions for multiple assessments. Yet, even if a learning ef-
fect existed, this would apply to both intervention and
control groups and the comparison would still be valid.
Nevertheless there are not established clinically import-
ant differences (CID’s) for the cognitive assessment
tools, through the improvement scores from pre to post-
intervention we can conclude that Reh@City, being it
designed to address attention, memory, visuo-spatial
abilities and executive functions, revealed to be more ef-
fective for cognitive rehabilitation than our control inter-
vention.
Although
it
would
be
relevant
to
have
complementary information with a real-world assess-
ment in a supermarket, pharmacy, post-office and bank,
unfortunately this required logistics that could not be
implemented for this study. In addition, the main object-
ive was to clinically assess the impact of the Reh@City
as a cognitive rehabilitation tool and not necessarily to
assess the extent of transfer from VR to actual ADLs.
Conclusions
This study examined the effectiveness of Reh@City in
comparison to conventional methods. Overall, the re-
sults of this one-month longitudinal study have revealed
that, cognitive rehabilitation through an ecologically
valid VR system can have a larger impact than conven-
tional methods. Reh@City showed similar functional
impact as the conventional methods and larger improve-
ments in general cognitive functioning. Our results con-
tribute
with
new
evidence
and
provide
further
understanding on the impact of using simulations of

 ADL’s in the rehabilitation of cognitive deficits. Never-
theless there is still a need of further research consider-
ing other clinical populations, larger sample sizes and
more comparative studies. Hence, a comparison of an
improved version of this VR system with a comprehen-
sive paper-and-pencil cognitive training, using a greater
number of patients is taking place.
