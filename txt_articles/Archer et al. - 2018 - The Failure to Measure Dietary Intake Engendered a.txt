Controversies regarding the putative health effects of dietary sugar, salt, fat, and
cholesterol are not driven by legitimate differences in scientific inference from valid
evidence, but by a fictional discourse on diet-disease relations driven by decades of
deeply flawed and demonstrably misleading epidemiologic research. Over the past 60
years, epidemiologists published tens of thousands of reports asserting that dietary
intake was a major contributing factor to chronic non-communicable diseases despite
the fact that epidemiologic methods do not measure dietary intake. In lieu of measuring
actual dietary intake, epidemiologists collected millions of unverified verbal and textual
reports of memories of perceptions of dietary intake. Given that actual dietary intake
and reported memories of perceptions of intake are not in the same ontological
category, epidemiologists committed the logical fallacy of “Misplaced Concreteness.”
This error was exacerbated when the anecdotal (self-reported) data were impermissibly
transformed (i.e., pseudo-quantified) into proxy-estimates of nutrient and caloric
consumption via the assignment of “reference” values from databases of questionable
validity and comprehensiveness. These errors were further compounded when
statistical analyses of diet-disease relations were performed using the pseudo-quantified
anecdotal data. These fatal measurement, analytic, and inferential flaws were obscured
when epidemiologists failed to cite decades of research demonstrating that the
proxy-estimates they created were often physiologically implausible (i.e., meaningless)
and had no verifiable quantitative relation to the actual nutrient or caloric consumption
of participants. In this critical analysis, we present substantial evidence to support
our contention that current controversies and public confusion regarding diet-disease
relations were generated by tens of thousands of deeply flawed, demonstrably
misleading, and pseudoscientific epidemiologic reports. We challenge the field of nutrition
to regain lost credibility by acknowledging the empirical and theoretical refutations of their
memory-based methods and ensure that rigorous (objective) scientific methods are used
to study the role of diet in chronic disease.

Fictional Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
INTRODUCTION
“In an honest search for knowledge, you quite often have to abide
by ignorance for an indefinite period. Instead of filing the gap by
guesswork...however irksome the gap may be, its obliteration by a
fake removes the urge to seek a tenable answer... The steadfastness
in [this obligation], nay in appreciating it as a stimulus and a
signpost to further quest, is a natural and indispensable disposition
in the mind of a scientist.” Erwin Schrodinger (1)
The Success of Nutrition Science
The science of diet-disease relations has a long, illustrious and
successful history dating to antiquity (2). One of the first clinical
trials ever conducted was an examination of the effects of
citrus fruits on scurvy in the eighteenth century (3). And since
that time, the science of nutrition achieved clinical and public
health successes that were unimaginable in the distant past. For
example, in the early twentieth century, diet-related diseases
such as beriberi, rickets, and goiter were major public health
challenges. In the United States (US), pellagra (a disease of niacin
deficiency) caused the death of more than 100,000 Americans and
afflicted more than 3 million (4). In New York City, 75% of all
infants and nearly 100% of African American children suffered
from rickets, a painful disease of vitamin D deficiency (5). Yet
by the turn of the twenty-first century, diet-related diseases were
almost non-existent and biochemical analyses demonstrated that
∼80% of Americans (aged ≥ 6 years) were not at risk of
deficiencies in any of the 7 vitamins examined (i.e., vitamins A,
B-6, B-12, C, D, and E) (6, 7); and almost 90 percent of women
of childbearing age (i.e., 12–49 years of age) were not at risk of
iron deficiency, while folate levels increased ∼50 percent since
1998 (6–8). Thus, the improvement of the US food supply and
the “American Diet” over the past century was one of the greatest
public health success stories in history (9).
Speculations and the Shift to Implausible Anecdotal
Evidence
By the mid- twentieth century, as diet-related diseases (e.g.,
scurvy, pellagra) and protein-energy malnutrition became
increasingly rare in industrialized nations, a small but influential
group of investigators began speculating that complex chronic
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were somehow causally
related to diet [e.g., see (10–14)] The evidence ostensibly
supporting these conjectures was inferred from epidemiologic
studies based on the naïve notion that a person’s usual dietary
intake (i.e., consumed foods and beverages) could be estimated
simply by asking what he or she remembered eating and drinking
(9, 15–17). Despite the fact that the data collected by these
memory-based dietary assessment methods (M-BMs) were non-
falsifiable anecdotes (i.e., verbal or textual self-reports) and were
repeatedly demonstrated to lack validity and reliability as far
back as the 1950s (18, 19), studies employing M-BMs came to
dominate the empiric, policy, and media landscapes (15–17, 20).
By the 1980s, tens of thousands of research reports based on
M-BMs were published and some of these publications became
the most highly-cited and widely publicized articles in the bio-
medical literature.
Nevertheless, six decades of rigorous and highly-replicated
research demonstrated unequivocally that M-BMs data were
physiologically implausible (i.e., meaningless numbers) (9, 15–
17, 21–25), often “incompatible with life,
” (26) and had trivial
relations to actual nutrient and caloric consumption (9, 15–17,
21–23, 26–44). For example, in 2013 we used multiple methods
to show that from 1971 to 2010, no human being could survive
on the average reported caloric intake in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (21). Furthermore,
when hypotheses derived from nutrition epidemiologic research
were tested using rigorous study designs, they failed to be
supported (45–49). For example, when over 50 nutrition claims
were examined, “100% of the observational claims failed to
replicate” and five conjectures were statistically significant “in the
opposite direction” (50). These authors further stated “the public
at large–are being deceived, and are being deceived in the name
of science. This should not be allowed to continue” (50). While
these authors wrote “The cause is elusive” (50), we showed that
the refutation of diet-related hypotheses was due to the failure
of nutrition epidemiologists to actually measure the variable of
interest: dietary-intake.
This failure, in concert with the fact that the diet-disease
associations did not meet Bradford Hill’s criteria for causation
(51), engendered a fictional discourse on the health effects of
sugar, salt, fat, and cholesterol. This fictional discourse was
widely disseminated by the popular press and exacerbated
by governmental and non-governmental health organizations,
and commercial interests (e.g., weight-loss industries and
manufacturers of “heart-healthy” foods). The wide-spread
publication of spurious diet-related speculations had significant
adverse public health consequences (15, 20) that included public
confusion (15, 52), regressive and misdirected public policy (20,
53, 54), the misallocation of research resources (9), scientifically
illiterate recommendations on sugar (15, 55), and potentially
harmful recommendations on salt (20, 56–60) that may have led
to “deaths due to hyponatremia” (20) p. 22.
Purpose of This Critical Analysis
Given the fictional discourse on diet-disease relations and
the escalating debate over the validity of M-BMs (16, 17,
61–64), the purpose of this critical analysis is to present
evidence that the current controversies regarding diet-disease
relations are not driven by legitimate differences in scientific
inference on the physiologic effects of dietary intake (i.e.,
consumed foods and beverages). Rather, we contend that current
confusion on the putative health effects of dietary sugar, salt,
fat, and cholesterol were engendered by a fictional discourse
on diet-disease relations created by deeply flawed, demonstrably
misleading, and pseudoscientific nutrition epidemiologic reports
(9, 15–17, 20, 21, 23, 55). Herein, we argue that the confusion
created by the fictional discourse and use of pseudoscientific
methods to inform public policy led to the field of nutrition
science losing credibility and scientific authority. Thus, to regain
the public’s trust, it is necessary for the field to acknowledge
the empirical and theoretical refutations of M-BMs and ensure
that in the future, rigorous scientific methods (e.g., randomized

control trials, RCTs) are used to study the role of diet in chronic
disease.
THE FATAL FLAWS OF NUTRITION
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND THE USE OF M-BMS
M-BMs, such as 24-h recall interviews (24 HR) and food
frequency questionnaires (FFQs), are the predominant protocols
in nutritional epidemiologic research. These methods continue
to be funded and employed despite several facts and 60+ years
of highly replicated, rigorous evidence that invalidate their use
(9, 16, 17). In this critical analysis, we present this evidence and
several arguments detailing the fatal flaws of M-BMs.
M-BMs Do Not Measure Dietary Intake
Most nutrition epidemiologists do not measure dietary intake
(i.e., consumed foods and beverages) or the nutrient and caloric
consumption of their participants. Instead, these investigators
use M-BMs to collect unverified self-reported memories of what
Willett in his popular textbook on nutritional epidemiology
called “perceptions of usual intake” (65) p.111. Stated simply,
the data collected via M-BMs are not quantitative estimates
of dietary intake, but are mere guesstimates of whatever the
respondents are willing and able to remember and report about
what they think they ate or drank in the past, or want the
investigators to think they consumed (9, 16, 17, 21, 23, 32, 37, 44).
Thus, because the information collected is founded exclusively
upon the respondent’s honesty, memory, willingness, and ability
to estimate and report past dietary intake (9, 15, 21, 23),
investigators have no control over the quality, quantity, or error
of the data collected via M-BMs.
Accordingly, there is a large disparity between anecdotal and
objective evidence of dietary intake (9, 16, 17, 21–23, 26–44, 62).
This disparity is largely explained by myriad intentional and non-
intentional distorting factors, such as reactivity, confabulation,
lying, forgetting, false memories, mis-estimation, and social
desirability (9, 23, 32, 37). In rigorous scientific fields such
as chemistry, biology, and physiology, anecdotal data are not
used, and uncorroborated self-reported data are considered
“inadmissible” as valid evidence (9). As such, we think that if
nutrition epidemiologists wish to regain lost credibility, the use of
M-BMs should be discontinued and not be used to inform public
policy (9, 15, 20, 23).
Ten Million Jelly-Beans: M-BMs Collect Numerically
Labeled Qualitative Data, Not Quantitative Data
Verbal and textual reports of dietary intake are numerically
labeled qualitative data (i.e., guesstimates). These data are not
quantitative measurements of dietary intake. For example, if
a person reports consuming ten million jelly beans, it should
be apparent that this guesstimate is not a quantitative measure
of actual food consumption but is merely a numerically
labeled qualitative report (i.e., an anecdote). This remains a
fact even if the person’s guesstimate is more plausible (e.g.,
50 jelly beans) because neither self-report was based on an
objective measurement protocol. Therefore, without objective
corroboration these “data” are not falsifiable and therefore must
be considered pseudo-scientific (9, 16, 17, 22, 23).
Human Memory and Recall Are Not Valid Tools for
Data Collection
Human memory and recall are not valid tools for scientific
data collection (9), and it is well-established that subjective
reports of past events (i.e., anecdotes) are not representative
of objective facts (9, 66–70). There is a vast body of evidence
demonstrating that “one fact stands out more than any of the
others—the very worthlessness of human testimony...” (71) p.13–
14. For example, after reviewing the validity of self-reported
data in nutrition, health-care, anthropology, communications,
criminal justice, economics, and psychology, over three decades
ago Bernard et al., concluded “on average, about half of what
informants report is probably incorrect...” (66).
Deception: People Lie When Asked to Report Their
Dietary Intake
Deception is an inherent part of human nature and the majority
of people intentionally misreport (i.e., lie) when reporting their
dietary intake (16, 17, 29, 30, 72). For example, when asked
to report their dietary intake, 78% of clinical and 64% of
non-clinical participants “declared an intention to misreport”
(37) p. 209. This is a common finding (39, 41, 72), yet
epidemiologists make no attempt to address the reality of
intentional misreporting in their research. This failure is a major
contributor to the fictional discourse on diet-disease relations
because the participants’ actual dietary intake is unknown and
what is reported may be “pure” fiction (73).
Reactivity: Participants Alter Behavior
It is well-established that participants alter their consumption
when asked to report their dietary intake (29, 31, 35, 37, 39, 41).
For example, when asked, participants offer socially desirable
reports based on current dogma, such as consuming less “fatty
foods...[and consuming more]...fruits and vegetables” (30) p.
792. This body of work unequivocally demonstrates that self-
reported dietary data are not representative of usual dietary
intake, and therefore contribute to the fictional discourse. Yet
more importantly, given that health-conscious participants are
more likely to engage in exercise, not smoke, and report their
dietary intake in a manner consistent with current dietary
dogma (e.g., eat more fruits and vegetables), current nutritional
epidemiologic studies simply reinforce past recommendations
without providing any information regarding the validity of
those recommendations. Defenders of M-BMs fail to grasp the
significance of this bias (i.e., dietary recommendations are a self-
fulfilling prophecy) and often cite the allegedly positive effects
of past dietary recommendations as support for the validity of
M-BMs [e.g., see (62, 74–76)].
Credulousness Is Antithetical to Scientific Data
Collection
It is unequivocal that a person’s reported memories of
perceptions of a past event are not an accurate qualitative or
quantitative representation of that event (68, 70, 77, 78). This

Fictional Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
reality, in confluence with the fact that people often misrepresent
their perceptions to influence the opinion of others, demonstrates
that reported memories of perceptions of consumed foods and
beverages are not valid. In a scathing critique of self-reported
data, Lewontin wrote, “It is frightening to think that...science is
in the hands of professionals so deaf to human nuance that they
believe that people do not lie...and that they have no interest in
manipulating the impression that strangers have of them” (79) p.
28. Nevertheless, nutrition epidemiologic investigators treat their
participant’s anecdotes (i.e., dietary self-reports) as accurate and
truthful despite voluminous evidence to the contrary (9, 16, 17,
21, 23). Thus, given that blind-faith is antithetical to scientific
data collection, the credulousness of epidemiologists, and their
failure to account for basic human behaviors (e.g., deception
and reactivity) were major drivers of the fictional discourse on
diet-disease relations.
M-BMs Are Founded Upon a “Category
Error” and the Logical Fallacy of
“Misplaced Concreteness”
Category Error and Incommensurability
A “Category Error” is an ontological mistake. The standard
exemplar is the conflation of abstract phenomena with physical
objects (80). Mental phenomena, such as memories and
perceptions, do not exist outside the mind of the perceiver
and therefore cannot be observed nor measured. Conversely,
physical objects (e.g., foods and beverages) exist independent
of the perceiver, and are therefore, observable, and potentially
measurable. Thus, actual dietary intake and memories of
perceptions of dietary intake are distinct and incommensurable
(i.e., nonequivalent) and a large body of rigorous evidence
demonstrated this non-equivalence (9, 21–23, 26–44, 62).
Thus, when employing M-BMs, nutrition epidemiologists are
attempting to “measure the unmeasurable” (16) and continue to
commit a fatal “Category Error” by erroneously assuming that
reported memories of “perceptions of usual intake” (65) p. 50 are
the equivalent of actual dietary intake.
Reification: “Misplaced Concreteness”
Reification is the fallacious practice of treating abstract entities
as if they were physical objects and is the behavioral extension
of a “Category Error.” For example, memories of perceptions of
dietary intake are mental phenomena about food and beverages
that may or may not have been consumed in the past (9, 68,
81). It should be obvious that these purely mental phenomena
do not, and cannot, contain nutrients or calories. Thus, when
epidemiologists assign nutrient and caloric values to memories of
perceptions of dietary intake they are “mistaking the abstract for
the concrete” (82) p. 73. Therefore, when verbal or textual reports
of memories of perceptions of dietary intake are presented as
estimates of actual intake or nutrient and caloric consumption,
these data are both pseudo-scientific and misleading (9, 20).
M-BMs Data Rely on
Pseudo-Quantification
Self-reported perceptions of consumed foods and beverages are
not estimates of nutrient or caloric consumption. Therefore,
statistical analyses of diet-disease relations require the creation
of proxy-estimates of nutrient and caloric consumption via the
post-hoc assignment of reference nutrient and energy values
to the verbal or textual reports. This process is known as
pseudo-quantification because it transforms qualitative (i.e.,
nominal/anecdotal) self-reports into quantitative (i.e., ratio)
data via the assignment of numerals. As will be discussed
in the following section, pseudo-quantification differs from
scientific measurement because measurement is the discovery,
not assignment of numeric relations (83–85).
Pseudo-Quantification: The Converse of Scientific
Measurement
Scientific measurement is the empirical process of discovery
in which a known unit of an observable phenomenon (e.g., a
milligram of Vitamin C) is compared to the magnitude (i.e.,
amount) of that unit in an observable entity (e.g., an orange).
The mere assignment of numerals is not the scientific equivalent
of measurement because the assigned number may or may
not have an empirically supported relation to the observed
entity (83, 84). Nevertheless, rather than measuring the actual
consumption of participants, epidemiologic investigators merely
assign “reference” nutrient and caloric values to self-reported
foods and beverages to create proxy-estimates of consumption.
This process of pseudo-quantification is literally the converse of
scientific measurement because the actual nutrient and caloric
consumption of the participants are never “discovered” and
remain unknown.
Impermissible Transformation: Nominal Data +
Assigned Numerals �= Quantitative Data
Valid inferences on diet-disease relations necessitate measuring
both
consumed
foods
and
beverages,
and
concomitant
nutrient and caloric intake. M-BMs measure neither. The
mere assignment of numerals to anecdotal evidence does not
transform the qualitative (nominal) reports into quantitative
(ratio) data. Thus, the process of pseudo-quantification is the
impermissible transformation of incommensurable phenomena
(i.e., converting abstractions into concrete entities). As described
in the prior “Jelly-Bean” example, numerically labeled verbal
or textual reports are not the equivalent of quantitative data
obtained from measurement protocols. As such, there is no
verifiable relation between the dietary reports and the actual
foods and beverage consumed. More importantly, given the
lack of validity and comprehensiveness of nutrient databases (as
discussed below), there are no verifiable relations between the
assigned nutrient and caloric values and the actual nutrient and
caloric consumption of the participant. These fatal conceptual
and measurement flaws explain why the tens of millions of
extremely precise proxy-estimates created by epidemiologists
over the past six decades were repeatedly demonstrated to
be physiologically implausible (i.e., meaningless numbers)
(9, 21, 23–25).
Nutrient Database Issues
The databases used for the pseudo-quantification of FFQs and
24HRs, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), contain <8,000 unique foods (86). Yet it
was estimated that more than 85,000 unique items exists in the
Frontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org
4
November 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 105
 Archer et al.
Fictional Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
ever-expanding US food supply (86) and over 200,000 unique
food codes were published in the US Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) Food Composition Databases (24, 87). Thus, given that
FFQs collect “a finite list of foods/portions with little detail” (62)
p. 2 and include only 75–200 items, it is highly unlikely that the
extremely precise nutrient and caloric values assigned to FFQ
or 24HR data are representative of what was actually consumed
(16, 17, 24, 25). Given these facts, both FFQs and 24-HRs lack
face validity (16, 17).
Importantly,
unlike
the
standard
coefficients
used
in
chemistry, standardized reference nutrient or caloric values
for foods and beverages do not exist. Inherent variability
and the “rapidly changing landscape of the food supply” (86)
prevent the creation and publication of accurate reference
values. For example, variation in farming practices (e.g., seed
and soil quality), as well as time, temperature, and other
changes induced via storage and processing (e.g., cooking),
and industry reformulations render the accuracy and reliability
of published reference values uncertain, if not wholly invalid
(86, 88, 89). For example, Merchant et al. stated, “there may
be large discrepancies in nutrient content of foods between
the USDA database and what is found in the field because of
manufacturing practices,” (90) p. 7 and Phillips et al., stated,
“Reliable methods are simply not currently available for some
components in all foods (e.g., folate, Vitamin D)” (91) p. 1354.
Similarly, Deharveng et al. stated, “...due to the high natural
variation in foods...[and]...the use of several sources which
may mean that the nutritional values are not comparable within
the same table...[and] “common methods and definitions...or
modes of expression (energy, protein, carbohydrates, carotenes,
vitamin A and E) have not yet been agreed upon, so values are
not comparable [between or within databases, and there are]
...values produced over 20 years ago with outdated analytical
methods” (92) p.60. Moreover, there are numerous nutrient
databases with varying degrees of accuracy (e.g., incorrect
values) and completeness (e.g., missing values) (86, 88, 90, 92–
99), and the investigators’ choice of database affects results
and conclusions (89, 91, 92, 100). As Natarajan et al., wrote,
“self-report measures could be strongly biased by the inherent
errors in the nutrient databases’ ability to estimate true...intake”
(100) p. 776.
These results demonstrate there can be no standardized
or valid “reference” caloric and nutrient values. As such, the
pseudo-quantification of self-reported memories, digital images
of foods and beverages, or other recent advances [e.g., “eating”
sensors and instrumented utensils (101)] offer no valid or
verifiable quantitative information on the actual caloric or
nutrient consumption of participants. Therefore, there are no
valid nutrient and energy data from which to examine diet-
disease relations. Thus, pseudo-quantification is a major driver of
both the implausibility of M-BM data and the fictional discourse
on diet-disease relations.
Implausible Proxy-Estimates of Nutrient
and Energy Consumption
The process of pseudo-quantification does not produce accurate
or even believable proxy-estimates of nutrient or caloric
consumption. Six decades of rigorous research demonstrated
unequivocally that the proxy-estimates created by investigators
were
often
physiologically
implausible
(i.e.,
meaningless
numbers), (9, 21, 23–25) “incompatible with life” (26) p.
347, and have trivial relations to actual nutrient and caloric
consumption (9, 21–23, 26–44, 62). For example, severe,
systematic, and intentional under- and over-reporting of
specific foods and beverages (e.g., sugar, vegetables, alcohol),
and absolute caloric and nutrient consumption (e.g., protein,
sodium) are omnipresent (9, 21–23, 26–44, 62). These highly-
replicated results demonstrate that any conclusions regarding
diet-disease relations inferred from M-BM-based research are
not valid.
The Non-quantifiability of Measurement
Error
Falsifiability: Discerning Fact From Fiction
The discrimination between scientific and pseudoscientific
(i.e., non-falsifiable) data is contingent upon the ability
to
discern
fact
from
fiction.
To
accomplish
this
task
in
nutrition,
it
is
first
necessary
to
ascertain
if
the
reported
foods
and
beverages
match
the
respondent’s
actual intake; and second, it is necessary to quantify the
disparity between the proxy-estimates created via pseudo-
quantification and the respondent’s actual caloric and nutrient
consumption.
Thus, accurate estimations of the types and amounts
of consumed foods and beverages is required. Yet, as we
demonstrated previously (9), this is not possible because
“without objective corroboration it is impossible to quantify what
percentage of the recalled foods and beverages are completely
false, grossly inaccurate, or somewhat congruent with actual
consumption” (9) p. 919 and “neither the researchers nor the
participants know the validity or reliability of the reported food
and beverage consumption...” (9) p. 918. Similarly, it is not
possible to quantify the disparity between the proxy-estimates
of nutrient and caloric consumption and the respondent’s
actual consumption because the nutrient and caloric intakes
of participants were never measured; these values were merely
assigned to the reported foods and beverages. Importantly, the
errors in the original verbal or textual reports will be propagated
unpredictably via pseudo-quantification in a non-quantifiable
manner. This renders the final estimates of nutrient and
caloric consumption essentially meaningless. Thus, statements
that 24 HR, “have known measurement errors...” (102) p.
922 and that 24HR data can be “adjusted for total energy
[to] reduce measurement error” (103) p. 2552 are false and
contribute to the ongoing fictional discourse on diet-disease
relations.
In summary, M-BMs cannot estimate the participants’ true
consumption of foods and beverages. Therefore, the participants’
actual nutrient and caloric intake are unknown and unknowable;
and because the measurement error associated with M-BMs is
non-quantifiable and non-falsifiable, self-reported dietary data
are inadmissible as scientific evidence (9, 23). Thus, six decades
of statistical analyses of pseudo-quantified (i.e., reified) dietary
anecdotes were a major contributor of the fictional discourse on
diet-disease relations (15–17, 55).

Fictional Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
MISLEADING PUBLICATIONS AND THE
FICTIONAL DISCOURSE ON DIET-DISEASE
RELATIONS
Failure to Cite Contrary Evidence
Over the past six decades, epidemiologists published tens of
thousands of research reports in which millions of self-reported
memories of perceptions of dietary intake were presented
as the equivalent of data on the actual dietary intake of
participants. Nevertheless, and despite a century of research
from multiple domains (e.g., psychology, sociology, and cognitive
neuroscience) demonstrating that this presentation was patently
false and misleading (9, 16, 17, 66–70), epidemiologists often
failed to cite, acknowledge or address the overwhelming contrary
evidence.
For example, in 2013, we demonstrated via multiple methods
that over the past five decades the average caloric intake
reported in the NHANES could not support human life (21)
and that >40% of NHANES participants’ reported caloric intakes
were below the level needed to support a comatose patient’s
survival (9, 21, 23, 104). Yet despite the clear refutations and
empirically supported rebukes of M-BMs, the 2015 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) (105) falsely wrote
that the implausible NHANES data, “provide national and
group level estimates of dietary intakes of the U.S. population,
on a given day...” (105) Part C, p 13, Similarly, the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA) presented these implausible
(i.e., meaningless) NHANES dietary data as “Current Eating
Patterns in the United States.” (106) Chapter 2.
Furthermore, 80% of the studies in the US Department
of Agriculture’s National Evidence Library (107) used by the
2015 DGAC to establish the DGA employed M-BMs. We
contend that the unremitting use of this large body of refuted
evidence in concert with the failure to cite or even acknowledge
contrary evidence exacerbated the fictional discourse and led
to the “Disease-Mongering of the American Diet” (108) and the
“demonization” of dietary sugar (15, 55). For example, despite
biochemical analyses demonstrating that the vast majority of
Americans were not at risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies
(7), the 2015 DGAC report stated that “several nutrients are
underconsumed”18(PartA,p20) (i.e., vitamins A, C, D, E, and
folate) and that for women of childbearing age, “iron also is
a shortfall nutrient.”18(PartA,p2). Clearly Americans could not
have adequate serum levels (as demonstrated by biochemical
analyses), if these vitamins and minerals were “underconsumed.”
The reason for the apparent underconsumption of minerals
and vitamins was the well-established fact that self-reported
dietary intakes are severely and systematically under-reported
via M-BMs. Thus, by failing to acknowledge the existence of
contrary biochemical data and reporting only the implausible
NHANES M-BM data, the 2015 DGAC presented a false and
alarmist perspective on the nutritional status of Americans. This
misleading presentation was an exemplar of “disease-mongering”
(15, 108) because it distorted the scientific record and misled
both the public and policy makers by erroneously suggesting that
Americans were at risk for nutritional deficiencies when objective
evidence demonstrated they were not (15, 55).
More
recently,
the
National
Academies
of
Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine examined the process by which
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans were created. Their report,
“Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans” (109) was ostensibly intended to review the
ongoing controversy surrounding the rigor and validity of the
evidence employed. Nevertheless, the authors failed to cite
any of our numerous peer-reviewed publications refuting the
validity of the NHANES dietary data, and in direct opposition to
extant evidence, the authors of the report wrote, “After extensive
evaluation, we found that the current methods being used in
the DGA process...are indeed appropriate” (109) p. x; Preface
[and] “Self-report dietary intake [M-BMs] data are central to
the development of dietary guidelines” (109) p. 4–13. Thus, by
summarily excluding our large body of contrary evidence and
failing to inform readers of the empiric, theoretic and conceptual
refutations of their methods and data, the National Academies
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine exacerbated the fictional
discourse on the putative health effects of dietary sugar, salt,
fat, and cholesterol. This biased presentation has significant
public-health consequences (e.g., public confusion, ineffective,
and regressive public policy, and misallocation of research
resources) (9, 15, 20).
Recent Contributions to the Fictional
Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
Most recently, the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology published a
series of “Controversy and Debate” articles on the “Fatal Flaws of
Food Frequency Questionnaires...” (16, 17, 63, 64). In our target
paper (17), we presented a number of very specific challenges
to the status quo in nutrition epidemiology. Nevertheless, our
esteemed opponents in the debate failed to address the issues and
chose to offer mere ipse dixit statements and fallacious arguments
(e.g., ignoratio elenchi, ad hominems, ad populum) (63, 64). Thus,
in our closing statement we wrote that improving nutrition
science and public health policy will be achieved only if the
epidemiologic research community acknowledges and addresses
contrary evidence and empirical refutations (16).
CHALLENGES AND RELEVANCY OF
ESTIMATING DIETARY INTAKE
Challenges to Measuring or Estimating
Dietary Intake
Given that deception and reactivity are inherent components of
human relations, acquiring accurate information on behaviors
that are subject to social approbation or stigma is extremely
challenging. Thus, it is highly unlikely that data derived from
uncorroborated self-reports and other forms of information
controlled exclusively by the participant will ever be valid. For
example, while there is emerging interest in digital food imaging,
bite counters, instrumented utensils and other movement sensors
to estimate dietary intake (101, 110, 111), it should be apparent
that these technology-based methods do not address the major
issues presented herein (e.g., deception, reactivity, pseudo-
quantification, and invalidity of reference nutrient and energy

Fictional Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
values). For example, individuals wishing to “game” the system
can merely remove the devices when eating or take digital images
of their dining companion’s salad while consuming a high-
calorie dessert. Thus, despite their novelty and inventiveness,
these technological developments currently offer little progress
in estimating habitual dietary consumption because they do not
account for basic human behaviors (e.g., intentional deception
and reactivity).
Diet-Centrism: “Let Food Be Thy
Medicine…”
Diet-disease relations were posited since antiquity and it has been
asserted for millennia that individuals should “Let food be thy
medicine and medicine be thy food” (112). While this ancient
advice was relevant to individuals consuming nutritionally
inadequate diets, for individuals and populations consuming
biochemically superior diets [e.g., the average US citizen (6–8)]
this advice is archaic and misleading (15).
Recently, we coined the term “Diet-Centrism” to describe
the “the naïve tendency of both researchers and the public to
attribute a wide-range of negative health outcomes exclusively to
dietary factors while neglecting the essential and well-established
role of individual differences in nutrient-metabolism” (15). As
we demonstrated, the explicit conflation of “diet” with both
nutritional status and health ignores the fact that the human
body is a complex physiologic system in which dietary factors
are merely one of myriad factors that affect health. And more
importantly, the effects of dietary intake are entirely dependent
on the physiologic context of the consuming individual (15).
Thus, with respect to diet-related health, it is not what is eaten
that affects health and disease, but what one’s body does with
what was eaten (113, 114). Therefore, as we previously detailed
(15, 55, 113), the idea that “you are what you eat” is demonstrative
of prescientific thinking [i.e., magico-religious reasoning (55)],
“physiologic illiteracy” (15, 114), and flouts centuries of progress
in medical science because dietary components cannot have
effects independent of the physiologic context of the consuming
individual (15, 55, 113, 114).
Does “Diet” Have a Non-trivial Impact on
Health?
Modern scientific investigations established that if a person
habitually fails to consume sufficient calories or protein to
meet metabolic demands, that person will die due to protein-
energy malnutrition (i.e., starvation). Similarly, if a person fails
to consume adequate levels of nutrients, then he or she will
suffer diseases specific to the dietary deficiency (e.g., scurvy from
insufficient Vitamin C). Nevertheless, it is extremely important
to note that in general populations the established causal effects
of “diet” are limited to protein-energy malnutrition and nutrient
deficiencies.
Contrary to current conjectures, there are no valid data
demonstrating that “diet” per se is causal to increased mortality
from obesity, NCDs, and metabolic diseases (15, 113). First,
diet-centric speculations based on mere statistical associations
provide no evidence of causation, and when tested via rigorous
(i.e., objective) methods these hypotheses were repeatedly
demonstrated to be false (50, 115, 116). Second, diet-disease
conjectures on sugar, salt, and fat consumption fail to meet
Bradford Hill’s criteria for causality (e.g., strength, consistency,
biological gradient, and specificity) (15, 51, 113). Third, the vast
majority of diet-disease relations rely upon the validity of M-
BMs. If as demonstrated herein, M-BMs are not valid, then ∼80%
of the research in the US Department of Agricultures’ National
Evidence Library (107) and most diet-centric speculations have
no valid empirical support. Fourth, clinical trials examining
intermediate biomarkers (e.g., serum lipids) and other surrogate
risk factors are often irrelevant to the actual risk of mortality
and morbidity (117). For example, it is well-established that
while biomarkers may reflect the short-term physiologic effects
of an intervention, these alterations are not necessarily indicative
of changes in risk (118, 119). Fifth, myriad paradoxes [e.g.,
Australian, French, Finish, Irish, Israeli, Indian, Spanish, Masai,
and Japanese (120–128)] and rigorous analyses (15, 113, 129, 130)
suggest that sugar, salt, and fat are merely necessary for health
and well-being but have no major impacts on chronic diseases
(15, 113). For example, there are populations that consume as
much as 80% of their caloric intake from added sugars with no
obesity and metabolic diseases. For a review please see (15, 113).
Finally, research dating to the 1950s demonstrated that the “over-
consumption” that leads to obesity and metabolic disease is
not driven by dietary factors per se, but by physical inactivity-
induced increments in energy intake (113, 114, 131–134) and
non-genetic evolutionary processes (i.e., accumulative maternal
effects) (113, 114, 135–137) that lead to the asymmetric and
adipogenic partitioning of nutrient-energy (114).
Thus, we posit that while dietary intake is an obvious and
essential component of health, it is a trivial risk factor for
obesity, metabolic, and chronic diseases (15, 55, 73, 113, 114).
Our position is rapidly acquiring support given the “tiny” effect
sizes and “massive confounding” inherent in nutrition research
(61, 138–140). For example, when compared to the relative risk
estimates of smoking tobacco, estimates for dietary factors are an
order of magnitude smaller (140). In fact, these estimates are so
trivial, “crude and imprecise” that most diet-disease associations
may be considered spurious (141). As such, we posit that
measuring “diet” per se is tangential if not irrelevant to the major
public health issues faced by industrialized nations (113, 114).
FORWARD PROGRESS
Because identical diets consumed by different individuals result
in divergent metabolic and health effects (15, 114, 142–144),
measuring “diet” without accurate and detailed knowledge of the
metabolic phenotype of the consuming individual is pointless.
And given that accurate metabolic phenotyping in large samples
is prohibitively expensive in terms of resources and participant
burden, valid epidemiologic (i.e., population-level) investigations
of diet-disease relations may simply be unachievable.
Nevertheless, the metabolic fate of consumed foods and
beverages are accessibly to quantification via laboratory settings
because all dietary components are fully metabolized or excreted
in experimentally relevant time-frames (i.e., minutes to days).
Thus, the non-trivial physiologic effects of dietary intake can be
ascertained via RCTs. Given this reality, it is important to note
that the notion that “diet” has long-term physiologic or health

Fictional Discourse on Diet-Disease Relations
effects independent of the metabolic fate of consumed bio-active
molecules is a form of magico-religious reasoning (15, 55) and an
impediment to scientific progress.
We realize that some may perceive our conclusions as
both contrary and controversial. Nevertheless, we posit that
the decades-long fictional discourse on the effects of dietary
sugar, salt, and fat led to an extreme form of diet-centrism
that obscured well-established evidence and engendered the
proliferation of misleading and demonstrably false research
programs and failed public health initiatives (15, 20, 113). Thus,
given the evidence presented herein, it is incumbent upon
nutrition epidemiologists to provide valid scientific support for
their “diet-centric” speculations and demonstrate that the average
“Western diet” (6, 7) has non-trivial effects on obesity and NCDs
in industrialized nations (114).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Since its first clinical trial in the eighteenth century, the field
of nutrition relied on the observable effects of an individual’s
dietary intake on his or her health. This scientific process led
to the elimination of diet-related deficiencies and substantial
improvements in public health. Nonetheless, beginning in the
1950s, the field allowed rigorous research to be obscured by the
sensational but implausible results and conclusions generated by
the pseudo-quantified anecdotal data generated via M-BMs. The
devolution from rigorous scientific observation to anecdotal (i.e.,
self-reported) evidence led to a fictional discourse on diet-disease
relations that resulted in both public and policy confusion, and a
major loss of credibility for the nutrition sciences. We challenge
the field to acknowledge the inherent flaws and empirical and
theoretical refutations of M-BMs, and ensure that in the future,
rigorous scientific methods (e.g., RCTs) are used to study the role
of diet in chronic disease.
