Progressive functional decline in the epilepsies is largely unexplained. We formed the ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium to understand
factors that influence brain measures in epilepsy, pooling data from 24 research centres in 14 countries across Europe, North and
South America, Asia, and Australia. Structural brain measures were extracted from MRI brain scans across 2149 individuals with
epilepsy, divided into four epilepsy subgroups including idiopathic generalized epilepsies (n =367), mesial temporal lobe epilepsies
with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE; left, n = 415; right, n = 339), and all other epilepsies in aggregate (n = 1026), and compared to
1727 matched healthy controls. We ranked brain structures in order of greatest differences between patients and controls, by meta-
analysing effect sizes across 16 subcortical and 68 cortical brain regions. We also tested effects of duration of disease, age at onset,
and age-by-diagnosis interactions on structural measures. We observed widespread patterns of altered subcortical volume and
reduced cortical grey matter thickness. Compared to controls, all epilepsy groups showed lower volume in the right thalamus

 (Cohen’s d = �0.24 to �0.73; P 5 1.49 � 10�4), and lower thickness in the precentral gyri bilaterally (d = �0.34 to �0.52;
P 5 4.31 � 10�6). Both MTLE subgroups showed profound volume reduction in the ipsilateral hippocampus (d = �1.73 to
�1.91, P 5 1.4 � 10�19), and lower thickness in extrahippocampal cortical regions, including the precentral and paracentral
gyri, compared to controls (d = �0.36 to �0.52; P 5 1.49 � 10�4). Thickness differences of the ipsilateral temporopolar, para-
hippocampal, entorhinal, and fusiform gyri, contralateral pars triangularis, and bilateral precuneus, superior frontal and caudal
middle frontal gyri were observed in left, but not right, MTLE (d = �0.29 to �0.54; P 5 1.49 � 10�4). Contrastingly, thickness
differences of the ipsilateral pars opercularis, and contralateral transverse temporal gyrus, were observed in right, but not left,
MTLE (d = �0.27 to �0.51; P 5 1.49 � 10�4). Lower subcortical volume and cortical thickness associated with a longer duration
of epilepsy in the all-epilepsies, all-other-epilepsies, and right MTLE groups (beta, b 5 �0.0018; P 5 1.49 � 10�4). In the largest
neuroimaging study of epilepsy to date, we provide information on the common epilepsies that could not be realistically acquired
in any other way. Our study provides a robust ranking of brain measures that can be further targeted for study in genetic and
neuropathological studies. This worldwide initiative identifies patterns of shared grey matter reduction across epilepsy syndromes,
and distinctive abnormalities between epilepsy syndromes, which inform our understanding of epilepsy as a network disorder, and
indicate that certain epilepsy syndromes involve more widespread structural compromise than previously assumed.

Introduction
Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder, comprising
many different syndromes and conditions, affecting 0.6–
1.5% of the population worldwide (Bell et al., 2014).
Approximately one-third of affected individuals do not re-
spond
to
antiepileptic
drug
therapy
(French,
2007).
Alternative treatment options may not be appropriate
(Englot et al., 2011), and are not always effective (Te
´llez-
Zenteno et al., 2005; Englot et al., 2011). The identification
of shared biological disease pathways may help elucidate
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic tar-
gets, which, in turn, could help to optimize individual treat-
ment (Pitka
¨nen et al., 2016). However, disease biology
remains unexplained for most cases—especially in com-
monly occurring epilepsies.
Epilepsy is a network disorder typically involving wide-
spread structural alterations beyond the putative epileptic
focus (Bernhardt et al., 2015; Vaughan et al., 2016).
Hippocampal sclerosis is a common pathological substrate
of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), but extrahippo-
campal abnormalities are also frequently observed in MTLE,
notably in the thalamus (Keller and Roberts, 2008; Coan
et al., 2014; Alvim et al., 2016) and neocortex (Keller and
Roberts, 2008; Bernhardt et al., 2009b, 2010; Blanc et al.,
2011;
Labate
et
al.,
2011;
Vaughan
et
al.,
2016).
Neocortical abnormalities are also reported in idiopathic
generalized epilepsies (IGE) (Bernhardt et al., 2009a), and
many
childhood
syndromes
(O’Muircheartaigh
et
al.,
2011; Vollmar et al., 2011; Ronan et al., 2012; Overvliet
et al., 2013). Thus, common epilepsies may be characterized
by shared disturbances in distributed cortico-subcortical

 brain networks (Berg et al., 2010), but the pattern, consist-
ency and cause of these disturbances, and how they relate to
functional decline (Vlooswijk et al., 2010; Bernasconi, 2016;
Nickels et al., 2016), are largely unknown.
Currently, we lack reliable data from large cross-sectional
neuroimaging, brain tissue, or biomarker studies in the
common epilepsies. Brain tissue is not available from
large cohorts of patients: common forms of epilepsy are
often unsuitable for surgical treatment, so biopsied tissues
are simply unavailable in sufficient numbers for research
into disease biology. Brain-wide post-mortem studies also
require extensive effort for comprehensive analysis. MRI
offers detailed information on brain structure, but MRI
measures from groups of individuals with and without epi-
lepsy are not always consistent. For example, MTLE is
associated with hippocampal sclerosis in up to 70% of
brain MRI scans (Blu
¨mcke et al., 2013). However, the ef-
fects of laterality, and the extent of extrahippocampal grey
matter loss are inconsistently reported in studies of left
versus right MTLE (Kemmotsu et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2016). Similarly, abnormalities of the basal ganglia, hippo-
campus, lateral ventricles, and neocortex have all been re-
ported in IGE (Betting et al., 2006), but most alterations
are non-specific, and visual inspection of clinical MRI in
IGE is typically normal (Woermann et al., 1998). Genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic
variants associated with complex epilepsies by ‘lumping’
different
epilepsy
types
together
(International
League
Against
Epilepsy
Consortium
on
Complex
Epilepsies,
2014), but MRI studies are typically of smaller scale, and
have not widely explored whether distinct epilepsy syn-
dromes share common structural abnormalities.
There are many sources of inconsistency in previously
reported MRI findings. First, epileptic seizures and syn-
dromes are diverse; classifications are often revised and
contested
(Berg
et
al.,
2010;
Scheffer
et
al.,
2017).
Second, most cross-sectional brain imaging studies are
based on small samples (typically 550 cases), limiting the
power to detect subtle group differences (Button et al.,
2013). Third, variability in scanning protocols, image pro-
cessing, and statistical analysis may affect the sensitivity of
brain measures across studies.
The Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-
Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium was formed to address
these issues (Bearden and Thompson, 2017). ENIGMA is
a global initiative, combining large samples with coordi-
nated image processing, and integrating genomic and
MRI data across hundreds of research centres worldwide.
Prior ENIGMA studies have identified genetic variants
associated with variations in brain structure (Stein et al.,
2012; Hibar et al., 2015, 2017a; Adams et al., 2016), and
have reliably characterized patterns of brain abnormalities
in schizophrenia (van Erp et al., 2016), major depression
(Schmaal et al., 2016),
obsessive
compulsive disorder
(Boedhoe et al., 2017), attention deficit hyperactivity dis-
order (Hoogman et al., 2017), and many other brain ill-
nesses (Thompson et al., 2017). Large-scale, collaborative
initiatives such as ENIGMA may improve our understand-
ing of epilepsy, helping clinicians make more informed
decisions and provide personalized treatment strategies
(Ben-Menachem, 2016). Thus, we formed the Epilepsy
Working Group of ENIGMA (‘ENIGMA-Epilepsy’) to
apply coordinated, well-powered studies of imaging and
genetic data in epilepsy.
Here, in the largest analysis of structural brain abnorm-
alities in epilepsy to date, we ranked effect sizes for 16
subcortical and 68 cortical brain regions in 2149 individ-
uals with epilepsy and 1727 healthy controls, using harmo-
nized image processing, quality control, and meta-analysis.
First, we grouped all epilepsies together, to determine
whether
biologically
distinct
syndromes
show
robust,
common structural deficits. Second, we assessed a well-
characterized form of epilepsy: MTLE with hippocampal
sclerosis, analysing patients with left- and right-sided hip-
pocampal sclerosis as independent groups. Third, we exam-
ined another major set of epilepsy syndromes: IGE. Finally,
we studied all remaining epilepsies as a combined sub-
group, to understand the relative contributions of IGE,
MTLE-L, MTLE-R, and all other syndromes on shared
patterns of structural compromise. We tested how age at
scan, age of onset, and epilepsy duration affected brain
structural
measures.
Based
on
existing
neuroimaging
(Gotman et al., 2005; Bernhardt et al., 2009a; Liu et al.,
2016), neurophysiological (Gotman et al., 2005), neuro-
pathological
(Thom
et
al.,
2009),
and
genetic
data
(International League Against Epilepsy Consortium on
Complex Epilepsies, 2014), we predicted that (i) biologic-
ally distinct epilepsy syndromes would exhibit shared pat-
terns of structural abnormalities; (ii) MTLEs with left or
right hippocampal sclerosis would show distinct patterns of
hippocampal and extrahippocampal structural deficits; and
(iii) IGEs would also display subcortical volume and cor-
tical thickness differences, compared to healthy controls.
Materials and methods
Each centre received approval from their local institutional
review board or ethics committee. Written informed consent
was provided according to local requirements (Supplementary
Table 1).
Experimental design
Participants
Twenty-four cross-sectional samples from 14 countries were
included in the study, totalling 2149 people with epilepsy
and 1727 research centre-matched healthy control subjects
(Fig. 1 and Table 1). The locations, dates, and periods of par-
ticipant recruitment are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
An epilepsy specialist assessed seizure and syndrome classifica-
tions at each centre, using International League Against
Epilepsy terminology (Berg et al., 2010). Participants were
aged 18–55.

 To test for shared and syndrome-specific structural alter-
ations, analyses included one group combining all epilepsies
(‘all-epilepsies’; n = 2149), and four stratified subgroups: (i)
left
MTLE
with
left
hippocampal
sclerosis
(MTLE-L;
n = 415); (ii) right MTLE with right hippocampal sclerosis
(MTLE-R; n = 339); (iii) IGE (n = 367); and (iv) all other epi-
lepsies (n = 1028). Supplementary Table 2 lists all syndromic
diagnoses included in the aggregate ‘all-epilepsies’ group. For
the MTLE subgroups, we included anyone with the typical
electroclinical constellation (Berg et al., 2010), and a neuror-
adiologically-confirmed diagnosis of unilateral hippocampal
sclerosis on clinical MRI. Participants were included in the
IGE subgroup if they presented with tonic-clonic, absence or
myoclonic seizures with generalized spike-wave discharges on
EEG. Participants were included in the ‘all-other-epilepsies’
subgroup if they were diagnosed with non-lesional MTLE
(43.3%), occipital (1.67%), frontal (8.78%), or parietal lobe
epilepsy (0.84%), focal epilepsies not otherwise specified
(37.03%),
or
another
unclassified
syndrome
(8.37%;
Supplementary Table 2). We excluded participants with a pro-
gressive disease (e.g. Rasmussen’s encephalitis), malformations
of cortical development, tumours or previous neurosurgery.
MRI data collection and processing
Structural T1-weighted MRI brain scans were collected at the
24 participating centres. Scanning details are provided in
Supplementary Table 3. T1-weighted images from cases and
controls were analysed at each site using FreeSurfer 5.3.0,
for automated analysis of brain structure (Fischl, 2012).
Volumetric measures were extracted for 12 subcortical grey
matter regions (six left and six right, including the amygdala,
caudate, nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen, and thal-
amus), the left and right hippocampi, and the left and right
lateral ventricles. Cortical thickness measures were extracted
for 34 left-hemispheric grey matter regions, and 34 right-hemi-
spheric grey matter regions (68 total; Supplementary Table 4).
Visual inspections of subcortical and cortical segmentations
were conducted following standardized ENIGMA protocols
(http://enigma.usc.edu), used in prior genetic studies of brain
structure (Stein et al., 2012; Hibar et al., 2015, 2017a; Adams
et al., 2016), and large-scale case-control studies of neuro-
psychiatric illnesses (Schmaal et al., 2015, 2016; Hibar et al.,
2016; van Erp et al., 2016; Boedhoe et al., 2017). Analysts
were blind to participants’ diagnoses. Each analyst was in-
structed to execute a series of standardized bash scripts, iden-
tifying participants with volumetric or thickness measures
greater or less than 1.5 times the interquartile range as out-
liers. Outlier data were then visually inspected, by overlaying
the participant’s cortical segmentations on their whole-brain
anatomical images. If the blinded local analyst judged any
structure as inaccurately segmented, that structure was omitted
from the analysis. The Supplementary material provides fur-
ther information.
Statistical analysis
Participant demographics
All research centres tested for differences in age between indi-
viduals with epilepsy and controls using an unpaired, two-
tailed t-test in the R statistics package (https://www.r-project.
org). Each centre also tested for sex differences between indi-
viduals with epilepsy and controls using a chi-squared test in
SPSS Statistics package (IBM Corp., Version 21.0).
Meta-analytical group comparisons
Each research centre tested for case-versus-control differences
using multiple linear regressions (via the lm function imple-
mented
in
R),
where
a
binary
indicator
of
diagnosis
(0 = healthy control, 1 = person with epilepsy) was the pre-
dictor of interest, and the volume or thickness of a specified
brain region was the outcome measure. We calculated effect
size estimates across all brain regions using Cohen’s d, adjust-
ing for age, sex and intracranial volume (ICV). ICV is a reli-
able, indirect measure of head size (Hansen et al., 2015), used
as a covariate in other large-scale ENIGMA collaborations
(Schmaal et al., 2015, 2016; Hibar et al., 2016; van Erp
et al., 2016; Boedhoe et al., 2017). Cohen’s d effect sizes
and regression beta coefficients were pooled across centres
using
a
random-effects,
restricted
maximum
likelihood
method
of
meta-analysis
via
the
R
package,
metafor
(Viechtbauer, 2010). The Supplementary material provides
additional details.
Meta-analytical regression with clinical variables
Each centre conducted a series of linear regressions, testing the
association between subcortical volume or cortical thickness,
and: (i) age at onset of epilepsy; and (ii) duration of epilepsy.

 All centres tested for interactions between diagnosis of epilepsy
(including syndrome groups) and age at time of scan. Beta
values representing the unstandardized slopes of each regres-
sion were extracted for each analysis. Sex and ICV were
included as covariates in all secondary analyses.
Correction for multiple comparisons
We conducted four independent regressions (one case versus
control regression, and three regressions with clinical variables)
across 84 regions of interest, adjusting the statistical significance
threshold to Pthresh 5 1.49 � 10�4 to correct for 336 compari-
sons. To account for correlations between tests, we also applied
a less conservative adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR),
using the Benjamini and Hochberg method (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995). For clarity, we report only P-values signifi-
cant
after
stringent
Bonferroni
correction;
FDR-adjusted
P-values are summarized in the Supplementary material.
Power analyses
Across all regions of interest, we calculated the sample sizes
necessary to achieve 80% power to detect case-control differ-
ences, given the observed effect sizes at each region of interest,
based on two-tailed t-tests, using G*Power Version 3.1. For
each region of interest, we also estimated N80: the total
number of samples required, per group, to achieve 80%
power to detect group differences using a t-test at the threshold
of P 5 0.05 (two-tailed).
Results
Participant demographics
The sample size-weighted mean age across all epilepsy sam-
ples was 34.4 (range: 26.2–40) years, and the weighted
mean age of healthy controls was 33.3 (range: 25.2–42.3)
years. The weighted mean age at onset of epilepsy and
duration of epilepsy were 17.6 (range: 12.1–28.2) years
and 17.4 (range: 8.3–28) years, respectively. Females com-
prised 57% of the total epilepsy sample (range: 34–75% by
individual
sample),
and 53%
of
the controls
(range:
31–71% by individual sample). Case-control differences
in age were observed at 8 of 24 research centres, and
case-control differences in sex were observed at 2 of 24
research centres (Supplementary Table 5); hence, age and
sex were included as covariates in all group comparisons.
Volumetric findings
Compared
to
controls,
the
aggregate
all-epilepsies
group exhibited lower volumes in the left (d = �0.36;
P = 1.31 � 10�6) and right thalamus (d = �0.37; P = 7.67
� 10�14),
left
(d = �0.35;
P = 3.04 � 10�7)
and
right
hippocampus (d = �0.34; P = 6.63 � 10�10), and the right
pallidum (d = �0.32; P = 8.32 � 10�9). Conversely, the left
(d = 0.29;
P = 2.14 � 10�12)
and
right
(d = 0.27;
P = 3.73 � 10�15) lateral ventricles were enlarged across
all epilepsies when compared to controls (Table 2 and
Fig.
2A).
A
supplementary
analysis
of
all-epilepsies,
excluding individuals with hippocampal sclerosis or other
lesions, revealed similar patterns of volume loss in the right
thalamus and pallidum, and bilaterally enlarged ventricles;
however, volume differences were not observed in the
hippocampus (Supplementary Table 6).
The MTLE-L subgroup showed lower volumes in the
left
hippocampus
(d = �1.73;
P = 1.35 � 10�19),
left
(d =
P = 2.19 � 10�11) and right thalamus (d = �0.46;
P = 8.12 � 10�5),
left
putamen
(d = �0.39;
P = 1.07 �
10�6), and right pallidum (d = �0.45; P = 5.48 � 10�7).
As in the overall group comparison, we observed larger
left (d = 0.47; P = 1.96 � 10�7) and right lateral ventricles
(d = 0.36; P = 8.95 � 10�5) in MTLE-L patients relative to
controls (Table 2 and Fig. 2B).
The MTLE-R subgroup showed lower volumes across a
number of regions in the right hemisphere only, including
the hippocampus (d = �1.91; P = 6.36 � 10�37), thalamus
(d = �0.73; P = 1.6 � 10�12), and pallidum (d = �0.45;
P = 3.96 � 10�7), together with increased volumes of the
left (d = 0.39; P = 1.52 � 10�6) and right lateral ventricles
(d = 0.44; P = 6.57 � 10�12) compared to controls (Table 2
and Fig. 2C).
The IGE subgroup showed lower volumes in the right
thalamus (d = �0.4; P = 3.6 � 10�6) compared to controls
(Table 2 and Fig. 2D).
The all-other-epilepsies subgroup showed lower volumes
in the right thalamus (d = �0.31; P = 7.9 � 10�11) and the
right pallidum (d = �0.24; P = 8.1 � 10�5) compared to
controls. The all-other-epilepsies subgroup also showed sig-
nificant enlargements of the left (d = 0.33; P = 5.1 � 10�7)
and right amygdala (d = 0.22; P = 1.46 � 10�4), and the
left (d = 0.2; P = 1.2 � 10�5) and right lateral ventricles
(d = 0.21; P = 4.62 � 10�6) compared to controls (Table 2
and Fig. 2E).
All
volume
differences
can
be
visualized
using
the
interactive ENIGMA-Viewer tool (Zhang et al., 2017), at
http://enigma-viewer.org/ENIGMA_epilepsy_subcortical.html
(Supplementary material). Volume differences significant
after FDR adjustment can also be visualized at http://
enigma-viewer.org/ENIGMA_epilepsy_subcortical_fdr.html
(Supplementary Tables 26–30).
Cortical thickness findings
The all-epilepsies group showed reduced thickness of cor-
tical grey matter across seven regions bilaterally, including
the left (d = �0.38; P = 1.82 � 10�18) and right precentral
gyri (d = �0.4; P = 8.85 � 10�20), left (d = �0.32; P = 2.11
� 10�15) and right caudal middle frontal gyri (d = �0.31;
P = 2.09 � 10�9), left (d = �0.31; P = 2.05 � 10�6) and
right paracentral gyri (d = �0.32; P = 2.19 � 10�9), left
(d = �0.19; P = 1.29 � 10�4) and right pars triangularis
(d = �0.2; P = 4.25 � 10�8), left (d = �0.28; P = 1.51 �
10�7)
and
right
superior
frontal
gyri
(d = �0.27;
P = 4.49 � 10�6), left (d = �0.19; P = 1.05 � 10�5) and
right
transverse
temporal
gyri
(d = �0.18;
P = 2.81 �
10�5), and left (d = �0.23; P = 9.87 � 10�5) and right

 supramarginal gyri (d = �0.22; P = 5.24 � 10�5). The all-
epilepsies group also showed unilaterally thinner right
cuneus (d = �0.2; P = 9.68 � 10�8), right pars opercularis
(d = �0.18; P = 6.48 � 10�7), right precuneus (d = �0.28;
P = 2.7 � 10�5),
and
left
entorhinal
gyrus
(d = �0.26;
P = 2.04 � 10�5), compared to healthy controls (Table 3
and Fig. 3A). Supplementary analysis in a non-lesional epi-
lepsy subgroup revealed a similar pattern of cortical thick-
ness differences compared to controls, suggesting that the
changes observed in our main analysis were not driven by
the inclusion of patients with hippocampal sclerosis or
other common lesions (Supplementary Table 7).
The MTLE-L and MTLE-R subgroups showed distinct
patterns of cortical thickness reductions when compared
to healthy controls (Table 3, Fig. 3B and C). In MTLE-R,
lower cortical thickness was reported across four motor
regions, including the left (d = �0.51; P = 7.67 � 10�7)
and right paracentral gyri (d = �0.42; P = 6.24 � 10�11),

hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-R), (D) idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE), and (E) all-other-epilepsies groups. Cohen’s d effect sizes were
extracted using multiple linear regressions, and pooled across research centres using random-effects meta-analysis. Subcortical structures with P-
values 5 1.49 � 10�4 are shown in heatmap colours; strength of heat map is determined by the size of the Cohen’s d (d 5 0 = blue,
d 4 0 = yellow/red). Image generated using MATLAB, with annotations added using Adobe Photoshop. An interactive version of this figure is

Figure 3 Cortical thickness findings. Cohen’s d effect size estimates for case-control differences in cortical thickness, across the (A)
all-epilepsies, (B) mesial temporal lobe epilepsies with left hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-L), (C) mesial temporal lobe epilepsies with right
hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-R), (D) idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE), and (E) all-other-epilepsies groups. Cohen’s d effect sizes were
extracted using multiple linear regressions, and pooled across research centres using random-effects meta-analysis. Cortical structures with
P-values 5 1.49 � 10�4 are shown in heatmap colours; strength of heat map is determined by the size of the Cohen’s d (d 5 0 = blue,
d 4 0 = yellow/red). Image generated using MATLAB with annotations added using Adobe Photoshop. An interactive version of this figure is
available online, via ‘ENIGMA-Viewer’: http://enigma-viewer.org/ENIGMA_epilepsy_cortical.html. See Supplementary material for guidelines on
how to use the interactive visualization. HS = hippocampal sclerosis.

(d = �0.29; P = 2.16 � 10�6). In MTLE-L, thickness alter-
ations were also observed in four regions of the temporal
cortex, including the left temporopolar cortex (d = �0.32;
P = 3.33 � 10�6),
left

gyri
(d = �0.39; P = 5.27 � 10�8), when compared to healthy

compared to controls. The all-other-epilepsies group also
showed unilaterally reduced thickness in six right hemi-
spheric regions, including the cuneus (d = �0.23; P = 2.15
� 10�7), lateral occipital gyrus (d = �0.21; P = 3.18 �

 Age at onset negatively associated with other regional
volumetric and thickness measures in the all-epilepsies,
IGE, MTLE-L, MTLE-R, and all-other-epilepsies groups,
but these associated areas showed no significant structural
differences in the primary case-control analysis (Table 1
and Supplementary Table 8).
There were no interaction effects between age and syn-
dromic diagnosis in the all-epilepsies, MTLE-L, MTLE-R,
IGE, or all-other-epilepsies groups.
Power analyses for detection of
case-control differences
In our sample of 2149 individuals with epilepsy and 1727
healthy controls, we had 80% power to detect Cohen’s d
effect sizes as small as d = 0.091 at the standard alpha level
of P 5 0.05 (two-tailed), and 80% power to detect Cohen’s
d effect sizes as small as d = 0.149 at the study’s stringent
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P 5 1.49 � 10�4.
N80, the number of cases and controls required to
achieve 80% power to detect group differences using a
two-tailed t-test at P 5 0.05, ranged from N80 = 6, to
detect group effects in the right hippocampus in our
MTLE-R group, to N80 = 503, to detect group effects in
the right pars opercularis in our ‘all epilepsies’ group
(Tables 2 and 3).
Discussion
In the largest coordinated neuroimaging study of epilepsy
to date, we identified a series of quantitative imaging sig-
natures—some shared across common epilepsy syndromes,
and others characteristic of selected, specific epilepsy syn-
dromes. Our sample of 2149 individuals with epilepsy and
1727 controls provided 80% power to detect differences as
small as d = 0.091 (P 5 0.05, two-tailed), allowing us to
identify subtle, consistent brain abnormalities that are typ-
ically undetectable on visual inspection, or overlooked
using smaller case-control designs. This international col-
laboration addresses prior inconsistencies in the field of
epilepsy neuroimaging, providing a robust, in vivo map
of structural aberrations, upon which future studies of dis-
ease mechanisms may expand.
In the first of five cross-sectional MRI analyses, we inves-
tigated a diverse aggregation of epilepsy syndromes, puta-
tive causes, and durations of disease. This all-epilepsies
group exhibited shared, diffuse brain structural differences
across several regions including the thalamus, pallidum,
precentral, paracentral, and superior frontal cortices. With
the exception of hippocampal volume and entorhinal thick-
ness differences (Supplementary material), these structural
alterations were not driven by any specific syndrome or
dataset (Supplementary Figs 3 and 7). Our findings suggest
a common neuroanatomical signature of epilepsy across a
wide spectrum of disease types, complementing recent evi-
dence for shared genetic susceptibility to a wide spectrum
of
epilepsies
(International
League
Against
Epilepsy
Consortium on Complex Epilepsies, 2014). Some structural
and genetic pathways may be shared across syndromes,
despite the heterogeneity of epilepsy and seizure types.
This shared MRI signature underpins the contemporary
shift towards the study of epilepsies as network phenomena
(Caciagli et al., 2014).
In MTLE, as expected, we observed hippocampal volume
abnormalities ipsilateral to the patient’s side of seizure
onset. Neither MTLE-L nor MTLE-R showed significant
contralateral hippocampal volume reductions, confirming
that sporadic, unilateral MTLE is not routinely under-
pinned by bilateral hippocampal damage (Blu
¨mcke et al.,
2013).
Both
MTLE
groups
showed
extrahippocampal
abnormalities in the ipsilateral thalamus and pallidum,
with widespread reductions in cortical thickness, support-
ing a growing body of literature indicating that MTLE, as
an example of a specific disease constellation in the epilep-
sies, is also a network disease, extending beyond the mesial
temporal regions (Keller et al., 2014; de Campos et al.,
2016). Disruption of this network, notably in the thalamus
(Keller et al., 2015; He et al., 2017) and thalamo-temporal
white matter tracts (Keller et al., 2015, 2017), may be
associated with postoperative seizure outcome in MTLE.
Patients with left and right MTLE showed distinct pat-
terns of structural abnormalities when compared to con-
trols, resolving conflicting findings from smaller studies,
some reporting an equal distribution of structural differ-
ences (Liu et al., 2016), and others indicating more diffuse
abnormalities, either in left MTLE (Keller et al., 2002,
2012; Bonilha et al., 2007; Kemmotsu et al., 2011; de
Campos et al., 2016) or in right MTLE (Pail et al.,
2009). The structural differences observed in the present
study may reflect a younger age at onset of epilepsy in
left MTLE, which occurred, on average, 1.2 years earlier
than those with right MTLE (Supplementary Table 20).
Independent, large-scale studies of MTLE patients have
confirmed a significantly earlier age at onset in left, com-
pared to right, MTLE (Blu
¨mcke et al., 2017). Duration-
related effects were also observed in right, but not left,
MTLE, pointing to possible biological distinctions between
the two.
In IGE, a clinically and biologically distinct group of epi-
lepsies typically associated with ‘normal’ MRI on clinical
inspection (Woermann et al., 1998), we identified reduced
volume of the right thalamus, and thinner precentral gyri in
both hemispheres, supporting prior reports of structural
(Bernhardt et al., 2009a), electroencephalographic, and func-
tional (Gotman et al., 2005) abnormalities in IGE. These
IGE cases were considered typical by reviewing neurologists,
suggesting that this common type of epilepsy is also asso-
ciated with quantifiable structural brain abnormalities.
The precentral gyri, site of the primary motor cortex,
showed
bilateral
structural
deficits
across
all
epilepsy
groups (all-epilepsies, IGE, MTLE-L, MTLE-R, and all-
other-epilepsies), without detectable inter-cohort or be-
tween-disease heterogeneity (Supplementary Figs 3–12).

 Atrophy of the motor cortex has been linked to seizure
frequency and duration of epilepsy in MTLE (Coan et al.,
2014); here, we observed a negative correlation between
precentral (and postcentral) grey matter thickness and dur-
ation of epilepsy in the aggregate all-epilepsies group.
The right thalamus also showed evidence of structural
compromise across all epilepsy cohorts, re-emphasizing
the importance of the thalamus as a major hub in the epi-
lepsy network (He et al., 2017; Jobst and Cascino, 2017).
Loss of feed-forward inhibition between the thalamus and
its neocortical connections may be epileptogenic (Paz and
Huguenard, 2015), and thalamocortical abnormalities have
previously been reported in IGE (Gotman et al., 2005;
Bernhardt et al., 2009a; O’Muircheartaigh et al., 2012)
and MTLE (Mueller et al., 2010; Bernhardt et al., 2012).
These findings support prior ‘system epilepsies’ hypotheses
of pathophysiology (Avanzini et al., 2012), suggesting that
a broad range of common epilepsies share vulnerability
within a thalamocortical structural pathway involved in,
and
likely
affected
by,
seizures
(Liu
et
al.,
2003;
Bernhardt et al., 2013). Given this study’s cross-sectional
design, we cannot determine if these are causative changes,
consequences of recurrent seizures, prolonged drug treat-
ment, or a combination of factors. The epilepsies, as a
broad group, may involve progressive structural change
(Caciagli et al., 2017), indicating the need for large-scale
longitudinal studies.
A heterogeneous subgroup of individuals without con-
firmed diagnoses of IGE or MTLE with hippocampal scler-
osis showed similar patterns of structural alterations to
those observed in the aggregate all-epilepsies cohort. The
findings included enlarged ventricles, smaller right pallidum
and right thalamus, and reduced thickness across the motor
and frontal cortices. Hippocampal abnormalities were not
observed in this subgroup, suggesting that the patterns of
reduced hippocampal grey matter observed in the aggregate
group were driven by the inclusion of MTLEs with hippo-
campal sclerosis. Unlike the IGE, MTLE, and aggregate
epilepsy cohorts, this subgroup also showed bilateral en-
largement of the amygdala—a phenomenon previously re-
ported in non-lesional localization-related epilepsies (Reyes
et al., 2017) and non-lesional MTLEs (Takaya et al., 2012;
Coan et al., 2013). Non-lesional MTLEs formed a large
proportion of this ‘all-other-epilepsies’ cohort (43.3%;
445 individuals), but the subgroup included many other
focal and unclassified syndromes, potentially obscuring spe-
cific biological interpretations. Future, sufficiently powered
studies will stratify this cohort into finer-grained subtypes
to delineate syndrome-specific effects.
Despite its international scale, our study has limitations.
All results were derived from cross-sectional data: we
cannot distinguish between historical acute damage and
progressive abnormalities. We cannot disentangle the rela-
tive contributions of environmental and treatment-related
factors, including antiepileptic medications, seizure types
and frequencies, disease severity, language dominance,
and other initial precipitating factors. On average, duration
of epilepsy was at least 10 years; longitudinal investigations
of new-onset and paediatric epilepsies will provide a more
comprehensive understanding. Despite using standardized
image processing protocols, quality control, and statistical
techniques, some brain measures showed a wide distribu-
tion of effect sizes across research centres, which may re-
flect sample heterogeneity and differences in scanning
protocols (Supplementary material).
We observed modest thickness differences across the ma-
jority of cortical regions; Cohen’s d effect sizes ranged from
small to moderate (d = 0.2–0.5), with some very small ef-
fects (d 5 0.2) noted in the right pars opercularis, bilateral
pars triangularis, and bilateral transverse temporal gyri of
the
aggregate
all-epilepsies
group.
Other
large-scale
ENIGMA studies have reported similarly modest (albeit
less widespread) cortical abnormalities in psychiatric ill-
nesses including major depression (Schmaal et al., 2016)
and bipolar disorder (Hibar et al., 2017b). Although epi-
lepsy is characterized by an enduring predisposition to gen-
erate abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity
in the brain (Fisher et al., 2014), our findings indicate that
common epilepsies are associated with widespread, but
relatively subtle, structural alterations of the neocortex.
Replication in independent MRI cohorts, complemented
by advanced imaging modalities and large-scale gene ex-
pression datasets, will help elucidate how these cortical
abnormalities relate to underlying disease processes.
Overall, in the largest neuroimaging analysis of epilepsy
to date, we demonstrate a pattern of robust brain structural
abnormalities within and between syndromes. Specific func-
tional interpretations cannot be inferred from grey matter
differences, but lower volume and thickness measures may
reflect tissue loss, supporting recent observations that the
common epilepsies cannot always be considered benign
(Gaitatzis et al., 2004; Bell et al., 2016; Devinsky et al.,
2017). The study provides a macroscopic neuroanatomical
map upon which neuropathological work, animal models,
and further gene expression studies, can expand. Our con-
sortium plans to investigate more specific neuroanatomical
traits and epilepsy phenotypes, explore sophisticated shape
and sulcal measures, and eventually conduct genome-wide
association analysis of brain measures, to improve our
understanding and treatment of the epilepsies.
