Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly
among pregnant women. In clinical settings blood-based testing protocols are commonly used to diagnose HEV
infection, but in community settings such invasive sampling can hinder study participation and limit discovery of
the ecology and natural history of HEV infection. Oral fluid is a non-invasive biospecimen that can harbor
pathogen-specific antibodies and has the potential to replace blood-based testing protocols.
Objectives: To develop an immunoassay to assess past and recent HEV infection that uses oral fluid instead of
serum or plasma.
Methods: The assay was validated using paired oral fluid and serum samples collected from 141 patients who pre-
sented either with (n = 76) or without (n = 65) symptoms of acute viral hepatitis at a clinical diagnostics center
in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid-based immunoassay for HEV IgG (past HEV
infection) and HEV IgA (recent HEV infection) antibodies was calculated in reference to Wantai's (Beijing Wantai)
serum-based HEV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively.
Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid-based immunoassay for HEV-IgG antibodies were 98.7%
and 98.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid-based immunoassay for HEV IgA were
89.5% and 98.3%, respectively.
Conclusions: The high concordance of our non-invasive oral fluid-based immunoassays (HEV IgG and HEV IgA)
with commercial high-performance serum HEV ELISA kits (IgG and IgM) means that population-based surveillance
of past and recent HEV infection could be expanded to improve understanding of its ecology and natural history.

1. Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the leading global causes of acute
viral hepatitis (Labrique et al., 1999; Emerson and Purcell, 2003).
HEV infections result in serious morbidity and mortality, particularly
among pregnant women (Tsega et al., 1992; Hamid et al., 1996), and
have significant economic costs. Epidemics of hepatitis E are particularly
problematic in areas of South Asia where seasonal floods lead to fre-
quent contamination of drinking water supplies with HEV (Labrique
et al., 2010; Ippagunta et al., 2007). Whereas case-fatality rates in the
general population can vary from 0.1%–3.0% in South Asia, elevated
mortality (10%–40%) in pregnant women infected with HEV genotype
1 has been demonstrated consistently. HEV infection during pregnancy
frequently leads to miscarriage, preterm delivery and poor neonatal
survival, stillbirth and neonatal death. Given its well-documented
epidemic potential, with tens of thousands of hepatitis E cases reported
annually, rapid, reliable diagnostic testing for hepatitis E is important.
Rapid and reliable hepatitis E testing during outbreaks and epidemics
could trigger preventive interventions (e.g., provision of safe drinking

 water, vaccination) to reduce the duration and severity of disease
(Labrique et al., 2012; Krain et al., 2014).
Current methods to diagnose HEV infection rely on enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that test for antibodies to HEV (anti-
HEV) in serum or on RT-PCR of HEV RNA in serum or stool. The collec-
tion of blood or stool samples is routine in the clinical setting where in-
dividuals are generally sick and seeking care. Such invasive sampling
methods tend to be acceptable in clinical settings because they inform
diagnoses and decisions that affect patients' treatment. Filling knowl-
edge gaps in the complex epidemiology and natural history of hepatitis
E, including past exposure and asymptomatic infection, will remain
challenging if screening methods rely on invasive sampling and testing
among populations seeking care in clinical settings. Population-based
surveillance of high-risk populations (pregnant women) and regions
(South Asia; southern France) are needed. Participation rates in popula-
tion-based studies can suffer depending on the invasiveness and
discomfort caused by some biospecimen collections (blood, stool),
particularly for disease inferences that require longitudinal repeated-
measurements. Oral fluid collection requires fewer resources than
blood collection since no clinically trained personnel are needed. More-
over, oral fluid can be self-collected and returned by mail/courier
(Morris-Cunnington et al., 2004). These attributes could help fill gaps
in infectious disease surveillance in populations typically underrepre-
sented in health research including those in remote and resource-limit-
ed settings and children and pregnant women. Tests using oral fluid
have been developed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
(Delaney et al., 2006; Morris et al., 2006), hepatitis A virus (Amado et
al., 2006), hepatitis C virus (Amado et al., 2006; Cha et al., 2013;
Drobnik et al., 2011), norovirus (Griffin et al., 2011; Moe et al., 2004),
Cryptosporidium parvum (Griffin et al., 2011; Moe et al., 2004; Egorov
et al., 2010), cytomegalovirus (Chaushu et al., 1996), Helicobacter pylori
(Griffin et al., 2011), and Toxoplasma gondii (Sampaio et al., 2014;
Hajeer et al., 1994) and been shown to yield similar sensitivities and
specificities as serum-based ELISAs to assess past and recent infection.
Oral fluid is composed of secretions from salivary glands, transudate
from the capillary bed and crevicular fluid (flows from between the
gums and the teeth) (McKie et al., 2002). Crevicular fluid is the compo-
nent of oral fluid that is particularly rich in IgA and IgG and IgM (McKie
et al., 2002). Most IgG in oral fluid is derived from serum and enters the
oral cavity via crevicular fluid whereas most IgA in oral fluid is produced
in the salivary glands and thus reflects mucosal as well as systemic im-
munity (Brandtzaeg, 2007). IgM is present at lower concentrations in
oral fluid than IgG and IgA (Brandtzaeg, 2013). Collection devices,
such as the Oracol saliva collection sponge, have been specifically de-
signed to collect oral fluid that is enriched with crevicular fluid contain-
ing antibodies.
Little is known about the temporal dynamics of the humoral im-
mune response to HEV in oral fluid. However, studies in rhesus mon-
keys infected with HEV and clinical studies among humans showed
that virus shedding in stool starts about 2 weeks post infection
(Dalton et al., 2008). HEV RNA in stool remains detectable up to about
8 weeks post infection. HEV RNA in blood is detectable at 2–3 weeks
and remains detectable up to about 6 weeks post infection (Dalton et
al., 2008). HEV-IgM antibody is detected at about 4 weeks and peaks
at about 6 weeks post infection. HEV-IgM antibody is closely followed
by rising HEV-IgG antibodies. Serum HEV-IgM antibodies remain de-
tectable for at least 2–3 months, whereas serum HEV-IgG antibodies
are detectable for years (Kamar et al., 2012; Hoofnagle et al., 2012).
Few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of HEV-IgA anti-
body, but HEV-IgA antibody levels are believed to rise at the same
time as HEV-IgM and remain detectable for about the same period of
time (Takahashi et al., 2005).
Optimization and integration of non-invasive biomarkers of HEV
infection into population-based epidemiologic studies could improve
participation and retention and enable more frequent follow-ups to
elucidate time-windows, routes of exposure, and the frequency and
distribution of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic HEV infections (Exum
et al., 2016). The goal of this study was to develop oral fluid-based
immunoassays to assess past and recent HEV infection among patients
visiting a clinical diagnostics center in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to validate
the oral fluid immunoassays' performance compared to commercially
available serum ELISAs (Kmush et al., 2015), and to assess the accept-
ability and reliability of participants' self-collection of oral fluid.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
Study enrollment took place at a clinical diagnostics center in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. Two groups were eligible for enrollment into this study: 1)
Participants who were referred to the diagnostics center by their physi-
cian because of symptoms of acute viral hepatitis (AVH group; N = 76);
and 2) Participants who were referred to the diagnostics laboratory be-
cause of reasons unrelated to acute viral hepatitis (hereafter “referent
group”; N = 65). First, potential participants were invited to participate
in the study and asked to provide informed oral consent. If they agreed
to participate, they were asked to provide a blood sample and two oral
fluid samples (hereafter “saliva”). Participants were asked to self-collect
the first saliva sample using an Oracol saliva collection device (Malvern
Medical Developments, Worcester, UK) and to have a second saliva
sample collected by trained clinical staff using the same saliva collection
device and procedure. To collect a saliva sample, first, participants were
instructed to rinse their mouth with cold water and then to rub the
Oracol sponge along their gum line for 1 min, in a motion similar to
brushing their teeth (except rubbing the gums and cheek rather than
the teeth). Clinical staff followed the same sample collection instruc-
tions to collect a second saliva sample from each participant. Upon com-
pletion of the sample collection, participants were asked to fill out a
short questionnaire assessing (1) preference of providing a blood vs. a
saliva sample and preference of self-collecting a saliva sample vs. having
a saliva sample collected by trained staff; (2) drinking water source,
sanitation and other household characteristics at the participant's
home; (3) whether they had symptoms of acute viral hepatitis and
the time since onset of these symptoms; (4) smoking and betel nut
chewing habits; (5) and demographics. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health (JHSPH) Institutional Review Board approved
this study (IRB00004424). The Bangladesh Institute for Child Health
served as the local IRB for this study.
2.2. Sample collection and processing
Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 20 min
before centrifugation for 15 min at 1500g. Then serum was transferred
into cryovials and stored at −80 °C. The Oracol sponge of each saliva
collection device was turned upside down (sponge up) using sterile for-
ceps, and was then centrifuged for 10 min at 1500g to spin the saliva out
of the sponge. After centrifugation the sponge was removed and the
saliva transferred into cryovials that were also stored at −80 °C. Saliva
and serum samples were shipped to JHSPH in a vapor phase liquid nitro-
gen cryomover.
2.3. Immunoassays to assess HEV infection status
Beijing Wantai HEV ELISA kits were chosen as the reference kits to
validate the serum- and saliva-based HEV assays developed in this
study (referred to as EHMIL [Environmental Health, Microbiology and
Immunology Lab] assays). Serum samples were tested for IgG antibod-
ies against HEV to evaluate past infection and IgM antibodies against
HEV to evaluate recent infection using anti-HEV IgG and anti-HEV IgM
ELISA kits (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy, Beijing, China). The as-
says were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For
assay validation we used the Wantai HEV IgG and HEV IgM results as

 reference regardless of the participant group (AVH vs. referent group).
To date there are no FDA-approved HEV IgG and HEV IgM assays, but
previous research has shown that Wantai's ELISAs are more (Zhou et
al., 2008) or equally sensitive and specific than other commercially
available HEV ELISAs (Pas et al., 2013; Avellon et al., 2015).
2.4. EHMIL serum and saliva immunoassays to assess HEV infection status
The EHMIL immunoassays developed in this study are based on
Luminex technology. For both, the serum-based and the saliva-based
assay, HEV antigen was coupled covalently to magnetic beads. The mag-
netic beads serve as solid phase and are allowed to react with the serum
or saliva sample. HEV-specific antibodies in the sample will bind to the
immobilized HEV antigen and can be detected using fluorophore-la-
beled Ig class-specific antibodies (e.g. fluorophore-labeled anti-human
IgG, anti-human IgM or anti-human IgA antibody).
2.5. Coupling of antigens to magnetic beads
The HEV antigen used in this study (HEV ORF2 protein, DevaTal Inc.,
Hamilton, NJ) is a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tagged fusion protein.
Prior to coupling, the HEV antigen was purified by size exclusion chro-
matography (Bio-Spin 6 columns, buffer exchange protocol, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) to remove any amine-containing substances that may in-
terfere with the carbodiimide coupling reaction (e.g. Tris, urea) and
eluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Next, HEV antigen was
coupled covalently to carboxylated magnetic MagPlex Microspheres
(Luminex Corp., Austin, TX), hereafter “beads”, according to the
Luminex xMAP Cookbook 2nd edition with the following modifications:
1) After activation with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (Sulfo-
NHS) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)
beads were washed once (instead of twice) with 250 μL 50 mM 2-
morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 5.0, 2) without sonica-
tion (instead of with) and 3) HEV antigen was diluted in 400 μL PBS
(instead of MES) prior to addition to the activated beads.
Coupling of HEV antigen to the magnetic beads was confirmed using
a serum sample containing anti-HEV IgG antibodies (confirmed by
Wantai HEV IgG ELISA) and R-phycoerythrin (PE) labeled anti-human
IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove,
PA).
Human antibodies may bind to GST tags and adjusting the HEV
antigen specific signal for the GST specific signal may improve assay
performance (Griffin et al., 2015). Therefore, GST antigen (Pierce,
ThermoFisher Scientific) was coupled to a different bead set using the
coupling procedure described above. Coupling of GST to the magnetic
beads was confirmed using mouse anti-GST antibody (Pierce,
ThermoFisher Scientific) and PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jack-
son ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA).
2.6. EHMIL duplex serum HEV assay
Serum samples were tested for HEV IgG, HEV IgM and HEV IgA anti-
bodies by a duplex assay that measures the HEV antigen and GST re-
sponse in the same sample. Two sets of beads (one coupled with GST-
tagged HEV antigen, the other one coupled with GST antigen)
were vortexed, sonicated and diluted in assay buffer (PBS with 0.05%
Tween20 and 1% bovine serum albumin, hereafter “buffer”). Then 25
μL bead mix (1500 beads of each set) and 25 μL serum sample diluted
1:500 in buffer were added to each well of a microtiter plate. The
plate was covered and allowed to incubate for 1 h on a plate shaker at
200 rpm. Then the beads were washed three times using an automated
magnetic bead wash station (Bio-Plex Pro Wash Station, Bio-Rad, Her-
cules, CA). Next, 50 μL of PE-labeled anti-human IgG or anti-human
IgA antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove,
PA) diluted 1:100 in buffer were added to each well. The plate was
allowed to incubate for 1 h as described above. Then the magnetic
beads were washed once more, suspended in 100 μL sheath fluid
(Luminex, Austin, TX) and the fluorescence signal was measured on a
Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To test serum samples
for anti-HEV IgM antibodies, 50 μL biotinylated anti-human IgM
antibody diluted 1:3000 in buffer were added to each well, the plate
was allowed to incubate as described above and the beads were
washed three times. Next, 50 μL of PE-labeled streptavidin (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted 1:100 in
buffer were added to each well. After another incubation and wash
step the beads were suspended in 100 μL sheath fluid and the fluores-
cence signal was measured as described above.
2.7. EHMIL duplex saliva HEV assay
Saliva samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 g to remove any
debris and precipitated mucins. Undiluted supernatants were then
tested for anti-HEV IgG antibodies using the procedure described
above. Each well contained 25 μL bead mix and 25 μL saliva; the final sa-
liva dilution was 1:2 in buffer. To test saliva samples for anti-HEV IgA an-
tibodies, saliva samples were assayed at a final dilution of 1:8 in buffer.
2.8. EHMIL HEV assay performance
Assay performance was determined using the Wantai HEV IgG and
HEV IgM ELISA results as the reference method. To calculate EHMIL
serum- and saliva-based HEV assay sensitivity and specificity we con-
sidered the Wantai HEV IgG and HEV IgM ELISA results to be correct
(100% sensitive and 100% specific). Five serum samples were classified
as “borderline” (signal to cut-off ratio was between 0.9 and 1.1) using
the Wantai HEV IgM ELISA and were therefore excluded from the anal-
ysis. We defined cut-off values by calculating the mean signals for each
EHMIL HEV assay using the corresponding Wantai HEV ELISA negative
samples and adding three standard deviations (SDs). More specifically,
we used three methods to calculate the mean signal. For example, to de-
termine the cut-offs for the EHMIL serum HEV IgG assay the mean signal
in method (1) was defined as the mean EHMIL serum HEV IgG median
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the Wantai HEV IgG negative samples
plus three SDs. The mean signal in method (2) was defined as the
mean of the ratios of serum HEV IgG MFI divided by serum GST IgG
MFI of Wantai HEV IgG negative samples plus three SDs. The mean sig-
nal in method (3) was defined as the mean of the difference between
the serum HEV IgG MFI and the serum GST IgG MFI (HEV MFI minus
GST MFI) of Wantai HEV IgG negative samples plus three SDs. We
used the same three methods to calculate cut-off values for the EHMIL
saliva HEV IgG, serum HEV IgM and HEV IgA and saliva HEV IgA assays.
To define the cut-off values for the saliva HEV-IgG assay we used the sa-
liva sample MFIs that corresponded to the Wantai HEV IgG negative
samples. To define the cut-off values for the EHMIL serum HEV IgM
and IgA assays, we used the serum sample IgM and IgA MFIs, respective-
ly, that corresponded to the Wantai HEV IgM negative samples. For the
EHMIL saliva HEV-IgA assay we used the saliva sample IgA MFIs that
corresponded to the Wantai HEV IgM negative samples.
The sensitivity of the EHMIL serum and saliva HEV assays was calcu-
lated by dividing the number of correctly classified positive samples by
EHMIL assay by the number of Wantai anti-HEV IgG or IgM ELISA posi-
tive samples. The specificity of the EHMIL serum and saliva assays was
calculated by dividing the number of correctly classified negative sam-
ples by EHMIL assay by the number of Wantai HEV IgG or IgM ELISA
negative samples.
2.9. EHMIL duplex saliva HEV assay validation
We validated the duplex saliva HEV assay by measuring intra- and
inter-assay reproducibility, recovery of spiked saliva samples, linearity
of dilution and functional sensitivity. Acceptable criteria for intra- and
inter-assay variability were defined as coefficient of variation (CV)

 b10% and b15%, respectively. Acceptable criteria for functional sensitiv-
ity were CV b20% and for dilution recovery and linearity we defined a
recovery between 80% and 120% of each dilution as acceptable.
2.10. Statistical analyses
We used chi-squared tests to estimate associations between the AVH
and referent group by anti-HEV IgG positive status for the following de-
mographic and household characteristics: age (in quartiles), household
drinking water source, household sanitation, other household charac-
teristics, level of education, and habit of chewing betel nut or tobacco
use. Additionally, we used two-sample t-tests to examine the variability
of the continuous age distributions by anti-HEV IgG positive vs. negative
status.
3. Results
3.1. Study population
One-hundred and forty-one individuals participated in this study,
with 76 participants enrolled in the AVH group and 65 enrolled in the
referent group (Table 1). Approximately half were female (49%); the
median age was 35 years (range: 18–66 years). The majority of partici-
pants (96.5%) preferred to self-collect the saliva sample over having the
sample collected by clinical staff; 90.8% preferred to provide a saliva
sample over a blood sample and 92.2% would have preferred to self-col-
lect the saliva sample at home and mail or drop it off at a hospital rather
than having it collected by clinical staff at the hospital. Self-collected sa-
liva specimens yielded a slightly higher mean saliva volume than staff-
collected samples (392 μL vs. 374 μL), although this difference was not
statistically significant (p b 0.15). Table 1 provides additional informa-
tion about the study participants' demographics, household characteris-
tics and habits of betel nut or tobacco use stratified by participant group.
3.2. Prevalence of past and recent HEV infection among study participants
Paired serum and saliva samples from 141 study participants were
collected; two saliva samples were damaged during transportation.
Serum samples from participants presenting with (AVH group) and
without symptoms of acute viral hepatitis (referent group) were tested
for past (Wantai HEV IgG ELISA) and recent (Wantai HEV IgM ELISA)
HEV infection (see Table 1). Fifty-five percent of participant samples
tested positive for anti-HEV IgG antibodies while 19 samples (13%) test-
ed positive for HEV-IgM antibodies. The presence of HEV-IgM antibod-
ies is consistent with acute or recent infection. All HEV IgM positive
serum samples tested also positive for HEV IgG.
3.3. Factors associated with AVH vs. referent group and with anti-HEV IgG
status
We found no statistically significant association between age, house-
hold characteristics or betel nut use and AVH vs. referent group. Howev-
er, more males and tobacco smokers were in the AVH compared to the
referent group (χ2 p b 0.01). Only male participants reported smoking
tobacco, i.e. the association between smoking and AVH group overlaps
that with gender. As expected, there were more HEV IgG and HEV IgM
positive individuals in the AVH group (Table 1; χ2 p b 0.01); however,
two individuals in the referent group tested positive for HEV IgM (a
marker of recent infection). HEV-IgG positive status was associated
with the household drinking water source (χ2 p b 0.01; data not
shown). Significantly more participants who reported piped water as
their drinking water source tested HEV-IgG positive (45/66; 68%) than
participants who reported tubewell water or “pump water” (31/73;
42%) as their drinking water source. Anti-HEV IgG positive status was
also positively associated with increasing age, although not statistically
significantly, likely due to the small sample size (p b 0.06; data not
shown).
3.4. Performance of EHMIL serum and saliva HEV IgG assays
Serum and saliva samples were tested using the EHMIL duplex HEV
and GST immunoassay for HEV IgG antibodies. Sensitivity and specifici-
ty of the EHMIL serum HEV IgG assay was calculated using Wantai HEV
IgG ELISA positive (n = 78) and negative (n = 63) results and ranged
from 98.7% to 100% and 96.8% to 100%, respectively, depending on the
method of signal adjustment used (Table 2). Method 1 yielded the
highest sensitivity and specificity (Table 2). Sensitivity and specificity
of the EHMIL saliva HEV IgG assay ranged between 93.5% and 98.7%
and 93.5% and 98.4%, respectively, depending on the signal adjustment
method used (Table 2). Method 2 yielded the highest sensitivity and
specificity for the EHMIL saliva HEV IgG assay.
To better visualize the concordance between the EHMIL saliva HEV
IgG assay and the Wantai HEV IgG assay we plotted the EHMIL HEV
IgG signal to cut-off ratios of all saliva samples (method 2) against the
Wantai HEV IgG signal to cut-off ratios of each corresponding serum
sample (Fig. 1). Samples in the upper right quadrant are classified as

3.5. Performance of EHMIL serum HEV IgM and HEV IgA and saliva HEV IgA
assays
Serum and saliva samples were tested using the EHMIL duplex HEV
and GST assay for HEV IgM (serum only) and IgA antibodies (serum and
saliva). Both the EHMIL HEV IgM and IgA assays were compared to
Wantai HEV IgM ELISA to determine sensitivity and specificity. The sen-
sitivity of the EHMIL serum HEV IgM assay was 94.7% (one discrepant
sample), and the specificity was 98.3% (2 discrepant samples), regard-
less of the signal adjustment method (Table 3). The sensitivity of the
EHMIL serum HEV IgA assay ranged between 94.7% and 100%, and the
specificity ranged between 98.3% and 99.1%, depending on the signal
adjustment method (Table 3). Method 3 yielded the highest sensitivity
and specificity for detection of HEV IgA (Table 3). The sensitivity of the
EHMIL saliva HEV IgA assay ranged between 36.8% and 89.5% and the
specificity ranged between 98.3% and 99.1%, depending on signal ad-
justment method, compared to Wantai HEV IgM ELISA (Table 3). Meth-
od 2 yielded the highest overall sensitivity and specificity for detection
of salivary HEV IgA (Table 3).
3.6. Comparison of saliva HEV-IgG assay results between participant-
collected and clinical staff-collected saliva samples
According to study procedures the participant self-collected the first
saliva sample and clinical staff collected the second saliva from the par-
ticipant. A subset (approximately 10%) of participant- and staff-collect-
ed saliva samples was tested for HEV-IgG to assess potential differences
in measurement outcomes. The subset included 10 HEV-IgG negative
and 5 HEV-IgG positive saliva samples. The HEV-IgG signal to cut-off ra-
tios (signal adjustment method 2) of participant vs. clinical staff-collect-
ed samples is shown in Fig. 2. All self-collected and staff-collected saliva
samples were correctly classified (HEV-IgG positive or negative com-
pared to Wantai serum HEV IgG ELISA). We observed only minimal dif-
ferences between self- and staff-collected HEV-IgG negative samples.
However, four out of five staff-collected HEV-IgG positive samples

3.7. EHMIL saliva HEV assay validation
The intra-assay variability of a negative, low and high positive HEV-
IgG saliva sample (8 replicates each) was 5%, 4% and 4%, respectively.
Inter-assay variability of a negative, low and high positive saliva sample
(2 replicates each tested in 3 independent assays) was 20%, 11% and 4%,
respectively. The functional sensitivity of the assay (18 replicates of a
low positive sample) was 6%. Linearity of dilution and recovery of a
spiked sample ranged between 96 and 104% and 82–99%, respectively.
4. Discussion
We observed good concordance between our EHMIL serum and
saliva HEV immunoassays and commercial serum HEV ELISAs. To
calculate the sensitivities and specificities of the EHMIL assays we
used the emerging global research standard HEV ELISA (Bendall et
al., 2010), which is produced by Wantai Biological. The reported
sensitivity of the Wantai HEV IgG ELISA is 98% to 100% and the spec-
ificity is 99.99%. To calculate the assay sensitivity, Wantai tested
samples from patients clinically diagnosed with hepatitis E and
assumed that a true positive sample is any sample that yielded a
positive result either using the Wantai HEV IgG ELISA or another
manufacturer's HEV IgG ELISA (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy
Enterprise Co., 2014). The specificity calculation of the Wantai HEV
IgG assay is based on the assumption that samples of the normal
population (blood donors) will form a frequency distribution with
two peaks. The first peak they observed is a log-normal distribution
(representing the HEV IgG negative population); the second peak is
a negative skewed distribution (representing the HEV IgG positive
population). Wantai chose a cut-off point between those two peaks
and calculated that any sample that yields a signal lower than the
cut-off point will have a false-positive rate of 0.01% (Beijing Wantai
Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., 2014).

Immunol. Methods (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2017.04.012
 The reported sensitivity and specificity of the Wantai HEV IgM assay
is between 96.4% and 97.9% and between 95.3% and 100%, respectively.
The sensitivity of the Wantai HEV IgM ELISA was determined in a similar
manner to the Wantai HEV IgG ELISA sensitivity, i.e., using samples from
patients clinically diagnosed with hepatitis E and assuming that any
sample that yielded a positive result either using the Wantai HEV IgM
assay or another manufacturer's HEV IgM assay is a true positive. To de-
termine the Wantai HEV IgM ELISA specificity, samples obtained from
patients infected with hepatitis A, B and C virus, from hepatitis B virus
vaccine recipients and from individuals representing the normal popu-
lation were tested.
In our saliva assays, signal adjustment method 2 (ratio of the HEV
specific MFI to the GST specific MFI) yielded the best performance be-
cause saliva samples exhibited a much stronger GST specific signal
than serum samples. Some saliva samples yielded higher GST specific
MFI than HEV antigen specific MFI, therefore not adjusting the HEV sig-
nal for GST (method 1) would be inappropriate, whereas method (3)
yielded negative signals for some samples and was therefore sub-opti-
mal. The cut-off values used in this study are based on 63 Wantai HEV
IgG ELISA confirmed negative samples and on 117 Wantai HEV IgM
ELISA negative samples. We believe that the same cut-off values could
be applied in future HEV screening studies in other study populations
if the same assay conditions (sample dilution, incubation times, anti-
body source and concentration, etc.) were used. Because immunoassay
conditions influence the cut-off values it would be advisable to use a
panel of known negative samples to confirm existing and/or re-estab-
lish cut-off values if assay conditions are modified.
One limitation of this study is the small number of confirmed HEV-
IgM positive samples, which likely had a negative bearing on the perfor-
mance characterization of the EHMIL saliva HEV IgA assay. To determine
the sensitivity of the EHMIL serum HEV IgA and IgM and the saliva HEV
IgA assays more accurately we will need to test a larger number of HEV
IgM positive samples. Another limitation is the use of a GST-tagged an-
tigen. The use of a GST-tagged antigen in salivary assays requires signal
adjustment, which introduces variability into the assay performance.
Ideally, we should have used an HEV antigen without tag or with a dif-
ferent tag that exhibits minimal cross-reactivity with antibodies in sali-
va. We attempted first to develop a salivary HEV ELISA, but had
difficulties separating the HEV-specific vs. GST-derived assay signal. Ad-
ditionally, more sample volume is required in the ELISA format com-
pared to the duplex bead-based assays since each sample must be
measured in at least two separate wells to obtain the signal attributable
to the (GST-tagged) HEV antigen and the signal attributable to GST
alone. Furthermore, the ELISA plate has to be coated with equimolar
amounts of GST and GST-tagged HEV for reliable signal adjustment.
The binding efficiency of antigens to microtiter plates is affected by mul-
tiple parameters, and, although theoretically feasible, we found it chal-
lenging to accurately separate the HEV antigen signal from signal that
is derived from the GST tag and from signal that may be due to other
non-specific binding. We observed less non-specific binding using the
bead-based assay format and, as long as both bead sets are coupled
with an excess of antigen (GST-tagged HEV and GST, respectively), it
is relatively straightforward to discern the HEV-specific signal from
the GST tag signal using the ratio of the signals of the two bead sets
for saliva assays.
To measure past and recent immune responses to pathogens in
saliva it is important to use a saliva collection device that is specifically
designed to collect crevicular fluid rather than whole saliva, since this
component of oral fluid has the highest concentration of antibodies
derived from serum. However, in order to implement the here devel-
oped oral fluid HEV assay in population-based studies or in disease
surveillance programs a simpler assay format is needed. Most labs are
equipped with ELISA readers, but not necessarily with Luminex technol-
ogy based platforms. In order to transition the test into an ELISA format,
HEV antigens with minimal non-specific binding to human antibodies
in oral fluid are needed. This will eliminate the need for a duplex
assay and will also enable the transition of the test into a field device.
A lab-based ELISA would enable researchers and clinicians to screen
large populations non-invasively and repeatedly for evidence of past
and recent HEV infection. This may elucidate time windows of exposure
and deepen our understanding of infection and transmission patterns
and of the burden of HEV in general. A field device to test for
HEV would be of particular significance in outbreak situations where
the etiologic agent needs to be identified quickly and reliably to
decide about best approaches to mitigate and limit transmission of the
disease.
Our study demonstrated participants' preference to self-collect sali-
va rather than having clinical staff collect their sample. Participants also
indicated a preference for saliva over blood collection and that they
would prefer to collect saliva at home and submit their sample for test-
ing via mail. Because all self-collected and staff-collected saliva samples
were correctly classified (HEV-IgG positive or negative compared to
Wantai serum HEV IgG ELISA), self-collection of saliva could have utility
in population-based HEV surveillance. Interestingly, among HEV-IgG
positive saliva samples collected by clinical staff we observed slightly
higher signal-to-cutoff values. It is not clear whether this could be relat-
ed to the order of sample collection, which was determined by the study
procedure, or to potential differences in the collection technique be-
tween staff- and participant self-collected swabs. It is possible that stim-
ulation of the oral mucosa by the participant's self-collected sample
resulted in slightly higher signal-to-cutoff values in the clinical staff-
collected saliva, which followed the first swab.
Despite the significant global burden of disease and mortality now
attributed to HEV, this emerging pathogen remains neglected by clini-
cians and public health professionals alike. This is partly due to unreli-
able and highly variable serologic hepatitis E assay performance
(Bendall et al., 2010; Wenzel et al., 2013; Drobeniuc et al., 2010) and un-
derstanding of hepatitis E etiology. Our oral fluid hepatitis E assays ful-
filled all validation criteria with the exception of the inter-assay
variability of the negative saliva sample. The fluorescence signal of the
negative saliva sample chosen for the validation assay was near the
lower limit of the measurable signal. A slightly higher variability in the
very low fluorescence signal range is not uncommon and does not affect
the sensitivity or specificity of the overall assay.
Even if saliva-based hepatitis E testing is not more accurate than
existing serologic hepatitis E tests, it opens the door for large-scale pop-
ulation-based cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of hepatitis E in-
cidence and prevalence. Saliva-based hepatitis E incidence and
prevalence estimation could reveal the underlying immunological land-
scape of HEV infection and inform novel prevention strategies in
endemic and resource limited settings that experience large-scale
epidemics.
In summary, the EHMIL serum and saliva HEV antibody assays
showed good concordance with the Wantai ELISAs. Future epidemio-
logic studies should include saliva collection to further improve saliva-
based assay performance characteristics and to promote the application
of saliva-based diagnostics in population-based and clinical research
settings.
