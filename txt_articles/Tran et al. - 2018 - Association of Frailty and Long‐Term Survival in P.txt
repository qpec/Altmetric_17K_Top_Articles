Background-—Frailty is increasing in prevalence and poses a formidable challenge for clinicians. The cardiac surgery literature
consists primarily of small single-center studies with limited follow-up, and the epidemiological features of frailty remain to be
elucidated in long-term follow-up.
Methods and Results-—We conducted a population-based, retrospective, cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and
2015. Frailty was defined using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty indicator (a multidimensional instrument
validated for research using administrative data). The primary outcome was mortality. Mortality rates were calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard of death was assessed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. Of 40 083
patients, 8803 (22%) were frail. At 4�2 years of follow-up, age- and sex-standardized mortality rate per 1000 person-years
was higher in frail (33; 95% confidence interval, 29–36) compared with nonfrail (22; 95% confidence interval, 19–24) patients.
Frailty was associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval,
1.12–1.28) and greater differences in the survival of patients between 40 and 74 years of age than in those who were
≥85 years old.
Conclusions-—Frailty was present in a large proportion of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and was
independently associated with long-term mortality. The adjusted risk of frailty-related death was inversely proportional to age. Our
findings highlight the need for more comprehensive preoperative risk stratification models to assist with optimal selection of
operative candidates. In addition, we identified the <75 years age group as a potential target for comprehensive preoperative
optimization programs, such as cardiac prehabilitation, nutritional augmentation, and psychosocial support. (J Am Heart Assoc.

F
railty is an emerging concept in perioperative medicine
but remains a poorly recognized and poorly investigated
syndrome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.1–4 It is
increasing in prevalence and presents a formidable challenge
for clinicians who work to optimize these patients.5 Frailty is a
common syndrome described as a diminished resiliency in
response to stress as a result of decreased physiological
reserve, increased burden of comorbidities, and altered
multisystem homeostasis.6 Frailty increases susceptibility to
adverse health outcomes and contributes to the difference
between chronological and physiological age.7 It is associated
with increased mortality, surgical site infections, length of
hospital stay, increased healthcare expenditure, and readmis-
sion rates in patients presenting for a variety of major
noncardiac surgeries.8–12 Frailty has also been reported as a
risk factor for mortality, major adverse cardiac and cere-
brovascular events, and increased length of hospital stay in
cardiac surgical patients.1,2,13–16 The cardiac surgery litera-
ture consists primarily of relatively small single-center studies
with limited follow-up durations, and the epidemiological
features of frailty remain to be elucidated in long-term follow-
up. We investigated the prevalence of frailty and its associ-
ation with long-term mortality in patients who underwent
primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in
Ontario, Canada, from 2008 to 2015.

 Methods
Design and Study Population
We conducted a population-based, retrospective, cohort study
in Ontario, Canada, between October 1, 2008, and March 31,
2015. The Research Ethics Board of Sunnybrook Health
Sciences (Toronto, ON, Canada) approved this study and
waived the need for informed consent. The data, analytic
methods, and study materials will not be made available to
other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or
replicating the procedure.
This study included adult patients ≥40 years of age, who
underwent primary isolated CABG in Ontario. We excluded
patients who were non-Ontario residents, who had a history of
cardiac surgery, or who had missing information on age, sex,
and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF; Figure 1). During the
study period, Ontario was Canada’s most populous province,
with a publicly funded universal healthcare system that
reimbursed all healthcare providers and services.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The prevalence of frailty was markedly higher in patients
undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting com-
pared with those undergoing elective noncardiac surgery.
• Frailty was associated with poor early and long-term
survival, especially in those between 40 and 74 years of
age.
• The adjusted long-term frailty-related mortality risk was
inversely proportional to age.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Frailty should be incorporated into preoperative risk strat-
ification models to assist with optimal selection of operative
candidates.
• Effective preoperative interventions may improve outcomes,
especially in younger patients.

 Data Sources
The authors used the registry data of CorHealth Ontario and
population-level administrative healthcare databases with
information on all Ontario residents available at the Institute
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Individuals who underwent
primary isolated CABG were identified from the CorHealth
Ontario Cardiac Registry. The CorHealth Ontario Cardiac
Registry captures data from all 19 hospitals that provide
invasive cardiac procedures across the province. The registry
contains detailed demographic, comorbidity, and procedural-
related information and has been validated through selected
chart audits. In addition, EF and angiographic data in the
CorHealth Ontario registry undergo core laboratory validation.17
Administrative databases were linked deterministically
using encrypted identifiers that preserved patient confiden-
tiality. The authors linked the CorHealth Ontario registry (date
and type of cardiac procedures, comorbidities, EF, and
angiographic data) with the Canadian Institute for Health
Information’s Discharge Abstract Database (comorbidities and
hospital
admissions)
and
Same
Day

database
(comorbidities), Ontario Health Insurance Plan database
(physician service claims), Registered Persons Database
(ascertainment of vital statistics), and Canadian census.
Although lacking in physiologic and laboratory measures,
these administrative databases have been validated for many
outcomes, exposures, and comorbidities.18–21
Exposure
Assessments of frailty can be made with clinical scales,22
functional assessments,13,23 and their combination,24 or by the
presence of a constellation of frailty-defining diagnoses.5,8,25
This last method uses the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical
Groups (ACG) frailty-defining diagnoses indicator, which is an
instrument based on 10 clusters of frailty-defining diagnoses
(ie, malnutrition, dementia, impaired vision, decubitus ulcer,
incontinence of urine, loss of weight, poverty, barriers to access
to care, difficulty in walking, and falls; Table S1). This binary
indicator identifies frailty by the presence of ≥1 diagnostic
clusters and was designed and validated for research of frailty-
related outcomes and resource use using administrative
data.26–30 It has been used to study the prevalence, outcomes,
and resource use in patients undergoing major elective
noncardiac surgery5 and total joint arthroplasty in Ontario.8
Because of the proprietary nature of the ACG system, the
authors are unable to provide the specific diagnostic codes
used to define this indicator. In the present study, frailty was
defined using comorbidity and health resource use data
available within 5 years before the index CABG.
The ACG frailty indicator has been externally validated
using the Vulnerable Elderly Scale. The findings of this
validation study indicate that the ACG frailty indicator had
moderate ability to discriminate between frail and nonfrail
patients when compared with the Vulnerable Elderly Scale
(area under the curve, 0.62).27 The lack of strength of
correlation between the 2 instruments may reflect the lack of
a gold standard for frailty assessment. To date, several frailty
scales exist to capture related, but distinct, groups that form
different dimensions of frailty.31 A direct comparison of 8
commonly used frailty instruments demonstrated limited
agreement between these instruments.31 The ACG frailty
indicator captures patients with multidimensional frailty at the
population level and has been shown to accurately identify
patients with limitations in activities of daily living.26
Covariates
Comorbidities were identified from the CorHealth Ontario
registry and supplemented with data from the Discharge

the basis of patients’ neighborhood median income in the
Canadian census and determined their residence (rural versus
urban) using Statistics Canada definitions.36 Emergent pro-
cedural status was ascertained from the CorHealth Ontario
registry and supplemented with Ontario Health Insurance Plan
claims data, where the anesthesia provider identified the
surgery as emergent under the American Society of Anesthe-
siologists physical status classification. Height, weight, and
body mass index identified from the CorHealth Ontario
registry

used
to
define
morbid
obesity
(weight,
>159 kg; or body mass index, ≥40 kg/m2). Preoperative EF
was obtained from the CorHealth Ontario registry and
classified as preserved if EF was ≥50% and reduced if EF
was <50%. We then categorized heart failure (HF) status into 4
groups: HF with preserved EF, HF with reduce EF, preserved
EF without HF, and reduced EF without HF.
Outcome
The primary outcome was death from any cause. We
confirmed in-hospital mortality using the Discharge Abstract
Database and postdischarge mortality using the Registered
Persons Database.

 and categorical variables were expressed as number (propor-
tions). Mortality was assessed through March 31, 2016.
Patients were censored when they lost possession of a valid
Ontario health insurance number for 2 consecutive eligibility
quarters (ie, have left the province of Ontario). Survival time
was defined as date of index surgery until date of death or
date of last follow-up. Event rates in each group were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and presented
graphically, with the significance of differences in mortality
between groups assessed using the log-rank test. Age-
stratified mortality rates were standardized by sex, and
pooled mortality rates were standardized by age and sex,
using the 2011 Canadian population as the reference
population. The relative hazard of death was assessed using
Cox proportional hazard models with multivariable adjust-
ment. To avoid redundant adjustment of risk factors that are
already a part of the aggregate Johns Hopkins ACG frailty
indicator, we did not control for medical comorbidities and
instead adjusted only for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and
case urgency status in our primary model. We then explored
the association of frailty and long-term mortality in subgroups
stratified by age and sex by plotting adjusted Kaplan-Meier
curves within these subgroups.
The measure of association was hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were performed
using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with statistical
significance defined by a 2-sided P<0.05.
Sensitivity Analyses
We used generalized estimating equations to determine the
adjusted association of patient-level characteristics with long-
term mortality while accounting for clustering of patients
within hospitals. In addition, we assessed whether the
association of frailty and long-term mortality would be altered
by completeness of revascularization at the time of surgery.
This was accomplished by adding completeness of revascu-
larization to the original Cox proportional hazards model.
Incomplete revascularization was defined as presence of ≥1
ungrafted vessels with ≥70% stenosis in the left anterior
descending, circumflex, or right coronary artery territories.
Finally, we repeated these sensitivity analyses in an expanded
model exploring the association of frailty and long-term
mortality while adjusting for all comorbidities.
Results
Prevalence of Frailty in Patients Undergoing CABG
A total of 40 083 consecutive patients who underwent isolated
CABG from 2008 to 2015 were included in the study (Figure 1).
Of these patients, 8803 (22.0%) were frail. The prevalence of
frailty was higher in older age groups. Specifically, 3562 (20.2%)
of the 40 to 64 years age group, 3029 (21.7%) of the 65 to 74
years age group, 2018 (25.6%) of the 75 to 84 years age group,
and 194 (31.5%) of the ≥85 years age group were frail. Table 1
summarizes the demographics and comorbidities of frail versus
nonfrail patients. Frail patients were more likely to be women, to
be >75 years of age, and to have rural places of residence,
lower income status, hypertension, preserved EF, atrial fibril-
lation, remote and recent myocardial infarction, HF, cerebral
and peripheral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease,
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, anemia, renal and liver
disease, malignancies, and dementia.
Thirty-Day Mortality
At 30 days, 626 patients (1.6%) patients died, of whom 174
(27.8%) were frail. Table 2 summarizes the sex-standardized
mortality rates of frail and nonfrail patients, stratified by age.
Frail patients had higher rates of 30-day mortality than those
who were not frail, across all but the ≥85 years age group.
Long-Term Mortality
The mean follow-up period was 4�2 years, with a total follow-
up time of 58 081 087 person-years. A total of 4423 patients
(11.0%) died during long-term follow-up, of whom 1429
(32.3%) were frail. Age- and sex-standardized long-term
mortality rate per 1000 person-years was 33 (95% CI, 29–
36) in frail patients and 22 (95% CI, 19–24) in nonfrail patients
(Table 2). Adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrate
lower probabilities of survival in patients who were frail at the
time of surgery (Figure 2).
Table 3 illustrates the multivariable correlates of long-term
mortality. Frailty was correlated with an increased risk of
mortality (adjusted HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.53–1.74). Other
independent mortality correlates were age, socioeconomic
status, and urgent case status. The association of frailty and
long-term mortality remained robust in the sensitivity analy-
ses that accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals
and completeness of revascularization. Incomplete revascu-
larization was associated with a higher risk of long-term
mortality (adjusted HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.20–1.36). Further-
more, the association of frailty and long-term mortality also
remained robust in the sensitivity analysis that controlled for
all comorbidities (Table S2). In this analysis, other indepen-
dent mortality correlates were remote and recent myocardial
infarction,
hypertension,
reduced
EF,
HF,
cerebral
and
peripheral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease,
diabetes mellitus, dialysis, chronic renal disease, anemia,
malignancies, and dementia.
Greater differences in long-term mortality rates between
frail and nonfrail patients were observed in the younger age

 groups
(Table 2). The adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves
in
Figure 3 demonstrated decreasing probability of survival with
increasing age. Frailty contributed to greater differences in
the survival of patients between 40 and 74 years of age and
smaller differences in the long-term survival of those who
were ≥85 years old. When the relative hazard of death was
plotted against age as a continuous variable (Figure 4), an
inverse relationship was again illustrated, such that frailty
posed a higher adjusted risk of mortality in younger patients
and lower impact on older patients. When we explored the
differences in survival by sex within each of the 4 age groups
(Figure 5), we found higher probabilities of long-term survival
in men <75 years of age and in women ≥75 years of age.
Discussion
This population-based study found a high prevalence of frailty
in patients undergoing CABG and higher early and long-term
mortality rates in these patients. Three main findings were
derived from this study. (1) The burden of frailty was markedly
higher in patients undergoing CABG (22%) compared with
patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery (3%) during a
similar time period in Ontario.5 (2) Frail patients had lower
probabilities of early and long-term survival compared with
their nonfrail counterparts. This difference in survival was
more evident in the younger age groups (<75 years). (3) The
adjusted long-term frailty-related mortality risk was inversely
proportional to age.
Burden of Frailty in Patients Undergoing CABG
Frailty is a syndrome prevalent in the geriatric population that
does not have a universally accepted definition. The different
measures of frailty include physical phenotype,37 clinical
functional assessments,22 and functional assessments in
combination with disability or laboratory values; these have all
been studied in the general population.7 The prevalence of
frailty assessed by physical phenotype is 9.9% and 13.6%

 reported.38 These diverse ranges likely reflect the diversity of
frailty instruments used, the poor correlation between instru-
ments, and the differences in the prevalence of frailty by age
and surgery type. The present study used the Johns Hopkins
ACG frailty-defining diagnoses indicator and found that the
prevalence of frailty was 22% in patients undergoing CABG
≥40 years of age, which is in keeping with the ranges
described for other cardiac surgery cohorts. It is, however,
markedly higher than the 3.1% prevalence found in a
contemporary Ontario noncardiac surgery cohort (2002–
2012) aged ≥65 years using the same ACG indicator.5 This
higher prevalence of frailty in cardiac surgery patients most
likely reflects the higher proportion of medically complex
patients presenting for cardiac versus noncardiac surgery.
Frail patients are more likely to experience procedural failure,
complications, and worsening frailty after the hospitalization39
that is common after CABG. Our findings highlight the need
for comprehensive risk stratification tools to optimize the
patient selection process and to facilitate patient-centered
discussions on treatment options.
Frailty and Perioperative Risk Stratification
Clinicians often struggle to quantify the perioperative risk of
morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, because tools such
as the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk and the European
System for Cardiac Operation Risk Evaluation were not
designed to comprehensively assess the complex interaction
between comorbidities and biological versus physiological
age. The European System for Cardiac Operation Risk
Evaluation II has been shown to overestimate mortality in
isolated patients undergoing CABG,40 whereas the Society of
Thoracic Surgeons score underestimates it.13 However, the
incorporation of a frailty score into such risk models has been
shown to improve model discrimination.14,23,24 The high
burden of frailty in patients undergoing CABG accentuates the
need for further research to validate these more inclusive risk
scores in larger population-based cohorts and for prospective
trials guided by these new scores to determine whether
alternative revascularization strategies (eg, percutaneous
coronary intervention) and/or comprehensive preoperative
nutritional, psychological support, and physical conditioning
programs would improve outcomes in frail patients.41–43
Frailty and Mortality
To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study to describe
the long-term outcomes of frailty in patients undergoing CABG
surgery. Frailty has been studied in the cardiac surgery
literature using a variety of definitions. A Veteran Affairs

 report on 11 815 patients undergoing CABG described an
intermediate-term mortality HR of 2.4 (95% CI, 1.6–3.7) at 31
to 210 days for patients who had totally dependent functional
status and an HR of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1–1.9) for partially
dependent individuals.44 The second largest frail-related study
in cardiac surgery patients was based on a single center
cohort of 3826 patients.1 This study found frailty to be
associated with an increased risk of mortality in hospital
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0) and at 2 years
(adjusted HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.2). We found an HR of 1.6
(95% CI, 1.5–1.7) associated with frailty at longer follow-up of
4�2 years. Our effect size is similar to those published in the
literature, and our findings suggest that although frailty had a
larger impact on short-term mortality,1 its adverse impact
remained robust in long-term follow-up. In addition, the wide
range of published prevalence and frailty-related mortality risk
is likely because of the differences in frailty instruments used.
A systematic review of 8 studies directly comparing 9
different frailty instruments used in cardiac surgery cohorts
noted that the multicomponent instruments provided better
mortality risk prediction, despite poorer discrimination than
their abbreviated single-domain counterparts.3 The Johns
Hopkins ACG frailty indicator is a comprehensive tool that
provides a multidimensional snapshot of a patient’s physical
status and is able to predict the risk of long-term mortality in
this cohort of patients undergoing CABG.
Our finding of the modifying effect of age in the association
between frailty and mortality corroborated other contempo-
rary population-based reports in Ontario.5 This frailty-age
interaction has otherwise not been well defined in the
literature. Frailty has traditionally been described as a
syndrome of elderly people.45 In our study, the presence of
frailty-defining diagnoses was a stronger predictor of mortality
in younger patients. Our findings highlight the importance of
concepts of “physiological” versus “biological” aging in the
prognosis of patients. This finding may also reflect the limited
life expectancy regardless of frailty status in those ≥85 years
of age and/or possibly the limited discriminative ability of the
John’s Hopkins frailty indicator in this advanced age group
because of the existence of many comorbidities in this age
group that overlap with components of this frailty indicator.
Further studies are needed to explore the validity of different
frailty instruments in a variety of age groups.
Consistent with other reports,1,13 sex was not an inde-
pendent predictor of long-term mortality in our pooled
analysis. However, our adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots (Figure 5)

 demonstrated a higher probability of long-term survival in men
<75 years of age and in women ≥75 years of age. Further
studies are needed to explore the sex differences in the
prognosis of patients undergoing CABG and means to improve
outcomes in women and men.
Weaknesses and Strengths
This study has several limitations. First, the prevalence and
outcomes of frailty are representative of perioperative prac-
tices in Ontario. Similar research needs to be conducted in
other settings to confirm the generalizability of our findings.
However, during the study period, 38% of the Canadian
population46 resided in Ontario, and our universal healthcare
system allowed for unbiased representation from diverse
demographic groups. Second, our data sources lacked some
relevant detailed physiologic measures of physical and
nutritional frailty, such as the 5-minute walk test, grip
strength, albumin,47 liver function, creatinine, and brain
natriuretic peptide.24 The inability to measure, and thereby
adjust for, differences in such characteristics could have
explained, in part, the differences in mortality rates observed
in this study. Despite this shortcoming, our capture of
covariate information was based on validated algorithms
within high-quality administrative databases, which were
complemented by detailed patient-level data from the robust
CorHealth Ontario provincial registry. Our CABG cohort was
well defined using valid procedural codes that were cross
validated with the CorHealth Ontario registry records,48 and
our ascertainment of mortality was based on province-wide
vital statistics data, ensuring complete follow-up for all
patients. Third, the binary Johns Hopkins ACG frailty-defining
diagnoses indicator did not allow for outcome assessment at
different levels of frailty. However, this indicator is also an
externally validated multidimensional method for characteriz-
ing frailty that has been used in high-impact population-based
studies of frailty-related outcomes using a similar set of
Ontario administrative databases.5,8 Finally, cohort studies
are by nature subjected to residual confounding. However, our
study was the largest to date to describe the long-term
outcomes of frail patients. In addition, the inclusion of
candidates undergoing a single low-risk cardiac procedure
allowed for the examination of the frailty-mortality relation-
ship without the interfering effect of surgical complexity.
Conclusions
Frailty was present in a disproportionate number of patients
undergoing CABG compared with major noncardiac surgery.
Frailty was independently associated with long-term mortality.
More important, the adjusted risk of frailty-related death was
inversely proportional to age, such that frailty was a stronger

 predictor of long-term mortality in those <75 years of age. Our
findings highlight the need for more comprehensive preoper-
ative risk stratification models to assist with optimal selection
of operative candidates. In addition, the subgroup of younger
patients who are frail may benefit most from preoperative
optimization programs, such as cardiac prehabilitation, nutri-
tional augmentation, and psychosocial support.41–43
