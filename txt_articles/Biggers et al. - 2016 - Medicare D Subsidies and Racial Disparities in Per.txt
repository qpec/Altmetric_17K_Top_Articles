Purpose
To investigate the role of out-of-pocket cost supports through the Medicare Part D Low-Income
Subsidy on disparities in breast cancer hormonal therapy persistence and adherence by race or
ethnicity.
Methods
A nationwide cohort of women age $ 65 years with a breast cancer operation between 2006 and
2007 and at least one prescription filled for oral breast cancer hormonal therapy was identified from
all Medicare D enrollees. The association of race or ethnicity with nonpersistence (90 consecutive
days with no claims for a hormonal therapy prescription) and nonadherence (medication possession
rate , 80%) was examined. Survival analyses were used to account for potential differences in age,
comorbidity, or intensity of other treatments.
Results
Among the 25,111 women in the study sample, 77% of the Hispanic and 70% of the black women
received a subsidy compared with 21% of the white women. By 2 years, 69% of black and 70% of
Hispanic patients were persistent compared with 61% of white patients. In adjusted analyses,
patients in all three unsubsidized race or ethnicity groups had greater discontinuation than sub-
sidized groups (white patients: hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.70 to 1.95; black patients: HR, 2.09;
95% CI, 1.73 to 2.51; Hispanic patients: HR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.37 to 3.89). Racial or ethnic persistence
disparities that were present for unsubsidized patients were not present or reversed among
subsidized patients. All three subsidized race or ethnicity groups also had higher adherence than all
three unsubsidized groups, although with the smallest difference occurring in black women.
Conclusion
Receipt of a prescription subsidy was associated with substantially improved persistence to breast
cancer hormonal therapy among white, black, and Hispanic women and lack of racial or ethnic
disparities in persistence. Given high subsidy enrollment among black and Hispanic women, policies
targeted at low-income patients have the potential to also substantially reduce racial and ethnic
disparities.

INTRODUCTION
Although breast cancer has historically been most
common among white women, black women and
women with low socioeconomic status have higher
mortality from breast cancer. Between 2007 and
2011, the breast cancer mortality rate in black
women was 31 per 100,000 compared with 22 per
100,000 for white women.1 Differences in health
care and access, particularly in timely detection of
cancer and treatment quality, seem to explain a
substantial part of these mortality disparities.2,3
Socioeconomic status also affects health care
quality and is strongly associated with poorer
outcomes in nearly all cancers.3
Some disparities in breast cancer outcomes
may be attributable to the high cost of breast cancer
adjuvant hormonal (endocrine) therapy. Although
adjuvant hormonal therapy for hormone-positive
breast cancer reduces 15-year mortality by more
than one third,4 one third to one half of patients
do not take all doses,5-7 substantially reducing
treatment effectiveness. Some studies8,9 show that

taken out of the number of doses prescribed) and

 nonpersistence (early discontinuation) are substantially higher in black
women5,10,11 and women with low incomes.10,11 Little is known about
adherence or persistence among Hispanic women.12 Despite several
recent studies that also link lack of insurance coverage or higher patient
copays for the newer, more effective aromatase inhibitors with non-
adherenceordiscontinuation,10,11,13there hasbeenlittlestudyoftheeffect
of interventions that reduce patient out-of-pocket costs on disparities.
The Medicare Part D legislation’s Low-Income Subsidy pro-
gram offers a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a policy
targeting greater financial supports to low-income and low-asset
patients on disparities in cancer care. Medicare D provides all en-
rolled patients with pharmaceutical coverage through privately
administered plans with distinct Part D premiums, deductibles, and
copays and a substantial coverage gap during which enrollees pay the
full cost of medication. For many low-income and low–net worth
patients, the federal government’s subsidy program eliminates or
substantially reduces these additional premiums, deductibles, and
copays and eliminates the coverage gap. Patients either are auto-
matically enrolled onto this Medicare D Low-Income Subsidy pro-
gram or apply for the subsidy by demonstrating low assets and
income. We hypothesized that recipients of the Medicare D Low-
Income Subsidy would have similar hormonal therapy persistence
and adherence as patients who did not receive the subsidy. We further
hypothesized that the differences in adherence for black and Hispanic
women compared with white women seen in some earlier studies
would be smaller among subsidized recipients.
METHODS
Study Sample
To identify a potentially eligible sample of women with breast cancer,
we applied a previously validated claims-based prediction algorithm14 to
administrative claims from the Medicare program. Women considered for
inclusion were required to be age $ 65 years with a breast cancer operation
identified by the algorithm in calendar years 2006 and 2007. To allow
ascertainment of comorbidities and treatments, the women were also
required to have been enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B and not enrolled
in a Medicare Advantage plan for 12 months before breast cancer surgery
and were required to be enrolled in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan
(stand-alone Part D plan) at the time of their cancer operation. All eligible
women also had at least one prescription filled for oral breast cancer
hormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen through
Medicare D within 1 year of breast cancer surgery.
Cohort members were further limited to women of white or black
race or Hispanic ethnicity on the basis of Medicare file designation.
Medicare race and ethnicity designations are initially self-reported at the
time individuals apply for a Social Security number or replacement Social
Security card. Because before 1994 people were limited to choices of white,
black, or other, Medicare race and ethnicity information was edited by
Medicare in 1997 on the basis of results of a survey of nearly 2.2 million
people with Hispanic surnames and then, in 2005, with Asian and Hispanic
surname-based imputation.15 The positive predictive value for white,
black, and Hispanic race or ethnicity is now estimated at greater than 92%;
because the positive predictive value is lower for other races and the total
numbers of patients of other races were small,15 we excluded them from
the study.
Measures of Prescription Use
Medicare D Prescription Drug Event files were used to determine
patients’ pharmaceutical use. These files included variables for dispensed
medications’ National Drug Code, the date and quantity dispensed, and
medication charges paid to the pharmacy by the prescription drug plan and
the beneficiary. Using the quantity of medication dispensed, we counted
the number of pills of tamoxifen or any of the three aromatase inhibitors
(all once-daily medications) received between the first prescription and
July 2010, when generic aromatase inhibitors substantially altered pat-
terns.10 Because a large number of participants received 90-day pre-
scriptions, all pill counts were assessed by 90-day time periods. When
a medication was dispensed before the previous prescription would have
run out, the new prescription was assumed to start the day after the
previous prescription should have ended, to account for stockpiled pills.16
Nonpersistence (or discontinuation) was defined as 90 consecutive days
with no claims for a hormonal therapy prescription. Adherence was de-
fined using a medication possession rate (MPR) for each quarter. Similar to
other studies11,17,18 and consistent with a study of the association between
aromatase inhibitors and mortality,19 patients with an MPR of less than
0.80 (or 80%) were defined as nonadherent. Patients who switched from
one medication to another were considered to be persistent and adherent
throughout the time period during which they possessed pills of any type.
The Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy
Medicare’s Low-Income Subsidy is recorded on Medicare files
monthly with similar eligibility thresholds in all states and slight increases
each year. A full subsidy is automatically provided to patients enrolled in
Medicaid, a Medicare A/B Savings Program, or the Supplemental Security
Income program and persons with income less than 135% of the federal
poverty line with low assets (Appendix Table A1, online only). Other
individuals with income less than 150% of the federal poverty line and low
assets were eligible to apply for partial subsidies (Appendix Table A1).
Other Covariates
Other covariates included age at the time of surgery as recorded on
Medicare files. Comorbidity score20 was based on the year before surgery,
and total number of other medications was defined as the number of
unique medications filled in the first quarter of hormonal therapy use. To
account for expected reductions in adherence with increasing treatment
duration,5,17 time since medication initiation was calculated. Socioeco-
nomic status was estimated from US census data from the median per
capita income and percentage of high school graduates among adults in the
participant’s ZIP code.21,22 The Medicare D coverage gap (for unsubsidized
patients) was defined as any month in which the patient had been in the
coverage gap for at least the prior 60 days.
Analyses
Hormonal therapy persistence and adherence rates, as defined earlier,
were computed for each 90-day period between the patient’s medication
start date and July 2010. Descriptive statistics were used for demographics
and other baseline variables, and differences in these variables by race or
ethnicity were examined. Kaplan-Meier curves were first used to examine
unadjusted differences in persistence by race or ethnicity, receipt of
a subsidy, and the six subsidy-race combinations. Disenrollment from
a Medicare D prescription drug plan (n = 389), death (n = 1,569), and end
of study (n = 11,664) were treated as censoring events. In developing
adjusted models, we tested whether predictor variables met the pro-
portional hazards assumption. Because the assumption was not met for
age, number of medications, and chemotherapy use, all models were
stratified by these covariates. Race or ethnicity also violated the as-
sumption, and there was an interaction between race or ethnicity and the
Low-Income Subsidy. Therefore, we used a model with a time-dependent
relationship between race or ethnicity and discontinuation, including the
interaction term. Time axis was broken into the following three windows:
0 to 5 months, 5 to 35 months, and greater than 35 months after diagnosis.
In a second set of adjusted models, we also examined adjusted
differences in 90-day average probability of adherence (MPR $ 80%) by

Subsidies and Disparities in Adherence to Hormone Therapy
 race or ethnicity during time periods in which patients remained persistent
with their medications. For these patients, we used logistic regression
models with generalized estimating equations (Proc Genmod in SAS
Version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to control for expected within-patient
temporal correlation in adherence.
In sensitivity analyses, we first explored several different specifica-
tions for the Low-Income Subsidy variable. Few patients changed subsidy
status during the study, so use of subsidy as a time-varying covariate would
not have changed our results. In initial models, results did not differ for
patients who had partial versus full subsidies (Appendix Table A1), so
subsidy status was included as yes or no for all models. Finally, we explored
how much any subsidy effect(s) on adherence could be attributed to
elimination of the coverage gap.
RESULTS
The cohort included 25,511 patients observed for a median of
2.2 years of hormonal therapy. Compared with both black and
Hispanic women, non-Hispanic white women were older, had
fewer comorbidities, and were more likely to reside in rural ZIP
codes and ZIP codes with higher per-capita income and edu-
cational attainment (all P , .001; Table 1). Although 27% of the
cohort overall received the Low-Income Subsidy, this varied
substantially by race or ethnicity, with 77% of the Hispanic
women and 70% of the black women receiving a subsidy,
compared with 21% of the non-Hispanic white women.
Persistence
More than 77% of the total cohort persisted (continued) on
hormonal therapy at 1 year after the initial prescription, and 64%
persisted at 2 years. As shown in the first of the series of Kaplan-
Meier curves (Fig 1A), in unadjusted analyses, black and Hispanic
women were more persistent with medication (P , .001 by log-
rank test) than white women throughout much of the study period,
and by 2 years, 69% of black patients and 70% of Hispanic patients
were persistent compared with 61% of white patients.
The differences in persistence by subsidy receipt were also
large (Fig 1B). In analyses stratified by subsidy and race or eth-
nicity, subsidized women in all three race or ethnicity groups had
higher persistence than unsubsidized women in any group (Fig 1C
and Table 2). Table 2 lists, within each race by subsidy group, the
times by which 25% of the group discontinued hormonal therapy.
Within the unsubsidized group, 25% of white women discontinued
therapy by 12 months, whereas the corresponding time period was
9 months for black women and 10 months for Hispanic women.
Within the subsidized group, 25% discontinuation times were
24 months for white and black women and 29 months for Hispanic
women.
When analyses were adjusted for all other covariates including
socioeconomic variables, not having a subsidy was associated with
an increased likelihood (hazard) of discontinuation for women in
all three race or ethnicity groups through 35 months, with a hazard
ratio (HR) from 1.6 to 3.0 for all groups (Table 3 and Appendix Fig
A1, online only). Furthermore, among unsubsidized women, there
were statistically significant disparities in discontinuation (com-
pared with white women) for black women during the first
5 months (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68) and for Hispanic
women between 5 and 35 months (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.58;
Appendix Table A2 and Appendix Fig A2, online only). In contrast,
among subsidized women, disparities were either not present or,
for Hispanic women between 5 and 35 months (HR, 0.80; 95% CI,
0.68 to 0.95), actually reversed. Detailed description of results over
time and differences between Hispanic and black women is
provided in the Appendix (online only).
Adherence
During the time periods in which patients persisted on
hormonal therapy, there was no difference in the unadjusted
probability of adherence (MPR $ 80%) by racial or ethnic group.
However, the probability of adherence was substantially higher
among subsidized than unsubsidized patients (odds ratio, 1.30;

 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.35). Similar to the persistence analyses, both
unadjusted comparisons of the six subsidy-race groups and an
adjusted model (Appendix Table A3, online only) showed that
subsidized women in all three race or ethnicity groups had higher
adherence than all three unsubsidized groups. However, the size of
the effect varied by race (P for interaction = .02), with the smallest
effect among black women.
To further illustrate adherence differences between groups, we
computed model-based (adjusted) probabilities of adherence. As
shown in Appendix Table A4 (online only), an average of 80.0% of
unsubsidized women were adherent, whereas 84.1% of subsidized
women were adherent, but the differences between unsubsidized
and subsidized women varied by race. Because the structure of the
Medicare D program required unsubsidized patients to pay a much
higher proportion of their medications once they passed a coverage
gap (donut hole), we also examined potential differences in subsidy
effects during time periods where patients were in the Medicare D
coverage gap. The probability of adherence was 2.7% lower overall
(ranging from 2.5% to 3.0% among the three race or ethnicity
groups) for unsubsidized patients during the coverage gap.
DISCUSSION
In this national cohort of older Medicare enrollees with breast
cancer, the majority of black and Hispanic women received the
Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy. Unsubsidized women were
60% to 200% more likely to discontinue hormonal therapy in the
first 35 months compared with the Low-Income Subsidy recipients
of the same race or ethnicity. This was the case even after

Subsidies and Disparities in Adherence to Hormone Therapy
 adjustment for socioeconomic status of their residence. In addi-
tion, there were racial and ethnic disparities in persistence among
unsubsidized patients that were not present or were actually re-
versed among the subsidized patients.
Our study’s findings regarding the relatively large difference in
persistence and adherence between subsidized and unsubsidized
women are consistent with large reductions in out-of-pocket costs
for aromatase inhibitors with the subsidy. In an earlier study in
a similar Medicare D sample, we reported 90-day median out-of-
pocket costs of $106 to $183 for unsubsidized patients on the
aromatase inhibitor anastrozole compared with less than $10 for
patients with a subsidy.10 In another breast cancer study that
included commercially insured patients, persistence was 18% to
28% lower in patients who paid more than $90 for a 90-day
medication supply. In survey studies, patients report that cancer
treatments are large financial burdens,23 causing them to sell assets
or declare bankruptcy. They also report delaying or forgoing medical
care, including prescription refills.24,25
Our study adds to earlier work through our policy-relevant
finding that the poor patients who received Medicare D subsidies
had higher persistence than unsubsidized patients, who, on av-
erage, have substantially higher income and assets. There has been
surprisingly little evidence in oncology that there are larger effects
of cost-reducing policies for lower income than higher income
patients,26 perhaps in part because such studies would have to
contend with the potentially larger impact of small copays on low-
income patients. For example, even copays of $1 to $3 have been
shown to reduce use of and adherence to medications among
Medicaid cohorts.27-29 Nonetheless, our findings regarding the
subsidy benefits for patients overall are consistent with other recent
studies in noncancer Medicare D populations, none of which
reported results by race or ethnicity, in which subsidy recipients
had higher adherence to medications for chronic conditions.17,30,31
This study’s findings regarding the presence of racial and
ethnic disparities in persistence among unsubsidized patients and
the absence of these disparities (or even, for Hispanic women,
reversal) among low-income subsidized patients are, to our
knowledge, novel. These findings suggest that income- and net
worth–based subsidies can benefit patients of all races or ethnicities
at least equally and may even benefit nonwhite (particularly
Hispanic) women more. These findings are consistent with an
earlier study, in which black women with commercial insurance

 were 24% less likely to be adherent than white women even after
accounting for a number of nonfinancial factors, but when ad-
justment was made for net worth and copays, racial differences
were no longer significant.32 Our study adds an important element
to that earlier work, because their reports of an association between
net worth and adherence and the relationships between race and
net worth did not guarantee that low-income patients provided
with a subsidy would adhere up to the level of higher income
patients. Barriers such as poor transportation and lack of social
capital play larger roles among populations with lower income and
would not necessarily be improved with reductions in out-of-
pocket costs.33 Furthermore, low-income and nonwhite patients
have been shown to encounter more communication barriers and
to be treated at lower quality hospitals.34 Despite these other
potential barriers, our results regarding the lack of racial or ethnic
persistence disparities among subsidized patients, coupled with the
high enrollment in subsidies by patients of color, suggest that
subsidies on the basis of economic status have the potential to
reduce racial or ethnic disparities.
Our study had several limitations. The study was observa-
tional, and it is possible that factors other than costs differed
between subsidy recipients and nonrecipients. However, on the
basis of prior studies, most such factors (eg, transportation dif-
ficulties, greater sensitivities to small copays) would be expected to
bias in the opposite direction of our findings. Although our ad-
herence findings were generally similar to our findings for dis-
continuation, the smaller effect of the subsidy for black patients
raises concerns that improvement for populations overall could
actually increase some disparities. Given the importance of dis-
parities in breast cancer, this should be explored further in future
studies. Our cohort was identified through an initial prescription
for an aromatase inhibitor, and we could not examine the pre-
viously described disparities in initial use.34 Although MPRs highly
correlate with adherence rates,10 they are an imperfect proxy for
actual use. We did not have information on either reasons for
discontinuation or the stages of patients’ cancers. We have pre-
viously shown that nearly all of the patients are likely to have stage I
to III disease given that patients with stage IVare less likely to have
surgery.14 Finally, we were limited to ZIP code–level variables for
socioeconomic status. Because our entitlement-identified patients
actually had better persistence than a group made up of mostly
wealthier patients, future studies should examine individual-level
socioeconomic status to better understand the complex in-
teractions between race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and
medication use.
Our study supports the potential for policy interventions to
improve equity in cancer outcomes. The substantially higher
persistence and adherence among women of all three race or
ethnicity groups enrolled onto the Medicare D Low-Income
Subsidy should lead to further efforts to ensure all eligible
women are enrolled. Furthermore, legislative and advocacy efforts
should focus on lowering out-of-pocket costs for younger women.
Given the high costs of oral oncologic and supportive medications,
the impact on disparities of other initiatives to reduce out-of-
pocket costs deserves urgent study.

 Appendix
Persistence Models and Their Results
The association of persistence with race or ethnicity and income status was assessed in a survival model (Table 3) that used
interaction terms between those variables. Therefore, the effect of the interaction term from this same model is shown as either
a hazard ratio of discontinuation (without v with subsidy) for each race or ethnic group (Table 3 and Appendix Fig A1) or a hazard
ratio between two racial or ethnic groups (eg, discontinuation hazards for blacks v whites) within each subsidy status (Appendix
Fig A2 and Table A2).
Results for the discontinuation time periods of 0 to 5 and 5 to 35 months, as shown in these tables and figures, are similar to
each other except for the differences noted in the main text. In summary, among women without a subsidy, black women were more
likely than white women to discontinue treatment in months 0 to 5, and Hispanics were more likely to discontinue treatment during
months 5 to 35. Among women with a subsidy, Hispanic women were less likely to discontinue treatment than white women during
months 5 to 35. After 35 months, however, discontinuation differed by subsidy status only for white women (although CIs were
large). Furthermore, after 35 months, there were no differences by race or ethnicity in discontinuation either in subsidized or
unsubsidized women. Comparisons between black and Hispanic women for all time periods showed no clinically or statistically
significant differences.

NOTE. Table is adapted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and applies to patients who are not automatically enrolled onto Medicare Part D.
Percentage is the greater of the low-income benchmark premium amount or the lowest prescription drug plan premium for the basic coverage of the region. Category A
represents a full subsidy. A full subsidy is automatically provided to patients enrolled onto Medicaid, a Medicare A/B Savings Program, or the Supplemental Security
Income Program, and persons with income less than 135% of the federal poverty line with low assets are also eligible to apply for full subsidies. During the study period,
full subsidies covered the full cost of the monthly premium and the annual deductible and lowered monthly copays to $1.10 to $2.20 for preferred drugs and to $2.40 to
$6.50 for nonpreferred drugs. Partial subsidies reduced premiums and annual deductibles by a sliding scale and also reduced coinsurance costs to 15% or less of the total
cost.
