Abstract
Introduction: We assessed the feasibility and cognitive effects of a ketogenic diet (KD) in partici-
pants with Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: The Ketogenic Diet Retention and Feasibility Trial featured a 3-month, medium-chain tri-
glyceride–supplemented KD followed by a 1-month washout in clinical dementia rating (CDR) 0.5,
1, and 2 participants. We obtained urine acetoacetate, serum b-hydroxybutyrate, food record, and
safety data. We administered the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and
Mini–Mental State Examination before the KD, and following the intervention and washout.
Results: We enrolled seven CDR 0.5, four CDR 1, and four CDR 2 participants. One CDR 0.5 and all
CDR 2 participants withdrew citing caregiver burden. The 10 completers achieved ketosis. Most
adverse events were medium-chain triglyceride–related. Among the completers, the mean of the Alz-
heimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score improved by 4.1 points during the diet
(P 5 .02) and reverted to baseline after the washout.
Discussion: This pilot trial justifies KD studies in mild Alzheimer’s disease.

1. Introduction
Aberrant energy metabolism occurs in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) animal models and patients [1]. It manifests as perturbed
mitochondrial function and structure as well as during fluoro-
deoxyglucosepositronemissiontomographyevaluations.Flu-
orodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography reveals focal
reductions in brain glucose utilization with advancing age
[2,3], which extend in magnitude and distribution during
AD [4,5]. Neuron loss, synaptic degradation, or bona fide
bioenergetic changes could contribute to this, although
changes in asymptomatic subjects with AD risk factors
suggest
that
bona
fide
changes
exist
[6–8].
Brain
homogenates of AD subjects also show less glucose
consumption than control homogenates [9], even though ho-
mogenization disrupts synapses and neutralizes their impact;
persistence of reduced glucose flux in homogenates suggests
that diminished synaptic connectivity does not exclusively ac-
count for reduced AD glucose utilization.

 In AD, targeting bioenergetic defects and decreased
glucose utilization for therapeutic purposes is reasonable
[10]. One potential approach includes the ketogenic diet
(KD). KDs increase fat and reduce carbohydrate con-
sumption [11]. This reduces insulin, which stimulates
liver oxidation of fatty acids to ketone bodies (b-hydrox-
ybutyrate [BHB], acetoacetate, and acetone) that enter the
blood. BHB and acetoacetate access the brain and fuel
respiration [12]. Acetone also circulates, it may access
the brain, and ventilation facilitates its excretion. Given
a choice between ketone bodies and glucose, neurons
preferentially consume ketone bodies [13–15]. Although
brain glucose utilization declines in AD, ketone body
utilization does not [16].
Here, we considered the previously proposed question
[17] of whether a KD can benefit cognition in AD.
Although studies report that ketosis-like diets improve
memory in cognitively intact or mild cognitive impairment
participants [18–20] and that a simple medium chain
triglyceride (MCT)-induced ketosis may improve AD
cognition [21,22], whether a true KD affects cognition in
actual AD patients or is even feasible remains unclear.
Adding to the relevance of this question, KDs differ from
MCT-limited approaches in terms of ketone body pharma-
cokinetics, dietary fat intake, insulin signaling effects, and
inflammation effects. We therefore tested the feasibility of
maintaining AD participants on a KD and acquired prelim-
inary insight into how a KD affects cognition in AD
participants.
2. Methods
2.1. Overall study design and recruitment
The Ketogenic Diet Retention and Feasibility Trial
(KDRAFT) was a single-arm, pilot clinical study with a
target enrollment of 15 participants with AD. The protocol
required participants to maintain an MCT-supplemented
KD for 3 months and immediately on completing this inter-
vention to discontinue that diet and resume a normal diet for
1 month (thereby defining a 1-month washout period).
Because from a calorie intake perspective our diet increased
dietary fat consumption and added MCT to offset lowered
carbohydrate consumption, to distinguish our diet from a
low-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted KD we herein refer to
our diet intervention as a very high-fat KD (VHF-KD).
To recruit for this trial, we first identified potential partic-
ipants from a registry database maintained by the University
of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center. Then, we informed
potential participants about the study opportunity through
one of two approaches. One approach used letters or phone
calls to initiate discussion of this opportunity. Alternatively,
we invited potential participants to a KD cooking demon-
stration at the University of Kansas (KU) Clinical Research
Center Demonstration Kitchen and used this event to initiate
discussion of the research opportunity.
2.2. Participants
The participants met McKhann et al. criteria for AD [23].
Individuals were eligible to participate in the study if they
had a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of very mild AD
(CDR 0.5), mild AD (CDR 1), or moderate AD (CDR 2).
No clinically significant electrolyte, renal, or liver function
abnormalities, a body mass index (BMI) � 21 kg/m2, En-
glish mastery, and an active study partner were also required.
Exclusion criteria included serious medical risks including
type 1 diabetes, ongoing or recent cancer, a cardiac event
in the past year, or other conditions deemed serious risks
by physicians on the study team. The KU Medical Center’s
Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. Informed
consent was obtained from all study participants as per insti-
tutional guidelines.
2.3. The VHF-KD intervention and dietary intake
evaluations
Participants received nutrition counseling from the study
dietitian at the baseline study visit. Targeted macronutrient
composition for the dietary intervention included approxi-
mately 70% of energy as fat (including the MCT), 20% of en-
ergy as protein, and restriction of carbohydrate to less than
10% of energy; we sought a ketogenic ratio of 1:1 (ratio of
lipid consumption in grams to nonlipid consumption in
grams) or better. Energy intake requirement and targeted
daily MCT dosage was estimated using the Mifflin-St. Jeor
equation [24]. A monthly supply of MCT oil (Now Foods,
USA), which contained a combination of C8:0 and C10:0
fatty acids, was provided at each study visit. In general, the
MCT dosage provided approximately 10% of total energy
from fat during the first week and increased by increments
of 10% during each successive week until reaching 40%,
while allowing for titration adjustments based on participant
tolerance. Participants could choose to consume the MCT
neat or mix it with food or beverages. We provided daily
multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus supple-
ments to help preventmicronutrient deficiencies. On comple-
tion of the VHF-KD, participants were instructed to return to
a normal diet to complete a 1-month washout period.
2.4. Objectives and outcomes
Our primary objective was to address the feasibility of
implementing a VHF-KD intervention in AD participants.
Secondary objectives included evaluating the effects of a
VHF-KD on cognition.
2.4.1. Dietary assessment
At the baseline visit, the study dietitian provided instruc-
tions to the participant’s study partner for completing 3-day
food records (3DFRs). Each 3DFR recorded intake for two
weekdays and one weekend day. We entered 3DFR data
into the Nutrition Data System for Research (version
2016) to analyze nutrient intake. We collected 3DFRs

29
 immediately after the baseline visit (just before starting the
diet); at months 1, 2, and 3; and during washout visits to
characterize dietary intake before, during, and after the die-
tary intervention.
2.4.2. Biomarker, safety, and anthropometric assessments
Participants self-monitored urine ketones daily, in the
early evening, using urine acetoacetate test strips (Ketostix,
Bayer, Germany). Daily urine ketone status was recorded as
either negative, trace (5–14.9 mg/dL), small (15–39.9
mg/dL), moderate (40–79.9 mg/dL), or large (801 mg/dL)
in a provided diary. Days in which participants did not mea-
sure the ketone levels were conservatively tallied as a “nega-
tive” ketone response.
All serum biomarker and safety lab tests were collected af-
ter a 12-hour fast. Full lipid and metabolic panels were
collected atthe baseline and month3(end ofdietintervention)
visits, and these assays were performed by the KU Hospital
clinical laboratory. Serum electrolytes, renal function tests,
liver function tests, and glucose levels were measured by
the KU Hospital clinical laboratory at the baseline and month
3 visits. Serum BHB and insulin levels were measured at all
visit time points (baseline, month 1, month 2, month 3, and
washout) by the KU Hospital clinical laboratory. Homeostatic
model assessment 2-insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) values
for each participant were calculated using a HOMA2 Calcu-
lator (v. 2.2.3; University of Oxford, United Kingdom).
At each visit, we queried the participants and their care part-
ners for adverse symptoms. Also at each visit, we further
encouraged the participants and their care partners to contact
the study dietitian for any symptoms or medical complaints
they thought might relate to their participation in the study.
As part of an additional safety measure, participants received
baseline and month 1, 2, and 3 electrocardiogram assessments.
Height, weight, and body composition were measured for
all subjects. BMI (kg/m2) was calculated using weight and
height measurements. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
was used to attain and quantify body fat percentage, lean
body mass, fat mass, and bone mass at baseline and month 3.
2.4.3. Cognitive testing
A trained psychometrician administered the Mini–Mental
State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer’s Disease
Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) at baseline,
at the end of the intervention (month 3), and after the 1-month
washout. The MMSE is a brief, 30-point questionnaire de-
signed to identify cognitive impairment. The ADAS-cog con-
sists of 11 tasks that measure changes in memory, language,
praxis, and attention. Total incorrect answers and cued re-
minders are reported as the cumulative score, thus higher
scores on the ADAS-cog reflect greater cognitive impairment.
2.5. Statistical analyses
Continuous variables were described using their means
and standard deviations. Descriptive statistics were utilized
to quantify and characterize feasibility of the intervention.
Normality of the dependent variables was assessed through
Q-Q visualization of residual models. Paired t-tests were
used to analyze differences in dietary macronutrient intake
before and during the diet intervention. We constructed
linear mixed models and tested mean differences with
post-hoc pairwise comparisons for cognitive data and serum
biomarkers, with the exception of serum BHB where resid-
ual assessment indicated the use of Friedman tests with Con-
over post-hoc pairwise comparisons. Statistical analyses
were performed using R (v. 3.3.2; R Foundation, Vienna,
Austria). Statistical tests were two-tailed, and significance
was set at P , .05. For the cognition analysis, our null hy-
pothesis assumed that a VHF-KD would not affect the cogni-
tive performance of participants with AD.
3. Results
Fifteen participants enrolled in the study over a 31-month
period (December 2013–July 2016). The mean age and educa-
tion levels were 73.1 6 9.0 and 15.0 6 2.7 years, respectively.
Seven were male. To enroll these 15 participants, we contacted
298 individuals. During the first 19 months, 72 potential partic-
ipants were contacted by the study coordinator via letter or
phone call, and nine enrolled in the study. From months 20
through 31, we invited 185 participants, by letter, to one of
twodifferentketogeniccookingdemonstrationsattheKUClin-
ical Research Center Demonstration Kitchen. Thirty-eight total
potential participants attended one of two cooking demonstra-
tions; attendance was limited by space limitations and not by
invitee interest. These two cooking demonstrations resulted
in the enrollment of six new participants. Supplementary
Figure 1 depicts recruitment and participant flow.
Five participants did not successfully implement the VHF-
KD, withdrew from the study within the first month or shortly
after the first month (dropout rate of 33%), and provided only
baselinedata.Fourofthe dropoutshadmoderateAD(CDR2),
andtheotherhadverymild AD (CDR 0.5) (Table 1). The part-
ners of the participants that withdrew from the study uni-
formly
cited

burden
as
the
reason
for
discontinuing. The remaining 10 participants were compliant
with the VHF-KD intervention, although one participant dis-
continued cholinesterase inhibitor therapy and was therefore
technically protocol noncompliant. This was the only partic-
ipant in whom we documented cognitive decline.
Most participants preferred to mix their MCT oil with
either food or beverages and used this strategy to enhance
MCT tolerability. Participants who completed the interven-
tion generally consumed 1.5–3 tablespoons of MCT oil per
day, which constituted 60–80% of the target MCT volume.
No one reached 100% of the MCT target volume.
Self-reported urine ketone assessments from the 10 com-
pleters revealed each achieved ketosis, although the depth
and consistency of ketosis varied. On average, completers
detected the presence of at least some degree of urine acetoa-
cetate on 54.5 6 29.0 days (60.6%) of the 3-month dietary

 intervention. Forty-nine percent of the positive daily read-
ings were reported as trace, 26% as small, 23% as moderate,
and 2% as large. Fig. 1A summarizes each subject’s urine
ketone data.
Serum BHB levels were significantly elevated at months 1,
2, and 3 compared with that of baseline (0.11 mmol/L at base-
line vs. 0.52, 0.34, and 0.31 mmol/L; P ,.001) (Fig. 1B and
1C) and returned to the normal range at the end of thewashout
period (0.12 mmol/L). Serum BHB results generally seemed
to reflect urine ketone responses with one exception. One par-
ticipant’s (subject 15) urine acetoacetate reached only trace
levels and for just 24.2% of the days on the diet, but
throughout the intervention, serum BHB measurements
showed a relatively robust induction (see Fig. 1A and 1B).
Table 2 shows values for anthropometric measures, serum
biomarkers, safety labs, metabolic measures, and dietary
intake. Preintervention and intraintervention energy intake
values were comparable. During the intervention, total fat
intake increased (fat: 90.6 g vs. 166.7 g; P ,.001), and total
carbohydrate intake was significantly reduced (209.8 g vs.
46.0 g; P , .001). The mean macronutrient proportion dur-
ing the VHF-KD intervention was 73.4% fat, 9% carbohy-
drate, and 17.6% protein as energy.
No serious adverse events occurred. Participant com-
plaints were minor in magnitude and transient, and mostly
limited to MCT-associated diarrhea (in 50%). Weight,
cholesterol, blood glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model
assessment 2-insulin resistance parameters remained stable.
The VHF-KD did not alter electrolyte, renal, or liver func-
tion values. BMI, body fat percentage, and bone mass did
not change. There were no electrocardiogram changes.
We used a linear mixed model with pairwise analysis to
compare cognitive performance at baseline, month 3, and after
the 1-month washout period (Fig. 2). Including all diet
compliant participants (n 5 10), ADAS-cog scores signifi-
cantlychangedfrombaselinetomonth3withameanimprove-
ment of 4.1 points (25.5 vs. 21.4, P 5.02). Excluding the one
protocol noncompliant completer (n 5 9), ADAS-cog scores
changed from baseline to month 3 with a mean improvement
of 5.3 points (26.6 vs. 21.3, P 5 .001). ADAS-cog scores re-
vertedtobaselinefollowingthe1-monthwashoutperiod.After
thewashout period, the mean ADAS-cogscorewas 25.3for all
participants (P 5.09 for the comparison between the 3-month
and the washout values) and also for the protocol compliant
subjects (P 5 .05 for the comparison between the 3 month
and washout values). Excluding the protocol noncompliant
participant, MMSE scores significantly improved from base-
line to month 3 (25.2 vs. 26.3, P 5.05) (Table 3).
4. Discussion
This pilot trial investigated the feasibility of a 3-month
MCT-supplemented KD intervention in AD participants.
The VHF-KD proved feasible in very mild (CDR 0.5) and
mild (CDR 1) participants, as 10 of 11 adapted to a restricted
carbohydrate and augmented fat nutrient pattern, reached the
target macronutrient ratio, demonstrated elevated urine and
serum ketone levels, and completed the intervention. We
cannot generalize this conclusion to moderate (CDR 2) par-
ticipants, though, as all four CDR 2 participants failed to
achieve ketosis and each withdrew from the study. Second-
arily, study completers demonstrated objective improvement
on a cognitive assessment (the ADAS-cog), and this objec-
tive improvement disappeared after a washout period.
Existing literature documents the challenges of enrolling
adults into KD studies [25,26]. Perceptions of the KD border
on undesirable, which make it difficult to recruit participants
via traditional contact methods (i.e. letter, phone call, and
clinic visit). Placing persons with AD on a KD presents an
additional hurdle, as this inevitably contributes to care-
provider burden. Based on our study’s recruitment experience,
we believe that KD studies inadult populations require unique,
interactive strategies to generate participation interest. We
found that KD cooking demonstrations enhanced interest,
altered KD preconceptions, and expedited recruitment.
Participants with more advanced dementia did not comply
with the diet intervention. A priori, one might predict that a
positive correlation could exist between dementia severity
and compliance because dementia severity should also corre-
late inversely with the diversity of food choice requests. In
other words, moderately or severely demented individuals
might generate fewer requests for specific meals or snacks

 than mildly demented individuals. Conversely, dementia
severity also positively correlates with amounts of caregiver
burden [27]. Our KD intervention required study partners to
assume varying degrees of additional responsibility, including
compliancewithcomplex mealpreparationinstructions,MCT
administration, urinary ketone assessment, and food diary
completion. Implementing a relatively complex intervention
such as a KD may have simply overwhelmed the caregivers
of the moderate AD participants. Our data are consistent
with this scenario. It is important to note, though, our impres-
sion that high levels of study partner burden influenced partic-
ipant withdrawal is based on informal, anecdotal study partner
reporting and not on formal measurements of study partner
burden. Future studies of a KD in AD should consider
applying quantitative measurements of caregiver burden.
When the study partner was a male, the dropout rate was
25%, and when the study partner was a female, the dropout
rate was 43%. These percentages are not significantly
different. In general, we could not identify differences be-
tween study partners of participants who did and did not
comply with the intervention. The relatively small size of
this study may account for our inability to identify specific
characteristics that predict compliance.
A higher rate of study withdrawal among those with mod-
erate dementia suggests that KD studies of community-
based AD participants should focus on individuals with
mild and very mild dementia. Studies of moderate or severe
AD may still be possible, but should perhaps consider
limiting the intervention to participants that live in institu-
tional settings (to minimize diet-associated increases in
caregiver burden).
Previously reported KD side effects include constipation,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and hunger [28]. No
participant complained of hunger or fatigue. Some of our
participants did report gastrointestinal side effects, particu-
larly diarrhea. Participants and their care-partners, though,
tended to associate these complaints with MCToil consump-
tion and not the KD itself. Utilization of a flexible MCT titra-
tion protocol, therefore, likely enhanced compliance and
reduced adverse event quality and quantity.
Therewerenoseriousadverse events. Laboratoryand elec-
trocardiogram tests raised no safety concerns. Weights re-
mained stable and there was no loss of bone mass. We
conclude that a VHF-KD is safe in AD, at least over 3 months,
and that persons with AD can maintain and tolerate a VHF-
KD for at least 3 months.
Because of our small sample size and single-arm design,
any interpretation of this study’s cognitive performance data
requires caution. We may parsimoniously state, though, that
a statistically significant improvement in ADAS-cog score
coincident with the diet intervention was observed, which is
consistent with our research hypothesis of diet-associated
changes in this measure. This apparent improvement could
reflect a placebo effect, the expectations of an unblinded psy-
chometrician, participant motivation, or a test–retest effect
although reversion of the ADAS-cog scores after a washout
period argue against the possibility of a test–retest effect.
Only one participant’s ADAS-cog score declined while
following the diet protocol. This participant’s performance
continued to deteriorate for at least 1 month after completing
the KD intervention, so we do not believe that the KD itself
was responsible. Moreover, this participant discontinued
cholinesterase inhibitor therapy shortly after starting the
KD and was therefore technically protocol noncompliant.
We nevertheless included this participant’s data in this report
for completeness and transparency.
The KDRAFT complements other studies that report keto-
genic interventions benefit cognitive performance. A 3-month
duration caloric restriction trial found that CR improved mem-
ory in healthy adults [18]. Although the investigators did not
assess ketone body production, caloric restriction does induce
ketosis
[29].

Although the authors did not formally refer to their
carbohydrate-restricted diet as a KD, they did show that cogni-
tive improvement positively correlated with ketone body
levels. Two studies report that simply consuming an MCT sup-
plement outside of a KD context, which also boosts serum
BHB levels, at least temporarily improves cognition in AD
subjects [21,22]. In a case report, Newport et al. noted
administering a BHB-promoting ketone monoester to an AD
patient coincided with cognitive improvement [30].
KDs and ketone bodies have protean physiologic effects.
KDs can increase ketone body levels and ketone utilization,
reduce brain glucose consumption, lower insulin, alter insu-
lin signaling, increase long- and medium-chain fatty acids,
affect lipid handling, and reduce inflammation [11,31–37].

through which a KD might influence cognition. It does not

 address whether KDs and non-KD ketogenic interventions
are functionally or therapeutically interchangeable.
Because of the KDRAFT’s exploratory nature, small size,
and single-arm structure, we cannot definitively conclude
that a KD benefits AD patients. Feasibility and efficacy
data from this 3-month pilot trial, though, justify further
studies of KDs in mild AD participants. Although positive
results from definitive research studies might lead some to
consider a KD for the treatment of AD, in the routine clinical
setting, its challenges may hinder its implementation. On a
fundamental level, definitive positive studies would never-
theless provide insight into and justify evaluating other
metabolic manipulations for the treatment of AD.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Literature was reviewed using
PubMed and revealed, although proposed as a poten-
tial therapy, no published studies assessing feasibility
and efficacy of a ketogenic diet therapy in humans
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
2. Interpretation: We investigated the feasibility of a
medium-chain triglyceride–supplemented KD inter-
vention in AD participants and coincident effects on
cognition. The dietary protocol was feasible in very
mild (clinical dementia rating [CDR] 0.5) and mild
(CDR 1) AD patients. All patients with moderate
(CDR 2) AD withdrew from the study, citing caregiver
burden. Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-
cognitive subscale scores significantly improved in
dietary compliantparticipantsfrombaseline totheend
of the intervention and returned to baseline level after
a 1-month discontinuance of the diet. Our findings
suggest
that
the
medium
chain
triglyceride-
supplemented KD is feasible in AD patients up to
CDR 1 and may elicit potential cognitive benefit.
3. Future directions: These findings justify further inves-
tigation into the ketogenic diet as a therapy in AD.
