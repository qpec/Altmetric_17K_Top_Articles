Abstract
Background: Kinase inhibition in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a standard therapy for
cancer patients with activating BRAF mutations. However, the anti-tumorigenic effect and clinical benefit are only
transient, and tumors are prone to treatment resistance and relapse. To elucidate mechanistic insights into drug
resistance, we have established an in vitro cellular model of MAPK inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma.
Methods: The cellular model evolved in response to clinical dosage of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, PLX4032.
We conducted transcriptomic expression profiling using RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR arrays. Pathways of melanogenesis,
MAPK signaling, cell cycle, and metabolism were significantly enriched among the set of differentially expressed
genes of vemurafenib-resistant cells vs control. The underlying mechanism of treatment resistance and pathway
rewiring was uncovered to be based on non-genomic adaptation and validated in two distinct melanoma models,
SK-MEL-28 and A375. Both cell lines have activating BRAF mutations and display metastatic potential.
Results: Downregulation of dual specific phosphatases, tumor suppressors, and negative MAPK regulators
reengages mitogenic signaling. Upregulation of growth factors, cytokines, and cognate receptors triggers signaling
pathways circumventing BRAF blockage. Further, changes in amino acid and one-carbon metabolism support
cellular proliferation despite MAPK inhibitor treatment. In addition, treatment-resistant cells upregulate
pigmentation and melanogenesis, pathways which partially overlap with MAPK signaling. Upstream regulator
analysis discovered significant perturbation in oncogenic forkhead box and hypoxia inducible factor family
transcription factors.
Conclusions: The established cellular models offer mechanistic insight into cellular changes and therapeutic targets
under inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma. At a systems biology level, the MAPK pathway undergoes major
rewiring while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of this transcriptional plasticity is selection for a set of
transcriptional master regulators, which circumvent upstream targeted kinases and provide alternative routes of
mitogenic activation. A fine-woven network of redundant signals maintains similar effector genes allowing for
tumor cell survival and malignant progression in therapy-resistant cancer.

 Background
Therapy resistance in cancer
Cancer drug resistance is a major obstacle in achieving
durable clinical responses with targeted therapies. This
highlights a need to elucidate the underlying mecha-
nisms responsible for resistance and identify strategies
to overcome this challenge. In malignant melanoma, ac-
tivating point-mutations in the mitogen activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway in BRAF kinase (B-Raf proto-
oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, Gene ID: 673) [1–3]
made it possible to develop potent kinase inhibitors
matched to genotyped kinase mutations in precision
medicine approaches [4–6]. In tumors expressing the
oncoprotein
BRAF(V600E),
the
inhibitor
molecules
vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib are designed
to lock the ATP binding site into an inactive conform-
ation of the kinase [4], the preferred state of wild-type
RAF
proteins.
Trametinib
and
cobimetinib
target
MAP2K7 (MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
7, Gene ID: 5609), the BRAF target and downstream ef-
fector molecule. In MAPK signaling, combinations of
specific inhibitors have proven to be superior to single-
agent regimens: BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) in combin-
ation with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) improved survival
compared to single MAPK inhibitors (MAPKi) [7–10].
However, many patients responding to small molecule
inhibition of the MAPK pathway will develop resistance.
Ultimately, disease progression will take place and pa-
tients relapse with lethal drug-resistant disease.
Mechanism of resistance beyond mutations
Acquired resistance has been shown to involve a diverse
spectrum of oncogenic mutations in the MAPK pathway
[11–15]. In addition, non-genomic activation of parallel
signaling pathways has been noted [16]. Cell-to-cell vari-
ability in BRAF(V600E) melanomas generates drug-
tolerant subpopulations. Selection of genetically distinct,
fully drug-resistant clones arise within a set of heteroge-
neous tumor cells surviving the initial phases of therapy
due to drug adaptation [17]. Non-genomic drug adapta-
tion can be accomplished reproducibly in cultured cells,
and combination therapies that block adaptive mecha-
nisms in vitro have shown promise in improving rates
and durability of response [18]. Thus, better understand-
ing of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely
to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by
delaying or controlling acquired resistance.
Methods
Cellular models of malignant melanoma
SK-MEL-28 and A375 are human skin malignant melan-
oma cell lines with BRAF(V600E) activation that are
tumorigenic in xenografts [19–22] (HTB-72 and CRL-
1619, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,
VA). The cell lines are maintained in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibi-
otics
(10–017-CV,
35–010-CV,
30–002-CI
Corning,
Corning, NY). All experimental protocols were approved
by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of
California Merced and Irvine. The study was carried out
as part of IRB UCM13–0025 of the University of Califor-
nia Merced and as part of dbGap ID 5094 on somatic
mutations in cancer and conducted in accordance with
the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.
BRAFi-resistant (BRAFi-R) models were obtained by
challenging cancer cell lines with incrementally increas-
ing vemurafenib (PLX4032, PubChem CID: 42611257,
Selleckchem, Houston, TX) concentrations in the culture
media. Starting at 0.25 μM, which matched the naïve
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the par-
ental cell lines, the vemurafenib concentrations were in-
creased every 7 days in an exponential series up to 100-fold
the naïve IC50 concentrations. Following this 6-week
selection protocol, vemurafenib-adapted, cancer ther-
apy resistance models were maintained in media sup-
plemented with 5.0 μM vemurafenib.
Transcriptomic profiling and differential gene expression
analysis
Total RNA from malignant melanoma cells was ex-
tracted using a mammalian RNA mini preparation kit
(RTN10-1KT, GenElute, Sigma EMD Millipore, Darm-
stadt, Germany) and then digested with deoxyribonucle-
ase I (AMPD1-1KT, Sigma EMD Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthe-
sized
using
random
hexamers
(cDNA
SuperMix,
95,048–500, Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, MA). The
purified DNA library was sequenced using a High-
Seq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the University of
California Irvine Genomics High-Throughput Facility.
Purity and integrity of the nucleic acid samples were
quantified using a Bioanalyzer (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agi-
lent, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries for next generation
mRNA transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis
were generated using the TruSeq kit (Truseq RNA Li-
brary Prep Kit v2, RS-122-2001, Illumina, San Diego,
CA). In brief, the workflow involves purifying the poly-A
containing mRNA molecules using oligo-dT attached
magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is
chemically fragmented into small pieces using divalent
cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA
fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using re-
verse transcriptase and random primers. Second strand
cDNA synthesis follows, using DNA polymerase I and
RNase H. The cDNA fragments are end repaired by ade-
nylation of the 3′ ends and ligated to barcoded adapters.
The products are then purified and enriched by nine cy-
cles of PCR to create the final cDNA library subjected to

 sequencing. The resulting libraries were validated by
qPCR and size-quantified by a DNA high sensitivity chip
(Bioanalyzer, 5067–4626, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Se-
quencing was performed using 50 base pair read length,
single-end reads, and more than 107 reads per sample.
Raw sequence reads in the file format for sequences with
quality scores (FASTQ) were mapped to human refer-
ence Genome Reference Consortium GRCh38 using
Bowtie alignment with an extended Burrows-Wheeler
indexing for an ultrafast memory efficient alignment
within the Tuxedo suite followed by Tophat to account
for splice-isoforms [23, 24]. Read counts were scaled via
the median of the geometric means of fragment counts
across all libraries. Transcript abundance was quantified
using normalized single-end RNA-Seq reads in read
counts as well as reads per kilobase million (RPKM).
Since single-end reads were acquired in the sequencing
protocol, quantification of reads or fragments yielded
similar results. Statistical testing for differential expres-
sion was based on read counts and performed using
EdgeR in the Bioconductor toolbox [25]. Differentially
expressed genes were further analyzed using Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis (IPA, Qiagen, Rewood City, CA), clas-
sification of transcription factors (TFClass), and gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA, Broad Institute, Cambridge,
MA) [26, 27]. For real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validation of RNA-Seq signals
of differentially expressed target genes in BRAFi-R mel-
anoma cells, gene expression profiles were analyzed
using the ΔΔ threshold cycle (CT) method. Oligonucleo-
tides spanning exon-exon-junctions of transcripts were
used for RT-qPCR validation (Additional file 1: Table 1).
Triple replicate samples were subjected to SYBR green
(SYBR green master mix, PerfeCTa® SYBR® Green FastMix®,
95072-05k, Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, MA) RT-qPCR
analysis in an Eco system (Illumina, San Diego). CT values
were normalized using multiple housekeeping genes like
actin beta (ACTB, Gene ID: 60), cyclophilin A (PPIA, pepti-
dylprolyl isomerase A, Gene ID: 5478) and RNA polymer-
ase II subunit A (POLR2A, GeneID: 5430).
Inhibitor cytotoxicity studies
Chemical BRAFi against BRAF(V600E), vemurafenib,
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) as a
10.0 mM stock solution and used in treatments in final
concentrations between 0.01 μM and 50.0 μM. Melanoma
control experiments were carried out in the presence of
equivalent amounts of DMSO solvent without drug. Cell
viability was determined using a 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-ni-
tro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT,
X4626, Sigma EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany)
absorbance assay by subtracting background readout at
650 nm from response readout at 570 nm wavelength.
IC50 concentrations were determined after 72 h of drug
treatment between 0.01–100 μM in two-fold dilution
series. Analysis was performed using CalcuSyn (v2.0, Bio-
soft, Cambridge, UK).
Melanin quantification
Melanin pigment production of cultured cells was deter-
mined by colorimetric measurements normalized for
total protein levels in arbitrary units [28, 29]. Melanoma
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm
(3830 g, Z326K, Labnet International, Edison, NJ) and
dissolved in either 1.0 N NaOH for melanin assay or
lysis 250 for protein assay. The cell lysates were soni-
cated, incubated at room temperature for 24 h, and
cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min
(17,000 g, Z326K, Labnet International, Edison, NJ). The
absorption of the supernatant was measured at 475 nm
in a spectrophotometer (Smartspec3000, Bio-Rad, Carls-
bad, CA). Cells were lysed in mild denaturing conditions
in lysis 250 buffer (25 mM Tris, [pH 7.5], 5 mM EDTA,
0.1% NP-40, 250 mM NaCl) containing proteinase inhib-
itors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml
pepstatin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride). The total protein amount in the lysates was
quantified using a colorimetric Bradford assay (5000001,
Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) at 595 nm and an incubation
time of 30 min [30].
Results
Generation of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines
The parental melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-28 and A375
were exposed to incrementally increasing concentrations
of the mutant-BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (Fig. 1a). At
the initial inhibitor concentration matching the IC50 of
vemurafenib in the naïve parental melanoma cells [11,
31] cell proliferation decreased. Surviving cells were
propagated and subjected to an exponential series of in-
creasing vemurafenib concentrations until BRAFi-R sub-
lines were obtained tolerating at least 5 μM vemurafenib
in the culture media with similar cell proliferation rates
as the parental cell lines of 0.67 doublings per day.
Some BRAFi-R cell lines showed structures typically
observed in differentiated melanocytes (Fig. 1b-c). In
the presence of 5 μM vemurafenib, however, the parental
cells were not able to grow but the resistant cells prolif-
erated comparable to naïve cell lines (Fig. 1d-e). For the
SK-MEL-28 cell line, two resistant sublines were estab-
lished. The resistant sublines displayed IC50 values of
11.5 ± 0.9 μM and 13.3 ± 1.2 μM for SK-MEL-28-BRAFi-
R1 and SK-MEL-28-BRAFi-R2 respectively, which is ap-
proximately 10–20 fold of the IC50 in a low micro-
molar range for the parental cells with 0.74 ± 0.05 μM.
For the A375 cell line, the IC50 of the A375-BRAFi-R
cell line was observed at 17.7 ± 1.5 μM, 22.7 fold of IC50
for the parental A375 cells with 0.78 ± 0.22 μM (Fig. 1f).

 Transcriptomic profiling identifies non-genomic rewiring
of treatment-resistant cancer cells
We conducted transcriptomic gene expression profiling
of BRAFi treatment-resistant SK-MEL-28-BRAFi-R1 and
SK-MEL-28-BRAFi-R2 cell lines by RNA-Seq and looked
for differential expression versus the parental SK-MEL-
28 cell line. In total, 980 unique transcripts showed sig-
nificant differential expression in RNA-Seq experiments
with p values below 0.05, absolute log-fold change
(LOG(FC)) greater or equal 1.0 (Fig. 2a-b). The differ-
entially expressed genes included 505 upregulated tran-
scripts and 475 downregulated transcripts (Additional
file 1: Table S2–3). We subjected the identified direc-
tional sets to pathway enrichment analysis (Additional
file 1: Table S4). Distinct clusters stood out and showed
significant enrichment with p values below 0.05 and
q values below 0.10 (Fig. 2c). Melanogenesis and pathways
in cancer, inflammation, nuclear factor kappa-light-
chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signal-
ing, metabolic pathways including alanine, tyrosine,
valine, leucine, inositol, one-carbon metabolism, cell-
adhesion molecules, neurotrophin signaling were over-
represented in the upregulated dataset. MAPK signaling
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were dif-
ferentially expressed and characterized by both strong
up- and downregulation. Extra-cellular matrix (ECM) re-
ceptors, cell cycle, and hypoxia signaling were enriched
in the downregulated dataset. Of the 980 differential
expressed genes, we validated expression changes of 150
genes by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2d, Additional file 1: Table S3).
Of these, a majority, 64.0% (96 of 150), responded

 significantly (with p values below 0.05) in the same dir-
ection as RNA-Seq data for treatment-resistant melan-
oma. When both treatment resistance models of SK-
MEL-28 and A375 were taken into consideration, about
half of the tested genes, 50 of 96, showed consistent
regulation (Fig. 2e, Additional file 1: Table S3). Genes
in MAPK signaling included nuclear factor of activated
T-cells 2 (NFATC2, Gene ID: 4773), phospholipase A2
group VI (PLA2G6, Gene ID: 8398), dual specificity
phosphatase 1 (DUSP1, Gene ID: 1843), and dual

 for amino acid metabolism, and NME/NM23 nucleoside
diphosphate kinase 1 (NME1, Gene ID: 4830) and dihy-
dropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD, Gene ID: 1806) for
pyrimidine metabolism were significantly upregulated
(Fig. 2d). Taken together, the adaptive transcriptomic
changes were validated in two distinct melanoma models,
SK-MEL-28 and A375, both cell lines with metastatic po-
tential showed differential expression of MAPK signaling
while activating alternative mitogenic signaling interac-
tions and metabolic processes.
Upstream regulator analysis suggests control by
transcription factor families
Next, the gene list was subjected to hierarchical tran-
scription factor motif analysis to identify master regula-
tors [32]. We asked whether any of the enriched
transcription factor motif families were represented in
the differential gene expression data. In detail, we looked
for transcription factors as well as their target genes
whose promoters show respective transcription factor
binding sites among the same list of regulated genes
(Fig. 3a). It is expected that differentially expressed tran-
scription factors show motif enrichment in promoter
sites of significantly deregulated target genes. Further,
identified target genes with enriched transcription factor
motifs will have major contributions to significantly
deregulated pathways under treatment resistance (Fig.
3b). A network illustration of transcriptional master reg-
ulators, target genes, and dysregulated effector network
upon treatment resistance demonstrates transcriptional
synergy (Fig. 3c). Upregulated transcription factor fam-
ilies included Rel homology region (RHR) NFκB-related
factors, forkhead box (FOX), Zinc finger E-box-binding
homeobox domain factors (ZEB), nuclear steroid hor-
mone receptor subfamily 3 (NR3C, androgen receptor
and progesterone receptor), hypoxia-inducible and endo-
thelial PAS domain-containing factors (HIF, EPAS), and
the cell cycle transcription factor family (E2F) (Fig. 3b).
Downstream enriched target genes comprised members
of interleukin (IL), chemokine receptor (CXCL), matrix
metallo proteinase (MMP) families, transcription factors
forkhead box O1 (FOXO1, Gene ID: 2308), endothelial
PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1, HIF2A, Gene ID: 2034)
and melanogenesis associated metabolic genes, tyrosinase
(TYR, OCA1, Gene ID: 7299), DCT, and melanosomal
transmembrane protein (OCA2, oculocutaneous albinism
II, Gene ID: 4948). Downregulated transcription factors
included forkhead box F2 (FOXF2, Gene ID: 2295), which
has DUSP2 or transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFB3,
Gene ID: 7043) as target genes. Upstream regulator ana-
lysis suggested gene expression changes of nuclear factor
kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1, Gene ID: 4790, V$NFKB_Q6,
motif M11921) in complex with REL proto-oncogene
(REL Gene ID: 5966, V$CREL_01, motif M10143), EMT
modulator zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1
(ZEB1, Gene ID: 6935, V$AREB6_01, M11244), fork-
head box (V$FOXO1_01, motif M11512), and hypoxia
inducible factor family transcription factors (V$HIF1_Q3,
motif M14011) as master regulators of transcriptional ef-
fector networks upon BRAFi treatment resistance.
Validation of pathway rewiring in drug resistance in
multiple cell lines by transcriptomics arrays
Transcriptome analysis of reversible drug resistance
identified distinct pathways that allowed for circumven-
tion of BRAF blockage (Fig. 4a). Cell-to-cell variability in
combination with drug exposure selects for distinct sub-
populations of MAPKi-resistant (MAPKi-R) cell lines. In
a hierarchical fashion, transcriptional master regulators
promote a distinct set of target genes resulting in cir-
cumvention of MAPK inhibition. Receptor activation by
fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1, Gene ID: 2246) or
PDGFC can lead to activated receptor tyrosine signaling
parallel to canonical MAPK signaling [16] (Fig. 4b).
In
addition,
downregulation
of
tumor
suppressors
reengages mitogenic signaling. The dual specific phos-
phatases, DUSP1 and DUSP2, have the ability to switch
MAPK signaling off and rank among the top downregu-
lated hits. Thus, downregulation of dual specific phos-
phatases facilitates and reinforces alternative MAPK
effector activation under BRAF blockage (Fig. 4b). One
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1,
ERK2, Gene ID: 5594) effector targets, transcription
factor EPAS1, showed upregulation and the ability to
maintain its transcriptional program. The pro-apoptotic
program
of
TGFB3
was
downregulated
including
SMAD family member 9 (SMAD9, Gene ID: 4093) and
DUSP1/2 (Fig. 4c). Adenylate cyclase, G-protein, and
phospholipase signaling are alternative cascades observed
in cutaneous and uveal melanoma (Fig. 4d). Upregulation
of ADCY1, endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB, Gene ID:
1910), phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4, Gene ID: 5332),
and cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 (CREB3,
Gene ID: 10488) promote MITF activity, the master tran-
scription factor for pigmentation genes. Downstream
metabolic enzymes, TYR and DCT, are both MITF target
genes and contribute to enhanced eumelanin production
observed in some therapy-resistant cell lines. The ob-
served pigmentation showed a wide range of from 1.3-fold
to up to 16.8-fold upregulation (Fig. 4d). While both cell
lines showed dysregulation of melanogenesis, the regula-
tors and effectors involved were different. SK-MEL-28-
BRAFi-R2 has ASIP prominently expressed (TYR (2.1),
DCT (2.8), tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1, OCA3,
Gene ID: 7306) (0.5), MITF (0.7), agouti signaling protein
(ASIP, Gene ID: 434) (18.9)), while A375-BRAFi-R showed
strongest regulation of TYRP1 and MITF (TYR (0.34),
DCT (0.24), TYRP1 (41.8), MITF (2.94), ASIP (0.41)).

 In summary, upregulation of growth factors or recep-
tors triggers signaling pathways circumventing BRAF
blockage. Changes in amino acid and one-carbon metab-
olism support cellular proliferation despite inhibitor
treatment. In addition, alternative MAPK signaling coin-
cides with differential response of melanogenesis and
pigmentation pathways, which partially overlap with
MAPK effectors. In particular, NFKB1, REL, ZEB1,
FOXO1, and EPAS1 may serve as master regulators
to enact broad transcriptional changes implemented
in altered cascades of MAPK, TGFB, ADCY, and
MITF signaling.

 Discussion
Activation of the MAPK pathway is the central and most
common
oncogenic
event
in
the
pathogenesis
of
malignant melanoma [3, 33]. About 50% of all melan-
oma patients have activating somatic mutations in the
activator loop involving L597, T599, V600, and K601

 switching proto-oncogene BRAF into a constitutively active
protein kinase and cancer driver. Such activation is sup-
ported by somatic copy number amplifications of chromo-
some 7 [34], often coinciding with somatic V600E/G/K/M/R
mutations. Another 20–30% of the patients show non-
genomic activation of BRAF by transcriptional upregulation
or post-translational modification induced by somatic mu-
tations of upstream signaling molecules like KIT proto-
oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT, Gene ID: 3815),
proto-oncogene neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homo-
log (NRAS, Gene ID: 4893), or loss-of-function neurofibro-
min 1 (NF1, Gene ID: 4763). Constitutively activated BRAF
phosphorylates MAPK1 and downstream kinases resulting
in mitogenic signaling, proliferation, and cell growth. Inte-
grated into this cellular program is negative feedback result-
ing in reduction of NRAS expression [35, 36].
Genomic and non-genomic mechanisms of therapy
resistance
Genomic sequencing has facilitated the understanding of ac-
quired resistance mechanisms to MAPKis [14–16, 37–40].
Detected genetic aberrations included mutations in NRAS,
MAPK1/2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase
catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA, Gene ID: 5290), and phos-
phatase and tensin homolog (PTEN, Gene ID: 5728). Som-
atic melanoma mutations provide examples of how single,
well-defined genomic events can confer resistance against
vemurafenib treatment. In contrast, transcriptomic as well
as epigenomic regulation can provide insight into resistance
states that may involve larger networks. Eventually, resist-
ance-conferring genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic
alterations result in sustained mitogenic effector signaling
and persist to promote proliferation.
Network rewiring of therapy-resistant melanoma
The transcriptomic profiles revealed a network of genes
involved in adenylate cyclase signaling conferring resist-
ance and contributing to melanogenesis. ADCY1 and
CREB3 are prominent members of the melanogenesis
pathway exhibiting mitogenic control and MITF activa-
tion. Similarly, a gain-of-function screen confirmed a
cyclic-AMP-dependent melanocytic signaling network in-
cluding G-protein-coupled receptors, adenylate cyclase,
protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha
(PRKACA, Gene ID: 5566), and cAMP responsive elem-
ent binding protein 1 (CREB1, Gene ID: 1385) [41]. The
MAPK pathway negatively regulates MITF protein level as
well as activity [29], which in turn regulates a series of cell
cycle regulating genes. In particular, P16INK4A and
P21CIP1, gene products of cyclin dependent kinase inhibi-
tor 2A (CDKN2A, Gene ID: 1029) and cyclin dependent
kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, Gene ID: 1026), respect-
ively, differentiation genes TYR, DCT, TYRP1 as well as
survival genes B-cell lymphoma 2 apoptosis regulator
(BCL2, Gene ID: 596) and BCL2 family apoptosis regula-
tor (MCL1, Gene ID: 4170) are effector genes under the
control of MITF. Indeed, inhibition of MITF increases
sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs [42]. In contrast, upreg-
ulation of MITF in therapy-resistance may present itself
as a survival mechanism, which coincides with upregula-
tion of melanin, hence it may serve as prognostic bio-
marker for drug adaptation.
Dual specific phosphatases (DUSPs) act downstream of
BRAF on phosphorylated MAPK members to provide at-
tenuation of signal. Loss of DUSP activity results in consti-
tutive activation of the pathway. Prominent members of
this family DUSP1 and DUSP2 are consistently downregu-
lated at the transcriptional level. In prior clinical studies,
somatic mutation of DUSP4 in MAPKi-R has been re-
ported [39]. Although in that case a genomic mechanism
of resistance was utilized, the outcome of reduced DUSP
activity by genomic or transcriptomic changes is equiva-
lent and leads to persistent triggering of MAPK effectors.
Metabolic support of therapy resistance
Metabolic genes support the rewiring of acquired resist-
ance and have been shown to play an intricate role in the
malignancy of skin cutaneous tissues. Glutamine and glu-
cose metabolism showed sensitivity to combinations of
MAPKi and metabolic inhibitors in preclinical studies
[43]. The transciptomic profiles identified key enzymes in
related, branching glycolytic pathways of serine, folate and
pyrimidine metabolism. A cancer systems biology analysis
of skin cutaneous melanoma brought forward a new mas-
ter regulator and diagnostic target in cancer metabolism.
Somatic mutations of DPYD have the ability to reconfig-
ure and activate pyrimidine metabolism promoting rapid
cellular proliferation and metastatic progression [44].
Concertation of transcriptional regulators
The forkhead box family of transcription factors is an im-
portant downstream target of the MAPK pathway and is
currently being considered as a new therapeutic target in
cancer, including melanoma therapy [45]. In epithelial
cells, these transcriptional factors are directly involved in
the expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors and
CDKN2A gene under the control of TGFβ [46, 47]. Both
downregulation of anti-apoptotic targets as well as activa-
tion of proliferative metabolism have been observed as
mechanisms contributing to MAPKi-R. Downregulation
of FOXF2 has been shown to promote cancer progression,
EMT, and metastatic invasion [48]. In contrast, a different
member of the FOX family, the stem cell transcription
factor forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) has been identified as an
adaptive mediator of the response to MAPK pathway in-
hibition selectively in mutant BRAF melanomas [49, 50].

ways in chemotherapy resistance by RNA-Seq data and

 validated gene targets in two cell lines by transcripto-
mics arrays. Perturbation of these resistance pathways by
drug molecules, RNA interference, or genomic editing
will corroborate the translational impact of identified
gene targets. The established cell culture models of
treatment resistance provide a broadly applicable plat-
form to utilize high-throughput screening tools in the
search for effective combinations of targeted therapies in
cancer.
Conclusion
The MAPK pathway undergoes major rewiring at the
transcriptional level while acquiring inhibitor resistance.
The outcome of such transcriptional plasticity is dysreg-
ulation at the level of different upstream master regula-
tors,
while
maintaining
similar
effector
genes.
Combination therapies including targeted approaches
and immune checkpoint inhibition are promising and
rapidly improving. For these therapies to show durable,
progression-free success in the clinical setting, adapta-
tion mechanisms of treatment resistance need to be
understood. Cellular model systems in combination with
transcriptome-wide analyses provide insight into how
non-genomic drug adaptation is accomplished. Ongoing
efforts are focused on utilizing the established preclinical
models to overcome drug adaptation as well as precision
medicine profiling of cancer patients. Over time, a better
understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adapta-
tion is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma
therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.
