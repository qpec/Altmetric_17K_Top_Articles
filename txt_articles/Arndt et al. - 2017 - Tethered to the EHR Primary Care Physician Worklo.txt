Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Work-
load Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-
Motion Observations
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on electronic health 
record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient care. Demand for non–face-to-face 
care, such as communication through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is 
increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study was to assess time 
allocated by primary care physicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-
event log data, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday 
through Friday) and outside clinic hours.
METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine 
physicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems Cor-
poration) EHR interactions were captured from “event logging” records over a 
3-year period for both direct patient care and non–face-to-face activities, and 
were validated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR 
task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic hours.
RESULTS Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the 
EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) 
during clinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical and 
administrative tasks including documentation, order entry, billing and coding, 
and system security accounted for nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 
minutes, 44.2%). Inbox management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7%).
CONCLUSIONS Primary care physicians spend more than one-half of their work-
day, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR during and after clinic hours. EHR 
event logs can identify areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus 
reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. 
Direct time-motion observations validated EHR-event log data as a reliable source 
of information regarding clinician time allocation.

INTRODUCTION
P
rimary care has become increasingly complex,1 with electronic 
health record (EHR) systems adding to the complexity. Our patients 
expect same-day access for face-to-face care during clinic hours and 
rapid responses to telephone calls, patient portal messages, laboratory 
result inquiries, and prescription renewal requests both during and after 
clinic hours. This concurrent face-to-face (synchronous) and non–face-
to-face (asynchronous) care, combined with administrative and regulatory 
work (prior authorizations, billing and coding, performance measurement) 
results in considerable strain on the primary care team. It is imperative to 
understand factors contributing to workload and identify practical solu-
tions to these challenges.
US physicians spend numerous hours daily interacting with EHR sys-
tems, contributing to work–life imbalance, dissatisfaction, high rates of 
attrition, and a burnout rate exceeding 50%.2-6 Factors such as increased

entry (CPOE), inbox management, patient portals, 
and a redistribution of tasks previously performed by 
clinical staff to clinicians has led to more work that 
is not direct face time with patients.7-11 A 2016 study 
showed physicians from family medicine, internal 
medicine, cardiology, and orthopedics spent nearly 2 
hours in the EHR and on other desk work for every 1 
hour of direct patient care.7 In our own primary care 
system during 2013-2016, despite a stable 2.2 aver-
age office visits per panel member per year, telephone 
calls increased by 3% and MyChart portal encounters 
increased by 62% to an average of 0.66 per panel 
member per year. Most primary care physicians have 
not allocated time for this additional work, and much 
of the non–face-to-face work occurs on top of already 
full patient care sessions. To address clinician well-
being,12 it is critical to understand how clinician work-
load is affected by EHR use.
The goal of this study was to assess the time and 
usage patterns of primary care physicians interacting 
with the EHR using EHR user-event log data associ-
ated with the provision of direct patient care and 
various asynchronous tasks during and after clinic 
work hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday 
through Friday).
METHODS
The study was conducted at a 
large academic health care center 
consisting of family medicine 
residency clinics and community-
based nonresidency family 
medicine clinics (community 
and regional) associated with 
the University of Wisconsin-
Madison Department of Fam-
ily Medicine and Community 
Health in southern Wisconsin. 
The Epic EHR system (Epic 
Systems Corporation) was fully 
implemented by 2008. We con-
ducted a retrospective cohort 
study of all nonresident physi-
cians providing care at these sites 
from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 
2016. Because no patient identifi-
ers were included in the analysis, 
this study was determined to 
be exempt by the University of 
Wisconsin Health Sciences Insti-
tutional Review Board.
We extracted data from our 
enterprise Epic EHR database. 
Information about time spent on particular activities 
was obtained from “event logging,” an automated track-
ing feature that monitors the accessing and perfor-
mance of the EHR interface for system administration 
and security purposes. When a clinician accesses or 
moves between modules in the EHR interface, such as 
moving from Progress Notes to Order Entry, a record 
of these activities is developed, including the time 
the event occurred, the process activating the event, 
and other associated information such as user ID and 
computer location. These tracking features reflect all 
interactions within the EHR system and can be used 
by health systems in audits that, for example, identify 
inappropriate access to certain patient records. Event 
logging occurs for face-to-face encounters (eg, patients 
seen in office visits) and non–face-to-face activities (eg, 
electronic communication with patients, billing and 
coding, and order entry).
There are more than 1,000 event descriptions to 
identify user interactions with Epic, including both 
patient care–related events and system-level techni-
cal events. We assigned each EHR event captured by 
the system event log database to 1 of 15 categories 
(Table 1) created by consensus among 2 practicing 
family medicine physicians and a data analyst (B.G.A.,

analytics.
Validation Procedures
To validate EHR measures of primary care physicians’ 
time spent on synchronous and asynchronous activi-
ties, we completed a time and motion study through 
direct observation of 14 nonresident family medicine 
physicians during clinical sessions in residency clinic– 
and community clinic–based settings over a period of 
6 weeks in May and June 2016. Physician volunteers 
were selected based on sex (6 male, 8 female), years 
of postresidency experience (<1 to >15 years), clini-
cal full-time equivalents (FTEs) (3 to 9 half days of 
patient care per week), clinical setting (residency and 
community), and self-reported experience with EHR 
use (2-4 to >12 years).
A trained medical student completed 63 hours of 
direct observation on weekdays from 7:00 am to 7:00 
pm. Observations began when clinicians arrived at the 
clinic and continued through the end of patient care 
sessions. The student also observed work subsequent 
to patient care sessions, including completion of docu-
mentation, orders, and inbox tasks from the current or 
earlier patient care sessions. Observations concluded 
at transitions to the next major activity for the day, 
such as leaving the clinic or attending a meeting. The 
WorkStudy+ application (Quetech Ltd) was used on an 
iPad (Apple Inc) to track clinical activities throughout 
sessions (Figure 1). In addition to capturing EHR work 
task categories, direct observations included additional 
non-EHR activities. Duration of pauses or interrup-
tions while performing tasks was also recorded. Sixty 
percent of the physician time observed in the clinic 
related to non-EHR tasks, while 40% was associated 
with EHR tasks.
Data Cleaning
Data from the WorkStudy+ application were extracted 
for processing and analysis. The category assigned

Note: For direct observation, we developed 15 electronic health record (EHR) task categories plus several non-EHR task categories (eg, staff interactions, e-mail, paper-
work and other administrative work, and personal time). Some of the categories shown have further subcategories that appear once the category is selected.

to each event in the system event logs, along with 
the time spent on each event, was compared with the 
direct observation category assigned by the observer 
along with the observed time spent on each event. 
Eleven (5.9%) of the event log category assignments 
were misclassified based on the direct observation data. 
These billing and coding tasks were inappropriately 
assigned to order entry in the original EHR system 
event log classification and were reassigned to billing 
and coding for final analysis.
RESULTS
EHR System Event Log Data
We extracted EHR system event logs for 142 family 
medicine physicians (Table 2). More than 118 million 
individual EHR system event log record events were 
created in the 3-year analysis. From more than 1,000 
event types trackable in the event log database, our 
family medicine physicians’ EHR activities created data 
in 186 event log record event types.
Time Spent on Various Tasks
The time physicians spent working with 
the EHR differed across tasks (Table 3), 
with some tasks exclusively associated 
with direct patient care in the clinic (eg, 
billing and coding), and others associated 
with both direct patient care and asyn-
chronous tasks (eg, documentation, chart 
review, and order entry). Work hours were 
normalized to 1.0 clinical FTE for clini-
cians who had a clinical FTE of less than 
0.9 to 1.0 (71.8%). 
The average total EHR time per week-
day for a 1.0 clinical FTE was 355 minutes 
(5.9 hours), consisting of 269 minutes (4.5 
hours) during clinic hours and 86 minutes 
(1.4 hours) after clinic hours. The calcula-
tion of hours after clinic allocates weekend 
use of the EHR (51 minutes) to the week-
days by taking the total EHR time after 
6:00 pm on Fridays through 8:00 am on 
Mondays and dividing it by 5 days. Physi-
cians spent nearly one-half of their total 
EHR time per day (157 minutes, 44.2%) 
doing clerical tasks and an additional 84 
minutes per day (23.7%) managing their 
inbox (Table 3). We confirmed these 
results by comparing them with direct 
observation data.

ties differed by time of day on weekdays 
and weekends (Figure 2). Weekday EHR

EHR use peaked around 10:00 am and 10:00 pm.
DISCUSSION
This study provides a validated mechanism for EHR 
task analysis using EHR system event logs to evalu-
ate primary care physician workload. Our event logs 
indicate that family medicine physicians spend 
approximately 45% of their workday (4.5 hours) on the 
EHR. Direct observation data were consistent with 
this finding. The remaining 55% of the workday (5.5 
hours) was spent on non-EHR activities such as direct 
patient care, team interactions and meetings, paper-
work, e-mail, and other work. An additional 1.4 hours 
per day of EHR time was spent outside of clinic hours 
(before 8:00 am or after 6:00 pm), including 51 minutes 
per weekend. This extra time equates to an average 
workday (excluding time providing care to patients in 
the hospital) of 11.4 hours, representing a considerable 
encroachment on physicians’ personal and family lives.
Although others have suggested work task cat-
egories for primary care,13 ours is the first taxonomy 
proposed to capture routine clinical work in EHR 
systems. This study extends other work by validating 
EHR audit data with direct observation data within 
the same clinical environment. These EHR system-
event log results are similar to self-report data pub-
lished by Sinsky et al.7 In that study, 57 physicians 
from “high-performance” family medicine, internal 
medicine, cardiology, and orthopedics practices 
reported 1 to 2 hours of after-clinic work per day 
tracked in after-hours diaries. Consistency between 
the direct observation findings, physician self-reported 
EHR work after hours, and EHR system-event log 
data supports consideration of user-event log data as 
an accurate tool for assessing EHR activities associ-
ated with both direct patient care and asynchronous 
work during and after clinic hours.
Our clinicians had more than 20 years in practice 
and 8 years of experience with our EHR, yet only 40 
(28.2%) of the 142 family medicine physicians included 
in this study had a clinical FTE of 0.9 or 1.0. Forty-four 
of the 142 physicians worked in residency clinics where 
their clinical FTE is generally lower because of other 
responsibilities, but other, nonresidency physicians have 
chosen to cut back to part time (average of 0.7 clinical 
FTE) to compensate for their increased workload.

Implications for Primary Care Redesign
It is important to recognize that burnout and the 
increased workload clinicians have experienced from 
time spent working in the EHR are due to multiple 
factors,14 only 1 of which is the EHR system itself. 
Other factors include inappropriate allocation of 
EHR tasks to clinicians (eg, submitting a radiograph 
order that was given verbally in the past); technology-
supported guidelines that have placed hard stops in 
clinical workflows (eg, a clinician cannot proceed until 
acknowledging a post–hospital discharge medication 
reconciliation); the problem-focused care paradigm; 
health care workforce issues; more scrutiny on cost, 
quality, and patient satisfaction; and rapidly changing 
regulatory requirements.
Documentation Support
Much of a family medicine physician’s workday (84 
minutes) is spent on documentation, so it is impera-
tive to find ways to reduce documentation burden. 
Although EHR templates have improved documenta-
tion efficiency for some, the quality of the clinical 
note is often lower when compared with that obtained 
with dictation to transcription. Documentation sup-
port staff and additional training in documentation 
optimization should be readily available for interested 
clinicians. We have used our EHR system-event logs 
to identify and offer support to physicians who might 
benefit from transcription services or voice recogni-
tion software (eg, Dragon Medical; Nuance Com-
munications Inc), but few individuals used these docu-
mentation support tools regularly during our 6-week 
observation. It was outside the scope of this study 
to investigate the use of support tools further, but it 
should be explored.
Order Entry
Our family medicine physicians spent 44% of their 
workday (157 minutes) in the EHR doing clerical and 
other administrative tasks. Computerized physician 
order entry accounted for 12.1% of their clinic hours 
(43 minutes) in the EHR. The burden related to order 
entry has been associated with clinician burnout, dis-
satisfaction, and intent to leave practice.15 Minimal 
evidence for increased patient safety related to CPOE16 
and reduced order efficiency of this system for physi-
cians compared with other ordering systems implies 
that alternatives to CPOE should be considered. Hav-
ing clinical staff enter verbal or handwritten orders 
(ie, on a standardized paper checklist) from physicians 
saves time and allows the physician to focus more on 
the patient.17,18 Some health care systems have imple-
mented conservative policies about providing verbal 
orders to nonclinician staff limiting this option. The 
American Medical Association is actively engaged 
in helping organizations understand and implement 
guidelines regarding order entry by nonclinician staff.19 
Their goal is to support accurate policy interpretation 
and maximize opportunities in efficiency and satisfac-
tion across health care systems.20
Asynchronous Patient Care
Although virtual visits (ie, patient care delivered by 
telephone, patient portal, or video calls) are increasing, 
there is insufficient evidence that such asynchronous 
care improves health outcomes, cost, and overall health 
care use.21,22 Further study of the time costs, impact on 
professional satisfaction, and quality outcomes of asyn-
chronous care is warranted.
Communication 
Communication within clinical teams is important. 
Routing all communication among team members 
through the EHR adds layers of inefficiency and dis-
tracts the team from higher-quality verbal communica-
tion. Face-to-face communication is associated with 
increased efficiency, whereas more electronic commu-
nication among team members leads to greater clini-
cian and staff dissatisfaction as well as poorer clinical 
outcomes and increased health care use among patients 
with coronary artery disease.23
Study Limitations
Our study had some limitations. Many EHR tasks are 
associated with multiple subroutines. For example, tele-
phone encounters are often associated with a review 
of prior notes (Chart Review – Notes) and current 
medications (Chart Review – Medications) to answer 
a patient’s question, followed by typing a progress 
note (Documentation) of the telephone dialog with 
a patient. As a result, the total time attributed to the 
Telephone Call category is relatively small given that 
it captures only the telephone module time and does 
not account for associated tasks. Future studies could 
string from beginning to end the multiple tasks that 
comprise certain encounter types rather than breaking 
the tasks associated with a bigger event (eg, Telephone 
Call) into multiple separate tasks (eg, Chart Review 
– Notes, Chart Review – Medications, and Documen-
tation). This alternate method would give a clearer pic-
ture of the total time spent on a given task.
Event logs are created in a server-client request-
response environment; there is no way to ascertain 
what happens on the client side between designated 
events. It was therefore impossible to distinguish 
between the time spent when a clinician was active 
in the EHR and the time spent while having the EHR 
open but engaging in other activities (eg, performing

425
an examination, talking to a patient or team member), 
so we applied a cutoff of 90 seconds when no activity 
was captured by event log records as supported by the 
pause time observed in our direct observation period.
This study focused on EHR time, not total patient 
care time, spent by physicians and excludes EHR 
time associated with inpatient and obstetrics work 
at other hospitals. As a result, total EHR time would 
be greater when accounting for this work. Addition-
ally, our regional clinic physicians receive a substan-
tial volume of faxes and other paperwork because 
regional health system partners may not communicate 
directly through our EHR. Once that paperwork is 
transitioned into EHR workflows, total EHR time for 
those physicians will increase and paperwork burden 
will decrease.
Our accounting of work outside of clinic hours 
may be underestimated as many of the physicians had 
other part-time roles related to education, administra-
tion, and research, and would offload EHR work to 
time allocated to those other obligations between 8:00 
am and 6:00 pm on weekdays. For example, a physi-
cian may do EHR work resulting from their morning 
clinic when they were scheduled to prepare a lecture 
in the afternoon. Our method gives credit to this 
EHR work as occurring during clinic hours, when it 
occurred outside of the individual clinician’s clinical 
FTE work hours.
Conclusions
There are a variety of solutions to address the many 
facets of physician burnout,15 and developing organi-
zational metrics that are specifically related to decreas-
ing stress from EHR systems is critical.24 In pursuit of 
finding “joy in practice,”25 stakeholders have proposed 
5 solutions to common problems in primary care, 
including proactive planned care; team-based care 
that includes expanded rooming protocols, standing 
orders, and panel management; sharing of clerical tasks 
including documentation, order entry, and prescription 
management; verbal communication and shared inbox 
work; and improved team function. Each solution 
requires thoughtful EHR system application.
We propose that EHR user-event log data are 
valid for assessing individual performance within the 
EHR, influencing workflow redesign, and assessing 
the impact of organizational changes on task manage-
ment by health care team members. For example, we 
discovered that our family medicine physicians were 
spending nearly as much time on system security (10 
minutes) as on reading or editing the problem list (12 
minutes) each day. Our organizational leadership sub-
sequently invested in a single sign-in system to reduce 
clinician time spent on system security. Additionally, 
we are looking at the time physicians spend on billing 
and coding since implementation of the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Our hypothesis is 
that primary care physicians are spending more time 
on this task. Eliminating the 14 minutes per day that 
physicians spend on billing and coding would open up 
capacity to do other tasks such as inbox management, 
team huddles, or another 15-minute appointment.
We encourage others to use our proposed EHR task 
categories to allow comparisons between organizations 
at the individual and care team levels and by specialty. 
As there are no information standards for recording 
user events in EHRs, however, we encourage users of 
other EHR systems to analyze their own event-log 
data using these same task categories, compare their 
findings with ours, and help to determine whether 
this approach is generalizable. Best practice should be 
identified from high-performing individuals, teams, and 
organizations, and used as a goal for other organiza-
tions to pursue, but in relationship to clinician and 
team satisfaction. Organizations could apply this EHR 
task-analysis framework to measure their effectiveness 
in supporting their clinicians and care teams in each 
of the EHR task categories. In addition, organizations 
could use event-log data to assess their effectiveness of 
reducing EHR work after clinic hours.
In summary, primary care physicians in our study 
worked an average of 11.4 hours per weekday, both 
during and after clinic hours, with nearly 6 hours 
spent interacting with the computer. Two-thirds of 
the time on the computer was allocated to clerical 
and inbox work. EHR event logs can identify areas of 
EHR-related work that could be delegated, thereby 
reducing workload, improving professional satisfac-
tion, and reducing burnout. Direct time-motion 
observations validated EHR event-log data as a reli-
able source of information regarding clinician time 
allocation.
