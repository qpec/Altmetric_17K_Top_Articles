Abstract
During the past decade, Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO), previously named peripheral 
benzodiazepine receptor, has gained a great deal of attention based on its use as a clinical 
biomarker of neuroinflammation with therapeutic potential. However, there is a paucity of 
knowledge on the function(s) of TSPO in glial cells. Here, we identify a novel function of TSPO 
in microglia that is not associated with steroidogenesis. We propose a TSPO interaction with 
NADPH Oxidase linking the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling to the 
induction of an antioxidant response to maintain redox homeostasis. This line of investigation may 
provide a greater understanding of TSPO glial cell biology and the knowledge gained may prove 
beneficial in devising therapeutic strategies.

TSPO - a biomarker of neuroinflammation
During the past decade, several studies have validated TSPO as a biomarker of 
neuroinflammation that is able to detect a wide range of brain pathologies [1–3]. The ability 
to visualize and measure TSPO levels in the living brain using non-invasive neuroimaging 
techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides a virtual window to view 
ongoing neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical studies.
The cellular framework for TSPO as a biomarker of neuroinflammation and injury is derived 
from the activation of microglia and astrocytes, the glial cell types that express and 
upregulate TSPO levels [3, 4]. In the normal brain neuropil, TSPO is expressed at low levels, 
but TSPO levels increase markedly as a result of any type of brain injury [1–3]. Notably, the 
TSPO response to brain injury has distinct temporal profiles in microglia and astrocytes [4–

 6]. In most injury models, elevated levels of TSPO are initially associated with microglia 
activation, which is typically followed by a TSPO response in activated astrocytes [4–8]. 
Based on these observed differences in the glial cell TSPO response, it has been noted that 
TSPO may serve different functions in microglia and astrocytes [3, 9, 10]. To maximize the 
potential of TSPO as a biomarker and therapeutic target for neuroinflammation, there is a 
need to better understand the function(s) of TSPO in glial cells. Here, we identify a novel 
function of TSPO in microglia that is not associated with steroidogenesis. We propose a 
TSPO interaction with NADPH Oxidase linking the generation of ROS with the induction of 
an antioxidant response to maintain redox homeostasis. This line of investigation may 
provide a greater understanding of TSPO glial cell biology and the knowledge gained may 
prove beneficial in devising therapeutic strategies.
TSPO and NADPH Oxidase (NOX2) in microglia
Microglia are the immune-competent cells in the brain [11], and they upregulate TSPO 
levels following brain injury [2, 3]. However, there is paucity of knowledge on the 
function(s) of TSPO in both microglia and astrocytes. The current view is that TSPO is the 
rate-limiting step in the synthesis of neurosteroids [1]. TSPO is thought to transport 
cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane for conversion to 
pregnenolone, the parent compound for the synthesis of all neurosteroids [1]. However, 
recent studies using conditional and global TSPO knockout mice have questioned the 
essentiality of TSPO in steroidogenesis. Further, unlike earlier attempts to generate Tspo −/− 
mice that were embryo lethal, current studies have shown that Tspo −/− mice are viable, and 
the absence of the TSPO protein does not alter basal steroid synthesis [12–14]. More 
recently, however, another study has shown that the viability of Tspo −/− mice may depend 
on the methodology used [15]. The same study also showed that, although no significant 
differences in basal circulating steroids were observed in conditional knockout mice, 
hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis was compromised, indicating a role of TSPO in 
hormone-stimulated steroid synthesis. Therefore, the putative cellular function of TSPO in 
steroid synthesis appears to be in constant flux and definitive studies are needed in order to 
discover the function(s) of this fascinating protein.
In this background of uncertainty, a study has provided evidence for a novel function of 
TSPO in microglia that does not appear to be associated with steroid synthesis. Choi et al. 
[9] showed that exposure of primary microglia to the prototypical TSPO drug ligands R-
PK11195 and Ro5-4864, at concentrations consistent with the TSPO affinity constant (Kd= 
1–10 nM), increased microglia proliferation, phagocytosis and production of ROS [9]. 
Importantly, the TSPO ligand induced ROS production was abrogated by NADPH oxidase 
(NOX2) inhibitors providing the first evidence of a putative TSPO-NOX2 interaction [9].
Like TSPO, phagocytic NOX2 is a highly enriched protein in microglia and is a major 
source of ROS production in the CNS [16, 17]. NOX2 is a multi-subunit enzyme composed 
of the membrane subunits gp91phox and p22phox, the cytosolic subunits p40phox, p47phox, 
p67phox, and the small G-protein Rac [16]. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), gp91phox and 
p22phox dimerize via two hemes to form flavocytochrome b558 (Cytb558) [16]. In phagocytic 
cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, activation of NOX2 occurs when a stimulus

 promotes the translocation of the cytosolic subunits to the plasma membrane where they 
assemble with Cytb558 to form a membrane-bound complex that generates superoxide 
radicals from NADPH and molecular oxygen [16]. NOX2 is expressed in the plasma 
membrane at the cell surface and at other intracellular sites such as lipid rafts and even in 
mitochondria [16]. Thus, the putative TSPO-NOX2 interaction raises important questions 
not only about the function of TSPO in microglia, but also about its subcellular localization. 
It is possible that in microglia, TSPO may have function(s) other than neurosteroid 
synthesis.
Cholesterol and Heme: a molecular basis for a TSPO-NOX2 interaction
A functional association between TSPO and NOX2 may be possible due to the ability of 
TSPO to bind both cholesterol [17, 18] and heme [19, 20]. As noted above, the NOX2 
subunits gp91phox and p22phox are synthesized as separate polypeptides in the ER. p65, the 
precursor of gp91phox, accepts two hemes in the ER and this allows assembly with p22phox 
for the formation, maturation and stability of the Cytb558 heterodimer [21–24]. This 
heterodimer is processed in the Golgi and traffics to the plasma membrane and other 
subcellular sites. In the absence of heme, gp91phox and p22phox do not associate, are retained 
in the ER, and are eventually degraded by the proteasome system [24]. Other studies have 
shown that cholesterol is needed for the translocation of the NOX2 cytosolic subunits to the 
plasma membrane or to lipid rafts to form an active NOX2 complex [25, 26]. Therefore, it is 
possible that TSPO participates in the generation of a functional NOX2 complex where 
TSPO behaves as a carrier or transporter for both cholesterol and heme [17–20].
Earlier studies in neutrophils have noted an unidentified 18kDa polypeptide in the 
membrane fraction that was also the antigen recognized by NOX2 inhibiting antibodies [27, 
28]. Further, a monoclonal antibody raised against TSPO was able to dose-dependently and 
specifically enhance NOX2 activity (i.e., the oxidative burst) in neutrophils [29]. These 
studies suggested a TSPO-NOX2 interaction but this interaction was not investigated further. 
From a clinical perspective, there is also data that supports a putative TSPO-NOX2 
interaction. Neutrophils from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease patients (X-CGD), an 
inherited phagocyte disease characterized by a deficiency in gp91phox with impaired 
superoxide production and bactericidal activity, expressed decreased TSPO levels [30]. 
However, neutrophils from autosomal recessive CGD patients, who express normal levels of 
gp91phox, have normal levels of TSPO suggesting that gp91phox may modulate TSPO levels 
[30]. Consistent with a putative TSPO interaction with NOX2, interferon-γ therapy used for 
the treatment of X-CGD patients, not only partially restored Cytb558 expression, but it also 
selectively restored TSPO levels in neutrophils [31]. These studies provide additional 
support for a putative TSPO-NOX2 functional interaction in phagocytic cells including 
microglia. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies from our laboratory using triple-label 
immunofluorescent confocal imaging of TSPO with gp91phox and the microglia marker 
Mac-1 indicate that TSPO and gp91phox colocalize in primary microglia providing 
additional support for a TSPO-NOX2 association [Figure 1].

 The mitochondria associated ER membrane (MAM): a subcellular site for a 
TSPO-NOX2 interaction?
It is now well recognized that there are points of communication between mitochondria and 
the ER. Specifically, the MAM in which the ER membrane is closely apposed to the outer 
mitochondria membrane [32–34]. MAM functions include lipid metabolism, calcium 
signaling and the formation of the inflammasome involved in innate immunity, amongst 
several other functions [32–34]. MAM is a protein complex consisting of the voltage-
dependent anion channel (VDAC), the ER calcium channel inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate 
receptor (IP3R), growth receptor protein 75 (GRP75), mitofusin 2, and cargo-sorting protein 
PACS2 [33–36]. TSPO is known to co-immunoprecipitate with VDAC and like VDAC, 
TSPO is highly expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane [35]. Thus, it is possible that 
TSPO may be associated with the MAM and chaperone or transfer heme from mitochondria 
to the p65 precursor of gp91phox in the ER for further processing with p22phox leading to 
Cytb558 formation [Figure 2]. In fact, studies have shown that the MAM is a subcellular site 
where heme transport occurs from mitochondria to the ER [36].
Evidence for a putative TSPO localization at the MAM also comes from a study in 
hormone-treated steroidogenic cells [37]. This study showed that hormone treatment of 
MA-10 cells results in a rapid and dramatic increase in the number of MAM contact sites 
formed. Other studies have shown the presence of high concentrations of cholesterol in 
MAM’s lipid rafts microdomains [38] that could serve as a platform for the transfer of 
cholesterol to mitochondria for steroidogenesis and facilitate the efflux of mitochondria-
synthesized steroids products and possibly heme out of mitochondria to the ER. Therefore, 
MAMs are subcellular sites in which TSPO, cholesterol and heme may be found in lipid 
rafts microdomains and lipid rafts could serve as an assembly platform for a TSPO-NOX2 
interaction.
Precedence for TSPO functioning as a membrane-bound protein for the transfer of heme/
porphyrins comes from studies in the gram negative bacterium Rhodobacter spheroides in 
which TspO, the TSPO homolog in Rhodobacter spheroides, has been shown to control the 
efflux of tetrapyrole intermediates of the heme/bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway 
[39]. This is relevant to the function of the mammalian TSPO because the ability of RsTSPO 
to efflux tetrapyroles can be replaced by TSPO from rats, indicating a highly conserved 
function [40].
Additional support for a heme transfer function for TSPO comes from the highly conserved 
tryptophan residues in the first periplasmic loop between the first and second membrane 
spanning domains [41, 42]. These tryptophan residues resemble a WWD heme-binding 
motif found in proteins involved in transmembrane heme delivery [43]. It has been 
hypothesized that the WWD domain binds heme to present it to an acceptor protein such that 
the heme vinyl groups attach to two reduced cysteinyl residues in the acceptor hemoprotein 
[43, 44]. This process prevents heme oxidation at the site of the transmembrane heme 
transfer.

 TSPO is a stress-response protein involved in redox homeostasis in 
microglia
TSPO levels are known to increase following brain injury and inflammation [2, 3] and 
studies have shown that TSPO ligands induce microglia functions (e.g. proliferation, 
phagocytosis and ROS production) similar to those associated with microglia activation [9]. 
Other studies have shown that increased TSPO expression is associated with resistance 
against ROS and hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity [45]. Conversely, knockdown of TSPO 
increases ROS production [46] suggesting that TSPO may participate in an antioxidant 
response pathway. The increase in TSPO levels that has been documented in microglia as a 
result of brain injury and inflammation may be associated with a microglial response for 
cell-autonomous protection from the high levels of ROS produced when microglia are 
activated. Further, increased TSPO may be needed to bind free heme released from 
hemoproteins as a result of oxidative stress [47].
The TSPO ligand-induced increase in NOX2-derived ROS documented in activated 
microglia [9] may serve as a cellular signal for the induction of redox sensitive transcription 
factors in order for microglia to maintain redox homeostasis. A transcription factor that is 
activated via redox signaling is Nrf2, which regulates the induction of a battery of over 600 
cytoprotective genes involved in redox homeostasis [48–51]. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is 
bound to Keap1 in the cytosol and this complex has a short half-life because Nrf2 is 
ubiquinated and degraded by the proteasome system [51, 52]. Keap1 contains a large 
number of highly reactive cysteine residues and oxidative stimuli can modify the cysteine 
residues in Keap1 releasing Nrf2 for translocation to the nucleus. Nrf2 together with Maf 
proteins is able to bind at the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of 
target genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) [53]. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 
particularly relevant enzyme because its function is to metabolize heme to carbon monoxide 
and biliverdin, which is further metabolized to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase [54]. Carbon 
monoxide and bilirubin have antioxidant properties and reduce inflammation in microglia 
[54].
Figure 3 indicates that Nrf2 is activated by ROS produced in microglia as a result of the 
TSPO-NOX2 interaction. We hypothesize that HO-1, one of the many Nrf2-dependent 
antioxidative genes, may be of importance for microglia since it degrades heme. Consistent 
with Figure 3, a previous study has shown that astrocytes release an active compound that is 
heat labile, smaller than 3 kDa, and induces HO-1 expression in microglia to prevent 
excessive inflammation [55]. The characteristics of this yet to be identified anti-
inflammatory peptide points to the endogenous TSPO ligand triakontatetraneuropeptide 
(TTN), a small peptide derived from diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) that is upregulated 
and released from astrocytes following injury [46]. Besides the induction of the HO-1 gene, 
other relevant antioxidant Nrf2-target genes, are those involved in glutathione synthesis; 
NADPH production; iron sequestration; quinone detoxification; and thioredoxin production, 
regeneration, and utilization [49–52]. Studies in primary microglia from Nrf2 knockout mice 
will be critical to understand the role of Nrf2 as a transducer of the putative TSPO-NOX2

 interaction for cell-autonomous protection from ROS and other toxic products generated by 
activated microglia.
Lessons learned from TspO in plant: a sensor of redox homeostasis and 
free heme
In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, TSPO is a tryptophan-rich sensory membrane protein that 
regulates abiotic stress [56]. Oxidative stress in plant cells is increased by treatment with the 
stress phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Abiotic stress regulates the expression of ABA-
responsive genes, including TspO [56]. ABA-induced expression of At-TSPO in vegetative 
tissue is transient, and the degradation of TSPO is enhanced by tetrapyrrole synthesis [56]. 
At-TSPO is a heme-binding protein whose degradation requires heme binding and a 
functional macroautophagy pathway [56].
Other studies show that the moss Physcomitrella patens has a gene encoding a homologous 
TSPO protein (PpTSPO1) that plays an important role in redox homeostasis following 
exposure to the fungal elicitor chitin [57]. PpTSPO1 knockout mutants have higher levels of 
ROS production than wild-type and constitutively higher levels of oxidative stress genes. 
These studies provide value insights on the putative TSPO-NOX2 interaction in microglia. 
The studies mentioned above and others provide strong evidence of a conserved stress 
response function of TSPO from bacteria to plants and in mammals [58].
Heme transporters generally belong to the ATP binding cassette protein family [59, 60]. 
However, some membrane proteins, similar to At-TSPO, can function as heme chaperones, 
as exemplified by CcmE in bacteria and Arabidopsis that can transfer heme to 
apocytochrome c [61]. Similarly, we hypothesize that TSPO in microglia may be able to 
transfer heme from mitochondria to the p65 precursor of gp91phox in the ER by forming a 
functional protein-protein complex at the MAM [Figure 2]. This would provide a 
mechanism for TSPO to modulate the expression of plasma membrane proteins such as 
Cytb558. This putative TSPO function in microglia is consistent with studies in Arabidopsis 
where abiotic-stress induced TSPO is able to regulate the cell surface expression of PIP2;7 
(aquaporin) by interacting with PIP2;7 at the ER and Golgi membranes [62]. Based on this 
literature and our own studies, we hypothesize that in primary microglia, stress induces the 
activation of TSPO for the transfer of TSPO bound heme from mitochondria to p65 in the 
ER, possibly via the MAM, in order for gp91phox to bind p22phox and form Cytb558. This 
complex is then transported to the plasma membrane, lipid rafts, or potentially even to the 
MAM. In this way, TSPO is able to modulate the expression of NOX2 in a similar fashion 
that has been shown for At-TSPO and PIP2;7 in plant.
Concluding Remarks
TSPO is a highly conserved and phylogenetically ancient protein that likely functions 
through conserved mechanism(s) to regulate protein expression and free heme involved in 
cellular stress responses. The proteins that TSPO interacts with and regulates may differ 
depending on the organism or cell system in which it is expressed. TSPO in microglia may 
have a protective role from the cell-autonomous generation of ROS and other toxic products

 that activated microglia generate. Thus, in microglia, endogenous TSPO ligands such as 
TTN that are released from activated astrocytes [46] may activate TSPO and promote 
NOX2-dependent ROS signaling for the induction of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes to 
maintain ROS homeostasis and prolong their lifespan. The induction of Nrf2-target genes 
such as HO-1 provides a negative feedback loop to modulate NOX2-induced ROS by 
regulating the level of heme available for Cytb558 formation or by degrading the heme in 
Cytb558, thus controlling Cytb558 levels and ROS production. The HO-1 degradation of heme 
in Cytb558 facilitates the degradation of gp91phox and p22phox by the proteasome system, 
thereby lowering Cytb558 and ROS levels. It is possible that when microglia are chronically 
activated, as often occurs in neurodegenerative diseases, the balance of the TSPO-NOX2-
Nrf2 interaction breaks down and the defense mechanisms are no longer able to regulate the 
level of ROS production. This would result in a chronic “toxic state” in which microglia-
induced ROS exceeds antioxidant defenses resulting in injury not only to microglia, but also 
to surrounding neurons, thereby causing neurodegeneration.
This Opinion article introduces a novel concept on the function of TSPO in redox 
homeostasis in microglia that is not associated with neurosteroid synthesis. Since the role of 
TSPO in steroid synthesis has been recently challenged, an understanding of TSPO 
function(s) in specific glial cell types and their interactions demands greater attention (see 
Outstanding Questions). An increased understanding of this putative TSPO-NOX2 
interaction in microglia is likely to prove beneficial for the development of novel therapeutic 
strategies to mitigate neuroinflammation.

Ro5-4864
7-Chloro-5-(4-clorophenyl)-1-methyl-3H-1,4-
benzodiazepin-2-one. The 4”-chloro derivative of diazepam 
is another synthetic TSPO specific ligand which lacks 
affinity for the GABAa receptor.
NOX2
A general term for Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide 
Phosphate Oxidase or NADPH Oxidase. A membrane 
bound enzyme complex that is present in the plasma 
membrane and other subcellular sites such as lipid rafts and 
phagosomes and serves to generate superoxide radicals for 
bactericidal activity in phagocytic cells. NOX has several 
isoforms including NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, and NOX4.
Nrf2
Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 Related Factor 2 is a basic 
leucine zipper transcription factor protein that regulates the 
expression of cytotoxic and antioxidative genes that are 
induced by neuroinflammation. Nrf2 is a regulator of 
cellular resistance to reactive oxygen species that can be 
induced by a variety of naturally occurring compounds 
such as sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate found in 
cruciferous vegetables.
Neuroinflammation
Microglia, the immune-competent cells of the brain are 
resident macrophages that exist in a resting state and 
survey the brain neuropil for disruption of cellular 
homeostasis. In response to brain injury, they rapidly 
transform into activated microglia and increase their 
proliferative capacity, phagocytic properties, express major 
histocompatibility complex antigens, and release reactive 
oxygen species, cytokines, nitrogen species, and 
chemokines. Neuroinflammation is believed to play a 
critical role in many neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

 Figure 2. The mitochondria associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM): a putative 
subcellular site for a TSPO-NOX2 association
We propose that the MAM is a subcellular site in which TSPO and NOX2 can interact by 
TSPO acting as a chaperone for the transfer of heme from mitochondria to the p65 precursor 
of gp91phox in order to facilitate Cytb558 formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The 
Cytb558 is further processed in the Golgi for transport to subcellular sites such as the plasma 
membrane, lipid rafts, and even potentially the MAM itself in which the formation of a 
NOX2 complex is active. This way, TSPO is able to modulate NOX2 levels under normal 
and stressed conditions.

 Figure 3. Working model on the function of TSPO in microglia
Injured neurons release soluble factors (1) that activate microglia and astrocytes. When 
activated, microglia generate and release ROS, NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines that 
could be damaging to neurons and to themselves (2*). We propose that signals originating 
from activated astrocytes (2) binds to TSPO in microglia and in astrocytes for different 
cellular functions. A signaling molecule known to be synthesized, and released by astrocytes 
is the Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) peptide fragment trikontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) 
that has pM affinity for TSPO [63]. TTN can act in an autocrine fashion in astrocytes to

 activate TSPO and potentially produce neurosteroids that may be helpful with repair 
mechanisms in injured neurons. On the other hand, in microglia, TSPO activation (3) may 
form a functional complex with NOX2 by providing heme and cholesterol to form an active 
Cytb558 complex (4) and generate ROS (5). The ROS can serve as an intracellular signal to 
translocate Nrf2 into the nucleus (6) for transcription of a battery of Nrf2-dependent 
antioxidant genes; for example heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), in order to maintain redox 
homeostasis during periods of stress. Relevant to this working model recent studies have 
shown NADPH oxidase as a novel upstream regulator of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling [64]. The 
induction of HO-1 can act as a negative feedback loop to decrease NOX2 activity by 
degrading heme to CO and billiverdin (7). The inhibition of heme synthesis has been shown 
to decrease NOX2 activity and to promote the degradation of gp91phox and p22phox proteins 
[65]. Further, CO and biliverdin have antioxidant properties [54], which could help mitigate 
inflammation in the brain.
