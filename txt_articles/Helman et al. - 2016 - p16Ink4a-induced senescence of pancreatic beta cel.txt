Abstract
Cellular senescence is thought to contribute to age-associated deterioration of tissue physiology. 
The senescence effector p16Ink4a is expressed in pancreatic beta cells during aging and limits their 
proliferative potential; however, its effects on beta cell function are poorly characterized. We found 
that beta cell-specific activation of p16Ink4a in transgenic mice enhances glucose-stimulated 
insulin secretion (GSIS). In mice with diabetes, this leads to improved glucose homeostasis, 
providing an unexpected functional benefit. Expression of p16Ink4a in beta cells induces hallmarks 
of senescence—including cell enlargement, and greater glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity

 —which promote increased insulin secretion. GSIS increases during the normal aging of mice and 
is driven by elevated p16Ink4a activity. We found that islets from human adults contain p16Ink4a-
expressing senescent beta cells and that senescence induced by p16Ink4a in a human beta cell line 
increases insulin secretion in a manner dependent, in part, on the activity of the mechanistic target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ proteins. Our 
findings reveal a novel role for p16Ink4a and cellular senescence in promoting insulin secretion by 
beta cells and in regulating normal functional tissue maturation with age.
Aged tissues typically show decreased regenerative capacity and deterioration in overall 
function. Cellular senescence is thought to contribute to tissue aging and associated 
pathologies through various means, including the limitation of stem cell proliferation and the 
secretion of negatively acting paracrine factors1,2. Senescence is often viewed as a stress-
response program that is activated in damaged cells, and senescent cells accumulate in aging 
tissues, as well as in premalignant lesions. Senescence occurs in a variety of additional 
physiological settings1,2, and it was recently shown to also contribute to embryonic 
development3,4.
The tumor suppressor protein p16Ink4a (hereafter referred to as p16; encoded from the 
CDKN2A locus) is often transcriptionally activated in cells undergoing senescence and is 
one of the main regulators of this program5, p16 is upregulated in multiple tissues during 
aging6–8 and contributes to age-associated decline in tissue function and regenerative 
capacity9–13. The main function of p16 is the inhibition of complexes of cyclin D and the 
cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, through which it activates the RB1 tumor 
suppressor protein. RB1, often acting together with p53, induces chromatin modifications 
that lead to senescence-associated reprogramming of gene expression14. This results in 
complex phenotypic changes in cytoskeletal structure and metabolism—including enhanced 
protein turnover and secretion, and increased glucose uptake and oxidative 
phosphorylation15–17. The manner in which senescence affects cell functionality remains 
poorly understood.
Glucose tolerance deteriorates with age, reflecting reduced responsiveness of beta cells to 
glucose stimulation and reduced responsiveness of peripheral tissues to insulin18–20. Beta 
cell proliferation declines dramatically at an early age, potentially contributing to a reduced 
beta cell mass and an increased risk of diabetes with age21. Expression of p16 increases in 
beta cells during aging, inhibiting their regenerative capacity9,22. Genetic polymorphisms in 
the CDKN2A locus are associated with type 2 diabetes23; however, their functional 
consequences are unknown. Components of the cell cycle machinery, including CDK4, RB1 
and the E2F family of transcription factors, have been implicated in various aspects of 
glucose homeostasis, including short-term responses to glucose stimulation by beta cells and 
responses to insulin by peripheral tissues24–28. However, it is unknown whether the age-
associated elevation of p16 expression in beta cells leads to cellular senescence and whether 
such cells remain functional. Here we report that increased p16 activity enhances insulin 
secretion by beta cells upon glucose simulation. We found that p16 drives beta cell 
senescence during normal aging and that features of the senescence program—including

 increased cell size, elevated glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity—enhance the 
capacity of beta cells to secrete insulin after glucose stimulation.
RESULTS
p16 induces beta cell senescence
To study the effects of p16 expression on beta cell function, we generated mice that express 
the coding sequence for human p16 (which we refer to as p16) under the control of a 
tetracycline (tet)-inducible promoter (hereafter referred to as tet-p16 mice). We crossed these 
mice with Ins2-rtTA mice, in which the reverse tetracycline-controlled trans-activator 
protein (rtTA) is expressed from the promoter of the rat insulin 2 gene (Ins2). To activate 
p16 in beta cells, we treated double-transgenic Ins2-rtTA;tet-p16 mice with tet for 10 d 
starting at 3–4 weeks of age. Transgenic p16 was detected by immunostaining in ~35% of 
beta cells (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Staining for the cell proliferation marker 
Ki67 revealed that whereas 3.5% of beta cells in control (Ins2-rtTA) mice were proliferating, 
p16-expressing beta cells in the Ins2-rtTA;tet-p16 mice were nonproliferative (Fig. 1b,c). 
Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA–β-Gal) activity and expression of the lysosomal 
marker Lamp2a were increased in p16-expressing islets, indicating that p16 induces features 
of senescence (Fig. 1d,e). Notably, p16-expressing beta cells were ~l.3-fold larger than 
control beta cells, as measured by both FACS and image analysis (Fig. 1f–h). Consistent 
with this, islets of p16-expressing mice had higher levels of phosphorylated ribosomal 
protein S6 (Rps6), a target of the mTOR protein and a regulator of beta cell size29 (Fig. 1i 
and Supplementary Fig. 1b).
To isolate a population of beta cells enriched for p16 expression, we generated Ins2-rtTA;tet-
p16;tet-GFP triple-transgenic mice, such that most of the p16+ cells would also express 
green fluorescent protein (GFP). We treated these and control Ins2-rtTA;tet-GFP mice with 
tet for 10 d, dissociated their islets and isolated GFP+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We 
compared the transcriptomes of p16-expressing and control GFP+ beta cells and found that 
gene sets associated with cell proliferation were downregulated in p16-expressing beta cells, 
whereas gene sets that were previously shown to be elevated in senescent cells were 
upregulated (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Table 1). Notably, these 
latter sets were derived from diverse biological settings, including chemotherapy-treated 
lymphoma cells, Ras oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and fìbrotic liver stellate cells15,30–33. 
Genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and some secreted proteins were also upregulated (Fig. 
1j and Supplementary Table 1). mRNA levels of the p53 transcription factor target genes 
Cdkn1a, which encodes p21Cip1, and SerpinE2, which encodes Pail, a marker of senescence, 
were higher in p16-expressing cells; however, expression of other target genes was not 
substantially induced, and p53 protein itself was not detected (Supplementary Fig. 2c–f). 
Thus, p16 expression is sufficient to activate hallmarks of the senescence gene-expression 
program in beta cells.
Key markers and regulators of beta cell differentiation were minimally changed after p16 
expression (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d), indicating that the cells maintained their identity. 
However, we observed upregulation of genes whose expression increases in adult versus 
neonatal beta cells concomitant with the acquisition of functionality34 (Fig. 1j and 
Helman et al.

 Supplementary Fig. 3e). Polycomb repressive complex target genes (i.e., genes bound by 
trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) in embryonic stem cells) were 
upregulated, as were additional sets associated with beta cell differentiation and aging22,35 
(Fig. 1j and Supplementary Fig. 3f). These findings suggested that p16 and senescence 
enhance aspects of beta cell maturation.
p16 increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
To directly study the effect of p16 expression on beta cell function, we isolated pancreatic 
islets from p16-expressing and control mice after 10 d of tet treatment and measured GSIS. 
Islets from the two groups of mice secreted similar levels of insulin after incubation in 
medium with low concentrations of glucose; however, after glucose stimulation, p16-
expressing islets secreted ~2.5-fold more insulin than control islets (Fig. 2a).
This difference was evident when the insulin concentrations were normalized to total insulin 
and protein content in the islet samples, or to beta cell numbers (Fig. 2a,b and 
Supplementary Fig. 4a). High GSIS was also observed after p16 induction in sexually 
mature mice (Supplementary Fig. 4b), as well as after 2 months of p16 induction, indicating 
a stable phenotypic change in beta cell function (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Furthermore, we 
found that p16-expressing beta cells had ~ 1.5-fold higher intracellular insulin content than 
control beta cells (Fig. 2c). Thus, p16 expression increases the capacity of beta cells to 
release insulin following glucose stimulation.
p16 induction improves glucose tolerance in mice with diabetes
Improved beta cell function could be expected to alter physiological glucose tolerance. Ins2-
rtTA;tet-p16 mice were, however, not suitable for testing this hypothesis, as they suffered 
from decreased overall beta cell mass owing to low tet-independent p16 expression 
(Supplementary Fig. 4d–g). We therefore tested the effects of p16 induction in Pdx1-tTA 
mice, in which the tet transactivator protein (tTA) is expressed from the gene encoding the 
pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 transcription factor (Pdx1). These mice are deficient in 
one allele of the Pdx1 gene, mimicking a monogenic familial form of diabetes, maturity-
onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 4 (refs. 36,37). Because the hyperglycemia in these 
mice is caused by impaired beta cell function rather than by systemic abnormalities, they 
were particularly suitable for this analysis37. Furthermore, the Pdx1-tTA transgene allowed 
tightly regulated beta cell-specific activation of the tet-p16 transgene (Supplementary Fig. 
5a).
We induced p16 expression in 1-month-old Pdx1-tTA;tet-p16 mice for 2 weeks. Glucose 
tolerance was improved in these mice as compared to the hyperglycemic Pdx1 -tTA mice, 
indicating that p16 expression partially reverses the impaired function of beta cells (Fig. 2d). 
Serum insulin levels following glucose injection were higher in Pdx1-tTA;tet-p16 mice than 
in Pdx1 -tTA mice, accounting for their improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 2e). Beta cells of 
p16-expressing mice were larger than those of Pdx1-tTA mice, which were smaller than 
those of wild-type (WT) mice (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Sensitivity to insulin and body mass 
were not significantly affected by p16 expression (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 5c),

 consistent with the conclusion that increased insulin secretion by beta cells was the primary 
cause of improved glucose tolerance.
After 2 months of p16 induction, Pdx1-tTA;tet-p16 mice still showed improved glucose 
tolerance (Fig. 2g); however, after 5 months of induction their glucose tolerance deteriorated 
to levels observed in Pdx1-tTA mice (Fig. 2h). At this time point, beta cell mass was 
substantially lower in these mice, presumably due to reduced beta cell proliferation, and this 
could account for the decline in glucose tolerance (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 5d).
p16 enhances glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity
Insulin secretion is primarily controlled by oxidative metabolism of glucose in the 
mitochondria, resulting in increased cellular ATP levels, which in turn causes membrane 
depolarization, calcium influx and insulin release38. Recent studies have shown that 
senescence involves enhanced glucose uptake and metabolism14–17. We found that p16-
expressing beta cells upregulated genes associated with glucose metabolism (Fig. 1j), 
including Aldob, which encodes the glycolytic enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, 
and Gck, which encodes glucokinase, the enzyme that controls glucose uptake and 
glycolysis rates (Fig. 3a). Consistent with this, the glucose uptake rate in cells isolated from 
p16-expressing islets was 1.7-fold higher than that in cells isolated from control islets (Fig. 
3b).
The levels of peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha 
(Ppargc1a; hereafter referred to as Pgc-1α)—the master transcription factor controlling 
mitochondrial biogenesis— were higher in p16-expressing beta cells than in controls (Fig. 
3c). We found that, indeed, p16-expressing beta cells contained higher numbers of 
mitochondria, as assessed by electron microscopy, stains of mitochondrial markers and 
quantification of mitochondrial DNA content (Fig. 3d–g). Furthermore, mitochondrial 
membrane potential, an indicator of mitochondrial activity, was higher in p16-expressing 
beta cells (Fig. 3h). p16-expressing islets consumed more oxygen in basal conditions and in 
response to glucose stimulation than control islets (Fig. 3i). Thus, p16 expression in beta 
cells leads to elevated levels of glucose uptake, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial 
respiration, providing a link to higher GSIS.
Endogenous p16 drives an increase in GSIS capacity with age
We next asked whether endogenous p16, whose expression increases in beta cells with age9, 
influences insulin secretion. Islets isolated from WT mice at 6, 11 and 27 months of age 
showed higher GSIS than islets of 1-month-old (juvenile) mice, concomitant with their 
higher p16 levels (Fig. 4a,b). Beta cells of the more mature mice had lower proliferation 
rates, were larger and had higher SA–β-Gal activity (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). 
Notably, unlike p16-overexpressing transgenic mice, islets of mature WT mice showed 
higher insulin secretion than those of juvenile mice also at low concentrations of glucose; 
the fold change in insulin secretion between high and low glucose concentrations was 
therefore unchanged during aging (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6b,c).
To study whether p16 contributes to the higher GSIS observed in mature mice, we examined 
the pancreata of p16-deficient mice. As previously reported9, the number of proliferating

 beta cells was approximately twofold higher in 6- and 12-month-old p16-deficient mice than 
in WT control mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, GSIS of islets from mature p16-
deficient mice was lower than that of control mouse islets, and the beta cells from these p16-
deficient mice were smaller (Fig. 4e,f), indicating that endogenous p16 promotes increased 
beta cell size and GSIS with age.
The main function of p16 is the inhibition of CDK4 (ref. 5). We therefore tested whether 
expression of a constitutively active CDK4 would mimic the effect of p16 deficiency and 
reduce GSIS. To do this we crossed mice carrying a conditional knocked-in mutated 
CDK4R24C allele (CDK4+/lsl-R24C mice)39 with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre 
under the control of the mouse insulin promoter (MIP-CreER)40 (Supplementary Fig. 6d). 
We activated the translation of the CDK4R24C protein in beta cells by tamoxifen injection 
and collected islets 2 weeks later. Islets from MIP-CreER;CDK4+/R24C mice showed lower 
GSIS than those of control mice, recapitulating the effects of p16 deficiency (Fig. 4g). This 
finding supports the hypothesis that p16 enhances GSIS through CDK4 inhibition.
Beta cell senescence in human islets
We next tested whether beta cell senescence occurs in humans. Immunostaining of human 
islets revealed that p16 expression was higher in aged subjects than in young subjects, and 
that p16 mRNA levels were similarly elevated with age (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Table 
2). We dissociated live human islets obtained from recently deceased middle-aged human 
subjects and co-stained the cells for p16 and insulin (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 1). 
This analysis identified a subset of p16+ beta cells, and these cells had a larger mean volume 
than p16− beta cells from the same islets (Fig. 5c,d). As in p16-expressing transgenic mice, 
levels of phosphorylated S6 were higher in aged versus young subjects (Fig. 5e and 
Supplementary Fig. 7a).
Live, dissociated human islets obtained from middle-aged donors contained a substantial 
fraction of SA–β-Gal+ cells (range 40–60% of cells; mean ± s.d., 50% ± 8% cells; n = 5) 
(Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 3). We obtained one sample from a young (14-year-old) 
subject, which did not contain SA–β-Gal+ cells (Fig. 5f). SA–β-Gal+ cells from adult islets 
contained more active mitochondria than SA–β-Gal− cells from the same islets (Fig. 5g). In 
addition, sections of pancreas from middle-aged subjects showed higher levels of 
mitochondrial proteins than those from young subjects (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. 7b). 
Together, these findings indicate that during human aging p16-expressing senescent beta 
cells accumulate in islets and that these cells are larger in size and have increased 
mitochondrial numbers and activity.
p16-induced senescence of human cells increases GSIS
We next tested whether senescence of human cells leads to increased insulin secretion. 
EndoC-βH2 cells are a line of human fetal pancreas-derived insulin-expressing cells that 
was propagated by introduction of the SV40 large T antigen and the human telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (TERT) genes41. Cre-mediated excision of these immortalizing genes 
re-activates RBI and p53, causing the cells to cease dividing and to increase insulin 
expression and secretion41. We found that EndoC-βH2 cells infected with a Cre-expressing 
Helman et al.

 lentivirus acquired a senescent morphology and had high levels of SA–β-Gal activity, 
consistent with the known roles of RBI and p53 in senescence induction (Fig. 6a,b). This 
was accompanied by a substantial elevation in insulin secretion (Fig. 6c,d). Senescent 
EndoC-βH2 cells were larger, and had higher glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity, 
than control cells (Fig. 6e).
EndoC-βH2 cells expressed the endogenous p16, and its expression level was further 
elevated after the introduction of Cre (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). To test whether p16 drives 
senescence and enhanced GSIS in the EndoC-βH2 cells, we generated cells in which p16 
expression was stably silenced by a short hairpin RNA targeting the p16 transcript (shp16). 
We then infected these cells with a Cre-expressing virus to activate RBI and p53. We found 
that although p16-silenced cells stopped dividing after Cre expression, they showed 
substantially lower levels of SA–β-Gal activity than p16-expressing cells (Fig. 6f and 
Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). Notably, the p16-silenced cells did not show increased GSIS 
capacity or increased mitochondrial activity after Cre expression (Fig. 6g,h). These findings 
indicate that endogenous p16 expression is necessary for the entry of these human cells into 
senescence and for the acquisition of enhanced GSIS.
mTOR and PPAR-γ contribute to enhanced GSIS in senescent cells
Given the known roles of mTOR in regulating beta cell size and mitochondrial biogenesis 
and function29,42–44, we tested the effects of its inhibition on EndoC-βH2 cells undergoing 
senescence. Cells treated with the kinase inhibitor Torin1 after introduction of Cre had lower 
levels of insulin secretion, as well as reduced size and mitochondrial activity, than untreated 
cells (Fig. 6i and Supplementary Fig. 8e,f).
Inhibition of PPAR-γ, the binding partner of PGC-1α, by treatment with GW9662 also 
resulted in lower GSIS and mitochondrial activity in Cre-expressing EndoC-βH2 cells (Fig. 
6i and Supplementary Fig. 8g). The activities of mTOR and PPAR-γ thus contribute to 
increased GSIS during senescence (Fig. 6j).
DISCUSSION
p16 expression increases in human and mouse beta cells with age, and previous work 
showed that this contributes to their reduction in regenerative capacity9,22. Our findings 
indicate that p16 concomitantly improves the primary function of beta cells, glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 6j). We find that GSIS increases during normal aging of 
mice and that this functional improvement is driven by p16. This provides a novel view of 
beta cell maturation during healthy aging that includes functional enhancement. In the 
setting of hyperglycemia, p16 expression provided a substantial physiologic benefit within 
days, which was stably maintained. Our observations of increased p16 expression and 
senescence in human islets, and our experiments in human cells, strongly suggest that 
senescence-induced enhancement of GSIS is conserved between mice and humans, and 
point to p16 as its main driver in both organisms.
Beta cell proliferative capacity and functionality appear to be at mutual expense. Because 
adult beta cells rarely proliferate, the functional benefit of p16 activity may be prominent at

 early stages of its expression. However, after prolonged periods of p16 expression beta cell 
mass may diminish owing to loss of self-duplication45, and this could lead to deficient 
glucose tolerance with age. This is illustrated by the deterioration in glucose tolerance that 
we observed in Pdx1-tTA;tet-p16 mice after 5 months of p16 induction.
Measurement of beta cell function in vivo is challenging because of the complex dynamics 
of insulin release and uptake, the responses of peripheral tissues and the systemic changes in 
glucose levels. Insulin secretion is often measured as the fold change between fasting and 
glucose-stimulated states, and this parameter is generally reduced with age, consistent with 
overall reduced glucose tolerance18–20. However, in human subjects, both basal and 
stimulated insulin secretion levels have been documented to increase with age18, and we 
observed the same phenomenon in mice. A recent study in which beta cell function was 
monitored in thousands of subjects over a 10-year period revealed that insulin secretion does 
indeed rise with age in healthy subjects46.
We established the enhancement of GSIS by p16 in ex vivo experiments, in which systemic 
effects are absent, as well as in vivo, in the context of hyperglycemia. Notably, p16 
overexpression or loss of function affected insulin secretion at high, but not low, glucose 
levels, p16 thus appears to control this particular component of the age-associated changes 
in beta cell function, whereas additional factors may affect other parameters that contribute 
to the overall deterioration of beta cell function and glucose homeostasis.
Activation of RBI through CDK4 inhibition is the central well-established function of p16, 
and RBI is the main regulator of the chromatin reprogramming that leads to 
senescence5,30,47–49. Our findings indeed suggest that p16 induces beta cell senescence and 
enhanced GSIS through CDK4 and RBI. CDK4 overactivation in mouse beta cells reduced 
GSIS, mimicking p16 deficiency, whereas in human cells, high endogenous p16 levels 
induced senescence and GSIS only after RBI and p53 were released from inhibition by the 
SV40 large T antigen. However, the specific downstream components that are most 
important in mediating the senescence-associated increase in GSIS remain to be elucidated.
Senescence involves a coordinated reprogramming of cell structure and function. Multiple 
parameters indicate that the senescence program was activated in p16-expressing beta cells, 
including the induction of SA–β-Gal activity, the expression of markers such as Lamp2a and 
SerpinE2 and the upregulation of multiple senescence-associated gene sets. Inherent features 
of the senescence program appear to have been co-opted in beta cells to enhance insulin 
secretion (Fig. 6j). This provides an example of senescence having a role in enhancing 
normal cellular functionality, rather than leading to cell dysfunction. Enlarged cell size is a 
hallmark of senescence, which, to date, has been described mostly in cultured cells; p16 
expression and senescence consistently increased beta cell size, a feature associated with 
increased secretory capacity29,50. The inhibition of EndoC-βH2 cell enlargement by 
treatment with Torin1 indicates that this feature is mediated in part by mTOR.
Increased glucose uptake, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis have 
recently been highlighted as key features of senescence and are driven, at least in some 
cases, by RBI (refs. 15–17,51,52). These metabolic changes, which we showed to occur in

 senescent mouse beta cells and human cells, provide a mechanistic link to insulin secretion, 
which is directly regulated by ATP levels38. Our findings indicate that mTOR and PPAR-γ, 
the latter potentially functioning together with PGC-1α, contribute to the increased 
mitochondrial activity observed in senescence.
Genes associated with the functional maturation of beta cells were upregulated in p16-
expressing beta cells, suggesting that senescence leads to enhanced differentiation of these 
cells, potentially through reduced activity of Polycomb. This is consistent with recent work 
suggesting that aging-associated changes in chromatin structure increase beta cell 
maturation and function53.
The finding that senescence regulates insulin secretion has broad implications for the 
understanding and treatment of diseases involving beta cell malfunction and highlights the 
potential effects of drugs that target senescence and the cell cycle on beta cell function. 
PPAR-γ agonists are well-described therapies for type 2 diabetes that influence peripheral-
tissue responses to insulin54; our findings demonstrate the potential importance of this 
pathway to beta cell function during aging. Additionally, our findings raise the possibility 
that p16-expressing beta cells in aged subjects may show increased sensitivity to mTOR 
inhibition by a variety of drugs that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
Efforts to develop drugs that eliminate senescent cells from tissues for the potential 
treatment of aging-associated pathologies are ongoing2,55. These are motivated, in part, by 
recent studies demonstrating that elimination of p16-expressing cells alleviates aging-
associated tissue degeneration and extends mouse lifespan12,13. In parallel, drugs that induce 
senescence are being developed, mainly for cancer treatment56. Notable among the latter are 
inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6, which in essence mimic p16 activity. The first of these was 
recently approved for breast cancer treatment57. Our findings suggest that the potential 
effects of both classes of drugs on beta cell function should be taken into consideration and 
that the elimination of p16-expressing senescent beta cells may have negative effects on 
glucose homeostasis.
Overall, our findings highlight an important new aspect of senescence as a fundamental 
program that enhances cellular function during tissue maturation and aging. Although 
cumulative stress could potentially cause p16 activation and senescence in beta cells, our 
data suggest that p16 may, in fact, be activated as a component of the normal maturation of 
beta cells, executing a programmed developmental role not triggered by stress.

rtTA transgene only or the Ins2-rtTA and tet-GFP transgenes (as indicated in the Figures), 
received identical drug treatments. For induction using the Pdx1-tTA driver (tet off), all mice 
were treated with tetracycline from inception, and tetracycline was removed from drinking 
water to initiate p16 expression. We obtained p16-deficient mice60 (FVB background) from 
the National Cancer Institute Mouse Repository We crossed CDK4+/lsl-R24C mice, which 
carry the CDKR24C allele preceded by a lox-stop-lox (lsl) cassette39, with MIP-CreER 
mice40 (both on mixed ICR background) and injected 6-week-old double transgenic mice 
with two daily doses of 8 mg tamoxifen (Sigma; 20 mg/ml in corn oil) subcutaneously to 
obtain beta cell-specific activation of CDK4R24C. C57BL/6 and FVB mice were obtained 
from Harlan, Israel. Glucose tolerance tests and in vivo GSIS assays were conducted as 
previously described61. Fasted mice received glucose by intraperitoneal injection (2 mg per 
kg body weight (mg/kg)), and blood glucose or serum insulin levels were measured at the 
indicated time points. For insulin-tolerance tests we injected fasted mice with 0.75 units per 
kg body weight insulin (Humalog) intraperitoneally and measured blood glucose at the 
indicated time points. We conducted all experiments using sibling littermate control and 
experimental mice; where necessary experimental groups were comprised of multiple litters 
to allow statistical power. Experiments using tet-p16 mice included both males and females. 
We used only males in experiments with aging and p16-deficient mice, for convenience. The 
joint Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Hebrew University and Hadassah 
Medical Center approved the study protocol for animal welfare. The Hebrew University is 
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care 
International.
Human islets
We obtained live human islets for FACS analysis from pancreata of brain-dead subjects as 
previously described62, under approval of the Health Research Ethics Board of the 
University of Alberta and following informed consent. Subject details are presented in 
Supplementary Table 2. Several hundreds of islets were obtained from each donor, and these 
were dissociated before staining. For mRNA extraction, we obtained adult human islets from 
Integrated Islet Distribution program (http://iidp.coh.org/) as previously described63,64. 
Adult human islets were from four female and five male donors (age, 44.7 ± 4.2 years 
(range, 20–60 years); body mass index, 25.02 ± 0.84 kg/m2 (range, 21.2–29.1 kg/m2)). The 
cold-ischemia time before pancreas isolation was 12.18 ± 2.48 h. Nine normal juvenile 
pancreata were used in this study (6-months-old, n =1; 14-month-old, n =1; 20-month-old, 
n=1; 3-year-old, n = 2; 4-year-old n = 1; 5-year-old, n = 2 9-year-old, n = 1) via a protocol 
with the National Disease Research Interchange and International Institute for the 
Advancement of Medicine. De-identified human islet studies were approved by the 
Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board.

 Ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays
We isolated islets from whole pancreata using collagenase P (Roche) that was injected to the 
pancreatic ducts, followed by isolation on a Histopaque gradient (Sigma). Islets were 
incubated overnight in RPMI-1640 medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% 
FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. 30–40 islets 
were handpieked for each assay replicate, placed in basal Krebs buffer (118 mM NaCl, 4.7 
mM KC1, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 4.2 mM NaHCO3 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM 
HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 2.8 mM glucose (Sigma) and then transferred into Krebs buffer 
containing 16.7 mM glucose. Medium was collected after a 1-h incubation at each glucose 
concentration, and islets were then pelleted and solubilized. Insulin concentrations were 
measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Crystal Chem Inc.). Insulin 
concentrations in the medium were normalized to insulin levels in the islet lysate of each 
sample, which is indicative of beta cell numbers. Islets from each mouse were assayed in 
triplicate. Where indicted islets from three or more mice were pooled and assayed in five 
replicates. In the experiment in Figure 2b, insulin concentrations in the medium were 
normalized to the beta cell number in each sample (pooled from four or more mice), as 
scored by FACS following islet dissociation and staining for insulin.
FACS analysis
For flow cytometry analyses, we dissociated mouse or human islets into a single-cell 
suspension with trypsin-EDTA treatment for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by treatment with a 
cell fixation and permeabilization solution (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed on 
a M ACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec). For all of the mouse analyses, we pooled cells 
from three or more mice in each group. Human islets were analyzed independently for each 
subject after acquisition. Antibody staining was performed using standard procedures using 
antibodies to the proteins described below as well as to: Ki67 (BD 558615; 1:50), mouse 
p16 (Santa Cruz sc-1207; 1:100) and Lamp2a (Ab cam ab 18528; 1:1,000). SA–β-Gal 
activity was assayed using the fluorescent β-galactosidase substrate C12FDG (Invitrogen 
D-2893), as described65. Briefly we incubated dissociated islet cells with 33 μM Cı2FDG for 
1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking and then scored fluorescent cells by FACS. For Mitotracker 
staining, dissociated islet cells were incubated with 200 nM Mito Tracker Green (Life 
Technologies) for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Cells were washed once and scored by 
FACS. For staining with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE), we 
incubated dissociated islet cells with 7 nM TMRE (Life Technologies) for 1 h at 37 °C in 
Krebs solution containing 3 or 20 mM glucose, with gentle shaking. For the glucose uptake 
assay we incubated dissociated islet cells with 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-
yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) (Life Technologies, N13195) for 30 min at 37 °C in 
Krebs buffer containing 3 mM glucose, with gentle shaking.
Oxygen-consumption measurement
We measured real-time mitochondrial oxygen-con sumption rates using the XF24 
extracellular flux analyzer instrument (Seahorse Bioscience). Islets were rinsed with sodium 
bicarbonate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.5% 
BSA and 3 mM glucose, and 40 islets were distributed per well, with five replicate wells per

 group. After baseline measurements, we injected the following: glucose (20 mM), carbonyl 
cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 5 μM), and rotenone and antimycin 
A (5 μM). The respiratory rate of each islet sample was measured at 37 °C and analyzed. 
Oxygen-consumption levels were normalized to the insulin content of islets in each well and 
are shown relative to the value of the control islets incubated in medium with the low 
glucose concentration, which was defined as 1.
Tissue-section staining and analysis
We performed tissue processing for section staining as previously described61, using 
antibodies to the following proteins: insulin (DakoCytomation; 1:400), Ki67 (NeoMarkers 
RM9106S0; 1:200), Pdxl (gift from Christopher Wright, Vanderbilt University; 1:2,500), 
Nkx6.1 (Beta Cell Biology Consortium; 1:500), chromogranin A(NovusNBl20-15160; 
1:200), human p16 (Abeam abl08349; 1:500) human p16 (BD 551153; 1:200), p2l (Santa 
Cruz sc-397; 1:100), pS6 (Cell Signaling 5364; 1:1,000), E-cadherin (BD Pharmingen 
610182; 1:50), Atp5a (Abeam abl4748; 1:100), Coxl7 (Novus NBP1-19696; 1:100) and 
Ndufb (Sigma HPA005640; 1:100). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Fluorescent images were taken on a Nikon CI confocal 
microscope at 400× magnification. To calculate cell size we stained sections for E-cadherin 
(Cdhl) and measured cell circumference using the Image J Software. > 100 cells from six 
mice in each group were scored. Values shown are for p16+ beta cells in p16- induced mice 
and for beta cells in control mice. To determine expression levels of p16, pS6 and 
mitochondrial markers in stained islet sections of human subjects, we used the NIS-
Elements software (Nikon) to measure the mean intensity per section area of the fluorescent 
signal within islets and divided it by the mean intensity per area of the signal in the 
surrounding acinar tissue in the same field to account for differential staining background. 
>10 islets per subject were scored. For beta cell area determination, we stained paraffin-
embedded tissue sections 50 μm apart, spanning the entire pancreas, for insulin and 
hematoxylin. 40× magnification images were obtained and merged, and the fraction of tissue 
stained for insulin was determined using NIS-Elements software.
RNA extraction, qRT-PCR and expression profiling
We isolated GFP+ cells by FACS from dissociated islets of Ins2-rtTA;tet-GFP.;tet-p16 mice 
and control Ins2-rtTA;tet- GFP mice, following tet treatment for 10 d. Total RNA was 
isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction followed by RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen), 
using ~50,000 beta cells from two control and three p16-expressing mice. Libraries were 
prepared and sequenced using Illuminas directional RNA sequencing protocol (Hi-seq). 
Reads were mapped using TopHat2, and quantification and normalization were done using 
Cuffdiff66 to produce gene level-normalized expression values (fragments per kb of exon per 
millions FPKMs) and significance values. Up- and downregulated genes with P < 0.05 were 
tested for enrichment of gene sets using the hyper geometric method, using false-discovery 
rate (FDR) < 0.05. Gene sets were derived from MSigDB or KEGG, or compiled from the 
literature as described in Supplementary Table 1. Total RNA extraction from human islets 
and qRT-PCR were performed as previously described63, using the TaqMan primer-probes 
for p16(Hs00923894_ml) and ACTB (Hs99999903_ml) as a control, with reagents from 
Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).

 Transmission electron microscopy
Islets from five mice in each group were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% 
glutaraldehyde (EMS), post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (Sigma) and dehydrated with 
increasing concentrations of ethanol followed by propylene oxide treatment (Sigma). For 
embedding we used Agar 100 resin (Agar Scientific). For imaging we stained 80-nm 
sections with 5% uranyl acetate for 10 min, followed by 10-min staining with lead citrate. 
We visualized samples with a Technai 12 Phillips transmission electron microscope 
equipped with a MegaView II charged-couple device (CCD) camera. To measure relative 
mitochondrial area we used NIS Elements software.
Mitochondrial DNA quantification
To measure mitochondrial DNA copy number, we isolated DNA from sorted GFP+ beta cells 
by standard phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. qPCR was used to 
evaluate the ratio between the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mt-Cytb) and the LI 
repetitive element (nuclear) using the following primers sequences: mt-Cytb: 5′-
GCAGTCATAGCCACAGCATTT-3′ and 5′-AAGTGGAAAGC GAAGAATCG-3′, LI: 5′- 
GTTACAGAGACGGAGTTTGGAG- 3′ and 5′-CGTTTGGATGCTGATTATGGG-3′.
Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from fresh islets by RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with the protease 
and phosphatase inhibitors leupeptin, aprotonin and vanadate (Sigma). Total protein 
concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). 
Antibodies used were against Pgc-1α (Abeam ab54481 1:2,000) and Hsp90 (Calbiochem 
CA1016• 1:5,000).
Human EndoC-βH2 cells
EndoC-βH2 cells were newly obtained from R. Scharfmann and Endocell, with no further 
authentication or testing for mycoplasma. Cells were cultured on Matrigel- and fibronectin-
coated wells as previously described41. Cells were infected with a lentivirus coexpressing 
Cre and GFP (Addgene #20781) or expressing GFP only (pRRL-GFP); in Figure 6e (right 
panel), g,h,i (right panel), Cre was expressed using the pTRIPΔU3-CMV-nlsCre vector41, 
and the pLKO.1-Puro empty vector was used as a lentiviral empty vector control. For p16 
silencing a pLKO.1-Puro-shp16 was used, carrying the targeting sequence: 
GCATGGAGCCTTCGGCTGACT. Viruses were produced by co-transfection of backbones 
into 293T cells with the packaging vectors pHRΔ8.2 and pCMV-VSV-G, followed by 
medium collection and centrifugal concentration. Cells were maintained for 3 weeks after 
infection. We performed SA–β-Gal and TMRE staining as well as cell size and insulin 
secretion assays, 3 weeks after infection. SA–β-Gal staining was conducted as previously 
described65. For GSIS, cells were plated 3 weeks after infection in 96-well plates at 3.5 × 
104 cells/well for control cells and 7 × 104 cells/well for Cre- expressing cells. Seven days 
later, cells were incubated overnight in culture medium that contained 2.8 mM glucose and 
then in Krebs buffer that contained 2.8 mM glucose for 60 min. Medium was collected and 
the cells were then incubated in Krebs buffer containing 16.7 mM glucose for 60 min, and 
the medium was collected again. Insulin levels in the medium were measured in 12 replicate

 wells per group by ELISA. Values were normalized to cell number in each well. For mTOR 
inhibition, the cells were treated with 250 nM Torin1 (Tocris) starting 3 d after infection and 
maintained in Torinl for the duration of the experiment. For PPAR-γ inhibition, cells were 
treated with 50 μM GW9662 (Sigma) twice a week for the duration of the experiment.
Statistical analyses
Two-sided Student’s t-tests were used to compare mouse groups, under the assumption of 
normal distribution and observance of similar variance. No statistical method was used to 
predetermine sample size. No animals were excluded from analysis. The experiments were 
not randomized. There was no blinded allocation during the experiments and the outcome 
assessment.
