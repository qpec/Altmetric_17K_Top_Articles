Abstract
Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can interfere with daily function and quality of life, and
there are no known preventive approaches. In a cohort of breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel as part of a clinical trial
(SWOG 0221), we examined the use of dietary supplements both before diagnosis and during treatment in relation to CIPN.
Methods: At registration to S0221, 1225 breast cancer patients completed questionnaires regarding the use of multivitamins
and supplements before and at diagnosis. A second questionnaire at six months queried use during treatment. Supplement
use was evaluated in relation to CIPN, assessed via the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE v. 3.0) and the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group
Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) subscale. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed with logistic
regression for the CTCAE analyses and ordinal regression for the FACT/GOG-Ntx analyses.
Results: Multivitamin use before diagnosis was associated with reduced symptoms of CIPN (CTCAE-adjusted OR ¼ 0.60, 95%
CI ¼ 0.42 to 0.87; FACT/GOG-Ntx-adjusted OR ¼ 0.78, 95% CI ¼ 0.61 to 1.00). Use during treatment was marginally inversely as-
sociated with CIPN (CTCAE-adjusted OR ¼ 0.73, 95% CI ¼ 0.49 to 1.08; FACT/GOG-Ntx-adjusted OR ¼ 0.77, 95% CI ¼ 0.60 to 0.99).
Other supplement use, either before diagnosis or during treatment, was not statistically significantly associated with CIPN.
Conclusions: Multivitamin use may be associated with reduced risk of CIPN, although individual dietary supplement use did
not appreciably affect risk. Multivitamin use could be a surrogate for other related behaviors that are the actual drivers of the
association with reduced CIPN. Without prospective randomized trials of vitamin supplementation, recommendations for
use or changes to clinical practice are clearly not warranted.

 Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a fre-
quent consequence of treatment with paclitaxel. Symptoms of
CIPN reduce quality of life and are potentially long lasting.
Additionally, CIPN may lead to dose reduction or discontinua-
tion of chemotherapy (1,2), potentially affecting treatment effi-
cacy and future risk of recurrence.
Few data are available to predict which patients will develop
CIPN or if there are effective approaches to prevention. Dose per
cycle, cumulative dose, and treatment frequency have all been
shown to be positively associated with CIPN (3–6), as was smok-
ing in one study (7). Studies of genetic polymorphisms and CIPN
have not been conclusive (8–14). Small trials showed that sup-
plementation with omega-3 fatty acids (15) and vitamin E
(16,17) reduced risk of CIPN. In a randomized trial with breast
cancer patients, acetyl-L-carnitine was associated with in-
creased risk (18).
After receiving a cancer diagnosis, patients may be moti-
vated to make lifestyle changes that they believe will improve
their health, reduce their risk of recurrence, and reduce the side
effects of treatment (19–22). Often, dietary supplements are
used to complement traditional cancer therapies, with reports
of patients’ use of dietary supplements postdiagnosis ranging
from 67% to 87% (23). In the Pathways study, a prospective co-
hort of breast cancer survivors, 60% of women began using a di-
etary supplement following diagnosis (24). Given the high
prevalence of supplement use by survivors, understanding the
effect that supplements may have on treatment outcomes, in-
cluding CIPN, is important. To investigate if supplement use
prior to and during chemotherapy for breast cancer was associ-
ated with the experience of CIPN, we used data from the Diet,
Exercise, Lifestyle, and Cancer Prognosis (DELCaP) study. The
DELCaP study, embedded in a large cooperative group therapeu-
tic trial of dosing regimens for treatment of high-risk breast
cancer, was designed to examine lifestyle factors, particularly
the use of vitamin supplements before diagnosis and during
chemotherapy, in relation to treatment outcomes.
Methods
Study Population
DELCaP was a questionnaire-based study ancillary to a breast
cancer
intergroup
phase
III
clinical
trial
(SWOG
0221;
NCT00070564) that compared dosing schedules of doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (25). Figure 1 shows the de-
sign of S0221, with numbers limited to only those who partici-
pated in DELCaP.
We embedded a description of the DELCaP study and per-
mission to contact patients into the therapeutic consent for
S0221, and all participants provided written informed consent.
A form with patient contact information was faxed to our staff
when patients were registered to the trial, which enabled us to
provide them with questionnaires for completion prior to initia-
tion of chemotherapy (26). Before sending questionnaires, study
staff telephoned patients to describe the DELCaP study. If ques-
tionnaires were not returned in a timely manner, staff tele-
phoned as a reminder and sent out replacement questionnaires,
or answered questions if needed. Patients who returned incom-
plete questionnaires were also contacted to provide that infor-
mation over the telephone, thus ensuring complete data for all
questions from the majority of patients. S0221 accrual began in
October 2003, with approval to conduct the DELCaP study in June
2005; thus, data on supplement use were available from patients
who were enrolled during or after 2005 (n ¼ 2014). Among these
patients, 1726 consented to participation in DELCaP (85.7%), and
Figure 1. Study design schematic limited to participants with questionnaire data (n ¼ 1340). Doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide was received according to one of the
following schedules: every two weeks for six cycles, every two weeks for four cycles, or weekly for 15 cycles. Paclitaxel was received every two weeks for six cycles or
weekly for 12 cycles. A ¼ doxorubicin; C ¼ cyclophosphamide; T ¼ paclitaxel.

 1482 of these patients (85.8%) completed and returned the first
questionnaire. The baseline questionnaire collected data on sup-
plement use and other lifestyle factors prior to and at diagnosis,
before treatment was initiated. Approximately six months after
study registration, when taxane treatment was scheduled to be
completed, a second questionnaire was sent to participants, que-
rying about lifestyle and supplement use during cancer treat-
ment. As with the first questionnaire, patients who did not
return the questionnaire or who submitted incomplete informa-
tion were contacted to provide assistance in completing the
questionnaire. Of the 1225 DeLCaP participants who completed
the first questionnaire assessing supplement use prior to and at
diagnosis and who were randomly assigned to one of the treat-
ment arms and received paclitaxel, 1068 completed the second
questionnaire (87.2%) assessing use during chemotherapy. The
157 patients who did not return the second questionnaire had
lower education and were younger, less likely to be non-Hispanic
white, and more likely to have smoked compared with those
who completed the second questionnaire (data not shown). This
study was approved by the institutional review boards at Roswell
Park Cancer Institute and at all participating institutions that
enrolled patients to S0221.
Toxicities Evaluated
In S0221, CIPN events were monitored and reported with the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 3.0 (27). Grade 3 neuropathies include
sensory loss or paresthesia interfering with activities of daily
living. Grade 4 indicates disabling sensory loss that interferes
with function. Study sites participating in S0221 were required
to report grade 3 or higher neuropathy due to treatment.
Therefore, we classified CIPN as a dichotomous variable (grades
3–4 vs grades 0–2).
For additional measures of patient-reported neuropathy rep-
resenting a broader range than CTCAE grades 3 and 4, the sec-
ond DELCaP questionnaire administered after chemotherapy
also included the FACT-Taxane. In the 11-item FACT/GOG-
Neurotoxicity subscale (FACT/GOG-Ntx), symptoms including
numbness and discomfort in hands and feet, joint and muscle
pain, and trouble feeling and walking are assessed via a five-
point scale. Scores are categorized into tertiles, where tertile 1
indicates no or few symptoms, tertile 2 indicates moderate neu-
ropathy, and tertile 3 indicates more severe neuropathy. This
symptom questionnaire aspect of the DELCaP study was not ini-
tiated until after the study began; thus, 922 patients completed
the FACT/GOG-Ntx.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics for participants with CTCAE grade 0 to 2
and grade 3 or 4 neuropathy, and by tertile of FACT/GOG-Ntx,
were compared using chi-square tests. Odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using uncondi-
tional logistic regression for associations between each dietary
supplement and CTCAE neuropathy, with ordinal regression for
higher compared with lower neuropathy assessed via FACT/
GOG-Ntx. Patients were classified as supplement users if they
took a particular supplement at least once a week.
We used separate models to examine supplement use before
diagnosis and during treatment in relation to neuropathy. We
then considered use before and during treatment jointly.
Because of low use of many individual supplements included in
the questionnaires, we present data only on those with at least
10% use at any time point. Self-reported height and usual
weight before diagnosis were used to compute body mass index
(BMI) in kg/m2. Odds ratios were a priori–adjusted for age at
completion of first questionnaire, BMI, race/ethnicity, smoking
status, alcohol use, physical activity, and treatment arm. We
considered menopausal status, education, and consumption of
fruits and vegetables, as well as total cumulative dose and treat-
ment modification, as covariates, but inclusion did not appre-
ciably affect risk estimates, so they were excluded from final
adjusted models. Model fit for logistic regression was assessed
via Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, and the proportional odds as-
sumption for ordinal models was assessed graphically. There
was no evidence of poor fit (all P > .05). All statistical tests were
two-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
The characteristics of DELCaP participants by CTCAE toxicity
grade and by tertile of FACT/GOG-Ntx scores are shown in Table
1. Grade 3 and 4 CTCAE neuropathy, observed in 12.4% of pa-
tients, was more common among African Americans and
among patients randomly assigned to treatment arms with a bi-
weekly paclitaxel dose of 175 mg/m2 (arms 1, 2, and 5) for six cy-
cles than those in arms 3, 4, and 6 (25). Using FACT/GOG-Ntx
scores, neuropathy was more common in patients who were
older, nonwhite, overweight and obese, former or current smok-
ers, and those with less education than a college degree; 65.5%
of patients with CTCAE-assessed grade 3 or 4 were in the high-
est tertile of FACT/GOG-Ntx neuropathy, compared with 30.3%
of patients with CTCAE-assessed grade 0 to 2 toxicities.
Individual components of the FACT/GOG-Ntx subscale are
displayed in Figure 2. “Quite a bit” and “very much” were
grouped together to represent severe neuropathy, “somewhat”
was considered moderate, and “a little bit” was considered
mild. Foot numbness was the most common symptom, with
81.9% of patients experiencing at least mild foot numbness and
52.3% reporting severe foot numbness (Figure 2). Hand numb-
ness was also very high, with 79.1% reporting at least mild hand
numbness; 74.5% reported foot discomfort, and 66.7% reported
hand discomfort.
As shown in Table 2, patients who used multivitamins be-
fore diagnosis were 39.7% less likely to experience CTCAE grade
3 or 4 neuropathy than nonusers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ¼
0.60, 95% CI ¼ 0.42 to 0.87) and, according to FACT/GOG-Ntx,
were 21.9% less likely to report more neuropathy than nonusers
(aOR ¼ 0.78, 95% CI ¼ 0.61 to 1.00). Use of vitamin C, folic acid,
calcium, iron, and fish oil before diagnosis was not associated
with CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity. There were no statisti-
cally significant associations between use of any individual sup-
plements prior to diagnosis and CIPN assessed by CTCAE or by
FACT/GOG-Ntx.
Table 3 shows associations between neurotoxicity and use
of supplements during chemotherapy. Odds of CTCAE grade 3
or 4 neuropathy were lower for patients who reported use of
multivitamins during treatment compared with nonusers (aOR
¼ 0.73, 95% CI ¼ 0.49 to 1.08), as well as for users of fish oil, EPA,
omega-3, flaxseed, or cod liver oil (aOR ¼ 0.54, 95% CI ¼ 0.28 to
1.06), although associations were not statistically significant.
None of the other supplements was statistically significantly as-
sociated with likelihood of grade 3 or 4 neuropathy. Although

 not statistically significant, the use of iron during treatment ap-
peared to be associated with increased odds of grade 3 or 4 neu-
ropathy (aOR ¼ 1.67, 95% CI ¼ 0.92 to 3.03). Multivitamin use
during treatment was also associated with lower odds of neu-
ropathy according FACT/GOG-Ntx (aOR ¼ 0.77, 95% CI ¼ 0.60 to
0.99), and use of vitamins B6 and B12 with higher odds, although
associations were not statistically significant.

Discussion
In this study of breast cancer patients enrolled in a large coop-
erative group clinical trial comparing dosing regimens of doxo-
rubicin,
cyclophosphamide,
and
paclitaxel,
we
observed
associations between multivitamin use both before and during
treatment and lower odds of neuropathy assessed by CTCAE
and FACT/GOG-Ntx. Associations were strongest in patients
using multivitamins both before diagnosis and during chemo-
therapy. There was a statistically nonsignificant association
between iron use during treatment and increased neuropathy.
Use of iron may have been initiated during chemotherapy to
relieve treatment-induced anemia. We did not observe any
statistically
significant
associations
with
use
of
other
supplements.
To our knowledge, this is the first study embedded in a ther-
apeutic trial to evaluate the association between dietary supple-
ment use and taxane-induced CIPN. There are several possible
explanations to account for the fact that we observed statisti-
cally significant associations with multivitamin use but no as-
sociations with individual supplements. First, multivitamin use
was much higher than use of individual supplements, providing
more statistical power to detect a statistically significant associ-
ation. Therefore, while the association with multivitamin use
could be driven by one or more individual components of multi-
vitamins, we would have been less likely to observe a statisti-
cally
significant
association
with
use
of
single
vitamins.
Although few studies have evaluated the relationships between
individual supplements and CIPN, some data exist to support
this explanation. For example, small trials of omega-3 fatty acid
supplementation (15) and of vitamin E (28) found associations
with reduced CIPN symptoms, although no association with vi-
tamin E was observed in a larger placebo-controlled, multicen-
ter phase III trial (29). Conversely, however, a well-designed
randomized clinical trial of acetyl-L-carnitine was unexpectedly
associated with increased CIPN (18), and a recent observational
follow-up study of a cohort of breast cancer survivors found
that initiation of antioxidant supplements during treatment
was associated with increased odds of CIPN (24). However, it is
unknown if this association reflects a causal relationship or if
patients began use of antioxidant supplements in an effort to
reduce symptoms. Disparate results across studies and trials
highlight the complexity of relationships between neuropathy
and individual supplements, possibly indicating that one sup-
plement alone may not be efficacious in treating symptoms of
neuropathy. Such synergy could account for our findings; two
or more individual multivitamin components, effective only in
combination, could be driving the statistically significant asso-
ciation with multivitamin use. We were unable to evaluate this
possibility, however, because of the small numbers of partici-
pants who reported individual supplement use. To our knowl-
edge, only one study, of diabetic neuropathy, has evaluated the
effect of multiple supplement use. In that placebo-controlled
randomized trial, participants received either zinc, magnesium,
and vitamins C and E or these supplements plus vitamins B1,
B2, and B6, biotin, and folic acid (30). Compared with a placebo-
only group, the two supplement groups experienced reduced
symptoms of neuropathy, supporting the hypothesis that sup-
plements may have synergistic effects.
Confounding due to lifestyle factors is another possible ex-
planation for our findings. Participants taking multivitamins
may have also engaged in other behaviors that may reduce the
odds of developing CIPN. There are limited epidemiologic data
regarding risk factors for CIPN, but we adjusted for the potential
confounding effects of age, BMI, race, smoking status, physical
activity, alcohol intake, and treatment arm in multivariable
models. A recent study of cancer patients receiving taxane
treatment noted that diabetes was associated with a twofold in-
crease in odds of CIPN (31). It is possible that multivitamin users
may have been more health conscious, with a lower prevalence
of diabetes. While we did not have information regarding diabe-
tes, we did control for BMI, which may have reduced some of

 A limitation of this study is that it relies on the use of self-
report to assess supplement use, which could introduce mea-
surement error. Use of dietary supplements was queried with
self-administered questionnaires, and thus we do not have ob-
jective data, such as blood markers, with which to conduct sen-
sitivity
analyses
or
statistically
correct
for
potential
measurement error. However, patients who participated were
highly motivated and were asked to collect their vitamins for re-
cording ingredients and dosages, particularly those taken dur-
ing chemotherapy. Thus, we have some degree of confidence
that self-reports of usage in this study are fairly accurate.
Furthermore, we did not collect data regarding the actual form
of certain supplements, such as vitamin E, that participants reg-
ularly consumed. This could mask the effect of a more active
form of a supplement, should one truly exist. Another limitation
is that, while supplement use questions referred to use during
treatment, we are unable to determine if patients began supple-
ment use before paclitaxel administration or after. It is possible
that some participants initiated supplement use after symp-
toms arose in an attempt to alleviate those symptoms. This
would attenuate a true positive association and strengthen a
true inverse association. Additionally, for some supplements,
use was very low, increasing the possibility of false negatives.
Another potential limitation is the assessment of CIPN via
CTCAE, which could be prone to poor interobserver agreement
(32) and underestimation of CIPN (33). Nevertheless, because
neuropathy is physician-assessed, any misclassification is un-
likely to vary by supplement use and would bias results toward
the null. Because sites were not required to report grade 1 or 2
neuropathies, we were unable to examine the association be-
tween supplement use and mild or intermediate neuropathies
with the CTCAE, but use of the self-reported FACT/GOG-Ntx al-
lowed us to capture a broader range of neuropathies. We noted
similarities in associations between neuropathies and supple-
ments using both measures. Multivitamin use before diagnosis
and use during treatment were each associated with decreased
CIPN, regardless of which measure was used.
We were also unable to assess nutritional status of patients
at baseline. It is possible that multivitamin nonusers could have
been deficient in some nutrients compared with users; in that
case, multivitamin use could be a proxy for vitamin sufficiency
and could account for the observed association. Finally, as in
Table 2. Supplement use before diagnosis and odds of CTCAE grade 3 and 4 neuropathy (n ¼ 1225) and neuropathy score as determined by the

 any observational study, our findings could be due to chance,
particularly due to the fact that associations with multiple fac-
tors were tested. Only a randomized clinical trial of vitamin
supplements could assess the direct effects of supplement use
on cancer treatment outcomes.
A notable strength of this study, compared with epidemio-
logical population studies of cancer patients, is that it was con-
ducted in the context of a clinical trial, wherein patients with
similar tumor characteristics were treated with the same
agents, with entry into the DELCaP study at the time of registra-
tion to the trial. This enabled us to collect and record use prior
to and at the time of diagnosis before patients began treatment,
reducing the likelihood of recall bias if behaviors changed with
chemotherapy. Furthermore, neurotoxicities were reported by
each site prospectively according to CTCAE criteria, again stan-
dardizing measurement of this phenotype. However, because of
the nature of cooperative group clinical trials, we were unable
to obtain detailed information regarding dose modifications
that individual patients may have received because of taxane-
related side effects. Clinical sites were only required to report
information critical to the major objectives of the parent trial,
and thus only the most severe grade of toxicity and occurrence
of dose reduction were captured. Because we do not know the
reason for any potential dose modification or the amount by
which doses may have been reduced, it is not possible to link
modifications to the timing or existence of CIPN. However,
when we included cumulative paclitaxel dose and treatment
modification in multivariable models of supplement use and
neurotoxicity, risk estimates were not appreciably changed.
Prospective studies incorporating detailed information on tim-
ing of dose modifications as well as supplement use are war-
ranted to understand the potential relationships
between
supplement use and the experience of CIPN.
Future studies are needed to replicate this finding as well as
to better understand which components of multivitamins could
be primarily responsible for the observed reduction in risk of
CIPN, or if the associations are affected by potential confound-
ing. Importantly, the potential associations between use of sup-
plements and observed treatment side effects need to be
balanced

 particularly during chemotherapy, may have on recurrence and
survival in breast cancer patients. With longer follow-up and
additional events in S0221, it will be of interest to examine these
associations. If results indicate that there are no adverse effects
of dietary supplements on cancer outcomes, randomized trials
could be justified to determine if specific supplements can be
used to reduce treatment-related side effects. Without these
types of rigorous prospective studies, changes to clinical prac-
tice or recommendations for use of vitamin supplements are
clearly not warranted.
