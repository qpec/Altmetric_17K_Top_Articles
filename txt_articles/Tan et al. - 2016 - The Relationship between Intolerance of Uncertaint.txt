Abstract
Purpose—Anxiety may serve as a major barrier to participation in AS. Intolerance of uncertainty
—the tendency to perceive the potential for negative events as threatening—has been linked to 
cancer-related worry. Accordingly, we explored prospectively the relationship of intolerance of 
uncertainty with anxiety along with other clinical factors among men managed with AS for 
prostate cancer.
Materials and Methods—From 2011–2014, 119 men with D’Amico low-risk prostate cancer 
participating in active surveillance completed the HADS, MAX-PC, IUS, and IPSS surveys. We 
evaluated the relationship between anxiety and IUS score after adjusting for patient characteristics, 
cancer information, and IPSS score using bivariable and multivariable analyses.
Results—A number of men reported clinically significant anxiety on the generalized (n=18, 
15.1%) and prostate-cancer-specific (n=17, 14.3%) scales. In bivariable analyses, men with 
moderate/severe urinary symptoms and higher IUS scores reported more generalized and prostate-
cancer-specific anxiety than men with mild urinary symptoms and lower IUS scores, respectively 
(p≤0.008). Men with depressive symptoms (p=0.024) or family history of prostate cancer 
(p=0.006) experienced greater generalized anxiety. In multivariable analysis, IUS score was

 significantly associated with generalized (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09–1.38) and prostate-cancerspecific 
anxiety (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13–1.49) while moderate/severe urinary symptoms were associated 
with prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (OR 6.89, 95% CI 1.33–35.68).
Conclusions—Intolerance of uncertainty and urinary symptoms may promote anxiety among 
men on AS for prostate cancer. Patient education, management of lower urinary tract symptoms, 
and behavioral interventions may lessen anxiety related to uncertainty intolerance and help 
maintain patient engagement in AS.

Introduction
Most men with prostate cancer are currently diagnosed with localized, low-risk disease 
unlikely to be lethal.1, 2 Nevertheless, 70–80% of these men undergo surgery or radiation, 
which carry potential short-term and longstanding side effects.3, 4 As an alternative, AS 
offers acceptable cancer-specific survival and minimal morbidity.5, 6 Accordingly, AS is now 
considered a valid management strategy with usage reaching as many as half of men with 
lowrisk prostate cancer in certain regions of the United States.4, 7, 8
Despite its potential benefits, AS has been underutilized for men with localized prostate 
cancer.4 One often-mentioned reason is the toll of cancer-related anxiety on expectantly 
managed patients.9 Because the underlying threat from prostate cancer among surveillance 
patients is small but ever-present,5 the severity of distress may vary with perceptions of 
health and overall psychological adjustment.10 Intolerance of uncertainty—a predisposing 
trait for anxiety marked by the tendency to perceive uncertainty as threatening11—
perpetuates anxiety symptoms in patients with a variety of health conditions including 
prostate cancer.12, 13 Men on AS may be particularly vulnerable given the monitoring-based 
approach to care. Interval PSA testing and prostate biopsies integral to AS could exacerbate 
perceptions of threat and therefore worry. Physical symptoms and other patient attributes 
may also interact with uncertainty intolerance.14 However, to date, the impact of intolerance 
of uncertainty among men undergoing AS of prostate cancer is unexplored.
In this context, we hypothesized that men on AS for prostate cancer with greater intolerance 
of uncertainty would be more likely to experience anxiety and examined this using a 
prospective cohort study. In understanding this cognitive underpinning, we may facilitate the 
development of strategies that reduce the psychological burden of expectant management 
approaches for men with prostate cancer.
Material and Methods
Patient Cohort
From February 2011–June 2014, we enrolled 267 men into the University of California, Los 
Angeles AS program, an institutional review board-approved longitudinal registry with entry 
restricted to men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer based on the D ׳Amico risk

 classification.15 As part of this prospective cohort study, 257 (96.3%) men completed 
questionnaires related to anxiety, depression, quality of life, and urinary symptoms upon 
entry. Because the impact of prostate cancer on patient-reported mental health tends to 
lessen over time,16 we reduced the study population to men enrolled within a year of initial 
diagnosis (N=144). Finally, to limit heterogeneity, we focused specifically on men with low-
risk disease (i.e, ≤clinical T2, Gleason 6, PSA 10 ng/ml), resulting in a final cohort of 119 
men.
As part of the study protocol, participants underwent a confirmatory MRI-fusion guided 
biopsy, PSA/physical exam every 6 months, and repeat biopsy within 1 year then annually or 
biannually thereafter. Participants completed surveys upon study entry and during 
subsequent follow-ups, either in clinic or via a web-based electronic platform. Initially, 
participants completed questionnaires in 6-month intervals. To reduce patient burden, the 
protocol was amended to lengthen the interval to every 12 months midway through the 
study. At the time of this analysis, 69 of the 119 entrants (58.0%) completed two or more 
surveys, yielding a subcohort of men with short-term follow-up data.
Primary outcomes
Two validated, patient-reported instruments were used to assess anxiety: 1) the HADS 
anxiety subscale for generalized anxiety; and 2) the MAX-PC for prostate-cancer-specific 
anxiety. For each scale, we used established cutoffs (i.e., ≥8 for HADS and ≥26 for MAX-
PC) to create binary measures of anxiety.17, 18
Intolerance of uncertainty and additional covariates
To measure intolerance of uncertainty, we used a modified version of the IUS. We pared the 
original 27-item instrument to 8 items based on the highest item-total correlations from the 
initial validation study.19 Additionally, we collected information pertaining to patient 
demographics, comorbidities, family history, clinic visits, and indicators of cancer severity 
by patient-report and through medical chart review. We assessed depressive symptoms with 
the depression subscale of the HADS instrument and urinary symptoms with the IPSS.
Statistical Analysis
First, we examined the relationships at study entry between generalized and prostate-cancer-
specific anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty as well as relevant demographic and clinical 
variables using Student’s t-test or chi-squared test as appropriate. Next, we performed 
multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between intolerance of uncertainty 
scores and anxiety at study entry, adjusting for patient age, race, marital status, education, 
comorbidities, urinary symptom score, family history of prostate cancer, and depressive 
symptoms. From this, we calculated the model-adjusted probability of anxiety at the mean 
intolerance of uncertainty level and half standard deviations above and below, which 
represent clinically significant changes in score.20 We also compared the adjusted 
probability of anxiety according to mild versus moderate/severe urinary symptoms using an 
IPSS cutoff of 7.

 As an exploratory analysis, we examined the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty 
and anxiety over the early surveillance period. First, we compared baseline characteristics 
between men yet to return for follow-up versus those completing at least 2 surveys using 
Student’s t-test or chi-squared test as appropriate. Next, for the sub-cohort with follow-up, 
we stratified survey responses into four time-based categories (i.e., baseline, <9 months, 9–
15 months, and >15 months) and examined the relationship over time using chi-squared tests 
and ANOVA. Finally, we constructed repeated-measures, multivariable logistic regression 
models using all available data from study entry to last follow-up. We refitted our 
multivariable models and included time since study entry as an additional covariate, and then 
again determined the model-adjusted probability of anxiety, both generalized and prostate-
cancer-specific. As sensitivity analyses, we also examined models that included men with 
intermediate-risk disease with further adjustment for PSA and Gleason score and 
incorporated selected interaction terms between IUS score and other clinical variables.
All statistical testing was 2-sided, completed using computerized software (SAS version 9.4; 
Cary, NC), and carried out at the 5% significance level. The registry and this study were 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Results
Baseline analysis
Among 119 men, 18 (15.1%) and 17 (14.3%) reported generalized and/or prostate-cancer-
specific anxiety, respectively. Table 1 presents several factors that were associated 
significantly with anxiety. Intolerance of uncertainty related directly to generalized and 
prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (p≤0.001). Additionally, men with elevated depressive 
symptoms (p=0.024), moderate/severe urinary symptoms (p=0.008), or a family history of 
prostate cancer (p=0.006) were more likely to have generalized anxiety, whereas men with 
moderate/severe urinary symptoms were more like to have anxiety related to prostate cancer 
(p=0.003). We did not observe an association between PSA and generalized anxiety 
(p=0.438), prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (p=0.760), or PSA-specific anxiety as measured 
by the PSA subscale of the MAX-PC instrument (p=0.916). We found no difference in the 
number of previous biopsies (p=0.251) or the performance of biopsy at the time of survey 
administration (p=0.433) between patients with and without anxiety. As of June 2014, 5 
(5.0%) men without generalized anxiety and 1 (5.6%) with generalized anxiety opted to 
withdraw from AS without evidence of disease progression (p=0.918). Seven men proceeded 
to treatment due to disease progression.
In the multivariable analyses (supplemental Table 1), intolerance of uncertainty remained 
significantly associated with generalized anxiety (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09–1.38) and prostate-
cancer- specific anxiety (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13–1.49). Though not significantly associated 
with generalized anxiety (OR 2.88, 95% CI 0.76–10.99), moderate/severe urinary symptoms 
were more common among men with prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (OR 6.89, 95% CI 
1.33–35.68). Men with a family history of prostate cancer also had an increased likelihood 
of generalized anxiety (OR 4.26, 95% 1.11–16.42). Figure 1 illustrates the change in 
probability of generalized and prostate-cancer-specific anxiety in response to meaningful

 changes in intolerance of uncertainty and for men with moderate/severe versus mild urinary 
symptoms.
Longitudinal Analysis
Sixty-nine men completed 2 or more surveys with a median follow-up of 12 months 
(interquartile range 7–18 months). Patient demographics, cancer-specific covariates, and the 
proportion with anxiety did not differ significantly between the 69 patients with follow-up 
data and the 50 with only baseline data (p>0.05). Patient-reported outcomes did not vary 
significantly with time (Table 2).
Over the initial surveillance period, greater intolerance of uncertainty (OR 1.15, 95% CI 
1.07–1.23) and moderate/severe urinary symptoms (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.13–10.50) were 
associated with greater odds of generalized anxiety compared to lower intolerance of 
uncertainty and mild urinary symptoms, respectively, in the repeated-measures, 
multivariable regression models (supplemental Table 1). We noted similar findings with 
respect to prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (intolerance of uncertainty: OR 1.28, 95% CI 
1.17–1.40; moderate/severe urinary symptoms: OR 6.18, 95% CI 2.36–16.20). Predicted 
probabilities are depicted in Figure 2. Months in surveillance did not predict generalized 
(OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89–1.01) or prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–
1.01). Otherwise, only non-white race/ethnicity was associated with prostate-cancer-specific 
anxiety (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.05–13.82). Study findings remained consistent across the 
specified sensitivity analyses (supplement Table 2).
Discussion
Given the indolent nature of low-risk prostate cancer and the probability of death from other 
causes, AS has been endorsed as a management strategy by several organizations including 
the American Urological Association.2, 7 While utilization trends indicate increasing use of 
AS,4, 8 many men continue to opt for surgery or radiation despite the small margin for 
benefit.2 Among a host of considerations, mental and emotional health have been found to 
vary with treatment and likely factor into a man’s treatment decision.16
Within this health domain, anxiety and management of uncertainty arise as potential barriers 
to the adoption of and adherence to AS by patients and providers.9, 21 Consistent with 
previous studies,22 approximately 1 in 5 men engaged in our surveillance protocol reported 
clinically significant anxiety. Additionally, the proportion of men experiencing anxiety did 
not decline, at least over the short-term. Though not assessed here, registry data have 
suggested similar or higher levels of anxiety among men treated with AS compared with 
men treated with radical prostatectomy.16, 23 In total, these findings confirm that pervasive 
worry and psychological distress occur with some regularity within the expectantly managed 
population.
Anxiety during AS appears to be linked to both psychological and clinical factors that may 
be modifiable. For men with prostate cancer, uncertainty concerns appear crucial and often 
stem from questions about risk of mortality, disease progression and migration, treatment 
outcomes, and/or treatment-related side effects.21 Although uncertainty itself can be

 distressing, a patient’s attitude toward uncertainty may be particularly important. The 
tendency to consider uncertainty threatening, unacceptable, or unmanageable may be a 
principal precursor to pervasive worry and anxiety. As explored in this study, the probability 
of anxiety increased substantially with meaningful increases in intolerance of uncertainty. 
Similar findings have been reported for patients with lung cancer as well as men treated for 
prostate cancer.13, 24
In addition to intolerance of uncertainty, urinary symptoms also had a significant 
relationship with anxiety. Interestingly, the interpretation of bodily cues has been linked to 
patient-reported psychological stress throughout the spectrum of prostate cancer care. 
Urinary symptoms, in particular, have been associated with heightened levels of cancer fear 
and mood disturbances in men treated with radical prostatectomy.25 Previous research also 
suggests that uncertainty intolerance perpetuates misinterpretation of bodily sensations 
during an anxiety or panic episode among patients with anxiety disorders.14 Consistent with 
the Common-Sense Model of Illness Representations,26 somatic signals—especially when 
arising from the urinary system—might facilitate catastrophic thinking and cycles of worry 
in men with high intolerance of uncertainty. Taken together, intolerance of uncertainty, 
urinary symptoms, and their interplay may serve as a potent catalyst for anxiety among men 
pursuing AS.
Our findings should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, because this 
prospective cohort study focuses on AS participants, we are unable to ascertain whether a 
relationship also exists between intolerance of uncertainty and the initial treatment decision. 
Similarly, we cannot assess whether the influence of uncertainty intolerance on anxiety 
varies with the selected management modality. Future empirical work is needed to 
understand the role of intolerance of uncertainty on decision-making and management-
specific anxiety, particularly for men selecting definitive treatment despite being suitable 
candidates for AS. Second, our study may miss subtle changes in anxiety associated with 
surveillance-related testing. It is worth noting, however, that patient-reported anxiety did not 
differ according to receipt of biopsy or PSA level. Third, because of the limited cohort size 
and follow-up, we are unable to assess whether intolerance of uncertainty and urinary 
symptoms affect anxiety and discontinuation of AS over the long-term and if this changes 
substantively over time. As part of this cohort study, a planned future analysis with more 
mature longitudinal data may clarify the time-varying interplay among determinants of 
anxiety, biochemical and/or pathologic changes, and surveillance attrition, providing 
additional information that may aid patient selection and inter-surveillance management. 
Similarly, additional determinants of anxiety may become identifiable as the study 
population grows. Fourth, given our study design, we are unable to demonstrate causality, 
especially as it relates to the observed relationship between urinary symptoms and anxiety. 
Of note, treatment of intolerance of uncertainty reduces anxiety symptoms, supporting the 
concept of intolerance of uncertainty as a cause of anxiety.27 Finally, as our study describes 
findings from a single institution, they may not be broadly generalizable. For example, 
illness-related uncertainty, which was not measured in the present study, has been shown to 
differ based on patient race/ethnicity and education level. Intolerance of uncertainty and its 
relationship with anxiety may also vary across practice settings depending on the patient-
mix.28

 These limitations notwithstanding, our findings have potential implications for professionals 
caring for men with prostate cancer on AS given the modifiable nature of intolerance of 
uncertainty and urinary symptoms. In the case of the former, cognitive-behavioral therapy 
that helps patients manage or accept uncertainty has been shown to reduce anxiety in a 
randomized control trial.27 Previous qualitative work also suggests that men on AS employ 
several coping mechanisms to deal with uncertainty such as framing prostate cancer as a 
benign process or augmenting surveillance with adjuncts (e.g., dietary modification, 
exercise).21 While future research will be pivotal, cognitive and self-management 
interventions tailored toward these coping mechanisms, along with effective patient 
education, may help reduce uncertainty-related distress.29 Multidisciplinary prostate cancer 
survivorship programs that include social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists may be 
well positioned to offer such services to at-risk men.
Urologic management of urinary symptoms may further help lower anxiety for men on AS. 
Some data suggest that reducing lower urinary tract symptoms—either medically or 
surgically—may lessen anxiety among men with benign prostatic hypertrophy.30 Though 
additional studies are needed, treatment of urinary symptoms may provide similar relief to 
men on AS with the added potential benefit of removing body cues that trigger and amplify 
intolerance of uncertainty. In identifying and addressing these determinants, anxiety may be 
minimized during AS, making this management approach more acceptable to men with low-
risk prostate cancer.
Conclusions
Intolerance of uncertainty may function as a potent determinant of anxiety among men 
pursuing AS for low-risk prostate cancer. Lower urinary tract symptoms also are associated 
with patient-reported anxiety. Risk assessment, patient education, management of lower 
urinary tract symptoms, and behavioral interventions to increase uncertainty tolerance may 
lessen anxiety and help maintain patient engagement in AS.

 Figure 1. 
Probability of generalized and prostate-cancer-specific anxiety at baseline according to 
intolerance of uncertainty score and urinary symptoms. Probabilities and p-values are 
derived from the multivariable regression models and reported for the mean IUS score ± a 
half-standard deviation and urinary symptoms dichotomized into mild versus moderate/
severe symptoms based on the IPSS.
