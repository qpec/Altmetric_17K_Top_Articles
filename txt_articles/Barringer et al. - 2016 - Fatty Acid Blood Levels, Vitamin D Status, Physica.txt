ABSTRACT
This study examined whether blood fatty acid levels, vitamin D status, and/or physical activity are
associated with physical fitness scores; a measure of mood, Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and a measure of resiliency,
Dispositional Resiliency Scale-15 in active duty Soldiers. 100 active duty males at Fort Hood, Texas, underwent a battery
of psychometric tests, anthropometric measurements, and fitness tests, and they also provided fasting blood samples for
fatty acid and vitamin D analysis. Pearson bivariate correlation analysis revealed significant correlations among psycho-
metric tests, anthropometric measurements, physical performance, reported physical inactivity (sitting time), and fatty acid
and vitamin D blood levels. On the basis of these findings, a regression equation was developed to predict a depressed
mood status as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The equation accurately predicted depressed mood
status in 80% of our participants with a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 80.5%. Results indicate that the use of a
regression equation may be helpful in identifying Soldiers at higher risk for mental health issues. Future studies should
evaluate the impact of exercise and diet as a means of improving resiliency and reducing depressed mood in Soldiers.
INTRODUCTION
The mental health of our service members is a serious con-
cern. Rates of depression and suicide have increased in ser-
vice members with more deaths attributed to suicide than
deaths due to combat in Afghanistan in 2012.1 One of the
key strategies in preventing self-harm is early intervention,
but as Bryan et al2 reported this usually occurs only after the
individual is highly distressed and possibly already suicidal.
Therefore identifying nonpsychological makers associated
with depressed mood might allow for both the creation of a
more effective screening tool and potential novel approaches
of prevention. The purpose of this study was to determine if
blood fatty acid values, vitamin D levels, physical activity,
physical fitness scores, and Dispositional Resiliency Scale-15
(DRS-15) scores can be used a predictor of depressed mood
based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in
active duty Soldiers.
Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D are of particular inter-
est in the military population as a study by Lewis et al3
demonstrated that active duty military members with the
lowest docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were 62% more
likely to have committed suicide. Umhau et al4 showed that
30% of the 990 samples taken from active duty Soldiers
between 2002 and 2008 were vitamin D deficient. Increased
physical fitness has also been shown to reduce Soldiers’ risk
for depression.5 A U.S. Department of Defense survey by
Kress et al6 of 10,040 service members found obesity, as
classified according to body mass index (BMI), increased
the odds of depressive symptoms compared to normal weight
service members. Higher DRS-15 scores have been associ-
ated with higher success in Special Forces Assessment and
Selection, an extremely arduous military selection program
with a high attrition rate.7 Higher DRS-15 scores also have
been associated with lower post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) scores. Escolas et al8 surveyed 561 service members
who had been deployed for at least 30 days and found
DRS-15 scores were negatively associated (r = −0.39;
p < 0.001) with PTSD scores measured by Posttraumatic
Stress Disorder Checklist Military Version. Higher resiliency
scores are also associated with improved physical as well
as mental health. Taylor et al9 surveyed 120 military males
using the DRS-15 and Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36)

 and reported DRS-15 scores were associated with physical
and mental health markers.
Our study examined the relationships between self-reported
physical activity, physical performance assessment (Army
Physical Fitness Test [APFT]), omega-3 and omega-6 fatty
acids, vitamin D, and measures of resiliency (DRS-15) in
active duty Soldiers to determine if diet and/or physical activ-
ity patterns related to mood/depression scores (PHQ-9) and
whether individuals with different levels or categories had dif-
fering responses among these variables.
METHODS
Participants
One hundred generally healthy, active duty male Soldiers from
a support battalion at Fort Hood, Texas, ages 18 to 50 years,
were recruited to participate in this study. Excluded from the
study were Soldiers who were actively being treated by
Behavioral Health providers, who were not physically able
to perform the standard APFT, or both. Volunteers who met
study criteria were invited to a familiarization session that fur-
ther outlined details of the study. Participants signed consent
forms in compliance with the Human Subjects Internal
Review Committee at Texas A&M University and the San
Antonio Military Medical Center Department of Clinical
Investigation Office of the Institutional Review Board.
Experimental Design
Participant recruitment and data collection were conducted
over a 3-day period in the month of October 2013. On Day 1,
participants were recruited and interested Soldiers were given
the opportunity to attend a recruitment briefing. Participants
who met study inclusion criteria were invited to a familiariza-
tion session that outlined study details, obtained signatures on
consent forms, had participants complete the International
Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ), PHQ-9, DRS-15,
and Big 5 questionnaire, and obtained general information on
participant military occupational specialty, time in service,
rank, and the number of combat deployments conducted. The
participants were then instructed to fast for 8 to 10 hours,
consuming water only, before the blood draw to be obtained
in the morning of Day 2.
On Day 2, participants arrived fasting for blood draw and
testing where 10 mL of venous blood was obtained from
an antecubital vein using standard phlebotomy procedures by
a military medical staff member. Participants were then
instructed to report in the morning of Day 3 for the APFT.
On Day 3, participants completed 2 minutes of push-ups,
2 minutes of sit-ups, and a 2-mile run for time using custom-
ary military APFT procedures. Participants were required to
take 10 minutes of rest between each event. The number of
push-up and sit-up repetitions completed and run times were
recorded on a score sheet for each subject. Anthropometric
measurements of height and weight were performed and
recorded for each participant.
PROCEDURES
Laboratory Measures
Subject blood samples were analyzed by Quest Diagnostics
(San Juan Capistrano, California).
Fatty Acids
Fatty acids were separated by high-performance liquid chro-
matography and detected by mass spectrometry (single ion
monitoring and selective reaction monitoring) in the nega-
tive atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization mode. Results
were based on peak areas, with each individual fatty acid
divided by the total fatty acid areas to generate a percentage.
Calculation of ratios were made as follows: omega-3 index =
(eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + DHA) ÷ total phospholipid
fatty acids; omega-6/omega-3 ratio = sum of omega-6 fatty
acids ÷ sum of omega-3 fatty acids; and arachidonic acid
index (AA)/EPA = %AA ÷ %EPA. Omega-3 index categori-
cal definitions for cardiovascular risk factor are omega-3 index
<1.1 = high risk, omega-3 index 1.1 to 3.3 = moderate risk,
and omega-3 index >3.3 = low risk as established by previ-
ous research.10–13
Vitamin D (25(OH)D)
Protein precipitation of serum samples was used to release
25-OH vitamin D2 and D3 from their binding proteins. Inter-
nal standards (deuterated 25OH D2 and D3) were added to
correct for procedural losses. The 25OH D2 and D3 were
separated from one another and other vitamin D analogs
were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography
before being quantitated using a tandem mass spectrometry
analyzer run in Positive mode. The definition of vitamin D
deficiency and insufficiency was based on the practice
guidelines of The Endocrine Society.14 Vitamin D deficiency
was defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and
vitamin D insufficiency as a 25(OH)D of 20 to 29 ng/mL
(525–725 nmol/L).14
Anthropometric Measurements and Physical
Fitness Assessment
Height and weight was measured using a Detecto 439 Physi-
cian Balance Beam Scale (Detecto Scale Company, Webb
City, Missouri) and recorded to the nearest half inch and the
nearest half pound. BMI (703 × [mass (lbs) ÷ height in
inches2]) was then calculated classified as underweight
(BMI < 18.5), normal (BMI = 18.5–24.9), overweight
(BMI = 25.0–29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30) as per guidelines
by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.15 The
APFT was conducted in accordance with the most current
Field Manual 7-22 that mandates standards for Army physi-
cal readiness training and testing.16 Raw APFT results were
scored on a 100-point scale that accounts for age and sex of
the individual. Scoring is based on a scale of 100 established
on prior normative data.17 A score less than 60 in any one
event is considered failing.

 Questionnaires
PHQ-9, DRS-15, and IPAQ were distributed to participants
and participants were instructed to fill out all forms both
honestly and completely.
Statistical Methods
Power calculation determined a sample size of 100 achieves
95% power to detect an R-squared of 0.20 attributed to
8 independent variable(s) using an F test with a significance
level (α) of 0.05000. Power calculation was completed using
NCSS PASS (NCSS LLC, Kaysville, Utah). Pearson product
moment correlation was used to determine if a significant
relationship existed among variables. A binary logistic regres-
sion model was constructed based on correlation results to
predict mood outcomes. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test was
used to assess goodness of fit. All correlation and regression
analyses were completed using IBM SPSS statistics software
version 22 (IBM Statistics, Chicago, Illinois).
RESULTS
Table I population data present the means ± standard devia-
tions (SDs) and range of participants for variables measured.
Participant Demographics
Participants were active duty male service members 26 ±
5.6 years; 69.2 ± 3.2 inches, 185 ± 26 pounds, with BMI of
27.1 ± 3.2 kg/m2. For BMI, no participants were classified
as underweight, 24 were classified as normal, 57 were classi-
fied as overweight, and 19 were classified as obese. Partici-
pants were in the service an average of 5.4 ± 7.7 years
(range = 6 months to 22 years). Of the 100 participants stud-
ied, 37 had never deployed, 35 deployed once, 11 deployed
twice, 7 deployed 3 times, 8 deployed 4 times, 1 deployed
5 times, and 1 deployed 7 times. Of these participants,
10 were officers, 26 were senior enlisted and noncommis-
sioned officers (E-5 and above), and the remaining 64 were
junior enlisted (E-4 and below).
Fitness Assessment
The raw performance means ± SDs and range from the
APFT are for push-ups 56 ± 13.8 (29–98) in 2 minutes,
63 ± 11.3 sit-ups (39–106) in 2 minutes, and 2-mile run
in 959.68 ± 167.37 (710–1,140) seconds. Age- and sex-
adjusted 100-point scale performance scores demonstrated a
mean ± SD for push-ups of 77.8 ± 13.7, sit-ups 77.5 ± 14.0,
and run 66.6 ± 20.7.
Psychometric Assessments
The mean ± SD for the PHQ-9 was 4.93 ± 5.17 with 63 par-
ticipants classified with minimal depression (score 0–4),
24 with mild depression (score 5–9), 7 with moderate depres-
sion (score 10–14), 1 with moderately severe depression
(score 15–19), and 5 with severe depression (score 20–24).
Physical Activity
Participants demonstrated significant variability in reporting
activity that could only be attributed to confusion with the
question as they either included or excluded work activity in
their physical activity report given the metabolic equivalent
of task (MET) total mean ± SD was 21,958 ± 81,577 MET-
min/wk. Given the high SD and the fact that 32 participants
did not report any job activity, we deemed the MET data
invalid and did not use them in our analyses. However, all
participants did report sitting time, so these data were used
in the analyses.
Hematological Analyses
The vitamin D classifications for the group were 16 of the
participants classified as deficient (<20 ng/mL), 39 as insuf-
ficient (20–29 ng/mL), and 45 as optimal (>30 ng/mL).
The mean for omega-3 index for cardiovascular disease
was 1.38 ± 0.51 with 19 participants classified in high risk,
80 in moderate risk, and only 1 in the low-risk category.
Correlational Analyses
The PHQ-9 scores were significantly correlated with DRS
total resiliency scores (r = −0.533, p ≤ 0.05) and run time
(r = −0.269, p ≤ 0.05). DRS total resiliency scores were
positively correlated with run scores (r = 0.232, p ≤ 0.05)
and negatively associated with weekly sitting time (r =
−0.202, p ≤ 0.01). DRS total resiliency scores were corre-
lated with AA levels (r = −0.205, p ≤ 0.01). Run scores

score (r = 0.406, p ≤ 0.05), number of sit-ups (r = 0.464,
p ≤ 0.05), sit-up score (r = 0.463, p ≤ 0.05), and DRS com-
mitment (r = −0.198, p ≤ 0.05). Vitamin D levels were
associated weekly sitting time (r = −0.221, p ≤ 0.05). EPA
levels were significantly associated with number of push-ups
(r = 0.262, p ≤ 0.05) and sit-ups (r = 0.257, p ≤ 0.05).
DHA levels were significantly associated with number of
push-ups (r = 0.209, p ≤ 0.05). AA levels were associated
with DRS total resiliency (r = −0.205, p ≤ 0.05). Weekly
sitting totals were also significantly correlated with DRS
commitment (r = −0.312, p ≤ 0.05).
Regression Equation Development
On the basis of our Pearson analyses, a binary logistic
regression analysis using total resiliency, BMI, vitamin D,
APFT total score, DHA, EPA, AA, and sitting total was
conducted to predict whether a subject would be recommended
to seek behavioral health care based on PHQ-9 cutoff score
of ≥10, which has been used in previous research.18 Data
from Tables II and III demonstrated that our model predicted
whether a subject would have a PHQ-9 score associated
with being recommended for behavioral health care or not
with 80% accuracy compared to the null hypothesis model
of 13%. The model had a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity
of 80.5%, a positive likelihood ratio of 3.94, and a negative
likelihood ratio of 0.287. We repeated the analysis without
blood markers using total resiliency, BMI, APFT total score,
and sitting total. The nonblood marker model predicted
whether a subject would have a PHQ-9 score of ≥10
with 79% accuracy. The nonblood marker model had a sen-
sitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 79.3%, a positive likeli-
hood ratio of 3.71, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.291
(see Tables IV and V). Both models were then tested using
subject data in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond,
Washington) with the classification cutoff set at 0.13 and
prediction rate matched SPSS data (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).

DISCUSSION
A 2014 report by the Veterans Health Administration
showed that suicide rates among male veterans aged under
30 years increased by 44% from 2009 to 2011.19 The major-
ity of our study population fits into this category, with an
age mean ± SD of 26 ± 5.6, with 63% having deployed
at least once and 27% having deployed multiple times. Our
finding of a 13% rate of depression based on PHQ-9 scores
is similar to a study of 18,305 Army and National Guard
Soldiers, as the rate was 16% and 11% for the Army and
National Guard Soldiers deployed to Iraq, respectively.20
Our mean PHQ-9 score was similar to the mean values
that Breitbach et al21 reported (4.5 ± 5.9) in 955 male entry-
level military personnel. Our PHQ-9 scores are slightly higher

A Novel Potential Screening Tool for Depressed Mood in Active Duty Soldiers

 than those found by Luxton et al22 in 6,427 military males
pre- and postdeployment with a mean ± SD of 2.26 ± 3.31
predeployment and
3.62 ± 4.37 postdeployment. However,
our PHQ-9 scores that were above 9 are similar to the 10.5%
as reported by Luxton et al22
postdeployment, as ours are
9% when adjusted for those who have not deployed. More
recently Schaller et al23 reported a PHQ-9 adjusted mean of
7.2 based on results from 30,033 active service members, but
it should be noted that this group included females and mem-
bers from other services. The model used by Schaller et al23
also adjusted for component status, time, sex, birth year, race/
ethnicity, education, marital status, military pay grade, service
branch, occupation, deployment status, separation status,
baseline smoking status, alcohol-related problems, and base-
line PTSD symptoms.
Our DRS-15 mean scores for commitment, control, chal-
lenge, and total hardiness/resiliency were comparable to the
established norms for adult males by Bartone24 for commit-
ment 10.19 ± 2.47, control 10.27 ± 2.06, challenge 9.86 ±
2.30, and total hardiness/resiliency 30.34 ± 5.21. We found
that there was a strong negative relationship between DRS-15
and PHQ-9 scores. Similar findings were reported by Escolas
et al8 in 561 service members with DRS-15 scores negatively
associated (r = −0.39, p < 0.001) with PTSD scores measured
by Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Military Version.
The mean DRS-15 of our population was slightly higher than
that reported by Escolas et al8 of 28.69 ± 6.16. We also found
a significant positive correlation between DRS-15 scores and
run scores and a negative correlation with weekly sitting time.
Our results demonstrate that DRS-15 scores are associated
with physical and mental health markers. Taylor et al9
reported a similar finding of an association between DRS-15
and physical health in 120 military men utilizing a Short
Form Health Survey (SF-36). DRS-15 scores were similar
to our population with commitment (13.7 ± 2.3), control
(11.1 ± 1.8), challenge (7.8 ± 2.3), and DRS-15 total (32.6 ±
4.6) along with age (24 ± 3.3) of participants.9
Our mean for vitamin D was slightly higher than the
mean of 24.5 ± 0.5 and 24.8 ± 0.5 SEM ng/mL in 495 U.S.
service member suicide cases and 495 controls, respectively,
reported by Umhau et al.4 Our numbers are slightly lower
than the 30 ± 10 ng/mL reported by Wentz et al25 in 314
Special Operation Forces Soldiers. In our study, 16% of the
subjects were classified as vitamin D deficient, which is
slightly lower than the 30% vitamin D deficient reported by
Umhau4; however, our 55% insufficient to deficient levels
are similar to the over half insufficient to deficient levels
reported by Wentz et al.25 Our 39% vitamin D insufficiency
rates are similar to those found in the general population:
37.27% of 3,100 males aged 18 to 39 years were classified
as mild to moderate hypovitaminosis D (25–70 nmol) from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
data.26 For comparison that would be 6.29 to 22.01 ng/mL,
so the majority would fall into our deficient range of
<20 ng/mL. The low vitamin D levels we observed and pre-
viously reported in the military population could pose not
only a physical but also a mental concern. As shown in pre-
vious research by Ganji et al27 who, in a sample of 7,970
noninstitutionalized U.S. residents aged 15 to 39 years,
found the odds for having current depressive episodes as
1.85 greater ( p = 0.021) in those who were vitamin D defi-
cient compared to those who were not.
Our mean values for DHA were similar to the findings of
Lewis et al,3 who reported that in blood samples of 800 ser-
vice members who committed suicide, DHA mean values
were 1.14 ± 0.45 (% total phospholipids), and in 800 blood
samples of service members in the control group, DHA mean
values were 1.19 ± 0.47 (percentage of total phospholipids).3
However, like Johnston et al,28 we found no significant asso-
ciation between PHQ-9 scores and omega-3 fatty acid levels.
This may be because a larger sample size was needed to
reach statistical significance. In our study, DHA and EPA
levels were significantly lower than the values reported by
Johnston et al28 for DHA (2.61 ± 0.65, % total phospholipids)
and EPA (0.40 ± 0.18, % total phospholipids).
We did not find any association between omega-3 index
scores and other pertinent variables. This was similar to the
findings by Johnston et al,28 who found that it was not signifi-
cantly associated with depression in a sample of 78 Soldiers
reporting to behavioral health care for treatment in Iraq.28 Our
omega-3 index was significantly lower than those reported by
Johnston et al (3.5 ± 0.7).28 The difference in mean DHA and
omega-3 index may be due to the different technique of
assessing omega-3 index, as Johnston et al28 used dried blood
spot testing instead of plasma.
We also observed that AA levels were negatively associ-
ated with resiliency. This finding is similar to the findings of
Adams et al,29 who found higher AA levels to EPA levels
were significantly associated with increased severity of depres-
sion measured on a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.29
Higher AA levels have also been associated with increased
depression following interferon treatment.30
Weekly sitting time was negatively associated with total
resiliency scores. Two Bosnian studies using the IPAQ and
PHQ-9 reported an association between higher physical
activity and lower PHQ-9 scores and lower physical activity
and higher PHQ-9 scores.31,32 In a study of 346 U.S. mili-
tary veterans being treated for PTSD, Davidson et al33
reported that exercise was associated with fewer depressive
symptoms, along with better quality of sleep. A thorough
meta-analysis of 30 trials by Rimer et al34 reported that exer-
cise may serve as a potential treatment for depression, as
exercise reduced depressive symptoms in individuals who
were depressed when compared to those who performed
no exercise.
CONCLUSION
In our investigation, we demonstrated that resiliency and
physical fitness are significantly negatively correlated with

 depression scores in Soldiers based on the PHQ-9 assessment.
Although these findings are naturally intuitive, it is important
to scientifically confirm these connections to determine both
potential predictors and interventions for depressed mood.
The regression model we formulated serves both as a
potential model for variables to be collected in a future
interventional study as well as a predictive tool to identify
Soldiers who might be at risk for moderate to severe
depression as classified by the PHQ-9. By improving resil-
iency in service members, we can potentially decrease the
risk of mental health issues. Early identification can poten-
tially decrease the risk of negative outcomes for our active
service members as well as our separated and retired mili-
tary veterans. The limitations to this study were that all
participants were recruited from the same battalion at Fort
Hood and, because no supplement intervention was being
utilized, only an associative relationship could be established.
Future intervention trials should be conducted to explore the
interrelationship between EPA, DHA, AA, vitamin D, sitting
time, and physical fitness on mood and resiliency, and to
determine if and where cause-and-effect relationships occur.
