IMPORTANCE Cardiac conduction abnormalities are associated with an increased risk for
morbidity and mortality, and understanding factors that accelerate or delay conduction
system disease could help to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies. Antifibrotic and
anti-inflammatory properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and treatment for
hyperlipidemia may reduce the risk for incident conduction system disease.
OBJECTIVE To identify the effect of pharmacologic therapy randomization and clinical risk
factors on the incidence of conduction system disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis of the Antihypertensive and
Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) investigation acquired data
from 623 North American centers. A total of 21 004 ambulatory individuals 55 years or older
with hypertension and at least 1 other cardiac risk factor were included in the analysis.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine besylate,
lisinopril, or chlorthalidone. Individuals with elevated fasting low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels were also randomized to pravastatin sodium vs usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained at study
enrollment and every 2 years of follow-up. The development of incident first-degree
atrioventricular block, left anterior fascicular block, incomplete left bundle branch block
(LBBB), LBBB, incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), RBBB, or intraventricular
conduction delay was assessed by serial ECGs.
RESULTS The 21 004 participants (11 758 men [56.0%]; 9246 women [44.0%]; mean [SD]
age, 66.5 [7.3] years) underwent a mean (SD) follow-up of 5.0 (1.2) years. Among the 1114
participants who developed any conduction defect, 389 developed LBBB, 570 developed
RBBB, and 155 developed intraventricular conduction delay. Compared with chlorthalidone,
randomization to lisinopril was associated with a significant 19% reduction in conduction
abnormalities (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95; P = .01). Treatment with
amlodipine, however, was not associated with a significant difference in conduction outcome
events (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.09; P = .42). Similarly, pravastatin treatment was not
associated with a reduced adjusted risk for incident disease compared with usual
hyperlipidemia treatment (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95-1.35; P = .18). Increased age (HR, 1.47; 95%
CI, 1.34-1.63; P < .001), male sex (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.73; P < .001), white race (HR,
0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.70; P < .001), diabetes (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.42; P = .003), and left
ventricular hypertrophy (HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 2.61-3.94; P < .001) were also independently
associated with increased risk for conduction system disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Incident conduction system disease is significantly reduced
by lisinopril therapy and is independently associated with multiple clinical factors. Further
studies are warranted to determine whether pharmacologic treatment affects conduction
abnormality outcomes, including pacemaker implantation.

M
ultiplestudieshavecharacterizedtheprevalenceand
prognosis of conduction system disease as identi-
fied on the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).
Right and left bundle branch block (RBBB and LBBB, respec-
tively) have been associated with heightened cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality in multiple populations.1-3 Growing
evidence suggests that less severe ECG abnormalities, includ-
ing left anterior fascicular block4 and first-degree atrioven-
tricular block,5,6 are also associated with poor outcomes.
Previous investigations of predictors of incident conduc-
tion system disease have largely focused on specific conduc-
tion defects in noncontemporary and racially homogeneous
populations.7-11 In these studies, age and hypertension were
consistently identified as strong predictors of bundle branch
block. Improved recognition of characteristics associated with
incident conduction system disease is necessary to identify at-
risk patients and to develop preventive interventions. In ad-
dition, a subset of individuals with conduction system dis-
ease will ultimately develop complete heart block, which
necessitateslifelongimplantablecardiovasculardevicetherapy.
Understanding factors that prevent or delay conduction sys-
tem disease could shift the treatment paradigm of this disor-
der, potentially reducing the likelihood of pacemaker implan-
tation among certain high-risk patients.
Given the known mechanistic links among hypertension,
inflammation, fibrosis, and conduction abnormalities, we ex-
amined whether randomized assignment to antihyperten-
sives and/or therapy to lower lipid levels might affect the de-
velopment of incident conduction system disease in the
Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent
Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).12 We also studied the effect of
other clinical characteristics on the development of incident
conduction abnormalities in this large, contemporary popu-
lation of at-risk individuals with hypertension.
Methods
ALLHAT Design
ALLHAT was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial spon-
sored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Eligi-
bility, enrollment, and follow-up protocols have been pub-
lishedpreviously.12,13Briefly,42 418individuals55orolderwith
hypertension and at least 1 other cardiac risk factor were eli-
gible for enrollment. Participants with a history of hospital-
ization for heart failure, treatment for symptomatic heart fail-
ure,orseveresystolicdysfunction(ejectionfraction≤35%)were
excluded. Certification to use deidentified ALLHAT data was
obtained from the committee on human research of the Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco. All participants provided
written informed consent on enrollment.
AfterundergoingabaselinephysicalexaminationandECG,
participants were randomized to treatment with chlorthali-
done, amlodipine besylate, lisinopril, or doxazosin mesylate.
In addition to antihypertensive randomization, 10 355 partici-
pants with elevated fasting levels of low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (120-189 mg/dL or 100-129 mg/dL if known ath-
erosclerotic coronary heart disease was present; to convert to
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) were also random-
ized in a nonblinded fashion to pravastatin sodium or usual
care.14 Participants randomized to the antihypertensive arm
were followed up for all-cause mortality. Those in the lipid lev-
el–lowering arm were followed up for the combined primary
end points of fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction. Follow-up ECGs were obtained every 2 years.
Study Cohort
Study data were collected from February 23, 1994, to March
31, 2002 (completion of follow-up). The ALLHAT doxazosin
treatment arm was terminated early because of a very low like-
lihood of finding a significant difference for the primary out-
comeandowingtoincreasedcardiovasculardiseaseevents(es-
peciallyheartfailure)comparedwithchlorthalidone.15Assuch,
participants randomized to doxazosin treatment (n = 9061)
were not included in the present investigation. All individu-
als randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril
without prevalent conduction system disease on the base-
line ECG, without a paced rhythm on the baseline ECG, and
with at least 1 follow-up ECG were included in incident analy-
ses (Figure 1).
Treatment
Participants were treated with escalating doses of antihyper-
tensives according to their treatment randomization group to
achieveagoalbloodpressureoflessthan140/90mmHg.Maxi-
mal allowable doses were 25 mg/d for chlorthalidone, 10 mg/d
foramlodipinebesyate,and40mg/dforlisinopril.12Inthelipid
level–loweringarm,participantsrandomizedtopravastatinso-
dium were initially treated with 20 mg/d, followed by a dos-
age increase to 40 mg/d as needed to lower low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol levels by at least 25%. This strategy was
amendedafterthefirst1000participantswereenrolled;astan-
dardized pravastatin sodium dosage of 40 mg/d was used
thereafter.14

tem disease and assessed during ALLHAT enrollment were
Key Points
Question Can pharmacologic therapy reduce the incidence of
conduction system disease as assessed by the 12-lead
electrocardiogram?
Findings In this secondary analysis of the Antihypertensive and
Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial,
randomization to lisinopril treatment significantly reduced the
incidence of conduction abnormalities compared with
chlorthalidone. Treatment with amlodipine or pravastatin
(compared with usual hyperlipidemia treatment) did not reduce
the incidence of conduction system disease.
Meaning The antifibrotic effects of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors may prevent or slow the development of
conduction system disease, and future research is warranted
to understand whether this treatment affects other
conduction-related clinical outcomes.

identified before analysis. Race or ethnicity, smoking status,
and medical history were recorded using a standardized form
on study enrollment. For the present analysis, non-Hispanic
white participants were categorized as white; Hispanic white
participants, as Hispanic; and black participants, as black re-
gardless of Hispanic ethnicity status. Participants who did not
identify as white, black, or Hispanic were included in the race
category of other. Definitions of comorbid conditions, includ-
ing coronary heart disease, diabetes, and smoking status, are
described in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Left ventricular hy-
pertrophy was diagnosed by ECG using the Cornell voltage
criteria.16 Serum potassium, creatinine, glucose, and lipid pro-
files were obtained in a fasting state at the baseline visit.
Conduction System Disease Ascertainment
Conduction system disease was assessed using standard 12-
lead ECGs obtained in the supine position at 0, 24, 48, 72, and
96 months of follow-up. Abnormal findings on the ECGs were
classified using the Minnesota code classification system for
electrocardiographic findings17 in a core laboratory at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. Criteria used to define incident conduc-
tion system disease are described in eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment. Any conduction system disease was defined as first-
degree atrioventricular block, left anterior fascicular block,
incomplete LBBB, LBBB, incomplete RBBB, RBBB, or intra-
ventricular conduction delay.
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromJune28,2014,toMarch17,2016.Con-
tinuous variables are presented as mean (SD) and compared
using 2-sample t tests. The association between categorical
variables was determined using the Pearson χ2 test. Cox pro-
portional hazards models were used to determine the asso-
ciation between baseline covariates and incident conduction
system disease before and after controlling for hypothesized
confounders. Participants were censored at the time of their
ECG-diagnosed conduction abnormality or at the time of their
last study ECG, whichever came first. Additional analyses ex-
amining the clinical predictors of incident isolated RBBB and
LBBB were also performed. Interaction analyses were per-
formed to determine whether the association between anti-
hypertensive treatment assignment and conduction system
disease differed with respect to race or baseline left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy. Cumulative event rates were calculated using
theKaplan-Meiermethod.Weusedanintention-to-treatanaly-
sis to quantify the association between drug assignment and
conduction outcomes. Data were analyzed using STATA (ver-
sion 12; StataCorp). A 2-tailed P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Among the 33 357 ALLHAT participants randomized to
chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril, 1537 demonstrated
prevalent conduction system disease (including 461 individu-
als with LBBB and 892 with RBBB), 125 were excluded sec-
ondary to a paced rhythm on the baseline ECG, and 10 691 did
not have a baseline or at least 1 follow-up ECG (Figure 1).
ALLHAT participants with serial ECGs were more likely to be
men and white, not to have diabetes, and to be treated with
aspirin (eTable 3 in the Supplement) compared with individu-
als without serial ECGs. Individuals with serial ECGs were less
likely to have left ventricular hypertrophy. Other differences
inbaselinecharacteristicsbetweenincludedandexcludedpar-
ticipants, although statistically significant, were not clini-
cally substantial.
The remaining cohort of 21 004 participants (11 758 men
[56.0%];9246women[44.0%];mean[SD]age,66.5[7.3]years)
wasfollowedforamean(SD)5.0 (1.2)years.Individualstreated
with lisinopril had significantly higher systolic and diastolic
blood pressure compared with individuals treated with
chlorthalidone or amlodipine at nearly all points (eTable 4 in
the Supplement). A total of 1114 participants developed inci-
dent conduction system disease during this period, including
570 with RBBB and 389 with LBBB (Figure 2); the remaining
155 participants had intraventricular conduction delay. No in-
dividuals demonstrated incident first-degree atrioventricu-
lar block, left anterior fascicular block, or incomplete bundle
branch block. The overall incidence was 13.0 (95% CI, 12.2-
13.7) per 1000 person-years for any conduction abnormality,
4.5 (95% CI, 4.1-5.0) per 1000 person-years for LBBB, and 6.6
(95% CI, 6.1-7.2) per 1000 person-years for RBBB. Partici-

older and more likely to be white and male and had more co-
morbidities, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and
left ventricular hypertrophy (Table).
Participants randomized to treatment with lisinopril
were significantly less likely to develop incident conduction
system disease compared with those randomized to
chlorthalidone therapy (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95; P = .01)
(Figure 3). Treatment with amlodipine, however, was not
associated with a significant difference in conduction out-
come events (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.09; P = .42). Similarly,
randomization to pravastatin was not associated with a
reduced adjusted risk for incident disease compared with
usual hyperlipidemia treatment (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95-1.35;
P = .18). When amlodipine was used as the reference antihy-
pertensive treatment assignment, randomization to
chlorthalidone did not result in a significantly different risk
for conduction system disease (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91-1.24;
P = .42). Compared with amlodipine, lisinopril randomiza-
tion was associated with a reduction in incident conduction
system disease (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.03), although this
was not statistically significant (P = .10).
Although treatment with lisinopril vs chlorthalidone re-
sulted in a greater reduction in the risk for incident conduc-
tion system disease among white (HR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-
0.89) compared with black (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.67-1.34)
participants, no statistically significant interaction was de-
tected (P = .16). No statistically significant interaction was
found between baseline left ventricular hypertrophy and an-
tihypertensive treatment randomization.

When the conduction system disease outcome was re-
stricted to incident LBBB, the magnitude of LBBB risk reduc-
tion with lisinopril was similar to that observed for all con-
duction abnormalities, although not of statistical significance
(adjusted HR vs chlorthalidone, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-1.00;
P = .05). In a similar analysis that examined the association be-
tween antihypertensive treatment and incident RBBB, lisin-
opril was associated with a nonsignificant reduced risk for dis-
ease (adjusted HR vs chlorthalidone, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09;
P = .23).
In multivariable models that adjusted for antihyperten-
sive treatment, statin treatment, and the variables described

(HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44; P = .003), and left ventricular hy-
pertrophy(HR,3.20;95%CI,2.61-3.94;P < .001)wereeachsig-
nificantly associated with an increased risk for incident
conduction system disease (Figure 4). Black participants, on
the other hand, demonstrated a significantly reduced ad-
justed risk for conduction system disease compared with non-
Hispanic white participants (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.70;
P < .001).
Discussion
In a large cohort of older individuals with hypertension ran-
domized to antihypertensive treatment and followed up with
serial ECGs, we found that randomization to lisinopril therapy
resulted in a 19% reduction in the overall risk for incident con-
duction system disease compared with chlorthalidone. In ad-
dition, several clinical factors were associated with the devel-
opmentofincidentconductionsystemdisease.Increasingage,
male sex, and left ventricular hypertrophy were among the
strongest predictors of incident disease, whereas black indi-
viduals had significantly less conduction system disease com-
pared with white individuals.
The randomized ALLHAT study design allowed us to cal-
culate an unbiased association between pharmacologic treat-
ment assignment and incident conduction system disease. Al-
though angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and
statins have been proposed as treatments for the primary pre-
vention of atrial fibrillation owing to their antifibrotic and anti-
inflammatory properties,18,19 data from ALLHAT suggest that
incident atrial fibrillation is not reduced with lisinopril vs
chlorthalidone therapy.20 Nevertheless, we hypothesized that
ACE inhibitors and statin medications could reduce the like-
lihood of incident conduction system disease via mecha-
nisms similar to those considered for atrial fibrillation preven-
tion. Although our results exclude a clinically substantial
benefit of pravastatin therapy compared with usual care, treat-
ment with lisinopril resulted in a significant reduction in con-
duction system disease events compared with chlorthali-
done. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher in the
lisinopril treatment group compared with the chlorthalidone
or amlodipine group (eTable 4 in the Supplement). As a re-
sult, the significant reduction in conduction system disease
attributed to lisinopril treatment cannot be fully explained by
the antihypertensive effects of this medication.
Althoughstudiesinvestigatingtheassociationbetweenan-
tihypertensivetreatmentandregressionofleftventricularmass
havenotreacheduniformconclusions,21,22someevidencesug-
gests that ACE inhibitors may be superior to diuretics and cal-
cium channel blockers for improvement in this variable.23 Fur-
thermore, the reduction in ventricular hypertrophy with ACE
inhibition may occur independently of antihypertensive
effects.24Giventhatleftventricularhypertrophywasthestron-
gest independent predictor of incident conduction system dis-
ease,theabilityoflisinopriltomitigatethisriskfactormaypro-
vide an explanation for the efficacy of ACE inhibitors beyond
their antifibrotic effects. In light of the established associa-
tion between left-sided conduction abnormalities and subse-
quent systolic heart failure4 and in conjunction with data sug-
gesting that the reversal of LBBB-induced dyssynchrony can
improve left ventricular systolic function,25,26 we may specu-
late whether the benefit of ACE inhibition in the treatment of
patients with chronic heart failure is partially explained by the
prevention of conduction system disease. On the other hand,
prior ALLHAT data27 suggest that lisinopril is not superior to
chlorthalidone for the long-term prevention of incident diag-
noses of heart failure.
Most prior investigations examining conduction system
disease have focused on the association between prevalent
conduction abnormalities and clinical outcomes. Various
studies have found associations of LBBB,1-3,7, 28-32
RBBB,1,2,8,11,31,33 intraventricular conduction delay,32 left
anterior fascicular block,4 and first-degree atrioventricular
block5,6 with worsened outcomes. The mechanisms underly-
ing these associations are poorly understood. For instance,

whether the conduction abnormality acts as a primary cause
of pathogenesis or is instead a secondary consequence of
another pathologic myocardial process, such as infarction or
fibrosis, remains unknown. Previous histologic analyses
using autopsy specimens have identified fibrosis as the
driver of conduction system abnormalities,34,35 but why cer-
tain individuals develop clinically apparent disease remains
unclear. Because treatment with lisinopril (vs chlorthali-
done) was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascu-
lar disease and stroke end points in the primary ALLHAT
investigation, the superiority of lisinopril for the prevention
of incident conduction system disease is not readily
explained by reduced development of comorbid cardiovas-
cular conditions during study follow-up.12
The association between clinical variables and incident
conduction system disease has primarily been limited to single
conductionabnormalitiesinnoncontemporaryandraciallyho-
mogeneous cohorts. In these studies, hypertension and ad-
vanced age emerged as common risk factors for incident
LBBB7,10 and RBBB.8,9,11 Our study cohort, which consisted of
older (≥55 years) adults with hypertension, represented an
ideal, high-risk population for further study of conduction sys-
tem disease risk factors. We found that several comorbidities
beyond age are associated with the risk for a conduction ab-
normality, indicating that multiple mechanisms likely co-
alesce into a final pathologic pathway that results in manifes-
tation of clinical disease. Many of the risk factors associated
with conduction system disease, including smoking, in-
creased body mass index, diabetes, and left ventricular
hypertrophy, are preventable or treatable. The aging of the
United States population36 and the projected future increase
in prevalence of many chronic diseases, including diabetes,37
suggests the burden of conduction system disease will simi-
larly rise.
The reduction in the adjusted risk for incident conduc-
tion system disease among black compared with white par-
ticipants was an unanticipated finding. Our results add to a
recent investigation from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Com-
munities (ARIC) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)
cohorts that observed a reduced likelihood of sick sinus syn-
drome among black vs white participants.38 These results
are of further interest in light of the growing literature dem-
onstrating a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation among
black compared with white participants.20,39-41 While specu-
lative, these findings raise the possibility that a singular
mechanism (eg, accelerated myocardial fibrosis) could
explain the heightened propensity for atrial fibrillation and
conduction system disease observed in white compared
with black populations.
Limitations of this study should be acknowledged. The
current investigation is a secondary analysis of a randomized
clinical trial designed to determine the effects of pharmaco-

logic therapy on coronary artery disease events and other
major cardiovascular and renal outcomes. However, because
the primary outcome of the present study was assessed
using prospectively collected ECGs (the criterion standard
for identifying conduction system disease) analyzed accord-
ing to a standardized protocol in a core laboratory, we do not
believe that this investigative approach should meaningfully
bias our results or weaken our conclusions. Because the
ALLHAT trial enrolled participants 55 years or older with
hypertension and other cardiac risk factors, generalizability
of the current findings to younger individuals or those with-
out cardiovascular risk factors may be limited. In addition,
participant crossover between antihypertensive treatment
arms12 occurred, and an intention-to-treat analysis was used
to define the association between treatment randomization
and incident conduction system disease. However, crossover
or treatment with multiple classes of antihypertensives
would tend to bias the results toward the null hypothesis
and is therefore unlikely to explain our positive findings
with respect to ACE inhibition.
Baseline and follow-up ECGs were not obtained on all par-
ticipants, and we found statistically significant differences in
theproportionofindividualswithserialECGsbetweentheran-
domized antihypertensive treatment arms (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). Although the proportion of participants treated
withlisinoprilwaslowerintheincludedcohort(comparedwith
individuals excluded owing to lack of serial ECGs), this differ-
ence would only underestimate the observed lisinopril treat-
menteffect.Becauserenin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystemac-
tivitywasnotspecificallyassessedinALLHATparticipants,the
observed benefit of lisinopril may have actually been second-
ary to enhanced fibrosis caused by chlorthalidone-induced re-
nin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation.42 Finally, the
association between clinical variables and conduction sys-
tem abnormalities could be biased by unmeasured or incom-
pletely characterized factors important to disease pathogen-
esis. Because antihypertensive and statin treatments were
randomized, residual confounding is unlikely to explain the
association between ACE inhibitor treatment assignment and
conduction outcomes.
Conclusions
The risk for incident conduction system disease is signifi-
cantly reduced by lisinopril compared with chlorthalidone
therapy and is independently associated with multiple clini-
calfactors.Furtherstudiesarewarrantedtodeterminewhether
pharmacologic treatment can affect clinical conduction ab-
normality outcomes, including pacemaker implantation.
