Abstract
Objective: We evaluated the effects of three different strategies for communicating diagnostic
uncertainty on patient perceptions of physician competence and visit satisfaction.
Design/Setting: Experimental vignette-based study design involving pediatric cases presented to
a convenience sample of parents living in a large US city.
Participants/Intervention(s): Three vignettes were developed, each describing one of three differ-
ent ways physicians communicated diagnostic uncertainty to parents—(i) explicit expression of
uncertainty (‘not sure’ about diagnosis), (ii) implicit expression of uncertainty using broad differen-
tial diagnoses and (iii) implicit expression of uncertainty using ‘most likely’ diagnoses. Participants
were randomly assigned to one of the three vignettes and then answered a 37-item web-based
questionnaire.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Outcome variables included parent-perceived technical competence of
physician, trust and confidence, visit satisfaction and adherence to physician instructions.
Differences between the three groups were compared using analysis of variance, followed by indi-
vidual post hoc analyses with Bonferroni correction.
Results: Seventy-one participants completed the vignette questions. Demographic character-
istics and scores on activation (parent activation measure [PAM]) and intolerance to uncer-
tainty were similar across the three groups. Explicit expression of uncertainty was associated
with lower perceived technical competence, less trust and confidence, and lower patient
adherence as compared to the two groups with implicit communication. These latter two
groups had comparable outcomes.

 Conclusion: Parents may react less negatively in terms of perceived competence, physician confi-
dence and trust, and intention to adhere when diagnostic uncertainty is communicated using
implicit strategies, such as using broad differential diagnoses or most likely diagnoses. Evidence-
based strategies to communicate diagnostic uncertainty to patients need further development.

Introduction
Diagnostic uncertainty is omnipresent in clinical practice [1–6]. For
true shared decision-making and information exchange with patients,
communication of diagnostic uncertainty is essential [7, 8]. Practice
guidelines and the recent National Academies of Science, Engineering
and Medicine report ‘Improving Diagnosis in Health Care’ recom-
mend that physicians should share their working diagnosis with
patients including an explanation of the degree of uncertainty asso-
ciated with the diagnosis [9, 10]. However, the task of communicating
diagnostic uncertainty to patients is challenging, and previous studies
have reported some undesirable effects of such communication on
patients [11–15].
Although one study found that patients were more satisfied when
physicians communicated diagnostic uncertainty [7], most report the
opposite findings. For instance, simulated video-tape studies with
patients have found communicating diagnostic uncertainty is associated
with low visit satisfaction scores, decreased adherence to doctors’
instructions, low trust and decreased confidence in the doctor [16].
Other studies using patient surveys and standardized patient visits
have also found less patient satisfaction, lower patient confidence in
the physician and lower perceived competence of the physician when
diagnostic uncertainty was communicated to patients [17–21].
How physicians should communicate diagnostic uncertainty effect-
ively to patients is unknown [11, 20]. Patients may be receptive to this
type of communication if it is delivered in a way that avoids some of
the undesirable consequences described above [7, 20, 22, 23]. If com-
municated very openly, patients may appreciate the honesty or may
react negatively to the doctor’s lack of knowing what health problem
they have. Conversely, strategies that communicate in a more subtle
fashion could suggest to patients that while actual diagnosis may not
be known yet, several possibilities are being considered (e.g. using dif-
ferential diagnosis). To our knowledge, the impact of communication
of diagnostic uncertainty on parents of pediatric patients is unknown
and has not been studied. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of
three different strategies of communicating diagnostic uncertainty to
parents on their perceptions of physician competence, perceived trust
and confidence, visit satisfaction and adherence to clinical instructions.
Methods
Study setting, participants and design
We used an experimental, vignette-based study design involving
pediatric cases presented to a convenience sample of parents. The
study sample consisted of parents participating in a parent and fam-
ily advisor email listserv at a large pediatric academic center and
parents participating in two parent social-media groups. Local
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.
We created three vignettes, each describing the same clinical scen-
ario of a parent presenting to a new pediatrician with abdominal pain.
The pediatrician communicates diagnostic uncertainty to the parent
through one of three different strategies (Table 1). Each scenario then
provides reassurance to the parent and discusses the further plan for
diagnosis. The vignettes varied only with respect to how diagnostic
uncertainty was communicated according to one of three strategies: (i)
explicit expression of uncertainty (‘not sure’ about diagnosis), (ii) implicit
Table 1 Vignettes used for the study consisting of a common clinical scenario, one of the three communication strategies and a common
future plan for diagnosis
Common clinical scenario
Assume you just moved to another part of the country for work. Your child has been experiencing pain in his/her belly for about 3 weeks. You are at a
local pediatrician’s office for a third visit in 2 weeks. At the first visit, the doctor asked you about your child’s previous illnesses and examined your
child. The doctor also ordered some laboratory tests and imaging, which did not point to any particular disease. At the second visit, the doctor
ordered some more tests, which were completed before your visit today. During this visit, you tell the doctor that your child still has pain in his/her
belly.
1 of 3 different strategies to communicate diagnostic uncertainty
During the following discussion, the doctor says that:
he/she is not sure what might be causing
your child’s belly pain.
(Explicit communication of uncertainty)
your child’s belly pain could be caused by Disease A,
Disease B or Disease C.
(Implicit communication of uncertainty using
differential diagnoses)
your child’s belly pain is probably due to
Disease A.
(Implicit communication of uncertainty using
most likely diagnoses)
Common future plan for diagnosis
However, the doctor tries to comfort you and comes up with a detailed plan to try to figure out what is causing the belly pain. This plan includes
additional visits and tests in the next 2 weeks.

 expression of uncertainty using broad differential diagnoses (it could
be Disease A vs. Disease B or Disease C) and (iii) implicit expression
of uncertainty using ‘most likely’ diagnoses (it is probably Disease A).
The three strategies were based on expert input and shared decision-
making literature [5, 10, 15, 16]. The vignettes were iteratively devel-
oped with input from a multidisciplinary research team of physicians,
patient advocates, health service researchers, a cognitive psychologist,
a communication expert and a social worker. Participants were ran-
domly assigned to receive one of the three vignettes followed by a
questionnaire (Fig. 1).
Questionnaire development and administration
We developed a 37-item questionnaire using existing literature [16,
24–27], and input from the research team. Our outcome variables
included (i) perceived technical competence of the physician (2 items),
(ii) overall visit satisfaction (1 item), (iii) perceived trust and confidence
in the physician (3 items) and (iv) adherence to clinical instructions (1
item) (see Appendix). Participant responses were captured on a 4-point
Likert Scale ranging from Disagree Strongly to Agree Strongly. Only
items with high reliability and good to excellent internal consistency
across multiple studies were chosen [16, 24–27].
To account for patient activation level for each participating par-
ent, we used the Parent/Patient Activation Measure (Parent PAM-10
licensed by Insignia Health©) [28, 29]. The parent PAM-10 con-
sisted of a set of 10 questions captured on a 4-point Likert Scale ran-
ging from Disagree Strongly to Agree Strongly. A PAM Score was
calculated for each parent participant using the materials received
from Insignia Health© regarding the use of parent PAM-10. In the
literature, PAM has been found to be highly reliable and valid across
different populations and age-groups, and has been used in over 350
research studies internationally [28–32].
We used the Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) to meas-
ure each parent participants’ tendency or intolerance to uncertainty
due to its high reliability and good internal consistency in multiple
studies [33–35]. Responses were captured on a 5-point Likert Scale
ranging from ‘Not at all characteristic of me’ to ‘Entirely character-
istic of me’. The IUS-12 score was calculated between 0 and 120
reflecting extremes of total tolerance and intolerance, respectively.
We also collected information about the parents’ perception of
uncertainty in medical decision-making (i.e. whether parents agree
that many decisions in medicine are based on insufficient informa-
tion) using a sub-scale used in previous literature [16].
We used two strategies to account for parent participants’ pre-
existing relationship with his/her physicians. All vignettes used in
our study highlighted that the ‘parent participant had moved to a
new city and they were seeing their new pediatrician for the third
time in 2 weeks’. We also asked participants about their perception
of their current relationship with their actual pediatricians (using a
5-point Likert Scale from excellent to poor).
For all participating parents, we collected information about the
age of their children, health status of the children and parent demo-
graphics (age, gender, race and educational status). Parent partici-
pants with multiple children were instructed to think about their
youngest child while filling out the questionnaire to ensure that par-
ticipants were not biased by their healthcare experiences with the
sickest or most demanding child. Youngest were chosen instead of
oldest (or any) to homogenize the groups as much as possible and to
ensure children considered were less likely to be adult children.
After initial refinement of questionnaire items, the research team
and five additional health services researchers reviewed the vignettes
and the questionnaire for readability, clarity and ease of completion
in a web-based environment. The vignettes and questionnaire were
then pilot-tested with 15 patient participants who were not included
in the main study. The focus of the pilot was to improve readability,
to ensure participant understanding of the vignettes and to test the
mode of administration. Subsequently, one of the authors (VB) con-
ducted cognitive interviews to identify issues related to wording,
question order and vignette navigation. Both the vignettes and the
questionnaire were then refined in an iterative manner based on
input provided by the pilot participants. Wording, question order
and visual design issues identified were subsequently addressed.
The questionnaire was administered through a commercial inter-
net questionnaire administration service (surveymonkey.com). The
service generated a common survey link (URL) that was sent elec-
tronically to participants and provided details about the study (i.e. a
questionnaire to understand doctor–patient communication). After
consent was obtained electronically, the internet questionnaire
administration service randomly assigned participants to view one
of the three vignettes and complete the common questionnaire
(Fig. 1). Estimated completion time for the final 37-item question-
naire was 5–15 min. No compensation was provided to parent parti-
cipants for completing the questionnaire.
Data analysis
Data were downloaded from the internet questionnaire administration
service (surveymonkey.com) and analyzed using STATA 12 (College
Station, TX). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson’s chi-
square or Fisher’s exact tests were conducted to compare demographic
characteristics of the participants (parent age, gender, race and educa-
tional status), child age and health status, relationship with pediatri-
cian, parent activation score, intolerance to uncertainty scores and
perception of uncertainty in medicine. Items captured on the 4-point
Likert Scale (Disagree Strongly to Agree Strongly) were correspond-
ingly converted into scores of 1–4. A sub-scale score was calculated for
each of our outcome variables (perceived technical competence of the
physician, trust and confidence, visit satisfaction and adherence) by
averaging the individual item scores for all constituent items. Because
the scale was ordinal, a higher score was considered relatively more
favorable while making comparisons between the groups. In the

 absence of rigorous literature evidence to guide us with our research
question, we had no a priori hypotheses regarding which communica-
tion methods would related to a better or worse outcomes. Minimum
sample size per group was calculated to be 20 to obtain a power of
0.80, assuming α = 0.05 (two tailed test). Post hoc analyses using
ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections were used to compare the sub-
scale scores across the three groups. All possible pairwise post hoc
comparisons were conducted.
Results
Between May 2016 and April 2017, 71 parents participated in our
vignette study. Vignettes with explicit communication and implicit
communication using broad differential diagnoses had 25 partici-
pants each, while the ‘most likely diagnoses’ vignette group had 21.
Participants across the three groups were similar with respect to par-
ent activation levels (PAM, P = 0.73), self-tolerance to uncertainty
scores (P = 0.21), perception of uncertainty in medicine (P = 0.37),
relationship with pediatrician (P = 0.32), child’s age (P = 0.18),
child’s health status (P = 0.80) and other demographics (Table 2).
We found significant statistical differences among the three groups
on three of the outcomes of interest: perceived technical competence of
the physician (P = 0.007), trust and confidence (P = 0.002) and patient
adherence (P = 0.003). For visit satisfaction, we found no statistically
significant differences (P = 0.059; see Table 3). Overall, groups with
implicit communication (either using differential diagnoses or most
likely diagnoses), were relatively more favorable on the three outcomes
of interest: perceived technical competence, trust and confidence and
adherence, in comparison to the group with explicit communication.
The absolute score was not interpreted but differences in the score
represented a more favorable response. For example, the mean scores
for perceived technical competence of the physician for the implicit
groups (differential diagnosis—2.62; most likely diagnosis—2.52) were
0.58 points and 0.48 points higher respectively, compared to the mean
score for the explicit group (2.04), revealing a more favorable relative
response. More details in Table 3.
Post hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction test (see Table 3
for details) revealed that outcome variables perceived technical com-
petence and trust and confidence were less favorable relatively in the
explicit group when compared to both implicit groups (P = 0.009
and P = 0.048; P = 0.005 and P = 0.010, respectively). For adher-
ence to instructions, implicit group with differential diagnosis was
relatively favorable compared to explicit group (P = 0.003). Both
implicit groups were similar with respect to perceived technical con-
fidence, trust, visit satisfaction and adherence.
Discussion
We evaluated parent perceptions of three different strategies that
pediatricians could use to communicate diagnostic uncertainty about
their children’s illnesses. Our findings suggest that parents react less
negatively to implicit expressions of diagnostic uncertainty using
broad differential diagnoses or most likely diagnoses over explicit
expressions. We did not find any differences in their reactions to the
methods of implicit expression of diagnostic uncertainty, i.e. using
either a differential diagnosis or the most probable diagnosis.
Our findings suggest that parents prefer when physicians imply
that a diagnosis is not certain by using differential diagnoses or the
most likely diagnosis as compared to explicitly acknowledging that
they are ‘not sure’. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to com-
pare different strategies of communicating diagnostic uncertainty in
clinical practice from the parent’s perspective. Because little is known

 about how physicians communicate diagnostic uncertainty to their
patients, physicians often rely on personal experiences and self-made
strategies when tasked with such communication [11, 19, 20]. For
example, one clinic-based study in Oregon found that physicians expli-
citly expressed uncertainty in 71% of clinical visits [7], which we found
as more negatively perceived by parents in our study. These findings
are important in light of increasing emphasis on making care more
patient-centered and improving patient experience [36–40].
Our work has important implications for understanding and
improving physician–patient communication related to diagnosis.
Managing uncertainty has been discussed as a critical aspect of
patient-centered communication [31, 32]. Patients are known to
have complex cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to
uncertainty [11, 41]. Previous research has suggested a possible
association between physician–patient communication and long-
term health outcomes [17, 41–44]. Although the impact of commu-
nication of diagnostic uncertainty on patient outcomes has not been
studied yet, previous studies have shown negative patient percep-
tions following such communication (e.g. lack of confidence, low
visit satisfaction, worry or concern) [16–20, 22, 45]. The undesir-
able impacts of such communication could possibly extend into
other long-term patient outcomes and this link should be studied
further. While we found preliminary evidence in support of implicit
expressions such as using the differential diagnoses or the most
likely diagnosis for communicating diagnostic uncertainty, further
research should unravel how uncertainty is best communicated to
patients in order to optimize outcomes.
Few studies that have discussed steps for sharing diagnostic uncer-
tainty with patients suggest generating hope or opportunity for patients
and its potential to improve patient satisfaction if such communication
is accompanied by positive talk, empathy and partnership building [7,
45, 46]. Other studies have found that supplemental training programs
focusing on improving physicians’ communication skills improve
patients’ perceptions of the visit [23, 47]. Although these findings are
encouraging, strategies that physicians use to communicate diagnostic
uncertainty while maintaining patient confidence still need to be
defined and evaluated. The recent National Academies of Science,
Engineering and Medicine publication ‘Improving Diagnosis in Health
Care’ has also emphasized the importance of such communication by
including failure to communicate an explanation of a patient’s health
problem(s) to the patient in its definition of diagnostic error, and has
also highlighted that ‘the working diagnosis should be shared with the
patient, including an explanation of the degree of uncertainty asso-
ciated with a working diagnosis’ [9]. Efforts to better educate patients
about diagnostic uncertainty and to prime them to reduce their intoler-
ance to uncertainty may also need to be explored.
Our study findings can inform future work to explore what impact
parent–physician communication has on clinical practice outcomes,
such as diagnostic errors and patient adherence. A large multi-site pedi-
atrician survey found that diagnostic errors are common in pediatric
clinical practice and result in considerable harm [48]. Inappropriate
management of diagnostic uncertainty could potentially result in diag-
nostic errors. For example, suppression of uncertainty and lack of con-
sidering differential diagnoses for the patients’ problems could result in
premature closure and missed diagnoses. Physicians find it challenging
to acknowledge and make decisions when diagnostic uncertainty is pre-
sent [49]. This is additionally complicated by patients’ lower tolerance
for explicit uncertainty. However, in the era of patient-centered care,
physicians and patients will need to embrace communication of diag-
nostic uncertainty [50–52]. Communication of diagnostic uncertainty
can provide a shared understanding of the patient’s health problem and

 managing patient’s expectations for future care. This shared under-
standing could help patients better engage in the diagnostic process
including mindfulness of the evolution of the diagnostic process and
emergent care plans. Effective communication could also help prevent
delays seen in patients returning too late to the physician for worsening
health issues [53]. Our study participants perceived the use of differen-
tial diagnosis during the communication of uncertainty less negatively,
and thus further exploration of such communication is warranted.
Our study has several limitations. First, we used a convenience
sample of parent participants for our study and any generalizability to
patients of other medical specialties or to the general population is lim-
ited. We also recruited several parent/family advisors, who may have
different levels of activation and/or information sharing expectations
than the general population. However, this study is one of the first
attempts to evaluate the impact of any strategy to communicate diag-
nostic uncertainty and lays the foundation for future studies in this
area. Second, we used text-based vignettes for our study, which might
not convey subtle changes in tone, phonetics and body-language akin
to that observed in patient–physician communication in the real world.
Use of validated audiovisual tools or standardized patients could help
in better understanding patient perceptions. However, vignette-based
studies have been found to accurately test patients’ perceptions of phy-
sicians and evaluate satisfaction with patient–physician encounters and
have been commonly used in the literature [54, 55]. Moreover, vign-
ettes were exactly similar for all the three groups except the text related
to communication of diagnostic uncertainty. Third, we explored only
three distinct strategies of communicating diagnostic uncertainty in
practice although several other strategies exist and could be used [4,
22, 56]. Physicians could even combine different strategies to effectively
communicate diagnostic uncertainty in the real world. Fourth, we were
limited by our sample size in our ability to look for associations or
interactions between the different factors. Fifth, in a vignette study we
could not assess the potential moderating effects of the physician–
patient relational history and only studied a new relationship. Future
research should examine how patients/parents react differently to
expressed uncertainty in established patient–doctor relationships. Sixth,
we used a common reassurance statement for all scenarios in order to
minimize its influence on outcome variables. This approach may not
be ideal and additional research on use of reassurance in such situa-
tions is warranted. Lastly, specific measures used in the study (e.g. to
measure uncertainty in medicine) were adapted from a previously val-
idated study [16], and may need further validation.
Conclusion
We found that parents of pediatric patients may react less negatively
(i.e. less negative perception of physician’s competence, better trust
and confidence, and more intention to adhere) when communication
of diagnostic uncertainty was implicit using broad differential diag-
noses or most likely diagnosis, compared with strategies that used
explicit communication. Because uncertainty is so common in med-
ical practice, additional work is needed to understand how commu-
nicating uncertainty affects health outcomes. Our study provides an
initial foundation for future development of evidence-based guid-
ance on how physicians can effectively communicate diagnostic
uncertainty to patients.
