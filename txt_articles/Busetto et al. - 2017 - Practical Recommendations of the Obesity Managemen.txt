Abstract 
 
Bariatric surgery is today the most effective long-term therapy for the management of pa-
tients with severe obesity, and its use is recommended by the relevant guidelines of the man-
agement of obesity in adults. Bariatric surgery is in general safe and effective, but it can cause 
new clinical problems and is associated with specific diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic 
needs. For clinicians, the acquisition of special knowledge and skills is required in order to 
deliver appropriate and effective care to the post-bariatric patient. In the present recommen-

Introduction 
 
Bariatric surgery produces sustained long-term weight loss and reduces co-morbidity 
burden and mortality in patients with severe obesity  
[1] 
. Current obesity guidelines 
recommend bariatric surgery according to BMI levels and associated obesity-related diseases 
 
[2] 
. Therefore, the total number of bariatric procedures performed world-wide has increased 
steadily in recent years  
[3] 
.
 
 
On the other hand, bariatric patients may face new specific multifaceted clinical problems 
after surgery. Eating habits need to adapt to the new gastro-intestinal physiology, and nutri-
tional deficits may arise according to the type of bariatric procedure. Management of obesity-
associated disease needs to be modulated according to weight loss taking into account the 
possibility of changes in drug pharmacokinetics. Specific problems may arise in women 
during pregnancy, and the patients may experience some psychological difficulties in adapting 
to the profound changes in eating behaviour and body image. Finally, weight regain can occur 
and should be prevented and managed. 
 
 
Multidisciplinary long-term follow-up is recommended after bariatric surgery, and the 
provision of an adequate follow-up programme is mandatory for bariatric centres  
[2] 
. 
However, giving the accumulating numbers of bariatric patients, follow-up should be at least 
in part transferred to primary care over time. Moreover, post-bariatric patients may confront 
obesity specialists, dieticians and nurses not specifically trained in bariatric medicine with 
thus far unknown problems in their professional activity. Referral to the bariatric centre is 
often necessary and should be possible, but there is a growing need for dissemination of first-
level knowledge in managing bariatric patients. The aim of this document is therefore to 
provide a brief but comprehensive review of the major clinical points in bariatric medicine 
and some practical recommendations for post-bariatric surgery medical management. It 
remains clear that referral to a bariatric multidisciplinary centre, preferably the one 
performing the original procedure, should be considered in case of more complex clinical 
situations.
 
 
In this document, we tried therefore to convey the basic skills to those health care profes-
sionals that need to provide adequate first-level medical care to post-bariatric patients. First-
level information about nutritional management, micronutrients supplementation, 
management of co-morbidities, pharmacotherapy after bariatric surgery, pregnancy after 
bariatric surgery, psychological aspects as well as weight regain prevention and management 
are derived from current evidences and existing guidelines. A short list of clinical practical 
recommendations is derived from the full paper and included in each session. The levels of 
evidence and grades of these recommendations were also reported. The grading system was 
the same used in previous guidelines released by the European Association for the Study of 
Obesity (EASO)  
[2] 
 (

Nutritional Management 
 
Bariatric procedures induce significant and long-lasting changes in nutritional habits and 
eating behaviour. The anatomical and functional modifications of the gastro-intestinal tract 
produced by bariatric surgery always require the adaptation of patients’ eating behaviour to 
the new gastro-intestinal physiology, and procedure-specific nutritional problems and 
symptoms may occur. The nutritional management of the post-bariatric patients requires 
therefore specific nutritional skills and the intervention of experienced nutritionists and 
dieticians. Detailed guidelines for post-operative bariatric nutritional management have 
been published  
[4, 5] 
 and recently updated  
[6] 
. In this section, first-level information about 
early, late and life-long nutritional management, protein intake and supplementation as well 
as specific nutritional problems is included. A short list of graded clinical practical recommen-
dations on nutritional management is reported in  
table 2 
. 
 
 
Early, Late and Life-Long Nutritional Management 
 
Most bariatric procedures include the reduction of the volume of the stomach and/or the 
creation of a small gastric pouch. Therefore, the ingestion of solid foods in the first days after 
surgery is impossible and a gradual change of food consistency in the first post-operative 
weeks is preferred in order to avoid or minimise regurgitation and vomiting, which can 
threaten the integrity and safety of the recent surgical procedure, and result in severe vitamin 
B1 (thiamine) deficiency  
[5] 
. A low-sugar clear liquid meal programme is usually initiated 
within 24 h of surgery, and patients are then instructed to gradually and progressively change 
the food consistency, moving from clear liquids to soft or creamy foods and then to solid

chewable items over a period of 2-4 weeks  
[4 
– 
6] 
. Patients should be trained to chew adequately 
and receive clear instruction about post-operative meal initiation and progression by an 
experienced bariatric dietician before discharge  
[6] 
. There are protocols for meal progression 
specific to most of the bariatric procedures  
[4] 
, but bariatric centres may design their own 
protocols taking into account personal and regional variations in food preferences.
 
 
After the end of the post-operative diet and thereafter, patients should receive periodic 
counselling by a registered dietician about long-term dietary modifications in order to 
maximize the results of the bariatric procedure and reduce the risk of late weight regain. 
Patients who received regular dietary counselling for the first 4 months after surgery achieved 
a slightly greater weight loss than patients who received standard post-operative care not 
involving counselling in a randomised trial, although the difference did not reach statistical 
significance  
[7] 
. Patients in the dietary counselling arm did report significant changes in 
several eating behaviours believed to be important for successful long-term weight mainte-
nance  
[7] 
. The focus of dietary counselling should be the adaptation of patients’ eating 
behaviour to the surgical procedure and the general qualitative aspects of a healthy nutrient-
dense diet. In particular, patients with gastric restriction should be counselled to eat three 
small meals during the day and chew small bites of food thoroughly before swallowing, 
without drinking beverages at the same time (more than 30 min apart)  
[4 
– 
6] 
. 
 
 
A positive relationship between physical activity levels and the amount of weight loss 
after bariatric surgery has been observed in several studies  
[8] 
, and regular physical activity 
is considered a critical factor for weight maintenance. Regular physical activity should 
therefore be encouraged after bariatric surgery, starting immediately after the recovery from

Regular physical activity should be encouraged after bariatric surgery, 
starting since after the recovery from surgery. Patients should be 
advised to incorporate moderate aerobic physical activity to include a 
minimum of 150 min/week and goal of 300 min/week, including 
strength training 2–3 times per week.

Nutritional counselling should address the problem of protein intake, 
particularly in the first months after surgery. A minimal protein intake 
of 60 g/day and up to 1.5 g/kg ideal body weight per day should be 
targeted. The use of liquid protein supplements (30 g/day) can facilitate 
adequate protein intake in the first period after surgery.

Nutritional manipulation should be the first line treatment for the

surgery. Patients should be advised to incorporate moderate aerobic physical activity, i.e., a 
minimum of 150 min/week (with a goal of 300 min/week) as well as strength training 2–3 
times/week  
[6] 
. 
 
 
Protein Intake and Protein Supplementation 
 
Sufficient protein intake is considered protective against the loss of lean body mass in 
any situation when a rapid weight loss occurs. However, protein intake is generally reduced 
following bariatric surgery  
[9] 
. A preference toward low-protein foods is common after all 
procedures having a restrictive component, particularly in the first months after surgery 
which is based on gastric intolerance to protein-rich foods  
[4] 
. Usually, most food intoler-
ances tend to diminish over time, and protein intake tends to increase, but protein intake may 
be lower than recommended in the first year after surgery, when most part of weight loss 
occurs. Therefore, dietary counselling should address the problem of protein intake, particu-
larly in the first months after surgery. Current guidelines suggest a minimal protein intake of 
60 g/day and up to 1.5 g/kg ideal body weight per day, but higher amounts of protein intake 
(up to 2.1 g/kg ideal body weight per day) may be required in individual cases  
[6] 
. The use of 
liquid protein supplements (30 g/day) can facilitate adequate protein intake in the first 
period after surgery. 
 
 
Bariatric procedures involving a certain degree of malabsorption can cause protein 
malnutrition. The incidence of protein malnutrition depends on the degree of the malab-
sorption as well as on the dietary habits and the protein requirements of the patients. A 13% 
incidence has been reported after distal Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with a Roux limb  
≥ 
 
150 cm  
[10] 
, but a much lower rate (<5%) has been reported after RYGB with a Roux limb < 
150 cm  
[11] 
. An incidence of protein malnutrition ranging from 3 to 18% has been reported 
after biliopancreatic diversion  
[4] 
. The occurrence of any pathologic (infections) or physio-
logic (pregnancy) state characterised by an increase of protein requirements may precipitate 
protein malnutrition in individual patients. Prevention of protein malnutrition involves 
regular assessment of protein intake, encouraging the ingestion of protein-rich foods (>60 
g/day) divided into several meals and the use of modular protein supplements  
[4] 
. Parenteral 
nutrition is mandatory in case of severe non-responsive protein malnutrition, and surgical 
revision with lengthening of the common channel to decrease malabsorption should be 
considered if a patient remains dependent on parenteral nutrition or has recurrent episodes 
of protein depletion  
[12] 
. 
 
 
Specific Nutritional Problems  
 
 
Food Intolerance, Vomiting and Regurgitation: 
 Food intolerances are common after any 
bariatric procedure involving a functional or anatomical reduction of the gastric volume. The 
foods most frequently involved are meat products, bread, rice and pasta. Failure of the patient 
to cope with the changes in eating behaviour requested by gastric restriction (rapid eating, 
insufficient chewing or drinking during meals) is frequently involved in causing food intoler-
ances. Food intolerances tend to diminish over time, but patients may remain intolerant to 
particular foods even in the long term. Educational support from an experienced dietician 
may help patients to acquire a better behavioural adaptation and/or to use alternative foods 
 
[7] 
. Food intolerances and behavioural errors may cause episodes of vomiting or food regur-
gitation during meals, frequently described by the patients as ‘spitting up’ or ‘food getting 
stuck’  
[4] 
. Such episodes are usually self-limiting, may occur occasionally in the first months 
after surgery and should be considered normal in a patient still adapting to his new gastric 
anatomy  
[4] 
. However, in case of persistent (>6 months) and/or frequent vomiting, a physical 
cause should be suspected and a surgical diagnostic work-up considered  
[4] 
. Persistent 
vomiting heavily disturbing normal eating and greatly reducing energy intake can precipitate

the onset of an acute state of thiamine deficiency that need to be considered and prevented 
(see below).
 
 
 
Diarrhoea and Steatorrhoea: 
 Disordered bowel habits are frequent after malabsorptive 
bariatric surgery, and patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch 
frequently reported intestinal symptoms that may impair quality of life or interfere with 
social functioning (increased number of bowel movements with loose stools or diarrhoea, 
faecal urgency, abdominal bloating and smelling flatulence)  
[ 13] 
. These symptoms are related 
to fat and carbohydrate malabsorption and to bacterial overgrowth. Dietary manipulation, 
with the avoidance of fatty or starch-rich foods, and the regular or intermittent use of intes-
tinal antibiotics (example: rifamixin 200–400 mg/bid for 7 days every month) may help.
 
 
 
Dumping Syndrome and Hypoglycaemia: 
 Dumping refers to the post-prandial occurrence 
of a constellation of symptoms elicited by the rapid transit of calorie-dense food to the small 
bowel. The symptoms may be non-specific, but a correct diagnosis is facilitated by the appli-
cation of the Sigstad’s score, a diagnostic tool based on weighing factors assigned to symptoms 
of the syndrome: a score index higher than 7 points is suggestive of dumping ( 
table 3 
)  
[14] 
. 
Dumping syndrome was believed to be typical of gastric bypass (70–75% of patients in the 
first year after surgery)  
[4] 
, but it has been described also after sleeve gastrectomy (40% of 
patients 6 months after surgery)  
[15] 
. Some authors suggested a possible role of dumping in 
determining weight loss after gastric bypass, through the negative conditioning for consuming 
energy-dense foods  
[16] 
, but this role has been questioned  
[17] 
. Dumping was classically 
attributed to a rapid increase in the osmolality of the intestinal content, with influx of fluid 
into the intestinal lumen, intestinal distention, fluid sequestration, decreased intravascular 
volume and hypotension  
[18] 
, but the changes in the secretion of gastro-intestinal hormones 
(GLP-1) described after bariatric surgery probably also play a role in the pathogenesis of the 
syndrome  
[19] 
. In clinical practice, symptoms of dumping syndrome can be classified as early 
or late, depending on how soon after food ingestion they occur: early symptoms occur about 
10–30 min after meal, whereas late symptoms occur 1–3 h after food ingestion  
[20] 
. Late 
dumping is strictly related to the occurrence of reactive hypoglycaemia and may be more 
linked to changes in gastro-intestinal hormones and insulin secretion  
[21, 22] 
. Nutritional 
manipulation is usually sufficient to control dumping. Nutritional tips comprise eating small 
but frequent meals, avoiding ingestion of liquids within 30 min of a solid-food meal, avoiding 
simple sugars, increasing intake of fibre and complex carbohydrates and increasing protein 
intake  
[4] 
. Late symptoms and reactive hypoglycaemia may be also prevented by drinking

half a glass of orange juice (or taking the equivalent small sugar supplement) about 1 h after 
eating  
[4] 
. Medical therapy has its role in patients who fail to be controlled with dietary modi-
fications. Several drugs have been described as beneficial in symptom control, but without 
consistent success. The effectiveness of octreotide, at the initial recommended dose of 25–50 
μg administered subcutaneously 2–3 times daily and 15–30 min before meals, in ameliorating 
symptoms of dumping is supported by several randomised trials  
[23] 
, and this drug may be 
therefore helpful in some patients  
[4] 
. However, in case of severe hypoglycaemic events with 
neuroglycopenic symptoms, alternative causes of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia 
(pancreatic beta-cells hyperplasia, insulinoma) should be considered and specific diagnostic 
algorithms have been proposed  
[24] 
.
 
Micronutrient Supplementation 
 
The occurrence of vitamin and mineral deficiencies is one of the most common and 
compelling problems after bariatric surgery. Prevention, detection and treatment of these 
deficiencies represent cornerstones of long-term follow-up in post-bariatric patients. In this 
section, first-level information about general and procedure-specific nutritional deficits, 
recommended micronutrient supplementation and nutritional follow-up is included. A short 
list of graded clinical practical recommendations on micronutrient supplementation is given 
in  
table 4 
.
 
 
General and Procedure-Specific Nutritional Deficits 
 
The anatomical characteristics and the mechanisms of action of the various procedures 
mostly dictate the frequency and severity of vitamin and mineral deficiencies after bariatric 
surgery ( 
table 5 
). Nutritional deficiencies are uncommon after purely gastric restrictive 
procedures not altering intestinal continuity and normal digestive processes, but more 
common after surgical procedures inducing some degree of malabsorption  
[4] 
. However, the 
occurrence of nutritional deficits is also influenced by factors independent from the surgical 
technique, such as regular and nutrient-dense food intake and adherence with post-operative 
vitamin and mineral supplementation. Clinical, socio-economic and psychological factors

Long-term mineral and multivitamin supplementation should be

recommended  and supplementation should be individualized 
accordingly, with patients with demonstrated micronutrient 
deficiencies treated with the respective micronutrient.

may therefore play a role  
[5] 
. Detailed descriptions of vitamin and mineral deficiencies that 
may be encountered after bariatric surgery, their symptoms and consequences, and the 
rationale for vitamin supplementation have already been published  
[4–6, 25] 
.
 
 
 
Iron: 
 Iron deficiency with or without anaemia is common after gastric bypass, biliopan-
creatic diversion and duodenal switch  
[4] 
, but it occurs also after sleeve gastrectomy  
[26] 
 and 
more rarely after adjustable gastric banding  
[5, 25] 
. Menstruating women are more frequently 
affected  
[4] 
. Several factors play a role in causing iron deficiency after bariatric surgery. First, 
iron absorption occurs mostly in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, the gut sections that 
are bypassed in some procedures. Second, decreased acid production in the stomach and 
accelerated gastric emptying impair the reduction of iron from the ferric (Fe 
3+ 
) to the 
absorbable ferrous state (Fe 
2+ 
). Third, the intake of iron-rich foods (meats, enriched grains 
and vegetables) is frequently low. Finally the absorption of iron may be inhibited by inter-
action with other nutritional supplements (calcium)  
[4, 5] 
. Prophylactic empiric iron supple-
mentation is recommended after gastric bypass, biliopancreatic diversion, duodenal switch 
and sleeve gastrectomy  
[4, 5] 
. Iron is usually included in oral multivitamin and mineral prep-
arations with the inclusion of vitamin C, that is able to increase iron absorption  
[4] 
 ; they 
should not be taken along together with calcium supplements. 
 
 
 
Vitamin B12: 
 Cobalamin deficiency occurs after surgical procedures (gastric bypass and 
sleeve gastrectomy) that cause a decreased acid production in the stomach and a reduced 
availability of intrinsic factor (IF)  
[4, 26] 
. Cobalamin stores are usually high and vitamin B12 
deficiency is therefore rare in the first year after surgery, but tends to increase with time  
[4]

Despite the absence of evidence-based recommendations, vitamin B12 supplementation is 
usually recommended after gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, biliopancreatic diversion and 
duodenal switch  
[4] 
. Absorption of vitamin B12 mostly requires the presence of IF, but 
approximately 1% of oral vitamin B12 is passively absorbed even without IF

. Therefore,

an oral dose of 350–500 μg/day is considered sufficient to guarantee the absorption of the 
daily vitamin B12 requirement  
[5, 25] 
. Alternatively suggested regimens of administration 
are 1 mg/month intramuscularly, 3 mg every 6 months intramuscularly or 500 μg every week 
intranasally  
[4] 
. 
 
 
 
Folic Acid:  
Folate deficiency is uncommon after bariatric surgery because folate absorption 
occurs throughout the entire small bowel  
[4] 
. Anyway, folic acid is usually contained in the 
multivitamin and mineral supplements routinely used in bariatric patients. 
 
 
 
Calcium and Vitamin D: 
 Calcium absorption occurs preferentially in the duodenum and 
proximal jejunum and is facilitated by vitamin D in an acid environment. Calcium absorption 
would therefore decrease after any bariatric procedure involving a bypass of the first intes-
tinal loops, reducing gastric acid production and lowering vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is a fat-
soluble vitamin absorbed preferentially in the jejunum and ileum. Therefore, a high incidence 
of vitamin D deficiency (50–60% of the patients) despite routine supplementation has been 
reported after biliopancreatic diversion  
[27, 28] 
, gastric bypass  
[29] 
 and omega-loop gastric 
bypass  
[30] 
. No significant decreases in vitamin D levels have been observed after sleeve 
gastrectomy  
[26] 
 or adjustable gastric banding  
[31] 
. The most important consequence of 
coupled calcium and vitamin D deficiencies is bone demineralisation. Therefore, even in the 
absence of conclusive evidence concerning the long-term risk of fractures after bariatric 
surgery, calcium and vitamin D routine supplementation is strongly recommended after 
gastric bypass and malabsorptive procedures  
[4–6, 25] 
. Obese patients frequently present 
vitamin D deficiency at baseline; this deficiency should be corrected before surgery with an 
oral vitamin D load  
[5] 
. After surgery, the regular consumption of 1,200–2,000 mg/day of 
elemental calcium along with 400–800 U of vitamin D is recommended  
[4] 
. Calcium citrate 
should be preferred to calcium carbonate because it is better absorbed in the absence of 
gastric acid  
[5] 
. This standard supplementation is frequently insufficient to maintain suffi-
cient vitamin D levels in patients with malabsorption, and much higher oral or parenteral 
doses may be required. Therefore, the adequacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation 
should be checked in any patients, with regular controls of markers of bone mineral metab-
olism. Supplementation may be considered adequate when levels for serum calcium, bone-
specific alkaline phosphatase or osteocalcin, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 
24-hour urinary calcium excretion rates are normal  
[4, 5] 
. Persistently elevated serum PTH 
levels in the presence of normal vitamin D and inappropriately high serum calcium levels 
should raise the suspect of a primary hyperparathyroidism. In post-bariatric patients with 
established osteoporosis pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates may be considered. 
Before starting bisphosphonate treatment, vitamin D deficiency needs to be fully corrected 
in order to avoid severe hypocalcaemia, hypophosphatemia, and osteomalacia  
[4] 
. Intra-
venous bisphosphonates are the preferred choice because of concerns about low absorption 
and potential risk of anastomotic ulcer with oral bisphosphonates  
[6] 
. Recommended intra-
venous drugs were zoledronate (5 mg once a year) or ibandronate (3 mg every 3 months), 
whereas oral bisphosphonates were alendronate (70 mg/week), risedronate (35 mg/week 
or 150 mg/month) and ibandronate (150 mg/month)  
[6] 
. The effectiveness of both intra-
venous and oral bisphosphonates in improving bone mineralisation has never been proved 
specifically in bariatric patients. 
 
 
 
Fat-Soluble Vitamins: 
 The absorption of any fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, K, D) is reduced 
after bariatric procedures causing fat malabsorption and steatorrhoea (biliopancreatic 
diversion and duodenal switch). Vitamin A deficiency can cause ocular xerosis and night 
blindness. Vitamin E deficiency can lead to anaemia, ophthalmoplegia and peripheral 
neuropathy. Vitamin K deficiency can cause easy bleeding. The combined prevalence of these 
deficiencies is high after malabsorptive procedures  
[4] 
, and therefore routine fat-soluble

vitamin supplementation is recommended in all patients having undergone biliopancreatic 
diversion or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch  
[4] 
. 
 
 
 
Thiamine: 
 The human body has a low storage capacity for the water-soluble vitamin 
thiamine (vitamin B1) and can become rapidly devoid without regular and sufficient intake. 
Therefore, a short period of persistent vomiting impairing regular food intake can precipitate 
thiamine deficiency  
[5, 25] 
. Symptomatic thiamine deficiency has been described after a few 
weeks of intractable vomiting after any bariatric procedure, usually as a consequence of 
mechanical problems such as stoma stenosis after gastric bypass  
[32] 
, excessive band 
tightness or band slippage after gastric banding  
[33] 
 and stomach oedema with impaired 
nutrition after sleeve gastrectomy  
[34] 
. Cases of thiamine deficiencies have been reported 
also after biliopancreatic diversion  
[35] 
. Peripheral neuropathy or Wernicke’s encepha-
lopathy and Korsakoff’s psychoses are the typical manifestations of thiamine deficiency  
[5] 
. 
These neurologic symptoms are rapidly aggravating and may cause permanent neurologic 
deficits. Therefore, oral or parenteral thiamine supplementation (50–100 mg/day) should 
promptly be considered and started in every bariatric patient suffering from persistent 
vomiting severe enough to interfere with regular nutrition, even in the absence or before 
obtaining confirmatory laboratory data  
[4, 5] 
. In symptomatic patients, oral supplementation 
may be used only after 1–2 weeks of parenteral administration (100 mg/day) and continued 
until symptom resolution  
[4] 
. In case of severe malnutrition with the need for nutrition 
support, refeeding syndrome should be considered and fluid and electrolyte status should be 
monitored  
[36] 
.
 
 
 
Other Micronutrients:  
Other minerals (zinc, copper, selenium, magnesium, potassium) 
and vitamin (B6) deficiencies have been described after bariatric surgeries  
[4, 5, 25] 
. Routine 
supplementation with multivitamins and minerals is usually sufficient to prevent clinical 
problems. If higher doses of single trace elements are needed, timing of administration of 
these micronutrients should be considered due to the possible interference between elements 
for intestinal absorption (zinc and iron in particular)  
[37, 38] 
.
 
 
Micronutrient Supplementation and Nutritional Follow-Up 
 
Suggested daily supplementation for patients with gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy 
includes two adult multivitamin plus mineral supplements (containing iron, folic acid and 
thiamine), 1,200–1,500 mg of elemental calcium (in diet and as citrated supplement in divided 
doses), at least 3,000 IU of vitamin D (titrated to therapeutic 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels >30 
ng/ml), and vitamin B12 titrated to maintain normal levels  
[6] 
. Routine supplementation 
with adequate amounts of fat-soluble vitamins should be added to this regimen after bilio-
pancreatic diversion or duodenal switch  
[4] 
. In case of gastric banding, the suggested daily 
supplementation may be reduced to adult multivitamin plus mineral supplement and at least 
3,000 IU of vitamin D (titrated to vitamin D levels) with or without 1,200–1,500 mg of 
elemental calcium (in diet and as citrated supplement in divided doses)  
[6] 
. 
 
 
Routine supplementation does not ensure an absolute prevention of deficiencies over 
time, mainly because of individual variations in micronutrient absorption, nutritional require-
ments and compliance. Therefore, periodic laboratory routine surveillance for nutritional 
deficiencies is recommended, and supplementation should be individualised accordingly in 
patients with demonstrated micronutrient insufficiencies or deficiencies   
[6] 
. A reasonable 
scheme for minimal periodic nutritional surveillance after bariatric procedures is proposed 
in  
table 6 
  
[39] 
. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) should be performed before surgery 
and bi-annually thereafter to monitor bone mineral density in patients with gastric bypass, 
biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch  
[6] 
. However, the possibility to perform DEXA 
and its reliability before surgery may be risky in very obese patients.

Management of Co-Morbidities 
 
Bariatric surgery has profound effects on obesity-related co-morbidities. These effects 
are in general positive, but they can occur very rapidly, requiring prompt modifications and 
adjustments of medical therapy. Moreover, the status of co-morbidities and their evolution 
should be monitored both in the short and in the long term after surgery. In this section, first-
level information about post-surgical management of type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep 
apnoea (OSA), dyslipidaemia and hypertension is included. A short list of graded clinical prac-
tical recommendations on management of co-morbidities after bariatric surgery is reported 
in  
table 7 
.
 
 
Type 2 Diabetes 
 
According to the latest IFSO Global Registry Report, 22% of patients undergoing bariatric 
surgery were on medications for type 2 diabetes before surgery (inter-country variation 
7.4–63.2%)  
[40] 
. Bariatric surgery has been shown to improve metabolic status and to reduce 
micro- and macrovascular complications and cardiovascular deaths in patients with type 2 
diabetes  
[1, 41–43] 
. On the other hand, poor pre-operative glucose control can lead to an 
increased risk of peri-operative complications  
[6] 
, and some studies suggest that optimal 
glucose control prior to surgery may improve the chances of diabetes remission after surgery 
 
[44] 
. Moreover, higher post-operative glucose levels can lead to increased morbidity  
[45] 
. 
Therefore, good blood glucose control pre- and post-bariatric surgery is highly recommended. 
In general, caution should be the guide in treatment, with close follow-up of glucose levels 
before and immediately after surgery, until eating habits and food intake stabilise. This is due

comorbidities after bariatric surgery
Recommendations

evidence
Grade of 
recommendation*
Type 2 diabetes
Bariatric surgery has profound effects on diabetes and can lead to 
prompt modifications and adjustments of medical therapy.
1
A
Metabolic control should be optimized in preparation for a bariatric 
procedure. HbA1c levels of 6.5–7%, fasting glucose levels <110 mg/dl 
and 2 h post-load glucose <140 mg/dl should be targeted. In patients 
with long lasting diabetes, diabetes complications and poor glucose 
control, HbA1c levels <8% are considered acceptable. 
2
C
Glitazones, glinides and dipeptidyl-dipeptidase 4 inhibitors (DDP4i) 
should be discontinued 24 h before surgery with a reduction of basal 
insulin dosage to 0.3 units/kg. Metformin should be discontinued on 
the day of surgery.
3
D
On the day of surgery, glucose levels should be targeted at <140 mg/dl 
and short acting insulin should be used according to a correction 
factor of one unit of insulin for every 40 mg/dl above the level of 140 
mg/dl. 
3
D
In hospital, target glucose values should be 140–180 mg/dl. if values 
are >180 mg/dl in two consecutive tests basal insulin at a dose of 0.1 
units/kg should be prescribed. 
3
D
Metformin can be reassumed from the 3rd day after surgery providing 
that renal function has been controlled at a dosage of 850 mg, 1–2 
times daily. After gastric bypass surgery, biological availability of 
metformin increases by 50%, and therefore reduced dosages should 
be prescribed. 
3
D
In the first 7–10 days after surgery, treatment should be directed 
toward fasting glucose values and patients should be instructed to test 
sugar at least twice a day fast in the morning (target values: 100-120 
mg/dl) and during the day (less than 180 mg/dl 2 h after a meal). 
3
D
In the first 7–10 days after surgery, use of sulfonylureas and 
medications that increase the risk of hypoglycaemia should be 
avoided.
3
D
For patients still requiring insulin during their post-operative hospital 
staying, basal insulin should be continued at discharge, with strict 
glucose monitoring and tapering of insulin units for avoidance of 
hypoglycaemia.
3
D
In cases of complicated glucose control in the early post-operative 
phase, consultation with an endocrinologist should be considered.  
3
D
After the first early post-operative period, standard diabetes 
guidelines should be followed for the management of patients still 
requiring pharmacologic anti-diabetic treatment after bariatric 
surgery.

to the fear of hypoglycaemia on one hand, and to the risk of poor glucose control on the other. 
The guidelines detailed below can direct medical treatment. However, individual consider-
ations and follow-up are needed for each patient.
 
 
 
Pre-Operative Glucose Control:  
Ideally, metabolic control should be optimised in patients 
with obesity and type 2 diabetes in preparation for a bariatric procedure. HbA1c levels of 
6.5–7%, fasting glucose levels <110 mg/dl and 2-hour post-load glucose < 140 mg/dl should 
be targeted. In patients with long lasting diabetes, diabetes complications and poor glucose 
control, HbA1c levels < 8% are considered acceptable, but levels > 8% calls for clinical 
judgement regarding pre-operative medical treatment  
[6] 
. For patients treated with a low-
calorie diet before surgery, cessation of sulfonylureas and GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduction 
of basal insulin by half and reduction or cessation in the usage of short-acting insulin should 
be considered, with strict follow-up of glucose levels  
[46] 
.
 
 
 
Peri-Operative Diabetes Management: 
 Glitazones, glinides and dipeptidyl-dipeptidase 4 
inhibitors (DDP4i) should be discontinued 24 h before surgery, with a reduction of basal 
insulin dosage to 0.3 U/kg of body weight. The continuation of the regular medications on the 
day before surgery with a reduction of basal insulin dosage to 0.3 U/kg of body weight can be 
also considered  
[47] 
. Metformin should be discontinued on the day of surgery. On the day of

Obstructive sleep apnoea 
Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea should continue CPAP or 
BiPAP therapy immediately after surgery and for 3–6 months post-
surgery. Thereafter, patients should be reviewed by the respiratory 
physician in order to determine whether the BiPAP/CPAP pressures 
need to be adjusted and if a new sleep-respiratory assessment should 
be undertaken.
4
D
Dyslipidaemia
Lipid-lowering medications should not be stopped after surgery 
unless clearly indicated. Patients with dyslipidaemia and on lipid-
modifying medications should be have lipid profiles and 
cardiovascular risk status reassessed periodically.
4
D
Hypertension
In the first week after surgery, blood pressure tends to go down and 
should be monitored actively, with prompt  adjustment of blood 
pressure medications to the new therapeutic needs. Avoidance of 
diuretics may be suggested in this phase for the high risk of 
dehydration. 
4
D
Continued surveillance of blood pressure is needed after surgery, 
because of the high risk of recurrence over time. Treatment of 
hypertension in the long-term should adhere to current general 
guidelines, possibly avoiding anti-hypertensive medications with a 
known unfavourable effect on body weight. In the patients in whom 
hypertension have resolved, continued surveillance should be guided 
by recommended screening guidelines for the specific age group.

surgery, glucose levels should be targeted at <140 mg/dl and short-acting insulin should be 
used according to a correction factor of one unit of insulin for every 40 mg/dl above the level 
of 140 mg/dl. From the day following the operation until discharge from the hospital, similar 
to the routine treatment for a hospitalised patient, target glucose values should be 140–180 
mg/dl with basal insulin at a dose of 0.1 U/kg prescribed if values are above 180 mg/dl in two 
consecutive determinations  
[48] 
. In cases of complicated glucose control, consultation of an 
endocrinologist should be considered. 
 
 
 
Early Post-Operative Management (7–10 Days after Surgery):  
During this period, patients 
are required to consume fluids, and the caloric intake is minimal. Therefore, in most cases, 
glycaemic peaks after meals are reduced considerably. For this reason, treatment is directed 
predominantly toward fasting glucose values. Patients should be instructed to test blood 
glucose at least twice a day: in fast in the morning and during the day, with target values of 
100–120 mg/dl in fast and less than 180 mg/dl 2 h after a meal  
[47] 
. For patients who were 
treated with oral diabetes medications prior to surgery and who did not need these medica-
tions post-operatively, due to normal glucose levels, glucose control can be followed without 
medical treatment. If glucose levels are consistently high post-operatively, also after weight 
reduction, treatment should be adjusted again, with the treatment of choice being metformin 
 
[47] 
. After surgery, the use of sulfonylureas and medications that increase insulin secretion 
should be avoided due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia  
[6] 
. Metformin can safely be 
administered again from the 3rd day after surgery providing that renal function has been 
controlled at a dosage of 850 mg, 1–2 times daily  
[47] 
. After gastric bypass surgery, biological 
availability of metformin increases by 50%, and therefore reduced dosages should be 
prescribed. In cases of intolerance to metformin, low dosages of basal insulin can be recom-
mended. Whenever the blood glucose control during the early post-surgical period is difficult, 
a combination of low-dose basal insulin and DPP4 inhibitors can be considered, as a response 
to post-prandial glucose levels and taking into account renal function. For patients still 
requiring insulin during their post-operative hospitalisation, basal insulin should be continued 
at discharge, with strict glucose monitoring and tapering of insulin units to avoid hypogly-
caemia. A simple scheme for prescription of the basal insulin dosage at discharge according 
to the basal insulin needs during hospitalisation is presented in  
table 8 
, but alternative 
regimens can be used with emphasis on patients’ education and self-monitoring. For patients 
who need higher dosages of insulin during post-surgical hospitalisation, a prescription of 2–3 
U of short-acting insulin around the three main meals should be considered. Due to the 
complexity of diabetes treatment in these patients, treatment should be assessed and adjusted 
at 7–10 days after surgery by an experienced physician. In general, caution should be taken 
to avoid hypoglycaemia in these patients, especially during the night; therefore, insulin 
dosages should be as low as possible and corrected as necessary.

Long-Term Post-Operative Diabetes Management:  
After the first early post-operative 
period, standard diabetes guidelines should be followed in the management of patients still 
requiring pharmacologic anti-diabetic treatment after bariatric surgery. For patients in good 
metabolic control and not requiring glucose-lowering medications after surgery (complete 
diabetes remission), treatment goals for co-morbid conditions and screening for microvas-
cular complications should be the same as those for patients with diabetes  
[49] 
. With 
prolonged remission (>5 years), treatment goals appropriate for patients without diabetes 
can be considered, as long as there is no recurrence of diabetes and no cardiovascular disease, 
and screening at a reduced frequency depending on the status of each complication. With 
prolonged remission, screening for a particular complication should be completely stopped 
only in absence of that complication  
[49] 
. 
 
 
OSA 
 
 
Definitions and Diagnosis of OSA:  
OSA is a common sleep-related breathing disorder 
caused by nocturnal upper airway obstruction, resulting in arterial hypoxia and sleep frag-
mentation. The major risk factors for OSA are obesity, older age and male gender. Individuals 
suffering from OSA have increased risk of several adverse health outcomes, including all-
cause mortality, traffic accidents, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, 
arrhythmia, heart failure and stroke  
[50–53] 
. The apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the 
number of complete cessations (apnoea  
≥ 
 10 s) and partial obstructions (hypopneas) of 
breathing occurring per hour of sleep. OSA is defined as an AHI of at least 5 events/h. An AHI 
of  
≥ 
5 to <15 events/h is defined as mild OSA, of  
≥ 
15 to <30 events/h as moderate OSA and of 
 
≥ 
30 events/h as severe OSA  
[50] 
. Polysomnography, the gold standard method to diagnose 
OSA, provides detailed information on sleep and respiratory and gas exchange abnormalities 
 
[50] 
. However, less resource-intensive and validated methods such as home-based sleep 
monitors may be suitable for clinical practice  
[54] 
. Snoring is the most frequent night time 
symptom of OSA, but it has poor predictive value because snoring without OSA is common in 
the general population. Other nocturnal symptoms are choking or gasping, frequent arousals, 
nocturia and excessive sweating  
[50] 
. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a commonly reported 
symptom, which can lead to accidents and poor quality of life. Other daytime symptoms 
include increased appetite, memory impairment, personality changes, irritability, morning 
headache, anxiety and depression  
[50] 
.
 
 
 
Prevalence among Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery:  
OSA is underdiagnosed and 
probably the most common co-morbidity among patients preparing for obesity surgery  
[53, 
55, 56] 
. Although the literature is sparse, approximately 2 out of 3 patients undergoing sleep 
registration before surgery have OSA, of which 2 out of 3 have moderate or severe OSA 
requiring specific treatment  
[53, 55, 56] 
. A recently published large Dutch cohort study 
demonstrated that approximately one-third of 1,358 consecutive patients preparing for 
bariatric surgery had moderate to severe OSA (AHI  
≥ 
 15/h)  
[56] 
. 
 
 
 
Management:  
Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mandibular 
advancement devices (MADs) is usually indicated in patients with moderate to severe OSA 
and in those with mild OSA and clinical symptoms. CPAP treatment is associated with signif-
icant improvements in OSA-related symptoms  
[50] 
. However, common adverse effects of 
CPAP and MADs include oral or nasal dryness, irritation and pain  
[50] 
. CPAP treatment might 
also be insufficient or not tolerated by some patients with concurrent chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and daytime hypercapnia and/or nocturnal hypoxia. These 
patients suffer from a COPD-OSA overlap syndrome and may benefit from bi-level positive 
airway pressure (BiPAP) treatment  
[57] 
. BiPAP treatment might also an effective therapeutic 
alternative for CPAP in patients not responsive or intolerant to CPAP  
[58]

obesity, weight loss is the most important alternative treatment for OSA. A recent review and

meta-analysis demonstrated that obesity surgery was followed, on average, by a large 
reduction in AHI (29 events/h; 95% CI 22–37 events/h)  
[59] 
. However, although bariatric 
surgery significantly ameliorates OSA, it does not completely resolve the disease in all patients. 
A recent Dutch observational study of 205 patients undergoing gastric bypass with moderate 
to severe obesity before surgery revealed that approximately three-quarters of the patients 
with moderate to severe OSA before surgery had no or mild OSA after surgery, whilst one out 
of four still had moderate to severe OSA  
[60] 
. The strongest predictor of lack of remission was 
a pre-operative AHI  
≥ 
 30/h (OR 5.7; 95% CI 2.4–13.2). Further, weight regain and increasing 
age may lead to worsening of symptoms and need of additional treatment (e.g. CPAP) during 
the years following surgery.
 
 
 
Follow-Up of OSA after Bariatric Surgery:  
Health providers should pay particular attention 
to patients in whom OSA had been diagnosed before surgery. Although weight loss amelio-
rates symptoms in the majority of patients, many patients still have symptoms and need 
supplementary treatment with CPAP or MADs. In addition, increasing age and weight regain 
increase the risk of relapse or new-onset OSA. Accordingly, weight stabilisation after surgery 
is also important to prevent OSA or worsening of OSA. Recent guidelines suggest that patients 
with known OSA should bring their CPAP or BiPAP devices with them for surgery and continue 
to use it for 3–6 months post-surgery  
[61] 
. Thereafter, patients should be reviewed by the 
respiratory physician in order to determine whether the BiPAP /CPAP pressures need to be 
adjusted and if a new sleep respiratory assessment should be undertaken.
 
 
Dyslipidaemia 
 
 
Dyslipidaemia and Bariatric Surgery: 
 Dyslipidaemias are defined as abnormalities in the 
serum levels of lipids including high total cholesterol, high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol 
and elevated LDL-cholesterol  
[62] 
. Furthermore, most patients undergoing bariatric surgery 
have insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes and therefore present 
with a lipid profile characterized by increased levels of atherogenic small-dense LDL particles 
 
[63, 64] 
. Importantly, while lowering LDL-cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of cardio-
vascular disease, it remains unclear whether treatment of high triglyceride level and low HDL-
cholesterol improves cardiovascular outcomes  
[64] 
. Weight loss has beneficial effects on lipids 
and amplifies the benefits of dietary treatment, resulting in a 20% decrease in triglycerides, a 
15% reduction in LDL-cholesterol and an 8–10% increase in HDL-cholesterol  
[65] 
. Therefore, 
the large reduction in body fat mass after bariatric surgery leads to beneficial changes in serum 
lipids (total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides), with the greater 
the body weight loss, the greater the improvement in dyslipidaemia  
[66, 67] 
. Moreover, 
bariatric surgery may affect serum lipids by alternative mechanisms, including alteration of 
lipid metabolism, gastro-intestinal lipid absorption, bile acid metabolism, gut microbiota and 
gut hormones  
[66, 67] 
. Some bariatric procedures augment the beneficial effects of weight loss 
by reducing the absorption of cholesterol. Apparently only RYGB, but not gastric banding  
[68] 
 
or gastric sleeve gastrectomy  
[69] 
, is associated with reduced absorption of cholesterol. A 
recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that LDL-cholesterol was reduced 
significantly after gastric bypass (0.64 mmol/l) and biliopancreatic diversion (1.17 mmol/l), 
while the LDL-lowering effects of gastric banding (0.23 mmol/l) and sleeve gastrectomy (0.20 
mmol/l) were small or non-significant  
[70] 
. To conclude, the beneficial effect of bariatric 
surgery on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels seems to be weight loss-dependent while 
the improvement in LDL-cholesterol levels after gastric bypass surgery is at least partly weight 
loss-independent. RYGB may influence lipid levels also by decreasing dietary preference for 
high-fat and increases preference for low-fat food  
[71] 
, although a very small proportion of 
patients undergoing RYGB in a controlled clinical study fulfilled the recommendation of less 
than 10% of energy intake from saturated fat after surgery  
[72] 
.

Surveillance and Treatment of Dyslipidaemia after Bariatric Surgery: 
 On average, serum 
total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides decline during the first 
6 weeks after gastric bypass  
[66, 73] 
. Several studies demonstrated that the LDL-cholesterol 
and triglyceride levels were reduced until 1 year and then stabilized in parallel with the 
period of maximum weight loss (1–2 years), while HDL-cholesterol increases from 6 weeks 
to 1–2 years above the baseline level  
[66, 73] 
. In general, the proportion of patients taking 
lipid-lowering drugs after bariatric surgery tends to reduce  
[74] 
. Schauer et al.  
[75] 
 reported 
that the number of patients receiving lipid-lowering agents decreased from 86% to 27% 1 
year after RYGB. Although bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvement of 
several cardiovascular risk factors, a large proportion of patients undergoing bariatric surgery 
may remain at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, regular monitoring of serum 
lipids and therapeutic strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease are recommended  
[6, 61, 
64] 
. Recent guidelines underscore that the effect of weight loss on dyslipidaemia is variable 
and incomplete; therefore, lipid-lowering medications should not be stopped unless clearly 
indicated  
[6] 
, and patients with dyslipidaemia and on lipid-modifying medications should be 
re-assessed by performing fasting lipid profiles periodically, including re-assessment of 
cardiovascular risk status  
[61] 
. The European Society of Cardiology and European Athero-
sclerosis Society recently published guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias, 
including practical evidence-based advices that may be helpful for bariatric physicians  
[64] 
. 
According to the guidelines, the LDL-cholesterol goal is <2.6 mmol/l in high-risk patients and 
<3.0 mmol/l in people with moderate total cardiovascular risk  
[64] 
. To reach these goals, 
weight stabilisation after weight loss and healthy nutrition are of major importance. However, 
treatment with statins should be initiated if treatment targets are not met on lifestyle inter-
vention  
[64] 
. Since the long-term effect of bariatric surgery on the absorption and pharmaco-
kinetics of statins is largely unknown  
[76] 
, patients on statins should be treated with the 
lowest dose possible while monitoring the plasma lipid profile  
[76, 77] 
. One of the few studies 
addressing this issue demonstrated that the systemic exposure of atorvastatin showed a 
significant change over time after bariatric surgery, albeit with large inter- and intra-indi-
vidual variations. The findings indicate that patients using atorvastatin or drugs with similar 
pharmacokinetic properties should be monitored closely for both therapeutic effects and 
adverse events during the first years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch  
[77] 
.
 
 
Hypertension 
 
 
Surveillance and Treatment of Hypertension after Bariatric Surgery: 
 According to a large 
meta-analysis of surgical series, about one-third (35.4%) of patients undergoing bariatric 
surgery presented with hypertension before the procedure  
[41] 
. On the short term, weight 
loss following bariatric surgery was associated with a significant improvement of hyper-
tension  
[41] 
. In the long term, results seem to be less brilliant, with some patients having 
recurrence of hypertension over time  
[1] 
. Therefore, lowering of blood pressure medications 
is frequently needed in the first period after surgery, when blood pressure tends to go down, 
but continued surveillance of blood pressure is also needed because of the high risk of recur-
rence over time. In the first week after surgery, blood pressure should be monitored actively, 
and blood pressure medications should be adjusted to the new therapeutic needs. Avoidance 
of diuretics may be suggested in this phase due to the high risk of dehydration. Treatment of 
hypertension in the long term should adhere to current general guidelines, possibly avoiding 
anti-hypertensive medications with a known unfavourable effect on body weight  
[78] 
. In 
patients in whom hypertension have resolved, continued surveillance should be guided by 
recommended screening guidelines for the specific age group  
[4] 
.

Pharmacotherapy after Bariatric Surgery 
 
Bariatric surgeries induce substantial anatomical and physiological changes in the gastro-
intestinal tract and elsewhere, any one of which may affect drug pharmacokinetics in different 
directions. Absorption of drugs is predominantly affected, but also tissue distribution, drug 
metabolism and elimination may change. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle the specific 
effects of surgery and weight loss on bioavailability of the drugs, and it is important to note 
that there are not only important differences in the effects of different procedures but also 
considerable inter- and even intra-individual variations in drug absorption over time. This 
complex challenge is currently unmet by the limited data that exists on this subject  
[79] 
. 
There is an urgent need for further in vitro, in vivo and clinical research in order to under-
stand the effects of bariatric surgeries on drug pharmacokinetics and the mechanisms that 
underlie these processes. In the meantime, awareness to this important issue must be instilled 
to medical professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses and dieticians. Patients 
should be closely monitored in order to evaluate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy 
of their drug regimen. In this section, first-level information about pharmacotherapy after 
bariatric surgery is included, and a short list of related graded clinical practical recommenda-
tions is reported in  
table 9 
.
 
 
Practical Recommendations for Pharmacotherapy after Bariatric Surgery 
 
The potential effects and consequences that any bariatric procedure may have on 
absorption and action of medications should be carefully considered before surgery, espe-
cially for medications where changes in blood levels may have critical effects on patients’ 
conditions or can cause significant adverse events, e.g. anticoagulants, anti-epileptics, drugs 
for Parkinson’s disease, drugs for autoimmune conditions etc.  
[79] 
. 
  
After surgery, plasma 
drug levels should be checked more frequently for those drugs requiring periodic plasma 
level control  
[79] 
. When discharged from the hospital, patients should be carefully instructed 
on the modifications of their medication regimen, including changes in prescription drugs,

over-the-counter drugs, nutrient supplements and homeopathic drugs. Involvement of phar-
macists as advisors in the drug treatment is beneficial for both surgeons and patients  
[80] 
. If 
possible, oral liquid-dosage forms should be used instead of solid-dosage forms for at least 2 
months after surgery. However, it is important to ensure that the liquid-dosage form does not 
contain absorbable sugars, in light of the risk for dumping syndrome  
[81] 
. Alternatively, 
non-oral formulations can be used. In cases where only solid-dosage formulations of the drug 
exist, it may be considered to open the pills and spread the powder in liquid prior to ingestion, 
but only according to package insert or available company data. It is worthwhile to note that 
caution should be taken with extended-release dosage forms because quite often they cannot 
be crushed. Anti-diabetics drugs with a high risk of hypoglycaemia, such as sulfonylureas and 
glinides, should be discontinued, and insulin doses should be adjusted. Metformin may be 
continued until normal glucose levels are achieved and maintained  
[6] 
, but metformin doses 
may need to be reduced due to increased absorption  
[82] 
 (see  
‘Type 2 Diabetes’  
above 
) 
. 
Caution should be applied when administering diuretics post-operatively, as the combined 
diuretic effect of the drugs and the operation may cause dehydration  
[83] 
. NSAIDs, salicylates, 
corticosteroids and other drugs that may cause gastric damage should be avoided  
[84, 85] 
. 
Oral contraceptives should be replaced by non-oral contraceptives due to reduced efficacy 
after gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion. However, contraceptive patches may be 
less effective in patients with obesity, and caution with the use of contraceptive agents is 
necessary after all bariatric surgeries  
[6, 86] 
. Patients that underwent bariatric surgery are 
more likely to develop gallstones. Hence, drugs that increase the risk for the formation of gall-
stones, such as gemfibrozil or octreotide, should be avoided  
[87] 
. Special attention should be 
paid to drugs that require acidic environment or food in order to be adequately absorbed, 
such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and selegiline  
[79] 
. Finally, nutrient supplements (iron, 
calcium and multivitamins) are regularly prescribed in patients that underwent bariatric 
surgeries in order to prevent deficiencies, but they can raise the risk for drug-nutrient inter-
actions and decrease the absorption of some drugs  
[79] 
. 
 
Pregnancy after Bariatric Surgery 
 
The majority of patients undergoing bariatric surgery are women, and up to 80% of 
women are of child-bearing age. Obesity per se is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension and long-
term vascular dysfunction, miscarriages, preeclampsia, thromboembolism, intrauterine 
growth restriction (IUGR) and post-partum haemorrhage  
[88, 89] 
. In addition, the rate of 
caesarean sections, co-morbidities and failure of epidural analgesia augment with increasing 
BMI, with the risk being particularly high in obesity class III pregnant women (BMI > 40 
kg/m 
2 
)  
[88] 
. Pre-pregnancy obesity is also associated with increased health risks for the 
offspring, such as foetal defects, congenital anomalies, pre-mature birth, stillbirth, large for 
gestational age (LGA) and shoulder dystocia  
[88] 
. Furthermore, obesity is associated with 
menstrual cycle dysregulation, anovulation and infertility; fertility and conception hence 
constitute major motivators for women with obesity and associated infertility to undergo 
bariatric surgery  
[90, 91] 
. 
 
 
Weight loss following bariatric surgery leads to improved sex hormone profiles and 
improvement of metabolic and hormonal changes associated with polycystic ovarian 
syndrome (PCOS), thereby increasing fertility  
[92–94] 
. For instance, Legro et al.  
[93] 
 demon-
strated follicular phase shortening, reduction in android fat and improved female sexual 
function in women post-RYGB. A study looking at PCOS following RYGB demonstrated 
improvements in hirsutism, type 2 diabetes mellitus and fertility  
[94] 
. Following bariatric

surgery, fertility can rapidly improve, even in previously anovulatory women  
[95] 
. A study 
following up women after various bariatric procedures (intragastric balloon, gastric banding, 
sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB) reported that the amount of weight loss and BMI were the key 
determinants of fertility, rather than procedure type  
[96] 
. Hence, pregnancy after bariatric 
surgery is not rare. In this section, first-level information on pregnancy after bariatric surgery 
is included. A short list of graded clinical practical recommendations on the management of 
pregnancy after bariatric surgery is given in  
table 10 
.
 
 
Benefits and Risks of Pregnancy after Bariatric Surgery 
 
Currently available data suggests that pregnancy following bariatric surgery is asso-
ciated with improved maternal and foetal outcomes, compared to women with untreated 
obesity  
[97, 98] 
. However, there are concerns with regard to conceiving during the period of 
rapid weight loss seen in the first 12–24 months following bariatric surgery, as this period 
has been associated with higher rates of nutritional deficiencies and obstetric complications 
 
[99] 
. In a multicentre study from Spain including 168 pregnancies in 112 women, a higher 
stillbirth rate was seen in pregnancies occurring in the first year post-surgery  
[100] 
. Current 
guidelines hence recommend delaying pregnancy for at least 12 months following surgery  
[6, 
101, 102] 
.
 
 
Reduced rates of GDM and hypertension have been reported in mothers after bariatric 
surgery  
[97, 103–105] 
. In addition, a reduced incidence of macrosomia has been shown in 
neonates born to mothers who had undergone bariatric surgery  
[103, 105] 
. Emerging data 
suggests that miscarriage rates, which are high in women with untreated obesity, may be 
lower following bariatric surgery  
[106–108] 
. A retrospective study from Denmark in which 
339 women who had received bariatric surgery (83% RYGB and 17% gastric bands) were

matched to 1,277 untreated obese women for pre-pregnancy BMI, age, parity, date of delivery 
and smoking status  
[109] 
. The study investigators reported that infants born to women after 
bariatric surgery had lower birth weights, shorter gestation, a reduced risk of being LGA and 
a higher risk of being small for gestational age (SGA)  
[109] 
. A further large retrospective study 
from Sweden compared pregnancy complications and outcomes in 2,562 women with a 
previous history of bariatric surgery (including vertical banded gastroplasty, RYGB and 
banding) to 12,379 controls matched for age, parity, early pregnancy BMI, smoking status and 
year of delivery  
[110] 
. An increased risk for SGA births and pre-term delivery but a reduced 
risk of LGA infants was seen after bariatric surgery,  
[110] 
. A more recent retrospective study 
from Sweden, compared pregnancy outcomes in 596 mothers who had undergone bariatric 
surgery (98% RYGB) to 2,356 controls with comparable BMI, age, parity, smoking status, 
educational level and year of delivery  
[111] 
. Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced 
risk of GDM and LGA infants, shorter gestation and an increased risk for SGA infants  
[111] 
. An 
increased risk of IUGR and SGA infants is consistently demonstrated also in smaller studies 
 
[112–114] 
. However, reduced risks of preeclampsia, GDM, hypertension, macrosomia and 
congenital malformations are consistently reported after bariatric surgery  
[114] 
. The effects 
of bariatric surgery on maternal and foetal outcomes are summarised in  
table 11 
. 
 
 
The majority of the published literature come from women who have undergone RYGB. 
However, bariatric procedures are anatomically different and therefore differentially impact 
upon the rate and degree of weight loss and post-operative physiological changes. Few studies 
have attempted to directly compare outcomes between procedures; consequently, data are 
limited. Higher rates of SGA infants have been reported following biliopancreatic diversion 
compared to RYGB  
[100] 
. In a different study, IUGR was more common in women who 
underwent RYGB compared to gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy  
[115] 
. However, a 
study by Facchiano et al.  
[116] 
 found no significant differences in outcomes between gastric 
banding and RYGB in terms of obstetric complications, gestational age or birth weight. Despite 
sleeve gastrectomy now being the most common bariatric procedure undertaken globally, 
there are only few reports from pregnancies after sleeve gastrectomy  
[100, 117, 118] 
. A study 
comparing nutritional status in pregnancy in women after RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy 
showed lower rates of nutritional deficiencies following the latter  
[119] 
. Ducarme et al.  
[120] 
 
investigated outcomes in 63 pregnancies following sleeve gastrectomy and showed that 
adverse outcomes after surgery were higher in women who remained obese following 
surgery. Although paucity of data with regard to outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy  persists, 
the available data suggests favourable outcomes  
[91, 96, 100, 117, 118] 
.
 
 
Management of Pregnancy after Bariatric Surgery  
 
In summary, women with pregnancies who had undergone bariatric surgery represent 
a unique obstetric population. Current data suggests that pregnancy after bariatric surgery 
is safe, although good antenatal care is essential. Larger studies are required with longer

follow-up of both mothers and their offspring, continuing into adulthood, to determine 
long-term outcomes as well as to illustrate how different bariatric procedures impact upon 
reproductive outcomes. The next section summarises the advice from current guidelines 
regarding the timing and management of pregnancy following bariatric surgery  
[5, 6, 101, 
102, 121] 
.
 
 
 
Contraception Following Bariatric Surgery:  
Contraception and plans for pregnancy 
following bariatric surgery should be discussed early and form part of pre-operative coun-
selling and education. In particular, women should be informed that their fertility is likely to 
increase immediately after surgery, and contraception should hence be discussed and offered 
 
[5, 102] 
. This is of particular importance in adolescents after bariatric surgery, where rates 
of unwanted pregnancy are higher than both in the general adolescent population and in the 
total post-bariatric surgery population  
[122] 
. The choice of the contraceptive method has 
however been subject of debate, due to concerns about effectiveness, absorption and risks 
associated with hormonal contraception following bariatric surgery (see also ‘Pharmaco-
therapy after Bariatric Surgery’ above). Pharmacokinetics of hormonal contraception is 
differentially affected by different bariatric procedures, as oestrogen is absorbed in the upper 
gastrointestinal tract, which is modified during bariatric surgery  
[123] 
. Oestradiol absorption 
may be reduced in women following jejuno-ileal bypass and biliopancreatic diversion  
[86, 
124] 
. Oral preparations of hormonal contraception should hence be avoided following bilio-
pancreatic diversion and RYGB  
[125] 
. However, no definitive contraindication to the use has 
been suggested following gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy  
[125, 126] 
. A study measuring 
etonogestrel implant effectiveness following RYGB showed that hormone levels remained 
above the threshold required to achieve contraception in a study of three patients  
[127] 
. In a 
separate study, levonogestel-releasing intra-uterine devices were deemed an acceptable 
form of contraception in adolescents following bariatric surgery  
[128] 
. Hence, parenteral 
forms of hormonal contraception should be recommended first line  
[127] 
. Additional deci-
sions regarding the contraceptive choice should be made on an individualised basis, consid-
ering procedure type, age and medical history.
 
 
 
Timing of Pregnancy:  
Nutritional deficiencies are more common in the first 12–18 months 
after surgery when maximal weight loss occurs  
[5] 
. A higher incidence of stillbirths has been 
reported when pregnancy occurs in the 1st year after surgery  
[100] 
. Furthermore, obstetric 
complications after bariatric surgery are more frequent at higher BMI  
[120] 
. Pregnancy is 
hence not recommended during 12–18 months following surgery  
[6, 101] 
. 
  
 
 
 
Pre-Conception Care:  
In preparation for pregnancy, women should take an additional 400 
μg of folic acid in the pre-conception period, and women with a BMI that remains in the obese 
range or with type 2 diabetes should take 5 mg/day until the 12th week of pregnancy  
[121] 
. 
In addition, women should be advised to avoid multivitamins containing vitamin A in the 
retinol form  
[121] 
. 
 
 
 
Ante-Natal Care:  
Although published data state that pregnancy after bariatric surgery is 
safe, good ante-natal care is of vital importance due to the risk of nutritional deficiencies and 
the need for additional monitoring during pregnancy. Ante-natal care should be offered at a 
specialist centre with experience in pregnancy following bariatric surgery, via a specialist 
multidisciplinary ante-natal care team. Where this is not possible due to geographic restriction, 
liaison advice should be offered via a specialist centre.
 
 
 
Nutritional Supplementation and Monitoring of Nutritional Markers during Pregnancy: 
 
Adequate nutritional supplementation is required during pregnancy, in order to ensure that 
the nutritional needs of the mother and the growing foetus are met and to prevent nutritional 
deficiencies  
[5, 6] 
. In the absence of nutrient supplementation, women are at risk of iron, 
folate, vitamin B12 and soluble vitamin deficiencies. Reports in the literature have high-
lighted adverse pregnancy outcomes in the absence of adequate supplementation, including

maternal anaemia, neural tube defects, Wernicke’s encephalopathy and foetal cerebral haem-
orrhage or microphthalmia  
[129–131] 
. Micronutrient supplementation is hence essential 
during pregnancy ( 
table 12 
); these can be met with a pre-natal multivitamin preparation in 
addition to vitamin B12 and calcium  
[6, 121] 
. Standard multivitamin preparations routinely 
used following bariatric procedures should be substituted by a pre-natal multivitamin prep-
aration, in order to reduce vitamin A intake, which should not exceed 5,000 international U/
day  
[121] 
. A thorough nutritional assessment should be undertaken at the beginning of preg-
nancy  
[102] 
. This should include laboratory testing ( 
table 12 
). Women who have undergone 
biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch or distal bypass procedures are at risk of 
soluble vitamin deficiencies  
[121] 
. Supplementation of vitamin A may be advised under 
specialist dietetic supervision, in the form of beta-carotene vitamin A  
[121] 
. Follow-up nutri-
tional screening should be undertaken every trimester, and nutritional supplementation 
should be adjusted accordingly  
[121] 
. 
 
 
 
Ante-Natal Imaging and Growth scans: 
 Routine ultrasounds should be performed at 
weeks 12 and 20. Bariatric surgery should be viewed as a risk factor for IUGR, an additional 
growth scan should be performed and the subsequent need for further growth surveillance 
should be determined at that point  
[102] 
.
 
 
 
Screening for Gestational Complications:  
Screening for hypertension and GDM should be 
undertaken; however, consideration needs to be given to the screening modality

(OGTT) can precipitate dumping syndrome and hypoglycaemia  
[102] 
. A 50 g OGTT should not 
be routinely used in women after bariatric surgery  
[91, 102] 
. A glycated haemoglobin level 
should be measured in the first trimester to exclude pre-existing diabetes, and GDM screening 
should be undertaken by measuring fasting and post-prandial glucose levels. Blood pressure 
should also be measured at every visit.
 
 
 
Diet during Pregnancy:  
Specialist dietary advice by experienced dietitians should be 
offered during pregnancy  
[102] 
. Active weight loss and caloric restriction are not recom-
mended during pregnancy. Pregnant women should consume a balanced diet containing 60 
g protein daily  
[6, 104] 
. Free sugar-rich foods and beverages should be avoided as these can 
precipitate dumping syndrome  
[104] 
. Weight gain in pregnancy should be in line with 
standard recommendations for pre-pregnancy BMI  
[91] 
.
 
 
 
Complications during Pregnancy.  
Women who develop gastro-intestinal symptoms 
during pregnancy should be thoroughly assessed, and a wide differential diagnosis list 
should be borne in mind, including both obstetric complications as well as surgical compli-
cations relating to their primary bariatric procedure  
[102] 
. Careful consideration should 
particularly be given to women presenting with abdominal pain in pregnancy  
[91] 
. RYGB 
results in potential internal spaces that predispose to internal herniation, which can be exac-
erbated by increased intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus  
[133] 
. Women should 
be assessed by a bariatric surgeon, and diagnoses such as band slippage/erosion, herniation, 
small bowel obstruction and intussusception should be considered  
[91, 102, 134] 
. In addition, 
women presenting with hyperemesis gravidarum following RYGB are at increased risk of 
Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and treatment with parenteral vitamin B1 should be considered 
 
[5] 
.
 
 
 
Birth Planning:  
Birth planning for women who have undergone uncomplicated bariatric 
surgery should follow standard guidance. Bariatric surgery in itself is not an indication for 
caesarean section  
[102] 
.
 
 
 
Managing Gastric Banding in Pregnancy:  
No definitive advice exists regarding optimal 
band adjustment throughout pregnancy. Band inflation may reduce maternal complications, 
however this could be at the expense of foetal growth, whereas deflation may prevent band-
related complications, but in turn could result in excessive gestational weight gain and 
increase risk of macrosomia and GDM  
[135] 
. Band adjustment should hence be considered on 
an individualised basis. Band deflation should be performed in women who present with 
vomiting or poor weight gain during pregnancy  
[136] 
.
 
 
 
Managing Pregnancies when Conception Occurs within 12 Months after Surgery:  
Despite 
the advice to delay conceiving until 12–18 months after surgery, a number of women conceive 
during the first 12 months. However, despite the known increased risks in this group, there 
are no recommendations for managing these women. Importantly, women should be 
re-assured and encouraged to enlist a specialist ante-natal care team. Increased monitoring 
for nutritional deficiencies and growth scanning will be required throughout pregnancy. 
Dietary advice should be offered immediately post-conception, and nutritional screening 
should be performed. Additional growth scans should be performed at 4-week intervals 
throughout the third trimester in order to closely monitor foetal growth.
 
 
 
Post-Partum Care:  
Bariatric surgery does not impact adversely upon lactation, and 
women should be encouraged to breastfeed. A risk of nutritional deficiencies has been 
suggested for infants born to mothers who have had RYGB  
[137] 
; hence nutritional supple-
mentation and monitoring should continue during breastfeeding.

Psychological Aspects 
 
As shown before, bariatric surgery is one of the most effective and durable treatments of 
morbid obesity, resulting in significant long-term weight loss as well as improvement of 
co-morbidities and quality of life. Consequently, it seems to be the treatment of choice for 
patients with severe obesity, neglecting any safety concerns. However, these concerns are 
reasonable since the prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities, including suicidal ideation 
and/or behaviour as well as substance abuse or eating disorders, is quite high among morbidly 
obese individuals and bariatric surgery candidates  
[138] 
. Although a peri-operative psycho-
logical evaluation of candidates to bariatric surgery is nowadays highly recommended, there 
may be under-recognition or under-treatment of the mental illness before and after surgery. 
In this section, first-level information about psychological aspects after bariatric surgery is 
included, and a short list of related graded clinical practical recommendations is given in 
 
table 13 
.
 
 
Risk of Suicide 
 
Underlining psychiatric disorders may remain or recur post-operatively, resulting in an 
increased risk of suicide among patients who received bariatric surgery  
[139] 
. Several studies 
demonstrated higher suicide rates among bariatric surgery patients than among non-bariatric 
surgery patients or the general community. These findings are supported by Tindle et al. 
 
[140] 
 who documented an excess of suicides post-operatively, with 30% of the suicides 
occurring within the first 2 years and almost 70% occurring within 3 years after surgery. 
Moreover, approximately 10% of bariatric surgery candidates report a lifetime history of 
suicide attempts, a higher rate than in the general community  
[141] 
. For surgery-seeking

Pre-surgical distress could worsen whenever the results of the surgery 
were not meeting the patients’ expectations or have not led to the

with manifested depression and potentially suicidality.

Regardless of the alcohol history of the morbidly obese individual, all

operatively.

women Chen et al.  
[141] 
 reported that weight-related stigma was associated with suicidal 
ideation and/or behaviour. To further understand the mortality pattern of these patients, 
Omalu et al.  
[142] 
 studied the role of bariatric surgery in this context. In the three studied 
cases, wherein suicide was committed following bariatric surgery, a recurrent major 
depressive disorder was present before and after the intervention, concluding that the 
depressive disorder must have remained although a successful surgical control of obesity was 
obtained. The study of Omalu et al.  
[142] 
 shows how essential a psychological evaluation of 
the bariatric-surgery patient might be for any early evaluation of psychological problems 
post-operatively. Such problems might include a lack of improvement in quality of life after 
surgery, continued or recurrent physical mobility restrictions, persistence or recurrence of 
sexual dysfunction and relationship problems or a history of child maltreatment and might 
contribute to suicidal ideas and/or behaviour post-operatively if not assessed. Furthermore, 
pre-surgical psychological distress could worsen if the results of the surgery were disap-
pointing or failed to have the hoped improvements in quality of life. Herein, one should keep 
in mind that morbidly obese patients might have unrealistic expectations of body appearance 
post-operatively and are therefore constantly disappointed by the aesthetic outcome of their 
surgery. Thus, inadequate weight loss or weight regain might be another cause for a passing 
thought of suicide. Therefore, it is essential to support these patients with psychological and/
or psychiatric treatment if needed and help them to find a new way through life.
 
 
Alcohol Abuse 
 
Bariatric surgery not only increases the risk of suicidal ideation and/or behaviour, it also 
elevates the risk for an alcoholic disease. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood, 
but consistent research suggests that following certain forms of bariatric surgery (i.e. RYGB) 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of alcohol are altered and thereby may heighten the alcohol 
sensitivity of the individual. Besides, several anatomical or physiological changes upon 
surgery may also contribute to altered alcohol absorption and/or metabolism  
[143] 
. The 
increased risk of alcohol misuse after surgery could also be due to a shift of addictions, 
wherein alcohol substitutes food as coping mechanism  
[144] 
. Obviously, the pattern of alcohol 
use pre-operatively also play a role in this addiction transfer. Thus, it is not surprising that 
regular alcohol consumption pre-operatively increases the likelihood of an alcoholic disease 
postoperatively. Although Wee et al.  
[144] 
 could show that more than half of the weight loss 
patients, who reported alcohol abuse before surgery, discontinued high-risk drinking, and 
7% of the patients in this study reported new high-risk drinking 1 year after the intervention. 
Interestingly, the prevalence of alcohol misuse significantly increases in the 2nd year after 
surgery as demonstrated by King et al.  
[145] 
. Thus, regardless of the alcohol history of the 
morbidly obese individual, all bariatric surgery-seeking candidates should be educated on 
the potential effects of this intervention, especially in the case of RYGB, in order to minimise 
the risk of alcohol misuse post-operatively.
 
 
Eating Behaviour Disorders 
 
The prevalence of compulsive eating patterns known as binge eating disorder is quite 
common among bariatric surgery-seeking patients. Usually this prevalence decreases signif-
icantly as soon as weight and shape concerns diminish post-operatively. However, research 
has shown that these problems can persist after bariatric surgery  
[146] 
. Furthermore, several 
studies have demonstrated that a sub-group of patients may develop ‘loss of control’ eating 
following surgery, and even self-induced vomiting due to weight and shape reasons was 
reported. A post-surgery-developed eating disorder is mostly associated with less weight loss 
and increased subjective phobia of weight regain. Obviously, a pre-surgery eating disorder 
also increases the likelihood of such outcomes. However, not all of the bariatric surgery-

seeking patients with ‘loss of control’ eating pre-operatively developed an eating disorder 
after surgery or even showed a tendency to develop bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa 
 
[143] 
. Such a restrictive behaviour is often seen when the old eating pattern recurs. Conse-
quently, self-induced vomiting or food avoidance is performed in an effort to prevent weight 
regain. Besides, also a compensatory behaviour known as post-surgical eating avoidance 
disorder  
[147] 
 can be observed in some patients, when weight loss slows down or stops. 
Taken together, all of the above mentioned eating disorders have two things in common: they 
all demonstrate that these patients have neither adapted to their new demands in their eating 
behaviours after surgery nor that they have learned to cope with stress or other problems in 
a new way. Thus, it is imperative that treatment programmes are developed, which address 
the special needs of this patient group, focusing on both psycho-social factors and eating 
behaviours as well as on weight loss for a successful support. 
 
Weight Regain Prevention and Management 
 
Weight regain after bariatric surgery is a result of hormonal and metabolic alterations, 
surgical failure, nutritional non-adherence, mental health issues and physical inactivity  
[148] 
. 
Although randomised controlled trials specifically targeting prevention of weight regain are 
lacking, current observations suggest that enforcing and sustaining healthy lifestyle facili-
tates adherence to therapy and therefore helps to prevent weight regain. Adding anti-obesity 
drugs and/or re-do operations may halt weight regain or create further weight loss when 
applied at optimal timing. In this last section, first-level information about weight regain 
prevention and management is included, and a short list of related graded clinical practical 
recommendations is given in  
table 14 
.
 
 
Although the exact aetiology of weight regain is not well understood, it is clearly multi-
factorial. Aside from lifestyle issues, genetic background and time from surgery are all risk 
factors. In addition, decreased satiety can occur because of variety of reasons, e.g. as a result 
of dilation of the gastro-jejunal stoma (the connection between the gastric pouch and 
jejunum) in RYGB or of volume dilatation of the reduced stomach, pointing to an interplay 
between behavioural factors and post-operative body compensatory mechanisms influ-
encing anatomy  
[149] 
. After any bariatric and/or metabolic procedure, it is quite natural

that some weight regain occurs in long-term follow-up. It is estimated that around 50% of 
post-bariatric patients regain around 5% of their body weight in 2 years after the procedure 
 
[150] 
.
 
 
There are several success components contributing to desirable and adequate outcomes 
of the surgical treatment of obesity. Standardised, life-long follow-up available and provided 
to all the post-bariatric patients is among the most important ones. Decades of bariatric 
surgery have proven that treatment outcomes and success after bariatric surgery is dependent 
on technically perfect surgery. However, success depends more significantly on patient long-
term compliance with a follow-up regimen. Patients who are compliant with the follow-up 
requirements and attend the support groups programmes, including education about dietary 
requirements, exhibit better and enhanced outcomes (approximately 10% lower BMI) in 
comparison with those who did not attend any of the follow-up programmes  
[151] 
. An 
important part of the follow-up regimen is that the follow-up team is composed by multidis-
ciplinary experts. Thus, the team of experts ideally comprise a nutritionist/dietician, a 
psychologist, a specialised physician and a bariatric surgeon  
[152, 153] 
. The follow-up inter-
ventions of both the support groups as well as the team of experts are focused, among other 
tasks, on leveraging lifestyle changes and affording the patient to commit to those changes 
and to maintain them in the long run  
[151] 
.
 
 
An important component of successful and long-lasting weight loss is adherence to 
nutrient-dense foods, containing sufficient amounts of lean proteins and fibres (fruits and 
vegetables). This is especially true in longer term after bariatric surgery when the stomach 
volume slowly, however inevitably, expands and appetite begins to increase. High-volume 
foods like vegetables and fruits can contribute substantially to weight regain prevention  
[6, 
154] 
.
 
 
Patients attending support groups after bariatric/metabolic surgery show enhanced 
weight loss and other treatment outcomes, specifically after RYGB and adjustable gastric 
banding. Patients should be repeatedly educated about staged meal progression dependent 
on the time elapsed after surgery and based on the type of surgical procedure they underwent. 
Patients should also be informed that an excessive number and size of meals would probably 
result in lower weight loss  
[7, 151, 155, 156] 
. A consultation for post-operative meal initiation 
and progression should be arranged with a dietician who is knowledgeable of the post-oper-
ative bariatric diet. Patients should receive education in a protocol-derived staged meal 
progression based on their surgical procedure. Patients should be counselled to eat three 
small meals during the day and chew small bites of food thoroughly before swallowing. 
Patients should adhere with principles of healthy eating, including at least five daily servings 
of fresh fruits and vegetables  
[7, 155, 156] 
.
 
 
Fitness and adequate, slowly increasing physical activity contributes to preserving and 
building muscle mass. This further contributes to successful weight loss and prevents weight 
regain. Patients should be advised to incorporate moderate aerobic physical activity, i.e., a 
minimum of 150 min/week (with a goal of 300 min/week) as well as strength training 2–3 
times per week. Walking with the aim for small, attainable increases in walking distances 
could be the optimal exercise modality, at least for several months after operation. Losing 
some weight prior to the procedure may further contribute to more pronounced weight loss 
after bariatric surgery and increases the likelihood of long-term weight maintenance following 
the operation  
[2] 
.
 
 
In the European Guidelines for Obesity Management in Adults  
[2] 
 and in the Interdisci-
plinary European Guidelines on Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery  
[157] 
 it has been highlighted 
that the interdisciplinary teams are ideally available in specialised clinics like European Asso-
ciation for the Study of Obesity Collaborating Centres for Obesity Management (EASO-COMs). 
The team members should be responsible for follow-up; however, the ultimate responsibility

should remain with the physician and surgeon who were engaged in the pre-operative and 
operation period.
 
 
As it was already mentioned, there are several important rules that should be respected 
in order to optimise bariatric surgery outcomes after different types of operations. The 
rules are stated in the Interdisciplinary European Guidelines on Metabolic and Bariatric 
Surgery  
[151] 
. In general, it has to be stressed that a better understanding of substantial 
metabolic changes induced by different surgical interventions to the alimentary tract was 
achieved in the past several years. Therefore, the former classification of operations 
according to their influence on food ingestion, defined as limiting stomach capacity 
(restrictive), limiting absorption of nutrients (malabsorptive) or combined procedures 
does not appropriately reflect the current level of knowledge about early and weight-inde-
pendent metabolic effects of these operations. Nowadays, most of the standard surgical 
interventions are being mostly referred to as metabolic operations. The focus when treating 
obese patients is gradually shifting from the primary goal of weight loss outcomes to the 
metabolic effects of the operations. However for didactical reasons, the former classifi-
cation is still used  
[151] 
. 
 
 
Follow-up during the 1st year should be at least every 3 months, starting 1 month 
post-operatively until a clinically satisfactory rate of weight loss is achieved. Thereafter, 
follow-up should be done annually. Follow-up should be carried out by the interdisci-
plinary team and include dietary change / behavioural modification / physical activity 
interventions and encouragement as well as pharmacology support and surgical revision 
if appropriate  
[151] 
. 
 
 
In general, anti-obesity drugs may contribute to weight loss in patients with obesity 
 
[158] 
. After bariatric surgery, anti-obesity drugs are usually started when weight regain 
ensues. Prescribing weight loss pharmacotherapy before weight regain occurs (at weight 
plateau) may result in greater amount of total weight loss from the pre-operative period 
 
[159] 
 and may prevent weight regain. A recent retrospective review demonstrated that 
phentermine alone and a phentermine-topiramate combination, in addition to diet and 
exercise, appear to be viable options for weight loss in RYGB and adjustable gastric banding 
patients who experienced weight recidivism or weight loss plateau  
[160] 
. Another study 
showed that medical treatment directed to the control of satiety using liraglutide may be an 
alternative treatment of patients with poor weight loss or weight regain after surgery  
[161] 
. 
Since most of the studies reporting the utility of anti-obesity drugs are retrospective and 
such clinical studies at present are of small scale, further prospective randomised clinical 
trials should be performed to demonstrate the effect of drugs on prevention and treatment 
of weight regain.
 
 
It may be expected that in the long term a certain weight regain occurs after most of the 
bariatric operations. Such weight regain is to be viewed as a result of progression of the 
chronic disease of obesity and should not be considered as failure of the surgical treatment. 
Thus, the true failure of the surgical treatment results in surgical emergency and necessitates 
emergency re-operation. On the contrary, elective redo surgery offers the opportunity to 
further leverage surgical treatment and to re-adjust it according to disease development and 
progression. The choice of redo operation depends on surgeon’s opinion and institutional 
standardised algorithm. Patient’s satisfaction and compliance with the previous surgery and 
patient’s individual preferences should also be taken into account. In general, the type of redo 
surgery should be chosen in line with a complex analysis of causes of weight regain, an inter-
disciplinary assessment of a given patient and the patient’s preference.

Conclusion 
 
Bariatric surgery today is the most effective long-term therapy for the management of 
patients with severe and/or complicated obesity. This simple observation, now incorporated 
in the most relevant guidelines of the management of obesity in adults  
[2] 
, leads to a gradual 
but continuous increase in the number of bariatric procedures performed in Europe and 
world-wide  
[1] 
. Bariatric surgery is in general safe and effective, but it can cause new clinical 
problems and it is associated with specific diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic needs. 
Special knowledge and skills of the clinicians are required in order to deliver appropriate and 
effective care to the post-bariatric patient. A post-bariatric multidisciplinary follow-up 
programme should be an integral part of the clinical pathway at centres delivering bariatric 
surgery, and it should be offered to patients requiring it  
[151] 
. However, giving the growing 
number of post-bariatric patients, an increasing part of the follow-up, particularly after the 
early period after surgery, should also be transferred to the primary care physicians and to 
obesity specialists, dieticians and nurses not primarily engaged in the bariatric programme.
