Abstract
Background
Dentists prescribe approximately 10% of antibiotics dispensed in UK community pharma-
cies. Despite clear clinical guidance, dentists often prescribe antibiotics inappropriately.
This cluster-randomised controlled trial used routinely collected National Health Service
(NHS) dental prescribing and treatment claim data to compare the impact of individualised
audit and feedback (A&F) interventions on dentists’ antibiotic prescribing rates.
Methods and Findings
All 795 antibiotic prescribing NHS general dental practices in Scotland were included. Prac-
tices were randomised to the control (practices = 163; dentists = 567) or A&F intervention
group (practices = 632; dentists = 1,999). A&F intervention practices were allocated to one
of two A&F groups: (1) individualised graphical A&F comprising a line graph plotting an indi-
vidual dentist’s monthly antibiotic prescribing rate (practices = 316; dentists = 1,001); or (2)
individualised graphical A&F plus a written behaviour change message synthesising and
reiterating national guidance recommendations for dental antibiotic prescribing (practices =
316; dentists = 998). Intervention practices were also simultaneously randomised to receive
A&F: (i) with or without a health board comparator comprising the addition of a line to the
graphical A&F plotting the monthly antibiotic prescribing rate of all dentists in the health
board; and (ii) delivered at 0 and 6 mo or at 0, 6, and 9 mo, giving a total of eight intervention
groups. The primary outcome, measured by the trial statistician who was blinded to alloca-
tion, was the total number of antibiotic items dispensed per 100 NHS treatment claims over

Funding: This study was conducted as part of the

which is funded by NHS Education for Scotland

 the 12 mo post-delivery of the baseline A&F. Primary outcome data was available for 152
control practices (dentists = 438) and 609 intervention practices (dentists = 1,550). At base-
line, the number of antibiotic items prescribed per 100 NHS treatment claims was 8.3 in
the control group and 8.5 in the intervention group. At follow-up, antibiotic prescribing had
decreased by 0.4 antibiotic items per 100 NHS treatment claims in control practices and by
1.0 in intervention practices. This represents a significant reduction (-5.7%; 95% CI -10.2%
to -1.1%; p = 0.01) in dentists' prescribing rate in the intervention group relative to the control
group. Intervention subgroup analyses found a 6.1% reduction in the antibiotic prescribing
rate of dentists who had received the written behaviour change message relative to dentists
who had not (95% CI -10.4% to -1.9%; p = 0.01). There was no significant between-group
difference in the prescribing rate of dentists who received a health board comparator rela-
tive to those who did not (-4.3%; 95% CI -8.6% to 0.1%; p = 0.06), nor between dentists who
received A&F at 0 and 6 mo relative to those who received A&F at 0, 6, and 9 mo (0.02%;
95% CI -4.2% to 4.2%; p = 0.99). The key limitations relate to the use of routinely collected
datasets which did not allow evaluation of any effects on inappropriate prescribing.
Conclusions
A&F derived from routinely collected datasets led to a significant reduction in the antibiotic
prescribing rate of dentists.

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health and
patient safety.
• Dentists prescribe around 10% of antibiotics dispensed in UK community pharmacies,
but, despite clear clinical guidance, dentists often prescribe antibiotics inappropriately in
the absence of clinical need.
• This study evaluated the impact of using routine data to audit and provide dentists with
individualised feedback comprising a line graph plotting their monthly antibiotic pre-
scribing rate on dentists’ antibiotic prescribing.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• All 795 antibiotic prescribing NHS general dental practices in Scotland were randomly
allocated to receive or not to receive individualised feedback.

 • At follow-up, the antibiotic prescribing rate of dentists who received individualised feed-
back was 5.7% lower than the antibiotic prescribing rate of dentists who did not receive
individualised feedback.
• Feedback that included a written message synthesising and reiterating national guidance
recommendations had the greatest effect.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Individualised graphical feedback derived from routinely collected data can significantly
reduce the antibiotic prescribing rate of dentists.
• A key limitation of using routine data is that it was not possible to evaluate the impact
on the quality or appropriateness of dentists’ antibiotic prescribing.
• The feedback provided in this study is a relatively straightforward, low-cost public health
and patient safety intervention that could potentially help the entire healthcare profes-
sion address the increasing challenge of antimicrobial resistance.
Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health and patient
safety, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs [1,2]. Increased use of
antibiotics in medicine, dentistry, and agriculture is a major contributor to the spread of anti-
microbial resistance [3,4]. Dentists are responsible for approximately 10% of all antibiotics dis-
pensed in UK community pharmacies [5–8]. Despite clear clinical guidance [9,10], evidence
demonstrates that dentists often prescribe antibiotics inappropriately in the absence of clinical
need [5,7,11,12].
There is an urgent need to change health professionals’ prescribing behaviour, but the effec-
tiveness of strategies to change the behaviour of health professionals is variable. A systematic
review [13] that included 140 randomised controlled trials showed that audit and feedback
(A&F) has small to moderate effects on health professionals’ behaviour. However, the evidence
informing its effectiveness for changing antibiotic prescribing behaviour within the primary-
care setting was sparse, with only four of the trials studying the effect of feedback on prescrib-
ing within primary care. The review authors concluded that A&F could lead to small but
important improvements and future studies should directly compare the effectiveness of differ-
ent ways of providing feedback.
National guidance [9] to improve primary care dental prescribing was first published and
distributed to all dentists in Scotland by the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme
(SDCEP) in April 2008. The guidance states that dental antibiotic prescribing must be kept to a
minimum and recommends that the first step in the treatment of bacterial infections should be
the use of local measures (e.g., drain pus in a dental abscess). Antibiotics are only indicated if
there are signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement and should be used in conjunc-
tion with local measures.
Recognising the continued knowledge-to-practice gap and to support the implementation
of SDCEP recommendations for antibiotic prescribing, the Translation Research in a Dental

 Setting (TRiaDS) programme [14], which develops and evaluates interventions for improving
dental healthcare in Scotland, identified antibiotic prescribing by dentists as a priority area for
research. The RAPiD (Reducing Antibiotic Prescribing in Dentistry) trial reported here is, to
our knowledge, the first dental primary care study to randomise all practices in a country using
national NHS dental prescribing and treatment claim data to compare the effectiveness of indi-
vidualised A&F interventions for the translation into practice of national guidance recommen-
dations on antibiotic prescribing. In addition, a secondary objective was to explore dentists’
experiences of and responses to the individualised A&F interventions and to facilitate under-
standing of the processes associated with antibiotic prescribing in dentistry.
Methods
Ethical Approval
The East of Scotland Research Ethics Service reviewed the study and, in line with UK Gover-
nance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees (GAfREC), confirmed ethical review or
approval by an NHS REC was not required (Ref: 11/GA/229). In addition, the protocol was
submitted to the NHS Research Scotland Permissions Coordinating Centre and reviewed by
the Tayside Medical Science Centre Research and Development (R&D) office. They classified
the RAPiD trial as service development/audit and confirmed that it did not require R&D regis-
tration, formal review, or approval. Confirmation was received from all 14 Scottish Health
Boards that they had been notified of the study and had added it to their Clinical Governance
and Quality Improvement records. The data used to derive the graphical A&F contained no
identifiable information about the patients who were prescribed an antibiotic or about the
patients who received treatment under a participating dentist’s list number, and, therefore,
informed consent from patients was not required.
Trial Registration
The study was registered with Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN49204710, available at www.
conrolled-trials.com and a detailed protocol published (RAPiD Trial Protocol) prior to the
final data collection and before any outcomes were analysed.
Trial Design
Details of the trial design and methods have been described in detail elsewhere [15]. To sum-
marise, RAPiD was a 12-mo partial factorial cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in
NHS General Dental Practices across Scotland.
Practices were randomly allocated to the control group (no A&F) or to the intervention
group. Intervention group practices were evenly allocated to one of two A&F groups (individu-
alised graphical A&F with or without a written behaviour change message). In each of these
two groups, practices were simultaneously allocated to receive A&F: (i) with or without a health
board comparator; and (ii) at 0 and 6 mo or at 0, 6, and 9 mo, giving a total of 8 intervention
groups. In each intervention practice, all dentists received their own individualised graphical
A&F according to their practice’s allocation.
A cluster design was used to reduce contamination within dental practices. A factorial
design was used to assess the effect of three A&F interventions (i.e., inclusion of a written
behaviour change message, inclusion of a health board comparator, and varying the interval
between receiving A&F). A control group was included to test the effectiveness of any form of
A&F strategy. The trial design is depicted in Fig 1.

 Study Population and Eligibility
All NHS General Dental Practices across the 14 health boards in Scotland were assessed for eli-
gibility to be included in the study. Practice addresses and the names of all individual dentists
working in these practices were identified from the Management Information and Dental
Accounting System (MIDAS) database. MIDAS contains contact information for all primary
care dental practices and dentists in Scotland and details all payment claims made by dentists
for the NHS treatment provided to their patients.
A minimum of 6 mo of NHS treatment claim data in the 12 mo prior to the delivery of the
baseline intervention at month 0 was required for practices to be included in the trial. Practices
in mainland health boards with NHS salaried dentists were excluded. On the Scottish main-
land, NHS salaried dentists are generally employed by their health board to provide commu-
nity and emergency dental services. The range of treatments provided in these services is more
limited than in the General Dental Service, and, therefore, salaried dentists were used as a
proxy to identify these types of practices. Predominantly due to geography, the majority of den-
tal services in the island health boards are provided by NHS salaried dentists. However, in

 contrast to salaried dentists in mainland health boards, salaried dentists in island health boards
also provide general dental services. Therefore, all practices in the island health boards were
included. Within each included practice, all dentists listed in MIDAS in the month prior to the
intervention being delivered at month 0 were included in the trial.
Intervention Development
Graphical individualised audit and feedback.
The graphical A&F for an individual den-
tist comprised a line graph plotting the individual dentist’s monthly antibiotic prescribing rate
presented on a single side of paper.
The graph was derived using two routinely collected electronic healthcare datasets held cen-
trally by the Information Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland.
1. The Prescribing Information System for Scotland (PRISMS) database. PRISMS contains
information for all primary care prescription items dispensed in community pharmacies
since April 2004. For each dentist, their monthly antibiotic prescribing volume was the
number of antibiotic items (British National Formulary, Section 5.1 [16]) prescribed and
dispensed in a community pharmacy each month. Each antibiotic item represents a single
prescription item for a course of antibiotics.
2. The MIDAS database contains information relating to all NHS treatment claims made by
dentists in the General Dental Service since 1990. Each NHS treatment claim represents a
claim for payment for the provision of single course of NHS dental treatment to an individ-
ual patient. The course of treatment provided is determined by the patient’s oral health
needs and may be delivered at one or more appointments dependent on the number of indi-
vidual treatments required (e.g., examination only, examination plus a filling, etc.).
A list number is allocated to all primary care dentists in Scotland by their health board, and
all patients attending a dentist are registered under that dentist’s list number. List numbers are
used as the dentist identifier in both the PRISMS and MIDAS databases and were used as the
single common identifier to link each dentist’s prescribing data from PRISMS to their NHS
treatment claim data from MIDAS. For each individual dentist, the prescribing rate was calcu-
lated as the monthly number of antibiotic items recorded in PRISMS divided by the mean
monthly number of NHS treatment claims recorded in the MIDAS database (multiplied by
100).
Written behaviour change message. The written behaviour change message synthesised
and reiterated national guidance recommendations for dental antibiotic prescribing. This mes-
sage was placed immediately below the A&F line graph on the same side of the paper.
To construct this message, SDCEP guidance recommendations for antibiotic prescribing
when managing patients with bacterial infections were coded for the presence/absence of
behaviour change techniques (BCTs), using the 2012 BCT taxonomy [17,18], by a researcher
trained in its use. Two BCTs were identified and selected for inclusion in the behaviour change
message: (1) instruction on how to perform the behaviour; and (2) provide information about
health consequences of performing the behaviour. When possible, the exact wording from the
SDCEP prescribing guidance was used. Full details of the wording and the development can be
found in S1 Text. An example A&F chart including the written behaviour change message is
provided in S1 Fig.
Health board comparator. The health board comparator was the inclusion of an addi-
tional line to the A&F graph plotting the monthly antibiotic prescribing rate of all dentists in
an individual dentist’s health board. Monthly prescribing rates for health boards were calcu-
lated using PRISMS prescribing data and MIDAS NHS treatment claim data in the same way

 as for each individual dentist but were based on the total number of antibiotic items dispensed
and total number of NHS treatment claims within each health board.
The interval between receiving feedback.
The interval between receiving A&F was varied
according to allocation (Fig 1), with A&F received at either 0 and 6 mo or at 0, 6 and 9 mo.
Intervention Delivery
MIDAS and PRISMS data are updated routinely on a monthly basis with a time lag of between
2 and 3 mo. Updates of data were received by the trial office every month throughout the
duration of the trial, and the A&F delivered to dentists at 0 and 6 mo or at 0, 6, and 9 mo con-
tained the most recently available data. All A&F was delivered by post to the dentist’s practice
address.
The initial A&F delivered to dentists in intervention practices at month 0 (01 May 2013)
contained retrospective prescribing rates taken from the most recently available previous 14
mo (01 November 2011 to 31 December 2012). The A&F delivered at month 6 (01 November
2013) contained 20 mo of data (01 November 2011 to 30 June 2013). The A&F delivered at
month 9 (01 February 2014) contained 23 mo of data (01 November 2011 to 30 September
2013).
Outcomes
The linked prescribing/NHS treatment claim dataset was used to determine the outcomes for
each dentist within a dental practice. The primary outcome, measured by the trial statistician,
who was blinded to allocation, was the total number of antibiotic items (from Section 5.1 of
the British National Formulary [16]) dispensed per 100 NHS treatment claims over the 12 mo
from May 2013 to April 2014.
The SDCEP guidance [9] advises against the use of antibiotics as prophylaxis for the preven-
tion of infective endocarditis or to prevent infection in patients with prosthetic joints. The
most common antibiotic used by dentists as prophylaxis in these circumstances is amoxicillin
3g. The guidance also advises against the routine use of broad spectrum antibiotics in dentistry.
Therefore, for each dentist, the secondary outcomes were the total number of amoxicillin 3g
dispensed per 100 NHS treatment claims over the 12 months from May 2013 to April 2014 and
the total number of broad spectrum antibiotics (clindamycin, co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin,
cefalexin, and cefradine) dispensed per 100 NHS treatment claims over the 12 months from
May 2013 to April 2014.
Because measurement of an antibiotic item provides no information about the dosage con-
tained within each item, the defined daily dose (DDD) prescribing rates over the same period
were also calculated for the primary outcome and the additional secondary outcomes. The
DDD is a statistical measure of drug consumption defined by the World Health Organisation
Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology as “the assumed average maintenance
dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults” [19]. It facilitates evaluation of
trends in drug consumption and comparisons of consumption across different populations.
Sample Size
The required sample size to achieve 80% power (with two-sided alpha of 2.5% allowing for
multiple comparisons) to detect a 10% difference in overall antibiotic prescribing between
intervention groups was 316 per group. This applied to the comparison between A&F only and
A&F with an additional written behaviour change message, the comparison between those
with and without a health board comparator, and the comparison between A&F at 0, 6, and
9 mo versus 0 and 6 mo only. Therefore, 632 practices were required to receive an A&F

 intervention with 79 practices in each of the eight sub-level experimental units. There were 795
practices eligible to be included in the trial, which left 163 practices in the control arm. The
comparison between the control group (n = 163) and the intervention group (n = 632) had
80% power to detect a 12% decrease in overall antibiotic prescribing. The study was not pow-
ered to detect realistic two-way interaction effects between behavioural components.
The sample size and power calculations were based on aggregated practice level antibiotic
prescribing activity recorded in PRISMS for the 1,799 dentist list numbers in Scotland known
to be prescribing throughout the year ending June 2010. The mean number of antibiotic items
prescribed per list was 141.1 with a standard deviation of 140.9. The correlation with the year
ending June 2009 was 0.91, and the calculations were adjusted using the correction described
by Borm et al. for trials with correlated data [20].
Randomisation and Allocation
The unit of randomisation was the dental practice. All eligible dental practices (n = 795) were
simultaneously randomised by the trial statistician at the beginning of the trial, prior to any
baseline feedback being distributed. The statistician was blinded to the identity of the practices.
The allocation schedule for random assignment was computer generated. Practices were
ordered randomly, with the first 632 practices being allocated to an A&F intervention and the
remaining practices being allocated to the control group (n = 163). Each of the 632 intervention
practices was allocated to one of eight subgroups with an even allocation so that 79 practices
were randomised to each subgroup (Fig 1). Randomisation was stratified by single-handed/
multi-handed practices. Single-handed practices are practices in which there is only one den-
tist, whereas in multi-handed practices there is more than one dentist.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata 13. A single principle analysis was conducted
using 12 mo post baseline intervention data (i.e., covering up to 30 April 2014). The analysis
estimated the effect of the overall A&F intervention compared with current practice and also
estimated the differential effect of separate elements of the intervention (i.e., inclusion of the
TRiaDS written behaviour change message, inclusion of a health board comparator, and fre-
quency of feedback) within the intervention group. Main effects analyses of covariance on the
12-month prescribing rate were performed, adjusting for the pre-intervention annual prescrib-
ing rate and practice size (defined as single-handed/multi-handed). Two-way interaction terms
were estimated when comparing the differential effect of separate elements of the intervention.
All outcomes were weighted by the number of NHS treatment claims submitted by the dentist
during the year from May 2013 to April 2014, and the analyses were clustered by dental prac-
tice. Effect sizes were calculated as the difference in the prescribing rate between groups and
also the equivalent percentage reduction from baseline. The same approach was used for all
prescribing behaviours under investigation. All analyses adjusted for clustering of dentists
within practice using the Huber-White robust standard error procedure in Stata 13 [21].
Model residuals were checked to assess goodness of model fit.
Additionally, for the primary outcome, we investigated whether larger effects of the inter-
ventions were observed for dentists reporting higher pre-intervention levels of prescribing
(when the annual prescribing rate was above the upper quartile). The intra-cluster correlation
coefficient to measure relatedness of the data within dental practices was also determined, and
to test for a reduction in the spread of prescribing levels, Levene's test for equality of variances
between pre-intervention and intervention phases was applied.

 Process Evaluation
Full details of the process evaluation methods have been reported elsewhere [15]. To summa-
rise, 30 semi-structured audio-recorded telephone interviews from a purposive sample of den-
tists working within eligible dental practices (i.e., practices allocated to an A&F intervention
group or allocated to the control group) were conducted. Potential participants were identified
from the linked MIDAS and PRISMS data. Three hundred potential participants (100 low
prescribers, 100 medium, and 100 high) were sampled using implicit stratification, ensuring
representativeness based on the following baseline factors: health board, practice prescribing
profile (e.g., all dentists in the practice are high/medium/low prescribers or a mixture of high/
medium/low prescribers), and practice size (i.e., single-handed/multi-handed). Throughout
recruitment, diversity variables were tracked in order to inform ongoing sampling of potential
participants to maximise representativeness across these factors. From the 64 dentists con-
tacted to take part, 30 agreed to be interviewed (47% response rate).
The interview process was ceased after the 30th interview, when no new information was
obtained. The transcribed interviews were content-analysed by a single researcher using the
qualitative data analysis software package NVivo 10. The Consolidated Framework for Imple-
mentation Research [22] and the Theoretical Domains Framework [23,24] for health psychol-
ogy were used as coding frameworks. A second researcher also coded 10% of the transcripts
independently to ensure fidelity of the coding system. All the coding was discussed and agreed
on by three researchers. This paper presents the findings of dentists’ experiences of and
responses to the A&F interventions. The findings on the processes associated with antibiotic
prescribing are published separately [25].
Results
Participants and Intervention Delivered
All 1,035 locations providing dental services across Scotland were assessed for eligibility. Sev-
enty-five practices with salaried dentists and 165 practices without a minimum of 6 mo of NHS
treatment claim data in the 12 mo prior to the baseline intervention were excluded. A total of
795 practices (2,566 dentists) were randomised—632 (1,999 dentists) to the intervention group
and 163 (567 dentists) to the control group. Average (median) cluster size in the intervention
group and control group was 3 (intervention min = 1, max = 14; control min = 1, max = 21)
(Fig 2).
All practices randomised to an intervention group received the initial feedback in May
2013. At 6 mo, the intervention was delivered to 629 practices (2,055 dentists), and at 9 mo,
316 practices (996 dentists) received the intervention. There was minimal loss to follow-up.
Nine (1%) practices in total (intervention = 4; control = 5) closed during the 12 mo of the trial’s
intervention delivery phase. In the remaining 786 practices (intervention = 628; control = 158),
some dentists included at baseline had no follow-up data due to their leaving the practice,
while other dentists joined trial practices during the trial and therefore had no baseline data.
All dentists who had incomplete data (469 intervention dentists; 114 control dentists) were
dropped from the analyses. In 19 intervention and 6 control practices, all dentists had incom-
plete data. This left 1,550 intervention dentists (609 practices) and 438 control dentists (152
practices) for inclusion in the analyses (Fig 2).
Baseline
At baseline, NHS treatment claims (mean = 1,247) in the control group during the 12 months
prior to delivery of the A&F intervention at month 0 (May 2012 to April 2013) were lower than

 in the intervention group (mean = 1,340). Prescribing rates were similar across the two groups
(Table 1). Approximately 16% of the practices in each group were single-handed.
Follow-Up
At follow-up, the average number of NHS treatment claims by dentists in the control group
remained constant (mean = 1247). For dentists in the intervention group, average claims were
lower than at baseline (mean = 1295).
Primary Outcome
The rate of antibiotic prescribing by dentists receiving an A&F intervention was reduced from
8.5 items per 100 NHS treatment claims at baseline to 7.5 items per 100 NHS treatment claims

 at follow-up. Dentists in the control group also reduced antibiotic prescribing from 8.3 items
per 100 NHS treatment claims to 7.9 items per 100 NHS treatment claims, giving an overall
adjusted effect size of 0.47 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.85) fewer antibiotic items per 100 NHS treatment
claims. The primary analysis revealed this to be a significant change (p = 0.01), representing a
5.7% reduction (95% CI -1.1% to -10.2%) in the antibiotic prescribing rate in the intervention
group relative to the control group (Table 2). The intra-cluster correlation coefficient was esti-
mated at 0.193 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.24).

 In the intervention subgroups, a significant 6.1% reduction in the prescribing rate was
observed for those who received the graphical A&F plus the written behaviour change message
compared to those who received the graphical A&F only (95% CI -10.4% to -1.9%; p = 0.01).
There was no significant difference in the prescribing rate of dentists who were provided with a
health board comparator as part of their graphical A&F compared to dentists who did not
receive the comparator (-4.3%; 95% CI -8.6% to 0.1%; p = 0.06). There was also no significant
difference in the prescribing rate between dentists who received A&F at 0 and 6 mo and those
who received A&F at 0, 6, and 9 mo (0.02%; 95% CI -4.2% to 4.2%; p = 0.99) (Table 2). There
was no statistically significant evidence of two-way interaction effects for (i) dentists who
received a health board comparator and received A&F at 0, 6, and 9 mo (-3.0%; 95% CI -11.4%
to 5.4%; p = 0.484); (ii) dentists who received the written behaviour change message and
received A&F at 0, 6, and 9 mo (+1.0%; 95% CI -7.6% to 9.6%; p = 0.809); and (iii) dentists
who received the written behaviour change message and received a health board comparator
(+8.2%; 95% CI -0.4% to 16.9%; p = 0.061).
Subgroup analyses exploring the possibility of effect moderation by pre-intervention levels
of prescribing were not statistically significant (interaction -0.74; 95% CI -1.78 to 0.29;
p = 0.159). There was no significant difference in prescribing rates from baseline by high pre-
scribers (> upper quartile) in the intervention group compared to high prescribers in the con-
trol group (-11.6%; 95% CI -23.5% to 0.2%; p = 0.06). There was also no significant difference
in prescribing rates by low baseline prescribers (< lower quartile) in the intervention group
compared to control (–2.7%; 95% CI -7.0% to 1.6%; p = 0.22). There was no indication that the
variability of antibiotic prescribing rates was changed in the intervention period (Levene’s test,
p = 0.414).
Secondary Outcomes
Table 3 presents the results from the secondary outcomes analyses. The DDD rate reduced by
-2.60 per 100 NHS treatment claims, representing a 6.6% reduction (95% CI -12.5% to -0.7%;
p = 0.03) in the intervention group relative to the control group. No other statistically signifi-
cant differences were observed for the remaining secondary outcomes (Table 3). For groups
receiving the various components within the A&F intervention, there were no significant dif-
ferences in the secondary outcomes (Table 3).
Process Evaluation
The findings from the process evaluation are reported in S1 Table. In summary, dentists
reacted positively to receiving the A&F intervention, although views varied according to the
type of intervention received. Participants believed that the graph was easy to understand and
the feedback was useful and beneficial to manage their prescribing behaviour. The findings
support the results from the statistical analyses in relation to the inclusion of guidance or
instruction as given in the written behaviour change intervention. Dentists also expressed a
preference for a comparator to be included in their feedback but expressed no strong prefer-
ence for receiving feedback more than twice a year.
As a direct result of receiving the A&F intervention, some dentists had initiated discussions
with colleagues to review and agree on prescribing patterns, while others had made decisions
to delay treatment with antibiotics. Most participants believed the intervention had changed
their antibiotic prescribing practices. No dentist who participated in the process evaluation
reported any unintended consequences or harm as a result of receiving their A&F. Suggestions
such as a more localised or additional comparators and the inclusion of patient data were pro-
posed as ways in which the intervention could be modified or improved.

 Discussion
This study assessed the effectiveness of individualised A&F interventions on the translation
into practice of guidance recommendations on antibiotic prescribing in dental primary care
across an entire healthcare system (Scotland). For dentists in practices exposed to an A&F
intervention, significant reductions in the total number of antibiotics per 100 NHS treatment
claims and the DDD prescribing rates were observed, relative to dentists in control group prac-
tices. If the benefit was extrapolated to all dentists in Scotland, this would equate to approxi-
mately 20,000 fewer antibiotic items over a 12-mo period. Subgroup analyses found that the
A&F intervention that demonstrated the greatest impact was provision of a line graph depict-
ing a dentist’s monthly antibiotic prescribing rate plus a written behaviour change message
that synthesised and reiterated national guidance recommendations for dental antibiotic pre-
scribing. There was no statistically significant difference between dentists who received a line
graph of their own antibiotic prescribing rate compared to the prescribing rate of all dentists in
their health board with those who were not shown the comparator. However, some dentists
who participated in the process evaluation expressed a preference for inclusion of a health
board comparator, and, therefore, this could also be considered. There was no evidence to sug-
gest that feedback provided more frequently than every 6 mo had any additional impact on
antibiotic prescribing rates.
The effects of the intervention varied across the individual secondary outcomes being tested.
There was a statistically significant reduction in the DDD prescribing rate of dentists who

 received an A&F intervention compared to control group dentists. However, the antibiotic
item prescribing rates and DDD prescribing rates of amoxicillin 3g and the broad spectrum
antibiotics did not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups. There was
also no effect moderation by pre-intervention levels of prescribing, though any moderation
may be contaminated by regression to the mean effects.
We previously discussed the strengths and limitations of this study design in the published
protocol [15]. These included the study’s innovation in its use of routinely collected elec-
tronic healthcare data across all stages of the trial design. In particular, administrative data-
sets (MIDAS and PRISMS) were used to identify the study population, apply eligibility
criteria, carry out stratified randomisation, generate individualised feedback for the trial
intervention, and analyse trial outcomes. Methodological strengths of this design include
minimisation of assessment reactivity (e.g., non-contact recruitment of trial participants, no-
contact (postal) delivery of the trial intervention, no self-report measures, and no opportu-
nity for researchers to influence the antibiotic prescribing rates presented in the feedback
[26]. These features reduce the potential for pre- and post-randomisation sources of bias
associated with recruitment, baseline assessment activities, exposure to study conditions, and
assessment at follow-up.
Another previously discussed [15] methodological strength of the RAPiD trial is that it
operationalised published recommendations for the design of A&F intervention studies [27].
Specifically, RAPiD adopted “best practices” for A&F components (e.g., data are individualised,
based on recent performance, and new data are presented over time), applied relevant theory
to the development of the written behaviour change intervention [27], and investigated further
optimisation interventions in conjunction with a concurrent process evaluation [28]. The addi-
tion of the qualitative interviews also contributed to the interpretation of the trial results and a
better understanding of how the intervention works. Process evaluation interviews were con-
ducted with 30 purposively sampled dentists from both intervention and control practices.
Most were positive about receiving the intervention and found it useful and easy to understand.
Many reported positive changes in antibiotic prescribing behaviour, both at the individual and
practice level.
While numerous studies [29–34] and reviews [35–37] have evaluated interventions to
enhance prescribing practices, to our knowledge none have evaluated the effects of feedback
A&F interventions on antibiotic prescribing rates in this way and at scale in primary care. All
795 eligible general dental practices across all health boards in Scotland were included in the
trial. With minimal loss to follow-up, we can be confident about the generalisability of the
results.
One potential limitation is the relatively short duration of the trial. Although there is cur-
rently no funding to enable continued delivery of antibiotic prescribing A&F to intervention
group dentists, the use of routinely collected datasets allows evaluation of the sustainability of
the results over a longer period of time. In order to do this, continued access to PRISMS and
MIDAS data has been secured until April 2017, enabling follow-up in the longer term.
The use of routinely collected datasets presents limitations as well as strengths. For example,
as discussed in the published protocol [15], PRISMS collects dispensing rather than prescribing
data, and MIDAS is a repository for remuneration data rather than treatment provided. Claims
for payment for dental treatment are submitted at the end of a course of treatment. In some
instances, a course of treatment may be delivered over a number of weeks, while an antibiotic
may be prescribed and dispensed at any time during this period. Thus, only a proxy measure of
the monthly rate of antibiotic prescribing could be obtained from these datasets.
Importantly, the data used in this study allowed us only to consider effects on the total num-
ber of antibiotic items prescribed. The data did not provide any information about the oral

 health status or presenting condition of the patient. Therefore, although some intervention
group dentists did report positive changes in antibiotic prescribing behaviour, it is possible that
the interventions had no impact or a negative impact on the quality or appropriateness of den-
tists’ antibiotic prescribing. Indeed, although the process evaluation did not identify any unin-
tended consequences or harms, no other exploration of this possibility was carried out, and
some unintended consequences or harms may not have been identified.
The results are important in the context of the global health concern around antibiotic resis-
tance and recent steady increases in antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. Studies
[29,38] in other healthcare settings have demonstrated that reductions in antibiotic prescribing
rates can lead to associated reductions in antimicrobial resistance. The RAPiD trial is a rela-
tively straightforward, low-cost public health and patient safety intervention that could help
the entire healthcare profession address the increasing challenge of antimicrobial resistance.
This study has successfully demonstrated the potential to fully embed RAPiD-style A&F
within routine service delivery. Through its collaborative links with dental healthcare policy-
makers, TRiaDS is currently identifying the best way to take this forward. This will provide a
mechanism to test and evaluate a range of interventions to further improve dentists’ antibiotic
prescribing.
The findings also support the emerging view [39] that multifaceted interventions might not
be more effective than single interventions (as used in our study). The overall reduction in anti-
biotic prescribing observed in the intervention group compared to the control group is similar
in magnitude to that found in multifaceted interventions that use audit and feedback in their
design [29]. It is likely that multifaceted interventions are more complex and costly to deliver
and maintain than the approach adopted in this study.
In conclusion, the rigorous trial design and the theory-based qualitative process evaluation
provide a robust evaluation of A&F in antibiotic prescribing in dental primary care. It has
helped elucidate the mechanisms by which A&F works best and has created a platform for fur-
ther research to adapt and refine the intervention to achieve maximum benefit. This study
paves the way for applying the methodology in different contexts with different target behav-
iours, not only in dentistry but in other healthcare settings as well.
