Summary
Background Climate change poses a dangerous and immediate threat to the health of populations in the UK and 
worldwide. We aimed to model different scenarios to assess the health co-benefits that result from mitigation actions.
Methods In this modelling study, we combined a detailed techno-economic energy systems model (UK TIMES), air 
pollutant emission inventories, a sophisticated air pollution model (Community Multi-scale Air Quality), and 
previously published associations between concentrations and health outcomes. We used four scenarios and focused 
on the air pollution implications from fine particulate matter (PM2·5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone. The 
four scenarios were baseline, which assumed no further climate actions beyond those already achieved and did not 
meet the UK’s Climate Change Act (at least an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050 
compared with 1990) target; nuclear power, which met the Climate Change Act target with a limited increase in 
nuclear power; low-greenhouse gas, which met the Climate Change Act target without any policy constraint on 
nuclear build; and a constant scenario that held 2011 air pollutant concentrations constant until 2050. We predicted 
the health and economic impacts from air pollution for the scenarios until 2050, and the inequalities in exposure 
across different socioeconomic groups.
Findings NO2 concentrations declined leading to 4 892 000 life-years saved for the nuclear power scenario and 
7 178 000 life-years saved for the low-greenhouse gas scenario from 2011 to 2154. However, the associations that we 
used might overestimate the effects of NO2 itself. PM2·5 concentrations in Great Britain are predicted to decrease 
between 42% and 44% by 2050 compared with 2011 in the scenarios that met the Climate Change Act targets, 
especially those from road traffic and off-road machinery. These reductions in PM2·5 are tempered by a 2035 peak 
(and subsequent decline) in biomass (wood burning), and by a large, projected increase in future demand for 
transport leading to potential increases in non-exhaust particulate matter emissions. The potential use of biomass 
in poorly controlled technologies to meet the Climate Change Act commitments would represent an important 
missed opportunity (resulting in 472 000 more life-years lost from PM2·5 in the low-greenhouse gas scenario and 
1 122 000 more life-years lost in the nuclear power scenario from PM2·5 than the baseline scenario). Although 
substantial overall improvements in absolute amounts of exposure are seen compared with 2011, these outcomes 
mask the fact that health inequalities seen (in which socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are among the 
most exposed) are projected to be maintained up to 2050.
Interpretation The modelling infrastructure created will help future researchers explore a wider range of climate policy 
scenarios, including local, European, and global scenarios. The need to strengthen the links between climate change 
policy objectives and public health imperatives, and the benefits to societal wellbeing that might result is urgent.

Introduction
The effects of climate change on human health and 
wellbeing are many and varied, interacting with a wide 
range of the social and environmental determinants of 
health. In the UK, several key short-term risks have 
been identified, from extremes of weather and the 
changing patterns of infectious disease (particularly 
tick-borne disease) to changes in ground-level ozone.1 
The increase in strength and frequency of heatwaves, 
and of floods, are particularly concerning given their 
direct effects on health in the form of cardiovascular 
disease, heat-related mortality, direct injury, and the 
mental health effects that result from disruption to lives 
and livelihoods.1 These health effects alone provide 
reason enough for both enhanced mitigation and 
adaptation activities.
The 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate 
Change2—which assessed the responses to climate 
change with a view to ensuring the highest attainable 
standards of health for populations worldwide—
concluded that “tackling climate change could be the 
greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century” 
and 
recommended 
that

quantification of the health co-benefits and economic

impacts of mitigation decisions was essential in 
promoting a low-carbon transition. Building on these 
foundations, the Lancet Countdown: tracking progress 
on health and climate change3 was formed as an 
independent research collaboration, dedicated to moni-
toring the implementation of the Paris Agreement and 
the health benefits that result through annual publication 
of a series of indicators.
An important example of these health co-benefits is 
improvements in air pollution that result from 
mitigation actions. Poor air quality in the UK has been 
associated with considerable effects on health—the 
Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants 
(COMEAP) estimated a loss of 340 000 life-years, 
equivalent to about 29 000 attributable deaths from fine 
particulate matter (PM2·5) in 2008.4 A figure of 6·5 million 
attributable deaths has been quoted globally.5 PM2·5 is 
responsible for most detrimental health effects, with 
contributions from nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone. 
The role of NO2 is subject to some uncertainty and 
debate.6 Air pollutants have been associated with 
cardiovascular disease in the form of ischaemic heart 
disease and stroke, and causing, or exacerbating, existing 
respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disorder, asthma, lower respiratory tract 
infections, and carcinomas of the respiratory tract.7
The UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act, which requires a 
reduction of at least 80% in greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2050, relative to 1990 concentrations, alongside interim 
carbon budgets agreed up to 2032, represents one of the 
most ambitious legislative instruments to address climate 
change mitigation in the world. In principle, attaining the 
targets under the Climate Change Act could provide large 
reductions in air pollution emissions. However, the 
pathways to attaining the target need to be carefully 
chosen to avoid unnecessary worsening of air pollution 
and its attendant health effects, and in turn, to maximise 
the co-benefits that could arise.8 This project has now 
developed more powerful analytical methods to guide the 
choice of measures that protect human health by 
mitigating both climate change and air pollution, while 
avoiding unintended con 
sequences.
We aimed to supplement the annual indicators 
presented by the Lancet Countdown and support its aims 
by quantifying the substantial opportunity that exists for 
improving public health. We looked at the coordination 
of policies to mitigate climate change and address air 
pollution simultaneously, bringing together detailed data 
and advanced methods and models. We also aimed to 
focus on the health co-benefits that result from mitigation 
actions.
Methods
Modelling the energy scenarios
The air pollution effects on public health in Great Britain 
have been quantified, from modelled concentration 
changes in 2035 and 2050, for a scenario that kept 
2011 air pollutant concentrations constant, and for three 
scenarios generated by the UK TIMES energy system 
model, which is used by the UK Government and the 
Committee on Climate Change to explore pathways to 
the Climate Change Act target.9,10 We used these four 
scenarios in this study. UK TIMES models the UK 
energy system and produces scenarios, for a given set of 
economic and technical parameters, for future sectoral 
energy use in the UK. We used three scenarios: a 
baseline scenario, which does not meet the Climate 
Change Act target and envisages no further climate 
mitigation beyond that already achieved; a nuclear 
replacement scenario, which meets the Climate Change 
Research in context
Evidence before this study 
We searched the peer-reviewed literature on atmospheric 
science, energy policy, and climate change, including 
PubMed. We searched UK Government policy documents on 
air quality, climate change projections, and policy, including 
the reports of the UK Climate Change Committee. Our 
searches covered the period from 1990 to December, 2016. 
We deemed meta-analyses as not appropriate for this work. 
Added value of this study 
For the first time, this study has produced a model that links the 
UK energy system model used by the government and the 
Climate Change Committee with a sophisticated 
chemical-transport model for air quality. We then used the 
resulting concentrations to estimate health impacts and the 
differential exposures in socioeconomic classes. We used a full 
approach with concentration, exposure, and concentration-
response function to estimate the impacts that represent an 
important improvement on the more commonly used damage 
cost approach, which only uses emissions of air pollutants and 
not concentrations or exposures.
Implications of all the available evidence 
The study has shown the need for careful consideration of the 
potential disadvantages of policies to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, in particular the downsides for air quality and public 
health downsides from the promotion of wood-burning in 
small-scale applications. This study also highlighted the fact 
that the projected increase in electric vehicles, a keystone of UK 
policy, will make large reductions in exhaust emissions and 
substantially reduce urban nitrogen dioxide concentrations, the 
subject of current High Court cases in the UK. However, the 
study also indicated that non-exhaust emissions from tyre and 
brake wear might not decrease.

Act target and limits nuclear generation capacity to 2015 
amounts, resulting in no new builds and 2015 station 
replacement only; and a low-greenhouse gas scenario, 
which also meets the Climate Change Act target and 
which has no policy constraint on nuclear build, only 
technical and economic feasibility considerations. 
Regarding the primary energy consumption, both low-
greenhouse gas and nuclear power scenarios have much 
higher concentrations of biomass and biofuels in 2050, 
an important alternative low carbon source of energy to 
replace fossil fuels such as gas and oil (figure 1).
Modelling the emission scenarios
We converted the output from the UK TIMES model into 
an air pollution emission inventory (sulphur dioxide, 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides [NOx], volatile organic 
compounds, PM10, PM2·5, and ammonia) for Great Britain, 
with a 1 km × 
  1 km grid resolution, by providing fuel used 
in petajoules for different industrial or commercial and 
domestic energy sectors or for road vehicles, in billion 
vehicles per km. We then linked this conversion to the 
equivalent sectors of the UK National Atmospheric 
Emissions Inventory (NAEI).11 Emission factor changes, 
representing improvements in the emissions’ perfor-
mance within each sector were based on the 2030 NAEI 
predictions (Misra A, Ricardo-AEA, personal com-
munication), with emission factors remaining constant 
between 2030 and 2050, except for domestic biomass 
emission factors, which changed to comply with the 
European Union’s Ecodesign Directive, and vehicles that 
we assumed to all be Euro 6/VI in 2050, since no plans 
exist to go beyond this standard. Emission factors 
remaining at 2030 amounts for other sources is a 
pragmatic assumption, since creating em 
ission factors for 
all 570 different source sectors between 2030 and 2050 is a 
considerable undertaking. The vehicle non-exhaust 
emission factors are uncertain and as a conservative 
assumption we have kept them the same for all years.
The UK TIMES model only deals with energy 
production, and thus emissions from other sources that 
are important for air pollution need to be added. 
Emissions of ammonia, largely from agriculture, are 
responsible for large amounts of secondary inorganic 
PM2·5 and emissions of solvents are important precursors 
of ozone. We included both emissions of ammonia and of 
solvents when developing the method for this study, 
because these emissions include non-exhaust traffic 
emissions from brake and tyre wear, domestic wood 
burning, cooking, and diesel vehicle volatile organic 
compounds, not previously considered in the UK NAEI. 
Additionally, emissions from Europe are important long-
range determinants of air pollution concentrations in the 
UK. To account for this, we used results from ECLIPSE 
(version 5a),12 chosen because the forecast is both recent 
(from 2016) and includes all the emissions reductions 
agreed under the European Union member states 
National Emissions Ceiling Directive.13
Modelling air quality in the scenarios
We predicted total air quality in Great Britain using the 
Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, 
coupled to the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System 
roads model, a model described as CMAQ-Urban.14–16 
CMAQ-Urban outputs provide hourly air pollution 
concentrations across Europe for every 50 km, every 
10 km for the UK, every 2 km in urban areas, and every 
20 m close to roads. The most detailed 20 m model was 
used in London; Bristol, Swansea, and Cardiff; 
Birmingham; Liverpool and Manchester; Leeds; and 
Glasgow and Edinburgh, and was evaluated against 
80 measurement sites in 2011 and 2012. Meteorological 
fields were derived from the Weather Research and 
Forecasting (WRF) model (version 3.6.1).17 To reflect 2011 
and future climate, the WRF model was driven by 2011 
and future lateral conditions from the global coupled 
carbon–climate Earth System Model 2 developed at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.18 The 
2011 and future chemical boundary conditions for CMAQ 
were derived from the global chemical transport model 
MOZART-4 and the NOAA GFDL-AM3 model.19,20
Predicting the health impacts of future air quality
Modelling the health impacts of climate change 
mitigation policies requires long-term outlooks, because 
pollution changes occur up to and beyond 2050. We used 
the time period 2011–2154 to capture the full effect of the 
changes on life expectancy, allowing lifetime follow-up 
after the concentration changes in 2050. The future 
health impacts across Great Britain were modelled using 
a life table approach developed by Miller and Hurley21 and 
used in previous reports22–25 on the health impacts of air 
pollution. We averaged the modelled air pollution 
concentrations in the 10 km rural and 2 km urban grid 
squares to ward level, and multiplied these concentrations 
by the ward population, summed to local authority, and

divided by the local authority population to give a 
population-weighted mean for each local authority 
(population-weighting ward concen 
trations across the 
local authority and then calculating health impacts at 
local authority level is arithmetically equivalent to 
calculating health impacts for each ward separately). We 
used these population-weighted concen 
trations with the 
concen 
tration-response functions (hazard ratios) and 
local authority mortality, accounting for new births and 
mortality improvement projections, to estimate the health 
outcomes associated with the air pollutants. Accounting 
for these projections represents a substantial improve-
ment on previous air pollution health impact assess-
ments,23–25 and is particularly important given the 
long-term health impact predictions required for climate 
change policies.
Ideally, life table analysis uses population and mortality 
data by 1-year age group. If these data were not publicly 
available at the relevant geographical scale and year, we 
inferred them using data from other geographical scales 
or other years. The starting point was population26,27 and 
mortality (unpublished)28 data for 2011, for each ward by 
gender and 5-year age group. For each gender, we 
calculated the ratio of the data from a single year of age to 
the total across the relevant 5-year age group for the 
different year or geographical scale and used it to partition 
the 2011 5-year age group data at ward level to single years 
of age. For England and Wales, single year of age data 
were available at Lower Super Output Area level for 2012 
(population)29 or 2014 (mortality;30 data were aggregated 
for ward level before calculating the ratio to apply to the 
2011 data). For Scotland, single year of age data were 
available for 2011, partitioned by local authority 
(population)31 or by country (mortality).32,33
Total respiratory deaths for all ages, by local authority, 
were obtained from the Office for National Statistics 
(ONS) for 2011 (2013 for England; unpublished).34–36 We 
then split the local authority respiratory deaths for all 
ages into respiratory deaths by 5-year age groupings, 
using the 2011 ratios of each 5-year age group to total 
respiratory deaths for England, Wales (unpublished), and 
Scotland32 separately. Finally, we partitioned the 
respiratory deaths in each local authority into 1-year age 
groups using ratios of respiratory deaths in 1-year to

then held constant until 2154. We assumed that the 
relative proportions of respiratory deaths and other 
causes of death did not change over time because cause-
specific mortality projections are not available. No 
account was taken of migration, given the diverse 
directions of the forecasts.
We chose concentration-response functions based on 
WHO41 or UK COMEAP42 recommendations because 
these were supported by a range of experts (appendix). 
The concentration-response function linking PM2·5 and 
mortality is based on the study by Pope and colleagues.43 
The summary estimate from 11 studies from Europe and 
North America in a 2013 meta-analysis44 had the same 
hazard ratio43 and was regarded as relatively robust in 
view of the WHO’s report.41 The concentration-response 
function for NO2 impacts on mortality are more 
uncertain. Although based on systematic reviews,44,45 
difficulties exist when separating any independent effect 
of NO2 compared with that of PM2·5.6 For NO2, we 
calculated impacts with and without a cutoff of 5 µg/m³. 
This cutoff was suggested by COMEAP46 as representing 
the lower end of the range of concentrations used in the 
epidemiology studies on NO2. We also calculated short-
term impacts of NO2 and PM2·5, and will report these in a 
separate paper; however, we will report the results for 
short-term impacts of ozone. We used the concentration-
response function for short-term impacts of ozone on 
mortality that was recommended by COMEAP,47 which 
had no threshold or cutoff and was based on a systematic 
review48 of ten time-series studies covering 33 cities 
worldwide. We defined concentration-response functions 
(hazard ratios) per 10 µg/m³ and subsequently modified 
them on the logarithmic scale to give the new change in 
risk for the appropriate population-weighted mean 
concentration.
We assessed the differential exposure to air pollutants in 
different socioeconomic classes using the Carstairs index 
of deprivation (score and quintiles).47 We derived and 
compared the modelled air quality at 10 km rural and 
2 km urban scale, population-weighted for each ward, 
with Carstairs quintiles. The Carstairs index is a small-
area composite indicator of relative socioeconomic 
deprivation, commonly used for epidemiological and 
health analysis.49,50 We calculated the Carstairs 2011 index, 
using 2011 census data, for each ward. We assumed the 
same deprivation patterns observed in 2011 for the 
2035 and 2050 scenarios because relative deprivation 
patterns, such as deprivation quintiles, are fairly stable 
over time.51
Results
All three future scen 
arios saw electric vehicles comprising 
a large proportion of transport in Great Britain in the future 
(including hybrid, hydrogen, and compressed gas-fuelled 
vehicles). As such, concentrations of NO2 in urban areas 
declined substantially (figure 2); although the baseline 
scenario showed large increases in NOx emissions in some 
areas as a result of increases in combined heat and power 
sources.
The population-weighted concentrations of NO2 de-
creased from 14·4 µg/m³ in 2011, to 11·3 µg/m³ in the 
baseline scenario in 2050. These concentrations 
decreased further to 7·1 µg/m³ (51%) and 5·7 µg/m³ 
(60%) in the nuclear power and low-greenhouse gas 
scenarios, respectively. 
Total PM2·5 concentrations decreased by 2050 (figure 3) 
in all three scenarios. The population-weighted mean

anthropogenic PM2·5 concentrations reduced from 
9·3 µg/m³ in 2011, to 5·8 µg/m³ in the baseline scenario 
in 2050, to 5·4 µg/m³ (42%) and 5·2 µg/m³ (44%) in the 
nuclear power and low-greenhouse gas scenarios, 
respectively.
Crucially, the nuclear power (figure 3) and low-
greenhouse gas (data not shown) scenarios both showed 
very large increases in domestic biomass burning and 
large increases in primary PM2·5 (about 75 000 tonnes per 
annum) compared with the baseline scenario (about 
500 tonnes per annum). This source was distributed into 
12 regions, according to UK regional wood use,52 and 
then within each region using a 1 km × 1 km UK 
population, 
which 
resulted 
in 
increased 
PM2·5 
concentrations (figure 3B) and elemental and organic 
aerosol data (figure 3E), therefore having important 
implications for public health.
Large projected increases in car and road freight 
mobility demand, accompanied with an absence of 
regulatory control of non-exhaust vehicle particulate 
matter (PM) emissions, lead to increased non-exhaust 
PM2·5 and PM10 emissions. Consequently, non-exhaust 
emissions are likely to be the dominant source of primary 
PM from vehicles in the future, increasing PM10 by about 
15% compared with 2011 in the nuclear power scenario for 
example. PM2·5 road transport emissions are less affected 
by non-exhaust sources, and for the nuclear power and 
low-greenhouse gas scenarios, PM2·5 drops by 29% 
between 2011 and 2035, but by 2050 is predicted to 
increase by 17% compared with 2035, associated with 
increased non-exhaust emissions.
Ozone concentrations are projected to increase in winter 
because the NOx removal process is reduced through 
reductions in NOx emissions. So-called summer smog 
ozone concentrations are projected to decrease because of 
the reductions in emissions of ozone precursors. The 
population-weighted concentration reductions, compared 
with 2011, for NO2, PM2·5, and ozone in the three scenarios 
are shown in table 1.
We concentrated on comparison of impacts of policy 
scenarios. However, for context, maintaining concen-
trations of PM2·5 as unchanged at 2011 concentrations 
would lead to about 50 million life-years lost across the 
population in Great Britain over 2011–2154.
Reduced long-term exposures (2011–2154) to NO2 in 
both the low-greenhouse gas and nuclear power scenarios 
lead to life-years saved (4 892 000 life-years for the nuclear 
power scenario [with cutoff] and 7 178 000 life-years for the 
low-greenhouse gas scenario [without cutoff]) for all-cause 
mortality rather than lost (table 2, figure 4). However, 
uncertainty exists over how much NO2 itself contributes to 
the effects and how much is from other pollutants,6 such 
as PM2·5 or other traffic-related emissions; the associations 
that we used might overestimate the impact of NO2. 
Because of this uncertainty, the decrease in the effects 
from NO2 does not eliminate the concerns over the PM2·5 
increase from biomass and non-exhaust emissions.
The low-greenhouse gas scenario resulted in 472 000 
more cumulative life-years lost and the nuclear power 
scenario resulted in 1 122 000 more cumulative life-years 
lost from long-term exposures to PM2·5 compared with 
the baseline scenario (table 2). This outcome represents 
an important lost opportunity for better health. It arises 
largely from the increase in biomass burning in these two 
scenarios, with the increase peaking in 2035. The life-
years lost per year from long-term PM2·5 exposure 
illustrate the impact of the large increase in biomass 
(wood burning; figure 5). The life-years lost become 
negative (corresponding to life-years saved) only in the 
period of about 2060 and beyond (figure 5). These 
two scenarios that are compliant with the Climate Change 
Act would still result in around 4 months loss in life 
expectancy from birth in 2011. The analogous results for 
NO2 (figure 4) show, because of the monotonic decrease 
in NO2 concentrations until 2050, that life-years are saved 
throughout almost the whole period.
The increase in domestic biomass burning and in non-
exhaust emissions mean that the reductions in total PM2·5 
and PM10 concentrations in the nuclear power and low-
greenhouse gas scenarios are not as large as they might 
have been without the biomass increase. If the amount of 
primary PM2·5 projected to arise from domestic biomass 
burning was to be avoided, total PM2·5 concentrations 
in 2050 could fall even further than projected, down by 
roughly 50% in the highest areas in 2050 compared with 
about 25% reduction with the increased biomass use.
Figure 4: Changes in life-years due to NO2 concentrations in low-greenhouse gas and nuclear power scenarios
We used 10 km rural per 2 km urban modelling, with relative risk 1·017 per 10 µg/m³, US Environmental Protection 
Agency lag, and Office for National Statistics birth and mortality projections. Negative life-years lost represents a 
decreased impact—ie, life-years gained. Ranges based on the confidence intervals around the concentration-
response function recommended by the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants in 2015,6 varied from 
1·5 times the central estimate to 40% of it, and the ranges overlap to some extent between the two scenarios for 
most of the time period. NO2=nitrogen dioxide.

We have not presented total changes in life-years 
associated with both PM2·5 and NO2 combined because 
there is likely to be some degree of overlap that is poorly 
understood.6 The results for NO2 are best regarded as an 
indicator of the effects of local scale reductions in the 
2011 traffic pollution mixture (including effects of 
NO2 itself), whereas the results for PM2·5 reflect changes 
in regional secondary particles, particle-dominated 
combustion, such as biomass burning with some 
contribution from traffic pollution too.
The long-term ozone exposure metric recommended by 
WHO41 is projected to decrease over time compared 
with 2011 for the baseline scenario, resulting in 1 126 000 life-
years gained compared with 2011 concentrations that 
remain unchanged (table 2). It also decreases for the other 
scenarios, but to a lesser degree. Thus, the low-greenhouse 
scenario resulted in 241 000 life-years lost and the nuclear 
power scenario resulted in 217 000 life-years lost compared 
with the baseline scenario (table 2). This outcome is a 
relatively small change compared with that for the other 
pollutants, due to the WHO threshold of 35 parts per 
billion and the effect being on respiratory mortality, not all-
cause mortality. In contrast to the long-term metric, the 
important short-term ozone exposure metric, annual 
average of daily 8 h maximum ozone, is projected to 
increase in the baseline scenario leading to 25 500 more 
deaths brought forward (aggregated over 2011–50) relative 
to 2011 concentrations being maintained. Again, as for the 
long-term metric, the nuclear power and low-greenhouse 
gas scenarios, compared with the baseline scenario, have 
worse consequences (a greater increase in concentrations 
with 3500 more deaths brought forward [range 1200–5900] 
for the nuclear power scenario and 5000 more deaths 
brought forward [1800–8500] for the low-greenhouse gas 
scenario; aggregated over 2011–50). However, the increased 
proportion of ozone in the mixture of oxidant gases, 
including NO2, is potentially of some concern because 
ozone has a higher redox potential than does NO2, and so 
could possibly increase the hazard from oxidative stress, 
although it is too early to be confident about this theory.
Regarding the social deprivation and inequality issues, 
in all scenarios, NO2 and PM2·5 concentrations were 
significantly correlated with the deprivation score 
(Pearson’s r=0·309 for NO2 and r=0·139 for PM2·5; 
p<0·0001; appendix). The correlations slightly decreased 
in 2050 compared with 2011 values for NO2 but increased 
for PM2·5 (appendix).
Despite substantial reductions in air pollution concen-
trations (figure 3), the most socioeconomically deprived 
are still exposed to higher concentrations in 2050 
(figure 6). Overall, NO2 patterns by deprivation quintile 
suggest that as air pollution concentrations decrease, so 
does the ratio between mean concentrations in most 
deprived wards compared with the least deprived fifth of 
wards in 2011 across Great Britain (appendix). In 2011, 
mean concentrations in the most deprived wards were 
4·3 µg/m³ higher than the least deprived (ratio 1·37; 
appendix). This difference decreased by 2050 in all 
scenarios—eg, to 2·8 µg/m³ in the baseline scenario, 
showing a narrowing in the air pollution inequality gap 
(ratio 1·31). This general pattern varies by region. In 
London, the inequality gap widens in the nuclear power 
scenario, with an NO2 ratio of 1·45 in 2050, compared 
with 1·37 in 2011 (appendix) Similarly in Wales, where 
the ratio between mean NO2 concentrations in most 
deprived compared with the least deprived fifth of wards 
in 2011 increases for all scenarios as NO2 concentrations 
decrease (appendix). PM2·5 inequality patterns are similar 
across Great Britain and also Scotland, Wales, and 
London: as PM2·5 concentrations drop the ratio between 
the most deprived compared with the least deprived fifth 
wards in 2011 increases and the inequality gap widens, 
particularly for the nuclear power scenarios (appendix). 
In 2011, ozone concentrations are marginally higher in 
the least deprived compared with the most deprived fifth 
of wards, with the largest difference in London 
(ratio 0·93; appendix). For all scenarios, this difference 
disappears and concentrations are almost equal in Great 
Britain and separate regions assessed for 2050 (ratio 
between 0·98 and 1·00).
Discussion
Our study shows, through quantitative examples, that 
mitigation policies need to be carefully designed to avoid 
undue increases in harmful air pollution emissions. The 
effects on health of a changing climate and of policies to 
mitigate climate change are many and varied. The effects

of mitigation policies have the potential to make dramatic 
improvements in public health through their parallel 
improvements in air quality. Modelling studies, such as 
ours, are needed to assess fully the public health impacts 
of the air quality changes arising from climate change 
interventions and to inform decisions on optimal policy 
choices.
Concentration-response functions for use in benefit 
assessment of population-based policies are usually based 
on effects in the general population (because exposure is 
reduced for everyone) and on all-cause mortality (to avoid 
misdiagnosis). However, underlying these general public 
health impacts will be increased effects in susceptible 
groups, such as myocardial infarction survivors,52–54 and 
effects on cause-specific mortality, including mortality 
from ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disorder, and lung cancer.7
This paper has concentrated on mortality impacts—
these would dominate the monetised benefits in a cost-
benefit analysis.55 But morbidity impacts are still important 
in terms of effects on quality of life and health-care costs 
and increases and decreases are likely to occur in line with 
the direction of effects on mortality in respiratory and 
cardiovascular hospital admissions, respiratory symp 
toms, 
asthma outcomes, restricted activity days, and other out-
comes with varying degrees of evidence behind them. We 
will report these in a future publication.
With all projections, many uncertainties exist. We 
included both mortality projections and birth projections, 
which is a strength compared with leaving these constant. 
However, many other changes in health outcomes and risk 
factors affecting these outcomes over time are possible. 
We only included these to the extent that projections in 
mortality are extrapolated from past improvements that 
reflect, for example, improvements in medical treatment. 
Climate change itself might change patterns of disease 
and, thus, susceptibility to air pollution. These issues need 
to be kept in mind when interpreting the results.
This work has developed a model system t+hat allows 
the explicit assessment of the potential benefits of climate 
change mitigation interventions, with a state-of-the-art 
energy system and air quality and health impact models. 
At present the system is configured specifically to Great 
Britain but could be extended fairly straightforwardly to 
other countries or regions. Few future energy scenarios 
have been analysed for Great Britain, but this analysis has 
produced results that are important for the future 
development of coordinated policies to mitigate both 
climate change and air pollution. Our results suggest that 
scope is considerable for such coordination to maximise 
the substantial potential benefits to public health which 
could be achieved. Furthermore, although this paper has 
concentrated on air quality changes, analysis of other co-
benefits of climate change policies, such as reductions in 
noise or increases in physical activity, could be integrated 
with our system within the life table analysis. Notably, the 
health impacts of a changing climate per se have not been 
covered in this work because the intention was to compare 
different routes to the same amount of greenhouse gas 
emission reductions. One limitation of our work has been 
the fact that in developing the model we have only been 
able to investigate some illustrative future scenarios. Also,

the absence of projected rates for ethnicity over time meant 
that we were only able to consider deprivation impacts and 
not impacts on ethnic minority groups or combined 
ethnicity-deprivation impacts.
In air quality terms, the reductions in NO2 concen 
tra-
tions are extensive, and although uncertainty exists over 
the quantification of the impact of this pollutant, the 
health effects from NO2 exposure (or other closely 
correlated traffic combustion pollutants, also reduced by 
fleet electrification) should decrease significantly.
The situation for PM2·5 is to some extent clearer in 
terms of quantification of the health impacts in that there 
is more confidence for the concentration-response 
functions. However, the change in the mix of future 
emissions strengthens the need for studies to investigate, 
and health impact methods to account for, the differential 
toxicity of PM components. Although total PM2·5 
concentrations are projected to decrease mainly because 
of reductions in exhaust emissions from vehicles and 
from reductions in the precursors of secondary particles, 
domestic wood burning PM2·5 and non-exhaust emissions 
from road vehicles are projected to increase by relatively 
large amounts. For example, the primary combustion 
from wood burning, which contains a human carcinogen 
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and non-exhaust PM, 
has been suggested from some initial research to cause 
potentially adverse health effects.56
Assessing pollutant mixtures is also important, with 
short-term exposure to ozone remaining a potential 
problem. Studies on the effects of long-term exposure 
to ozone are contradictory and COMEAP42 did not 
recommend quantification. WHO41 did recommend 
quantification but only with a threshold that means effects 
are relatively small compared with PM2·5. Any new evidence 
changing the balance of the effects of long-term and short-
term exposure to ozone would have considerable policy 
implications. The degree of overlap between NO2 and other 
pollutants is crucial in determining net benefits. The 
opposing outcomes of NO2 and some PM2·5 components 
over time might assist in distinguishing pollutant impacts 
in epidemiological studies in the future.
The future scenarios for NO2 indicate a possible 
reduction in the differences between most and least 
deprived populations as measured by the ratios, apart 
from the high biomass 2035 nuclear power scenario. 
This scenario is less clear for PM2·5, for which the ratios 
are indicated to possibly increase. Despite the overall 
reduction in absolute concentrations of air pollution 
exposure across the spectrum of deprivation, differences 
in exposure between the most and least deprived 
populations remain in all future scenarios and for all 
pollutants. This situation is assuming that patterns of 
residence by deprivation classes remain broadly the same 
as for 2011. Addressing these persistent socioeconomic 
differentials must be a core component of climate change 
and air pollution policies if they are to maximise their 
potential for long-term public health benefits.
This research has provided some key messages for 
future climate and air quality policies and has produced a 
tool for investigating optimal pathways to the Climate 
Change Act target, which achieve climate change policy 
goals and minimise the impacts on public health and the 
wider environment. If alternative scenarios involving 
substantial investment in non-biomass energy sources 
were to be considered, their impacts could be modelled 
using the tool we have developed here. Policy oppor-
tunities to achieve healthier environments are clear, but 
challenges remain to improve both environment and 
health for the most vulnerable groups in our societies.
