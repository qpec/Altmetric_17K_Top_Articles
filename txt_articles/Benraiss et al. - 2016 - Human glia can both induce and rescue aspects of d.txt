The causal contribution of glial pathology to Huntington disease (HD) has not been heavily
explored. To define the contribution of glia to HD, we established human HD glial chimeras by
neonatally engrafting immunodeficient mice with mutant huntingtin (mHTT)-expressing
human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs), derived from either human embryonic stem cells or
mHTT-transduced fetal hGPCs. Here we show that mHTT glia can impart disease phenotype
to normal mice, since mice engrafted intrastriatally with mHTT hGPCs exhibit worse motor
performance than controls, and striatal neurons in mHTT glial chimeras are hyperexcitable.
Conversely, normal glia can ameliorate disease phenotype in transgenic HD mice, as striatal
transplantation of normal glia rescues aspects of electrophysiological and behavioural
phenotype, restores interstitial potassium homeostasis, slows disease progression and
extends survival in R6/2 HD mice. These observations suggest a causal role for glia in HD,
and further suggest a cell-based strategy for disease amelioration in this disorder.

 G
lial
pathology
may
contribute
to
a
broad
set
of
neurodegenerative
and
neuropsychiatric
diseases
traditionally considered disorders of solely neuronal
dysfunction1–5. Huntington’s disease (HD) is a prototypic
neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by abnormally long
CAG repeat expansions in the first exon of the Huntingtin gene.
The encoded polyglutamine expansions of mutant huntingtin
(mHTT)
protein
disrupt
its
normal
functions
and
protein–protein
interactions,
ultimately
yielding
widespread
neuropathology, most rapidly evident in the neostriatum. Yet,
despite the pronounced loss of neostriatal medium spiny neurons
(MSNs) in HD, and evidence of glial dysfunction6,7, few studies
have investigated the specific contribution of glial pathology
either to striatal neuronal dysfunction in HD, or more broadly, to
disease phenotype. Our lack of understanding of the role of glial
pathology in HD has reflected the lack of in vivo models that
permit the separate interrogation of glial and neuronal functions
in HD, particularly so in humans. Indeed, this gap in our
knowledge is especially concerning in light of the marked
differences between human and rodent glia; human astrocytes
are larger and more structurally complex than rodent glia, and
influence the actions of vastly more synapses within their
geographic domains8,9. Accordingly, mice neonatally engrafted
with human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs), which develop brains
chimeric for human astroglia and their progenitors10, exhibit
substantially
enhanced
activity-dependent
plasticity
and
learning11.
Yet
the
relatively
greater
role
of
human
astrocytes in neural processing suggests the potential for glial
pathology to wreck especial havoc within human neural circuits,
with attendant implications for the human neurodegenerative
disorders.
In this study, we identified a specific role for human striatal glia
in the pathogenesis of HD, by comparing the behaviour and
MSN physiology of human glial chimeric mice xenografted at birth
with mutant HD-expressing human hGPCs to their normal HTT
hGPC-engrafted controls. In particular, we first compared the
motor behaviour of immunodeficient mice neonatally xenografted
with hGPCs produced from mutant HD (48 CAG) human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs), to that of controls engrafted with
hGPCs derived from a sibling line of unaffected hESCs (18 CAG).
We found that the HD hESC GPC-engrafted mice manifested
impaired motor learning relative to control hGPC-engrafted mice.
On that basis, we then used lentiviral transduction of astrocyte-
biased hGPCs derived from second trimester human forebrain, to
generate lines of hGPCs carrying either normal (23 CAG) or HD
(73 CAG) repeats. To that end, we sorted the fetal tissue samples
for CD44, a hyaluronic acid receptor ectodomain expressed by
astrocyte-biased
glial
progenitor
cells12,
and
infected
the
CD44-immunoselected cells with the lentiviral mHTT vectors.
We then assessed the effects of mouse striatal implantation of these
human mHTT glia on local neuronal physiology, and found that
the striatal neurons of mHTT (73 CAG) glial-engrafted mice
exhibited increased neuronal input resistance and excitability,
relative to those of mice engrafted with normal HTT (23 CAG)-
transduced striatal glia.
On that basis, we then asked if neonatal chimerization with
normal glia might delay disease progression in R6/2 transgenic
HD mice13. We found that the substantial replacement of
diseased striatal glia with wild-type (WT) CD44 þ human glia
indeed resulted in a slowing of disease progression, and a
corresponding increment in survival in transplanted R6/2 mice.
This was associated with a transplant-associated fall in neuronal
input resistance, and a corresponding drop in interstitial K þ in
the R6/2 striatum. Together, these studies suggest both a critical
role for glial pathology in the progression of HD, and the
potential for glial cell replacement as a strategy for its treatment.
Results
Glia were generated from hESCs expressing mHtt. We pre-
viously developed a high-efficiency protocol for generating GPCs
and their derived astroglia and oligodendrocytes from both hESCs
and induced pluripotential cells14. Neonatal engraftment of these
cells into immunodeficient mice yields human glial chimeric mice,
in which substantially all GPCs and a large proportion of astrocytes
are of patient-specific, human donor origin. Using this approach,
we first sought to generate GPCs from huntingtin mutant
pluripotential cells, and to then establish human glial chimeras
with those cells, as a means of assessing the specific effects of
human huntingtin mutant glia on striatal function.
To that end, we used huntingtin mutant hESCs, the GENEA 20
line bearing a 48 CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the
HTT gene along with a normal 17 CAG allele, as well as its
matched sibling control, GENEA 19, which has normal 18 and 15
CAG repeat lengths in exon 1 (ref. 15). These lines were derived
from blastocysts produced from the same parents, and were thus
fraternal twins. We then induced GPCs from these hESC lines,
using our described protocol14. When collected after an average
in vitro propagation of 200 days of glial induction (range of
160–240), an average of 56.0±4.6% of normal (GENEA 19) and
45.8±7.0% of huntingtin mutant (GENEA 20) cells expressed the
bipotential
astrocyte–oligodendrocyte
progenitor
marker
PDGFaR/CD140a (ref. 16). The remainder were almost entirely
CD44þ/CD140a �
cells,
which
typify
astroglia
and
their
progenitors12.
Immunostaining revealed that o1% of cells
expressed either the neuronal antigens HuC/D or MAP2, and
pluripotency-associated gene expression was undetectable by either
immunocytochemistry or quantitative PCR. Thus, the grafted cells
were comprised
almost
entirely of CD44-defined astroglial
progenitors and bipotential oligodendrocyte–astrocyte GPCs. The
GENEA 20- and GENEA 19-derived glia were neonatally engrafted
bilaterally into the neostriata of rag1� / � immunodeficient mice
(n ¼ 38 and 35, respectively), to establish mHtt human glial
chimeras and their normal human glial controls.
Chimerization yielded host colonization by mHttþ human glia.
On weaning, the human glial chimeric mice were then randomly
assigned to matched groups for either serial analysis of their motor
performance by rotarod, or for serial sacrifice for histological
analysis as a function of age. Histological analysis revealed that the
striata of these mice rapidly and efficiently engrafted with donor
hESC-derived hGPCs (Fig. 1a,b and Table 1). The donor cells first
expanded to pervade the host striata as persistent hGPCs, in part
replacing the resident murine GPCs in the process (Fig. 1c–f).
A fraction of the donor cells then differentiated as astroglia,
especially so in striatal white matter tracts. Fibrous astrocytes
appeared early, and were arrayed densely within striatal white
matter tracts by 6–8 weeks after neonatal graft, whereas striatal
protoplasmic astrocytes appeared later, and were first apparent in
significant numbers only by 12 weeks (Fig. 1g,h). Over the weeks
thereafter, the host striatal hGPCs were substantially replaced by
human donor cells, whether by HD hESC-derived hGPCs or their
normal sibling-derived hGPCs; in each case, hGPCs were typically
the dominant population by 20 weeks, and few if any murine GPCs
remained in any of the engrafted striata after 40 weeks (Fig. 1c,d).
Transplanted cells did not differentiate into neurons, as evidenced
by their lack of expression of either MAP2 or NeuN, two distinct
markers of mature neuronal phenotype. No evidence of tumour
formation or aberrant differentiation of these hESC-derived GPCs
was noted in any of the mice in this study.
Motor performance was impaired in mHtt glial chimeras.
Among the 109 mice assigned to rotarod assessment of motor

 performance, those chimeric for HD mHTT hESC (GENEA20)-
derived glia manifested significantly slowed motor learning
compared with littermates chimerized with normal HTT GPCs
(GENEA19).
In
particular,
the
GENEA20-derived
mHtt
glial chimeras manifested significant decrements in motor
coordination relative to three independent control groups that
included: (1) GENEA19 GPC-derived chimeric controls; (2)
uninjected controls; and (3) saline-injected controls (Fig. 2).
The difference between mHTT and all control glial chimeras was
evident by 12 weeks of age, and persisted through 36 weeks of
observation, with no significant improvement in the performance
of the mHTT GPC-engrafted mice during that 24-week period
(Supplementary Table 2). The relative lack of improvement in
rotarod performance by the mHTT hGPC-engrafted mice
suggested an mHTT glial-mediated deficit in motor learning, as
well as in motor performance, that became increasingly manifest
with age and maturation.
MSNs were hyperexcitable in the presence of mHtt glia. To
better understand the physiological basis for the relatively
impaired motor performance of mHtt glial-engrafted mice, we
next asked whether chimerization with mHtt-expressing glia
influenced the physiology of MSNs. To that end, we established
striatal glial chimeras in otherwise WT immunodeficient mice, via
neonatal intrastriatal injection of mHtt-expressing human fetal
glia.
For
this
purpose,
we
used
mHTT-transduced
fetal
tissue-derived hGPCs rather than HD hESC-derived GPCs, so as
to assess the effects of mHtt bearing longer CAG repeats than the
48Q
mHtt expressed
by GENEA 20-derived hGPCs.
We
postulated that longer CAG repeat expansions would accelerate
glial pathology, and thus potentiate detection of paracrine
neuronal dysfunction at the relatively young ages and compressed
experimental time frames used in this study. To that end, we
isolated hGPCs from 18- to 20-week human fetal forebrain, using
immunomagnetic sorting directed against CD44, which as noted
is highly expressed by astrocyte-biased glial progenitor cells12. We
then transduced these cells with a lentiviral vector encoding the
first exon of the HTT gene bearing either mutant (73Q) or
normal (23Q) huntingtin, each upstream to an enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter, and then injected
the transduced cells into the striata of neonatal rag1 � / �
immune-deficient mice. The mice were killed 12 weeks later
and striatal slices were prepared; human GFP þ glial-rich regions
were imaged by two-photon microscopy, and their resident
striatal neurons patch clamped using previously described
methods17.
Subsequent
histology
and
immunolabelling
confirmed the dense engraftment of the recorded striata with
human donor cells, in both the Q23 and Q73 mHtt hGPC-
engrafted striata, whose extents of donor cell engraftment were
indistinguishable at the 12-week time point at which recordings
were obtained (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of note, whereas the
distributions of Q23 and Q73 mHtt-transduced glia did not differ
in engrafted chimeras (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and their relative
densities similarly did not significantly differ (Supplementary
Fig. 1E), the Q73 mHtt glia could be recognized by cytoplasmic
Htt aggregates, in vivo as well as in culture (Supplementary
Fig. 1A–C,H); the Q23-transduced controls manifested no such
aggregate formation.
Physiologically, neurons in striata engrafted with 73Q mHtt
glia manifested significantly higher input resistance relative to
those engrafted with either 23Q HTT- or EGFP-only transduced
control glia, and required significantly fewer current injections to
fire action potentials relative to control glia-engrafted mice
(Fig. 3a,b; also Supplementary Fig. 2). The higher input resistance
of these neurons was manifest in their current–voltage (I–V)
curves as well (Fig. 3c), and suggested the significant relative
hyperexcitability of striatal neurons in an mHtt-glial environment
(Fig. 3d). This was also reflected by the less-negative resting
membrane potentials of striatal neurons recorded in 73Q

untransduced hGPC-engrafted ( � 80.5±0.51 mV) and unen-
grafted ( � 81.1±0.94 mV) controls (F[3,35] ¼ 17.0; Po0.0001
(Fig. 3e); sample sizes and post hoc test results noted in 3E,
statistical summary in Supplementary Table 3A). The I–V curves
of the recorded MSNs showed typical inwardly rectifying
currents, which were also seen in the input resistance at
hyperpolarization and depolarization currents (Fig. 3f; statistical
summary in Supplementary Table 3B). Interestingly, despite their
higher Vm and hyperexcitability in response to current injection,
neither the frequency (Fig. 3f,g) nor amplitude (Fig. 3f,h) of either
the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents
(sEPSCs) or
miniature EPSCs of striatal neurons within 73Q glial chimeric
striata differed significantly from those of striatal neurons in 23Q-
engrafted or unengrafted controls (Fig. 3g,h).
Colonization by normal glia slowed disease course in HD mice.
Since engraftment of normal striata with mHtt-expressing GPCs
impaired striatal neuronal function and physiology, we next asked
whether the reverse might be true, that is, if neonatal engraftment
of the HD striata with normal glia might rescue aspects of HD
phenotype. To this end, we engrafted normal human GPCs
into the striata of newborn R6/2 (120 CAG) mice13, which
transgenically express a mutant exon 1 of the HTT gene, and
typically die by 20 weeks of age. For this experiment, astrocyte-
biased GPCs were isolated from 18- to 22–week-gestational age
fetal human brain using magnetic activated cell sorting targeting
CD44,
as
noted
above
(Supplementary
Fig.
3A)12.
The
CD44-sorted cells were then transplanted into the striata of
newborn R6/2 � rag1 � / � mice, using an injection protocol
previously described for use in neonatal callosal injection18
(Supplementary Fig. 3B–E), but instead targeting the striata.
Striatal engraftment of the R6/2 mice by CD44-sorted hGPCs was
robust (Fig. 4a,b), and achieved densities of 415,000 human cells
per mm3 by 16 weeks of age (Fig. 4c and Table 2), with
substantial replacement of resident mouse HD astroglia with
normal
HTT-expressing
human
counterparts,
as
we
have
previously reported in WT murine hosts10. The human CD44-
sorted glia integrated as both astrocytes (Fig. 4d and Table 2) and
as persistent GPCs (Fig. 4e,f and Table 2), but not as neurons
(Fig. 4g). Importantly, the integrated human cells did not
manifest detectable HTT aggregates; the staining patterns of
HTT and human nuclear antigen were always entirely non-
overlapping (Fig. 4h). As such, we saw no evidence of HTT
protein transmission from host to donor cells over the time frame
studied. While there was a net weight loss in diseased mice as
function of time (8- and 16-week-old mice), no change of weight
as
function
of
engraftment
was
noticed

The

R6/2
mice
displayed
significantly
delayed
motor
deterioration
relative
to
their
untreated controls, as assessed by their performance on a
constantly accelerating rotarod. Linear regression revealed that
the rate of motor deterioration was significantly slowed in the
hGPC

mice,
relative
to
untreated
and
sham-treated controls (F ¼ 4.8 [2, 124 d.f.]; Po0.001) (Fig. 5a
and Supplementary Table 5).
On that basis, we next asked if the performance enhancement
associated with engraftment by normal glia might be sufficient to
influence the survival of R6/2 (120 CAG) mice. We found that
R6/2 (120Q) � rag1 � / � mice whose striata were neonatally
transplanted with normal human glia survived significantly
longer than unengrafted mice, with a mean increase in lifespan
of 12 days (hGPC-engrafted, n ¼ 29; untreated, n ¼ 28; Po0.01,
Mantel–Cox Log-rank test; Fig. 5b). This survival effect was no
different between males and females among the in hGPC-
engrafted R6/2 mice (statistical summary in Supplementary
Table 6).
The functional benefits of R6/2 striatal chimerization with
normal glia were accompanied by preservation of striatal structure
as well. Stereological assessment of gross striatal volume revealed
that CD44þ hGPC-engrafted mice manifested significantly less
striatal involution than their unengrafted controls (Fig. 5c). This
decreased rate of striatal atrophy suggested a relative preservation
of striatal neuropil, which was both substantial and statistically
significant by 20 weeks of age (F (2, 25) ¼ 12.84, P ¼ 0.0001 by

 two-way ANOVA). By that point, the mean striatal volume of
hGPC-engrafted R6/2 mice was significantly larger than that of
unengrafted R6/2 mice (P ¼ 0,007 with Tukey’s multiple compar-
ison tests; Supplementary Table 7), and only marginally less than
that of WT mice (WT mice: 7.5±0.1 mm3; R6/2 untreated:
4.7±0.4 mm3; R6/2-hGPC: 6.3±0.6 mm3 (mean±s.e.m.)). Thus,
neonatal hGPC transplantation was associated with significantly
increased striatal volumes in R6/2 mice, which was substantial and
significant by 20 weeks of age (Fig. 5c).
Normal glia improved the behaviour and cognition of R6/2 mice.
We next asked whether striatal engraftment with CD44-defined
hGPCs was sufficient to improve cognitive and motor function by
HD mice. To this end, we neonatally transplanted a large cohort
of R6/2 mice with bilateral intrastriatal injections of 50 � 104
CD44-sorted
hGPCs
(Supplementary
Table
1).
Both
the
transplanted and control mice were then sent to an independent
contract research organization, Psychogenics, Inc., which used a
multimodal behavioural platform to compare the behavioural
repertoires of the hGPC-engrafted and control mice, the identities
to which Psychogenics staff were blinded. This platform included
two proprietary batteries, called Smartcube, a battery of cognitive
end points19, and Neurocube, a battery of motor functional end
points19. A third separate test, the procedural water T-maze,
was also included. The individual functional elements of these
testing paradigms were represented in the aggregate by a single
interpolated value, which permitted group comparisons across all
endpoints with a form of principal component analysis (PCA).
PCA revealed that across test modalities, the R6/2 mice could
be
readily
distinguished
from
both
their
WT
uninjected
and sham-injected controls (Fig. 6a–d). PCA further revealed
that hGPC transplants were associated with at least a partial
restoration of normal behavioural end points in multiple domains
(Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). While the component composition
of the overall PCA is proprietary, single-behavioural end points
could be identified and extracted post hoc; these are reported
separately
in
Supplementary
Figs
4
and
5,
which
show
behavioural tests in which hGPC-engrafted R6/2 mice are notably
less impaired than their unengrafted controls.

fetal human glia transduced to overexpress mHTT. (a) Example of a host striatal neuron, filled with Alexa-594 after recording, surrounded by EGFP-tagged
donor-derived glia. (b) Representative action potentials recorded in response to current injection in host neurons in striata chimerized with 73Q
mHTT (n ¼ 8)- and 23Q HTT (n ¼ 12)- expressing hGPCs. Striatal neurons of mice engrafted with 73Q mHTT human glia required significantly fewer
current injections to achieve voltage thresholds for firing, than did those engrafted with 23Q HTT-transduced or either EGFP-only (n ¼ 8) transduced or
untreated (n ¼ 8) control glia. (c) Current–voltage curves (I–V curves) of neurons in 23Q HTT- and 73Q mHTT-expressing hGPC-engrafted mice, reflect the

 This analysis first revealed that disease-associated hyperactivity
in R6/2 mice was moderated by neonatal hGPC graft. SmartCube
showed a significant difference between sham-treated WT and
R6/2 mice at 8 (91%, Po0.0002) and 11 weeks (92%, Po0.00001)
of age (Supplementary Fig. 4). At both ages, relative improvement
was noted as a result of hGPC treatment, although this effect
failed to achieve significance in the older of the two R6/2
groups (36%, Po0.02; and 19%, P ¼ 0.068, respectively). Analysis
of the top features that contributed to the disease signatures
showed that at 8 weeks of age, sham-treated R6/2 mice were
somewhat hyperactive compared with sham-treated WT mice,
showing increased sniffing/scanning (P ¼ 0.0003), locomotion
(P ¼ 0.0083) and rearing (P ¼ 0.0022). Some of these changes
were attenuated in hGPC-treated R6/2 mice, which exhibited less
locomotion (Po0.0001) and rearing (P ¼ 0.0003) relative to
sham-treated R6/2 mice. At 11 weeks of age disease-associated
hyperactivity subsided, with no significant differences between
sham-treated WT and R6/2 in locomotion, rearing or scanning/
sniffing. At both 8 and 11 weeks, R6/2 mice groomed less than
WT mice (P ¼ 0.0003), a phenotype not rescued by hGPC.
Overall, these results are consistent with a prodromal hyperactive
phase described in studies of young R6/2 and R6/1 mice20–22,
which we found here to be tempered by hGPC treatment.
Our analysis next revealed that age-dependent gait deficits in
R6/2 were partially rescued by hGPC treatment. NeuroCube

 significant deficit in motor performance relative to untreated
controls (80%, Po0.0001), and that neonatal chimerization with
normal hGPCs was associated with significant phenotypic rescue
(60%,
P ¼ 0.038;
Supplementary
Fig.
5).
Analysis
of
top
features showed no significant differences at 8 weeks between
sham-treated WT and R6/2 mice in speed, stride length or
duration of stride or swing. Yet by 11 weeks, while average speed
remained constant across groups, the sham-treated R6/2 mice
showed significant deficits in stride length (Po0.0001) and
duration (P ¼ 0.037), as well as in the duration of swing phase
(P ¼ 0.001), which were significantly, though incompletely,
corrected by hGPC treatment (Po0.0001, o0.01 and o0.0001,
respectively).
Interestingly,
hGPC
treatment
reduced
body
movement
variability
in
both
WT
and
R6/2
groups,
an
HD-independent effect (P ¼ 0.003).
In addition to the SmartCube and NeuroCube analyses of these
mice, we also assessed their performance in the water T-maze,
and found that the performance of R6/2 mice in this test was
improved markedly by hGPC transplant. In this procedural water
T-maze test, mice need to learn to swim to a side platform. We
found that untreated 9-week-old R6/2 mice chose the correct side
less frequently (Po0.0001) and reached the platform more
slowly (Po0.0001) than WT mice (either sham-injected or
hGPC-injected) Fig. 6e–g. In contrast, neonatal intrastriatal
hGPC engraftment partially rescued this deficit, in that chimeric
R6/2 mice performed better than their sham-operated R6/2
counterparts, making more correct choices in the initial session
(P ¼ 0.007), and with more mice reaching criterion during initial
training (P ¼ 0.016; Fig. 6e,f). At 13 weeks of age, deficits in
choice accuracy were again apparent in sham-treated R6/2 mice
relative to WT mice (Po0.0001), and in the percentage of mice
reaching criterion (Po0.0001). Choice accuracy was improved in
hGPC-treated R6/2 (relative to sham-treated R6/2) by the third
and forth sessions (Po0.02). The latency to reach the escape
platform was also significantly improved by hGPC treatment in
the last three sessions, suggesting not only a cognitive but also a
motor improvement (Fig. 6g).
R6/2 MSN physiology was altered by normal glia. To assess the
physiological basis of the improved function and survival of R6/2
mice engrafted with human glia, we next asked whether
chimerization with normal glia influenced the physiology of
resident R6/2 striatal neurons. This experiment, examining the
effects of a normalized glial environment on HD MSNs, provided
a corollary to our prior experiment, in which normal MSNs
were evaluated in an HD glial environment. To this end, 19
immunodeficient rag1 � / � � R6/2 (120 CAG) newborns were
either engrafted (n ¼ 8) or not (n ¼ 11) with CD44-sorted hGPCs;
12 weeks later, they were killed and slice preparations taken,
and MSNs patch-clamped. In addition, 18 WT � rag1 � / � mice
were assessed, 7 of which had been neonatally engrafted with
CD44-sorted hGPCs and 11 of which were unengrafted controls.
Successful engraftment of the recorded striata by human donor
cells was verified histologically after recording. Mice that
displayed poor engraftment, defined as o1,000 human nuclear
antigen þ cells per mm3, were removed from the study (versus an
average of 410,000 cells per mm3 in successful grafts; see
Tables 1 and 2).
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording from both WT and R6/2
striatal
neurons
showed
inward
rectifier
currents
as
the
membrane potential was between � 115 and � 45 mV, and
more rectification was found in R6/2 neurons (Fig. 7a). Similarly,
with the current-clamp configuration, we found that the input
resistance Rinput of R6/2 striatal neurons was significantly higher
than that of their WT controls, as has been previously
reported23,24. Significantly though, we found that the R6/2
neuron Rinput in the range of positive membrane potentials was
lower in the presence of engrafted normal human CD44-derived
glia (Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Table 8A). These results
indicate that the intrinsic excitability of striatal neurons in R6/2
mice was increased relative to that of WT neurons, and could be
moderated by the engraftment of human CD44-derived glia. In
addition, whereas the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly lower
in R6/2 � rag1 � / �
striatal neurons than in rag1 � / �
WT
controls, the sEPSC frequency of CD44-engrafted R6/2s was
restored to levels not significantly different from those WT
controls (Fig. 7d,e and Supplementary Table 8B). The apparent

Figure 5 | Chimerization with normal glia slows motor loss and extends

 change in presynaptic inputs to R6/2 neurons likely reflected
decreased release probability, since the frequency of miniature
EPSCs
also
exhibited
a
trend
towards
disease-associated
reduction and graft-associated recovery (Fig. 7d,e). While the
EPSC amplitude of R6/2 striatal neurons was unaffected by
chimerization (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Table 8C), the lower
frequency of sEPSCs in the R6/2 MSNs, and their partial
restoration by engrafted normal glia, was consistent across the
spectrum of EPSC amplitudes (Fig. 7g). Of note, engraftment
with
normal
CD44-defined
glia
had
no
effect
on
any
electrophysiological measure in otherwise normal rag1 � / � WT
mice; only in R6/2 mice did glial engraftment affect input
resistance and sEPSC frequency.
Normal glia reduced interstitial K þ in the HD striatum. A
number of studies have implicated dysfunction of neuronal
potassium channels in the HD striatum23,24, and the contribution
of defective glial potassium uptake to HD pathogenesis6.
Astrocytes play an important role in buffering K þ released
during synaptic transmission25–27. If astrocytic K þ uptake is
impaired, then interstitial K þ rises, and the transmembrane
gradient
for
K þ
is
decreased,
resulting
in
the
relative
depolarization,
and
hence
increased
excitability,
of
local
neurons25,28. The increased membrane resistance of WT MSNs
in mHtt (73Q) glial chimeras suggested precisely such a defect in
potassium handling by mHtt-expressing human glia (Fig. 3d–f).
On that basis, we next used potassium microelectrodes to ask
whether the hyperexcitability and increased membrane resistance
of R6/2 striatal neurons was associated with elevated interstitial
K þ in vivo. We found that the levels of interstitial K þ were
indeed significantly higher in R6/2 mice than in WT littermates,
when assessed at 16 weeks of age (Fig. 8): Whereas WT
mice
maintained
extracellular
striatal
K þ
at
a
level
of
3.13±0.08 mM (mean±s.e.m.; n ¼ 7 mice), R6/2 striatal K þ
levels were significantly higher, averaging 3.77±0.04 mM (n ¼ 8;
Po0.0001, ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s tests; Supplementary
Table 9).
We next asked whether the disease-associated elevation in
extracellular K þ might then be attenuated by colonization with
engrafted normal glial cells, and whether that might account for
the partial restoration of normal membrane resistance and firing
thresholds observed in R6/2 mice transplanted with normal glia.
This indeed proved to be the case, in that the R6/2 striata
neonatally engrafted with normal CD44 þ hGPCs manifested
significantly and substantially lower levels of interstitial K þ
(3.31±0.10 mM; n ¼ 7 mice) than their unengrafted R6/2
littermates (3.77±0.04 mM, n ¼ 8; as noted above) (P ¼ 0.0007;
Supplementary Table 9). The reduction in K þ afforded by
glial chimerization occurred only in R6/2 striata; WT mice
transplanted with CD44 þ GPCs manifested extracellular K þ
levels
no
different
than
their
untransplanted
littermates
(3.32±0.06 versus 3.13±0.08 mM, respectively) (Fig. 8).

Figure 6 | Treatment with hGPCs partially rescues disease signatures in
SmartCube and NeuroCube and improved cognitive deficit in T-maze. To
build a two-dimensional representation of the multidimensional space in
which the groups are best separated, we first find statistically independent
combinations of the original features, pick the two new composite features
(axes 1 and 2) that best discriminate between the groups, and used them as
x and y axes. Each dot represents a mouse. The centre, small and large
ellipses are the mean, s.e. and s.d. of the composite features for each group.
The distance and overlap between the groups are used to calculate the
discrimination index, which indicates how reliably a classifier can be trained
to discriminate between the two groups. (a) SmartCube showed a
significant difference between sham-treated WTand R6/2 mice (91%) at 8
weeks of age. There was a significant functional preservation (36%) in
hGPC-treated versus untreated R6/2 mice. (b) At 11 weeks of age there was
also a significant R6/2-associated deficit (92%), with a marginally
significant recovery (19%) in response to hGPC treatment. (c) In
NeuroCube, R6/2 mice had a marginally significant deficit (66%) and
therefore no significant recovery by hGPC treatment could be measured.
(d) However, at 11 weeks of age, a significant deficit (88%) and recovery
(46%) by hGPC treatment was noted. The improvement of motor and
cognitive behaviour of hGPC-engrafted R6/2 mice was also manifest in the
T-maze test. (e) R6/2 mice chose the correct arm fewer times than WT
mice over training at 8 weeks of age and again when retrained at 13 weeks
of age (as compared with the sham-treated WT mice). GPC-treated R6/2
mice showed better performance than sham-treated R6/2 mice in specific
sessions at both ages. (f) Fewer R6/2 than WT mice reached criterion
(6 out of 8 correct trials per day for 3 consecutive days) during training and
again during retraining at the older age. hGPC treatment improved
acquisition in R6/2 mice during the initial training phase. (g) R6/2 mice
were slower than WT mice to reach the platform during training and
retraining. hGPC treatment improved performance during retraining.

 Discussion
A number of recent reports have highlighted the contribution of
glial cells to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders,
most particularly in the spinal cord, in which glial pathology
has been implicated in the course of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis1,2,4,5. In this study, we asked whether glia might
contribute to the genesis and progression of HD, a protoypic
neurodegeneterative disorder of the brain. We found that mice
whose
striata
were
engrafted
with
GPCs
derived
from
mHtt-expressing
hES
cells
(48Q)
manifested
significantly
slowed motor learning than littermates chimerized with normal
(18Q) GPCs derived from an unaffected sibling (Fig. 2). Using
mice chimerized with human fetal striatal tissue-derived glia
(73Q), we then found that MSNs resident in that HD glial
environment
were
more
excitable
than
those
engrafted
with control glia (23Q), and manifested neurophysiological
abnormalities previously noted in HD MSNs, both in vitro7 and
within the striata of R6/2 HD mice24 (Fig. 3). On the basis of this
glial-mediated
recapitulation
of
HD-associated
striatal
dysfunction, we then asked whether the introduction of normal,
healthy glia into the HD environment might slow disease
progression. We found this to be the case, in that striatal
chimerization of R6/2 mice (120Q) with normal fetal human glial
cells was associated with significantly increased survival (Fig. 5), a
slower rate of motor deterioration, partial rescue of behavioural
abnormalities (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), partial

 normalization of MSN physiology (Fig. 7) and significant
restoration of local K þ homeostasis (Fig. 8). Together, these
observations implicate glial pathology in the pathogenesis and
progression of HD, and strongly suggest that colonization of
diseased striata with healthy glia may be a viable strategy for
slowing disease progression in HD.
Previous studies have highlighted the abnormal physiology of
R6/2 mouse MSNs, which are characterized by a relatively
depolarized
resting
membrane
potential,
increased
input
resistance and an increased threshold for excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (EPSPs)24. We found that the MSNs of mice neonatally
chimerized with mHtt-transduced human glia (73Q) exhibited
features
of
these
same
abnormalities,
and
had
response
characteristics remarkably similar to those previously reported
for R6/2 MSNs24. As a corollary then to these toxic effects of
mHtt glia on normal MSNs, we postulated that WT glia might be
capable of rescuing pathology in R6/2 neurons. This prediction
that was borne out with the increased survival of R6/2 mice
engrafted with WT hGPCs, as well as by the improved physiology
of
R6/2
neurons
in
the
WT
glial
striatal
environment.
In
particular,
while
striatal
neurons
in
R6/2 � rag1 � / �
immunodeficient mice manifested the expected high input
resistances and low sEPSP frequencies of R6/2 mice, those
engrafted with normal CD44-sorted glia exhibited a significant
reduction in input resistance and a significant increase in EPSP
frequency, to levels not significantly different from WT controls
(Fig. 7a,b). Notably though, whether the restoration of these
physiological parameters, and more broadly the improved motor
performance and survival increments associated with WT glial
engraftment, is due to donor-derived astroglia or persistent glial
progenitor cells remains unclear, since CD44 isolates both
phenotypes,
and
the
resultant
glial
chimeras
are
heavily
colonized with each. That said, the support of striatal function
afforded
by
CD44 þ
astroglia
and
their
progenitors
was
consistent and substantial.
A number of previous studies have reported the hyper-
excitability of MSNs in HD, and several have pointed to defects in
potassium conductance and potassium channel expression as
contributing to both the hyperexcitability and increased input
resistance of HD striatal neurons23,24. Among other functions,
astroglia are tasked with the uptake of K þ from the brain’s
interstitial and synaptic spaces, into which K þ flows in the
setting of neuronal depolarization28,29. If K þ uptake is impaired,
then the transmembrane gradient for K þ is decreased, resulting
in the increased excitability of local striatal neurons. Khakh and
colleagues ascribed these findings to defects in astrocytic Kir 4.1
channel expression in HD mice6, while Levine and colleagues
have highlighted the contribution of neuronal downregulation of
Kir2.1, Kir2.3 and Kv2.1 to the hyperexcitability of MSNs23. It
seems unlikely that the loss of any one of these channels would be
sufficient to produce HD pathology, as they manifest considerable
functional redundancy, but the concurrent downregulation of a
number of inwardly rectifying K þ channels across both neurons
and glia might be expected to exert significant pressure on striatal
K þ homeostasis. As such, our observation of hyperexcitability by
normal MSNs resident in an HD glial chimeric environment
suggests that the pathological activation patterns of R6/2 MSNs
might be substantially non-cell autonomous, and elicitable in
otherwise normal neurons when those neurons are faced with
defective local glial potassium uptake. Indeed, it was the apparent
dependence of MSN hyperexcitability on glial K þ dysregulation6,
as well as the coincident observation that HD-related muscle
hyperexcitability similarly reflects poor K þ conductance30, which
suggested that local K þ
gradients, and thus MSN firing
thresholds, might be restored by colonization with WT glia.
Together, these data suggest a significant role for glial
dysfunction in HD pathogenesis, and hence the potential value
of glial replacement in HD therapeutics. The mHtt human glial
chimeric mouse model established here permitted us to evaluate
the mechanisms of neurotoxicity of mHtt-expressing glia on
normal neostriatal neurons. Furthermore, our model allowed us
to isolate and investigate the non-cell autonomous component of
HD neuropathology, and to do so in a humanized glial context, as
opposed to the transgenic rodent context in which artefactually
longer polyglutamine expansions are expressed by neurons
and glia alike. Using this strategy, we established that a
significant degree of protection may be offered to vulnerable
mHtt-expressing
neurons
by
an
improved
striatal
glial
environment, strongly suggesting the therapeutic potential of a
glial replacement strategy in HD. Our finding that interstitial
potassium levels are higher in the R6/2 striatum than in its
WT counterpart, and may be substantially normalized by
chimerization with normal glia (Fig. 8), further highlights the
potential of glial cell replacement as a means of ameliorating
HD-related pathology. As such, our data lend strong support to
the possibility of transplanting normal glial progenitor cells into
the HD striatum, both as for the treatment of manifest HD, and
as a means to delay disease appearance in premanifest cases.
Indeed, given the success in animal models of strategies
developed to trigger the production of new striatal neurons from
resident neural stem cells31, which have substantially extended
the survival of R6/2 mice17,32,33, we may postulate that the
combination of induced neuronal replacement with WT glial
engraftment may act synergistically to preserve function in the
diseased HD striatum. In concert with complementary strategies,
such as genetic correction of mHTT alleles in patient-derived
induced pluripotential cells before their induction as glial
progenitors34,
which
might
then
permit
the
delivery
of
autologous glial progenitors35, these advances may enable
clinically
meaningful
therapeutic
options
for
this
hitherto
underserved and untreatable patient population.
Methods
Isolation of fetal human astroglial progenitor cells. Human fetal brain tissue
was obtained from aborted fetuses (18–22 weeks gestational age), with maternal
consent and under protocols approved by the University of Rochester-Strong
Memorial Hospital Research Subjects Review Board. Briefly, forebrain tissue was
minced and dissociated using papain and DNase as previously described36–38,
always within 2 h of extraction. The dissociated cells were maintained overnight in
DMEM/F12/N1-based medium supplemented with 10 ng ml � 1 FGF2.
Astrocyte-biased glial progenitor cells were isolated from the tissue dissociates
using magnetic activated cell sorting targeting the astroglial hyaluronate receptor
CD44 (ref. 12) using conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cytometry confirmed that 495% of cells expressed
CD44 immediately after sorting. At that point, the cells were resuspended in
DMEM/F12/N1 supplemented with 10 ng ml � 1 bFGF and 2% PD-FBS at 2.5 � 105
cells per ml in six-well suspension plates, in preparation for either transduction and
further expansion, or for direct transplantation.
Production of mHtt-transduced glial progenitor cells. To express mutant versus
control Htt in human GPCs, we used a self-inactivating lentiviral system39 to
over-express either mutant (73Q) or normal (23Q) Htt. To this end, we
constructed a plasmid (pTANK-CMVie-Htt-IRES-LckEGFP-WPRE) to carry, in
the 50–30 direction, the cPPT element40; the cytomegalovirus immediate early
promoter; the expression cassette of the first exon of the huntingtin gene and
membrane-bounded EGFP, expressed in tandem under the Internal Ribosome
Entry Site (IRES)41, and the Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Posttranscriptional
Regulatory Element (WPRE)42. The control virus expressed only LckEGFP.
Virus particles pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein were
produced, concentrated by ultracentrifugation and titrated on 293HEK cells.
Following fetal cell dissociation and CD44-based immunomagnetic sorting,
the cells were transduced with Lenti-htt23Q-LckEGFP, Lenti-htt73Q-LckEGFP
or Lenti-LckEGFP control virus, each at 5 multiplicities of infection.
Transduced cells were isolated 5 days later, following EGFP-directed FACS. The

 cells were then maintained in suspension in low serum and FGF2-containing media
before transplant.
Production of GPCs from embryonic stem cells. Glial progenitor cells were
generated from hESCs using our previously described protocols14. Cells were
collected between 160 and 240, by which time the majority typically expressed
the bipotential glial progenitor cell marker CD140a, while the remainder were
A2B5 þ/CD140a � astrocytes. hESCs were obtained from GENEA, Inc. (Sydney,
Australia), as lines GENEA19 (normal Htt: 18 CAG) and GENEA20 (mHtt: 48
CAG), which were derived as a sibling pair from one couple15.
Animals. Two strains or mice were used in this studies: rag1 � / � and
R6/2 � rag1 � / � The overall distribution of mice in different experimental end
points is shown in Supplementary Table 1. R6/2 � rag1 � / � mice are heterozygous
transgenic R6/2 mice13, transgenic for the 50-end of the human Huntingtin gene
and bearing a 120±5 CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene,
then bred with rag1 � / � homozygous immunodeficient mice. The mice were bred
through consecutive transplantation of R6/2 ovaries derived from R6/2 � rag1 � / �
mice into WT B6CBAF1/J females at Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).
Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail
clippings following the Jackson Laboratories genotyping protocol. The mice were
socially housed under micro-isolator conditions, with ad lib access to food and
water. All procedures were performed in agreement with protocols approved by the
University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources.
Cell preparation for transplantation. CD44-sorted and stably expressing glial
progenitor cells, biased to astrocyte fate43, were passaged with TrypLE 3–5 days
before transplantation into R6/2 mice. The passaged cells were plated at a density
of 100,000–150,000 cells per ml into 100-mm ultra-low attachment plates in the
media described above to allow small cell clusters (100–200 mm in diameter). To
prepare cells for transplantation, cells were collected, spun down, washed with
Ca2 þ/Mg2 þ-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) and resuspended to a final
concentration of 105 cells per ml in Ca2 þ/Mg2 þ-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution.
Transplantation. R6/2 � rag1 � / � and rag1� / � littermates were transplanted
within 24h of birth, postnatal day 1 (P1). The mice were anesthetized by deep
hypothermia and transplanted either bilaterally in the striatum with a total of
100,000 cells (50,000 cells per hemisphere; two-point transplantation paradigm) as
described36. The cell transplant procedures were conducted under aseptic conditions.
Histology. Animals were killed using sodium pentobarbital and perfused
transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and their brains were
processed for immunocytochemistry as previously described. Sagittal equidistant
cryosections of sections (20 mm) spanning the whole brain were analysed. Human
cells were identified through immunostaining with anti-human nuclear antigen
(1:800, MAB1281, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). Engrafted human cells were
mapped using Metamorph imaging software and an automated fluorescence
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Brain sections were then
co-stained to define phenotype, using combinations of the following antibodies:
mouse anti-huntingtin antibody clone EM48 (1:250, MAB5374, Millipore); mouse
anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:800, SMI-21, Covance, Princeton, NJ,
USA); rabbit anti-Olig2 (1:400, RA25081 Neuromics, Edina, MN, USA); rabbit
anti-PDGFRa (1:400, 5241 Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Slides
were analysed serially every twenty-fourth section using the optical
fractionator method to estimate the total number of engrafted human cells of each
histological marker (GFAP, Olig2, PDGFRa) using StereoInvestigator imaging
software (MicroBrightField, Burlington, VT, USA).
Motor assessment. Mice from different litters were randomly assigned for rotarod
evaluation. The mice were handled under the same conditions by one investigator at
the same day and time. The female44 experimenter was blind as to the genotype and
treatment of the mice. The mice were tested every 4 weeks, in three rotarod trials
per session, allowing at least 5 min of rest between each trial. The rotarod (Ugo
Basile) accelerated from 5 to 40r.p.m. and each trial lasted 5 min. The three values
were averaged, and the data were analysed using two-way ANOVA
(treatment � genotype) using GraphPad Prism v.5.0b (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).
Survival. Mice from multiple litters were assigned to the experiment. The mice
were kept in mix genotype with three to five mice per cage. To determine lifespan,
the mice were checked once a day at a younger age. Diseased mice were checked
twice a day. The criterion for euthanasia was determined at the point in time when
R6/2 mice were found moribund and could no longer right themselves after 30 s
when placed on their side. Deaths that occurred overnight were recorded the
following morning.
Statistics. Statistical analyses and graphs were generated using GraphPad
Prism v.5.0b (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Results are expressed as
mean±s.e.m., except where otherwise noted. Comparisons between groups were
typically performed using ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests.
Survival data were analysed by Log-rank (Mantel Cox) testing. Significance was
defined as Pr0.05.
Electrophysiological recordings. Mice at 12 weeks after birth were deeply
anaesthetized with ketamine (100 mg kg � 1) and xylazine (10 mg kg � 1). An open
window on the top of the mouse skull was cut and the brain was removed rapidly
into the oxygenated, ice-cold, cutting solution, then glued to the stage of a Leica
VT1000S vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), with the posterior
surfaces down. Transverse brain slices of 300 mm were cut in the oxygenated,
ice-cold, cutting solution containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl; 1.25 NaH2PO4; 10 MgSO4;
0.5 CaCl2; 10 glucose; 26 NaHCO3; and 230 sucrose. Slices containing the striatum
were incubated in the slice solution gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 for at least
1 h, before being placed in a recording chamber (1.5 ml), which was superfused
with the slice solution gassed with 5% CO2/95% O2 at room temperature
(23–24 �C). The slice solution (artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF) contained (in
mM): 126 NaCl; 26 NaHCO3; 2.5 KCl; 1.25 NaH2PO4; 2 MgSO4; 2 CaCl2; 10
lactate; and 10 glucose.
The recording chamber was placed on the stage of an Olympus BX51 upright
microscope (Olympus Optical Co., NY, USA) equipped with DIC optics, and cells
were visualized with a � 60 water immersion lens. Patch electrodes with a
resistance of 7–9 MO were pulled from TW150F-4 glass capillaries (i.d. 1.12 mm,
o.d. 1.5 mm, World Precision Instruments, USA) using a PC-10 electrode puller
(Narishige International USA, Inc. East Meadow, NY, USA). For normal
hGPC-engrafted R6/2 mice, MSNs were identified morphologically under DIC
optics in randomly chosen striatal fields, while in Q23 versus Q73 mHtt þ
hGPC-chimeric striata, MSNs were identified in the vicinity of mHtt:EGFP-
expressing glia under two-photon microscopy. In both cases all neurons were
patched with the patch pipette filled with the pipette solution (mM): 140 potassium
gluconate; 2 MgCl2; 10 HEPES; 4 Mg-ATP; 0.3 Na-GTP; and 5 sodium
phosphocreatine (pH 7.3). A seal resistance o5 GO was rejected.
Membrane currents and potentials were recorded under the voltage-clamp and
current-clamp configurations, respectively, with Axopatch MultiClamp (Axon
Instruments, Forster City, CA, USA), interfaced to a desktop IBM-compatible computer
via a Digidata A/D 1440A converter digitizer (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA).
Recording signals were filtered through a low-pass filter with a 2-kHz cut-off frequency
and sampled by pCLAMP 10.2 software (Axon Instruments) with an interval of 50 ms.
Interstitial potassium recordings. In vivo recordings were obtained from the
cortex and striatum of 12- to 18-week-old R6/2 HD mice and WT littermates, as
well as from their matched littermates transplanted neonatally with a total of
2 � 105 CD44-sorted hGPCs, with bilateral injections of 5 � 104 cells each into
striatum and the parietal cortical mantle. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane
(1.5% mixed with 1–2 l min � 1 O2), and their heads restrained with a custom mini-
frame, to which the mice were habituated the day before in multiple sessions, with
a total training duration of 2 h. On the day of recording, a 3-mm craniotomy was
opened over the motor cortex (centred at 1.5 mm lateral to bregma), and the dura
removed. The procedure lasted o20 min to minimize anaesthesia exposure during
recording, and 30 min recovery from isoflurane anaesthesia was allowed post-
operatively. Body temperature was maintained throughout with a heating pad. The
aCSF solution contained (in mM) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgCl2,
2 CaCl2, 10 glucose and 26 NaHCO3, pH 7.4.
Ion-sensitive microelectrodes for K þ recording were prepared as glass pipettes
(WPI, TW150-4) with a tip diameter of 1–3 mm, as previously described28,29. The
pipettes were silanized with dimethylsilane I (Fluka, Sigma) and filled with K þ
ionophore I cocktail B (Fluka). The backfill solution for K þ ion-specific meter
(Hanna Instr., RI) was 0.15 M KCl. K þ electrodes were calibrated before and after
each experiment and the calibration data were fitted to the Nikolsky equation to
determine electrode slope and interference28,29. The K þ electrodes were inserted
vertically into the brain within the craniotomy site, at 2.0 mm lateral to bregma, at
depths of 600 mm and 2.2 mm for the cortex and striatum, respectively. Mean
values over 20–30 min recording periods were utilized.
Behavioural analysis. Behavioural analysis was done at Psychogenics, Inc., in
Tarrytown, NY. A total of 71 mice were used in Smartcube and Neurocube
behavioural experiments, and 64 were used in T-maze experiments. Psychogenics
staff were blinded as to whether the tested animals were transplanted or controls,
and the group identities of analysed animals were not revealed to Psychogenics
until after data analysis was complete and all data had been provided to the
investigators. By this means, we sought to validate, through an independent
blinded replication, our conclusion that normal glial implantation is sufficient to
improve disease phenotype in HD.
PsychoGenics’ high-throughput systems for behavioural analysis used in this
study included SmartCube and NeuroCube. These capture different domains of
behaviour that include cognitive, motor, circadian, socialization, gait and anxiety-
state end points, among others, using custom-built computer vision software and

 machine learning algorithms21. Experiments were conducted using modified
Intellicage units (www.tse-systems.com), each with a camera mounted on top of
the cage for computer vision analysis. These cages have four corners with small
doors, containing antennas to pick up each animal’s ID from their implanted chips,
while providing access to water bottles and allowing measurement of nose-poking
and cognitive performance45,46.
The NeuroCube platform uses computer vision to detect changes in gait
geometry and dynamics. Mice are placed in the Neurocube system and allowed to
explore freely for 5 min while a camera placed below the transparent floor recorded
their movement for automated analysis of gait and paw placement. In this study,
mice were tested at 8 and 11 weeks of age. SmartCube similarly uses computer vision
and mechanical actuators to detect changes in body geometry, posture and
spontaneous behaviour, as well as reactions to particular challenges19. Throughout
45-min testing sessions, mice were alternatively experienced periods of free
exploration, motor challenges, inescapable electric shock and startle-evoking stimuli.
For the latter, nozzles in the wall of the chamber were used to produce brief, intense
puffs of air to elicit startle responses; in some trials, these were preceded by soft
(20 dB above background noise) acoustic stimuli to elicit prepulse inhibition of
startle. On testing days mice were brought to experimental rooms and allowed to
acclimate for at least 30min before testing. Mice were tested at 8 and 11 weeks of age.
The T-maze is an aquatic maze that mice navigate to reach a submerged (0.5 cm
below water level) escape platform. The maze consists of two enclosed waterways
that meet at a perpendicular junction, forming a ‘T’-shape. The walls of the maze are
opaque, and the water (25±1 �C) is coloured to eliminate external cues. Training for
this task challenges mice to learn and recall the location of the submerged escape
platform without access to external cues. Mice were tested in the procedural T-Maze
at 9 and 13 weeks of age, with each week of testing consisting of 5 consecutive days
of training, and each day including eight trials for every mouse. A trial began when
mice were lowered on an automated platform into the water at the distal ‘stem’ of the
‘T’, and allowed to swim freely. At the junction of the perpendicular arms of the
maze, the mice must decide to swim in one direction or the other, but only one path
lead to a submerged escape platform. The location of the platform was kept constant
for each mouse, and with successive training mice learned to choose the path
containing the escape platform over the other path. Behavioural decisions in the
T-maze were defined by movement across the threshold of a given path, and were
coded ‘right’ or ‘wrong choice’ relative to the location of the submerged platform.
Mice that failed to leave the stem of the T-maze were coded as ‘no-choice’. Mice that
failed to reach the platform, whether due to ‘no-choice’ or ‘wrong-choice’
behaviours, were placed directly on the platform after 60s.
Statistical analysis of our behavioural data considered Genotype, Treatment,
and as appropriate, a repeated-measures factor. For analyses in Smartcube and
Neurocube (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), the repeated-measures factor
was Age (8 weeks versus 11 weeks). For analysis of T-maze data, the repeated
measures factor was Session (1–5), and separate analyses were conducted at 9 and
13 weeks. Significant (Po0.05) main effects and interactions in two- or three-way
mixed models (SAS 9.4) were followed by post hoc comparisons (t-tests for planned
comparisons). We only investigated the following comparisons: sham-treated WT
mice versus hGPC-treated WT or sham-treated R6/2 mice; and hGPC-treated
versus sham-treated R6/2 mice. Data are represented as the mean and s.e.m.
Principal component analytics were then used to assess overall group-specific
treatment effects. To reduce the effect of the correlations among the many
behavioural features collected we form statistically independent combinations (aka
decorrelated features) of the original features, in this way also reducing
dimensionality. We then apply a proprietary feature ranking algorithm based on the
feature’s discrimination power (that is, ability to separate groups). This ranking is
used to weigh each feature by its relevance for the final step of classification. We thus
do not resort to conventional feature selection, but rather weight features to diminish
the effect of irrelevant information contained in lesser features. In the new
decorrelated feature space, the distance and overlap between Gaussian distributions
representing each group (aka clouds), are used to calculate a quantitative measure of
separability (with 50% representing chance and 100% perfect separability for equally
sized groups). To estimate how likely it is that such separation is simply due to
chance, the obtained classifier is challenged many times with correctly labelled
samples (for example, WT or treated), or with randomized labels. The overlap
between the distributions of discrimination values obtained for these two labelling
categories represents the probability of finding the observed discrimination by
chance. For visualization, we plotted each cloud on the two most important axes (the
two composite features that best discriminate between the groups), with its semi-axes
equal to one standard deviation of the group. To analyze cell treatment effects, we
first trained with the sham-treated WT and R6/2 mice and then asked the trained
algorithm to classify the hGPC-treated mice. To interpret the effects we decomposed
the trajectory of the treated groups into two vectors: one along the direction of the
disease signature (the line connecting the centres of the sham-treated WT and R6/2
clouds which captures disease-specific effects) and an orthogonal component (disease
unspecific effects). Rescue or recovery is given by the movement of the hGPC-treated
R6/2 group toward the sham-treated WT group on the disease line. Unspecific effects
can be measured then by movement of this group in the orthogonal direction, and by
movement of the hGPC-treated WT group in any direction.
Data availability. All relevant data and methodological detail pertaining to this
study are available to any interested researchers upon request to Dr Goldman.
