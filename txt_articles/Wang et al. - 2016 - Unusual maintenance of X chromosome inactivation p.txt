Females have a greater immunological advantage than men, yet
they are more prone to autoimmune disorders. The basis for this
sex bias lies in the X chromosome, which contains many immunity-
related genes. Female mammals use X chromosome inactivation (XCI)
to generate a transcriptionally silent inactive X chromosome (Xi)
enriched with heterochromatic modifications and XIST/Xist RNA,
which equalizes gene expression between the sexes. Here, we
examine the maintenance of XCI in lymphocytes from females in
mice and humans. Strikingly, we find that mature naïve T and B
cells have dispersed patterns of XIST/Xist RNA, and they lack the
typical heterochromatic modifications of the Xi. In vitro activation
of lymphocytes triggers the return of XIST/Xist RNA transcripts
and some chromatin marks (H3K27me3, ubiquitin-H2A) to the Xi.
Single-cell RNA FISH analysis of female T cells revealed that the
X-linked immunity genes CD40LG and CXCR3 are biallelically
expressed in some cells. Using knockout and knockdown approaches,
we find that Xist RNA-binding proteins, YY1 and hnRNPU, are critical
for recruitment of XIST/Xist RNA back to the Xi. Furthermore, we
examined B cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,
an autoimmune disorder with a strong female bias, and observed
different XIST RNA localization patterns, evidence of biallelic expres-
sion of immunity-related genes, and increased transcription of these
genes. We propose that the Xi in female lymphocytes is predisposed
to become partially reactivated and to overexpress immunity-related
genes, providing the first mechanistic evidence to our knowledge for
the enhanced immunity of females and their increased susceptibility
for autoimmunity.
X chromosome inactivation | XIST RNA | epigenetics |
female-biased autoimmunity
T
he X chromosome has the greatest density of immunity-
related genes (1), and females, with two X chromosomes, have
an immunological advantage over males (XY). Clinical studies
have demonstrated that females have a more hyperresponsive
immune system than males following immune challenges (2, 3).
Females produce more serum IgM and antibodies (4, 5), which is
immunologically advantageous, whereas males are more sus-
ceptible to bacterial and viral infections (5–7). This strong female-
specific immune response is not always beneficial and can result in
autoimmunity. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an auto-
immune disease where 85% of patients are women, yet the reason
for this sex-based disparity is unknown (8, 9). The X chromosome
is a critical factor for the breakdown of self-tolerance. Turner
syndrome patients (XO) have a low risk of developing SLE (10),
yet individuals suffering from Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY) have
14-fold increased risk of developing SLE (11), suggesting that
gene dosage from the X chromosome somehow influences SLE
susceptibility.
Females select one X for chromosome-wide transcriptional si-
lencing in a process called X chromosome inactivation (XCI),
which equalizes the expression of X-linked genes between genders
(12, 13). XCI first takes place during embryonic development,
where one X is chosen at random for silencing. This process is
initiated by the allele-specific expression of the long noncoding
RNA XIST in humans (14) and Xist in mice (15). After XCI ini-
tiation, the inactive X (Xi) enters the maintenance phase where
XIST/Xist RNA remains associated with the Xi after each cell
division (16). The Xi becomes enriched with additional hetero-
chromatic modifications (H3K27me3, macroH2A, H3K9me2/3,
H4K20me1, ubiquitin-H2A) and DNA hypermethylation (17–21),
which promote gene repression (13). Female mammals silence
most X-linked genes with XCI, yet some genes escape silencing
(22). Approximately 15% of human X-linked genes are biallelically
expressed in hybrid fibroblasts (23), whereas 3% of the mouse Xi
escapes silencing (24). The expression level of escapee genes from
the Xi is usually lower than from the active X (Xa). Escape from
XCI can also vary between individuals (which enhances phenotypic
differences), among cells within a tissue (25), and also during de-
velopment and aging. The number of genes exhibiting variable
escape from XCI is small: In humans, 10–12% display variable
escape (23, 26), and in mice approximately 18 genes escape (24).
Because XCI is a mechanism to equalize gene expression
between the sexes, there should be equal levels of immunity-
related proteins in female and male cells. However, some im-
munity-related X-linked genes exhibit sex-biased expression,
and this variability may predispose females toward developing
Significance
Females have increased immune responsiveness than males,
and they are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders. The
mechanism underlying these observations is unclear, and hy-
potheses suggest an important role for the X chromosome.
Here, we discover that the inactive X is predisposed to become
partially reactivated in mammalian female lymphocytes,
resulting in the overexpression of immunity-related genes. We
also
demonstrate
that
lymphocytes
from
systemic
lupus
erythematosus patients have different epigenetic characteris-
tics on the inactive X that compromises transcriptional silenc-
ing. These findings are the first to our knowledge to link the
unusual maintenance of X chromosome Inactivation (the
female-specific mechanism for dosage compensation) in lym-
phocytes to the female bias observed with enhanced immunity
and autoimmunity susceptibility.

 autoimmunity (27). Altered expression of X-linked genes is
observed in female-biased autoimmune disorders and mouse
models of autoimmunity (8), raising the provocative notion that
reactivation of genes from the Xi leads to the overexpression of
immunity-associated X-linked genes that contribute to disease.
Consistently, female, but not male, SLE patient CD4+ T cells
overexpress the X-linked genes CD40LG and CXCR3 and their
promoter regions are demethylated, suggesting that these genes
are not overexpressed from the Xa, but are instead expressed
from a reactivated Xi (28, 29). Because increased dosage of
immunity-related genes such as CD40LG and TLR7 are asso-
ciated with SLE disease in human and mouse models, we in-
vestigated whether compromised maintenance of XCI in
female lymphocytes from humans and mice could potentially
contribute to predisposition toward autoimmunity. Notably, we
demonstrate that fluctuations in the association of XIST/Xist
RNA with the Xi may lead to partial reactivation, thereby in-
creasing biallelic expression of autoimmune-associated genes.
Results
Female Lymphocytes Lack XIST RNA Transcripts on the Xi. To de-
termine whether noncanonical XCI could potentially contrib-
ute to the increased risk of SLE in females, we examined the
epigenetic characteristics of the Xi chromosome in human
female mature lymphocytes. First, we performed RNA fluo-
rescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by using two types of XIST-
specific probes (double-stranded exon 1 region and short oligos).
XIST/Xist RNA is expressed from the Xi in somatic cells, and the
transcripts remain tightly associated, forming a cloud-like structure
that is visualized by RNA FISH (16, 30). Remarkably, bulk T cells
from human females did not have the canonical XIST RNA cloud
observed in other somatic cells (Fig. 1A). This result was con-
sistent, regardless of T-cell purification method [fluorescence acti-
vated cell sorting (FACS) or negative selection with magnetic beads]
or collection procedure (apheresis or traditional venipuncture).
The majority of FACS sorted naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and
female naïve B cells also lacked XIST RNA clouds, resembling
male T cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained by using single-
molecule oligo probes for XIST (Fig. S1A, Left and B, Right).
Mature naïve splenic T cells from female mice also lacked Xist
RNA clouds (Fig. 2D, Top), in contrast with a previous study
where Xist RNA signals were detected in 25–60% of CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells (31).
We observed that female naïve lymphocytes have four distinct
patterns of XIST RNA localization: Type I nuclei contain tightly
clustered pinpoints localized with one X, similar to those in female
fibroblasts; type II nuclei have diffuse pinpoints of XIST RNA that
roughly encompass a nuclear area the size of one X; type III nuclei
have dispersed pinpoints extending beyond the X chromosome
territory; and type IV nuclei lack XIST RNA signal (Fig. 1C). We
quantified the number of cells with each class of XIST RNA
localization pattern and found that naïve T cells are mostly type III,

 followed by type II and IV patterns (Fig. 1D). Roughly 1–4% of
human female naïve T cells had type I XIST RNA clouds. Next, we
repeated RNA FISH by using single-molecule oligo probes specific
for human XIST and found that naïve female T cells had greater
fluorescence sum intensities (P = 0.05) and maximum intensities
(P = 8.0e−6) compared with male T cells (Fig. S1B). We also
quantified the numbers of each type of XIST RNA localization
pattern for human female naïve B cells and observed a different
distribution of XIST RNA localization pattern relative to T cells,
irrespective of the collection method. Mature naïve B cells contain
mostly type III and IV nuclei, and we never detected a type I XIST
RNA cloud (Fig. 1E). In summary, naïve T and B cells are the first
female somatic cells to our knowledge where the Xi is missing
clustered XIST RNA transcripts.
XIST/Xist RNA Returns to the Xi upon Lymphocyte Activation. Naïve
lymphocytes are quiescent, and upon antigen recognition can
become activated and reenter the cell cycle. We investigated the
XIST RNA localization patterns in female T cells activated in
vitro by using CD3/CD28 and performed a time course analysis
of XIST RNA FISH following in vitro stimulation. We discov-
ered that XIST RNA clouds return to the Xi 24 h after in vitro
stimulation (Fig. 2A). The XIST clouds formed after 1–3 d of
stimulation, and resembled clouds present in female fibroblasts
(Fig. 1A), with the XIST RNA territory located in a COT-1
negative space within the nucleus (Fig. 2A). We observed similar
RNA FISH results when using a double-stranded probe for XIST
exon 1 or single-molecule oligo probes for XIST together with
COT-1 (Fig. S1A). Activated female T cells exhibited greater
nuclear fluorescence sum intensity and maximum intensity values
compared with naïve female and male T cells, reflecting the
presence of the XIST RNA transcript concentrated on the Xi
(Fig. 1F and Fig. S1B). Because RNA FISH does not accurately
reflect transcript absence, we used more sensitive quantification
methods for XIST RNA (see below).
Because COT-1 RNA detects regions of nascent transcription
within the nucleus (32–34), our observations of XIST clouds
within COT-1 holes suggest that XIST localization promotes
transcriptional silencing of the chromosome (Fig. 2A). Quiescent
naïve T cells had a faint COT-1 signal, with speckled pinpoints
distributed across the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Activated T cells had a
greater overall COT-1 signal and defined nuclear distribution
patterns for cells at days 1–3 following stimulation (Fig. 2A).
Type I XIST RNA clouds decreased in activated T cells at day 5
following stimulation, with a concomitant increase in the number
of cells with type III RNA pinpoints (Fig. S2 A and B). The
percentages of type IV clouds, which lack XIST RNA signal, did
not change after stimulation. In vitro stimulation resulted in a
maximum of 30–50% of cells with type I XIST RNA clouds and
25–40% type II XIST pinpoints, and the distribution varied by
individual (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2A). Type I cells disappeared by day
7, and COT-1 RNA patterns became diffuse by days 9–11 (Fig.
S2B), consistent with increased apoptosis (visualized as non-
specific fluorescence and smaller DAPI nuclei).
We also examined mature naïve T and B cells isolated from
female mouse spleens and found that, like human cells, these
cells also lack canonical Xist RNA clouds (Fig. 2 D and F). Bulk
female mouse T cells (typically 90% pure) contained similar
amounts of helper T cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+),
and roughly 10% of CD4+ cells were regulatory T cells (FoxP3+)
(Fig. S2C). In vitro stimulation of mouse bulk T and B cells
promoted the return of Xist RNA clouds to the Xi, with the
greatest numbers of type I pattern observed 1 d after activation
(Fig. 2 E and G). In vitro-activated mouse T cells had the most
type I Xist RNA clouds (∼75%), even higher than human T cells
where a maximum of 50% of cells contained the canonical XIST
RNA cloud. We verified T-cell activation efficiency by using
FACS to sort CD44+ cells (expressed on activated T cells) and
the percentages of actively dividing cells using CFSE labeling
(Fig. S2D). Type I Xist clouds persisted in activated mouse T cells
for longer periods compared with activated human cells, yet by
day 7, the cells reverted to type III and IV patterns and increased
apoptotic cells (denoted by autofluorescence) (Fig. 2E and Fig.
S3A). Next, we activated mature B cells in vitro two ways: either by
adding lipopolysaccharide or CpG (35, 36). Type I Xist RNA
clouds returned to the Xi following stimulation of B cells, similar to
T-cell activation, irrespective of the method used for activation
(Fig. 2 F and G). B cells stimulated for 1 d had the most type I Xist
RNA clouds (45%), but never reached the levels in female mouse
embryonic fibroblasts or T cells.
Because both human and mouse mature naïve T cells lack
typical XIST/Xist RNA clouds, we investigated whether these
cells express XIST/Xist. We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to
quantify the steady-state levels of human XIST RNA and mouse
Xist RNA in naïve and activated lymphocytes. Remarkably,
XIST/Xist RNA was abundant in naïve and activated T cells in
human (Fig. 2C and Figs. S3B and S4A) and mouse (Fig. S4 C
and D), and the levels were nearly equivalent to those found in
female fibroblasts. We found that XIST/Xist was also highly
expressed in naïve human (Fig. S4A) and mouse B cells (Fig.
S4B), which had different XIST RNA localization patterns than
naïve T cells. Because naïve T cells are quiescent and have re-
duced transcriptional activity, we repeated the quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses normalizing for cell number. We
also normalized XIST/Xist RNA expression by using a house-
keeping gene (RPL13A), whose expression does not change with
in vitro lymphocyte stimulation (37). We found that the levels of
Xist RNA were similar for naïve and activated T cells, regardless
of the method used for normalization (Fig. S4D). Similar to T
cells, activated female mouse B cells also expressed equivalent
levels of Xist RNA compared with naïve B cells (Fig. S4B).
Northern blot analyses using equal amounts of RNA from mouse
naïve and activated T cells support our qRT-PCR results that
naïve female lymphocytes contain similar levels of Xist RNA
transcripts as activated cells (Fig. S4E). We observed that Xist
Northern blots of mouse T cells resembled Xist Northern blots
of mouse embryonic stem cells and differentiating cells (38), with
a multitude of high and low molecular weight bands of Xist
transcripts. We found that female naïve T cells had a more in-
tense signal of Xist RNA transcripts compared with activated T
cells, but both samples had the same pattern of Xist RNA bands.
We did not observe significant RNA degradation between naïve
and activated female T-cell samples (Fig. S4E). Our results are in
agreement with previous findings that XIST/Xist RNA tran-
scription and transcript localization are independent processes
(39, 40). We conclude that mammalian female naïve and acti-
vated lymphocytes have similar levels of XIST/Xist RNA tran-
scripts to produce the canonical type I cloud, yet naïve lymphocytes
are unable to properly localize these transcripts to the Xi.
The Chromatin of the Xi Is More Euchromatic in Mammalian Lymphocytes.
Quiescent lymphocytes, which have a reduced transcriptional pro-
gram, contain regions of facultative chromatin that become decon-
densed following activation (41). The mammalian Xi is enriched
for histone H3K27me3, histone H2A ubiquitin (H2AUb), histone
H4K20me1/3, histone H3K9me3, and the histone variant mac-
roH2A (17, 20, 42–44). These marks form a focus that colocalizes
with the Xi (and the XIST/Xist RNA cloud) when visualized
cytologically in sequential RNA FISH and immunofluorescence
(IF) experiments. Because naïve lymphocytes are quiescent and
contain more heterochromatin than activated cells (45), they
should theoretically exhibit enriched heterochromatic modifi-
cations on the Xi. However, because XIST RNA does not lo-
calize to the Xi in naïve lymphocytes, these modifications might
also be missing. Therefore, we examined the localization of
H2AUb, H3K27me3, macroH2A, or H4K20me1 with the Xi in
mature naïve lymphocytes by using RNA FISH for detection of
XIST/Xist RNA followed by IF for each modification, and fi-
nally DNA FISH to identify the two X chromosomes. Female
fibroblasts were used as a positive control, and foci were ob-
served overlapping XIST/Xist RNA signal for human and
mouse cells. In human naïve T cells, we did not detect nuclear foci

Wang et al.
 for H2AUb, H3K27me3, macroH2A, or H4K20me1 modifications
that colocalized with an X chromosome (Fig. 3A). Mouse naïve T
cells also lacked foci of H2AUb, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and
macroH2A that colocalized to the Xi (Fig. 3B). This observation is
in agreement with a previous study showing that macroH2A is
never detected over the Xi in female mouse mature lymphocytes
(41). Although we detected abundant nuclear signal for all of these
repressive modifications in both human and mouse T cells, we
never observed a focus that overlapped with an X chromosome. We
conclude that the mammalian Xi lacks enrichment of heterochro-
matic modifications in mature naïve lymphocytes.
We repeated the serial RNA FISH/IF/DNA FISH analyses by
using in vitro activated bulk T cells, and observed that some, but
not all, heterochromatin marks returned to the Xi. Specifically,
we found that H2AUb and H3K27me3 modifications formed
foci in 70–80% of nuclei, and that these foci overlapped the type
I XIST/Xist RNA cloud (Fig. 3 A and B). Remarkably, the return
of these heterochromatic modifications to the Xi occurred in
both human and mouse T cells. MacroH2A staining intensity was
high throughout the nucleus of activated mouse and human T
cells, yet focal enrichment on the Xi was observed for only 12–
15% of nuclei with type I XIST/Xist patterns (Fig. 3 A and B). In
activated human T cells, we observed the most pronounced
macroH2A foci in type II nuclei with diffuse XIST RNA pinpoints
(Fig. 3A). H4K20me1/3 modifications returned to the Xi in
roughly 50% of human T cells (Fig. 3A). We conclude that the
chromatin of the Xi in female T cells is different compared with
fibroblasts, and that mature naïve cells have a more euchromatic
Xi because it is missing H3K27me3, H4K20me, macroH2A, and
H2AUb enrichment.
Female Lymphocytes Exhibit Partial X-Reactivation Resulting in
Increased Expression of Immunity-Related X-Linked Genes. We ex-
amined how this unusual chromatin affects expression of two
X-linked genes, CD40LG and CXCR3, frequently overex-
pressed in the autoimmune disorder SLE. Our hypothesis was
that the euchromatic features of the Xi would result in ex-
pression of genes from the Xi in naïve and stimulated human
T cells. We used sequential RNA then DNA FISH to detect
expression of three X-linked genes subject to XCI (CD40LG,
CXCR3, and ATRX). To identify the location of the Xi, we used
a probe for XIST RNA to identify the Xi (for RNA FISH).
Lastly, we denatured the slides for DNA FISH, which detected
the location of the two X chromosomes. We quantified the
percentages of cells expressing these genes from just the Xa or
both Xs by counting the number of cells containing one pinpoint
(monoallelic) or two pinpoints (biallelic) that overlapped with

 an X chromosome. We examined mature naïve and in vitro
stimulated T cells from healthy human female and male donors,
which are a positive control for monoallelic expression. We
found that human naïve T cells had dimmer (but still detect-
able) RNA FISH signals compared with day 3 stimulated cells
(Fig. S5). Analysis of CD40LG, an X-linked gene overexpressed
in CD4+ T cells from female SLE patients (23, 26, 28), revealed
the presence of mostly monoallelic (96% with one pinpoint)
and some biallelic expression (4% with two pinpoints), in ac-
tivated female T cells (Fig. 3C). We were unable to detect a
clear CD40LG nascent transcription signal in naïve female T
cells, despite repeated efforts with cells from different female
donors. Male T cells were exclusively monoallelic for CD40LG
expression (Fig. S5A), as expected. Next, we repeated the
analysis by using a probe specific for CXRC3, another X-linked
gene subject to XCI that is frequently overexpressed in female
SLE CD4+ T cells (23, 26, 28). Again, we detected some naïve
(5%) and stimulated T cells (3%) with biallelic expression of
CXCR3 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S5B). As a control, we examined an
X-linked gene not involved in immune function, ATRX, which
is known to undergo XCI in female cells (23, 26, 46). We found
that ATRX is expressed in lymphocytes, and is predominantly
monoallelic in naïve (99%) and activated (95%) female T cells, yet
we also detected some biallelic-expressing cells (5%) present in
activated T cells (Fig. 3C). Male cells only contained monoallelic-
expressing cells for ATRX (100%) (Fig. S5A), similar to other
X-linked genes examined. We conclude that the euchromatic na-
ture of the Xi in female lymphocytes predisposes X-linked genes to
become reactivated and biallelically expressed.
Next, we investigated how the euchromatic-like features of the
Xi correlate with X-linked gene expression chromosome-wide in
lymphocytes. We tested the hypothesis that if there is partial
reactivation from the Xi in female lymphocytes, we would expect
that healthy female cells, with an Xa and Xi, would have higher
expression of X-linked genes compared with healthy male cells
containing one Xa. We used gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) to query sex-specific differences in gene expression by
using an unbiased approach, examining published microarray
datasets from human male and female mature naïve B cells
(GSE30153). We found that there are three regions on the X
chromosome that are overexpressed in female B cells compared
with male B cells: p11, p22, and q13 (Fig. 3D). Region chrX.q13,
containing 21 genes, was the most significantly overexpressed
genomic region in female B cells [normalized enrichment score
(NES) = 2.25; false discovery rate (FDR) q = 0.003] compared
with male cells (Fig. 3D). This region contains the XIST gene,
exclusively expressed in females, and we observed the same sex-
biased expression in B cells, serving as a positive control for our
analysis (Fig. 3D). We identified a gene signature from chrX.q13
of overexpressed genes specific to female B cells, listed in Fig.
3D, that are enriched at the leading edge (red region of the x
axis) of the enrichment score plot. Importantly, two of these
genes, ITM2A and CXCR3, are immunity-related and CXCR3 is
associated with autoimmunity (28, 47). The p arm of the X
chromosome has more genes known to escape XCI compared
with the q arm, explaining why genes from these two regions are
expressed at higher levels in females compared with males. A
number of genes known to escape XCI, including EIF1AX,
EIF2S3, OFD1, and ZFX (23), are located within chrX.p22 and
are enriched in female B cells. We found that the immunity-
related genes IL3FA and FOXP3, located within regions chrX.p22
and chrX.p11, are overexpressed in female cells and are enriched
at the leading edge of the enrichment score plots for female B
cells. There is no evidence to date that IL3FA and FOXP3 escape
XCI in humans (23, 26). To test for the significance of immunity-
related genes in sex-specific cell comparisons, we repeated the
unbiased GSEA by using human fetal lung fibroblasts. We found
that chrX.q13 was the most differentially expressed region in lung
fibroblasts (NES = 1.52; FDR q = 0.05) similar to GSEA results
using human B cells (Fig. S5C). As expected, XIST was the most
differentially expressed gene that distinguishes male and fe-
male lung fibroblasts (fold change = 127). However, the other
significantly enriched genes (ATP7A, P2RY4, FOXO4, SLC16A2)
are not immunity-related and are known to escape from XCI (23,
26). We conclude that human female B cells contain regions
along the X that are expressed at higher levels compared with
male cells, and these regions contain immunity-related genes.
These results are consistent with the euchromatic nature of the Xi
in mammalian lymphocytes that could facilitate higher expression
in lymphocytes.
YY1 and hnRNPU Proteins Localize XIST/Xist RNA Transcripts to the Xi
in Activated T and B Cells from Humans and Mice. Naïve T and B
cells express abundant levels of XIST/Xist RNA, but these
transcripts do not associate with the Xi until these cells become
activated. Therefore, we searched for candidate proteins known
to bind XIST RNA that could function to recruit XIST RNA
back to the Xi after lymphocyte stimulation. The nuclear scaffold
protein SAF-A/hnRNPU is enriched on the Xi and is required
for localizing Xist RNA to the Xi in embryonic stem cells during
the initiation of XCI (48, 49). The transcription factor YY1 also
tethers Xist RNA to the X during the initiation and maintenance
stages of XCI, and activates Xist/XIST transcription (50, 51). Im-
portantly, knockdown of hnRNPU or YY1 disrupts Xist RNA
localization in post-XCI fibroblasts, resulting in a scattered pin-
point pattern similar to types II and III in lymphocytes. We found
that YY1 and hnRNPU RNA and protein are expressed in naïve
human female T cells, and that in vitro activation doubled tran-
scriptional expression (Fig. S6A) and increased protein levels (Fig.
S6B). Using siRNAs specific for YY1 or hnRNPU, we disrupted
expression of these proteins in human mature naïve T cells, then
stimulated the cells for 2–3 d. We verified knockdown efficiency for
YY1 and hnRNPU in naïve and activated T cells by using qPCR
and immunofluorescence (Fig. S6D). We found that hnRNPU or
YY1 knockdown significantly reduced the number of canonical
type I XIST RNA clouds from 25 to 10% (YY1 KD; P = 0.02) and
3% (hnRNPU KD; P = 0.03) (Fig. 4B). The percentage of acti-
vated human T cells with a type III XIST pattern increased from 30
to 47% (YY1 KD; P = 0.03) and 45% (hnRNPU KD; P = 0.08)
(Fig. 4B), similar to what is observed when these proteins are
disrupted in differentiating female mouse embryonic stem cells or
embryonic fibroblasts (49, 50). Reduction of YY1 or hnRNPU in
naïve or activated T cells did not affect XIST RNA transcript levels
(Fig. S7B), further supporting a role for these proteins in localizing
XIST RNA to the Xi rather than affecting XIST transcription.
In complementary experiments, we asked whether YY1 de-
letion would affect Xist RNA localization to the Xi in activated B
cells from mice. Similar to human T cells, YY1 levels increased
upon activation in female mouse B cells (Fig. S6C). We isolated
mature naïve B cells from mice containing loxP sites flanking exon
1 of YY1 (9, 52), then deleted YY1 by introducing TAT-Cre (53)
and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide treatment (Fig. 4D).
This method eliminates 85–100% of YY1 expression (Fig. S6C)
(9), depending on the efficiency of the TAT-Cre transfection into
B cells, and is more effective at reducing YY1 levels than siRNAs.
YY1 depletion significantly reduced type I RNA clouds from 43 to
0–5% (P = 0.004) in replicate experiments. As expected, type III
Xist patterns increased with YY1 deletion from 11 to 65% (Fig. 4
E and F). In conclusion, the known Xist RNA binding proteins
YY1 and hnRNPU also function in activated lymphocytes to re-
cruit XIST RNA back to the Xi in activated T and B cells.
SLE Patient B Cells Have Altered Distributions of XIST RNA Localization
Patterns and Biallelic Expression of Immunity-Related X-Linked Genes.
We next tested whether XIST RNA association to the Xi is further
perturbed in SLE-derived lymphocytes. Using RNA FISH, we
determined the percentage for each XIST RNA localization pat-
tern (types I–IV) in immortalized B-cell lines derived from pedi-
atric SLE patients and age-matched healthy controls (Fig. 5A). We
did not observe a significant difference with the canonical type I
XIST RNA clouds between SLE and control samples. However,
SLE B cells had more type II patterns of XIST RNA localization

Wang et al.
 relative to controls (P = 0.04). The most significant difference
between SLE and control B cells was with the type III pattern,
where 50% of the control cells were type III and SLE B cells had
10–30% type III cells (P = 0.006). We found that SLE B cells had
more cells missing XIST RNA transcript accumulation within the
nucleus (the type IV pattern) compared with normal B cells (P =
0.05). SLE B cells also had more type II patterns of XIST RNA
localization relative to controls (P = 0.04). XIST RNA transcript
levels were similar between normal and SLE B-cell lines (Fig. S7A),
indicating that XIST RNA is not limiting in SLE cells. We also
examined the levels of YY1 and hnRNPU transcripts and proteins
in SLE B cells, and found similar expression for SLE and control
lines (Fig. S8 B and C). Thus, XIST RNA exhibits abnormal lo-
calization patterns in SLE B cells, suggesting that X-silencing
mechanisms may be different in SLE.
Next, we investigated whether these differences with XIST
RNA localization were correlated with differences with allelic
expression of X-linked immunity-related genes. We used RNA
FISH to examine nascent transcription of three X-linked immunity-
related genes typically overexpressed in lymphocytes from SLE
patients: CD40LG, CXCR3, and TRL7. We determined the num-
ber of cells with either monoallelic (one pinpoint) or biallelic
expression (two pinpoints), using immortalized B-cell lines
generated from pediatric SLE patients or healthy female age-
matched samples. We found that normal B-cell lines had mostly
monoallelic expression of CD40LG (36–47% of cells), yet we
also detected some biallelic-expressing B cells (4–20%; Fig. 5B),
similar to our observations in activated T cells (Fig. 3C).
CD40LG is normally overexpressed in SLE patient T cells, but is
also ectopically expressed in SLE patient B cells (54). B-cell
lines from three different pediatric SLE patients had slightly
more biallelic-expressing SLE B cells for CD40LG (17–33%;
P = 0.09) compared with healthy control lines (Fig. 5B). We
found that SLE B-cell lines also had fewer cells with monoallelic
expression of CD40LG (22–29%; P = 0.002) compared with
healthy controls. Consistent with a trend toward more biallelic
cells, SLE B cells also expressed more CD40LG transcripts
compared with healthy controls (P = 0.033). In contrast to
CD40LG, we saw no difference for monoallelic and biallelic ex-
pression of CXCR3 (Fig. 5B). We also examined the expression of
TRL7, which is overexpressed in SLE patient B cells (55). We
detected similar levels of biallelic expression of TLR7 in both
normal (12–14%) and SLE B cells (9–23%), yet SLE lines had
more TLR7 transcripts than normal lines (Fig. 5 B and C; P =
5.6e−6). In conclusion, biallelic expression of X-linked im-
munity-related genes was observed in both normal and SLE
patient B cells, and the increased expression from the Xi could
result from atypical XIST RNA localization patterns.
Lastly, we investigated whether altered distributions of XIST
RNA patterns in SLE patients could reflect expression differ-
ences with X-linked genes. Because we found that a chrX.q13
gene signature distinguished male and female B cells (Fig. 3D),
we examined whether this region is overexpressed in female SLE
patients compared with healthy female controls. We used GSEA
to query which regions of the X chromosome were overexpressed
in female SLE B cells compared with healthy female B cells
(GSE30153). As expected, we found that chrX.q13 had the
greatest enrichment of overexpressed X-linked genes in SLE
female B-cell samples (Fig. 5D). Six genes within this region,
KIF4A, OGT, HMGN5, NONO, CXCR3, and ITM2A, were sig-
nificantly enriched at the leading edge (red area of x axis) for the
enrichment score plot (Fig. S8A). Importantly, both OGT and
CXCR3 are overexpressed in female SLE patient lymphocytes
(28), consistent with our results. Our findings suggest the intriguing
hypothesis that altered XIST RNA localization to the Xi

genes from chrX.q13.
Discussion
Here, we have demonstrated that female lymphocytes in humans
and mice do not maintain XCI with the same fidelity as other
somatic cells. Specifically, whereas XIST/Xist RNA is thought to
remain localized to the Xi in all somatic cells, mature naïve
lymphocytes lack XIST/Xist RNA clouds. This study is the first,
to our knowledge, to classify differences with XIST/Xist RNA
localization patterns in lymphocytes. The molecular mechanisms
responsible for these four types of XIST RNA patterns, and the
significance of type II and III cells, are unknown at this time and
warrant further investigation. Also unclear is how these XIST/
Xist RNA patterns correlate with SLE disease severity, and
whether other autoimmune disorders involving T and B cells also
exhibit different localization. Moreover, we found that the Xi in
naïve lymphocytes lacks enrichment of H3K27me3, H4K20me1/3,
H2AUb, and macroH2A, all hallmarks of heterochromatin. The
absence of these modifications is consistent with observed in-
creased expression of immunity-related X-linked genes in hu-
man naïve B cells, and the presence of some T cells with biallelic
expression of CXCR3. These euchromatic features of the lym-
phocyte Xi are in agreement with a recent study profiling the
open regions of chromatin by using the Assay of Transposase
Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) Seq comparing female and male
CD4+ T cells (27). Qu et al. also found that females have more
accessible elements on the X compared with male cells. Our
study also observed that some activated T (Fig. 3C) and B cells
(Fig. 5B) have biallelic expression of X-linked immunity-related
genes. We conclude that this unusual maintenance of XCI in
naïve and activated lymphocytes predisposes portions of the Xi
to become reactivated and increase expression of X-linked
genes, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for why
female mammals and individuals with multiple X’s are more
susceptible to autoimmunity.
The biological reason for XIST/Xist RNA localization
changes in female lymphocytes is unknown. One possibility is
that female mammals have evolved this mechanism to relax Xi
silencing to increase the expression of immunity-related genes
that may be beneficial for fighting infection. Lymphocyte gene
expression from the Xi could be caused by escape from XCI or
gene reactivation. Although 10% of human X-linked genes
exhibit variable escape among individuals and in tissues (23,
26), it is unlikely that X-linked autoimmunity-related genes are
escaping X silencing in lymphocytes. Escape from XCI has been
profiled in human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells, and CD40LG and CXCR3 were not expressed
from the Xi in any of these cell types (26). Our observations of T
cells with biallelic expression suggests that the origin is likely due
to gene-specific reactivation in a subpopulation of female lym-
phocytes, which results in increased expression. We speculate that

 immunity-related genes such as CD40LG and CXCR3 might be
more susceptible to reactivation from the Xi in lymphocytes be-
cause of the euchromatic chromatin of the Xi. Another possibility
is that immunity-related genes on chrX.q13, the region containing
the XIST gene, can become reactivated and expressed from the
Xi because XIST RNA is not localized to the Xi in naïve
lymphocytes (Fig. 1). Support for this hypothesis is the obser-
vation that human female pluripotent stem cells lacking XIST
RNA reactivate regions of the Xi and overexpress X-linked genes
(56, 57).
Whereas the majority of naive human and mouse peripheral T
cells lacked XIST/Xist RNA association with the Xi, a minority
(∼1–5%) contained type I XIST RNA clouds. These few cells
could either represent a specific subset of T cells where XIST
remains localized to the Xi, or alternatively could represent
circulating antigen-stimulated T cells. Our data contrasts with a
previous study by Savarese et al. in which the absence of Xist
RNA clouds and H3K27me3 was noted in immature lympho-
cytes, but Xist RNA clouds were observed in ∼50% in mature T
and B cells (31). This discrepancy could be due to activation of
an immune response in the animals from the Savarese et al. study
before cell isolation. Savarese et al. also examined whether genes
on the Xi were reactivated in immature lymphocytes by using F1
hybrid mice carrying an Xist deletion on the maternal allele,
where reactivated genes would be expressed from the paternal
allele. The authors examined four X-linked genes, Xist, G6pd,
Pctk1, and Pgk1, and did not observe any expression from the
paternal X by using allele-specific RT-PCR. However, this study
did not examine the expression of X-linked immunity-related
genes in lymphocytes from these F1 hybrid animals, which may
be expressed at higher levels.
Recent work has identified new Xist RNA binding proteins
that function in the initiation or maintenance of XCI in mice
(58–60). YY1 and hnRNPU are known Xist RNA binding pro-
teins that localize the RNA to the Xi during the initiation of XCI
(YY1) and maintenance phase (hnRNPU) (49, 50). YY1 can
also recruit a variety of proteins to DNA, most notably polycomb
repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 (61–63). Importantly,
these complexes are involved in initiating XCI during early
development (43, 64–66). Our studies have identified a previously
unidentified localization function for these proteins: the return
of XIST/Xist RNA to the Xi during the transition from quies-
cence to activation in female lymphocytes. The YY1 knockout
and knockdown studies indicate that this protein is required for
the early stages of Xist/XIST cloud formation during lymphocyte
activation, suggesting that XIST RNA return to the Xi precedes
PRC2 deposition of H3K27me3. Importantly, these observations
provide a testable model system to investigate the mechanisms of
Xist/XIST RNA cloud formation in both mouse and human lym-
phocytes. Naïve lymphocytes express low levels of YY1 and
hnRNPU, which may explain why the XIST/Xist RNA transcript
does not remain associated with the Xi in these cells. Activated
lymphocytes contain greater amounts of these proteins, probably
due to genome-wide transcriptional activation that occurs together
with increased cell proliferation as naïve lymphocytes exit quies-
cence. Additional experiments are necessary to determine how the
nuclear organization context (quiescent versus activated) and the
concentration of Xist binding proteins influences Xist RNA re-
cruitment back to the Xi. With the recent findings that Xist RNA
physically interacts with 80–250 proteins (60), it is likely that ad-
ditional proteins will be required to localize XIST/Xist back to
the Xi.
The only human female cells previously shown to lack XIST
RNA clouds are a predominant subset (class III) of female plu-
ripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with an “eroded” Xi (56, 57, 67). Fe-
male hPSCs are epigenetically unstable for XCI, and these cells will
irreversibly silence the XIST gene during routine culture. Class III
hPSCs also lack cytologically visible enrichment of H3K27me3,
H4K20me, macroH2A, and H2A-ub on the Xi (46, 68, 69),
resulting in a partially reactivated Xi. These cells overexpress a
variable set of X-linked genes (56, 57), indicating that loss of XIST
RNA doesn’t always reactivate the same genes or regions in hPSCs.
However, gene reactivation from the Xi in the absence of XIST/Xist
RNA may be more uniform in human and mouse lymphocytes.
Deletion of Xist in the hematopoietic cell lineage partially reac-
tivates the Xi, resulting in increased expression of ∼86 X-linked
genes in blood cells, some which are involved in hematopoiesis and
cell cycle regulation (70). Interestingly, this list includes two immu-
nity genes CXCR3 and TRL7 whose overexpression is associated
with lupus (71–73), which suggests that immunity-related genes are
somehow poised for reactivation in the blood lineage when Xist
RNA is missing. Future work is required to determine the specificity
of X-linked gene reactivation when Xist is deleted, and how partial
reactivation of Xi changes depending on the cell type.
Materials and Methods
Mammalian Cell Isolation and Lines. Human naïve lymphocytes (all deidentified)
were collected by the University of Pennsylvania Pathology BioResouce Human
Immunology Core facility. Immortalized B-cell lines [generated by infection with
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)] from five pediatric SLE patients and three healthy
females (all deidentified) were derived by Hakon Hakonerson’s group at the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and approved by the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia Institutional Review Board (IRB). Patients and their families were
recruited through the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia clinic or CHOP out-
reach clinics. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants or
their parents by using IRB-approved consent forms before enrollment in the
project. In vitro activation of lymphocytes is described in SI Materials and
Methods. Animal experiments were approved by the University of Penn-
sylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
RNA FISH, DNA FISH, and Immunofluorescence. RNA and DNA FISH were carried
out as described (56, 67, 74). Human XIST probe (exon 1) and mouse Xist probe
(Sx9) were labeled by nick translation with Cy3‐dUTP, and COT‐1 DNA was la-
beled with fluoroscein‐12‐dUTP. Three oligo probes (20 nt in length) specific for
XIST were designed to recognize regions within exon 1, and labeled with one
Cy3 molecule at the 5′ end (IDT). StarFISH X chromosome paints (Cambio) for
DNA FISH were hybridized per manufacturer’s instructions.
