Abstract
Background and objectives Poor cognition can affect educational attainment, but the extent of neurocognitive
impairment in children with CKD is not well understood. This systematic review assessed global and domain-
specific cognition and academic skills in children with CKD and whether these outcomes varied with CKD stage.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements Electronic databases were searched for observational studies of
childrenwithCKDages21yearsoldoryoungerthatassessedneurocognitiveoreducationaloutcomes.Riskofbias
was assessed using a modified Newcastle–Ottawa scale. We used random effects models and expressed the
estimates as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals stratified by CKD stage.
Results Thirty-four studies (25 cross-sectional, n=2095; nine cohort, n=991) were included. The overall risk of bias
was high because of selection and measurement biases. The global cognition (full-scale intelligence quotient) of
children with CKD was classified as low average. Compared with the general population, the mean differences
(95% confidence intervals) in full-scale intelligence quotient were 210.5 (95% confidence interval, 213.2 to 27.72;
all CKD stages, n=758), 29.39 (95% confidence interval, 212.6 to 26.18; mild to moderate stage CKD, n=582),
216.2 (95% confidence interval, 233.2 to 0.86; dialysis, n=23), and 211.2 (95% confidence interval, 217.8 to 24.50;
transplant, n=153). Direct comparisons showed that children with mild to moderate stage CKD and kidney
transplants scored 11.2(95% confidence interval,2.98 to 19.4) and10.1(95% confidence interval,21.81 to 22.0) full-
scale intelligence quotient points higher than children on dialysis. Children with CKD also had lower scores than
the general population in executive function and memory (verbal and visual) domains. Compared with children
without CKD, the mean differences in academic skills (n=518) ranged from 215.7 to 21.22 for mathematics, from
29.04 to 20.17 for reading, and from 214.2 to 2.53 for spelling.
Conclusions Children with CKD may have low-average cognition compared with the general population,
with mild deficits observed across academic skills, executive function, and visual and verbal memory.
Limited evidence suggests that children on dialysis may be at greatest risk compared with children with mild
to moderate stage CKD and transplant recipients.

Introduction
CKD has known detrimental effects on children’s
physical health and wellbeing, and there is increasing
awareness of its potential effect on neurocognitive
function, academic outcomes, and mental health (1–
3). The pathophysiologic effects of advanced uremia
and anemia seen in CKD may alter brain metabolism
and impair neurocognitive function through changes to
neuronal myelination and synaptic development (4).
CKD treatment regimens can also disrupt school atten-
dance and compromise academic achievement, with
potential consequences for educational and vocational
attainment as children transition to adulthood (4,5).
In children and adolescents with CKD, evidence
regarding the effect of reduced kidney function on
neurocognitive function varies substantially across
studies. A number of studies have identified lower
nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and motor per-
formance in children with kidney disease compared
with healthy age-matched controls (6–11). Some have
found no significant differences in memory (verbal
and nonverbal) between children with and without
CKD (11). Others have reported specific deficits in
complex auditory attention, verbal working memory,
and the recognition of emotional states (11,12). The
extent and patterns of neurocognitive and academic
impairment in children may also vary by CKD stage.
The overall IQ score for children treated with hemo-
dialysis seems to be lower than that of children with
moderate stage CKD and those with kidney

 transplants (13–15). Nonetheless, several studies have found
improvement in IQ, attention, and mental processing speed
after transplantation (16,17).
The objectives of this systematic review were to assess
global and domain-specific neurocognitive function and
academic skills in children with CKD and whether these
outcomes worsen with advancing CKD stage.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a systematic review of observational studies
on the basis of standard methods and reporting criteria in the
Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
guidelines (18). The protocol was registered with the Interna-
tional Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(CRD42014013056).
Studies were included if they assessed neurocognitive or
academic outcomes in children and adolescents (ages ,21
years old) with CKD. We included studies where compar-
isons were made between patients with CKD and patients
without CKD, either indirectly using normative population
data or directly using matched non-CKD cohorts and/or
between different stages of CKD (mild to moderate stage
CKD, dialysis, and transplant). Prospective cohort and
cross-sectional designs were eligible.
MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from
database inception to December 2016, with no language
restrictions (Supplemental Table 1). We also hand searched the
reference lists of identified studies and review articles. Two
authors (K.C. and A.v.Z.) screened the titles and abstracts, and
they independently assessed the full-text articles to identify
studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer
(G.W.) adjudicated where disagreement arose.
Data extraction was carried out using standard extraction
forms. Studies reported in non-English languages were trans-
lated before assessment. Where more than one publication of
a study existed, only the publication with the most complete
data was included for meta-analysis. We sought data on the
age, socioeconomic status, duration of CKD of study partic-
ipants, and raw scores from cognitive testing from study
authors and reported these findings where available.
Risk of Bias Assessment
Two authors (K.C. and M.D.) undertook independent
quality assessment of the included studies. We used a mod-
ified Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess risk of bias. Differences
were resolved by discussion until consensus was achieved.
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analyses
We summarized the overall and domain-specific neuro-
cognitive and academic estimates between those with and
without CKD using random effects models stratified by CKD
stage (mild to moderate stage CKD, dialysis, and transplant),
with the summary estimates expressed as mean differences
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and effect sizes
reported as Cohen d values. We compared estimates against
the population norm for standardized measures of intelli-
gence (Wechsler scales: mean =100, SD=15; IQ classification:
80–89 low average, 90–109 average, and 110–119 high
average [19]), academic achievement (Wechsler Individual
Achievement Test [WIAT] and Wide Range Achievement
Test [WRAT]), attention (Conners Continuous Performance
Test [CPT]), executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of
Executive Function [BRIEF]), and memory (Wide Range
Assessment of Memory and Learning [WRAML]). Where
possible, comparisons were also made between children with
CKD and age-matched controls. Unless specified, a lower
score was indicative of poorer outcomes. We also compared
the overall and domain-specific cognitive and academic
estimates between CKD stages if data were available.
Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test
and the I2 statistic. Possible sources of heterogeneity were
investigated using subgroup analysis and metaregression
(random effects model) on publication year, country of
publication, study design, study size, and risk of bias.
Meta-regression was conducted where ten or more studies
for the specified outcomes were available. Funnel plots
were generated to assess publication bias. All analyses
were conducted using Review Manager Version 5 and
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.
Results
Characteristics of Included Studies
Of 7437 records identified, 34 studies (25 cross-sectional
and nine cohort) with 3086 children and adolescents were
included, and findings from 18 studies were used in the
meta-analyses (Figure 1). The studies were conducted in nine
countries, including the United States (59%), The Netherlands
(9%), Canada (6%), Egypt (6%), and Finland (6%). Of those
with CKD (n=2446), 2092 (85.5%) had mild to moderate stage
CKD, 115 (4.7%) were on dialysis, and 239 (9.8%) had kidney
transplants. Neurocognitive function was measured by 51
different tests, with full-scale IQ being the most frequently
reported outcome followed by verbal and performance IQ,
memory, attention, and executive function (Figure 2 A–C,
Supplemental Tables 2 and 3, Table 1).
Risk of Bias and Publication Bias Assessment
The overall risk of bias was high (Figure 3). Seventeen
(50%) studies described the recruitment strategies, and only
nine (26%) had participation rates of .70%. Twenty-three
(68%) studies did not report an objective assessment of the
exposure (CKD) with blinding to outcome. Conduct of
statistical methods was adequate in 21 (62%) studies. Ad-
justment for confounders was conducted in 20 (59%) studies.
Asymmetry of funnel plots also indicated potential publica-
tion bias for studies conducted with different CKD groups
(Supplemental Table 4).
Association between CKD and Neurocognitive Functioning
Intelligence (25 Studies, 1446 Patients). The Wechsler
scales were the most frequently used instruments (n=22
studies) for assessing intellectual functioning (20). The
mean global intelligence (full-scale IQ) of all children with
CKD was 92.7 (SD=16.2; n=758). Children with mild to
moderate stage CKD scored 29.39 (95% CI, 212.6 to
26.18), 28.07 (95% CI, 212.2 to 23.90), and 28.73 (95% CI,
212.8 to 24.69) points on full-scale IQ, verbal IQ, and
performance IQ, respectively, compared with the general
population. The full-scale IQ, verbal IQ, and performance
IQ scores were 216.2 (95% CI, 233.2 to 0.86), 214.1 (95%
CI, 233.2 to 4.89), and 215.5 (95% CI, 237.3 to 6.21) points
for children on dialysis compared with the general
388

 population, respectively. Transplant recipients scored
211.2 (95% CI, 217.8 to 24.50), 24.06 (95% CI, 211.1 to
3.03), and 210.5 (95% CI, 216.8 to 24.13) points on full-
scale IQ, verbal IQ, and performance IQ, respectively,
compared with the population norm.
For studies that included age-matched controls, children
with mild to moderate stage CKD scored 216.2 (95% CI,
222.2 to 210.1), 27.84 (95% CI, 213.5 to 22.20), and 211.7
(95% CI, 213.2 to 210.2) points on full-scale IQ, verbal IQ,
and performance IQ, respectively, compared children
without kidney disease. Children on dialysis scored
229.5 (95% CI, 238.5 to 220.5), 218.2 (95% CI, 223.2 to
213.2), and 221.1 (95% CI, 229.2 to 213.0) points on full-
scale IQ, verbal IQ, and performance IQ, respectively,
compared with age-matched controls. The full-scale IQ for
transplant recipients was 229.4 (95% CI, 253.9 to 24.77)
points compared with age-matched controls. Five studies
(n=168) compared intellectual functioning across CKD
stage. Compared with children on dialysis, the average
full-scale IQ score was 11.2 points higher among children
with mild to moderate stage CKD (95% CI, 2.98 to 19.4).
There may be improvement after transplantation, because
transplant recipients scored 10.1 (95% CI, 21.81 to 22.0)
points higher in full-scale IQ than children on dialysis.
Attention (13 Studies, 1366 Patients). The Conners' CPT
(five studies; n=875) was the most frequently used instrument
to assess attention, with higher T scores (mean =50; SD=10)
reflecting greater impairment (21,22). Children with CKD
had equivalent scores to the population norms for variabil-
ity (0.10; 95% CI, 21.02 to 1.22), but scores were 1.70 (95%
CI, 0.32 to 3.08) and 1.70 (95% CI, 0.58 to 2.82) points higher
in the omission and commission errors subtests, respec-
tively, and 21.80 (95% CI, 23.39 to 20.21) points in reaction
time.
Executive Function (11 Studies, 1390 Patients) Five
studies used the BRIEF, which assesses executive function

 using T scores (mean =50; SD=10), where higher T scores
indicate greater impairment (23). Compared with the general
population, children with mild to moderate stage CKD
scored 3.50 (95% CI, 1.97 to 5.03), 5.90 (95% CI, 4.34 to
7.46), and 5.20 (95% CI, 3.64 to 6.76) points higher in the
behavior regulation, metacognition, and global executive
indices of the BRIEF, respectively. This pattern of deficit was
less consistent among transplant recipients, who scored
21.70 (95% CI, 25.88 to 2.48) points compared with the
general population in behavior regulation but 11.4 (95% CI,
0.75 to 22.1) and 5.80 (95% CI, 22.11 to 13.7) points higher in
the metacognition and global executive indices, respectively.
Memory (12 Studies, 615 Patients) The WRAML was
used to assess three domains of memory (verbal memory,
visual memory, and acquisition of new learning) in five
studies (mean =10; SD=3). Compared with children without
CKD, those with mild to moderate stage CKD scored lower
in the subtests of verbal memory (story memory, sentence
memory, and number/letter) and visual memory (picture
memory, design memory, and finger windows). Transplant
recipients scored 211.2 (95% CI, 218.4 to 24.01), 211.3 (95%
CI, 217.1 to 25.55), and 213.4 (95% CI, 219.5 to 27.26)
points in verbal, visual and screening memory, respectively,
compared with the general population.
Association between CKD and Educational Outcomes (Ten
Studies, 808 Patients)
The WIAT and the WRAT were used to measure academic
skills (mean =100; SD=15), with outcomes commonly reported
as reading, mathematics, and spelling (Supplemental Table 2)
(24–26). Overall, the scores for children with mild to moderate
stage CKD were 25.19 (95% CI, 28.14 to 22.25), 21.50 (95%
CI, 22.56 to 20.43), 29.58 (95% CI, 216.0 to 3.12), and 25.18
(95% CI, 28.28 to 22.09) points in reading accuracy, reading
comprehension, mathematics, and spelling, respectively, com-
pared with the general population (Supplemental Figure 1).

 Transplant recipients scored 29.31 (95% CI, 216.7 to 21.90),
212.0 (95% CI, 213.0 to 211.1), and 29.20 (95% CI, 211.2 to
27.25) points on reading accuracy, mathematics, and spelling
compared with the general population. The greatest differ-
ences were seen in children on dialysis, who scored 210.0 (95%
CI, 211.5 to 28.46), 211.0 (95% CI, 212.5 to 29.46), and 215.0
(95% CI, 216.5 to 213.5) points on reading, arithmetic, and
spelling, respectively, compared with the population norm.
In studies with healthy age-matched controls, children
with mild to moderate stage CKD scored 20.60 (95% CI,
28.44 to 7.24) and 27.25 (95% CI, 28.89 to 25.62) points in
reading accuracy and mathematics, respectively, but 0.40
(95% CI, 21.42 to 2.22) and 4.76 (95% CI, 20.52 to 10.0)
points higher in reading comprehension and spelling, re-
spectively. For children on dialysis, reading, arithmetic, and
spelling scores were lower by 210.0 (95% CI, 211.9 to 28.08),
23.00 (95% CI, 24.92 to 21.08), and 211.0 (95% CI, 212.5 to
29.46) points, respectively, compared with the age-matched
controls. Transplant recipients scored 27.00 (95% CI, 28.39
to 25.61), 210.0 (95% CI, 211.4 to 28.61), and 27.00 (95% CI,
28.39 to 25.61) points on reading, arithmetic, and spelling,
respectively, compared with age-matched controls. Com-
pared with patients on dialysis, transplant recipients gener-
ally had higher scores on reading, arithmetic, and spelling.
Effect of Disease Severity, Duration of Disease, and Age
of Onset
Four studies considered the effect of variables, such disease
severity, duration of CKD, and age of disease onset, on
intellectual functioning and academic achievement in chil-
dren across different CKD stages. Compared with children
with mild to moderate stage CKD, those with advanced stage
CKD had lower full-scale IQ and memory function. Chil-
dren with prolonged duration of reduced kidney function
seemed to have lower memory function and academic
skills compared with children who experienced shorter
duration of CKD. However, the age of disease onset did not
seem to have an effect on the neurocognitive function in
children with CKD.
Subgroup Analyses
With the exception of study sample size, the full-scale IQ
scores did not significantly vary with our hypothesized study-
level sources of variability (Figure 4). The mean differences in
full-scale IQ scores between children with CKD and the
general population in studies published before and after 2010
were 210.4 (95% CI, 212.5 to 28.31) and 29.57 (95% CI, 217.2
to 21.98), respectively. The estimates for cross-sectional and
cohort studies were 29.37 (95% CI, 213.4 to 25.34) and 29.56

 (95% CI, 214.1 to 25.02), respectively. For studies with a
smaller sample size (n#50), the mean difference was 211.7
(95% CI, 212.9 to 210.4) compared with 26.77 (95% CI, 212.4
to 21.10) for studies with larger sample sizes (n.50).
Metaregression
A metaregression (n=11 studies) of full-scale IQ scores
between children with and without CKD showed that
study sample size was the only variable that explained the
high degree of heterogeneity between studies (b=5.31;
SEM=2.01; P,0.01). The coefficients in full-scale IQ scores
between children with CKD and the general population
were 20.51 (SEM=3.01; P=0.86), 0.05 (SEM=3.67; P=0.99),
2.58 (SEM=2.51; P=0.30), and 20.72 (SEM=3.41; P=0.83) for
year of publication (before and after 2010), study designs
(cross-sectional versus cohort studies), country (the United
States versus not the United States), and study quality (low
versus high risk of bias), respectively.
Discussion
Our study findings suggest that children with CKD may
have lower intellectual functioning compared with children
without CKD. Deficits were most apparent in global
intelligence, with children achieving average to low-
average full-scale IQ scores compared with the population
norm. Compared with children with mild to moderate stage
CKD and those with kidney transplants, children on di-
alysis had the lowest full-scale IQ scores. The specific
patterns of deficit were evident for attention, memory, and
executive function domains. For attention, children with
CKD had difficulty in holding information and shifting
from one stimulus to another but displayed intact function
in other areas. Children with CKD had reduced visual and
verbal memory compared with children without CKD. For
executive function, children with CKD had reduced meta-
cognitive skills but preserved behavioral regulation com-
pared with children without CKD. Similar to scores of
intellectual functioning, academic achievement also ranged
from average to low average among children with CKD
compared with the general population, with the greatest
deficit observed in mathematics.
Clinically, scores at least one SD lower in overall in-
telligence and domain-specific cognitive domains place chil-
dren at increased risk of poor academic performance at
school, reduced quality of life, and poor mental health, with

 potential implications for vocational attainment and financial
independence as they transition into adulthood (3,27,28). We
found at least one-SD lower intellectual functioning (full-
scale IQ and performance IQ), academic achievement (total
achievement subdomain), and executive function (initiation,
sustaining, and BRIEF metacognition index subtests) among
children with CKD compared with those without CKD.
Because the SEM of measurement is approximately five
standard points for Wechsler scales and our findings show
differences of more than five standard points, such cognitive
deficits would be considered clinically meaningful (29).
There are also data suggesting that children with more
advanced stage CKD, increased duration of disease, and
younger age of disease onset are associated with an
increased risk of neurocognitive deficit and poor academic
outcomes (15,28). By comparison, studies of children with
epilepsy also show deficits in intellectual functioning: full-
scale IQ mean =85.0 (SD=20.7; n=69), verbal IQ mean =86.9
(SD=22.6; n=69), and performance IQ mean =84.5 (SD=19.4;
n=69) (30). Prior studies have reported that children with
chronic illnesses, such as chronic liver disease (CLD),
experienced comparable deficit in intellectual functioning,
attention, and executive function, but a significant im-
provement in IQ scores was observed in children with CLD
after transplantation (full-scale IQ mean =94.7; SD=13.5;
effect size =20.35; n=134) (31,32). Such deficit in cognitive
function may be associated with poorer academic achieve-
ment, health literacy, and psychologic wellbeing in chil-
dren with CLD (33–35).
Unique metabolic, biochemical, and neurodegenerative
mechanisms may partially explain why the overall in-
tellectual function of children with CKD is reduced com-
pared with the general population. Increased plasma levels
of uremic solutes may cause neurotoxic demyelination and
impair synaptic development (4). CKD-related anemia and
poor nutrition may also reduce the delivery of oxygen to
the brain and alter brain metabolism, whereas secondary
hyperparathyroidism can potentially interfere with neuro-
transmission by increasing calcium levels in the brain (36).
It has been proposed that dialysis itself may also lead to
cognitive impairment through rapid changes in BP causing
brain hypoperfusion as well as the presence of gaseous
microemboli, edema, and ongoing deposition of hemosid-
erin in cerebral parenchyma (37). These intradialytic BP
changes in addition to the increased severity and chronicity

 of pathophysiologic effects related to ESKD, such as
hypertension and poor nutrition, may result in reduced
cognitive function among children on dialysis compared
with those with other CKD stages.
Alongside inherent pathophysiologic factors, the thera-
peutic regimens for CKD may also compromise academic
achievement (2,3). First, the frequency of sleep disturbances
in children with CKD may result in poor concentration,
excessive daytime sleepiness, and lower academic perfor-
mance (38). Second, the interactions of complex medication
routines and strict dialysis cycles may decrease attentional
control, working memory, and executive function, cogni-
tive domains that are important to children’s ability to
acquire, understand, and retain information in social and
educational environments (37,39,40). In particular, lower
mathematic scores may be attributed to the reduced overall
neurocognitive function of children with CKD, with fluid
reasoning and processing speed having direct and indirect
effects on mathematic ability (41,42). Studies examining the
relationship between intelligence (full-scale IQ) and aca-
demic performance reported a moderate and statistically
significant correlation moderated by factors, such as
attendance, motivation, home and school environments,
and cultural demographics (3,43). Across all CKD stages,
we have shown that intelligence is largely consistent with
academic skills. Third, ongoing dialysis sessions and re-
covery from transplant surgeries may reduce the amount
and regularity of time spent in the classroom, with chronic
absenteeism potentially preceding loss of interest, with-
drawal, and poor school progression (2,44,45). Importantly,
low-average cognition and academic skills suggest that
children receiving dialysis may be at greatest risk com-
pared with those in other CKD groups. Therefore, educa-
tional support programs should aim to minimize deficits in
attention, memory, and executive function and navigate
the logistic restrictions of rigorous management regimens
for CKD through a multidisciplinary approach. Identifica-
tion of the biopsychosocial factors associated with im-
proved neurocognitive and educational outcomes and the
involvement of relevant expert teams may inform the
development of a comprehensive post-transplant rehabil-
itation service for children and adolescents with CKD.
This systematic review synthesizes all published evi-
dence on global and domain-specific cognitive and aca-
demic outcomes in children and adolescents with CKD,
including variation across CKD stage. Our findings pro-
vide relevant prognostic information on how advancing
CKD stage may affect neurocognitive and academic out-
comes, while exploring the effect of publication year, study
size, and study design on these outcomes. Nonetheless,
there are some potential limitations. We combined all
studies of intelligence (IQ) that used the Wechsler scales.
However, the composition of IQ has evolved over time,
with newer versions of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children focusing more on fluid reasoning than crystal-
lized knowledge (46–48). Because of the variability in
exposure groups, outcome measures, and reporting, meta-
analyses of estimates for outcomes including attention,
executive function, and memory were not possible. Al-
though heterogeneity was partially explained by study
size, not all of the sources of variability could be identified.
Small sample sizes may have insufficient power and thus,
reduce the likelihood that a statistically significant result
reflects a true effect. Nonetheless, additional factors to
consider for the unexplained heterogeneity include partic-
ipant demographics, such as age, socioeconomic status,
severity of CKD, duration of disease, and age of onset;
study-level factors, such as use of direct controls (versus
normative population data); and the breadth of outcome
measures used. Data on CKD-related clinical factors, such
as low birth weight, hypertension, and nutritional status,
were also not available from included studies. As such, we
could not assess the potential confounding effects of these
factors on the association between reduced kidney function
and cognition in our analyses. Lastly, because the majority
of studies have cross-sectional designs, we could not assess
the longitudinal change in cognitive function with advanc-
ing CKD stage.

 Our findings suggest that children with CKD may have
low-average neurocognitive and academic outcomes.
Although cognition seems to worsen with advancing
CKD, with the poorest performance observed in children
on dialysis, the magnitude and domain-specific patterns
of effect are not clearly defined in the existing literature.
Well conducted longitudinal studies assessing multiple
cognitive domains as children progress through different

 CKD stages are needed to better elucidate the association
between reduced kidney function and neurocognitive
function.
