IMPORTANCE Several recent population-based studies have linked exposure to maternal
smoking during pregnancy to increased risk of severe mental illness in offspring (eg, bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia). It is not yet clear, however, whether this association results from
causal teratogenic effects or from confounding influences shared by smoking and severe
mental illness.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between smoking during pregnancy and severe
mental illness in offspring, adjusting for measured covariates and unmeasured confounding
using family-based designs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study analyzed population register data through
December 31, 2013, for a cohort of 1 680 219 individuals born in Sweden from January 1, 1983,
to December 31, 2001. Associations between smoking during pregnancy and severe mental
illness in offspring were estimated with adjustment for measured covariates. Cousins and
siblings who were discordant on smoking during pregnancy and severe mental illness were
then compared, which helped to account for unmeasured genetic and environmental
confounding by design.
EXPOSURES Maternal self-reported smoking during pregnancy, obtained from antenatal
visits.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Severe mental illness, with clinical diagnosis obtained from
inpatient and outpatient visits and defined using International Classification of Diseases codes
for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
RESULTS Of the 1 680 219 offspring included in the analysis, 816 775 (48.61%) were female.
At the population level, offspring exposed to moderate and high levels of smoking during
pregnancy had greater severe mental illness rates than did unexposed offspring (moderate
smoking during pregnancy: hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.30; high smoking during
pregnancy: HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.44-1.59). These associations decreased in strength with
increasing statistical and methodologic controls for familial confounding. In sibling
comparisons with within-family covariates, associations were substantially weaker and
nonsignificant (moderate smoking during pregnancy: HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.94-1.26; high
smoking during pregnancy: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96-1.35). The pattern of associations was
consistent across subsets of severe mental illness disorders and was supported by further
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This population- and family-based study failed to find support
for a causal effect of smoking during pregnancy on risk of severe mental illness in offspring.
Rather, these results suggest that much of the observed population-level association can be
explained by measured and unmeasured factors shared by siblings.

aternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) is associ-
ated with a breadth of adverse offspring
outcomes, including pregnancy-related, neurode-
velopmental, and behavioral problems.1-3 In particular,
recent studies have provided novel evidence of associations
between SDP and offspring bipolar disorder,4 schizophrenia,5
and related outcomes.6 These associations raise the possi-
bility that SDP exposure has causal teratogenic eff
ects on the risk of severe mental illness (SMI).7 Because
nicotine and carbon monoxide cross the placenta and may
directly and indirectly (eg, via hypoxia) affect fetal
neurodevelopment,8 this hypothesis is biologically plau-
sible. Moreover, 8% of pregnant women in the United States
smoke,9 meaning that SDP exposure could represent a
potentially modifiable and important source of risk for
SMI.10 Recent editorials have made explicit causal claims
regarding teratogenic effects of SDP on offspring neurode-
velopment and psychopathology.11,12
Understanding the processes underlying associations
between SDP and offspring SMI is essential to evaluating a
teratogenic hypothesis. Some animal research is consistent
with a possible SDP effect on schizophrenia risk,7 whereas
prior human observational studies have found inconsistent
evidence,13-18 possibly because of differences in methodolo-
gies and statistical power.5 One study of bipolar disorder, for
example, found that the SDP association was greatly attenu-
ated when adjusted for parental characteristics,19 suggesting
that family background, rather than a teratogenic effect, may
explain the association.
Tests of teratogenic SDP hypotheses that use observa-
tional data are, more broadly, subject to the serious threat of
confounding from unmeasured familial factors, including
other prenatal exposures, postnatal environments, and
genetically transmitted risk of SMI and other psychopathol-
ogy (ie, passive gene-environment correlation).2,20,21
Indeed, there is reason to suspect that familial factors may
contribute to associations between maternal SDP and off-
spring SMI, as the association between an individual’
s own
smoking and risk of psychosis is partially explained by
shared familial risk.22 Numerous sibling comparison studies
have demonstrated substantial familial confounding of
associations between SDP and offspring outcomes, includ-
ing intellectual performance, academic achievement, exter-
nalizing psychopathology, and criminality,1,23-28 with few
exceptions.29-32 This confounding appears to result from
shared genetic influences in mothers and offspring.33,34
Thus, there is a clear need for well-powered studies that can
more fully account for familial confounding in the associa-
tion between SDP and offspring SMI.
The present study used population-level data and
family-based comparisons of cousins and siblings to exam-
ine the association between SDP and multiple indices of
offspring SMI.35-37 Sibling comparisons, in particular, rule
out all genetic and environmental influences that make
siblings similar to one another, producing a strong test of
a teratogenic hypothesis. To our knowledge, this study is
the first such family-based examination of SDP and off-
spring SMI.
Methods
Sample
We analyzed data through December 31, 2013, from single-
birth offspring born in Sweden from January 1, 1983, to De-
cember 31, 2001. As described previously,24,25 these data were
drawn from the following merged Swedish population regis-
ters: (1) Medical Birth Register (live births and antenatal care
visits in Sweden since 1973),38 (2) Multi-Generation Register
(familial relationships for individuals born since 1932 and liv-
ing in Sweden since 1961),39 (3) National Patient Register (na-
tionwide inpatient psychiatric hospital admissions since 1987
andoutpatientspecialistvisitssince2001),40(4)NationalCrime
Register (criminal convictions for those aged 15 years or older
since 1973),41 (5) Education Register (highest level of formal
education since 1990),42 (6) Cause of Death Register (dates and
causes of death since 1961),43 and (7) Migration Register (dates
of emigration out of Sweden since 1915).44
Of the 1 878 371 single births during the included period,
1 809 183 (96.3%) offspring were still living in Sweden at age
12 years and were therefore included in this study. We sequen-
tially excluded offspring missing data on paternity (n = 9532),
SDP (n = 110 101), paternal (n = 7002) or maternal (n = 2280)
educational level, or paternal (n = 35) or maternal (n = 14)
nationality, resulting in a complete case cohort of 1 680 219
offspring (89.5% of the target population of single births).
This study was approved by the Indiana University Institu-
tional Review Board and the Regional Ethical Review Board
in Stockholm.
Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy
From 1983 onward, mothers reported their daily cigarette
smoking quantity at the first antenatal visit, typically in the
first trimester. We contrasted moderate SDP (1-9 cigarettes per
day) and high SDP (≥10 cigarettes per day) with no reported
smoking (Table 1). The antenatal SDP variable has been used
extensively in research and has demonstrated expected asso-
ciations with multiple maternal34 and offspring24,25 behav-
ioral outcomes. In addition, in a validity study of antenatal vis-
its, only 6% of women who denied smoking had cotinine levels
consistent with active smoking.45
Key Points
Question Does exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy
increase the risk of severe mental illness in offspring?
Findings In a population-based cohort of 1.7 million Swedish
offspring, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated
with an increased risk of severe mental illness in offspring.
However, sibling comparisons, which ruled out all genetic and
environmental confounders that make siblings similar, revealed
much weaker and statistically nonsignificant associations.
Meaning This study suggests that much of the association
between smoking during pregnancy and severe mental illness in
offspring is likely explained by familial confounding rather than by
causal teratogenic effects.

 Offspring SMI
We evaluated associations between SDP and first inpatient or
outpatient SMI diagnosis in offspring, requiring offspring to
be at least age 12 years to receive a diagnosis. We defined SMI
diagnoses with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, and International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, codes for
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, which
weadaptedfrompriorSwedishregister–basedresearch(eTable
1 in the Supplement).46,47 The probability of any SMI diagno-
sisbyage25yearswas1.3%(Table1).Becausecomorbiditywith
substance use disorder (SUD) appears to explain much of the
risk of violence among patients with SMI,21 we also identified
patients with SMI and SUD, with onset defined as the first
diagnosis of either disorder.
Measured Covariates
For each offspring, we included covariates for sex, parity, and
maternal and (biological) paternal ages at childbirth. We ad-
ditionally included covariates for maternal and paternal na-
tionality and the highest level of completed education, as well
as any registrations for criminal conviction, hospitalization for
SMI, hospitalization for suicidal behavior, and hospitaliza-
tion for SUD (Table 1).
Statistical Analysis
Follow-up person-time at risk for SMI varied across offspring
andwasright-censoredbytheearliestoccurrenceofdeath,first
emigration out of Sweden, or the end of the study. To account
for this censoring, we used survival analysis to evaluate asso-
ciations between SDP and first SMI diagnosis in offspring, with
offspring age as the timescale.48
First, we plotted cumulative risk (ie, 1 − Kaplan-Meier es-
timates) for SMI conditional on SDP exposure in (1) all off-
spring and (2) the subset of siblings discordant for SDP. Sec-
ond,weestimatedhazardratios(HRs)using4Coxproportional
hazards regressions. Model 1 (population) examined popula-
tion associations, with offspring sex and parity covariates and
robust SEs to account for clustering of offspring born to the
same mother. Model 2 (adjusted) additionally adjusted for ma-
ternal and paternal ages at childbirth and the other measured
parental covariates.
Model 3 (cousin) and model 4 (sibling) compared discor-
dant cousins or siblings in the same family, independent of all
influences that make family members similar to each other.
The sibling comparisons, in particular, enabled strong tests of
a causal teratogenic SDP hypothesis.35-37 If an observed asso-
ciationpersistedinmodel4,theresultwouldbeconsistentwith
the hypothesis that SDP increases the risk of offspring SMI. In
contrast, to the extent that the association was attenuated, the
result would fail to support this causal hypothesis and would
instead suggest that the population association resulted from
familial confounding.
We estimated sibling and cousin associations using fixed-
effects (stratified Cox) regression.49 The sibling models were
stratified on mothers. These models allowed the baseline haz-
ard function to differ across groups of offspring born to dis-
tinctmothers.Wealsoincludedmeasuredcovariatesthatcould

 vary within families. The complete case cohort included a total
of 1 245 299 siblings born to 536 772 distinct mothers. Of these
families, 7201 (1.3%) were discordant on SMI. Among these,
1501 families (20.8%) with 3615 offspring varied in SDP expo-
sure (no, moderate, or high smoking).
The cousin models included all possible nonsibling pairs
of offspring within a maternal-grandmother–descended ex-
tended family (ie, all pairs of offspring of sisters). These mod-
els were stratified on cousin pairs, with robust SEs to adjust
fornonindependenceintroducedbyincludingindividualcous-
ins in multiple cousin pairs. The cousin comparisons in-
cluded 612 191 offspring in 746 063 pairs of cousins who de-
scended from 152 887 distinct maternal grandmothers. Of
these cousin pairs, 7697 (1.0%) were discordant on SMI, among
whom 3140 (40.8%; descended from 1799 maternal grand-
mothers) were discordant on SDP (eTable 2 in the Supplement
provides exposure and outcome discordant samples for the
other outcomes).
Becauseoftheirrelianceonwithin-familydiscordance,sib-
ling comparisons can be subject to bias due to carryover ef-
fects from 1 sibling to another (eg, if an offspring’
s SDP expo-
sure influences siblings’SMI risk), measurement error, or
unmeasured within-family confounding.36,50 Sibling compari-
sons may also have reduced power or generalizability. We used
6 alternative approaches to examine the validity of the sib-
ling comparison associations. First, we included cousin com-
parisons. Although they rule out less familial confounding by
design (because of differences among sisters in the maternal
generation), cousin comparisons are less likely to be biased by
carryover effects. Cousins are also more likely to be differen-
tiallyexposed,whichincreasespowerandgeneralizability.Sec-
ond, to further examine generalizability, we estimated popu-
lation associations in families with multiple vs single included
offspring (the latter are excluded from sibling comparisons be-
cause they cannot provide information). Third, to evaluate any
possibleeffectofdecreasesovertimeintheprevalenceofSDP,51
we stratified population analyses by time. Fourth, to further
examine associations independent of carryover and birth-
order effects, we compared first-born cousins. Fifth, to exam-
ine the possibility that low power or SDP measurement error
resultedinunderestimatedwithin-familyassociations,wecon-
ducted logistic regressions predicting birth outcomes gener-
ally understood to be causally affected by SDP (ie, small for
gestational age [birthweight >2 SDs below the gestational
age–specific mean] and preterm birth [gestational age <37
weeks]).1,2,23,51 These models additionally controlled for year
of birth. Finally, to examine the potential effect of missing SDP
data, we conducted analyses assuming that all missing val-
ues were either high SDP or no SDP. We analyzed data using
SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), and Stata, version 13.1
(StataCorp).
Results
Maternal SDP and Any Offspring SMI
Offspring with any SDP exposure had a greater risk of any
SMI than did offspring without SDP exposure (Figure 1). In
contrast, the difference in risks was greatly attenuated when
we limited the Kaplan-Meier estimates to discordantly
exposed siblings, which was inconsistent with a teratogenic
hypothesis.
Cox proportional hazards regressions confirmed this pat-
tern (Table 2 and Figure 2). At the population level, offspring
with moderate SDP had a 25% greater rate of any SMI than did
offspring with no SDP (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.30), and off-
spring with high SDP had a 51% greater rate (HR, 1.51; 95% CI,
1.44-1.59). Adjusting for confounding via measured parental
covariates began to attenuate these associations (moderate
SDP: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.17; high SDP: HR, 1.27, 95% CI;
1.20-1.33), whereas the cousin comparison did not substan-
tially attenuate the associations further (moderate SDP: HR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24; high SDP: HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36).
Sibling comparison associations were weaker still and were not

Maternal SDP and Specific Offspring SMI Disorders
Disorder-specific results are reported in Table 2 and Figure 2
(eFigure in the Supplement presents disorder-specific Kaplan-
Meier estimates). For bipolar disorder, the pattern of associa-
tionswassimilartothatofanySMI.Atthepopulationlevel,mod-
erate SDP was associated with a 29% greater rate of offspring
bipolar disorder compared with no SDP, and high SDP was as-
sociated with a 54% greater rate. However, in the sibling com-
parison, the moderate (6% greater rate) and high (15% greater
rate) SDP associations were greatly attenuated and not statis-
tically significant. For offspring schizophrenia spectrum disor-
ders, most of the association could be attributed to confound-
ing from measured parental covariates in the adjusted model,
and the sibling comparison associations were again not statis-
tically significant. For comorbid SMI and SUD in offspring, the
population association was stronger (eg, a greater rate by a fac-
tor of 233% for high SDP), as was the attenuation across mod-
els, such that high SDP was associated with only a 5% greater—
and not statistically significant—rate in the sibling comparison.
We found a similar pattern of results for any offspring SUD di-
agnosis (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

SDP:OR,1.22;95%CI,1.13-1.32).Finally,resultsdidnotmeaning-
fully differ regardless of the coding of missing SDP values.
Discussion
The need to identify environmental risk factors for SMI that
are strongly associated, modifiable, and, most important,
causal has generated interest in findings of associations be-
tween maternal SDP and offspring bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia.52,53 Using data from nearly 1.7 million off-
spring, the present study replicated these associations at the
population level.4,5 Consistent with prior population-based
studies, children of mothers who smoked heavily during preg-
nancy had approximately 1.5 times the rate of developing bi-
polar disorder or schizophrenia spectrum disorders as did
children of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.
Critically, however, adjustment for measured parental co-
variates and unmeasured familial confounding largely attenu-
ated these associations. Indeed, for each SMI outcome, sib-
ling comparisons with within-family covariates yielded small,
nonsignificantdifferencesbetweenoffspringdiscordantforex-
posuretoSDP.Some4,5—butnotall19—recentstudieshavefound
associations between SDP and an increased risk of offspring
SMI even after controlling for measured parental psychiatric
factors and other potential confounders, as did most of our ad-
justed models. However, we found that associations attenu-
ated even further in sibling comparisons. This pattern high-
lightsthevalueoffamily-basedapproachesthatuserelatedness
to rule out passive gene-environment correlation and other fa-
milial factors rather than relying on measured covariates that
may not be assessed or modeled comprehensively.36
Moreover,additionalstrengthsofthepresentstudyincrease
confidenceintheresults.Thesamplewaspopulationbased,in-
cluding 89.5% of single births in Sweden from 1983 to 2001 and
14 215 offspring with SMI diagnoses. Data on SDP and SMI were
collectedprospectivelyandfromdifferingsources(maternalself-
report and clinical diagnoses, respectively). Sibling and cousin
comparisonsandothersensitivityanalysessupportedtheover-
allfindingsindependentoftheassumptionsandlimitationsspe-
cific to each approach (eg, decreased power and generalizabil-
ity in sibling comparisons). Taken in sum, these data provide
strongevidencethatmuchofthepopulationassociationbetween
SDPandoffspringSMIresultsfromsharedriskforbothoutcomes
ratherthanfromatrueteratogeniceffect.IfacausaleffectofSDP
exposure on offspring SMI risk exists, our results suggest that it
islikelytobesubstantiallyweakerthanwouldbeexpectedbased
on the population associations alone.
One question unanswered by the present results is the ex-
actnatureofthefamilialconfounding.Priorquantitativegenetic
studies,33,34 as well as in vitro fertilization–based studies of ge-
neticallyunrelatedmother-offspringpairs,54,55pointtogenetic
confounding,withanadoptionstudyprovidingevidenceagainst
postnatalenvironmentalconfounding.56Atthesametime,there
isemergingevidencethatassociationsbetweensmokingandSMI
also reflect multiple environmentally mediated pathways.22,52
Indeed, we found that population associations between SDP
and offspring SMI strengthened over time. One possible expla-
nationforthischangeisthat,assmokinghasbecomelesspreva-
lent, women who smoked—and smoked during pregnancy—
morerecentlywerethosewiththegreatestliabilityforsubstance
abuse and other psychopathology.57 As a result, the extent of
confounding from familial psychopathology liability may have
expanded. Research is needed to characterize the sources of
confounding observed here.
Limitations
Sibling comparisons have several limitations that we could not
fullyaddress.First,theyaresusceptibletoconfoundingfromun-
measuredfactorsthatmakesiblingsdifferentfromoneanother.
Thewithin-familyassociationsmay,therefore,overestimateor
underestimatethetrueSDPeffect.However,toexplaintheweak
andnonsignificantsiblingdifferencesfoundhere,unmeasured
within-family confounders would have to be positively associ-
ated with SDP and negatively associated with offspring SMI (or
viceversa).Nevertheless,evidencefromotheradvancedobser-
vationalapproacheswithcomplementarystrengths(eg,instru-
mental variable analyses, in vitro fertilization–based designs,
negativecontrols)15,20,58isneededtostrengthenconclusionsfrom
thisstudy.59Second,thematernalreportassessmentofSDPoc-

basedapproaches.60However,previousstudieshavesupported
thevalidityoftheSDPmeasure,andwefoundexpectedwithin-

ing that measurement error alone cannot account for the main
findings.Third,weanalyzedasampleofSwedishoffspringthat

know the extent to which our results will generalize to other
populations or to later-onset SMI. Finally, our analyses cannot
determine whether SDP is more strongly associated with off-
spring SMI in specific subgroups.

 Conclusions
There is extensive and clear evidence that exposure to SDP—in
additiontosmokingitself—hassevereadverseconsequences.52
This study did not, however, support a causal teratogenic
hypothesis specific to offspring SMI, which matches prior
family-based studies of SDP and a range of other offspring
cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric outcomes.1,2 Within-
family and other advanced designs appear to hold promise
for the continued evaluation of environmental risk factors
for SMI.
