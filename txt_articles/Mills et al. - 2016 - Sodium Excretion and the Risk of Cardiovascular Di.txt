IMPORTANCE Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the general population. Prior studies have
produced contradictory results on the association of dietary sodium intake with risk of CVD,
and this relationship has not been investigated in patients with CKD.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between urinary sodium excretion and clinical CVD
events among patients with CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study of patients with CKD from 7
locations in the United States enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study and
followed up from May 2003 to March 2013.
EXPOSURES The cumulative mean of urinary sodium excretion from three 24-hour urinary
measurements and calibrated to sex-specific mean 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite of CVD events defined as congestive heart
failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Events were reported every 6 months and confirmed
by medical record adjudication.
RESULTS Among 3757 participants (mean age, 58 years; 45% women), 804 composite
CVD events (575 heart failure, 305 myocardial infarction, and 148 stroke) occurred during
a median 6.8 years of follow-up. From lowest (<2894 mg/24 hours) to highest
(�4548 mg/24 hours) quartile of calibrated sodium excretion, 174, 159, 198, and 273
composite CVD events occurred, and the cumulative incidence was 18.4%, 16.5%, 20.6%,
and 29.8% at median follow-up. In addition, the cumulative incidence of CVD events in the
highest quartile of calibrated sodium excretion compared with the lowest was 23.2% vs
13.3% for heart failure, 10.9% vs 7.8% for myocardial infarction, and 6.4% vs 2.7% for stroke
at median follow-up. Hazard ratios of the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile
were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09-1.70; P = .007) for composite CVD events, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.03-1.74;
P = .03) for heart failure, and 1.81 (95% CI, 1.08-3.02; P = .02) for stroke after multivariable
adjustment. Restricted cubic spline analyses of the association between sodium excretion
and composite CVD provided no evidence of a nonlinear association (P = .11) and indicated
a significant linear association (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with CKD, higher urinary sodium excretion
was associated with increased risk of CVD.

C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 11%
of the US general population1 and is associated with in-
creased risk of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular
disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality.2,3 Greater than 1 in 3
US adults has CVD, and it is the leading cause of death in the
United States.4 Those with CKD are at increased risk of CVD
compared with those with normal kidney function, and risk
increases as CKD progresses.2,3
A positive association between sodium intake and blood
pressure is well established.5 However, the association be-
tweensodiumintakeandclinicalCVDremainslessclear.6While
some studies reported a J- or U-shaped association between
dietary sodium and CVD,7,8 others found a positive mono-
tonic association between sodium intake and risk of CVD, coro-
nary heart disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), and
stroke.9-11 Methodologic limitations, including inconsisten-
cies in dietary sodium measurement methods, could contrib-
ute to these conflicting findings.6
Blood pressure of patients with CKD is more sensitive to
high sodium intake than persons with normal kidney func-
tion due to a diminished capacity to excrete sodium.12 De-
spite this, there is limited prior research on the association be-
tween dietary sodium intake and CVD among those with
impaired kidney function,13,14 and to our knowledge, no pre-
vious studies have examined the association between so-
dium intake and incident CVD among patients with CKD. In
addition, few studies examining the association between di-
etarysodiumandCVDhaveusedthemeanofmultiple24-hour
urine samples to quantify urinary sodium excretion, which is
considered the best method for estimating usual sodium
intake.6,15Theobjectiveofthisstudywastodeterminethepro-
spective relationship between urinary sodium (and potas-
sium) excretion, estimated from the mean of 3 repeated
24-hour urine samples, and risk of clinical CVD among pa-
tients with CKD enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency
Cohort (CRIC) Study.
Methods
Study Participants
The CRIC Study is an ongoing, multicenter, prospective
cohort study of adults aged 21 to 74 years with mild to mod-
erate CKD designed to identify and examine risk factors for
CKD progression and development of CVD in those with CKD.
Details of the CRIC Study design and methods have been
published previously.16 Briefly, a total of 3939 racially and
ethnically diverse participants, approximately half of whom
had diabetes, were recruited from 7 clinical centers in the
United States from 2003 to 2008. Participants were eligible
for the study if they met age-specific estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) criteria of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Those with a history of kidney transplant, dialysis for at least
1 month, glomerulonephritis requiring immunosuppression,
advanced heart failure, cirrhosis, or polycystic kidney disease
were ineligible.
Institutional review boards at all participating institu-
tions approved the study protocol, and the study adhered to
the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written
informed consent.
Measurements
Self-reported sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics,
medical history, current medication use, and responses to a
food frequency questionnaire,17 which was used to estimate
total calorie intake, were obtained at the baseline visit. Race
was self-reported in response to questions with fixed catego-
ries and was used to calculate eGFR to determine eligibility.
Blood pressure, height, weight, and waist circumference were
measured using standard protocols, and fat-free mass was ob-
tained by bioelectrical impedance analysis.16,18 An overnight
fasting blood sample was collected to measure serum creati-
nine, lipids, and plasma glucose. Serum creatinine measure-
ments were calibrated to isotope dilution mass spectrometry
traceable values. Hypertension was defined as mean blood
pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater or self-reported use of
antihypertensive medication, and diabetes was defined as a
fasting plasma glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater, a nonfasting
plasma glucose 200 mg/dL or greater, or self-reported use of
antidiabetes medication. Glomerular filtration rate was esti-
mated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Col-
laborationequation,whichincludesserumcreatinine,age,sex,
and race.1
Study participants were requested to collect 24-hour
urine specimens at baseline and the first 2 annual follow-up
visits. If either the total urine volume was less than 500 mL
at the end of 24 hours or the duration of collection was not
between 22 and 24 hours, participants were instructed to rec-
ollect the urine sample. Urinary sodium and potassium levels
were measured by flame emission spectrophotometry
(Instrumentation Laboratory Flame Photometer model 943).
Urinary creatinine was measured on a BioTek Plate Reader
ELx808 using a Jaffe reaction with a colorimetric end point
and reagents from Sigma-Aldrich. All laboratory analyses
were conducted at the CRIC Study central laboratory at the
University of Pennsylvania with stringent quality control.
The cumulative mean of 24-hour urinary sodium excre-
tion obtained from the baseline visit and the first 2 annual
follow-up visits prior to developing a study event was calcu-
lated as the exposure variable. This approach was selected to
take full advantage of all available exposure and outcome
data.19 Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium excretion was cali-
brated according to the sex-specific mean of 24-hour urinary
creatinineexcretioninthestudypopulation(1569mg/24hours
in men and 1130 mg/24 hours in women) in order to reduce

ple’
s urinary sodium-to-creatinine ratio by sex-specific mean

24-hour urinary sodium excretion was also used as an expo-
sure variable in sensitivity analyses.
Outcome Assessment
Study participants attended annual clinic visits and received
telephone calls every 6 months between in-person visits. Car-
diovascular clinical outcomes were assessed using a standard

medical event questionnaire at all follow-up contacts. Medi-
cal records were requested for event verification, and 2 phy-
sicians adjudicated each cardiovascular event and classified
them as either probable or definite.16
The primary outcome of interest was composite CVD, de-
fined as the first of CHF, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke
thatoccurredduringfollow-up.Inaddition,CHF,MI,andstroke
were analyzed individually. All included CVD events were non-
fatal. Congestive heart failure was identified by hospital ad-
mission for new or worsening CHF signs and symptoms, in ad-
dition to diminished cardiac output. Myocardial infarction was
defined by characteristic changes in troponin and creatine
kinase–MB levels, symptoms of myocardial ischemia, electro-
cardiogram changes, or new fixed profusion abnormalities.
Stroke was defined as rapid onset of neurologic deficit, head-
ache, or other nonvascular cause and clinically relevant le-
sion on brain imaging for longer than 24 hours or death within
24 hours. All events classified as probable or definite during
adjudication were included in these analyses. Follow-up was
censored at the first of either death, loss to follow-up, with-
drawal, or March 2013.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of study participants were compared
across quartiles of calibrated urinary sodium excretion using
χ2 tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance and
Kruskal-Wallis tests for normally and nonnormally distrib-
uted continuous variables, respectively.
Cumulative incidence of composite CVD, CHF, MI, and
stroke were calculated by quartile of urinary sodium excre-
tion using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the
log-rank test with the null hypothesis that the cumulative in-
cidence was the same among quartiles of sodium excretion.20
Hazards ratios for the associations of urinary sodium excre-
tion with composite CVD, CHF, MI, and stroke were esti-
mated using Cox proportional hazards models with follow-up
time used as the time scale.21 The assumption of proportion-
ality was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and interaction
terms with time for each exposure variable and covariate. No
substantial deviations from proportionality were observed.
Complete case analysis was used for the main findings. Mul-
tiple imputation for missing covariate values was performed
in a sensitivity analysis, and no substantial differences were
observed. Urinary sodium excretion was analyzed in quar-
tiles and as a continuous variable.
Analyses of subgroups defined by sex, age, race, diabetes
status, and history of CVD were performed, and effect modi-
fication was assessed by including interaction terms with cali-
brated sodium excretion in the models. Important covariates
for CVD were selected based on prior knowledge and were ad-
justed in multivariable analyses. First, unmodifiable demo-
graphic risk factors, ie, age, sex, race, and CRIC clinic site, were
adjusted in the multivariable models (model 1). Next, estab-
lished modifiable CVD risk factors were added to the multi-
variable models (model 2): education, waist circumference,
lean body mass index, body mass index, cigarette smoking, al-
cohol drinking, physical activity, low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol level, glucose level, history of CVD, use of antidia-
betic and lipid-lowering medications, use of diuretics, use of
renin-angiotensin system blocking agents and other antihy-
pertensive medications, and urinary creatinine. Finally, eGFR
atbaselinewasincludedinthemultivariablemodels(model3).
Systolic blood pressure was not adjusted in the main analy-
ses because blood pressure might be on the causal pathway be-
tween urinary sodium excretion and CVD events.6 However,
systolic blood pressure was adjusted in sensitivity analyses.
In addition, because 24% of participants were missing data on
total caloric intake, total caloric intake was not adjusted in the
primary analyses but was adjusted in sensitivity analyses.
Possible nonlinear relationships between urinary so-
dium excretion and composite CVD, CHF, MI, and stroke were
examined with restricted cubic splines.22 Analyses were mul-
tivariable-adjusted and used 3 knots, and the 2.5% highest and
lowest sodium excretion observations were trimmed. Knots
were located at the 5%, 50%, and 95% percentiles correspond-
ing to values of calibrated urinary sodium excretion of 2175,
3636, and 6017 mg/d, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were
conducted using alternate middle knot locations of 3800 and
4000 mg/d based on biologic plausibility, as well as using 4
or 5 knots instead of 3 knots. Tests for nonlinearity compar-
ing a model with only the linear term to a model with the lin-
earandrestrictedcubicsplinetermswereconductedusinglike-
lihood ratio tests. If a test for nonlinearity was not significant,
a test for linearity was conducted comparing a model with the
linear term to a model with only the covariates of interest.
All analyses were also conducted with urinary potassium
excretion as the exposure of interest using the same meth-
odologic approach described above. All analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.2, and all hypothesis testing was
2-tailed with P < .05 set as statistically significant.
Results
A total of 3757 participants (mean age, 58 years; 45% women)
were included in this analysis. Participants with incomplete
or missing 24-hour urine collection were excluded (n = 182):
54 participants who did not successfully collect any 24-hour
urine specimens, 126 participants with incomplete 24-hour
urine collection (3 with total urine volume <500 mL, 10 with
collection duration <20 hours, and 113 with total creatinine ex-
cretion<7mg/kgofbodyweight),and2participantswithmean
urinary sodium excretion less than 20 mmol/24 hours. A total
of 2167 participants had 3 sodium measurements, 982 had 2
measurements, and 608 had only 1 measurement. There was
no significant difference in mean urinary sodium excretion be-
tween those with all 3 measurements and those with fewer
(mean [SD], 3725 [1328] mg/24 hours vs 3669 [1586] mg/24
hours; P for difference = .24).
Overall, mean (SD) 24-hour sodium excretion was 3701
(1443) mg. Participants with higher calibrated 24-hour uri-
nary sodium excretion were more likely to be male, white, and
current smokers; report a history of hypertension, diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, and CVD; and take antihypertensive
medications (Table 1). Those with the highest sodium excre-
tion also had the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressure;

els and the lowest low-density and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol values. Urinary potassium and protein excretion
levelswerehighest,whileeGFRwaslowest,inparticipantswith
the highest calibrated sodium excretion.
Over a median 6.8 years of follow-up, 804 composite first
CVD events, 575 CHF events, 305 MI events, and 148 stroke
events occurred, corresponding to incidence rates of 35.7 CVD
events per 1000 person-years, 24.6 CHF events per 1000
person-years, 12.6 MI events per 1000 person-years, and 6.0
stroke events per 1000 person-years. From lowest
(<2894 mg/24 hours) to highest (≥4548 mg/24 hours) quar-
tile of calibrated sodium excretion, the cumulative incidence
of composite CVD at median follow-up was 18.4%, 16.5%,
20.6%, and 29.8% (log-rank P < .001); the cumulative inci-
dence of CHF was 13.3%, 12.0%, 13.3%, and 23.2% (log-rank
P < .001);thecumulativeincidenceofMIwas7.8%,5.8%,8.6%,
and 10.9% (log-rank P < .001); and the cumulative incidence
of stroke was 2.7%, 2.8%, 4.1%, and 6.4% (log-rank P = .001),
respectively (Figure 1 and Table 2).
After adjustment for age, sex, race, and clinic site, those
in the highest quartile of calibrated urinary sodium excretion
were at an increased risk for composite CVD, CHF, MI, and
stroke compared with the lowest quartile of calibrated uri-
nary sodium excretion (Table 2). After additional adjustment
for modifiable CVD risk factors, calibrated sodium excretion
remained significantly associated with composite CVD, CHF,
and stroke but was no longer significantly associated with
MI. In fully adjusted models, including adjustment for base-
line eGFR, the highest quartile of urinary sodium excretion

Because participants who only had urinary sodium excretion measurements after an outcome occurred were excluded from the analysis for that outcome, there are
slightly fewer people at time = 0 years for each individual outcome compared with the 3757 participants described in Table 1, who contributed to at least 1 outcome
but not necessarily all of them.

1.08-3.02]; P = .02), but not with MI (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.79-
1.66]; P = .46). Results for urinary sodium excretion not cali-
brated with urinary creatinine excretion were similar to those
using calibrated urinary sodium excretion (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). For example, compared with the lowest quar-
tile of urinary sodium excretion (<2686 mg/24 hours), those
in the highest quartile of urinary sodium excretion (≥4474
mg/24 hours) were at an increased risk for composite CVD
(HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05-1.72]; P = .02), CHF (HR, 1.25 [95% CI,
0.94-1.67]; P = .12), MI (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.87-1.95]; P = .20),
and stroke (HR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.08-3.33]; P = .03).
Multivariable-adjusted restricted cubic spline analyses
suggested no evidence of a nonlinear association between
calibrated urinary sodium excretion and composite CVD,
MI, or stroke (Figure 2). They also indicated a significant lin-
ear association between calibrated urinary sodium excre-
tion and composite CVD and stroke, but not with MI. There
was no evidence of a nonlinear association between uncali-
brated urinary sodium excretion and any CVD outcome
using restricted cubic spline analyses (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). There was evidence of a significant linear
relationship between uncalibrated urinary sodium excre-
tion and composite CVD (P = .002), stroke (P = .02), and MI
(P = .048).
Hazard ratios for composite CVD, CHF, MI, and stroke
associated with a 1000-mg/24-hour increase in calibrated
urinary sodium excretion were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.16;
P < .001), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.02-1.15; P = .005), 1.07 (95% CI,
0.98-1.16; P = .11), and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05-1.28; P = .003),
respectively (Table 3). The magnitude of these associations
was consistent across predefined subgroups of sex, race, age,
and history of diabetes and CVD, although some did not
reach statistical significance. In addition, no significant P val-
ues for interaction were observed for any of the subgroups of
interest with calibrated sodium excretion. Sensitivity analy-
ses that additionally adjusted for total calorie intake and sys-
tolic blood pressure did not substantially change the magni-
tude of any of the associations between a 1000-mg/24-hour

Baseline characteristics of CRIC participants by quartile of

highest quartile compared with 17.2% in lowest quartile;
log-rank P < .001) and CHF (cumulative incidence of 21.1% in

excretion was no longer associated with any of the outcomes
of interest. Spline analysis showed a significant linear asso-
ciation with composite CVD (P for linearity = .048) and CHF
(P for linearity = .03), but no evidence of an association be-
tween urinary potassium excretion and MI or stroke (eFigure
3 in the Supplement).
In a sensitivity analysis of spline regression using alter-
nate numbers of knots and middle knot locations, the asso-
ciations between 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and
cardiovascular disease were consistent (eTable 5 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the as-
sociation between sodium excretion and CVD incidence in a
population with CKD. These analyses documented a signifi-
cantlyincreasedriskofCVDinindividualswiththehighesturi-
nary sodium excretion independent of several important CVD
risk factors, including use of antihypertensive medications,
baseline eGFR, and history of CVD. Findings were consistent
across subgroups and independent of further adjustment for
total caloric intake and systolic blood pressure. However, CVD
risk was not significantly different among participants with a
urinary sodium excretion of 4547 mg/24 hours or less. These
findings, if confirmed by clinical trials, suggest that moder-
ate sodium reduction among patients with CKD and high so-
dium intake may lower CVD risk.
Very limited prior research on the association of dietary
sodium with the risk of CVD in patients with impaired kidney
function has been conducted.13,14 Dong et al13 reported an in-
crease in risk of CVD mortality in those with the lowest mean
sodium intake measured from a 3-day diet record among 305
Japanese peritoneal dialysis patients in a retrospective co-
hort study. Using data from 2 clinical trials investigating the
efficacyofangiotensinreceptorblockers(ARBs)onkidneyout-
comes in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt proteinuria,
Lambers Heerspink et al14 conducted a post hoc analysis and
found that among those with lower sodium excretion, ARBs
were more effective at decreasing kidney and CVD risk. These
findings from previous studies, conducted in either a retro-
spective cohort of peritoneal dialysis patients or in clinical trial
participants with diabetes and overt proteinuria, are not di-
rectly applicable to patients with CKD in the general popula-
tion. In contrast, the CRIC Study is a large cohort of diverse par-
ticipants with CKD that was designed to investigate risk factors
for CVD in those with CKD. Therefore, this study should pro-
vide an estimate of the association between dietary sodium
intake and CVD incidence that is more applicable to those with
CKD in the general population.
The results of this study provide evidence of a positive re-
lationship between urinary sodium excretion and clinical CVD
with individuals having the highest sodium excretion at the
greatest risk of CVD events. Prior work has reported mixed re-
sults on the nature of the association between dietary so-
dium and CVD. Some prior studies have found a positive as-
sociation between dietary sodium intake and risk of CVD,
coronary heart disease, CHF, and stroke,9-11,23,24 while others
have reported an inverse or J-shaped association between di-
etarysodiumintakeandCVDevents.7,8,25-27Thefindingsinthis
analysis as a whole support a positive association between uri-
nary sodium excretion and CVD, which is particularly strong
in individuals with the highest urinary sodium excretion.
Severalmethodologiclimitationshavebeendescribedthat
might account for the inconsistent findings in the sodium-
CVD association, including measurement error in dietary so-
dium intake, confounding, and collinearity of nutritional ex-
planatoryvariables.6,28Toaddresstheselimitations,thisstudy
used repeated 24-hour urine samples. If conducted properly,
24-hoururinecollectionforsodiumexcretionisconsideredthe
most accurate method of estimating dietary sodium intake at
the individual level. It was estimated that approximately 90%
ofconsumedsodiumisabsorbedandexcretedintheurine,and
the correlation between measured dietary sodium intake and
urinary sodium excretion was more than 0.75.6,15 The CRIC
Study also has well-quantified data on a large number of po-
tential confounding factors that were adjusted in these analy-
ses. In addition, the correlations of urinary sodium excretion
with potential nutritional explanatory variables, including uri-
nary potassium excretion (r = 0.36) and total calorie intake
(r = 0.08), were not very strong in the study sample.
The findings reported here were independent of adjust-
ment for systolic blood pressure, suggesting other mecha-
nisms may play a role in the effect of dietary sodium on CVD
in CKD patients with high proportions of treated blood pres-
sure. This is consistent with previous findings of a positive
association between dietary sodium and CVD independent of
blood pressure.10,23,24 Some possible mechanisms for the
direct effects of dietary sodium intake on CVD include endo-
thelial dysfunction,29 increased oxidative stress leading to
vascular damage,30 insulin resistance,31 and direct effects on
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity.32
This analysis found no significant association between uri-
nary potassium excretion and CVD after multivariable adjust-
ment. Prior work in the general population has found a pro-
tective effect of dietary potassium on CVD risk,33 but to our
knowledge, the association between potassium intake or ex-
cretion and incident CVD has not been investigated in indi-
viduals with CKD. The nature of the associations of dietary po-
tassium intake and excretion with CVD in patients with CKD
is challenging to understand as a result of abnormal potas-
sium homeostasis and the confounding effect of medica-
tions, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers.34 There
is also some uncertainty in the degree to which urinary potas-
sium excretion represents dietary potassium intake, particu-
larly in patients with impaired kidney function.35 In addi-
tion, dietary potassium restriction is often advised for those
with impaired kidney function.36 Further research is needed
to better understand the association between potassium in-
take, potassium excretion, and risk of CVD in those with CKD.
This study should be interpreted in light of several limi-
tations. First, it was not possible to compare clinical out-
comes among patients with urinary sodium excretion less than
2300 mg sodium/day or less than 1500 mg sodium/day, which
are the recommended low sodium targets in the general popu-

lation and in patients with CKD,6,37 because of very small
sample sizes among these subgroups. Second, only three
24-hour urinary specimens were collected, which might not
be enough to accurately reflect habitual intake and could un-
derestimate the associations of interest due to regression di-
lution bias.38 Third, while many potential confounding fac-
tors were adjusted, significant differences across calibrated
sodium quartiles were observed for many baseline variables,
suggesting confounding by unmeasured or unadjusted fac-
tors could be present. Fourth, to our knowledge, the degree
to which urinary sodium excretion approximates dietary so-
diumintakehasnotbeenassessedinpatientswithCKD,whose
altered sodium handling by the kidney might affect the intake-
excretion relationship. Fifth, total energy intake had substan-
tial missing values (24%), so it was not adjusted in the pri-
mary analyses. However, in a sensitivity analysis, the results
did not change significantly after adjustment for total energy
intake, although residual confounding could be present due

on a single food frequency questionnaire.39

AmongpatientswithCKD,higherurinarysodiumexcretionwas
associated with increased risk of CVD.
