Abstract
Aims: Preventing alcohol-related harms, including those causing liver disease, is a public health
priority in the UK, especially in Scotland, but the effects of ethnicity are not known. We assessed
liver- and alcohol-related events (hospitalisations and deaths) in Scotland using self-reported mea-
sures of ethnicity.
Methods: Linking Scottish NHS hospital admissions and mortality to the Scottish Census 2001, we
explored ethnic differences in hospitalisations and mortality (2001–2010) of all liver diseases, alco-
holic liver disease (ALD) and specific alcohol-related diseases (ARD). Risk ratios (RR) were calcu-
lated using Poisson regression with robust variance, by sex, adjusted for age, country of birth and
the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) presented below. The White Scottish population
was the standard reference population with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated to enable
comparison (multiplied by 100 for results).
Results: For all liver diseases, Chinese had around 50% higher risks for men (RR 162; 95% CI 127–
207) and women (141; 109–184), as did Other South Asian men (144; 104–201) and Pakistani
women (140; 116–168). Lower risks for all liver diseases occurred in African origin men (42; 24–
74), other White British men (72; 63–82) and women (80; 70–90) and other White women (80; 67–
94). For ALD, Indians had a 75% higher risk for men (175; 107–287). Other White British men had
about a third lower risk of ALD (63; 50–78), as did Pakistani men (65; 42–99). For ARD, almost
2-fold higher risks existed for White Irish men (182; 161–206) and Any Mixed Background women
(199; 152–261). Lower risks of ARD existed in Pakistani men (67; 55–80) and women (48; 33–70),
and Chinese men (55; 41–73) and women (54; 32–90).

 Conclusions: Substantial variations by ethnicity exist for both alcohol-related and liver disease
hospitalisations and deaths in Scotland: these exist in subgroups of both White and non-White
populations and practical actions are required to ameliorate these differences.
BACKGROUND
Excess alcohol consumption causes cirrhosis of the liver, increases
the risk of certain cancers, stroke, vascular disease and neuropsy-
chiatric disorders and is also strongly associated with external
causes of death, such as suicides and accidents (Rehm et al., 2009).
Hence, excess alcohol consumption is one of the major avoidable
risk factors for mortality globally, and actions to reduce its burden
and health-related costs are urgently needed (Murray et al., 2013).
In the UK, alcohol-related deaths more than doubled between 1991
and 2006 (Scottish Health Survey, 2009; Office for National
Statistics, 2010): they are known to vary by country of birth (COB)
in England and Wales, with men and women born in Scotland and
Ireland being at especially high risk (Bhala et al., 2009, 2010).
Mortality from liver disease, a major cause of alcohol-related
death, has been highlighted as a key issue for preventable mortality in
the UK (Bhala et al., 2013). Moreover, rates of liver cirrhosis deaths
have risen more steeply in Scotland than other places (Leon and
McCambridge, 2006). Increased mortality of other liver diseases (such
as chronic viral hepatitis) in South Asian, Chinese and African popula-
tions, when using COB in UK studies, evidenced by increased compli-
cations such as hepatocellular cancer (Bhala et al., 2010). Although
COB has provided information as a proxy for ethnicity in alcohol- and
liver-related harms, direct evaluation of ethnicity in populations would
be more reliable (Bhopal, 2013). However, linked data to reliably com-
pare risks of hospitalisation and mortality by ethnic group directly
have not been available to date in most countries around the world.
In Scotland, a novel advance in this field has been the develop-
ment of a project linking anonymised Census records with NHS
data sets in the Scottish Health Ethnicity Linkage Study (SHELS)
(Bhopal et al., 2011). An additional strength is the inclusion of hos-
pitalisation data, which substantially increases the number of out-
comes and, hence, power to detect differences. Therefore, for the
first time, we report ethnic differences in the hospitalisations and
mortality of liver- and alcohol-related diseases (ARD) using a reli-
able measure of ethnicity in Scotland.
METHODS
Aim and hypotheses
Our analysis aimed to establish basic patterns of ethnic differences in
the hospitalisation and mortality of alcohol-related and liver diseases
in Scotland. Our hypothesis was that there were ethnic variations of
≥10% in pairwise comparison of each ethnic minority group to the
White Scottish population in men and women separately. We further
hypothesised that these variations would not be wholly explained by
available data on socio-economic factors, and in the associations in
those born in the UK and those born abroad (COB).
The underlying cause of death or hospital admission was coded
using the ICD-10. Data for all liver diseases (K70–K74) and alco-
holic liver disease (ALD) (K70) were analysed separately (NHS
National Services Scotland, 2009a, 2009b). Data from ARD (wholly
attributable to alcohol) were defined as those coded to E24.4, F10,
G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K70, K86.0, P04.3, O35.4,
Q86.0, R78.0, T51.0. T51.9, X45, X65, Y15, Y90 and Y91, shown
in Supplementary Table A1 (Bhala et al., 2009, 2010). The range
of conditions included in ‘ARD’ includes those that are wholly
alcohol-attributable such as alcohol-related liver diseases, and chronic
pancreatitis, poisoning, mental and behavioural disorders, nervous
system, cardiomyopathy and gastritis due to alcohol.
Population data
Further details on the Scottish Health Ethnicity Linkage Study
(SHELS) design, methodology and logistics have been published in
open access publications (Bhopal et al., 2011). This article focuses
on the matters particular to the analysis of ARD and liver-related
diseases, particularly of hospital admissions and mortality data
among Scottish residents. Data on hospitalisations/deaths among
Scottish residents were obtained from the National Health Service
Information Service Division from 2000 to 2010 inclusive by age,
sex and cause of hospitalisations/death by linking NHS hospital
admissions and mortality to the Scottish Census 2001 that was used
to collect data on ethnicity and COB.
We used computerised matching of names, addresses and dates of
birth to link the Census 2001 for Scotland, with the Scottish
Community Health Index (CHI), which is a register of patients using
NHS Scotland. Denominators were from this linked Census 2001 data
set (Bhopal et al., 2012; Fischbacher et al., 2014). The census provided
ethnic group as reported by either the individual or the householder
based on a question offering 14 categories; and other demographic
data, including COB and socio-economic variables. We examined eight
socio-economic indicators following a systematic approach: the
Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) was available for all
census participants (unlike other measures not collected for younger
and older age groups) and associated consistently with the outcome
across ethnic group, so was selected to adjust for in our analysis as a
proxy for socio-economic status (Fischbacher et al., 2014).
Ethnic group is a legally required Census field that was well com-
pleted (95.7%) and, after imputation (4.3%), available for 100% of
those completing the census form. We minimised ethnic group
aggregation given heterogeneity in other outcomes between popula-
tions that are commonly aggregated as South Asians, for example,
Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis (Bhopal et al., 1999). This
means data cannot be reported for Any Other Ethnic Group because
of small numbers and hence risk of disclosure of identity. We made
an exception by creating an Other South Asian group that included
Bangladeshis, and by combining Black, African and Caribbean
populations into an African Origin group.
Statistical methods
Due to the limited number of deaths to be analysed separately, we
analysed the incidence of a first event of either death in the commu-
nity or hospitalisation. To minimise the numbers of age/sex cells
with no case, which creates statistical instability, we restricted analy-
sis to those ≥20 years. Person-years (PY) at risk were calculated
using the linked population from May 1, 2001 to April 30, 2010,
that is, 9 years. The PY calculation for each person was adjusted
by censoring follow-up at date-of-death, date-of-diagnosis and date
of leaving NHS Scotland, if these occurred before April 2010.

 Age-adjusted rates were derived from Poisson regression RRs adjusted
for age and the White Scottish crude rates per 100,000 PY. The White
Scottish population was the standard reference population (relative
risks were multiplied by 100 for presentation). Of note, 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) were calculated to enable comparison: those
excluding 100 are highlighted in the results below. Data were ana-
lysed using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
We constructed Poisson regression models with robust variance
adjusted for age only and then included SIMD and COB in the
adjusted models. Our presumption was that being born in Scotland
would be associated with greater convergence in disease risk in each
ethnic group than in those born abroad. If so, the COB-adjusted
risks would be closer to reference than those not so adjusted. The
numbers of outcomes were not sufficient to support stratified analy-
sis or to reliably assess statistical interaction, so this part of the ana-
lysis is descriptive and considered as hypothesis generating.
Ethics
The work was approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics
Committee for Scotland and the Privacy Advisory Committee of
NHS National Services Scotland. The ethical and other permissions
and related issues have been reported in detail, including an
independent assessment by an ethicist (Boyd, 2007; Fischbacher
et al., 2007; Bhopal et al., 2011). To comply with the Data
Protection Act and safe-setting rules, the data set only contained gas-
trointestinal outcomes. The analysis was conducted on a standalone
computer in a locked room in the National Records Scotland
(NRS), by named researchers (see contributors), following a strict
disclosure protocol. Outputs leaving the safe setting (including this
article) were screened by the NRS disclosure committee.
RESULTS
Supplementary Table A2 shows the characteristics of the census-
linked population that our analyses were based on. The proportions
of deaths for all liver diseases were 1%, for ALD were 11% and for
ARD were 4%. Due to the limited number of deaths alone, hospita-
lisations and mortality first event results were analysed together.
The total numbers of first events within the 9-year period of interest
(over almost 30 million of PY at risk) were 51,908 for all liver dis-
eases, 15,213 for ALD and 72,857 for ARD, respectively. The age-
adjusted results relative risks for (a) all liver diseases, (b) ALD and
(c) ARD are presented in Fig. 1(A–C), respectively, and discussed in
detail below.

 All liver diseases
Table 1 shows that for all liver diseases, in every ethnic group, the
age-adjusted rate of disease was similar in men than in women. In
men, age-adjusted relative risks were higher by ~40% for Chinese
(144; 117–175) and Other South Asian (139; 119–163) ethnicity.
These relative risks were modified slightly by adjustment for COB
and SIMD: Chinese (162; 127–207) and Other South Asian (144;
104–201) men. While the age-adjusted RR for all liver diseases were
initially higher in Any Mixed Background men, this excess was atte-
nuated by adjustment for COB and SIMD to include the reference
group value (136; 95–194).
In men, age-adjusted risks for all liver diseases were lower by
~30% in Other White British (RR 72; 62–83) ethnicity, with no
attenuation when adjusted for COB and SIMD. For all other male
groups, the 95% CIs included the reference group value.
In women, the age-adjusted risks for all liver diseases were high-
er by approximately a third in Chinese (133; 107–165) and
Pakistani (140; 112–176) ethnicities. These risks were amplified
slightly by adjustment for COB and SIMD for Chinese women
(141; 109–184) but were not altered for Pakistani women (140;
116–168).
In women, age-adjusted risks for all liver diseases were lower by
approximately a quarter in Other White British (77; 69–86) and
Other White ethnicities (76; 64–90). These risks were attenuated
slightly by adjustment for COB and SIMD: Other White British (80;
70–90) and Other White ethnicities (80; 67–94). For all other female
groups, the 95% CIs included the reference group value.
Supplementary Table A3 shows the data for all liver diseases,
excluding ALD. In men, age-adjusted relative risks were higher by
~50% for Chinese (159; 130–196) and Other South Asian (136;
101–181) ethnicities. These relative risks were amplified slightly by
adjustment for COB and SIMD for Chinese (178; 140–228) but not
for Other South Asian (141; 97–204).
In men, age-adjusted risks were lower by ~60% for those of
African origin (41; 28–59) and were lower by a quarter in Other
White British (74; 65–85) ethnicity. These were modified slightly by
adjustment for COB and SIMD: African origin (39; 22–70) and
Other White British (73; 64–84). For all other male groups, the
95% CIs included the reference group value.
In women, the age-adjusted risks for all liver diseases (excluding
ALD) were higher by ~50% in Chinese (141; 114–174) and
Pakistani (150; 121–185) ethnicities. These were modified slightly
by adjustment for COB and SIMD: Chinese (149; 114–193) and
Pakistani (148; 123–179).
In women, age-adjusted risks for all liver diseases (excluding
ALD) were lower by ~20% in Other White British (78; 69–87) and
Other White ethnicities (75; 64–87). These were modified slightly by
adjustment for COB and SIMD: Other White British (80; 71–92)
and Other White ethnicities (78; 66–92). For all other female
groups, the 95% CIs included the reference group value.
Alcoholic liver disease
Table 2 shows that for ALD, in every ethnic group, the age-adjusted
rate of disease was much higher in men than in women. Age-adjusted
relative risks for Indian men initially crossed the reference value (131;
79–215) but were higher by ~75% when adjusted for COB and
SIMD (175; 107–287). Conversely, while the age-adjusted relative
risks were initially higher in White Irish men (165; 131–209), this

 excess was attenuated by adjustment for COB and SIMD (121;
94–156).
In men, age-adjusted risks for ALD were lower by approximately
a third in Other White British (RR 61; 50–75) and Pakistani (62;
42–90) ethnicities. These relative risks were similar after adjustment
for COB and SIMD: Other White British (63; 50–78) and Pakistani
(65; 42–99). For all other male and female groups, the 95% CIs
included the reference group value.
Alcohol-related diseases
Table 3 shows that for ARD, in every ethnic group, the age-adjusted
rate of disease was much higher in men than in women. In men, the
age-adjusted relative risks were approximately doubled in the White
Irish (225; 196–258), and the excess remained, even slightly attenuated
by adjustment for COB and SIMD (182; 161–206). Age-adjusted rela-
tive risks were higher by ~50% for men of Any Mixed Background
(158; 115–219), also attenuated slightly by adjustment for COB and
SIMD (142; 108–185). For men of Indian ethnicity, the age-adjusted
relative risks did not differ (111; 99–124), but the adjusted risks for
COB and SIMD were around a third higher (137; 109–171).
In men, age-adjusted relative risks for ARD were lower by
approximately a third to a half of Chinese (RR 47; 38–59) and
Pakistani (65; 47–89). These relative risks were modified slightly by
adjustment for COB and SIMD: Chinese (55; 41–73) and Pakistani
(66; 55–78). For all other male groups, the 95% CIs included the
reference value.
In women, the age-adjusted relative risks for ARD were approxi-
mately doubled in the White Irish (182; 148–224) and in Any
Mixed Background (219; 153–312). The excess remained, though
attenuated by adjustment for COB and SIMD (White Irish 155;
127–188 and Any Mixed Background 199; 152–261). Age-adjusted
relative risks were also higher by approximately a quarter of Other
White British women (126; 107–148), with little attenuation when
adjusted for COB and SIMD (128; 109–151).
In women, age-adjusted risks for ARD were lower by approxi-
mately a half of Chinese (RR 46; 23–95) and Pakistani (49; 30–78),
only modified slightly by adjustment for COB and SIMD: Chinese
(RR 54; 32–90) and Pakistani (48; 33–70). For all other female
groups, the 95% CIs included the reference value.
DISCUSSION
This new larger scale population study demonstrates that there are
different patterns for risks of common ALD and non-ALD for ethnic
groups in Scotland, which has important policy implications. Irish
men and women were shown to have around a 2-fold increased risk
of alcohol-related harms and a 50% increased risk of ALD (previous
studies were unable to detect mortality differences compared to the
reference White Scottish population) (Bhala et al., 2010). This is
also the first study to report increased risks in mixed ethnicity
groups for alcohol-related hospitalisations (2-fold in women and
50% in men), along with a slight increase in Other British women,
compared to the White Scottish population.
There are important lessons for prevention, as some groups (e.g.
Chinese men, Pakistani men and women with likely lower alcohol
consumption) had substantially lower alcohol-related events (in the
order of 33–50% lower risk compared to the reference White
Scottish population). While the Other British population in Scotland
had a slight decreased risk for alcohol-related events overall,
there was a correspondingly substantial lower risk (in the order

 of 33–50%) for ALD events. However, when considering all liver
disease hospitalisations, Pakistani and Chinese populations in Scotland
had around a 50% increased risk: an important area of future research
is ascertaining if this is due to increased rates of chronic viral hepati-
tis in these ethnic minority groups.
Limitations and strengths of the study
The general strengths and weaknesses of SHELS have been consid-
ered in detail in several prior publications (Bansal et al., 2013,
2014). In brief, the strengths include a population-based cohort (ret-
rospective) analysis of a linked data set avoiding numerator-
denominator bias; a valid indicator of ethnic group as well as COB;
and access to a range of potentially confounding socio-economic
factors; the overall size (4.65 million people), the availability of an
ethnic code completed by the householder on behalf of the house-
hold or by individuals; information on a wide range of ethnic groups
and the linkage of census data to both hospital morbidity and com-
munity/hospital mortality along with socio-economic indicators. All
deaths are certified by a doctor in Scotland and all public hospitals
are required to submit data (with a small private hospital sector)
(Bansal et al., 2014).
Weaknesses
include
incomplete
linkage
(although
this
was
achieved in 95% of the participants overall); the use of routinely col-
lected data and unavailability of potential risk factors other than
those in the census. Data on aetiology of the underlying liver disease
(e.g. chronic viral hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV), body mass
index and amount of alcohol drunk) were not readily available to
help interpret the effects of different types of liver disease, which need
to be considered in generalising these results. Other limitations of hos-
pitalisation and mortality recording by ethnicity analyses include
errors in population estimates (e.g. comparing the Census reference
population of 2001 to later age-standardised years collected), return
migration (so-called salmon bias, where people move on diagnosis),
misclassification of ethnicity and inaccurate reporting of the cause of
disease or death (Fischbacher et al., 2007). Mild attenuation with
adjustment for COB and socio-economic status demonstrates that
confounding by these variables is unlikely to explain all of the differ-
ences identified, although residual confounding is inevitable. There
was inadequate power to detect differences between first hospitalisa-
tion and mortality outcomes due to the limited number of mortality
events, albeit up to 11% of ALD events were fatal.
In the context of this analysis, the greatest strength of SHELS
is providing new knowledge on ethnic variations on a less

 commonly studied set of fatal and non-fatal outcomes. It has
shown that White groups should not be routinely amalgamated
and confirmed that there are important differences within, for
example, Asian, subgroups. The mixed ethnic group population is
the fastest growing UK’s minority ethnic groups, yet data are
rarely published on this group, which have a pattern of disease
that is not the same as the White Scottish population. The census
forms in Scotland did not include subgroups, but rather single
categories of ‘Any Mixed Background’: however, from England
and Wales data, 3.5% of all births in 2005 were mixed race babies
(of which 40% were Mixed White and Black Caribbean or Black
African, 24% Mixed White and Asian and the remainder any
other Mixed background).
Even over a 9-year period, the number of outcomes for ethnic
groups, except for Other White British, is small, with correspond-
ingly wide CI. While we need to be guarded in our interpretation of
rates for people from ethnicities with relatively few events, this may
also mean that there may be differences that we did not observe
(Type 2 error). For example, data are lacking for more recent
migrants, such as Eastern Europeans (e.g. from Poland, where
alcohol-related harms accounts for a high proportion of premature
mortality—Rehm et al., 2007). However, even with small absolute
numbers, these novel and more reliable findings have generated
hypotheses that require replication in other large populations, ide-
ally with longer follow-up. Ethnic variation of other digestive dis-
eases in SHELS, for example, common lower gastrointestinal
diseases (Bhopal et al., 2014) will also help guide clinical practice
and research internationally.
Findings in relation to the literature: alcohol
Alcohol-related conditions comprise a mixture of conditions, of
which one of the most serious and common being ALD. Routine
mortality statistics demonstrated a stark increase in liver cirrhosis
mortality in Scotland compared with that in the rest of Europe,
including England and Wales (Leon and McCambridge, 2006).
Alcohol is the principal cause of liver disease in the UK, and around
two-thirds of deaths from unspecified liver disease are also attributa-
ble to it (Fisher et al., 2002; Bhala et al., 2009). Other liver aetiolo-
gies such as chronic viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) may also contribute, separately or synergistically
(Corrao et al., 1998; Hart et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010).
The observation that those of Irish COB are high-risk drinkers
and experience increased alcohol-related hospitalisations compared
to non-Irish men was made in UK studies almost 30 years ago
(Taylor et al., 1986; Harrison et al., 1993). More recently, a com-
bined analysis of Scottish health surveys by inequalities indicators
suggested increases in consumption and alcohol-related harms in
Irish men and women (Scottish Health Survey Equality Groups
Report, 2012). Our data suggest that those of Irish ethnicity have
persistently higher rates of alcohol and associated liver disease
harms that require concerted action.
Although increased alcohol consumption may occur with
acculturation (Pannu et al., 2009), the record-linked data we pre-
sent are in accord with other observational studies of alcohol con-
sumption (Rehm et al., 2007; Bhala et al., 2010). There are
suggestions that COB and socio-economic factors (SIMD) modify
different ethnic groups in different ways, but there are not enough
outcomes to do stratified analysis each ethnic group by COB by
sex and then also by COB and SIMD. Other recent studies of eth-
nic density, the geographical concentration of ethnic minorities in
an area, confirmed a protective effect for current alcohol consump-
tion in overall mortality, Indian and Chinese communities in
England (Bécares et al., 2011). However, worrying trends of
increased alcohol-related mortality in younger groups are also
emerging, such as increasing risks for young women in deprived
cities such as Glasgow (Shipton et al., 2013). However, these pat-
terns are dynamic at local and global scales: India and China are
experiencing increasing per capita consumption of alcohol (Rehm
et al., 2007), therefore the prevention of alcohol-related harms is
also very important for these huge communities. In Scotland,
alcohol-related harms are a huge public health issue (Bhala et al.,
2010) estimated to be responsible for almost 4000 deaths per year
in a population of around 5 million.
Findings in relation to the literature: Other liver diseases
The importance of considering different aetiologies of liver diseases
is also highlighted in these analyses: in particular, HBV and HCV
are relevant to the higher risks in non-White ethnic groups such as
the Chinese and Pakistani communities in Scotland. The data also
concur with UK serological community-based studies that have
shown heterogeneity in hepatitis B prevalence in South Asian
populations (highest in Pakistani and lowest in Indian ethnicities)
(Uddin et al., 2010). Vaccines are an important preventative inter-
vention for hepatitis B and many countries adopt population-wide
measures: in the UK (which does not use such vaccines), case-
finding in ethnic minorities with a higher absolute risk is already
conducted. For hepatitis C virus (for which there is no vaccine cur-
rently), the overall prevalence remains low in the UK. However,
case-finding
in
higher
prevalence
groups,
such
as
Pakistani
migrants, may be appropriate to detect those eligible for new treat-
ments to prevent liver complications (Harris et al., 2012).
Other aetiologies also bear consideration: in particular, the
increasing burden of NAFLD, closely associated with the metabolic
syndrome and increased rates of obesity, also differs substantially by
ethnicity. More detailed understanding of the contribution of differ-
ent aetiologies of liver disease by ethnicity, especially alcohol,
NAFLD and viral hepatitis, is required, which may reveal new
hypotheses in the role of genes and environment (e.g. diet). This will
need substantial linked data sets comprising large populations with
reliable measures of ethnicity and relevant disease outcomes (e.g.
hospitalisations and mortality): for example, the next SHELS ana-
lyses plan to analyse updated chronic viral hepatitis data in 2016.
CONCLUSIONS
For alcohol-related harms, the observed excess in White Irish
rates compared with the White Scottish population, which was
in turn increased compared to those from other parts of the
world, is a cause for concern. Conversely, there are persisting
patterns of cultural change in alcohol-related hazards to be
learnt from ethnic groups in Scotland with low alcohol con-
sumption
(e.g.
Chinese
and
some
South
Asian
ethnicities).
However, these same groups also need close attention for detec-
tion and treatment of other liver diseases, driven particularly by
the higher absolute risks of chronic viral hepatitis: vaccination
efforts could be amplified by a case-finding approach for screening
higher risk populations (e.g. Chinese and Pakistani ethnicities).
This underlines the importance of population-based research into
ethnicity and cause-specific liver disease to help guide clinical and
public health decision-making.

 Evidence-based population-based measures, which can benefit
the entire population, particularly minimum alcohol pricing and
taxation, are the most effective interventions to prevent alcohol-
related harms at a Scotland-wide population level (Anderson et al.,
2009; Seaman et al., 2013). Partly due to the high absolute burden
of disease and unmet needs, Scotland has been progressive in consid-
ering legislation to help tackle alcohol-related harms (Scottish
Government Alcohol Policy, 2010; McCambridge et al., 2013);
however, the ethnic dimension in this complicated, but preventable,
issue needs consideration throughout the UK (Williams et al., 2014;
NHS Health Scotland 2016).
