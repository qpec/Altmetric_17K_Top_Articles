Background. We investigated the effect of influenza vaccination on disease severity in adults hospitalized with laboratory-con-
firmed influenza during 2013−14, a season in which vaccine viruses were antigenically similar to those circulating.
Methods. We analyzed data from the 2013−14 influenza season and used propensity score matching to account for the proba-
bility of vaccination within age strata (18−49, 50−64, and ≥65 years). Death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and hospital and 
ICU lengths of stay (LOS) were outcome measures for severity. Multivariable logistic regression and competing risk models were 
used to compare disease severity between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, adjusting for timing of antiviral treatment and time 
from illness onset to hospitalization.
Results. Influenza vaccination was associated with a reduction in the odds of in-hospital death among patients aged 18−49 years 
(adjusted odds ratios [aOR] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 to 0.97), 50–64 years (aOR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.97), and 
≥65 years (aOR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.66). Vaccination also reduced ICU admission among patients aged 18−49 years (aOR = 0.63; 
95% CI, 0.42 to 0.93) and ≥65 years (aOR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.81), and shortened ICU LOS among those 50−64 years (adjusted 
relative hazards [aRH] = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.74) and ≥65 years (aRH = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.73), and hospital LOS among 
50−64 years (aRH = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.26) and ≥65 years (aRH = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.37).
Conclusions. Influenza vaccination during 2013−14 influenza season attenuated adverse outcome among adults that were hos-
pitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza.

Influenza vaccination is the best strategy for preventing influ-
enza [1]. Nonetheless, influenza vaccination coverage in the 
United States is suboptimal, especially among adults 18 to 
49 years of age, with vaccination levels as low as ~33% [2]. 
Reasons for low coverage may include underappreciation of dis-
ease severity and skepticism among the public about how well 
the vaccine works [3].
Although prevention of influenza virus infection is the desira-
ble outcome after influenza vaccination, people may still become 
infected with influenza despite being vaccinated [4]. However, 
some studies have suggested that influenza vaccination could 
modify the severity of illness among vaccinated patients who 
subsequently develop influenza virus infection [5–8]. Evidence 
for vaccine modification of influenza-associated disease sever-
ity could be an important argument toward improving influenza 
vaccination coverage in various groups of the population.
Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies from season to 
season, depending on host characteristics (such as age and 
presence of comorbidities) and how well circulating influenza 
viruses match the viruses contained in the vaccine [9–12]. 
During the 2013−14 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09 virus predominated, the first time in the United States 
since this virus emerged in 2009 [13]. During that season, 
influenza viruses that circulated were antigenically similar to 
viruses included in the vaccine, and the influenza VE estimate 
against medically attended acute respiratory illness for ages 
≥6 months was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44, 59) [9, 
14], which allowed us to investigate the impact of influenza vac-
cination on disease severity. Therefore, we analyzed data from 
adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during 
the 2013−14 influenza season in the United States, to assess 
whether influenza vaccination provided protection against

METHODS
Study Population and Design
We analyzed population-based data from the US Influenza 
Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) that 
includes over 240 reporting hospitals, with a catchment area 
representing approximately 9% of the US population. Adult (age 
≥18 years) residents of the surveillance area were considered 
cases if they were admitted to one of the participating hospitals 
from October 1, 2013, through April 30, 2014, and had a labo-
ratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza no more than 14 days 
before admission. Influenza testing and the type of influenza 
testing used (i.e., reverse transcription–polymerase chain reac-
tion, viral culture, fluorescent antibody staining, or rapid antigen 
test) was determined by the provider. Medical chart review using 
a standardized form captured information on demographic 
characteristics and clinical outcomes during hospitalization [15].
Vaccination status was ascertained from medical charts and 
vaccine registries by contacting the patient’s primary care pro-
vider or by interviewing the patient or proxies directly. A com-
plete or partial vaccination date had to be provided in order for 
the patient to be considered vaccinated. If these criteria were 
not met, at least one vaccination source had to indicate that the 
patient did not receive seasonal influenza vaccination [on or after 
July 1, 2013] to be considered unvaccinated for that season; oth-
erwise vaccination status of the patient was considered unknown.
We excluded cases with unknown vaccination status and cases 
who had fewer than 14 days between vaccination and hospital-
ization (time required to develop vaccine-induced protection). 
We also excluded those living in long-term care facilities because 
of substantial differences in baseline characteristics (e.g., vacci-
nation coverage, frailty, and immunosenescence) as compared to 
adults living in the community [16]. Over 80% of the captured 
FluSurv-NET patients received antiviral medication (oseltam-
ivir). We did not have information on why physicians treated 
some patients and not others; moreover, there were significant 
differences between patients who received antivirals and patients 
who did not (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to exclude 
patients who did not receive antivirals, those with an unclear 
history of antiviral treatment, and those who started antiviral 
treatment ≥4 days before hospitalization (because we could 
not ascertain whether treatment was completed). The group of 
patients who were not treated with antiviral was small to be ana-
lyzed separately. Also, we excluded pregnant women and those 
without body mass index (BMI) data.
Severity Outcomes
We evaluated intensive care unit (ICU) admission, in-hospital 
death (including hospice transfer), diagnosis of pneumonia, and 
ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) as measures of disease 
severity (study outcomes). Pneumonia was defined by presence 
of bronchopneumonia/pneumonia, air space density/opacity, 
pleural effusion/empyema, consolidation and/or lobar (not inter-
stitial) infiltrate on chest radiography within the first 3 days of 
hospital admission, and a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia. For 
the analysis of the impact of influenza vaccination on pneumonia, 
our denominator included only those who had chest radiography 
taken within the first 3 days of hospital admission. All analyses 
were performed by age stratum (18–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years) 
because vaccine response and coverage varies by age [4, 17–19].
Statistical Analysis
We described epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of 
patient-population by vaccination status, using Pearson X2 test, 
Fisher exact test, or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
For each age group mentioned above, we performed propen-
sity score matching (PSM) to balance the differences between 
vaccinated and unvaccinated groups based on their probabil-
ity of being vaccinated [20], given differences in demographic 
characteristics (sex, age, and race/ethnicity, and state of resi-
dence), BMI, chronic underlying conditions (asthma, chronic 
lung disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic metabolic disease, 
neurologic disease, immunosuppression, blood disorder, renal 
disease, and liver disease), and lifestyle risk factors (alcohol 
abuse and smoking). For PSM, we used the nearest neighbor 
matching approach, which requires a 1:2 vaccinated-to-unvac-
cinated ratio for best model fit [21, 22]. For adults ≥65 years, 
because we had a similar number of vaccinated and unvacci-
nated patients, we randomly sampled approximately 1/2 of 
vaccinated patients to meet the 1:2 matching requirement. 
We repeated the random sample selection a thousand times to 
obtain an averaged point estimate for each outcome and lower 
and upper 95% CI [23]. After PSM, no significant differences 
remained for each of these variables by vaccination status.
Finally, for each age group, we evaluated the association of 
influenza vaccination with ICU admission, death, and pneu-
monia using multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models, 
adjusting odds ratios (aOR) for timing of antiviral treatment 
(calculated from day of symptom onset and categorized as 
≤2 days, 3−5 days, and >5 days), and day to hospital admission 
(calculated from symptom onset and categorized as ≤2 days 
and >2 days). Similarly, we used competing risk (CR) models 
to evaluate the association of influenza vaccination and ICU 
and hospital LOS (in days), adjusting relative hazards (aRH) for 
timing of antiviral treatment and time to hospital admission, 
and accounted for in-hospital death as a CR. All analyses were 
performed using R software (version 3.2.2).

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics (Before Propensity Score Matching)
Of the 8354 hospitalized adult cases that were identified in 
the 2013−14 season, 3444 (41%) were excluded, leaving 4910 
cases for analysis (Figure 1). There were 1551 cases aged 
18–49 years (31.6%), 1771 were 50–64 years (36.1%), and 1588 
were ≥65 years (32.3%); age group-specific influenza vaccina-
tion coverage was 19%, 33%, and 54%, respectively. Vaccinated 
cases were more likely to have chronic medical conditions than 
unvaccinated cases, except among those aged ≥65 years, in 
whom fewer differences in the prevalence of medical conditions 
were observed. Influenza vaccination was inversely associated

with smoking among adults ≥50 and with alcohol abuse in those 
50−64 years of age. In addition, among adults aged 18–64 years, 
influenza vaccination was associated with earlier antiviral treat-
ment and with receiving hospital care within 2 days of symptom 
onset (P < .02; Table 1).
Within each age group, the proportion of in-hospital deaths 
among the unvaccinated was higher than among the vaccinated 
(P < .04). Among those aged 18–49 and ≥65 years, a higher 
proportion of unvaccinated cases were admitted to the ICU 
as compared to the vaccinated group (P ≤ .01). For those aged 
18–49 years, diagnosis of pneumonia was more likely among 
the unvaccinated (P = .01). For those 50–64 years, the median 
of ICU LOS was higher among the unvaccinated as compared to 
the vaccinated (P = .03).
Propensity Score Matching and Evaluation of Influenza Vaccination and 
Severe Disease Outcomes
After performing PSM on the probability of being vaccinated, 
we obtained matched samples of 600, 1186, and 732 cases among 
18–49, 50–64, and ≥65 year age groups, respectively. We found 
no differences in proportions for any of the variables used for 
PSM by vaccination status (data not shown). For those aged 
18–49 years, we found a protective effect of influenza vaccine 
against ICU admission (aOR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.93) and 
in-hospital death (aOR = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.97). For those 
aged 50–64 years, we found a protective effect of the vaccine 
against in-hospital death (aOR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.97), 
shorter ICU LOS (aHR for ICU discharge = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06 
to 1.74), and shorter hospital LOS (aHR for discharge = 1.13; 
95% CI, 1.02 to 1.26). For those aged ≥65 years, we found a pro-
tective effect of the vaccine against ICU admission (aOR = 0.63; 
95% CI, 0.48 to 0.81), in-hospital death (aOR = 0.39; 95% CI, 
0.17 to 0.66), shorter ICU LOS (aRH = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06 to 
1.73), and shorter hospital LOS (aRH = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13 to 
1.37). We did not observe statistical differences for the associ-
ation between influenza vaccination and pneumonia (Table 2). 
Figure 2 shows 95% CIs for the risk parameters evaluating the 
effect of influenza vaccination on influenza disease severity by 
1000 random sample simulations for age group ≥65, after PSM 
and after adjusting for timing of antiviral treatment and time 
to hospital admission, and accounting for death in the survival 
models. In the graphs, the red lines represent 95% CI with a 
statistically significant value; the black lines represent 95% CI 
that did not achieve statistical significance. The 4 graphs show 
a trend of 95% CI toward rejecting the null hypothesis, which is 
consistent with results in Table 2. Figure 3 shows the cumulative 
incidence function for time to ICU discharge and hospital dis-
charge for the 3 age groups, respectively. Overall, the probability 
of earlier discharge from the ICU or hospital, after accounting 
for in-hospital death, was higher for those vaccinated versus 
those unvaccinated at different points in time; this is also con-
sistent with results in Table 2.
DISCUSSION
We showed a significant protective effect of 2013−14 sea-
sonal influenza vaccination against disease severity outcomes 
among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed influ-
enza. Overall, vaccinated adults had a 52−79% reduction in in- 
hospital death and a 37% reduction in ICU admission (among 
those aged 18−49 and ≥65 years) compared to those unvacci-
nated. In addition, the probability of being discharged earlier 
from the ICU and from the hospital was 34−36% and 13−24% 
higher among vaccinated cases aged ≥50 years compared to 
unvaccinated cases. Our data suggest that although influenza 
vaccination may have failed to prevent influenza virus infec-
tion among some of those vaccinated for the 2013−14 season, it 
may have still protected those same people against more severe 
influenza-associated outcomes. Our findings underscore the 
importance of annual influenza vaccination for adults, particu-
larly among those aged 18−49 years (historically the group with 
the lowest influenza vaccination coverage in the US) [2], and 
among those ≥65 years (accounting for 71−85% of estimated 
annual influenza-associated deaths in the US) [24].
We had previously assessed the effect of influenza vaccination 
on disease severity among adults aged 50 years and older during 
the 2012−13 season using a similar analytical approach [5]. In 
that study, we did not find a substantial effect of vaccination on 
clinical outcomes (we only found a modest effect of vaccination 
on ICU LOS in the 50−64 year olds). Influenza season 2012−13 
was primarily an H3N2 season with nonsignificant VE reported 
for older age groups [10, 25]. Influenza VE against medically 
attended cases due to influenza A in outpatients ≥65 years was 
11% [95% CI −41 to 43] for the 2012–13 season, whereas the VE 
for the same age group during 2013−14 season was 51% (95% 
CI 12, 73) [10, 14]. Thus, the benefit of influenza vaccination on 
attenuating influenza-associated disease severity may be influ-
enced by robustness of VE, especially among older adults.
Our analysis was limited to patients hospitalized with lab-
oratory-confirmed influenza and those treated with antivi-
rals; we do not know if our findings could be generalizable to 
non-hospitalized populations or whether the effects we found 
could be even more robust in a population without access to 
antiviral treatment. Evidence to support the benefit of antiviral 
treatment in reducing influenza disease severity suggests that 
best results are seen if treatment initiated early (first 4 days after 
illness onset) [26–28] for which we account in our adjustment 
analysis. One of the explanations for not seeing a significant 
association between influenza vaccination and shorter ICU 
and hospital LOS among those aged 18−49 years may be the 
small sample size. Despite representing about one third of hos-
pitalizations during the 2013−14 season, a smaller percentage 
of cases within this age group were vaccinated. Interestingly, in 
this age group, we observed that influenza vaccination was asso-
ciated with a lower prevalence of pneumonia compared to the

association was no longer significant. Sample size could again 
explain that as the number of patients to assess pneumonia as 
an outcome was reduced to those with chest x-rays done within

 Modifying Influenza Severity • CID 2017:65 (15 October) • 1295
Similar to our findings, one large multicenter case-control 
study in Spain [6] found a reduction of over 50% in the risk of 
severe influenza-related outcomes among those ≥65 years old 
who were vaccinated against influenza. In addition, 2 smaller 
studies assessed 2013−14 influenza vaccination in adults and its 
effects on disease severity. One of them [31] reported no effect 
of influenza vaccination on in-hospital mortality or respira-
tory failure among older adults hospitalized with influenza. In 
contrast, the other study reported lower influenza vaccination 
rates among those who presented with more severe respiratory 
illness, including need for ICU admission and positive pressure 
ventilation [32]. These studies, unlike ours, were neither pow-
ered to control for confounders nor assessed the propensity for 
vaccination in their study population. Our findings suggest that, 
in addition to a VE against medically attended laboratory-con-
firmed influenza of about 50% in season 2013−14, influenza 
vaccination seemed to attenuate influenza-associated severe 
outcomes, including reduction in ICU admission and death.

Additional findings that support the benefit of influenza vac-
cination in attenuating influenza disease severity come from VE 
studies. Deiss et al [33], based on symptoms at disease presenta-
tion, described a milder disease among vaccinated individuals 
infected with H3N2 viruses compared to unvaccinated individ-
uals during the 2009−2014 seasons. Others have estimated VE 
for mild and severe cases separately, finding higher protection 
against severe cases that would suggest that influenza vaccine 
could attenuate illness [34, 35]. This implies that our study 
outcomes may not represent the full spectrum of the effect of 
influenza vaccination on disease attenuation. Therefore, studies 
assessing the benefit of annual influenza vaccination in terms of 
cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths averted without including 
the potential for disease severity modification may be underes-
timating the total benefits of influenza vaccination [1, 12].
Observational studies of this kind demand robust methods to 
ensure that biases in the data are limited (e.g., vaccine is more 
commonly administered to patients with comorbidities and 
older adults). To minimize the impact of confounding by indi-
cation and healthy vaccinee bias, we used PSM to balance the 
comparison groups accounting for the probability of vaccination 
and used CR models to account for death during hospitalization 
that could affect our ability to assess LOS as a reliable measure of 
severity [36–38]. Nonetheless, our study has limitations. There 
might be unmeasured or incompletely measured confounders 
that we could not account for in PSM. We were reassured by the 
fact that we were able to include an extensive list of variables 
reported to be associated with vaccination in our PSM, achieving 
well-balanced comparison groups [26], and adjusting for other 
variables associated with the outcomes of interest in the final 
models. Nonetheless, the benefit of vaccination may have been 
underestimated because we only included in-hospital deaths. 
Future studies could evaluate the impact of influenza vaccina-
tion accounting for deaths occurring after hospital discharge 
[37]. We excluded 8% of participants due to unknown vacci-
nation status that could inadvertently introduce bias; however, 
the number was not large, and when we compared the excluded 
group’s characteristics related to vaccination, severity, and time 
from disease onset to hospitalization, we did not find any sub-
stantial differences (Supplementary Table A1). We performed 
our analyses among hospitalized patients treated with antivirals, 
excluding untreated patients (less than 20% of FluSurv-NET 
patients) [16], and this could also have underestimated the effect 
of vaccination on influenza-associated severe outcomes as anti-
viral treatment can attenuate disease severity [39].
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that despite vacci-
nated individuals became infected with influenza viruses, vacci-
nation can reduce disease severity. Our study focused on adults 
hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza in 2013−14, a 
year in which the vaccine virus components matched the circu-
lating viruses. This additional benefit of influenza vaccination 
on disease severity may be observed in future seasons when 
vaccine is shown to provide significant protection, especially 
among people aged ≥65 years.
