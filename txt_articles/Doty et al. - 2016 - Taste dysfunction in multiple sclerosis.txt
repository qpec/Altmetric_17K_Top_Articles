Abstract
Empirical studies of taste function in multiple
sclerosis (MS) are rare. Moreover, a detailed assessment of
whether quantitative measures of taste function correlate
with the punctate and patchy myelin-related lesions found
throughout the CNS of MS patients has not been made. We
administered a 96-trial test of sweet (sucrose), sour (citric
acid), bitter (caffeine) and salty (NaCl) taste perception to
the left and right anterior (CN VII) and posterior (CN IX)
tongue regions of 73 MS patients and 73 matched controls.
The number and volume of lesions were assessed using
quantitative MRI in 52 brain regions of 63 of the MS
patients. Taste identification scores were significantly
lower in the MS patients for sucrose (p = 0.0002), citric
acid
(p = 0.0001),
caffeine
(p = 0.0372)
and
NaCl
(p = 0.0004) and were present in both anterior and pos-
terior tongue regions. The percent of MS patients with
identification scores falling below the 5th percentile of
controls was 15.07 % for caffeine, 21.9 % for citric acid,
24.66 % for sucrose, and 31.50 % for NaCl. Such scores
were inversely correlated with lesion volumes in the tem-
poral, medial frontal, and superior frontal lobes, and with
the number of lesions in the left and right superior frontal
lobes, right anterior cingulate gyrus, and left parietal
operculum. Regardless of the subject group, women out-
performed men on the taste measures. These findings
indicate that a sizable number of MS patients exhibit taste
deficits
that
are
associated
with
MS-related
lesions
throughout the brain.

Introduction
The influence of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common
neurologic disease of young adulthood, on taste perception
has received scant attention, despite the fact that 10–15 %
of community dwelling patients with MS suffer from
malnutrition [1]. Based on self-report or cursory sensory
testing, MS-related taste disorders have been assumed to be
rare, often being \
5 % [2–7]. However, people reporting
taste deficits typically have olfactory, not taste, dysfunction
[7], and are generally inaccurate in recognizing true taste
dysfunction
when
present
[8].

 electrogustometry and other quantitative taste tests typi-
cally observe somewhat higher prevalence rates. For
example, Rollin [9] reported that 9 of 75 MS patients
exhibited elevated electrogustometric thresholds (12 %),
although specific details of the testing were lacking. Three
relatively recent whole-mouth taste studies have reported
levels of disturbance in approximately 20 % of MS
patients, although distinctions among taste qualities and
tongue regions were not made [10–12]. In the sole study to
examine possible associations between taste test scores and
MS-related lesions, the identification scores of 25 subjects,
combined across taste qualities, were inversely correlated
with lesion numbers (r = -0.49) and lesion volumes
(r = -0.52) within the ‘‘olfactory brain’’, i.e., the piriform
and entorhinal cortices, frontal agranular regions of the
insular lobe up to the anterior commissure, and the orbi-
tofrontal cortex [12].
In this study, we administered a sensitive and well-
validated 96-trial taste test to a relatively large number of
MS patients and matched controls to more definitively
assess the influences of MS on taste function. The study
had four main objectives: first, to establish the frequency
and magnitude of taste deficits in the MS patients; second,
to determine whether such dysfunction, when present, is
uniform across disparate tongue regions; third, to deter-
mine whether the MS-related taste deficits differ among
sweet, sour, bitter and salty tasting stimuli; and fourth, to
evaluate whether taste test scores are associated with the
number and volume of MS-related lesions in 26 brain
regions within each side of the brain (i.e., 52 total brain
structures).
Materials and methods
Subjects
The subjects were 73 patients with well-documented MS
and 73 healthy controls matched to the patients on the
basis of age, sex, ethnicity, and education (Table 1).
Approximately half came from within the University of
Pennsylvania Health System, whereas the remainder came
from outside this system. Most were recruited through
their physician, MS support group, or a local MS
newsletter. Controls were obtained through advertise-
ments placed in newspapers or fliers posted in the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania or around the
University’s campus. Individuals were excluded from
consideration if they had a positive medical history for
non-MS disorders that could confound not only the gus-
tatory, but also the other sensory tests performed in the
program. These included Bell’s palsy, chronic rhinosi-
nusitis, chronic lung infection, epilepsy, emphysema, liver
disease, stroke, seizure disorder, neurodegenerative dis-
ease other than MS, schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar
disorder, dementia, amnesia, depression requiring medi-
cation or hospitalization, chronic alcoholism or drug
abuse, brain surgery, or facial injuries or head trauma
leading to loss of consciousness, among others.
This research was a component of a comprehensive
program that evaluated auditory, olfactory, gustatory,
vestibular, and neuropsychological function of the same set
of MS patients. Findings from the other elements of the
program have been published [13] or are in preparation for
publication. The study was approved by the University’s
Office of Regulatory Affairs and all subjects provided
informed written consent. The research was performed in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki (1964) and its later amendments. Each subject was
paid $20 per hour for participation and was reimbursed for
travel and food expenses.
Taste test protocol
The standardized taste test that was employed is described
elsewhere [14, 15]. Briefly, 15 lL of single concentra-
tions of sucrose (0.49 M), sodium chloride (0.31 M),
citric acid (0.015 M), and caffeine (0.04 M), equated for
viscosity by the addition of cellulose to minimize stimu-
lus migration, were presented via an Eppendorf pipette to
the left and right sides of the tongue tip and on or near
the left and right lateral circumvallate papillae. Each
subject indicated whether a given stimulus tasted sweet,
sour, bitter or salty by pointing to names on a chart before
retracting the tongue and orally rinsing with purified
water. A total of 96 stimulus trials and accompanying
rinses was employed (4 tastants 9 6 trials 9 4 tongue
regions). Additionally, perceived intensity was rated on a
visually graded category scale with anchors of ‘‘very
weak’’ and ‘‘very strong’’ and a logarithmic visual density
background
denoting
non-linear
increasing
sensation
magnitudes [16].
Imaging protocol
All MS patients underwent, usually on the same day as the
sensory testing, thin section magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of the brain with gadolinium enhancement using a
General Electric (Milwaukee, WI) 1.5-T Signa scanner
employing a standard head coil. Usable images were
available for 63 of the patients and were employed to
quantify the number of lesions and volumes in multiple
brain regions. The MRI evaluations included fluid-attenu-
ated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and double-echo long-TR
axial scans with 3-mm thick slices through the entire brain.
The matrix was 256 9 192 pixels and the field of view was

 240 mm2, allowing for detailed assessment of MS-related
lesion intensity within selected brain regions. Brain vol-
umes were extracted semi-automatically using a combi-
nation of thresholding, morphological operators, and region
growing, followed by manual refinement [17, 18]. Lesions
were then defined semi-automatically by first using a fuzzy
segmentation algorithm applied to the multichannel brain
extracted images [19, 20]. This algorithm was modified to
model lesion intensities as outliers, similar to the approach
described by Van Leemput et al. [21]. The resulting seg-
mentation was inclusive of all lesions but included false-
positives that were manually removed by a trained opera-
tor. If a lesion fell into two regions, it was counted as a
lesion in both of the regions. However, its volume was
parceled between the two regions into which it fell. The
intra-rater reliability intraclass correlation coefficient for
our approach based upon 10 cases repeated twice by the
same operator was above 0.99. Regions of interest were
defined automatically by applying a high-dimensional,
non-linear registration of a manually parcellated atlas
image to each subject (Figs. 1, 2) [22, 23]. The atlas was
based on a T1-weighted MRI from a healthy subject. Thus,
the regions of interest were defined by manually labeling a
template MRI brain and deforming this image into each
subject’s brain image using the HAMMER algorithm. The
labels were transferred with this deformation. A total of 26
brain regions were defined for each side of the brain (i.e.,
52 total brain structures; Table 2). These regions were
chosen to incorporate well-established brain structures
applicable to a range of sensory studies that are being
performed on the data set.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were made using modules from
SYSTAT [24]. Initially we determined the number of MS

 subjects who performed more poorly than the control
subjects, as determined by taste identification test scores
falling below the 5th percentile of those of the controls.
Preliminary analyses were performed on each test measure
and taste stimulus to explore the influences of key vari-
ables on the dependent measures. Smoking behavior, dis-
ease duration, and handedness did not meaningfully
contribute to any of the analyses and were dropped from
subsequent models. Since tongue side was not significant,
the data from the two sides of the tongue were combined
for subsequent analyses, resulting in anterior (CN VII) and
posterior (CN IX) measures. The final model, performed
on the data for each tastant separately, was an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) with the between group factors of
patient group (MS, control) and sex (M,F), and the within
group factor of tongue region (anterior, posterior). Age
served as a covariate. To simplify the presentation of
results, F values and degrees of freedom are not reported
in the text; g2 values, which reflect effect sizes, are
reported only when significant p values are present.
Because the lesion frequency distributions were strongly
skewed to the right, non-parametric Spearman correlations
were computed to determine whether meaningful associa-
tions were present among the taste measures and the two
lesion measures (lesion number, volume) within the target
brain regions. p values were unadjusted for multiple com-
parisons to avoid type II errors and associated problems [25,
26]; however, the number of computations was limited to
subgroups with lesion activity. In these analyses, the lesion
data from the left and right sides of the brain were retained as
separate entities in light of possible lateralized associations
with lesions in some brain regions [27, 28].
Results
Taste quality identification
The percent of MS patients whose overall taste identifi-
cation test scores fell below the 5th percentile of control
subjects was 15.07 % for caffeine (bitter), 21.9 % for
citric acid (sour), 24.66 % for sucrose (sweet), and
31.50 % for NaCl (salty). The patients with MS identified,
on average, fewer stimuli than did the control subjects for
each taste quality, as demonstrated by a significant main
effect of subject group (MS/control) in all analyses
(Fig. 3; p and g2 values shown in figure). Irrespective of
subject group, women outperformed men in identifying
the

covariate
was
significant
only
for
sodium
chloride
(p = 0.014, g2 = 0.034; all other ps C 0.10], reflecting
an overall age-related decline in performance for this
stimulus.
In general, the MS-related influences on taste function
were found on both the front and the back of the tongue, as
no interactions were evident between tongue region and
subject group (all ps [ 0.20). However, a significant sub-
ject group by tongue region by sex interaction was present
for caffeine (p = 0.003). This reflected the fact that women
with MS significantly underperformed their female controls
in identifying the bitter taste of caffeine on the front, but
not the back, of the tongue [respective MS and control
anterior values: 74.59 (2.89) and 86.63 (2.89); p = 0.004,
g2 = 0.079, respective posterior values: 82.14 (2.67) and
85.97 (2.67); p = 0.311, g2 = 0.010], whereas a non-sig-
nificant trend in the opposite direction was present for the
men [respective anterior MS and control values: 60.23
(6.28) and 60.41 (6.28), p = 0.984, g2 \ 0.001; respective
posterior MS and control values: 54.70 (5.73) and 69.12
(5.73), p = 0.083, g2 = 0.070].
Intensity ratings
The mean intensity rating of the MS patients was signifi-
cantly lower than that of the controls for caffeine [re-
spective means (SEMs) = 4.95 (0.22) and 4.41 (0.22),
p \ 0.05, g2 = 0.086), but not for any other tastant
(ps [ 0.20). Significant main effects of sex were present
for all tastants, reflecting larger intensity ratings given by

Relationship of taste test measures to brain lesions
within the MS group
Because lesions were absent or sparse in a number of the
targeted brain structures and a range of lesion values was
needed to establish meaningful correlation coefficients
with the taste measures, we focused our correlation
analyses on brain structures in which lesions were present
in at least 21 of the 63 MS patients (Table 2). The
Spearman correlations between lesion volumes in the
primary brain regions and the taste identification test
scores for the left and right sides of the tongue are pre-
sented in Table 3. It is apparent that the taste identifica-
tion scores were correlated, albeit weakly, with lesion
volumes within the larger brain structures—structures in
which typically more than 1 % of their volume was
comprised of lesions (Table 2). No systematic associa-
tions between the side of the lesions and the side of the
tongue that was tested were observed. Only four signifi-
cant negative correlations were found between the number
of lesions and the taste identification test scores, in con-
trast to the 40 significant negative coefficients shown in
Table 3 for lesion volumes. Two were between the left
side sour identification scores and the number of lesions
in

(both
rs = -0.26, ps \ 0.025), one was between the left side

between the left side sweet identification test score and
the number of lesions in the right anterior cingulate gyrus
(r = -0.29, p \ 0.05).

nificant differences in the taste intensity ratings between

 the MS patients and the controls, i.e., an association only
for caffeine, we found few correlations among lesion vol-
umes and the intensity ratings, with only 8 of 216 coeffi-
cients being significant, albeit all in the negative direction.
Interestingly, none of these correlations reached the nom-
inal 0.05 alpha level for caffeine, the only stimulus for
which a significant difference appeared in the mean
intensity ratings between the MS patients and the controls.
Five of the correlations were related to lesions in the right
superior frontal lobe, one in the right cortex, and two in the
left cortex (Table 4). Correlations between the number of
lesions and intensity ratings were similarly sparse. Thus,
only two significant negative correlations were observed:
sour intensity ratings on the left side of the tongue with
lesion numbers in the left and right frontal lobes (both
rs = -0.28,
ps \
0.025).
All
coefficients
computed
between the lesion numbers in these two brain structures
and the 8 taste test measures were in the expected negative
direction (16/16; 100 %).
A small subset, i.e., 4–5, of the patients had lesions
within the brainstem and/or pons that were lateralized to
one side or the other. Since an initial segment of the taste
pathway passes through these structures, it was conceivable
that taste function might be more compromised on the side
of the tongue ipsilateral to the location of the lesions.
However, the average taste scores on the side of the tongue
ipsilateral to the side of the brainstem lesions did not differ
from that of the average taste scores on the tongue con-
tralateral to the lesion side, providing no support for the
concept that, in MS, unilateral lesion activity within the
brainstem differentially altered taste function on the left or
the right sides of the tongue.
Discussion
This research represents the most comprehensive study
performed to date on the influences of MS on the ability to
taste. It determined whether associations are present
between taste function and quantitative measures of brain
lesions in MS and whether MS differentially influences
various taste qualities and taste function mediated by CN
VII (anterior 2/3rds of the tongue) and CN IX (posterior
third of the tongue) afferents. MS significantly influenced
the ability to identify tastants for all four classic taste
qualities on both anterior and posterior regions of the
tongue. Additionally, MS altered intensity ratings for the
tastant caffeine. Taste identification test scores were cor-
related with the lesion volumes in the frontal and temporal
lobes and a sizable proportion of the MS patients exhibited
scores falling below the 5th percentile of those of matched
controls. No lateralized taste deficits relative to lateralized
lesions within the pons, brainstem, or elsewhere were

 apparent. The fifth taste quality that is generally recognized
today, umami, was not tested in this study, although pre-
sumably it would also be influenced by MS since deficits in
umami taste have been found to be related to deficits in
other taste qualities in clinical studies (e.g., [29]). In accord
with earlier taste research in normal subjects [30], women
generally outperformed men on all of our tests in both the
MS and control groups, conceivably reflecting the fact that
women possess a larger number of taste papillae and taste
buds than do men [31].
Although the 15–32 % prevalence rate for taste dys-
function relative to controls was about half of that generally
found for optic neuritis, a hallmark in the diagnosis of MS
[32], it is nonetheless a substantial number. This suggests
that altered taste function, albeit modest in magnitude and
less noticeable than changesin vision, is a relatively common
feature of MS. In general, most of our prevalence estimates
of MS-related taste dysfunction (caffeine, 15.07 %; citric
acid, 21.9 %; sucrose, 24.66 %; NaCl, 31.50 %) are higher
than the 8 to *22 % prevalence estimates noted by other
investigators who have performed quantitative or semi-
quantitative taste testing of MS patients [5, 7, 10–12, 33].
Presumably this reflects differences in the criteria for
defining dysfunction, the types of tastants and test proce-
dures employed, sample sizes, and other factors. The low
prevalence of taste dysfunction reported in numerous sur-
veys presumably reflects the fact that most persons are
unaware of less-than-total or near-total taste loss [8]. Such
lack of awareness also is evident in the general population, as
well as in Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
However, lack of awareness does not avert clinical signifi-
cance, since such losses can be harbingers for nutritional
deficits [34] and higher subsequent mortality [35, 36].
An important finding of the present study is that MS
influenced the ability to identify all four classic taste
qualities (Fig. 1). Most previous MS studies have not dis-
tinguished between taste qualities [5, 10, 11] or have
reported that the deficits were limited to only a few such
qualities. For example, Catalanotto et al. [37] noted
adverse influences for taste quality identification and
suprathreshold intensity perception only for NaCl (salty)
and quinine hydrochloride (bitter); sweet (sucrose) and
sour (citric acid) perception was not similarly affected. Our
research suggests that the influence of MS is more wide-
spread, although it is of interest that the only stimulus for
which we observed an MS-related intensity deficit was for
the bitter tasting agent caffeine, in accord with one of the
observations of Catalanotto et al.
Our finding that MS impacted taste identification ability
more than intensity perception conceivably reflects several
factors. First, higher brain regions—regions with the most
MS-related lesion activity—may influence taste quality more
than perceived strength. For example, one functional imaging

 study found the anterior insula/operculum and caudolateral
orbitofrontal cortex to be less sensitive to stimulus intensity
than the amygdala, pons, and middle insula [38]. Second, our
intensity measure, based upon a single concentration for each
of four tastants, may have lacked the sensitivity to detect a
broader range of MS-related intensity deficits. However, it
should be noted that both threshold and identification tests
appear to be more sensitive to chemosensory deficits than
suprathreshold scaling procedures. A classic example is a
magnitude estimation study that completely missed the well-
established age-related deficit observed using tests of odor
identification and threshold sensitivity [39]. A recent meta-
analysis of studies of taste function in older persons found
taste threshold deficits in 94 % of the studies evaluated (17/
18), whereas suprathreshold intensity deficits were observed
in only 64 % of the evaluated studies (16/25) [40]. Never-
theless, the question remains as to what degree the smaller
decrements observed in suprathreshold intensity measures
represent methodological or physiological processes.
Although weobservedveryfew lesions withinthe ponsand
brainstem, those that were observed were lateralized. Our
finding that this lateralization was not mirrored by lateralized
taste function may reflect the fact that such lesions are not
independent of bilateral lesions found elsewhere in the brain.
Under the assumption that the latter lesions influence the
ability to taste, any unilateral influences at the level of the
brainstem would likely be swamped. Had lesions other than
the brainstem and pons lesions not been present, dispropor-
tionate unilateral dysfunction would have been expected.
Thus, Onoda and Ikeda noted, in a review of 15 non-MS
clinical cases of taste function, that unilateral gustatory
impairment occurred with unilateral injury to any one of
several brain structures, namely the pons (8 cases), thalamus
(5 cases), midbrain (one case), and internal capsule (one case)
[41]. These authors surmised, based on the side of the lesions
and their effect on either unilateral or contralateral gustatory
function, that the gustatory pathways ascend homolaterally
from the medulla, cross in their course from the pons to the
midbrain, and synapse within the contralateral thalamus.
Bilaterally diminished taste responses have been observed in
patients with unilateral midbrain and unilateral paramedian
thalamic infarcts [42, 43].
Another important finding of our study is that the taste
identification scores were negatively correlated with lesion
volumes in the cortex, frontal lobe, and temporal lobes.
Similar associations were less evident in other brain
structures or for taste intensity ratings. Although the cor-
relation coefficients are moderate, they are similar in
magnitude to those reported by others between MS lesions
and cognitive measures [44, 45]. Like some other studies
(e.g., [46]), we found lesion volumes to be more strongly
correlated with the dependent measures than lesion num-
bers, conceivably reflecting the fact that lesions can vary in
size, with some spanning larger sectors of neural tissue
than others [47].
It is of significance that a number of brain structures inti-
mately associatedwith taste function had no or few MS-related
lesions, implying that the adverse influence of MS on taste
largely involves higher brain structures. Nevertheless, lesions
madeup\
2 %ofthevolumeofthelargebrainregionswiththe
most lesion activity, suggesting that only a minority of such
lesions impact neural pathways related to taste function,
potentially explaining why normal taste function is present in
most MS patients. Other explanations of weak associations
between taste test scores and MS-related lesions include the
potential redundancy and plasticity of neural circuits in higher
brain regions [48] and the underestimation of disease burden
due to generalized changes in normally appearing CNS white
matter [49, 50]. Importantly,one cannot rule out the possibility
that much of the influence of MS on taste function is not
directly related to observable lesion activity but is due to more
subtle damage to membrane channels. At the receptor level,
taste perception depends upon movement of Na? and H? ions
through specialized membrane channels, either directly as in
the case of salty and sour tastants (e.g., the amiloride-sensitive
Na? channel and ENaC-like channels) [51] or indirectly, as in
the case of sweet- and bitter-tasting stimuli that activate
G-protein coupled receptors [52–54]. MS is known to influ-
ence both ionotropic and metabotropic forms of neural trans-
mission and could conceivably exert some of its effects at the
level of the cell membrane [55, 56].
Among the strongest influences on taste function
observed in this study was that of sex. Women generally
outperformed men on all of our tests in both the MS and
control groups. This is in accord with sex differences noted
in other taste studies [30], as well as the fact that women
typically outperform men on a wide range of sensory tasks,
including ones involving hearing, olfaction, and touch [57].
Women have been found to possess a larger number of
taste papillae and taste buds than men [31] and, after cor-
recting for cranial volume, have larger frontal and medial
paralimbic cortices. Men, on the other hand, have larger
relative volumes of the hypothalamus, frontomedial cortex,
and amygdala [58]. To what degree such factors dictate the
sex differences observed in taste function is unknown,
although being a female may afford some degree of pro-
tection from adverse influences on the taste system.
The present study has both strengths and weaknesses.
Among its strengths are its relatively large sample size,
sophisticated regional taste testing of both sexes, and assess-
ments of associations between the taste test scores and the MS-
related lesions, as measured by MRI. Multiple tongue regions
and stimuli were evaluated, allowing for a determination of
regional deficits in taste function and their associations with
MS-relatedCNSbrainlesions.Amongitsweaknessesare(a)its

 of available taste stimuli, including numerous sodium and
potassium salts, (b) its evaluation of only suprathreshold taste
perception, which may be less sensitive than taste threshold
measures, and (c) the calculation of a relatively large number of
correlations between the taste measures and the brain lesion
activity, potentially inflating the type I error rate. That being
said, the observed correlations were logically consistent and
were in the expected negative direction. As noted above, it is of
interest that in our patient population lesions were sparse in
brain structures generally associated with the primary taste
projections,namelythebrainstem,pons,andmedulla,yetclear-
cut associations between lesion volumes and taste function
were evident throughout higher brain structures.
In summary, the present study clearly demonstrates that
MS is commonly associated with decrements in the ability to
identify all four classic taste qualities within both anterior and
posterior regions of the tongue. Female MS patients, like
women in general, identified tastants more accurately and
rated their perception as more intense than did male MS
patients. Our study demonstrates that lesion volumes within
large sectors of the frontal and temporal lobes are correlated
with functional measures of taste. In light of the discovery of
taste receptor proteins within the alimentary tract [51], future
research may be of value in determining whether MS-related
changes in oral taste function are associated with gastric
motility, changes in microbiota, and other MS-related alter-
ations in which extraoral taste receptors may play a role [59].
