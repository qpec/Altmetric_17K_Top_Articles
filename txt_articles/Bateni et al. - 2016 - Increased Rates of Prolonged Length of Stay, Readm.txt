Abstract
Background
The impact of surgery on end of life care for patients with disseminated malignancy (DMa)
is incompletely characterized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative out-
comes impacting quality of care among DMa patients, specifically prolonged length of hos-
pital stay, readmission, and disposition.
Methods
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-
NSQIP) database was queried for years 2011–2012. DMa patients were matched to non-
DMa patients with comparable clinical characteristics and operation types. Primary hepatic
operations were excluded, leaving a final cohort of 17,972 DMa patients. The primary out-
comes were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression models.
Results
DMa patients represented 2.1% of all ACS-NSQIP procedures during the study period. The
most frequent operations were bowel resections (25.3%). Compared to non-DMa matched
controls, DMa patients had higher rates of postoperative overall morbidity (24.4% vs.
18.7%, p<0.001), serious morbidity (14.9% vs. 12.0%, p<0.001), mortality (7.6% vs. 2.5%,
p<0.001), prolonged length of stay (32.2% vs. 19.8%, p<0.001), readmission (15.7% vs.
9.6%, p<0.001), and discharges to facilities (16.2% vs. 12.9%, p<0.001). Subgroup analy-
ses of patients by procedure type showed similar results. Importantly, DMa patients who
did not experience any postoperative complication experienced significantly higher rates of
prolonged length of stay (23.0% vs. 11.8%, p<0.001), readmissions (10.0% vs. 5.2%,

vs. 0.8%, p<0.001) compared to matched non-DMa patients.
Conclusion
Surgical interventions among DMa patients are associated with poorer postoperative out-
comes including greater postoperative complications, prolonged length of hospital stay,
readmissions, disposition to facilities, and death compared to non-DMa patients. These
data reinforce the importance of clarifying goals of care for DMa patients, especially when
acute changes in health status potentially requiring surgery occur.
Introduction
Although patients and clinicians consider oncologic outcome and survival the pre-eminent
goals of cancer therapy, quality of life and avoidance of therapeutic morbidity, particularly
among patients with stage IV cancer, are receiving increasing attention as important goals of
care.[1–5] Prolonged length of hospital stay, intensive care unit stays, emergency room visits,
hospital readmissions, and aggressive therapies, such as chemotherapy and surgery, have come
under scrutiny given the increasing emphasis on improved palliative care and quality of life for
patients near their end of life.[1–5] These issues create a dilemma for many surgeons, as
patients with stage IV cancer commonly present with acute surgical conditions, such as bowel
obstructions.[6,7] In addition, surgeons are frequently faced with questions of whether surgical
interventions should be performed electively on this patient population, since symptom pallia-
tion and prolongation of life are often potential benefits of surgery.[8, 9] However, we and oth-
ers have shown that surgical intervention in this population is associated with high 30-day
morbidity and mortality, with rates ranging from 27–44% and 9–11% respectively.[8–11] It is
unclear to what extent this elevated post-surgical morbidity impacts other metrics of surgical
outcomes among patients with disseminated malignancy (DMa) such as prolonged postopera-
tive length of hospital stay, hospital readmission following the index surgical procedure, and
disposition to facilities such as nursing homes.
The purpose of the present study was therefore to evaluate these outcomes, specificallypro-
longed length of hospital stay, readmissions, and disposition to facilities other than home,
among DMa patients undergoing surgery since these outcomes can clearly impact the quality
of life and overall trajectory of disease in patients with incurable malignancy. We hypothesized
DMa patients would have substantially increased rates of these primary endpoints compared
to non-DMa patients.
Methods
Data source, study population, and variable definitions
Data were obtained from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) from the years 2011 to 2012 (N = 986,034). ACS-NSQIP
data collection methods have been describedpreviously and have been shown to high data
integrity and reliability.[12] These years were specificallyselected due to the addition of data
variables for disposition destination and 30-day hospital readmission. Analysis of readmission
data was restricted to 2011 due to >99% data missing for 2012.

 DMa patients undergoing surgical intervention were identified as describedpreviously
(N = 20,638 before exclusion).[11] ACS-NSQIP defines DMa as “patients who have cancer
that: (1) has spread to one or more sites in addition to the primary site and (2) in whom the
presence of multiple metastases indicates the cancer is widespread, fulminant or near termi-
nal.”[13] Patients undergoing primary hepatic operation (N = 2,543) were excluded, as prior
research has shown that hepatic operations are potentially curative in selected patients.[14–16]
We performed 1:1 matching of DMa to non-DMa patients who underwent an operation
during this same time period. Patients were matched on the following characteristics: age, pre-
operative functional status, preoperative sepsis, procedure classification, and emergency proce-
dure. These characteristics were specificallychosen as they have previously been shown to be
independent predictors of postoperative morbidity and mortality for DMa patients.[10, 11]
Standard ACS-NSQIP definitions were used to define these variables.[13] After matching, 123
DMa patients were excluded due to missing data from �1 of the matched variables, with a final
cohort of 17,972 matched pairs.
Current procedural terminology(CPT) codes were used to classify procedures into the fol-
lowing categories: abdominal operations, neurosurgery, orthopedic,thoracic, urologic, gyneco-
logic, skin/soft tissue, biopsy/lymph node excision, vascular, thyroid/parathyroid,
otolaryngology, and cardiac operations. Abdominal operations were further categorized into
small and large bowel resections, other small bowel and colorectal surgery, celiotomy and lysis
of adhesions, pancreatic surgery, gastrectomy, other gastric surgeries, cholecystectomy, appen-
dectomy, splenectomy, adrenal, biliary and other abdominal surgeries (e.g. excision of retro-
peritoneal mass). These categories were used for matching procedure type.
We then abstracted data on 3 demographic, 19 preoperative, 3 intraoperative, and 24 post-
operative variables for DMa patients and matched controls. Standard ACS-NSQIP definitions
were used for these variables with the following exceptions.[13] Multivisceral resections were
identified based on the classification of the primary procedure CPT codes with additional pro-
cedure CPT codes. Postoperative prolonged length of hospital stay was defined as a length of
stay � the 75th percentile for all operations for DMa patients and non-DMa matched controls,
which was �10 days. This definition was consistent with prior published research using
ACS-NSQIP.[17–19] Disposition to a facility other than home was defined as patient discharge
to skilled care (e.g. transitional care, subacute hospital, ventilator bed, skilled nursing),
unskilled facility (e.g. nursing home or assisted facility), other facility (e.g. chronic care,
unskilled facility or assisted living), acute care or rehab facility.
Postoperative overall morbidity was defined as experiencingone or more of the following
events within 30 days of the principal operation: superficial or deep wound infection, organ
space infection, fascial dehiscence, pneumonia, reintubation, prolonged intubation, pulmonary
embolism, progressive renal insufficiency, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, urinary tract
infection, stroke, coma for >24 hours, peripheral nerve injury, cardiac arrest, myocardial
infarction, graft/prosthesis/flap failure, deep vein thrombosis, reoperation, sepsis, and septic
shock.[11]
Post-operative serious morbidity was defined as experiencinga complication associated
with requiring further invasive procedures or leading to lasting disability, organ dysfunction,
and/or death,[20] which included one or more of the following complications within 30 days
of the principal operation: organ space infection, fascial dehiscence, pulmonary embolism,
respiratory or cardiac failure requiring reintubation, prolonged intubation, acute renal failure
requiring dialysis, reoperation, graft or flap failure requiring further procedures, stroke, coma,
cardiac arrest or systemic shock.
Since all patient information was de-identified,this study was exempt from UC Davis Insti-
tutional Review Board approval.

 Statistical analysis
Differences in preoperative and intraoperative patient characteristics were compared between
DMa and non-DMa patients using Chi-squared test for categorical variables and two-tailed
independent t-tests for continuous variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine
predictors of the primary and secondary outcomes, overall and serious morbidity, mortality,
disposition to a facility, prolonged length of stay and hospital readmissions, for DMa patients.
Multivariate conditional cox regression analysis was performed to determine risk of these pri-
mary and secondaryoutcomes for patients with DMa controlling for any residual confounding.
Covariates included in the model comprised of gender, diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension,
congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or kidney dis-
ease requiring dialysis, symptoms of dyspnea, ascites, or weight loss, ventilator dependence,
steroid use, albumin and multivisceral resection. DNR status and preoperative chemotherapy
and radiotherapy were excluded from the multivariate analysis due to >55% of the data miss-
ing in the ACS-NSQIP database for these variables. Statistical significancewas set at p<0.05.
Case matching and all analyses were performed using SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics Ver-
sion 22) and Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.4.
Results
General characteristics
From 2011 to 2012, 986,034 patients in the ACS-NSQIP database underwent surgical proce-
dures with 2.1% (n = 20,638) diagnosed with DMa. After exclusion of patients who underwent
a primary hepatic operation (n = 2,543) and who were not successfully matched (n = 123),
17,972 DMa patients were identified.
Preoperative and intraoperative patient characteristics of the matched pairs are depicted in
Table 1. As expected,there were no significant differences between DMa patients and matched
cohorts with respect to age, functional status, preoperative sepsis, and emergency operations.
However, there were significant differences between the groups with respect to gender, DNR sta-
tus, comorbid health conditions, BMI, preoperative weight loss, recent history of chemotherapy
or radiation therapy, preoperative laboratory values, and rates of multivisceral resections.
As shown in Table 1, DMa patients had a slightly lower BMI (27.2 ±6.6 vs. 28.7 ±7.2,
p<0.01) and were more likely to have had significant preoperative weight loss (11.1% vs. 3.6%,
p<0.01), ascites (6.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.01), preoperative systemic steroids for a chronic medical
condition (10.1% vs. 5.0%, p<0.01), and preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy
(27.9% vs. 2.9% and 6.8% vs. 1.4% respectively, p<0.01). DMa patients had a lower creatinine
(0.96 ±0.67 vs. 1.09 ±1.02, p<0.01), albumin (3.5 ±0.78 vs. 3.71 ±0.76, p<0.01), and hematocrit
(35.6 ±5.8 vs. 38.4 ±5.7, p<0.01) and were more likely to undergo a multivisceral resection
(10.7% vs. 4.3%, p<0.01).
Non-DMa patients were more likely to have a comorbid health condition including diabetes
mellitus (17.4% vs. 14.8%, p<0.01), hypertension (53.0% vs. 48.1%, p<0.01), congestive heart
failure (CHF) (1.3% vs. 0.9%, p<0.01), and renal failure requiring dialysis (2.4% vs. 0.8%,
p<0.01).
As depicted in Table 2, the majority of operations performed on DMa patients were abdom-
inal operations (50.3%, n = 9,040) with bowel resections being the most common (25.3%,
n = 4,538), followed by other small bowel and colorectal procedures (6.8%, n = 1,222), and
celiotomy/lysis of adhesions (4.0%, n = 723). Neurosurgical operations were the second most
common type of operation (10.5%, n = 1,881) followed by orthopedic surgery (7.1%,
n = 1,275).

ing dialysis (p<0.05). Older age, symptoms of dyspnea, ascites, and weight loss, preoperative
steroid use, increased creatinine and lower hematocrit were additional predictors of mortality
(p<0.05).

 Predictors of discharge to a facility and prolonged length of stay included older age
(OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.04–1.05, p<0.001 and OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.001–1.008, p<0.01
respectively), impaired functional status (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.89–2.37, p<0.001 and
OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.18–1.51, p<0.001), lower albumin (OR = 0.58 95%CI = 0.54–0.62,
p<0.001 and OR = 0.42, 95%CI = 0.39–0.45, p<0.001), lower hematocrit (OR = 0.99, 95%
CI = 0.98–0.99, p<0.01 and OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.96–0.98, p<0.001) and emergency opera-
tions (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.18–1.52, p<0.001 and OR = 1.54, 95%CI = 1.36–1.74, p<0.001).
Diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension and preoperative steroid use were also predictors of
discharge to a facility among DMa patients, p<0.05. Male gender, African American ethnicity,
preoperative diagnoses of COPD and CHF, sepsis, ascites, weight loss, and multivisceral resec-
tions were additional predictors of prolonged length of stay, p<0.05. Male gender, ascites and
low albumin were the only statistically significant predictors of hospital readmission, p<0.05.
Morbidity and mortality
DMa patients had significantly higher rates of postoperative overall 30-day morbidity (24.4%
vs. 18.7%; aHR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.27–1.44, p<0.001), serious morbidity (14.9% vs. 12.0%;
aHR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.16–1.34, p<0.001) and mortality (7.6% vs. 2.5%; aHR = 3.89, 95%
CI = 3.36–4.49 p<0.001) compared to matched non-DMa patients (Table 3). Subgroup analy-
sis of DMa patients who underwent a bowel resection (n = 4,538) showed similar results. As
shown in Table 4, 36.8% (n = 1,669) of DMa patients experienceda postoperative complication
after bowel resection compared to 29.2% (n = 1,324) of non-DMa patients (aHR = 1.35, 95%
CI = 1.22–1.49, p<0.001), 21.9% (n = 993) of DMa patients experienceda serious complication
compared to 18.2% (n = 825) of non-DMa patients (aHR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.08–1.38,
p<0.001), and 9.3% (n = 424) of DMa patients died within 30 days after the index operation
compared to 4.1% (n = 186) of non-DMa patients (aHR = 2.99, 95%CI = 2.36–3.78, p<0.001).
DMa patients who underwent a celiotomy/lysis of adhesions did not have statistically signif-
icant differences with respect to morbidity compared to non-DMa patients, but did have a sub-
stantial increase in mortality (16.4% vs. 5.3%, aHR = 6.27, 95%CI = 3.06–13.85, p<0.001).
Prolonged length of stay, readmission, and disposition
Table 3 depicts rates of prolonged length of hospital stay, 30-day readmissions, and disposition
to a facility for DMa patients who underwent any operation. Overall, DMa patients had signifi-
cantly higher rates of prolonged length of hospital stays (32.2% vs. 19.8%, aHR = 1.85, 95%
CI = 1.74–1.97, p<0.001), readmission (15.7% vs. 9.6%, aHR = 1.60, 95%CI = 1.42–1.79,

compared to non-DMa patients.
Subgroup analysis of bowel resections demonstrated similar results. As shown in Table 4,
DMa patients who underwent bowel resections had significantly higher rates of prolonged
length of stay (47.5% vs. 31.5%, aHR = 1.83, 95%CI = 1.65–2.03, p<0.001) and discharge to a

underwent celiotomy/lysis of adhesions, although rates of these three primary endpoints were
higher among DMa patients compared to non-DMa patients, these differences were not statis-
tically significant in the multivariate analysis.
Importantly, as shown in Table 5, DMa patients who did not experience any ACS-NSQIP
postoperative complication nevertheless experiencedsignificantly higher rates of prolonged

 Discussion
Our findings that DMa patients were at greater risk of acute postoperative morbidity and mor-
tality are consistent with prior research.[8–11] However, most importantly, we observedthat
DMa patients undergoing surgery had significantly higher rates of prolonged length of hospital
stay, readmissions, and disposition to facilities other than home compared to non-DMa
matched controls. These data highlight the dilemma that physicians and surgeons commonly
face when presented with patients with DMa who are diagnosed with an acute surgical condi-
tion and/or condition that potentially may benefit from surgical palliation.
For example, surgeons are frequently consulted for malignant bowel obstruction,a diagno-
sis common in the setting of both ovarian and gastrointestinal malignancies, with rates as high
as 28–51%.[6, 21] Although malignant bowel obstruction may be successfully managed by
non-operative approaches, bowel obstruction is still considered a surgical condition, as in some
cases the consequences of a delay in indicated surgical treatment may be severe.[21–24] How-
ever, our results emphasize not only the significant risks of acute morbidity and mortality asso-
ciated with performing surgery, which others have also observed,[10,11, 22, 23] but also the
increased risks of prolonged hospital stays, hospital readmissions, and discharge to facilities.
For example, in our analysis, DMa patients who underwent bowel resections, a common sur-
gery performed for obstruction,were more likely to experience prolonged length of stay and
disposition to a facility other than home. In addition, these patients with DMa were more than
twice as likely to die within 30 days of the surgery compared to patients without DMa. This
increased risk of mortality was also present for DMa patients who underwent celiotomy or
lysis of adhesions as well, operations also commonly performed for bowel obstruction.
These findings complement previous research comparing medical versus surgical outcomes
for patients hospitalized with malignant bowel obstruction.Henry et al. observedin this retro-
spective single institution study that patients presenting with malignant bowel obstruction who
underwent surgical intervention experiencedlonger hospital stays and were more likely to be
discharged to an extended care facility compared to patients who were treated with medical
management.[22]
Data such as these highlight the need for physicians and surgeons to engage in goals of care
and end of life discussions with their patients prior to pursuing surgical intervention on
patients with DMa. Patients should be provided with an accurate assessment of the potential
risks of surgery, including incidence of prolonged length of hospital stay, readmission, and dis-
charge to a facility, as this information will likely have implications on their future quality of
life and willingness to undergo surgery. For example, many patients with terminal disease pre-
fer to die at home, as prior research has shown that in-hospital death among cancer patients is
associated with greater physical and emotional distress and worse quality of life.[5, 25] How-
ever, this end of life goal may not be met if surgical intervention is pursued, as our data show
that such intervention places patients at greater risk for prolonged hospital stay, readmission,
discharge to a facility and death within 30 days.
Our findings that DMa patients who did not experience a single complication nevertheless
experiencedan increased risk of prolonged length of hospital stay, readmission, discharge to a
facility and death compared to non-DMa matched controls also has important implications for
this patient population. It suggests that the diagnosis of DMa itself is a predictor of poorer out-
comes following surgical intervention. This may be due to many factors including greater
patient frailty, weight loss and malnutrition among DMa patients, as these are known factors
of adverse postoperative outcomes among cancer patients.[11, 26, 27] However, irrespective of
whether DMa is causally related to worse post-surgicaloutcomes or simply associated, the find-
ing of higher rates of prolonged hospital stay, readmission, and discharge to a facility in the

 absence of a post-surgicalcomplication undermines an important rationale for performing sur-
gery in this patient population, namely that patients who are successfully palliated by surgery
derive significant benefits. In fact, our data suggest that even patients whose surgery is uncom-
plicated experience adverse outcomes.
Despite such findings, we understand that there are instances when surgical management
will remain indicated and potentially life-saving for DMa patients. In such times, it is impor-
tant that surgeons understand all factors that further increase DMa patients surgical risk. Our
findings support prior literature identifying predictors of acute morbidity and mortality in
DMa patients to include increased age, male gender, poor functional status, preoperative dys-
pnea and sepsis, ventilator dependence, lower albumin, emergency operations, and multivisc-
eral resections.[10, 11] We found similar predictors of prolonged hospitalizations, disposition
to facilities other than home, and hospital readmissions among DMa patients. These findings
highlight the need for surgeons and other members of the healthcare team to clearly engage in
goals of care and end of life discussions with DMa patients since patients may experience
adverse outcomes beyond that of traditional acute surgical morbidity, and these outcomes may
impact their performance status, independence, as well as quality of life.
There are limitations of our study. Most importantly, we were not able to compare differ-
ences in outcomes between operative and nonoperative management since ACS-NSQIP only
captures data on surgical patients. Although our findings demonstrate the significant risks that
DMa patients harbor for acute morbidity and mortality as well as prolonged hospital stay, read-
mission, and discharge to a facility following surgery, it is inappropriate and premature at this
time to extrapolate these data to DMa patients who do not undergo surgery for similar surgical
conditions. This is an important subject for future investigation. Additionally, despite the
robust nature of ACS-NSQIP data,[12] patient outcomes greater than 30 days postoperatively
are not available. It is conceivable that DMa patients are more likely to experience the out-
comes of interest more quickly than non-DMa patients, thereby biasing our results given the
30-day ascertainment period. Furthermore, cause of death data is not available in ACS-NSQIP
data and, thusly, it is unclear if the increased risk of 30-day mortality among DMa patients is
secondaryto their terminal cancer diagnosis or the surgical intervention performed. Regardless
of cause of death, we contend, along with other cancer researchers, that invasive treatments
including chemotherapy and surgery near the end of life is indicative of poor patient selection
and arguably less than optimal quality of care.[1–3] Lastly, we did not have information
regarding the goals of surgical intervention (i.e. palliation vs. prolong life). Future research is
warranted to address these limitations, including evaluating postoperative outcomes and qual-
ity of life measurements for DMa patients who undergo surgical versus medical management
of a “surgical” condition, such as bowel obstruction.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that DMa patients who underwent surgical intervention
experiencedincreased rates of prolonged length of hospital stay, readmissions, minor and
major complications, discharges to facilities other than home, and death. These adverse out-
comes were demonstrated across the spectrumof surgical conditions. Such findings emphasize
the need for physicians, surgeons, and other members of the healthcare team to engage in goals
of care and end of life discussions with DMa patients prior to pursuing surgical intervention
since patients may experience adverse outcomes beyond that of traditional acute surgical mor-
bidity, and these outcomes may impact their performance status and independence.
