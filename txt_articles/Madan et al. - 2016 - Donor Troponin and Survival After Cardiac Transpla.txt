H
eart transplantation is one of the greatest achievements in 
modern medicine. Patients with advanced heart failure in 
whom survival is measured in weeks and months are offered the 
potential for survival of ≥10 years with excellent quality of life.1 
Unfortunately, during the past 2 decades the number of heart 
transplants performed in the United States has remained static, 
between 2000 and 2400 annually, which has been largely attrib-
uted to limited donor availability.2 Appropriately, the discussions 
focus on policies and initiatives to increase rates of organ dona-
tion.3 What has been less scrutinized is that on average only 1 
in 3 donor hearts offered is accepted for transplantation and that 
the donor acceptance rate has decreased during the past decade.2 
Although numerous organs are not accepted for transplantation 
for valid reasons, it is also true that many centers are unwilling to 
take risks on donor hearts, especially in the current climate where 
institutional outcomes are publically available. Therefore, it is 
critical to provide strong evidence that supports areas into which 
donor organ recovery could be safely expanded.
The use of serum levels of donor troponin, a biomarker 
of myocardial cell injury, to identify hearts unsuitable for 
transplantation is not validated and may unnecessarily limit 
the donor pool.4 Although currently no consensus exists, most 
centers would not accept an organ with significantly elevated 
troponin, despite preserved cardiac function.5 Even in the set-
ting of normal ejection fraction, elevated troponin may rep-
resent subclinical myocardial injury that could be unmasked 
by the ischemic time and immunologic injury of transplanta-
tion. Early studies involving a small number of patients lent 
credence to this notion by showing that elevated troponin 
was associated with early graft dysfunction and rejection.6–8 
Subsequent studies, similarly limited by sample size, have 
demonstrated conflicting results.4,9,10 Ultimately, there are no 
definitive data to guide the decision whether to accept or reject 
an organ solely on the basis of elevated troponin levels.
The purpose of the current analysis is to evaluate the effect 
of donor serum troponin levels on outcomes in heart trans-
plant recipients.

Background—Despite a limited supply of organs, only 1 in 3 potential donor hearts is accepted for transplantation. Elevated 
donor troponin levels have generally been considered a contraindication to heart transplantation; however, the data 
supporting this practice are limited.
Methods and Results—We identified 10 943 adult (≥18 years) heart transplant recipients in the United Network of Organ 
Sharing (UNOS) database with preserved donor left ventricular ejection fraction (≥50%) and where peak donor troponin 
I values were available. When analyzed as a continuous variable, there was no association between peak donor troponin 
levels and recipient mortality up to 1 year follow-up in unadjusted (hazards ratio, 0.999; 95% confidence interval, 0.997–
1.002; P=0.856) and adjusted Cox models (hazards ratio, 1.000; 95% confidence interval, 0.997–1.002; P=0.950). Next, 
we divided the entire cohort into 3 groups based on donor troponin I values: <1 ng/mL (n=7812), 1 to 10 ng/mL (n=2770), 
and >10 ng/mL (n=361). Using unadjusted and adjusted Cox models and Kaplan–Meier analysis, there was no significant 
difference in recipient mortality at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years between the 3 groups. Similarly, cardiac allograft 
vasculopathy up to 5 years and primary graft failure up to 30 days of follow-up post transplant did not differ between the 
3 donor troponin groups. The median length of hospital stay post transplant was also similar across groups.
Conclusions—Elevated donor troponin I levels in the setting of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction were not associated 
with intermediate-term mortality, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, or primary graft failure rates in hearts accepted for 
transplantation. This finding could help expand the donor pool.  (Circ Heart Fail. 2016;9:e002909. DOI: 10.1161/

Methods
Data Source and Study Cohort
All transplant services in the country are joined under the nation-
wide Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN), which is 
managed by the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) under 
contract from the US Department of Health and Human Services. 
Standard transplant analysis and follow-up files from OPTN database 
with patient level, nonidentifiable information on key elements are 
publically available on request and formed the data source for this 
analysis. No separate informed consent was required because the 
data were deidentified and used in compliance with the UNOS data 
use agreement. The Montefiore Medical Center Institutional Review 
Board approved this study.
All adult heart transplant recipients at least 18 years of age, who 
received their transplants between January 1, 2007, and September 
30, 2014, were eligible for this analysis. The study period coin-
cides with the regular reporting of donor troponin levels by UNOS. 
Although not included in the standard transplant analysis and fol-
low-up file, a query was requested for the peak troponin I level from 
hospital admission to organ harvest for each donor and linked to the 
respective donor and recipient files. The primary exclusion criteria 
included donor age >55 years, left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, 
significant donor coronary artery disease ≥50% stenosis, structural 
abnormalities in the donor heart (left ventricular hypertrophy, wall-
motion abnormalities, or valvular disease), simultaneous multiorgan 
transplants, retransplants, pediatric recipients, and unavailable donor 
troponin I values.
End Points
Patient follow-up was defined as the time from transplant to death or 
last known follow-up. To assess the effect of the peak donor troponin 
I levels on posttransplant outcomes, we analyzed the effect of donor 
troponin I levels as a continuous independent variable on recipient 
mortality at 1 year. We then divided the entire cohort into what the au-
thors felt were to be 3 clinically meaningful donor troponin I groups: 
<1 ng/mL, 1 to 10 ng/mL, and >10 ng/mL and compared mortality at 
30 days, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years of follow-up, primary graft fail-
ure (PGF) at 30 days, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) ≤5 
years of follow-up. For the purposes of this study, similar to a recent 
UNOS analysis, PGF was evaluated in terms of the hard outcomes of 
death or retransplant. PGF was defined as death or retransplantation 
within 30 days of the index cardiac transplant because of the graft 
failure, which was not related to infection, rejection, or surgical tech-
nical issues.11 UNOS does not have a standard methodology for CAV 
diagnosis and is based on self-reporting by transplant centers during 
recipient follow-up at yearly intervals. Recipients with missing or un-
known CAV status were excluded from the CAV analysis. Length of 
stay (LOS), from the time of transplant to hospital discharge, was also 
compared between the groups. Other important definitions include: 
(1) size mismatch—donor weight ≥30% below the recipient weight12 
and (2) sex mismatch—a transplant from a female donor to male 
recipient.13
Statistical Analysis
Recipient and donor baseline characteristics were described and strat-
ified based on donor troponin I values. All categorical variables were 
compared using χ2 test. Continuous variables were compared using 
ANOVA (normal distribution) and Kruskal–Wallis test (non-normal 
distribution). Continuous variables with normal distribution were de-
scribed as mean±SD and as median (first and third quartiles: Q1–Q3) 
when distributed non-normally.
We analyzed the effect of peak donor troponin I values on recip-
ient mortality, PGF, and CAV based on 3 different troponin groups 
using unadjusted and adjusted Cox models (adjusting for baseline 
covariates that were different between the troponin I groups and 
also adjusting for other factors known to be associated with recipi-
ent mortality), and reported hazards ratio (HR) with a 95% confi-
dence interval. We also analyzed the effect of peak donor troponin I 
values as a continuous variable on 1-year recipient mortality using 
Cox models. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with log-rank test was 
also performed. The effect of donor troponin on LOS was evaluated 
using Kruskal–Wallis test. All statistical analyses were performed 
with STATA-13 and 2-sided P values of <0.05 were considered 
significant.
Results
Study Cohort
Of the 15 247 adult heart transplants performed in the United 
States from January 2007 to September 2014, 10 943 (71.8%) 
met all the inclusion/exclusion criteria and formed the final 
study cohort (Figure 1). Overall, the median recipient age was 
56 (Q1–Q3: 46–62) years, 25.5% were females, 20.0% were 
black, 36.4% ischemic, 2.9 (0.9–7.9) total months on wait list, 
and 20.0% of recipients were on left ventricular assist devices. 
The median donor age was 29 (22–40) years, median left ven-
tricular ejection fraction was 60% (55–65), and the median 
ischemic time was 3.25 (2.50–3.90) hours (Table 1). The 
median follow-up was 2.2 (1.0–4.1) years.
Heart transplant recipients were divided into 3 groups 
based on their donors’ peak troponin I level: <1 ng/mL 
(n=7812), 1 to 10 ng/mL (n=2770), and >10 ng/mL (n=361). 
Table 1 displays the baseline characteristics of the over-
all recipient cohort and Table 2 displays the different tro-
ponin groups. There were few significant differences in

the recipient characteristics, notably a lower proportion of 
female recipients in the highest troponin group (22.2% ver-
sus 28.8% in highest versus lowest troponin group, P=0.024). 
Importantly, the percentage of patients who were status 1A 
(highest urgency) or on life support (extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation or ventilator) was similar between the 
groups, which does not suggest that organs with elevated 
troponins were selected for sicker recipients.
As described in Table 3, there were many significant dif-
ferences in donor characteristics across troponin groups. As 
expected, the elevated troponin groups had a higher percent-
age of donor cardiopulmonary resuscitation (65.9% versus 
23.8% in the highest and lowest troponin groups, P<0.001) 
and required greater inotropic support (54.0% versus 47.4% 
in the highest and lowest groups, P=0.013). Furthermore, 
the donors with elevated troponins were younger reflecting a 
greater tolerance of risk in a younger donor. Finally, there was 
a clinically nonsignificant reduction in left ventricular ejection 
fraction in the higher troponin groups (60±6% versus 62±7%, 
P<0.001 across groups).
Donor Troponin and Recipient Mortality
The 30-day, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year Kaplan–Meier esti-
mates of recipient survival rates for the entire cohort was 
96.0%, 89.8%, 83.2%, and 77.1%, respectively. The over-
all prevalence of various recipient and donor characteristics 
and their association with 1-year recipient mortality using 
unadjusted Cox models is shown in Table 1. Consistent with 
previous studies,14–16 we found that multiple recipient char-
acteristics but few donor characteristics were associated with 
recipient mortality at 1 year. Most importantly, peak donor 
troponin I levels as a continuous variable was not associated 
with 1-year recipient mortality in both unadjusted Cox (HR, 
0.999; 95% confidence interval, 0.997–1.002; P=0.856; 
Table 1) and after adjustment for all factors associated 
with 1-year mortality (HR, 1.000; 95% confidence interval, 
0.997–1.002; P=0.950).
After dividing the recipients into the 3 different groups, 
compared with heart transplants with donor troponin I levels 
<1 ng/mL, there were no significant differences in recipient 
mortality in the elevated donor troponin I groups 1 to 10 ng/
mL and >10 ng/mL at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years of 
follow-up. These findings remain unchanged in the adjusted 
Cox models (Table 4). Figure 2A shows the Kaplan–Meier 
analysis of recipient survival in the 3 troponin I groups 
(P=0.967 for log-rank test).
Finally, to examine whether the effect of elevated tropo-
nin may have been limited to older donors, we performed an 
age-stratified analysis. There was no significant association 
in any age category (Table I in the Data Supplement).
Donor Troponin and CAV
Information on the presence or absence of CAV was available 
in 8451 recipients, who were included in the CAV analysis. At 
5 years of follow-up, consistent with previous studies, 29.8% 
of recipients were reported to have some degree of CAV.17,18 
Transplant recipients in the elevated troponin groups were not 
at increased risk for CAV when compared with those with a 
donor troponin level <1 ng/mL by the unadjusted and adjusted 
Cox models (Table II in the Data Supplement). Kaplan–Meier 
analysis also demonstrated that development of CAV was sim-
ilar across the groups with ≤5 years of follow-up (P=0.451 for 
log-rank test, Figure 2B).
PGF, LOS, and Donor Troponin
PGF developed in 151 (1.4%) patients within 30 days of trans-
plantation. Compared with recipients with peak donor troponin 
I levels <1 ng/mL, transplant recipients in the elevated donor 
troponin groups were not at increased risk for PGF in unad-
justed (HR, 1.15 [0.80–1.63]; P=0.447 for troponin 1–10 ng/
mL and HR, 0.41 (0.10–1.65); P=0.211 for troponin >10 ng/
mL) and adjusted Cox models (HR, 1.20 [0.83–1.73]; P=0.334 
for troponin 1–10 ng/mL and HR, 0.53 [0.13–2.20]; P=0.389

Finally, we also evaluated the effect of donor troponin on 
post-transplant LOS because it would be expected that post-
operative complications, such as PGF, infection, etc. would 
translate into longer post-transplant LOS. The median LOS 
from transplant to discharge for the overall cohort was 14 (10–
21) days. There was no difference in median LOS across the 
rising troponin groups: <1 ng/mL (14, Q1–Q3: 10–21 days), 
1 to 10 ng/mL (14, Q1–Q3: 10–21 days), and >10 ng/mL (15, 
Q1–Q3: 10–22 days), P=0.539.
Discussion
This analysis of the UNOS database shows that in the set-
ting of preserved cardiac function, there is no significant asso-
ciation between elevated donor troponin I level, a biomarker 
of cardiac injury, and recipient survival for up to 5  years 
post-transplant. Furthermore, PGF and LOS as drivers of 
short-term morbidity, were not affected. In addition, the devel-
opment of CAV, which is the primary cause of late graft failure 
and death after heart transplantation,13 was also not associated 
with elevated troponin levels. To date and to our knowledge, 
this is the largest analysis to show a lack of any prognostic 
value of donor troponin in post-transplant outcomes, and such 
findings suggest that elevated troponin levels in an otherwise 
suitable donor should not preclude acceptance of an organ for 
transplantation.
The troponin complex comprised 3 proteins (troponin C, 
I, and T) critically involved in muscle contraction.19 Troponin 
isoforms specific to cardiac muscle can be measured in the 
serum and have been shown to be released within hours after 
myocardial ischemic injury.20 An initial insult causing tropo-
nin release in the donor, whether it be the adrenergic storm of 
brain death or a cardiac arrest, could potentially be intensified 
by further ischemia during organ storage and transport. For 
these reasons, the value of donor cardiac troponin in organ 
selection has been an ongoing area of investigation. In a piv-
otal study, Potapov et al6 found that donor troponin levels were

 6  Madan et al  Donor Troponin and Heart Transplant Outcomes 
significantly higher in 11 recipients who subsequently devel-
oped impaired graft function when compared with 68 other 
recipients with normal graft function. Other small single-cen-
ter studies have demonstrated an increased need for inotrope 
use post-transplant,21 higher rates of rejection,8 higher rates of 
graft failure, and death in infants.7 In contrast, a more recent 
analysis from the California Transplant Donor Network, found 
no difference in 1-year survival between the 43 recipients of 
an organ with elevated serum troponin compared with the 96 
patients with normal troponin levels. In this study, the major-
ity of patients (77%) had only a modestly elevated troponin I 
of <10 μg/L.4 Given the inconsistency in the evidence to date, 
it is not surprising that many programs decline an organ with 
high troponins.4
Because numerous small studies provide conflicting data, 
the present registry-based analysis was conducted to evaluate 
the effect of an elevated donor troponin on recipient survival. 
Overall, 1- and 5-year survival after heart transplantation were 
89.8% and 77.1%, respectively.14–16 When donor troponin I 
was examined as a continuous variable, there was no asso-
ciation with recipient survival at 1 year even after adjustment 
for confounders. We then divided the cohort into the 3 groups 
based on donor troponin I levels: <1, 1 to 10, and >10 ng/mL. 
These cutoffs were chosen because they reflected the authors’ 
clinical practice and allowed examination of the high troponin 
group (>10 ng/mL) that was not well represented in the recent 
analysis from the California Transplant Donor Network. 
The results showed that even in the presence of significantly 
elevated troponin, there was no association with recipient 
survival up to 5 years of follow-up. Ultimately, this lack of 
association between donor troponin and outcomes is not sur-
prising when considered in the context of mounting evidence 
that most donor factors within practical limits tend to have 
little impact on recipient survival.15
The previous studies on outcomes of donors with elevated 
troponin suggested increased rates of graft failure.6,7 To fur-
ther examine the effect on graft function in a large number 
of patients through the UNOS database, we used a hard defi-
nition of PGF as death or retransplantation within 30 days 
because of graft failure (not related to rejection, infection, 
or surgical complications).11 The results did not show an 
increased risk of PGF in hearts from donors with elevated tro-
ponin. Although the precise reason for these discrepant find-
ings is not clear, it should be noted that all previous analysis 
were limited by small sample size, single-center experience, 
and conducted in a previous era of management.9 This last 
consideration is important because the improvement in sur-
vival during the past 2 to 3 decades after heart transplantation

 7  Madan et al  Donor Troponin and Heart Transplant Outcomes 
is primarily attributed to advancement in the management of 
postoperative complications.1 Therefore, it is possible that 
current postoperative management practices have allowed us 
to overcome any potential short-term risk, elevated troponin 
may have conveyed. Alternatively, as UNOS does not have 
dedicated reporting on PGF, granular detail on the periopera-
tive course such as differences in increased or extended use of 
inotropes and the need for temporary mechanical circulatory 
support after transplant may have been missed. For this rea-
son, we evaluated LOS as a surrogate for the complexity of the 
postoperative course and found it to be comparable across the 
groups. Taken together, similar post-transplant LOS, rates of 
PGF, and 30-day mortality suggest that there is no clinically 
significant difference in the immediate postoperative course of 
high troponin hearts.
In our cohort, the development of CAV at 5 years was 
29.8% which is consistent with previous studies.17,18 Early 
after troponin measurements became clinically available, 
it was suggested that in donor hearts troponin release may 
represent subclinical coronary artery disease that could pro-
vide a substrate for the development of CAV. These concerns 
were not confirmed in a report from the Mayo Clinic of 171 
patients, which found that donor troponin release did not 
increase the risk for CAV.22 Our larger study, further substanti-
ates this report and did not find donor troponin to be a risk fac-
tor for CAV. This is important because CAV and graft failure 
(likely undetected CAV) are the most common causes of death 
in transplant patients who survive the first year.18
This study has several limitations that are mainly because 
of its registry-based analytic design and should be interpreted 
in the context of these limitations. There are many unmeasured 
variables that an experienced clinician incorporates into the 
evaluation of a potential donor that cannot be captured in such 
analysis. Graft failure rates may be underestimated across the 
groups because its occurrence requiring inotropes or mechani-
cal circulatory support is not captured by the UNOS database. 
The UNOS database does not have information on CAV for all 
patients. Transplant recipients with missing or unknown CAV 
status were excluded from the CAV analysis, and whether 
this data would have altered the results is unknown. Only 
intermediate-term survival (up to 5 years post-transplant) was 
evaluated, and thus the effect of elevated donor troponin on 
long-term outcomes (≥10 years) remains unknown. Because 
this is a US-based registry, our findings may not be applicable 
to transplant centers in other countries, where listing practices 
and peritransplant care may be different. The effect of troponin 
from donors aged >55 years was not evaluated as International 
Society for Heart and Lung Transplants (ISHLT) guidelines 
caution against the routine use of hearts from donors >55 years 
of age; and therefore, these findings cannot be extrapolated to 
older donors.12 The median (Q1–Q3) for the high donor tropo-
nin group (>10 ng/mL, n=361) was 18.23 (13.2–32.0) ng/mL.

Of these 361 donors, 42 had troponin levels ≥50 ng/mL and 
15 had troponin ≥100 ng/mL. Thus, we had limited number 
of donor hearts with high donor troponins and as such the 
effect of high donor troponins remains largely unclear. Our 
analysis involved evaluating the effect of peak donor troponin 
levels from hospital admission to organ procurement. As this 
was a registry-based design, we were unable to evaluate the 
effect of changes in troponin levels over time during donor 
management. Furthermore, many troponin I assays are com-
mercially available and whether the variability between these 
may have affected the results could not be assessed. Finally, it 
is unknown how the exclusion of patients from the final study 
cohort (Figure 1) because of lack of adequate data affected the 
results. Despite these limitations, the findings of this study are 
the result of a rigorous analysis, involving a large sample size 
and are notable for their significant clinical implications.
In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that elevated 
 
donor troponin I levels in the setting of normal left ventricular 
 
ejection fraction are not associated with short- or inter-
mediate-term recipient survival, or rates of PGF, or CAV.

Implementation of these findings could help increase the num-
ber of heart transplants performed. We hope these findings are 
incorporated into clinical practice and will stimulate similar 
research that defines safe ranges into which donor recovery 
can be expanded.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Despite a shortage of donor organs in the United States, only 1 in 3 potential donor hearts is accepted for transplantation, 
and the donor acceptance rate has declined during the past decade. Elevated donor troponin levels are considered by many 
as a contraindication to heart transplantation, but the data on this practice are limited. We evaluated the effect of peak donor 
troponin I levels on recipient outcomes using the multicenter United Network of Organ Sharing registry database. We found 
that elevated peak donor troponin levels in the setting of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction were not associated with 
recipient mortality, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, primary graft failure, or post-transplant length of hospital stay. Our study 
supports the concept that elevated donor troponin levels alone should not be considered a contraindication to transplantation, 
in an otherwise suitable donor. These findings should help to safely increase the donor acceptance rate and thus the number 
of heart transplants performed in the United States.
