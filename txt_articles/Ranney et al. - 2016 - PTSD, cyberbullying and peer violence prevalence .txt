Abstract
Objective—Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is often underdiagnosed and undertreated 
among adolescents. The objective of this analysis was to describe the prevalence and correlates of 
symptoms consistent with PTSD among adolescents presenting to an urban emergency department 
(ED).
Method—A cross-sectional survey of adolescents aged 13–17 presenting to the ED for any 
reason was conducted between August 2013 and March 2014. Validated self-report measures were 
used to measure mental health symptoms, violence exposure, and risky behaviors. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis was performed to determine adjusted differences in associations 
between symptoms consistent with PTSD, and predicted correlates.

 Results—Of 353 adolescents, 23.2% reported current symptoms consistent with PTSD, 13.9% 
had moderate or higher depressive symptoms, and 11.3% reported past-year suicidal ideation. 
Adolescents commonly reported physical peer violence (46.5%), cyberbullying (46.7%), and 
exposure to community violence (58.9%). On multivariate logistic regression, physical peer 
violence, cyberbullying victimization, exposure to community violence, female gender, and 
alcohol or other drug use positively correlated with symptoms consistent with PTSD.
Conclusions—Among adolescents presenting to the ED for any reason, symptoms consistent 
with PTSD PTSD, depressive symptoms, physical peer violence, cyberbullying, and community 
violence exposure are common and inter-related. Greater attention to PTSD, both the disorder and 
symptom level, and its co-occurring risk factors is needed.

1. Introduction
Approximately 4% of children and adolescents experience Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
(PTSD)1–3, with higher rates among trauma-exposed adolescents4. PTSD in adolescents has 
been associated with long-term functional impairment5, including poor physical health6, 
academic failure7, and increased medical service utilization8. PTSD is frequently comorbid 
with multiple psychological and behavioral concerns, including depression9–11, suicidal 
ideation10,12,13, and substance use disorders14. Prior PTSD symptoms also increase the 
conditional risk of PTSD after future trauma15–19, emphasizing the importance of early 
PTSD assessment even for those whose symptoms will spontaneously remit20. PTSD, 
despite effective treatment, is currently underdiagnosed, underreported, and undertreated21. 
Large scale adult studies suggest that only half of adults with PTSD seek psychiatric 
treatment, with rates falling as low as one-third in minority adults22. This lack of treatment 
is further compounded among children and adolescents, since parents may fail to recognize 
PTSD symptoms23,24.
The need for early diagnosis and treatment may be highest in adolescents with a history of 
physical peer violence, a population at high risk for future trauma25,26. A history of physical 
peer violence is a strong predictor of PTSD symptoms in adults and adolescents2,3,27,28. 
Cyberbullying is a relatively new form of peer violence, defined as “using electronic means 
to intentionally harm someone else”29. Cyberbullying overlaps with, and may predict 
exposure to, physical peer violence30. Cyberbullying may be more strongly associated with 
suicidal behavior and depression than other forms of peer violence31–34. Its correlation with 
PTSD symptoms has not, to our knowledge, been reported.
Early recognition and treatment of PTSD may alter adolescents’ trajectory of future physical 
and cyber violence, behavioral disorders, and social consequences35,36. Regulatory agencies 
are, correspondingly, increasingly urging standardized evaluation and treatment of PTSD, 
particularly for high-risk adolescents presenting for clinical care37,38. The American College 
of Surgeons guidelines encourage systematic screening for PTSD in trauma centers39. Such 
screening would facilitate both alterations in the immediate care provision – for instance, by 
Ranney et al.

 using a trauma-informed care protocol40; and in the long-term plans for affected individuals, 
by facilitating referral to a collaborative or psychiatric care program41.
Some studies suggest that the emergency department (ED) may be an appropriate location to 
screen adolescents for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders42,43, given the large number of 
high-risk adolescents seen in the ED and the important role of the ED as a liaison to 
community mental health services44. Emergency physicians, however, are currently limited 
in their understanding of the prevalence and impact of PTSD in adolescent ED patients45, 
particularly among patients who are not necessarily presenting in the aftermath of an 
obviously traumatic event. We are aware of only one small study (N=64, 8–21 years of age) 
involving assessment of pre-existing PTSD symptoms in youth presenting to the ED for 
non-injury complaints46. Existing literature on PTSD in adolescent ED patients describes its 
development after an acute assault47–52 or motor vehicle crash53,54. Further elucidation of 
the correlates of PTSD, including prior physical violence and cyberbullying, in adolescent 
ED patients could help improve future efforts at targeted or indicated screening.
1.1 Statement of Purpose
The main aim of this analysis was to describe prevalence and correlates of symptoms 
compatible with PTSD among adolescents presenting to an urban ED for care for any 
reason, focusing on its correlation with known risk factors for PTSD as well as its 
correlation with the novel risk factor of cyberbullying.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Study design, setting, and population
This study represents a cross-sectional analysis of adolescents aged 13–17 presenting for 
care at a Level I trauma center’s pediatric ED. The study site is the primary children’s 
hospital for a Northeastern state, serving approximately 50,000 pediatric patients per year 
with a diverse population (30% Hispanic, 20% African American, 40% publicly insured). 
The administered survey represented a screening assessment for a larger study of 
adolescents presenting to the ED55. Study procedures were approved by the participating 
hospital’s Institutional Review Board.
2.2 Study protocol
We approached a consecutive sample of adolescents aged 13–17 presenting to the ED for 
any reason to take the survey. Trained research assistants recruited eligible participants on a 
convenience sample of shifts, weighted by patient volume, between August 2013 and March 
2014. Inclusion criteria for screening included being medically stable; mentally and 
physically able to consent; English-speaking; and having a parent/guardian present to 
consent. Exclusion criteria included presenting complaints of suicidality, psychosis, sexual 
assault, or child abuse; or being in police or state agency custody. We obtained verbal 
parental/guardian consent and verbal adolescent assent. Participants completed the survey on 
a touch-screen tablet and received a small gift valued at US$2 on completion of the survey.

 2.3 Measures
Primary outcome—Past two-week PTSD symptoms were measured using the Child 
PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS)56, a validated 17-item measure corresponding to clinical 
criteria defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, 
text revision (DSM-IV-TR)57. A cutoff score of 11 or higher was used to define presence of 
PTSD symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD (hereafter referred to as 
“PTSD”), in accordance with previous studies in which this cutoff has a sensitivity of 95% 
and specificity of 96% for this disorder56.
Other mental health symptoms—Past two-week depressive symptoms were measured 
using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)58, a 9-item measure which corresponds to 
clinical criteria defined by the DSM-IV-TR. A cutoff score of 10 or higher was used to 
define presence of moderate-or-higher depressive symptoms, in concordance with clinical 
recommendations58. For adolescents, a score of 10 or higher has a sensitivity of 89.5% and 
specificity of 77.5% for major depressive disorder59,60. Suicidal ideation was measured 
using two items from the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)61, and one item from 
the PHQ-958. Suicide attempts were measured using one item from the 2013 YRBS (kappa 
0.61–1.00)62.
Past-year violence—Past-year physical peer violence (victimization and perpetration) 
was measured using a 14-item modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale-2nd edition 
(CTS-2)63, as used by other studies on youth peer violence64–66. Previous studies report 
Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.79–0.9563; this study’s Cronbach’s α was 0.87. High overlap 
between physical violence perpetration and physical violence victimization in this sample 
(83% of youth reporting physical perpetration also reported victimization; Pearson’s r=0.65) 
was observed; and prior literature indicates strong correlation between victimization and 
perpetration in adolescent samples.67 However, given that there is limited theoretical 
justification for physical violence perpetration being correlated with PTSD, the physical 
peer violence variables were maintained as separate “perpetration” and “victimization” 
variables for analytic purposes. Past-year experience with cyberbullying was measured using 
a modified 2-item version of the Student School Survey68. As prior evidence69, as well as 
our own data (see results section below), indicates that cyberbullying perpetrators and 
victims had separate characteristics, we maintained a separation between cyberbullying 
perpetrators and cyberbullying victims in the analysis. Past-year exposure to community 
violence was measured using the NIMH Community Violence Questionnaire70, a 7-item 
construct to measure exposure to acts of crime and violence in one’s community. Exposure 
to community violence was defined as a positive answer to any question.
Substance Use—Past-year risky behaviors were measured using a 3-item version of the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse-Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Screening 
Test (ASSIST) Quick Screen to measure alcohol, prescription drug, and other illegal drug 
use71. Given observed correlations between alcohol and drug use in our sample, as well as 
extant empirical and theoretical support for the overlap of alcohol and drug use72, these 
variables were collapsed for the purpose of analysis.

 Past-year healthcare utilization—We measured primary care provider utilization and 
the number of past-year ED visits using a modified 3-item version of the Substance Abuse 
Outcomes Module73. The chief complaint for the current visit (abstracted from the medical 
record by the research assistant) was categorized into three groups by a medical 
professional: injury (e.g. fall, sprain, concussion), medical (e.g., asthma, nausea, headache), 
and psychiatric (e.g. depression, panic attack). We measured usage of inpatient and 
outpatient mental health resources using two items from the Child and Adolescent Services 
Assessment74.
Demographics—We assessed age, gender, race, ethnicity, living with biological parents, 
and having children using measures from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health (AdHealth)75. We measured sexual orientation using the Gender-Related Measures 
Overview76. Socioeconomic status was measured using previously validated questions from 
Shope et al.77 as used in prior studies78. We calculated, for analysis purposes, mean age and 
standard deviation; we collapsed race into White versus non-White; ethnicity into Hispanic 
versus non-Hispanic; sexual orientation into straight versus not straight; whether they lived 
with biological parent(s) or not; whether they had children of their own or not; and receiving 
public assistance as a positive answer to either “does [your parent/guardian] receive public 
assistance (welfare, food stamps, disability benefits, Medicaid, Medicare)” or “do you 
qualify for free or reduced lunches from school”.
2.4 Data Analysis
We performed statistical analyses with STATA 1379. We developed descriptive statistics to 
describe the distribution of the variables. We calculated odds ratios (OR) to obtain estimates 
of association between PTSD and independent variables. We conducted tests of bivariate 
association to identify appropriate covariates. We then performed multivariate logistic 
regression analysis to determine adjusted differences in associations between PTSD and 
independent variables. We retained independent variables in the final model based on 
theory, significance in bivariate analysis, and lack of collinearity (determined by goodness-
of-fit and Pearson’s correlation coefficients, as appropriate)80. We assessed the goodness-of-
fit of the final model using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test80.
3. Results
Of 501 patients eligible for the study during recruitment hours, 70.3% (n=353) consented 
and completed the survey. The mean age of participants was 15.1 (SD 1.38), with slightly 
more than half female. Approximately half reported that they were White (53.8%), and one-
third self-reported Hispanic ethnicity (33.7%). Approximately half (53.5%) reported that 
their family received public assistance. Participants’ chief complaints were 28% (n=98) 
injury, 68% (n=240) medical, and 4% (n=14) psychiatric [by definition, excluding acute 
suicidal ideation, psychosis, and intoxication]. Most study participants (80.5%) had a 
primary care provider. This demographic distribution mirrors that of all adolescents seen in 
this ED.
One-quarter of participants (n=82, 23.2%) had a CPSS score of 11 or higher, corresponding 
to the accepted cutoff for suggesting a PTSD diagnosis [mean CPSS 7.2, range 0–48, SD

 8.7]. Other related mental health symptoms were also common among this sample. Almost 
14% had a PHQ-9 score of 10 or above (corresponding to moderate or higher depression) 
[mean PHQ-9 4.5, range 0–27, SD 4.9], and 11.3% reported past-year suicidal ideation. 
Depressive symptoms were strongly correlated with PTSD, with a Pearson’s r of 0.82. 
Approximately one-quarter reported any past-year alcohol or drug use. Only 23.2% had seen 
a mental health provider in an outpatient setting, and 7.4% reported a mental health-related 
hospitalization in the past year.
Almost half of the participants reported past-year physical peer violence, as either a 
perpetrator or victim (46.5%). Almost half reported engagement in cyberbullying as either a 
perpetrator or victim (46.7%), with 39% reporting cyberbullying victimization and 25% 
reporting cyberbullying perpetration. The correlations between cyberbullying experiences 
and physical violence were modest (Pearson’s r=0.24). Almost two-thirds of the sample 
reported witnessing violence in their community (58.9%). See Table 1 for details.
On bivariate analysis, the only demographic variable that was significantly associated with 
self-reported PTSD symptomatology was receiving public assistance. Neither the reason for 
the index ED visit (e.g. injury, medical, or psychiatric) nor the number of past-year ED visits 
correlated with current PTSD. Depressive symptoms, suicidality, all forms of violence 
exposure, and all forms of alcohol and other drug use correlated strongly with PTSD. (See 
Table 2) PTSD was most common in adolescents who reported both cyberbullying 
victimization and peer violence (n=41, 50% of PTSD-positive sample); lower rates were 
observed in those reporting just cyberbullying victimization (n=9, 10% of PTSD-positive 
sample) or just peer violence (n=18, 22% of PTSD-positive sample). Participants reporting 
PTSD were significantly more likely to have received inpatient or outpatient mental health 
treatment in the past year, although rates of treatment were still low.
Given the theoretical overlap between depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide 
attempts, as well as the observed collinearity of these symptom complexes with the 
dependent variable, we excluded depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide 
attempt variables from the multivariate model. We excluded physical violence perpetration 
and cyberbullying perpetration from the model due to theoretical concerns as well as 
negative impact of these two variables on the model’s goodness of fit; no major directional 
changes in the results were observed with or without these perpetration-related variables.
The final multivariate logistic regression model (Table 3) (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-
fit = 0.96) found that physical peer victimization, cyberbullying victimization, exposure to 
violence in the community, and past-year alcohol and other drug use were all significantly 
correlated with higher likelihood of PTSD. Male gender correlated with slightly lower rates 
of PTSD.
4. Discussion
Nearly one-quarter of adolescents presenting to the ED for care for any reason report 
symptoms compatible with pre-existing PTSD, based on a validated screen cutoff score. The 
prevalence of PTSD among this ED sample is higher than among national community-based

 samples (1–5%)1,81; among samples of only trauma-exposed youth (14–16%)4,82; or among 
samples of youth with a history of unintentional injury (4%–7%)83,84; and is nearly as high 
as has been reported in samples of adolescents recruited from psychiatric settings (25%)85.
We found striking rates—nearly 1 in 2 adolescents—of past-year physical peer violence and 
past-year cyberbullying. Both physical violence and cyber-victimization were strongly 
associated with current PTSD in our sample. Recent school-based studies have reported U.S. 
cyberbullying rates of 15–16%33,86,87 (ranging from 6–35% internationally)88, and physical 
peer violence rates of approximately 25%87, using similar measures. The high prevalence of 
both physical and cyber-violence in our ED population is concerning, particularly since they 
were so strongly associated with PTSD in this sample. Efforts to characterize the prevalence 
and effects of cyber-victimization have not kept pace with the rapid adoption and pace of 
technology use among adolescents. The present research supports the widespread and 
deleterious nature of cyberbullying in adolescents presenting to the ED and could be 
considered as part of future health care based violence prevention programs.
We found a high rate of PTSD among youth presenting to the ED for any chief complaint. 
The odds of current PTSD did not differ for adolescents with different categories of chief 
complaints. Evidence from prior research suggests that healthcare providers can and should 
assess risk of PTSD development in the acute post-injury period44,84,89,90. This study 
suggests, however, that provider sensitivity to pre-existing PTSD symptoms may be 
indicated for all adolescent ED patients. Recurrent trauma is likely to exacerbate prior 
symptoms2. The prevalence of new trauma increases during late adolescence (approximately 
ages 17–21) relative to other stages of the life course, such that the studied population is at 
future risk91–93. Moreover, adolescents’ definition of a “traumatic” event may not relate to 
medical severity of an incident94,95, particularly for adolescents with a history of physical 
peer violence96. High-risk adolescents may interpret the mere need for emergency medical 
treatment as “traumatic”. Trauma-informed care may be helpful in reducing future 
traumatization of already-symptomatic youth in the ED40,97.
We found that PTSD correlated strongly with both current depressive symptoms (50% of the 
PTSD-positive sample) and past-year suicidality (38% of the PTSD-positive sample). This 
co-morbidity is supported by other literature98,99. Yet, a critical finding of our investigation 
is that only 50% of the sample with PTSD reported receiving any form of past-year 
outpatient mental health care. Screening for symptoms of PTSD, depression, and suicidality 
in this high risk adolescent ED population may enhance linkages to treatment resources for 
children and families who are otherwise unconnected to the mental health system. It may, 
thereby, reduce the incidence of both chronic PTSD and other concurrent behavioral 
disorders44,100. Future work could address the best way to implement screening and 
indicated referrals in the ED setting101,102.
Prior studies suggest that PTSD may act as a mediator between physical violence and 
depressive symptoms10. In this cross-sectional study, we are unable to assess the directional 
relationship between these three symptom complexes. However, given the high rates of 
physical violence, PTSD, and depressive symptoms in our population, the high correlation 
between PTSD and past-year physical peer violence on our regression analysis, and the

 known bi-directional nature between physical peer violence and depression26, our study 
suggests that assessments of mental health should be part of standard care for adolescent 
victims of peer physical assault; and vice versa. Further investigation is warranted as to the 
underlying psychological and physiological connections between violence, depressive 
symptoms, and PTSD.
Provocatively, our study also shows that the combination of cyberbullying victimization and 
physical peer violence is associated with increased odds of PTSD over either form of 
violence in isolation. Prior work establishes that both in-person bullying and physical 
violence are associated with adolescent PTSD symptoms103–106. Cyberbullying has been 
shown to have stronger associations with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than in-
person bullying107. This study shows that cyberbullying – particularly cyberbullying 
victimization – correlates strongly with PTSD as well, particularly when combined with 
physical violence. Although the direction of the relationship is unclear, further research on 
this association is warranted. Future work should use more granular measures of 
cyberbullying victimization and perpetration, including frequency and type.
The high correlation between PTSD and past-year substance use corresponds with our other 
work52. Although most adolescents are resilient to childhood trauma, some develop difficult 
behavioral symptoms complexes108. Indeed, treatment research suggests that reduction of 
PTSD symptoms may precipitate improvements in substance use behaviors109,110. Moving 
forward, efforts to better identify PTSD in ED settings should include populations 
presenting with substance related concerns.
Prior work suggests an association between low socioeconomic status and PTSD 
symptoms.96 In our study, this association disappeared when adjusting for violence 
exposure. Community and physical violence are more common in low socio-economic 
neighborhoods.111 Disentanglement of this complex relationship is needed.
Limitations of this study include use of a self-report screening measure for posttraumatic 
stress symptomatology, not a diagnostic interview for PTSD. The incidence of PTSD may 
therefore be over- or under- reported. Additionally, it is possible that youth may be over-
reporting PTSD symptoms and exposure to trauma in the context of the distress associated 
with an ED visit. However, prior studies have shown that meeting partial criteria for PTSD 
also correlates with long-term impairment, suicidality, and other comorbid disorders112,113. 
A second limitation is our cross-sectional study design. We are unable to conclude whether 
PTSD pre-date peer violence (both physical and cyber) or vice versa. Third, this study was 
conducted at a single, large, urban pediatric ED during a convenience sample of shifts. 
Despite our relatively high response rate for a clinical survey, our results may not be 
generalizable to other settings, and levels of physical violence and community violence may 
be higher than elsewhere. Despite the similarities between our population’s demographics 
and that of the ED as a whole, it is possible that non-respondents differ in important ways 
from respondents. Finally, due to IRB concerns, we excluded adolescents presenting without 
a parent or guardian, or with suicidality or psychosis as a presenting complaint. This 
limitation would likely result in a bias toward the null in our study, as adolescents who do

 not live with their biological parent and who have other mental health disorders are more 
likely to have PTSD2.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, among youth presenting to the ED for care for any reason, one quarter of 
adolescents report current symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of PTSD, half report past-
year physical peer violence, and half report past-year cyberbullying. PTSD was strongly 
associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality, and correlated significantly with a 
variety of other risk exposures including cyberbullying victimization, physical peer 
violence, community violence exposure, and substance use. The minority of patients with 
PTSD reported receiving any mental health care in the past year. As PTSD is well known to 
impact adolescents’ long-term quality of life, and is unlikely to improve without treatment, 
greater attention to this disorder and its co-occurring risk factors among ED patients is 
warranted.
