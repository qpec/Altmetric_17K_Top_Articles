Background-—Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases;
however, the impact of SDB on long-term outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome has not been fully evaluated.
Methods and Results-—We performed overnight cardiorespiratory monitoring of 241 patients with acute coronary syndrome who
were successfully treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention between January 2005 and December 2008. The
presence of SDB was defined as apnea–hypopnea index ≥5 events per hour. The end point was incidence of major adverse
cardiocerebrovascular events, defined as a composite of all-cause death, recurrence of acute coronary syndrome, nonfatal stroke,
and hospital admission for congestive heart failure. Patients were followed for a median period of 5.6 years. Among the 241
patients who were finally enrolled, comorbidity of SDB with acute coronary syndrome was found in 126 patients (52.3%). The
cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiocerebrovascular events was significantly higher in patients with SDB than in those
without SDB (21.4% versus 7.8%, P=0.006). Multivariable analysis revealed that the presence of SDB was a significant predictor of
major adverse cardiocerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 2.28, 95% CI 1.06–4.92; P=0.035).
Conclusions-—The study’s results showed that the presence of SDB among patients with acute coronary syndrome following
primary percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with a higher incidence of major adverse cardiocerebrovascular events
during long-term follow-up. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003270 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003270)

S
leep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been recognized as
an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.1
SDB may develop or worsen cardiovascular disease through
intermittent hypoxia, increased oxidative stress, sympathetic
overactivation, endothelial dysfunction, and activated inflam-
matory response.1 Nevertheless, based on the results of an
epidemiological study,2 the specific relationship between SDB
and development of coronary artery disease (CAD) remains
controversial.
Conversely, several studies have shown a more obvious
relationship between SDBandclinical outcomesinpatients with
CAD.3–7 Among patients with CAD, those with acute coronary
syndrome(ACS)generallyhavehighermortalitythanpatientswith
stable angina; moreover, prognosis following ACS remains poor
despite therapeutic advances including percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI).8,9 Consequently, it is important to identify
factors that might contribute to worsening of clinical outcomes in
patientswithACS.AlthoughafewstudieshavesuggestedthatSDB
is such a factor,5,7 the relationship between SDB and long-term
clinical outcomes following ACS has not been fully evaluated.
Through this study, we aimed to test our hypothesis that SDB is
associated with poor long-term clinical outcome following ACS.

 2005 and December 2008 were included in the present study.
ACS includes acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (STEMI), non-STEMI, and unstable angina.10,11 The
exclusion criteria were cardiac surgery during the previous
4 weeks, end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, cere-
brovascular disease with neurological deficits, life-threatening
malignancy, obstructive lung disease, and treated SDB. This
study was approved by the ethics committee of Kokura
Memorial Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all
patients.
Initial PCI Procedure
All initial PCI procedures were performed using standard
techniques. Pre- and postdilatation and selection of stent type
were left to the operator’s discretion. A bare metal stent was
implanted in all patients. All patients were asked to continue
aspirin (81–162 mg daily) unless there were contraindica-
tions. Ticlopidine (200 mg daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg daily)
was prescribed for at least 1 month after implantation of the
bare metal stent.
Sleep Study
All patients underwent an overnight sleep study �1 week
after the onset of ACS during hospitalization, using a
portable
cardiorespiratory
monitoring
device
(Pulsleep
LS100; Fukuda Denshi Co, Ltd) that was equipped with a
pressure sensor for monitoring airflow and snoring and a
finger pulse oximeter for determining arterial oxyhemoglobin
saturation (SaO2).12 In this study, apnea was defined as
cessation of airflow for ≥10 seconds, and hypopnea was
defined as a 50% reduction in airflow associated with ≥4%
desaturation.
All
recordings
were
scored
manually
by
experienced technicians, and the duration of sleep was
estimated
using
the
self-reported
sleep
duration
and
recorded data, as reported previously.13–15 In the present
study, the presence of SDB was defined as frequency of
apneas and hypopneas (ie, apnea–hypopnea index [AHI])
≥5 events per hour.
Definition of Risk Factors and Other Variables
Hypertension was defined as the current use of antihyper-
tensive
medications
and/or
systolic
blood
pressure
>140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg,
measured on 3 different occasions. Diabetes mellitus was
defined as the current use of insulin and/or oral antidiabetic
medications or a fasting blood glucose level ≥126 mg/dL.
Dyslipidemia was defined as the current use of cholesterol-
lowering medications and/or serum low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level >140 mg/dL and/or serum high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
level
<40 mg/dL
and/or
serum
triglyceride level ≥150 mg/dL. With respect to a smoking
habit, participants were classified as current smokers. The
estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation.16 Left
ventricular
ejection
fraction
(LVEF)
was
assessed
by
echocardiography.
Outcome Data
The follow-up period was considered to be the period from the
day that the sleep study was performed to May 31, 2014.
Follow-up data were obtained by reviewing the medical
records of our hospital or by contacting the patients, family
members, or family physicians by telephone calls. In the
present study, the end point was incidence of major adverse
cardiocerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as a compos-
ite of all-cause death, recurrence of ACS, nonfatal stroke, and
hospital admission for congestive heart failure (CHF). Accord-
ing to established guidelines,10,11 recurrence of ACS was
defined as recurrence of STEMI, non-STEMI, or unstable
angina. Stroke included ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic
stroke, cases of which were verified by neurologists. Hospital
admission for CHF was defined as the first unscheduled
admission to the cardiology ward owing to progressive
symptomatic and/or hemodynamic deterioration requiring
intravenous drug treatment.17,18
Statistical Analysis
Data
were
presented
as
values
and
percentages
and
mean�SD or median and interquartile range. The SDB and
no-SDB groups were compared using the unpaired Student t
test or Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and
using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical
variables, as appropriate. Cumulative event-free survival was
estimated according to the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-
rank test was used to compare cumulative event-free survival
curves of SDB and no-SDB groups. P values for log-rank trend
tests were also estimated in the analysis using AHI quartiles.
In addition, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses
were performed to assess the relationship between SDB and
MACCE in the entire study group and in matched patients
based on propensity score (PS). P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed
with JMP 10 software (SAS Institute) and SPSS software (IBM
Corp).
Survival analyses in the entire study group
For the entire study group, univariate and multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. On
univariate analysis, the presence of SDB was used as an

 independent variable along with the following variables: age,
sex, body mass index, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes
mellitus, current smokers, estimated glomerular filtration rate,
type of ACS, culprit vessel, LVEF, medications (antiplatelet
agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angio-
tensin receptor blockers, b-blockers, calcium channel block-
ers, statins, oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin injection),
sleep duration, and mean and minimum SaO2. Variables that
showed P<0.10 on univariate analysis were entered into a
multivariable forward stepwise (P<0.05 for entering and
excluding) Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
Because distributions of estimated glomerular filtration rate
and sleep duration were skewed, those variables were
entered into a proportional hazards model with natural log
transformation. To determine whether the results differed
with the cutoff points, we performed the following additional
analyses. First, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each
quartile of AHI values were computed using the lowest
quintile as the reference group in another multivariable Cox
proportional hazards model including variables that showed
P<0.10
on
univariate
analysis.
Second,
in
a
separate
multivariable model, the test for determining trends in the
HR by the AHI quartiles was conducted by assigning an
ordinal value to each quartile. Finally, in another separate
multivariable model, AHI was treated as a natural logarithm-
transformed continuous variable. The assumption of propor-
tional hazards was assessed using a log-minus-log survival
graph.
Survival analyses in matched patients based on PS
Because there were substantial differences in baseline
characteristics between the SDB and no-SDB groups, a PS
was used to account for this predisposition bias. Propensity
analysis aims to identify patients with similar probabilities of
having SDB on the basis of observed clinical characteristics.
We used nonparsimonious multivariable logistic regression
models to estimate PS and included all baseline character-
istics and sleep duration as covariates in the model. On the
basis of such logistic regression results, a PS was estimated
for each patient. To evaluate the discriminatory power of the
logistic regression model for the PS, the area under the
receiver
operating
characteristic
curve
(c-statistic)
was
calculated. To assess PS effectiveness, the prevalence of
SDB and incident MACCE according to the quartile of the PS
was also assessed.
To match patients in the SDB group and those in the no-
SDB group, we computed the logit of the estimated PS for
each patient. Next, we used a greedy matching algorithm to
match patients using calipers that were defined to have a
maximum width of 0.2 SD of the logit of the estimated PS. To
determine
whether
PS
matching
produced
balanced
distributions of baseline characteristics across the SDB and
no-SDB groups, we compared the balance of baseline
covariates between the 2 groups before and after matching
by using absolute standardized differences that described the
observational selection bias in the means or proportions of
covariates across 2 groups and expressed these values as
percentages of the pooled SD. Absolute standardized differ-
ences of <10% suggest substantial balance across groups.
Cox proportional hazards regression stratified on the matched
pairs was used to estimate the association of SDB with
MACCE in matched patients, accounting for the matched-pair
nature of the sample.
Subgroup analysis
To assess the effect modification by each risk factor on
relationships between SDB and MACCE, we conducted
subgroup analyses using matched patients. Subgroup char-
acteristics included presence or absence of hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, current smoking, estimated
glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and LVEF
<50%. We formally tested for first-order interactions using
multivariable Cox proportional hazards models by entering
interaction terms between SDB and the above-mentioned
subgroup variables. We also showed the effect of SDB on
MACCE in each subgroup.
Results
Characteristics of Patients in the Entire Study
Group
Among 257 ACS patients who underwent a sleep study, 13
patients with insufficient sleep study data and 3 patients in
whom continuous positive airway pressure therapy was
initiated were excluded. Finally, 241 patients were included.
Among them, 209 patients had acute myocardial infarction
and 32 patients had unstable angina. Procedural success of
PCI was achieved in all patients. There were no major PCI-
related complications, and no recurrence of angina was
observed during the index hospital stay. There were 126
patients who had SDB, and 115 patients who had no SDB. The
baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in
Table 1. There were no significant differences between the
SDB and no-SDB groups except for greater body mass index,
worse Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow before PCI,
and lower LVEF in the SDB group.
PS and Matching Based on PS

used to derive the PS was confirmed on the basis of the area

 under the receiver operating characteristics curve (0.71). The
3 thresholds used to determine the quartiles of the PS were
0.574, 0.708, and 0.793. Prevalence of SDB within the 4 PS
quartiles was 12.7%, 23.0%, 27.8%, and 36.5%, respectively.
MACCE rate according to the quartiles of the PS were 15.0%,
13.3%, 13.1%, and 18.3%, respectively. These data suggest
that if the prevalence of SDB is high, the probability of
incident MACCE is high.
PS matching resulted in the creation of 88 matched
pairs of patients in the SDB and no-SDB groups. For 38
patients
in
the
SDB
group,
no
suitable
control
was
identified. This resulted in elimination of 38 patients in
the SDB group and 27 patients in the no-SDB group from
the matched analysis. Before matching, the mean PS for
patients with SDB was 0.734 (95% CI 0.711–0.757) and
that for patients without SDB was 0.625 (95% CI 0.595–
0.654; P<0.001). After matching, the mean PS for patients
with SDB was 0.683 (95% CI 0.656–0.709) and that for
those
without
SDB
was
0.677
(95%
CI
0.648–0.685;
P=0.943 for 2-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, which did
not identify evidence that the 2 distributions of PS were
different
from
each
other).

characteristics
of
matched patients are shown in Table 2. PS matching
reduced the standardized difference for all variables to an
absolute value <10% (Figure 1).
Sleep Study Data
In the entire study group, participants underwent an overnight
sleep study at a median of 6 days (interquartile range 2) from
ACS onset. The AHI ranged from 0.1 to 51.3. Although sleep

values (13.5 [15.3] versus 2.1 [2.2] events per hour,
P<0.001) (Figure 2) than those without SDB.
In matched patients, sleep duration and mean SaO2 were
similar between the 2 groups (508 [65.0] minutes and
95.9�1.3% in the SDB group and 516 [60] minutes and
95.1�2.3% in the no-SDB group, P=0.747 and P=0.109,
respectively), whereas the minimum SaO2 was significantly
lower in the SDB group than in the no-SDB group (82.5�7.6%
in the SDB group and 85.6�8.5% in the no-SDB group,
P<0.001). Patients with SDB had higher AHI values (12.4
[14.1] versus 2.0 [2.4] events per hour, P<0.001) than those
without SDB.
Outcomes
During the median follow-up of 5.6 years (interquartile range
2.8 years), 27 patients (21.4%) in the SDB group and 9
patients (7.8%) in the no-SDB group had MACCE. Details of
MACCE in the entire study group are shown in Table 3.
In the entire study group, cumulative event-free survival
was significantly lower in patients with SDB than in those
without SDB (Figure 3). On univariate Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis, age (per 1-year increment; HR
1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07; P=0.014), current smokers (HR 1.96,

increment; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–1.00; P=0.057), minimum
SaO2 (per 1% increment; HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.99;
P=0.022), use of b-blockers (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.91–3.49;
P=0.094), use of statins (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24–0.93;
P=0.030), and the presence of SDB (HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.29–
5.82; P=0.009) showed values with P<0.1 and were included
in the multivariable analysis. The final multivariable stepwise
regression model is shown in Table 4. In the multivariable
analysis, presence of SDB was a significant predictor for
MACCE along with increase in age, decrease in LVEF and
mean SaO2, absence of b-blocker treatment, and absence of
statin treatment. The results of additional analyses in which
AHI quartiles were compared with the test of trends in the HR
by AHI quartiles and in which AHI was treated as a natural
logarithm-transformed continuous variable indicated that the
greater the AHI, the greater the risk of MACCE (Figures 4 and
5).
Among matched patients, the presence of SDB was
significantly associated with an increase in MACCE (Figure 6).
Risk of MACCE was also significantly greater in the SDB group

and any subgroups (Figure 7).
Discussion
Our study resulted in 2 important observations. First, we
found that the presence of SDB was associated with poor
long-term outcomes in ACS patients following primary PCI,
consistent with previous reports in which only patients with
stable CAD were enrolled3,4,6 or short-term outcomes were

 investigated in ACS patients following PCI.5,7 This association
was confirmed by several separate analytical techniques:
conventional multivariable analysis using the presence or
absence of SDB, multivariable analysis using AHI quartiles or
logarithm-transformed AHI instead of presence or absence of
SDB, and comparisons using matched patients based on PS.
Consistent results in all analyses would further support the
plausibility of the finding. Furthermore, results of tests for
subgroup–SDB effect interaction suggested that the SDB
effect on MACCE was not different across subgroups. Second,
we found that the AHI determined by this particular
cardiorespiratory monitoring device can be a predictor for
long-term clinical outcomes. These findings provide insights
into the clinical significance of SDB and perhaps its role in the
treatment of ACS patients following primary PCI.
In previous studies, SDB has been shown to be associated
with poor prognosis in patients with stable CAD.3,4,6 As shown
previously by Peker and colleagues, untreated SDB is
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality
in patients with CAD.3 Mooe and colleagues reported that
SDB is associated with worse prognosis in patients with CAD,
and there is an independent association with cerebrovascular
events.4 Valham and colleagues also reported that SDB is
significantly associated with the risk of stroke among patients
with CAD.6 In all of these reports, however, patients had
stable CAD, and PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting were
not performed for all patients, possibly affecting the results. In
contrast, Yumino and colleagues reported the adverse effect
of SDB (defined as AHI ≥10 events per hour) on clinical
outcomes following PCI in patients with ACS.5 In their report,
clinical outcomes included target vessel revascularization
(TVR), and in fact, TVR was the most common adverse clinical
outcome; however, the relatively short follow-up period
(�8 months) might have resulted in lower incidence of
adverse events other than TVR. In the present study, we did
not include TVR in MACCE because in-stent restenosis may be
caused partly by technical issues and performed mainly on
the occasion of planned follow-up angiography in the bare
metal stent era. Lee and colleagues recently reported that
42% of the patients admitted with STEMI had severe SDB (ie,
AHI ≥30 events per hour) that was associated with a worse
event-free survival rate at 18-month follow-up.7 Their study
also included TVR in adverse events, and only patients with
STEMI were enrolled. To the best of our knowledge, the
present study is the first to show a negative impact of SDB on
long-term (>5 years) clinical outcomes other than TVR in ACS
patients following PCI.
In terms of specific causes of MACCE, hospital admission
for CHF was the most common cause of MACCE in the
present study. Patients with reduced LVEF in association with

SDB and Long-Term Outcome in ACS

 myocardial infarction might have contributed to the increased
risk of CHF development in patients with SDB. Nakashima and
colleagues reported that SDB showed negative effects on the
recovery of left ventricular systolic function in patients with
acute myocardial infarction.19 The infarct size is an important
prognostic factor of left ventricular remodeling following heart
failure after acute myocardial infarction. Recently, primary PCI
for patients with ACS has become common and contributes
substantially to reducing infarct size; however, the manage-
ment of patients with ACS after PCI has not been fully
examined for the purpose of reducing infarct size. Buchner
and colleagues reported that SDB caused a larger infarct area
and impaired healing after PCI in patients with acute
myocardial infarction.20 This could be a potential mechanism
in the association between the presence of SDB and poor
long-term clinical outcomes, especially an increased risk of
hospital admission for CHF. In the study by Cassar and
colleagues,21 following PCI, CAD patients with properly
treated SDB showed lower incidence of cardiac death than
those who had not received SDB treatment; this suggested a
cause-and-effect relationship between SDB and poor clinical
outcomes in patients with CAD. Consequently, randomized
controlled studies regarding the effects of SDB treatment on
clinical outcomes are warranted.
It appears that detecting SDB should be included into the
routine clinical care of hospitalized patients following ACS
events and primary PCI. In previous studies, the impact of
SDB on short-term clinical outcomes was investigated based
on the results from various portable cardiorespiratory mon-
itoring devices with different cutoff levels of AHI.5,7 In the
present study, another portable cardiorespiratory monitoring
device was used to determine presence of SDB. Based on this
device, AHI ≥5 events per hour could predict long-term
clinical outcomes, which included patients with even milder
SDB than previous studies.5,7 These results may suggest that
more severe SDB can affect early clinical events mainly
related to vasculatures (ie, TVR) and that late clinical events
related to myocardium or hemodynamics (ie, CHF) can be
predicted by even milder SDB. Conversely, such differences in
the cutoff level of AHI might be explained simply by the
difference in the types of devices. Nevertheless, because of
the limited awareness of SDB among cardiologists caring for
hospitalized patients following ACS and limited access to and
the relatively high cost of in-laboratory polysomnography, only

 a minority of ACS patients benefit from the identification of
SDB. It should be noted that portable cardiorespiratory
monitoring, which provides a readily available and inexpensive
means of detecting SDB, has a prognostic impact on long-
term clinical outcomes.
This study has certain limitations. First, SDB was detected
using cardiorespiratory monitoring rather than fully equipped
polysomnography; however, as noted, it may not be feasible for
all hospitalized patients to undergo fully equipped polysomnog-
raphy following ACS and primary PCI. In the present study, we
specifically evaluated whether we could identify patients at high
risk for the incidence of MACCE by using a simple modality for
determining the long-term clinical outcome, as we need a
simple, inexpensive, feasible, and sensitive and specific tool for
identifying SDB, even in this patient population, and for
identification of risk factors by cardiologists themselves and
not by other specialists (eg, sleep or respiratory specialists).
Duration of sleep was estimated using self-reported sleep
duration, and this might lead to underestimation of the AHI as a
consequence of overestimating actual sleeping time. Second,
the present study is a single-center observational study, and
both the sample size and the number of outcome events are
relatively small. The present study, however, would be the first
study investigating the impact of SDB on long-term outcomes
and includes the largest sample of ACS patients with primary
PCI. Third, even though we performed multivariable analyses
and analysis using matched patients based on PS, other
unknown confounders might have affected the analysis.
Furthermore, in the present study, drug-eluting stents were
not used, and bare metal stents were implanted for all patients.
Consequently, it is difficult to determine whether the use of
drug-eluting stents could have improved the results in the
recent era of PCI. Further investigation is needed to clarify
whether the presence of SDB will affect the long-term clinical
outcomes in the drug-eluting stent era.
In
conclusion,
the
present
study
showed
that
the
presence of SDB among ACS patients following primary
PCI is associated with a higher incidence of MACCE,
especially the incidence of CHF events, during long-term
follow-up periods. Randomized clinical trials investigating
whether specific treatment for coexisting SDB in ACS
patients following PCI would cause an improvement in
clinical outcomes will provide further information regarding
the importance of detecting SDB in patients following ACS
and PCI.
