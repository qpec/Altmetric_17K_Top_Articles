Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue. In an effort to minimize this threat to 
astronauts, who may be immunocompromised and thus at a greater risk of infection from antimicrobial 
resistant pathogens, a comprehensive study of the ISS “resistome’ was conducted. Using whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) and disc diffusion antibiotic resistance assays, 9 biosafety level 2 organisms 
isolated from the ISS were assessed for their antibiotic resistance. Molecular analysis of AMR genes 
from 24 surface samples collected from the ISS during 3 different sampling events over a span of a year 
were analyzed with Ion AmpliSeq™ and metagenomics. Disc diffusion assays showed that Enterobacter 
bugandensis strains were resistant to all 9 antibiotics tested and Staphylococcus haemolyticus being 
resistant to none. Ion AmpliSeq™ revealed that 123 AMR genes were found, with those responsible for 
beta-lactam and trimethoprim resistance being the most abundant and widespread. Using a variety 
of methods, the genes involved in antimicrobial resistance have been examined for the first time from 
the ISS. This information could lead to mitigation strategies to maintain astronaut health during long 
duration space missions when return to Earth for treatment is not possible.
The International Space Station (ISS) is not a sterile environment. Microbial monitoring of air and surfaces have 
shown that many different microbes exist in this closed, harsh environment, some of which are opportunistic 
pathogens of human origin1–4. The presence of such microorganisms within this environment poses a serious risk 
to crew health, as opportunistic pathogens have shown increased virulence while grown in space and prolonged 
spaceflight weakens an astronaut’s immune system, rendering him/her more susceptible to infection5. Some 
human associated opportunistic pathogens that have been isolated from the ISS include Staphylococcus aureus, 
S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, Acinetobacter pitti, Pantoea conspicua and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 
while others such as Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium have been detected with culture-independent, 
molecular based methods2,5. This study however, does not discuss virulence – a key factor that determines 
whether or not a microbe could be harmful to humans. Thus, the AMR gene carrying bacteria reported in this 
study do not necessarily pose a threat to astronauts on the ISS.
Antibiotics are the primary treatment strategy to combat infections, but this approach may not be as easy to 
implement on the ISS or on future deep space missions. Studies have shown that some organisms become less 
susceptible to antibiotic action when exposed to spaceflight. For example, the minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) of colistin and kanamycin for E. coli, isolated from an astronaut aboard Salyut 7, increased from 4 μ
g/ml 
to >16 μ
g/ml, compared to the ground control, while that of S. aureus increased two fold for oxacillin, chloram-
phenicol, and erythromycin6. Increased antibiotic resistance has also been noted on Discovery shuttle and Mir 
space station flight missions7. The mode of action for this resistance is unclear, but it could be due to increased 
mutations in bacterial genes. A study comparing S. epidermidis grown on the ISS vs Earth, for 122 hours, showed

a 24-fold higher frequency in mutations in the rpoB gene (beta subunit of RNA polymerase) when grown on the 
ISS, which rendered the isolates resistant to rifampicin8.
In a study comparing anti-microbial resistance in bacteria isolated from the ISS and the Antarctic Research 
Station Concordia, Schiwon et al. found that 75.8% of the ISS isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, 
whereas only 43.6% of the Antarctic isolates were resistant9. From the ISS, 86.2% of the isolates had relaxase and/
or transfer genes encoded on plasmids which can promote the dissemination of AMR genes from one microor-
ganism to another9. Importantly, the same genera and even most of the same species were examined between 
the two locations. The two major differences between these two confined, hostile and extreme environments are 
microgravity and radiation, which may contribute to the higher prevalence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms 
on the ISS. However, unlike the Schiwon et al.9 study that measured AMR profiles from isolated strains, this study 
has examined AMR gene profiles directly from DNA, without culturing.
It is well established that only a small proportion of microorganisms in any given environment can be cultured 
with standard laboratory techniques and the ISS is no different2. A recent microbial tracking study performed by 
our lab showed that less than 30% of intact, potentially viable microorganisms (i.e. samples treated with propid-
ium monoazide (PMA) which prevent amplification of dead cells in molecular analyses) could be cultured, leav-
ing 70% of organisms and their resistomes (i.e. the collection of AMR genes within a genome) unaccounted for 
(Checinska Sielaff et al., manuscript in preparation). In a recent study, propidium iodide ions were shown to move 
across intact cell membranes for Dinoroseobacter shibae and Bacillus subtilis using BacLight fuorescence staining 
and hypothesized that high membrane potential facilitated breakthrough of the double-charged propidium iodide 
and marked viable cells as dead10. In contrast, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we have shown that PMA 
was able to intercalate DNA in compromised cells which eventually blocked the amplification11.
In this study, we performed a thorough analysis of anti-microbial resistance genes within the ISS environment, 
using traditional and state-of-the art molecular techniques. Samples from eight ISS locations were obtained from 
three separate sampling events. The bacteria isolated from the samples were tested for resistance to several anti-
biotics. Concurrently, DNA from PMA treated samples was subjected to a target amplification of 518 antimicro-
bial genes, designed to match the content of the Antimicrobial Resistance Determinant Microarray (ARDM)12. 
Samples were treated with PMA before DNA extraction so that our focus would be on intact, potentially viable 
cells and not dead ones11 as live cells pose a greater risk to astronaut health. In addition, metagenome data gener-
ated from the DNA of the same PMA treated samples were mined for the presence of AMR and compared. This 
is the first report that presents the identification of the most common AMR genes on the ISS without culturing 
and correlates the results with phenotypic susceptibility and WGS data of cultured isolates. The study of the ISS 
resistome is crucial for the development of better surveillance and mitigation procedures on future long-duration 
spaceflight.
Results
Twenty-four samples were collected during three sampling events, over a span of a year, from eight locations 
onboard the ISS (Table 1). Samples were both (i) cultured, to obtain isolates for phenotypic antibiotic susceptibil-
ity testing and WGS and (ii) subjected to DNA extraction, after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment, to allow 
for Ion AmpliSeq™ and metagenomics analyses. PMA is a dye that intercalates with nucleic acid from dead cells 
and free DNA, allowing one to assess only intact bacteria within a sample11. A summary of the analysis work flow 
is presented in Fig. 1.
Phenotypic susceptibility tests of cultured organisms. 
Fifty-seven Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) micro-
organisms, isolated from the ISS, were tested for their resistance against the following 9 antibiotics using the disc 
diffusion method: cefazolin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamycin, oxacillin, penicillin, rifampin 
and tobramycin. Table S1 shows the measured zone of inhibition along with the percentage of resistant, inter-
mediate resistant and susceptible strains to each antibiotic. Out of the total 57 strains tested, 92% were resistant 
to penicillin while only 14% were resistant to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. For the remaining 6 antibiotics the 
resistance percentages were as follows: oxacillin (68%), rifampin (66%), erythromycin (64%), cefoxitin (49%),

cefazolin (29%) and tobramycin (19%). Enterobacter bugandensis, a novel species isolated from the ISS (man-
uscript in preparation), was resistant to the most antibiotics: all 6 E. bugandensis isolates tested were resistant 
against cefazolin, cefoxitin, erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin and rifampin, while for ciprofloxacin and genta-
mycin, strains were either resistant or intermediate resistant. For tobramycin some strains were resistant, some 
intermediate resistant and some susceptible. S. haemolyticus on the other hand, was not resistant to any of the 
antibiotics tested. Due to the serious health concerns of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which are resist-
ant to a variety of antibiotics, all 12 S. aureus isolates obtained on the ISS were further tested with the Vitek sys-
tem, which included a more comprehensive panel of antibiotics. Antibiotics that were tested with both the disc 
diffusion assay and Vitek showed the same results (with the exception of three isolates which were susceptible 
with Vitek but resistant with the disc assay) and the additional antibiotics tested with Vitek showed all strains to 
be susceptible, except four that were resistant to clindamycin (Table S1). In addition, assessment of methicillin 
resistance (i.e. MRSA) was performed using the HardyCHROM MRSA biplates and all 12 S. aureus strains tested 
were shown to not be MRSA.
Examining bacterial genomes for antibiotic resistance genes. 
WGS was performed on 15 of the 
57 BSL-2 organisms that were isolated from the ISS. In addition, six S. aureus mutant colonies that were present 
within the clear zone of inhibition after exposure to rifampin, also had their genomes sequenced. The presence or 
absence of AMR genes in each isolate is displayed in Fig. 2A. It is evident that S. aureus genomes show a distinct 
AMR gene profile compared to other staphylococcal species and other genera. Furthermore, amongst S. aureus 
isolates, the two that were resistant to erythromycin (IF4SW_P1_Sau and IF7SW_P3_Sau), as determined by the 
disc diffusion assay and Vitek testing, display a distinct AMR gene profile compared to all the others, indicating a 
possible genetic basis for resistance.
Mutations in the rpoB gene have been implicated in rifampin resistance8, therefore the rpoB gene sequence 
from the spontaneous rifampin resistant mutants and the sensitive parent strains were compared. With the excep-
tion of a base pair change from C to T at position 144, there were no other differences between parent and mutant 
strains.
Seven antibiotic resistance gene clusters were analyzed in the novel species E. bugandensis, isolated from the 
waste and hygiene compartment on the ISS (manuscript in preparation). These AMR gene clusters were associ-
ated with known pathogens and were not found in Enterobacter species isolated on Earth (Fig. 2B). This suggests 
that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) might have occurred but more research is needed to determine if HGT 
happened on the ISS.
Anti-microbial resistance gene profiles on the ISS using Ion AmpliSeq™. 
To survey the AMR gene 
content of a large collection of samples and independent of culture restrictions, DNA isolated from the 24 ISS 
samples was analyzed using Ion AmpliSeq™. Ion AmpliSeq™ technology consists of a pool of primer pairs, with 
each pair designed to amplify a specific gene. In our study, this panel consisted of primer pairs designed against 
518 known antibiotic resistance genes from a variety of bacteria12. Of the 518 genes that were tested for, a total of 
123 were detected, but only those that were over 100 reads from the Ion Torrent sequencer were kept for further 
analysis. This was a threshold setting to remove potential “false positives” which can arise from non-specific 
primer binding, mutations during amplification and Ion Torrent sequencing error13,14. A comprehensive

summary of the 63 detected genes (those with read counts over 100), their annotation numbers in NCBI (GI), the 
microorganisms they are related to, their function and the resistance they confer are found in Table S2.
Figure 3 shows the relative proportion of each detected AMR gene within a sample, with each colored bar 
representing a different AMR gene. The different colors and color patterns for each location suggest differences 
in spatial distribution of AMR genes at each location. This variability was confirmed with biplots, which show 
the distribution of the samples in relation to each other, and the contribution of each variable (i.e. gene) to the 
overall composition of that sample (Fig. S1). In addition to spatial differences, the dendrogram in Fig. 4A, shows 
temporal differences as well, with a clear separation of Flight 3 (F3) samples from Flight 1 (F1) and Flight 2 (F2). 
While there was no overall separation between F1 and F2, most paired samples (i.e. F1_8 vs F2_8) do cluster 
apart between the two sampling events (i.e. locations 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8). The separation between F1/F2 and F3 may 
be attributed to the low relative abundances of AMR genes present on the ISS during F3. As the heatmap in 
Fig. 4B shows, F3 samples had a higher number of genes shaded yellow, an indicator of abundances lower than the 
geometric mean abundance of all the 24 samples combined.
At the functional level, the genes for beta-lactam and trimethoprim resistance were abundant and widespread 
across the ISS (Fig. 5A). However, when a metagenomics approach was used to examine the AMR gene profiles, 
genes for beta-lactam resistance, while found in every sample, were not as abundant compared to other func-
tional groups and genes for trimethoprim resistance was not detected (Fig. 5B). The metagenomics approach 
also showed that genes conferring resistance to metals (i.e. zinc, copper etc) and those involved in multi-drug 
efflux pumps were the most abundant across the ISS, both of which were not detected with Ion AmpliSeq™. 
Fluoroquinolone resistance was also highly represented across the ISS, while Ion AmpliSeq™ only detected this 
gene family in only 3 samples. Ion AmpliSeq™ detected 23 antibiotic groups and metagenomics 13, with 6 shared 
between the two methods: aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinols (i.e. fluoroquinolones), fosfomycin, methicillin 
and streptomycin. At the gene level AmpliSeq™ and metagenomics both detected tetR, macB, fosA, and femB. As 
the two methods use a different set of reference genes and the raw data is processed differently, the fact that there 
are differences is not surprising, but it does highlight the usefulness of using a variety of analytical approaches.
Multiple AMR genes can be transferred on a single plasmid, giving rise to multi-drug resistance in the recip-
ient. We were therefore interested in assessing whether any genes were associated with each other and thus pos-
sibly found together. A correlation analysis showed statistically significant negative and positive correlations 
between the genetic determinants of AMR (see Table 2 for Spearman rho and P values).
Discussion
We have provided a comprehensive summary of the AMR genes present across the ISS over a span of a year using 
phenotypic assays, WGS, Ion AmpliSeq™ and metagenomics. The WGS of BSL-2 isolates showed the collective 
presence of 51 genes conferring resistance to 18 antibiotics. In most cases, the genotype of the sequenced strains 
could predict the phenotype, such as the presence of ermA and blaZ in S. aureus, which protects against eryth-
romycin and penicillin respectively15 and the presence of oqxA and oqxB in K. quasipneumoniae, which protects 
against ciprofloxacin16, all of which were resistant to their respective antibiotics in the disc diffusion assay. In 
other cases, the AMR profiles were not as straightforward to interpret. For example, one S. aureus isolate, (IF4SW.
P1_Sau) lacking the blaZ gene was still resistant to penicillin. In another case, the presence of norA in multiple S. 
aureus isolates did not protect against ciprofloxacin, even though transfer of this gene to susceptible strains has 
been proven to be enough to confer resistance17,18. The lack of consensus between genotype and phenotype in 
this case could be due to inadequate gene expression, which has been shown in numerous studies to be a barrier 
against resistance16. Moreover, this study was focused on the detection of genomic sequences of known AMR 
genes so any mutations and variations in gene expression of AMR genes were not analyzed in this study.
E. bugandensis was the most antibiotic resistant species tested with our phenotypic assay, with all six iso-
lates being resistant to all antibiotics tested (with the exception of two that were susceptible to tobramycin). 
Enterobacter species, a member of the coliform group of bacteria, have been reported to be pathogenic and cause 
opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals and are commonly associated with urinary and 
respiratory tract infections19. Of note, approximately 6% of the isolates cultured from the ISS were identified as 
Enterobacter. Carbapenems, a class of beta-lactams, are the most effective treatment against Enterobacter infec-
tions as they remain stable against extended spectrum beta lactamases, unlike penicillin and oxacillin. Ertapanem 
is the only carbapenem included in the medical kit onboard the ISS, however this may need to be re-evaluated, 
as numerous clinical isolates of Enterobacter species have shown resistance to ertapanem, though not other car-
bapenems, such as imipenem and meropenem20,21. There is the possibility that our ISS Enterobacter isolates, like 
the clinical isolates, are resistant to ertapanem, and potentially other carbapenems, as the IMP-2 gene, a metallo 
beta-lactamase that is able to inhibit the action of this class of antibiotic, was detected in our samples22. Further 
evaluation of this resistance profile and any other multi-drug resistant microorganisms, onboard the ISS, should 
be made a priority, in order to assess risk of infection and to ensure that proper strategies are in place to combat 
such infections.
Ion AmpliSeq™ revealed a collective of 65 AMR genes onboard the ISS, representing resistance to 23 dif-
ferent antibiotics. Nine of those detected genes (qacB, blaZ, bla- OKP, oqxA, oqxB, fos, tet38, norA and bla1) 
were also identified in the WGS analysis of our selected cultured isolates. One of the detected genes was mecA, 
a biomarker for methicillin resistant strains of S. aureus, commonly referred to as MRSA. MRSA are strains of 
Staphylococcus that have become resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactams (i.e. oxacillin, penicillin) used 
to treat ordinary Staphylococcus infections can cause serious complications (skin infections, sepsis and pneu-
moniae) in immune-compromised individuals. Even though mecA was detected in numerous samples across 
the ISS via AmpliSeqTM, none of the 12 S. aureus isolates tested with Vitek were MRSA positive nor was mecA 
detected in their genomes. While mecA is commonly associated with S. aureus, it has also been detected in other 
Staphylococcus species23,24 which may have been the source of the detected mecA during this study. Despite the

fact that none of the S. aureus isolates were MRSA at the time of collection, there is the possibility that they 
acquire mecA from other staphylococci. Indeed, the results of a hospital in the Netherlands, showed that mecA 
gene transfer occurred in a patient between mecA+ S. epidermidis and a mecA- strain of S. aureus25. This is not sur-
prising as there is mounting evidence in favor of the “resistance gene reservoir” where commensal organisms in

the body act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be transferred to resident or transient bacteria, including path-
ogens26,27. Further studies assessing the proportion and types of mobile genetic elements within the ISS metagen-
ome could shed some light on how readily AMR (and possibly virulence genes) may be acquired and transferred 
by bacteria on the ISS and if space conditions promote the transfer of AMR genes between different species and 
even different genera more readily then when these organisms are grown together on Earth.
A positive correlation was observed between oliquadox (oqxA and oqxB) and fosfomycin (fosA) resistance 
on the ISS, which conforms with ground studies showing the co-transfer of oqxA/oqxB and fosA genes from sin-
gle plasmids28,29. A positive correlation was also observed between mupirocin and lincosamide/streptograminA 
resistance genes on the ISS. While studies have documented the co-transfer of β
-lactam, quinolone, aminoglyco-
side, amphenicol and fosfomycin resistance genes to transconjugants28, this is the first study, to our knowledge, 
that has observed an association between muprirocin and lincosamide/streptogtanimA resistance genes.
It has been documented that metal exposure and the resulting resistance towards those metals leads to 
co-selection of unrelated antibiotic resistance30,31, most likely a consequence of metal resistance genes and AMR 
genes present on the same plasmid and/or transposon32. Indeed, bacterioplankton isolated from metal contami-
nated Ash basins were significantly more tolerant to a variety of antibiotics, which were not found in these basins, 
compared to bacterioplankton collected from basins void of metals33,34. Similar phenomena have been reported 
from metal contaminated freshwater34 and soil samples35. Our metagenomics data showed that the highest resist-
ance genes across all time points and all locations were in fact metal resistance genes. It is unknown whether the 
material of the ISS surfaces that these organisms were collected from promotes metal resistance dissemination 
amongst the microbiota but if that is the case, this metal resistance may play a role in the spread and abundance 
of AMR genes on the ISS.
To summarize, this is the first study to utilize an array of molecular methods to characterize the resistome on 
the ISS unveiling the presence of numerous genes conferring resistance to 28 different antimicrobial agents. The 
results from this study highlight the importance of using a variety of analytical methods to get a comprehensive 
picture of the resistome on the ISS and to utilize this information to develop concrete antibiotic resistance mitiga-
tion strategies. Some of these strategies could include the development of bioinspired alternative drugs, cleaning 
procedures for the eradication of specific organisms, bacterial specific microbial monitoring and evaluation of 
actual doses of antibiotics to be given in space. This will help maintain crew health, especially on long duration 
flight missions, when return to Earth for treatment is not an option.
Methods
Sample kit preparation and sample collection. 
Sampling wipes were assembled at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) following the procedure outlined by36. Briefly, each polyester wipe (9″
 ×
 9″
) (ITW Texwipe, 
Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO) for 30 minutes followed by transfer to a sterile zip lock bag. At the Ames Research Center (ARC, 
Moffett Field, CA), the wipes were packed along with other items, such as sterile gloves, as part of a kit sent to the 
ISS. Each sampling kit was then sent to the ISS on the Space-X cargo, and returned to the Earth on Soyuz TM-14 
or Dragon capsule (Table 1). The kits were delivered to JPL immediately upon return to Earth.
During each sampling session on the ISS, only one astronaut collected samples from eight different locations. 
The description of each location is depicted in Table 1. Each wipe was used to collect a sample of one square 
meter. The control wipe (environmental control) was only taken out from the Zip lock bag, unfolded and packed 
back to the zip lock. The samples were stored at 4 °C until the return trip to Earth and subsequent processing.
Sample processing. 
The sample processing took place in a 10 K class cleanroom at JPL immediately upon 
return to Earth. Each wipe was aseptically taken out from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500-mL bottle 
containing 200 mL of sterile PBS. The bottle with the wipe was shaken for two minutes followed by concentration 
with a Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO) using 0.45 µm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips and PBS 
elution fluid. The environmental control and each sample were concentrated to 5 mL.
PMA treatment and DNA extraction. A 1.5-mL aliquot was treated with PMA to allow for amplification of 
DNA from only intact cells11. 18.25 µL of 25 µM PMA in water was added to each sample followed by 5-minute 
incubation at room temperature in the dark, followed by a 15-minute exposure to the activation system (PMA 
LED device, Biotium, Hayward, CA). 750 µl was then transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix 
E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) and subjected to bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO 
Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten half and the unprocessed half were combined, followed by DNA extraction 
with the Maxwell 16 automated system using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit in accord-
ance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Resulting DNA samples in water (50 μ
L each) 
were stored at −
20 °C until downstream analysis.
Isolation and identification of bacteria from samples. The concentrated samples were diluted in PBS (up to 10−
6 
of each original sample) and 100 µL (in duplicate), were plated on R2A agar for environmental bacteria (incubated 
at room temperature for 7 days), and blood agar (BA) for human commensals (incubated at 35 °C for two days). 
On average, five isolates of distinct morphologies were picked up for each location from each type of media. The 
isolates were archived in semi solid R2A slants (dilution 1:10) and stored at room temperature. For identification, 
each bacterial isolate was revived on R2A media. Once a culture was confirmed to be pure, DNA extraction 
was performed by colony PCR, UltraClean DNA kit (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA) or Maxwell Automated System 
(Promega, Madison, WI). The 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene was used to identify the bacterial isolates using the following 
primers: 27 F (5′
-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′
) and 1492 R (5′
-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′
). The 
PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation

at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 55 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72 °C 
for 10 min. When 16S rRNA identification was ambiguous (B. cereus group isolates), the primers for gyrB (UP-1:

) were used and a 1.2-kb fragment of gyrase 
B was amplified as described previously37,38. The sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from DNAStar 
Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The bacterial sequences were searched against EzTaxon-e 
database39 and identified based on the closest similarity to 16S rRNA sequences of bacterial type strains.
Whole Genome Sequencing of Opportunistic Strains. 
Genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from 
21 BSL-2 bacterial strains were sent to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for WGS using the Illumina 
NextSeq. 500 sequencing system (San Diego, CA). The concentration of the gDNA was determined using a Qubit 
fluorimeter (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The sequencing library preparation was performed on the 
gDNA samples using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free LT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufactur-
er’s protocol. Briefly, the concentration of each gDNA was normalized to 40 ng/µl and 55 µl of each sample was 
fragmented on a Covaris M220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA) using settings to generate 550 base pair 
inserts. The Illumina TruSeq protocol was further followed to repair the fragmented DNA ends, adenylate the 3’ 
ends of the fragments, and finally ligate Illumina sequencing adaptors to the fragmented DNAs.
The libraries were validated using the Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms (KAPA, Wilmington, 
MA) following manufacturer’s protocols. Following the quantification, each library was normalized, pooled, and 
denatured according to Illumina protocols. Briefly, each library was normalized to 0.5 nM and 5 µl of each nor-
malized sample was pooled together. The 40-µL pooled sample was denatured by combining with 40 µL of 0.2N 
NaOH. The denatured, pooled sample was further diluted to a concentration of 1.8 pM where it was mixed with 
denatured PhiX control DNA (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at a concentration of 1%. This sample was loaded on to 
the NextSeq Sequencer using the NextSeq High Output v2 300 cycle sequencing kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). 
The NextSeq was set up to run a paired end, 150 nucleotide (2 ×
 150) run with single indexing.
Data assembly and gene annotation. Draft assemblies of the bacterial isolates were generated as described 
in40. Starting with the draft assemblies as input, genes were predicted for each genome using Glimmer v. 3.0241 
using the g3-from-scratch.csh script with default settings to generate genome specific gene models. Each gene 
was searched against a collection of curated genes taken from the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database 
(CARD)42, ResFinder43 and ARG-ANNOT44. Each gene was searched against the curated gene database using 
the top hit from a blastn search (NCBI BLAST v2.2.27+) with word_size 8, num_threads 20, outfmt 7, max_tar-
get_seqs. 1, and all other options set to default. A table was generated recording individual genes that matched to 
an annotated resistance gene for each organism with at least 90% identity between the query and reference gene 
over at least 90% of the length of reference gene. Gene labels and gene function were manually assigned based on 
annotation assignments given in the included curated gene databases.
Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing. 
The isolates were streaked from glycerol stocks onto R2A 
plates. A single colony was inoculated into 5-mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown overnight at 30 °C. Aliquots 
of 100 µL were plated on TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed 
aseptically on a plate and the strains were incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. The tested antibiotics included: 30-µg 
cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-µg cefoxitin (FOX-30), 5-µg ciprofloxacin (CIP-5), 15 µg erythromycin (E-15), 10-µg gen-
tamicin (GM-10), 1-µg oxacillin (OX), 10-µg penicillin (P-10), 5-µg rifampin (RA-5), and 10-µg tobramycin 
(NN-10). The diameter of inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk and recorded in millimeters. 
The resistance results were compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts provided by the manufacturer. 
When the spontaneous mutants were present in response to some antibiotics, they were isolated, subcultured and 
tested for the specific antibiotic resistance.
Vitek®2 Compact AST-GP67 cards (BioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) were selected to test the S. aureus 
isolates. The AST-GP67 cards are designed for testing gram-positive cocci. The tested antibiotics were ampicillin, 
benzylpenicillin, beta-lactamase, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, 
linezolid, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin oxacillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifampicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, 
tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. The cards were initially analyzed for expected out-
comes by running the manufacturers recommended quality control organisms S. aureus ATCC 29213, ATCC 
BAA-1026, ATCC BAA-976, and ATCC BAA-977, and the results were as predicted (data not shown). Liquid 
aliquots of the organisms were shipped overnight from JPL to AlloSource® (Centennial, CO) and refrigerated 
upon arrival. The aliquot of 0.1 mL subcultures of each microorganism was spread onto Trypticase Soy Agar 
(TSA) plates (BD BBLTM) and incubated overnight at 30–35°C. Using a sterile cotton swab, a pure colony of each 
organism was suspended in 3.0 mL sterile 0.9% saline at 0.55 McFarland using a DensiCheck® densitometer 
(BioMerieux, Inc.). A second dilution was prepared by aliquoting 0.28 mL of the initial inoculant into a fresh 
3.0 mL sterile 0.9% saline solution. The swab was inoculated onto a TSA plate to check for inoculant purity. 
Both concentrations of each organism were loaded into separate AST-GP67 cards and analyzed by the Vitek®2 
Compact (BioMerieux, Inc.) applying the CLSI+ Natural Resistance susceptibility standards per the manufactur-
ers recommendations. Reports were verified by AlloSource® technicians. Confirmation of methicillin sensitivity 
(MRSA) was performed using HardyCHROM MRSA biplates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). Each isolate 
was streaked on both sides of the bi-plate and incubated at 30–35 °C overnight. Isolate sensitivity was interpreted 
using the manufacturers recommendation

Ion AmpliSeq™. 
Library preparation and targeted Sequencing. Ion AmpliSeq™ libraries (Life Technologies) 
were constructed with the Ion AmpliSeq™ library protocol as previously described45. The PCR conditions were 
as follows: 2X primer mix, 6 µL of sample and 16 PCR cycles consisting of a 99 °C for 15 sec; 60 °C for 4 min. 
Both primer pools were utilized to create two unique Ion AmpliSeq™ libraries for each metagenome sample. All 
libraries were quality checked using the Agilent BioAnalyzer and quantitated using the Ion Library Quantitation 
Kit. Template was diluted to target 10–30% enriched beads and clonally amplified using Ion PGM OT2 400 kit. 
Enriched beads were sequenced using the Ion PGM 400 Sequencing kit on an Ion 318™ chip at default instru-
ment parameters. Libraries were sequenced in multiplex.
Ion AmpliSeq™ panel design. An Ion AmpliSeq™ custom panel (AmpliSeq MDR v.1, Thermo Scientific, South 
San Francisco, CA, USA) was designed to match the content of the Antimicrobial Resistance Determinant 
Microarray (ARDM)12. Primer design was performed by Life Technologies using the Ion AmpliSeq™ strategy 
and the Ion AmpliSeq™ software. The Ion AmpliSeq MDR v.1 consists of two primer pools that are capable 
of generating a total of 1,358 amplicons targeting 518 known, non-SNP mediated resistance determinants. The 
assay was designed to generate two unique amplicons per target for 404 resistance genes. For the remaining 114 
genes corresponding to bla (beta-lactam) and qnr (quinolone) resistance determinants, the assay was designed to 
generate a sufficient number of overlapping amplicons to span the entire gene. Amplicon sequences are available 
upon request. Primer information is not supplied by Life Technologies.
Amplicon sequence read quality control. Sequence read files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v 8.0 
(CLC Inc, Aarhus, Denmark). Reads were trimmed at default parameters based on quality score (≤
0.05), ambig-
uous nucleotides (≤
2) and filtered on read length (≥
75 bp). Trimmed reads were saved as a separate file and used 
in all downstream bioinformatics analyses.
Reference mapping. Sequence read mapping was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench v8.0 CLC 
Reference Mapper was run with default settings (Insertion cost = 3, Deletion cost = 3, Mismatch cost = 2, Length 
fraction = 0.5 and similarity fraction = 0.8). Mapping of all sequence reads was performed using a multi-fasta file 
that contained the PCR amplicons that comprise the ARDM array.
The raw sequence reads have been deposited into the NCBI SRA database under accession #SRP082440.
Bioinformatics analysis. 
Dendrogram, heatmaps, barplot and biplots were all generated in R (http://
www.R-project.org/). Relative abundances displayed in the bar plot were generated by taking the read count of 
a gene in a sample and dividing by the total read count of that sample. Data was centered log ratio (clr) trans-
formed46 using the “compositions” package in R. The dendrogram was created with the “pvclust” package, which 
assesses the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. The heatmap was generated with the “gplot” package. 
Counts rarefied to 1830 reads were used in the heatmap and were generated in QIIME using the single_rarefac-
tion.py script. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes were 
performed as per47. Briefly, the Spearman’s rank correlation between the relative abundances of each genus (clr 
transformed) in 128 inferred technical replicates and clr transformed AMR relative abundances were calculated 
with the aldex.corr function from the ALDEx2 package in R. Spearman’s rho values were converted to P-values 
and corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Correlations between AMR genes were performed as above, 
with the AMR dataset substituted for the microbiome dataset in the script.
Metagenome analysis. 
Extracted DNA was sent to Second Genome (South San Francisco, CA) for 
sequencing. All samples were quantified via the Qubit® Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen, Life 
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) to ensure that they met minimum concentration and mass of DNA. Samples 
were prepared for sequencing with the Illumina Nextera kit and quantified with Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity 
assays. Libraries were pooled and run with 100 bp paired-end sequencing protocols on the Illumina HiSeq. 2500 
platform. The NGS QC Toolkit v 2.3 was used to filter the raw data for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free 
reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HW, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20)48. Filtered DNA sequences 
were mapped against a reference database of all proteins within the KEGG databases using MEGAN649. Reads 
over 100 for each gene, that were predicted for antimicrobial resistance were clustered together and visualization 
was done using MEGAN. A total of 8 million reads were generated for each sample. The heatmap used to visualize 
the data was generated in R using the gplot function.
