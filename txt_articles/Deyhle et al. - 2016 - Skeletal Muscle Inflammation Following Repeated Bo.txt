Skeletal muscle responds to exercise-induced damage by orchestrating an adaptive
process that protects the muscle from damage by subsequent bouts of exercise, a
phenomenon called the repeated bout effect (RBE). The mechanisms underlying the RBE
are not understood. We hypothesized that an attenuated inflammation response following
a repeated bout of lengthening contractions (LC) would be coincidental with a RBE,
suggesting a potential relationship. Fourteen men (n = 7) and women (n = 7) completed
two bouts of lengthening contractions (LC) separated by 28 days. Muscle biopsies were
taken before the first bout (B1) from the non-exercised leg, and from the exercised
leg 2- and 27-d post-B1 and 2-d following the second bout (B2). A 29-plex cytokine
array identified alterations in inflammatory cytokines. Immunohistochemistry quantified
inflammatory cell infiltration and major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1).
Muscle soreness was attenuated in the days following B2 relative to B1, indicating a RBE.
Intramuscular monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1) and interferon gamma-induced
protein 10 (IP10) increased following B2 relative to the pre-exercise sample (7–52
and 11–36 pg/ml, respectively p < 0.05). Interleukin 4 (IL4) decreased (26–13 pg/ml,
p
<
0.05) following B2 relative to the pre-exercise sample. Infiltration of
CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T-cells were evident following B2, but not B1. Moreover,
CD8+ T-cells were observed infiltrating apparently necrotic muscle fibers. No changes
in MHC-1 were found. We conclude that inflammation is not attenuated following a
repeated bout of LC and that CD8+ T-cells may play a role in muscle adaptation following
LC. Moreover, it appears that the muscle or the immune system becomes sensitized to
an initial bout of damaging exercise such that inflammatory cell infiltration into the muscle
is enhanced upon a repeated bout of damaging exercise.

INTRODUCTION
A truly remarkable property of skeletal muscle is that it maintains an intrinsic protective
mechanism, whereby it swiftly adapts following exercise-induced damage, making it capable of
resisting future damage. This phenomenon has been recognized for over half a century (Highman
and Altland, 1963) and is commonly referred to in the literature as the repeated bout effect
 Deyhle et al.
Muscle Inflammation and the Repeated Bout Effect
(RBE) (Nosaka and Clarkson, 1995). Over the years, a significant
body of literature has been developed to describe the parameters
of an original stimulus necessary to induce the protective effect
(Lavender and Nosaka, 2008; Barroso et al., 2010; Muthalib
et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the molecular underpinnings and
deeper mechanisms of the RBE have been relatively understudied
and are not well known. A more complete understanding
of the mechanisms that mediate the RBE adaptation(s) may
have significant clinical value with vast applications, from the
prevention and management of muscle related injuries, to the
treatment of muscle degenerative disorders.
Potential mechanisms for the RBE that have been explored
recently
by
our
laboratory
and
others
have
implicated
extracellular matrix remodeling (Hyldahl et al., 2015), and
muscle architectural alterations (Lau et al., 2015). An older
hypothesis, supported initially by the results of animal studies,
proposes that reduced inflammation following a second damage
exposure reduces secondary damage and subsequent markers
of muscle damage (McHugh, 2003). Indeed rodent studies
have shown a blunted inflammatory response in conjunction
with muscle damage markers when lengthening contractions
(LC) were preceded by either a bout of passive stretches, or a
prior bout of LC (Pizza et al., 2002; Koh et al., 2003). However,
inflammation has not been comprehensively assessed following
repeated bouts of damaging exercise in humans, leaving doubt
as to whether this mechanism is important in mediating the
protective effect in human skeletal muscle. Moreover, few
studies have examined the intramuscular inflammatory cytokine
environment following repeated bouts of damaging exercise.
Information from these studies is also somewhat limiting given
that the cytokines were measured only at the mRNA level (Hubal
et al., 2008; Mackey et al., 2011).
Thus, the purpose of this study was to broadly assess markers
of inflammation (i.e., cytokines and infiltrating lymphoid and
myeloid cells) in human muscle in a well-established paradigm of
the RBE in the knee extensor muscles. Overall, we hypothesized
that muscle inflammatory markers would be present following
the first bout of LC, as reported by others (Paulsen et al., 2012).
Furthermore, we expected that these same markers would be
attenuated following a repeated bout of LC, consistent with
the attenuation of other direct and indirect markers of muscle
damage.
METHODS
Subjects
Fourteen young, healthy, men (n = 7; age 23.3 ± 2.1) and
women (n = 7; age 25.6 ± 2.5) volunteered to participate
in this study. The activity level of the subjects ranged from
moderately active to sedentary. The subjects had not participated
in weight training or consistent, structured physical activity in
the past 6 months. As a participant in the study, the subjects
agreed to not change their activity levels or use any form of
analgesic or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the
duration of the study. All subjects signed a written informed
consent document authorized by the Brigham Young University
Institutional Review Board, and were informed of the procedures
as well as potential risks.
Study Design
This study consisted of two bouts of lengthening contractions
(LC) spaced 28 days apart. Twenty eight days between bouts was
chosen because it allows for sufficient washout of acute symptoms
of the initial bout (e.g., soreness, strength loss, serum enzymes)
and is still within the 6 to 9-month window of time that the
RBE lasts after an initial bout (Nosaka et al., 2001). Each bout
of exercise was performed on the same randomly selected leg.
Four muscle biopsies were taken. The first biopsy was taken 1
day before the first bout of exercise (designated as day -1) from
the non-exercised leg. Two days after the first bout of exercise,
the second biopsy was taken (designated as 2d post-B1) from
the exercised leg. The third biopsy (designated as 27d post-B1)
was taken from the same exercised leg 27 days after the B1 (also
described as the day before the second bout of exercise). The next
day (28 days after B1) the subjects completed the second bout
of LC (B2) using the same exercise leg, and a muscle biopsy was
taken 2 days later on the exercised leg (designated as 2d post-B2).
The post-LC biopsy was taken at 48 h because this is around the
time when many markers of muscle damage are greatest (strength
loss, soreness, plasma creatine kinase activity). Muscle soreness
was assessed 1 day prior to the exercise and then again 2, 3, 4, and
5 days following each bout of LC. Throughout the duration of the
study, subjects were instructed to maintain their regular diet and
level of physical activity, as well as refraining from use of caffeine,
alcohol and NSAIDs. One subject reported using ice 2 days after
the first bout of exercise to reduce muscle soreness.
Exercise Protocol
The exercise sessions each included 30 sets of 10 maximal
eccentric contractions. The exercises were performed on an
isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY,
USA). Subjects were instructed to resist the lever arm from
30◦ (0◦ = full extension) of flexion to the subject’s maximal
knee flexion ROM (approximately 110◦), moving at an angular
velocity of 120◦ s−1. Between each set, subjects were given a 1-
min rest. This same exercise protocol has been widely used to
induce muscle damage and a RBE (McKay et al., 2010; Hyldahl
et al., 2015). There were no differences in the amount of work
performed for each bout of exercise.
Muscle Biopsy Procedure
Four total muscle biopsies were taken from the m. vastus lateralis.
This muscle was chosen because it is easy to access and no
major blood vessels or nerves are in the area. After using 2%
lidocaine as a local anesthetic, a small incision was made past
skin and fascia. Percutaneous muscle biopsies were then collected
through a manual suction method. The first biopsy incision was
made approximately 15 cm proximal to the insertion of the vastus
lateralis of the non-exercised leg. Subsequent biopsies from the
exercised leg were taken approximately 3–5 cm proximal to the
previous biopsy to minimize the effects of previous biopsies.
Care was also taken to angle the insertion of the needle away
from the previous biopsy to minimize effects of previous biopsies

Muscle Inflammation and the Repeated Bout Effect
(Van Thienen et al., 2014). Muscle samples were preserved for
both immunohisochemisty and protein analysis. Samples for
microscopic analysis were mounted on a cork and frozen in
isopentane-cooled liquid nitrogen while samples used for protein
homogenates were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples
were stored at −80◦C.
Soreness Assessments
Perceived muscle soreness was assessed using a visual analog
scale (VAS). The VAS consisted of a 100 mm line with anchors
indicating “no pain” on one end, and “unbearable pain” on
the opposite end. Subjects were instructed to perform two
body weight squats and then immediately evaluate soreness by
marking on the VAS scale with a vertical line. The distance from
the no pain end of the VAS was measured and used for analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
Muscle biopsy samples used for histochemical staining were cut
into 8 µm sections using a cryostat at −25◦C. Cut samples were
mounted on Superfrost slides and allowed to air dry for 10 min.
Sections stained for CD8 were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min. After fixation, samples were washed in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in primary antibodies
overnight at 4◦C (CD8 diluted 1:50 in PBS and dystrophin
1:500). On the following day, samples were washed and incubated
in secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in PBS for 30 min at
37◦C. DAPI (4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride)
was added to the secondary antibody solution to visualize
nuclei. Following incubation, samples were washed in PBS and
dipped in water. The slides were then dried and mounted
with Fluoroshield histology mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, Mo, USA). Sections stained for CD68 were fixed in
2% paraformaldehyde for 4–8 min. Following fixation, sections
were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then
blocked in a 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) solution for 30 min at room temperature. Sections
were incubated in the primary antibodies (CD68 and dystrophin
diluted in blocking cocktail at 1:300 and 1:200, respectively) in a
humidified chamber overnight at 4◦C. Following several washes,
sections were then incubated in the appropriate secondary
antibodies (both diluted at 1:200 in PBS) for 30 min at 37◦C.
Following multiple washes, slides were incubated in DAPI for
30 min at 37◦C. Stained slides were washed in PBST (PBS
tween-20), dried, then mounted using Fluoroshield histology
mounting medium. Sections stained for MHC-I were fixed
in 100% ice-cold acetone for 10 min. Following a rinse with
PBS, the samples were placed in a humidified chamber and
were incubated in blocking solution for 1 h (5% horse serum
and 0.2% Trition X 100). Following blocking, the samples
were washed in PBS. The samples were then incubated with
the primary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS with 2% BSA
in a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature. The
wash procedure was repeated and the samples were incubated
in a secondary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS with DAPI.
All slides were imaged on an Olympus IX73 fluorescence
capable inverted microscope. Antibody stain validity was verified
using secondary-only controls. Primary antibodies used were;
CD8, mouse monoclonal IS623 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark),
CD68, mouse monoclonal M0718 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark),
dystrophin, rabbit polyclonal (ab15277; Abcam, Cambridge,
United Kingdom) HLA-ABC (MHC-I) mouse monoclonal
M0736 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Secondary antibodies used:
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit A11029 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad California, USA), Cy3 anti-rabbit 115-165-003 (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove PA).
Quantification of Immunofluorescent
Images
Quantification of immunofluorescent images was carried out
by investigators that were blind to both condition and time
point. For CD68 analyses, enumeration was accomplished by
analyzing 10 randomly acquired fields using a 40X objective.
A cell was considered CD68+ when the green fluorescent stain
clearly surrounded a DAPI+ nucleus (see arrows in Figure 4).
An average of 210 ± 10 muscle fibers were analyzed per subject
per time point. Because CD8+ cells appeared to be much less
frequent than CD68+ cells, CD8 enumeration was made by
imaging the entire section, using a 20X objective. This resulted in
approximately 10–20 acquired fields per time point, depending
on the size of the muscle cross section. An average of 801.9 ±
329.3 muscle fibers were analyzed per subject per time point. To
assess MHC-I content, the entire muscle section was imaged at 10
X magnification. Two to five images per time point were acquired
to capture the entire section. Images were taken using the same
exposure and gain settings within subjects. For quantification, the
total MHC-1 immunoreactive area was expressed relative to the
total area of the imaged section.
Cytokine Magnetic Bead Multiplex
The frozen muscle samples were homogenized with a Total
Protein Extraction Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with protease
and
phosphatase
inhibitor
cocktails
(Thermo
Scientific,
Rockford, IL). A Direct Detect Spectrometer (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA) was used to determine the total protein
concentrations. The Luminex Magpix multiplexing platform
was then used for multianalyte profiling of biopsy sample
homogenates. Cytokines in muscle homogenates were measured
using a 29-plex cytokine kit in compliance with manufacturer’s
parameters (EDM Millipore, Billerica, MA). Briefly, 25 µg
of protein homogenate were incubated overnight at 4◦C
with antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. The bead-complex
was then washed, followed by 30 min incubation at RT on a
plate shaker in biotinylated detection antibody. Streptavidin-
phycoerythrin was subsequently added and samples were
incubated for an additional for 30 min on a plate shaker at
RT. A Magpix (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) system was
used to quantify bead-complexes. Data analysis was based on a
minimum of 80 beads using median fluorescence values.
Statistics
Perceived muscle soreness was evaluated using the area under
the curve (AUC) for soreness response for the days after bout
1 and bout 2 for each subject. AUC measurements 1 day before
exercise and days 2 through 5 after exercise were used to

calculate AUC for each bout. A paired t-test was used to test for
differences in AUC between bouts. A One-way repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in
immunohistochemical data. Each individual cytokine of interest
was also analyzed using One-way repeated measures ANOVAs.
A Tukey-Kramer HSD test was used for pairwise comparisons
when the F-statistic revealed a significant p-value. Correlation
analyses were carried out using a mixed models linear regression
technique with blocking on subjects. Blocking on subjects was
used to account for the lack of independence in the data.
Correlation analysis was only investigated when a relationship
between variables was anticipated. To normalize distributions
and homogenize variance, the following variables were log
transformed; IL-4, MCP-1, IP-10, soreness. Prism Graphpad
(V6.0b; San Diego, CA, USA) was used for AUC and t-test
calculations for soreness data. JMP R
� Pro (V11.2; SAS institute,
Cary, NC, USA) was used for all other analyses. Results were
considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Soreness
Changes in the overall magnitude of delayed onset muscle
soreness associated with B1 and B2 were compared to verify
the presence of a RBE. Muscle soreness in the knee extensor
muscle group increased after B1 and B2 and returned to baseline
values 5 days after exercise for both bouts (Figure 1A). Muscle

soreness peaked 2 days after exercise for B1 and B2. To quantify
differences in overall soreness response in the days after each
bout, we compared the AUC of soreness for B1 and B2. AUC of
soreness was significantly reduced at B2 compared to B1 (33%
reduction, ± 11%, one-tailed p = 0.032; Figure 1B).
Cytokine Array
To determine the extent of inflammation and identify potentially
important inflammatory cytokines that may mediate the RBE,
we performed an unbiased 29-plex cytokine screen. Among the
29 cytokines measured, only monocyte chemoattractant protein
1 (MCP-1 also known as CCl2), Interleukin 4 (IL-4), and
Interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 also known as
CXCL10) showed a significant main effect among biopsy time
points (p < 0.05). Figure 2 shows comparisons of the mean

values of IP-10, MCP-1, and IL-4 across sampling time points.
IP-10 was significantly increased at post-B2 relative to pre-B1
(2.26 ± 1.31-fold, p = 0.021). Potential trending differences
may be present between pre-B1 and post-B1 (p = 0.11) and
pre-B2 and post-B2 (p = 0.12). MCP-1 content at post-B2
was significantly elevated compared to pre-B1 (2.97 ± 1.35-fold,
p = 0.0032). MCP-1 content at pre-B2 showed a suggestive but
inconclusive increase over pre-B1 (2.15 ± 1.35-fold p = 0.0603).
In contrast, IL-4 showed a significant decrease from pre-B1 to
post-B2 (3.82 ± 1.44-fold, p = 0.041) and from pre-B1 to pre-
B2 (3.72 ± 1.44-fold, p = 0.005). An inconclusive decreasing
trend in IL-4 content was also observed between pre-B2 and
post-B2 (p = 0.14) Results of all other non-significant detectable
cytokines can be found in Table 1.
Macrophage Infiltration
As MCP-1 is an important mediator of macrophage infiltration
into damaged skeletal muscle (Shireman et al., 2007), we
analyzed the muscle cross sections for the presence of CD68+
macrophages using immunohistochemistry (Figure 3A). Given
that a significant increase in MCP-1 was only detectable following
B2, we expected that macrophage content would be increased
post-B2 relative to the pre-B1 measurement. As expected, the
number of CD68+ cells per 100 muscle fibers increased by
4.6 ± 1.5 cells per 100 fibers following B2 compared to the pre-
B1 measurement (p = 0.021; Figure 3B). Additionally we noted
an increasing trend in the number of CD68+ macrophages at
post-B1 compared to the pre-B1 measurement (p = 0.08).
T-Cell Infiltration
Our analysis of cytokines identified increases in few cytokines
48 h post-LC. Among the differentially altered cytokines, IP-
10 was interesting, as we had previously found this cytokine
to be increased 24 h following a single bout of LC (Hyldahl
et al., 2014). IP-10 appears to be important in the activation
and trafficking of T-cells to infected tissues (Khan et al., 2000;
Dufour et al., 2002) and is found to be up-regulated in the
muscle of individuals suffering from inflammatory myopathies
accompanied by increased levels of cytotoxic T-cells (De Paepe
et al., 2005). Guided by our finding of increased levels of IP-10
following B2, we assessed the presence of CD8+ T-cells in the
muscle samples using an antibody against CD8 (Figures 4A,B).
Overall, the occurrence of CD8+ T-cells in the muscle samples
was infrequent relative to other cell types that have been
identified in human skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, CD8+ T-
cells per 100 muscle fibers increased following B2 (2.7 ± 2.8)
relative to pre-B1 (0.5 ± 0.4) (p = 0.003) and post-B1 (1.0
± 0.7) (p = 0.027) (Figure 4C). CD8+ cells were also found
infiltrating what appeared to be regenerating myofibers, as
evidenced by diminished and discontinuous dystrophin staining
pattern (Figure 4B) and in spaces adjacent to what appeared to
be vasculature (i.e., capillaries).
Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I
(MHC-I)
MHC-I proteins display antigens on the cell surface for
CD8+ T-cell-mediated surveillance. MHC-I is not normally
expressed by mature skeletal muscle cells. However, MHC-I
expression can be greatly up-regulated in muscle suffering from
inflammatory myopathies (Englund et al., 2001; Choi et al.,
2009) and in response to extreme exercise (Marklund et al.,
2013). Given the relationship between CD8+ T-cell and MHC-1,
we measured MHC-I content via immunohistochemistry in
the muscle to test the hypothesis that MHC-I content would
increase in the muscle in parallel with the observed changes
in T-cell content. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no
significant changes in MHC-I immunoreactivity (Figures 5A,B).
MHC-I immunoreactivity was found consistently on capillaries

staining was also commonly found around the sarcolemma,
though it was rarely found completely surrounding fibers
(Figure 5A). In one subject (a high responder) evidence

Linear Regression Analyses
Mixed models linear regression analyses were used to determine
if the content of the chemotactic cytokines, IP-10, and MCP-
1 were related to the number of infiltrating CD8+ T-cells and
CD68+ macrophages. Figure 6 shows graphical representations
of each correlation. A strong relationship was found between
loge MCP-1 and CD68+ cells per muscle fiber (r2
=
0.71, slope = 0.029 ± 0.007, p < 0.0001). A similarly strong
relationship was also observed between loge IP-10 and CD68+
macrophages per muscle fiber (r2 = 0.67, slope = 0.027 ± 0.008,
p = 0.001). Weaker, yet significant correlations were found
between these cytokines and CD8+ T-cells. Loge IP-10 vs. CD8+
T-cells per fiber yielded an r2 of 0.26 (slope = 0.007 ± 0.009, p =
0.024). MCP-1 vs. CD8+ T-cells per fiber yielded an r2 = 0.33
(slope = 0.008 ± 0.003, p = 0.006). No significant correlation
between MHC-I immunoreactivity and CD8+ T-cell infiltration
was found (r2 = 0.25, slope = −0.001 ± 0.002 p = 0.71).
DISCUSSION
Inflammation following damaging exercise has been thought
to cause further tissue damage mediated by muscle-invading
leukocytes (Toumi and Best, 2003). A hypothesized mechanism
of the RBE posits that inflammation following damaging exercise,
and in turn secondary muscle damage, is blunted following
a second bout of damaging exercise (McHugh et al., 1999).
Overwhelmingly, the data presented here do not support the
hypothesis of an attenuated inflammatory response following a
second bout of LC. On the contrary, the data suggest an unaltered
or slightly enhanced inflammatory response following a second
bout of LC. The overall reduction in delayed onset muscle
soreness (an established indicator of muscle damage, Clarkson
and Hubal, 2002) in the days following B2 provides evidence of
a RBE. Additionally, a previously published study that reported
on the same group of subjects, showed reduced strength loss, and
insignificant increases in serum creatine kinase activity following
B2 (Hyldahl et al., 2015).
Surprisingly, only three cytokines showed significant changes
among all 29 measured. Inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and
IP-10 increased after B2, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-4 was reduced before and after B2. The increases in cytokine
concentration also mirrored (and were positively correlated with)
the changes in macrophage and T-cell infiltration, providing
suggestive evidence for a chemotactic relationship between
these cytokines and inflammatory cell populations in human
muscle. Our observation that these events were only increased
following B2 suggests that the initial bout of LC may have
sensitized the muscle toward a greater, and therefore more
persistent state of inflammation following the second bout
of LC. In other words, the muscle seems to “remember”
the damaging insult and is sensitized to initiate a more
robust recruitment of immune cells in response to a repeated
insult, reminiscent of the way the adaptive immune system
responds to a repeated antigen exposure. Furthermore, muscle
soreness is reduced concurrent with an increase in inflammation,
indicating that a positive relationship between these variables is
unlikely.

augmentation following damage appears to be necessary for
healthy muscle regeneration (Warren et al., 2004; Shireman
et al., 2007). Consistent with the findings of Hubal et al.
(2008), we observed a significant increase in MCP-1 post-B2.
However, this finding is in contrast with another study that
showed an attenuation of MCP-1 gene expression following
a repeated bout of damaging electrically stimulated isometric
contractions (Mackey et al., 2011). Electrically stimulated
contractions and voluntary eccentric contractions have been
shown to cause distinct histological and biochemical responses
(Crameri
et
al.,
2007).
Therefore,
the
reason
for
these
disparate findings may be related to the differing modes of
damage-induction. Furthermore, both of these studies measured
MCP-1 at the transcript level, whereas we assessed MCP-1
protein content.
An interesting and novel finding that emerged from the
present study is the increase in the classically pro-inflammatory
cytokine IP-10 following B2. IP-10 is an important regulator of
T-cell trafficking (Dufour et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2015). IP-10 is
also involved in inflammation and immune responses in a host
of tissues and conditions, yet little data are available regarding
the role of IP-10 in skeletal muscle. IP-10 has been identified
as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory myopathies
(Crescioli et al., 2012), but is also expressed in unperturbed
healthy skeletal muscle (De Paepe et al., 2005). Recent work from
our laboratory showed IP-10 to be up-regulated in muscle 24 h
after a single bout of LC but not shortening contractions (Hyldahl
et al., 2014). Like in our previous study, IP-10 concentrations
were increased in response to damaging LC, albeit only after
a repeated bout (Figure 2). Why significant increases were not
seen post-B1 might be due to different sampling time points. In
the present study, we took muscle samples 48 h after exercise
whereas our previous investigation sampled muscle 24 h after
exercise. Together, these studies suggest IP-10 may play a role in
the damage and repair process of muscle adaptation to exercise.
More work is needed to characterize the role IP-10 plays in these
processes.
IL-4 is an important cytokine in driving the M1 to M2
phenotypic conversion (Villalta et al., 2009). Here we report a
decrease in IL-4 protein concentration in muscle tissue from pre-
B1 to post-B2 (Figure 2). This finding was unexpected because
the present hypothesis predicted an attenuated inflammation
response around B2, but the observed reduction in IL-4
around B2 is suggestive of an increased pro-inflammatory
state. These data suggest that the increased number of CD68+
macrophages after B2 (Figure 3B) may have embodied a more
pro-inflammatory phenotype. However, TNF-alpha and IFN-
gamma, both promoters of the M1 phenotype (Villalta et al.,
2009) were not present in the muscle samples at this time
point in detectible quantities (Table 1). This suggests that the
macrophages present post-B2 likely did not display a highly
polarized phenotype at either end of the M1/M2 spectrum.
Given that macrophages were significantly elevated only at post-
B2 when evidence of muscle damage was reduced suggests
that these cells do not aggravate the symptoms (i.e., soreness,
force loss, and membrane permeability) of exercise-induced
damage in healthy human skeletal muscle. This interpretation is
consistent with data from Tidball et al. (1999), which showed
that the loss of sarcolemmal integrity in response to muscle
overload was not different in the presence or absence of
macrophages. Likewise, another study by the same group showed
that macrophages promote muscle repair and regeneration in
response to overload-induced damage (Tidball and Wehling-
Henricks, 2007).

Inflammatory Cell Infiltration
Consistent with others (Stupka et al., 2001; Mackey et al., 2011)
we observed a significant increase in macrophage content in the
muscle following damaging exercise, though we are the first,
to our knowledge, to report that macrophages accumulate in
greater numbers following a second exposure to LC. Another
novel finding of the present study is our observation of increased
muscle T-cell content after a second bout of LC (Figure 4C).
T-cells are known to play a role in inflammatory myopathies
(Choi et al., 2009; Crescioli et al., 2012), muscular dystrophies
(Spencer et al., 2001; Choi et al., 2009; Madaro and Bouche,
2014), and obesity-related muscle fat accumulation and insulin
resistance (Khan et al., 2015). Moreover, the presence of
T-cells in muscle tissue has been thought to be specific to
muscle afflicted with chronic inflammatory pathologies (Madaro
and Bouche, 2014). However, one study has demonstrated a
significant increase in muscle T-cell content following a 24-h
ultra endurance bout (Marklund et al., 2013). The significant
increase in T-cells observed after B2 in the present study suggests
that these cells may play a role in the adaptive and regenerative
processes of healthy human skeletal muscle to damaging exercise.
Indeed, recent animal studies show that T-cells play a role
in muscle regeneration by chemokine and cytokine secretion
(Zhang et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2015). A study by Malm et al.
(2000) measured no changes in infiltrating CD8+ T-cells in
healthy muscle tissue in response to a single bout of damaging
eccentric cycling exercise. The authors concluded that T-cells do
not infiltrate healthy skeletal muscle. Consistent with this study
we also did not detect a significant change in T-cell content after
a single bout of damaging exercise. However, we show that CD8+
T-cells do infiltrate healthy muscle, but only do so in appreciable
quantities after a repeated bout of damaging exercise. It may
be that an initial bout of exercise primes the muscle to more
effectively recruit T-cells that become manifest at a subsequent
bout.
Because no significant changes in MHC-1 content was
observed, the priming effect may not be mediated by increased
muscle MHC-I expression as we had suspected. However, it is
possible that damaged muscle may display peptide sequences on
MHC-I proteins that are indicative of muscle damage (damage-
specific epitope), thereby sensitizing T-cells to respond to muscle
damage by recognizing muscle damage-specific auto antigens
displayed on MHC-I without detectible changes in total MHC-
I content. This speculation provides a hypothesized mechanism
of the observation that CD8+ T-cells increased only after B2.
Another possible explanation is that T-cells were recruited to the
muscle slowly after B1, were insignificantly increased at the 27
day time point (Figure 4C), and the higher numbers of T-cells
that accumulated in the muscle pre-B2 allowed for a more rapid
T-cell expansion by proliferation, recruitment of more T-cells, or
both in response to LC of B2. Consistent with this hypothesis,
the slightly increased MHC-I content at pre-B2 (statistically
insignificant, Figure 5B) may play a role in sensitizing T-cells
for heightened responsiveness post-B2. It may be that slightly
increased MHC-I expression at this time point provided
low-affinity sub-threshold interactions with MHC-bound non-
damage-indicative peptides and the T-cells present in the tissue.
T-cells are known to interact in this way with self-peptides (a
phenomenon known as tonic stimulation). Tonic stimulation is
important for T-cell homeostasis and may render T-cells more
readily activatable upon foreign antigen exposure (Stefanová
et al., 2002). Perhaps the higher, yet statistically insignificant
increase in MHC-I at pre-B2 may have provided more tonic
stimulation and heightened the T-cell response post-B2 when,
perhaps, a damage-specific epitope was displayed on MHC-I.
Interestingly, CD8+ T-cells seemed to aggregate around
and invade necrotic muscle fibers (necrotic fibers were very
rarely observed). A representative image of this phenomenon
is shown in Figure 4B. This may suggest that T-cells promote
muscle damage by inducing muscle fiber death, or may serve

a phagocytic role following fiber damage. The interpretation
that CD8+ T-cells play a deleterious roll in muscle by
promoting muscle fiber damage is supported by the observation
that depletion of these cells significantly reduced pathologic
symptoms in murine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(Spencer et al., 2001) and dysferlinopathy (Farini et al., 2012).
However, given the present observation that CD8+ T-cells are
only significantly increased after B2 (Figure 4C) when evidence
of muscle damage was reduced (Figures 1A,B), suggests that
these cells do not exacerbate exercise-induced damage in non-
dystrophic human muscle. Rather, the present data are more
consistent with a recent rodent study, showing that CD8+ T-cells
facilitate muscle repair via MCP-1 chemokine expression, thus
assisting in the recruitment of tissue-repairing macrophages
(Zhang et al., 2014).
Study Limitations
Limitations of the present study include (1) the potential
inflammation promoting effect of the biopsy procedure, and (2)
the single 48 h sampling time point following exercise. Though
the biopsies were taken 3 days apart, studies have shown that
multiple muscle biopsies taken from the same muscle in close
proximity are capable of promoting changes in inflammatory
cytokine transcript level in subsequent biopsy samples (taken 2
days apart) independent of exercise (Van Thienen et al., 2014).
On the contrary, other studies have shown markers of damage
and inflammatory events in only the exercised, but not the rested
limbs (Mackey et al., 2008; Lauritzen et al., 2009). To reduce
the effects of the previous biopsy procedure on the measured
inflammatory markers, the post-B2 biopsy was always taken
proximal to the previous biopsy site with the needle angled away
from the previous biopsy site. This practice has been shown to
minimize inflammation-related artifact from a previous biopsy
procedure (Van Thienen et al., 2014). Moreover, we examined
cytokine concentrations at the protein level, which appears to
be far less affected by the biopsy procedure compared to mRNA
expression (Van Thienen et al., 2014). It is also not likely that the
biopsy performed prior to B2 negatively impacted LC done on the
following day. A previously published paper that used the same
subjects presently reported showed that the amount of work done
in B1 (42.3 ± 9 kJ) was not statistically different from, that done
in B2 (43.3 ± 17 kJ) (p = 0.42) (Hyldahl et al., 2015).
In order to minimize the total number of biopsies, yet assess
inflammation markers during the period of peak muscle soreness
and strength loss, we chose to sample 48 h following each bout
of LC. It is possible that changes in some of the inflammatory
markers were missed if they occurred earlier or later than
48 h after exercise. It is possible that the magnitudes of the
inflammatory response at B1 and B2 were not different early
after exercise prior to the 48 h time point, and that inflammation
post-B2 simply persisted longer.
CONCLUSIONS
The data presented here do not support the hypothesis that
blunted inflammation following a repeated bout of LC explains
the attenuated symptoms that accompany the RBE. Rather, we
observed increased inflammation in muscle tissue concomitant

Muscle Inflammation and the Repeated Bout Effect
with reduced evidence of muscle damage following B2. Moreover,
the inflammatory environment in the muscle following B2
seemed to be optimized to facilitate recruitment of immune
cells as evidenced by increased levels of chemokines MCP-1
and IP-10. Indeed, muscle-infiltrating CD68+ macrophages as
well as CD8+ T-cells were also elevated following B2 and were
significantly correlated with the content of both chemokines.
Collectively, the data suggests that in response to an initial
bout of damaging exercise the muscle becomes more effective at
recruiting immune cells following a repeated bout of LCs and
that these cells may facilitate accelerated repair to the muscle
and thereby contribute to the RBE. This study also provides
the first observation that CD8+ T-cells may be involved in the
adaptive processes of healthy human skeletal muscle in response
to a repeated bout of damaging exercise. Lastly, the increases in
CD8+ T-cells were seen in the absence of significant increases
in MHC-I.
