BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to reduce nonmedical opioid misuse, little is known about the 
development of persistent opioid use after surgery among adolescents and young adults. 
We hypothesized that there is an increased incidence of prolonged opioid refills among 
adolescents and young adults who received prescription opioids after surgery compared 
with nonsurgical patients.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study by using commercial claims from the 
Truven Health Marketscan research databases from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. 
We included opioid-naïve patients ages 13 to 21 years who underwent 1 of 13 operations. A 
random sample of 3% of nonsurgical patients who matched eligibility criteria was included 
as a comparison. Our primary outcome was persistent opioid use, which was defined as ≥1 
opioid prescription refill between 90 and 180 days after the surgical procedure.
RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 60.5% filled a postoperative opioid prescription (88 637 
patients). Persistent opioid use was found in 4.8% of patients (2.7%–15.2% across 
procedures) compared with 0.1% of those in the nonsurgical group. Cholecystectomy 
(adjusted odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.26) and colectomy (adjusted 
odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–5.34) were associated with the highest risk 
of persistent opioid use. Independent risk factors included older age, female sex, previous 
substance use disorder, chronic pain, and preoperative opioid fill.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent opioid use after surgery is a concern among adolescents and young 
adults and may represent an important pathway to prescription opioid misuse. Identifying 
safe, evidence-based practices for pain management is a top priority, particularly among 
at-risk patients.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Opioid-related 
morbidity and mortality among US adolescents and 
young adults continues to rise. Postoperative opioid 
prescriptions vary widely and are often in excess 
among children and adults. Postoperative care is 
an important risk factor for prolonged opioid use 
among adults.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: This study is the first to 
investigate persistent opioid use among adolescents 
and young adults after surgery. This study highlights 
the need for safe prescribing and monitoring habits 
in the postoperative setting to prevent long-term 
addiction, misuse, and adverse effects.

 Since the 1990s, opioid prescribing 
and use have increased dramatically 
across all age groups in the United 
States, resulting in a major, national 
public health problem.1 
– 
3 Among 
adolescents, self-reported rates 
of medical and nonmedical opioid 
use have only recently begun to 
decline, which is likely a result of 
increased awareness4; yet, rates of 
serious adverse events secondary to 
prescription opioid misuse continue 
to rise.5, 
 
6 Hospitalizations from 
prescription opioid use and heroin 
use from 1997 to 2012 within this 
age group have risen by 175% and 
161%, respectively.5 Adolescents 
have a 3- to 5-times greater risk for 
serious medical outcomes when 
presenting for care with opioid 
exposure, such as life-threatening 
symptoms or death, than children in 
any other age group.6
Prescription opioids remain an 
important analgesic for treating 
postoperative acute pain, and 
surgical care is 1 of the most common 
medical encounters associated 
with opioid prescription.7 Yet, 
postoperative opioid prescribing 
often varies widely and results  
in excess among both children  
and adults, even after minor  
procedures.8 
–11 Recent studies have 
demonstrated that postoperative care  
is an important risk factor for prolonged 
opioid use among adults.7, 
 
12 
– 
14  
For example, among opioid-naïve 
adults undergoing major and minor 
elective surgical procedures, rates  
of prolonged opioid use are 
estimated to range from 3% to 10% 
and are more pronounced among 
adults with coexisting medical and 
mental health conditions.7, 
 
13, 
 
15  
Prescription opioids have a high 
potential for misuse and adverse 
effects, particularly among 
adolescents and young adults, who 
may be more vulnerable than adults 
because of changes in the reward 
and habit formation centers of the 
brain15 
–17; however, little is known 
about prescription opioid misuse 
after acute exposure in the surgical 
setting in this age group.
In this retrospective study, we 
examined the incidence of prolonged 
opioid refills as a surrogate for 
persistent opioid use after surgery 
among 88 637 patients ages 13 to 
21 years in the United States. We 
further examined the contribution 
of demographic, comorbid, and 
mental health conditions to the 
risk of persistent opioid use among 
adolescents and young adults. We 
hypothesized that persistent opioid 
use among adolescent and young 
adult patients would be similar to 
previously described rates among 
adult patients after common surgical 
procedures.
MethODs
This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board at the 
University of Michigan. We examined 
insurance claims from all patients 
ages 13 to 21 years who underwent 
1 of 13 inpatient or outpatient 
surgical procedures identified by 
Current Procedural Terminology 
(CPT) codes from January 1, 2010, to 
December 31, 2014, by using Truven 
Health Marketscan, a national data 
set of employer-based insurance 
claims. The procedures from 
across pediatric surgical specialties 
included tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy, inguinal hernia 
(open or laparoscopic), umbilical or 
epigastric hernia, appendectomy, 
cholecystectomy, pectus repair 
(open or minimally invasive), 
colectomy (open or laparoscopic), 
open supracondylar fracture 
fixation, open epicondylar fracture 
fixation, posterior arthrodesis, 
arthroscopic knee repair (anterior 
cruciate ligament [ACL] and/or 
meniscus), orchiopexy (open or 
laparoscopic), and hypospadias 
repair (Supplemental Table 1). 
Patients undergoing selected 
surgical procedures were included 
if they met the following criteria: 
(1) had continuous insurance 
coverage during the 12 months 
before the procedure through the 6 
months after, (2) did not undergo 
an additional surgical procedure 
or anesthesia during the 6 months 
after the procedure, and (3) were 
opioid naïve without any previous 
opioid prescription fills during 
the 11 months before the 30-day 
period before the procedure.13 
For all further analyses, we 
included patients with at least 1 
opioid prescription fill during the 
perioperative period, which was 
defined as 30 days before to 2 weeks 
after the procedure.13
For a comparison cohort of patients 
who did not undergo surgery, we 
identified a random sample of 3% of 
the 2 968 832 nonsurgical patients 
ages 13 to 21 years in the Truven 
Health Marketscan during the study 
period (n = 110 432). Patients in 
the control group were assigned a 
random, fictitious surgery date, and 
the 3 inclusion criteria, including 
continuous insurance coverage, no 
additional procedures, and opioid-
naïve status, were applied.13, 
 
14 We 
examined patient-level covariates, 
including age, sex, and comorbidities 
(as defined by Feudtner’s complex 
chronic condition codes [CCCCs]), 
18 
mental health diagnoses (depression, 
anxiety, and substance use disorder 
[SUD]), 
13 and chronic pain diagnoses 
identified with International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) codes in the 12 
months preceding the surgery date 
among surgical and nonsurgical 
patients. Pediatric pain diagnoses 
were verified as chronic according  
to the Agency for Healthcare 
Research, the quality Chronic 
Condition Indicator, and by the ICD-9. 
 
Any chronic pain diagnoses that 
were secondary to chronic medical 
conditions captured in the CCCC were 
excluded (Supplemental Table 4).18, 
 
19 
 
For colectomy, we also examined 
surgical indication as the primary 
diagnosis for hospitalization.

 Opioid prescriptions from pharmacy 
claims were identified by matching 
generic drug names with National 
Drug Codes, which detail specific 
drug doses and types. For each 
prescription, we converted the unit of 
the opioid component to milligrams 
and calculated oral morphine 
equivalents (OMEs) for each unit 
by using standard published 
conversions for the morphine 
equivalent conversion factor per 
milligram.20 The OME dosage for each 
individual opioid prescription that 
was filled was calculated as the unit 
OME exposure multiplied by the total 
quantity filled in this prescription 
and was reported as total OME per 
initial prescription. A dose of >100 
OMEs per day has previously been 
defined as a possible marker of 
potential misuse or inappropriate 
prescribing patterns21; thus, the 
proportion of the cohort with initial 
high daily dosage was also calculated.
Our primary outcome, persistent 
opioid use after surgery, was defined 
as 1 or more additional opioid 
prescription(s) filled between 90 
and 180 days after the procedure 
and was defined a priori before data 
extraction.7, 
 
13 The time frame was 
based on the definition from the 
International Association for the 
Study of Pain, 
22 which defines long-
term postsurgical pain as pain that 
is persistent beyond 3 months after 
surgical intervention. Univariate 
descriptive statistics were used to 
characterize the common attributes 
of postoperative prescriptions 
among adolescents and young adults 
undergoing surgery, including 
daily and total OMEs for each 
postoperative month and patient 
characteristics. A multivariate logistic 
regression model was estimated to 
examine differences in persistent 
opioid use between surgical types 
and controlled for patient age, sex, 
CCCCs, mental health diagnoses, 
and chronic pain diagnoses. To 
obtain a parsimonious model, a 
stepwise logistic regression (P < .3 
for inclusion) was used to identify 
relevant patient characteristics as 
control variables in the final model. 
All analyses were conducted by using 
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC).
Results
We identified 146 588 opioid-naïve 
patients during the study period who 
underwent surgery between 2010 
and 2014. Among these patients, 
60.5% (88 637) filled a prescription 
from 30 days before to 2 weeks after 
the operation (Fig 1), and 29.3% 
(25 951) filled multiple prescriptions 
during this period. Prescriptions 
were filled in the postoperative 
period only by 80.7% (71 511) of 
surgical patients, in the preoperative 
period only by 9.0% (7953), and 
in both the pre- and postoperative 
periods by 10.4% (9173) of patients. 
The control cohort included 
110 432 opioid-naïve comparison 
patients, and the demographics of 
the 2 cohorts are shown in Table 1. 
Opioid-naïve surgical patients who 
filled perioperative prescriptions 
were 54.4% women with an average 
age of 17 ± 2.4 years. The most 
common procedures among the 
surgical cohort were tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy (35.9%), 
arthroscopic knee repair (25.3%), 
and appendectomy (18.6%). Among 
46 patients undergoing colectomy, 
the indications for surgery included 
inflammatory bowel disease  
(22 patients), benign neoplasm  
(11 patients), constipation  
(6 patients), ischemia (3 patients), 
malignancy of the cecum (1 patient), 
and unspecified (3 patients).
Among these patients, persistent 
opioid use was found in 4.8% (4267 
patients), ranging from 2.7% to 
15.2% across surgical procedures 
(Fig 2). By comparison, 53 patients 
(0.1%) in the nonsurgical comparison 
group filled an opioid prescription 
during the analogous time period. 
Among the 57 951 patients who 
did not fill a perioperative opioid 
prescription, 1.1% (616 patients) 
filled an opioid prescription between 
3 and 6 months after surgery.
 
Table 2 presents the patient and 
procedural factors associated with 
persistent opioid use. Prolonged 
opioid refill was most often 
associated with cholecystectomy 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.13; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.26) 
and colectomy (aOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 
1.01–5.34). Risk factors that were 
independently associated with new 
persistent opioid use included older 
age (aOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05–1.08), 
female sex (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14–
1.31), past-year SUD (aOR, 1.41; 95% 
CI, 1.12–1.77), chronic pain diagnosis 
(aOR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33–1.66), and 
opioid prescription filled within 30 
days before surgery (aOR, 1.26; 95% 
CI, 1.17–1.36).

Downloaded from 
 among adolescents and young 
adults undergoing surgery, we next 
examined variation in the total OMEs 
of the initial postoperative opioid 
prescription by box-and-whisker 
plot and excluding outliers (Fig 3). 
The procedures with the 3 highest 
initial median total OMEs were 
posterior arthrodesis (median, 450 
OMEs; mean, 695.7 OMEs; 95% CI, 
0.20–1500 OMEs), pectus repair 
(median, 450 OMEs; mean, 776.1 
OMEs; 95% CI, 0.20–2100 OMEs), 
and supracondylar fracture fixation 
(median, 375 OMEs; mean, 7400.3 
OMEs; 95% CI 0.22–1000 OMEs). 
Evaluating for high daily dosage, 
there were 6317 patients (7.1%) 
with >100 OMEs daily on the initial 
postoperative prescription.
To look at dose trends over time, we 
calculated the average total OMEs per 
refill and SD among persistent opioid 
users as a function of postoperative 
month. As shown in Fig 4, there 
was an initial peak with the first 
postoperative opioid prescription 
(mean, 609.0 OMEs; 95% CI, 446.7–
771.4 OMEs). Total OMEs per refill 
decreased to 347.0 OMEs (95% CI, 
277.1–416.9 OMEs) by postoperative 
month 3 and further decreased to 
248.6 OMEs (95% CI, 188.3–308.9 
OMEs) at postoperative month 4, 
276.2 OMEs (95% CI, 140.4–412.1 
OMEs) at postoperative month 5, and 
200.9 OMEs (95% CI 177.7–224.1 
OMEs) at postoperative month 6.
DIscussIOn
In this national cohort of 88 637 
patients ages 13 to 21 years, we 
observed that ∼5% of the past-year 
opioid-naïve patients filled opioid 
prescriptions >90 days after surgery. 
The incidence of persistent opioid use 
during this time period ranged from 
2.7% to 15.2% across procedures 
but was not entirely related to 
the magnitude or type of surgical 
procedure alone. Furthermore, 
patients with persistent opioid use 
filled additional opioid prescriptions 
of substantial quantity, with an 
average prescription of 200 to 300 
OMEs up to 6 months after surgery. 
To place this in the context of the 
most commonly prescribed opioid 
analgesics in the United States, this 
is equivalent to refills of 40 tablets 
of hydrocodone (5 mg tablets) or 26 
tablets of oxycodone (5 mg tablets) 
at 6 months after surgery. These 
findings raise concern that acute 
exposure to opioids for postoperative 
pain management may be associated 
with a risk of long-term use for a 
significant number of adolescents 
and young adults.
Certain procedures, such as 
cholecystectomy and colectomy, were 
associated with persistent opioid 
use; in contrast, other procedures 
that commonly result in high 
levels of postoperative pain, such 
as spinal fusion and pectus repair, 
showed no higher risk of persistent 
opioid use than the reference 
group (appendectomy). Because 
cholecystectomy and colectomy 
may be related to high levels of 
preoperative pain and inflammation 
with potential for visceral and central

Downloaded from 
 sensitization, it is possible that this 
finding is related to pain that failed to 
resolve despite surgery or that these 
factors may predispose the patient to 
long-term pain. Patient-level factors, 
such as past-year SUD, chronic 
pain diagnoses, and preoperative 
opioid fill, had a highly significant 
association with persistent opioid 
use at 3 to 6 months after surgery. 
This points toward the multifactorial 
etiology of postoperative pain and 
its complex nature in both the 
short- and long-term. Future work is 
needed to elucidate the mechanism 
that underlies new persistent opioid 
use after certain procedures and 
better understand the efficacy of 
multimodal pharmacologic and 
nonpharmacologic pain management 
approaches to ameliorate patient- 
and procedure-specific risk factors.
To date, the extent to which 
prolonged postoperative opioid use 
confers increased risk of subsequent 
opioid misuse and dependence is 
debated, although previous work 
has demonstrated that early onset 
of nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids is associated with increased 
risk of developing subsequent 
opioid abuse and other SUD later 
in life.23, 
 
24 Although the medical 
use of prescription opioids alone in 
adolescence has not been associated 
with an increased risk of SUD later in 
life, a significant association between 
medical use of prescription opioids 
alone in adolescence and subsequent 
nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids was observed at age 35 years 
(aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.10–2.76).25 In 
addition, any nonmedical use (with 
or without concomitant medical use) 
in adolescence increased the odds of 
nonmedical use (aOR, 2.1–3.2) and 
SUD symptoms (aOR, 1.5–2.6) at age 
35 years.25 The majority of US high 
school seniors with both medical use 
and nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids reported medical use 
before initiating nonmedical use 
of prescription opioids, suggesting 
a role of leftover prescriptions in 
the transition to a nonmedical use 
of prescription opioids.4 This may 
be due, in part, to the perception 
that prescription opioids are safe if 
they are prescribed by physicians 
despite the fact that the addiction 
potential is similar to heroin. In the 
Monitoring the Future study, 73% of 
eighth-graders among a nationally 
representative sample perceived an 
occasional use of heroin as high risk 
compared with 26% who perceived 
an occasional use of Vicodin and 
33% who perceived an occasional 
use of OxyContin as high risk.26 They 
may be more to prone to use these 
medications, which are perceived as 
a pain medication, for themselves or

aside from those for which they were 
prescribed.
Our study is the first in which 
researchers evaluated persistent 
opioid use after surgical care in the 
adolescent and young adult age 
group, although our study has several 
notable limitations. First, although 
our findings do not reflect actual 
opioid consumption after pediatric 
surgical procedures, we captured 
opioid dispensing by pharmacy fills. 
It is likely that if refills are provided, 
the medication has been consumed, 
stored for later use, or diverted to 
an unintended user. Furthermore, 
it represents 1 of the first objective 
reports of opioid exposure among 
adolescents and young adults. The 
majority of existing data are drawn 
from self-reporting, which may be 
discordant to actual use.27, 
 
28 For 
example, 37% of high school seniors 
who reported past-year nonmedical 
use of Vicodin did not report past-
year nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids on the same survey.28 
Second, because of the administrative 
nature of the database, we were 
unable to identify the indications 
for prescription refills or link refills 
to chronic postsurgical pain or 
opioid use disorder. However, the 
higher incidence of new persistent 
use among postsurgical patients 
with opioid exposure compared 
with controls and those without 
opioid exposure raises concern that 
perioperative opioid prescribing 
may prime the patients for future 
opioid use for any cause and increase 
the quantity of prescription opioids 
that are accessible to the patient 
and community. Finally, our study is 
limited to a population of dependents 
of individuals with employer-
based insurance and may not be 
generalizable to patients without 
insurance or those with exclusively 
state or federal health care coverage, 
such as Medicare or Medicaid 
programs. Of children, ∼37% are 
insured by the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program or Medicaid 
programs29 and will be an important 
population cohort to evaluate in the 
future.
Despite these limitations, our 
findings have important implications 
for future efforts with regard to 
perioperative prescribing for the 
adolescent and young adult age group.  
Our findings echo those of recent 
studies of adult populations7,

in observing an increase in long-
term opioid use after new opioid 
prescriptions in both the general 
population and postoperative 
settings. Yet, these results must be 
taken with specific regard to the age 
of this young cohort, contributing 
to an even greater overall, lifetime 
risk for chronic opioid use and its 
downstream effects. It is concerning 
not only that patients may be 
requesting prescription opioids for 
prolonged periods after surgery but 
also that providers are continuing to 
prescribe opioids. Recent guidelines 
suggest limiting the reliance

 on opioids for treating chronic 
noncancer pain; however, evidence-
based guidelines for postoperative 
opioid prescribing and monitoring 
in children and self-administering 
adolescents and young adults are 
limited or primarily adapted from 
adult dosing despite recent studies 
suggesting overprescribing after 
surgery.8, 
 
33– 
35 Future work must 
be aimed at identifying in what 
settings (surgery clinic, emergency 
department, primary care clinic, etc) 
these prescriptions are being obtained. 
This will allow guidelines to be 
effectively targeted at the highest-yield 
audience to optimize acute and chronic 
postoperative pain management.
Opioids are highly effective for acute 
postoperative pain relief; however, 
our findings offer new evidence 
that prolonged perioperative opioid 
refills may be placing vulnerable 
adolescent and young adult patients 
and their local communities at 
a higher risk than previously 
appreciated. Prescription drug use in 
an unmonitored setting by a patient 
who is not familiar with dosing and 
side effect profiles may place the 
user at undue risk even if the drug 
is used without recreational intent.

This has been highlighted by rises 
in the most serious prescription 
opioid–related adverse outcomes 
among adolescents despite declining 
overall use over the last 5 years.4 
– 
6 As 
a result of this work, we may better 
identify those patients who are at 
the highest risk for new persistent 
opioid use, such as adolescents 
and young adults with past-year 
SUD and chronic pain conditions. 
Importantly, we are not suggesting 
that patients should be prescribed 
fewer opioid pain medications on the 
basis of preexisting diagnoses nor 
that pain should be underappreciated 
and undertreated. Instead, we 
recommend that all providers 
should screen for preexisting risk 
factors to identify those who may 
require increased monitoring and 
intervention for the patient’s safety. 
Furthermore, this emphasizes the 
need for multimodal analgesic 
techniques to control pain and avoid 
unnecessary opioid exposure when 
feasible. It is our responsibility as 
providers to identify evidence-based 
strategies for safe postoperative 
prescribing, appropriate patient 
and parent education, and proper 
disposal avenues for unused 
medications with the intent to 
improve surgical quality and prevent 
opioid-associated morbidity and 
mortality.
cOnclusIOns
Among a cohort of past-year opioid-
naïve adolescents and young adults, 
∼5% filled opioid prescriptions 
>3 months after surgery. Certain 
procedural and patient risk factors 
are associated with persistent 
postoperative opioid use among 
adolescents and young adults. 
Understanding these risks may help 
clinicians to strategize methods to 
minimize opioid exposure for those 
at the highest risk for later misuse.
