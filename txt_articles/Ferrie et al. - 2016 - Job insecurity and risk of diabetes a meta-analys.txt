T
he increasing use of temporary contracts, 
zero-hours contracts and other forms of 
flexible employment have made job inse-
curity a feature of much previously secure 
employment in high-income countries.1 In addi-
tion to impacts on social circumstances, the health 
consequences of job insecurity are becoming rec-
ognized.2 Most evidence to date has relied on self-
reported health outcomes, such as mental and 
physical health symptoms.3–5 In addition, an asso-
ciation has been reported between job insecurity 
and cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipid-
emia and weight gain,6 and a recent meta-analysis 
of individual data for 170 000 workers showed an 
association between job insecurity and clinically 
verified incident coronary events.7
The prevalence of diabetes has increased 
steadily over recent decades, mostly owing to rising 
rates of overweight and obesity, and aging popula-
tions.8,9 There is indirect evidence to suggest an 
association between job insecurity and incident dia-
betes because previous work has shown an associa-
tion between job insecurity and a subsequent 
increase in body mass index (BMI).6 A high BMI, 
in turn, is a strong risk factor for diabetes.10,11 How-
ever, a comprehensive search of the literature

Background: Job insecurity has been associ-
ated with certain health outcomes. We exam-
ined the role of job insecurity as a risk factor 
for incident diabetes.
Methods: We used individual participant data 
from 8 cohort studies identified in 2 open-ac-
cess data archives and 11 cohort studies partici-
pating in the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-
analysis in Working Populations Consortium. 
We calculated study-specific estimates of the 
association between job insecurity reported at 
baseline and incident diabetes over the follow-
up period. We pooled the estimates in a meta-
analysis to produce a summary risk estimate.
Results: The 19 studies involved 140 825 partic-
ipants from Australia, Europe and the United 
States, with a mean follow-up of 9.4 years and 
3954 incident cases of diabetes. In the prelimi-
nary analysis adjusted for age and sex, high 
job insecurity was associated with an increased 
risk of incident diabetes compared with low 
job insecurity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.30). In the 
multivariable-adjusted analysis restricted to 15 
studies with baseline data for all covariates 
(age, sex, socioeconomic status, obesity, physi-
cal activity, alcohol and smoking), the associa-
tion was slightly attenuated (adjusted OR 1.12, 
95% CI 1.01–1.24). Heterogeneity between the 
studies was low to moderate (age- and sex-
adjusted model: I2 = 24%, p = 0.2; multivari-
able-adjusted model: I2 = 27%, p = 0.2). In the 
multivariable-adjusted analysis restricted to 
high-quality studies, in which the diabetes 
diagnosis was ascertained from electronic 
medical records or clinical examination, the 
association was similar to that in the main 
analysis (adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04–1.35).
Interpretation: Our findings suggest that self-
reported job insecurity is associated with a mod-
est increased risk of incident diabetes. Health 
care personnel should be aware of this associa-
tion among workers reporting job insecurity.

(Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150942/-/DC1) revealed 
no published studies examining the association 
between job insecurity and diabetes.
To address this gap in the literature, we under-
took a meta-analysis of individual participant data 
from 8 cohort studies identified in 2 open-access 
data archives and 11 cohort studies from the Indi-
vidual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working 
Populations Consortium (IPD-Work Consortium). 
This approach allowed us to quantify the prospec-
tive association between job insecurity and sub-
sequent incident diabetes in a large data set that 
included a wide variety of workers and countries.
Methods
Study population
We used individual-level data on job insecurity 
and incident diabetes for participants in 19 pro-
spective cohort studies. Eight studies had open-
access data and were identified from collections at 
the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and 
Social Research (www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/
ICPSR) and the UK Data Service (http://
ukdataservice.ac.uk/).12–19 Six of these studies 
involved general population samples.12–17 The 
other 2 included random samples of graduates 
from Wisconsin high schools and their siblings.18,19 
The other 11 were European cohort studies20–30 
participating in the IPD-Work Consortium.31 Four 
of the 11 studies included general population sam-
ples,20–22,24 and the rest involved either workers in 
the public sector or employees in private compa-
nies.23,25–30 Further details about the studies are 
available in Appendix 2 (www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150942/-/DC1).
For our meta-analysis, we included all wo-
men and men from the cohort studies who were 
in employment and free of diabetes at baseline 
and for whom complete data on job insecurity 
were available.
Measurement of job insecurity
Job insecurity was measured once at baseline in 
all 19 studies (Table 1). In the 8 studies from the 
open-access data sets, a question was asked about 
the level of insecurity in the person’s current job 
or about satisfaction with job security. In the other 
11 studies, a question was asked about the level of 
insecurity in the person’s current job or about fear 
of layoff or unemployment. In all of the studies, 
the exposure was dichotomized into high or low 
job insecurity, as described previously.7
Outcome measure
The primary outcome was incident diabetes. The 
8 studies from the open-access data sets defined 
incident diabetes over the follow-up period as 
the first self-report of diabetes. Of the 11 studies 
from the IPD-Work Consortium, the Whitehall II 
study32 used the gold-standard World Health 
Organization criteria (a 75-g oral glucose toler-
ance test, with diabetes defined as a fasting glu-
cose level of at least 7.0 mmol/L, or a 2-hour 
post-load glucose level of at least 11.1 mmol/L, 
except for patients who had physician-diagnosed 
diabetes or who were using diabetes medica-
tion). The other studies from IPD-Work Consor-
tium defined incident diabetes as the first record 
of diabetes, diagnosed according to the Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems 10th Revision code 
E11. This information was collected from hospi-
tal admission, hospital discharge and mortality 
registers that had a mention of diabetes in any of 
the diagnostic codes. In addition, in the Finnish 
studies,23,24,27 participants were defined as having 
incident diabetes the first time they were eligible 
for diabetes medication in the national drug 
reimbursement register. The date of diabetes 
diagnosis was defined as the date of the first 
record in any of the above-mentioned sources 
over the study follow-up period.
Participants with evidence of prevalent diabe-
tes at baseline were excluded. Prevalent diabetes 
was defined on the basis of information from any 
of the following: hospital records, baseline oral 
glucose tolerance test results, self-report from 
the baseline questionnaire or drug reimburse-
ment register (Finnish studies only).
Assessment of covariates
Confounders of the association between job in-
security and incident diabetes include age, sex, 
socioeconomic position, obesity, and reporting 
or common-method bias for studies in which 
both exposure and outcome are self-reported. 
We were able to obtain the following data from 
almost all of the studies: participants’ age, sex, 
socioeconomic status (based on participants’ high-
est occupational grade or educational qualification 
and classified as low, intermediate or high) and 
obesity (defined as a BMI above 30). Other risk 
factors for diabetes, which may be associated with 
job insecurity and so act as potential confounders 
of the association, were physical activity (low, 
intermediate or high), smoking (current, former or 
never) and alcohol use (none, moderate, intermedi-
ate or heavy); these risk factors were similarly pre-
defined and harmonized across the studies. 
Data were not available on obesity from 2 
studies;14,27 on alcohol use from 1 study;26 and on 
obesity, physical activity and alcohol use from 
another study.20 These 4 studies were excluded 
from the multivariable-adjusted models.

Statistical analysis
Our analyses included 19 prospective cohort 
studies in which job insecurity was measured 
once at baseline and subsequent incident dia-
betes was measured over the follow-up period. 
Because not all of the studies included an exact 
date of diabetes diagnosis, we used logistic 
regression in all studies to calculate study-
specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) as the measure of association 
between job insecurity and subsequent incident 
diabetes.33
Meta-analysis was used to produce a common 
risk estimate.34 Because there was no significant 
heterogeneity between the study-specific esti-
mates, we conducted the meta-analyses using 
fixed-effect models. Heterogeneity of the study-
specific estimates was examined using the I2 statis-
tic (higher values denote greater heterogeneity).35
In the preliminary analysis, we calculated age- 
and sex-adjusted study-specific effect estimates of 
the association between job insecurity and inci-
dent diabetes. In the main analysis, we used multi-
variable models that were further adjusted for 
socioeconomic status, obesity, physical activity, 
alcohol use and smoking. To examine whether the 
association between job insecurity and incident 
diabetes differed between subgroups of studies 
and participants, we stratified the analyses by 
method of diabetes diagnosis (self-reported, elec-
tronic medical records or clinical examination), 
study quality (assessed as low or high using the 
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for cohort studies,36 see 
Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
150942/-/DC1), age 
(< 50 yr or ≥ 50 yr), sex, socioeconomic status 
(low, intermediate or high) and study location 
(Europe or United States).
We used Stata/MP version 13.1 (StataCorp) to 
analyze data from the open-access data archives 
and to compute the results of all the meta-
analyses. We used SAS version 9.2 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc.) to analyze study-specific data from the 
IPD-Work studies.
Results
Sample characteristics
The 8 studies from the open-access data sets 
included a total of 44 770 working women and 
men with data on age, sex, socioeconomic status, 
job insecurity and diabetes. The 11 studies from 
the IPD-Work Consortium included a further 
96 055 working women and men with suitable 
data, bringing the total study population to 
140 825 (mean age 42.2 yr; 81 816 [58.1%] 
women) (Table 2). Overall, 3954 incident cases 
of diabetes occurred over a mean follow-up of 
9.4 (range 4.0–21.1) years. Although 2 studies 
were started in 1986,12,27 baseline assessment for 
the remaining studies was between 1991 and 
2009. Studies were from Australia, Denmark, 
Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the 
US (Table 1, Appendix 2). 
Association between job insecurity 
and incident diabetes
The prevalence of high job insecurity ranged 
from 6.3% to 40.3% (Table 1). The mean inci-
dence of diabetes per 10 000 person-years 
ranged from 9.0 to 85.2 (Table 2).
Age- and sex-adjusted estimates of the associ-
ation between job insecurity and incident dia-
betes for the 19 studies are presented in Fig-
ure 1A. The multivariable-adjusted analyses, 
additionally adjusted for socioeconomic status, 
obesity, physical activity, alcohol use and smok-
ing, are presented in Figure 1B for the 15 stud-
ies with data on all covariates (n = 108 525; 
2850 incident diabetes cases). 
High job insecurity at baseline was associated 
with an increased risk of diabetes in the age- and 
sex-adjusted analysis compared with low job 
insecurity (pooled OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09–1.30). 
The effect was attenuated in the multivariable-
adjusted analysis but remained statistically signif-
icant (pooled OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.24). Het-
erogeneity between the study-specific estimates 
was low to moderate (age- and sex-adjusted anal-
ysis: I2 = 24%, p = 0.2; multivariable-adjusted 
analysis: I2 = 27%, p = 0.2). Sequential adjust-
ment of the association between job insecurity 
and incident diabetes for socioeconomic status 
and the lifestyle covariates are presented in 
Appendix 4 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150942/-/DC1).
The results of the subgroup analyses are 
shown in Figure 2. We found no statistically sig-
nificant differences in the association between 
job insecurity and incident diabetes in the multi-
variable-adjusted analyses when stratified by 
method of diabetes diagnosis, study quality, age, 
sex, socioeconomic status or study location 
(p value > 0.1 for all subgroup differences). Odds 
ratios for the subgroups divided by diagnosis 
method and study quality were identical because 
the diagnosis of diabetes is a key feature of high-
quality (electronic medical records or clinical 
 
examination [oral glucose tolerance test]) and 
low-quality (self-report) studies. Although the 
correlation between diabetes identified by self-
report and medical records is relatively high37 and 
the difference between the high- and low-quality 
studies was not statistically significant, these 
analyses provide stronger evidence in support of 
an association between job insecurity and inci-

dent diabetes in the high-quality studies (pooled 
OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04–1.35).
Loss to follow-up ranged from less than 5% 
to 34%, and length of follow-up from 4 to 21 
years (Appendix 2), but neither factor had an 
effect on the association between job insecurity 
and incident diabetes (Appendix 4). The rate of 
unemployment at baseline varied from 4.6% to 
11.3% (Appendix 2), but there was no evidence 
that the association between job insecurity and 
incident diabetes differed between the cohorts 
(Appendix 4).
Interpretation
In our meta-analysis of individual-level data 
from 19 prospective cohort studies involving 
more than 140 000 participants and close to 4000 
incident cases of diabetes, we observed a 19% 
increase in the age- and sex-adjusted odds of in-
cident diabetes among workers who reported 
high levels of job insecurity. In the 15 studies 
with complete covariate data, the multivariable-
adjusted association was attenuated to 12%, but 
it remained statistically significant. Most of this 
attenuation resulted from adjustment for the 
lower socioeconomic status among the workers 
who reported job insecurity.
Because we were unable to find previous 
studies, either cross-sectional or longitudinal, 
that examined the association between job inse-
curity and incident diabetes, our study appears to 
be the first to report on this association. Our find-
ings are congruent with those from studies show-
ing an association between job insecurity and 
weight gain,6 a risk factor for diabetes, and be-
tween job insecurity and incident coronary artery 
disease,7 a complication of diabetes. In the latter 
meta-analysis of cohort studies from the IPD-
Work Consortium,7 employees who reported job 
insecurity had a 19% increase in the multivari-
able-adjusted odds of incident myocardial infarc-

tion or coronary death. The strength of the asso-
ciation was the same as for incident diabetes in 
high-quality studies in the current analysis.
Limitations
Our study needs to be considered in view of sev-
eral limitations. Although we were able to adjust 
our analyses for age, sex, socioeconomic status 
and obesity at baseline, data on other potential 
confounders and mediators, such as anxiety and 
weight gain over the follow-up period, were not 
available in most of the data sets. 
We cannot claim that our analysis included 
all possible data. However, we were able to in-
clude a large, diverse sample of workers from 
19 well-characterized prospective cohort stud-
ies that together cover the US, Australia and 
several European countries. Therefore, our find-
ings are likely to apply more widely to workers 
in other high-income countries.
Job insecurity was measured with the use of 
single questions that were not uniform across the 
studies. In common parlance, job insecurity is 
understood to refer to employed workers who feel 
threatened by unemployment, a broad concept 
around which the single-item measures in our 
meta-analyses appear to coalesce.38,39 Low to mod-
erate heterogeneity, as indicated by the I2 statistics 
suggests effects that differ little between the stud-
ies. However, the use of single, rather than multi-
item questionnaires at one point in time only to 
measure job insecurity may result in an underesti-
mation of the association between job insecurity 
and health-related outcomes,40 a limitation which 
may also apply to our study. Previous work has 
also shown that chronic or repeated exposure to 
job insecurity is more harmful to health than expo-
sure to job insecurity at one point in time.41
Ascertainment of diabetes varied between the 
studies. Only the Whitehall II study administered 
a repeated oral glucose tolerance test, the gold 
standard. This enabled the study to detect both 
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. The remain-
ing studies, based on health records or self-

reports, will have missed undiagnosed diabetes 
cases. In Whitehall II, the age and sex-adjusted 
odds ratio for the association between job insecu-
rity and diabetes was 1.19; the same as the overall 
estimate for all the studies (1.19).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that self-reported job inse-
curity is associated with a modest increased risk 
of incident diabetes. These findings are most ap-
propriately interpreted in a public health context 
in which small long-term effects on common 
disease outcomes can have high relevance. Ide-
ally in such situations, policy responses should 
take a population-level approach to reducing ex-
posure to job insecurity. Also, health care per-
sonnel should be aware of that workers report-
ing job insecurity may be at modest increased 
risk of diabetes.
