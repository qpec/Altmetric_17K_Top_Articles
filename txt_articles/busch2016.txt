Burn scars remain a serious physical and psychological problem for the affected people.
Clinical studies as well as basic scientific research have shown that medical needling can
significantly increase the quality of burn scars with comparatively low risk and stress for the
patient with regards to skin elasticity, moisture, erythema and transepidermal water loss.
However, medical needling has no influence on repigmentation of large hypopigmented
scars.
The goal of this study is to evaluate whether two established methods – needling
(for improvement of scar quality) and non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (for
repigmentation) – can be successfully combined.
Twenty subjects with mean age of 33 years (6–60 years) with scars from deep second
and third degree burns have been treated. The average treated surface area was 94 cm2
(15–250 cm2) and was focused on prominent areas such as the face, neck, chest and arm.
Percutaneous collagen induction or ‘‘medical needling’’ was performed using a roller
covered with 3 mm long needles. The roller is vertically, horizontally and diagonally rolled
over the scar, inducing microtrauma. Then, non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension
(NCASCS) was produced and applied using the ReNovaCell Autologous Cell Harvesting
Device (Avita Medical), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The patients were followed 12 months postoperatively. Pigmentation changes were
measured objectively, as well as with patient and observer ratings. Patient satisfaction/
preference was also obtained.
Taken together, the pigmentation ratings and objective measures indicate individual
improvement in 17 of the study participants. The melanin increases seen 12 months after
NCASCS treatment are statistically significant.
Medical needling in combination with NCASCS shows promise for repigmentation of
burn cars.

Introduction
Approximately 11 million people worldwide each year suffer
from burns receiving medical treatment [1]. Due to improve-
ments in medical practice and research, the mortality rate
after burns has decreased significantly over the last decades
[2]. More people with deep and extensive burns survive their
injury. There is a corresponding increase of long term
consequences like scarring, and patients frequently request
treatment to improve scar quality, such as textural problems
or pigmentation.
Melanocyte death, melanogenesis distruption, weakened
paracrine signaling between melanocytes and other skin cells
all 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
affect 
skin 
pigmentation 
[3].
Dyspigmentation of burn scars is therefore a common
consequence after partial and full thickness burns [4].
Additionally, the scar tissue itself may present a barrier for
melanin transfer and melanocyte migration [5]. Physical
changes like higher sensitivity for sunburns [6] and psycho-
logical impairments also affect the patients, as conspicuous
scars are a frequent reminder of traumatic situations [7].
Currently, 
numerous 
methods 
are 
available 
to 
treat
hypopigmented skin, such as split skin grafting [8], lasers [9]
and cultured skin cell transplantation [10]. In recent years,
research focused additionally on the use of non-cultured skin
cell suspension (NCASCS). Although the primary objective
when using NCASCS was to achieve reepithelization in acute
and chronic wounds [11], repigmentation has also been
observed. Hence, the method has also been used to treat
hypopigmentation associated with vitiligo and burn scars
[12,13]. The Autologous Cell Harvesting Device is used to create
a spray suspension of viable autologous skin cells. These cells
are harvested intraoperatively and applied directly, in sus-
pension, to the prepared wound.
Wounds are prepared for application of NCASCS using
dermabrasion or laser, which are both ablative methods. By
nature, ablative treatments remove skin structures and cells,
including the basement membrane, which are then replaced
by a thinner epidermis with flatter rete ridges [14]. The
associated inflammatory response stimulates fibroblasts to
produce parallel oriented scar collagen instead of physiologi-
cal lattice pattern collagen [15]. Additionally, the risk of
dyspigmentation increases after ablative treatments due to
associated damage to the melanocytes [16].
Medical needling as non-ablative treatment overcomes the
shortcoming of ablative treatments by not destroying struc-
tures of the epidermis, but rather promoting the formation of
physiological collagen instead of scar collagen and initiating
the expression of growth factors. In recent years, it has been
shown that it is possible to achieve these ideal treatment goals
with percutaneous collagen induction or ‘‘medical needling’’
[17,18]. It has been shown that medical needling does not have
the risks of hyper- or hypopigmentation. However, repigmen-
tation of large hypopigmented scars is not achieved after
medical needling [19].
Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate if it is possible
to achieve repigmentation of large (>10 cm2) hypopigmented
burn scars by combining non-ablative medical needling and
NCASCS. The hypothesis is that the melanocytes of the cell
suspension link through the parenchymal canals onto the
basal membrane. They may be successfully transplanted after
24 h, when all needling channels are closed [18].
2. 
Methods
2.1. 
Study design
This study is a prospective randomized controlled within-
subject comparison. Subject’s hypopigmented scar areas were
divided into 3 subareas for which treatment was randomly
allocated as (1) the combination of medical needling and
NCASCS, (2) medical needling alone (positive control) and (3)
no treatment (negative control). The subjects were assessed at
baseline (pre-treatment) and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
pigmentation was objectively measured for each of the
subareas at each study visit. Scar outcomes for the area
treated with the combination of medical needling and
NCASCS were assessed by both the patient and an observer
using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale
(POSAS). POSAS outcomes of scars treated with Medical
Needling only are already published [17,20]. Hence, we focused
on the scars treated by medical needling and NCASCS to clarify
the difference regarding repigmentation.
2.2. 
Subject selection
In order to be included, patients were required to have
hypopigmented burn scars that had healed by secondary
intent, and were at least both 10 cm2 in size and 1 year in age.
Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and severe underlying
diseases or skin lesions like cancer or infections.
2.3. 
Procedure
We received approval from the local ethical committee for this
study. All subjects signed an informed consent. Informed consent
was obtained from parents of subjects younger than 18 years of
age. The treatment, including general anesthesia, medical
needling, skin sample harvesting and preparation and application
of the cell suspension was performed in a surgical suite.
2.4. 
Medical Needling and NCASCS
Medical needling is repetitive puncturing of the scar with a
roller equipped with 3 mm long needles (Figs. 1 and 2).
The needling device is repeatedly rolled over the scar in
three directions, longitudinally, diagonally and horizontally.
According to the extent of the scar, this procedure can last
30 min or longer. It is important to use the device with
constant pressure and in a straight way to prevent shear
forces. The needles disrupt the old collagen structures that
connect the scar with the upper dermis. The needles do not
have a lumen. Hence, they temporarily displace the skin cells
rather 
than 
destroy 
them. 
They 
penetrate 
the 
dermis
2.5–3.0 mm and lead to thousands of microwounds and
intradermal bleedings. A scar is sufficiently prepared for
NCASCS when multiple and confluent hematoma develop; the
skin is swollen and has a livid appearance.

 To produce NCASCS a 2 cm by 2 cm donor skin sample with
a thickness of 0.2 mm is required, and is harvested using a
dermatome. The skin sample is processed within the device
which contains a processing unit composed of an incubator, a
well for buffer solution, a work surface and a collecting well for
the final suspension. The split-thickness skin sample is
digested with the enzyme trypsin for 20 min in order to
release the skin cells from the extracellular matrix. Next, the
digestion is stopped by rinsing the skin sample in buffer
solution. The cells are removed mechanically by scraping
them from the skin sample with a scalpel. NCASCS is collected
with a syringe which is then covered with a spray nozzle.
After cleaning the prepared wound with wet compresses,
NCASCS is applied (Fig. 3). The area is immediately covered
with TelfaTM Clear wound dressing and sterile poultices. We
did not apply the cell solution prior to the needling because the
bleeding caused by medical needling would have rinsed the
cell suspension out of the treated area.
The superficial donor site wound is covered with wet
compresses. At the end of the procedure, a small amount of
remaining suspension is applied on the donor site to advance
the wound healing phase.
After surgery, patients are instructed to immobilize the
treated area for a minimum of 24 h, until the needling
channels are closed. All patients where exposed to direct
sun during the one year period.
2.5. 
Assessment
Outcomes were assessed subjectively using POSAS and
objectively using the Mexameter1 (Courage + Khazaka elec-
tronic GmbH) which quantify the presence of melanin.
The POSAS is a partially observer administered and
partially patient administered scale and covers a range of
scar characteristics. The patient score includes: pain, pruritus,
color, thickness, relief, pliability and overall opinion. Similarly,
the observer score includes: vascularization, pigmentation,
thickness, surface roughness, pliability, surface area and
overall opinion. Patients and observer each score these items
on a 10 point ordinal scale, 1 reflecting ‘‘normal skin’’
appearance and 10 reflecting the ‘‘worst imaginable scar’’.
The POSAS was used to make pre- to postoperative compar-
isons of the areas treated with NCASCS. With regard to this
study we concentrate on the ‘‘pigmentation’’ and ‘‘overall
opinion’’ ratings.

 Each scar was photographed before and after treatment
using a single lens reflex camera. Each picture was taken in the
same room in outpatient clinic in ambient light, without direct
flash. The subjects were positioned in front of a blue wall.
The melanin measurement is based on absorption of light.
The device’s probe (which is little bigger than a pencil) emits
light (Fig. 4) in defined wavelengths (for melanin 660 and
880 nm), detects the reflected amount of the emitted light
within 5 mm2 and computes the Melanin Index, which is
proportional to the melanin content of the skin. Measure-
ments of melanin were made three times in a row within 1 cm2
in each of the subjects’ 3 scar areas, along with a melanin
measurement in an area of healthy skin for comparison. At the
‘‘Baseline’’ time point the individual measuring points were
marked with a marking pencil and photographed afterwards.
Hence, it was possible to measure always at the same skin
location.
2.6. 
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using the software SAS
version 9.3. Due to the sample size only nonparametric tests
(Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables respectively
Wilcoxon signed rank tests) were used. Significance was
accepted at a level of p < 0.05.

Results
3.1. 
Subjects
The demographic data of 20 subjects are listed in Table 1.
Fifteen subjects were women and five were men. The average
age was 33 years, with a range from 6 to 60 years.
The majority of injuries were due to scalding hot fluids
(n = 10). Others suffered from fire accidents (n = 7). One
subject was the victim of an acid attack. Noteworthy is that
2 of the subjects had hypopigmented scars resulting from
cosmetic interventions, namely chemical peeling and laser
treatment.
3.2. 
Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale
The data of 19 subjects are considered. One subject was lost to
follow-up after moving to another country. The values from
each subject’s last visit (6–15 months) were used. There were
no infections detected at any subject and all scars were 100%
epithelialized.

MexameterW
Hereafter, the results of the Mexameter1 measurements are
depicted. Regarding melanin measurement, we chose 1 year as
the primary endpoint because of the potentially confounding
effect of season and the associated exposure to sunlight. Four
subjects were unable to follow up for the 1 year mexameter
measurement.
Regarding ‘‘Scar Needling + NCASCS’’ the median for pre-
operative melanin index was 125.3 � 31.9 SD points. Postoper-
atively it increased to 162.0 � 48.2 points, an improvement of
29.3% (Fig. 14). This is statistically significant with p < 0.05.
The ‘‘needling only’’ scar was preoperatively measured
with a median of melanin index of 149.5 � 100.7 SD points and
postoperatively with 137.0 � 77.0 points (Fig. 15). Hence, the
amount of melanin decreased about 8.4% which is not
statistically significant ( p > 0.05).

 The ‘‘Untreated scar’’ was measured and the median for
the 
melanin 
index 
was 
accounted 
preoperatively 
for
186.0 � 59.6 SD points. Postoperatively the index was mea-
sured for 169.5 � 90.9 points (Fig. 15). The amount of melanin
decreased about 8.9% which is not statistically significant
( p > 0.05).
The median for the amount of melanin was measured in
‘‘Healthy skin’’ for 158.0 � 46.7 SD points preoperatively. One
year later the amount was accounted for 153.0 � 46.9 points
(Fig. 15). Hence, the melanin index was nearly consistent.

Discussion
There are various methods to treat burn hypopigmen-
tation.
It has been shown that split-skin grafts produce a good
pigmentation outcome [21]. A limiting factor of this procedure
is that the skin of the donor site can only be expanded by a
factor of 1.5 [12]. Consequently, the larger the hypopigmented
area is to be treated, the larger the donor site must be,

 increasing associated risks of infection, pain and wound
healing problems with new scarring [22].
Cultured skin cell transplantation has been shown to
achieve good but also frustrating results regarding repigmen-
tation [23,24]. It is a two-stage procedure, where the harvested
cells are cultured over a few weeks in special laboratories. In a
second surgery the cells are applied to the prepared wound
bed [25]. The necessities of two operations and highly qualified
laboratories make this procedure expensive.
NCASCS can be considered as a modification of the cultured
cell technique, involving the disaggregation step but not the
expansion or amplification step. The advantages are that it is
cheaper, faster and a single-stage procedure. An advantage
over split-skin grafts is that it is possible to expand the donor
site by the factor 1:80 [25]. Minimizing the donor site thus
minimizes the risk of new scarring, infection or dyspigmenta-
tion. Additionally, it is possible to treat an area of 320 cm2 with
a 4 cm2 skin sample. The average treated area in our study was
94.1 � 67.6 cm2.
NCASCS is usually combined with ablative treatments like
lasers or dermabrasion as wound bed preparation.
Ablative and fractional laser treatments are not only used
for skin resurfacing and tightening [26,27]. It has been shown
that it is possible to achieve good results regarding repigmen-
tation in vitiligo [9,28]. Since burn scars have a lack of skin
appendages with stem cell reservoirs, they have reduced

 potential for repigmentation compared to vitiligo lesions [29].
Furthermore, despite risk minimization with fractional lasers,
the risk of dyspigmentation is increased [30,31]. Complication
rates for hypopigmentation are reported ranging from 12 to
14% [32]. The most common complication after dermabrasion
is pigment alteration after treatment [16,33]. Additionally,
darker skin types are more likely to suffer undesirable pigment
changes [33].
Medical needling as wound preparation for NCASCS is very
promising. It is a non ablative procedure which has been shown
to result in high patient satisfaction [17]. It has been shown that
after medical needling the level of transforming growth factor
(TGF) – b3 remains high even beyond the initial wound healing
phase [34]. TGF-b3 supports the formation of physiological
lattice pattern collagen as it is found in healthy skin [35].
Furthermore, medical needling results in a thickening of
the epidermis, a growth of the extracellular matrix with
increased collagen and elastin and a decreased transepider-
mal waterloss [19,20,34].
Medical needling does not change the amount of melano-
cytes but the expression levels of melanocyte-stimulating
hormone (MSH) and Interleukin-10 (Il-10) are modified. MSH
which influences the proliferation and activity of melanocytes
is significantly down regulated two weeks after treatment.
Il-10 as an anti inflammatory cytokine is upregulated post
operative [19]. These findings indicate that medical needling
minimizes the risk of postinflammatory dyspigmentation.
The POSAS is currently considered the most suitable scar
assessment scale [36]. It is reliable, complete, can be used
within minutes on males or females and was made for
detecting scar parameter changes over time [37]. Patients and

 observers both rated scar pigmentation and overall opinion
significantly better postoperatively as compared to before the
treatment. The photos support these findings.
However, the POSAS is based on subjective impressions
either of the patient or the observer. Therefore, it was important
to reinforce these positive results with objective data.
The Mexameter1 melanin index showed a significant
pigmentation improvement only in the scar treated with
medical needling and NCASCS. The control areas remained
nearly unchanged or even showed a slight decrease in the
amount of melanin.
Based on the fact that Medical Needling has no influence on
the pigmentation of the treated area [19], these results suggest
that it is possible to transplant melanocytes of the cell
suspension through the needling channels. In future, it is
important and necessary to support these results with
histological samples.
Three patients showed no increase of the melanin index
postoperatively. They can be classed as non-responders (see
Fig. 14). The reasons might be ascribed to the following
circumstances: invalid or incorrect needling technique or
invalid wound cleaning and washing before the application of
the suspension made with NCASCS, whereby the puncture
channels can be agglutinated with serous fluid. Furthermore, a
lack of immobilization of the treated scar or early removal of
the wound dressing can lead to shear force and thus provoke
death of the transplanted cells.
5. 
Conclusion
Our results show a subjective and objective improvement in
pigmentation and overall opinion. Both medical needling and
NCASCS preserve the epidermis which results in a reduced
risk of new scarring or dyspigmentation.
Considering all factors, we come to the conclusion that the
combination of medical needling and NCASCS is a very promising
approach to repigment large hypopigmented burn scars.
