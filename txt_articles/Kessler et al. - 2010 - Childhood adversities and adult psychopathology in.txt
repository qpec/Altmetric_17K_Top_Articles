 Significant
associations
between
retrospectively
reported
childhood adversities and adult mental disorders have been
documented in numerous epidemiological studies.1–6 Most of
these studies, however, either considered only a single childhood
adversity7,8 or a composite measure that did not allow differential
effects of multiple childhood adversities to be examined.9 Only a
few studies compared associations of childhood adversities with
different types of mental disorders or examined changes in
childhood adversities’ effects over the life course.10,11 Few studies
examined cross-national variation in exposure12,13 or effects14,15
of childhood adversities. Furthermore, lack of comparability of
measures across countries raises questions about accuracy of the
few existing cross-national comparisons.12 The present study
addresses these problems by examining the prevalence and
associations of retrospectively reported childhood adversities with
first onset of a wide variety of mental disorders across the life
course in epidemiological surveys in 21 countries in the World
Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH)
Survey Initiative.16
Method
Sample
The WMH surveys were administered in nine countries classified
by the World Bank as high income (Belgium, France, Germany,
Israel, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Spain, USA), six high-middle
income (Brazil, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Mexico, Romania, South
Africa), and six low/lower-middle income (Colombia, India, Iraq,
Nigeria, People’s Republic of China, Ukraine)17 (online Table
DS1). A total of 51 945 adults (age 18 and older) participated in
these surveys. Most featured nationally representative household
samples. Two (Colombia and Mexico) were representative of
urban areas, one of selected states (Nigeria) and the remaining
four of selected metropolitan areas (Brazil, India, Japan, People’s
Republic of China). Informed consent was obtained before
administering interviews. The samples that are not nationally
representative all focus on urban areas. The institutional review
board of the organisations that coordinated the surveys approved
and monitored compliance with procedures for informed consent
and protecting participants. Weights were used to adjust samples
for differential probabilities of selection and to match the sample
with population sociodemographic distributions. The weighted
(by sample size) average response rate was 73.1% (range 45.9–
98.8). Further details about WMH survey methodology are
available elsewhere.18
Measures
Mental disorders
Mental disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version 3.0,19 a fully-
structured lay-administered interview that generated diagnoses
for 20 commonly occurring mood disorders (major depressive
disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar I disorder, bipolar II

Background
Although significant associations of childhood adversities with
adult mental disorders are widely documented, most studies
focus on single childhood adversities predicting single
disorders.
Aims
To examine joint associations of 12 childhood adversities
with first onset of 20 DSM–IV disorders in World Mental
Health (WMH) Surveys in 21 countries.
Method
Nationally or regionally representative surveys of 51 945
adults assessed childhood adversities and lifetime DSM–IV
disorders with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI).
Results
Childhood adversities were highly prevalent and interrelated.
Childhood adversities associated with maladaptive family
functioning (e.g. parental mental illness, child abuse, neglect)
were the strongest predictors of disorders. Co-occurring
childhood adversities associated with maladaptive family
functioning had significant subadditive predictive associations
and little specificity across disorders. Childhood adversities
account for 29.8% of all disorders across countries.
Conclusions
Childhood adversities have strong associations with all
classes of disorders at all life-course stages in all groups of
WMH countries. Long-term associations imply the existence
of as-yet undetermined mediators.

(attention-deficit

substance disorders (alcohol and drug misuse, alcohol and drug
dependence with misuse). DSM–IV20 criteria were used with

rules
(other

and substance misuse, which was defined with or without

and

rules.
Masked
clinical
reappraisal interviews with the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM–IV (SCID)21 in four WMH countries found generally good
concordance between diagnoses based on the CIDI and SCID.22
Age at onset of lifetime disorders was assessed retrospectively using
a special question sequence shown experimentally to yield more
plausible distributions than standard age at onset questions.23
Childhood adversities
Twelve dichotomously scored childhood adversities occurring
before age 18 were assessed, including three types of interpersonal
loss (parental death, parental divorce, other separation from
parents), four types of parental maladjustment (mental illness,
substance
misuse,
criminality,
violence),
three
types
of
maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect) and two
other childhood adversities (life-threatening respondent physical
illness, family economic adversity). The measures of parental
death, divorce and other loss (e.g. respondent foster care
placement) include biological and non-biological parents. Parental
criminality, family economic adversity and sexual abuse were
assessed
with
questions
used
in
previous
epidemiological
surveys.11 Parental criminality was assessed with questions about
property crime and imprisonment, and economic adversity with
questions about whether the family often lacked enough money
to pay for basic necessities of living.10 Sexual abuse was assessed
with questions about repeated fondling, attempted rape or rape.24
Parental mental illness (major depression, generalised anxiety
disorder, panic disorder, antisocial personality disorder) and
substance misuse were assessed with the Family History Research
Diagnostic Criteria Interview.25,26 Family violence and physical
abuse were assessed with a modified version of the Conflict Tactics
Scale.27 Neglect was assessed with questions used in child welfare
research about frequency of not having adequate food, clothing or
medical care, having inadequate supervision, and having to do
age-inappropriate chores.28 Finally, life-threatening childhood
physical illness was assessed with a standard chronic conditions
checklist.29
Several
WMH
countries
omitted
selected
childhood
adversities (sexual abuse in Iraq and Shenzhen; neglect in South
Africa; parental divorce and neglect in the six Western European
countries; neglect and parent psychopathology in Israel) based
on concerns about respondent embarrassment. Rather than
exclude this large subset of countries from analysis or exclude
the missing childhood adversities from the countries where they
were assessed, we included a separate dummy predictor variable
to indicate whether each childhood adversity was assessed and
multiple imputation30 to impute individual-level missing values.
Multiple imputation implicitly assumes that the correlates of the
missing childhood adversities are the same as in the countries
where the childhood adversities were and were not assessed.
Although this assumption is unlikely to be completely accurate,
it allows us to maximise the use of available childhood adversities
data. Imprecision in imputations is likely to lead to underestimation
of overall childhood adversities effects.
Analysis methods
Tetrachoric factor analysis was used to examine associations
among the childhood adversities. Multivariate associations of
childhood adversities with first onset of DSM–IV/CIDI disorders
(based on retrospective age at onset reports) were estimated using
discrete-time survival analysis with person-year as the unit of
analysis31 and a consolidated data file that stacked the 20
disorder-specific person-year files across the 21 countries and
included dummy predictor variables that distinguished among
these 420 data files. Each model controlled for respondent age
at interview, gender and other prior DSM–IV/CIDI disorders. A
number of different model specifications were examined. The
Akaike information criterion (AIC)32 was used to select the best
model, which was then estimated in subsamples defined by life-
course stage and class of disorders (mood, anxiety, behaviour
and substance disorders). Survival coefficients and standard errors
were exponentiated to create odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals.
The population-attributable risk proportion (PARP) was
calculated using simulation methods for each class of disorders,
life-course stage and group of countries. The PARP is the
proportion of the cumulative predicted value of an outcome
disorder explained statistically by specific predictors. If the odds
ratios in the model are as a result of causal effects of the childhood
adversities, PARP can be interpreted as the expected proportional
reduction in outcome prevalence if childhood adversities were
eradicated.33 All significance tests were evaluated using 0.05-level
two-sided tests. As the WMH data are both clustered and
weighted, the design-based Taylor series method34 implemented
in the SUDAAN (version 8.0.1) software system on UNIX was
used to estimate standard errors and to evaluate statistical
significance.
Results
Prevalence and structure of childhood adversities
Similar proportions of respondents reported any childhood
adversities in high- (38.4%), high-middle- (38.9%), and low-/
lower-middle- (39.1%) income countries (Table 1). Parental death
was the most common childhood adversity (11.0–14.8%). Other
common childhood adversities included physical abuse (5.3–
10.8%), family violence (4.2–7.8%) and parental mental illness
(5.3–6.7%). Multiple childhood adversities were common among
respondents with any childhood adversities (59.3–66.2%), with
mean childhood adversities among respondents with two or more
of 2.5–2.9.
A total of 62 of the 66 tetrachoric correlations between pairs of
childhood adversities (94%) were positive in high and low/lower-
middle and 58 (88%) in high-middle-income countries. Medians
and interquartile ranges (twenty-fifth to seventy-fifth percentiles) of
correlations were 0.27 (0.14–0.35) in high, 0.20 (0.12–0.42) in high-
middle and 0.17 (0.10–0.31) in low/lower-middle-income countries.
Factor analysis found one consistently strong factor representing
maladaptive family functioning (parental mental illness, substance
misuse, criminal behaviour, domestic violence, physical and sexual
abuse, neglect), with factor loadings of 0.44–1.0. The remaining
childhood adversities were less highly intercorrelated.
Associations of childhood adversities
with DSM–IV/CIDI disorders
All 12 childhood adversities were significantly associated with
elevated risk of DSM–IV disorders in bivariate models pooled
across all outcomes and countries, with odds ratios of 1.6–2.0
379
Childhood adversities and adult psychopathology
 Kessler et al
for childhood adversities associated with maladaptive family
functioning and 1.1–1.5 for other childhood adversities. (Detailed
results of this and other models described below are available from
the authors on request.) Odds ratios were smaller in multivariate
models that included all childhood adversities as predictors (1.1–
1.6 childhood adversities associated with maladaptive family func-
tioning; 1.1–1.3 for other childhood adversities). The 12 degree of
freedom w2-test for the joint effects of all childhood adversities
was significant (w2
12 = 1536.6, P50.001). A multivariate model
that considered only number rather than type of childhood
adversities showed generally increasing odds ratios from 1.5 for
exactly one to 3.5–3.2 for six and for seven or more childhood
adversities (compared with no childhood adversities). The w2-test
for the joint effects of number-of-childhood adversities was
statistically significant (w2
7 = 1345.8, P50.001). A model that
considered both types and numbers of childhood adversities had
a better AIC, with both types (w2
12= 695.7, P50.001) and number
(w2
6 = 200.4, P50.001) significant. More complex inherently non-
linear models did not improve AIC further. However, fit was
improved by distinguishing between number of childhood
adversities associated with maladaptive family functioning and
number of other childhood adversities.
Results of this final model are strikingly consistent across
country groups (Table 2). Odds ratios of childhood adversities
associated with maladaptive family functioning are consistently
positive and significant (1.3–2.4). Odds ratios of other childhood
adversities are generally smaller (0.9–1.5) and less consistently
significant. Odds ratios of number of childhood adversities
associated with maladaptive family functioning are consistently
negative, mostly significant, and inversely related to number of
such adversities (0.4–0.9 for two to three, 0.2–0.5 for four to five
and 0.0–0.3 for six to seven adversities). This negative pattern
means that the increasing odds of disorder onset with increasing
number of childhood adversities associated with maladaptive
family functioning occurs at a significantly decreasing rate as the
number of these adversities increases. The odds ratio associated
with number of other childhood adversities is less consistent in
sign and significance.
Differential associations of childhood adversities
with class of disorder and life-course stage
Disaggregation showed that childhood adversities significantly
predict first onset of all classes of disorder in all groups of
countries. Childhood adversities associated with maladaptive
family functioning had consistently higher odds ratios (inter-
quartile range, IQR = 1.4–2.0) than other childhood adversities
(IQR = 1.1–1.3) across classes and groups. Odds ratios associated
with the number of maladaptive family functioning childhood
adversities were consistently and significantly negative across
classes and groups (0.3–1.0 for two to three, 0.1–0.6 for four to
five, 0.0–0.4 for six to seven adversities). Odds ratios associated
with number of other childhood adversities were less consistent
in sign and significance.
Similar results were found for models estimated by life-course
stage. As coefficients were quite comparable across the different
groups of countries (detailed results are available from the authors
on request), we focus on results pooled across all countries (Table
3). Type of childhood adversity had significant and almost entirely
positive odds ratios at each life-course stage, including childhood
(ages 4–12), adolescence (ages 13–19), young adulthood (ages
20–29) and later adulthood (ages 30+) (w2
12 = 197.8–407.5,
P50.001). Odds ratios associated with childhood adversities
associated with maladaptive family functioning were generally
higher than those associated with other childhood adversities
(IQRs of 1.5–1.9 and 1.1–1.3 respectively) and relatively consistent
across life-course stage. Odds ratios associated with number of

a. Prevalence estimates in the last five rows represent the proportions of all respondents with any childhood adversity who have exactly one, two, three, four, five or more.
These five proportions sum to 100% in each column.
 Childhood adversities and adult psychopathology
maladaptive family functioning childhood adversities were consis-
tently negative, significant (w2
6 = 35.3–119.8, P50.001), inversely
related to number of such adversities (0.4–0.8 for two to three,
0.2–0.4 for four to five and 0.0–0.2 for six to seven adversities)
and relatively consistent across life-course stage.
Population-attributable risk proportions
Population-attributable risk proportions suggest that eradication
of childhood adversities would lead to a 22.9% reduction in mood
disorders, 31.0% in anxiety disorders, 41.6% in behaviour dis-
orders, 27.5% in substance disorders and 29.8% of all disorders
(Table 4). The higher PARP for behaviour disorders than other
disorders exists in all three groups of countries, as is the generally
lowest PARP for mood disorders. These differences are partly as a
result of PARPs for most disorders being highest in childhood and
to a much higher proportion of behaviour disorders than other
disorders beginning in childhood.35,36 When we focus exclusively
on
childhood-onset
cases,
PARPs
for
behaviour
disorders
(50.3–59.0%) are comparable with those for mood (53.8–64.9%)
and substance (51.2–65.0%) disorders. Population-attributable
risk proportions for mood and behaviour disorders decrease with
age in all groups of countries, whereas PARPS remain rather stable
after childhood for substance disorders and show less evidence of
variation across the age range for anxiety disorders.
Discussion
Limitations
The results are limited by variation across surveys in language of

a. The model is a discrete-time survival model in a logistic regression framework with person-year as the unit of analysis to predict first onset of each of the 20 DSM–IV/CIDI
disorders included in the analysis separately in each of three groups of countries. Age at onset was assessed using retrospective reports. Controls were included in the model for
respondent age at interview, person-year, country, and type of disorder. The 19 type-of-disorder controls were included because the separate person-year data files for each of the
20 disorders were pooled, thereby forcing the slopes to be constant across disorders within each group of countries. As noted in the text, this assumption was subsequently relaxed
and the model was estimated separately for each of four classes of disorders (mood, anxiety, behaviour and substance disorders) and then for each of the 20 separate disorders.
Broad consistency of coefficients across these disaggregated models supports the validity of interpreting results pooled across all 20 disorders. The model is significant overall in

21 = 534.4–1853.7, P50.001). The sample sizes reported are the numbers of respondents who contributed at least one person-
year to the data file in each group of countries. The numbers of person-years in the analysis were 18 800 397 for high-income countries, 12 608 715 for high-middle-income
countries, 12 193 251 for low/lower-middle-income countries and 43 602 363 for all countries combined. These person-years represent the combination of 20 separate person-year
data files, each with a sample size equal to the combined number of years of life of all respondents up to and including their age at onset of the focal disorder for respondents
who experienced the disorder and age at interview for respondents who never experienced the disorder. Because of the sample sizes being enormous, a random 5% of
observations with a negative score on the outcome were used in the analysis, each such case being assigned a weight of 20 (i.e. 1/.05) to represent the undersampling.

frames (most notably, underrepresentation of rural areas in low-
and middle-income countries) and omission of some childhood
adversities in some countries. These inconsistencies could increase
variation in estimates. However, we estimated models separately
by country using only the childhood adversities assessed in that
country and found good consistency of results. (Detailed results
are available from the authors on request.)
Another limitation is that the WMH surveys did not assess
psychosis, which has been found in other research to be
significantly
related
to
childhood
adversities.37–39
Disorder
assessment was also limited by focusing exclusively on DSM–IV
cases. The DSM categories might not capture the full relevant
range of psychopathology in the countries studied. An additional
limitation related to measurement is that childhood adversities
and disorders were assessed retrospectively. Retrospective recall
bias is likely to be conservative, leading to underreporting of both
childhood adversities40 and disorders.41 Long-term prospective
study is needed to resolve this problem using available prospective
data-sets.1,42–44 Some interesting preliminary work of this sort has
already begun.45
Analyses were limited by not examining patterns separately for
men and women or across other important subsamples and by not
controlling
all
unmeasured
common
causes
of
childhood
adversities and disorders that could induce the associations
observed here in the absence of causal effects of childhood
adversities. Special caution is needed in interpreting the PARPs
because of this limitation, as the actual effects of eradicating
childhood adversities could be much lower than those estimated
by the PARPs.
Within the context of these limitations, the WMH results are
consistent with previous studies in suggesting that substantial
proportions of children are exposed to childhood adversities.

a. The model is a discrete-time survival model in a logistic regression framework with person-year as the unit of analysis to predict first onset of each of the 20 DSM–IV/CIDI
disorders included in the analysis pooled across all countries in each of four sets of person-years that define life-course stages. Age at onset was assessed using retrospective
reports. Controls were included in the model for respondent age at interview, person-year, country, and type of disorder. The 19 type-of-disorder controls were included because
the separate person-year data files for each of the 20 disorders were pooled, thereby forcing the slopes to be constant across disorders within each age range. As noted in the text,
this assumption was subsequently relaxed and the model was estimated separately for each of four classes of disorders (mood, anxiety, behaviour and substance disorders) and
then for each of the 20 separate disorders. Broad consistency of coefficients across these disaggregated models supports the validity of interpreting results pooled across all 20
disorders. The model is significant in each life-course stage (w2
21 = 328.5–1162.6, P50.001). The sample sizes reported are the numbers of respondents who contributed at least one
person-year to the data file at each of the life-course stages. The numbers decrease with age as some respondents were younger than 20 and even more younger than 30 at the
time of interview. The numbers of person-years in the analysis were 9 817 605 for childhood, 7 617 351 for adolescence, 9 459 051 for young adulthood and 16 708 356 for later
adulthood. These person-years represent the combination of 20 separate person-year data files, each with a sample size equal to the combined number of years of life of all
respondents in the age ranges of the life-course stages described in the column headings, where the upper end of the records are the age at onset of the focal disorder for
respondents who experienced the disorder and age at interview for respondents who never experienced the disorder. Because of the sample sizes being enormous, a random
5% of observations with a negative score on the outcome were used in the analysis, each such case being assigned a weight of 20 (i.e. 1/0.05) to represent the undersampling.

 Childhood adversities and adult psychopathology
Consistency of WMH exposure rates with those reported in
previous studies is difficult to assess precisely, as measurement
approaches across studies differ and cannot be compared
directly.46 World Mental Health survey respondent reports of
parental divorce, the childhood adversity most often found in
government
statistics,
are generally
consistent
with
official
estimates.47 World Mental Health survey respondent reports of
other childhood adversities such as physical and sexual abuse48
and parental violence,49 however, are lower than in some other
surveys. This suggests that WMH estimates might be conservative.
Although early studies on associations between a single
childhood adversity and a single mental disorder implied the
existence of specificity of effects,50,51 little evidence of specificity
was found in the WMH data. The implication is that causal
pathways linking childhood adversities to disorders are quite
general. Although several recent comparative studies found more
evidence for specificity among children and adolescents,52–54 those
studies focused on prevalent cases, whereas the current analysis
focused on first lifetime onsets.
Implications and future research
We showed that childhood adversities often co-occur and that
clusters of childhood adversities associated with maladaptive
family functioning are linked with the highest risk of mental
disorders. We also found generally subadditive effects of multiple
childhood
adversities
associated
with
maladaptive
family
functioning. This has important implications for intervention
because it means prevention or amelioration of only a single
childhood adversity among individuals exposed to many is
unlikely to have important effects. Early intervention to reduce
exposure to all childhood adversities (e.g. multisystem family
therapy, foster care placement) and later intervention to address
long-term
adult
maladaptive psychological and
behavioural
consequences of having been exposed to childhood adversities
would seem to hold the most promise in light of these results.
Intervention, of course, requires detection. Screening of
youngsters in routine medical settings would seem the easiest
approach to detection of severe childhood adversities (e.g.
physical/sexual abuse and neglect). Although children are often re-
luctant
to
admit
these
childhood
adversities
and
health
professionals are often reluctant to ask, promising approaches
have been developed to increase the success of detection based
on health worker questioning.55 Although it is less clear whether
retrospective detection of childhood adversities in adulthood
would have value, the WMH data show that history of childhood
adversities predicts disorder onset in adulthood. This is much
more striking than showing that childhood adversities continue
to be associated with adult prevalence,56,57 and suggests that
retrospective detection might help find adults in need of inter-
ventions to address the long-term emotional and behavioural
consequences of childhood adversities that contribute to their
ongoing elevated risk on new onsets.58
There is nothing in our retrospective WMH results that
addresses the number of hypotheses that could be advanced to
explain the patterns documented here.57,59,60 Our results are
nonetheless important, in providing empirical justification for
further analyses to explore such hypotheses to identify mediators,
modifiers and developmental sequences that might be fruitful
targets for preventive interventions.61 It would also be useful to
examine these associations in an epidemiological sample that
had a genetically informative design to investigate the extent to
which exposure and reactivity to childhood adversities are under
genetic control. Consistent with other recent research,38 it would

a. The PARPs were calculated using simulation methods to generate individual-level predicted probabilities of the outcome disorders twice from the coefficients in final model,
where these coefficients were estimated separately for each cell of the table. The first time the calculations were made using all the coefficients in the model and the second
time assuming that the coefficients associated with the childhood adversities were all zero. One minus the ratio of the predicted prevalence estimates in the two specifications was
then used to calculate PARP.
b. Too few onsets occurred at this life-course stage to estimate PARP.
