Abstract
Background: Rotavirus infection causes considerable disease burden of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalization
and death among children less than 5 years in China. Although two rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix and RotaTeq) have
been licensed in more than 100 countries in the world, the Lanzhou Lamb rotavirus vaccine (LLR) is the only
vaccine licensed in China. This study aims to forecast the potential impacts of the two international vaccines
compared to domestic LLR.
Methods: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model. We compared costs at the
societal aspect and health impacts with and without a vaccination program by LLR, Rotarix or RotaTeq. Parameters
including demographic, epidemiological data, costs and efficacy of vaccines were obtained from literature review.
The model incorporated the impact of vaccination on reduction of incidence of rotavirus infection and severity of
AGE indicated by hospitalization, inpatient visits and deaths. Outcomes are presented in terms of quality-adjusted
life years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to status quo.
Results: In a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 infants, the two international vaccines showed very good cost-
effectiveness, with ICER of Rotateq and Rotarix shifting from LLR of $1715.11/QALY and $2105.66/QALY, respectively.
Rotateq and Rotarix had significantly decreased incidence compared to LLR, particularly among infants aged
6 months to 2 years.
Conclusions: RotaTeq is expected to introduce in the national routine immunization program to reduce disease
burden of rotavirus infection with universal coverage.

Background
Diarrhea is the second leading cause of child mortality
only after pneumonia in the world. Rotavirus is the most
common cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among chil-
dren under 5 years of age and leads to substantial mortal-
ity and morbidities in both developing and developed
countries [1]. Rotavirus causes approximately 111 million
episodes of gastroenteritis requiring home care, leads to
25 million outpatients and 2 million hospitalizations [2].
Worldwide in 2008, diarrhea attributable to rotavirus in-
fection resulted in 453,000 under-five deaths, accounting
for 37 % of deaths attributable to diarrhea and 5 % of all
deaths in children younger than 5 years [3]. In China, ap-
proximately 47.8 % of AGE hospitalization among under-
five children attributed to rotavirus [4]. Although the
overall annual number of deaths from rotavirus diarrhea
decreased by 74 % during the past years, rural children
suffer from rotavirus-related deaths 11 times greater than
urban children (0.33 deaths vs. 0.03 deaths per live birth
in 2012) [5]. There are annually 134,000 deaths of children
under 5 years due to rotavirus infection and about 70 % of
them living in the rural area [6]. Rotavirus diarrhea is

 currently no specific treatment. The main measures of
oral rehydration salts (ORS) and intravenous fluids are to
maintain electrolyte balance and to reduce the number of
deaths caused by diarrheal dehydration. Therefore, vaccin-
ation against rotavirus serves as a principal strategy to re-
duce the disease burden.
There are two types in the world: Rotateq (a pentavalent
vaccine manufactured by Merck, US) and Rotarix (a mono-
valent vaccine manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium)
and both have been approved in more than 100 countries,
but not yet in China. Rather, a domestic Lanzhou Lamb
Rotavirus vaccine (LLR) developed by Rotorway Lanzhou
Institute of Biological Products has been licensed since
1998 and introduced into the second-category list of the
national immunization program, which is not compulsory
with free access and needs to charge a user-fee. The Rotarix
vaccine is derived from a single human rotavirus strain
(89–12; P[8] G1) that was attenuated by multiple passages
in cell culture, divided into 2 doses of oral, interval 1 to
2 months [7]. The RotaTeq vaccine based on a parent bo-
vine strain (WC3) is composed of 5 rotavirus strains that
contains the types of rotavirus (G1–G4 and P1A) [7]. It
need to take three doses of oral, each agent an interval of at
least 1 month. The LLR vaccine is derived from a lamb
rotavirus strain (P[12] G10),which induces generation the
antigenic types of rotavirus (G1–G4), recommended to take
one dose of oral annually [7]. The clinical research about
4000 infants and young children(aged 6 ~ 24 months),
shows that the effectiveness of RV diarrhea protection was
78 % [8].
The World Health Organization (WHO) recom-
mends introduction of the rotavirus vaccine into the
routine immunization program, which can potentially
bring health benefits including reduced hospitalization
and mortality [9, 10]. Globally, rotavirus vaccination
had been implemented in the national vaccination pro-
gram of 75 countries at the moment. In China, a national
routine immunization program is expected to reduce child
mortality in rural areas and hospitalization in urban areas
related
to
rotavirus.
Although
the
national
routine
immunization program by RotaTeq and Rotarix have
shown good cost-effectiveness in both developing and de-
veloped countries [11–13], there was seldom economic
evaluation to forecast the potential impacts of the two
international vaccines with comparison to the domestic
vaccine in China. Therefore, the aim of this study is to as-
sess cost-effectiveness of possible options of rotavirus vac-
cination in China, in order to inform the decision making.
Methods
Overview of the model
We constructed a Markov model in TreeAge Pro 2011
(TreeAge Software Inc.) in a hypothetical birth cohort of
100,000 in the rural and the urban area to compare two
international vaccines (Rotarix and Rotateq) with the
current LLR and all vaccination options with no vaccin-
ation (Fig. 1). The model simulated 6 months for a cycle,
following up until the age of 60 months, with the time
horizon of the life span. At the initial point of each cycle,
the birth cohort enters the model to either the vacci-
nated or the unvaccinated branch, and shift to different
health status including staying healthy, acquiring rota-
virus infection, or dying due to rotavirus-related diseases
or other reasons. Children infected by rotavirus were
considered to receive either inpatient or outpatient ser-
vices, or stay at home, depending on the severity and the
utilization of healthcare services. Infected individuals
who did not die returned to a healthy status at the end
of each cycle. The transition probabilities are specified
by cycles, including immunization coverage, vaccine effi-
cacy, and incidence, hospitalization and mortality of
rotavirus-related diseases. The expected outcomes in-
clude reduction of the incidence and the severity of rota-
virus infection and utilization of healthcare services.
Cost estimates
Costs were given in 2015 prices in US dollars and dis-
counted to the net present values using an annual rate
of 3 %. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) conversion rates
and the domestic consumer price index (CPI) of health
care were used to adjust costs data [14, 15] into US dollars.
Cost estimates are based on societal perspective, including
vaccination costs and medical costs to treat rotavirus-
related diseases. We considered costs as the overall health
resources consumed for vaccination or medical care, rather
than payment by patients. Regarding vaccination costs, be-
cause the two international vaccines have not been ap-
proved in China yet, we referred the basic data across
different countries worldwide and set a wide range of the
price in sensitivity analysis [16, 17]. The total cost of a sin-
gle dose of LLR was $24 based on the national tariff, as
currently it is listed in the second-category vaccines and
fully charged to users. Regarding the costs of rotavirus-
associated inpatient and outpatient services, data were de-
rived from a facility-based study of the economic burden
associated with rotavirus diarrhea in five provinces of
China [18] and a population-based surveillance for measur-
ing the economic burden of the disease in a rural area of
China [19]. We referred similar measurement of one of the
previous economic evaluation by Liu et al to consider the
different levels of healthcare in the country [20].
Epidemiological data on the disease burden
In China, population-based estimated rates of rotavirus-
related inpatient and outpatient was 14.4 and 149 per
100,000 under-five children, respectively [21]. The real in-
cidence of the disease is likely to be underestimated be-
cause rotavirus was less commonly detected in children

 with mild cases in primary clinics and in the community
[22]. By age five, it is assumed that almost every child will
have an episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis, approximately
20 % will be outpatient, 1.67 % will be inpatient and
0.34 % will die [2]. We considered differences on the inci-
dence and disease burden due to rotavirus infection in
rural and the urban area of China.
First rotavirus infections are most likely to result in
moderate-severe cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis but subse-
quent infections are progressively milder. The adjusted effi-
cacy of a child’s first natural rotavirus infection in protecting
against subsequent natural rotavirus-associated diarrhea was
77 %. This protection increased to 83 % after two natural in-
fections and to 92 % after three natural infections [23].
The annual background mortality was based on data
from the Hospital Statistics. Since there were very few
RV-infections leading to death in China, the background
mortality was not adjusted for RV-associated deaths. This
data was adjusted to the aver-age population <5 years of
age. Accordingly, the calculated the probability of each
phase to die due to RV-infection was 0.0058 % [24].
Vaccine effectiveness
The protection effectiveness of Rotarix and Rotateq were
derived from randomized controlled trials in other Asian
regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, con-
sidering the ethinic homogeneity [25], because there was
no eligible data specifically for the Chinese population.
Both were highly effective in protecting against rotavirus
gastroenteritis (RVGE) [25, 26]. Because there was no ran-
domized control trial assessing LLR, we used data from a
domestic meta-analysis to explore the protective effect

 [27] and two case-control studies to evaluate the vaccine
effectiveness [28, 29].
Outcome measures and cost effectiveness analysis
The health benefits of the vaccination include reduced
rotavirus-related deaths, hospitalizations and outpatient
visits and saved medical costs. The incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio was calculated as incremental costs di-
vided by incremental quality-adjusted lift year (QALY)
gained, in order to determine the priority to purchasing the
interventions at different budget levels. The health utility of
different disease status were derived from previous litera-
ture [30]. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of three
times Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was ap-
plied to examine the cost-effectiveness of the vaccination
options, as WHO defined interventions with ICER less than
three times of GDP per capita as cost-effective and that less
than GDP per capita as very cost-effective [31].
Sensitivity analysis
To test the robustness of model results, we varied the
assumptions of parameters and a discount rate of 3 %
for estimates of costs and health impact over a plausible
range in sensitivity analysis (Table 1). Besides one-way
sensitivity analysis, probabilistic multivariate sensitivity
analysis with the Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000
randomly selected sets of net costs and health benefits
were performed. For each set, the frequency distribu-
tions for every assumption were randomly sampled to
assign assumption values.
Results
Health impacts and cost-effectiveness of vaccination
In a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 infants, projected
costs and health benefits for all vaccination options are
shown in Table 2. Rotateq and Rotarix both showed very
good cost-effectiveness, with ICER lower than GDP per
capita. Of the three options, LLR is the basic one with
average
cost-effectiveness ratio
(ACER) of $110.68/
QALY gained. The total cost is even less than non-
vaccination. Rotateq yielded the most health benefits,
with ACER of $228.13/QALY gained (Fig. 2). The incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ration (ICER) of Rotateq and
Rotarix shifting from LLR was $1715.11/QALY gained
and $2105.66/QALY gained, respectively, indicating that
the optimal pathway for children rotavirus vaccination
starts at LLR and then shift to Rotateq.
Figure 3 showed the simulated annual incidence of rota-
virus infection by different vaccination options. Rotateq
and Rotarix had significantly decreased incidence com-
pared to LLR, particularly at children’s age between 0.5 to
2 years and particularly in the rural area . Both of the de-
creasing rates of the incidence caused by Rotateq and
Rotarix in rural areas are 28.5 % higher than that in urban
area [32]. The cumulative infection rate up to 5 years of
Rotateq, Rotarix and LLR is 6.32, 12.05 and 64.26 %,
respectively.
Sensitivity analysis
A tornado diagram showed results of one-way sensitivity
analysis (Fig. 4). The ICER of Rotateq versus LLR was
most sensitive to the incidence of rotavirus infection and
secondly the vaccine efficacy. As a result of multivariate
sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness acceptability
curve indicated that the probability of Rotateq to be cost-
effective is nearly 100 % at WTP thresholds of $7594
(GDP per capita in 2015) (Fig. 5).
Discussion
To best of our knowledge, this is the first economic evalu-
ation to comprehensively compare all available options for
rotavirus vaccination in China. In the hypothetical cohort of
100,000 infants, a national routine rotavirus vaccination by
both Rotateq and Rotatrix showed high cost-effectiveness,
and Rotateq reduced rotavirus disease burden most signifi-
cantly, particularly among children aged between 6 months
to 2 years and those living in the rural area. Considering the
cost-effectiveness and the huge disease burden of rotavirus
infection among children under 5 years, it is necessary to
add vaccination against rotavirus into the current national
routine immunization program.
Although LLR is the only approved vaccine in China
and only Chinese-produced vaccines are regarded as a
reliable supply for the national immunization program,
the major problem of LLR is its complicated schedule,
making it difficult to follow: one oral dose is given to the
infant and children aged 2 to 35 months, followed by
recommended yearly strengthening doses. Moreover, our
study showed that compared to the two international
vaccines, the effort of LLR to prevent and reduce rota-
virus infection among children under 5-year is limited,
particularly at children’s age between 0.5 to 2 years, at
which 94 % of all episodes of rotavirus diarrhea occurred
[4]. On the other hand, with the increase of age, the
body's resistance gradually strengthens and the rate of
rotavirus infection decreases [33]. Our findings is con-
sistent with the report showing no significant protection
among children vaccinated at 12–23 months of age [34].
For LLR, although earlier immunization and the adminis-
tration of the full immunization regimen during infancy
was recommended based on findings of a case-control
study [28], the vague schedule makes confusion for par-
ents and lead to difficulties in evaluation of the efficacy.
Therefore, the current program is expected to scale up:
based on the ICER shifting from LLR and health impacts
on reduced disease burden of the two international vac-
cines, RotaTeq is dominating compared with Rotarix and
expected to replace LLR. Besides the established safety

 and efficacy of the vaccine, the globally common rotavirus
strains are the major cause of severe childhood diarrhea in
China, suggesting that introduction of Rotateq vaccine
would substantially reduce the disease burden [4]. In sen-
sitivity analysis, infection rate affects the cost-effectiveness
most significantly. After the introduction of rotavirus vac-
cines, rotavirus infection and hospitalizations among chil-
dren has been reduced and in addition to such the direct
effects, herd immunity also brings benefits to unvaccin-
ated children [35]. However in China, due to relevantly
low coverage, the impact of the vaccination on reduction
of infection rate may be definitely limited, demonstrating
that at the moment the national routine immunization
against rotavirus with universal coverage would achieve
good cost-effectiveness.
Without the national routine immunization program
and public investment to reduce out-of-pocket payment to
vaccination, it is extremely difficult to achieve universal
coverage. The coverage of rotavirus vaccination is rele-
vantly low, mainly attributable to the self-pay policy for
the second-category vaccines, lack of knowledge of vaccin-
ation and rotavirus diseases among parents, and compli-
cated and unclear schedule [36]. In China, vaccines are
listed into two categories: the first category, freely and
compulsorily provided, including bacillus Calmette-Guerin
(BCG), hepatitis B vaccine, oral polio vaccine, measles vac-
cine and Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus vaccine (DPT); and
the second-category, which are totally self-paid. Under the
current out-of-pocket payment policy for the second-
category vaccines, the price for LLR is $24 per dose, and

 that for imported Rotateq or Rotatrix is uncertain and
should be even higher, considering imported 7-valent
pneumococcal vaccine costs as high as $140 per dose. Un-
like most countries in the world, where financing for the
immunization derived from either public funds or inter-
national donors and the user-fee is charged only a little,
some vaccines addressing critical childhood diseases such
as rotavirus infection and pneumonia are still self-paid and
expensive, making profits for providers. As the results,
the coverage of those vaccines is extremely low [36–38],
not comparable to that of DPT as well as other first-
category vaccines, which is generally regarded as a principle
indicator for universal coverage of the vaccination, more
than 90 % of the target children in China [39].

 Our study has several limitations. First, regarding effi-
cacy, data were derived from other settings and not spe-
cific for Chinese population for the two international
vaccines, because both have not been approved in China
yet. As for LLR, a unique rotavirus vaccine only ap-
proved and applied in China so far, due to no ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT), data were derived
from meta-analysis of domestic observational studies.
Second, we did not include herd immunity effect in the
model due to low coverage of the vaccination, potentially
underestimated the effectiveness when adding the rota-
virus vaccine into the routine immunization program.
Third, as a model for decision making at the national
level, we did not specifically consider the epidemio-
logical characteristics at different geographical regions
within the country, as the incidence of rotavirus in-
fection in low-latitude provinces tended to be higher
and likely to be affected by living habits, living envi-
ronments, education level and vaccine coverage [40], rais-
ing as a further issue after scale-up of the current program.
Conclusion
In China, rotavirus vaccination is highly cost-effective.
To reduce disease burden of rotavirus infection, Rota-
teq is expected to replace LLR for the scale-up of the
national routine immunization program, by increasing
public investments and reducing costs of vaccines
afforded by parents.
