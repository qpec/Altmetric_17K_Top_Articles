BACKGROUND
The instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is an index used to assess the severity of coro-
nary-artery stenosis. The index has been tested against fractional flow reserve (FFR) in 
small trials, and the two measures have been found to have similar diagnostic accu-
racy. However, studies of clinical outcomes associated with the use of iFR are lacking. 
We aimed to evaluate whether iFR is noninferior to FFR with respect to the rate of 
subsequent major adverse cardiac events.
METHODS
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial using the 
Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry for enrollment. A total of 
2037 participants with stable angina or an acute coronary syndrome who had an indi-
cation for physiologically guided assessment of coronary-artery stenosis were random-
ly assigned to undergo revascularization guided by either iFR or FFR. The primary end 
point was the rate of a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, or unplanned revascularization within 12 months after the procedure.
RESULTS
A primary end-point event occurred in 68 of 1012 patients (6.7%) in the iFR group and 
in 61 of 1007 (6.1%) in the FFR group (difference in event rates, 0.7 percentage points; 
95% confidence interval [CI], −1.5 to 2.8; P 
= 
0.007 for noninferiority; hazard ratio, 1.12; 
95% CI, 0.79 to 1.58; P 
= 
0.53); the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 
difference in event rates fell within the prespecified noninferiority margin of 3.2 per-
centage points. The results were similar among major subgroups. The rates of myocar-
dial infarction, target-lesion revascularization, restenosis, and stent thrombosis did not 
differ significantly between the two groups. A significantly higher proportion of pa-
tients in the FFR group than in the iFR group reported chest discomfort during the 
procedure.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with stable angina or an acute coronary syndrome, an iFR-guided re-
vascularization strategy was noninferior to an FFR-guided revascularization strategy 
with respect to the rate of major adverse cardiac events at 12 months. (Funded by

C
oronary revascularization is war-
ranted only if a patient has one or more 
coronary-artery stenoses that are hemo-
dynamically important. Large randomized stud-
ies have shown that fractional flow reserve (FFR) 
is superior to angiographic assessment for the 
detection of hemodynamically important coronary-
artery stenoses and that use of FFR to guide 
coronary revascularization improves clinical out-
comes.1-3 FFR is measured by advancing a coro-
nary-pressure guidewire distal to a stenotic lesion 
and then administering adenosine to assess the 
pressure gradient across the lesion during hy-
peremia.
Studies have shown that resting indexes (de-
rived from the pressure measurement at rest, 
without the administration of adenosine) have 
diagnostic accuracy similar to that of FFR as 
independent measures of ischemia.4-7 The instan-
taneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is a recently devel-
oped physiological index used to assess the sever-
ity of stenosis.The iFR is calculated by measuring 
the resting pressure gradient across a coronary 
lesion during the portion of diastole when micro-
vascular resistance is low and stable.8 Benefits of 
iFR include the ability to obtain an instantaneous 
lesion assessment without the need to administer 
a hyperemic agent, such as adenosine. Although 
there are some differences between FFR and iFR 
in diagnostic results, a large outcome-based 
clinical trial has yet to establish whether such 
differences are of clinical relevance.8-10 The aim 
of this trial was to investigate whether iFR is 
noninferior to FFR with respect to subsequent 
clinical outcomes among patients who have an 
indication for physiologically guided assessment 
of coronary-artery stenosis.
Methods
Trial Design
The Instantaneous Wave-free Ratio versus Frac-
tional Flow Reserve in Patients with Stable 
Angina Pectoris or Acute Coronary Syndrome 
(iFR-SWEDEHEART) trial was a multicenter, ran-
domized, controlled, open-label clinical trial in 
which comprehensive national registries were 
used for patient data collection, randomization, 
and follow-up. The trial design has been reported 
previously.11 The trial was conducted in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by ethical review boards in Sweden, 
Denmark, and Iceland. The trial was funded by 
an unrestricted research grant from Philips Vol-
cano, which had no role in the design of the 
trial or the collection, analysis, or reporting of 
the data.
Trial administration, data collection and man-
agement, statistical analyses, and central adjudica-
tion were conducted by personnel at the Uppsala 
Clinical Research Center, Uppsala, Sweden. The 
trial was designed by the authors, who wrote all 
drafts of the manuscript and made the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication. The 
authors vouch for the integrity and completeness 
of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of 
the study to the trial protocol, which is available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Registry-Based Enrollment
All patients who were enrolled in the trial were 
included in the Swedish Coronary Angiography 
and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR; for details, 
see the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). The registry contains data on patients 
from all 30 coronary intervention centers in 
Sweden and 1 in Iceland; it is funded solely by 
national health authorities and provides imme-
diate and continuous feedback on processes and 
quality-of-care measures. A center in Denmark 
also participated in the trial and entered all rele-
vant data into the SCAAR. All baseline and pro-
cedural data were entered online directly into the 
registry, as described previously.12
Patient Population
Patients with stable angina pectoris, unstable an-
gina pectoris, or non–ST-segment elevation myo-
cardial infarction (NSTEMI) who had an indica-
tion for physiologically guided assessment of a 
coronary lesion (with 40 to 80% stenosis on vi-
sual examination) were eligible for inclusion. In 
patients with suspected stable angina, any lesion 
could be assessed; in patients with unstable an-
gina or NSTEMI, only nonculprit lesions were 
evaluated and culprit lesions were managed as 
clinically indicated. All participants provided 
written informed consent. (Further details about 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix.)

Instantaneous Wave-free Ratio vs. Fractional Flow Reserve
Randomization
Using a Web-based platform in the SCAAR, we 
randomly assigned patients to undergo revascu-
larization guided by either iFR or FFR. If inclu-
sion criteria were met after we had entered a 
patient’s baseline information into the registry, 
a pop-up window indicated that the patient was 
potentially eligible for the trial. The treating phy-
sician was then asked to respond to questions in 
a randomization module in the registry to con-
firm the absence of exclusion criteria and to veri-
fy that the patient had provided written informed 
consent. If the patient was eligible, a randomiza-
tion button appeared that allowed the patient to 
be assigned to either the iFR group or the FFR 
group.
Invasive Procedures
In both trial groups, intracoronary nitroglycerin 
was administered before the lesion was assessed. 
Lesions with at least 80% stenosis on angiogra-
phy were treated without the use of physiological 
indexes. For lesions with 40 to 80% stenosis on 
visual examination, physiologically guided assess-
ment was performed.
The iFR and FFR measurements were obtained 
with the use of a coronary-pressure guidewire 
(Philips Volcano) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). For FFR, hyperemia was induced with 
the administration of intracoronary or intrave-
nous adenosine, in accordance with the clinical 
practice at each participating center. Revascular-
ization of the investigated vessel was mandated 
if the iFR was 0.89 or lower or the FFR was 0.80 
or lower; these thresholds indicated the presence 
of hemodynamically important stenosis. When 
the iFR was higher than 0.89 or the FFR was 
higher than 0.80, revascularization of the vessel 
was deferred.
Revascularization was performed in accordance 
with standard clinical practice. Percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary-artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) were considered to be 
revascularization procedures for the purposes of 
this trial. At the conclusion of the procedure, the 
treating physician asked the patients to assess 
their level of chest discomfort during the proce-
dure on a four-point grading scale, ranging from 
none to severe. The type of P2Y12 inhibitor that 
was administered during and after PCI was left 
to the discretion of the physician; however, life-
long treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was recom-
mended.
Data Collection, End Points, and Follow-up
Baseline patient demographic data were obtained 
from the SCAAR. Specific trial-related data that 
were not included in the registry were collected 
in a separate module embedded in the SCAAR. 
The data were obtained through an online ques-
tionnaire, which was completed by the treating 
physician, and included the results of the angio-
graphic assessment of coronary-artery stenosis, 
an indication of whether the results of the 
physiologically guided assessment of coronary-
artery stenosis influenced the treatment strategy, 
the patient report of chest discomfort during as-
sessment, and any deviations from the protocol.
The primary end point was the rate of a com-
posite of death from any cause, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, or unplanned revasculariza-
tion within 12 months after the procedure. 
Unplanned revascularization was defined as re-
vascularization that was not the index procedure 
and was not identified at the time of the index 
procedure as a staged procedure to be performed 
within 60 days. Key secondary end points were 
the rate of each component of the primary end 
point within 12 months after the procedure, 
chest discomfort during the procedure, target-
lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis, and 
restenosis. (For further details on primary and 
secondary end points, see the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
Information on death from any cause was 
obtained from national population registries. In 
Sweden, data on myocardial infarction and un-
planned revascularization were obtained from the 
Swedish Web-Based System for Enhancement and 
Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart 
Disease Evaluated According to Recommended 
Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry (for details, 
see the Supplementary Appendix). In Denmark, 
data on myocardial infarction and revasculariza-
tion were obtained from the Danish National 
Patient Registry and the Western Denmark Heart 
Registry, in accordance with previous studies.13,14 
In Iceland, a research nurse conducted clinical 
follow-up.

current health care records and angiographic 
results were obtained. Death and myocardial in-
farction events were adjudicated by an indepen-
dent clinical event adjudication committee whose 
members were unaware of the group assign-
ments. Unplanned revascularization events and 
secondary angiographic outcomes were assessed 
by an independent experienced observer who was 
unaware of the group assignments.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that a sample size of 2000 pa-
tients would provide the trial with 85% power to 
test the hypothesis that iFR would be noninferior 
to FFR with respect to the primary end point. 
We anticipated a primary end-point event rate in 
the FFR group of 8%, which was based on his-
torical data from the SWEDEHEART registry in 
a population that includes a mix of patients with 
either stable angina or acute coronary syn-
dromes. The selected noninferiority margin for 
the difference in event rates was 3.2 percentage 
points, which corresponded to a noninferiority 
margin for the hazard ratio of 1.40 that was 
based on the anticipated event rate in the FFR 
group.
All end-point analyses were performed on a 
per-protocol basis. Differences between groups in 
time-to-event end points were assessed with the 
use of a log-rank test. Kaplan–Meier estimates of 
the rate of primary end-point events were com-
pared between the two groups with the use of the 
approach suggested by Machin and Gardner.15 If 
the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in event rates was less 
than the prespecified delta value (3.2 percentage 
points), iFR would be considered to be noninfe-
rior to FFR. Hazard ratios were calculated with 
the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. 
Differences between group means were assessed 
with the use of a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Chi-
square tests or Fisher’s exact tests were used to 
test differences between proportions. A two-tailed 
P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indi-
cate statistical significance. Subgroup analyses 
were carried out for the primary end point and 
its components with the use of a proportional-
hazards model that included the trial group, sub-
group, and interaction between trial group and 
subgroup as variables; analyses within groups are 
presented as hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals, and analyses of interactions as P values.
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Angiographic 
Data
The trial was conducted at 13 hospitals in Swe-
den, 1 hospital in Denmark, and 1 hospital in 
Iceland. During the trial period (May 2014 to 
October 2015), 20.3% of patients who presented 
to the trial hospitals with stable angina, unstable 
angina, or NSTEMI were included in the trial. 
A total of 2037 participants were enrolled in the 
trial; 1019 were assigned to the iFR group, and 
1018 to the FFR group. Data for 18 patients were 
excluded from the analyses because these pa-
tients received an incorrect group assignment 
or had unacceptable side effects associated with 
adenosine or because of technical issues or other 
reasons; data for the remaining 2019 patients 
were included in the analyses (Fig. 1). The two 
groups were similar in terms of risk factors, indi-
cation for angiography, extent of coronary artery 
disease, and clinical and demographic charac-
teristics (Table 1). The mean age was 68 years, 
and 21.8% of the patients had diabetes mellitus, 
62.0% had stable angina, and 33.0% had had a 
previous myocardial infarction.
Procedural characteristics for the two trial 
groups are shown in Table 2. A total of 1568 
lesions (1.55 lesions per patient) were assessed 
in the iFR group, and 1436 (1.43 lesions per pa-
tient) were assessed in the FFR group (P 
= 
0.002). 
The mean (±SD) iFR was 0.91±0.10, and the mean 
FFR was 0.82±0.10. In the iFR group, 29.1% of 
the lesions were hemodynamically important, as 
compared with 36.8% of the lesions in the FFR 
group (P<0.001). Revascularization was performed 
in 536 patients in the iFR group and in 569 pa-
tients in the FFR group (P 
= 
0.11). PCI was the 
primary revascularization procedure in 81.4% of 
the patients who underwent revascularization.
Primary End Point
No patients were lost to follow-up. A primary 
end-point event occurred in 68 of 1012 patients 
(6.7%) in the iFR group and in 61 of 1007 (6.1%) 
in the FFR group (difference in event rates, 0.7 
percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
−1.5 to 2.8; P 
= 
0.007 for noninferiority) (Fig. 2). 
The upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in event rates fell 
within the prespecified noninferiority margin of 
3.2 percentage points. The hazard ratio, estimat-

ed with the use of an unadjusted Cox regression 
model, was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.58; P 
= 
0.53) 
(Table 3). No significant heterogeneity of treat-
ment effect was detected in subgroup analyses 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary End Points
The number of deaths from any cause at 12 
months did not differ significantly between the 
iFR group (15 deaths, including 8 from cardio-
vascular causes) and the FFR group (12 deaths, 
including 6 from cardiovascular causes) (P 
= 
0.57) 
(Table 3). The rates of nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, unplanned revascularization, and target-
lesion revascularization also did not differ signifi-
cantly between the two groups. One confirmed 
case of stent thrombosis occurred in the iFR 
group, and two confirmed cases occurred in the 
FFR group. Restenosis was observed in 1.9% of 
the patients in the iFR group and in 1.8% in the 
FFR group (P 
= 
0.87). Chest discomfort during 
the procedure was reported by 3.0% of the pa-
tients in the iFR group and by 68.3% of the 
patients in the FFR group (P<0.001).
Discussion
In patients with stable angina, unstable angina, 
or NSTEMI who had an indication for physiolog-
ically guided assessment of coronary-artery ste-
nosis, an iFR-guided revascularization strategy 
was noninferior to an FFR-guided revasculariza-
tion strategy with respect to the rate of major 
adverse cardiac outcomes and was associated 
with less chest discomfort. Our principal find-
ings are similar to those reported now in the 
Journal by Davies et al.16
Significantly more lesions were assessed in the 
iFR group than in the FFR group. It is possible 
that the adenosine-related chest discomfort that 
occurred when FFR measurements were obtained 
made the treating physicians less inclined to 
investigate additional lesions in patients with 
multivessel disease. This suggests that adherence

to the protocol in the FFR group was suboptimal 
owing to the expected side effects of adenosine.
Significantly more lesions were assessed as 
hemodynamically important in the FFR group 
than in the iFR group. As a result, there was a 
slight difference between the two groups in the 
number of stents implanted. The difference in 
the number of lesions assessed as hemodynami-
cally important is likely to be related to differ-
ences between iFR and FFR in terms of lesion

classification. Previous trials have shown 80 to 
85% agreement between iFR and FFR in the clas-
sification of lesions as hemodynamically impor-
tant when the iFR threshold is 0.89.8-10 Disagree-
ment between the methods has usually been 
found to occur when the stenosis severity is in 
the intermediate range, close to the threshold.8-10 
This variation is unlikely to have an important 
effect on clinical outcomes, since observed rates 
of death and myocardial infarction are low in 
patient populations with FFR values close to the 
threshold of 0.80.1-3,17
Data suggest that in cases in which iFR and 
FFR classify lesions differently, iFR is the more 
accurate measure. In the JUSTIFY-CFR study 
(Joined Coronary Pressure and Flow Analysis to 
Determine Diagnostic Characteristics of Basal 
and Hyperemic Indices of Functional Lesion 
Severity–Coronary Flow Reserve), iFR had better 
agreement with coronary flow reserve than did 
FFR.5 Also, FFR was found to be more likely to 
overestimate lesion severity than iFR, most likely 
because hyperemia causes a pressure drop below 
the FFR threshold of 0.80 in lesions of interme-

Instantaneous Wave-free Ratio vs. Fractional Flow Reserve
diate severity despite normal coronary flow. Pre-
vious validation studies of iFR, in which other 
indexes of ischemia have been used as references, 
have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of iFR 
is similar to or better than that of FFR.4-7 Valida-
tion studies of FFR have shown that FFR may 
correlate better with other indexes of ischemia 
when the threshold is 0.75, rather than 0.80.18,19 
Thus, the FFR threshold that was used in our 
trial may not have been optimal, although it was 
the threshold used in the FAME (Fractional Flow 
Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Eval-
uation) and FAME 2 trials.2,3
The proportion of evaluated lesions that were 
hemodynamically important was low in both 
groups. In the FAME trial, only patients with 
evidence of multivessel disease on angiographic 
assessment were enrolled, and 63% of the lesions 
were hemodynamically important.2 In our trial, 
we intended to include any patient with an indi-
cation for physiologically guided lesion assess-
ment, and the majority of the patients presented 
with single-vessel coronary artery disease. The low 
rates of hemodynamically important lesions that 
we observed most likely reflect the use of physi-
ologically guided assessment in current clinical 
practice, predominantly for coronary lesions of 
intermediate severity.
FFR-guided PCI has been shown to be superior 
to angiography-guided PCI with respect to clini-
cal outcomes.2,3,20 Despite evidence supporting the 
use of FFR and despite the class Ia recommenda-
tion from the guideline of the American College 
of Cardiology Foundation–American Heart Asso-
ciation–Society for Cardiovascular Angiography 
and Interventions for the evaluation of stenoses 
of intermediate severity,21,22 the clinical adoption 
of FFR is low.23 This may be in part because the 
use of adenosine in the catheterization labora-
tory has infrequently been associated with com-
plications.24-26 On the basis of the findings ob-
served in our study, iFR, which allows for lesion 
assessment without the use of adenosine, has the 
potential to increase the use of physiologically 
guided assessment among patients with coronary 
artery disease, the majority of whom still undergo 
angiographic assessment of lesion severity.
A noninferiority limit of 3.2 percentage points 
for the difference in event rates was chosen on the 
basis of the expected event rate of 8% in the FFR 
group. This cutoff corresponds to a noninferiority 
limit of 1.40 for the hazard ratio, which is con-
sistent with the limit used in other large cardio-
vascular-outcomes trials with a noninferiority de-
sign.27-29 In our trial, the overall event rates were 
lower than expected. Although the trial results 
showed that iFR was noninferior to FFR, the lower 
event rates meant that the fixed noninferiority 
limit of 3.2 percentage points allowed for a more 
generous confidence interval for the hazard ratio, 
a factor that constitutes a limitation of the trial.
Other trial limitations should also be noted. 
First, CABG was permitted as a revasculariza-
tion procedure if it was clinically indicated. Since 
evidence confirming the clinical benefit of using 
FFR guidance in CABG is limited, the inclusion 
of patients treated with CABG in the trial may 
be considered a limitation. Second, reporting a 
continuous biologic variable, such as iFR or FFR, 
in a dichotomous manner (i.e., above vs. below 
a threshold) may omit clinical information from 
the decision-making process and represents a 
limitation to the clinical applicability of the trial. 
Finally, the treating physicians and the patients 
were aware of the group assignments, which 
could potentially have led to bias in the decision 
to perform unplanned revascularization.
In conclusion, among patients with an indi-
cation for physiologically guided assessment of 
coronary-artery stenosis, an iFR-guided revascu-
larization strategy was found to be noninferior 
to an FFR-guided revascularization strategy with 
respect to the rate of major adverse cardiac 
events within 12 months after the procedure.
