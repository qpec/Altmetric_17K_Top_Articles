IMPORTANCE Perioperative hypotension is associated with an increase in postoperative
morbidity and mortality, but the appropriate management strategy remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether an individualized blood pressure management strategy
tailored to individual patient physiology could reduce postoperative organ dysfunction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Intraoperative Norepinephrine to Control Arterial
Pressure (INPRESS) study was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial
conducted in 9 French university and nonuniversity hospitals. Adult patients (n = 298) at
increased risk of postoperative complications with a preoperative acute kidney injury risk
index of class III or higher (indicating moderate to high risk of postoperative kidney injury)
undergoing major surgery lasting 2 hours or longer under general anesthesia were enrolled
from December 4, 2012, through August 28, 2016 (last follow-up, September 28, 2016).
INTERVENTIONS Individualized management strategy aimed at achieving a systolic blood
pressure (SBP) within 10% of the reference value (ie, patient’
s resting SBP) or standard
management strategy of treating SBP less than 80 mm Hg or lower than 40% from the
reference value during and for 4 hours following surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of systemic
inflammatory response syndrome and dysfunction of at least 1 organ system of the renal,
respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and neurologic systems by day 7 after surgery.
Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome, durations
of ICU and hospital stay, adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 30 days after surgery.
RESULTS Among 298 patients who were randomized, 292 patients completed the trial
(mean [SD] age, 70 [7] years; 44 [15.1%] women) and were included in the modified
intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome event occurred in 56 of 147 patients (38.1%)
assigned to the individualized treatment strategy vs 75 of 145 patients (51.7%) assigned to the
standard treatment strategy (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .02; absolute risk
difference, −14%, 95% CI, −25% to −2%). Sixty-eight patients (46.3%) in the individualized
treatment group and 92 (63.4%) in the standard treatment group had postoperative organ
dysfunction by day 30 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84; P = .001). There
were no significant between-group differences in severe adverse events or 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients predominantly undergoing abdominal
surgery who were at increased postoperative risk, management targeting an individualized
systolic blood pressure, compared with standard management, reduced the risk of
postoperative organ dysfunction.

 T
he number of patients undergoing major surgery world-
wide is growing with advancements in treating disease.1
However, many patients still die or experience severe
perioperative complications.2
Hemodynamic instability is common during surgery.
There is accumulating evidence that intraoperative hypoten-
sion is associated with injury to heart, kidney, and brain and
an increased likelihood of mortality in high-risk patients.3-6
However, intraoperative hypotension is a preventable risk
factor as arterial pressure is modifiable using intravenous flu-
ids and/or vasopressors. There is no consensus regarding
optimal blood pressure target thresholds to support perfu-
sion of critical organs during surgery. Systolic blood pressure
(SBP) less than 80 mm Hg,6,7 mean arterial pressure less than
60 mm Hg,4 and a reduction of 30% to 50% from baseline are
common treatment thresholds used in clinical practice,7,8
highlighting the lack of consensus. Current guidelines from
the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart
Association9 in the setting of noncardiac surgery recommend
individualizing care for surgical patients with associated
comorbidities. In patients with preexisting hypertension, the
autoregulatory capacity of the brain and kidneys is likely
impaired,10,11 thus rendering organs more susceptible to
ischemia at low blood pressure. Accordingly, higher blood
pressure targets tailored to individual patient physiology may
be preferable for such high-risk patients.4,5,8,12 Consensus
guidelines in the context of critical illness have suggested
adjusting blood pressure targets to premorbid values.13 How-
ever, trial data are lacking for an individualized strategy in
the surgical setting.
This multicenter, randomized, stratified clinical trial in-
volvinghigh-risksurgicalpatientssoughttodeterminewhether
a strategy of targeting individualized systolic blood pressure,
tailored to the patient’
s usual value, would reduce organ dys-
function as compared with standard practice.
Methods
Study Design
This was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, stratified,
parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted in 9
French university and nonuniversity hospitals. The trial
protocol was approved for all centers on January 5, 2011,
by the ethics committee at the Clermont-Ferrand University
Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each
patient before randomization and surgery. The trial protocol
and the statistical analysis plan are available in Supple-
ment 1. An independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee oversaw the study conduct and reviewed blinded
safety data.
Study Participants
Patients were assessed for eligibility on the eve of their sur-
gery. Patients were eligible for participation if they were
aged 50 years or older, were scheduled to undergo surgery
under general anesthesia with an expected duration of 2
hours or longer, had an American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists physical status of class II or higher, had a preoperative
acute kidney injury risk index14 of class III or higher, and did
not meet any exclusion criteria. The acute kidney injury risk
index ranges from I to V, with higher classes indicating a
higher risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (eAppendix
in Supplement 2). Patients were excluded if they had severe
uncontrolled hypertension (SBP ≥180 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure ≥110 mm Hg); had chronic kidney disease
(glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or requiring
renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease); had
acute or decompensated heart failure or acute coronary syn-
drome; had preoperative sepsis or were already receiving
norepinephrine infusion; required renal vascular surgery; or
were enrolled in another study. Detailed exclusion criteria
are listed in the eAppendix in Supplement 2.
Study Interventions
Eligible patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a stan-
dard or individualized treatment strategy. The resting blood
pressure from the preoperative anesthesiology consultation
was obtained from the patient medical record and used as
the reference value. If this was unavailable, the blood pres-
sure measurement recorded by a nurse of the surgical ward
the day before surgery, while the patient was in supine posi-
tion, was used as the reference value. In the standard treat-
ment group, patients received intravenous ephedrine admin-
istered in 6-mg boluses (for a maximum dose not exceeding
60 mg), as recommended,15 for any decrease in SBP below
80 mm Hg or lower than 40% from the patient’
s reference
value.7 In the individualized treatment group, SBP was tar-
geted to remain within ±10% of the reference value using a
continuous infusion of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine was
diluted as 2.5 mg in 250 mL of 0.9% saline. The infusion rate
of norepinephrine was adjusted according to a dedicated
table (eAppendix in Supplement 2). In both groups, lactated
Ringer solution was infused intravenously at a rate of
4 mL/kg per hour to satisfy maintenance fluid requirements.
Additional fluids were given based on a protocolized hemo-
dynamic algorithm,16,17 using 6% hydroxyethyl starch
(molecular weight of 130 kDa, substitution ratio of 0.4) in
0.9% saline administered in 250-mL boluses to achieve and
Key Points
Question Does a strategy based on individualized blood pressure
management reduce postoperative complications among high-risk
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial involving 292 patients,
most of whom underwent abdominal surgery, an individualized
management strategy of targeting a systolic blood pressure within
10% of the patient’
s normal resting value, compared with standard
practice, resulted in significantly lower rates of postoperative
organ dysfunction (38.1% vs 51.7%, respectively).
Meaning Among patients undergoing abdominal surgery, an
individualized blood pressure management strategy during
surgery tailored to individual patient physiology may improve
postoperative outcomes.

 maintain a maximal value of stroke volume (eAppendix in
Supplement 2). In the individualized treatment group, a
reduction in the norepinephrine infusion rate was recom-
mended in the case of severe bradycardia (heart rate <40
beats/min). In the standard treatment group, if SBP remained
below the target value after a maximum dose of 60 mg of
ephedrine, the use of norepinephrine was permitted as res-
cue therapy. Group assignment was not modified, and data
analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat
basis. The intervention period lasted from anesthesia induc-
tion to 4 hours after completion of surgery. With the excep-
tion of the interventions described earlier, decisions regard-
ing all other aspects of patient care during and after surgery
were at the discretion of the attending physician according to
local expertise and clinical practice. To avoid extremes of
practice, invasive blood pressure measurement through a
radial catheter was required. Additional details are given in
the trial protocol in Supplement 1.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of systemic inflamma-
tory response syndrome18 (SIRS) and at least 1 organ system
dysfunction for the renal (defined by a risk, injury, failure, loss,
and end-stage kidney injury [RIFLE] stage of risk or higher19),
respiratory (need for invasive or noninvasive ventilation for
respiratory failure), cardiovascular (acute cardiac failure or
myocardial ischemia or infarction), neurologic (stroke or al-
tered consciousness, defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score
≤14), and coagulation (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
[SOFA]20subscore≥2pointsinthecoagulationcomponent)sys-
tems occurring by day 7 after surgery. The occurrence and se-
verity of organ dysfunctions were assessed at least once daily
and at the time of follow-up evaluation.
The prespecified secondary outcomes included the indi-
vidual components of the primary composite outcome;
changes in hemodynamic variables; the SOFA score on days 1,
2, and 7; the SIRS score21; postoperative complications; dura-
tions of intensive care unit and hospital stay; and all-cause
mortality at 30 days after surgery. Postoperative complica-
tions within 30 days after surgery were defined as infectious
complications (sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock using
the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions22), respiratory com-
plications (hypoxemia, pneumonia, need for noninvasive or
invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, acute
respiratory distress syndrome), neurologic complications
(stroke, altered consciousness), cardiovascular complications
(cardiac arrhythmia, acute heart failure, myocardial infarc-
tion), and surgical complications (anastomotic leak, surgical
site infection, reoperation). Adverse events included severe
bradycardia (ie, heart rate <40 beats/min) and major bleeding
(ie, transfusion of ≥4 units of red blood cells). More details of
thesedefinitionsareprovidedinthetrialprotocolinSupplement
1. Other end points not reported in this article are listed in the
eAppendix in Supplement 2.
Randomization and Blinding
Enrollment, randomization (1:1 allocation ratio), and data
collection were performed using a dedicated, secure, web-
based system. Randomization was performed with the use
of a minimization algorithm and stratified according to
study site, urgency of surgery, and surgical site (abdominal
or nonabdominal surgery). Although the research staff mem-
bers who collected data during surgery could not be blinded
to group assignments, much attention was given to ensuring
strict blinding during the follow-up period and during data
collection. The medical team who provided care during the
postoperative period (ie, in the intensive care unit and the
surgical ward), investigators, patients, the statistician, and
the data and safety monitoring committee were unaware
of the group assignments. Outcomes were verified according
to predefined criteria by the principal investigator or desig-
nee at each site. Automated validation checks included plau-
sibility ranges and cross-checks between data fields. Further
data checks were performed centrally and through source
data verification.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that a sample of 268 patients would provide the
trial with 95% power to detect an absolute difference of 20%
with respect to the primary outcome, at a 2-sided α level of .05,
assuming an event rate of 40% in the composite outcome in
the standard treatment group.14,21,23,24 The choice of 20% as
expected difference in the primary outcome was based on the
effect size observed in an earlier study in high-risk surgical
patients.25 To account for potential protocol deviations and
withdrawal of consent, the recruitment target was 300 pa-
tients. An independent data and safety monitoring commit-
tee performed a blinded and planned interim analysis after en-
rollment of 50% of patients using the Lan-DeMets method to
evaluate adverse events. There was no stopping rule for effi-
cacy when considering the primary outcome. The committee
recommended that the study be continued.
All analyses were conducted before the randomization
code was broken, in line with the International Conference
on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All
the analyses were performed on data from the modified
intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly
assigned participants who initiated the study intervention
and did not withdraw consent for the use of their data. An
unadjusted χ2 test was used for the primary outcome analy-
sis. Multiple logistic mixed regression analysis was used to
identify relevant baseline covariates associated with the pri-
mary outcome, in addition to the stratification variables
(center treated as a random effect). Adjusted analyses were
performed with the use of robust Poisson generalized linear
model regression,26 including a random effect to account for
center effect, and are presented as relative risks with 95%
confidence intervals. Results for the primary outcome are
additionally reported as absolute risk reductions with 95%
confidence intervals. The Hochberg procedure was used to
adjust for multiple testing of components of the composite
primary outcome.27 A random-effects model was used to
model longitudinal differences in SBP between treatment
groups, taking into account between- and within-patient
variability, in addition to center effect. Kaplan-Meier curves
were plotted for organ dysfunction for renal, respiratory,

 cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation systems and
compared by marginal Cox model. Follow-up time was cen-
sored at 30 days following surgery. The time to organ dys-
function was analyzed using a marginal Cox proportional
hazards model with results reported as hazard ratios with
95% confidence intervals, and proportional hazard assump-
tion verified using the Schoenfeld test and plotting residuals.
As less than 5% of data were missing, handling of missing
data was not applied. We did not compensate for dropouts
caused by the withdrawal of consent or surgery cancellations
after randomization. With the exception of the components
of the composite primary outcome, no adjustment was made
for multiple comparisons; therefore, secondary outcomes
should be considered exploratory. All hypothesis tests were
2-sided, and P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance. The statistical analysis was conducted using Stata
software version 13.0 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Study Population
During the study period from December 4, 2012, through
August 28, 2016, a total of 1494 patients were screened for
eligibility, and 298 patients were ultimately enrolled and ran-
domized (Figure 1). Last follow-up was September 28, 2016.
Data on the primary outcome were available for 292 patients
(mean [SD] age, 70 [7] years; 44 [15.1%] women; 147 patients

 fluids infused over the intervention period and the cardiac
index values were not significantly different between study
groups (Table 2). Six patients (4.1%) in the individualized
treatment group and 22 (15.2%) in the standard treatment
group met SBP targets throughout the intervention period
without any need for vasopressor (absolute difference, 11%;
95% CI, 4%-18%; P = .001). Thirty-eight patients (26.2%) in
the standard treatment group required rescue therapy with
norepinephrine to achieve the target SBP value because of
persistent hypotension despite receiving ephedrine (Table 2).
Outcomes
A primary composite outcome event within the first 7 days
after surgery was confirmed for 56 patients (38.1%) in the
individualized treatment group and 75 patients (51.7%) in the
standard treatment group (adjusted relative risk, 0.73; 95%
CI, 0.56 to 0.94; P = .02), for an absolute risk difference of
−14% (95% CI, −25% to −2%) (Table 3). The results of associ-
ated bivariable and multivariable analyses are provided in
eTable 2 in Supplement 2. With the exception of the study
group, none of the variables tested in the model were associ-
ated with the primary outcome.
Renal dysfunction (RIFLE stage of risk or higher) oc-
curred in 48 patients (32.7%) in the individualized treatment
group and 71 patients (49.0%) in the standard treatment group
(absolute risk difference, −16%; 95% CI, −27% to −5%; ad-
justed relative risk, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92; P = .01). Al-
tered consciousness occurred in 8 patients (5.4%) in the indi-
vidualized treatment group and 23 patients (15.9%) in the
standard treatment group (absolute risk difference, −10%; 95%
CI, −17% to −3%; adjusted relative risk, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16 to
0.75; P = .007). There were no significant differences be-
tween groups in the other major components of the compos-
ite primary outcome (Table 3).
Fewer patients developed sepsis during the first 30 days
after surgery in the individualized treatment group com-
pared with the standard treatment group (22 patients [15.0%]
vs 38 patients [26.2%], respectively; absolute risk difference,
−11%; 95% CI, –20% to –2%; adjusted relative risk, 0.54; 95%
CI, 0.34 to 0.86; P = .009). Sixty-eight patients (46.3%) in the
individualized treatment group and 92 (63.4%) in the stan-
dard treatment group had postoperative organ dysfunction
by day 30 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84;
P = .001) (Figure 3).
The median duration of hospital stay was 12 days (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 7-19 days) in the individualized treat-
ment group and 14 days (IQR, 7-23 days) in the standard
treatment group (median difference, −2.0 days; 95% CI, −4.0
to 1.0; P = .15). The median duration of intensive care unit
stay was 7 days (IQR, 3-11 days) in the individualized treat-
ment group and 6 days (IQR, 2-14 days) in the standard treat-
ment group (median difference, 1.0 day; 95% CI, −2.0 to 4.0;
P = .51). There was no significant between-group difference
in all-cause mortality within the 30-day follow-up period or
in the rate of adverse events (Table 3).
Discussion
A strategy of targeting an individualized SBP, as compared
with a standard management approach, resulted in signifi-
cantly lower rates of organ dysfunction after surgery.
Patients assigned to individualized treatment had signifi-
cantly lower rates of clinically important outcomes, notably

Systolic arterial blood pressures were higher in the individualized treatment
group (P < .001 by random-effect model for the between-group comparison
across the entire study intervention). The horizontal line in the center of each
box indicates the median; bottom and top borders of the box, 25th and 75th
percentiles, respectively; whiskers, 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR); and
circles, extreme outliers. The intervention period lasted from anesthesia
induction to 4 hours after completion of surgery. The median (IQR) duration of
surgery was 260 (170-365) minutes in the individualized treatment group and
280 (200-375) minutes in the standard treatment group. The median (IQR)
duration of the intervention period was 423 (342-550) minutes in the
individualized treatment group and 465 (390-600) minutes in the standard
treatment group.

 a lower risk for renal dysfunction and a lower risk for altered
consciousness, than patients in the standard treatment
group. There were no significant between-group differences
for the other individual components of the composite pri-
mary outcome.
A particular feature of this trial was the use of a primary
outcome that was a composite of SIRS and organ dysfunction
with a possible synergism between the components. Postop-
erative acute kidney injury, which is mainly related to hy-
poperfusionandsystemicinflammation,isassociatedwithsep-

cause of morbidity and mortality even in patients with nor-
mal baseline renal function.29 Early postoperative cognitive
dysfunction and confusion are common after major surgery
and are associated with prolonged recovery after surgery and
higher postoperative mortality.30,31
The observed effect of the individualized treatment strat-
egy in this trial was lower than the anticipated absolute risk
reduction of 20 percentage points. Although the expected rate
of organ dysfunction in this study was consistent with those
reported in surgical patients at the time the trial was de-
signed, the composite event rate was slightly higher than

 predicted.14,24 This was due, at least in part, to the inclusion
of a high-risk population; 49% of participants were aged 70
years or older, and 82% experienced chronic hypertension.
Most patients underwent abdominal surgery, which is associ-
ated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury,29 respira-
tory failure,32 sepsis, and death.33,34
The issue of intraoperative blood pressure management
has been debated for the past several years, a significant com-
ponent of the controversy being the minimal acceptable blood
pressure in anesthetized patients. The findings of this trial add
to the evidence of benefits of personalizing care, especially in
high-risk surgical patients.9 To our knowledge, this is the first
study to investigate the effects of individualizing blood pres-
sure management according to patients’preoperative values,
and the study differs from others that either examined the re-
lationship between different blood pressure thresholds and
outcome or used predefined fixed blood pressure targets. The
recent SEPSISPAM trial found no mortality difference in pa-
tients with septic shock who underwent resuscitation target-
ing a mean arterial pressure of either 65 to 70 mm Hg or 80 to
85 mm Hg35; however, patients with chronic hypertension in
the high target group had less kidney injury.
The overall between-group difference in mean SBP in the
present trial was 6.5 mm Hg, although the possibility of larger
variationsinbloodpressurebetweenmeasurementpointscan-
not be excluded. Large observational studies have suggested

a Adjustment was performed for stratification variables (study center, urgency
of surgery, and surgical site), study group, and acute kidney injury risk index.
bThe primary outcome was a composite of SIRS and at least 1 organ system
dysfunction for the renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and
neurologic systems by day 7 after surgery.
c The SIRS score (range, 0 [best] to 4 [worst]) assigns 1 point for each of the
following parameters: temperature higher than 38°C or lower than 36°C, white
blood cell count higher than 12 000/μL or lower than 4000/μL, heart rate
higher than 90 beats/min, and respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths/min or
PaCO2 less than 32 mm Hg.
dAcute kidney injury was assessed with the use of the 5-category RIFLE
classification system. Because the loss and end-stage kidney injury categories
are defined by durations of loss of kidney function longer than 7 days, they
were not assessed as part of the complications within 7 days of surgery.
e Altered consciousness was defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14 or less
(SOFA subscore of �1 point in the neurologic component).
f Scores on the SOFA scale range from 0 to 4 for each organ system, with higher
scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction.

 that even brief exposure to a 10–mm Hg reduction in SBP be-
low 80 mm Hg6 or a 5–mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pres-
sure below 70 mm Hg is associated with adverse outcomes.4,5
According to the trial protocol, hemodynamic data were sys-
tematically recorded at 10-minute intervals, but the duration
ofhypotensioneventswasnotrecorded.Asapproximatelyone-
quarter of patients required rescue treatment for persistent hy-
potension in the standard treatment group, the possibility of
a longer duration of hypotension cannot be excluded.
Major surgery is a significant risk factor for postoperative
sepsis. In this study, postoperative sepsis was significantly less
common in the individualized treatment group than in the
standard treatment group, which might be related to im-
proved tissue oxygenation and perfusion, thus rendering or-
gans less susceptible to infection. However, the association be-
tweenthearterialpressuretreatmentstrategyandsepsisneeds
to be explored further and should be considered only as a hy-
pothesis-generating concept for future research.
Protectionagainsthypoperfusionreliesprimarilyonmain-
taining adequate intravascular volume and organ perfusion
pressure. One strength of this trial is the use in both groups of
a protocolized hemodynamic algorithm to guide delivery of in-
travenous fluids and maximize stroke volume. Previous trials
have suggested a lower incidence of organ dysfunction with
goal-directed hemodynamic optimization during surgery.36 In
this trial, no between-group differences were noted in the car-
diac index or in the cumulative volume of fluids. No associa-
tion was found between the fluid composition and the pri-
mary outcome event.
This study has several limitations. The use of ephedrine

ported by literature.15,37 Moreover, phenylephrine is a selec-
tive α1-adrenergic agonist with a greater risk of negative ef-
fects on cardiac output,38 in contrast to ephedrine or
norepinephrine, which have β-adrenergic activity.37,39 Al-
though the use of norepinephrine rather than ephedrine in the
standard treatment group might have enhanced the study de-
sign,dataontheuseofnorepinephrinetomanagearterialpres-
sure in the operating room are relatively scarce. Further-
more, the efficacy and safety of intermittent intravenous
boluses of norepinephrine, rather than continuous infusion,
to treat a decrease in blood pressure have not been exten-
sively studied. More than 80% of patients had chronic hyper-
tension, and in these individuals, organ blood flow may be-
come pressure dependent at higher blood pressure limits due
toapossiblerightwardshiftoftheorganautoregulationcurves.
As discussed previously, the duration of hypotensive events
was not recorded, and substantial variations in blood pres-
sure between measurement points may have occurred. The
minimum duration of hypotension to trigger harm is unclear,
but a graded relationship between the duration of hypoten-
sionandpostoperativeacutekidneyinjuryhaspreviouslybeen
assumed.4,5Generalizabilitytopopulationsnotincludedinthe
trial, such as those with a lower risk of morbidity, remains to
be evaluated. Moreover, use of the resting blood pressure as
reference—whichmaynotbeavailableindailycare—ratherthan
preinduction values may represent a meaningful difference
with routine clinical practice. The intervention could not be
blinded, but the risk of bias was minimized through online ran-
domization to ensure the concealment of study group assign-
ments, the use of validated criteria for the primary outcome
that were not subject to observer bias, and health care work-
ers conducting postoperative care who were unaware of the
study assignments.
Conclusions
Among patients predominantly undergoing abdominal sur-
gery who were at increased postoperative risk, management
targeting an individualized systolic blood pressure, com-
pared with standard management, reduced the risk of post-
operative organ dysfunction.
