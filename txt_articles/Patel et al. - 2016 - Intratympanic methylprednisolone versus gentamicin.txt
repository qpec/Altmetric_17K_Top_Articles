 ectiveness trial

Summary
Background Ménière’s disease is characterised by severe vertigo attacks and hearing loss. Intratympanic gentamicin, 
the standard treatment for refractory Ménière’s disease, reduces vertigo, but damages vestibular function and can 
worsen hearing. We aimed to assess whether intratympanic administration of the corticosteroid methylprednisolone 
reduces vertigo compared with gentamicin. 
Methods In this double-blind comparative eff
 ectiveness trial, patients aged 18–70 years with refractory unilateral 
Ménière’s disease were enrolled at Charing Cross Hospital (London, UK) and Leicester Royal Infi
 rmary 
(Leicester, UK). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a block design to two intratympanic methylprednisolone 
(62·5 mg/mL) or gentamicin (40 mg/mL) injections given 2 weeks apart, and were followed up for 2 years. All 
investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was vertigo frequency over the 
fi
 nal 6 months (18–24 months after injection) compared with the 6 months before the fi
 rst injection. Analyses were 
done in the intention-to-treat population, and then per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT00802529.
Findings Between June 19, 2009, and April 15, 2013, 256 patients with Ménière’s disease were screened, 60 of whom 
were enrolled and randomly assigned: 30 to gentamicin and 30 to methylprednisolone. In the intention-to-treat analysis 
(ie, all 60 patients), the mean number of vertigo attacks in the fi
 nal 6 months compared with the 6 months before the 
fi
 rst injection (primary outcome) decreased from 19·9 (SD 16·7) to 2·5 (5·8) in the gentamicin group (87% reduction) 
and from 16·4 (12·5) to 1·6 (3·4) in the methylprednisolone group (90% reduction; mean diff
 erence –0·9, 
95% CI –3·4 to 1·6). Patients whose vertigo did not improve after injection (ie, non-responders) after being assessed by 
an unmasked clinician were eligible for additional injections given by a masked clinician (eight patients in the 
gentamicin group vs 15 in the methylprednisolone group). Two non-responders switched from methylprednisolone to 
gentamicin. Both drugs were well tolerated with no safety concerns. Six patients reported one adverse event each: three 
in the gentamicin group and three in the methylprednisolone group. The most common adverse event was minor ear 
infections, which was experienced by one patient in the gentamicin group and two in the methylprednisolone group.
Interpretation Methylprednisolone injections are a non-ablative, eff
 ective treatment for refractory Ménière’s disease. 
The choice between methylprednisolone and gentamicin should be made based on clinical knowledge and patient 
circumstances.

Introduction
Ménière’s disease causes devastating vertigo attacks.1 In 
the initial phases of the disease, no treatment decreases 
the frequency or intensity of the attacks.2 However, in 
aggressive phases with frequent and severe vertigo 
episodes, intratympanic injections of gentamicin are 
eff
 ective.3 This treatment is a minimally invasive 
outpatient procedure, but, since the therapeutic eff
 ects 
rely on the ototoxic properties of gentamicin, patients are 
left with a permanent vestibular defi
 cit.4 More worryingly, 
in up to 20% of cases, hearing function also deteriorates.5,6
Corticosteroids, which do not harm inner ear function, 
have also been used in Ménière’s disease,7 but, so far, no 
double-blind, prospective, randomised controlled trial of 
steroids versus gentamicin has been done. In a double-
blind study,8 control of vertigo after intra 
tympanic 
administration of the steroid dexamethasone was reported, 
but the control group received placebo, not gentamicin; 
study numbers were small (n=22); and a Cochrane review 
did not fully support its conclusions.5 In a trial of 
gentamicin versus dexa 
methasone treatment,9 dexa-
methasone was inferior at controlling vertigo, but the study 
was non-masked. As a result, opinions on the eff
 ective 
ness 
of intratympanic steroid injections vary widely.10–12
We did a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of 
intratympanic gentamicin versus methylprednisolone for

unilateral Ménière’s disease. Ménière’s disease is a 
fl
 uctuating disease with a strong placebo eff
 ect, and so we 
followed up patients for 2 years, as recommended by the 
American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck 
Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines.13 These guidelines were 
issued in 1995, but no double-blind randomised controlled 
trial on intratympanic injections has fully adopted them.
Methods
Study design and participants
This double-blind comparative eff
 ectiveness trial was 
done at two centres in the UK: Charing Cross Hospital, 
London (primary site) and Leicester Royal Infi
 rmary, 
Leicester (secondary site). Patients aged 18–70 years with 
defi
 nite unilateral Ménière’s disease, defi
 ned according to 
the AAO-HNS, who had experienced at least two episodes 
of rotational vertigo lasting at least 20 min in the previous 
6 months and who had shown no response to standard 
medical treatment were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion 
criteria were evidence of bilateral Ménière’s disease, 
additional neuro-otological disorders (eg, vestibular 
migraine, vertebro 
basilar transient ischaemic attack, or 
acoustic neuroma), concurrent middle ear disease, family 
history of unexplained deafness, known history of adverse 
eff
 ect to gentamicin or steroids, renal failure, severe 
disability (eg, neurological, orthopaedic, or cardiovascular) 
or serious concurrent illness that might interfere with 
treatment or follow-up, or pregnancy.
All patients provided written informed consent before 
enrolment. This study was done in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for 
Harmonisation’s Good Clinical Practice. All patients 
were individually discussed by MP, KA, and AMB and 
enrolled by MP and KA. The study was approved by the 
London-Fulham Research Ethics Committee, Imperial 
College Joint Research Compliance Offi
  ce, and the 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. 
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to methyl-
prednisolone (62·5 mg/mL) or gentamicin (40 mg/mL). 
The double-blind randomisation sequence was generated 
by constructing 15 blocks of four possible combinations, 
containing two methylprednisolone and two gentamicin 
treatments to keep drug allocation roughly equal 
throughout recruitment; a technical engineer outside the 
trial team constructed this sequence. The randomisation 
sequence was allocated in numerical order, retained and 
concealed by the Charing Cross Hospital and Leicester 
Royal Infi
 rmary pharmacy aseptic units who prepared 
each injection in unmarked 1 mL glass syringes and 
documented the drug history of each patient. The 
pharmacy units assigned participants to interventions, 
but did not reveal the drug sequence to any member of 
the trial team. All investigators and patients were masked 
to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Intratympanic injections were done in outpatient ear, 
nose, and throat clinics (appendix p 2). Two injections 
were given, the second 2 weeks after the fi
 rst. We chose 
methylprednisolone rather than dexamethasone as the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov between July, 2008, 
and April 21, 2016, for English-language studies with the terms 
“Ménière’s disease”, “gentamicin”, “steroid”, and “intratympanic”. 
We identifi
 ed no double-blind randomised controlled trial 
comparing intratympanic gentamicin with corticosteroids in 
unilateral refractory Ménière’s disease. Findings from previous 
open-label trials showed a benefi
 cial eff
 ect of intratympanic 
gentamicin versus placebo, but no defi
 nitive results were 
available for intratympanic corticosteroids. However, in the 
absence of evidence, many ear, nose, and throat surgeons use 
intratympanic steroids, but their effi
  cacy is contested. Two recent 
Cochrane reviews highlighted the shortage of double-blind 
randomised controlled trials in Ménière’s disease. This shortage is 
probably because of the diffi
  culty recruiting patients and the 
long 2-year follow-up needed to meet the requirements for 
reporting results set out by the American Academy of 
Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery.
Added value of this study
We present fi
 ndings from, to our knowledge, the fi
 rst 
double-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing 
intratympanic gentamicin with methylprednisolone in 
unilateral Ménière’s disease. Both gentamicin and 
methylprednisolone injections controlled vertigo attacks and 
vestibular-mediated disability in refractory unilateral Ménière’s 
disease. Furthermore, the number of patients experiencing a 
clinically meaningful deterioration in speech perception was 
higher in those receiving gentamicin than in those receiving 
methylprednisolone.
Implications of all the available evidence
Two eff
 ective treatments exist for refractory unilateral 
Ménière’s disease: intratympanic gentamicin and steroids. 
Gentamicin is a vestibulotoxic (ie, ablative) treatment and the 
loss of vestibular function after injection is expected. If we add 
to this the small but not negligible risk to hearing posed by 
gentamicin injections, patients and doctors should weigh 
carefully individual circumstances and preferences when 
choosing a drug. Corticosteroids would be preferred by many 
patients because they have no side-eff
 ects and, unlike 
gentamicin, are suitable in bilateral disease.

steroid treatment because intratympanic perfusion in 
animals suggested higher endolymphatic concentrations 
of methylprednisolone than dexamethasone.14 Methyl-
prednisolone in human beings also produces high 
perilymph concentrations15 and, if mineralocorticoid 
receptor binding is important in hearing recovery,16 
methylprednisolone has greater affi
  nity for this than 
dexamethasone. From a practical viewpoint, high-dose 
dexamethasone (24 mg/mL) is not readily available in the 
UK and other countries, whereas methylprednisolone 
is readily available in most pharmacies at various 
concentrations.
Patients were advised not to change any previous oral 
drug or dietary treatments for Ménière’s disease. Drug 
treatments for other illnesses were not restricted and 
patients saw their general practitioner as needed for 
general medical care.
Patients were assessed at baseline (0 months) and at 1, 
2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months (appendix p 3). An audiogram 
was obtained just before the second injection (2 weeks 
after the fi
 rst), which was assessed by a masked clinician 
(MH) and fi
 ndings reported to the pharmacy. For patients 
who had a 20 dB drop in hearing across any 
two consecutive frequencies, the pharmacy, without 
informing the trial team, switched gentamicin for saline. 
Since steroids do not disturb hearing, patients randomly 
assigned to methylpre 
dnisolone were given a second 
methyl 
prednisolone injection.
If vertigo attacks returned at any time during the trial 
(ie, the patient was a non-responder) the unmasked 
clinician (BMS) prescribed a further course of intra-
tympanic injections, but the patient and everybody else 
involved remained masked to treatment allocation. The 
clinician had the choice to prescribe the same drug or 
swap, basing this decision on the patient’s response to 
previous injections.
Patients completed the Vertigo Symptom Scale short 
form (VSS; 0–60 scale,17 comprising vertigo [VSS_V] and 
autonomic [VSS_A] subscales), the Dizziness Handicap 
Inventory (DHI; 0–100 scale),18 the Functional Level Scale 
(FLS; a six-point scale to assess eff
 ects of vertigo on daily 
activities13), Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI; 0–100 
scale),19 and Aural Fullness Scale (AFS; 0–10 analogue 
scale8) at baseline and 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
Pure-tone 
audiometry 
(Interacoustics, 
Middelfart, 
Denmark) was assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 
24 months. Pure-tone audiometry tests were contra-
lesional and ipsilesional air conduction thresholds at 0·25, 
0·5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 KHz and bone conduction at 0·5, 1, 
2, and 4 KHz. In the analysis, we took the mean ipsilesional 
pure-tone low-frequency threshold across 0·5, 1, 2, and 
3 KHz in line with the AAO-HNS recommendations for 
reporting hearing loss in Ménière’s disease.13 We used 
bone conduction thresholds in the speech audiometry 
assessment and for routine clinical assessment.
Assessment of speech discrimination was done at 
baseline and 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 months by ipsilesional 
suprathreshold word recognition. Arthur Boothroyd’s 
isophonemic 
word 
lists 
(Guymark, 
Southampton) 
comprising sets of ten words were played into the 
ipsilesional ear at the low-frequency pure-tone threshold 
of 0·5, 1, and 2 kHz +30 dB with masking sound in the 
contralesional ear as appropriate. The formula for 
masking level was low-frequency pure-tone threshold in 
the ipsilesional ear  minus  bone conduction mean 
threshold (0·5, 1, and 2 KHz) in the contralesional ear 
minus 40 dB. Speech loudness and masking were rounded 
to the nearest 5 dB. Step increments and decrements of 
10 dB for speech loudness and masking were used to 
attain the maximum speech discrimination score.
We did vestibular function tests to assess the vestibular 
response to the drugs, in particular the ototoxic eff
 ect of 
gentamicin, at baseline and 1, 2, 12, and 24 months, 
including caloric tests, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic 
potentials, and utricular centrifugation (appendix p 3).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was relief from vertigo,13 assessed as 
the number of vertigo attacks in the fi
 nal 6 months 
(18–24 months after the fi
 rst injection) compared with the 
6 months before the fi
 rst injection.13 The number of vertigo 
attacks was assessed during a face-to-face appointment 
before treatment and at 24 months of follow-up.
Secondary outcomes were the number of vertigo 
attacks in the fi
 nal 1 month compared with the month 
before the fi
 rst injection, questionnaire measures of 
audio-vestibular symptoms (VSS, DHI, FLS, THI, and 
AFS), and hearing levels measured with audiometry and 
speech 
discrimination. 
Primary 
and 
secondary 
outcomes, presented according to the reporting 
recommendations of the AAO-HNS13 are described in 
the appendix (p 3).
Statistical analysis
At the time of planning of our study, there were few 
published data on intratympanic gentamicin versus 
steroid treatment for Ménière’s disease. Hearing loss 
can be a substantial side-eff
 ect of gentamicin treatment 
for Ménière’s disease because it is an ablative drug, 
whereas steroids are not likely to cause this side-eff
 ect. 
We used the hearing loss data in the study by 
Sennaroglu and colleagues20 to make an estimate of 
hearing loss for the two types of treatment. In 
Sennaroglu and colleagues’ study,20 several patients 
were classifi
 ed as having total hearing loss, which 
occurred only in the gentamicin group. We assigned a 
value of –70 dB for total hearing loss. From these data, 
we calculated that the dexa 
methasone group had a 
mean hearing loss of –2 dB and the gentamicin group 
had a mean hearing loss of –11 dB. We estimated the 
eff
 ect size as the diff
 erence in hearing loss between the 
two treatments of 9 dB divided by the SD of 11 dB, 
giving an estimate of eff
 ect size for the diff
 erence 
between the two treatments in terms of hearing loss as

d=0·8. Using the package G*Power,21 we calculated that 
with the eff
 ect size set to 0·8, a two-tailed p value of 
0·05, and 80% power, we would need 26 patients per 
group. To allow for 10% dropout, and taking into 
account four-patient block randomisation, 30 patients 
per group were needed.
Baseline characteristics were compared between 
groups with independent-samples t tests. We did 
repeated-measures general linear model ANOVA to 
investigate drug diff
 erences (gentamicin vs methyl-
prednisolone), the diff
 erence between before and after 
treatment across all measured timepoints (ie, time), and 
interactions. For the number of vertigo attacks during 
the fi
 nal 6 months (primary outcome) and during the 
fi
 nal month, time refers to two intervals only 
(baseline vs fi
 nal), but for all other outcomes it includes 
all tested intervals. Drug actions were deemed to be not 
signifi
 cantly diff
 erent if there was no signifi
 cant drug or 
drug × time interaction eff
 ect for the variable under 
consideration in the ANOVA.
Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, 
and then per protocol (ie, removing treatment failures). 
We did χ² and independent-samples t tests where 
appropriate, and calculated standardised eff
 ect sizes with 
Cohen’s d. In addition to the main statistical analysis, we 
processed the results according to the categories 
recommended by the AAO-HNS (appendix p 3). Only 
fi
 ndings that diff
 ered between the main ANOVA analysis 
and the AAO-HNS-recommended reporting procedure 
are presented in the Results; all other fi
 ndings are 
presented in the appendix. 
For patients who were unable to complete an 
audiometry or vestibular test, a mean value was fi
 tted for 
data. All analyses were done in SPSS, version 22.
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00802529.

Results
Between June 19, 2009, and April 15, 2013, 256 patients 
with Ménière’s disease (according to the AAO-HNS)13 
were screened, of whom 19 declined to participate 
and 177 did not fulfi

recruited 
60 
patients 
with 
defi

unilateral 
Ménière’s disease:13 55 at the primary site and fi
 ve at the 
secondary site. 30 patients were assigned to the 
gentamicin group (15 women, 12 right-sided) and 30 to 
the methyl 
prednisolone group (ten women, 13 right-
sided). Mean age was 52·5 years (SD 10·5) and mean 
disease duration was 4·5 years (SD 4·5; table 1).
The 
intention-to-treat 
population 
comprised 
all 
60 patients. Baseline characteristics (table 1) did not diff

between groups. One patient in the gentamicin group was 
withdrawn at 12 months owing to loss of contact. This 
patient had a successful reduction in vertigo attacks at last

contact and was included in all analyses. Two patients 
allocated to the methylprednisolone group crossed over to 
gentamicin during follow-up at 7 months and 18 months. 
Both patients were judged to be treatment failures and 
were removed from the per-protocol analyses (appendix 
p 5), which also showed no diff
 erence at baseline 
between groups. Unless otherwise specifi
 ed, data for the 
intention-to-treat population are presented here. 
20 (67%) patients in the methylprednisolone group and 
19 (63%) in the gentamicin group had no attacks of 
vertigo between 18 months and 24 months after the fi
 rst 
injection. Thus, ten (33%) patients in the methyl-
prednisolone group and 11 (37%) in the gentamicin 
group had vertigo attacks. No diff
 erence between drugs 
was noted for the odds of having a vertigo attack in the 
fi
 nal 6 months (odds ratio 1·2, 95% CI 0·4–3·3; 
χ² p=0·79). The mean number of vertigo attacks 
decreased from 19·9 (SD 16·7) in the 6 months before 
the fi
 rst injection to 2·5 (5·8) in the fi
 nal 6 months in the 
gentamicin group (87% reduction) and from 16·4 (12·5) 
to 
1·6 
(3·4) 
in 
the 
methylprednisolone 
group 
(90% reduction; p<0·0001; table 2; fi
 gure 2). We noted no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence between groups for the number of 
vertigo attacks in the fi
 nal 6 months compared with the 
6 months before the fi
 rst injection (drug p=0·27; 
drug × time interaction p=0·51).
The mean number of vertigo attacks in the fi
 nal 
1 month compared with the month before the fi
 rst 
injection did not diff
 er between groups (drug p=0·33; 
drug × time interaction p=0·47; table 2; fi
 gure 3). Both 
drugs reduced the number of attacks (p<0·0001), 
gentamicin by 90% and methylprednisolone by 91%.
There was no signifi
 cant diff
 erence between drugs 
for VSS score (drug p=0·07; drug × time interaction 
p=0·74), 
DHI 
score 
(drug 
p=0·07;

drug × time interaction p=0·98), THI score (drug 
p=0·14; drug × time interaction p=0·57), and AFS score 
(drug p=0·07; drug × time interaction p=0·50; table 2; 
fi
 gure 4). Scores for the VSS_A and VSS_V subscales 
also did not diff
 er between groups (appendix p 5). Total 
scores decreased signifi
 cantly over time for VSS (change 
from baseline to 24 months 67% for gentamicin and 
76% for methylprednisolone; p<0·0001), DHI (59% and 
68%; p<0·0001, FLS (45% and 46%; p<0·0001), THI 
(43% and 54%; p<0·0001), and AFS (47% and 45%; 
p<0·0001).
Mean hearing level did not diff
 er between groups (drug 
p=0·96; drug × time interaction p=0·18; table 2; fi
 gure 5). 
Hearing levels did not signifi
 cantly change from baseline 
over time (p=0·07), with a 4% increase for gentamicin 
and 12% for methylprednisolone at 24 months. There was

also no signifi
 cant diff
 erence between drugs for speech 
discrimination (drug p=0·79; drug × time interaction 
p=0·13; fi
 gure 5; table 2), although there were signifi
 cant 
fl
 uctuations over the 24-month follow-up (p=0·03). 
Between baseline and 24 months, speech discrimination 
decreased in the gentamicin group (9%) and increased in 
the methylprednisolone group (15%).
AAO-HNS outcomes13 are presented in the appendix 
(pp 7–8). There were no diff
 erences between the intention-
to-treat analysis reported here and the AAO-HNS 
outcomes, except for speech discrimination. Eight of 
30 patients in the methylprednisolone group compared 
with three of 30 in the gentamicin group experienced 
a 
clinically 
meaningful 
improvement 
in 
speech 
discrimination (odds ratio 0·31, 95% CI 0·1–1·3), and 
three of 30 patients in the methylprednisolone group 
compared with nine of 30 in the gentamicin group 
experienced clinically meaningful worsening (3·9, 
0·9–16·0). The number of patients with improvement 
versus worsening of speech discrimination per group was 
compared statistically and showed a signifi
 cant advantage 
for methylprednisolone over gentamicin (χ² p=0·02; 
followed up with a Fisher’s exact test p=0·039). Results 
were similar when analysed per protocol (χ² p=0·01; 
appendix pp 7–8).
Further 
injections 
were 
needed 
for 
eight 
(27%) non-responders in the gentamicin group and 
15 (50%) in the methylprednisolone group (odds ratio 
0·36, 95% CI 0·1–1·1). The two patients in the 
methylprednisolone group who crossed over and were 
deemed treatment failures also needed further courses of 
gentamicin. There was no signifi
 cant diff
 erence between 
the number of non-responders in the gentamicin group 
and the methylprednisolone group (χ² p=0·06). In a post-
hoc analysis, the time before further injections were 
needed was 12·0 months (SD 3·6) in the gentamicin 
group and 9·4 months (4·3) in the methylprednisolone 
group. An independent samples t test showed no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence between groups (mean diff
 erence 
–2·6, 95% CI –5·9 to 0·7; p=0·17).
The total number of injections per patient was 
2·7 (SD 1·7) in the gentamicin group, and 3·7 (2·5) in the 
methylprednisolone group in the intention-to-treat 
analysis and 3·2 (1·6) in the per-protocol analysis. 
Independent samples t tests showed no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between drugs for the total number of 
injections needed in the intention-to-treat (mean 
diff
 erence 1·0, 95% CI –0·1 to 2·1; p=0·09) or per-protocol 
analyses (0·5, –0·4 to 1·3; p=0·32). 
There were no suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions, serious adverse reactions, or serious adverse 
events. Six patients reported one adverse event each: 
three in the gentamicin group and three in the methyl-
prednisolone group. The most common adverse event 
was minor ear infections, which was experienced by 
three patients: one in the gentamicin group and two in 
the methylprednisolone group. One patient in each 
group refused further injections after the fi
 rst for pain. 
Tympanoplasty was not needed for any patient, nor was 
there any evidence of persistent perforations. This 
fi
 nding was verifi
 ed by tympanometry before caloric 
testing at 1, 2, 12, and 24 months of follow-up.
At each injection, we asked patients to score pain from 
0 to 10 (0=no pain, 10=unbearable). In a post-hoc 
analysis, mean pain score for the fi
 rst injection was 
4·6 (SD 3·0) with gentamicin and 6·0 (2·7) with 
methylprednisolone. In an independent samples t test 
the mean diff
 erence between groups for pain from the 
fi
 rst injection was –1·4 (95% CI –2·9 to 0·0; p=0·053). 
For the second injection, mean pain score was 
4·6 (SD 3·4) with gentamicin and 5·0 (2·9) with 
methylprednisolone and an independent samples t test 
showed no signifi
 cant diff
 erence between drugs for pain 
(95% CI –2·1 to 1·2; p=0·61).

In a post-hoc analysis, severe vertigo and vomiting 
3–7 days after injection developed in eight (27%) patients 
after gentamicin and one (3%) after methylprednisolone 
treatment (odds ratio 10·5, 95% CI 1·2–90·7; p=0·01).
Vestibular tests showed ablation of vestibular function 
after gentamicin but not methylprednisolone injections 
(appendix p 8). Accordingly, vestibular function was 
signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between gentamicin and methyl-
prednisolone groups, as described in the appendix (p 8) 
for all tests (caloric canal paresis, vestibular evoked 
myogenic potentials, and utricular centrifugation).
Discussion
In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, we 
found no signifi
 cant diff
 erence between gentamicin and 
methylprednisolone at controlling vertigo. The overall 
reduction in vertigo attacks in the fi
 nal 6 months of 
follow-up compared with the 6 months before treatment 
was 90% for methylprednisolone injections and 87% for 
gentamicin, far higher than expected for spontaneous 
remission.22 The number of vertigo attacks was similar 
between groups for the fi
 nal 1 month, in the fi
 nal 
1 month compared with the 1 month before treatment, 
and in per-protocol analyses over both 6 months and 
1 month.
For the secondary outcomes, scores were signifi
 cantly 
reduced with both drugs for all validated vestibular 
questionnaires used (VSS, DHI, and FLS). In addition to 
long-duration vertigo attacks, these questionnaires 
incorporate several additional factors, including short-
duration attacks (VSS_V) as well as function-based, 
psychological, and autonomic components (FLS, VSS_A, 
and DHI), which all add to the aggregate disability of 
these patients. Most of the reduction in symptoms 
occurred sharply at the fi
 rst follow-up 2 months after the 
injections and, from then on, levels remained constant 
up to trial conclusion at 24 months. Pure-tone audiometry 
and speech discrimination also did not diff
 er between 
the two drugs, although some evidence of better 
discrimination was suggested for methylprednisolone 
over gentamicin; according to AAO-HNS trial-reporting 
recom 
mendations,13 
more 
patients 
experienced 
a 
clinically meaningful improvement and fewer patients 
experienced a clinically meaningful drop in speech 
discrimination after methylprednisolone compared with 
gentamicin, a diff
 erence previously noted in an 
unmasked study.9
In view of the disabling nature of the vertigo attacks in 
Ménière’s disease, we felt that depriving patients who did 
not respond to the initial programmed two injections 
from further treatment would be unethical. Therefore, 
patients experiencing two or more vertigo episodes 
lasting more than 20 min (ie, non-responders) received 
one to ten new injections, but we found no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence between drugs for the mean number of 
injections per patient or number of non-responders over 
the 2-year follow-up period, both for the intention-to-treat 
and per-protocol analyses.
Unpredictable attacks of vertigo are the main cause of 
disability in Ménière’s disease;1 accordingly, the primary 
outcome in this study was reduction in the number of 
vertigo attacks. Although non-invasive treatments for 
Ménière’s disease are ineff
 ective,23,24 delaying semi-
invasive treatments such as intratympanic injections for 
months or years is customary. This approach is reasonable 
for several reasons. First, Ménière’s disease is notorious 
for spontaneous fl
 uctuations and remissions.22,25 Second, 
intratympanic gentamicin exerts its eff
 ects through its 
well known ototoxic properties.26 Accordingly, patients 
and doctors are cautious before starting such treatment 
because acute iatrogenic vertigo, a permanent reduction 
in vestibular function, and hearing loss are possible after 
gentamicin injection.3,27 Hearing loss was present in 25% 
of cases in a Cochrane review,6 but was uncommon in

other meta-analyses.28,29 Third, up to 50% of cases progress 
to bilateral Ménière’s disease in the long term30 and, 
therefore, inducing an audiovestibular defi
 cit on one side 
with gentamicin is problematic if the other side might 
need similar treatment. For these reasons, intratympanic 
steroids have become a popular alternative because no 
permanent cochlea-vestibular damage is expected. 
However, neither a double-blind randomised controlled 
trial of the drugs nor consensus documents are available. 
Unsurprisingly, many otologists are sceptical about 
their value.10,31
Tests of vestibular function were not a trial outcome 
measure because they are generally poorly associated 
with clinical disability and symptom load.32,33 However, 
they were an essential part of the study as an objective 
way of monitoring vestibulotoxic eff
 ects of the drugs or 
progression of the underlying disease, or both. In the 
case of gentamicin, fi
 ndings from vestibular tests showed 
that the injected drug reached the inner ear and acted in 
the expectedly ablative manner. Conversely, as expected, 
methylprednisolone preserved vestibular function.
The action of gentamicin in the inner ear has been 
investigated 
extensively. 
Gentamicin 
accumulates 
predominantly in type 1 vestibular hair cells and causes 
subsequent atrophy of these cells as well as the whole of 
the neuroepithelium.26 The action of steroids on the 
inner ear remains speculative.34 Both glucocorticoid and 
mineralocorticoid receptors are present in the vestibular 
and cochlear systems. Steroids seem to have an eff
 ect on 
ion homoeostasis functions as well as immune 
modulation35 via both types of receptor. They also have an 
eff
 ect on aquaporins,35 a family of small transmembrane 
water transporters, and they play a part in regulating 
homoeostasis in the inner ear fl
 uids. Furthermore, 
steroids have an eff
 ect on absorption and osmotically 
coupled water fl
 ux.16,36
A main strength of this trial is the long-term follow-up of 
patients (2 years) in an attempt to minimise the eff
 ect of 
the natural fl
 uctuations in this disorder, in line with 
current recommendations.13 Most studies comparing these 
drugs have several limitations, including a retrospective 
approach, unbalanced patient numbers, underpowered, 
poor follow-up, and absence of randomisation and 
masking.5,6 Notwithstanding these drawbacks, some 
studies have reported good results using intratympanic 
steroids8,37 and some evidence of better hearing outcome 
with steroids,8 as we found in this study. The impression 
that gentamicin, in contrast to steroids, is a defi
 nitive 
treatment is not supported by our results; additional 
injections were needed in eight of 30 patients who received 
gentamicin and this could refl
 ect variable rates of diff
 usion 
through the round window or diff
 erent susceptibility of 
the labyrinthine epithelium in diff
 erent patients.38,39
The absence of a placebo control group and the 
retrospective collection of pre-treatment phase symptoms 
are potential limitations of this study. However, to be left 
untreated for 2 years or 6 months, respectively, would 
have been unethical and not acceptable to patients in 
severely symptomatic stages of the disease. Another 
possible limitation is the potential for loss of masking 
because methylprednisolone injections are more painful 
than gentamicin whereas gentamicin is more likely to 
induce a prolonged vertigo episode. However, at the time 
of the injection all patients were told that “it might sting” 
and that if they experienced vertigo they should “continue 
doing the rehabilitation exercises and it will all settle with 
time” (appendix p 2). No patient identifi
 ed which drug 
they received on the basis of their side-eff
 ects. Similarly, 
no masked researcher was confi
 dent about which drug a 
particular patient received and the matter was never 
discussed between patients and researchers. Finally, in 
view of the fl
 uctuations associated with the disease, a 
longer duration of follow-up would be desirable, but here 
we have complied with the minimum recommendations 
of the AAO-HNS for trial reporting in Ménière’s disease.
In summary, steroid injections are a non-ablative, safe, 
and eff
 ective treatment for refractory Ménière’s disease. 
Patients and clinicians have a choice of two eff
 ective 
treatments, but, on the basis of clinical knowledge and 
patterns in our data, either drug might be favoured in 
diff
 erent circumstances. For instance, for a patient with no 
geographical access to repeat injections, who is not afraid 
of a gentamicin-induced vertigo attack, and who does not 
rely professionally on hearing (eg, a non-musician), 
gentamicin might be appropriate. For a patient with easy 
access to further injections who is concerned about any 
further hearing loss and who does not wish to experience a 
vertigo episode after gentamicin injection, intratympanic 
methylprednisolone seems more appropriate.
