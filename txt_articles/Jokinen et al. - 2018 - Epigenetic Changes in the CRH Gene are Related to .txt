The aim of this study, comprising 88 suicide attempters, was to identify hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
-axis coupled CpG-sites showing methylation shifts linked to severity of the suicide attempt. Candidate methyl-
ation loci were further investigated as risk loci for a general psychiatric risk score in two cohorts of adolescents
(cohort 1 and 2). The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood using the Illumina
Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Subjects were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the se-
verity of the suicidal behavior. We included CpG sites located within 2000 basepairs away from transcriptional
start site of the following HPA-axis coupled genes: corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticotropin releas-
ing hormone binding protein (CRHBP), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), corticotropin re-
leasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2), FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and the glucocorticoid receptor
(NR3C1). The methylation state of two corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-associated CpG sites were signif-
icantly hypomethylated in the high-risk group of suicide attempters (n = 31) (cg19035496 and cg23409074) (p
b 0.001). Adolescent cohort 1 and 2 consisted of 129 and 93 subjects, respectively, and were stratified by the in
silico generated DAWBA measurements of a general psychiatric risk score into high-risk group (N~50% risk) or
controls. In adolescent cohort 2, cg19035496 was hypermethylated in subjects with a high general psychiatric
risk score. Our results show epigenetic changes in the CRH gene related to severity of suicide attempt in adults
and a general psychiatric risk score in adolescents.

1. Introduction
Suicide is a major preventable public health concern and suicide at-
tempt is associated with a considerable reduction in life expectancy
compared to general population (Jokinen et al., 2017b). Suicidal behav-
iors have multifactorial aetiology including both distal risk factors, e.g.
early life adversity (ELA), which through epigenetic modifications may
alter the development and lead to dysregulation of emotional and be-
havioral traits, and proximal risk factors, like serious life events and sub-
stance abuse (Turecki, 2014). Suicide is a complex, heterogeneous
phenotype, where the severity of suicidal behavior has been proposed
to include both the high intent to die and the choice of lethal suicide at-
tempt method (Silverman et al., 2007). Both high intent to die
(Stefansson et al., 2010) and a choice of a violent suicide attempt
method (Stenbacka and Jokinen, 2015) evince a higher risk of complet-
ed suicide in follow-up studies of suicide attempters and serious suicide
attempts may have distinct neurobiological underpinnings.
The cortisol stress response is one of the most promising candidate
suicide endophenotypes (Mann et al., 2009). Dysregulation in form of
hyperactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis mea-
sured with the dexamethasone test (DST) (non-suppression) has been
associated with increased risk of suicide in patients with mood disor-
ders in prospective studies (Coryell and Schlesser, 2001), for review
(Mann et al., 2006), especially in patients with a clinical history of
attempted suicide (Jokinen et al., 2007). Further, higher cortisol levels
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma have been reported in suicide
attempters compared to healthy volunteers (Chatzittofis et al., 2013)
as well as increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels in
the CSF in depressed suicide victims (Arato et al., 1989). Suicide vulner-
ability may be due to epigenetic alterations in molecular pathways in-
volved in HPA axis function. DNA methylation changes at the NR3C1
gene, encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, are higher than normal in

 the hippocampus of suicide victims exposed to early life adversity
(McGowan et al., 2009). Moreover, spindle and kinetochore associated
complex subunit 2 (SKA2), which modulates cortisol suppression, has
been proposed as a novel genetic and epigenetic target involved in the
pathophysiology of suicidal behaviors (Guintivano et al., 2014; Pandey
et al., 2016). Corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein
(CRHBP), FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and glucocorticoid recep-
tor gene (NR3C1) promoters were significantly hypermethylated in de-
pressed patients with largest effects in patients with severe suicidal
ideation (Roy et al., 2017). Even genetic studies point to significant asso-
ciations between FKBP5 and CRHR1 genes and a high rate of attempted
suicide (De la Cruz-Cano, 2017) and some genetic studies have reported
that CRHBP and FKBP5 genes interact with childhood trauma to increase
the risk for suicidal behavior (Roy et al., 2012).
The aim of this study was to detect HPA-axis coupled CpG-sites,
which showed alterations at the epigenetic profile in relationship with
severity of suicidal behavior. Since significant proportion of psycho-
pathological changes has early onset in childhood and adolescence
(Teicher and Samson, 2013), the candidate methylation loci were fur-
ther investigated and confirmed as risk loci for a general psychiatric
risk score in independent population-based cohorts of adolescents.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethics
The study protocols were approved by the Regional Ethical Review
Board in Stockholm (Dnrs: 00-194, 2015/1454-32) and the participants
gave their written informed consent to the study. Concerning adoles-
cent cohorts and expression data set, the studies were approved by
the Regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, and all participants
gave their written informed consent.
2.2. Patients
Patients (age of 18 years or older) followed-up clinically after a re-
cent suicide attempt at the Suicide Prevention Clinic at the Karolinska
University Hospital were invited to participate in the research study
with focus on neurobiological and psychological risk factors for suicidal
behavior. Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, intrave-
nous drug abuse, mental retardation or dementia were excluded from
the study. A suicide attempt was defined as a self-destructive act with
some degree of intent to die.
During the study period (between years 2000–2005), a total of 258
patients (89 men and 169 women) from the catchment area came
into contact with the Suicide Prevention Clinic after attempted suicide.
Among them, 61 patients met the exclusion criteria above, 50 patients
declined to participate in the study. Due to other reasons, e.g. initial re-
fusal to have a clinical follow-up, or moving to another part of the coun-
try, 47 patients were not proposed to participate in the study A total of
100 patients with a recent suicide attempt (33 men and 67 women)
participated in the study, yet only 88 of them had DNA samples.
2.3. Cohorts of Adolescents
In the next step, we made use of two previously published cohorts of
adolescents termed adolescent cohort 1 and adolescent cohort 2, re-
spectively. For adolescent cohort 1, a total of 129 adolescent volunteers
aged 14 to 16 years, were randomly selected from public school in Upp-
sala County between November 2012 and January 2013. The study had
the aim to investigate risk factors for psychiatric illness. Adolescent
cohort 2 included 93 adolescents aged 14–17, which were recruited be-
tween 2013 and 2014. More details on the samples and preprocessing of
the methylation specimens have been previously published (Ciuculete
et al., 2017).
2.4. Assessments of Severity of Suicidal Behavior
Patients were stratified into two groups (high-risk or low-risk)
based on the severity of the suicide attempt using following criteria:
violent suicide attempt method or a high score in the Freeman scale
or information of later completed suicide. The classification of vio-
lent and non-violent suicide attempts was performed using a
dichotomization with relevance concerning biological differences.
Self-poisoning and cuts in one wrist were considered as non-violent
suicide attempts, while all other, i.e. attempted drowning, shooting,
gassing or hanging were considered to be violent (Traskman et al.,
1981).
The Freeman scale consists of two parts, Reversibility and Interrup-
tion Probability, and showed very good discriminating validity, when
it was applied to a large sample of suicide attempt and suicide death
cases (Freeman et al., 1974). These two scales capture important aspects
of the suicide intent. Interrater reliability of reversibility of method rat-
ing was 0.97 and 0.80 for interruption probability (Freeman et al.,
1974). The Reversibility scale takes into account the quantity and type
of drug taken and the degree of self-injury inflicted. A high score indi-
cates low reversibility of the suicide attempt method, i.e. a more serious
suicide attempt with high risk of death, and includes shooting or hang-
ing, while a low score indicates that the method is reversible and suicide
death less likely. The second part of the Freeman scales measures the
probability of interruption by others, where high scores indicate that in-
terruption is very unlikely. Both categories are coded on a 1–5 graded
scale and the range of scores on total Freeman scale is between 2 and
10 (Freeman et al., 1974). A cut-off N6 was applied to define a serious
suicide attempt.
All patients were linked to national Cause of Death register by their
own unique identification number. Four patients completed suicide be-
fore January 2011. Three patients had died by hanging and one patient
with substance intoxication.
2.5. Phenotype Assessment in the Cohorts of Adolescents
The risk for psychiatric diseases was assessed by performing the De-
velopment and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) web-based interview
designed for individuals in the age range 5–17 years to generate Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-based psychiatric diagnoses.
DAWBA consists of two versions of individual standardized question-
naires, administrated to adolescents and their parents. Computer gener-
ated diagnostic predictions were used in the present study. The average
of the ‘probability bands’ was computer-assisted generated referring to
several diagnoses such as anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic
stress disorder, autism, separation anxiety disorder and obsessive com-
pulsive disorder. DAWBA diagnoses are given in the range of b0.1% to
over 70% probability that the individual could experience one of the
mentioned DSM-IV or ICD-10-based diagnosis.
2.6. Blood Sample Collection and Methylation Profiling
Blood samples from non-fasting participants were collected in
the morning according to standard procedures. Genomic DNA was
extracted from 88 samples using the phenol-chloroform method
(Sambrook et al., 1989). Subsequently, the EZ DNA Methylation –
GoldTM kit (ZymoResearch, USA) was used for bisulfite conversion.
Bisulfite converted DNA was thereafter hybridized to the Illumina
Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip, representing the methylation
state of over 850K CpG sites. The array was imaged using the Illumina
iScan system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the methylation
state percent of each CpG site was quantified for the entire study
group.

 2.7. Data Processing
Preprocessing of the methylation data was performed by back-
ground correction, adjustment of probe type differences, removal of
batch effects and probe exclusion. Subsequently, the global DNA meth-
ylation pattern was adjusted for white blood cell-type heterogeneity.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify sample out-
liers in the methylation data. Methylation preprocessing steps were
performed using the minfi (Aryee et al., 2014), watermelon
(Schalkwyk, 2013), sva (Leek et al., 2012), ChAMP (Morris et al.,
2013) and FactoMineR (Lê et al., 2008) packages of the Bioconductor
project operable in R software, version 3.3.0.
2.8. Background Correction, Adjustment of Type I and Type II Probes, Re-
moval of Batch Effects and Probe Exclusion
Methylation idat files were first loaded into the R environment using
the ‘read.metharray.exp’ function of the minfi package (v 1.18.2). There-
after, the efficient NOOB method was selected to correct for background
artifacts (Triche Jr. et al., 2013). Probes on the Illumina Methylation EPIC
BeadChip array come in two different designs which differ in dynamic
range and distribution of the DNA methylation pattern. We used the
Beta Mixture Quantile Dilation (BMIQ) function of the wateRmelon
package to adjust the methylation data for these probe type differences
(Teschendorff et al., 2012). In addition, the use of different analysis
plates could result in undesired batch effects and we used the ‘ComBat’
function of the sva package to correct for this potential bias (Johnson
et al., 2007). A total of 2483 probes were also filtered out as 75% or
more of the samples exhibited a detection p-value N 0.01. Moreover,
methylation levels of CpG sites annotated to known SNP loci could be af-
fected by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP:s) (Chen et al., 2013)
and probes located on sex chromosomes have been shown to be more
difficult to accurately normalize (Fortin et al., 2014). 197,719 CpG sites
were thus subsequently excluded as they were located on sex determin-
ing chromosomes or covering known SNP loci, according to the Illumina
annotation. In addition, probes with SNPs at target CpG or within probe
and cross-reactive probes were excluded based on Chen et al.'s annota-
tion (n = 22, 577) (Chen et al., 2013).
2.9. Correction for White Blood Cell Type Heterogeneity
DNA methylation measured in whole blood is composed of different
cell populations. Rask-Andersen et al. showed that changes in leukocyte
fractions could introduce significant variability in the DNA methylation
pattern, an effect that could bias downstream analyses. It is thus impor-
tant to adjust the global DNA methylation pattern for white blood cell
type heterogeneity (Rask-Andersen et al., 2016). We implemented a
minfi-based
statistical
procedure
of
the
Houseman
algorithm
(Houseman et al., 2012) to adjusted the global DNA methylation data
for white blood cell type heterogeneity, which uses raw intensity files to
calculate the relative proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, monocytes
(Mono), granulocytes (Gran), B cells (Bcell) and natural killer (NK) cells.
2.10. Criteria of Sample Exclusion
To investigate the global DNA methylation pattern regarding poten-
tial sample outliers, the ‘PCA’ function of the FactoMineR package was
used (31). A total of 31,493 probes were further studied and included
in the covariance matrix based on a threshold of 0.2 and a 95% reference
range, as performed by Voisin et al. (2015). The first principal compo-
nent explained 15.34% of the total variance and successively studied
vectors did not add significantly to the total variance. Outliers were
identified by visual inspection of the graphical display of the first princi-
pal component, where no samples have been excluded from further
analysis.
2.11. CpG Site Annotation and Selection of HPA-Axis Coupled Probes
More than 90% of the probes on the Illumina 450K methylation
Beadchip are also present on the Illumina EPIC BeadChip (Pidsley
et al., 2016). Therefore we used the expanded annotation produced by
Price et al., originally designed for the 450K array, to define, for each
CpG site, the distance to the closest transcriptional start site (TSS) and
the associated gene (Price et al., 2013). As such, only CpG-sites present
on both the EPIC array and Illumina 450K methylation beadchip were
considered for further analysis. In addition, we only considered CpG
sites located within 2000 base pairs (bp) up and downstream of the
TSS. Wagner et al. demonstrated that DNA methylation and gene ex-
pression are closely related within this region (Wagner et al., 2014).
Based on the hypothesis that HPA-axis is associated with severity of
suicidal behavior, we considered the following HPA-axis coupled genes:
Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticotropin releasing hor-
mone binding protein (CRHBP), corticotropin releasing hormone recep-
tor 1 and 2 (CRHR1), (CRHR2), FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and
the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). After the preprocessing steps
outlined above, all CpG sites annotated to any of the aforementioned

 genes were included in the study, resulting in 72 CpG sites investigated
in the subsequent analysis.
2.12. Characterization of the Expression Data Set
Eleven healthy male volunteers aged between 18 and 40 years were
recruited from the region of Uppsala, Sweden, between 2013 and 2014.
Blood analyses were performed before and after a meal intake. For the
purpose of this study, only the non-fasting blood samples were further
studied to match the prandial state. The Illumina Infinium 450K
BeadChip was used to measuere the genome-wide DNA methylation
pattern. RNA microarray expression was measured and analyzed using
the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 2.1 ST array (Li and Wong,
2001). More details on the sample and preprocessing of the methylation
and RNA specimens have been previously published (Rask-Andersen
et al., 2016).
2.13. The Genomic Context Analysis
The genomic context of the identified CpG sites (cg19035496,
cg23409074) was investigated using the WashU Epigenome Browser,
37/hg19 version. Moreover, potential gene interactions and transcription
factor binding sites were derived from chromatin analysis by paired-end
tag sequencing (ChiP-seq) libraries from the ENCODE consortium (The
E.P.C., 2012). Two different cell lines were analyzed for long-range inter-
actions, i.e. erythrocytic leukaemia cells (K562) and breast cancer (MCF-
7), targeting the transcription factors RNA polymerase II, estrogen recep-
tor alpha (ERalpha) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF).
2.14. Comparing the Methylation Levels in Blood and Brain Regions
To assess whether the methylation levels that we observed in blood
might be present in brain, we made use of the recently developed Blood

 Brain DNA Methylation Comparison Tool (http://epigenetics.iop.kcl.ac.
uk/bloodbrain/). Using this tool, we were able to investigate the correla-
tion coefficients between DNA methylation levels in whole blood and
four brain regions. Whole blood and brain samples were collected
using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, in a study de-
scribed in more details elsewhere (Hannon et al., 2015). The methyla-
tion levels between blood and four different brain regions, i.e.
prefrontal cortex (PFC), entorhinal cortex (EC), superior temporal
gyrus (STG) and cerebellum (CER), were correlated from 71 to 75
matched samples. Pearson's correlations having p-values b 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
2.15. Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using R statistics, version
3.3.0.
2.15.1. Data Analysis
Skewness and kurtosis of the distribution of continuous variables
were evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk's test. Both age and BMI of partic-
ipants were normally distributed. The t-test was subsequently used to
investigate group differences in continuous variables between the
high- and low-risk groups in an unadjusted manner. Chi-squared tests

2.15.2. Determination of Covariates
We considered the following variables as potential confounders on
the association analysis between DNA methylation and suicide risk
group, i.e. age, sex, BMI, depression, occurrence of borderline personal-
ity disorder, other personality disorder, alcohol dependence, substance
dependence, occurrence of completed suicide and the KIVS subscales.
To avoid overfitting by including too many covariates, we only included
parameters where there were group differences between the high- and
low-risk groups with a p-value b 0.1, evaluated through t-test and chi-
squared tests. As such, gender (p = 6.29E−03), occurrence of other
(non-borderline) personality disorder (p = 6.60E−02), alcohol depen-
dence (p = 9.35E−02) and occurrence of completed suicide (p =
1.25E−02) were included as co-variates.
2.15.3. Main Analysis
Associations between DNA methylation patterns and severe suicidal
behavior were tested through linear models using the ‘limma’ package
for R, applying an empirical Bayes method based on a moderated t-
statistic (Smyth, 2004). We assumed a linear model where the M values
of each CpG site were used as a quantitative dependent trait against
suicide risk group, where, sex, occurrence of other (non-borderline)
personality disorder, alcohol dependence and occurrence of completed
suicide were included as covariates. Confirmatory analysis of candidate
CpG loci were then performed by binomial logistic regression models of
a binary outcome variable of suicide attempt severity (high vs low) to
methylation M-values and adjusting for the same co-variates.
All analyses of the 72 tested CpG sites on the candidate genes were
accounted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method. A
Bonferroni-adjusted p-value b 0.05 was considered significant.
2.15.4. Adolescent Cohort Analysis
The adolescent cohorts were stratified by the in silico generated
DAWBA measurements of a general psychiatric risk score into high-
risk group (N~50% risk) or controls. We investigated candidate CpG-
sites by binomial logistic regression models, contrasting methylation
M-values in high-risk subjects and controls, and adjusting for age, sex
and BMI, where age and gender were treated as factor variables.
2.15.5. Investigation of Methylation and Expression Correlations in an Inde-
pendent Cohort
We investigated candidate CpG sites with regard to their modulatory
effect on transcriptional expression of the respective gene in the expres-
sion data set. Methylation M-values were correlated with normalized

3. Results
3.1. Behavior of the Clinical Outcome Variables
The mean age of the patients was 34 years (SD = 12.4; range
18—67). Eighty-six percent of the suicide attempters fulfilled criteria
for at least one actual Axis I psychiatric diagnosis. Most of them (71%)
had mood disorders, 5% adjustment disorder, 6% anxiety disorders and
4% alcohol abuse. Concerning psychiatric comorbidity, 25% of the pa-
tients had a comorbid anxiety disorder, 12% had a comorbid
substance-related disorder (mainly alcohol dependence) and 4% had a
comorbid eating disorder (bulimia nervosa). A personality disorder
was prevalent among 28% of the patients.
Using above mentioned criteria, 31 patients (35%) were classified as
a high-risk/severe phenotype. The high-risk group (n = 31) included
significantly more males (p b 0.01). There were no between-group dif-
ferences in BMI, occurrence of borderline or any other personality disor-
der, alcohol dependence or substance abuse. Patients from both groups
scored equally on the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Subscales mea-
suring expressed violent behavior during childhood and adulthood as
well as exposure to violent behavior during childhood and adulthood
(Table 1).
3.2. Investigation of 72 HPA-Axis Coupled Probes Reveals two CRH Associat-
ed CpG Sites to Be Significantly Hypomethylated in Patients With Severe
Suicidal Behavior
We performed linear regression models including methylation M-
values at each CpG site against a binary outcome variable of suicide at-
tempt severity (high vs low), adjusting for sex, alcohol dependence, oc-
currence of any non-borderline personality disorder and occurrence of
completed suicide. Out of 72 tested individual CpG sites, four were nom-
inally significant (p b 0.05), associated with the genes CRH, CRHBP and
CRHR1. Using the bonferroni multiple-testing correction, two of them,
i.e. cg19035496 (padj. = 0.0498) and cg23409074 (padj. = 0.0165) – lo-
cated 54 and 48 bp:s upstream of the TSS of CRH gene, – were signifi-
cantly hypomethylated in the high-risk group (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2).
These results were confirmed by independent binomial logistic regres-
sions, adjusting for the same co-variates, showing significant hypome-
thylation for both cg19035496 (p = 0.00751) and cg23409074 (p =
0.00275) (Supplementary Table 1).
3.3. Methylation Variation in Adolescents With High Risk of Psychiatric
Illness
In the adolescent cohorts, subjects were stratified into high-risk
group (N~50% risk) and controls based on the in silico generated
DAWBA measurements of a general psychiatric risk score. The outcome
of demographic and clinical variables of the adolescent cohort 1 and 2,
respectively, is illustrated in Table 3. The first cohort consisted of 129
adolescents, where 16 of them were in the high-risk group and 92
were controls. The subjects were in the majority females and the
mean age was 15.3 ± 0.60 years. There were no between-group differ-
ences in age, sex or BMI. The second cohort consisted of 93 adolescents,
also in the majority female subjects. The mean age was 15.7 ±
0.63 years. Controls had significantly more males (p = 0.019). There
were no between-group differences in participants' age or BMI.
We investigated candidate CpG-sites by binomial logistic regression
models, contrasting methylation M-values in high-risk subjects and
controls, and adjusting for age, sex and BMI. In adolescent cohort 1, no
association was found between DNA methylation of the candidate
CpG sites and the general psychiatric risk score. In adolescent cohort
2, cg19035496 was significantly hypermethylated in the high-risk
group (p b 0.01) (Table 4, Supplementary Table 2, Fig. 3), while no asso-
ciation was found for cg23409074.
3.4. Methylation Level of cg23409074 is Positively Correlated with Gene Ex-
pression of the CRH Gene in an Independent Cohort of 11 Healthy Male
Subjects
Methylation M-values of cg23409074 were correlated with normal-
ized expression values of the CRH gene inter-individually, using robust
linear regression models. This methylation locus was significantly posi-
tively correlated with CRH gene expression in the robust linear regres-
sions (p b 0.05) (Fig. 4), (Table 5).
3.5. The Genomic Context Analysis
In the genomic context, the identified CpG sites are located close to
each other (6 bp apart), within the TSS of CRH. This gene may interact
with DNAJC5B, TRIM55, LOC100505676 and RRS1 genes. The genomic
region including both CpG sites was a binding site for transcription ini-
tiation factor (TFIID) subunit 1, as defined by the ChiP-seq experiments
(Supplementary Figure) (The E.P.C., 2012).

 3.6. Blood-Brain Correlation of the CRH CpG Site
We showed that methylation variation at the identified cg23409074
and cg19035496 were significantly correlated between blood and four
different brain regions. Methylation levels at cg23409074 in blood
were positively correlated to cg23409074 methylation levels in all
four different brain regions (prefrontal cortex; r = 0.29, p = 0.01; ento-
rhinal cortex; r = 0.27, p = 0.02; superior temporal gyrus; r = 0.26, p =
0.02; cerebellum; r = 0.24, p = 0.03), in linear regression models,
(Figs. 5 and 6).
4. Discussion
In this study, we found that suicide attempters with high risk/severe
phenotype had reduced levels of methylation at two methylation loci,
i.e. cg19035496 and cg23409074 – located in the promoter region of
the CRH gene, compared to suicide attempters exposed to less serious
suicide attempts. Further, one of the detected loci cg19035496 was
hypermethylated in a cohort of adolescents at high-risk for psychiatric
illness. Importantly, methylation shifts at cg23409074 were positively
correlated with CRH gene expression in an independent cohort of
healthy male subjects. We used genome-wide methylation chips mea-
suring methylation patterns at over 850K CpG sites; however, based
on previous literature findings on HPA dysregulation in suicidal behav-
ior, we applied a targeted approach on candidate genes of the HPA axis.
Suicidal behavior was defined as a severe phenotype using
established criteria from the literature. Violent attempters may be phe-
notypically more similar to suicide victims compared to non-violent
attempters showing clearly impaired decision-making (Jollant et al.,
2005), lower levels of serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid
(5-HIAA) in CSF (Traskman et al., 1981), more low-grade neuroinflam-
mation (Isung et al., 2014; Lindqvist et al., 2009) and higher quinolinic
acid levels than those with non-violent attempts (Erhardt et al., 2013).
High suicide intent has been associated with post DST cortisol levels

 (Lindqvist et al., 2008) and low CSF and plasma oxytocin (Jokinen et al.,
2012), reflecting an impaired control of stress. Two studies have report-
ed an association between seriousness of suicide attempts and DST non-
suppression either at baseline (Norman et al., 1990; Targum et al.,
1983), or during the follow-up (Coryell, 1990). Serious attempt was de-
fined as an attempt with high medical damage (Norman et al., 1990)
and necessitating inpatient care (Targum et al., 1983). In the study per-
formed by Coryell et al., DST non-suppression was associated with psy-
chologically serious attempts during the follow-up (Coryell, 1990). In
another study, Roy (1992) reported that violent attempters had higher
post DST plasma cortisol levels than nonviolent attempters. Further,
DST non-suppression predicted future suicide in a long term follow-up
study of suicide attempters with mood disorders (Jokinen et al., 2007),
pointing that dysregulation of HPA axis can be seen as a candidate
endophenotype of high suicide risk. Importantly, suicide attempts
with both high suicide intent and violent methods are associated to
higher suicide risk compared to suicide attempts with lower intent or
non-violent suicide attempt methods (Stefansson et al., 2010;
Stenbacka and Jokinen, 2015).
The CRH gene plays a critical role in the regulation of the HPA axis,
which is the central system in the stress response. The postmortem stud-
ies reported increased numbers of CRH neurons in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus in depressed suicide victims reflecting ex-
cessive activation of the HPA axis (Raadsheer et al., 1994), increased
CRH immunoreactivity in monoamine-containing pontine nuclei
(Austin et al., 2003), increased CRH in the CSF (Arato et al., 1989), de-
creased number of CRH receptors in the frontal cortex (Nemeroff et al.,
1988) as well as an altered ratio of CRH-R1/R2 in the pituitary glands
of suicide victims (Hiroi et al., 2001). Recently, increased expression
levels of CRH in young suicide victims was reported (Zhao et al., 2015).
Our findings showing reduced levels of methylation at two loci within
CRH promoter in serious suicide attempters are in line with the literature
conclusions regarding the HPA axis dysregulation and earlier findings
concerning CRH in severe suicidal behavior including completed suicide.

 Interestingly, one of the detected loci was hypermethylated in ado-
lescents at high risk for psychiatric disorders, where the psychiatric
phenotype was assessed by the DAWBA tool. Research supports the the-
ory that a significant proportion of psychopathological changes has
early onset in childhood and adolescence (Teicher and Samson, 2013).
The early life adversities modulate emotional and cognitive phenotypes
through the epigenetic regulation of the HPA, related to increased sui-
cide risk (Turecki et al., 2012, 2014). In prospective registry studies, ad-
verse prenatal and perinatal events and circumstances, behavioral
problems as well as psychiatric illness in childhood have been associat-
ed with suicidal behavior in adulthood (Geoffroy et al., 2013). One of the
identified differentially methylated CpG loci, in relationship with severe
suicidal behavior in adult suicide attempters, showed also methylation
variation in adolescents at high risk for psychiatric illness. In adolescents
with high risk of psychiatric illness this CpG site was hypermethylated,
while in severe suicide attempters we found a hypomethylation. The in-
terpretation of these findings is a challenge since making a direct com-
parison between adolescent and adult cohorts regarding methylation of
genes expressed in the brain is very delicate since the brain develop-
ment is still in process at the adolescent stage. Most epigenetic markers,
including DNA methylation, undergo dynamic and reversible changes
during life. DNA methylation occurs for different reasons, but stressful
life experiences, are associated with changes in methylation in animal
models. In clinical studies, early life adversity is associated with epige-
netic changes and is an important confounder to be taken into account.
In this study, exposure to early life adversity as well as later stress expo-
sure, measured with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale, did
not differ between the two groups of suicide attempters. This finding
of the same differentially methylated CpG loci located in the CRH gene
lends further support to the involvement of epigenetic modulatory ef-
fect on the HPA axis dysregulation as a shared neurobiological marker
of psychiatric illness including suicidal behavior. Further, we have re-
cently reported that the same loci cg23409074 was significantly
hypomethylated in men with hypersexual disorder (Jokinen et al.,
2017a) indicating shared vulnerability to psychiatric illness associated
with epigenetic change in the CRH gene.
The strengths of the study are a representative patient population of
suicide attempters with thorough diagnostics of the psychiatric disor-
ders and a careful assessment of severity of suicidal behavior as well
as the consideration of possible confounders such as gender, childhood
adversity, and comorbidity patterns. Most of the suicide attempters
were treated with antidepressants. Medications are potential con-
founders and epigenetic mechanisms mediate treatment response
with potential implications for treatment resistant depression (Bigio
et al., 2016).
It is important to note that the cross-sectional design of the study
prevents to draw any conclusions about causality. Furthermore, the ad-
olescent cohorts consisted of adolescents with high risk scores for psy-
chiatric illness and not only severe suicidal behavior. However,
psychiatric illness is one of the most important risk factors for suicidal
behavior and HPA axis dysregulation is involved in both mental illness
and suicidal behaviors, with often early onset and intertwined trajecto-
ries. In addition, while cg23409074 was demonstrated to correlate with
gene expression of the CRH gene in healthy controls, it is still not dem-
onstrated to what extent this could reflect modifications occurring in
severe suicide attempters and a measure of CRH would have been of
value for the study. Whether the whole blood CRH component methyl-
ation reflects the effects on the brain is an important question to ad-
dress. Using a reliable tool to compare methylation between whole
blood and brain, the methylation levels at the both identified CRH
sites were significantly correlated between blood and four different
brain regions providing some support that the differential methylation
status observed in whole blood can reflect modifications occurring in
certain brain regions. Furthermore, the association analysis of methyla-
tion and expression was performed in a relatively small group of
healthy volunteers.
In conclusion, our results show epigenetic changes in the CRH gene
related to severity of suicide attempt in adults and a general psychiatric
risk score in adolescents. Significant blood-brain correlations in methyl-
ation suggest these alterations may impact on expressional profile of
CRH in brain.
