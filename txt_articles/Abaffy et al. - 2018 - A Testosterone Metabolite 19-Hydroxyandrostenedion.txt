Olfactory receptor OR51E2, also known as a Prostate Specific G-Protein Receptor, is 
highly expressed in prostate cancer but its function is not well understood. Through 
in silico and in vitro analyses, we identified 24 agonists and 1 antagonist for this receptor. 
We detected that agonist 19-hydroxyandrostenedione, a product of the aromatase reac-
tion, is endogenously produced upon receptor activation. We characterized the effects 
of receptor activation on metabolism using a prostate cancer cell line and demonstrated 
decreased intracellular anabolic signals and cell viability, induction of cell cycle arrest, and 
increased expression of neuronal markers. Furthermore, upregulation of neuron-specific 
enolase by agonist treatment was abolished in OR51E2-KO cells. The results of our 
study suggest that OR51E2 activation results in neuroendocrine trans-differentiation. 
These findings reveal a new role for OR51E2 and establish this G-protein coupled recep-
tor as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer.

G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as important factors in tumor growth and 
metastasis (1). Several GPCRs, such as the 5HT1c serotonin receptor (2), the M1, M3, and M5 
muscarinic receptors (3), and the α1B-ADR adrenergic receptor (4), can function as oncogenes 
when persistently activated. These GPCRs, which are normally expressed in fully differentiated, post-
mitotic neuronal cells, are able to induce cellular oncogenic transformation when introduced to an 
ectopic environment of proliferating cells and activated by agonist (5). In addition to oncogenes and 
tumor-suppressor genes essential for cancer initiation and progression, autocrine and/or paracrine 
secretion of GPCR-activating molecules and their downstream signaling events affect tumor growth, 
survival, and metastasis (6).

Olfactory receptors (ORs) are the largest family of GPCRs 
present in the olfactory epithelium but are also found in various 
ectopic or non-olfactory locations such as prostate, heart, pla-
centa, embryo, erythroid cells, spleen, kidney, gut, tongue, and 
carotid body (7). Some ectopic ORs also play roles in chemotaxis 
(8), muscle regeneration (9), blood pressure regulation (10), and 
hypoxia response (11).
OR51E2, or prostate-specific G-protein receptor (PSGR), is 
one of the most highly conserved and broadly expressed ectopic 
ORs (12–14). OR51E2 is present in healthy prostate tissue and 
shows significantly increased expression in prostate intraepi-
thelial neoplasia (PIN), prostate adenocarcinoma (PC), and 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (15–22).
The majority of prostate tumors start as androgen-dependent 
adenocarcinomas. As localized cancer progresses to a metastatic 
state, the number of neuroendocrine (NE)-like cells increases, 
contributing to the development of a highly aggressive form of 
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) known as neuroendo-
crine prostate cancer (NEPC) (23). Many clinical studies have 
demonstrated a correlation between neuroendocrine trans-
differentiation (NEtD) and PC progression with poor prognosis 
(24). Tumor-derived NE-like cells are localized in tumor foci 
and are non-proliferating, terminally differentiated cells rich in 
serotonin and positive for NE markers, including neuron-specific 
enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (CGA) (24).
The molecular mechanism underlying development of a 
neuroendocrine phenotype in PC is not fully understood. In the 
androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line, serum deprivation and 
agents that increase cAMP also increase expression of NEtD 
markers and genes indicative of neuronal phenotype (25).
In the olfactory system, ORs signal via the canonical cAMP 
pathway (26), and several reports have indicated cAMP-mediated 
signaling for ectopic ORs (27–29). Furthermore, high expres-
sion of the OR downstream targets adenylate cyclase 3 and 
Gαolf was recently identified in prostate tissue, supporting the 
role of cAMP-mediated pathway in ectopic OR activation (12). 
We hypothesized that agonist-mediated activation of OR51E2 
increases cAMP and facilitates cellular transformation, resulting 
in NEtD. Thus, ectopic expression of this GPCR in proliferating 
cells and ligand-dependent activation could enable this receptor 
to function as an oncogene.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of 
OR51E2/PSGR in a PSGR-Pten (Δ/Δ) mouse model accelerates 
PC development and progression (30). Furthermore, β-ionone, 
an agonist for OR51E2, decreased proliferation and increased 
invasiveness of human PC cells (31–33).
In this paper, we aimed to identify biologically relevant 
OR51E2 ligands using a combination of in silico investigations 
and experimental validation, and we also set out to study the 
effects of these ligands on androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. 
Currently identified OR51E2 agonists include the short-chain 
fatty acids acetate and propionate (10, 34), steroid derivatives, 
β-ionone (31), and lactate (11). However, it is not known whether 
activation of OE51E2 by endogenous ligands is involved in PC 
pathogenesis.
Here, we virtually screened >2,500 metabolites, experimentally 
validated 55 of these candidates in vitro, and ultimately identified 
24 new agonists and 1 antagonist for the human OR51E2 receptor. 
Among the agonists, we identified 19-hydroxyandrostenedione 
(19-OH AD)—which is synthesized by aromatase, an enzyme 
highly expressed in NEPC and CRPC—and N-acetyl-N-formyl-
5-methoxykynurenamine (AFMK), a tryptophan and melatonin 
metabolite. We detected endogenous production of 19-OH AD 
in the LNCaP cells stimulated with AFMK agonist. The identity 
of the newly discovered agonists, as well as significant differences 
in metabolomics signatures in agonist-stimulated PC cells indica-
tive of non-proliferation, prompted us to further investigate their 
effects on cell viability, cell cycle status, and several NE markers to 
examine if OR51E2 receptor activation drives NEtD.

homology Modeling
Amino acid sequences of bovine rhodopsin, the human adrenergic 
beta-2-receptor β 2AR, the mouse olfactory receptor MOR42-3, 
and the human olfactory receptor OR51E2, were initially aligned 
using an MAFFT program. Our model was built based on the 
crystal structure of β2AR (4LDO). We used BioEdit Sequence 
Alignment Editor1 to manually remove gaps in the β2AR and 
OR51E2 sequences and re-align Cys178 in OR51E2 (EC2) with 
Cys191 from the β2AR sequence (Figure S1 in Supplementary 
Material). The β2AR has a disulfide bond between the conserved 
Cys106 residue at the N-terminal end of TM3 and Cys191 
from EC2. Thus, to introduce a disulfide bond, we re-aligned 
equivalent cysteines in OR51E2 (Cys96-Cys178). In addition, 
the most conserved residues were also aligned (Asp41, Leu54, 
Cys96, Leu114, Asp120, Arg121, Tyr122, Pro128, Pro159, Tyr217, 
Asp287, Pro288, Ile290, and Tyr290). We used Modeller v.9.14 
to create homology models (35)2, and 20 homology models were 
made using an automodel script with the default optimization 
and refinement. Each model was assessed using a DOPE score 
(36). The best model, which had a DOPE score of −37275, was 
chosen for further analysis. The .pdb file was imported into ICM 
Software (MolSoft v.3.8, LLC, La Jolla, CA, USA) (37), and the 
protein structure was analyzed using Ramchandran Plot Analysis. 
Residues that were out of place (Glu90, Arg222, His180, Leu81, 
and Lys294) were optimized. The model was transformed into 
an ICM object and subjected to regularization and minimization 
using MMFF Cartesian minimization (300 steps). The minimized 
model was imported into Modeller and again evaluated to calcu-
late DOPE score (new DOPE = −38897). This final, minimized 
model was used for docking and Virtual Library Screening (VLS) 
in the ICM program.
Virtual library screening
The library used for VLS was selected from the HMDB3 and 
consisted of metabolites detected in human blood, tissue, 
urine, and saliva. VLS was performed with the ICM software as 
described previously (38). Briefly, the potential energy maps of

the receptor were made in a box with a 0.5-Å grid and a size of 
53 Å × 50 Å × 45 Å. The initial position of the ligand was set 
within the center of this box, which extends to the receptor inte-
rior [above the center positions of Ser107 and Ala108, which are 
equivalent positions to Ile112 and Val113 in MOR42-3 that are 
known to be part of the ligand binding pocket (39)]. The docking 
stimulation was set to 1 and the maximal number of conforma-
tions to 10. The remainder of the docking parameters was set at 
the default values. The VLS result lists ligand–metabolite pairs 
according to their scores, and lower scores indicate ligands that 
are more likely to bind to the receptor. Binding of the ligand to 
the receptor is described using Score and mfScore functions. The 
Score function is based on a theoretical calculation of receptor–
ligand binding energy.

The mfScore function is a knowledge-based potential derived 
from the frequencies of occurrence of various atom pairs within 
the experimental ligand/receptor complex structures deposited 
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (40). It represents a measure 
of statistical probability of interaction between the ligand and 
receptor. Our previous results indicate that both scoring func-
tions were equally successful in predicting ligands (38). The top 
50 hits from each scoring list are presented in Tables S1 and S2 in 
Supplementary Material.
cell culture
Prostate cancer LNCaP-FGC cells derived from lymph node 
metastatic site (passage 30–32) were obtained from the American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained at 37°C 
in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma R8758) enriched with 0.5% 
glucose (45%, Sigma G8769), 1% 1 M HEPES (Gibco-Thermo 
15630), 1% 100 mM Na-pyruvate (Gibco-Thermo 11360), 10% 
FBS (HyClone, SH30071.03), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/
mL streptomycin. At 4 to 5 days after seeding, cells were 70% 
to 80% confluent and the stimulus was applied at the indicated 
concentration for the indicated time. The medium was replaced 
every fourth day.
luciferase assay
Briefly, the OR51E2 plasmid was transfected into HANA3A cells 
along with a CREB-dependent luciferase (firefly) and a consti-
tutively active luciferase (Renilla) (34). Upon ligand binding, an 
increase in cAMP drives the expression of firefly luciferase and 
increases the signal. To control for variation in cell number and 
transfection efficiency, the luciferase signal was normalized to the 
activity of the Renilla luciferase in the same cells. All stock solu-
tions of chemicals (Table S11 in Supplementary Material) were 
prepared either in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol. Final 
dilutions were made in M10d medium. M10d is MEM medium 
enriched with 5% dialyzed FBS serum, which is devoid of small 
molecular weight compounds (<10,000 Da), since OR51E2-
transfected cells gave a high luciferase signal in the CD293 
medium (Gibco 11913-019, supplemented with 30 µM CuCl2 and 
2 μM l-glutamine) even in the absence of chemical stimulation 
and when compared to the basal activity of the control OR2W1 
receptor-expressing cells (data not shown). All compounds that 
did not show agonist activity in M10d were later diluted in CD293 
medium and tested for antagonist activity. The rest of the protocol 
was performed as previously published (34). Cells were exposed 
to candidate ligands for 3.5 h at various concentrations. For each 
compound that showed a response >2 SD of the baseline response 
(no chemical applied), the EC50 or IC50 was determined from a 
sigmoid dose–response curve using a Graph-Pad Prism (Graph-
Pad Prism Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were fitted to 
the equation: Y = Bottom + (Top−Bottom)/(1 + 10^((LogIC50
−X) * HillSlope)).
19-Oh aD Measurements Using lc/Ms
LNCaP cells were first grown in T-75 flasks until just fully conflu-
ent. Cells were then split into six T-25 flasks. Cells were exposed 
to 250 µM AFMK, or to the medium only, for 3 days. We used 
phenol-red free RPMI 1640 with 10% CD-serum (Hyclone, 
SH30068) or RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, as described in cell 
culture protocol. After 3 days, medium was collected and frozen 
at −80°C until LC/MS measurements.
In 2 mL polypropylene vial, 800 µL of cell media sample was 
vigorously mixed with 1 mL of ethyl acetate, centrifuged, and 
900 µL of the organic (top) layer evaporated under a stream of 
nitrogen at room temperature. To the dried residue, 20 µL of the 
following reagents was added for picolinoyl ester derivatization: 
40 mg of picolinic acid, 20 mg of 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhy-
dride (MNBA), 10 mg of 4-dimethyl-laminopyridine, 1 mL ace-
tonitrile, and 20 µL trimethylamine. After 20 min of incubation 
at 50°C, 30 µL of 0.1% formic acid in water was added and 25 µL 
of the sample was injected into the LC-MS/MS system [slightly 
modified from Ref. (41)]. LC conditions (Shimadzu 20 A series 
HPLC): Agilent Eclipse PLUS, C18, 50 × 4.6 mm, 1.8 µm particle 
size column; mobile phases A/B: 0.1% formic acid in water/
acetonitrile; elution gradient: 0–1 min 20–90%B, 1–1.5 min 
90%B, 1.5–1.7 min 90–20%B; run time: 5 min. The following 
mass spectrometer conditions were used for quantification (AB/
Sciex API5500 QTrap): after optimization of the electrospray and 
quadrupoles parameters by infusion of 100 ng/mL 19-OHAD at 
10 µL/min rate, 408.2/267.2 MS/MS transition.
Metabolomics gc-Ms analysis
LNCaP cells were first grown in T-75 flasks until just fully con-
fluent. Cells were then split into six T-25 flasks and exposed to 
agonists the following day: 250 µM AFMK, 100 nM 19-OH AD, 
or 1 mM propionic acid (PA), with six biological replicates in each 
group. After agonist treatment for 3 days, CM was removed and 
banked at −80°C, and the cells were rinsed with 10 mL ice-cold 
PBS. Next, 3 mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl was added, and the cells 
were scraped off the plates and transferred to 5-mL tubes that 
were previously cleaned with acetonitrile. Each flask was rinsed 
with an additional 2 mL of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, and the cell sus-
pensions were transferred to the 5-mL tubes and centrifuged at 
1000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed, and 200 µL 
of 0.6% formic acid in ice-cold dH2O was added to the cell pellets. 
Then, 20 µL of resuspended cell pellets were separated for protein 
measurements (Qubit Protein Assay kit, Cat. # Q33211, Thermo

Fisher Scientific), and 180 µL of acetonitrile was added to the 
remaining pellet. Prepared cell lysates were maintained at −80°C 
until metabolomic analysis.
For exploratory, non-targeted metabolomics via gas chro-
matography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), metabolites were 
extracted from cell lysates with methanol, methoximated in dry 
pyridine, and then silylated with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) 
trifluoroacetamide. Samples were analyzed on a 6890 N GC 
connected to a 5975 MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, 
USA) equipped with two wall-coated open-tubular (WCOT) GC 
columns connected in series (Agilent part 122-5512, DB5MS, 
15 m in length, 0.25 mm in diameter, with an 0.25-µm luminal 
film) separated by a microfluidic flow splitter to enable hot back-
flushing at the end of each run. Data were acquired by scanning 
from m/z 600 to 50 as the oven ramped from 70 to 325°C. Data 
were deconvoluted using AMDIS software (42). Metabolites were 
identified using our retention time-referenced spectral library, 
which is based in part on that of Kind et al. (43). Reported data 
are log2 transforms of the areas of deconvoluted peaks.
Data were normalized to the protein content in each sample. 
MetaboAnalyst 3.0 was used for statistical analysis (44). Briefly, 
peak intensity data were presented in columns and log2-nor-
malized. We used unpaired analysis, and data were auto-scaled 
(mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each 
variable). For pathway analysis, we used a Globaltest pathway-
enrichment analysis algorithm in MetaboAnalyst 3.0.
rT-Pcr analysis
LNCaP cells were grown in T-75 flasks until fully confluent. A 
split ratio of 1:6 was used to subculture the cells in T-25 flasks 
for 24 to 48 h before stimulation. Stimulation with agonists 
lasted 3 or 12 days. Medium was changed every 4 days in the 
12-day experiment. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol 
reagent (Invitrogen) and cleaned using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) 
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Integrity of total RNA 
was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was 
generated by reverse transcription using SuperScript II Reverse 
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers for the following genes 
were designed with the Primer 3.0 program: OR51E2, NSE, 
α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), α1H T-type calcium 
channel (Cav3.2), androgen receptor (AR), GAPDH, keratin 5, 
keratin 8, and keratin 18 (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). 
PCR amplification was performed with HotStart Taq Polymerase 
(Qiagen) using the following protocol: 95°C for 15 min followed 
by 30 cycles at the following times and temperatures: 95°C for 
15 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Final annealing was done at 
72°C for 5 min. Expression levels of the test genes were normal-
ized to GAPDH.
cell Proliferation assay
Cells were plated in five 96-well plates (100 µL cell suspension per 
well) and after overnight attachment when cells were 15% to 20% 
confluent, cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations 
of selected agonists. Cell growth and viability were estimated 
each day for the next 4 days by using Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent 
Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Cat. No. G7570) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
cell cycle analysis
LNCaP cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes. After overnight 
attachment, when cells were 40% to 50% confluent, cells were 
stimulated once with 100 nM 19-OH AD and 250 µM AFMK 
for the next 4 days. Cells incubated in the regular RPMI-1640 
medium served as controls. After treatment, cells were trypsi-
nized with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and fixed with 70% 
ethanol in PBS for 15 min at 4°C. Fixed cells were washed and 
incubated with 50 µg/µL RNase A and 20 µg/µL propidium iodide 
and subjected to cell cycle analysis using a Becton Dickinson 
FACSCalibur cytometer. Data were analyzed with BD CellQuest 
software. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate 
(three biological and three technical replicates).
lncaP Or51e2 Knockout cell lines
To generate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout LNCaP cells, we 
cloned sgRNAs targeting exon 2 of OR51E2 into LentiCRISPR.v2 
(Addgene #52961) for coexpression of sgRNA with Streptococcus 
pyogenes Cas9. We prepared lentiviral particles for each sgRNA 
vector by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with the LentiCRISPR, 
vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.g using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus). 
LNCaP cells were transduced with this virus at a multiplicity 
of infection (MOI) of <1 in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene. 
 
At 24 h post-infection, cells were selected with 2 µg/mL puro-
mycin for 72 h and then expanded for verification of gene 
editing and experimental analysis. Cells were harvested for 
genomic DNA and PCR amplification of the OR51E2 locus 
for the Surveyor Assay (Integrated DNA Technologies) 1 week 
after infection. Additionally, for stable cells harboring OR51E2 
sgRNA #1, PCR products were cloned into a TOPO-TA cloning 
vector (ThermoFisher Scientific) and Sanger sequenced to assess 
the rate of mutation.

Quantification and statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Computations 
assumed that all groups were samples from populations with the 
same scatter. The investigators involved in this study were not 
completely blinded during sample collection or data analysis. 
Significance was determined by (multiple) two-tailed unpaired 
t-test using Prism 7 software. A P value of 0.05 was considered 
significant.

the OR51E2 receptor were stimulated with the top candidate 
ligands. Responses were subsequently measured with a cAMP-
mediated luciferase reporter gene assay. First, a small library 
of 33 compounds identified as PC-associated metabolites 
was selected from the Human Metabolome Database HMDB 
(46). These compounds were identified from previous reports 
(47–49). Additional compounds previously identified as OR51E2 
agonists were also included: 1,4,6-androstatriene-17-β-ol-3-one; 
1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione; 
6-dehydrotestosterone; 
and 
β-ionone (31). Thus, a total of 37 compounds were used for the 
initial, small-scale VLS (Table S4 in Supplementary Material).

the best binders. The top nine compounds from each score list 
(italicized in Table S4 in Supplementary Material) were then tested 
in vitro, and the following metabolites were identified as novel 
agonists for OR51E2 (bold and italics): bradykinin, kojibiose, 
glycylglycine, l-histidinol N-acetylglutamic acid, and d-alanyl-
d-alanine. We also confirmed the previously reported agonist 
1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (Figure S2 in Supplementary 
Material) (31).
Next, a larger library of 2,511 human metabolites from the 
HMDB was selected for virtual screening and docking into 
the receptor pocket (Figures 1A,B). Here, the top potential 
ligands (in italics, Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material) 
were tested in vitro using a biologically relevant concentration 
range reported in the HMDB, and concentration–response 
curves were subsequently produced. In total, 55 compounds 
were tested (9 and 46, from the smaller and larger screens, 
respectively), and 24 agonists (Figure 1C; Figures S2 and S3 
in Supplementary Material) and 1 antagonist for OR51E2 
(Figure 1D) were identified. In each experiment, OR51E2-
expressing Hana3A cells were also stimulated with a known 
agonist, 1 mM PA, so we were able to compare the efficacy of 
each metabolite relative to PA. Furthermore, potency values 
(EC50) were determined (Table 1). Glycylglycine was the most 
efficient agonist, while l-histidinol was the most potent. Diverse 
metabolites were discovered as novel agonists for OR51E2. 
Concentration–response curves for metabolites from the large 
VLS screen that did not activate the receptor are presented in 
Figure S4 in Supplementary Material.
Some of the newly discovered agonists are: 19-hydroxyan-
drostenedione (19-OH AD), a hypertensive steroid (vasopressor) 
secreted by the adrenal gland (50–52), an intermediate in estrogen 
synthesis from testosterone (53) also found in porcine testes (54), 
and rat ovarian granulosa cells (55).
Acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine, a melatonin and 
kynurenamine metabolite, was previously reported to be abun-
dant in aggressive PC (56); estradiol (57); adenosine-2,3-cyclic 
phosphate; 8-hydroxyguanine; α-ketoglutaric acid; urea; glycine; 
and palmitic acid.
Because in situ estrogen production is an important factor in 
prostate carcinogenesis, and since the expression of aromatase, the 
enzyme that synthetizes estrogens from androgens, is increased 
30-fold in PC, we decided to further examine the presence and 
production of 19-OH AD in LNCaP cells (58, 59).
endogenous 19-Oh aD Production Upon 
Or51e2 activation With aFMK
We have developed a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) assay for the measurements of 19-OH AD in the 
cell media. LNCaP cells were stimulated with newly discovered 
agonist, 250 µM AFMK, for 3 days, and the 19-OH AD was 
measured in the cell medium (Figure 2). We used CD-phenol free 
RPMI1640 medium (Figure 2A) and regular RPMI1640 medium 
(Figure 2B) to estimate the production of 19-OH AD. Three 
times more 19-OH AD was detected when cells were stimulated 
in CD-phenol free medium (0.83 vs. 0.27 ng/mL). No 19-OH AD 
was detected in unstimulated cells (dotted lines in Figures 2A,B).

Metabolomic signatures of lncaP cells 
Treated With selected Or51e2 agonists
In addition to the newly discovered agonists 19-OH AD and 
AFMK, we also selected the previously identified OR51E2 agonist 
PA for metabolomic analysis (34). The cells were incubated with 
100 nM 19-OH AD, 250 µM AFMK, and 1 mM PA for 72 h, and 
non-targeted metabolomics analysis was performed to identify 
metabolites that differed significantly in the cell lysate and condi-
tioned medium (CM). Agonist treatment resulted in pronounced 
intra- and extra-cellular changes in metabolomic signatures, as 
seen in heat maps (Figures S5 and S6 in Supplementary Material, 
respectively). Differentially expressed features/metabolites iden-
tified in each group using the t-test (P < 0.05) and fold change 
(2-fold or greater) are presented in  Figures 4A–E; Figures S5–S10 
and Tables S5–S10 in Supplementary Material.
The top 15 differentially expressed extracellular metabolites 
are presented in Figures 3A–C. All three agonists also produced 
robust intracellular decreases in amino acids, especially serine 
and threonine, and also two glycolytic intermediates: glucose-
6-P and fructose-6-P (Figures 3D–F). Furthermore, agonist 
treatment resulted in decreases in both methionine and glycine 
levels. In addition to decreased lactic acid, significant decreases 
were noted in fumaric, malic, and succinic acids, all intermedi-
ates of the TCA. Interestingly, we detected an increased level of 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in all agonist-treated samples (fold 
change analysis, Figures S7B, S8B and S9B in Supplementary 
Material). We also observed decreased levels of myoinositol, 
inosine, adenosine, asparagine, aspartate, and guanosine, which 
have been previously reported as being depleted in metastatic 
PC tissue (47), indicating that activation of OR51E2 by agonists 
in LNCaP cells produces metabolic signatures similar to those 
observed in human metastatic tissues. Agonist treatment also 
reduced levels of intracellular urea, spermine/spermidine, and 
ornithine.
Fold change analysis of the CM revealed significantly 
increased glutamine (25-, 11-, and 51-fold, for 19-OH AD, 
AFMK, and PA, respectively), indicating that agonist-treated 
cells do not have an increased demand for glutamine as highly 
proliferating cancer cells usually do (Figures S10B, S11B, and 
S12B in Supplementary Material). Thus, these results argue for a 
non- or a low-proliferative phenotype. Decreased levels of doc-
osanoic and decanoic acid and increased levels of asparagine were 
also prominent in the CM in all three treatments (Figure 4G). 
The pathways most affected, as identified by MetaboAnalyst, 
were the serine, threonine, and glycine; alanine, aspartate, and 
glutamine; ketogenesis; arginine and proline; and beta-alanine 
metabolic pathways (Figure 4F).
Time-Dependent Modulation of cellular 
Proliferation
Our metabolomics results indicated reduced capacity for anabolic 
reactions in LNCaP cells following receptor activation, which 
prompted us to further analyze the effects of OR51E2 agonists on 
cellular proliferation. Moreover, because melatonin reduces cell 
proliferation, we examined whether AFMK, a melatonin metabo-
lite, also reduces or inhibits cell proliferation (60). LNCaP cells 
were stimulated with various concentrations of 19-OH AD and 
AFMK for 4 days and analyzed every 24 h using an ATP viability 
assay. At day 4, both agonists significantly decreased the number 
of viable cells when compared to the control, non-stimulated cells 
(Figure 5A).
cell cycle arrest
Next, we determined if the decrease in cell viability during ago-
nist stimulation is attributable to increased apoptosis or cell-cycle 
arrest. Cells were treated with various concentrations of agonists 
for 3 and 7 days. Both agonists increased the fraction of cells in 
the G0/G1 phase and decreased the number of apoptotic cells 
(Figure 5B). Our results are in agreement with previous reports 
that the majority of cells with a neuroendocrine-like phenotype 
show signs of resistance to apoptosis (61).
neuroendocrine Markers
To assess the effect of selected OR51E2 agonists on NEtD, we 
analyzed transcript levels after 3 and 12 days of stimulation of the 
following neuroendocrine, epithelial, and receptor genes: NSE; 
AMACR; keratins 5, 8, and 18; voltage-gated Ca channel α1 H 
(Cav3.2); AR; and OR51E2 receptor. NSE was used to specifi-
cally identify NEtD status, and although LNCaP (being a cell line 
established from lymph-node metastatasis) cells already express 
low levels of NSE, treatment with OR51E2 agonists significantly 
increase levels of the NSE transcript (Figures 5C,D; Figure S13A 
in Supplementary Material). These results correlate well with the

increased intracellular level of PEP detected in the metabolomic 
analysis (Figures S7B, S8B and S9B in Supplementary Material), 
since the glycolytic enzyme enolase catalyzes PEP synthesis. 
AMACR is an enzyme essential for isomerization of branched-
chained fatty acids and is present at very low levels in healthy 
prostate and increased in PC and NE-like cells (62). Since NE-like 
tumor cells express AMACR, we investigated whether activation 
of OR51E2 also increased AMACR levels. Indeed, AMACR levels 
were significantly increased after 3 and 12 days of agonist stimula-
tion (Figures 5C,D, and S13A).
Furthermore, 19-OH AD decreased the AR transcript after 
12 days, and although AFMK also showed a similar trend, it 
did not reach statistical significance (Figure 5D). Normal basal 
prostate epithelial cells are positive for K5, and expression of K5 
is also associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
during tumor progression and metastasis (63). K5 and K8 were 
not detected in the agonist-stimulated cells (data not shown). A 
significant decrease in K18, a luminal secretory marker, was found 
after 12 days of stimulation with 100 nM 19-OH AD (Figure 5D). 
Although Ca+2 entry through the voltage-gated calcium channel 
α1 H (Cav3.2) was previously reported to be involved in NEtD 
of LNCaP cells when cultured in steroid-free conditions, we did 
not detect changes in its transcript levels (data not shown) (64).
Or51e2 Knock-Out confirms ne-like 
Phenotype Upon receptor activation
To confirm receptor involvement in the agonist-mediated 
increase of NSE, OR51E2 was deleted using a CRISPR-Cas9 
method (Figure 5E). We designed three gRNAs to target Cas9 to 
the OR51E2-gene and generated a lentiviral sgRNA-Cas9 vector 
to deliver gRNA into the cells. The efficiency of each gRNA was 
measured, and we observed that by using sgRNA #1, OR51E2 
was abrogated in 80% of cells. These OR51E2-knockout cells 
were exposed to 1 µM 19-OH AD for 3 days and analyzed for 
the presence of specific markers (Figure 5E; Figure S13C in 
Supplementary Material). The summary of four independent 
experiments is presented in Figure 5E. Expression of markers 
is normalized to GAPDH levels. Representative gel is presented 
in S13B. A statistically significant decrease of NSE in OR51E2-
knockout cells in comparison with control cells was observed 
(from 0.579 ± 0.043 in control to 0.377 ± 0.04, P < 0.05, n = 4 
biological replicates, Figure 5E), confirming that increased 
NSE during stimulation with agonists is at least partially a 
receptor-mediated phenomenon (Figure 5E; Figure S13C in 
Supplementary Material).
DiscUssiOn
As the number of ectopic olfactory receptors associated with 
diverse pathological states continues to increase, the implications 
and significance of these receptors will be greatly enhanced by 
receptor “deorphanization” (i.e., defining the ligands). Previously, 
we successfully identified novel ligands for mouse OR using a 
similar in silico approach with VLS (38). Here, we present a highly 
successful approach of combining in silico and in vitro analyses to 
identify novel biologically relevant ligands for the human ectopic 
OR, OR51E2. This method can be used to elucidate ligand spe-
cificities of other ectopic ORs. Once identified, these new ligands 
can help define the role and function of ORs in cancer and other 
diseases.
Among the newly discovered metabolites identified as 
OR51E2 agonists, several were previously reported to be associ-
ated with PC, including bradykinin, kojibiose, glycylglycine, 
N-acetylglutamic acid, and d-alanyl-d-alanine (47). Thus, our 
results indicate that these metabolites are likely endogenous 
agonists. New agonists with known biological roles were also 
discovered: epitestosterone, known to be a major metabolite of 
androstenedione and testosterone (65) and androstanedione 
(also known as 5α-androstane-3,17-dione), an intermediate in 
steroid synthesis (66).
In addition to these agonists, we also identified a previously 
under-reported metabolite of the complex steroid biosynthetic 
network, 19-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione (19-OH AD) 
(53, 67, 68). It is produced by aromatase P450 (CYP19A1), 
which catalyzes the irreversible aromatization of the androgens 
androst-4-ene-3,17-dione and testosterone and their consequent 
conversion to estrogens.4 We detected this testosterone metabo-
lite in agonist-stimulated prostate cancer cells. These results 
demonstrate that 19-OH AD is actively produced by cancer cells 
when the OR51E2 receptor is activated. Thus, we demonstrate 
that 19-OH AD is an endogenous agonist produced by activation 
of OR51E2 in prostate cancer cells.
Aromatase is increased 30-fold in metastatic PC (59), and aro-
matase-knockout mice have a reduced incidence of PC following 
exposure to testosterone and estrogen, indicating that aromatase 
metabolites, mainly 19-OH AD and estradiol, are likely involved 
in prostate carcinogenesis. Results from our study demonstrate 
that 19-OH AD is a potent OR51E2 agonist (EC50 = 1.5−10 M) and 
support the notion that increased in situ estrogen production via 
19-OH AD is an important factor in PC (58).
Acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine is a metabolite 
of melatonin (69). Previous studies demonstrated that mela-
tonin reduces proliferation of LNCaP cells, leading to NEtD, 
and the phenotype was not reversed by melatonin receptor 
antagonists, suggesting that additional receptors may be 
mediating this process (60). An additional source of AFMK 
might be a tryptophan metabolic pathway (70). Tumors pro-
duce high levels of tryptophan and kynurenic acid metabolites 
(71). Significant amplification of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase 
(EC 1.13.11.11) TDO2, which catalyzes the oxidation of 
l-tryptophan to N-formyl-l-kynurenamine, was observed 
in NEPC and PC (72, 73). Thus, in more advanced stages of 
PC, AFMK production may be increased via this tryptophan 
metabolic pathway.
We also identified bradykinin as an agonist for OR51E2. 
Prostatic secretions of PC patients have elevated levels of human 
kallikrein 2 (74), which produces bradykinin and thus stimulates 
proliferation of androgen-independent PC cells in later stages of 
PC (75).

The OR51E2 antagonist 13-cis RA is an endogenous compo-
nent of human serum, and many of its actions can be explained 
by isomerization to all-trans RA and 9-cis RA, which both act via 
retinoid receptors. However, since 13-cis RA does not have potent 
gene regulatory activities, additional pathways via membrane 
receptors have been proposed to explain its pharmacological 
and anti-inflammatory actions (76). Our results demonstrate 
that 13-cis RA acts via the OR51E2 receptor when expressed 
heterologously.
OR51E2 receptor activation by 19-OH AD, AFMK, and PA 
induced pronounced metabolic reprograming of LNCaP cells, 
with the most significant changes being decreased intracel-
lular serine and threonine levels. Because metabolism of these 
amino acids includes one-carbon metabolism, which provides 
cofactors for biosynthetic reactions in highly proliferating 
cells, intracellular depletion may indicate a general decrease 
in anabolic reactions (77). Furthermore, an intracellular 
decrease in aspartate, which is normally required for protein, 
purine, and pyrimidine synthesis, and an increase in the CM 
indicate that agonist-activated LNCaP cells are not preparing 
for proliferation. We also detected decreased intermediates of 
glycolysis (glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate) in 
activated cells. Agonist treatment decreased intracellular lactate, 
suggesting a slower rate of glycolysis. An intriguing result was 
the increased intracellular level of PEP. We also found increased 
NSE transcription for the glycolytic enzyme enolase, which 
catalyzes the formation of PEP, indicating predominance of the 
PEP-forming reaction.
Neuron-specific enolase is not only a marker of neuronal 
differentiation and maturation characteristic of neurons and 
neuroendocrine cells (78), but it also has an important role in 
synaptogenesis (79) and is reported to be stable in the high-chlo-
ride environment characteristic of neurons, in which it reaches 
a concentration of 2% to 3% of the soluble protein (80). Taken 
together, these results indicate that receptor activation results in 
a neuronal-like phenotype of LNCaP cells.
Cystine was increased in the medium after 19-OH AD 
and AFMK treatments (Tables S12 and S13 in Supplementary 
Material). In healthy cells, cystine is transported into cells and 
reduced to cysteine, which can then be utilized for synthesis of 
gluthatione, a protective antioxidant. As a consequence of rapid 
cell growth during tumorigenesis, the production of reactive 
oxygen species increases, providing a proliferative signal for 
glutamine to enter the cell and, after deamidation, condense 
with cysteine to form a precursor of glutathione. However, in our 
experiments, the medium, but not the cells, showed increased 
levels of glutamine and cysteine, indicating a reduction in protec-
tive oxidative and proliferative signals in agonist-stimulated cells. 
The alanine/aspartate/glutamine pathway is the most affected 
biochemical pathway during NEtD of LNCaP cells induced 
by steroid-reduced medium, which corroborates our results 
(Figure 4F) (81). In cancer-associated fibroblasts, asparagine 
and aspartate are involved in glutamine synthesis (82), and 
our experiments showed decreased intracellular levels of these 
amino acids, suggesting increased use for intracellular synthesis 
of glutamine. These results might also indicate a decreased cel-
lular influx of asparagine, since it is abundant in CM. Flux studies 
will be necessary to determine the exact relationship between 
glutamine synthesis and transport in PC cells upon receptor 
activation.
To explain the role of OR51E2 in PC, we propose the fol-
lowing model: agonist stimulation generates new cells through 
asymmetric division and gradually increases the subpopulation 
of terminally differentiated cells expressing neuroendocrine 
markers.
NE-like cells from PC are characterized by increased expres-
sion of NSE and AMACR and decreased expression of K18 and 
AR (83). Increased expression of NSE and AMARC and decreased 
expression of AR and K18 following 19-OH AD and AFMK 
treatment demonstrate that these OR51E2 agonists induce a neu-
roendocrine phenotype. We confirmed that this effect is indeed 
receptor-mediated, as treatment of OR51E2-knockout LNCaP 
cells significantly reduced the NSE and AMACR transcript levels 
(Figure 5; Figure S13 in Supplementary Material).
Cell proliferation and differentiation have an inverse relation-
ship, and terminal differentiation coincides with proliferation 
arrest and exit from the division cycle. Our results demonstrate 
that agonist treatment during the first 3 days induces cell prolifera-
tion at a rate similar to control cells, but after 4 days the viability of 
these cells, as measured by ATP content, was significantly reduced. 
Our results also demonstrate that receptor activation results in a 
new subpopulation of cells that undergoes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest 
and has decreased DNA synthesis, which is concordant with the 
results from our metabolomics analysis. Cellular senescence is an 
irreversible growth arrest, and senescent cells actively suppress 
apoptosis. We found that agonist treatment decreases the fraction 
of apoptotic cells, indicating that growth arrest likely induces 
cellular senescence. Future studies are needed to confirm the 
irreversibility of this process.
Furthermore, recent whole-exome sequencing of NEPC and 
CRPC showed an overlap in genomic alterations, and in both 
demonstrated increased amplification of the OR51E2 gene, 
supporting our hypothesis that this receptor contributes to the 
NE-phenotype of PC (72, 73).
Prostatic adenocarcinomas typically contain foci of non-
proliferating NE-like cells that increase in number as cancer pro-
gresses (84). Although these cells are non-mitotic, proliferating 
carcinoma cells have been found in their proximity, suggesting 
that the non-proliferating NE-like cells likely provide paracrine 
stimuli for growth of the surrounding carcinoma cells. Our 
results demonstrate that activation of OR51E2 by newly dis-
covered PC-relevant agonists induces and/or facilitates cellular 
transformation, resulting in NEtD, a characteristic phenotype 
of CRCP. This indicates that activation of OR51E2 in PC might 
contribute to development of non-proliferating foci. Our data 
demonstrate that activation of OR51E2 results in NEtD and 
establish this GPCR as a novel and therapeutic target for NEPC
