Choices have consequences. Immune cells survey and migrate throughout the body and some-
times take residence in niche environments with distinct communities of cells, extracellular matrix,
and nutrients that may differ from those in which they matured. Imbedded in immune cell physi-
ology are metabolic pathways and metabolites that not only provide energy and substrates for
growth and survival, but also instruct effector functions, differentiation, and gene expression.
This review of immunometabolism will reference the most recent literature to cover the choices
that environments impose on the metabolism and function of immune cells and highlight their
consequences during homeostasis and disease.
Cells of the immune system possess particular sets of skills—
skills that are vital for host defense and tissue homeostasis
but also cause disease if not properly controlled—skills that
make them altogether fairly peculiar. Unlike other cells in the
body, immune cells possess the ability to respond to environ-
mental signals and assume a wide variety of distinct functional
fates. Immune cells can morph from dormant sentinels
into pathogen killing machines, migrate from one tissue to
another,
modulate
surface
receptor
expression,
clonally
expand, secrete copious amounts of effector molecules, or
exert controlling effects over neighboring cells. After the burst
of activity following an immune response, these specialized
cells can die, creating space and limiting tissue damage in a
particular environment, or return to resting states that allow
them to persist for extended periods of time in readiness for a
secondary response.
The activation, growth and proliferation, engagement of
effector functions, and return to homeostasis of immune cells
are intimately linked and dependent on dynamic changes in
cellular metabolism. The utilization of particular metabolic path-
ways is controlled on one level by growth factors and nutrient
availability dictated by competition between other interacting
cells and on another level by the exquisite balance of internal
metabolites, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reducing and
oxidizing substrates. Studying immune cells, particularly lym-
phocytes and myeloid cells, has lent deep insight into how
cells differentiate and coordinate their behaviors with meta-
bolism under a wide array of settings.
Leukocytes are also nomads and settlers. They migrate from
the place where they develop to survey the entire body and
sometimes take up residence in tissues in which they did not
originate. In doing so, they must adapt to an ecosystem
comprised of unique cells, extracellular matrix, growth factors,
oxygen, nutrients, and metabolites. How do they do this and
what are the genetic, metabolic, and immunological conse-
quences of these adaptations? In this review, we explore the in-
teractions between immune cells and the tissue environments
they inhabit, how these impinge on their metabolism, how their
metabolism instructs their function and fate, and how these rela-
tionships contribute to tissue homeostasis and disease patho-
logy. The central concepts of immune cell metabolism have
been covered extensively in several reviews (Buck et al., 2015;
MacIver et al., 2013; O’Neill and Pearce, 2016; O’Neill et al.,
2016; Pearce et al., 2013) and thus will not be discussed at length
here.
The Tumor Microenvironment
Recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy have shown that
eliciting immune responses against multiple types of cancer
can lead to considerably longer-lasting remissions, or in some
cases, complete regression of metastatic disease (Ribas,
2015). Although it is well known that cancer cells can evade im-
mune recognition through ‘‘immunoediting’’ (the process by
which antitumor immune responses, especially those from tumor
infiltrating T lymphocytes [TILs], select for cancer cell clones that
no longer express detectable tumor antigens) (Vesely and
Schreiber, 2013), the advent of effective cancer immunother-
apies has shown that additional mechanisms of immunosup-
pression exist that limit or impair antitumor immunity. Thus,
considerable efforts are underway to elucidate other mecha-
nisms that restrain antitumor responses to develop new and
more efficacious forms of therapy.
At the forefront of these mechanisms to consider, is how im-
mune cell metabolism, and thus immune cell function, is altered
by the tumor microenvironment. Tumors are a major disturbance
to tissue homeostasis, creating metabolically demanding envi-
ronments that encroach on the metabolism and function of the
stroma and infiltrating immune cells. The unrestrained cell
growth seen in cancer is often supported by aerobic glycolysis,
the same metabolic pathway needed to fuel optimal effector
functions in many immune cells (Pearce et al., 2013). At mini-
mum, this similarity potentiates a competition for substrates be-
tween tumors and immune cells. The demand for nutrients,
essential metabolites, and oxygen imposed by proliferative
570

 cancer cells, in combination with their immunosuppressive by-
products, creates harsh environmental conditions in which im-
mune cells must navigate and adapt (Figure 1). How tumor and
immune cells share or compete for resources in this environ-
ment, and how such relationships regulate antitumor immunity
are important questions to address.
Figure 1. Metabolic Tug-of-War within the Tumor Microenvironment
The balance of nutrients and oxygen within the tumor microenvironment controls immune cell function. Glucose and amino acid consumption by tumor cells can
outpace that of infiltrating immune cells, specifically depriving them of nutrients to fuel their effector function. Poorly perfused tumor regions drive hypoxia
response programs in tumor cells, macrophages, and T cells. Increased HIF-1a activity in response to hypoxia or other mechanisms promotes glycolysis and
increases concentrations of suppressive metabolites and acidification of the local environment. As a by-product of glycolysis, lactate concentration increases,
which is coordinately utilized by tumor cells to fuel their metabolism, promotes macrophage polarization, and directly suppresses T cell function. The ability of
T cells to target tumors is further limited by their upregulation of co-inhibitory receptors and engagement with their ligands on neighboring tumor cells and
macrophages. As T cells progressively enter a dysfunctional state, their mitochondrial mass and oxidative capacity declines, ultimately leading to their failure to
meet bioenergetic demands to sustain effector functions and control tumor cell growth.

 Hypoxia
When tumor growth exceeds the vasculature’s ability to fully
perfuse the tumor microenvironment with oxygen, regions of
hypoxia are established and induction of the hypoxia-responsive
transcription factor HIF-1a intensifies cancer cell glucose utiliza-
tion and lactate release (Eales et al., 2016). Using 13C-labeled
glucose, Hensley et al. (2016) traced the fate of glucose within
healthy lung tissue and tumors of patients with non-small lung
cell carcinoma and found that even within a single tumor, hetero-
geneity in glucose utilization exists. Lesser-perfused regions of
the lung tumors were associated with higher glucose meta-
bolism whereas higher-perfused regions could utilize circulating
lactate, transported through monocarboxylate transporter 1
(MCT1), as an alternative TCA cycle substrate (Sonveaux et al.,
2008). Lactate metabolism in oxygenated cancer cells also in-
creases glutaminolysis (Pe
´ rez-Escuredo et al., 2016). How this
metabolic heterogeneity in tumor cells relates to intratumoral im-
mune cell function has not been well elucidated, but exposure of
NK and T cells to high concentrations of lactate impairs their acti-
vation of the transcription factor NFAT and production of the
cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-g) (Brand et al., 2016). Lactic
acid also disrupts T cell motility and causes loss of cytolytic
function in CD8 T cells (Haas et al., 2015). Moreover, decreasing
conversion of pyruvate to lactate by genetic targeting of lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in tumors helps to restore T cell infiltra-
tion and function (Brand et al., 2016), linking lactate production to
immunosuppression observed in the tumor microenvironment
(Figure 1).
Lactate uptake by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
also stimulates tumor progression by inducing vascular endo-
thelial growth factor (VEGF) and arginase I (Arg1) expression
through HIF-1a (Colegio et al., 2014). Moreover, chronic VEGF
signaling in hypoxic areas leads to elevated glycolysis in endo-
thelial cells, resulting in excessive endothelial sprouting and
abnormal leaky vasculature (Goveia et al., 2014). Interestingly,
inhibition of REDD1, a hypoxia-induced inhibitor of mechanistic
target of rapamycin (mTOR), in TAMs increases their rates of
glycolysis to a level that competes with neighboring endothelial
cells for glucose and suppresses their angiogenic activity. This
metabolic tug-of-war over glucose helps restore vascular integ-
rity, improve oxygenation within the tumor, and prevent metasta-
ses (Wenes et al., 2016), providing an example of an intimate
metabolic relationship that exists between cells in tumors.
Hypoxia also has considerable effects on TIL function, prolifer-
ation, and migration (Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2016). Increases in
HIF-1a activity by culturing T cells in physiologic normoxia
(�3%–5% O2), genetic deletion of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) fac-
tor, or inhibiting activity of the oxygen-sensing prolyl-hydroxy-
lase (PHD) family of proteins, enhances CD8 T cell glycolysis
and effector functions and promotes antitumor immunity (Clever
et al., 2016; Doedens et al., 2013; Finlay et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2011). HIF-1a is also needed for the production of the metabolite
S-2-hydroxyglutarate (S-2HG), which can drive epigenetic re-
modeling in activated CD8 T cells and enhance interleukin (IL)-
2 production and antitumor defenses (Tyrakis et al., 2016).
Thus, one may expect that hypoxia would potentiate HIF-1a
activity and TIL effector functions in tumors, however, this
is not what is observed. In addition to signals received from
IFN-g, HIF-1a also induces the expression of the suppressive
ligand PD-L1 in tumor cells, TAMs, and myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells (MDSCs) (Noman et al., 2014), and this can lead
to TIL suppression via PD-1 (Figure 1). Moreover, recent work
in both mouse and human tumors showed that CD8 TILs lose
mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and oxidative capa-
city, particularly within the most dysfunctional PD-1+ CD8
T cells (Scharping et al., 2016). The loss of mitochondrial function
in TILs correlated with diminished expression of PPAR-gamma
coactivator 1a (PGC1a) over time and a block in their prolifera-
tion and IFN-g production. Perhaps severe hypoxia ultimately
diminishes TIL effector functions. Indeed, respiratory supple-
mentation of oxygen or treatment with metformin decreased in-
tratumoral hypoxia and relieved several immunosuppressive
features in the tumor microenvironment; the latter also served
as an adjunct therapy that enhanced the antitumor effects of
PD-1 blockade (Hatfield et al., 2015; Scharping et al., 2017).
These findings suggest that remodeling the hypoxic tone in
tumors may be an essential component to developing more effi-
cacious forms of immunotherapy for patients.
Nutrient Alterations and Competition within the Tumor
Microenvironment
Apart from hypoxia, the competition for nutrients and metabo-
lites between tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells can
be fierce, consequently influencing signal transduction, gene
expression, and the metabolic activities of these neighboring
cells. For example, tumor cells manipulate surrounding adipo-
cytes to increase lipolysis to whet their appetite for fatty acids
(Nieman et al., 2011). Cancer-associated fibroblasts degrade
tryptophan that not only starves immune cells in the local envi-
ronment of an essential amino acid, but also leads to the produc-
tion of the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine (Hsu et al.,
2016). Moreover, glucose is a critical substrate for the antitumor
functions of effector T cells and M1 macrophages, which both
require engagement of aerobic glycolysis for their activation
and full effector functions (Buck et al., 2015; O’Neill and Pearce,
2016). Augmented aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells and endo-
thelial cells places immune cells and their neighbors at odds
(Figure 1). Glucose deprivation represses Ca2+ signaling, IFN-g
production, cytotoxicity, and motility in T cells and pro-inflam-
matory functions in macrophages (Cham et al., 2008; Chang
et al., 2013, 2015; Macintyre et al., 2014). Several recent studies
have demonstrated that the glycolytic activities of cancer cells
may restrict glucose utilization by TILs, thereby impairing anti-
tumor immunity (Chang et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2015; Zhao
et al., 2016). Increasing glycolysis rates of tumor cells through
overexpression of the glycolysis enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2)
suppressed glucose-uptake and IFN-g production in TILs and
created more immunoevasive tumors (Chang et al., 2015; Ho
et al., 2015). Zhao et al. (2016) found that glucose restriction
imposed by ovarian cancer leaves microRNA repression of the
methyltransferase EZH2 intact in CD8 T cells, reducing their sur-
vival and functional capacity. Thus, tumor cells can selfishly
coerce or outcompete neighboring cells for glucose to supply
their own metabolic demands in a manner that simultaneously
suppresses immune defenses.
Amino acid deprivation in the tumor microenvironment serves
as another metabolic checkpoint regulating antitumor immunity.

Cell 169, May 4, 2017
 Glutaminolysis in tumor cells is critical to replenish metabolites
through anaplerotic reactions, which could result in competition
for glutamine between tumor cells and TILs (Jin et al., 2016;
Pe
´ rez-Escuredo et al., 2016). Glutamine controls mTOR activa-
tion in T cells and macrophages and is also a key substrate for
protein O-GlcNAcylation and synthesis of S-2HG that regulate
effector T cell function and differentiation (Sinclair et al., 2013;
Swamy et al., 2016; Tyrakis et al., 2016). TAMs, MDSCs, and tol-
erizing dendritic cells (DCs) can suppress TILs through expres-
sion of essential amino acid (EAA)-degrading enzymes such as
Arg1 and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (Figure 1) (Lee
et al., 2002; Munn et al., 2002; Rodriguez et al., 2004; Uyttenhove
et al., 2003). Indeed, inhibitors of Arg1 and IDO are under inves-
tigation as therapeutic targets in clinical trials (Adams et al.,
2015). Several recent studies have highlighted the critical roles
of other amino acids such as arginine, serine, and glycine in
driving T cell expansion and antitumor activity, but how the avail-
ability of these fluctuate within the tumor microenvironment is
not clear (Geiger et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2017). Currently, a knowl-
edge gap exists on how the availability of various nutrients and
metabolites vary across tumor types, genotypes, or even
spatially within tumors to affect antitumor immune responses.
Bioactive lipids, modified lipoproteins, and cholesterol meta-
bolism within the tumor are also important mediators of immune
cell function. Like macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques, DCs
in the tumor can accumulate oxidized lipoproteins through scav-
enger receptor-mediated internalization and formation of lipid
droplets, which can ultimately impair their ability to cross-pre-
sent tumor antigens and activate T cells (Cubillos-Ruiz et al.,
2015; Ramakrishnan et al., 2014). Expression of lectin-type
oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) selectively marks MDSCs and
oxidized lipid uptake and lipoprotein metabolism contributes to
their T cell suppressive functions (Condamine et al., 2016). In
addition, blocking cholesterol esterification in TILs by targeting
ACAT1 pharmacologically or genetically increases intracellular
levels of cholesterol and confers superior T cell responses in a
model of melanoma (Yang et al., 2016). It is possible that as
immune cells adapt to different tumor microenvironments and
the limited availability of ‘‘immune stimulatory’’ nutrients, they
become more dependent on alternative fuel sources (such as
fats or lactate) that are less conducive to supporting antitumor
effector functions. In summary, more elaborate knowledge of
these forms of metabolic cross talk or competition between cells
within tumors is needed before one can begin to think about how
to manipulate these relationships in a manner that alters tumor
progression.
Metabolic Exhaustion in TILs and Checkpoint Blockade
As TILs adapt to the tumor microenvironment, they progressively
lose their ability to respond to T cell receptor (TCR) stimuli, pro-
duce effector cytokines, and proliferate—a process termed
functional exhaustion or hyporesponsiveness. This is in part
due to the upregulation of several inhibitory receptors like
PD-1, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA-4 that desensitize T cells to tumor
antigens (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015) (Figure 1). PD-1, its ligand
PD-L1, and CTLA-4 are important checkpoints for T cells in
tumors and the targets of a new and powerful class of cancer
treatments that elicit effective and durable responses in patients
across multiple cancer types (Ribas, 2015). Interestingly, both
chronic exposure to antigen or environmental triggers such as
glucose deprivation can upregulate PD-1 (Chang et al., 2013;
Wherry and Kurachi, 2015). PD-1 not only suppresses TCR,
PI3K, and mTOR signaling in T cells, but also dampens glycolysis
and promotes fatty acid oxidation (FAO)—features that may
enhance the accumulation of suppressive regulatory CD4 T
(Treg) cells in tumors (Bengsch et al., 2016; Parry et al., 2005;
Patsoukis et al., 2015). Indeed, blockade of PD-1 re-energizes
anabolic metabolism and glycolysis in exhausted T cells in an
mTORC1-dependent manner (Chang et al., 2015; Staron et al.,
2014). This breathes caution into the types of drug combinations
one may consider with a-PD-1:PD-L1 blockade or other forms of
immunotherapy. Metabolic interventions, such as the use of
mTOR inhibitors, must be targeted specifically to avoid unin-
tended compromises of immune cell function. The PD-1:PD-L1
axis may also directly affect the metabolic activity of tumor cells
(Figure 1). It was shown that PD-L1 expression correlated with
the rates of glycolysis and the expression of glycolytic enzymes
in those cells (Chang et al., 2015). Furthermore, checkpoint
blockade antibodies including a-PD-L1 led to an increase in
extracellular glucose in tumors in vivo that likely contributed to
the improved TIL function and subsequent tumor regression
observed. On this note, tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 expression
may counterintuitively increase intrinsic mTOR signaling and
tumor growth (Kleffel et al., 2015). Collectively, these findings
suggest there may be broader role of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis in
cellular metabolism that extends beyond T cells.
Balancing Metabolism and Designing Effective
Immunotherapies
Improving the proportion of patients that respond to immuno-
therapy is an intense area of study, ranging from the search for
biomarkers of response, target discovery, to testing new combi-
nation therapies. Likely, the most effective therapies will coordi-
nately target co-inhibitory receptor-to-ligand interactions and
restore a T cells’ ability to utilize metabolic substrates necessary
to sustain their effector functions. Although not discussed at
length here, other factors impinging on immune cell metabolism
that one should consider in designing anticancer immunother-
apies are the accessibility of growth factor cytokines that modu-
late nutrient transporter expression on immune cells and the fact
that immune cells migrate into tumors to exert their effector func-
tions, a metabolically demanding process. When cells move,
their intracellular architecture, controlled in part by the actin
cytoskeleton, is continuously remodeled. In an elegant dissec-
tion of PI3K-dependent growth factor signaling in epithelial cells,
Hu et al. (2016) found cytoskeletal dynamics and glycolysis to be
uniquely intertwined. The authors showed that addition of
growth factors or insulin activated Rac downstream of PI3K,
causing a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of this struc-
tural integrity released bound aldolase from filamentous F-actin,
increasing its catalytic activity. Chemical and genetic inhibition
of PI3K, Rac, or actin dynamics modulated glycolysis via mobi-
lization of aldolase (Figure 2). It will be interesting in future studies
to explore how other glycolytic enzymes or even the mitochon-
dria in immune cells restructure their metabolic activity through
changes in cytoskeletal morphology in response to growth factor
or pathogen-derived signals and whether this regulatory circuit
can be therapeutically targeted, especially because directed
Cell 169, May 4, 2017
573
 cellular migration is such an integral feature of how the dissem-
inated immune system can focus its attention on points of infec-
tion or damage.
Additionally, manipulating metabolic enzyme expression to
help T cells adapt to metabolic perturbations in the tumor micro-
environment may be another viable strategy to improve anti-
tumor immunity (Clever et al., 2016; Doedens et al., 2013;
Ho et al., 2015; Scharping et al., 2016), especially for adoptive
cell therapy, a personalized form of cancer treatment that
allows for the manipulation and expansion of a patient’s anti-
tumor T cells prior to re-infusion. Seemingly paradoxical is the
observation that dampening effector T cell differentiation by im-
pairing glycolysis and boosting mitochondrial FAO and oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), metabolic pathways that favor the
Figure 2. Recent Highlights in the Restructuring of Intracellular Architecture and Metabolism
Immune cell function is a product of their metabolic state. Growth factor signaling, actin rearrangement, and glucose metabolism are closely intertwined. Actin-
bound aldolase can be freed from the cytoskeleton downstream of growth factor signaling to mediate glycolysis. Engagement of this pathway is central to the
activation and downstream effector functions of DCs, M1 macrophages, and T cells. T cells can dynamically restructure their mitochondria through processes like
mitochondrial fission and fusion to signal changes in metabolism and to promote their long-term survival in the transition to memory cells.
574

 formation of resting memory T cell populations, potentiates
effector T cell survival and functional capacity against tumors
used in adoptive cell therapy (Buck et al., 2016; Sukumar et al.,
2013). On the one hand, the engagement of aerobic glycolysis
by activated T cells generates by-products of intermediary meta-
bolism that supply substrates used to build biomass and fuel
proliferation, provides an avenue for cells to support the equilib-
rium of reducing and oxidizing equivalents used to release en-
ergy, such as NAD+/NADH, and regulates the efficient produc-
tion of effector cytokines critical for tumor regression (Buck
et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2013). Activation
initiated by TCR ligation and binding with costimulatory mole-
cules also augments OXPHOS in T cells (Chang et al., 2013;
Sena et al., 2013). Mitochondria undergo biogenesis and take
on a grossly punctate and dispersed morphology with expanded
cristae junctions (Buck et al., 2016; Ron-Harel et al., 2016)
(Figure 2). During this process, the mitochondrial proteome re-
models itself to increase mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism.
Knockdown of SHMT2, the first enzyme in this pathway, impairs
CD4 T cell survival and proliferation in vivo (Ron-Harel et al.,
2016). The generation of mitochondrial-derived ROS is also crit-
ical for the activation and expansion of antigen-specific T cells
(Sena et al., 2013). As previously discussed, TILs that cannot
sustain mitochondrial function have compromised functionality
within the tumor microenvironment, and rescuing mitochon-
drial biogenesis in effector T cells improves antitumor immunity
(Bengsch et al., 2016; Scharping et al., 2016).
However, on the other hand, dampening regulators of glyco-
lytic metabolism, such as mTOR or c-Myc, and increasing mito-
chondrial FAO-dependent OXPHOS favors the formation of
long-lived memory T cells (Araki et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2015;
O’Sullivan et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2009; Pollizzi et al., 2016;
van der Windt et al., 2012; Verbist et al., 2016) (Figure 2). More
recent evidence postulates that while oxidative metabolism
and FAO characterizes the generation of long-lived stable central
memory T cells (Cui et al., 2015; O’Sullivan et al., 2014; Pearce
et al., 2009; van der Windt et al., 2012), augmenting glycolysis
genetically via VHL deletion favors the formation of effector
memory T cells instead, which have low levels of TCF-1, a tran-
scription factor that is expressed in stable populations of central
memory T cells capable of self-renewal (Phan et al., 2016; Zhou
et al., 2010). It was also recently shown that activated lympho-
cytes unequally eliminate aged mitochondria in sibling cells,
and this process can determine differentiation versus self-
renewal (Adams et al., 2016). Maintenance of mitochondria in
some cells was linked to anabolism, PI3K/mTOR activation,
glycolysis, and inhibited autophagy while mitochondrial clear-
ance in others was associated with catabolism, FoxO1 transcrip-
tion factor activity, and self-renewal. Thus, mitochondrial main-
tenance can drive differentiation over self-renewal, illustrating
how these organelles lie at the center of cell fate decisions.
In addition to mitochondrial stasis versus clearance, memory
T cells also have distinct mitochondrial morphology from effector
T cells. Effector T cells have more ‘‘fissed’’ mitochondria
whereas memory T cells have more ‘‘fused’’ mitochondrial net-
works with tight cristae suggesting a requirement for mitochon-
drial fusion in memory T cell metabolism and homeostasis.
Consistent with this observation, antigen-specific T cells lacking
the inner mitochondrial membrane fusion protein Opa1 fail to
generate memory T cells after bacterial infection and have
impaired survival in vitro (Buck et al., 2016). The activation,
proliferation, and function of Opa1-deficient effector T cells,
however, remain intact. Opa1�/� T cells have augmented
rates of glycolysis and possess mitochondria with diminished
OXPHOS efficiency and malformed cristae compared to con-
trols. It was shown that in quiescent T cells, such as naive and
memory T cells, mitochondrial fusion ensured tight cristae asso-
ciations that allowed for efficient electron transport chain (ETC)
function (Figure 2). Tight cristae result in dense packing of ETC
complexes, which have been found to associate in specialized
configurations termed respiratory supercomplexes or respira-
somes. Supercomplexes facilitate efficient transfer of electrons
and minimize proton leak during ATP production (Cogliati
et al., 2013). CD8 T cells express high levels of methylation-
controlled J protein (MCJ), a member of the DnaJ family of chap-
erones (Champagne et al., 2016). MCJ localizes to the inner
membrane of mitochondria and associates with complex I of
the ETC. By doing so, it negatively regulates the assembly of
complex I into supercomplexes. MCJ deficiency was found to
enhance naive and activated CD8 T cell OXPHOS and a unique
attribute was its role in the secretion, but not the translation, of
effector cytokines. Increased respiration efficiency improved
the survival of MCJ�/� effector T cells, which also induced supe-
rior protective immunity against viral challenge.
Repurposing the knowledge gained from such studies, boost-
ing oxidative capacity and efficiency through enforcement of
mitochondrial fusion or dampening glycolysis with 2-DG, ex-
tends the survival and antitumor function of CD8 T cells in
models of adoptive cell therapy (Buck et al., 2016; Sukumar
et al., 2013). Although aerobic glycolysis initiates and sustains
effector functions of activated T cells, augmenting metabolic
pathways that support long-lived memory T cells improves
T cell responses against tumors, demonstrating a need to strike
a balance between these processes, seemingly trading off
heightened activation and effector functions of TILs with their
sustained functionality and increased survival in the tumor
microenvironment. Indeed, modification of the signaling do-
mains within chimeric antigen receptor T cells, used in an alter-
native form of adoptive cell therapy, with 4-1BB augments mito-
chondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, enhancing their
persistence (Kawalekar et al., 2016). As our capability to selec-
tively reprogram T cell metabolism and reinvigorate tumor-spe-
cific T cells improves, there is much promise to provide greater
therapeutic benefits to more patients, especially to those with
previously incurable cancers.
The Gut Environment
While the tumor microenvironment is often depicted as nutrient
restrictive, the mammalian gastrointestinal tract represents a
metabolically rich and diverse tissue system. Its primary function
is to digest and absorb nutrients with the aid of microbial species
contained within the lumen. A single layer of epithelial cells is all
that separates these commensal microbes from the rest of the
body. The majority of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are absorp-
tive enterocytes that digest and transfer nutrients, however,
additional specialized epithelial lineages exist with a diverse
Cell 169, May 4, 2017
575
 array of functions. For example, goblet and Paneth cells secrete
mucins and antimicrobial peptides that fortify the barrier against
potentially pathogenic microbes, microfold (M) and goblet cells
assist in the transferring of luminal antigens across the epithelial
barrier for sampling by mucosal DCs, and Tuft cells are important
for sensing and responding to protozoa and helminths. Together
with intestinal resident immune cells including innate lymphoid
cells (ILCs), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), helper T cells
and B cells, a balancing act between barrier protection and
microbial tolerance with surveillance and inflammation is main-
tained (Figure 3). While the relationship between gut commensal
microbes and immune cell development and function, and also
how IECs interface with immune system regulation, has recently
been reviewed (Kurashima and Kiyono, 2017), we examine the
unique constraints that this environment presents on cellular
immunometabolism.
While IECs control the intake of nutrients from the luminal envi-
ronment of the gut, a recent study provides evidence that the
way they are structured and uniquely placed controls their meta-
bolic activity and function (Kaiko et al., 2016). The layer of
epithelia in the small intestine are organized into crypts and villi,
which form invaginations that serve to optimize surface area
whereby nutrients can be absorbed. At the base of the colonic
crypt lie epithelial stem/progenitor cells that differentiate into
specialized IECs as they migrate up the crypt-villus axis until
they are eventually lost from the epithelial layer. This process
of self-renewal from the crypt is continuous and therefore is a
site of active proliferation (Kurashima and Kiyono, 2017). Kaiko
et al. (2016) screened microbiota-derived products for their
impact on intestinal epithelial progenitors and identified the short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate as a potent inhibitor of intestinal
stem cell proliferation at physiologic concentrations present
within the lumen. They further found that differentiated colono-
cytes located at the forefront of the villi metabolized butyrate
to fuel OXPHOS, thereby limiting its access to underlying pro-
genitor cells, which do not readily utilize this substrate. Either
removal of the ability to metabolize butyrate via deletion of
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase or increased abundance of butyrate
prevented the rapid regeneration of epithelial tissue after gut
injury. Thus, a combination of physical separation in the crypt
and fermentation of butyrate by mature colonocytes protects
the proliferating progenitor pool of IECs (Figure 3).
B and T Follicular Helper Cell Metabolism
Another unique structural feature of the gut are the Peyer’s
patches, aggregates of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Reboldi
and Cyster, 2016). Found in the small intestine, they represent a
specialized lymphoid compartment continuously exposed to
food- and microbiome-derived antigens. Due to this exposure,
Peyer’s patches are rich in germinal centers (GCs), which are
comprised of B, T, stromal, and follicular DCs. B cells segregate
into zones where they undergo cycles of proliferation and differ-
entiation and compete for signals directing class switch recom-
bination (CSR) and survival from T follicular helper (Tfh) cells,
allowing further maturation of the antibody repertoire.
Although the literature on B and Tfh cell metabolism is still
developing, it has been shown that B cell activation induced by
either a-IgM ligation or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases
Glut1 expression and glucose uptake downstream of PI3K and
mTOR signaling (Caro-Maldonado et al., 2014; Doughty et al.,
2006; Jellusova and Rickert, 2016; Lee et al., 2013; Woodland
et al., 2008). Glycolysis and OXPHOS are augmented as well
as mitochondrial mass (Caro-Maldonado et al., 2014; Doughty
et al., 2006; Dufort et al., 2007). Increased glucose acquisition
also fuels de novo lipogenesis necessary for B cell proliferation
and growth of intracellular membranes. Inhibition of the fatty
acid synthesis (FAS) enzyme ATP-citrate lyase in splenic B cells
results in reduced expansion and expression of plasma cell dif-
ferentiation markers (Dufort et al., 2014). Although apoptosis
inducing factor (AIF) is required for T cell survival via ETC com-
plex I function and respiration, AIF deficiency in B cells has no
impact on their development or survival because of their reliance
on glucose metabolism (Milasta et al., 2016). B cells cultured in
galactose fail to expand unlike T cells, which can activate and
proliferate in the presence of either galactose or glucose (Chang
et al., 2013; Milasta et al., 2016). Glycogen synthase 3, which
promotes the quiescence and survival of circulating naive B
cells, tempers increases in glycolytic metabolism downstream
of CD40 costimulatory receptor signaling and sustains the sur-
vival of B cells subjected to glucose restriction (Jellusova et al.,
2017). On the other hand, the transition to durable humoral im-
munity by long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) was shown to be
dependent on mitochondrial pyruvate import and metabolism
(Figure 3). Glucose supports antibody glycosylation, but LLPCs
acquire more glucose than their short-lived counterparts and
their long-term survival is dependent on their ability to siphon
glucose-derived pyruvate into the mitochondria during times of
metabolic stress (Lam et al., 2016).
It is interesting to speculate that with the constant proliferation
of GC B cells in the gut and the importance of glucose and glycol-
ysis in activated plasma cells, access to glucose would become
limiting for other cells that occupy this microniche. A few studies
suggest that Tfh cells have evolved to be uniquely suited to sur-
vive under these constraints. It has been shown that Tfh cells
have less mTORC1 activation and reduced glycolysis compared
to Th1 cells (Ray et al., 2015). In part, this may be due to expres-
sion of their lineage defining transcription factor Bcl6, which can
suppress glycolysis potentiated by c-Myc and HIF-1a (Johnston
et al., 2009; Nurieva et al., 2009; Oestreich et al., 2014). Consis-
tent with this, overexpression of Bcl6 reduces glycolysis in
T cells, and inhibition of mTOR using shRNA favors Tfh cell devel-
opment over Th1 cells in vivo after viral infection (Ray et al., 2015)
(Figure 3). However, a more recent study using mice with condi-
tional deletions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 via OX40 and CD4 cre
recombinase observed a requirement of mTOR signaling in Tfh
cell development and GC formation within Peyer’s patches
(Zeng et al., 2016). The former applied retroviral mTOR shRNA,
which requires T cells be fully activated prior to knockdown, while
this more recent report used mice where mTOR was excised dur-
ing T cell development or at the moment of T cell activation, which
may explain the disparity between the studies.
In addition to possibly limiting quantities of glucose substrate
within GCs, these microniches contain areas of hypoxia, result-
ing in HIF-1a activation (Abbott et al., 2016; Cho et al., 2016).
B cells placed under hypoxic conditions had reduced activa-
tion-induced deaminase expression and subsequently under-
went less CSR to the pro-inflammatory IgG2c isotype when
576

 Figure 3. Model of Metabolic Relationships in the Gastrointestinal Tract
The gut serves as a direct interface with the outside world and the foods we consume. A single epithelial cell layer separates the contents of the intestinal lumen
from the lamina propria where DCs, macrophages, ILCs, and T cells reside. Peyer’s patches are interspersed along the epithelium, which in addition to supporting
sampling of luminal antigens by DCs and M cells, house germinal centers that maturate IgA-secreting B cells with Tfh cell help. B cells augment glycolysis upon
activation and depend on pyruvate import via Mpc2 for longevity as long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Plasma cell hunger for glucose may restrict this nutrient from
Tfh cells, however, Tfh cells downregulate glycolysis in response to expression of their lineage defining transcription factor Bcl6. In addition, GCs contain areas
of hypoxia that impinge on B cell function like class switch recombination (CSR). Commensal bacteria produce metabolites such as short chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) from the fermentation of dietary fiber, which influence B cell metabolism and promote IgA secretion. The presence of SCFAs and vitamins support
maintenance of barrier function by promoting the development and survival of Tregs and ILCs, respectively. Homeostatic signals secreted by gut resident
immune cells (e.g., IL-10) may also modulate metabolism and therefore control their activation state.

 cultured in conditions that promote IgG production (Cho et al.,
2016). In contrast, B cells cultured in IgA-promoting conditions
during hypoxia were unaffected, yielding comparable levels of
IgA to cells kept at normoxia and highlighting how lymphocyte
function may be fine-tuned to varying oxygen tension in tissues
(Figure 3). B cells isolated from mice with constitutive activation
of HIF-1a by deletion of its suppressor VHL had defects in IgG2c
production, which was attributed to diminished mTORC1 activa-
tion. B cells from Raptor-deficient heterozygotes also yielded
fewer IgG antibodies (Cho et al., 2016). A separate study found
that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin dampens CSR, yielding the
formation of lower affinity, more cross-reactive B cell antibodies,
which offered broad protection against heterosubtypic flu infec-
tion (Keating et al., 2013). Both mTORC1 and HIF-1a promote
aerobic glycolysis (O’Neill et al., 2016). However, the metabolic
activities of the cells cultured under different isotype conditions
while under hypoxia were not explored. A separate study exam-
ining mitochondrial function, and specifically mitochondrial
ROS, found that B cells with augmented mitochondrial mass,
respiration, and ROS stratified cells that underwent CSR marked
by IgG1 expression apart from CD138+ plasma cells (Jang et al.,
2015). The differences seen in mitochondrial function between
the B cell populations were in part due to differential regulation
of heme synthesis by mitochondrial ROS, however, how the
mitochondria affects CSR to other isotypes was not assessed.
Cytokines initiate CSR to distinct isotypes and signals derived
from these growth factors might be responsible for the differ-
ences in metabolic signaling and suggest varying requirements
to initiate metabolic programs and CSR in B cells. Secretion of
IgA predominates the gut and is critical to maintaining barrier
protection and bacterial homeostasis (Kurashima and Kiyono,
2017). The apparent stability of CSR to the IgA isotype under
hypoxia and impaired pro-inflammatory IgG2c subtype might
have evolved to ensure tolerance with the microbiome, while
concurrently providing a stringent method of selection of anti-
bodies produced during inflammatory responses to pathogen-
derived antigens.
Nutrients and Immune Signals in the Gut
The metabolic relationship between commensals and immune
cells in the gut is further illustrated by the finding that
SCFAs derived from the fermentation of dietary fiber by gut mi-
crobiota promote B cell metabolism and boost antibody re-
sponses in both mouse and human B cells (Kim et al., 2016).
Supplementation with dietary fiber or the SCFAs acetate, propi-
onate, and butyrate increases intestinal IgA production, as well
as systemic IgG during infection (Figure 3). Culturing B cells
with SCFAs was shown to raise acetyl-CoA levels and increase
mitochondrial mass, lipid content, and FAS leading to increased
plasma cell differentiation and metabolic activity (Kim et al.,
2016). Part of this phenotype could be attributed to histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, an established effect of SCFA
supplementation.
In addition to their effects on B cells, SCFAs can promote the
development and function of colonic Treg cells via induction of
Foxp3 in a HDAC-dependent manner (Arpaia et al., 2013; Furu-
sawa et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013) (Figure 3). Treg cells are
critical to maintaining commensal tolerance by the immune sys-
tem through suppression of aberrant T cell responses. Unlike
other activated T helper subsets, Treg cells have been described
to primarily rely on OXPHOS driven by FAO (Newton et al., 2016).
However, signals downstream of TLR ligation can augment
glycolysis and proliferation of Treg cells and reduce their ability
to suppress T cell responses (Gerriets et al., 2016). Retroviral en-
forced expression of Foxp3 promotes OXPHOS and dampens
glucose uptake and glycolysis, whereas Treg cells transduced
with Glut1 decreased Foxp3 expression after adoptive transfer
in vivo and fail to suppress T cell-mediated colitis in a model
of inflammatory bowel disease. These findings suggest that
during inflammation and microbial infection, Treg cells may
temporarily lose their regulatory function to give way to robust
T cell responses and participate as more conventional effector
helper T cells. Increases in NaCl either from supplementation
in vitro or diet in vivo inhibit the suppressive function of human
Treg cells via serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1),
which integrates signals from PI3K and mTORC2 to regulate
sodium-controlled signal transduction (Hernandez et al., 2015).
However, a study of human Treg cells found that the glycolytic
enzyme enolase-1 was required for their suppressive activity
through its control of Foxp3-E2 splice variants (De Rosa et al.,
2015). Depending on environmental cues and metabolites, it
appears that Treg cell metabolism can be modulated, affecting
their function.
As discussed, increases in SCFAs either from diet, infection, or
exogenous treatment impinge on metabolic processes including
HDAC activation (Rooks and Garrett, 2016). A recent study sug-
gests that activation of the HDAC sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) negatively im-
pacts Th9 cell differentiation (Wang et al., 2016b). The exposure
of CD4 T cells to distinct cytokine cocktails differentiates them
into separate helper lineages. However, perturbing metabolism
also modulates CD4 T cell fate. A yin and yang relationship be-
tween Th17 and Treg cell differentiation has been established.
Th17 cells are particularly glycolytic and depend on engagement
of this pathway downstream of mTOR and HIF-1a activation.
Dampening glycolysis through deletion of HIF-1a or with the in-
hibitor 2-DG in T cells impairs Th17 development and instead
promotes Treg cells, even under Th17-inducing culture condi-
tions (Dang et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2011). Suppression of mTOR
with rapamycin or genetic ablation also augments production
of Treg cells (Delgoffe et al., 2009; Kopf et al., 2007), and phar-
macological inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis prevents
Th17 differentiation and instead enforces a Treg cell phenotype
(Berod et al., 2014).
Although the metabolic characteristics of other CD4 T cell sub-
sets have been compared (Michalek et al., 2011), little was
known about Th9 cell metabolism. Th9 cells are characterized
by their ability to produce IL-9 and can be generated from naive
cells in culture using the cytokines transforming growth factor b
(TGF-b) and IL-4. They are implicated in autoimmunity, mela-
noma, and worm infections (Kaplan et al., 2015). Wang et al.
(2016b) found that Th9 cells are highly glycolytic, in part from
their active suppression of SIRT1 expression via the kinase
TAK1. SIRT1 was previously shown to negatively control HIF-
1a as well as mTOR (Lim et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014). In line
with this, Th9 cell development was augmented in SIRT1-defi-
cient T cells whereas retroviral enforced expression of SIRT1
or dampening of aerobic glycolysis by chemical or genetic
578
Cell 169, May 4, 2017
 means impaired Th9 cell differentiation (Wang et al., 2016b). Th9,
Th17, and Treg cells all share the cytokine TGF-b for their devel-
opment but then depend on additional cytokine signals for their
eventual fates. Given their divergent metabolic phenotypes, as
well as HDAC requirements, it would be interesting to explore
further whether variances in intracellular levels of SCFA metabo-
lites, for example, might couple with environment signals to influ-
ence their eventual metabolic and developmental pathway.
Apart from its effect on CD4 T cells, the SCFA acetate also
has been shown to affect secondary recall responses from
CD8 memory T cells (Balmer et al., 2016). Germ-free mice re-
constituted with commensal microbes, or oral or systemic
infection with bacterial species, elevated serum acetate con-
centrations. Memory T cells generated in vitro or in vivo
cultured with acetate levels observed during these infections
secreted more IFN-g and augmented glycolysis after restimula-
tion. Acetate can be quickly converted into acetyl-CoA, which
can condense with oxaloacetate into citrate in the mitochondria
to fuel the TCA cycle and OXPHOS, can be used as a substrate
for FAS, or participate in post translational modification (PTM)
of proteins including histones (Pearce et al., 2013). Balmer
et al. (2016) mechanistically tied their results to lysine acetyla-
tion of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate de-
hydrogenase (GAPDH). GAPDH activity has been shown to
regulate T cell production of IFN-g (Chang et al., 2013; Gubser
et al., 2013). Although the study demonstrated that the enzy-
matic activity of GAPDH was altered by acetylation of K217,
whether this PTM was critical to acetate-dependent increases
in IFN-g protein was not explored. In a separate report, CD4
T cells deficient in LDHA expression had defects in IFN-g pro-
duction, which stemmed from widespread lack of acetylation of
the Ifng locus (Peng et al., 2016). LDHA is the critical enzyme
that defines aerobic glycolysis, converting pyruvate to lactate.
Culturing cells in galactose impairs aerobic glycolysis, as
galactose enters glycolysis at a significantly lower rate than
glucose via the Leloir pathway (Bustamante and Pedersen,
1977), a result confirmed by tracing galactose metabolism in
T cells (Chang et al., 2013). Reducing GADPH engagement
from glycolysis in this fashion permits moonlighting function
by this abundantly expressed protein. It was shown that
GAPDH binds to the 30UTR of AU-rich containing cytokine
mRNAs, preventing their efficient translation (Chang et al.,
2013). Peng et al. (2016) argue against GAPDH posttranscrip-
tional control of T cell function during aerobic glycolysis defi-
ciency via LDHA deletion because modification of the 30UTR
of Ifng did not rescue defects in cytokine production in their
system. However, as Peng et al. (2016) demonstrated, LDHA-
deficient cells have defects in Ifng mRNA production, whereas
cells forced to respire in galactose remain transcriptionally
competent for Ifng as those cultured in glucose. Supplementa-
tion with the SCFA acetate rescued their epigenetic defect
and cytokine production. These studies show that aerobic
glycolysis regulates both transcriptional and translational func-
tions in T cells.
While products generated from the microbiome can modulate
the metabolism of immune cells and shift the balance between
tolerance and inflammation, there are hints that immune-driven
signals central to gut homeostasis may also mediate their effects
through metabolic modulation. One such example is the pleo-
tropic anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Most hematopoietic
cells produce and sense IL-10 and its importance for maintaining
tolerance with the intestinal microbiota is clearly evident from
observations that IL-10- or IL-10R-deficient mice develop spon-
taneous colitis (Ku
¨ hn et al., 1993; Spencer et al., 1998). IL-10R
deficiency in macrophages is also sufficient to recapitulate onset
of severe colitis in mice (Shouval et al., 2014; Zigmond et al.,
2014). Further, mice with a myeloid cell-specific deficiency in
STAT3, which is activated downstream of the IL-10R by JAK1,
develop chronic enterocolitis as they age (Takeda et al., 1999).
In experiments that shed light on the importance of aerobic
glycolysis engagement in DC activation, it was found that treat-
ment of DCs with recombinant IL-10 blocked increases in their
glycolytic rate after LPS stimulation (Krawczyk et al., 2010). Cells
subjected to IL-10R blockade further upregulated glycolysis af-
ter activation compared to controls. It is tempting to speculate
that one of the ways IL-10 might be anti-inflammatory is through
inhibition of metabolic reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis dur-
ing innate immune cell activation (Figure 3). Coincidentally,
STAT3 was found to localize to mitochondria and interact with
ETC complexes, which helped maintain efficient OXPHOS in
the heart (Wegrzyn et al., 2009). Whether traditional cell surface
cytokine-receptor signaling could modulate levels of mitochon-
drial STAT3 was not explored. Of interest, CD8 T cells with a con-
ditional deletion of the IL-10R fail to form memory T cells (Laidlaw
et al., 2015), which depend on FAO-driven OXPHOS for their
generation after infection (Cui et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2009;
van der Windt et al., 2012).
The gut is one example of a tissue that presents distinct meta-
bolic challenges for immune cells, which affect their steady state
and protective versus inflammatory responses. Other examples,
such as skin, provide the potential for commensal organisms to
metabolically affect immune cell function, a topic reviewed else-
where (Hand et al., 2016). The intestinal tract is constantly sub-
jected to fluctuations in diet and sometimes the intake of invasive
pathogens can also deprive metabolic substrates from immune
cells. The bacterium Salmonella typhimurium produces a puta-
tive type II asparaginase that depletes available asparagine
needed for metabolic reprogramming of activated T cells via
c-Myc and mTOR (Torres et al., 2016). The use of asparaginase
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment highlights the poten-
tial for the depletion of extracellular arginine to significantly affect
cellular function (DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016). Lack of die-
tary vitamin B1 decreases the number of naive B cells in Peyer’s
patches due to their dependence on this TCA cycle cofactor,
while leaving IgA+ plasma cells intact in the lamina propria (Kuni-
sawa et al., 2015). Although ILC metabolism has only recently
been explored (Monticelli et al., 2016; Wilhelm et al., 2016), it
was found that in settings of vitamin A deficiency, type 2 ILCs
sustain their function via increased acquisition and utilization of
fatty acids for FAO (Wilhelm et al., 2016) (Figure 3). The internal
balance between polyunsaturated fats and saturated fatty acids
can also determine the pathogenicity of Th17 cells; cells that help
maintain mucosal barrier immunity and contribute to pathogen
clearance (Wang et al., 2015). Long chain fatty acids (LCFA) pro-
mote Th1 and Th17 cell polarization and mice fed with LCFA have
exacerbated T cell-mediated autoimmune responses, whereas
Cell 169, May 4, 2017
579
 mice fed with SCFA are protected (Haghikia et al., 2015). If the
internal lipidome of Th17 cells can alter their functional state
from protective to inflammatory as does their access to LCFA
versus SCFA in the small intestine, it raises the question of how
other tissue systems with a rich diversity of fat deposits and cells,
such as the adipose tissue, modulate the metabolism and func-
tion of resident immune cells. Indeed, a recent study has found
that the survival and function of resident memory T cells depends
on exogenous lipid uptake and metabolism mediated by fatty
acid binding proteins 4 and 5 (Pan et al., 2017).
Organismal Metabolism and Immune Cell Function
Thus far, we have examined the effects of distinct niches in
which immune cells come to inhabit that mold their metabolic
and functional fates. The tumor microenvironment represents
one instance of a pathophysiological situation that immune cells
may encounter, whereas the gastrointestinal tract is an example
of a physiological tissue system that immune cells come to
occupy (Figure 4). During acute or chronic inflammation induced
by infection, diet, cancer, or injury, a feed forward loop may
exist where effector molecules, released from immune cells re-
sponding to these various localized insults to homeostasis,
also modulate systemic metabolism, and these changes to
organismal metabolism then feed back onto the metabolism
of immune cells, altering their subsequent function. Much
has been done in the last decades in the regard to associations
Figure 4. Tying Organismal Metabolism to
Cellular Metabolism and Immunity
Throughout the course of life, organisms are
exposed to a variety of factors that influence their
systemic metabolism, and the relationship be-
tween these and immune cell metabolism is only
beginning to be explored. As research moves for-
ward, it will be important to understand how
these challenges integrate with immune response
programs and whether our current paradigms and
models
regarding
immunometabolism
match
up or must be modified accordingly under these
circumstances.
between diet and inflammation with path-
ological metabolic syndromes such as
diabetes and insulin resistance or cardio-
vascular diseases (Font-Burgada et al.,
2016). However, the relationship between
changes in whole body metabolism and
immunometabolism remains largely an
uncharted area waiting to be explored
(Man et al., 2017).
Chronic low-grade inflammation is a
well-established major risk factor for a
plethora of diseases including heart dis-
ease, diabetes,
metabolic syndromes,
and
cancer
(Hotamisligil,
2017;
Park
et al., 2010), but our understanding of
how inflammation contributes to the path-
ogenesis of these complex diseases is
murky. Part of the complexity is due to
the local, regional, and systemic actions
of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a. These
are generally considered to be produced in response to local tis-
sue damage or infection, which can regulate not only the meta-
bolic activities of neighboring cells but also act on distal sensors
that control host metabolism (Febbraio, 2014). For example,
circulating IL-6 levels are elevated in patients with chronic inflam-
mation, which can modulate fatty acid metabolism and cell sur-
vival in many tissues including skeletal muscle, hepatocytes, the
CNS, and neuroendocrine system (Saltiel and Olefsky, 2017).
In obesity and consumption of a high fat diet (HFD), macro-
phages accumulate within adipose tissue recruited by dying
enlarged adipocytes and produce the inflammatory cytokines
IL-6 and TNF-a (Cinti et al., 2005; McLaughlin et al., 2017).
Locally, IL-6 can induce lipolysis in neighboring adipocytes
and impair lipoprotein lipase, decreasing adipocyte lipid storage.
The rise in circulating IL-6 and free fatty acids (FFAs) has broad
secondary effects on local and distal tissue microenvironments
and can promote local insulin resistance, which can be reversed
with therapeutic blockade of IL-6. IL-6 alone can also antagonize
insulin
receptor
signaling
and
induce
insulin
resistance
(McLaughlin et al., 2017). Interestingly, increased serum triglyc-
erides and LDL is one of the most frequent reported adverse
events in patients who receive tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor
blockade antibody, suggesting that IL-6 may play an important
role in lipid homeostasis during inflammatory conditions (Schultz
et al., 2010).
580
Cell 169, May 4, 2017
 Increased circulating FFAs have consequences on immune
cell function. Accumulation of FFAs in macrophages promotes
ROS generation, which in turn augments activation of the
NLRP3-ASC inflammasome (Guo et al., 2015). Inflammasome
activation increases tissue inflammation through IL-1b and IL-
18 secretion via cleavage activation by caspase-1 and pyropto-
sis (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016). FFA-induced inflamma-
some activation promotes insulin resistance, mediated by the
secretion of IL-1b. However, inflammasome activation may
exhibit functional specificity for certain FFAs, as not all saturated
fatty acids are capable of inflammasome activation. A HFD con-
sisting of mostly monounsaturated fatty acids, while still promot-
ing obesity in mice, does not induce inflammasome activation
and the development of insulin resistance (Finucane et al.,
2015). Tying into FFA metabolism, NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-
deficient mouse and human macrophages stimulated in vitro
with ATP, nigericin, or silica have impaired caspase-1 activation
and subsequent IL-1b and IL-18 maturation, although TNF-a
production remains intact (Moon et al., 2016). Moon et al.
(2016) found that inflammasome activation was also diminished
in NOX4�/� mice after Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge.
This defect was identified as an inability of NOX4-deficient cells
to augment Cpt1a-dependent FAO during inflammasome activa-
tion. Consistent with this observation, Cpt1a-deficient macro-
phages were unable to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, but
enforced expression of Cpt1a in NOX4-deficient macrophages
rescued inflammasome activation and cytokine release. How-
ever, exactly how NOX4 regulates Cpt1a protein levels and
FAO, and whether extracellular FFAs may contribute to this pro-
cess, was left unresolved.
Why do inflammatory cytokines exert systemic changes to
metabolism on other cells? Perhaps in the case of acute infec-
tions, inflammatory cytokines do so to create a temporary period
of local and/or systemic insulin resistance, which could allow for
redirection of glucose to immune cells, such as T cells, to fuel
their rapid division and meet their bioenergetic demands. How-
ever, when inflammation persists, like in cancer, obesity, or
chronic infection, prolonged disruption of metabolic homeosta-
sis could lead to immune cell dysfunction, dysregulated sys-
temic metabolism, and ultimately cachexia (Porporato, 2016).
Cachexia is a multi-organ syndrome of rapid weight loss and
loss of appetite, and is one of the most obvious morbidities in
cancer patients. The specific etiology of cachexia is debated,
and cancer-associated cachexia is not exclusive to tumor
burden or therapies suggesting that the state of cancer itself pro-
motes progression of metabolic dysfunction. TNF-a was origi-
nally considered the major driver of cachexia as implied by its
original name, ‘‘cachectin.’’ However, blockade of TNF-a is
insufficient to prevent cachexia, and more recent studies point
to the involvement of IL-6 in this process (Porporato, 2016).
Chronic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment is a source
of IL-6 production that leads to an increase in its systemic levels
in cancer patients. IL-6-mediated liberation of fatty acids from
systemic lipid stores, in concert with decreases in insulin avail-
ability or responsiveness, may instigate a catabolic state that be-
comes unhinged where lipolysis and also ketosis pillages energy
stores within subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle
culminating in a wasting disorder (Flint et al., 2016; Odegaard
et al., 2007). The extent to which immune cell metabolism is
affected by systemic substrate availability in vivo, and how
cachexia, as well as other situations (e.g., consumption of keto-
genic diets) influences nutrient depots and ultimately utilization
by immune cells, remains to be investigated.
Feeding behaviors can also affect host immune fitness
(Figure 4). The gut-brain axis controls appetite, sensory of
luminal contents, and digestion. The hypothalamus also regu-
lates so called ‘‘sickness behaviors,’’ such as sickness-associ-
ated anorexia and reduced energy expenditure, but it is still
not clear why sickness behaviors occur and more importantly
what benefit they might provide to the host response to infection
or inflammation. Wang et al. (2016a) asked whether the fed or
fasted state was more protective against infection with various
pathogens. Bypassing the anorexic response induced by infec-
tion with food or glucose supplementation increased lethality
during Listeria monocytogenes or LPS challenge. Glucose-medi-
ated death was due in part to enhanced neuronal dysfunction, as
the mice succumbed to epileptic seizures. Wang et al. (2016a)
suggested that increased ROS disrupted neural function, how-
ever, whether the enhanced morbidity was dependent on ROS
and its cellular source was not identified. Giving mice 2-DG to
impair glucose catabolism improved their survival. However,
glucose supplementation was protective when mice were chal-
lenged with influenza or Poly(I:C). Viral infection promoted endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses that were mitigated by
glucose consumption. On the other hand, temporary ketosis
was required for survival from LPS-induced sepsis, suggesting
that ketones are protective against hypothalamic inflammation
and ROS-mediated neuronal damage. Ketogenic diets have
been effective to reduce epileptic seizures, and the potential
benefits of ketogenic diets have been debated for other condi-
tions such as cancer (Allen et al., 2014). However, pre-fasting
or feeding the mice a ketogenic diet for 1–3 days prior to
LPS stimulation made them more susceptible to its lethal
effects, suggesting that in order to be protective, ketogenic
metabolism should be temporally coordinated to the course of
infection (Wang et al., 2016a). Interestingly, specific ketone
bodies have been shown to minimize inflammation in other in-
stances by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bone
marrow-derived macrophages and human monocytes (Youm
et al., 2015).
Some pathogens have evolved strategies to take advantage of
modulating feeding behaviors to promote their own fitness. A
recent report by Rao et al. (2017) suggests that Salmonella typhi-
murium inhibits infection-induced anorexia upon oral infection by
antagonizing caspase-1 activity downstream of inflammasome
activation to decrease IL-1b signaling to the hypothalamus via
the vagus nerve. Disrupting this adaptation in Salmonella by ge-
netic deletion of its ubiquitin ligase SlrP resulted in modulation
of the gut-brain axis. Infection with SlrP-deficient Salmonella
augmented IL-1b maturation, resulting in changes to hypothalam-
ic appetite regulation, whereby the mice decreased food con-
sumption and exhibited greater weight loss that ultimately dimin-
ished host survival. Severing the gut-CNS connection surgically
or force-feeding the mice reversed this anorexic response and
increased lethality induced by SlrP-deficient Salmonella infection.

 give some mechanistic insight into the exciting interconnection
between feeding behaviors and disease susceptibility versus
tolerance but also show that there is still much to learn about pre-
cisely how different pathogens and routes of infection affect this
process. We have highlighted only a few examples where, going
through the arc of life, many other organismal factors and
changes may occur that influence immune cell metabolism, which
directly impacts immune cell function and fate (Figure 4). Investi-
gating how these perturbations affect our overall health will not
only be challenging, but also interesting for further research.
Outlook
For some time, immunology encompassed a field that sought
reductionist approaches to simplify a complex network of cells.
Out of necessity, immunologists had to speak a common lan-
guage or jargon that often excluded scientists in other disci-
plines. After many decades of hard work, great strides have
been made in our understanding of the immune system, and
now immunologists are better equipped to cross over into other
disciplines. It is this ‘‘take a step back and look’’ approach that
has led a number of laboratories to focus on metabolism and
how this affects the immune system as well as its greater impact
in tissue physiology.
It is obvious to most biologists that metabolism is integrated
into every cellular process and fate decision. After all, every-
thing must eat to survive. However, what is perhaps less appre-
ciated is that the immune system is like a liquid organ unto itself.
At their inception, immune cells are poised to respond to un-
known stimuli, nutrients, and pathogens and are akin to special
agents with contingency plans, ready to respond to one
disaster scenario after another or relegated to pushing paper-
work at the office maintaining the status quo. Throughout this
review, we have only highlighted some examples of the
complexity of the situations and environments that immune
cells face that provide various metabolic instructional cues.
This ability to rapidly change and adapt at any given second
means that immune cells must intimately integrate their cellular
metabolism in a way that most other organ and cell systems in
the body do not have to, which we hope this review has shown
and inspires research into many questions that remain to be
explored. Coupling the unique benefits of studying immunome-
tabolism is the added bonus of the enormous clinical relevance
of these cells in human health and disease. First defining and
then exploiting their unique metabolism may continue to yield
new targets for therapy.
