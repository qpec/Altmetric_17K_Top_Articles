 Summary 
Dementia impact has received increasing attention of governments and politicians across the 
globe in recent years. Epidemiological research based Western European populations twenty 
years ago provided key evidence for dementia policy making, but these estimates are now out 
of date given dramatic changes in life expectancy, living conditions and health profiles across 
different generations. To test whether dementia occurrence has changed over the last decades, 
five studies in Western Europe have now compared the dementia occurrence across time 
using consistent research methods. These five studies report stable or reduced dementia 
occurrence of up to 25% over the last decades and suggest stabilising numbers of people with 
dementia in Western Europe despite population ageing. This may be the result of better 
education, living conditions, prevention and treatments of vascular risk and chronic 
conditions and indicate a potential “lifecourse approach” that promoting health in earlier life 
stages may benefit cognitive and brain health in later life across successive generations. 
Policy planning and future search must be balanced across primary, secondary and tertiary 
prevention. Each has their place but primary prevention has the largest modelled potential 
impact on dementia and disability in societal terms. 
 
 
 
 Background 
Dementia has only relatively recently received focused attention in global societies as 
compared with other major public health priorities.1,2 Societies around the world face an 
increasing proportion of older people who by reason of age alone are at increasing risk of 
dementia, a declining proportion of people in the workforce as well as unfavourable economic 
circumstances.3 Governments and politicians have become aware of the impact of dementia 
on individuals, families and societies and are worried about the likely increase in numbers of 
people with dementia.2 Policy makers have started to request evidence and already are 
promoting relevant policies around the globe using the available evidence for justification. 
Although these policies are usually assumed to be based on robust scientific evidence, 
epidemiological studies that measure who has, who will get and who escapes dementia in 
populations and whether this changes over time are surprisingly rare.4 The estimations can be 
based on health service contact or death certification as used in many other conditions to 
assess population impact but this is not helpful for dementia.5 Where studies based on 
populations do exist they are often single sites within countries, rarely whole geographical 
regions.6 Studies conducted in different sites to test for differences within countries are also 
rare. Estimation of occurrence from true population-based epidemiological studies is critical 
for exercises such as costing, and therefore robust, relevant, up to date estimates should be 
required when creating dementia policies. These also need to be sensitive to many relevant 
 individual and contextual factors, such as gender, culture and socioeconomics creating 
potential variation across time and geography. 
 
Despite the trauma of two world wars, compared to the rest of the world, high income 
countries in Europe have had relatively stable social environments, wealthy living conditions 
and advanced health science, with the consequence of extended life expectancy, population 
ageing and increasing concerns about dementia. The first epidemiological investigations of 
dementia in Western Europe were initiated thirty or so years ago and took at least a decade to 
have discernible policy impact.7 These primary fieldwork studies are still influencing policy 
development today and continue to provide a statement of the size and distribution of 
dementia within countries and across Europe, going on to be used at national and local levels 
e.g. England’s NHS primary care targets.8,9  
 
Although robust information on dementia has been provided through this investment in earlier 
decades, it is important for policy makers to remember societal changes and their potential 
impact on population health. Each generation of older people will have experienced different 
positive and adverse influences on health across their lives.10 Established risk and protective 
factors for dementia such as education and vascular diseases have been subject to huge 
changes over successive generations. 11-13 Given these changes in life expectancy and risk 
 profiles in the whole populations, we would expect to see emerging variation in the 
occurrence of dementia across populations over time and geography. Policy making needs to 
incorporate up to date information based on evidence from up to date epidemiological studies 
in Western Europe, which will reflect any such changes in dementia occurrence in 
representative populations. In additional to the estimation of changing epidemiology of 
dementia and implications for health policy, these findings may also inform the debate on the 
direction of research funding and science on the changing nature and definition of dementia 
syndrome across time and in different contexts. Evidence from Western European populations 
can be a demonstrator of changes in dementia occurrence over time. Policy makers from 
outside of Western European countries may use this information as a reference for their 
dementia policy planning. 
 
Here we conduct an in depth presentation of the only European studies that can currently test 
for changes in dementia occurrence (Box 1). Epidemiological terms can be confusing and the 
key concepts and measures are provided in Box 2 to assist non-epidemiological readers.  
 
 
 
 
Box 1 The aims of this review 
 
- 
To synthesise the epidemiological evidence from population-based studies which compared dementia 
occurrence over time in Europe using the same methodologies.  
- 
To suggest implications for dementia policy based on the evidence from current epidemiological 
research 
- 
To provide suggestions for policy makers on assessing the scientific evidence on dementia 
  
Box 2 Epidemiological terms and measures 
 
A cohort indicates a group of people in a specific time and space.14 In epidemiological studies, this defined 
group is measured often for risk and protective factors at baseline and then is followed by researchers and their 
health data regularly collected over time. A population-based cohort is a representative sample or the entire of 
the target population (For example, the UK older population including those living in care settings). It is possible 
to measure prevalence at baseline and track incidence and mortality in the follow-up investigation. 
 
The relationship of three basic measures: prevalence, incidence and mortality, is illustrated as below. Prevalence 
is as a result of incidence and mortality (i.e. new cases occurring and death). Dementia is not reversible and 
therefore recovery does not feature in this explanation. If we assume that the occurrence of new cases (incidence) 
is a water stream into a container and a water stream leaking out is those who die (mortality), the water level 
would be the prevalence. The flow rate of water streams will affect the water level observed at different time 
points. Current research and evidence is based on the findings from prevalence studies (observed water level) 
since it is relatively difficult to measure incidence (the flow rate) of non-communicable diseases except through 
cohort studies, which may be or may not be population-based (representative sample). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes in diagnostic criteria: if diagnostic criteria for dementia are made more restrictive, the water will flow at 
a slower rate and prevalence will decrease, not because dementia is less common but because its formal criteria 
have changed. If they are made more inclusive the converse will occur with increasing prevalence.  
 
 
Incidence: proportion of new dementia cases in a defined population 
over a time period 
Prevalence: proportion of people with dementia in 
a defined population 
Mortality: proportion of people who died in a defined population over a 
time period (which will differ between people with and without dementia) 
 Data sources and analysis 
A literature search was conducted to identify all European population-based prevalence and 
incidence studies using the search terms “dementia” or “Alzheimer’s disease” and “time” or 
“trends” in PubMed and Web of Knowledge up to February 2015. Two inclusion criteria were 
used to select papers: (1) reporting on true population studies with contemporary findings 
published after 2000 in European populations; (2) the potential for comparison with earlier 
prevalence or incidence data. Information was extracted from each study on study design, 
methodological features and details of results. For the identified recent studies, earlier papers 
reporting first cohort results were used to supply more detailed information.15-22 Six studies 
were identified with two time periods, including two based on specific age groups.23,24 One of 
these was identified as relevant and included.24 The other one was excluded as the study 
populations of the two time periods were not sampled independently and only had a five-year 
gap for comparison.23 
 
Five European studies reported a valid comparison of prevalence and/or incidence between 
two comparable cohorts.24-28 These were carried out in Western Europe1: Sweden (Stockholm 
study- the Kungsholmen Project and the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in 
Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) and Gothenburg study), Netherlands (the Rotterdam study), UK 
(the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS)) and Spain (the Zaragoza study, 
 ZARADEMP Project). In Eastern and Central Europe, this kind of comparison was not 
possible.4 The age of study populations was 70 years and over in the Swedish studies and 55 
or 65 and over in the other studies. The first cohorts were examined between late 1970s and 
early 1990s and the second cohorts between mid-1990s and late 2000s. The time separation 
for the comparisons ranged from 7 years (the Zaragoza study) to 30 years (the Gothenburg 
study). The first cohort studies found similar prevalence estimates by five-year age groups 
across different countries with consistent demonstration of the prevalence doubling every five 
years.6 
 
A detailed analysis of study design and population sampling is required to know how to 
interpret results, particularly if they are to be applied nationally and compared internationally. 
Figure 1 presents a schematic representation of the designs and population sampling of these 
studies, Table 1 summarises the methodological features of these studies. Only three were 
direct comparisons of cohorts with new sampling of the population, independently of the 
previous cohort.24,27,28 The Rotterdam cohort did not have new independent sampling but 
added incomers and the “newly” old periodically.25 The study based in Stockholm was 
originally a dedicated local study, the most recent study was based on a local subsample from 
a national study.25 Response rates declined in three of the studies with varying ability to 
assess the impact of such changes on the findings.24,27,28 The Stockholm and Rotterdam 
 studies had stable response rates.25,26 Although analytical methods were different across 
studies, each study attempted to keep the diagnostic methodology as stable as possible, 
recognising that changes over time in approaches to diagnosis are likely to affect prevalence 
and incidence but only one used a fixed algorithm method.28 Further details of comparison of 
study design and methodology are provided in the Appendix.  
 
 
Results and interpretation: change over time? 
Prevalence: The two studies of 65+ populations (CFAS and Zaragoza) with independent 
sampling over time reported lower prevalence, in Zaragoza the reduction in men reached 
significance although the reduction in overall prevalence did not. Stable prevalence of 
dementia over time was reported in both the Swedish studies. Age- and gender-specific 
estimates of prevalence for the three comparison studies are shown in Figure 2 and 3. Figure 2 
shows the prevalence by five-year age groups and Figure 3 focuses on the estimates over time. 
The findings suggest consistently greater changes in men than women particularly in those 
studies from mainland Europe. The UK-based study found decline in prevalence in both 
sexes.  
 
 Incidence: The Rotterdam study is the only study reporting incidence data. A reduction in 
incidence over 10 years, although not significant, was detected. The Stockholm study inferred 
changes in incidence over 20 years by integrating prevalence and mortality and also suggests 
a reduction.  
 
Mortality with dementia: Two studies examined mortality and both report declining trends 
for the whole population.24,25 Only the Stockholm study compared changes in mortality of 
people with dementia and found a decreasing trend across two cohorts. 
 
More detailed information is provided in supporting information (Table S1 and S2).  
 
Thus, despite methodological and operational differences between the studies (see Appendix), 
there is no evidence in any of these studies of any increase in prevalence when diagnostic 
method are stabilised. On the contrary, prevalence decreases by up to 20~25% over the last 
20~30 years with much of this change influenced by changes in older men. A reduced 
incidence is also suggested by two studies, one using indirect methods.   
 
The strength of the selected studies is that they are population-based and attempt to retain 
similar study methods over time. Using stable methods suggests actual reduction in 
 prevalence and incidence across time and generations. This is by far the most compelling 
evidence from a major global region to provide an indication of population changes affecting 
prevalence, potentially incidence and mortality of dementia.  
 
A potential limitation of these Western European studies was lower response rates in more 
recent cohorts with the UK and Spain suffering particularly from drop in response.27,28 The 
CFAS analysis provided extensive sensitivity analyses to address potential impact of 
dropouts.28 The response rates in Dutch and Scandinavian studies have been steady although 
differential response within the refusal groups is still possible.24-26 Another additional factor 
which could have influenced the estimated prevalence and incidence is the likelihood of 
dementia being mentioned in medical records if these are used to supplement partial 
information. Medical records data were used in some studies (not the Stockholm and CFAS 
study) which could be expected to increase estimates as this method will be subject to change 
diagnostic boundaries and greater likelihood of contact with services across time. These data 
are not provided so that its impact cannot be assessed. Although each study remained 
consistent methodologies over time, study designs and research methods were different across 
the five studies and therefore meta-analysis is not possible. 
 
What might be influencing these findings? Lifecourse perspectives 
 What might the reasons for reduction be, when differences in methodology and diagnostic 
processes have been controlled for? The first of these could be a survivor effect of some kind 
due to variation in life expectancy. Those individuals in these five prevalence or incidence 
studies were born in the first half of the 20th century and will have experienced major 
historical events, which could influence survival at different life stages (Figure 4). Life 
expectancy at birth in the four countries is related to the influence of wars (World War I and 
II), famine (Dutch famine 1944, Spanish Civil War 1930s) and infectious diseases (the 1918 
Influenza). Although life expectancy at birth continues to show considerable variation in 
social environment across countries, previous research shows that the combined prevalence 
estimates in Western Europe are reasonably consistent across countries.7 Trends in prevalence 
and incidence of dementia are likely to be moderated by a complicated combination of 
societal changes on influencing survival, lifestyle factors and health profiles across life stages 
(Box 3).  
 
From a lifecourse perspective, these historical events seem likely to have had a profound 
influence on living conditions, growth and development, physical and mental health in earlier 
life and cognition in older age across different generations.9 In the two Swedish studies, first 
cohorts born before 1915 could have experienced worse education, living conditions and 
threat of influenza in their early age compared to the second cohorts. In Spain, although there 
 was only 7 year difference between the two cohorts, however the civil war and continual 
famines in late 1930s could have had considerable impacts on the nutrition and primary or 
secondary education of the younger cohorts.32 The two Dutch cohorts which experienced the 
1944 famine at different life stages and survived through war periods have indeed been 
reported to have different later life health profiles.33 Compared to the other cohorts, the 
second cohort in the CFAS can be considered as a “post-war generation”, with better survival, 
education, cognitive and physical development in early age and health status throughout their 
life.  
 
Adverse environments in earlier eras will have influenced survival and may be different 
according to gender and deprivation. A greater reduction in dementia prevalence was found in 
men than women. Since the 19th century, women in Western Europe started to have longer life 
expectancy than men but this gender difference decreased in recent decades.34 Although the 
improvement of living conditions, education and healthcare may have a positive influence on 
reducing dementia occurrence in younger generations, societal changes might have more 
complicated influences on women’s behaviour and life experience. Changes in behaviour and 
lifestyle, such as smoking, drinking and employment outside home, have been suggested to 
have a substantial impact on premature mortality and the occurrence of non-communicable 
diseases in women.35,36 Some of these factors are known to increase the risk of dementia and 
 might moderate the time trends in dementia prevalence. People with better education, 
socioeconomic status and health conditions are usually more resilient and have a higher 
probability of survival to older ages.37,38 The impact of changed behaviours such as smoking 
and risk factors for vascular diseases was very much focused on men in the last century. 
 
In additional to demographic and lifestyle factors, observational studies have consistently 
highlighted the strong relationship between vascular risk factors and cognitive 
decline/dementia. Incidence and mortality of major cardiovascular diseases have decreased in 
high-income countries since the 1980s.39 Prevention and treatments of vascular diseases and 
chronic conditions may play an important role in reduced or stable occurrence of dementia 
over the last decades. Compression of morbidity with shorter periods of physical and 
cognitive infirmity may be occurring and our data concur with this.40 
 
How to assess and interpret epidemiological evidence? 
Although epidemiologists have been working for decades to carry out population-based 
cohorts to enumerate the size of dementia in the population, it is important to remember that 
such research is, as all research is, locked in time and space. Policy makers need to be careful 
about the evidence provided to them on dementia- what is its provenance and its relevance.  
 
 The interpretation of scientific findings could be various depending on different perspectives 
and contexts. An illustration of the difficulty inherent in interpretation of new findings in 
relation to old, or comparisons across geography is putting two systematic reviews of Chinese 
prevalence studies of dementia side by side.41,42 In one, much promoted, the conclusion is that 
dementia prevalence is increasing in China.41 In the other, which takes methodological 
variation into account, the increase in prevalence is attenuated and non-significant because the 
methodological factors, including introduction of new diagnostic criteria, appear to have been 
instrumental in the increase.42 Such results provide a cautionary note about the interpretation 
of potential changes in dementia occurrence. Any studies which are based on current 
diagnostic practices and contact with health services are likely to reflect increased attention 
and awareness of people with dementia as well as potential increase in prevalence due to 
shifting diagnostic boundaries. This will counter the impact of reduction in actual occurrence 
through increased detection of milder “cases”, previously not recognised as meeting dementia 
criteria. Inconsistent methodologies as well as enormous political interests, stakeholder and 
public awareness could influence the interpretation of scientific evidence on dementia. 
Catastrophic estimates of dementia in future ageing society serve current political and charity 
campaigns, encourage investment into pharmaceutical and healthcare business and are 
maintained by sustained attention of social and general media. Scientific evidence needs to 
match this excitement in order to continue to secure research funding and resources. 
 Evidence-based policy is not only to consult the evidence but also needs to further assess the 
provenance of evidence taking the quality of research and potential influences of social 
contexts into account. 
 
In addition to the source of evidence, policy makers also have to assess the evidence and its 
relevance to diverse settings. Is the estimate from Western Europe generalisable across 
geographies and time? Up to the last decade, there was very little evidence of systematic 
variation in prevalence or incidence of dementia between high income countries where life 
expectancy is high. This is in contrast to considerable variation reported from low- and 
middle-income countries, where life expectancy is still below the median age of dementia 
incidence in high income countries (around aged 83 years).43 For example, higher estimated 
prevalence has been reported in Latin America, which also have high vascular risk profiles. 
Difference in economic development, population structure, societal and cultural contexts 
across the globe could limit the application of scientific evidence, which is mainly from high 
income countries with a Western perspective. Policy making needs to assess the relevance of 
evidence to correspond to different contexts, time and geography. 
 
Implication for policy: every life stage matters 
 This review provides a very positive and encouraging message in terms of possibilities of 
prevention and future perspectives within the dementia field. A possible decline in dementia 
occurrence underlines the potential long term benefits of national policies related to education, 
social determinants of health influencing inequalities, and health behaviours for future 
generations. Cognitive and brain health in later life are rooted in physical and mental health 
from earlier life stages so that every life stage matters. Policies aimed at whole populations, 
such as effective prevention policies, health promotion and health care provisions across the 
lifecourse are likely to be important over many decades and even into the next century.44 The 
evidence from European studies reinforces the potential of preventive strategies across the 
lifecourse to reduce dementia risk rather than over-emphasises on pharmaceutical 
interventions and biomedical mechanisms in later life. Global societies need to bear this 
“lifecourse approach” in mind when drafting their current plans for investment.  
 
The European studies synthesised here present a rather different picture from the “dementia 
epidemic” reported in existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses3,41 and suggest that the 
number of people with dementia in European countries are stabilising despite population 
ageing. However, dementia care will remain a lasting challenge for many years in the future 
across the world. In particular, the oldest old (e.g., 85+) is the fastest increasing segment in 
the population, with up to 40% of affected and many more with cognitive decline and 
 frailty.45,46 The case for balanced investment in research across primary (prevention), 
secondary (early detection/screening) and tertiary support (care once present) has never been 
stronger. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) response to 
addressing dementia mentioned that health systems across the member countries spend less 
than 3% on dementia prevention.47 However, the strategies of dementia research still 
emphasise on biomarkers, biochemical mechanisms, treatments and cure.47 In the UK, the 
research impact report from Alzheimer’s Society shows 5% of research funding between 1990 
and 2012 were invested to risk factors and preventive strategies, 11% in dementia diagnosis, 
20% in care and support while nearly 65% in aetiology, cure and treatment development.48  
 
Scientific evidence needs to be assessed for the strength and weakness that it will undoubtedly 
have with contextualisation the level of population in order to provide greatest value for the 
investments made. The existing strength of these Western European studies, including stable 
study methods, appropriate and representative population sampling, good enough response 
rate and repeated, fresh sampling on a regular basis, needs to be sustained and developed 
further. The advance of epidemiological research may inform not only policy and practice but 
also our understanding of health in older age in general across generations, geographies and 
futures. 
 
 Box 3 Dementia, epidemiological evidence and policy implications 
(1) Definition of dementia: a syndrome of decline in cognitive function, such as memory, language and 
executive function.  
 
(2) Risk factors: despite changes in diagnostic criteria, some consistent risk factors have emerged for dementia 
over the last decades29-31 
 
- 
Demographic factors: older age, being female, low education, low social class 
- 
Co-morbidity of chronic conditions: diabetes, vascular diseases, stroke, hypertension, depression 
- 
Lifestyle factors: smoking, low level of physical activity 
 
(3) Results:  
- 
European population-based studies on dementia occurrence indicate a decline in age specific of up to 25%, 
most marked in men.  
- 
The numbers of people with dementia in some European countries are stabilising despite population ageing.  
- 
Health in early and middle life stage may be influencing this emerging pattern. 
 
(4) Strengths and limitations of the study:  
- 
Epidemiological studies remained the same study methods to compare changes in dementia occurrences 
over the last few decades. 
- 
Meta-analysis is not possible. Response rates vary across countries and are generally lower in more recent 
cohorts with the UK and Spain suffering particularly from drop in response. 
 
(5) Policy implications: 
- 
All policies aiming to tackle dementia need to take lifecourse impact of early life health influence into 
account. Policy planning must be balanced across primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.  
- 
Primary prevention, promoting healthy lifestyle factors and prevention in chronic conditions, has the largest 
modelled potential impact on dementia and disability in societal terms 
- 
Policy makers need to assess carefully the evidence provided to them on dementia taking into account 
changes in diagnostic procedure, context, time, geography, provenance and relevance for current and future 
populations.  
- 
Population-based epidemiological research, using consistent methodologies across geography, time and 
culture, provides robust evidence for policy making, dementia care planning and a comprehensive 
understanding of health in older age.

Terminology 
Varying terms used in different studies to describe the designs and different stages. A consistent terminology for 
this paper was developed to reduce confusion and shown below and in the illustrations.  
(1) Phase: the investigation of prevalence or incidence generally included two phases, a screening phase and a 
diagnosis phase. Some recent studies used one-phase only combining screening and diagnosis.  
(2) Wave: follow-up investigations for incidence or mortality; the studies which focused on the prevalence of 
dementia had only one wave, with one or two phases as described above.  
(3) Cohort: the time period of the study for comparison; either two cohorts can be recruited at different times 
(two fixed cohorts) or dynamic cohorts where one base cohort has additional people newly recruited.  
 
Study design and population sampling 
Figure S1 presents the designs and population sampling of the five selected studies.24-28 Study populations were 
generally sampled from administrative data, census list or GP registration in the defined areas and stratified by 
age, varying in their representation of the general population of the relevant age in local areas but kept stable 
over the two time periods in all cases. All included people living in communities and institutions. Three of the 
studies were direct comparisons of new cohorts.1-3 The other two were not such direct comparisons: the 
Stockholm study compared a local cohort at first time period with those drawn for a national study from the 
relevant geographical and age specific population;4 the Rotterdam study is a dynamic cohort with the comparison 
population formed through recruitment of in-migrants into the geographical area of the relevant age as well as 
existing residents who had reached 65 and over in the intervening period.5 The response rate of the first cohort 
was generally over 70%. In the second cohort, three of the studies had lower response rates ranging from 56% 
(CFAS II), 63% (Gothenburg) and 64% (Zaragoza).1-3 Two achieved similar response at both time points (73% 
Stockholm, 90% Rotterdam).4-5

Study methods including diagnostic proceeding and criteria 
A comparison of methodological features is reported in Table S1. In the analysis of the recent cohorts, most 
studies attempted to address the problem of drop out from screening to diagnostic phase either through study 
design or analytical approach. The Stockholm study and CFAS combined two-phase processes into a one-phase 
interview. The Zaragoza study conducted clinical examination in all suspected cases the day after screening. 
Apart from the first cohort in Gothenburg study and second cohort in Zaragoza study (ZARADEMP-I), the 
criteria for dementia diagnosis was DSM-III-R or equivalent (GMS-AGECAT algorithm). The first cohort 
(1976-1977) of the Gothenburg study used the historical criteria, which was confirmed to have high agreement 
with DSM-III-R in the second cohort. For the purpose of comparison, the diagnosis of the first cohort in 
Zaragoza study (ZARADEMP-0) was mapped to DSM-IV.

Analytical strategy 
Four studies provided a comparison of prevalence.1-3 The Gothenburg study compared the prevalence at specific 
ages: 70 and 75 in three cohorts over 30 years.1 The Zaragoza study and CFAS calculated prevalence separately 
for each cohort as the sampling was completely independent. Since a one phase and two phase study have 
different analytical implication, CFAS I and II analyses were structured to identify whether change in design 
across time required specific adjustment. The Stockholm study and Gothenburg study pooled the data from the 
two cohorts for comparison and examined for cohort differences in one model. Prevalence was adjusted for age 
and gender in the three studies with a range of ages.2-4 The Stockholm study additionally adjusted for education 
in the model and CFAS conducted extensive analysis on non-response and area deprivation with multiple 
sensitivity analyses. The incidence of dementia over time was compared in the Rotterdam study.5 The Stockholm 
study estimated incidence over two decades using prevalence and mortality.4 
 
Comparison of prevalence, incidence and mortality across cohorts 
Table S2 reports prevalence estimates in the four European studies by men and women. The conclusion (C.) in 
the table was based on the interpretation in original papers. The study may suggest stable (S) or decreased (D) 
prevalence although the difference did not achieve statistical significance. The decrease achieving statistical 
significance is underlined (D). Similar information was extracted from the Rotterdam Study and Stockholm 
Study for comparison of incidence (Table S3) and mortality (Table S4). 
 
Limitations of the studies 
This analysis has shown considerable variation in methodology across the studies, with some achieving 
comparison through inference of prevalence and others carrying out direct comparisons. Meta-analysis is not 
therefore possible. Populations vary in their responses more recently with the UK and Spain suffering 
particularly from drop in response – the UK from a higher original point. The CFAS analysis provided extensive 
sensitivity analyses to address potential impact of dropouts. The response rates in Scandinavian studies have 
been steady although differential response within the refusal groups is still possible. Another additional factor 
which could have influenced the estimated prevalence and incidence is the likelihood of dementia being 
mentioned in medical records if these are used to supplement partial information. Medical records data were 
used in some studies (not the Stockholm and CFAS study) which could be expected to increase estimates as this 
method will be subject to change diagnostic boundaries and greater likelihood of contact with services across 
time. These data are not provided so that its impact cannot be assessed.

2. The figures are different from the original paper (Qiu et al., 2013) as they are corrected by the authors of Stockholm study; after adjusting 
for age, gender and education, the hazard ratio of two cohort (II vs. I) was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.98), which indicated that the younger cohort 
had significantly longer survival time than the older cohorts.
