PURPOSE. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYL1001, a short interfering (si) RNA targeting
the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), for the
treatment of dry eye disease (DED).
METHODS. This study combines a phase I and two phase II clinical trials to test different doses
of SYL1001 in a total of 156 healthy subjects and patients with DED. After 10 days of
treatment, the primary efficacy endpoints were the effect on (1) the scoring in the Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaires, and (2) ocular
tolerance evaluated by corneal fluorescein staining and conjunctival hyperemia. Secondary
endpoints included the assessment of systemic and local tolerance.
RESULTS. Topical administration of SYL1001 1.125% once daily produced a significant decrease
in VAS scores compared with placebo from day 4 until the end of treatment (change from
baseline at day 10: �1.73 6 0.32 vs. �0.91 6 0.34; P ¼ 0.013). For all treatments, OSDI
scores were significantly reduced compared to their respective baseline values (P < 0.01),
although no significant changes were detected between groups. Conjunctival hyperemia
(quantified as normal or abnormal) significantly improved after instillation of SYL1001 1.125%
compared with placebo (50% vs. 20%; P < 0.05). Excellent tolerability was reported, with no
differences in the rates of occurrence of adverse events between groups.
CONCLUSION. These trials achieved their primary endpoints of identifying the most effective
dose of SYL1001 (1.125%). SYL1001 showed a large safety margin and may provide novel
therapeutic opportunity for the relief of dry eye. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01438281,
NCT01776658, and NCT02455999.)

D
ry eye is a common and multifactorial disease character-
ized by a disruption of the tear film and concurrent ocular
surface damage.1 The leading causes of dry eye disease (DED)
include dysfunction of meibomian glands, a decrease in mucin
production, chronic blepharitis, refractive surgery, and envi-
ronmental conditions. Associated symptoms often refers to
redness, irritation, itching, and burning eyes, resulting in eye
discomfort and pain in most severe cases. Although no uniform
diagnostic criteria have yet been established, an estimated 300
million people worldwide are thought to suffer from DED.2
Very few therapeutic options are currently available to these
patients. The first line treatment involves the use of ocular
artificial tear substitutes, gels, and ointments, followed by the
application of anti-inflammatory agents, and ultimately instilla-
tion of serum or umbilical cord serum eye drops.3 Overall,
these agents showed low efficacy in the treatment of DED and
the relief of related symptoms, mainly in patients with
moderate to severe disorder. Restasis (Allergan, Inc., Irvine,
CA, USA) in the United States and Ikervis (Santen, St. Albans,
UK) in Europe, are two cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsions
approved for the management of chronic dry eye caused by
inflammation. Very recently, Xiidra (lifitegrast; Shire, Lexington,
MA, USA), an integrin antagonist, has also been approved in the
United States for the relief of signs and symptoms of dry eye.
However, uncertainty remains about the relative efficacy of
these agents compared with placebo. In addition, they have
been associated with distinct side effects such as instillation
pain and irritation.4,5

 Sylentis is developing SYL1001, a novel chemically synthe-
sized 19-base pair small interfering oligonucleotide RNA (siRNA),
for the specific inhibition of the transient receptor potential
cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1). The RNA
interference (RNAi) technology allows for selective degradation
of mRNA and silencing of protein coding genes: this mechanism
produces transient silencing lasting for a prolonged period of
time, thus providing a valuable tool for the development of new
treatment strategies.6 Indeed, RNAi compounds represent a fast
growing class of new pharmaceutical drugs that target disease-
related genes. In addition to providing higher specificity than
small molecule inhibitors, they can also interfere with the
production of proteins not accessible to monoclonal antibodies.7
Several RNAi compounds have already reached advanced phases
of clinical trials in various diseases, including ophthalmic
affectations such as glaucoma and macular edema.8
A particular complication of DED consists in the appear-
ance of corneal epithelial damage, which in turn stimulates the
nerve endings in the cornea to produce eye discomfort.9
TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin receptor, is a nociceptive
transducer involved in the sensing and transmission of pain
stimuli.10 Interestingly, it has also been shown to participate in
the modulation of inflammatory response.11,12 TRPV1 is found
expressed in various eye tissues including the corneal
epithelium and the basal layer of the conjunctiva, hence
representing an important mediator of ocular pain signal.12
The current study describes the results obtained in phase I and
II clinical studies, which aim to determine the safety and
efficacy of SYL1001, a topically administered siRNA targeting
TRPV1 expression on the ocular surface.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and with International Conference in Harmoniza-
tion Guidelines on Good Clinical Practices CMP/ICH/135/95.
Subjects signed a written consent form stating that they
understood and agreed to participate in the clinical study. The
clinical trials were registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (Phase
1: NCT01438281; Phase II SYL1001_II: NCT01776658; and
SYL1001_III: NCT02455999).
SYL1001 Synthesis and Quantification
SYL1001 is a synthetic, 19-base pair double-stranded RNA
oligonucleotide duplex formulated in PBS (pH 7.2). SYL1001
against human TRPV1 mRNA consisted in the following
sequence: sense 50-AAGCGCAUCUUCUACUUCA-30 and anti-
sense 30-UGAAGUAGAAGAUGCGCUU-50. siRNAs were synthe-
sized by Biospring (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). For clinical
trials, solutions were aliquoted into sterile single-dose vials at
GP Pharm (Barcelona, Spain), as preservative-free solution. The
vehicle formulation was used as placebo. Quantification of
SYL1001 in plasma samples was performed using the ultra-
performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrome-
try (UPLC MS/MS); this method was validated at Harlan
Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain). The concentration interval of
the bioanalytical procedure was 10 ng/mL (lower limit of
quantification, LLOQ) to 500 ng/mL (upper limit of quantifi-
cation, ULOQ).13
Clinical Trials Study Design
This report combines a phase I and two phase II (named
SYL1001_II and III) clinical trials. The phase I study was a
single-center, randomized, parallel, intrinsically-controlled,
open-label trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and bioavail-
ability of ocular SYL1001 at 2.25% after topical administration
in healthy volunteers (Table 1). The phase II clinical trials were
multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled and double
masked studies to assess the safety and efficacy of SYL1001
in patients with DED. The SYL1001_II study was conducted at
six sites in Spain; SYL1001_III trial was performed in Spain and
Estonia at four and two sites, respectively. Both were dose-
finding studies, testing SYL1001 at 1.125% or 2.25% in the trial
SYL1001_II, and 0.375% or 0.75% in the trial SYL1001_III,
against placebo (see Schedule in Table 1).
Subjects
The phase I clinical trial included thirty healthy volunteers of
both sexes aged between 18 to 38 years who had IOP values
below 21 mm Hg, logMAR visual acuity of 0.10 or better, and
presented normal values in fluorescein clearance test (FCT)
and in ocular fundoscopy. In all cases, the drug was instilled to
one randomly chosen eye. Both the randomized treated eye
prior to administration and the untreated eye served as a
control for ocular tolerance and safety evaluations. Both eyes
were monitored in a masked fashion. The first patient first visit
(FPFV) was July 28, 2011 and the last patient last visit (LPLV)
November 28 2011.
In the combined safety and efficacy trials, a total of 126
patients were randomly allocated to the different treatment

 groups as depicted in Table 1. The sample size was based on
practical considerations with the aim of detecting a signal. At a
two-sided significance level (a) of 5% and power of 90%, 20
patients per arm were considered sufficient to detect
significant differences, if any, between the doses. Sixty patients
were randomized in the SYL1001_II study and 66 patients in
the SYL1001_III trial (Fig. 1; Table 1). Inclusion criteria were
patients of both sexes aged over 18 years with mild to
moderate dry eye lasting for more than 3 months. Symptoms
scores were Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI; Allergan,
Inc.) between 13 and 70, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
between 2 and 7. Ocular parameters 15 days prior to inclusion
were: (1) Oxford scale ‡1, 2) tear break up time (TBUT) <10
seconds, and (3) Schirmer’s test with anesthesia less than 10
mm/5 minutes. Relevant exclusion criteria included but were
not limited to: previous refractory surgery, use of contact
lenses during the treatment and the preceding 15 days, change
in the pre-established administration schedule of artificial tears,
concomitant use of other medications with analgesic activity,
and initiation of treatment with cyclosporine. Subjects who
fulfilled one of the following conditions were removed from
the study: withdrawal of the informed consent, major protocol
violation or intolerable adverse event. In all studies, compre-
hensive physical and ocular tests were performed in order to
insure that volunteers met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.
FPFV-LPLV for SYL1001_II was February 18, 2013 to April 30,
2015. FPFV-LPLV for SYL1001_III was June 29, 2015 to
December 10, 2015.
Treatment Schedule
In accordance with the Guidelines on Strategies to Identify and
Mitigate Risks for First in Human Clinical Trials with
Investigational Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWG/
28367/07), the phase I study was divided into two distinct
periods, as previously described.13 Briefly, during the first
period, six patients were first treated with a single dose of
SYL1001 and observed for 72 hours (Table 1). During the
second period, multiple doses of SYL1001 were administered
in one randomized eye of each of 12 other patients, once a day
for 7 days. In the Phase II clinical trials, the screening visit took
place within a period of 15 days prior to the first day of
administration. Treatment was allocated following a pre-
established randomization list using a random design by
blocks. Randomized patients were coded with a 5-digit
identifier, and packaging was identical regardless of the
treatment arm. Masking codes were sent to the reporting
statistician by the packaging company after database lock
following conclusion of treatment. Clinical study information
for randomized trials is summarized in Supplementary Table
S1.
The treatment was instilled in both eyes at the Investiga-
tional Centers during the morning for 10 consecutive days with
either 40 lL of placebo or SYL1001 at 0.375%, 0.75%, 1.125%,
and 2.25 % (Table 1). At least 1 hour after the last drug
instillation on Day 10, all safety and ocular parameters were
reassessed. A follow-up visit for the assessment of AEs and
symptoms progression was conducted personally or by phone
between days 14 and 20.
Assessment of Tolerability and Outcome Measures
The primary and secondary safety endpoints of the phase I trial
are presented in Table 1. Ophthalmic evaluation and compre-
hensive clinical evaluations were performed during the
screening period and upon final physical examination in each
FIGURE 1.
Participant flow chart diagram. The total number of patients screened in the combined phase II trials (SYL1001_II and SYL1001_III) was
129, and allocation to treatment was 126. One patient did not receive medication and was excluded for the safety analysis. The Intention to Treat
and safety analysis comprises all subjects who were randomized to any of the study treatments and received at least one dose of study medication.

 of the study intervals, as described previously.13 The primary
objectives of the Phase II studies were to evaluate the effect of
SYL1001 on VAS and OSDI scores, and to assess the ocular
tolerance by recording the frequency of conjunctival hyperae-
mia occurrence and change in Corneal fluorescein staining
(CFS). Ophthalmic examination (including Schirmer’s test and
TBUT) and clinical test were performed for safety evaluation as
secondary objectives. The OSDI questionnaire was first used to
evaluate the severity of the disease. The intensity of ocular pain
was assessed using a VAS with a scale of 0 (no ocular discomfort)
to 10 (maximum eye pain). At the screening visit, these two
questionnaires were filled before performing any ophthalmic
evaluation. For TBUT, a drop of 2% fluorescein solution was
instilled and the interval between the last blink and the first
evidence of tear film disruption was recorded once. For safety
evaluation, conjunctival hyperemia was ranked as normal or
abnormal, blepharitis in the anterior chamber as present or
absent, and tear meniscus as normal or thin by a masked
investigator. Corneal fluorescein staining was graded using the
Oxford scale (0–4). The Schirmer’s test was assessed with
anesthesia during 5 minutes. All evaluations were made by a
masked investigator. For CFS and hyperemia, the percentage of
patients that showed improvement, maintenance, or worsening
in respect to total group population was calculated. During the
treatment schedule, VAS was performed by the patient at each
visit before drug administration. Ophthalmic and clinical
evaluation at day 10 was performed in the same order and at
similar time of the day as the screening visit.
Statistical Analysis
For clinical trial data, normal limits were assessed using
Shapiro-Wilk test. All analyses of the continuous efficacy
variables within each group (before and after treatment) were
performed by 1-sample t-Test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test in
case of not normally distributed data). Differences among
groups were evaluated by repeated measurements ANOVA,
with the treatment group adjusting for others factors (eye and
time). Treatment groups were tested at the two-sided 5%
significance level. Corneal fluorescein staining and hyperemia
were categorized as improvement, worsening, and mainte-
nance from initial to day 10 visit and summarized by treatment
group. Categorical safety endpoints were analyzed using the v2
test (or log-likelihood ratio test) and continuous variables using
an ANOVA analysis (or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate). The
right eye was selected for the analyses in the phase II studies.
For VAS evaluation, results obtained from day 1 to day 10 prior
to administration (corresponding to 0–9 instillations) were
used. The SAS software Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
RESULTS
Clinical Safety and Tolerability
Thirty subjects were included in the Phase I safety study;
demographic characteristics are presented in Table 2. The
comprehensive ocular analysis did not reveal any clinically
significant changes in the tested parameters, at any of the doses
tested and either scheduled periods (Supplementary Table S2).
The differences in IOP and in pupil diameter observed in one
treated and one untreated eye, respectively, were assessed as
not related to SYL1001. Sixteen mild AEs were reported in 13
healthy volunteers throughout the study, all of which resolved
during the study period. All AEs were considered by the
investigator as not related to the investigational medication or
as unlikely related in the case of foreign body sensation.
Importantly, no significant differences in the occurrence or
frequency of AEs were observed between treated and
untreated eyes (P ¼ 0.317). Finally, when comparing the
screening with the final periods, no clinically significant
changes were observed in the results of physical examination,
laboratory parameters, vital signs, and electrocardiogram
(ECG); all parameters remained within standard limits (data
not shown). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that SYL1001
could not be detected in any of the collected plasma samples at
all distinct time-points following ocular instillation (LLOQ <10
ng/mL). Of interest, previous stability analysis demonstrated
that the half-life of SYL1001 is much longer in human aqueous
humour than in serum (up to 40 times; data not shown). This
suggests that the compound is stable enough to exert its effect
in the eye but is rapidly degraded when reaching the systemic
circulation.
Similar safety findings were made in the combined
tolerability and efficacy trials; demographic data and flowchart
of patient inclusion are presented in Table 3 and Figure 1,
respectively. In the group of 60 patients that were treated in
the SYL1001_II study, eight possibly or probably related AEs
were reported in a total of five patients (Table 4). In the
SYL1001_III study, 66 patients received a treatment and a total
of seven possibly or probably medication-related AEs were
recorded (Table 4). One patient receiving the SYL1001 0.75%
formulation discontinued the treatment due to abnormal eye
sensation and headache, both of which were of moderate
severity with a possible link to the medication. No serious AEs
were reported in all of the clinical trials. Most reported AEs
were of mild intensity and resolved without causing deviations
from the study protocol. Finally, no significant differences in AE
frequency were observed between treatment groups. Overall,
these results suggest that SYL1001, at each of the tested doses,
displays good local and systemic tolerability.
Efficacy
Baseline data recorded at the screening visit during the phase II
clinical trials are presented in Table 3; no statistically
significant differences were found between all groups at this
time-point. With regard to the OSDI test, a significant decrease
of approximately 30% in total score from initial visit to day 10
was detected for all groups (P < 0.05, Fig. 2A, left panel).
However, no differences were observed between treatments.
Ocular Surface Disease Index scores computed during the last
visit are presented in Table 5. The differences in mean change
between the initial and last visits were similar in all groups (Fig.
2A, right panel). In order to obtain a more detailed
comparison, questions from the OSDI questionnaire were
divided into two categories (related to vision or ocular
discomfort), however no significant differences were detected
between groups (data not shown). These data indicate that

 both SYL1001 and placebo are associated with a decrease in
OSDI score.
The degree of ocular pain was assessed before and after
treatment with SYL1001 or placebo. Visual Analogue Scale
scores at day 10 were significantly lower than at day 1 in all
groups (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the comparison of VAS scores
demonstrated a decrease in ocular pain after instillation of
SYL1001 1.125% (SYL1001_II trial) compared with placebo,
while the other doses did not produce a statistical significant
effect (Fig. 2B, left panels). Significant differences were found
from day 4 on, and VAS values remained fairly constant over the
remaining course of treatment (P < 0.05%). Mean change in
VAS scores between day 10 and day 1 also indicate a significant
improvement in ocular pain after treatment with the SYL1001
1.125% dose (P ¼ 0.013, Fig. 2B, right panels).
Interestingly, conjunctival hyperemia showed improvement
from abnormal to normal grade in 50% of the eyes 10 days after
instillation with SYL1001 1.125%, the difference was statisti-
cally significant compared with that of placebo (P < 0.05,
Table 5). As for corneal staining, 70% of patients showed
improvement of at least 18 on the Oxford scale after treatment
with SYL1001 1.125% compared with 50% for placebo;
however, this difference did not reach the level of statistical
significance (P ¼ 0.07, Table 5). When an improvement of at
least 28 was considered, improvement was reached by 40% of
the patients treated with SYL1001 1.125% compared with 15%
for placebo and 0% for SYL1001 2.25%; while the difference
between SYL1001 1.125% and SYL1001 2.25% was statistically
significant (P ¼ 0.004), the difference with placebo was not,
possibly due to small sample size (Table 5). Surprisingly,
administration of SYL1001 at 0.75% and 1.125% significantly
increased the change in TBUT at day 10 compared with
baseline (P < 0.05, Table 5). However, no significant
differences in mean change were found between groups.
Summary data for conjunctival hyperemia, CFS, and TBUT are
presented in Figure 3. Finally, blepharitis, Schirmer’s test, tear
meniscus, IOP
, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) did not
show any clinically significant changes (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates that topical SYL1001, a new
siRNA compound targeting TRPV1, can reduce ocular pain and
conjunctival hyperemia in patients with DED. Moreover,
SYL1001 was found to have an excellent safety and tolerability
profile at all tested doses (0.375%, 0.75%, 1.125%, and 2.25%).
In the phase I clinical trial, no treatment-related changes
were detected in all of the ocular safety parameters. Moreover,

 serum levels of SYL1001 in treated volunteers were always
below detection limit, consistent with the rapid degradation of
siRNAs by serum ribonucleases; this represents a major
advantage for a locally administered compound as it avoids
any possible systemic toxicity. In the phase II trials, all reported
AEs were of mild intensity, and no differences in AEs
occurrence were observed between treatment and placebo
groups. These safety results are in line well with those
previously obtained by our group in nonclinical safety studies,
as well as in trials using siRNA in ophthalmic solutions.13 Taken
together, these observations indicate excellent safety and local
tolerability for SYL1001.

 The phase II trials also met their primary efficacy endpoints.
Hence, these studies demonstrate that SYL1001 1.125%
significantly reduced ocular pain scores, as measured by VAS,
from day 4 to the end of treatment compared with placebo.
The delay in reaching a statistically significant reduction
probably results from the long half-life of the receptor. Of
note, the fact that intermediate doses of SYL1001 produced
greater effect than higher doses is consistent with the
mechanism of action of siRNA. The adequate dose to be
administered remains a most challenging problem in RNAi
technology: the siRNA must efficiently enter the target cells for
further processing by the RNAi silencing complex, processes
that may lead to saturation.14 It follows then, that the dose of
siRNA ought to be high enough to produce gene knockdown,
but the concentration of the compound at the target site
should not compromise endocytosis and processing by the
RISC complex. In support of this evidence, preclinical
biodistribution analysis performed by our group revealed that
maximal amounts of SYL1001 are detected in the cornea and
conjunctiva of rabbit eyes after administration of SYL1001 at
1.125%, whereas higher concentrations did not result in
greater penetration (data not shown). Finally, other clinical
studies have also found great variability in the response to
different doses of specific siRNA.15
An improvement in OSDI scores was observed after
treatment with SYL1001; however, its magnitude was similar
to that observed with placebo. Comparable findings have been
reported in other trials that failed to find improvement in OSDI
score after treatment compared with placebo.16,17 Through the
selection of subjective endpoints related to eye dryness and
discomfort, recent studies achieved more clinically significant
results.18,19 Consequently, a growing number of reports now
focus on these types of questionnaires, such as the new Ora
Calibra Ocular Discomfort scale, which are generally more
consistent with the symptoms reported by patients with
DED.20,21
In the present study, a placebo effect was detected for both
the VAS and OSDI parameters, which is consistent with previous
reports that also observed an effect of placebo in the relief of
eye dryness and discomfort, and even on CFS.18,22 Herein, the
two phase II trials included patients with mild to moderate DED;
of interest, patients suffering from mild dry eye usually find
relief in the use of artificial tears, and such impression might
have also been achieved through the use of the placebo. In
order to substantiate this hypothesis, the data from both groups
(treatment and placebo) were dichotomized based on low (�4)
or high (>4) initial VAS; the subgroup analysis showed that in
patients with high VAS, the decrease produced by SYL1001
1.125% was more pronounced than that produced by the
placebo (P¼0.0027, data not shown). This observation suggests
that future studies should be conducted in more advanced cases
of DED. Such patients have already been selected in different
studies, such as the ones evaluating the efficacy of cyclosporine
(OSDI scores ‡ 23), Lifitegrast (VAS ‡ 40/100), MIM-D3 (TBUT
� 5 seconds), and Rebamipide (Schirmer � 5).5,18–20
In addition to pain stimuli, SYL1001 may prevent the
activation of TRPV1 caused by tear hyperosmolarity. Such
activation has been shown to induce the release of proin-
flammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1b.11 These
inflammatory mediators cause epithelial damage, loss of goblet
cells, and deregulation of mucin expression that together lead
to tear film instability, which might explain the extended TBUT
found after treatment with SYL1001. Our study showed an
improvement in conjunctival hyperemia and in CFS after
exposure to SYL1001 1.125%, suggesting a link with the
underlying signalling pathways.23 Due to the potential

 inhibitory effect of TRPV1 on fibrosis,24 we have performed
preclinical studies in a rabbit model of corneal wound healing
and showed that such process is not affected by SYL1001.
Moreover, the transparency of the cornea was found to be
increased after treatment with SYL1001 (data not shown).
Taken together, these data suggest an advantage for the use of
SYL1001 over cyclosporine eye drops (Ikervis), which was only
proved to decrease the expression of one inflammatory marker,
with minimal improvement in CFS, and nonsignificant trends for
osmolarity and eye discomfort (OSDI and VAS).5 Another
advantage for SYL1001 is its excellent safety profile, with a
low proportion of patients with medication-related AEs (4% in
each arm) compared with Ikervis (37%). The most frequently
reported AE of cyclosporine was pain at the instillation site,
which is liable to reduce compliance to treatment. Because the
SYL1001 trials were dose finding studies, some of the limitations
include a short treatment period and small sample size.
However, future trials should allow a more robust demonstra-
tion of the efficacy of this siRNA.
Overall, the intrinsic properties of TRPV1 confirm its
selection as a suitable candidate for targeting pain-related
diseases. In this project, we have developed a new siRNA
compound targeting TRPV1, formulated in a sterile ophthalmic
solution, that can reduce ocular pain scores assessed by VAS, as
well as conjunctival hyperemia associated to dry eye.
