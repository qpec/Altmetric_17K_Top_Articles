ABSTRACT
The microbiome of wild Mus musculus (house mouse), a globally distrib-
uted invasive pest that resides in close contact with humans in urban centers, is
largely unexplored. Here, we report analysis of the fecal virome of house mice in
residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected at seven sites in
Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a period of 1 year. Unbiased high-
throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera,
including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15
viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver. We identified
an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses being associated with spe-
cific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number
of viruses detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found
neither genetic footprints to known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to lym-
phocytic choriomeningitis virus.
IMPORTANCE
Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential.
Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a concern for public
health. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investi-
gating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in
multiple locations within New York City over a period of 1 year, we found a diverse
collection of viruses that includes some previously not associated with house mice
and others that appear to be novel. Although we found no known human patho-
gens, our findings provide insights into viral ecology and may yield models that
have utility for clinical microbiology.

W
ild Mus musculus (house mouse) is an adept colonizer of the built environment
and an important rodent pest species. House mice have been associated with the
transmission of two zoonotic agents, Leptospira spp. (1) and lymphocytic choriomen-
ingitis virus (LCMV) (2); both are transmitted through contact with murine excreta. The
carriage of other pathogenic organisms, such as Enterococcus faecium (3), Clostridium
difficile (4), and Salmonella spp. (5), has also been demonstrated, further illustrating
their potential to act as a zoonotic reservoir. Serosurveys conducted in Baltimore, MD,
USA (6); Manchester, United Kingdom (7); and Rome, Italy (1), found these mice to be
carriers of LCMV, Toxoplasma gondii, and pathogenic Leptospira spp., respectively,
further highlighting the risks that they present to urban centers.
Large urban centers such as New York City (NYC) provide ideal habitats for rodents
such as house mice, because the combination of aging, interconnected infrastructure
and a dense human population provides ample opportunity for them to thrive (8).
Large apartment buildings provide unfettered access to shelter, warmth, and ample

 food sources, the last often concentrated inside compactor rooms where general waste
from the apartments above is consolidated prior to disposal. Mice that have colonized
these buildings are shielded from extreme temperatures and have sufficient food to
breed year-round (9). The continuous maintenance and interapartment spread of their
population, aided by a rapid and prolific breeding cycle, are integral to their commensal
lifestyle and a key factor in the high levels of interaction that they have with humans
(10).
Here, we report investigation of house mice for the presence of known and novel
viruses utilizing a two-tiered discovery approach of broad, unbiased high-throughput
sequencing (UHTS) supplemented with targeted molecular screening. We also report
surveillance for the presence of serum antibodies to LCMV using an infected-cell
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS
Mouse collection. A total of 416 mice were trapped from seven sites in four
boroughs over a 15-month period in NYC (Fig. 1). Mice were caught in or around
compactor rooms in the subbasements of residential multifamily housing apartment
buildings with the exception of site K1 in Brooklyn, where 5 mice were trapped in food
preparation/storage areas of a commercial building, and site X3, where a single mouse
was trapped in a private apartment. For sites M3 and Q1, a second site visit occurred
6 and 11 months after the first trapping, respectively (designated site-1 and site-2).
Thirty-seven mice from Queens time point 1 (Q1-1) and 1 mouse from time point 2
(Q1-2) were swabbed and bled; however, no organs were collected. In 21 mice, serum
volumes were insufficient to complete LCMV ELISAs.
Overall, we trapped more males than females (54% male), especially at site M2
(81%). In total, we collected 194 adults, 70 subadults, and 152 juveniles. Significant
differences in the lengths of mice (an indirect measure of age) were observed between
sites (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA], P � 0.001), with M3 mice significantly
longer than mice in Q1 (P � 0.003) and M2 (P � 0.001). Furthermore, mice from site M3
were also significantly heavier (independent of length) than mice in Q1 (Δ � 1.08 g;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 1.55; P � 0.001), X1 (Δ � 1.44 g; 95% CI, 0.70 to
2.18; P � 0.001), and K1 (Δ � 2.93 g; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.75; P � 0.002).
Targeted molecular and serological testing. Screening for LCMV was carried out
using two PCR assays and an ELISA. Neither PCR assay detected active infection in
kidney tissues (0/378 samples). ELISAs of sera from 395 mice found no LCMV IgG
antibodies.
Viral discovery. We assayed pools of 2 to 4 samples representing the fecal pellets
of mice trapped individually or in multicatch traps using UHTS. A total of 707,980,718
reads were generated from three lanes of sequencing. Of these reads, 6.2% mapped to
the host genome. Using sequence similarity searches on all obtained sequences
(assembled sequences and remaining reads, n � 138,791,811), 3.0% were annotated as
viral sequences, 0.6% were annotated to phages, and a further 31.2% did not return any
results. From these data, sequences representing a total of 36 viruses from 18 families
and 21 genera were identified. Based upon International Committee on the Taxonomy
of Viruses (ICTV) criteria, these included sequences from 6 novel viruses and 3 tentative
new genera. Through phylogenetic and sequence similarity analysis, we classified 29 of
these viruses as vertebrate associated and 7 as insect associated (Tables 1 and 2).
Overall, 2.7% of all reads mapped to the sequences of these 36 viruses. The majority of
these reads were sourced from Manhattan mice (M2 and M3-1) and accounted for
68.3% of all viral reads. A total of 3.0% of reads from Bronx and Brooklyn mice mapped
to the 36 viruses, compared to 0.6% of Queens (Q1-1) and 7.1% in Manhattan. A single
pool from Manhattan dominated the data set with 6.95 million reads (from a total of
9.02 million) mapping to murine-associated porcine bocavirus (MuAPBV). A heat map
displaying the mapping of all reads to the sequences of the 36 viruses identified in this
study is shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material.

 The majority (23/29) of vertebrate-associated viruses were at least 70% identical to
their closest relative at nucleotide level. Of the 29 vertebrate-associated viruses iden-
tified in pooled fecal pellets by UHTS, 15 were selected (Table 2) for PCR screening of
individual anal swabs (AS) and liver samples to assess overall prevalence, distribution,
and diversity. These viruses represented a broad cross section of viral genome types
that either belonged to a genus or family that includes viruses known to cause human
infection or are unique or novel to house mice. Sanger sequencing was performed on
11 of these viral genomes to confirm UHTS data (Fig. S2). The sequences of the
remaining four murine viruses (murine norovirus [MNV], murine rotavirus [MuRotaV],
murine hepatitis virus [MHV], and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus [LaDV]) were

 not confirmed with Sanger sequencing because sequences obtained through UHTS
were consistent with previous reports (11–14). MNV, MuRotaV, and MHV sequences
were obtained directly from UHTS of feces. The near-complete genomic sequence for
LaDV, a hepatotropic virus, was obtained from UHTS of liver.
Viral characterization and phylogenetics. (i) Parvoviruses. A large diversity of
parvoviruses was identified from UHTS that included members from the Parvovirinae
(n � 8) and Densovirinae (n � 4) subfamilies. The arthropod-associated members of the
Densovirinae subfamily were not explored further.
One parvovirus, tentatively named murine chapparvovirus (MuCPV), is a member of
a newly proposed genus within the Parvovirinae subfamily, Chapparvovirus (15). MuCPV
is most closely related to Desmodus rotundus parvovirus, sharing 59% amino acid
similarity across the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and 60% in the capsid. MuCPV was
detected in AS samples from all sites, excluding those with the smallest sample
numbers (X2, X3, and K1). The prevalence of MuCPV DNA in AS was high relative to
other viruses detected in this study; positive results were obtained in 19% of mice from
M2, 45% of mice from M3, 44% of mice from Q1, and 13% of mice from X1 (Table 3).
MuCPV DNA was detected in liver samples at a higher rate than any other virus, with
34% of all mice being positive (Table 3); 21% of all mice were positive in both the liver
and AS (data not shown). The prevalence of MuCPV in liver increased with age: 5% of
all juveniles and 62% of adults were positive. NS1 nucleotide sequence identity was
high between mice, with all positive samples being �98% identical, irrespective of site.

 Phylogenetic analysis of the NS1 protein confirmed the close relationship between
MuCPV and other members of the Chapparvovirus genus (Fig. 2). MuCPV was placed in
a well-supported (95% bootstrap nodal support) clade that also included two bat
parvoviruses, Eidolon helvum parvovirus 2 and Desmodus rotundus parvovirus, and the
more distantly related rat parvovirus 2. According to a recent proposal to the ICTV,
species demarcation within the Parvoviridae family requires �15% amino acid diver-
gence from other species across the NS1 protein (16). Thus, with 41% divergence,
MuCPV represents a tentative new species member of the proposed Chapparvovirus
genus.
Two bocaviruses, the first to be described in M. musculus, were also confirmed from
fecal pellets. MuAPBV was closely related to porcine bocavirus (91% nucleotide identity
and 94% amino acid similarity across the NS1 protein); murine bocavirus (MuBV) was
more divergent, sharing only 50% amino acid similarity with rat bocavirus in the NS1
protein gene. These bocaviruses were 55% similar to each other at the amino acid level
in the NS1 protein, and each virus was present at different sites (Table 3). PCR of AS
demonstrated that MuAPBV was primarily confined to site M3 (43% prevalence) with
just two positive mice at Q1 (1% prevalence) (Table 3). The presence of nucleic acid in
liver was similarly high at site M3, with 34% of mice positive by PCR (Table 3). Unlike
MuAPBV, MuBV was restricted to Q1 (10% prevalence in AS) and was rarely detected in
the liver.
Phylogenetic analysis placed both viruses in the Bocaparvovirus genus (Fig. 2).
MuAPBV clustered closely with porcine bocaviruses, while MuBV was located on a sister
branch with respect to MuAPBV. Using the proposed species demarcation cutoff of
�15% amino acid distance in the NS1 protein (16), MuAPBV is defined as a member of
the Ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 species, whereas MuBV meets the criteria for a distinct
bocaparvovirus.

 (ii) Polyomavirus. A novel polyomavirus was identified in fecal pellets from a single
site in Brooklyn. The complete circular genome of Mus musculus polyomavirus 3
(MmusPyV-3) was 5,091 nucleotides (nt) long and encoded VP1, VP2, and VP3 on one
strand as well as the small and large T antigens (LTAg) on the other, with coding
regions separated by a presumptive noncoding control region (Fig. S2). Alignment of
the LTAg using BLASTn revealed that the virus shared 75% nucleotide identity with
Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 2 (RnorPyV-2) (17). According to ICTV guidelines, this
virus meets the definition for classification of a tentative new species as it has (i) a
typical polyomavirus genome organization and (ii) an association with M. musculus; (iii)
the genetic distance to the most closely related species, RnorPyV-2, is �15%; and
finally, (iv) the complete genome sequence has been acquired (18). MmusPyV-3 DNA
was detected in the AS of 2 mice (one of these mice was also PCR positive in the liver)
from site K1 in Brooklyn, resulting in a combined prevalence of 0.5% for all mice

 (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis of LTAg placed MmusPyV-3 within the ICTV-recognized
Betapolyomavirus genus in a well-supported clade (98% bootstrap support) shared with
other rodent polyomaviruses, including RnorPyV-2, bank vole polyomavirus, and com-
mon vole polyomavirus, as well as the two human-associated viruses, Wu and Ki
polyomaviruses (Fig. S3). This finding lends support to the suggestion that the ancestor
of this clade may have been found in a rodent (19).
(iii) Astroviruses. From each of the four boroughs, astroviral sequences were
recovered that shared nucleotide sequence identity with murine and rat astroviruses.
Two unique astroviruses, designated murine astrovirus 1 (MuAst-1) and murine astro-
virus 2 (MuAst-2), were confirmed following direct PCR that targeted the open reading
frame (ORF) 1b-ORF2 junction. The astroviruses were 28% similar to each other across
the capsid protein and 52% identical at the nucleotide level within the PCR product.
Each assembled sequence contained a typical astrovirus genome structure (Fig. S2).
MuAst-1 was most closely related to murine astroviruses found in laboratory mice
across North America and shared 88% amino acid similarity over the complete capsid
sequence (20). The second astrovirus, MuAst-2, was most closely related (75% amino
acid similarity in capsid) to an astrovirus recovered from Norway rats in Hong Kong
(astrovirus rat/RS126/HKG/2007) (21). Astrovirus nucleic acid was detected in AS from
all sites for both viruses with the exceptions of MuAst-1 in K1 and MuAst-2 in X1/2/3.
Prevalence in the remaining sites was high, ranging from 21% to 40% for MuAst-1 and

 20% to 60% for MuAst-2 (Table 3). Virus was also detected in liver samples with 11% of
all mice being positive for MuAst-1 and 19% for MuAst-2 (Table 3). Fifty-eight mice
carried both astroviruses in their AS. Eight mice were PCR positive for each virus in their
livers.
Current ICTV-recognized Mamastrovirus species are separated by greater than 37.8%
amino acid distance in the capsid protein; thus, both astroviruses discovered in this
study do not likely constitute novel species (22). Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid
protein places MuAst-1 in a clade shared with murine astroviruses (100% bootstrap
support). MuAst-2 shares a clade with the two rat astroviruses from Hong Kong (100%
bootstrap support) (Fig. S4).
(iv) Sapovirus. A novel sapovirus (murine sapovirus [MuSaV]) was discovered in
fecal pellets from Manhattan (M2 and M3) and Queens (Q1) with 42% amino acid
similarity to porcine sapovirus across the complete polyprotein and 54% amino acid
similarity across the major capsid protein (VP1) to a partially sequenced rodent sapo-
virus identified in brown rats from NYC (sapovirus 1 rodent/Manhattan/Ro-SaV1) (23).
This is the first sapovirus reported in house mice. The similarity in the VP1 protein (54%)
is less than the proposed 57% cutoff used to define a new genogroup (24); therefore,
MuSaV may warrant the creation of a 16th genogroup within the Sapovirus genus.
Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 protein sequence for all sapovirus genogroups supports
the creation of a tentative new genogroup, as MuSaV is found on a deeply rooted
branch with Ro-SaV1 as its closest neighbor (sole member of genogroup XV) (100%
bootstrap support) (Fig. S5). The near-complete coding sequence for MuSaV demon-
strated a genome structure consistent with other sapoviruses, including two ORFs
where ORF2 (VP2) overlaps ORF1 in a �1 frameshift (Fig. S2). Of 13 conserved amino
acid motifs previously identified in all sapovirus species, 9 were maintained while the
remaining 4 had single-amino-acid changes (PL[N/D]CD¡VL[N/D]CD) in NS3,
XDEYXX¡XDDYXX in NS5, and WKGL¡WRGL and GLPSG¡GIPSG in NS7) (24). The
putative NS7-VP1 cleavage site was YVME/G based on amino acid alignments of
ORF1 polyprotein with reference sequences. MuSaV was not detected in mice from
the Bronx or Brooklyn sites; however, the remaining three sites in Manhattan and
Queens were positive with prevalences ranging between 8% (Q1) and 22% (M3)
(Table 3). Juvenile mice were the most frequently positive, comprising 53% of all
positive AS samples. MoSaV RNA was detected in 9% of all mouse livers (Table 3).
(v) Picornaviruses. Murine picornavirus (MuPiV)—identified in fecal pellets in Man-
hattan, Queens, and Brooklyn—displayed 52% amino acid similarity across the poly-
protein to rabovirus A, a picornavirus detected in Norway rats that belongs to the newly
created Rabovirus genus (25). MuPiV is closely related to mouse sapelovirus M-58/USA,
a partially sequenced virus detected in the feces of a house mouse from Virginia, USA
(26). There was 77% nucleotide identity and 88% amino acid identity between the two
viruses within the short partial VP4-2 sequence that is publicly available. Phylogenetic
analysis of the MuPiV 3D polymerase indicates that it shares a common ancestor with
rabovirus A (100% bootstrap support), nested between the Sapelovirus and Enterovirus
genera (Fig. 3). MuPiV may represent a tentative new Picornaviridae genus with amino
acid similarity across the polyprotein (52%) less than the 58% cutoff defined by the ICTV
(22).
MuPiV displayed marked heterogeneity between sample sites with three clear
genotypes, sharing between 62% and 89% nucleotide identity in the VP1 region based
on available sequence from the screen PCR (270 nt). MuPiV was detected in 9% of
mouse AS with the majority of viruses found in female (74% of all detections) and
juvenile (59%) mice (Table 3). No evidence of MuPiV was found in the Bronx mice (X1,
X2, and X3) or at the M3 site in Manhattan; however, all remaining sites were positive
with prevalences ranging between 15% (Q1) and 20% (K1). Viral nucleic acid was
detected in less than 1% (3/378) of mouse livers (Table 3).
A second picornavirus, murine kobuvirus (MuKoV), was detected in feces from both
Manhattan sites (M2 and M3) and Queens (Q1). At the amino acid level, MuKoV is 83%

 similar over the full polyprotein, 93% similar in the 3D polymerase, and 71% similar in
VP1 to mouse kobuvirus M-5/USA/2010, a virus identified from a canyon mouse
(Peromyscus crinitus) in California, USA (26). The genome structure is consistent with
that of other kobuviruses (Fig. S2), and based on the amino acid similarity of the
polyprotein, P1, 2C, and 3CD, as well as phylogenetic placement, MuKoV is a member
of the Aichivirus A species within the Kobuvirus genus (Fig. 3). PCR screening of AS
samples revealed widespread prevalence of MuKoV across three sites from two bor-
oughs (M2, 24%; M3, 8%; and Q1, 22%) (Table 3). MuKoV cDNA was detected in 6/378
liver samples (Table 3).
(vi) Hepe-like virus. A highly divergent virus most closely related to hepeviruses
and other unclassified members of a newly proposed Hepe-Virga clade (27) was
identified in three NYC boroughs. Murine feces-associated hepe-like virus (MuFAHLV)
shares 37% amino acid similarity to Hubei hepe-like virus 3 (HHLV-3) across the
near-complete replicase and 29% similarity to swine hepatitis E virus. Conserved
domain searches within the replicase revealed a viral methyltransferase, viral helicase
(superfamily 1), and RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp; superfamily 2) domain. The

 capsid is contained in a 483-amino-acid (aa) open reading frame nested within the
replicase in a �1 frameshift and shared 35% amino acid similarity with HHLV-3 (Fig. S2).
A 228-aa hypothetical protein is encoded in a �1 frameshift relative to the replicase
gene with a single-nucleotide overlap. The hypothetical protein does not contain any
conserved domains and does not share any recognizable homology to other viruses.
MuFAHLV sequences were detected in fecal pellets from M2 (7% prevalence), Q1 (1%),
and X1 (3%) (Table 3). No sequences were detected in liver samples. Sequencing of the
screening PCR product that targeted a 311-nt conserved region within the RdRp
domain identified two major genotypes that were between 75.4% and 76.5% identical.
Both genotypes were found in M2, whereas only a single related genotype was
detected at Q1 and X1. Phylogenetic analysis using concatenated conserved regions of
the helicase and polymerase domains places MuFAHLV into an unclassified clade
shared with HHLV-3 (Fig. S6). These two viruses share a common ancestor with
members of the Hepeviridae that include hepatitis E virus, avian hepatitis E virus, and
the recently described cutthroat trout virus (28).
(vii) Rhabdovirus. A highly divergent rhabdovirus, provisionally named murine
feces-associated rhabdovirus (MuFARV), was identified in a single mouse trapped in
Queens (Q1). The obtained sequence shared a similar genome architecture with
members of the Rhabdoviridae, with five nonoverlapping ORFs organized as 3=-
nucleoprotein-phosphoprotein-matrix-glycoprotein-polymerase-5= separated by four
intergenic regions (66 nt, 94 nt, 68 nt, and 63 nt, respectively), with each region

 containing transcription termination (CATGAAAAAAA) and initiation (TAAC[A]ARR) sites
(Fig. S2). MuFARV is most similar to vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus across the
polymerase (38%), glycoprotein (22%), and nucleoprotein (27%); the putative matrix
and phosphoproteins were dissimilar to any known sequence by unrestricted BLASTp
similarity searches. We were unable to place MuFARV into any genus currently recog-
nized by ICTV through phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase (L) protein (Fig. 4).
MuFARV is located on a monophyletic branch that is rooted in a posterior position
relative to the Vesiculo-, Sprivi-, Perhabdo-, Ledante-, Sigma-, Curio-, Hapa-, Tibro-,
Ephemero-, Tupa-, and Sripuvirus genera. PCR screening of all available livers and AS
provided no further evidence of this virus in any other mouse, aside from the fecal
pellet and AS sourced from the single Q1 mouse.
Viral persistence at trapping sites. Virus PCR screening results were compared for
two sites that were resampled after 6 (M3) and 11 (Q1) months (Fig. S7). The two
astroviruses showed disparate patterns of persistence whereby the prevalence of
MuAst-1 increased and that of MuAst-2 decreased across both sites. Of the 14 viruses
detected at least once at both sites, only MuAPBV, MHV, MuFAHLV, and MuFARV either
emerged or disappeared from detection at a particular site. The only virus to show a
significant association with a particular collection time point was MHV at site Q1, where
prevalence rose from 0.0% to 13.2% over an 11-month period (odds ratio [OR], 42.7;
95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2 to 5,554.8; P � 0.00003). For the remaining 10 viruses,
prevalence fluctuated by a maximum of 20%, suggesting that these viruses have
established stable infection cycles.
Viral distribution and coinfection burden. Statistical analyses were used to de-
termine whether site of collection, sex, weight, or length of the mouse was associated
with an increased risk of finding a particular virus detected in AS samples. Length and
sex were not significantly associated with an increased risk for any virus (data not
shown). After controlling for length, sex, and site, a higher weight was associated with
a higher likelihood of detection for MuCPV (odds ratio � 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.32; P �
0.002) or MuAst-2 (odds ratio � 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.32; P � 0.002). We found no
other associations between weight and the presence of other viruses. The prevalence
of 12 viruses showed a significant association with a certain site or sites via pairwise

 comparisons (Table S1). Three viruses (MuAPBV, LaDV, and MHV) were significantly
associated with a single site, M3, compared with M2, Q1, and X1.
To determine the impact of location on viral richness, we calculated the total
number of viruses found in individual mice by site (Table 4). Eighty-two percent of mice
were positive for at least one virus in feces; 61% were positive for at least one virus in
liver. There were striking differences between the overall virus coinfection levels from
trapping sites in NYC (Table 5). Mice from M3 (Chelsea) carried the most viruses in AS
(2.9 viruses/mouse) and liver tissue (1.8 viruses/mouse). Conversely, mice from Bronx
site X1 (Eastchester) carried the fewest viruses in each sample type (0.4 and 0.3
virus/mouse, in feces and liver, respectively). Virus richnesses were compared between
sites after adjusting for sex, weight, and length using a Poisson regression model. M3
was found to have significantly more viruses per mouse in AS than M2, Q1, and X1
while site X1 had significantly fewer viruses than M2, M3, and Q1 (Table 6).
The sex, weight, and length of the mouse were also compared with viral coinfection
burden within the gut virome. Mouse sex and length were not significantly associated
with a difference in total viral burden (as measured by fold change between groups
[data not shown]); however, independent of mouse length, weight (as measured in
grams) was positively associated with the number of viruses detected in the AS
(1.048-fold; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.083; P � 0.005).
We also assessed whether patterns of virus coinfection varied across sites. Overall,
we could not reject the null hypothesis that the pattern of viral coinfection was random
(P � 0.470). However, some viruses had positive or negative associations with one
another. LaDV was likely to cooccur with MuAPBV (|Z-score|, 4.34; adjusted P � 0.001)
but unlikely to cooccur with MNV (|Z-score|, 3.68; adjusted P � 0.001) or MuPiV
(|Z-score|, 3.67; adjusted P � 0.001). MNV was also unlikely to cooccur with MuAPBV
(|Z-score|, 3.77; adjusted P � 0.001).
DISCUSSION
Unbiased high-throughput sequence analysis of NYC house mice yielded a diverse
collection of novel and known viruses. While 7 of these viruses are likely insect
associated, 19 of the remaining 29 vertebrate-associated viruses are either newly
described or not previously associated with house mice. The discovery of a diverse array
of viruses in wild urban mice was not unexpected. Recent virome studies of rodents
have uncovered a broad diversity of previously uncharacterized viruses (26, 29); in
earlier studies of NYC Norway rats, we found 18 novel viral sequences (23).
Although we detected no sequences of human viruses, we found sequences in
feces that had a high similarity to canine parvovirus, chicken anemia virus, and
porcine bocavirus. Canine parvovirus and chicken anemia virus sequences may only
represent contaminants in food that mice were consuming. Indeed, we cannot
comment on host relationships for any virus discovered exclusively in fecal material
(MuFAHLV and MuFARV), as they may also represent food contaminants. However,

 follow-up PCR screening of tissues revealed that murine-associated porcine boca-
virus (MuAPBV) was also present in liver, indicating that this virus is capable of
infecting mice. This finding is consistent with the recent report of a bocavirus
infection in brown rats in China (30).
MuAPBV represents a tentative new strain of the Ungulate bocavirus 4 species and
is most closely related to PBov-KU14, a virus detected in serum from pigs with
respiratory illnesses in South Korea (31). To date, MuAPBV is the only nonswine member
of the Ungulate bocavirus 4 species. The highest prevalence for MuAPBV was in Chelsea,
a site that is located close to the Meatpacking District, a neighborhood that contained
a high concentration of meat processing facilities as recently as 2003. Whether porcine
bocavirus causes disease in pigs is controversial (reviewed in reference 32). This virus
has been detected in the neurons of a piglet with encephalomyelitis (33) and has been
experimentally shown to interfere with a key interferon signaling pathway (34); how-
ever, the high rate of viral coinfections in pigs has made it difficult to confirm a direct
association with disease (32). Human bocaviruses have also been linked to disease,
including pneumonia and other respiratory infections (35, 36).
Two previously uncharacterized viruses reported here may provide insights into the
age distribution of parvoviruses and sapoviruses. The prevalence of murine chappar-
vovirus (MuCPV) was higher in the livers of adult (62%) than juvenile (5%) mice. In
humans, parvovirus B19 infection in children is associated with respiratory disease and
rash (fifth disease). In adults, parvovirus B19 has been found to persist in liver (37) and
may be associated with acute liver damage (38). In contrast, the murine sapovirus
(MuSaV) was detected more frequently in juvenile mice. Human sapoviruses are
associated with acute gastroenteritis and infect people of all ages (39). Studies of
porcine sapoviruses suggest that genogroup-specific immunity emerges early in life,
preventing reinfection (40).
We found two astroviruses that shared 28% amino acid similarity in the capsid
protein. In some instances, the two viruses were present within the same mouse.
Several other astroviruses had been described in house mice, including M-52/USA/2008
from wild mice in Virginia (26) and MuAst STL1, -2, -3, and -4 from laboratory mice in
North America and Japan (20, 41). The detection of MuAst-1 in wild NYC mice and its
phylogenetic placement in a clade shared with laboratory mouse astroviruses indicate
that these viruses share a common ancestor. The second astrovirus detected in this
study, MuAst-2, was instead more closely related to rat astroviruses and formed a
separate monophyletic clade. Together, these data suggest that the diversity of astro-
viruses in house mice may be underappreciated.
Mouse weight (but not length) was positively associated with viral diversity.
Chelsea mice, heavier than mice from other sites, harbored the most diverse
viromes. This diversity did not appear to adversely impact mouse longevity. The
longest mice in this study were trapped in Chelsea; length is commonly used as a
correlate of age.
There was no evidence of LCMV infection using molecular methods or serology.
LCMV, an uncommon cause of aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent individuals and
of life-threatening infections in those who are immunocompromised (42), is the only
zoonotic virus currently associated with house mice (2). Aside from an outbreak of 57
cases in 1973 to 1974 that was linked to hamsters (43), recently reported cases of LCMV
in New York State are rare but include an individual infection in NYC in 2009 (44) and
two cases in children in 2002 and a third in 2009 in Syracuse, NY (45).
House mice are unlike most urban rodents in that they primarily nest within or on
the immediate exterior perimeters of built structures, where they intimately coexist
with the human population (10). Accordingly, we undertook this project to understand
the risks that they may (or may not) pose for human disease in urban centers. While we
found no viruses that were closely related to human viruses, we did find evidence of
infection with a virus that may have moved from pigs to mice, providing an example
of cross-species transmission.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse collection and processing. Mice were predominantly trapped in the subbasement of
medium-sized (5- to 6-level) residential buildings in the four most populated boroughs of NYC: Man-
hattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx (46). A combination of single-catch (SFA folding trap; Sherman,
Tallahassee, FL, USA) and multiple-catch (Pro-Ketch; Kness, Albia, IA, USA; and Tin Cat; Victor, Lititz, PA)
traps were baited, secured in the open position, and left out on the first night to allow mice access to
the trap without being caught and to thus facilitate and expedite colony familiarity and help maximize
successful trapping events. On the second day, traps were wiped clean of all fecal matter and urine,
rebaited, and set. During inspection on the third day, any traps containing mice were collected, recorded,
and transferred to the laboratory.
Following euthanasia by exposure to a lethal dose of CO2 per the American Veterinary Medical
Association guidelines, mice were weighed and measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail.
Mouse age was stratified into three categories (juvenile, subadult, and adult) using the length of the
mouse (�72 mm, 72 to 77 mm, and �77 mm, respectively) (47). Immediately following euthanasia and
recording of mouse weight and length, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and transferred into
Microtainer blood collection SST tubes (Becton, Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing serum clot
activator. Mice were sampled by swabbing of the rectum and tissue harvesting, and fecal pellets were
removed from traps. When multiple-catch traps caught more than one mouse, fecal pellets retrieved
from the trap were labeled as “pooled”and therefore may represent the fecal material from one or more
mice found within that trap. All samples were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at �80°
C. Procedures
described here were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(protocol number AC-AAAE8351/AC-AAAE8450).
High-throughput sequencing. Fecal pellets from a single trap (representing one or multiple mice)
were emulsified in phosphate-buffered saline, passed through an 0.45-�m filter (Merck Millipore, Cork,
Ireland), and treated with RNase A and Benzonase to digest free nucleic acids prior to lysis and
purification on the NucliSens easyMAG automated platform (bioMérieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands). Total
nucleic acid was reverse transcribed and RNase H treated prior to pooling with a second fecal pellet
sample sourced from another trap and second-strand synthesis. Using the Focused-Ultrasonicator E210
(Covaris, Woburn, MA), double-stranded cDNA was mechanically sheared to an average length of 200 nt,
purified, and pooled once more (i.e., total of 4 samples) if low concentrations (�1.5 ng/�l) were
observed. Libraries were prepared for sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA)
using the Hyper Prep kit (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA), and sequenced on three lanes: one for
Manhattan mice (sites M2 and M3, time point 1), one for Queens mice (site Q1, time point 1), and one
for Bronx (sites X1, X2, and X3) and Brooklyn (K1) mice.
Resulting Q30-filtered FastQ files were used to generate quality control reports using PRINSEQ
software (v0.20.2) (48) and were further filtered and trimmed. Host sequences were removed by mapping
the filtered reads against mouse reference genomes using Bowtie 2 (v2.0.6, http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge
.net) (49). The remaining reads were de novo assembled using MIRA (4.0) Assembler (50), and contigs and
unique singletons were subjected to a similarity search using MegaBLAST against the GenBank nonre-
dundant nucleotide database. Sequences were screened by BLASTx against the viral GenBank protein
database if they showed little or no similarity at the nucleotide level. Viral sequences from BLASTx
analysis were subjected to another round of BLASTx similarity search against the entire GenBank protein
database to correct for biased E values and taxonomic misassignments. All 100-bp, single-end reads were
mapped with Bowtie 2 (v2.1.0) against the available genomic sequences of the 36 identified viruses
(Tables 1 and 2). The bam files were parsed using BEDTools (v2.26.0), and perl scripts were employed to
obtain the viral abundance. Virus-mapped reads were normalized relative to total reads for each pool and
compared using a heat map prepared in Microsoft Excel.
Nucleic acid extraction and PCR. Nucleic acid was extracted from liver and kidney tissues using the
AllPrep DNA/RNA minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and from AS using the easyMAG automated platform
(bioMérieux). Nucleic acid concentration and purity were determined on the NanoDrop 1000 spectro-
photometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE), and �5 �g was used for subsequent cDNA synthesis
and PCR testing.
Fifteen viruses identified from analysis of UHTS data were selected for direct PCR screening of AS and
liver cDNA. PCR primers for all 15 viruses were manually designed from the obtained UHTS data using
Geneious 10.1.2 (51) (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Direct PCR for LCMV was performed on
kidney cDNA using a species-specific assay targeting the S segment (designed for this study) and an
arenavirus consensus assay to target the L segment (52). All extracted nucleic acid was tested for
inhibitors by performing PCR for host targets glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cDNA) (53)
and M. musculus mitochondrial d-loop (DNA) (54). Primer sequences, cycling conditions, and gene targets
for all PCR assays are detailed in Table S2. All positive PCR results, excluding inhibitor-check PCRs, were
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
LCMV ELISA. An IgG assay was used to detect the presence of anti-LCMV antibodies in mouse serum.
LCMV antigen (gamma-irradiated lysate obtained from LCMV-infected Vero E6 cells) was applied as a
coating to the solid phase of a microtiter plate. Diluted mouse sera (1:160) were added to the first row
of the microtiter plate and serially diluted until a 4-fold dilution series was created. The mouse sera were
allowed to bind to the antigen, and after washing, an anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Pierce, Waltham, MA)
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was applied and allowed to bind. Plates were washed, the
substrate 2=,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)-diammonium salt was added, and the
plates were read using a preprogrammed BioTek PowerWave 340 reader with Gen 5 software (BioTek,
Winooski, VT) at the dual wavelengths of 410 and 490 nm after 30-min incubation at 37C. A mock-

 infected antigen was used to adjust for background that might be present in the initial substrate. The
optical density (OD) values of the normal antigen wells were subtracted from those of the positive
antigen to give a net positive adjusted OD value. A positive IgG result was recorded when a sample
exhibited a titer of �1:400 and a sum OD (calculated by the addition of all four of the sample dilutions)
of �0.95.
Phylogenetics. Viral sequences used for phylogenetic analyses were either confirmed by PCR or
directly sourced from UHTS data. Nucleotide sequences were translated and aligned with representative
sequences using ClustalW within Geneious 10.1.2 (51) and manually adjusted as required. Alignments
were exported into MEGA7 (55) where the model selection algorithm was used to select the best-fitting
model for each alignment. Maximum likelihood trees were assembled using a discrete gamma distribu-
tion (�G), sometimes coupled with invariant sites (�I) and/or using the nondefault amino acid frequen-
cies of the model (�F) with 500 bootstraps. Newick trees were exported to FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed
.ac.uk/software/figtree/) for annotation. Final trees display bootstrap support values when they are above
70%.
Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed using Matlab and Statistics Toolbox release 2013a (The
MathWorks, Natick, MA). Multiple comparisons and post hoc analyses were corrected using Hochberg’
s
step-up procedure (56) controlling the familywise error rate at a level of � � 0.05.
Demographic measures, including length, weight, and sex, were compared between sites. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether the length of the mice in any site was
significantly different from the length of those in any other site. Post hoc analysis was conducted to find
significant pairwise comparisons. A linear regression model was fitted using weight as the dependent
variable and multicategorical site variable as the independent variable, adjusting for length. Finally, the
distribution of sex was also compared between sites using a chi-square test with post hoc analysis.
For each virus detected, we tested the association between its presence and site or demographic
variables by fitting a logistic regression model using the binary virus presence (versus absence) status as
the dependent variable and using site, length, weight, and sex as independent variables. Because not all
viruses were not found at all sites, we applied Firth logistic regression (57) to deal with the quasicomplete
separation phenomenon. Adjustments were made for multiple comparisons (16 viruses and 10 pairwise
site comparisons).
We also tested the association between virus richness (i.e., the number of different viruses) and site
or demographic variables. The count of viruses was fitted into a Poisson regression model as the
dependent variable, and site, length, weight, and sex were used as independent variables. The familywise
error rate was controlled at the 0.05 level for the 10 pairwise site comparisons.
Patterns of viral cooccurrence were examined using the Fortran program PAIRS (v1.1) (58) with a
fixed-fixed randomization algorithm. Controlling the false discovery rate at an 0.01 level using the
Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure, attractive or repulsive relationships between individual pairs of viruses
were investigated and considered significantly nonrandom when the absolute Z-score was greater than
3.5 with an adjusted P value of �0.01.
Accession number(s). The GenBank accession numbers for viruses sequenced in this study are
MF175072 to MF175082 (Sanger-sequenced viruses, n � 11) and MF416371 to MF416405 (remaining
viruses with sequence identified from UHTS data, n � 25). The nucleotide sequences for all PCR screening
amplicons (n � 1247) can be found in Data Set S1.
