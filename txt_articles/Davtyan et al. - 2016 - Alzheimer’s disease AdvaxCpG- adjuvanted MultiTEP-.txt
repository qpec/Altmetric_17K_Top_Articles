Although β-amyloid (Aβ) may be the primary driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, accumulation 
of pathological tau correlates with dementia in AD patients. Thus, the prevention/inhibition of AD 
may require vaccine/s targeting Aβ and tau simultaneously or sequentially. Since high antibody titers 
are required for AD vaccine efficacy, we have decided to generate vaccines, targeting Aβ (AV-1959R), 
Tau (AV-1980R) or Aβ/tau (AV-1953R) B cell epitopes, based on immunogenic MultiTEP platform and 
evaluate the immunogenicity of these vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG, delta inulin, Alhydrogel®, 
Montanide-ISA51, Montanide-ISA720, MPLA-SM pharmaceutical grade adjuvants. Formulation of AV-
1959R in AdvaxCpG induced the highest cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. The dual-epitope 
vaccine, AV-1953R, or the combination of AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG 
induced robust antibody responses against various forms of both, Aβ and tau pathological molecules. 
While anti-Aβ antibody titers after AV-1953R immunization were similar to that in mice vaccinated with 
AV-1959R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination, anti-tau titers were significantly lower after AV-1953R 
injection when compared to the AV-1980R or AV-1959R/AV-1980R. In silico 3D-modeling provided insight 
into the differences in immunogenicity of these vaccine constructs. In sum, AV-1959R and AV-1980R 
formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant were identified as promising immunogenic vaccines for ongoing pre-
clinical assessment and future human clinical trials.
Aβ 
-mediated plaque formation is thought to be the primary event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis1–3. 
Later, AD pathology becomes self-propagating4–7 with less dependence on Aβ 
 and greater involvement of other 
proteins such as tau8. The temporal relationship of misfolded proteins in AD pathogenesis may have relevance to 
AD vaccine strategies. Hence, vaccines targeting Aβ 
 only may be effective prior to or in the very early stages of 
AD pathogenesis, whereas vaccines targeting tau may remain effective in latter stages of AD. Therefore, the most 
effective strategy may be to develop an immunogenic vaccine or vaccines targeting both Aβ 
 and tau, such that the 
same vaccine or the combination of vaccines would then be effective across the entire spectra of AD progression.

Safety is an important consideration in AD vaccine development given cases of aseptic meningoencephalitis 
observed previously in the AN-1792 clinical trials and likely associated with autoreactive T cell infiltration into 
the brains of vaccinated subjects9. To avoid this risk, we have developed the MultiTEP vaccine platform that 
consists of a string of 12 non-self, pathogen-derived T helper (Th) epitopes10, to which we can attach different 
 
B cell self-epitopes from neuronal proteins involved in AD pathogenesis. Previously we have demonstrated that a 
DNA vaccine composed of three copies of a B cell epitope from the N-terminal region of Aβ (Aβ 
1-11) attached to 
the MultiTEP protein (AV-1959D) was highly immunogenic in mice10,11, rabbits12 and macaques10,13. To develop 
a vaccine targeting pathological tau we decided to use the same immunogenic MultiTEP platform incorporat-
ing the tau2-18 epitope. We chose this epitope because it was previously shown that tau2-18 is normally hidden 
in microtubule bound tau conformation but becomes highly exposed during tau aggregation14,15. Importantly, 
this region of tau, also termed the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), plays an important role in activation 
of a signaling cascade involving PP1 and GSK-3 that leads to dissociation of cargo from kinesins and therefore 
anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT) inhibition. The exposure of PAD that is required for inhibition of FAT 
might be regulated by PAD phosphorylation, as well as by the N-terminal truncation of tau that occurs during 
neurofibrillary tangle formation. Phosphorylation of Y18 as well as truncation of the N-terminal region of aggre-
gated tau has been suggested to remove the toxic region and have a protective role14–17. Thus, we hypothesized 
that anti-tau2-18 antibodies will preferentially recognize pathological rather than normal forms of tau, and thereby 
prevent its aggregation and PAD mediated toxicity during the early stages of tauopathy.
Here we describe for the first time the generation of MutiTEP platform-based recombinant vaccines targeting 
Aβ 
1-11, (AV-1959R), tau2-18 (AV-1980R), or tau2-18 and Aβ 
1-11 simultaneously (dual specificity, AV-1953R) and 
report on the immunogenicity of these vaccines. We also identify a novel adjuvant, AdvaxCpG derived from delta 
inulin18, that provides optimal immune enhancement for the MutiTEP vaccines.
Results
Selection of an optimal adjuvant for anti-Aβ vaccine, AV-1959R. 
Data from previous clinical trials 
showed that high anti-Aβ 
 antibody titers correlated with a reduction in brain pathology in AN-1792 immunized 
AD patients that later came to autopsy, suggesting that therapeutic benefit was closely linked to antibody titers9. 
The cGMP grade delta inulin-based adjuvants, Advax™ 
 and AdvaxCpG were previously reported to enhance the 
immunogenicity and efficacy of various vaccines targeting viral and bacterial antigens in pre-clinical studies18–22 
and clinical trials23,24. To select an adjuvant that will induce the highest antibody response and lowest variability 
of antibody levels in response to vaccinations of mice with AV-1959R, we tested these adjuvants in parallel with 
Quil-A25, a less purified version of QS21, the adjuvant that was used in the AN-1792 clinical trials9 as well as the 
commercial adjuvants Alhydrogel®, Montanide-ISA51, Montanide-ISA720, and MPLA-SM.
The results showed that AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG induced significantly stronger antibody 
responses than all the other adjuvants with a low variability in responses between animals in the AdvaxCpG group 
(Fig. 1a). Analysis of antibody isotypes specific for Aβ 
 showed that Alhydrogel®, AdvaxTM, Montanide-ISA51 and - 
ISA720 adjuvants induced primarily an IgG1 (Th2) response, whereas AdvaxCpG, MPLA and Quil-A shifted the 
response toward IgG2ab, a Th1 response associated isotype (Figs 1b and S1). To further explore adjuvant effects 
on Th1 and Th2 phenotype, we measured the numbers of splenocytes producing IFN-γ 
 and IL-4 cytokines by 
ELISpot (spot-forming cells, SFC) and found that the AdvaxCpG group produced significantly higher frequencies 
of IFN-γ 
+ and IL-4+ Th cells than the other adjuvant groups (Fig. 2a,b). The TLR4 agonist, MPLA was the only 
other GMP-grade adjuvant that generated significant numbers of both IFN-γ 
+ and IL-4+ Th cells, although these 
were approximately 5 and 1.5 times, respectively, lower than those induced with AdvaxCpG (Fig. 2a,b). Calculation 
of the ratio of IL-4/IFN-γ 
 positive Th cells (Fig. 2c) supported the antibody isotypes data and confirmed that 
AdvaxCpG was the strongest combined Th1 and Th2 adjuvant followed by MPLA, while other adjuvants only 
generated primarily Th2 responses to immunizations with AV-1959R. The level of Th1 responses induced by the 
control adjuvant, Quil-A were comparable to MPLA, but significantly lower than in AdvaxCpG (Figs 1 and 2). 
 
Finally, AdvaxCpG was also well tolerated by all animals with no evidence of either local or systemic vaccine 
adverse reactions. On the basis of these data, AdvaxCpG was selected as the sole adjuvant for all subsequent studies 
with MultiTEP-based AD vaccines targeting Aβ 
, tau, or Aβ 
/tau simultaneously or sequentially.
Immunogenic efficacy of different AD vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant. 
All tested 
AD vaccines formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant generated equally strong T cell responses, measured by detection 
of IFN-γ 
+, IL4+ SFC or splenocytes proliferation specific to foreign Th cell epitopes incorporated in the MultiTEP 
platform (Fig. 3). Of note, no potentially harmful autoreactive Th cells were detected after re-stimulation of 
immune splenocytes with Aβ 
 or tau self-epitopes, either by ELISpot or splenocytes proliferation assay (data 
not shown). Importantly, generation of strong cellular immune responses to Th epitopes incorporated in the 
MultiTEP vaccine platform supported the production of equally high concentrations of anti-Aβ 
 antibodies in 
mice vaccinated with AV1959R/AV-1980R combination, AV-1959R, or AV-1953R. As expected, immunization 
with AV-1980R did not generate anti-Aβ 
 antibodies (Fig. 4a). It should be mentioned that concentrations of 
anti-tau antibodies were significantly lower in mice immunized with AV-1953R compared to mice vaccinated 
with the AV-1959R/AV-1980R combination or AV-1980R alone (Fig. 4b). These antibody response patterns were 
mirrored by the frequency of antibody secreting B cells (ASC); numbers of anti-Aβ 
 ASC were similar in mice 
immunized with single or combined vaccine formulations, while the numbers of anti-tau ASC were significantly 
lower in mice vaccinated with the dual-epitope AV-1953R vaccine (Fig. 5).
We hypothesized that anti-tau B cell epitopes attached to MultiTEP may not be well presented on the surface 
of the dual-epitope AV-1953R vaccine compared with the single epitope constructs. To address this possibility 
we undertook in silico structural modeling of the MultiTEP platform-based AV-1980R, AV-1959R and AV-1953R 
vaccines to examine the surface accessibility of B cell antigenic determinants of Aβ 
1-11 (EFRH)26 in AV-1959R

and AV-1953R and Tau2-18 (PRQEF; paper in preparation) in AV1980R and AV-1953R (Fig. 6). The modeling 
data suggested that on AV-1980R, two of three tau epitopes are linear with the side chains of the critical amino 
acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6a,d), while in AV-1959R, all three Aβ 
 epitopes are linear with the 
side chains of the critical amino acid residues accessible on the surface (Fig. 6b,e). On AV-1953R, two out of three 
Aβ 
 and two out of three tau epitopes are linear, however, only side chains of Aβ 
, but not critical tau amino acid 
residues are easily accessible (Fig. 6c,f). Hence, changes in the epitope structure in combination with alterations 
in the side chain accessibility of critical residues in the epitopes may have led to the reduced anti-tau immuno-
genicity of the AV-1953R dual-epitope construct.
Immune sera recognize various pathological forms of Aβ and tau molecules in AD brains. 
To 
demonstrate the effectiveness of antibodies generated in mice immunized with single vaccines, AV-1959R or 
AV-1980R, the mixture of two vaccines (AV-1959R/AV-1980R) or dual vaccine (AV-1953R), we analyzed the 
binding of immune sera to various pathological forms of Aβ 
 and Tau in brain tissues from four different AD cases 
by Western Blot (WB) (Fig. 7a,b) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Fig. 7c).
The AV-1959R-immune sera bound monomeric Aβ 
 in soluble as well as low and high molecular weight oli-
gomers in both soluble and insoluble fractions of brain homogenates. As expected, AV-1980R-immune sera 
recognized monomeric tau as well as multiple larger and smaller species of tau in both soluble and insoluble 
fractions of brain homogenates. What is more important, antibodies generated by either the mixture of vaccines 
(AV-1959R/AV-1980R) or the dual vaccine (AV-1953R) recognized the same species of Aβ 
 and tau that were 
detected by antisera isolated from mice vaccinated with appropriate single vaccines (AV-1959R and AV-1980R). 
Similar results have been obtained by IHC analyses of the same brain tissues (Fig. 7c). AV-1959R-immune sera 
bound senile plaques only, AV-1980R-immunie sera bound NFTs and neuritic threads, yet sera from mice immu-
nized with AV-1959R/AV-1980R mixture or AV-1953R bound both pathologies: plaques, neuritic threads and 
NFTs. Therefore, both mixture of MultiTEP-platform based vaccines and the dual vaccine could be an effective 
active immunotherapeutic strategy for targeting both misfolded proteins involved in AD pathology.

Cross synergism in MultiTEP-based vaccines targeting different antigens. 
All the above vaccines 
are based on our universal MultiTEP vaccine platform that is based on a string of Th foreign epitopes which, as 
shown in monkeys, can stimulate immune responses in a broad population of subjects with high MHC class II 
gene polymorphisms10. Notably, the universal MultiTEP platform may allow using two vaccines targeting Aβ 
 and 
tau at early and late stages of the disease, respectively. At the initiation of anti-tau immunotherapy AD patient 
immunized previously with anti-Aβ 
 vaccine would have large numbers of MultiTEP-specific memory Th cells 
and hence will rapidly generate therapeutic concentrations of antibodies. To simulate this situation, we immu-
nized mice with AV-1959R formulated in AdvaxCpG or injected with AdvaxCpG only (control) and both groups 
were boosted with vaccine targeting tau B cell epitope, AV-1980R. Boosting of AV-1959R vaccinated mice with 
AV-1980R, but not sham-injected mice, induced significantly higher cellular (Fig. 8a) and humoral (Fig. 8b) 
immune responses, thus proving the synergistic effect of sequential immunization with different MultiTEP 
vaccines.

Discussion
AD is the most common cause of dementia, and worldwide nearly 46 million people have Alzheimer’s or related 
dementias and this number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 205027. Currently, the majority of neu-
roscientists agree that the optimal targets for AD immunotherapy are pathological forms of Aβ 
 and tau. The 
relationship between these molecules in progression of AD pathology is still controversial, with the majority of 
data supporting Aβ 
 aggregation being the primary event in AD pathogenesis, secondarily triggering production 
of pathological tau28–33. Nonetheless, accumulation of pathological tau in the brains correlates with dementia 
in AD patients. Thus, by the time clinical symptoms appear, there is already substantial tau pathology in the 
brains34,35. Therefore, we propose that anti-Aβ 
 immunotherapy should be initiated at the early stages of AD to 
Figure 3. Cellular immune responses in mice immunized with epitope vaccines targeting Aβ (AV-1959R), 
tau (AV-1980R), and Aβ/tau (dual-epitope vaccine: AV-1953R or mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R). 
Numbers of IFN-γ (a) and IL-4 (b) producing T cells were calculated by ELISpot in splenocyte cultures obtained 
from experimental and control animals. (c) Proliferation of cells was detected by [3H]-thymidine incorporation 
assay in the same splenocyte cultures and expressed as stimulation index. Cellular immune responses in control 
group were at the background level (INF-γ

1.6). Bars

minimize synaptic and neuronal loss, while anti-tau immunotherapy may be most effective when disease pro-
gression is more advanced33. Thus we have decided to generate vaccines that will target pathological molecules 
either sequentially (e.g. Aβ 
 vaccinations followed by tau vaccination) or simultaneously (mixture of Aβ 
 plus tau 
vaccines, or dual-epitope vaccine containing both Aβ 
 and tau B cell epitopes). Importantly, although clinical data 
from anti-tau immunotherapy are not currently available, results from anti-Aβ 
 active and passive vaccination 
trials suggest that only relatively high concentrations of antibodies are therapeutically potent9,30–33,36. Therefore, 
to enhance immune response in elderly patients with immunosenescence37 we have developed recombinant 
protein-based Aβ 
 and tau, or dual-epitope vaccines by fusing relevant epitopes of these pathological proteins with 
our MultiTEP platform which is composed of 12 foreign Th cell epitopes, which are the promiscuous PADRE 
epitope, epitopes from Tetanus Toxin (P23, P32, P21, P30, P2, P7, P17 and P28), Hepatitis B (HBVnc & HBsAg), 
and influenza virus (MT)10. We hypothesized that this should provide a broad coverage of human MHC class II 
polymorphism utilizing the wide array of tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza Th epitopes incorporated into 
the MultiTEP platform. We have previously shown that MultiTEP platform-based DNA vaccine targeting Aβ 
1-11 
was immunogenic in mice, rabbits, and in monkeys with highly polymorphic MHC class II genes10–13. Here we 
further suggested that the same MultiTEP platform used for two different recombinant protein-based vaccines 
targeting Aβ and tau could be beneficial because Th cells activated by AV-1959R will generate strong Th memory 
cells and will facilitate rapid production of anti-tau antibodies in the future vaccination/s of the same organism 
with the anti-tau vaccine, AV-1980R. In this study we report for the first time on the immunogenicity of vaccines 
targeting Aβ 
, tau or both pathological molecules simultaneously or sequentially.
It is well known that to be immunogenic any recombinant protein should be formulated in a potent adjuvant. 
In the AN-1792 trials a substantial portion of vaccinated subjects were non-responders, even though the strong 
QS21 adjuvant was used31,38. Thus, the first aim of this study was to identify an optimal adjuvant for use in future 
AD vaccine trials. Figures 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that AdvaxCpG formulated with AV-1959R vaccine provided 
significantly higher Th cell and anti-Aβ 
 antibody responses than any other adjuvant approved for human use or 
tested in clinical trials. Moreover, AdvaxCpG enhanced both Th2 and Th1 immune responses as reflected by the 
highest induction of not only IgG1, but also IgG2ab antibody isotype. Antibodies of the IgG2ab isotype exhibit 
the highest level of Fc effector function, which may provide the utmost efficiency in AD immunotherapy39, and 
the acute pro-inflammatory responses (IFN-γ 
+SFC) generated by AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG could be 
beneficial for AD treatment as well, since TLR4 agonist MPLA reduced Aβ 
 load in the brain of mice and enhanced 
cognitive function40. Finally, MultiTEP-based vaccine design is anticipated to be safe, because Th epitopes in this 
platform are all foreign and are not expressed in the brain.
While this is the first report of AdvaxCpG being used for enhancement of the immune response against a 
 
B cell self-epitope fused with MultiTEP, the potency of this adjuvant has been previously demonstrated for 
vaccines targeting viral and bacterial antigens18. Importantly, a pandemic influenza vaccine formulated with 
Advax™ 
 was effective in human subjects up to 90 years of age, enhancing anti-influenza plasmablast and antibody

and anti-tau (b) antibodies were measured by ELISA in sera collected after the 3rd immunization and calculated 
using calibration curves generated with 6E10 and 1C9 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Lines represent 
mean values for n = 8/per group (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ANOVA test).

responses across the whole age spectrum24. The ability of this delta-inulin based adjuvant to help counter the nor-
mal age-related decline in plasmablast and antibody responses to influenza immunization is likely to be impor-
tant for human AD vaccine development, as these will principally need to be administered to elderly subjects with 
immuno-senescence34.
As mentioned above, the difference in the timing of Aβ 
 and tau accumulation34 and their different roles 
in the onset and progression of AD, suggest that sequential vaccinations with Aβ 
 and tau vaccines, or even 
combined vaccine against both molecules might represent the most effective AD approach. In particular, the 
same vaccine platform could be used to both prevent the onset of AD41–44, and also slow down development of 
tauopathy-associated dementia32,45–51. In order to utilize such an approach we have developed three MultiTEP 
platform-based vaccines targeting Aβ 
, tau or both molecules simultaneously. All MultiTEP-based vaccines for-
mulated with AdvaxCpG induce strong cellular and humoral (concentrations of antibody and numbers of ASC) 
immune responses (Figs 4 and 5). Co-immunizations with AV-1959R and AV-1980R vaccines provided high 
antibody titers against Aβ 
 and tau epitopes, respectively and these humoral immune responses did not differ 
from results of immunization with single AV-1980R or AV-1959R vaccines. However, the AV-1953R dual vac-
cine demonstrated significantly decreased anti-tau humoral immune responses compared with mice immunized 
with AV-1980R or a mixture of AV-1980R and AV-1959R vaccines (Figs 4 and 5). These decreases in antibody 
titers and numbers of ASC were not associated with insufficient Th cell stimulation by AV-1953R vs AV-1980R/
AV-1959R, since the Th cell responses did not differ significantly between these groups (Fig. 3). This suggested 
that the three copies of tau2-18 B cell epitope in the MultiTEP vaccine might not be adequately presented on the 
surface of the folded AV-1953R or AV-1980R protein. In the absence of crystal structures, we performed an 
 
in silico approach to create structural models of the MultiTEP-based proteins that were further optimized using 
Figure 5. Number of B cells producing anti-Aβ and anti-Tau antibodies in mice vaccinated with AV-
1959R, AV-1980R, AV-1953R and mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R formulated with AdvaxCpG 
adjuvant. Detection of anti-Aβ (a) and anti-tau (b) antibody-secreting cells (ASC), visualized as spots, was 
done in splenocyte cultures obtained from experimental and control mice using ELISpot assay. Bars represent 
average ± SD (n = 8/per group, *P < 0.05, ANOVA test).

molecular dynamic simulation. From the 3D in silico models of these vaccines it appears that tau2-18 epitopes 
may have a less optimal presentation on the surface of AV-1953R dual vaccine than on the AV-1980R single one 
(Fig. 6). These subtle differences in the structural configuration may have played a critical role in the observed 
differences in the antibody titers and ASC numbers. Another possible reason could be B cell immunodominance 
of the Aβ 
 epitope which may suppress the maturation of tau-specific B cells by competition for antigen-specific 
Th cells. However, this was not the case when immunization was performed with a mixture of the two vaccines 
containing the same Th epitopes (Fig. 5). In addition, we have performed experiments with increased doses of 
AV-1953R and did not see an increase of anti-tau antibody concentrations too (data not shown).
Regardless of the exact cause for the varying immunogenicity seen with the different MultiTEP-based tau 
vaccines it is clear that AV-1980R vaccine was more immunogenic than dual-epitope vaccine, AV-1953R, and 
therefore, it could be used for AD therapy following preventive vaccinations with AV-1959R. Mice primed by 
AV-1959R responded significantly better to the booster vaccination with AV-1980R (Fig. 8a,b). Importantly, 
regardless of the vaccine used (single, mixture or dual), the generated antibodies are potentially functional and 
bind equally well to the pathological deposits of Aβ 
 and tau in the brain sections from four AD cases (Fig. 7). It 
is important to note, that antibodies were effectively binding oligomeric forms of Aβ 
 and tau, which are widely 
believed to be much more toxic than the fibrils and plaques52.
These data may open a new avenue for future vaccination regimens, as the preventive AV-1959R could be used 
in prodromal AD subjects and then, in case of subsequent disease progression, boosting could be performed with 
the AV-1980R vaccine. Hence, using AV-1959R as a preventive vaccine, and then adding AV-1980R after onset of 
AD may provide the broadest protection across the AD clinical disease spectra.
In summary, optimal AD vaccine formulation, adjuvant selection and targeting of the right epitopes at the 
appropriate stage of disease will be crucial to a successful immunotherapeutic approach. An AD vaccine based 
on target epitopes attached to universal, highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform when combined with 
AdvaxCpG, a potent yet well tolerated adjuvant suitable for human use, induced extremely high antibody titers 
against both Aβ 
 and tau, at levels not previously achieved in other studies. The MultiTEP strategy provides a 
unique opportunity to generate high antibody responses in subjects by utilizing memory Th cells previously gen-
erated in the human population in response to infection or vaccination by tetanus toxin, hepatitis B and influenza. 
The MultiTEP platform may be especially beneficial in the elderly because the vaccine utilizes memory T cells 
that are in abundance in elderly patients instead of relying on activation of naïve T cells, which decline with age. 
Therefore, the universal and highly immunogenic MultiTEP vaccine platform shows promise for both preventive 
and therapeutic approaches in AD.
Methods
Mice. 
Female, 6–8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (H-2b haplotype) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. All 
animals were housed in a temperature and light-cycle controlled facility, and their care was under the guidelines 
of the NIH and an approved IACUC protocol at UC Irvine. Animal experiments were performed according to

Epitope vaccines. 
To prepare three recombinant proteins, minigenes encoding 3Aβ 
1-11-MultiTEP, 3Tau2-18- 
MultiTEP or 3Aβ 
1-11-MultiTEP-3Tau2-18 were cloned into the modified E. coli expression vector pET11 (for 
AV-1959R; Novagen, MA) or pET24a (for AV-1980R and AV-1953R; Novagen, MA) in frame with 6xHis-Tag at 
the C-terminus. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the generated plasmids contained the correct 
sequences.

Purification of proteins. 
Recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed 
with pET11/3Aβ 
1-11-MultiTEP, pET24a/3Tau2-18-MultiTEP or pET24a/3Aβ 
1-11-MultiTEP-3Tau2-18 plasmids as 
described13,53. The final recombinant protein was analyzed in 10% Bis-Tris gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE Novex 
Gel, Invitrogen, CA). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie dye (Fig. S2a) and specificity of the bands was 
confirmed by Western Blot (WB) using 6E10 (Fig. S2b) and anti-tau2-18 1C9 (Fig. S2c) monoclonal antibodies. 
The level of endotoxin was measured using E-TOXATE kits, as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma, St 
Louis, MO).
Experimental protocols. 
Study 1. Selection of an optimal adjuvant. Seven groups of C57BL/6 mice 
(n = 
 5–8) were immunized with 20 μ 
g of AV-1959R (pET11/3Aβ 
1-11-MultiTEP) formulated with a selection of 
adjuvants: Montanide-ISA51 (s.c.; 50/50 ratio; SEPPIC, France), Montanide-ISA720 (s.c.; 50/50 ratio; SEPPIC, 
France), MPLA-SM (s.c.; 10 μ 
g; Enzo, NY), Alhydrogel® (s.c.; 70 μ 
g; BRENNTAG, Denmark), Quil-A (s.c.; 20 μ 
g; 
BRENNTAG, Denmark), Advax™ 
, and AdvaxCpG (both i.m.; 1mg; Vaxine Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia). All mice 
were injected four times at biweekly intervals. Sera were collected 14 days after the third immunization and were 
used to measure anti-Aβ 
 antibody responses. On day 7 after the last injection mice were terminated and cellular 
immune responses were analyzed in splenocytes.
Study 2. Efficacy of different AD vaccines. Four groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 
 8 per group) were immunized with 
AV-1959R (20 μ 
g/per mouse/per injection), AV-1980R (pET24a/3Tau2-18-MultiTEP, 20 μ 
g/per mouse/per injec-
tion), AV-1953R (pET24a/3Aβ 
1-11-MultiTEP-3Tau2-18, 20 μ 
g/per mouse/per injection) and mixture of AV-1959R 
and AV-1980R proteins (20 μ 
g protein/mouse/injection), all formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant (1 mg/mouse/
injection). Control groups of mice were injected with AdvaxCpG adjuvant only or PBS (n = 6 for both groups). All 
mice were injected four times at biweekly intervals. Sera were collected 14 days after third immunizations and 
anti-Aβ 
 and anti-tau antibody responses were analyzed. On day 7 after the last injection mice were terminated 
and cellular immune responses were analyzed in splenocytes.
Study 3. Cross synergism in MultiTEP-based vaccines. We studied the effect of switching from AV-1959R to 
AV-1980R. Two groups of mice (n = 
 14) were immunized twice with AV-1959R formulated with AdvaxCpG or 
injected with AdvaxCpG only. Then both groups received a single vaccination with AV-1980R formulated with 
AdvaxCpG. Four mice from each group were terminated at day 7 after the third injection and T cell responses were 
measured in splenocytes. The remaining mice (n = 
 10 per group) were bled at day 14 after immunization for 
measurement of serum antibody responses.
Detection of Aβ- and tau-specific antibodies. 
The concentrations of anti-Aβ 
 and anti-tau antibodies in 
serum were determined by ELISA, as described previously11,53,54. Anti-Aβ 
 and anti-tau antibody concentrations 
were calculated using a calibration curve generated with 6E10 (Covance, CA) and 1C9 mAbs (generated at the 
Institute for Molecular Medicine, Huntington Beach, CA), respectively. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, ME) was used as secondary antibody. HRP-conjugated anti-IgG1, IgG2ab, IgG2b 
and IgM specific antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) were used to characterize the isotype profiles of anti-Aβ 
antibodies in individual sera at different dilutions (see legend of Fig. S1).
Proliferation of splenocytes and detection of splenocytes producing IFN-γ and IL-4. 
Analysis of 
IFN-γ 
 and IL-4 producing T cells was performed in splenocyte cultures from immunized mice by ELISpot assay 
(BD Biosciences, CA), as previously described10,44,55,56. Cultures of splenocytes were re-stimulated in vitro with a 
cocktail of 12 peptides representing the Th epitopes in the MultiTEP vaccine10 (2 μ 
g/ml of each peptide), soluble 
Aβ 
40, tau2-18 or irrelevant peptides at 10 μ 
g/ml for 20 hours. The numbers of SFC per 106 splenocytes stimulated 
with Th peptides or Aβ 
40 or tau2-18, were then counted.
T cell proliferation assay was performed in splenocyte cultures using a [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay, 
as previously described53,57. The cultures of splenocytes from mice were re-stimulated in vitro with the same 
Figure 8. Humoral and cellular immune responses in mice vaccinated twice with AV-1959R and boosted 
(single boost) with AV-1980R formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant. (a) Numbers of IFN-γ producing cells were 
 
detected by ELISpot in splenocyte cultures. Bars represent average ± 
 SD for n = 4/per group. (b) Concentrations 
 
of anti-tau antibodies were measured by ELISA. Lines represent mean values for n = 10/per group (*P < 0.05, 
**P < 0.01, t-test).

antigens that were used in ELISpot assay. Stimulation index (SI) was calculated for each mouse using the formula: 
SI = experimental count/spontaneous count, where spontaneous count wells included irrelevant peptide.
Detection of B cells producing Aβ- and tau-specific antibodies. 
Antibody-secreting B cells (ASC) 
specific to Aβ 
 and tau were detected in splenocytes by ELISpot (Mabtech Inc, Cincinnati, OH). Splenocytes from 
experimental and control mice were incubated for 24 hours in 96-well plates coated with Aβ 
42 or tau2-18 peptides. 
After incubation the assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Mabtech Inc, Cincinnati, OH).
Preparation of brain homogenates and western blot analysis. 
Soluble and insoluble fractions. 0.2 g 
of brain tissue from four different AD cases were homogenized in 0.4 ml TBS buffer with Halt™ 
 Protease and 
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (100X, Thermo Scientific, CA), then centrifuged at 6400xg for 15 minutes at 
 
+ 
4 °C. Supernatants were collected and stored at − 
80 °C for further analysis as soluble fractions. Remaining 
pellets were solubilized in 70% formic acid (FA) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 hr at + 
4 °C. Avoiding upper 
lipid layer, the lower aqueous layer was collected and stored at − 
70 °C for later quantification of insoluble Aβ and 
tau levels. Prior to the next step FA fractions were neutralized with 5N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) following a 
neutralization buffer (1 M TRIS Base, 0.5 M NaH2PO4) and precipitated with ice cold 10% Trichloroacetic acid 
(TCA) in acetone. Then precipitated fractions were resolubilized in equal volume of TBS. Protein concentration 
was determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, IL) and samples were adjusted to the equal concentration.
Western Blots. WB with soluble and insoluble fractions of four brain homogenates were performed as described 
in10,44,55,56. Briefly, soluble and insoluble fractions applied to electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel in 
MES buffer under reducing conditions (Invitrogen, CA) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane 
(GE Healthcare, NJ). For antigen retrieval, membranes with soluble fractions were boiled in PBS at 100 °C as 
described in Rosen et al.58 and then were blocked with 5% fat-free dry milk. Membranes with insoluble fractions 
were blocked without antigen retrieval. Aβ 
 and tau were visualized by incubating with sera from mice immunized 
with AV-1959R, AV-1980R, AV-1953R or mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R followed by HRP-conjugated 
anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Sera were used after normalization of antibody concentration 
measured by ELISA (1 μ 
g/ml for anti-Aβ and 0.4 μ 
g/ml for anti-tau).
Detection of Aβ plaques and tau tangles in human brain tissues by IHC. 
Sera from mice immu-
nized with AV-1959R, AV-1980R, AV-1953R and mixture of AV-1959R and AV-1980R were screened for the abil-
ity to bind to human Aβ 
 plaques or/and tau tangles using 40 μ 
m brain sections of formalin-fixed cortical tissues 
from four different severe AD cases (received from Brain Bank and Tissue Repository, MIND, UC Irvine) using 
immunohistochemistry as described previously10,44,55,56. A digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to 
capture images of the plaques at 60× magnification.
Construction of molecular models. 
Sequences corresponding to each individual epitope within each 
MultiTEP protein (AV-1980R, AV-1959R AV-1953R) were submitted to the PSIPRED protein structure predic-
tion server59 for folding profile based threading. Those template structures matching the folding pattern of the 
query with < 
= 
0.0001 p-value were selected (The individual templates used and the appropriate references are 
provided in Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Based on the multiple sequence alignment between the query and 
the templates, homology models were generated using the homology modeling program Modeller v9.13 
60. Then 
each homology model was evaluated, refined and selected based on the discrete optimized protein energy score 
(DOPES). Then models were relaxed using the molecular dynamics simulation program NAMD v2.9 
61 for 1000 
steps at 310 K temperature. Finally, models of the synthetic MultiTEP proteins containing Aβ 
1-11 or tau2-8 epitopes 
and the combination were visualized using the molecular modeling program UCSF chimera62.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical parameters (mean, standard deviation (SD), significant difference, etc.) were 
calculated using the Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistically significant differ-
ences were examined using a t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-test 
 
(a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant).
