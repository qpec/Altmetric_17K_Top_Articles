abstract
OBJECTIVES: Examined patterns and determinants of objectively measured moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) over 4 years in US emerging adults.
METHODS: Waves 1 through 4 (W1 [10th grade] to W4 data of a national cohort starting 
in 2010 (N = 561; 16.19 ± 0.51 years) were used. MVPA was assessed annually 
from accelerometers; BMI calculated from measured height/weight; and surveys 
ascertained self-reported physical activity (PA) planning, peer PA , family support, W1 
sociodemographics, W4 school status, W4 residence, and W4 employment. Latent growth 
modeling estimated trajectories in log-transformed duration (minutes/day) of MVPA and 
associations with covariates.
RESULTS: Less than 9% of participants met the recommended 60+ minutes/day MVPA across 
W1 through W4. W1 MVPA was greater in males versus females (B = 0.46, P < .001) and 
Hispanic versus White (B = 0.34, P < .001) participants. Increased BMI change (W1 to W4 
slope) was associated with decreased MVPA. MVPA was positively associated with PA 
planning (W1–W3: B = 0.10, B = 0.06, B = 0.08, Ps < .05), but not with peer PA or family 
support. Participants attending 4-year college versus not-attending school (B = 0.52, P < 
.001), and college students living on campus versus at home (B = 0.37, P < .001) were more 
likely to engage in MVPA at W4. Weekend MVPA remained relatively constant from W1 
through W4.
CONCLUSIONS: High-school students engaged in little MVPA and maintained this low level 
through the transition to adulthood. Emerging adults’ MVPA engagement may vary 
according to social contexts. Those with high BMI may benefit most from interventions to 
promote MVPA.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Habitual physical 
activity has numerous acute and long-term health 
benefi
 ts. Trajectories of objectively measured 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) have 
been conducted for children but few for adolescents 
transitioning to adulthood.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: High school students 
engaged in little MVPA (<9% met the ≥60 minutes/
day recommendation) and maintained it through 
the transition to adulthood. Emerging adults’ MVPA 
varies by social context. Those with high BMI may 
benefi
 t most from interventions to promote MVPA.

Regular exercise and physical 
activity (PA) have numerous acute 
and long-term health benefits, 
including reduced risk of obesity, 
metabolic syndrome, and improved 
mental well-being in children and 
adolescents. 
1, 
 
2 The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
recommend a minimum of 60 
minutes of moderate-to-vigorous 
PA (MVPA) per day for maintenance 
of general health. 
3 The literature 
suggests that a large number of youth 
fail to meet the physical activity 
guidelines and engage in less physical 
activity as they transition through 
adolescence to early adulthood. 
4 
– 
7 
However, questions remain about 
longitudinal patterns and predictors 
of PA because of study limitations 
such as cross-sectional design, 
 
4 self-
reported data, 
 
5 and lack of data in 
older youth (ie, ≥16 years).6
Although a number of studies 
have reported the prevalence of 
adolescents who met the 60 minutes 
per day PA recommendation using 
self-reported measures, 
 
7 
 
– 
10 few 
studies have reported the prevalence 
based on objectively measured 
PA or examined the change in 
objectively measured PA during late 
adolescence. In a rare longitudinal 
study using accelerometers, Nader 
and colleagues6 reported MVPA 
from children (age 9 years) to 
early adolescence (age 15 years) 
using a US national sample from 
10 geographic locations. In this 
study, the researchers reported a 
significant negative trajectory for 
children’s MVPA between ages 9 to 
15. The percentages of children who 
did not meet the 60 minutes per 
day recommended MVPA increased 
sharply on both weekday (0.4% 
at age 9 to 69.4% at age 15) and 
weekend (2.3% at age 9 to 83.2% at 
age 15). However, no similar studies 
have been conducted on trajectories 
in emerging adults (subjects 
transitioning from adolescence to 
adulthood).
Some evidence suggests that 
certain psychosocial and social-
contextual variables, such as peer 
influence, family support, and 
action planning 
10 
– 
12 are positively 
associated with levels of PA in 
high school. Only a few studies 
have examined the association 
of longitudinal changes 
13 and 
trajectories14 of PA with their 
temporal and prospective predictors. 
In addition, to our knowledge, 
no studies have investigated 
the association between MVPA 
and environmental status after 
transitioning out of high school.
Overall, the purposes of this study 
were to examine the patterns 
and determinants of objectively 
measured MVPA of a national 
cohort US youth over 4 years from 
10th grade to post–high school and 
estimate the association between 
post–high school MVPA and school 
attendance, employment and 
residence (ie, parental home, college 
campus, or on their own).
METHODS
Sampling
The NEXT Generation Health Study 
recruited a nationally representative 
cohort of 10th-grade students at 
wave 1 (W1) from 81 public, private, 
and parochial schools in the United 
States using a multistage sampling 
design stratified by nine census 
divisions. Systematic sampling 
was used to identify a subsample 
(“NEXT Plus”) of approximately 
equal number of normal-weight 
(5th–85th percentile, N = 289) and 
overweight (≥85th percentile, 
N = 272) participants in 44 schools 
representing urban, suburban, and 
rural communities in each census 
division at W1 to participate in 
additional assessments and comprise 
the sample for the current study. 
Weight status was determined 
from measured height and weight 
using age- and sex-adjusted BMI 
percentiles. 
15 Parental consent and 
adolescent assent to participate 
were obtained for participation in 
NEXT and separately for NEXT Plus. 
Participants provided consent upon 
turning 18 years of age. Incentives 
($40 gift card at each wave) were 
provided for participation in 
assessment procedures. The study 
protocol was reviewed and approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of 
the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National 
Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development.
Assessments of Physical Activity 
(Outcome Variable)
Participants wore an ActiGraph 
GT3 X accelerometer on their right 
hip during waking hours to provide 
an objective measure of duration 
and intensity of PA. Participants 
were asked to wear the devices for 
7 consecutive days for ≥10 hours 
per day. Because accelerometers 
were not waterproof, participants 
were instructed to remove the 
devices while swimming or bathing. 
Participants were asked to repeat the 
protocol if the devices were damaged 
or failed to collect or download 
data, had <5 days of data, or did 
not include a weekend day. Wear 
time was determined by subtracting 
nonwear time (≥60 consecutive 
minutes of zero counts) from 24 
hours. Participants with ≥4 days 
(including at least 1 weekend day) of 
monitoring data, for ≥500 minutes 
per day, were considered compliant 
and included in analyses.
Using the standard ActiLife analysis 
software, 
 
16 vertical acceleration, 
recorded as counts per 30-second 
epoch, was converted into MVPA 
using age-appropriate cut points 
(MVPA: ≥2296) developed by 
Evenson et al 
17 and recommended as 
an accurate estimation of PA among 
youth in a methods trial. 
18 To be 
included in analyses, minimum bout 
length was set at 10 minutes for 
MVPA.

Time Varying Covariates
PA planning (W1–W4) was measured 
by using 3 previously validated 
items. 
19 Participants were asked how 
often in the past 7 days they planned 
for when, how often, and where they 
would exercise (from 1 = not at all to 
5 = very often). The mean score of the 
3 items was calculated at each wave. 
Cronbach’s α internal consistency 
coefficients of this scale were 0.90, 
0.93, 0.94, and 0.94 for W1 to W4, 
respectively.
Peer physical activity (W1–W4) 
was measured with 1 item, which 
asked participants how often their 5 
closest friends engaged in vigorous 
PA at least 3 times per week (from 
1 = never to 5 = almost always). The 
question was developed for this 
study.
Parental support of daily PA (W1–
W4) was derived from the National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health 
20 and 
asked participants how important 
it was to their parents/guardians 
that he or she get daily PA and/or 
exercise (from 1 = not at all to 7 = 
extremely).
Time-Invariant Covariates
BMI difference was calculated as 
W4 – W1 BMI. Positive difference 
indicates weight gain, whereas 
negative difference indicates weight 
loss.
Participants reported residential 
status (parent/guardian’s home, 
own place, and on campus), school 
attendance (not in school, attending 
technical/community college, 
and attending university/college) 
and employment (not working, 
part-time work <30 hours/week, 
and full-time work ≥30 hours/
week).
The sociodemographic variables 
included sex, race/ethnicity, family 
socioeconomic status, urbanicity, 
and parent education. Family 
socioeconomic status was estimated 
by using the Family Affluence Scale 
21 
and categorized as low, moderate, 
or high affluence. 
22 Urbanicity was 
categorized into 2 groups based 
on location of their school at W1 
in an urban or rural neighborhood 
community. 
23 Parents reported 
educational attainment during the 
consent process (less than high 
school diploma, high school diploma/
GED, some college/technical school/
advanced degree, or a bachelors/
graduate degree).
Statistical Analysis
This longitudinal analysis examined 
data from W1 (10th grade) through 
W4 (first year after high school). 
Thirty-nine participants (8% of 561 
participants) with incomplete or 
missing data for PA were excluded 
from analyses. The final analytic 
sample included 522 participants at 
W1. A linear growth model (LGM) 
for a continuous outcome with 
time-invariant and time-varying 
covariates was conducted by using 
Mplus 7.31 and all other statistical 
analyses were conducted by using 
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Log-
transformed duration (minutes/day) 
of MVPA was used.
In statistical terms, the 2-level 
hierarchical linear models are 
represented by a level 1 (repeated 
measures [waves] level) and a level 2 
(personal level) regression model as 
follows:
Level 1 model:

where Y is the MVPA; π0i is the MVPA 
for participant i at W1; π1i and π2i 
are the growth rates of MVPA as a 
function of Time (linear) and Time × 
Time (quadratic) for person i over 
the 4 waves, respectively; and the εij 
is the level 1 residuals.

where γ00 is the mean value of the 
level 1 dependent variable; γ10 and 
γ20 are the mean slope of Time and 
Time × Time, respectively; γ01, γ11, 
and γ21 are the fixed effects; and ζ0i, ζ1i, 
and ζ2i are the random effects.
Hox procedure 
24 and Singer and 
Willett’s taxonomy 
25 were used for 
a multilevel analysis of longitudinal 
data. First, the null or unconditional 
means model was estimated 
containing the intercept term only. 
Second, the unconditional linear 
growth model (the predictor Time 
was included) was tested; and then 
the unconditional quadratic growth 
model was examined by adding 
the Time × Time term. Then time-
invariant covariates were entered 
into the growth models (intercept 
and slopes submodels). Finally, time-
varying covariates were included in 
the models.
RESULTS
Descriptive Information
 
Figure 1 and  
Table 1 show the 
distribution of mean duration 
(minutes) of monitored MVPA on 
weekdays and weekends, which 
indicates that <9% of the participants 
met the recommended ≥60 minutes/
day at all waves on weekdays and 
weekends. Descriptive information 
of sociodemographic variables is 
presented in Supplemental Table 4. 
Those variables were included in 
the multilevel models as control 
variables and the interactions 
between sociodemographic variables 
and linear (Time) and quadratic 
(Time × Time) slopes were tested.
Across all years, participants 
consistently engaged in significantly 
more daily MVPA on weekdays (27–
29 minutes/day,  
Table 2) than on 
weekends (19–21 minutes/day; all 
Ps < .001,  
Table 2). Male participants 
(25–36 minutes/per day) were 
more active than their female 
counterparts (13–23 minutes/day) 
on both weekdays and weekends (all

Ps < .001,  
Table 2). Normal weight 
participants were significantly more 
active than overweight participants 
on weekdays at W4 (30 vs 26 
minutes/day, P < .05,  
Table 2) and 
weekends at W1 (22 vs 18 minutes/
day, P < .05, Table 2). When MVPA 
was examined as a 4-year average, 
these differences were maintained, 
including the significant difference 
in activity levels between normal 
weight and overweight participants 
 
Table 2.
Variability in Weekday PA
The results ( 
Table 3) of the LGM 
shows that on weekdays the 
quadratic model was identified as the 
best fit model (linear slope of time 
B = 0.46, P < .001; quadratic slope 
of time B = –0.20, P < .001). Sex (B = 
0.46) and race/ethnicity (Hispanic vs 
White B = 0.34), but not W1 weight 
status, were associated with W1 
MVPA (P < .001). W4 to W1 BMI 
change was negatively associated 
with linear slope of time (B = –0.02, 
P < .01), indicating increased BMI 
from W1 to W4 was associated with 
decreased MVPA.
W1 to W3 PA planning was positively 
associated with W1 to W3 MVPA 
(W1: B = 0.10, P < .01; W2: B = 
0.06, P < .05; W3: B = 0.08, P < 
.001). Peer PA and family support 
were not associated with MVPA in 
corresponding waves.
Additionally, those attending 4-year 
college versus not attending school 
(B = 0.52, P < .001), and participants 
living on campus versus at home 
(B = 0.37, P < .001) were more likely 
to engage in MVPA at W4 compared 
with those who were not attending 
college and those who lived at home, 
indicating that attending college and 
living on campus were associated 
with increased MVPA post high 
school (see  
Figure 2). Working status 
was not found to be significantly 
associated with MVPA engagement in 
the year after high school (data not 
showed).

Variability in Weekend PA
On weekends, a dynamic pattern 
of MVPA in terms of significant 
LGM time slopes was not identified, 
indicating that weekend W1 to 
W4 MVPA remained relatively 
constant.
DISCUSSION
In this study of a contemporary, 
national cohort of US adolescents 
followed from 10th grade for 4 years, 
duration of MVPA increased over the 
first year, but then steeply declined 
over the next 2 years. Longer 
duration of MVPA was observed on 
weekdays than on weekends and was 
inversely associated with BMI change 
over follow-up. Additionally, MVPA 
was greater among 4-year college 
students than those not attending 
school and among students living 
on campus as compared with those 
living on their own or at home.
Cross-sectional and longitudinal 
studies have documented that body 
weight status may be associated 
with engagement in PA among 
children and adolescents. 
1, 
 
26, 
 
27 
Therefore, we examined whether 
baseline weight status influenced 
the pattern of MVPA and whether 
changes in BMI influenced the 
pattern of MVPA among emerging 
adults. In our sample, weight status 
at W1 was not associated with the 
pattern of MVPA over the 4 waves, 
although increased BMI between 
W1 and W4 was associated with 
decreased MVPA. Our findings echo 
a recently published longitudinal 
study that showed that a greater 
decrease in sport participation was 
associated with a greater increase in 
BMI during the transition to higher 
education, indicating the transition 
is a risk period for weight gain 
and decreased PA engagement. 
28 
Moreover, Deforche and colleagues28 
recommended that intervention 
programs should consider individual, 
psychosocial, and environmental 
factors. In the current study, we

investigated the longitudinal 
association of PA engagement 
with individual covariates and 
cross-sectional association of PA 
engagement with covariates in the 
year after high school. Our findings 
are consistent with Deforche et 
al with respect to the importance 
of individual PA planning and the 
environment. That PA engagement 
decreased less among those who 
were attending 4-year college and 
living on campus compared with 
those not attending school and those 
living at home suggests that access 
to and proximity of PA facilities 
may influence college students’ 
engagement in PA. 
29,

Previous studies have reported 
differences in PA engagement 
according to sex and race/ethnicity, 
 
1, 
 
2 
such as a greater decline of PA in girls 
than in boys. 
4, 
 
6, 
10 In our research, 
without including time-varying 
covariates, sex was significantly 
associated with the linear slope 
of the trajectory of log MVPA (ie, 
MVPA over time increased for males 
compared with females). However, 
when controlling for time-varying 
covariates, such as PA planning and 
parent influences, our data indicate 
that male adolescents engaged in 
more MVPA compared with female 
adolescents in 10th grade (baseline) 
only, but sex did not influence the 
longitudinal curve. Thus, factors 
reflecting self-regulation or 
environment may influence MVPA 
engagement more than sex.
Consistent with previous findings 
among adolescents, 
 
31 MVPA was 
higher on weekdays than weekends 
in our sample. Also, the LGM 
modeling did not show a change 
across time in MVPA engagement 
on weekends, whereas change was 
found on weekdays. These findings 
may indicate that as adolescents 
transition into the first year after 
high school, their weekday schedules 
change in ways that reduce MVPA, 
such as increased school/work 
demands, whereas their weekends 
remain more consistent. Possibly, 
there may be more autonomy in 
arranging their weekday activities at 
adolescents’ age.
This study has several notable 
strengths, including objectively 
measured physical activity in a 
large, national, ethnically/racially 
diverse sample. Accelerometers 
are among the most valid and 
reliable assessment method of 
structured and unstructured 
movements. Another key strength 
is that this study included 
participants who take a range

of pathways after leaving school 
rather than the pathway only to 
higher education. In addition, 
this prospective research design 
enables investigation of the 
trajectory of MVPA and factors 
associated with variability of MVPA 
over time. Despite the strengths 
of the study several limitations 
should be considered. First, the 
sample is not strictly nationally 
representative, which may limit the 
generalization of the findings to 
some extent. However, the sample 
was systematically drawn from a 
nationally representative sample 
and included participants from 
urban, suburban, and rural areas 
from each US Census division. 
Second, covariates were self-
reported, which are susceptible 
to response bias (including social 
desirability) and estimation errors. 
Third, although we observed a 
statistically significant association 
among this young and healthy 
population, the actual difference 
in minutes of MVPA was small. 
It is unknown what magnitude 
of difference would affect health 
status. Given the limited amount of 
MVPA young adults reported, any 
increase in regular MVPA should 
be encouraged, although more 
evidence is needed to justify the 
link between small increases in 
PA and health outcomes. Finally, 
although this study is prospective, 
the observational study design 
nonetheless limits inferences 
regarding causality based on the 
observed associations.
In addition, we would like to 
point out the potential influence 
of the parameter settings when 
processing the accelerometer 
data. For example, we applied a 
minimum bout length of 10 minutes 
for MVPA in the current study. It 
may lead to a smaller amount of 
MVPA duration compared with 
using a shorter bout. 
32 However, 
we tried to follow the 10-minute 
bout recommended by the Physical 
Activity Guidelines for Americans 
3 
to ensure that our results are 
comparable to the results based on 
the recommendations.
The findings should also be 
considered in relation to those 
in our parallel analyses of self-
reported PA included in a separate 
manuscript. 
33 The analyses of the 
association of self-reported MVPA 
with environmental variables and 
time-varying covariates in the NEXT 
full sample found that compared 
with those attending 4-year colleges 
or living on campus, participants 
not attending school or attending 
community-college level schools, 
and living at home or in own place 
were more likely to meet MVPA 
recommendations (at least 60 
minutes per day over the past 7 
days). The inconsistencies between 
the 2 studies are likely attributable 
to the use of self-reported versus 
objectively measured physical 
activity. Differences between self-
reported and objectively measured 
PA, 
 
34, 
 
35 as well as self-reported 
and objectively measured 
sedentary activities, 
 
36 have been 
previously reported. Similarly, 
the proportion of engagement 
in MVPA for 60 minutes per day 
on at least 5 days a week was 
substantially higher in the NEXT 
full sample based on self-report 
(>34% at any wave) compared 
with objective measurement 
(<10% in the current study), 
indicating gross overestimation 
of PA that would be expected to 
introduce biased estimates of 
associations with covariates. The 
different proportions may also 
be due to the varying sampling 
strategies (random sampling for 
NEXT full sample and predefined 
normal weight and overweight 
participants for NEXT Plus sample). 
Supplemental Table 4 shows the 
sociodemographic difference 
between the full and the subsamples 
who wore the accelerometer. It is 
noted that the weighted percent 
(complex survey variables were 
applied in the full sample analysis)

and nonweighted percent are 
visually different, although not 
dramatically. The latter might 
not fully generalize to the full 
sample because of its nonrandom 
sampling design as mentioned in 
the first limitation. We believe 
that useful, but different, types of 
information can be obtained from 
each method. Nevertheless, more 
studies are needed to understand 
the discrepancies between 
self-reported and objectively 
measured PA.
CONCLUSIONS
High school students engaged in 
little MVPA and maintained this 
low level through the transition 
to adulthood. Emerging adults’ 
MVPA engagement varies by social 
contexts. Those with high BMI may 
benefit most from interventions to 
promote MVPA.
