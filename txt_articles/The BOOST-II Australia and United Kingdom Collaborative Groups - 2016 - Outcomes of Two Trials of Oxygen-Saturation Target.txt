BACKGROUND
The safest ranges of oxygen saturation in preterm infants have been the subject of 
debate.
METHODS
In two trials, conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom, infants born before 
28 weeks’ gestation were randomly assigned to either a lower (85 to 89%) or a higher 
(91 to 95%) oxygen-saturation range. During enrollment, the oximeters were revised to 
correct a calibration-algorithm artifact. The primary outcome was death or disability at 
a corrected gestational age of 2 years; this outcome was evaluated among infants whose 
oxygen saturation was measured with any study oximeter in the Australian trial and 
those whose oxygen saturation was measured with a revised oximeter in the U.K. trial.
RESULTS
After 1135 infants in Australia and 973 infants in the United Kingdom had been 
enrolled in the trial, an interim analysis showed increased mortality at a corrected 
gestational age of 36 weeks, and enrollment was stopped. Death or disability in the 
Australian trial (with all oximeters included) occurred in 247 of 549 infants (45.0%) 
in the lower-target group versus 217 of 545 infants (39.8%) in the higher-target group 
(adjusted relative risk, 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 1.27; P 
= 
0.10); death 
or disability in the U.K. trial (with only revised oximeters included) occurred in 185 
of 366 infants (50.5%) in the lower-target group versus 164 of 357 infants (45.9%) in 
the higher-target group (adjusted relative risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.24; P 
= 
0.15). In 
post hoc combined, unadjusted analyses that included all oximeters, death or dis-
ability occurred in 492 of 1022 infants (48.1%) in the lower-target group versus 437 
of 1013 infants (43.1%) in the higher-target group (relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01 to 
1.23; P 
= 
0.02), and death occurred in 222 of 1045 infants (21.2%) in the lower-target 
group versus 185 of 1045 infants (17.7%) in the higher-target group (relative risk, 
1.20; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.43; P 
= 
0.04). In the group in which revised oximeters were 
used, death or disability occurred in 287 of 580 infants (49.5%) in the lower-target 
group versus 248 of 563 infants (44.0%) in the higher-target group (relative risk, 1.12; 
95% CI, 0.99 to 1.27; P 
= 
0.07), and death occurred in 144 of 587 infants (24.5%) 
versus 99 of 586 infants (16.9%) (relative risk, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.82; P 
= 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
Use of an oxygen-saturation target range of 85 to 89% versus 91 to 95% resulted in 
nonsignificantly higher rates of death or disability at 2 years in each trial but in 
significantly increased risks of this combined outcome and of death alone in post hoc 
combined analyses. (Funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research

T
he determination of the range of 
oxygen saturation that minimizes the com-
peting risks of death, retinopathy of pre-
maturity, and later disability in preterm infants is 
important.1,2 The U.K. and Australian Benefits of 
Oxygen Saturation Targeting (BOOST)–II trials 
are two of five comparative effectiveness trials 
of the targeting of oxygen saturation in infants 
born before 28 weeks’ gestation.3-8 These trials, 
known collectively as the Neonatal Oxygen Pro-
spective Meta-analysis (NeOProM) Collaboration, 
were designed to compare the effects of a lower 
oxygen-saturation target range (85 to 89%) ver-
sus a higher target range (91 to 95%) on a pri-
mary outcome of death or major disability at 18 
to 24 months, with age corrected for prematurity.3
Observational data had suggested that target-
ing an oxygen saturation below 90% was associ-
ated with a lower risk of severe retinopathy, with 
no difference in the rate of cerebral palsy or 
survival,9 and that the long-accepted “physio-
logic” targets of oxygen saturation may be too 
high.2 The trials therefore aimed to evaluate the 
hypothesis that targeting an oxygen saturation 
of 85 to 89% versus 91 to 95% would reduce the 
incidence of severe retinopathy with no effects 
on mortality or disability.1
After the trials were initiated, the U.K. inves-
tigators found that Masimo Radical pulse oxime-
ters, which were widely used and were used in 
all NeOProM trials, had an artifact in their cali-
bration algorithm.10 Approximately a third fewer 
oxygen-saturation values between 87 and 90% 
were displayed than expected, and values above 
87% were shifted up by 1 to 2 percentage points. 
Masimo confirmed this artifact10 and provided 
revised software that removed it. The revised 
oximeters performed similarly to other common 
oximeters.10 After the Surfactant, Positive Pressure, 
and Oxygenation Randomized Trial (SUPPORT) 
showed increased mortality among infants in the 
lower-target group,4 the trial management com-
mittees closed recruitment to U.K. and Austra-
lian BOOST-II trials early, because their indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring committees 
informed them that a pooled safety analysis of 
the two trials showed a 65% greater relative risk 
of death at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age (weeks 
since the first day of the mother’s last normal 
menstrual period) among infants in the lower-
target group than among infants in the higher-
target group when revised oximeters were used 
(relative risk, 1.65; 99.73% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.09 to 2.49; risk difference, 8.5 percentage 
points; number needed to harm [i.e., the num-
ber of infants needed in the lower-target group 
for one extra death to occur], 12; P<0.001) but 
no significant between-group difference in mor-
tality when the original oximeters were used 
(test for interaction between revised and original 
oximeters, P 
= 
0.006).11 A post hoc analysis of 
combined data from the two trials confirmed 
the higher in-hospital mortality among infants 
in the lower-target group in association with the 
use of the revised oximeters (P 
= 
0.002).8 Here, 
we report the outcomes of the Australian and 
U.K. BOOST-II trials in children up to a corrected 
age of 2 years.
Methods
Patients
The planned sample size in each trial was 1200 
infants. The Australian trial, which involved 15 
centers, was started on March 25, 2006. The 
U.K. trial, which involved 34 centers, was started 
on September 29, 2007. Both trials closed recruit-
ment on December 24, 2010. Infants were eligi-
ble for inclusion in the trial if they were born in 
the preceding 24 hours and before 28 weeks’ 
gestation. Infants who had major congenital ab-
normalities or were unlikely to survive or to be 
followed up were ineligible. Infants from multi-
ple births underwent randomization individually. 
Randomization was performed centrally by com-
puter and was performed separately for each 
trial. Minimization procedures were used to 
balance group assignments according to sex, 
gestational age, and center and, in the Austra-
lian trial, according to whether the infant was a 
singleton or part of a multiple birth and whether 
the infant was enrolled in the hospital of birth. 
In each trial, the original primary analysis 
population was defined as all enrolled infants. 
In 2010, the U.K. trial steering committee, the 
members of which were unaware of any of the 
outcome data, revised the protocol on the rec-
ommendation of its data and safety monitoring 
committee to change the primary analysis popu-
lation to 1200 infants who would be evaluated 
with the use of the revised oximeters. The initial 
and updated protocols and statistical analysis 
plans are available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org.

Oxygen-Saturation Targets in Preterm Infants
Enrollment and Treatment
In both trials, infants were randomly assigned 
to an oxygen-saturation target range of 85 to 
89% (lower-target group) or 91 to 95% (higher-
target group). The study oximeters were modi-
fied so that the observers were unaware of the 
true reading; readings in the range of 85 to 95% 
displayed an oxygen saturation that was up to 
3 percentage points higher than the actual oxygen 
saturation in the lower-target group and 3 per-
centage points lower than actual oxygen satura-
tion in the higher-target group. Thus, for exam-
ple, a displayed reading of 90% matched an 
actual reading of 87% in the lower-target group 
and 93% in the higher-target group. The clinical 
staff targeted displayed readings of 88 to 92% to 
achieve the intended target ranges. At readings 
above 95% and below 85%, the oximeters revert-
ed to the true reading. In both trials, an upper 
displayed oxygen-saturation alarm threshold of 
94% was recommended. A lower displayed alarm 
threshold of 86% was recommended in the Aus-
tralian trial; in the U.K. trial, this decision was 
left to the individual centers. Only study oxime-
ters were used until 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age. 
If infants were in stable condition while breath-
ing ambient air before then, oximetry was dis-
continued. If oximetry was resumed before 36 
weeks, a study oximeter was used. Masimo sup-
plied the study oximeters under lease.
Assessments
Outcomes were evaluated without knowledge of 
the treatment-group assignments. Initially, cogni-
tive impairment was to be assessed as a Mental 
Development Index cutoff score of less than 70 on 
a Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second 
Edition (BSID-II), assessment. Before the assess-
ments began, the BOOST-II and NeOProM trial 
protocols were revised to adopt the Bayley Scales 
of Infant Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), 
and used a cutoff score of less than 85, because 
this approximately matched a cognitive score 
of less than 70 on the BSID-II. Scores on the 
Bayley-III are assessed relative to a standardized 
mean (±SD) of 100±15, with higher scores indi-
cating better performance.12
Serious neurosensory disability in the U.K. 
trial or major disability in the Australian trial 
(both hereafter called “disability”) were defined 
as a score of less than 85 on the Bayley-III cogni-
tive or language assessment, as being legally 
blind or partially sighted in the U.K. trial or legal-
ly blind with less than 6/60 vision in the better 
eye in the Australian trial, or as having severe 
cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Function Classifi-
cation System [GMFCS] level ≥213 [on a scale of 
0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater 
impairment] or not walking unaided at 2 years) 
or deafness (hearing loss requiring or too severe 
to benefit from aiding or a cochlear implant). 
Bayley-III assessments could not always be ar-
ranged. Therefore, to minimize the risk of bias 
from postrandomization exclusions, alternative 
measures of cognition and language were pre-
specified in revised statistical analysis plans 
before the data were analyzed (Tables S1 through 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org).7,14 If these outcomes remained un-
known and the child was not blind or deaf and 
did not have cerebral palsy, data on the primary 
outcome were judged as missing.
Prespecified secondary outcomes in children 
up to a corrected age of 2 years included death, 
a Bayley-III cognitive or language score of less 
than 85, blindness, cerebral palsy, deafness, de-
velopmental delay of 12 months or more on a 
pediatric assessment, and, in the Australian trial, 
late-onset infection, respiratory illness, death 
attributed to pulmonary causes by a clinician, 
days of endotracheal intubation, days of treat-
ment with continuous positive airway pressure, 
days of treatment with supplemental oxygen in 
the hospital and at home, and the number of 
hospital readmissions. The prespecified second-
ary outcomes of treatment for severe retinopathy, 
use of oxygen at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age, 
patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocoli-
tis resulting in surgery or death, grade III or IV 
intraventricular hemorrhage, and brain injury 
were reported previously for both trials.8 The 
definitions of the secondary outcomes are pro-
vided in the protocols, which include the statisti-
cal analysis plans.
Study Oversight
Each trial was designed and conducted separately 
with separate oversight committees. The joint 
writing committee members vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and analyses 
and for the fidelity of the reporting of each trial 
to its protocol. An ethics committee at each cen-
ter approved the study before it began. A parent 
of each child provided written informed consent.

Statistical Analysis
Infants who were randomly assigned to the 
higher oxygen-saturation target range were ex-
pected to have a 30 to 40% incidence of the 
primary outcome.11,12 Assuming an incidence of 
35%, we calculated that each trial would need to 
enroll 1200 infants for the study to have 80% 
power to detect an 8 percentage-point absolute 
difference between the groups, at a two-sided 
5% level of significance.
The statistical analyses were performed inde-
pendently by the respective trial analysts. The 
primary and secondary analyses in each trial 
were prespecified, but pooled analyses and retro-
spective comparisons of the time spent in the 
assigned oxygen-saturation range were not. Data 
were analyzed according to the randomly as-
signed study group, regardless of deviation from 
protocol. In the Australian trial, the primary 
analysis population comprised all enrolled in-
fants. In the U.K. trial, the primary analysis 
population comprised infants whose oxygen-
saturation levels were evaluated with the revised 
oximeters; those for whom the original oximeters 
were used were included in secondary analyses. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics were 
summarized with counts and percentages for 
categorical variables or with means and stan-
dard deviations for normally distributed contin-
uous variables. For statistical comparisons, we 
calculated the relative risk and 95% confidence 
interval for the primary outcome. For other di-
chotomous outcomes, 95% confidence intervals 
were used in the Australian trial, and 99% con-
fidence intervals were used in the U.K. trial.
In the Australian trial, the effects of the oxygen-
saturation target on the primary outcome were 
assessed with the use of generalized estimating 
equations adjusted for correlation between in-
fants from multiple births. Binary secondary 
outcomes were assessed similarly, and count 
data (e.g., hospital readmissions) were analyzed 
by Poisson generalized linear models with a log 
link and are shown as relative rates. Before the 
analysis, we planned to report key outcomes for 
all infants and separately for those who were 
evaluated with the original oximeters and those 
who were evaluated with revised oximeters (see 
the protocols and statistical analysis plans).
In both trials, the denominator for events was 
the number of infants for whom each outcome 
was known. The relative risk was calculated as 
the incidence in the lower-target group divided 
by incidence in the higher-target group. The re-
sults were adjusted for clustering due to multiple 
births and, in the U.K. trial, for minimization 
factors with the use of generalized linear models 
with a log link. We performed sensitivity analy-
ses that excluded data from infants for whom 
alternatives to the Bayley-III assessments had 
been used. For the statistical analyses, SAS, ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute), was used in the Austra-
lian trial, and Stata/SE, version 13.1 for Win-
dows (StataCorp), was used in the U.K. trial. For 
the combined analyses, SAS, version 9.3, and 
RevMan, version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration), 
were used, with trial data unadjusted for multi-
ple births or other descriptive variables. Tests for 
interaction were used to detect heterogeneity 
with respect to the primary outcome, with re-
spect to disability, and with respect to death and 
included all infants with data, stratified accord-
ing to trial and oximeter.
Results
Patient Population and Primary Outcomes
We enrolled 1135 infants in the Australian trial 
and 973 infants in the U.K. trial (Fig. 1). The 
characteristics of the randomly assigned groups 
were similar at trial entry (Table 1, and Table S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The primary out-
come was determined for 1094 of 1135 infants 
(96.4%) in the primary analysis population of 
the Australian trial (all infants) and 723 of 745 
infants (97.0%) in the primary analysis popula-
tion of the U.K. trial (infants for whom revised 
oximeters only were used). In the Australian 
trial, the primary outcome occurred in 247 of 
549 infants (45.0%) in the lower-target group 
Figure 1 (facing page). Enrollment and Randomization 
in the BOOST-II Trials.
In the Australian trial, the other reasons for nonrecruit-
ment of 465 infants were as follows: parents were not 
approached (248 infants), parents were under too much 
stress (54), infant was transferred to or from another 
hospital during the eligibility period (44), parents were 
not available (41), no interpreter was available (26), 
consent was obtained after the infant was 24 hours of 
age (14), insufficient study monitors were available (4), 
investigators were awaiting ethics approval for the pro-
tocol amendment (4), and miscellaneous (30).

lack of antenatal treatment with glucocorticoids, which was more common among infants in the lower-target group than in the higher-target 
group in the Australian trial (P = 0.03). However, the relative risks of the primary outcome in the lower-target group versus the higher-target 
group were unchanged after adjustment for use of antenatal glucocorticoids (Tables S12 and S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean 
(±SD) corrected ages at the follow-up assessment were 26.0±5.1 months in the lower-target group and 25.7±4.5 months in the higher-target 
group in the Australian trial and 28.7±7.1 and 29.9±7.6 months, respectively, in the U.K. trial.
†  
An incomplete course of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was defined as a duration of treatment of less than 24 hours; a complete course 
was one that was administered for 24 hours or longer. Data on infants who received a course of glucocorticoid treatment more than 7 days 
before birth are not included in the table.

of the Primary Outcome.
The primary outcome in each trial was death or disability at a corrected gestational age of 2 years; this outcome was 
evaluated among infants whose oxygen saturation was measured with any study oximeter in the Australian trial and 
those whose oxygen saturation was measured with a revised oximeter in the U.K. trial. The row in which the data for 
the primary outcome in each trial appears is highlighted. The relative risks of the individual components of the primary 
outcome (death and disability) are also shown. The relative risks are unadjusted for multiple births and for variables 
used for minimization at randomization. Phet by trial is the P value for heterogeneity of outcomes according to trial. 
There was no heterogeneity between the U.K. and Australian trials with respect to any outcome. Phet by algorithm is the 
P value for heterogeneity of outcomes according to oximeter calibration algorithm. There was heterogeneity between 
the revised and original oximeters with respect to death (P = 0.01) but no other outcomes. “Bayley alternatives” refers 
to cognitive or language assessments other than the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition, and include 
the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition (WPPSI-III), Griffiths Mental Development 
Scales (GMDS), Schedule of Growing Skills (SGS), Denver Developmental Screening Test, Parent Report of Children’s 
Abilities–Revised (PARCA-R), assessment by a pediatrician or general practitioner, or adjudication of parent-reported 
information. The widths of the diamonds for pooled data indicate the 95% confidence intervals for the pooled esti-
mates of effect.

In combined unadjusted analyses of data 
from both trials (Fig. 2), death or disability oc-
curred more frequently in the lower-target group 
than in the higher-target group among all 
2035 infants for whom outcomes were known 
(492 of 1022 [48.1%] vs. 437 of 1013 [43.1%]; 
relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.23; P 
= 
0.02). 
The difference in the rate of death or disability 
was similar when it was based on only the 1774 
infants whose outcome was assigned without 
the use of alternative measures to the Bayley-III 
(468 of 887 [52.8%] vs. 423 of 887 [47.7%]; rela-
tive risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.21; P 
= 
0.04). 
The effect of the oxygen-saturation target range 
on the combined outcome of death or disability 
did not differ materially according to oximeter 
calibration algorithm (relative risk, 1.11 with the 
original algorithm and 1.12 with the revised

Scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), are assessed relative to a 
standardized mean (±SD) of 100±15, with higher scores indicating better performance. A score of less than 85 on the 
Bayley-III (or equivalent tool) is deemed to be equivalent to more than 2 standard deviations below the mean of the 
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Second Edition (BSID-II, the original scale in use when the trial was 
designed). Equivalent tools included the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition (WPPSI-
III), Griffiths Mental Development Scales (GMDS), Schedule of Growing Skills (SGS), Denver Developmental Screening 
Test, Parent Report of Children’s Abilities–Revised (PARCA-R), assessment by a pediatrician or general practitioner, or 
adjudication of parent-reported information.

The causes of severe visual loss were retinal damage (2 patients in each study group), cortical damage (4 patients in 
the lower-target group and 8 patients in the higher-target group), and unknown (2 patients in the lower-target group).

algorithm; P 
= 
0.86). However, there was evi-
dence of heterogeneity between the original and 
revised oximeters with regard to mortality 
(P 
= 
0.01). Mortality before 2 years was higher in 
the lower-target group than in the higher-target 
group, both among the 2090 infants for whom 
either oximeter was used (222 of 1045 [21.2%] 
vs. 185 of 1045 [17.7%]; relative risk, 1.20; 95% 
CI, 1.01 to 1.43; P 
= 
0.04) and among the 1173 
infants for whom revised oximeters were used 
(144 of 587 [24.5%] vs. 99 of 586 [16.9%]; rela-
tive risk, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.82; P 
= 
0.001). 
There were no significant differences between 
the groups in either trial in the rates of disabil-
ity (Table 2). The major causes of death were 
sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular 
hemorrhage, and chronic lung disease (Tables S7 
and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). There 
were five infant deaths in the Australian trial 
and nine in the U.K. trial that occurred after 
hospital discharge but before 2 years.
Secondary Outcomes
In the U.K. trial, the baseline characteristics of 
the infants in the secondary analysis, which in-
cluded infants for whom the original oximeters 
were used, were similar in the two groups (Table 
S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were 
no significant differences between groups in the 
prespecified secondary outcomes (Table S10 in 
the Supplementary Appendix) or in subgroup 
analyses (Fig. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). There were seven unexpected adverse 
events, as reported previously (Table S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).8 In the Australian trial, 
there were no significant between-group differ-
ences in secondary outcomes (Table S14 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) and no unexpected 
adverse events among children up to a corrected 
age of 2 years. As reported previously,8 during 
oxygen treatment, infants in the lower-target 
group spent approximately 30% more time in 
their assigned range after the oximeter revision 
than before it, both in the Australian trial 
(31.1% vs. 23.2%, P<0.001) and in the U.K. trial 
(26.3% vs. 20.0%, P<0.001).
Discussion
In the primary analysis populations in the Aus-
tralian and U.K. trials, there were no significant 
differences between the study groups in the rate 
of the primary outcome of death or disability in 
each trial individually, but the rate was signifi-
cantly higher in the lower-target group than in 
the higher-target group in the post hoc com-
bined, unadjusted analyses of the two trials. In 
combined analyses that included infants for 
whom any study oximeter was used, the relative 
risk of death or disability was 12% higher in the 
lower-target group than in the higher-target 
group; among the infants for whom revised 
oximeters (which are similar to currently used 
oximeters10) were used, the relative risk of death 
was 45% higher in the lower-target group than 
in the higher-target group (Fig. 2).
There was no significant difference between 
the groups in the rates of disability at 2 years in 
either trial or in the combined analyses. Although 
disability was measured by a combination of 
Bayley-III and alternative measures, sensitivity 
analyses excluding the alternative measures re-
sulted in no material change in the conclusions.
In the combined analysis, more infants in the 
higher-target group than in the lower-target 
group were treated for retinopathy of prematu-
rity,8 but there was no significant between-group 
difference in the rate of blindness. Furthermore, 
none of the NeOProM oxygen targeting trials 
have shown differences in the rates of disability 
or blindness.5-7
The higher mortality among infants randomly 
assigned to a lower oxygen-saturation target was 
observed with all oximeters, and the difference 
was even more pronounced with the revised ox-
imeters. Separate consideration of the mortality 
results obtained in association with the revised 
oximeters is justified for several reasons: first, 
the oximeter revision corrected an artifact in the 
calibration algorithm; second, the U.K. trial pre-
specified infants for whom revised oximeters 
were used as the primary analysis population; 
third, in combined unadjusted analyses, there 
was heterogeneity with respect to mortality be-
tween infants stratified according to the type of 
oximeter (P 
= 
0.01); fourth, the strength of the 
evidence for excess mortality in the lower-target 
group for whom revised oximeters were used 
(P 
= 
0.001) makes a false positive result unlikely; 
and finally, we previously reported significantly 
higher in-hospital mortality (representing 96% 
of all deaths up to 2 years of age) in the lower-
target group than in the higher-target group 
among infants for whom revised oximeters were

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
used (P 
= 
0.002).8,11 These significant differences 
in mortality were observed despite the lower-
than-planned separation in oxygen-saturation 
values found between the study groups.15,16
After SUPPORT showed excess mortality 
among infants randomly assigned to lower oxygen-
saturation targets,4 the BOOST trial investigators 
consulted their data and safety monitoring com-
mittees because of concerns about possible harm 
to infants in the lower-target group.11 The results 
of a pooled interim safety analysis, conducted 
with the use of prespecified guidelines,11 met the 
criteria of both protocols for stopping the study 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). This 
protocol-specified process was therefore appro-
priate.17 Through chance, treatment effects may 
be overestimated in trials that, like the BOOST 
II studies, are stopped early after an interim 
analysis8,18; however, they can be underestimated 
in trials that, like the Canadian Oxygen Trial 
(COT) and SUPPORT, reach completion despite 
interim analyses.4,6,19 COT6 showed that the rate 
of the primary outcome of death or disability 
was not significantly higher in the lower-target 
group than in the higher-target group (relative 
risk, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.37; P 
= 
0.52). How-
ever, the point estimate of the treatment effect 
in COT was consistent with that observed in the 
combined BOOST II trials and, on the basis of 
the confidence intervals, its results are consistent 
with as much as a 15% lower or 37% higher rate 
of death or disability. The most accurate esti-
mates of the magnitude of treatment effects 
are likely to come from syntheses of all the 
NeOProM trials.3,20
Pulse oximeters estimate arterial oxygen satu-
ration within limits of accuracy, such that 1 stan-
dard deviation equals 3%.10,16,21 Thus, an oxygen-
saturation value of 88% could reflect an arterial 
oxygen saturation between 85 and 91% in 68% 
of infants, but it may fall outside a range of 82 
to 94% in up to 5% of infants. Variations in the 
location of the probe and the proportion of fetal 
hemoglobin may influence these limits16 but 
should create no bias, because randomization 
tends to balance such factors evenly between 
groups. However, because pulse oximeters under-
estimate hypoxemia with progressively wider 
limits of accuracy as true oxygen-saturation val-
ues decrease from 93% to 80%,21 substantially 
more infants in the lower-target group than in 
the higher-target group may have been exposed 
to values of partial pressure of arterial oxygen 
below the previously recommended levels,22 with 
associated adverse effects.
During oxygen treatment, fewer than a third 
of oxygen-saturation values among infants in the 
lower-target group were in the assigned range, 
as compared with approximately half of the 
values among infants in the higher-target group.8 
The higher range includes the plateau of the oxy-
hemoglobin dissociation curve, where oxygen 
saturation fluctuates less with changing partial 
pressure of arterial oxygen and the slope of oxy-
gen saturation versus the fraction of inspired 
oxygen (Fio2) is flatter,23 which makes targeting 
easier. This may help explain why, during oxy-
gen treatment, none of the NeOProM trials 
achieved a median value of actual oxygen satu-
ration below 89% among infants in the lower-
target groups.4,6-8,15 The current trials and other 
NeOProM trials may therefore have underesti-
mated the effect that accurately targeting an 
oxygen saturation of 85 to 89% has on adverse 
outcomes.
After the algorithm revision, infants in the 
lower-target groups spent approximately 30% 
longer in their intended oxygen-saturation range, 
which resulted in greater exposure to hypox-
emia.8 This observation may explain the increased 
difference in mortality between the groups after 
the revision.21,22 However, the magnitude of the 
difference in mortality may also be due to 
chance or to changes in confounding variables 
over time. Although we also report results as-
sociated with the original oximeters, the revised 
oximeters are more relevant to current practice.10 
The consistent trend toward higher mortality 
among infants in the lower-target groups across 
trials that used revised oximeters in three conti-
nents, with no statistical heterogeneity among 
the trials,8,24,25 supports the generalizability of the 
current data.
The total mortality in the NeOProM trials 
varied from 15% in the New Zealand BOOST-II 
trial and COT, to 17% in the Australian BOOST-II 
trial, to 20% in SUPPORT, to 23% in the U.K. 
BOOST-II trial. These differences may be ex-
plained by variations in study populations owing 
to differences in admission or eligibility criteria, 
decisions about viability, or genetic risk.26,27 For 
example, the U.K. BOOST-II trial recruited more 
infants who were transferred into the study cen-
ters after being born elsewhere, and SUPPORT,

Oxygen-Saturation Targets in Preterm Infants
which enrolled infants before birth, may have 
included more infants who were moribund or 
had severe lung disease.
Targeting an intermediate oxygen-saturation 
range,16,28 such as 87 to 93%, versus a higher 
range is an untested practice that may increase 
mortality, because current oximeters permit in-
creasingly disproportionate exposure to hypox-
emia as oxygen saturation decreases to below 
93%.21 At present, the most rigorously evaluated 
evidence29 for policy is that targeting an oxygen 
saturation of 91 to 95% is safer than targeting 
an oxygen saturation of 85 to 89%.
In conclusion, targeting an oxygen saturation 
of 85 to 89%, as compared with 91 to 95%, re-
sulted in nonsignificantly higher rates of death 
or disability at 2 years in the individual trials. 
However, the use of the lower target signifi-
cantly increased the risks of this combined out-
come and of death alone in post hoc combined 
analyses.
