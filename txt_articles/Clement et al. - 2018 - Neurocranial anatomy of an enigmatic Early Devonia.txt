Abstract The skull of ‘Ligulalepis’ from the Early Devonian of Australia (AM-F101607) has
significantly expanded our knowledge of early osteichthyan anatomy, but its phylogenetic position
has remained uncertain. We herein describe a second skull of ‘Ligulalepis’ and present micro-CT
data on both specimens to reveal novel anatomical features, including cranial endocasts. Several
features previously considered to link ‘Ligulalepis’ with actinopterygians are now considered
generalized osteichthyan characters or of uncertain polarity. The presence of a lateral cranial canal
is shown to be variable in its development between specimens. Other notable new features include
the presence of a pineal foramen, the some detail of skull roof sutures, the shape of the nasal
capsules, a placoderm-like hypophysial vein, and a chondrichthyan-like labyrinth system. New
phylogenetic analyses place ‘Ligulalepis’ as a stem osteichthyan, specifically as the sister taxon to
‘psarolepids’ plus crown osteichthyans. The precise position of ‘psarolepids’ differs between
parsimony and Bayesian analyses.

Introduction
Some 98% of living vertebrate species belong to Osteichthyes, the ‘bony fishes’. Osteichthyans are
distinct from living jawless fishes (lampreys and hagfishes) and Chondrichthyes (the ‘cartilaginous
fishes’: sharks, rays and chimaeras), and comprise Actinopterygii, or ‘ray-finned’ fishes (such as tele-
osts, bichirs and gars), and Sarcopterygii, or ‘lobe-finned’ fishes (lungfishes, coelacanths and tetra-
pods). The earliest osteichthyans are late Silurian (~425 million years ago), and from first appearance
included large forms sometimes considered to be sarcopterygians (Choo et al., 2014; Zhu et al.,
2009), but the interrelationships of the earliest members remain contentious (Friedman and Bra-
zeau, 2010).
Despite a lack of clarity with respect to relationships, a number of significant discoveries in recent
years has resulted in a clearer view of early osteichthyan anatomy. In particular, taxa such as Youngo-
lepis (Chang, 1982), Diabolepis (Chang and Yu, 1984), Kenichthys (Chang and Zhu, 1993), Psarole-
pis (Yu, 1998), Achoania (Zhu et al., 2001), Styloichthys (Zhu and Yu, 2002), Guiyu (Zhu et al.,
2009), Tungsenia (Lu et al., 2012a2012), Megamastax (Choo et al., 2014), Sparalepis (Choo et al.,

 2017), and Ptyctolepis (Lu et al., 2017) have provided new morphological information regarding the
pattern of character acquisition in osteichthyans, in particular sarcopterygians. In contrast, the Silu-
rian–Early Devonian record of actinopterygian evolution is poorly understood, confounded by fewer
identified specimens known from typically fragmentary material. Despite the identification of Silurian
sarcopterygians (but see Lu et al., 2017) necessitating the presence of contemporaneous actino-
pterygians (Coates, 2009), the oldest putative actinopterygian is the Lochkovian (~415 Ma) Mee-
mannia (Lu et al., 2016a), with unequivocal ray-finned fishes such as Cheirolepis known only from
the Eifelian-Givetian (~393 Ma) and younger deposits. This paucity of specimens may be a reflection
of
lower
abundance
and
diversity
of
early
actinopterygians
compared
to
sarcopterygians
(Cloutier and Arratia, 2004; Friedman and Brazeau, 2010).
Phylogenetic relationships among stem osteichthyans are also poorly resolved. Several taxa have
been proposed to branch from the stem, but there is little consensus as to the membership or
branching order. Indeed, it has been suggested that ‘stem-group osteichthyans might not be recog-
nized, even when their remains are discovered’ (Friedman and Brazeau, 2010, pg. 38). Dialipina
was originally diagnosed as a actinopterygian based on scale morphology (Schultze, 1968), but
more recent analyses have resolved it either as an stem actinopterygian (Giles et al., 2015b;
Schultze and Cumbaa, 2001) or stem osteichthyan (Choo et al., 2017; Friedman and Brazeau,
2010; Giles et al., 2015c; Lu et al., 2016a; Qiao et al., 2016). Taxa referred to as ‘psarolepids’
(sensu Choo et al., 2017) were originally placed as sarcopterygians: Psarolepis was initially
described as a ‘porolepiform-like’ crown sarcopterygian (Yu, 1998) or either a stem osteichthyan or
stem sarcopterygian (Zhu et al., 1999), with most subsequent analyses corroborating a stem sarcop-
terygian position (Brazeau, 2009; Choo et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2016a; Qiao et al., 2016; Zhu et al.,
2001; Zhu et al., 2009); and Guiyu was deemed a stem sarcopterygian when first described
(Zhu et al., 2009), a position subsequently supported in other analyses (Choo et al., 2017; Lu et al.,
2016a). More recent analyses have recovered a stem osteichthyan position for ‘psarolepids’
(Lu et al., 2017: supported under parsimony, but not Bayesian, analyses), corroborating previous
eLife digest All animals can be classified as either vertebrate (those that have a spine) or
invertebrate (those that do not). About 98% of all living vertebrate species belong to a group called
Osteichthyes, otherwise known as bony fish. Despite the name, this group also includes all four-
limbed vertebrates – amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals – since they evolved from prehistoric
bony fish millions of years ago.
The oldest known bony fish can be traced back to around 425 million years. These ancient bony
fish are all part of a sub-group called lobe-finned fish. Most modern bony fish, however, are part of
a different sub-group called ray-finned fish, which can only be confidently traced back about 390
million years. A species called Ligulalepis was once thought to represent the oldest ray-finned fish.
Scientists worked this out by examining a single Ligulalepis skull fossil from around 400 million years
ago. However, subsequent studies have disputed its position in the evolutionary tree. So, the early
evolution of bony fish remains poorly understood.
To address this, Clement, King, Giles et al. re-examined the original Ligulalepis skull fossil,
alongside a newly discovered second skull fossil of the same species. Modern x-ray scanning
techniques were used to produce detailed 3D models of both skulls and compare them to other
prehistoric bony fish. This allowed Clement, King, Giles et al. to find Ligulalepis’s exact place in the
evolutionary family tree.
The experiments identified many previously unknown features of the Ligulalepis skull. These
features suggest that this species was not a ray-finned fish; rather, it existed just before bony fish
split into two sub-groups (lobe-finned and ray-finned). The analysis also suggests that Ligulalepis
was the species most closely related to another group of fish called psarolepids. Overall, these
findings clarify our understanding of the evolutionary tree of all vertebrates, including humans.
Future research should continue using modern scanning techniques to uncover new information
from old fossils and give further insights into the early evolution of vertebrates.

 suggestions by Zhu et al. (1999) and Choo et al. (2017), as well as evidence from palaeohistological
data (Qu et al., 2015). A Bayesian tip-dating approach provides no resolution regarding the phylo-
genetic position of Guiyu, Achoania and Psarolepis (King et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding
early osteichthyan relationships may be related to the dual problems of missing palaeontological
data and
difficulty
in
polarising
osteichthyan
characters,
exacerbated
by
the discovery
of
osteichthyan-like anatomy in stem gnathostomes (e.g. Janusiscus: Giles et al., 2015c; Entelogna-
thus: Zhu et al., 2013).
One taxon that may help to elucidate osteichthyan stem group phylogeny is the enigmatic Ligula-
lepis. Ligulalepis toombsi (Schultze, 1968) was erected and attributed to Actinopterygii byon the
basis of isolated scales from the Early Devonian (Emsian) Taemas Limestones of the Burrinjuck area
of New South Wales, Australia. A second species, Ligulalepis yunnanensis Wang and Dong, 1989,
was erected on the basis of isolated scales from the Silurian (Ludlow) Miaokao Formation of Yunnan,
China. Subsequently, other occurrences of isolated scales from Australia were attributed to the
genus (Burrow, 1994; Burrow, 1997), including throughout the Bloomfield Limestone member to
the Warroo Limestone member at Burrinjuck (Basden and Young, 2001); scales from at least the lat-
ter locality appear to belong to a single taxon (C. Burrow pers. comm to GCY). Schultze (2016)
referred a jaw from the Early Devonian Trundle Beds of New South Wales to Ligulalepis, although no
justification for this is given by Schultze. Histological sections through the jaw show teeth bearing
acrodin, a hypermineralised tissue forming a tooth cap that is currently known only in actinoptery-
gians (Ørvig, 1973).
An incomplete braincase and skull roof, AM-F101607, from the same Burrinjuck limestones, was
described by Basden et al. (2000) as perhaps the ‘most primitive osteichthyan braincase’ known,
emphasizing its unusual combination of morphological characters. These authors used the phyloge-
netic analysis of Zhu et al. (1999) to consider alternative placements of AM-F101607 as either a
stem gnathostome, stem actinopterygian, or stem osteichthyan, the last option being the most parsi-
monious. Later, Basden and Young (2001) published a more detailed morphological description of
this specimen, which they considered might rather represent a member of the actinopterygian stem.
Consequently, the specimen was moved to ‘Ligulalepis’ sp., and tentatively referred to Ligulalepis
toombsi, on the basis that this was the only actinopterygian taxon known from the Emsian of south-
eastern Australia.
In addition to characters considered actinopterygian-like (dermal ornament, skull roof pattern and
overall endocranial proportions; Basden and Young, 2001), the skull of ‘Ligulalepis’ displayed
characters found scattered across the gnathostome tree. ‘Primitive’ features included the presence
of an eye stalk, myodomes for the attachment of oculomotor-innervated eye muscles, and an open-
ing for the orbital artery (Basden et al., 2000). However, certain features were noted to bear resem-
blance to sarcopterygians, including the proportions of the (short and broad) telencephalic region,
‘Psarolepis-like’ pit lines on the skull roof, shape of the basisphenoid and the shallow depth of the
oticoccipital area (Basden and Young, 2001). The position of the hyomandibular attachment along
the anteroposterior axis of the otic capsule was considered intermediate between the posterior
placement in chondrichthyans and the anterior placement in osteichthyans, similar to that in Acanth-
odes (Basden and Young, 2001; Basden et al., 2000; Brazeau and de Winter, 2015; Davis et al.,
2012).
Subsequent phylogenetic analyses have recovered contrasting placements for ‘Ligulalepis’.
Zhu et al. (2001), in describing the primitive sarcopterygian Achoania from the Early Devonian of
China, resolved ‘Ligulalepis’ as a basally-branching actinopterygian. Friedman, 2007 (pg. 311) deter-
mined ‘Ligulalepis’ to be a stem osteichthyan, arguing that the ‘actinopterygian affinities of Ligulale-
pis . . . have relied upon characters of uncertain polarity.’ Following the discovery of Guiyu from the
late Silurian of China, ‘Ligulalepis’ was recovered as a stem sarcopterygian (Zhu et al., 2009), whilst
Brazeau (2009), resolved ‘Ligulalepis’ as a stem osteichthyan. Friedman and Brazeau (2010) exam-
ined the early osteichthyan radiation and presented a more detailed argument for stem osteichthyan
affinity of ‘Ligulalepis’. Since then, ‘Ligulalepis’ has been recovered as a stem osteichthyan in most
analyses (Davis et al., 2012; Giles et al., 2015b; Giles et al., 2015c; Giles et al., 2017; Long et al.,
2015; Lu et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2013). However, tip dated analyses employed
by King et al., 2017 place ‘Ligulalepis’ within Actinopterygii with quite strong support.
Uncertainty surrounding the phylogenetic placement of ‘Ligulalepis’ clearly warrants further inves-
tigation. Here, we use micro-CT scanning to reinvestigate the anatomy of the original cranium (AM-

 F101607), augmented by description of a second, recently-discovered specimen (ANU V3628). The
main goals of this work are: (1) to provide a revised account of the anatomy of ‘Ligulalepis’, including
the previously unknown anterior region of the skull roof (preserved in ANU V3628); (2) to test the
anatomical interpretations produced on the basis of external investigation only (Basden and Young,
2001; Basden et al., 2000); (3) to examine the effect, if any, of this new anatomical data on the phy-
logenetic position of ‘Ligulalepis’ and understanding of early osteichthyan evolution, based on a
revised version of a recent phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2017); and (4) to investigate the implica-
tions of our phylogenetic placement of AM-F101607 and ANU V3628 for the taxonomic referral of
the skulls to Ligulalepis.
Skull roof
Scans of AM-F101607 reveal for the first time some of the sutures between the skull roofing bones
(Figure 1) showing a pattern different in important respects to the previous interpretation
(Basden and Young, 2001). Viewing the scan in Drishti reveals a set of parallel bands tracing what
we assume to be bone sutures in the posterior part of the skull (Figure 1B). Closer inspection of the
scan data reveals these bands to be high-density thickenings in the basal layer of the dermal skull
roof bones (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These show the outline of the postparietals (of sarcop-
terygians; parietals of actinopterygians) and the posterior edges of the parietals (of sarcopterygians;
frontals of actinopterygians) (Figure 1B,C). No midline suture is evident between the postparietals,
but a very faint suture between the parietals is suggested. The lateral margin of the postparietal is
scalloped in such a way as to provide contact faces for a series of three bones, with faint lines visible
demarcating them. The most posterior bone presumably corresponds to the tabular (of sarcoptery-
gians; supratemporal of actinopterygians). Anterior to this is a supratemporal (of sarcopterygians;
intertemporal of actinopterygians), and a broad and elongate intertemporal (of sarcopterygians; der-
mosphenotic of actinopterygians) borders the orbit. Unfortunately, sutures cannot be visualized in
the same way in ANU V3628, despite the higher scan resolution, because no high density growth
bands are evident. Instead the basal layer of the skull roof dermal bone is of uniform density and
thickness. This suggests that they may vary between individuals or growth phases. Further specimens
of ‘Ligulalepis’ are required to unambiguously determine the pattern of skull roof bones in this
taxon. The presence of middle and posterior pitlines, and the supraorbital canals extending to the
posterior edge of the postparietals, is confirmed in ANU V3628.

 ANU V3628 preserves the previously unknown anterior portion of the skull roof (Figure 2). A
pineal foramen is preserved, but due to a crack in the specimen it is unclear if a separate pineal plate
was present. Sutures in the anterior part of the skull are unclear. The pattern of ornamentation ante-
rior to the pineal opening is suggestive of a median ossification (i.e. a median rostral), but this is not
evident from the CT data.
The profile of the snout has a sharply downturned anterior face (Figure 3), as is general for gna-
thostomes (Gardiner, 1984; Long, 1988; Zhu et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2009). There is an abrupt
change in ornamentation on the snout, from short anteriorly directed ridges to elongate transverse
ridges (Figure 2C). A similar pattern is known in Dialipina (Schultze and Cumbaa, 2001).

Evolutionary Biology
 The incurrent nostrils are large and widely separated from the excurrent nostrils, which appear to
lie entirely within the orbits (Figure 3). Basden and Young (2001) also assumed communication of
the posterior nostril with the orbit, including a notch for the nostril on the anterior margin of the
orbital fenestra. Neither specimen of ‘Ligulalepis’ show evidence for such a notch, although the ven-
tral part of the nostril and orbital margin are unknown. A nostril confluent with the orbit is typically
considered an actinopterygian character, but without preservation of the premaxilla and cheek
bones in ‘Ligulalepis’ we cannot rule out the possibility that dermal bone separated the external
opening of the nostril from the orbit – for example a postero-dorsal process of the premaxilla as in
Psarolepis (Yu, 1998), and perhaps Cheirolepis (Gardiner, 1984, Fig. 49). However, in ‘Ligulalepis’
the opening for the posterior nostril in the endocranium lies directly within the orbit (Figure 3A).
This is in contrast to the situation in both actinopterygians and sarcopterygians, where an endoskele-
tal lamina (the postnasal wall) separates the nostril and the orbit (e.g. Gardiner, 1984, Fig. 13). ‘Lig-
ulalepis’ lacks such a lamina, and in this respect more closely resembles some placoderms such as
Parabuchanosteus (Young, 1979) and Dicksonosteus (Goujet, 1984).
Sensory canals
The supraorbital canal (soc) extends nearly the full preserved length of the cranium, terminating a lit-
tle way posterior to the downturned margin of the snout, and appears to be formed from two sepa-
rate sections (Figures 1C and 3C). The sections overlap slightly anterior to the level of the
postorbital process, the posterior section pinching out and sitting on top of the anterior section
(Figure 3C, indicated by arrow). Tubuli connecting the supraorbital canal to the surface are small
and few in number. Tubuli connecting the infraorbital (ioc) and otic (otc) canals to the surface are
larger (Figure 3D, arrows). The tubuli do not appear to be branched (although they may have
branched in the skin above the bone), in contrast to the highly branched tubuli of some early sarcop-
terygians (Bjerring, 1972; Cle
´ment and Ahlberg, 2010; Jarvik, 1972). It is not clear whether the
pores for the sensory canals figured for Mimipiscis and Moythomasia originate from branched or
individual tubuli (Gardiner, 1984).
Anterior to the level of the pineal foramen, the supraorbital sensory canals open to the dorsal sur-
face of the cranium (Figure 2), although the canal itself is housed in a ridge on the visceral surface of
the skull roof. This is similar to the condition in Achoania (Zhu et al., 2001), Guiyu (Zhu et al., 2009),
and Psarolepis (Yu, 1998), and may be equivalent to the ‘nasal pitlines’ described for Mimipiscis
(Gardiner, 1984, fig. 41, 102), although in Mimipiscis the supraorbital canals continue anterior to
the pitline. ANU V3628 is ventrally incomplete, so it is not clear if an ethmoid commissure was pres-
ent. If an ethmoid commissure was present, the supraorbital canals did not communicate with it.
Basden and Young (2001) described a lateral notch for a preopercular sensory line, however,
scans show no evidence for a preopercular canal in either specimen. A short anterior canal at the
intersection of the otic and infraorbital canals is present in ANU V3628 (Figure 3D: ‘P’), but less
developed in AM-F101607. This is the ‘P’ canal of Northcutt, 1989. It is present in some acantho-
dians, for example Acanthodes (Watson, 1937) and some actinopterygians, namely Mimipiscis and
Moythomasia (Gardiner, 1984). The wider distribution of the ‘P’ canal is difficult to assess in other
taxa in the absence of exceptionally preserved material or CT data.
Braincase
The preservation of the braincase is similar in both AM-F101607 and ANU V3628. It is mostly well
ossified, and comprises the basisphenoid, orbitotemporal and otic regions. The ethmoid region is
preserved on the left side of AM-F101607 and is more complete, but less well ossified, in ANU
V3628. The posterior and ventral portion of the braincase, comprising the occiput and basioccipital,
is absent in both specimens. The loss of this region, which is rarely preserved in early osteichthyans
(e.g. Yu, 1998; Zhu et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2012a2012), presumably corresponds to the presence of
well-developed otoccipital and ventral otic fissures, possibly in conjunction with a vestibular

 fontanelle. The orbital region is large, comprising nearly half of total braincase length, and the eth-
moid region short.
Ethmoid region
The ethmoid region is very short, and is moderately well ossified. It is separated from the orbitotem-
poral region by a poorly developed postnasal wall. A canal leaves the cranial cavity at the left lateral
limit of the pineal opening and extends posterolaterally to open into the orbit (Figures 4C–E and
5, acv). This opening was identified by Basden and Young (2001) as for the trochlear nerve (n.IV),
but its anterior position suggests it may have housed the anterior cerebral vein. This canal is present
on only the left side, as in some sarcopterygians such as Latimeria (Robineau, 1975), and various

 early actinopterygians such as Mimipiscis (Giles and Friedman, 2014) and Kansasiella (Poplin, 1974).
Anterior to this, a ramifying network of canals (identified previously as for the anterior cerebral vein;
Basden and Young, 2001: fig. 1) may have transmitted branches of the profundus nerve from the
orbit to the skull roof, but their course is incomplete (Figure 5A–C, br.prof).
Basden and Young (2001) identified a number of foramina in the dorsal wall of the orbit as
branches of the superficial ophthalmic nerve. However, the main trunk of the superficial ophthalmic
nerve does not enter the orbit. It remains within the neurocranium, passing below the supraorbital
sensory line (Figures 5 and 6, soph). Thus, the foramina in the orbit more likely carried branches of
the profundus nerve to the skull roof (Figures 3–6, br.prof). The internal course of the superficial
ophthalmic nerve may be related to the relatively wide interorbital septum in ‘Ligulalepis’.
Below the large opening for the olfactory canal, the posterior face of the nasal capsule is pierced
by six foramina in three groups. The two dorsal-most foramina enter the nasal capsule from the
orbit, and most likely transmitted branches of the profundus nerve (Figures 4–6, prof). The most
ventral three foramina also extends from the orbit, and may have carried branches of the maxillary
and buccal nerves (Figures 4–6, br.max). As noted by Basden and Young (2001), the remaining
canal originates in the forebrain, but its purpose is unclear. CT scans show that the apparent fora-
men at the anterior extent of the basisphenoid (Basden and Young, 2001: fig.7, ?fica) is in fact
blind.
Orbitotemporal region
The orbitotemporal region is extensive, forming the widest part of the braincase and comprising
nearly half the total length. A large opening in the orbital wall of AM-F101607 represents the
eyestalk attachment area, and was recognized as such due to its everted rims (Basden et al., 2000).

 The scan of ANU V3628 reveals delicate
endochondral bone laminae filling the eyestalk
attachment area (Figure 3A, eys), forming a rough surface as seen on other articular surfaces in
many osteichthyans. This ossification may have been present in AM-F101607 but lost during prepa-
ration (the area is protected by resin in ANU V3628), or ANU V3628 could reflect a more advanced
stage of ossification.
The oculomotor (III) and profundus (prof) nerves, as well as the entry of the jugular canal (jug.c)
into the orbit, were correctly identified by Basden and Young ([2001]: fig. 2), although there is no
communication between the profundus nerve and the canal described by Basden and Young (2001)
as housing the orbital artery. The position of the pituitary vein and ophthalmic artery foramina can
also be confirmed (Figures 4C and 5A,C,D, pv, opha).
The pituitary vein is continuous between the orbits, and is connected to the hypophysial chamber
by a median hypophysial vein (Figure 5D, hyp.v). This condition is similar to the transverse pituitary
vein in placoderms, for example Brindabellaspis (Young, 1980), Parabuchanosteus (Young, 1979),
Jagorina (Stensio
¨, 1969) and probably Romundina (Dupret et al., 2017; Goujet and Young, 2004).
Petalichthyid placoderms however lack this character (Castiello and Brazeau, 2018). In some early
diverging arthrodire placoderms (e.g. Kujdanowiaspis, Dicksonosteus), the pituitary vein is continu-
ous, but exits the floor of the braincase via the subpituitary fossa. There is no foramen in the hypo-
physial fossa identified that could have carried a median hypophysial vein in these taxa
(Goujet, 1984; Stensio
¨, 1963b). The condition in ‘Ligulalepis’ contrasts with other crown gnathos-
tomes in which the pituitary vein enters the hypophysial chamber directly (e.g. Maisey, 2005; Mai-
sey, 2007; Holland, 2014; Giles and Friedman, 2014). A continuous transverse pituitary vein canal
may be partly linked to the relative position of the forebrain and the angle of the hypophysial cham-
ber in ‘Ligulalepis’.
The trochlear (IV) nerve enters the orbit dorsal to the eyestalk attachment area, some way poste-
rior to the dorsal myodome (my.IV) and anterior cerebral vein (Figures 3 and 4C,D). The canal origi-
nally identified for the trochlear (IV) nerve (Basden and Young, 2001) in fact houses the anterior
cerebral vein. This revised position of the trochlear (IV) nerve (i.e. posterodorsal to the eyestalk)
reflects the general gnathostome condition (Chang, 1982; Gardiner, 1984; Maisey, 2005;
Young, 1979), but the position of the myodome anterior to the orbit is more similar to that of
osteichthyans.
A large opening on the postorbital process was previously identified (Basden and Young, 2001)
as housing the orbital artery, in line with the position of this feature in placoderms. Segmentation of
the internal course of this canal shows there is no communication with the profundus nerve canal,
contrary to Basden and Young (2001) description. The canal connects with a large opening beneath
the cerebellar portion of the cranial cavity, most parsimoniously identified as the root of the trigemi-
nal (V) nerve. As such, the large foramen in the orbit most likely transmitted the mandibular branch
of the trigeminal nerve (Figures 4C–E and 5A,C, Vmd). This canal also aligns with a notch in the
postorbital process, along which the mandibular nerve would have travelled. This morphology is sim-
ilar to that seen in chondrichthyans (e.g. Cladodoides: Maisey, 2005; ‘Cobelodus’: Maisey, 2007).
Small branches are given off the trigeminal nerve within the braincase. One branch (Figure 6B–C, br.
buc.1) enters the posterodorsal part of the orbit at a steep angle and likely carried lateralis fibres to
small canals in the roof of the orbit that lead to the dorsal part of the infraorbital canal. A second
branch (Figure 6B–C, br.buc.2), previously suggested as carrying the posterior branch of the oculo-
motor (III) nerve (Basden and Young, 2001), opens onto the postorbital process just dorsal to the
opening for the mandibular branch. This may also have carried lateralis fibres to the infraorbital
canal.
Posterior to the root of the trigeminal nerve, a canal (r.lat) leaves the anterior face of the utricular
region and enters the "trigemino-facialis chamber" (Figure 5B). This is interpreted as the root of the
anterior lateral line nerves, in a similar position as in other early osteichthyans (Jarvik, 1980;
Chang, 1982; Giles and Friedman, 2014). An additional canal (mcv) exits the cranial cavity from the
midpoint of the cerebellum and enters the "trigemino-facialis chamber" at a steep angle
(Figure 5C). Due to its position and orientation, this is interpretated as the middle cerebral vein. The
jugular canal communicates with the "trigemino-facialis chamber" via an opening in the roof of the
canal (Figure 6B, com.V.jug), through which the middle cerebral vein and the maxillary branch of the
trigeminal nerve may have been transmitted (Basden and Young, 2001).

 The identity of the large foramen in the dorsal portion of the anterior pocket (Figure 4C, ap.f) is
hard to discern. Segmentation reveals a cavity that is continuous ventrally and dorsally with the
infraorbital canal, and may be related to the spiracle. The cavity is also connected with the otic nerve
anteriorly. The openings identified by Basden and Young, ([2001]: fig 2) ventral to this foramen do
not continue within the bone.
Further clarifications can be made to the identity of the large foramina on the lateral and ventral
face of the otic region (Figure 4). The canal ventral to the hyomandibular facet intersects the ventral
portion of the jugular canal and can be traced to the ventral otic fissure. It can be confirmed as the
hyomandibular trunk of the facial nerve (VIIhm; Basden and Young, 2001: figs. 2,3).
Young, 1979Dupret et al., 2017Maisey, 2005Maisey, 2007Maisey, 2005Maisey, 2007
The foramen identified by Basden and Young ([2001]: figs 2,3) as for the glossopharyngeal nerve
is in fact the posterior exit of the jugular canal (Figure 4B,F, jug.c); the glossopharyngeal nerve pre-
sumably exited through the otic-occipital fissure. Giles et al., 2015c
Ventral surface
As outlined by Basden and Young (2001), the internal carotids enter the braincase through two
foramina flanking the median hypophysial opening before giving off the efferent pseudobranchial
and ophthalmic artery (Figure 4B, epsb, Figure 4C, opha). As in chondrichthyans (Maisey, 2005;
Maisey, 2007), but unlike in osteichthyans (Chang, 1982; Gardiner, 1984) and placoderms
(Hu et al., 2017; Young, 1980), there is no evidence of a parabasal canal carrying the palatine artery
anterior to this point. Basden and Young (2001) identified grooves on the ventral surface of the
basisphenoid as for the lateral dorsal aorta. However, since these grooves are anterior to the effer-
ent hyoid artery we prefer to refer to them as the internal carotid arteries (Figure 4B, ica). Although
(Basden and Young [2001] : fig. 3) identified foramina for the palatine branch of the facial nerve
and the orbital artery in the roof of the canal for the internal carotid (their lateral dorsal aorta), the
roof appears to be complete.
Cranial endocast
A comparison of the two cranial endocasts is shown in Figure 7. Differences in appearance largely
relate to the presence of extensive rock matrix surrounding ANU V3628, in contrast to the acid-pre-
pared cranium of AM-F101607. The external walls of the endocranial cavity are largely complete in
both specimens, although as the parachordal plate of the braincase is not preserved the ventral
extent is uncertain. Overall, the endocast of ‘Ligulalepis’ is short and broad, particularly the otic
region (Figure 7A,B). The proportions occupied by different regions are similar to early chon-
drichthyans, with the forebrain section comprising less than 20% of the total length, the midbrain
section around 15%, and the hindbrain section some 65%.
Description of the endocast allows the identity of features within the cranial cavity to be revised.
A distinct depression in the roof of the cranial cavity, medial to the otic capsule, was considered by
(Zhu et al. ([2010], fig. 4c) to be evidence of a lateral cranial canal. This embayment is in fact the
crus commune of the anterior and posterior semicircular canal (Figure 4B). The groove anterior to
this is somewhat shallower in the braincase and indicates where the roof of the utricular region joins
the rest of the cranial cavity (the groove for anterior and posterior semicircular canals of Basden and
Young 2001: fig. 3).
Forebrain
The region of the endocast corresponding to the forebrain comprises space for the olfactory bulbs,
telencephalon and diencephalon. This region in ‘Ligulalepis’ is relatively wide (Figure 7A,B), compa-
rable to the forebrain in placoderms such as Macropetalichthys (Stensio
¨, 1963a) and chon-
drichthyans such as Orthacanthus (Schaeffer, 1981). However, it is still only half the width of the
cerebellum. The short, wide olfactory tracts leave the anterolateral corners of the telencephalic
region in separate tracts and connect to the bulbous nasal capsules, preserved in ANU V3628
(Figure 7B, n.cap). The short olfactory tracts are similar to those of placoderms, for example Bucha-
nosteus (Young, 1979) and Kujdanowiaspis (Stensio
¨, 1963a), as well as chondrichthyans such as Cla-
dodoides (Maisey, 2005) and Orthacanthus (Schaeffer, 1981), but also some sarcopterygians such
as Tungsenia (Lu et al., 2012a2012) and Qingmenodus (Lu et al., 2016). A small canal for the

 terminal nerve (0) exits from the anterior face of the forebrain, between the olfactory tracts, in AM-
F101607.
The telencephalon is the widest and highest portion of the forebrain. At its widest point it meas-
ures 6 mm in AM-F101607. It is developed into slight lobes dorsolaterally; these may represent
olfactory bulbs (Figure 7A, olf.b). The dorsal roof of this region is preserved in ANU V3628, as is the
canal to the pineal opening (Figure 7B,D, pin). The oblique crack across ANU V3628 intersects the
pineal opening, so it is unclear whether or not a parapineal organ was present. The margin between
the telencephalic and diencephalic regions is marked by a gentle constriction in the endocranial
cavity.
The region of the endocast corresponding to the diencephalon is short and narrow in dorsal view.
Ventrally, the diencephalic region extends to the floor of the cranial cavity, being continuous with
the hypophyseal fossa (hyp), and projects posteriorly some way under the mesencephalon
(Figure 7C). This region is unfinished posteriorly, and it is unclear whether a saccus vasculosus was
present as in actinopterygians (Giles and Friedman, 2014). The lateral wall of the diencephalic
region of the endocast is unfinished for the eyestalk attachment area in AM-F101607 (Figure 4C,D;
this area is not preserved in ANU V3628). The optic nerves (II) enter the orbit through a large fora-
men at the anterolateral limit of the diencephalon (Figures 6A and 7C). Beneath this opening, a ver-
tical ridge on the side of the hypophysial chamber likely shows the course of the internal carotid
artery after it enters the braincase. The efferent pseudobranchial artery joins the internal carotid at
the point of entry into the braincase (Figure 4B, epsb, f.ica), and internally the ophthalmic artery
branches from the same point and enters the orbit (Figure 5D, opha). The hypophysis is oriented
ventrally, in agreement with the generalised osteichthyan condition (e.g. Youngolepis: Chang, 1982;
Mimipiscis: Giles and Friedman, 2014), but unlike the posterodorsally-oriented hypophysis seen in
Cladodoides (Maisey, 2005).
Midbrain
Posterior to the diencephalic portion of the endocast, the region corresponding to the midbrain
(mesencephalon) widens slightly in AM-F101607. The midbrain cavity is not differentiated into sepa-
rate recesses for each optic lobe (Figure 7A, opt.l), which appears to be the general gnathostome
condition. There are similarly slight bulges in chondrichthyans (e.g. Cladodoides, Xenacanthus),
whereas highly distinct optic lobes are seen in actinopterygians crownward of Mimipiscis
(Coates, 1999; Giles and Friedman, 2014). A narrow, dorsally positioned canal leaves the cranial
cavity and enters the orbit (Figure 5A–C, IV). This foramen was illustrated, but not identified, by
Basden and Young [2001]: fig. 2b, the opening posterior to that labeled IV and dorsal to the eye-
stalk). The position of the canal strongly suggests it housed the trochlear nerve (IV), given a similar
placement in crown gnathostomes (Chang, 1982; Giles and Friedman, 2014; Maisey, 2005). More
ventrally, the oculomotor (III) nerve leaves the midbrain and enters the orbit (Figure 5A,C); there is
no evidence that this nerve bifurcated along its course. The oculomotor nerve does not typically
bifurcate in chondrichthyans (e.g. Cladodoides, Maisey, 2005) or sarcopterygians (e.g. Eusthenop-
teron, Jarvik 1980; Youngolepis, Chang 1982, ), and is variably developed in actinopterygians such
as Mimipiscis (Giles and Friedman, 2014) and Lawrenciella (Hamel and Poplin, 2008).
Hindbrain
The hindbrain is the widest portion of the endocast and would have housed the metencephalic and
myelencephalic brain regions in life. The cerebellum extends anterior to the labyrinth (Figure 7A,B,
cer), as in chondrichthyans (e.g. Cladodoides, Maisey, 2005) and, to a lesser extent, sarcopterygians
(e.g. Eusthenopteron, Jarvik 1980). Although the dorsal surface bears a slight suggestion of two
lobes, these can hardly be compared to the distinct cerebellar auricles of actinopterygians such as
Mimipiscis (Giles and Friedman, 2014). Similarly, there is no obvious protrusion housing the cerebel-
lum corpus.
The profundus nerve (prof) leaves the cranial cavity separately from the trigeminal nerve (V) and
enters the orbit (Figure 6A). Northcutt and Bemis, 1993 made a case that the profundus should be
considered a separate nerve rather than a branch of the trigeminal, based on developmental evi-
dence and the separation of these nerves in chondrichthyans, early actinopterygians and Latimeria.
The cranial nerve configuration seen in ‘Ligulalepis’ adds to a growing body of evidence from fossil

 endocranial studies that the separation of the trigeminal and profundus nerves is indeed the plesio-
morphic state for crown gnathostomes (Chang, 1982; Giles and Friedman, 2014; Maisey, 2005).
Posterior to the cerebellum, the dorsal part of the hindbrain narrows and drops in height, before
the endocast broadens again at the midpoint of the labyrinth. The entire dorsal surface of the hind-
brain is smooth, and does not rise as high dorsally as the crus commune of the anterior and posterior
semicircular canals (Figure 7C, cc). The posterior dorsal fontanelle is trapezoidal in outline
(Figure 7A, pdf). A ridge on the dorsal surface at the lateral edge of the hindbrain may indicate the
path of the endolymphatic ducts within the cranial cavity into the posterior dorsal fontanelle
(Figure 4B, g.dend).
ANU V3628 appears to have a lateral cranial canal (Figure 7B,D, lcc?), as in actinopterygians
(Giles et al., 2018). Basden and Young ([2001]: Fig. 3) identified a groove for the posterior cerebral
vein in AM-F101607, in a corresponding position to a similar groove in Mimipiscis and Moythomasia
(Gardiner, 1984). In ANU V3628, the dorsal part of this groove contains a large foramen, most
clearly developed on the left side (Figure 8C,D), in the same position to the opening for the lateral
cranial canal in Moythomasia (Gardiner, 1984, fig. 27) and Mimipiscis (Gardiner, 1984, fig. 11). Seg-
mentation reveals that this foramen opens into a large unossified space (Figure 8E), as expected for
a lateral cranial canal (Gardiner, 1984; Patterson, 1975), although this cavity does not have a con-
tinuous perichondral lining.
However, the situation regarding a lateral cranial canal in AM-F101607 is less clear. Basden and
Young (2001) identified foramina in the posterior cerebral vein groove, and identified them as ante-
rior tributaries of the posterior cerebral vein. Although the foramina on the left hand side are indeed
small (Figure 8B), on the right hand side there is a larger, more distinct foramen in the same position
(Figure 8A). However, there is no obvious connection between the unossified space and the dorsal
part of the lateral endocranial wall, and furthermore this cavity appears interconnected with much of
the remaining interperichondral space in the otic region of the braincase. The lateral cranial canal
may have been variable in its development, as has been suggested for Mimipiscis (Gardiner, 1984).
It seems likely, however, that the foramina in ANU V3628 are far too large to be identified as
tributaries of the posterior cerebral vein. As the occipital portion of the braincase is missing, the pos-
terior extent of the hindbrain cannot be described.
Labyrinth
The labyrinth region in ‘Ligulalepis’ is well preserved in AM-F101607 (Figure 7A,C), with three com-
plete, slender semicircular canals present, and all carrying small expansions for ampullae.
The anterior semicircular canal (asc) is anteroposteriorly long, but does not extend far ventrally. In
contrast, the posterior semicircular canal (psc) is tall dorsoventrally, but anteroposteriorly very short.
A short portion of preampullary canal separates the posterior ampulla from the cranial cavity. The
posterior semicircular canal curves back underneath the external semicircular canal (esc) to meet the
cranial cavity far ventrally. This ventral position of the posterior canal is reminiscent of that in placo-
derms (e.g. Dicksonosteus; Goujet, 1984), chondrichthyans (Schaeffer, 1981; Maisey, 2007), early
sarcopterygians (e.g. Youngolepis; Chang, 1982) and, to a slightly lesser extent, in the early actino-
pterygian Mimipiscis (Giles and Friedman, 2014).
Strikingly, the external canal is positioned obliquely at an angle of about 30 degrees from the cra-
nial cavity, and completes nearly a full circle before re-entering the vestibule (Figure 7A,C). The pos-
terior connection with the cranial cavity is swollen, almost giving the appearance of an ampulla like
that at the anterior extent of the canal (ext.amp).
Other notable features of the vestibular system are the relatively shallow superior sinus
(Figure 7C, s.su) situated below the crus commune, seen elsewhere in Cladodoides, Youngolepis
and Kansasiella (Chang, 1982; Maisey, 2005; Poplin, 1974), but not in Mimipiscis (Giles and Fried-
man, 2014) or Acanthodes (Davis et al., 2012). As well as the crus commune, a portion of the sinus
superior, anterior and posterior semicircular canals project dorsally above the endocranial roof. The
same condition is found in chondrichthyans and early actinopterygians (Giles and Friedman, 2014).
Although incompletely known ventrally, the sacculus is not laterally extensive and appears to
have been shallow (Figure 7C, sac). The general morphology of the labyrinth, including the dorso-
ventrally extensive posterior canal, which projects above the endocranial roof as well as below the
cerebellar floor, and the inclined external canal, recalls that of an early chondrichthyan such as

 Cladodoides (Maisey, 2005) or perhaps even Acanthodes (Davis et al., 2012). The labyrinth is far
removed from that seen in Mimipiscis (Giles and Friedman, 2014), or sarcopterygians such as
Eusthenopteron and Devonian lungfishes (Clement and Ahlberg, 2014; Clement et al., 2016; Jar-
vik, 1980). No otoliths were recovered from the specimen, although their absence is most likely due
to either a failure to be preserved or a consequence of acid preparation.
A life reconstruction of ‘Ligulalepis’ based on the skull morphology of AM-F101607 and ANU
V3628 (other features remain hypothetical) is presented in Figure 9.
Phylogenetic analysis
AM-F101607 and ANU V3628 were coded into an updated phylogenetic analysis modified from
Lu et al., 2017. As well as changes to anatomical scores for ‘Ligulalepis’, codes for several taxa were
updated and some characters were deleted or reformulated to give a total of 282 characters coded
for 94 taxa (for full details see the ‘phylogenetic methods’ section). This dataset was analysed using
both parsimony and Bayesian inference. The parsimony analysis retrieves Dialipina, ‘Ligulalepis’, and
‘psarolepids’ as successively branching sister taxa to the osteichthyan crown node (Figure 10A).
However, support for the clade that comprises crown osteichthyans (as retrieved from this analysis)
is low, with Bremer support of 1 and a bootstrap of just 4. This is very weak support, although we
note that bootstrap values obtained from TNT are likely to be much more conservative than those
produced by PAUP*: bootstrap values in TNT are calculated from the strict consensus trees found in
each replicate (Goloboff et al., 2008), whereas PAUP* uses all the shortest trees from each repli-
cate, weighted by the reciprocal of the number of trees found in that replicate (Swofford, 2003).
There are six unambiguous character state changes on the branch leading to crown osteichthyans.
These are #78 (enameloid on teeth gained), #110 (shape of parashenoid splint shaped), #116 (olfac-
tory tracts long), #130 (eyestalk absent), #184 (median dorsal plate absent), #211 (dorsal fin spines
absent). Of these, only the olfactory tracts and eyestalk are known in ’Ligulalepis’.
Alternative phylogenetic placements under parsimony were tested using two constrained
searches, one with ‘Ligulalepis’ constrained within actinopterygians and another with ‘psarolepids’
constrained within sarcopterygians. A stem actinopterygian position for ‘Ligulalepis’ requires a single
additional step, and the grouping of ‘Ligulalepis’ and actinopterygians was found in 18% of the
bootstrap replicates. Enforcing this topology also resulted in ‘psarolepids’ being resolved as stem
sarcopterygians (Figure 10B). A single additional step is required to place ‘psarolepids’ on the sar-
copterygian stem, and this grouping is found in 16% of bootstrap replicates. When this grouping is
enforced it leads to ‘Ligulalepis’ falling into a polytomy with actinopterygians and sarcopterygians
(Figure 10B).
The Bayesian analysis retrieves ‘psarolepids’ on the sarcopterygian stem with moderately strong
support (pp = 0.94, Figure 11). ‘Ligulalepis’ is resolved as a stem osteichthyan in the 50% majority
rule tree (Figure 11), although the crown osteichthyan clade has weak support (0.61). However, an
actinopterygian position for ‘Ligulalepis’ has a posterior probability of 0.22.
Discussion
‘Ligulalepis’ and early osteichthyan phylogeny
‘Ligulalepis’ is recovered as a stem osteichthyan in the phylogenetic analysis, specifically as the sister
lineage to ‘psarolepids’ (Guiyu, Sparalepis, Psarolepis, Achoania) plus crown Osteichthyes (Figures 9
and 10). Dialipina is resolved as the sister taxon to all other osteichthyans. However, the placement
of ‘Ligulalepis’ as the earliest diverging stem actinopterygian requires only a single additional step,
and evidence for an actinopterygian affinity must be considered. Cranial features previously sug-
gested as linking ‘Ligulalepis’ with actinopterygians (Basden and Young, 2001) are now better con-
sidered to be general osteichthyan characters (e.g. dermal ornament) or of uncertain polarity (skull
roof pattern and overall structure). Of the three characters proposed by Lu et al., 2017 as uniting
ray-finned fishes inclusive of Meemannia, ‘Ligulalepis’ lacks two: posteriorly expanded tabulars
(supratemporals of actinopterygians) and a spiracular canal. The remaining character, presence of a
lateral cranial canal (Coates, 1999; Gardiner, 1984), is harder to assess. Primitively, the lateral cra-
nial canal connects with the endocavity through the loop of the posterior semicircular canal, but in
neopterygians it may connect with the cranial cavity anteriorly (e.g. ‘Caturus’, Rayner, 1948,

(e.g.
Acipenser,
Gardiner 1984). Patterson (1975) claimed that the symmetry and even the presence of this charac-
ter can vary between individuals of the same species – although investigation of several of Patter-
son’s specimens via CT scanning has identified only symmetrical lateral cranial canals (Giles et al.,
2018). In Mimipiscis the lateral cranial canal in some specimens can occupy the whole area between
the posterior and anterior semicircular canals, while in others be ‘little more than a pocket in front of
the posterior semicircular canal’ (Gardiner, 1984, pg. 242). Gardiner (1984) suggested that the lat-
eral cranial canal can be expressed simply in terms of the degree of ossification of the dorsal otic
region. The two specimens of ‘Ligulalepis’ seem to confirm this idea, with the development of a lat-
eral cranial canal variable between specimens, and the extent of the canal and perichondral lining
also variable within a specimen. The endocranium of Meemannia is known only from a single skull
specimen, so variability in development of the lateral cranial canal cannot be studied in this taxon.
Mechanical preparation of Meemannia may also have obscured aspects of lateral cranial canal anat-
omy. Moreover, an actinopterygian identification for ‘Ligulalepis’ is also at odds with the lack of
pore canal network.
Topology tests reveal that the relationships of these early osteichthyans are somewhat interde-
pendent, as constraining ‘Ligulalepis’ to the actinopterygian stem also leads to ‘psarolepids’ branch-
ing from the sarcopterygian stem, necessitating independant origins of a number of characters in
’psarolepids’ and non-osteichthyan gnathostomes (cf. Lu et al., 2017), and of tooth enamel in acti-
nopterygians and sarcopterygians. This is because characters that support a stem osteichthyan posi-
tion for ‘Ligulalepis’ (i.e. the presence of an eyestalk and short olfactory tracts) are also found in
Psarolepis and Achoania (Zhu et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2013) and only support a stem osteichthyan
position if all these taxa are recovered on the stem. Evidence for a stem osteichthyan position for
‘psarolepids’ is now accumulating, with characters such as dorsal fin spines, a median dorsal plate
and absence of tooth enamel supporting this relationship (Qu et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2009;
Lu et al., 2017). This in turn provides additional support for a stem osteichthyan position for
‘Ligulalepis’.
In summary, our current phylogenetic hypothesis is that ‘Ligulalepis’ is a stem osteichthyan. While
an actinopterygian affinity requires only one extra step, this position seems to be at odds with the
distribution of anatomical features amongst early osteichthyans.
‘Ligulalepis’, histology and the problem of associated material
The skulls investigated herein are not necessarily disqualified from belonging to the same animal as
the scales described for Ligulalepis (Schultze, 1968). However, we follow Giles et al., 2015c in
maintaining the position that disassociated material cannot be unequivocally attributed to the same
taxon. Scale material of Ligulalepis was described as actinopterygian on the basis of an anterodorsal
process on the scale, ‘ganoine’ ridges, and a narrow scale peg (Schultze, 1968; Schultze, 2016).
However, the distribution of these characters amongst osteichthyans has subsequently been com-
prehensively addressed by Friedman and Brazeau (2010). An anterodorsal process is primitive for
osteichthyans, and as the presence (and therefore relative width) of a peg cannot be assessed in out-
groups the polarity of this character is ambiguous. While ‘ganoine’ encompasses multiple character
states, some of which are general for osteichthyans (e.g. the presence of enamel, multiple layers of
enamel) the presence of superimposed layers of enamel applied directly to each other is known only
in actinopterygians. This indicates that Ligulalepis—that is the scale-based taxon—is an actinoptery-
gian, at odds with the osteichthyan identification of ‘Ligulalepis’—that is the cranium-based taxon. A
scale-based Ligulalepis is still problematic, however, as constituent species are erected on the basis
of widespread (and often plesiomorphic characters) and span from the Ludlow of China (Wang and
Dong, 1989) to the Emsian of Australia (Schultze, 1968).
The tooth and jaw fragment attributed to Ligulalepis recently figured by (Schultze, 2016, fig. 13)
presents an additional problem. A vertical thin section through the tooth clearly shows an acrodin
tip. Acrodin is a highly mineralized capping tissue restricted to actinopterygians crownward of Cheir-
olepis (Friedman and Brazeau, 2010). It is unclear which characters were used to identify this speci-
men as Ligulalepis, but it most likely does not belong to the same taxon as the skulls investigated
herein. Furthermore, this tooth comes from a different fossil site (Troffs Formation, Trundle Group,
Mid-Pragian-Lower Emsian of New South Wales) than the skulls described in this study. As both the

 scales and jaw possess actinopterygian characters, it is possible that they belonged to the same
taxon. However, in keeping with our protocol of not referring unassociated specimens (at least in
the absence of clear apomorphic characters), we hesitate to support a Ligulalepis identity for the jaw
specimen.
Materials and methods
Materials
This study involves the incomplete skull of ‘Ligulalepis’ AM-F101607, which was previously described
(Basden and Young, 2001; Basden et al., 2000), and a new specimen, ANU V3628, discovered by
Ben King in late 2015. Both specimens came from the limestone outcrops on private land (Cathles’
‘Cooradigbee’ property) at the southern end of Goodradigbee Inlet, Wee Jasper, New South Wales,
Australia. ANU V3628 was found in the Bloomfield Limestone Member of the Taemas Formation
near Rocky Flat, and AM-F101607 was probably from a similar horizon, possibly at Caravan Point
about 300 m to the north, although precise locality and horizon were not recorded for this specimen
(although most likely from the Emsian pireneae-serotinus condont zone). ANU V3628 was found in a
large limestone block which was trimmed with an angle grinder. The specimen was then bathed for
approximately 2 hr in 5% acetic acid. The exposed bone was embedded in resin, and the block was
trimmed further with an angle grinder. The specimen was then given a number of acid baths in 5%
acetic acid whilst suspended upside down from a retort stand. After the skull roof became visible,
further baths at progressively lower acid concentration were performed with the specimen fully
immersed. Later acid baths were buffered using spent acid. Exposed bone was hardened with paral-
oid at intervals.
Micro-computed tomography scanning and visualisation
AM-F101607 was scanned at the Australian National University (ANU) High Resolution Micro X-ray
Computed Tomography facility (Sakellariou et al., 2004) with a resultant scan resolution of 30.4
microns (SI:1). ANUV3628 (SI:2) was scanned at Adelaide Microscopy on a Skyscan 1076. Specimen
to source distance was 121 mm, camera to source distance was 161 mm. Source voltage was 100kV,
and current 100 mA. 393 projections were taken on a Hamamatsu Orca-HRF camera. The resultant
voxel size was 8.5 microns. Three-dimensional modeling and segmentation was completed using the
software VGStudio Max, version 2.2 (Volume Graphics Inc., Germany), and Mimics 18.0 (Materialise
Medical Co, Belgium). Drishti version 2.6 (Limaye, 2012) and Blender (blender.org; Stitching Blender
Foundation, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) were also used for presentation purposes. Both CT data-
sets are available as Supplementary Information.

Phylogenetic methods
The character matrix used was based upon the dataset of Lu et al. for their recent work on Ptyctole-
pis, which contained 278 characters and 94 taxa (Lu et al., 2016a). ‘Ligulalepis’ was coded from the
two skulls only; scale characters were not included.
Based on new information from the scans, the coding for character #31 (Sensory canals/grooves)
was updated from state 0 (within thickness of skull bones) to state 1 (prominent ridges on visceral
surface of skull bones). Seven other characters previously unknown in ‘Ligulalepis’ were coded for
the first time: #41, Pineal opening in dermal skull roof (present); #47, Number of bones of skull roof
lateral to postparietals (two); #132, Canal for jugular in postorbital process (present); #152, External/
horizontal semicircular canal (joins the vestibular region dorsal to posterior ampulla); #259, Position
of anterior nostril (facial); #261, Three large pores associated with each side of ethmoid (absent);
#263, Size of profundus canal in postnasal wall (small).
We clarified the definition of character #115 to refer only to presence or absence of dermal bone
separating the nostril and orbit. Previously, the definition of this character simply referred to ‘associ-
ation’ or ‘confluence’ of the nostril and the orbit, but this is not entirely satisfactory in the case of
‘Ligulalepis’ where the nostril directly enters the orbit, but the dermal bones around the external
opening are not completely known. A new character was introduced to reflect the different condi-
tions of the endoskeleton around the posterior nostril. This was character #281 endoskeletal lamina
(postnasal wall) separating posterior nostril and orbit: 0 (absent); 1 (present). Another new character
was introduced concerning the pituitary vein, following Castiello and Brazeau, 2018. This was char-
acter #282 pituitary vein canal: 0 (discontinuous, enters endocranial cavity); 1 (discontinuous, enters
hypophysial chamber); 2 (continuous transverse canal).
Other minor changes were #240 from one to inapplicable for Cladoselache, Climatius and Cobe-
lodus. State 1 of character #267 (endoskeletal spiracular canal: partial enclosure or spiracular bar)
was changed to (spiracular bar), to avoid grey areas as to what constitutes ‘partial enclosure’. Ray-
nerius was recoded as state 0 (open), and Cheirolepis as 0/1 (open/spiracular bar) due to uncertainty
interpreting the crushed specimen (Giles et al., 2015a). One character (trigemino-facial recess pres-
ent/absent) was deleted following King et al., 2017.
One skull roof character (Lu et al., 2017) character 43: Series of paired median skull roofing
bones that meet at the dorsal midline of the skull) was reformulated into four: #277, Postparietals/
centrals (0 absent/1 present); #278, Condition of postparietals/centrals (0 meet in midline/1 do not
meet in midline/2 single median bone); #279, Parietals (0 absent/1 present), and #280, Condition of
parietals (0 meet in midline/1 do not meet in midline).
The final matrix comprises 282 characters (see SI 3), scored for the same 94 taxa as Lu et al.,
2017. Multistate characters were treated as unordered except for numbers 63, 125, 164, 260, 262
and 266. Parsimony analysis was performed in TNT v1.5 (Goloboff and Catalano, 2016). Analyses
initially used new technology search for 1000 replications, using ratchet, tree fusing, sectorial search
and drift search algorithms with default settings. TBR branch swapping was then performed on the
resulting trees to explore the tree islands more thoroughly. A total of 1936 trees (using collapsing
rule 1) of length 818 were found, and the strict consensus tree was saved. Gnathostomes (i.e. all
taxa except Galeaspida and Osteostraci) were constrained to be monophyletic, and trees were
rooted on Galeaspida. Bremer support values were calculated through a series of tree searches each
with a negative constraint on a node in the strict consensus tree. Each of these constrained searches
used the same new technology search settings as for the main analysis, for 200 replications. Boot-
strap values were calculated using 1000 bootstrap replications. Within each bootstrap replication,
the same new technology search settings as above were used, for 100 random addition sequence

 replications. A list of apomorphies was produced using ACCTRAN for one of the shortest trees using
PAUP* (Swofford, 2003). All scripts for all analyses are included in the supplementary information
(see SI 3).
Bayesian analysis was performed in MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al., 2012). The same set of char-
acters was ordered. The MkV model (Lewis, 2001) was applied, with a gamma parameter to account
for rate variation across characters. Four independent analyses were run (each with four chains) for
10 million generations. Convergence of the four runs was confirmed by standard deviation of split
frequencies less than 0.01 and effective sample size greater than 1000 for all parameters.
