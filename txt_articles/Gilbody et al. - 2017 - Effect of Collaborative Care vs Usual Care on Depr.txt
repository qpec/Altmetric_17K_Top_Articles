40 
Question: Is collaborative care an effective method to reduce depressive symptoms in older people 
41 
with low severity depression? 
42 
 
43 
Findings: : In the CASPER randomized trial of 705 participants age 65 and older with sub-threshold 
44 
depression, those randomized to a collaborative care intervention had lower depression scores, 
45 
measured by the Patient Health 9-item questionnaire at 4 month follow-up, compared to usual care.   
46 
 
47 
Meaning: Among older adults with subthreshold depression, a collaborative care intervention 
48 
reduced depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up, compared to usual care. The long term efficacy 
49 
of this intervention is unclear.

ABSTRACT (350 words) 
52 
Importance:  There is little evidence to guide management of depressive symptoms in older people.   
53 
Objective: To evaluate whether a collaborative care intervention can reduce depressive symptoms 
54 
and prevent more severe depression in older people.   
55 
Design, Setting, Participants: Randomized clinical trial, conducted from 24th May 2011 to 14th Nov 
56 
2014 in 32 primary care centers in United Kingdom.  705 participants aged 65 and over with DSM-IV 
57 
sub-threshold depression were randomized (1:1).   
58 
Intervention: Collaborative care was coordinated by a case manager who assessed functional 
59 
impairments relating to mood symptoms.  Participants were offered behavioural activation and 
60 
completed an average of 6 weekly sessions.  The control group received usual primary care. 
61 
Main Outcomes: Participants were followed up for 12 months.  Primary outcome was self-reported 
62 
depression severity at 4 month follow-up,  measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item 
63 
(PHQ-9, range 0-27).  Included among 10 pre-specified secondary outcomes were the PHQ 9 score at 
64 
12-month follow-up and the proportion meeting criteria for depressive disorder (defined as PHQ9 
65 
score >/= 10) at 4 and 12 month follow-up. 
66 
Results:  705 participants were randomised (344 intervention vs 361 usual care) ( 58% female, mean 
67 
age 77 (SD 7.1)).  4 month retention was 83% with higher loss to follow-up in collaborative care 
68 
(82/344 - 24%) compared to usual care (37/361 - 10%  ).  Collaborative care resulted in lower PHQ-9 
69 
scores as compared to usual care at four month follow-up (mean PHQ-9 collaborative care: 5.36; 
70 
mean usual care: 6.67; mean difference: -1.31, 95% CI: -1.95 to -0.67, p<.001).  Treatment 
71 
differences remained at twelve months (mean PHQ-9 collaborative care = 5.93, mean PHQ-9 usual 
72 
care = 7.25; mean difference: -1.33 points, 95% CI: -2.10 to -0.55).  The proportions of participants 
73 
meeting criteria for depression at four month follow-up were 17.2% (45/262) vs 23.5% (76/324), 
74 
respectively (difference = -6.3%. 95%CI -12.8, 0.2, Relative Risk 0.83, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.27, p=0.247) 
75 
and at 12-month follow-up were 15.7% (37/235) vs. 27.8% (79/284) (difference = -12.1%, 95%CI -
76 
19.1, -5.1, Relative Risk 0.65, 95%CI 0.46 to 0.91, p=0.013). 
77 
Conclusion and Relevance: Among older adults with sub-threshold depression, collaborative care 
78 
compared with usual care resulted in a statistically significant difference in depressive symptoms at 
79 
4-month follow-up, of uncertain clinical importance. Although differences persisted through 12 
80 
months, findings are limited by attrition, and further research is needed to assess longer-term 
81 
efficacy.

BACKGROUND 
88 
Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide.(1)  One in seven older people meet 
89 
criteria for depression (2).  Effective therapeutic strategies are needed in older people with 
90 
depressive symptoms who also have comorbid diseases and impaired quality of life.(2)(3)(4)  There is 
91 
limited research about older people with mild depressive disorders who have insufficient levels of 
92 
depressive symptoms to meet diagnostic criteria (called ����-���������� ����-���������� �� ����-
93 
���������� ����������� (5) but also reduced quality of life and function.(4)  Sub-threshold 
94 
depression is a risk factor for more severe depressive illness.(6)  With increased interest in 
95 
preventive approaches to depression (7), trials have focused on adults with sub-threshold 
96 
disorders.(8)  The focus of this research was older people with low level depressive symptoms.  
97 
 
98 
The prescription of anti-depressants is not recommended as a first line treatment for sub-threshold 
99 
depression since there is little evidence they are effective.  Psychological therapies may be more 
100 
appropriate, but higher intensity forms of therapy such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, 
101 
Interpersonal Therapy or Behavioural Activation (BA) are generally reserved for people with more 
102 
severe disorders.(9)  Collaborative care involves the provision of care by a trained case manager 
103 
under the principles of chronic disease management.(10)  A meta-analysis reported that 
104 
collaborative care is effective for people with depression meeting diagnostic thresholds (11), but its 
105 
ability to prevent depression in high risk populations has not been examined.  The objective of this 
106 
study was to evaluate the effect of a collaborative care intervention in older people with sub-
107 
threshold depression in a UK primary care setting.   
108 
 
109 
METHODS 
110 
This trial was a pragmatic, multi-centre, two-group, parallel, randomized clinical trial.  Older adults 
111 
with lower severity depressive symptoms recruited in primary care were randomized to receive 
112 
either usual care from their primary care physician or a collaborative care intervention in addition to 
113 
their usual primary care. 
114 
 
115 
Recruitment of participants and eligibility criteria 
116 
This study was approved by the NHS Leeds East Ethics Committee on 28 September 2010 
117 
(10/H1306/61).  Participants age 65 and older from 32 primary care practices gave written informed 
118 
consent between March 2011 and July 2013 in the North of England, UK.  Prior to the definitive trial 
119 
an internal pilot was conducted with 100 participants where the age of participants was 75 years and 
120 
above.  The age cut point was reduced from 75 to 65 following advice from the Trial Steering 
121 
 CASPER JAMA revised 16th January 2017 
 
5 
 
Committee to align the trial population with an age-specific demarcation in the UK where patients 
122 
aged 65 and older are treated by ����� �������� ������ ������ ��������. 
123 
 
124 
Potential participants were identified by postal questionnaire and were eligible if they reported 
125 
depressive symptoms on a standardised brief 2 item case-finding tool (the Whooley questions - Q1: 
126 
Over the past month have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?  Q2: Over the 
127 
past month have you been bothered by having little or no interest or pleasure in doing things?) (12) 
128 
and were found to have sub-threshold depression according to DSM-IV criteria using the Mini 
129 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI v5.0) (13), conducted over the phone by researchers 
130 
trained by clinical co-investigators.  T�� ������������� P������ C��� P�������� excluded people with 
131 
known alcohol dependency; psychosis; recent suicidal risk; significant cognitive impairment; recent 
132 
bereavement or terminal illness on clinical grounds (based on their knowledge of the patient).  
133 
People receiving psychological therapy were excluded.  Participants receiving antidepressants 
134 
remained eligible.  Ethnicity was recorded by self-report to describe the diversity of participants.   
135 
 
136 
Randomisation, concealment and blinding 
137 
Participants were allocated to collaborative care or usual care by a computer in a 1:1 ratio by simple 
138 
randomization without blocking or stratification.  Treatment allocation was concealed from study 
139 
researchers at the point of recruitment using an automated computer data entry system, 
140 
administered remotely by the York Trials Unit which employed a computer-generated code.  None of 
141 
the participants, primary care practices or clinicians were blinded to treatment allocation.  
142 
Researchers who assessed outcomes were blind to treatment allocation.   
143 
 
144 
Intervention (collaborative care) and comparator (usual GP care) 
145 
Participants in the intervention group received a programme of collaborative care, designed 
146 
specifically for older people with sub-threshold depression and to accommodate long term physical 
147 
health problems (see (15) for an extended description).  Collaborative care was delivered by a case 
148 
manager (with a background in mental health nursing or a graduate psychologist) over eight weekly 
149 
sessions.(16)  The intervention consisted of telephone support and session by session symptom 
150 
monitoring to track treatment response.  The case managers were supervised and corresponded 
151 
with the primary care physician or older-age psychiatrist where necessary.  The first session was 
152 
delivered face-to-face and subsequent sessions via telephone.  A computer system was used to 
153 
monitor care and supervision of case managers was offered by DB, DF, DE, DM, JD and SG.  
154 
Participants were offered a structured programme of behavioural activation.(17)  This brief 
155 
 CASPER JAMA revised 16th January 2017 
 
6 
 
psychological intervention addressed the behavioural deficits of depression such as avoidance of 
156 
social interaction and the absence of rewarding activities.(18)  Participants already prescribed anti-
157 
depressants were encouraged to continue medication and primary care physicians were only 
158 
encouraged to initiate medication in response to increasing depressive symptoms.(9) 
159 
 
160 
Participants in the control group were allocated to receive usual primary care.  They received no 
161 
additional care to the usual primary care management of sub-threshold depression.   
162 
 
163 
Outcomes 
164 
The primary outcome was self-reported severity and symptoms of depression, assessed by the 
165 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9),(19) at four months.  The PHQ-9 has a score range 0 
166 
(least depressed) to 27 (most depressed).  Secondary exploratory outcomes included the PHQ-9 
167 
depression severity at 12 months; and at 4 and 12 months: dichotomised depression according to 
168 
�depression diagnosis�, defined using an optimum cut point of PHQ-9�10, which has been validated 
169 
as a sensitive and specific criterion for DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder.(19)  We also studied a 
170 
limited range of secondary exploratory outcomes of decrements and comorbidities associated with 
171 
depression, including health-related quality of life measured by the 12 item short form survey (SF-
172 
12) mental component scale and physical component scale, score range 0 (lowest level of health) to 
173 
100 (highest level of health) (20); anxiety, measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
174 
Assessment (GAD-7), score range 0 (no anxiety) to 21 (severe anxiety) (21) and self-reported 
175 
prescribed mental health medication.  Data were also collected on somatoform complaints, 
176 
measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 items (PHQ-15), score range 0 to 28 (higher scores 
177 
indicate greater physical impairment, item on menstrual problems was excluded) (22); and 
178 
psychological resilience, measured by the two-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC2) 
179 
which has a score range of 0 to 8, a higher score indicating greater psychological resilience (23), but 
180 
these were not statistically evaluated.  Questionnaires were administered by researchers blinded to 
181 
treatment allocation.  Resource use was ascertained from primary care records, and Quality 
182 
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were measured using the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L), score range 0 (death) to 1 
183 
(perfect health)(24) though the cost-effectiveness analysis is not reported here.  Death during 
184 
follow-up was pre-specified as an outcome and measured via linkage to mortality data from the UK 
185 
Office for National Statistics (ONS).  In our trial protocol we indicated that the number of falls would 
186 
be recorded, but we decided not collect these data before the first participant was randomised.   
187 
 
188 
Sample size 
189 
 CASPER JAMA revised 16th January 2017 
 
7 
 
In order to detect a small to medium standardised minimum effect size of 0.3 (based on a meta-
190 
analysis of previous trials of collaborative care,(25), corresponding to approximately 1.3 PHQ-9 score 
191 
points) with 80% power and a two-sided 5% significance level, 352 patients were required (176 in 
192 
each group).  Although this was an individually-randomised trial, the sample size was inflated to 
193 
account for potential clustering around case managers and potential loss to follow-up of 25%.  The 
194 
final sample size to be recruited was 658 patients, 329 in each group. 
195 
 
196 
Statistical analysis 
197 
Primary analysis: Patients were analysed as part of the group to which they had been randomised 
198 
(intention-to-treat) using a linear mixed model if they had valid primary outcome data at 4 or 12 
199 
months follow-up and a baseline PHQ-9 and SF-12 physical component score.  The primary analysis 
200 
model included as fixed effects: time (4 or 12 months), treatment group and time-by-treatment 
201 
interaction, adjusting for PHQ-9 depression at randomization and physical/functional limitations (SF-
202 
12 physical component score) at baseline.  The primary endpoint was the estimate of the 
203 
intervention effect at 4 months. 
204 
 
205 
Secondary exploratory Analyses of the Primary Outcome: To quantify the effect of the grouping by 
206 
case managers, these were modelled separately in each treatment group.  Additional variables 
207 
associated with PHQ-9 scores at 4 months (age, gender, GAD-7, PHQ-15, mental health medication 
208 
use and previous history of depression based on M.I.N.I. responses) were included as covariates in 
209 
the primary analysis model.  To investigate the effect of missing data on the treatment effect, any 
210 
baseline variables associated with non-response at four months follow-up (i.e. no valid PHQ-9 score) 
211 
were identified and included as covariates in the primary analysis model.  In light of the observed 
212 
differential dropout a multiple imputation model of the primary analysis was additionally included. 
213 
 
214 
Secondary exploratory Outcomes: Analysis of secondary outcomes was exploratory, and no 
215 
adjustments for multiple testing were applied.  The estimate of the effect of the intervention on 
216 
PHQ-9 scores at 12 months was extracted from the primary analysis model.  For the dichotomous 
217 
outcome of depression diagnosis� at follow-up (PHQ-9 � 10), data were analysed by logistic 
218 
regression with Poisson regression models to calculate adjusted relative risks.  For other exploratory 
219 
continuous secondary outcomes (SF-12, GAD-7), statistical analyses were conducted using a similar 
220 
model to the primary analysis.  Other collected data (PHQ-15 and CD-RISC2) were summarized 
221 
descriptively. 
222 
 
223 
 CASPER JAMA revised 16th January 2017 
 
8 
 
Analyses used two-sided significance at the 5% level, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons 
224 
were made.  All analyses were conducted in Stata version 13.1. The statistical analysis and reporting 
225 
of the trial followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial (CONSORT) guidelines.(26).  The 
226 
study followed a trial protocol and all analyses followed a pre-specified statistical analysis plan (see 
227 
online supplement for (i) our study protocol and (ii) a detailed description of statistical analysis, with 
228 
a description of any amendments to protocol).   
229 
 
230 
 
231 
RESULTS 
232 
37,134 patients from 38 primary care centres were invited to participate by letter between March 
233 
2011 and May 2013.  Of 6,693 patients who consented to be contacted and provided information 
234 
about depressive symptoms, 4,259 were excluded (largely on the basis of negative results on the 
235 
two-item depression screen), and 2,434 patients were assessed for eligibility by the MINI diagnostic 
236 
interview.  705 (29%) patients were identified to have sub-threshold depression and were 
237 
randomized into the trial; 58% female, mean age 77 (SD 7.1).  344 were allocated to collaborative 
238 
care and 361 to usual care.  The remaining patients were either classified as fulfilling no criteria for 
239 
depression (n=1,558, 64%) or as meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=171, 7%) 
240 
(see CONSORT diagram in Figure 1).  The primary outcome (PHQ-9 depression severity at 4 months) 
241 
was available for 586 patients, representing a loss to follow-up of 16.9% (23.8% in the collaborative 
242 
care group and 10.2% in the usual care group).  At 12 month follow-up, 519 patients were retained, 
243 
with loss to follow up of 26.4% at 12 months (31.7% in the collaborative care group and 21.3% in the 
244 
usual care group). 
245 
 
246 
 
247 
<Figure 1> CONSORT diagram 
248 
 
249 
The two groups were comparable at baseline (Table 1).  The median depression severity in both 
250 
groups based on the PHQ-9 was 7,  consistent with a low severity depression.(19)  Prescription rates 
251 
of antidepressants were low at baseline (collaborative care 10%, usual care 14%).

Collaborative care was delivered by 18 case mangers (mean case load of 19.1 randomised patients).  
257 
Participants received on average six sessions (median: 7, minimum 1, maximum 15) over seven to 
258 
eight weeks, of which two were delivered face-to-face, and four were delivered over the phone.  The 
259 
average session duration was half an hour.

Depression severity at follow-up 
263 
At  four month follow-up (primary outcome)  there was a between-group difference of -1.31 PHQ-9 
264 
score points (95% CI: -1.95 to -0.67, p<.001) equivalent to a standard effect size of 0.3 in favour of 
265 
collaborative care.  At 12 month follow-up (exploratory outcome) a between group difference 
266 
remained (-1.33 PHQ-9 score points; 95% CI: -2.10 to -0.55, p=.001).  See Table 2 for full results, 
267

Adverse events - mortality 
310 
A total of 23 participants died during 12-month follow-up-, 5 patients in the collaborative care group 
311 
(1.5% of randomised patients) and 18 patients in the usual care group (5.0% of randomised patients) 
312 
which was statistically significant (1=6.97, p =.008).  All causes of death and their potential 
313 
relatedness to the trial treatment were assessed independently and presented to the Data 
314 
Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) in line with our procedures for serious adverse events.  
315 
Approximately 81% of deaths were categorised as unrelated to treatment, and 18% as unlikely to be 
316 
related to treatment.  The DMEC committee assessed that the recorded causes of death could not 
317 
be reasonably attributed to either the intervention or control treatment.  The exploratory observed 
318 
group difference in mortality is therefore treated as a chance result. 
319 
 
320 
DISCUSSION 
321 
The main finding from this randomized trial is that a collaborative care intervention reduced the 
322 
PHQ-9 score at four month follow-up, compared to usual care.  In secondary exploratory analyses, 
323 
the PHQ-9 score was also lower at 12-month follow-up in the collaborative care group, but high 
324 
attrition rates reduce confidence in this result.  For populations with case level depression a 
325 
successful treatment outcome has been defined as five points on the PHQ9.(28)  We did not observe 
326 
this magnitude of benefit in either group of the trial when comparing scores before and after 
327 
treatment, although this result would be anticipated given the lower baseline PHQ9 scores in 
328 
populations with subthreshold depression.  The between-group difference was 1.31 PHQ9 points 
329 
which is a small to medium effect size according to Cohen (9, 27) and consistent with the Cochrane 
330 
 CASPER JAMA revised 16th January 2017 
 
12 
 
meta-analysis of collaborative care(11), but is not large when judged against a clinical difference of 5 
331 
points advocated in more severe disorders (see (29)).  In additional secondary exploratory analyses, 
332 
collaborative care prevented the onset of depression diagnosis (as ascertained by the PHQ9) by 
333 
12.1% at 12 months, but was non-significant at 4 months in an exploratory analysis.   
334 
 
335 
The treatment of older people with subthreshold depression has been insufficiently studied.  The 
336 
results of the trial are consistent with other research regarding collaborative care for depression in 
337 
older people.(11, 17, 30)  However few studies to date have examined the effectiveness of 
338 
collaborative care in older people and explored the ability to prevent lower severity depression 
339 
symptoms progressing to the point of case level depression.  Behavioural activation is a relatively 
340 
simple type of treatment that could be taught to and administered by a wide range of health care 
341 
professionals.(31)   
342 
 
343 
We noted a reduction in mortality for people who received collaborative care, but independent case 
344 
by case review of deaths was not thought to be linked to the intervention.  This was an unexpected 
345 
finding and one which deserves further study in future trials.  We have considered the possibility 
346 
that people randomized to the control group were more unwell and that this might have influenced 
347 
the primary outcome.  We think this explanation unlikely since the numbers who died were small in 
348 
relation to the size of the trial and there was evidence of balance between groups at baseline on 
349 
measures of symptoms severity and quality of life.  We note that all secondary outcomes are also 
350 
exploratory.   
351 
 
352 
There were several limitations to the study.  First, the ascertainment of depression diagnosis was 
353 
exploratory and not ascertained using a standardised diagnostic interview (32)  Second, there was 
354 
differential retention and attrition between the two groups. Participants who wished to discontinue 
355 
the collaborative care intervention fully withdrew from the trial at the same time, including follow-
356 
up.  It is possible that participants who withdrew may have presented a different outcome profile to 
357 
those who continued, which may have biased the treatment effect.   Third, there was no follow-up 
358 
after 12 months. 
359 
 
360 
Conclusions and relevance 
361 
Among older adults with sub-threshold depression, collaborative care compared with usual care 
362 
resulted in a statistically significant difference in depressive symptoms at 4-month follow-up, of 
363 
uncertain clinical importance. Although differences persisted through 12 months, findings are 
364 
limited by attrition, and further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy.
