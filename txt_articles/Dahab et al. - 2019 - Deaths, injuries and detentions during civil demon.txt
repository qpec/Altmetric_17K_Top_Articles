Deaths, injuries and detentions during civil
demonstrations in Sudan: a secondary data
analysis
Maysoon Dahab1, Nada Abdelmagid2, Ahmed Kodouda3 and Francesco Checchi2*
Abstract
Background: Since December 2018, the latest wave of anti-government protests in Sudan has led to deaths,
injuries and detentions. We estimated the number of people killed and described patterns of deaths, injuries and
detentions up to 9 April 2019.
Methods: We tabulated data from three publicly available lists maintained by Sudanese civil society sources (the
Independent Movement, the Sudan Doctors’ Union and the “Lest We Forget” project), and applied to these a
capture-recapture statistical technique that models the overlap among lists to estimate the number of deaths not
on any list.
Results: We estimated that about 117 civilians were killed in demonstrations during the above period, a
considerably larger number than hitherto reported. Most decedents and injury victims were shot.
Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates the importance of real-time data on political violence collected by civil
society initiatives. The de facto Sudanese government should immediately cease attacks against peaceful civilian
protesters and put in place guarantees for their safety.

Background
The most recent wave of anti-government protests in
Sudan began on December 19, 2018 in Atbara and spread
to other major cities including the capital, Khartoum [1].
The demonstrations were initially against rising costs of liv-
ing but quickly escalated into calls for the National Con-
gress Party-led government to cede power. According to
various reports, security agencies responded with force, in-
cluding tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition [2]. At
the time of writing, a de facto military government had as-
sumed power.
Despite the previous government’s state of emergency
declaration and banning of rallies, protests and civil dis-
obedience continued, and reports of injuries, arrests and
killings of unarmed civilians accumulated [3]. The former
Government of Sudan confirmed that 29 people have died
in the course of the protests [4], but other reports suggest
the death toll is almost twice as high [5, 6]. There are also
reports of hundreds of injuries and arrests in connection
with the demonstrations [5–7].
At the time of writing, despite the lifting of a state of
emergency protests continued country-wide. We sought
to estimate the total number of civilians killed, and tabu-
late existing data on killings, injuries and detentions to
better characterise the extent and typology of violence
during the current wave of civil demonstrations in Sudan.
Methods
Data sources
We consulted three independent lists of people killed,
injured or detained in the protests nationally, as of 9
April 2019. The lists were shared publicly on social
media platforms and maintained by the Independent
Movement [8] (until 21 February 2019; later data ob-
tained from the organisation's public email, info@almus-
tagleen.org), the Sudan Doctors’ Union [9, 10] and an

 anonymous Google Site (“Lest We Forget”) [11] (note
that the dataset uploaded at the time of writing by "Lest
We Forget" contains fewer observations than when we
accessed it as of 28 February 2019; no explanation was
provided for this difference). Information in Arabic was
translated by the authors into English.
The Independent Movement, a Sudanese diaspora-led
organisation [8], compiles and publishes the names of
those killed or detained in Sudan since the 5 January 2018.
The names are obtained from open sources, primarily so-
cial media platforms, and verified through a network of
ground informants established in November 2017. Infor-
mants verify the names and incidents with the relatives,
friends or political party affiliates of those killed or
detained. The list is updated on a weekly basis.
The second list is maintained by the Sudan Doctors’
Union, a union revived in 2012 by doctors who were dissat-
isfied with the state of the public health system [7]. The
Union’s Central Committee of Sudan Doctors (CCSD) coor-
dinates medical care to injured protesters [12] and docu-
ments deaths and injuries associated with demonstrations,
compiled through first-hand notifications by Union mem-
bers working in health facilities across Sudan, as well as
through open sources (largely social media platforms). The
CCSD verifies information through its network of doctors
throughout the country. The names of those killed and in-
jured are regularly shared through the CCSD’s social media
pages.
Finally, “Lest We Forget” is an anonymous website [13],
created on 23 December 2018. The list compiles the
names of those killed from social media platforms and
cross-checks them from multiple open sources.
Analysis
To estimate total killings, we manually cleaned and re-
moved duplicates from all three lists and linked the re-
cords across lists based on name of the deceased, gender,
date, place and cause of death, and site of injury for those
shot dead. We excluded deaths of army or security
personnel from the analysis and two unidentified dece-
dents with insufficient details. As shown in Fig. 1, while all
three lists were available up to end February 2019, the In-
dependent Movement was the sole source available to us
up to 5 April, with the Doctors’ Union also reporting dur-
ing 6–9 April when a protest sit-in and related violence
unfolded in central Khartoum.
For the period up to end February, we used three-list
capture-recapture analysis [14] (multiple systems estima-
tion) with Bayesian Model Averaging to estimate the
true number of deaths. Briefly, this technique rests on
fitting statistical models to the observed overlap among
lists: model coefficients supply predicted values for each
xijk category, where i, j and k are 0–1 booleans that de-
note whether a death occurs in list i (Independent
Movement), j (“Lest We Forget”) and k (Sudan Doctors’
Union), whereas x is the number of deaths in that i,j,k
category (Fig. 1). We fit Bayesian log-linear Poisson
models with uninformative priors to the contingency
table formed by each possible xijk category. Independen-
tEight possible models can be fit depending on which in-
teractions among lists are assumed to exist (e.g. whether
being on listed by i alters the probability of being listed
in j, etc.) [15]. The predictions of each candidate model
can be used to compute m000, i.e. the estimated x000
(deaths that do not appear on any list), as

, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) provided by
the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the likelihood profile.
We computed the average m000 from all models as
m000 ¼ Pi¼K
i¼1 m000;i Pri where K is the total number of
models averaged over, i is one of these models and Pr is
the posterior probability of that model. We summed
m000 to deaths appearing on at least one list to compute
the total number of deaths. An annotated R statistical
code is included as Additional file 1. This general ap-
proach has been extensively used in human rights ana-
lysis to date, e.g. for estimation of killings during the
wars in Kosovo [16] and Timor Leste [17].
We summed to the above deaths the total reported by the
Independent Movement up to 5 April, the latter sub-period
total inflated to reflect the sensitivity (i.e. completeness) of
that source as estimated up to 5 April (see Results). For 6–9
April we used simple two-list capture-recapture estimation
[14], whereby
m00 ¼ x10x01
x11
, and added the resulting
sub-period estimate to the overall total.
For injuries and detentions, we merely compiled data
available from the Sudan Doctors’ Union and the Independ-
ent Movement respectively, and tabulated key variables.
Results
Overall, the three lists contained unique records for 104
decedents, with moderate overlap among them (Fig. 1).
The Table 1 shows the eight candidate models fitted to
the three-list data up to end February 2019, and the
resulting Bayesian Model Average, suggesting some 6
(95%CI 2–31) deaths were not captured by any list. This
estimate, added to the 69 deaths on any list, yields a
total estimated death toll of 75 (95% CI 71–100) up to
28 February 2019. Accordingly, the estimated sensitivity
of individual lists during this period was 73% (95% CI
55–78%) for the Independent Movement, 64% (95% CI
48–68%) for the “Lest We Forget” project and 60% (95%
CI 45–63%) for the Sudan Doctors’ Union, while all
three lists together captured some 92% (95%CI 69–97%)
of all deaths.
During 1 March to 5 April 2019, a further 14 deaths were
reported by the Independent Movement, while during 6–9
April two-list capture-recapture analysis suggested 2 un-
listed deaths occurred alongside 21 appearing on either or
both available lists (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the death toll over
the entire period is likely to be at least 112 (75 + 14 + 23),
or about 117 (75 + 14/0.73 + 23) if we assume the estimated
sensitivity of the Independent Movement source remained
constant up to 5 April, and adjust for this.
Of the 104 decedents reported by at least one list, 4
(4%) were female and 100 (96%) male, while at least 15
(14%) were aged below 18 years. Of 89 with a reported
cause of death, 66 (74%) were killed by gunshot (10 in the
head, eight in the chest, five in the abdomen, one in the
neck, one in the hip and the remainder in an unspecified
site); eight killed by an explosive device; six tortured while

 in detention; five suffocated by tear gas; and four run over
by security vehicles. At least two medical professionals
were reported shot while at work in hospitals.
The deadliest day of the protests was 20 December
2018 with 34 people killed, 25 in Al-Gadarif alone, the
latter being the city with the most killings (30/104 or
29%) after Khartoum State (55/104 or 53%). The Sudan
Doctors’ Union provided information on injuries gath-
ered from hospitals in Al-Gadarif between 19 December
2018 to 1 March 2019. Of the 24 individuals reported in-
jured, 22 (96%) were male. Among the 14 for whom the
cause of injury was reported, all but one (a policeman in-
jured by an exploding tear gas canister) were shot, seven
(53%) in the legs or thighs, two in the abdomen, two in
the head, two in the chest and one in the shoulder.
Data on people detained during demonstrations were
published by the Independent Movement up until 8 April
2019. Of 934 individuals listed in this database, 295 (32%)
were described as activists, 188 (21%) as politicians, 79
(9%) students, 68 (7%) medical professionals, 64 (8%) law-
yers, 61 (7%) journalists and 53 (6%) teachers. There were
151 female detainees (19%) and at least 6 minors.
Discussion
Our analysis suggests that a considerably larger than hith-
erto reported number of civilians were killed during protests
in Sudan, and that the different civil society-maintained lists
of decedents, while providing a precious record of time, per-
son and place patterns, should be analysed jointly in order
to estimate a credible total.
Though rapid and based on fragmentary data, our ana-
lysis also points to a consistent pattern of deaths and injur-
ies by firearm. However, other causes of mortality, notably
torture, were also reported. These data corroborate existing
evidence on intent to kill or harm by government-directed
security forces, and suggest countrywide, sustained use of
live ammunition against protesters. A large number of pro-
testers appear to have been detained, with professionals (in-
cluding doctors) making up a significant proportion. We
found no data on the current status of these detainees, but
others have reported systematic torture and abuse at deten-
tion facilities [18].
These patterns of killings, detention and torture
are similar to previous incidents of popular protests
in Sudan and elsewhere. During anti-austerity pro-
tests in 2013, the Government of Sudan reported an
official death toll of 85, while Sudanese civil society
organisations reported higher numbers, ranging from
170 to 230; most of those killed were shot while
some died in detention [19, 20]. Regionally, govern-
ments have employed similar tactics in response to
popular dissent. For example, during the January
2011
Egyptian
uprising,
some
840
people
were
killed, with reports of many protesters dying as a
result of shots fired to the upper body, including the
head or chest, and security forces driving into pro-
testers in armoured vehicles [21]. Demonstrations
that began over social security reforms in Nicaragua
in 2018 also met with excessive use of force and ar-
bitrary detentions, including reports of torture and
gunshot wounds [22]. While the government ac-
knowledged 195 deaths as of 3 August 2018, other
independent estimates varied from 317 to 450 [23].
A number of deaths amongst protesters were not re-
ported to official authorities due to fear of reprisal
or mistrust [24].
Limitations
Paucity of data describing individual deaths or injuries
prevented us from fully characterising the circumstances
of these events, inferring intentionality or attributing re-
sponsibility. Capture-recapture analysis is an established
method, but it is possible that none of the lists had suffi-
cient on-the-ground coverage to detect deaths in smaller
towns or outlying regions of Sudan. The technique relies
strongly on the accuracy of record linkage (we encoun-
tered no instances of equivocal records, e.g. similar
names). It also assumes independence among lists,
which in this analysis cannot be fully established, as
two of the lists (the Sudan Doctors’ Union and “Lest
We Forget” project) both consulted social media, the
former
not
exclusively;
however,
at
least
for
the
period up to 28 February 2019, our three-list analysis
explicitly allows for non-independence assumptions to
be relaxed by including models with between-lists
interaction terms. We could only apply this recom-
mended capture-recapture technique over a fraction
of the analysis period, possibly resulting in under- or
over-estimation of the period-wide death toll. More-
over, additional deaths among detained protesters may
have occurred that data sources were not (yet) aware
of, resulting in under-estimation. Lastly, our descrip-
tion of patterns in injuries and detentions relies on a
single source, which may not have captured the true
totals: these patterns should therefore be treated with
some caution.
Conclusions
This analysis of existing secondary data confirms
that lethal force has been used against civilian dem-
onstrators in Sudan, and suggests that a substantially
larger number of people may have been killed than
has so far been reported. The de facto Sudanese
government should immediately cease attacks against
peaceful civilian protesters and guarantee their safety
across Sudan, while releasing all remaining detainees

 and enabling access to free healthcare for any in-
jured protesters.
Civil society sources of data on killings and other
events are essential to produce adequate documentation
of potential crimes in such situations: these data collec-
tion initiatives should continue and be supported. Ap-
plying statistical analysis to such data is likely to become
a more frequently available option for rapid or real-time
estimation of political violence, as such data become in-
creasingly available, e.g. through social media. Such ana-
lysis can illuminate the extent of under-estimation in
death tolls reported widely by government, international
non-governmental organisations and media sources, and
establish more credible figures.
