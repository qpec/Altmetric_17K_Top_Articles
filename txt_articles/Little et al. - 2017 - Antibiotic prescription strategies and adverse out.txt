ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess the impact on adverse outcomes of different 
antibiotic prescribing strategies for lower respiratory 
tract infections in people aged 16 years or more.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
setting
UK general practice.
PartiCiPants
28 883 patients with lower respiratory tract infection; 
symptoms, signs, and antibiotic prescribing strategies 
were recorded at the index consultation.
Main OutCOMe Measures
The main outcomes were reconsultation with 
symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in the 30 
days after the index consultation, hospital admission, 
or death. Multivariable analysis controlled for an 
extensive list of variables related to the propensity to 
prescribe antibiotics and for clustering by doctor.
results
Of the 28 883 participants, 104 (0.4%) were referred to 
hospital for radiographic investigation or admission, 
or both on the day of the index consultation, or were 
admitted with cancer. Of the remaining 28 779, 
subsequent hospital admission or death occurred in 
26/7332 (0.3%) after no antibiotic prescription, 
156/17 628 (0.9%) after prescription for immediate 
antibiotics, and 14/3819 (0.4%) after a prescription for 
delayed antibiotics. Multivariable analysis 
documented no reduction in hospital admission and 
death after immediate antibiotics (multivariable risk 
ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.81, 
P=0.84) and a non-significant reduction with delayed 
antibiotics (0.81, 0.41 to 1.64, P=0.61). Reconsultation 
for new, worsening, or non-resolving symptoms was 
common (1443/7332 (19.7%), 4455/17 628 (25.3%), 
and 538/3819 (14.1%), respectively) and was 
significantly reduced by delayed antibiotics 
(multivariable risk ratio 0.64, 0.57 to 0.72, P<0.001) 
but not by immediate antibiotics (0.98, 0.90 to 1.07, 
P=0.66).
COnClusiOn
Prescribing immediate antibiotics may not reduce 
subsequent hospital admission or death for young 
people and adults with uncomplicated lower 
respiratory tract infection, and such events are 
uncommon. If clinicians are considering antibiotics, a 
delayed prescription may be preferable since it is 
associated with a reduced number of reconsultations 
for worsening illness.
Introduction
Acute uncomplicated respiratory tract infections are 
the commonest acute illnesses managed in primary 
care in developed countries, and substantial numbers 
of patients still receive antibiotic treatment.1-3  The 
GRACE (Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibi-
otics for Community acquired lower respiratory tract 
infection (LRTI) in Europe) trial in lower respiratory 
tract infection (n=2061) documented no clear benefit of 
antibiotics (hazard ratio for duration of “moderately 
bad” symptoms 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 
1.18),4  and the updated Cochrane review provided sim-
ilar estimates.5  Prescribing antibiotics incurs costs, 
increases reconsultation for subsequent episodes, med-
icalises self limiting illness,6 
7  and promotes antibiotic 
resistance, which is dominated by prescribing of antibi-
otics in primary care.8  However, both clinicians and 
patients worry about more severe or prolonged illness 
and complications,9  and clinicians fear medicolegal 
consequences.2 10-12 Evidence to reassure clinicians is, 
however, limited: the Cochrane review did not docu-
ment the impact of antibiotics on complications, and in 
the GRACE cohorts hospital admission or death 
occurred in fewer than 1% of patients who consulted, 
therefore large studies are needed.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
A Cochrane review identified trials showing modest impact of antibiotics on short 
term resolution of symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection but was unable to 
document major adverse outcomes
Two studies using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) suggest that 
the risk of pneumonia might be reduced by antibiotic prescribing
Most pneumonias can be readily treated in community settings without hospital 
admission, but neither GPRD study recorded the impact on major adverse outcomes 
such as hospital admission or death, nor could they control for confounding by 
indication
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
After controlling for the clinical propensity to prescribe antibiotics, it was not 
possible to show that prescribing immediate or delayed antibiotics reduced the 
major adverse outcomes of subsequent hospital admission or death
Such events occur less than 1% of the time, and even using the most optimistic 
estimate of benefit, 400 patients would have to be treated to prevent one death or 
admission
Patients commonly experienced non-resolving or new symptoms, and if clinicians 
are considering antibiotics a delayed prescription may be preferable, since unlike 
immediate antibiotics it is likely to be associated with statistically significant 36% 
reduction in this outcome

Trial data can be limited by external validity and sub-
stantially greater drug compliance compared with 
observational settings.13 14  Thus observational studies 
provide important evidence to complement trial data, 
but conversely have the disadvantage of confounding 
by indication. Therefore the impact of antibiotics 
should be assessed using techniques to control for the 
propensity to prescribe.15-17
We report the findings of an adequately powered 
observational study of lower respiratory tract infection 
in primary care using prospectively collected clinical 
data to assess the impact of antibiotics on adverse out-
comes such as reconsultations with non-resolving or 
new symptoms, hospital admission, or death.
Methods
A structured proforma was used to document clinical 
presenting features and management at the index con-
sultation. Review of medical records documented 
reconsultations with new or worsening illness, hospital 
admission, or death during the next 30 days.
The study took place in UK primary care. Participants 
were eligible if they were aged 16 years or more and had 
acute lower respiratory tract infection—defined as acute 
cough (new or worsening cough for three weeks or less) 
presenting as the main symptom and judged to be infec-
tive in origin by the doctor, consistent with the Cochrane 
review18  and previous studies.4 6 19-24 We excluded 
patients who had other causes of acute cough (eg, heart 
failure, acid reflux, fibrosing alveolitis), were unable to 
consent (eg, severe mental illness), were immunocom-
promised, had previously presented with the same epi-
sode of illness, or had been included previously.
Data collection
Clinical record form
Doctors completed a clinical record form in the consul-
tation, documenting age, smoking history, duration of 
symptoms, nature of symptoms (dry or productive 
cough, shortness of breath, coryza, fever, chills or shiv-
ering, chest pain, headache, muscle aches, sleep distur-
bance, confusion, diarrhoea, sputum colour), 
examination results (respiratory rate, pulse, blood pres-
sure, oxygen saturation, temperature, presence of 
wheeze, crepitations, or bronchial breathing), a rating 
of overall severity (visual analogue scale ranging from 
“well” to “very unwell”), and if antibiotics were pre-
scribed.
Outcomes (review of clinical records at 30 days)
The main outcome measures were reconsultation in pri-
mary care or visit to an emergency department with pro-
gression of illness (ie, with non-resolution of symptoms 
or new symptoms or signs)25 in the 30 days after the 
index consultation, hospital admission, or death.
Other data
Comorbidities noted in the medical records were also 
documented. Lung comorbidity included asthma, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or history of 
other important lung disease requiring hospital investi-
gation, and use of steroids or bronchodilators. Vaccina-
tion status (pneumococcal vaccination) was recorded.
Practice staff assessed the clinical records using a 
structured proforma.26 Most baseline data were cap-
tured by electronic data capture live during consulta-
tions, and the small proportion completed on paper 
was double entered. Data recorded on paper at fol-
low-up review were double entered. The patient’s post-
code was used to assign deprivation, based on the 
national deprivation index.
sample size
The target of 28 024 patients was designed to detect pre-
dictors of rare (1:200) outcomes, with an odds ratio of 3 
(α=0.01) and 80% power, among both those given anti-
biotics and those not given antibiotics. We also wanted 
to assess whether antibiotics reduced the number of 
uncommon outcomes: we assumed an antibiotic pre-
scribing rate of 50% and estimated that the cohort 
would have more than 80% power to detect a one third 
reduction of outcome after antibiotics (odds ratio 0.66) 
for outcomes occurring with a frequency of 1% or more.
statistical analysis
The primary analysis concerned those presenting ini-
tially with uncomplicated illness—that is, we excluded 
patients admitted to hospital on the day of the index 
consultation, admitted to hospital with cancer, and 
with pneumonia confirmed by radiography ordered on 
the day of the consultation. In the remaining cohort we 
assessed the impact of antibiotics using logistic regres-
sion, accounting for clustering by doctor and con-
trolling for any potential confounder of the association 
between prescribing strategy and outcome. Levels of 
missing data were mostly low: 76% of participants had 
complete data and 17% were only missing data on oxy-
gen saturation (see supplementary table). We assessed 
the possible change in the estimates if all the missing 
data were imputed with either all low values or all high 
values for oxygen saturation.
Covariates were dichotomised according to clinically 
meaningful cut-points. We assessed the impact of con-
trolling for all potentially relevant clinical and demo-
graphic variables collected at first presentation and 
also generated a model when just controlling for signif-
icant covariates (from backward fitting of the regression 
model, retaining all variables with P≤0.20). Relative 
risks were produced directly as the output from a gener-
alised linear model for the binomial family.27  We then 
performed an analysis using a stratified propensity 
score method,15-17 which involved stratifying partici-
pants by fifths into mutually exclusive subsets based on 
their estimated propensity score, which in this dataset 
achieved a good balance of covariates in each stratum, 
key to providing control of confounding. This enabled 
exploration of whether more rigorous control for 
 
confounding by indication would modify the estimates. 
We calculated each propensity score comparing each 
prescribing strategy with no initial offer of antibiotics 
(ie, immediate antibiotics with no antibiotics, and 
delayed antibiotics with no antibiotics).

Patient involvement
Since doctors’ clinical behaviour was our key focus, 
working general practitioners were involved in the 
design of the clinical record form and in interpreting 
findings. Patients were involved in agreeing constituent 
studies of the overall programme; advising about the 
patient information leaflets, consent forms, clinical 
record form, and outcomes; and participating regularly 
in study management meetings.
Results
The National Institute for Health Research Clinical 
Research Network invited doctors nationwide in the UK 
to participate. Patients were recruited in 522 general 
practices between October 2009 and April 2013 after 
informed consent had been obtained (see supplemen-
tary figure). The practice median index of multiple 
deprivation score was 20.8, similar to the national fig-
ure of 21.5 from Public Health England. Overall, 28 883 
patients had baseline and  
follow-up data available and 
28 779 (99.6%) had an initially uncomplicated illness at 
the index consultation. Of these, 7332 (25.5%) received 
no prescription for antibiotics, 17 628 (61.3%) received a 
prescription for immediate antibiotics, and 3819 (13.3%) 
received a prescription for delayed antibiotics (median 
advised delay 3 days, interquartile range 2-3 days) at the 
index consultation. There were no major differences in 
clinical characteristics between higher and lower 
recruiting practices (see appendix 1).
Patient characteristics
Major differences were found between antibiotic pre-
scribing groups for some variables, particularly assess-
ment of severity and lung findings. Participants 
prescribed immediate antibiotics were more likely to be 
older, have major comorbidities, and report more short-
ness of breath, fever, or purulent sputum, and the doc-
tor was more likely to record higher severity ratings, low 
oxygen saturation, and crepitations or wheeze (table 1). 
Participants given a prescription for delayed antibiotics 
were commonly intermediate for the signs and symp-
toms between immediate and no prescription groups.
Hospital admission or death after uncomplicated 
presentations
Subsequent hospital admission or death occurred in 
26/7332 (0.3%) after no antibiotic prescription, 
156/17628 (0.9%) after an immediate prescription, and 
14/3819 (0.4%) after a delayed prescription. Respiratory 
infections accounted for the greatest number of hospi-
tal admissions (n=131) and deaths (n=7), but cardiovas-
cular or cerebrovascular events (admissions n=19 and

deaths n=8) also occurred, in line with previous evi-
dence of outcomes after lower respiratory tract infec-
tion,28  as did other infections (n=12 and n=0) and a 
variety of other events such as collapse, dehydration, 
and acute renal failure (n=20 and n=4). Most hospital 
admissions were for respiratory infections: 18/26 (58%) 
after no antibiotic prescription, 102/142 (72%) after 
immediate antibiotics, and 11/14 (79%) after delayed 
antibiotics (table 2). No admitted participant had 
 
allergic reactions, but one had amoxicillin induced 
cholestasis.
When accounting for the propensity to prescribe 
there was no reduction in hospital admission and death 
after immediate antibiotics (multivariable risk ratio 
1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.81, P=0.84) and a 
non-significant reduction with delayed antibiotics 
(0.81, 0.41 to 1.64, P=0.61; table 3). For immediate antibi-
otics, adequate balance was obtained for covariates 
(see appendix 1), and for delayed prescribing the bal-
ance for most but not all covariates improved.
reconsultation with non-resolving or worsening 
symptoms
Reconsultation for new, worsening, or non-resolving 
symptoms was common: 1443/7332 (19.7%) for no anti-
biotics, 4455/17 628 (25.3%) for immediate antibiotics, 
and 538/3819 (14.1%) for delayed antibiotics. Delayed 
antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction 
in number of reconsultations (multivariable risk ratio 
0.64, 0.57 to 0.72, P<0.01) but not immediate antibiotics 
(0.98, 0.90 to 1.07
, P=0.97; table 4).
Potential bias due to missing data on oxygen 
saturation
The inferences were not changed either for reconsulta-
tions or for hospital admissions if missing values for 
oxygen saturation were imputed as either more than 
95% saturation or less than 95% saturation (see supple-
mentary table).
discussion
As far as we are aware this is one of the very few pro-
spective clinical cohorts with sufficient power to 
address the impact of antibiotic prescribing strategies 
on subsequent major adverse outcomes. Even in a 
cohort of 30 000 participants, it was not possible to 
show that either immediate or delayed antibiotics were 
associated with a significant reduction in subsequent 
hospital admission or death. Non-resolving symptoms 
or progression of the illness with new symptoms was 
common, and a delayed prescription but not immediate 
antibiotics were associated with a significant reduction 
in reconsultations with such symptoms.
strengths and limitations of this study
This study has several main strengths: 1) sufficient 
power to assess rare adverse outcomes owing to the size 
of the cohort; 2) high follow-up; 3) assessment of simi-
lar variables to previous trials and observational data-
sets4 
22 
29  and inclusion of the key drivers identified from 
qualitative work30 ; 4) study of routine consultations in 
everyday primary care to provide a large generaliseable 
cohort, using a simple clinical proforma to facilitate 
recruitment; 5) a nationwide practice sample with 
deprivation scores similar to national figures; 6) the 
diagnosis of chest infections using clinical criteria sim-
ilar to the Cochrane review18  and previous studies in 
primary care4 19 20 22 29 31 32 ; 7) clinical characteristics of 
included participants similar to those in previous trials 
and observational cohorts in primary care4 22 23 
 
 
(approximately 20% with lung comorbidity, 70% with 
coloured sputum, previous illness duration of one 
week); 8) assessment of complications using a highly 
structured notes review for high reliability26 ; and 9) the 
rate of complications after presentation of a similar 
magnitude to previous studies using routine data.2
Limitations were that patients were recruited at the 
busiest times of year, and as with other studies of acute 
infection14 
33  documentation of the details of those not 
approached was poor owing to time pressures (since 
time pressures to recruit also meant time pressure to 
document non-recruitment). No training was given in 
measuring clinical signs and we had no mechanism for 
quality assuring diagnostic skills, but conversely this 
means that these results are more generaliseable to the 
routine clinical setting. Although nearly 20% of partici-
pants had missing data for oxygen saturation, infer-
ences were not altered in the sensitivity analysis with 
imputed extreme values for missing data. Patients were 
not blind to their management and so knowledge of the 
receipt of antibiotics might have altered their threshold 
for consulting. Using stratified propensity scores 
resulted in important changes in the estimates: for 
immediate antibiotics adequate balance of covariates

was achieved, making residual confounding less likely. 
For delayed prescribing the balance of covariates did 
not improve for all variables so we may have underesti-
mated the impact of delayed prescribing on complica-
tions. We were also not powered to detect odds ratios 
greater than 0.66 for preventing complications. We did 
not measure reconsultations longer term, but there is 
reasonable trial evidence that both short and long term 
reattendance is reduced by delayed prescription.6

Comparison with previous research
We are aware of no large prospective cohort studies to 
have assessed the role of antibiotic prescribing strate-
gies in everyday primary care practice for major adverse 
outcomes. Doctors are clearly using signs and symp-
toms to guide prescribing decisions: patients with more 
severe illness are more likely to receive a prescription 
for an antibiotic and those with intermediate severity 
delayed prescribing, which matches the behaviour of 
doctors in upper respiratory tract infections.26 The find-
ing that subsequent hospital admission or death were 
not clearly reduced with delayed or immediate antibi-
otic prescribing could be due to inadequate control of 
confounding, but since we assessed a wide range of 
potentially confounding variables, a large impact of 
antibiotics seems unlikely. Even if we missed a small 
effect, subsequent major adverse events are uncom-
mon, and in this cohort more than 60% of participants 
received an immediate antibiotic. If we use the lower 
limit of the 95% confidence interval of the risk ratio for 
immediate antibiotics (0.63, ie, the most optimistic esti-
mate of effect from this data) then approximately 400 
people would still need to be treated to prevent one 
admission.
The major effect on reducing reconsultations for per-
sistent, new, or worsening symptoms with delayed anti-
biotics almost mirrors the results of the large DESCARTE 
(Decision rule for the Symptoms and Complications of 
Acute Red Throat in Everyday practice) cohort in sore 
throat, which helps support the likely validity of the 
findings.26  Although the estimates are compatible with 
the large GRACE trial in lower respiratory tract infec-
tion, the DESCARTE study found that prescribing imme-
diate antibiotics did slightly reduce the number of 
reconsultations, unlike the findings in the current 
cohort. The slight difference between these studies 
might relate to inadequate control of confounding by 
indication, or alternatively adherence: adherence is 
probably considerably worse for chest infections in rou-
tine settings13  than in the context of trials,4  hence the 
antibiotic dose and duration may have been suboptimal 
for participants in the current study, resulting in more 
prolonged symptoms. For delayed prescriptions the 
delay advised was much shorter than that in the trials,6 
 
hence, as in the DESCARTE cohort,26 it is likely that 
more than half will have used their delayed prescrip-
tion. It is unclear how delayed prescriptions work in 
reducing the number of reconsultations, but the delay 
allows more time for patients to decide whether symp-
toms have resolved or progressed, and the delayed start 
means that the course will also finish later when

symptoms are more likely to be settling, and hence 
patients will perceive less need to revisit the doctor.
Conclusion
Prescribing immediate antibiotics may not reduce sub-
sequent hospital admission or death for young people 
and adults with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract 
infection, and such events are uncommon. If clinicians 
are considering antibiotics, a delayed prescription may 
be preferable since it is associated with reduced num-
ber of reconsultations with worsening illness.
