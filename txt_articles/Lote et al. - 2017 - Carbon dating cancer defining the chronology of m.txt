Background: Patients often ask oncologists how long a cancer has been present before causing symptoms or spreading to
other organs. The evolutionary trajectory of cancers can be defined using phylogenetic approaches but lack of chronological
references makes dating the exact onset of tumours very challenging.
Patients and methods: Here, we describe the case of a colorectal cancer (CRC) patient presenting with synchronous lung
metastasis and metachronous thyroid, chest wall and urinary tract metastases over the course of 5 years. The chest wall metastasis
was caused by needle tract seeding, implying a known time of onset. Using whole genome sequencing data from primary and
metastatic sites we inferred the complete chronology of the cancer by exploiting the time of needle tract seeding as an in vivo
‘stopwatch’. This approach allowed us to follow the progression of the disease back in time, dating each ancestral node of the
phylogenetic tree in the past history of the tumour. We used a Bayesian phylogenomic approach, which accounts for possible
dynamic changes in mutational rate, to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree and effectively ‘carbon date’ the malignant progression.
Results: The primary colon cancer emerged between 5 and 8 years before the clinical diagnosis. The primary tumour
metastasized to the lung and the thyroid within a year from its onset. The thyroid lesion presented as a tumour-to-tumour de-
posit within a benign Hurthle adenoma. Despite rapid metastatic progression from the primary tumour, the patient showed an
indolent disease course. Primary cancer and metastases were microsatellite stable and displayed low chromosomal instability.
Neo-antigen analysis suggested minimal immunogenicity.
Conclusion: Our data provide the first in vivo experimental evidence documenting the timing of metastatic progression in CRC and
suggest that genomic instability might be more important than the metastatic potential of the primary cancer in dictating CRC fate.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in
Europe and the USA [1]. Synchronous and metachronous
metastases contribute to the high mortality of CRC [2] and, des-
pite improvements in the management of metastatic CRC, 5-year
mortality remains up to 50% [1, 3, 4] with a worse outcome for
synchronous versus metachronous metastasis (5-year relative

 survival 7.2% versus 17.6%) [2]. Discussion around the optimal
management of synchronous metastasis from CRC is still open
but it is reasonable to hypothesize that the difference in outcome
between synchronous and metachronous metastases may not be
entirely attributable to clinical variables. International large-scale
sequencing efforts will likely identify cancer pathways associated
with the molecular makeup of synchronous and metachronous
metastatic spread. Critical questions remain open: what is the
chronological evolution of a synchronously presenting metastatic
CRC? Can we tailor screening and follow-up strategies according
to the expected pattern of metastatic progression?
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of distinct metastases
allows reconstruction of cancer evolutionary trees but the lack of
defined temporal milestones limits the ability to infer the exact
timing of cancer progression.
Needle tract seeding is a rare but well-documented phenom-
enon after diagnostic core needle biopsies and causes metastatic
growth of the cancer along the needle tract [5]. Here, we carried
out WGS of primary and multiple metastatic sites of a CRC pa-
tient who developed an iatrogenic metastasis due to needle tract
seeding. Exploiting the mutational load of this metastasis along
with the exact timing of its onset, we calculated the chronology of
the primary CRC and metastatic sites.
Methods
Ethical approval
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded material was acquired under the diag-
nostic samples/pathology archives surplus to clinical requirements proto-
col at NHS Ayrshire and Arran. The patient provided full written informed
consent for the analyses as detailed, and for the case to be published.
Next-generation sequencing, phylogenetic
reconstruction and neo-antigen load
Targeted exome sequencing was carried out in all samples using the
Comprehensive Cancer Panel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)
that detects mutations in 409 cancer-related genes. WGS was carried out
at 30� depth of coverage on all the samples with the exception of the
urinary tract metastasis, which was excluded from this analysis due to
low tumour content. Phylogenetic analysis and modelling of adjustment
in mutational rate was carried out using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulations. For neo-antigen analysis, we considered variants in
the colon primary tumour, in the lung and thyroid metastases and in the
Hurthle adenoma. Somatic variants were called with the same Mutect2-
Platypus protocol used for the phylogenetic analysis.
The full method list can be found online in the supplementary material.
Results
Needle tract seeding as stopwatch to calibrate
cancer evolution
In November 2008 a 68-year-old Caucasian male underwent anter-
ior resection for a pT3pN2(4/17) EMVI negative, poorly differenti-
ated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Pre-operative staging
revealed a solitary left upper lobe lung lesion of uncertain signifi-
cance, which was kept under active radiological surveillance for
nearly 3 years and remained stable (Figure 1; supplementary Table
S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Repeat imaging in July 2011 demonstrated an increase in size
of the left upper lobe lung lesion in addition to a new nodule in
the left lobe of the thyroid. CT-guided lung biopsy (November
2011) confirmed metastatic colorectal carcinoma with supportive
immunohistochemical staining reaction: positive for CK20,
CDX2 and CEA but negative for TTF-1 (Figures 1, 2A and B).
The patient proceeded to left upper video-assisted thoracoscopic
lobectomy in January 2012. Left thyroid lobectomy (August
2012) demonstrated a follicular Hurthle cell adenoma of the thy-
roid, within which there was a single tumour-to-tumour deposit
of metastatic CRC (Figures 1, 2A and C). The patient underwent
periodic follow-up with tumour markers and imaging thereafter
and remained disease-free.
In September 2013, 5 years from the initial diagnosis, FDG-
PET-CT demonstrated a focal unresectable left posterior chest
wall mass at the site of previous lung biopsy; histology confirmed
metastatic adenocarcinoma from the sigmoid primary in keeping
with seeding of malignant cells from the needle biopsy carried
out 2 years before. Radical chemo-radiotherapy to the left poster-
ior chest wall mass was completed in February 2014 but repeat
CT in May and August 2014 demonstrated residual disease at this
site in addition to a new abnormality in the upper pole of the left
kidney. Renal and left ureteric biopsy demonstrated metastatic
CRC, with immunohistochemical staining positive for CDX2,
CK20, CK7 and BerEP4 (Figures 1, 2A and D; supplementary
Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online) a detailed de-
scription of the case can be found in the Supplementary Material.
Primary tumour and metastatic deposits showed similar histopa-
thologic characteristics, resembling that of a traditional poorly-
differentiated (G3) adenocarcinoma (Figures 1 and 2). No micro-
satellite instability (MSI)-like features (i.e. the presence of mucin-
ous and signet ring cells differentiation; medullary growth
pattern; presence of tumour intraepithelial lymphocytes; Crohn’s
like lymphocytic reaction) were observed.
Genomic profiling
Targeted sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes in both the pri-
mary CRC and all metastatic sites (lung, thyroid, chest wall and
urinary tract) of our case revealed the presence of clonal non-
sense mutations in APC (Gln1367*), as well as missense muta-
tions in CTNNB1 (Leu156Gln), KRAS (Gly12Asp) and TP53
(Ser215Ile) (Figure 2E; supplementary Tables S2 and S3, available
at Annals of Oncology online). The same mutations were not de-
tected in the normal tissue or in the Hurthle adenoma (Figure
2E). Two genes included in our panel showed discordance be-
tween primary and metastatic cancer: ADAMTS20, a metallopro-
teinase involved with cancer invasion and migration [6], and
AKAP9 an A-kinase anchor protein which binds to the regulatory
subunit of protein kinase A [7]. The ADAMTS20 missense muta-
tion Arg1885Thr was observed in the primary cancer but was not
detected in either the lung, thyroid or chest wall metastases.
Conversely, the AKAP9 missense mutation Ala3077Pro was
found in all the metastatic sites but was not detected in the pri-
mary cancer. All these mutations were also found using WGS,
furthermore ADAMTS20 and AKAP9 were validated by Sanger
Sequencing (supplementary Figure S2, available at Annals of

 Oncology online). All lesions were microsatellite stable (MSS) [8].
Copy number analysis based on WGS data revealed a relative low
level of chromosomal instability (CIN), with LOH of chromo-
some (chr) 5, gain of chr7, and a focal amplification on
chr13q12.2-12.3, encompassing the VEGFR1 [9] and CDX2 [10]
genes (Figure 2F; supplementary Figure S3 and Table S4, available
at Annals of Oncology online). These aberrations were clonal in all
the CRC lesions, whereas the Hurthle adenoma showed a distinct
profile characterized only by loss of chr2, chr9, and chr22.
Primary tumour and metastatic sites displayed the same domin-
ant, age related, mutational signature 1 which has previously
observed in CRC as well as other cancer types [11] (supplemen-
tary Figure S4, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Timing progression
Phylogenetic reconstruction from multiple samples of the same
malignancy allows us to turn static snapshots of cancer genomes
into the tumour evolutionary history by exploiting genomic
intra-tumour heterogeneity [12]. However, although phylogen-
etic trees inform on the relationship between different samples,
estimating the exact chronology of the events without a temporal
reference remains extremely challenging.
In this exceptional case, the temporal reference is given by the date
of seeding along the needle tract that initiated the chest wall metasta-
sis. This information allowed ‘calibration’ of the timing for the whole
tree and allowed us to reconstruct the progression of the disease back
in time, dating each ancestral node in the past history of the tumour.
The phylogenetic tree was inferred using a Maximum
Likelihood approach and timed using a Bayesian phylogenomics
framework, accounting for possible dynamic changes in muta-
tional rate, to effectively ‘carbon date’ the malignant progression
and reveal the complete chronology of the different lesions in this
patient (Figure 3A; see supplementary Table S5, available at
Annals of Oncology online for the list of mutations used to infer
the phylogeny). In the field of evolutionary biology, this type of
approach is widely used to time the onset of new species by ex-
ploiting temporal information from the fossil record [13].

Figure 1. Overview of clinical, radiological and pathological progression of a CRC patient. The patient underwent anterior resection for a
pT4pN2 sigmoid cancer in November 2008. A lung nodule of unknown significance at the time of diagnosis was kept under surveillance and
was subsequently proved to be metastatic in nature (biopsy in November 2011) and was resected in January 2012. An FDG-avid thyroid nod-
ule was resected in August 2012 and showed a Hurthle adenoma containing foci of metastatic CRC. Two years after the lung biopsy, a chest
wall mass on the site of previous lung biopsy was histologically confirmed and treated with chemo-radiotherapy. Six months after treatment
the chest wall metastasis showed disease progression and a new site of metastasis along the left ureter was histologically confirmed during
the insertion of a urinary stent. The timeline shows the dates that metastatic sites became apparent on imaging. Haematoxylin and Eosin
(H&E) staining as well as FDG-PET-CT images of primary and metastatic sites are shown.

 By considering the time of chest wall metastasis biopsy as time
zero (September 2013) and the node between the chest wall bi-
opsy and the lung biopsy (needle-tract seeding event) as a refer-
ence, we estimated that metastatic disease originated 9.26 years
before, giving rise to the lung and thyroid metastases in parallel.
The primary cancer instead originated between 9.96 and 13.17
years before (Figure 3A and B; supplementary Figure S5, available
at Annals of Oncology online). Hence, the primary adenocarcin-
oma emerged between 5 and 8 years before clinical diagnosis
(2000–2003). Despite the long latency between biological onset of
the primary cancer and clinical presentation, within just 1 year
from its inception the tumour began metastasizing to the lung
and to the thyroid where the metastasis grew within a Hurthle ad-
enoma. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the lung and thyroid
metastasis were more closely related to one another than to the
primary tumour. A schematic representation of the timeline of
malignant progression is reported in Figure 3B.
Neo-antigen load
In order to test the contribution of anti-tumour immunity in reg-
ulating CRC evolution we applied the pipeline described in sup-
plementary Figure S6, available at Annals of Oncology online (see
also supplementary methods, available at Annals of Oncology on-
line) to the samples subjected to multi-region WGS. The analysis
resulted in a low number of predicted strong human leukocyte
antigen binders [(Colon¼ 51; Thyroid Metastasis ¼ 5 and Lung
Metastasis ¼ 7), supplementary Table S6, available at Annals of
Oncology online].
Discussion
Several studies have applied mathematical modelling to calculate
the time-lapse between the onset of primary and metastatic
spread [14, 15]. CRC modelling suggests that metastases can de-
velop in less than 2 years from the primary cancer [15]. However,
these types of analysis remain difficult to interpret and hard to
generalise due to the lack of temporal references. Here, we ex-
ploited the occurrence of a needle tract metastasis to define the
exact chronology of primary onset and metastatic spread. Our
observations suggest that this process might be faster than ex-
pected, occurring within the initial 12 months from the primary
onset. Similar patterns of early metastatic divergence have been
reported in other tumour types using an analogous phyloge-
nomic approach, where in the case of metachronous lesions, the
time between primary and metastatic resection was used as a ref-
erence [16].
Despite rapid metastatic transformation, our patient showed
an indolent course of disease. How can we explain the discord-
ance between the early metastatic dissemination and a relatively
favourable prognosis in a patient with synchronous metastasis?

 The pattern of disease progression we observed is quite uncom-
mon for a CRC patient but, in our opinion, does not account for
the favourable outcome. Solitary lung metastases are observed in
11% of colon cancer patients; surgical resection can be curative in
some cases but prognosis remains modest [17]. Thyroid and
urinary tract metastasis are uncommon and are usually associated
with poor prognosis and multi-metastatic disease. CRC metasta-
ses to a thyroid adenoma (tumour-to-tumour metastasis) are
even less frequent and have always been associated with poor out-
come [18]. Although the resection of both lung and the thyroid
metastases might have contributed to the improved survival of
our patient, the analysis of his molecular makeup suggests that a
rather unusual pattern of low genomic instability may have con-
tributed to the indolent course of disease.
In keeping with previous evidence from large-scale genomic
studies [19], targeted sequencing showed clonal mutations in
genes accounting for the ‘breakthrough’ and ‘expansion’ phase of
the primary CRC [20] such as APC, CTNNB1, KRAS and TP53.
As expected, all these mutations were also detected in metastatic
sites. In contrast, discrepancies between the primary and meta-
static sites were observed for ADAMTS20 and AKAP9. In line
with our observation, ADAMTS20 mutations were detected in a
large series of primary CRC but not in their matching synchron-
ous metastasis [6] suggesting this mutation might promote inva-
sion of the primary cancer but might not be critical for cell fitness
in metastatic sites. The anchor protein-coding gene AKAP9 has
also been investigated in CRC and found to be up-regulated in
CRC with nodal metastasis [21] suggesting a pro-metastatic role
for this gene. The molecular pathology of our patient appears
common to many other sporadic CRCs. Although the clonal or
private mutations described above may have allowed our pa-
tient’s cancer cells to metastasise and survive in different environ-
ments, this does not explain the slow pattern of progression,
suggesting the reason for our patient’s indolent disease may lie
elsewhere.
MSI and CIN can be used to classify CRCs with different mo-
lecular and prognostic features [22]. Interestingly our patient
showed no MSI and relatively few and clonal chromosomal aber-
rations, with a focal amplification in 13p12.2-12.3 encompassing
the VEGFR2 and CDX2 loci, genes previously found over-
expressed in synchronous versus metachronous metastatic CRC
[23]. Different lines of evidence suggest that high CIN occurring
at early stages of neoplastic transformation might represent a
hallmark of aggressive behaviour [24, 25] thus the lack of it might
explain the indolent course of disease observed in our patient.
A final interesting point relates to the contribution of the tu-
mour microenvironment to CRC evolution: low neo-antigen
burden has been associated with worse prognosis in early-stage
lung cancer [26]. In our case, the primary cancer displayed low
number of neo-antigens and the lack of anti-tumour immunity
against the primary cancer might explain the early metastatic
spread.
Genomic instability [25] and tumour–stroma interactions [27]
represent synergic drivers of cancer progression. The genomic
data suggest that in this patient these two hallmarks of cancer
evolution might have been uncoupled: while the lack of immune
surveillance against the primary tumour might have promoted
early cancer metastasis, the relative stability in genomic aberra-
tions might account for the slow rate of progression.
