Objective Walking interventions in healthy populations 
show clinically relevant improvements for many 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. We aimed to 
assess the changes in CVD risk factors and the dose–
response relationship between frequency, intensity, 
duration and volume of walking and cardiovascular risk 
factors based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Design A systematic review with meta-analysis and 
meta-regression.
Data sources Four electronic databases searched from 
January 1971 to April 2017.
Eligibility criteria Walking RCTs reporting one or 
more CVD risk factor outcomes; trials including at least 
one group with walking intervention and a no-walking 
control group; duration ≥8 weeks; participants ≥18 
years old, inactive but healthy; risk factors assessed 
preintervention and postintervention; English-language 
articles in peer-reviewed journals.
results Thirty-seven RCTs, involving 2001 participants 
(81% women) and assessing 13 CVD risk factors, were 
identified. Pooled meta-analysis showed favourable 
effects (P≤0.05) of walking intervention for seven CVD 
risk factors (body mass, body mass index, body fat, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose 
and VO2max). There were no significant effects (P>0.05) 
for waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and four 
blood lipid variables. Despite testing 91 possible dose–
response relationships, linear meta-regression analysis 
adjusted for age indicated just 7 (or 7.7%) statistically 
significant findings.
summary/conclusion Walking interventions benefit a 
number of CVD risk factors. Despite multiple studies and 
tested metrics, only a few dose–response relationships 
were identified and the possibility of chance findings 
cannot be ruled out. There is insufficient evidence to 
quantify the frequency, length, bout duration, intensity 
and volume of the walking required to improve CVD risk 
factors.

InTrODuCTIOn
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major 
burden worldwide.1 It has been estimated that elim-
ination of physical inactivity would remove between 
6% and 10% of the major NCDs of coronary heart 
disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes, and breast and 
colon cancers, and increase life expectancy.2 One 
key approach to increase population levels of phys-
ical activity is to promote safe, accessible and envi-
ronmentally friendly activity options for all citizens, 
including improved infrastructure for walking and 
cycling for transport and recreation.3 
Walking is the ideal physical activity intervention 
to improve health across the population.4 A recent 
systematic review of 32 randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) by Murtagh et al5 showed that walking 
increases aerobic capacity and reduces blood pres-
sure, waist circumference, body weight, per cent 
body fat and body mass index (BMI). Another 
systematic review6 reported similar health benefits 
of recreational walking including reduced systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, 
body fat, BMI and total cholesterol, and increased 
VO2max, physical functioning and the distance 
covered in a 6 
min walk test.
National physical activity recommendations are 
based on summative volumes of different intensi-
ties of physical activity over a week, with walking 
as the cornerstone of health promotion efforts. 
However, walking can vary considerably in terms 
of the frequency, intensity, daily/weekly duration 
and total volume. Specific evidence on the dose–
response relationships could increase health profes-
sionals’ effectiveness in promoting physical activity 
and specifically walking for health benefits.
Observational data indicate some dose–response 
relationships at a population level. In a systematic 
review of epidemiological studies with all-cause 
mortality as the endpoint, Hamer and Chida7 
found that walking pace was a stronger indepen-
dent predictor than walking volume. Through 
meta-analysis, Kelly et al8 showed an increased 
reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for 
higher walking volumes (in MET-hours per 
week). Also, randomised controlled walking trials 
have found some dose–response relationships. 
 
Asikainen et al searched for the minimum dose of 
walking for health benefits and found that a weekly 
dose of 1000 to 1500 kcal of walking improved the 
aerobic power and body composition of previously 
sedentary non-obese postmenopausal women.9

systematic review of randomised controlled walking

trials that there is insufficient evidence to suggest any conclu-
sions about the dose–response between the volume and intensity 
of walking and the health outcomes.
CVD risk factor reduction via walking promotion must be 
based on evidence of effectiveness and on being able to identify 
the effects of variations in different characteristics of walking, 
potentially offering more options for walking. Based on the 
updated data of Murtagh et al,5 our systematic review aimed 
to (1) update the evidence for the effects of walking interven-
tions on CVD risk factors and in particular to (2) study the 
 
dose–response relationships between the frequency, intensity, 
duration and volume of walking interventions and CVD risk 
factors in healthy inactive adults.

Data search
Studies (1971–2012) included in an earlier systematic review5 
were supplemented by electronic searches (January 2012 to 
April 2017) of four databases: Cochrane Central Register for 
Controlled Trials, Medline, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus. 
The following search terms were used in both searches: (1) 
walking, (2) exercise, (3) health and (4) cardiovascular risk. 
The full search strategy for the 2012–2017 search is enclosed 
as online supplementary file 1. Reference lists from review and 
original articles were hand-searched for additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were selected based on the following inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria: RCTs studying the effects of walking on one or 
more CVD risk factors; trials with at least one group completing 
walking as the only intervention; intervention duration at least 
8 weeks; control group with no walking intervention; partici-
pants aged 18 years or older who were insufficiently active but 
otherwise healthy and capable of unaided walking (otherwise no 
other age limit); CVD risk factors assessed pretraining and post-
training (or change from preintervention to postintervention 
reported); English-language articles published in peer-reviewed 
journals between January 1971 and April 2017.
study selection
T
wenty-eight studies9–36 from a previous review5 of 32 studies 
were included in the current analyses. T
wo studies were 
excluded because of very old age of the participants37 38 and two 
studies because of insufficient outcome data.39 40 Screening of 
the previous review is described elsewhere.5 The updated search 
resulted in 10 new studies for inclusion.41–50 Titles and abstracts 
from the updated search were screened by three authors (PO, ST, 
PK). Full papers were screened independently for eligibility by 
two authors (PO, ST and PO, PK). Disagreements were resolved 
by jointly reassessing the studies against the eligibility criteria.
Data extraction
T
wo authors (PO, PK) extracted participant characteristics and 
outcome measures data independently, and a third author (ST) 
checked the extracted data of all included studies. Disagree-
ments were resolved by consensus. Dose attributes were defined 
as frequency, intensity, duration and total volume of walking, 
and the health outcomes for CVD risk factors as measures of 
cardiometabolic fitness, adiposity and blood lipid profile. Inter-
vention dose metrics were extracted by one author (PO) and 
cross-checked by a second author (ST). Missing information was 
sought from the authors of 12 studies.13 17 23 31–34 36 39 40 47 48
Intervention dose metrics were frequency (sessions per 
week), duration of the intervention (weeks), bout duration 
(minutes per session), intensity as METs and %VO2max, 
and volume as MET-minutes per week and total MET-hours 
(conversion formulas are indicated in the respective tables).51–53 
The outcome measures were aerobic fitness expressed as 
 
VO2max (mL/kg·min), body mass (kg), body fat (%), BMI (weight 
in kilograms divided by height in metres squared), waist circum-
ference (cm), waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (mm Hg), total cholesterol (mmol/L), high-density lipo-
protein (HDL) cholesterol (mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol (mmol/L), triglycerides (mmol/L) and fasting 
glucose (mmol/L). Outcomes for insulin resistance and inflam-
mation-related serum cytokines,45 blood flow in lower extrem-
ities,46 arterial stiffness,48 postural stability,42 bone mineral 
density42 and biomarkers of endothelial function49 were not 
included in the meta-analyses because of insufficient number of 
comparisons (<10) (see Higgins and Se54).
Assessment of the risk of bias
Risk of bias of individual studies was assessed by the Cochrane 
Collaboration tool.54 T
wo authors (PO, EMM) assessed studies 
independently for sequence generation, allocation concealment, 
blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting 
and other potential threats to validity. Divergent ratings were 
reassessed independently by a third author (MHM) to reach 
consensus.
synthesis of results
The software ‘Comprehensive Meta-Analysis’ was used for all 
statistical analyses.55 For each CVD risk factor outcome, stan-
dardised mean difference (SMD) (defined as the raw differ-
ence between the mean change in the intervention group and 
the mean change in the control group divided by pooled post-
SD) was used as the summary measure. When these data were 
not reported, we used the reported findings as follows. For 
the studies by Butcher et al,17 Murphy and Hardman23 and 
 
Tully et al,33 34 we used mean change and its SD and the number 
of participants in each group to calculate SMD. For the study 
of Hamdorf et al,43 we used pre-means and post-means and the 
number of participants in each group and F for the difference 
between changes. For body mass in the study by Hinkleman 
and Nieman,19 the number of participants in each group and 
F for difference between the changes were used in the formula.
Eleven studies included more than one walking intervention 
group. The results for each group compared with the control 
were treated as independent studies. The number of participants 
in the control group was divided by the number of interven-
tion groups.54 The effect direction was set negative for studies 
where a decrease represented an improvement in the health risk 
factor compared with the control group, and the effect direction 
was set positive for HDL cholesterol and VO2max as an increase 
represents an improvement in health risk. The following Q statis-
tics were used to identify and quantify the heterogeneity in effect 
sizes for each CVD outcome: (1) the estimated SD of the true 
effect size (Tau), (2) the ratio of true heterogeneity to total vari-
ation in observed effects (I2), which can range from 0% to 100% 
and (3) the P value to test the null hypothesis that all studies 
share a common effect size.55 Publication bias was assessed 
by visual inspection of funnel plots. If a publication bias was 
assumed, cumulative forest plots55 were used for confirmation.
Effect sizes were expressed in the original units of the outcome 
variables by multiplying SMD by a population representative SD

for the outcome.54 Representative SDs were obtained from the 
MONICA Population Survey data56 for body mass, BMI, waist 
circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total 
and HDL cholesterol. For VO2, the SD was taken from a Norwe-
gian study of 3816 participants57 and for per cent body fat from 
the FINRISK 2007 study.58
All analyses were adjusted for age. Gender was not considered 
a confounder because only two studies were men only. Further 
adjustment for gender indicated that there was no difference in 
the effect sizes between subgroups with women only, men only, 
mixed and no information (data not shown).
Dose–response by walking characteristics
We conducted random-effects univariate meta-regression analysis 
with adjustment for age using continuous walking intervention 
characteristics as the covariates to test linear as well as curvi-
linear relationships. The dependent variable was the SMD for 
each CVD outcome. In the regression models, the study’s weight 
was the inverse of the total variance for each CVD outcome.
Meta-regression results are reported as the linear β-coeffi-
cient with 95% 
CI and P values. The curvilinear regressions 
between the MET-related doses and the outcomes were anal-
ysed by creating two variables (dose minus mean and dose minus 
mean squared) and testing if the interaction was significant. The 
Bonferroni correction59 was applied to interpret multiple-com-
parison P values.
rEsulTs
selection of studies
We searched four electronic databases from 2012 to April 2017 
to update the data of the previous systematic review.5 The search 
resulted in a total of 7862 records. The screening of the titles 
and abstracts yielded 37 papers for potential inclusion. These 
were supplemented by 28 papers from the previous review5 
and one paper was identified by hand searching. The full-text 
versions of 70 papers were then screened. Thirty-two papers 
were excluded due to the following reasons: mixed training 
content (seven), non-randomised or group-randomised design 
(eight), non-healthy participants (eight), no no-walking control 
group (three), incomplete outcome data (four) and unclear inter-
vention (two). Thirty-eight eligible studies were included in the 
analyses. This included 28 studies from the previous review5 
and 10 new studies. Where studies reported results using the 
same participants in more than one article, these were combined 
to represent one study in the meta-analysis. Study selection is 
depicted in figure 1.
study characteristics
Participant characteristics, study characteristics and walking 
intervention characteristics (session duration, frequency and 
intensity as well as length of the intervention) for all 37 included 
studies are shown in online supplementary table 1. In brief,

Outcome data
Our pooled data included sufficient number (≥10) of compar-
isons in the meta-analyses for body mass (40), BMI (28), body 
fat (28), waist circumference (18), waist-to-hip ratio (13), 
systolic blood pressure (34), diastolic blood pressure (32), total 
cholesterol (37), HDL cholesterol (35), LDL cholesterol (34), 
triglycerides (34), fasting glucose (16) and VO2max (31). Overall, 
both the meta-analyses and the meta-regression analyses included 
13 or more comparisons.
risk of bias
Results of the assessment of the risk of bias according to the 
Cochrane Collaboration assessment tool are shown in online 
supplementary table 3. Among the 37 studies, only 2 studies 
were assessed as being at low risk of bias across all domains.13 33
Meta-analysis
Pooled meta-analysis results (SMD, 95% CI, P value) are shown 
in table 1. Significant favourable effects (P<0.05) were seen 
for body mass, BMI, body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, fasting glucose and VO2max. Estimated effect sizes were 
body mass −1.6 
kg, BMI −0.60 
kg/ m2, systolic blood pres-
sure − 4.05 
mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure −1.76 
mm Hg and 
VO2max 4.86 
mL/(kg·min).
Heterogeneity, as indicated by I2, was 0% for all outcomes 
except for systolic (17%) and diastolic (6%) blood pressure, total 
cholesterol (16%) and fasting glucose (23%).
Funnel plots for the outcomes showed symmetric patterns 
suggesting non-significant publication bias except those for 
body fat and LDL (see online supplementary file 2). Cumulative 
forest plots of these outcomes (see online supplementary file 2) 
showed a symmetric pattern of the effect sizes even with the less 
precise studies included, thus suggesting that there is no reason 
to assume a publication bias.55
Meta-regression and dose–response by walking dose 
characteristics
The linear meta-regression analyses for (1) walking frequency 
(number of sessions per week), (2) intervention duration (weeks) 
and (3) session duration (minutes) showed three significant 
(P≤0.05) positive associations from 39 possible dose–response 
relationships (intervention duration with LDL-cholesterol 
(P=0.001) and VO2max (P=0.018), and session duration with 
triglycerides (P=0.029)) and one inverse association (session 
duration with systolic blood pressure (P=0.050)) (table 2).

the outcomes resulted in three positive associations from a possible 
39: METs with VO2max (P=0.049), MET-min per week with 
triglycerides (P=0.009) and total MET-hours with LDL choles-
terol (P=0.007) (table 3). We found one positive relationship to 
be significantly curvilinear after adjustment for multiple testing: 
intensity in METs with LDL cholesterol (results not shown).
Respective linear analysis with the relative intensity dose 
(%VO2max) yielded one inverse association: %VO2max with 
diastolic blood pressure (P=0.020) (table 4).
DIsCussIOn
Despite multiple studies and tested metrics, only a few signif-
icant dose–response relationships between the walking doses 
and the CVD outcomes were identified and the possibility of 
chance findings cannot be ruled out. This review suggests that 
there is insufficient evidence to quantify the frequency, length, 
bout duration, intensity and volume of the walking required to 
improve CVD risk profile.
Our meta-analysis showed significant positive impact of 
walking on seven CVD risk factors: body mass, BMI, body 
fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose and 
VO2max. These findings are consistent with those of Murtagh 
et al5 except that of waist circumference, for which they found a 
statistically significant effect but we did not, and the new finding 
of decreased fasting glucose in the present review.
 Blair et al evaluated the clinical significance of their 
findings and noted that an increase in aerobic capacity of 
10% is likely to result in a 15% reduction in mortality,61 
while Lewington et al noted that a 2 
mm Hg reduction in systolic 
blood pressure would result in 10% lower stroke mortality and 
7% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease and other 
vascular causes.62 As the reductions in body mass, BMI and 
diastolic blood pressure in the current analyses were of greater 
magnitude than reported by Murtagh et al,5 and there was the 
additional decrease of fasting glucose, the changes found in the 
CVD risk factors could be considered clinically important.
There was no indication of publication bias in the cumula-
tive funnel plots, but the quality of studies was variable. Due to 
incomplete reporting, the risk of bias in sequence generation, 
allocation concealment and blinding could not be assessed for 
the majority (76% to 84%) of studies. In contrast, low risk of 
bias for outcome analysis and reporting, and for other poten-
tial sources of bias was assessed for the majority (65% to 95%) 
of the included studies. These observations highlight the need 
for careful execution and full reporting of future walking trials 
according to the current quality criteria to ensure the validity of 
the findings.
Adherence to the exercise protocol may have an impact on 
the reported outcome results. Actual adherence is likely to be 
smaller than intended, especially in long-lasting interventions, 
and the difference may lead to overestimation of the dose needed 
for changes. In our data of 37 studies, 22 studies reported 
adherence rate and 15 did not. The reported adherence rates 
varied between 67% and 100% with 17 studies reporting over 
 
80% adherence. While it is possible that the non-reporting studies 
had lower adherence, the high rates in the majority of the studies 
suggest that the possible overestimation of the dose may not be 
substantial. We performed post hoc subgroup and mixed-effect 
analyses comparing studies with adherence rates over and below 
90% for all study outcomes. The results indicated no statistically 
significant differences in any of the outcomes.
Sufficient sample sizes are needed for robust results. We 
examined our data from this perspective by conducting post hoc

subgroup and mixed-effects analyses comparing study group 
sizes over and below 20 (per study arm) for all outcome variables. 
The subgroup analysis indicated statistically significant differ-
ences between the two sample sizes for fasting glucose, systolic 
blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Subsequent mixed-effects 
analyses showed no differences between the two groups for LDL 
cholesterol and statistically significant differences for fasting 
glucose and systolic blood pressure. Overall, the sample size 
affected only 2 of the 13 outcomes, which may also be due to 
the multiple comparisons.
In our study, we have attempted to explore the dose–
response between walking characteristics and CVD risk factors 
using meta-regression analysis. One assumption for the use 
of meta-regression is sufficient heterogeneity in the outcome 
effects, that is, some of the variance across the included 
studies is real. We found some (4%–23%) heterogeneity as 
measured by the statistic I2 in four and no heterogeneity in nine 
outcomes. This low level of heterogeneity may explain the fact 
that we found only a few statistically significant dose–response 
associations.
Moreover, as the meta-regression analyses included multiple 
comparisons between the dose and the outcomes (each 13 
comparisons), there is a risk of overestimating the statistical 
significance. A more conservative P value for our multiple 
testing would be between P<0.004 
and 0.002 according to 
Bonferroni.59 All but one (weeks of intervention with LDL) of 
the found P values for the regressions were greater than this. We 
therefore did not find any consistent evidence that the response 
of the CVD risk factors is associated with the walking dose char-
acteristics used in this study.
The dose of walking in METs represents the absolute inten-
sity, which confers different levels of relative physiological load 
across individuals with different capacity. Thus, a dose of 5 METs 
may mean 50% of the capacity of a person with good cardiore-
spiratory fitness and 80% of the capacity of a person with low 
fitness. This means that the METs intensity is only an estimate of 
the absolute but not the relative physiological stimulus. Physio-
logical load relative to maximum is likely to be the key stimulus 
for many of the alterations in health outcomes being considered. 
We found one significant positive response (VO2max, P=0.049) 
for the METs dose. Maximal oxygen uptake is the gold stan-
dard for aerobic fitness. The per cent level of VO2max of training 
represents a good measure of the relative physiological training 
stimulus. We had 20 studies with %VO2max intensity (reported 
or converted). In all these studies, the training intensity was 
determined by individual heart rate monitoring (19 studies) or 
walking speed (one study) derived from laboratory assessment. 
Thus, the relative intensity dose was physiologically controlled 
at the group level. The regression analysis (table 4) resulted in a 
significant (P=0.020) inverse association between the %VO2max 
dose and diastolic blood pressure. As this P value does not reach 
the conservative significance P level of 0.004,59 the response of 
the CVD risk factors is likely to be independent also of the rela-
tive intensity dose.

Original article
In order to put our findings in the context of current physical 
activity recommendations, we can use MET-minutes per week 
dose, which combines the frequency, bout duration and intensity 
as the bases. WHO63 recommends 150 
min of moderate-intensity 
aerobic physical activity per week for health benefits. Applying 3 
METs as the lower limit of moderate-intensity activity, the weekly 
minimum recommended dose is 450 MET-minutes. Our results 
indicate that walking within the range of approximately 100 to 
1300 MET-min per week can benefit CVD risk factors. Thus, 
according to our results, even less than the recommended amount 
of weekly walking (eg, 450 MET-min) may be health-promoting 
for inactive middle-aged and older people. This is in line with a 
recent evidence summary, which suggests that approximately 200 
MET-min per week is sufficient for health benefits.64
strengths and weaknesses
Our systematic review including 38 studies published between 
1971 and 2017 identified a large number of randomised controlled 
walking trials conducted according to a standard set of quantita-
tive criteria. The data set consisted of 28 studies from a previous 
review5 and 10 new studies. This data set included 2001 partic-
ipants and 55 comparisons between intervention and control 
groups and a commonly accepted set of the most important CVD 
risk factors, allowing for rigorous meta-analysis of the main effects 
of walking and yielding robust effect sizes in several outcomes. 
Extraction of clearly defined walking dose characteristics enabled 
unique meta-regression analysis for the dose–response between 
walking attributes and health outcomes. In addition, both the 
linear and the curvilinear relationships were tested. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first attempt to explore the dose–response patterns 
with meta-regression analysis of data from randomised controlled 
walking trials.
The study is not without weaknesses. We were not able to 
perform an individual participant data analysis using the primary 
data for each study but relied on aggregated data across studies 
resulting in increasing intrastudy and interstudy heterogeneity, and 
potentially regression to the mean. The low level of heterogeneity 
of the changes in the outcomes across the studies may have limited 
the power to detect dose–response relationships. The used dose 
metrics had to be converted from a variety of respective measures 
leading in several cases to estimated levels of the dose. The quality 
of the included studies was variable. In particular, the sequence 
generation, allocation concealment and blinding in the trials was 
less than adequate in many studies. This may attenuate the precision 
of the effect sizes, although the direction of the observed effects 
was consistent. Another weakness concerns the generalisability of 
the findings. Participants in the studies were mostly healthy but 
inactive women, so direct applicability to men and individuals with 
pre-existing chronic disease may be questioned. However, based on 
recent evidence on the effects of PA on health and on the resulting 
PA recommendations, there appears very few differences between 
women and men. Moreover, as 35 of the 38 studies came from 
Europe, USA, Canada and Australia, the findings may not be appli-
cable to lower-income and middle-income countries.
summary and conclusions
Meta-analysis of data from 37 randomised controlled walking 
trials revealed significant improvements in seven CVD risk factors: 
decreases in body mass, BMI, body fat, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, fasting glucose and an increase in VO2max. The effect 
sizes indicate clinically important improvements in CVD risk 
profile. There were non-significant effects on six CVD risk factors: 
waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference, and in total, HDL and 
LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
Our meta-regression analyses did not find associations 
between the observed effects on the CVD risk factors and the 
frequency, length, bout duration, intensity and volume of the 
walking training. These results suggest that any walking expo-
sure within the dose range of the included studies is likely to 
be beneficial for cardiovascular health. Current practice, popu-
lation health promotion and exercise referral should reflect 
this. As these controlled intervention studies were designed and 
implemented for healthy but inactive middle-aged and older 
women and men, the findings demonstrate the health potential 
of everyday walking for large segments of populations. Walking 
still remains firmly a ‘best buy’ for public health.

What are the findings?
 
► Walking interventions have clinically significant effect on 
cardiovascular disease risk factors including body mass, body 
mass index, body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
fasting glucose and an increase in VO2max.
 
► Even modest amounts of walking appear to provide health 
benefit.
 
► There is insufficient evidence on the exact volume and pace 
of walking required for benefit.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Clinicians should continue to promote walking among their 
patients, particularly women and older adults.
