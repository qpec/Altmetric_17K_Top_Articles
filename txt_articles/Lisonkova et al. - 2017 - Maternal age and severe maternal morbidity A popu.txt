Abstract
Background
One of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals of 2000 was to reduce maternal
mortality by 75% in 15 y; however, this challenge was not met by many industrialized coun-
tries. As average maternal age continues to rise in these countries, associated potentially
life-threatening severe maternal morbidity has been understudied. Our primary objective
was to examine the associations between maternal age and severe maternal morbidities.
The secondary objective was to compare these associations with those for adverse fetal/
infant outcomes.
Methods and findings
This was a population-based retrospective cohort study, including all singleton births to
women residing in Washington State, US, 1 January 2003–31 December 2013 (n =
828,269).
We compared age-specific rates of maternal mortality/severe morbidity (e.g., obstetric
shock) and adverse fetal/infant outcomes (e.g., perinatal death). Logistic regression was
used to adjust for parity, body mass index, assisted conception, and other potential con-
founders. We compared crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (AORs) and risk differ-
ences and their 95% CIs.
Severe maternal morbidity was significantly higher among teenage mothers than among
those 25–29 y (crude OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.5–1.6) and increased exponentially with maternal
age over 39 y, from OR = 1.2 (95% CI 1.2–1.3) among women aged 35–39 y to OR = 5.4
(95% CI 2.4–12.5) among women aged �50 y. The elevated risk of severe morbidity among

 teen mothers disappeared after adjustment for confounders, except for maternal sepsis
(AOR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.4). Adjusted rates of severe morbidity remained increased
among mothers �35 y, namely, the rates of amniotic fluid embolism (AOR = 8.0, 95% CI
2.7–23.7) and obstetric shock (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3–6.6) among mothers �40 y, and
renal failure (AOR = 15.9, 95% CI 4.8–52.0), complications of obstetric interventions
(AOR = 4.7, 95% CI 2.3–9.5), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI
2.0–11.9) among those 45–49 y. The adjusted risk difference in severe maternal morbidity
compared to mothers 25–29 y was 0.9% (95% CI 0.7%–1.2%) for mothers 40–44 y, 1.6%
(95% CI 0.7%–2.8%) for mothers 45–49 y, and 6.4% for mothers �50 y (95% CI 1.7%–
18.2%). Similar associations were observed for fetal and infant outcomes; neonatal mortality
was elevated in teen mothers (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2–1.7), while mothers over 29 y had
higher risk of stillbirth. The rate of severe maternal morbidity among women over 49 y was
higher than the rate of mortality/serious morbidity of their offspring. Despite the large sample
size, statistical power was insufficient to examine the association between maternal age
and maternal death or very rare severe morbidities.
Conclusions
Maternal age-specific incidence of severe morbidity varied by outcome. Older women
(�40 y) had significantly elevated rates of some of the most severe, potentially life-threaten-
ing morbidities, including renal failure, shock, acute cardiac morbidity, serious complications
of obstetric interventions, and ICU admission. These results should improve counselling to
women who contemplate delaying childbirth until their forties and provide useful information
to their health care providers. This information is also useful for preventive strategies to
lower maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in developed countries.

Introduction
One of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals of 2000 was to reduce maternal
mortality by 75% in 15 y [1], a challenge that spurred an interest in maternal mortality and
morbidity [2,3]. This challenge was not met by many industrialized countries [4–6]. Moreover,
recent reports suggest an increase in maternal deaths in the United States, with the maternal
mortality ratio rising from 12 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 14 per 100,000 live births in
2015 [6–9]. Several explanations have been offered for the increase, including improved ascer-
tainment of maternal deaths, especially those resulting from indirect obstetric causes and late
deaths occurring after 42 d postpartum [10], and a temporal increase in chronic health condi-
tions in the child-bearing population. Past decades have seen a rise in the number of parturient
women with hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart disease, obesity [11–15], and advanced
maternal age [16–21], reflecting an increased complexity of obstetric care, requiring careful
prenatal monitoring and timely obstetric interventions.
One of the most remarkable recent demographic changes in industrialized countries has
been an upward shift in maternal age [16–21]. In the US, for example, the proportion of births
to teenage mothers declined from 12.8% in 1990 to 7.0% in 2013, while the proportion of
births to women over 40 y increased from 1.2% to 2.8% [16,17]. The age-specific fertility rate
declined from 59.9 births per 1,000 women in 1990 to 24.2 in 2014 for women aged 15–19 y,
while the rate doubled among women aged 40–44 y (from 5.5 to 10.6 per 1,000 women) and
quadrupled among women aged �45 y (from 0.2 to 0.8 births per 1,000 women) [17]. In the
United Kingdom, the fertility rate declined from 33.3 per 1,000 women in 1990 to 14.5 in 2015
for women under 20 y but increased from 5.3 to 15.2 per 1,000 women for women �40 y over
the same period [21]. In 2015, for the first time since 1947, the fertility rate among women
aged 40 y or more rose above the rate in women under 20 y in the UK [21].
The effect of older maternal age on elevated rates of cesarean delivery, fetal death, and neo-
natal mortality and morbidity is well recognized [19,22–28]. While these infant outcomes have
been extensively studied using broadly accessible information from birth certificates (e.g., still-
birth and linked live-birth infant death files from the US National Center for Health Statistics)
and birth registries, little information is available on the consequences for the health of the
mother. This gap leads to clinical uncertainty in risk identification. Our objective was to exam-
ine the association between maternal age and severe maternal morbidity using detailed infor-
mation from a unique link of two population databases—live birth/fetal death certificates and
maternal hospitalization files—in Washington State, US. We hypothesized that, besides the
well-recognized elevated rates of fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity at the extremes of
maternal age, the risks of severe maternal morbidity would also be significantly increased.

 Methods
All analyses were performed on publicly accessible de-identified data. An exemption from eth-
ics approval was granted by the Department of Social and Health Services of Washington
State. This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (S1 Checklist).
We studied all singleton live births and stillbirths to mothers aged 15–60 y in Washington
State from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2013. We used information from two linked popu-
lation databases: (a) live birth/fetal death certificates with information on demographics and
pregnancy and birth characteristics and (b) hospitalization files including information on spe-
cific maternal and infant morbidity. The Birth Events Record Database (BERD) (the database
has since been renamed: Linked Birth—CHARS, 1987–2013; http://www.doh.wa.gov/
DataandStatisticalReports/VitalStatisticsData/OrderDataFiles#Linked) includes information
on maternal characteristics (maternal age, race, education, marital status, body mass index
[BMI], chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstetric history, etc.); pregnancy, labor, and
delivery characteristics (gestational diabetes, hypertension in pregnancy, gestational age at
delivery, mode of delivery, prolonged labor, etc.); and birth outcomes (fetal and neonatal
death, Apgar score at 5 min, birth weight, occurrence of neonatal seizures, neonatal intensive
care unit [NICU] admission, etc.). The BERD data were linked with the Comprehensive Hos-
pital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) database, which includes all hospitalizations in
Washington State and up to nine diagnostic and six procedure codes related to each hospitali-
zation episode. We used maternal delivery hospitalization records for information on maternal
death and maternal morbidity during delivery and the type of health insurance coverage, and
infant birth hospitalization records for detailed information on severe neonatal morbidity and
congenital anomalies diagnosed at birth. We did not include multiple pregnancies because the
BERD dataset did not provide linkage between births from the same pregnancy (even though
they were flagged as twins, triplets, etc.), and their inclusion in our study would therefore com-
promise the analysis (i.e., mothers of twins would be included twice in the dataset). In addi-
tion, multiple pregnancies are clinically distinct from singleton pregnancies (e.g., they have
lower average gestational age at delivery, and some complications occur only among multiples,
including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome). Mothers aged <15 y were not included in the
study, as they have distinct problems with respect to child abuse, low socioeconomic status,
etc.
The originally proposed analysis was to examine maternal age in the following categories:
15–19, 20–24, 25–29 (reference category), 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, and �45 y, with additional
analyses of the outcomes with higher incidence among women �50 y. This categorization is
commonly used in the literature, and the age categories span equal numbers of years; maternal
age �35 y is generally considered advanced maternal age, while maternal age �40 y is consid-
ered “very advanced” maternal age. In the revised analysis, we included the maternal age cate-
gory 45–49 y to examine severe morbidities with higher incidence rates, and a category �50 y
for a composite maternal death/severe morbidity outcome (see below). Maternal death was
identified from the CHARS database using the hospital discharge code for death. ICD-9-CM
diagnostic and procedure codes were used to identify severe maternal morbidity. Severe
maternal morbidity was identified using criteria developed by the Canadian Perinatal Surveil-
lance System [29] based on high case fatality (e.g., sepsis), vital organ function damage (e.g.,
acute renal failure), high resource utilization (e.g., major surgical procedures), and important
adverse sequelae (e.g., peripartum hysterectomy) (see S1 Table). We included additional con-
ditions recognized as severe maternal morbidity by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [30,31]: life-saving procedures such as mechanical ventilation, conversion of

 cardiac rhythm, etc. Severe maternal morbidity was divided into the following categories: (1)
antepartum hemorrhage that required transfusion, e.g., placenta previa, placental abruption;
(2) respiratory morbidity, e.g., obstetric pulmonary embolism, respiratory arrest; (3) thrombo-
embolism, e.g., deep venous thrombosis; (4) cerebrovascular morbidity, e.g., cerebral venous
thromboembolism, intracranial hemorrhage; (5) all acute cardiac morbidity, e.g., acute myo-
cardial infarction, cardiac arrest, heart failure, peripartum cardiomyopathy; (6) severe postpar-
tum hemorrhage (PPH) requiring transfusion; (7) maternal sepsis, e.g., major puerperal
infection, septicemia during labor; (8) renal failure; (9) obstetric shock; (10) complications of
anesthesia and obstetric interventions, including shock due to anesthesia, cardiac and pulmo-
nary complications; and (11) severe morbidity denoted by the need for potentially life-saving
procedures, e.g., transfusion, hysterectomy, mechanical ventilation. These categories aimed to
describe specific groups of severe morbid conditions and were not mutually exclusive. A
composite outcome of maternal death/severe morbidity included any of these conditions or
procedures; other potentially life-threatening conditions, such as disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC), eclampsia, uterine rupture, or acute liver failure (see S1 Table); admission
to an intensive care unit (ICU); and maternal mortality. In addition, we aimed to describe the
maternal age-specific incidence of specific morbidities, such as amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)
and peripartum cardiomyopathy, and the rate of admission to an ICU.
Neonatal death was defined as infant death within 28 d after birth. Perinatal mortality was
defined as stillbirth (intrapartum or antepartum fetal death after 20 wk of gestation) or neona-
tal death. Severe neonatal morbidity was identified from the CHARS database using the ICD-
9-CM diagnostic codes and included conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respira-
tory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or
more, intracranial hemorrhage, neonatal sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and severe birth
trauma (S1 Table). The occurrence of any of these conditions, perinatal mortality, or neonatal
seizures composed a composite outcome of perinatal death/severe neonatal morbidity. In
addition, we compared maternal age-specific incidence of other adverse birth outcomes,
including preterm birth (<37 wk) and very preterm birth (<34 wk), small for gestational age
(<10th percentile), large for gestational age (>90th percentile), Apgar score < 3 at 5 min, and
NICU admission. SGA and LGA percentiles were derived from the US population [32].
Crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each maternal age category
(relative to 25–29 y) were used to describe the association between maternal age and severe
morbidities; we did not perform overall statistical significance tests yielding p-values. Logistic
regression was used to adjust for demographic and pre-pregnancy characteristics, including
race (non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and other—includ-
ing Asian), marital status (single/widowed/separated versus married/common law), pre-preg-
nancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy (no versus yes), parity, maternal education (high
school graduate or more education versus less than high school graduation), type of health
insurance (Medicaid, private, self-pay, other), fetal sex (female versus male), and year of child-
birth. Parity and BMI were modelled using splines with a maximum of three knots. Sensitivity
analyses were performed to adjust for underlying medical conditions (chronic hypertension,
diabetes mellitus) and assisted conception, to examine their impact on the results. In addition,
other pregnancy and labor characteristics (e.g., mode of delivery, labor induction) were added
as covariates. These factors can be considered as mediators on the causal pathway between
maternal age and maternal severe morbidity and adverse perinatal outcomes, and require
strong assumptions about the directionality of associations, and were therefore not adjusted
for in the main analyses. However, adjusting for these factors adds additional insight into the
risks of severe maternal morbidity among older women who do not have any apparent chronic
condition or indication for cesarean delivery.

 Besides ORs and adjusted ORs (AORs) and their 95% CIs, we also present crude and
adjusted risk differences (ARDs) with their 95% CIs to convey the magnitude of absolute risk
increases. The adjusted age-specific risk difference indicates the additional number of mothers
with adverse outcome above the baseline rate that would be expected if the same demographic
and pre-pregnancy characteristics as the reference group (25–29 y) were present.
Analyses were carried out using SAS 9.4. Missing values for BMI (approximately 10%) were
imputed using the multiple imputation procedure (PROC MI) in SAS. Other missing values
that constituted <3% of the total for a factor are not included in the tables, but are presented
in S2 Table. Except for BMI missing values (which were imputed), complete-case multivariable
analyses were performed.
Results
Overall, 952,212 mothers gave birth (live or stillbirth) in Washington State between 1 January
2003 and 31 December 2013. We excluded births that occurred out of state, multiple births,
births before 20 wk gestation, births to females aged <15 or >60 y (35,598 mothers, 3.7%),
births that occurred out of hospital (24,716 mothers, 2.6%), and births that could not be
matched with hospital records (64,609 mothers, 6.8%). The remaining 828,269 births were
included in the study. Women who delivered out of hospital or whose birth could not be
matched with hospital records were not substantially different from those included in the
study, except for type of health insurance (they were more likely to have “other” insurance—
other government insurance, student insurance, Indian Health Care, other health insurance
programs, or no insurance; S2 Table).
The largest proportion of births was to mothers 25–29 y of age (28.9%), 25.3% of births
were to mothers aged 30–35 y, and 22.5% of births were to mothers aged 20–24 y. Births to
teenage mothers comprised 7.6%, while births to older mothers aged 35–39, 40–44, and �45 y
comprised 12.7%, 2.8%, and 0.2% of all singleton births, respectively. Teenage mothers were
more likely to be Hispanic or African-American, while older mothers (35–39, 40–44, and �45
y) were more likely to be non-Hispanic white or “other” than were younger mothers (Table 1).
The proportions of non-married, nulliparous, and underweight women declined with
maternal age, while the proportions of women with assisted conception, obesity, diabetes mel-
litus, and chronic hypertension increased with age (Table 1). Cesarean delivery was more com-
mon among older women—especially primary and repeat cesarean delivery without labor
(Table 2).
The incidence of gestational diabetes increased markedly with maternal age, from 1.7%
among teen mothers to 15.7% among the oldest mothers (45–60 y). Nearly all women had
more than two prenatal care visits, with little variation between teenage mothers (97.7%) and
the oldest mothers (98.4%).
The overall rate of severe maternal morbidity/mortality was 1.6 per 100 deliveries. Most
severe maternal morbidity showed a J-shaped association with maternal age (Fig 1A; Table 3),
with elevated rates among teenage mothers, low rates among mothers 20–34 y of age, and a
sharp increase among mothers over 39 y of age.
An exception was the rate of maternal sepsis, which was highest among teen mothers (65.8
per 10,000 deliveries) and declined with maternal age (to 14–35 per 10,000 deliveries among
mothers over 34 y of age). Some severe morbid conditions had the lowest rate among teenage
mothers, with the rate increasing with maternal age, e.g., obstetric embolism, AFE, acute car-
diac morbidity, uterine rupture, and hysterectomy. The rates of severe PPH, renal failure, DIC,
complications of obstetric interventions, and potentially life-saving procedures increased rap-
idly in women above 39 y. Similarly, the rate of ICU admission increased sharply among

 mothers over 44 y of age (80.2 per 10,000 deliveries, compared to 7.1 per 10,000 deliveries
among mothers 20–24 y). The rate of the composite outcome of maternal death or severe mor-
bidity was 2.1% among teen mothers, 1.5% among mothers aged 25–29 y, and 3.6% among
mothers over 44 y of age. The J-shaped association was also evident between maternal age and
fetal/infant outcomes (S3 Table), except for the rates of large for gestational age and macroso-
mia, which were lowest among teen mothers.
Teen mothers were not at significantly elevated risk of severe maternal morbidity compared
to mothers aged 25–29 y after adjustment for maternal demographic and pre-pregnancy fac-
tors (Table 4; S1 Fig). They were significantly less likely to experience cerebrovascular morbid-
ity, acute cardiac morbidity, and complications of obstetric interventions. However, teen

 mothers were at elevated risk of sepsis (AOR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.4). After adjustment, the ORs
for most types of severe maternal morbidity remained significantly increased among women
over 39 y of age. In particular, mothers 40–44 y had a 3-fold higher risk of shock (AOR = 2.9,
95% CI 1.3–6.6), an 8-fold increased risk of AFE (AOR = 8.0, 95% CI 2.7–23.7), and consider-
ably elevated acute cardiac morbidity (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI 2.5–5.7), including cardiomyopathy
(AOR = 4.7, 95% CI 1.9–11.4; Table 4). Mothers 45–49 y had higher risk of renal failure
(AOR = 15.9, 95% CI 4.8–52), complications of obstetric interventions (AOR = 4.7, 95% CI
2.3–9.5), and ICU admission (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI 2.0–11.9).

 While the unadjusted absolute rates of adverse maternal outcomes continued to increase
with age among women over 39 y of age, the rates of adverse perinatal outcomes plateaued at
maternal age �45 y (Fig 1A). The adjusted rates of mortality/severe morbidity were substan-
tially lower (Fig 1B). The absolute rates of fetal and neonatal death and morbidity were ele-
vated among teen mothers, and the neonatal death rate remained higher after adjustment for

lower among teen mothers after adjustment.
Additional analyses showed that severe maternal morbidity and/or mortality increased dra-
matically among the oldest mothers (�50 y, n = 80). The AOR compared to mothers 25–29 y
increased from 1.6 at 40–44 y (95% CI 1.5–1.8) to 2.0 at 45–49 y (95% CI 1.4–2.9), and to 5.2 at

 50 y or more (95% CI 2.1–13.1). Such a trend among mothers �50 y was also observed for a
composite outcome of any perinatal or maternal death/severe morbidity (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI
1.6–7.8).
Sensitivity analyses revealed that the association between maternal age 45–49 y and some
severe maternal morbidities attenuated slightly after adjustment for chronic conditions (diabe-
tes mellitus and chronic hypertension) and assisted conception; the AOR for renal failure was
11.4 (95% CI 3.3–39.3). Additional adjustment for labor characteristics and mode of delivery
(S4 Table) further attenuated the association of age with some morbidities; however, a signifi-
cant increase in many severe morbidities remained among women aged 40 y or more. The risk
of renal failure remained significantly elevated among those �45 y even after additional adjust-
ment for pre-pregnancy and pregnancy hypertension and for preeclampsia (including eclamp-
sia and superimposed preeclampsia and eclampsia).
The adjusted risk difference (ARD) in overall severe maternal morbidity compared to
mothers 25–29 y and those 45–49 y was 1.6% (95% CI 0.7%–2.8%) and increased to 6.4% for
those �50 y (95% CI 1.7%–18.2%; S5 Table). The ARD for the composite outcome of any peri-
natal or maternal death/severe morbidity was 4.0% for women 45–49 y (95% CI 2.4%–5.9%)
and 8.1% for women �50 y (95% CI 1.9%–21.6%).
Discussion
Our results show elevated rates of severe maternal morbidity at the extremes of maternal age.
While the elevated risk among teenage mothers was mostly due to an increased rate of sepsis,
rates of all other causes of severe maternal morbidity were elevated among older mothers (�40
y). The absolute rates and ORs were lower after adjustment for demographic and pre-preg-
nancy factors but remained elevated for sepsis among teenage mothers and for all other mor-
bidities among older women. Our results confirm that perinatal mortality and neonatal
morbidity are elevated among teenage mothers and older mothers, as compared with mothers
aged 25–29 y [22–25]. The association between teenage motherhood and most adverse perina-
tal outcomes disappeared after adjustment for maternal demographic factors, with the excep-
tion of the neonatal death rate, which remained 50% higher.
Incidence rates of maternal morbidity in industrialized countries vary greatly depending on
the definition of “morbidity,” ranging from 0.4% to 31.1% [29–31,33–40], with the highest

 rates including any morbidity outside a normal delivery [40]. In the US, the population-based
incidence of severe maternal morbidity increased from 0.73% of hospital deliveries in 1998/
1999 to 1.63% in 2010/2011 [30,34], while hospital-based incidence rates ranged from 0.51% to
2.45% in 2012/2013 [31]. The incidence rate of severe maternal morbidity has been reported as
1.4% in both Canada (in 2007) [29] and Australia (in 2004) [35], 0.7% in the Netherlands (in
2004–2006) [36], 0.5% in England (in 2012/2013) [37], and 0.4% in Scotland (in 2001/2002)
[38]. These differences in severe morbidity rates are mainly due to varying definitions of severe
morbidity [29–31,33,36–40]. However, discrepancies may also arise due to differences in the
study populations, which can be defined geographically (including all births in the country/
region) [30,34–37] or as hospital-based or insurance-provider-based obstetric populations
[31,38]. The number of maternal deaths in our study is relatively low in comparison with the
US maternal mortality ratio reported by WHO [5,6]. However, the WHO reports include all
maternal deaths during pregnancy and postpartum, while our study captured only deaths
occurring during delivery hospitalization.
Aging leads to non-specific deterioration of most physiological functions [41], with chrono-
logical age being a marker for (but not equivalent to) biological or reproductive age. Elevated
cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory morbidity in older mothers can be partly attributed
to physiological changes associated with aging, including reduced cardiac reserve, muscle atro-
phy, atherosclerosis and other changes in the vasculature, and reduced lung function. Such
changes may not be clinically apparent in the absence of pregnancy, but the added physiologi-
cal burden of pregnancy can reveal a decline in organ function. This conclusion is supported
by our findings that adjustment for chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus decreased the
risk of renal failure and acute cardiac morbidity among women 35 y old or older. Pre-preg-
nancy risk factors, including higher BMI and assisted conception, may also be partly responsi-
ble for elevated severe morbidity among older mothers; elevated risks adjusted for pre-
pregnancy factors were substantially attenuated among older women. Previous obstetric his-
tory (e.g., prior cesarean delivery) and aging of reproductive organs may lead to dysfunctional
labor and higher rates of obstetric interventions (e.g., cesarean delivery), which increases the
risk of complications and therefore severe morbidity.
Higher rates of renal failure among older mothers are notable. Studies from North America
reported a temporal increase in the rate of renal failure from 2.3 per 10,000 delivery hospitali-
zations in 1998–1999 to 4.5 in 2008–2009 in the US [34], and from 1.6 per 10,000 deliveries in
2003 to 2.7 in 2010 in Canada [42]. The latter study also showed that the observed increase was
predominantly among women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, e.g., preeclampsia,
while the rate of acute renal failure was 2.8 times higher among mothers �40 y compared with
those 20–24 y. Our results indicate an even larger (16-fold) increased risk among mothers 45 y
or older. However, even after additional adjustment for pre-pregnancy and pregnancy hyper-
tension, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery, the risk of renal failure remained significantly
elevated among women �45 y.
Our finding of an elevated risk of sepsis (including septicemia during labor, major puer-
peral infection, systemic inflammatory response, and septic shock) among teen mothers is also
notable. Sepsis is recognized as one of the leading causes of maternal mortality [43]. Prior stud-
ies of the association between young maternal age and sepsis are sparse. A case—control study
from Scotland reported a 5-fold increase in the adjusted odds of sepsis among mothers <25 y
old compared with women older than 34 y [44], suggesting an even higher risk than we
observed. Untreated sepsis may lead to a cascade of sequential organ failure. It is possible that
the signs of generalized infection (hypotension, tachycardia, fever, oliguria, and hypoxemia)
are masked among young mothers by other compensatory mechanisms, leading to a delay in
timely recognition and antibiotic treatment. Young healthy women can compensate and mask

 symptoms such as decreased level of consciousness and pathologic hypotension. These find-
ings warrant further research into specific risk factors, etiopathogeneses, and compensatory
mechanisms among young mothers. They also warrant increased clinical vigilance and a
reduced threshold for considering early antibiotics in young mothers presenting with possible
signs of infection.
An increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes with advancing maternal age is well docu-
mented in many studies [45–55]; some have also reported elevated risks of antepartum hemor-
rhage, PPH, preeclampsia, and ICU admission [45,53]. However, we are aware of no previous
comprehensive assessment of associations between maternal age and potentially life-threaten-
ing maternal morbidity.
Strengths of our study include a large population database collected consistently over a pro-
longed study period and a unique breadth of relevant information from two linked databases.
These strengths enabled us to examine associations between maternal age and severe maternal
morbidity due to a wide variety of specific clinical conditions. Moreover, they provided better
control for confounding by maternal demographic and clinical variables than previous studies
when studying associations with adverse fetal/infant outcomes. For example, we were able to
adjust for maternal BMI (even though we had to impute approximately 10% of values that
were missing) and assisted conception. Such adjustment is not possible in most population-
based studies, which are therefore prone to residual confounding by these variables. BMI was
derived from the mother’s reported height and pre-pregnancy weight; this information has
been included in the latest revision of the national standard birth certificate in the US (2003)
[55]. BMI information is not validated using maternal pre-pregnancy measurement of height
and weight, but patterns of obesity among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-His-
panic Asian, and Hispanic women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey are comparable to those in the birth certificate data [56]. In addition, overall patterns of
pre-pregnancy obesity by state from the birth certificates generally correspond with those of all
adult women from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [55,57]. Education was self-
reported information abstracted from the medical charts. We used the indicator variable “less
than high school graduation” as a proxy for low socioeconomic status. Teenage mothers were
naturally less likely to have graduated from high school (due to their young age), which indi-
cates that these women were more likely to be disadvantaged with respect to their socioeco-
nomic status.
To maintain the consistency of our data sources, we limited the study to a time period
when the latest version of the US birth certificate (introduced in 2003 in Washington State)
was used to collect information on pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum events, while
hospitals continued to use ICD-9-CM codes. Using both validated data sources increases the
detection rate of maternal morbid conditions [58,59]. Moreover, any potential underreporting
would bias our results towards the null, as differential coding of major life-threatening medical
events based on maternal age is unlikely.
Our study also has several limitations. First, despite our large sample size, we did not have
sufficient statistical power to examine the association between maternal age and maternal
death or very rare severe morbidities; we therefore created larger categories of morbid condi-
tions and a composite outcome. Second, the degree of severity of some maternal morbidity
was not possible to ascertain from available ICD-9-CM codes. For example, the code for
eclampsia (ICD-9-CM code 642.6) did not include superimposed eclampsia (eclampsia after
chronic hypertension). A specific code for superimposed eclampsia was not available in ICD-
9-CM—only a code identifying mild/severe superimposed preeclampsia/eclampsia (ICD-
9-CM code 642.7). This latter condition was not included in our composite outcome of severe
maternal morbidity, as it would artificially inflate rates among older women, who are more

 likely to have chronic hypertension (and hence superimposed preeclampsia/eclampsia). The
exclusion of this condition likely led to underestimated rates and ORs of severe maternal mor-
bidity among older women. Third, errors and omissions in diagnostic coding are inevitable in
all large administrative databases. In our study, however, these should have resulted in non-
differential misclassification, as coding practices are unlikely to differ by maternal age. The
observed rates of severe morbidity may therefore be underestimates, and the ORs biased
towards the null. Finally, we were unable to adjust for income, which tends to be higher
among women who delay childbearing (because some women delay childbearing in order to
advance their career and achieve financial security) [60,61]. However, we did adjust for marital
status, education, race, and the type of medical insurance—all of which are highly associated
with income. We assessed a relatively large number of associations, and some may be statisti-
cally significant owing to chance. We excluded multiple births as they have specific pregnancy
complications (with higher rates of preterm birth and maternal/perinatal morbidity), which
were beyond the scope of this paper. This may affect the generalizability of our results to multi-
fetal pregnancies. We were unable to account for potential correlations among outcomes
among women who delivered more than once during the study period, because consecutive
pregnancies are not linked in the BERD dataset. This could affect the risk estimates, especially
for recurrent maternal morbidities such as severe PPH.
Conclusion
Although severe maternal morbidity is uncommon, older women experience increased risks of
severe morbidity during pregnancy. Counselling of older mothers should include information
on both fetal/neonatal risks and maternal risks. Health care providers should be aware of the
severe morbidities that can arise among older mothers and that can impact obstetrical care
delivery and resource utilization during labor, delivery, and postpartum.
