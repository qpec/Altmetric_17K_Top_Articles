The activation of a neuronal ensemble in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) during
alcohol withdrawal has been hypothesized to induce high levels of alcohol drinking in depen-
dent rats. In the present study we describe that the CeA neuronal ensemble that is activated by
withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure contains ~80% corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
neurons and that the optogenetic inactivation of these CeA CRF+ neurons prevents recruit-
ment of the neuronal ensemble, decreases the escalation of alcohol drinking, and decreases the
intensity of somatic signs of withdrawal. Optogenetic dissection of the downstream neuronal
pathways demonstrates that the reversal of addiction-like behaviors is observed after
the inhibition of CeA CRF projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and that
inhibition of the CRFCeA-BNST pathway is mediated by inhibition of the CRF-CRF1 system and
inhibition of BNST cell firing. These results suggest that the CRFCeA-BNST pathway could be
targeted for the treatment of excessive drinking in alcohol use disorder.

 A
lcohol addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder that is
associated with compulsive drinking, the loss of control
over intake, and the emergence of a negative emotional
state during abstinence from alcohol1. Animal and human studies
suggest a key role for the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)
in alcohol use disorders2–4. Chronic alcohol use alters CeA
neuronal transmission5–9, and the CeA has been shown to encode
alcohol-related memories10. The activation of a specific neuronal
ensemble in the CeA during alcohol withdrawal is associated with
high levels of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent rats4.
However, very little is known about the cellular phenotypes of
these neurons and the brain regions that are controlled by this
CeA neuronal ensemble.
Converging lines of evidence suggest that both alcohol and
alcohol withdrawal affect CRF neurotransmission in the CeA11,12.
Extracellular levels of CRF in the CeA increase during withdrawal
from chronic alcohol exposure1,13–15, and systemic or intra-CeA
administration of specific CRF1 receptor antagonists reduces
negative emotional states that are associated with alcohol with-
drawal and excessive alcohol drinking in dependent rats15–18.
However, no direct evidence has been reported that CeA CRF
neurons are responsible for these behaviors. Indeed, the activation
of CeA CRF1 receptors could result from the activation of CRF
neurons that are located in other brain regions that project to the
CeA, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST),
lateral hypothalamus (LH), and parasubthalamic nucleus (pSTN).
We hypothesized that CeA CRF neurons constitute a major
portion of the CeA neuronal ensemble that is recruited during
alcohol withdrawal. To test this hypothesis, we used Crh-Cre
transgenic rats19 that were tested in an animal model of alcohol
dependence combined with in vivo optogenetics and immediate
early gene brain mapping. We then dissected the role of the
different downstream CeA-CRF pathways in alcohol depen-
dence using the optogenetic inactivation of terminals from
CeA-CRF projections19. The results show that the withdrawal-
activated neuronal ensemble in the CeA contains largely CRF
neurons (~80%) and that inactivation of these CeA CRF+
neurons prevents recruitment of the CeA neuronal ensemble,
decreases dependence-induced alcohol drinking, and reduces
the intensity of alcohol withdrawal signs. Moreover, the opto-
genetic dissection of downstream neuronal pathways demon-
strates that this effect requires the activation of CeA CRF+
terminals in the BNST.
Results
CeA CRF neurons are recruited during alcohol withdrawal. We
first characterized the cellular phenotype of CeA neurons that are
activated during alcohol withdrawal4. Rats were trained to self-
administer alcohol and then were made alcohol-dependent by
exposure to chronic intermittent alcohol vapor to induce the
escalation of alcohol intake. After the stabilization of escalated
drinking (Fig. 1a), the animals were transcardially perfused with
4% buffered paraformaldehyde. The brains were harvested,
postfixed, and sectioned at 40 μm. Withdrawal from alcohol
vapor significantly increased the number of Fos+ neurons in the
CeA compared with naive rats (Fig. 1b). This increase was limited
to a small subpopulation of neurons in the CeA. The lateral CeA
(which contains the majority of CRF neurons19) exhibited
the largest increase in Fos+ neurons (Supplementary Figure 1).
Double-labeling with Fos/NeuN revealed that only 7–8% of all
CeA neurons (NeuN+) were also Fos+ (Supplementary Fig-
ure 1). Double Fos/CRF immunohistochemistry showed that the
total number of CRF neurons did not change between alcohol-
withdrawn and alcohol-naive rats (Fig. 1c), but the number of Fos
+/CRF+ neurons in the CeA significantly increased during
withdrawal (Fig. 1d) and accounted for most of the Fos+ neurons
(78.5 ± 3.8%).
Halorhodopsin inhibits CeA CRF neurons. To control the
activity of CeA CRF neurons, we selectively targeted them by
injecting AAV5-EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP in the CeA in Crh-Cre
rats19. The rats exhibited the Cre-dependent expression of
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) after the infusion of
AAV5-EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP in the CeA (Fig. 2a). Confocal
analysis at 63× magnification, followed by the three-dimensional
reconstruction of neuronal cell bodies and branches (Fig. 2b),
revealed that 99% of eYFP+ neurons were CRF-immunoreactive in
the cell soma or branches19. To validate our approach and confirm
the efficacy of NpHR in preventing CRF+ neuron firing, electro-
physiological recordings of neuronal activity from single neurons
were performed in acute CeA slices from Crh-Cre rats. Central
nucleus of the amygdala neurons were depolarized by a current
injection to evoke the sustained firing of action potentials. CRF+
neurons were identified by YFP fluorescence20. In six neurons that
showed fluorescence, the resting membrane potential was −64.3 ±
1.8 mV, and the input resistance was 276 ± 20 MΩ. Exposure to
light at 15 Hz from a green laser (532 nm)16 for 6.5 s elicited an
average hyperpolarization of 6.5 ± 1.0 mV (from −52.9 ± 0.4 to
−59.4 ± 1.0 mV), concomitant with a decrease in action potential
firing from 2.4 ± 0.35 to 0.25 ± 0.13 Hz (Fig. 2c). In another six
neurons that did not show fluorescence, the resting membrane
potential was −65.6 ± 1.7 mV, and the input resistance was 264 ±
15 MΩ, similar to the values that were obtained in fluorescent
neurons. However, exposure to the laser (6.5 s at 15 Hz) did not
significantly alter the membrane potential (51.8 ± 0.5 mV vs. 52.3 ±
0.3 mV) or the firing rate (2.02 ± 0.28 Hz vs. 1.98 ± 0.36 Hz;
Fig. 2d). This experiment was repeated with sustained 5 min illu-
mination of green light (HaloR, 532 nm) to mimic the in vivo
behavioral paradigm of light exposure. Exposure to 5 min con-
tinuous green light (HaloR, 532 nm)16 elicited an average hyper-
polarization of 8.5 ± 1.3 mV (from −52.5 ± 0.4 to −61 ± 1.2 mV),
concomitant with a robust decrease in action potential firing from
1.03 ± 0.13 to 0.4 ± 0.07 Hz (Supplementary Figure 4A, B).
Optogenetic inhibition of CeA CRF neurons. We next investi-
gated the effect of the bilateral optogenetic inhibition of CeA CRF
neurons on alcohol drinking in dependent and nondependent
rats. Crh-Cre rats were bilaterally infused in the CeA with AAV5-
EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP and implan-
ted with bilateral optical fibers in the CeA. After the acquisition of
alcohol self-administration, the optogenetic inhibition of CeA
CRF neurons was induced during the alcohol self-administration
session. In nondependent animals, CeA CRF neuron inhibition
(laser ON) did not affect drinking in control rats that expressed
eYFP or in NpHR-expressing rats. Water self-administration was
also unaffected by the green laser (Fig. 3b). After 6 weeks of
chronic intermittent alcohol vapor exposure, the animals esca-
lated their alcohol consumption (Fig. 3c). Activation of the green
laser selectively reduced alcohol self-administration in NpHR-
injected rats, without affecting water self-administration (Fig. 3d).
To verify that the effect of optical inhibition was not
attributable to nonspecific effects of prolonged (30 min) illumina-
tion of the CeA with the green laser, we measured alcohol
drinking after only 5 min of illumination. There was no difference
between the magnitude of the effect during the first 5 min and the
entire 30-min session (Supplementary Figure 2A). Activation of
the green laser did not affect saccharin intake in control or
NpHR-expressing rats (Fig. 3e), indicating that the effect of CeA
CRF neuronal inhibition was specific to escalated alcohol intake.
Activation of the green laser also did not affect the total distance

open field in control rats or NpHR-expressing rats, indicating
that the effects of laser stimulation on alcohol drinking were not
attributable to nonspecific locomotor effects.
Effects of unilateral inhibition of CeA CRF neurons. A group of
Crh-Cre rats (n = 12) was bilaterally infused with AAV5-EF1a-
DIO-NpHR-eYFP and implanted with unilateral optical fibers in
the CeA. Illumination with the green laser significantly reduced
alcohol self-administration (Fig. 4c). This effect was reversible
across 6 days of alternating the sessions with the laser ON and
OFF. Immediately before the last two alcohol self-administration
sessions, the rats were observed for somatic signs of withdrawal.
As shown in Fig. 4d, the laser ON group exhibited significant
decreases in ventromedial limb retraction and abnormal gait. The
sum of the five rating scores revealed a significant decrease in
overall withdrawal severity (Fig. 4d, inset) during the unilateral
inhibition of CeA-CRF neurons. Saccharin self-administration
was unaffected by the unilateral inhibition of CeA CRF neurons
(Fig. 4e). A separate group of rats (n = 15) was bilaterally infused
with AAV5-EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP and implanted with uni-
lateral optical fibers in the CeA to test the role of CeA CRF
neurons in the recruitment of the CeA neuronal ensemble during
withdrawal from chronic intermittent alcohol exposure. Rats were
made dependent using the same chronic intermittent alcohol
exposure protocol as in the previous experiments. Brains were
perfused after 8 h of alcohol withdrawal, 90 min after 30-min
exposure to the green laser. The optical inhibition (laser ON) of
CeA CRF neurons prevented the increase in Fos+ neurons that
was normally observed during withdrawal (laser OFF). Unilateral
inhibition also decreased the number of Fos+ neurons on the
contralateral side (Fig. 4f, j).
The CRFCeA-BNST pathway mediates alcohol drinking. Crh-Cre
rats (n = 12) were bilaterally infused with AAV5-EF1a-DIO-
NpHR-eYFP in the CeA and unilaterally implanted with an
optical fiber in the ventral BNST (Fig. 5b). They were then made
dependent on alcohol using the chronic intermittent exposure
procedure before testing the effect of optogenetic inhibition on
alcohol drinking, alcohol withdrawal signs, and saccharin self-
administration. The optogenetic inhibition of CRFCeA-BNST
terminals reduced alcohol self-administration to levels that were
similar to baseline pre-vapor exposure (Fig. 5c). Immediately
before the last two alcohol self-administration sessions, the rats
were observed for withdrawal signs 8 h into withdrawal. As
shown in Fig. 5d, the laser ON group exhibited significant
decreases in abnormal gait and body tremors. The sum of the five
rating scores revealed a significant decrease in overall withdrawal
severity after the inhibition of CRFCeA-BNST terminals. Saccharin
self-administration was unaffected by the optogenetic inhibition
of CRFCeA-BNST terminals (Fig. 5e).

 from cells in the BNST. In eight of 14 BNST neurons (resting
membrane potential −66.7 ± 1.4 mV), exposure to light from a
green laser (HaloR, 532 nm) at 15 Hz for 6.5 s decreased action
potential firing from 0.37 ± 0.06 to 0.22 ± 0.05 Hz (Supplementary
Figure 8). However, in the other six neurons (resting membrane
potential −64.6 ± 2.1 mV), similar laser exposure led to a less than
10% decrease (0.49 ± 0.09 Hz vs. 0.46 ± 0.03 Hz) in the firing rate,
and we considered these neurons “non-responders” (Supplemen-
tary Figure 8). This experiment was repeated with 5 min of
exposure to green light (HaloR, 532 nm) to mimic the behavioral
paradigm of light exposure. Continuous 5 min green light exposure
(HaloR, 532 nm)16 elicited a decrease in action potential firing from
0.91 ± 0.14 to 0.6 ± 0.1 Hz (Fig. 5f, g, Supplementary Figure 4C, D).
To determine the influence of CRF itself on the effects of the
optogenetic inhibition of CRFCeA-BNST terminals, we prepared a
separate cohort of Crh-Cre rats (n = 8) that were bilaterally
infused with AAV5-EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP in the CeA. We
prepared BNST slices as in the experiment above, with the
difference that optical inhibition was performed in slices that
were pretreated with the CRF1 receptor antagonist R121919. The
bath application of R121919 on the BNST slices for 15 min
significantly decreased action potential firing from 0.71 ± 0.13 to
0.43 ± 0.11 Hz. Exposure to 5 min continuous green light (HaloR,
532 nm) in the presence of R121919 did not significantly affect
the firing rate (from 0.42 ± 0.11 to 0.37 ± 0.10 Hz), suggesting that
R121919 occluded the effect of optogenetic inhibition and
indicating that the reduction of action potential firing that was
observed in BNST neurons after the optogenetic inhibition of
CRFCeA-BNST terminals (Fig. 5f, g) was mainly driven by
inhibition of the CRF-CRF1 system.
In contrast to the effects in the BNST, the inhibition of CeA-
CRF projections to the substantia innominata (CRFCeA-SI), lateral
hypothalamus/parasubthalamic nucleus (CRFCeA-LH/pSTN), and
parabrachial nucleus (CRFCeA-PBN) did not alter alcohol drinking
in dependent rats (see Supplementary Notes, Supplementary
Figures 5, 6, 7). As expected, the inhibition of CRFCeA-BNST
terminals in rats that were infused with the control virus (AAV5-
DIO-eYFP) did not alter alcohol consumption (Fig. 5h).

 Discussion
The present study found that CRF neurons comprise the majority
of neurons in the CeA neuronal ensemble that is recruited during
withdrawal and drives high levels of drinking in alcohol-dependent
rats. The optogenetic inhibition of CeA CRF neurons fully reversed
the escalation of alcohol drinking and partially alleviated somatic
signs of withdrawal in dependent rats, without affecting water or
saccharin self-administration. Selective optogenetic inhibition of
the CRFCeA-BNST pathway but not CRFCeA-SI, CRFCeA-LH/pSTN, or
CRFCeA-PBN pathway recapitulated the behavioral effects that were
observed when CeA CRF neurons were inhibited.
A key aspect of optogenetic approaches is the use of optoge-
netic and behavioral controls to ensure that the effects are rele-
vant and reproducible. We used several controls to ensure that (i)
the AAV5-EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP infusion that was combined
with green laser illumination prevented neuronal firing (Fig. 2),
(ii) the AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP control virus that was combined
with laser illumination had no effect on its own (Figs. 3d and 5c,
Supplementary Figure 5C, 6C, 7C), (iii) the behavioral effects
were reversible (Figs. 3d and 5c), (iv) the behavioral effects were
observed after both long (30 min) and short (5 min) durations of
illumination (Supplementary Figure 2), (v) 5 min of light inhi-
bition resulted in the same effects in slices as 6.5 s, and (vi) the
behavioral effects on alcohol drinking in dependent rats were not
attributable to nonspecific behavioral effects. Such behavioral
controls included water self-administration (Fig. 3), saccharin
self-administration (Figs. 3 and 5, Supplementary Figures 5, 6, 7),
and locomotor activity (Fig. 3) in alcohol-dependent animals and
alcohol self-administration in nondependent animals (Fig. 3).
Moreover, the results showed decreases in alcohol drinking in

 dependent rats after the bilateral inhibition of CeA CRF neurons,
and these effects were replicated by the unilateral inhibition of
CeA CRF cell bodies (Fig. 4) and CRFCeA-BNST terminals (Fig. 5).
Previous work has shown that alcohol withdrawal induces Fos
expression in CeA neurons4, but the phenotype of these neurons
and the mechanism that is responsible for their activation were
unknown. In the present study, we found that such Fos induction
is limited to a very small subpopulation (~7–8% of all NeuN+
CeA neurons; Supplementary Figure 1) in all subregions of the
CeA, although the central lateral amygdala (CeL; which contains
the majority of CRF neurons19) exhibited the largest increase in
Fos+ neurons (Supplementary Figure 1). The total number of
CRF neurons did not change between groups (Fig. 1), but the
number of double-labeled Fos+/CRF+ neurons in the CeA sig-
nificantly increased during withdrawal from alcohol. Finally,
neuronal phenotyping showed that Fos was induced in both
CRF+ and CRF− neurons, but CRF+ neurons represented ~80%
of the Fos+ population. These findings indicate that most CeA
neurons in the ensemble that was activated during alcohol
withdrawal expressed CRF. Moreover, the results showed that the

 inactivation of CeA CRF neurons completely prevented recruit-
ment of the CeA neuronal ensemble that includes both CRF+
and CRF− neurons. These results are consistent with our pre-
vious work that showed that the chemogenetic stimulation of
CeA CRF neurons recruited a population of CRF+ and CRF−
neurons in the CeL and medial amygdala (CeM) and that the
activation of CRF+ and CRF− neurons was prevented by a CRF1
receptor antagonist19. Additionally, the unilateral inactivation of
CeA CRF neurons was sufficient to partially inhibit Fos expres-
sion in the contralateral CeA, indicating that the CeA on both
sides is functionally connected and suggesting
a possible
mechanism to explain the robust effect of unilateral CeA inhi-
bition on alcohol drinking. Central nucleus of the amygdala CRF
neurons are γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, and the activation
of CRF1 receptors in the CeL increases glutamate release locally11,
suggesting that the recruitment of CRF+ and CRF− neurons in
the neuronal ensemble may be mediated by the activation of
CRF1 receptors on glutamatergic terminals21. Moreover, higher
GABAergic transmission in the CeL may also lead to the acti-
vation of CeM neurons through disinhibition via GABAergic
interneurons22,23. A large body of evidence shows that CRF,
glutamate, and GABA systems in the CeA play an important
role in alcohol dependence13,15,24,25. Both acute alcohol with-
drawal and activation of the CRF-CRF1 system increase CeA
glutamate8,11 and GABA release in rats6,7 and mice26, suggesting
that the activation of CRF neurons and recruitment of glutama-
tergic and GABAergic transmission contribute to recruitment of
the CeA neuronal ensemble during alcohol withdrawal.
At the behavioral level, we found that the optogenetic inacti-
vation of CeA CRF neurons reversibly decreased alcohol drinking
in dependent rats to levels that were similar to baseline alcohol
drinking before the induction of dependence. The inactivation of
CeA CRF neurons had no effect on saccharin self-administration
or locomotor activity, with no effect of the laser in the control
groups. These results suggest that the decrease in drinking that
was observed with NpHR was specific to alcohol drinking in

 dependent rats and not simply attributable to nonspecific effects
on other behaviors. However, still unknown are the downstream
neuronal pathways that mediate this behavioral effect.
We recently found that CeA CRF neurons send projections to
the BNST, SI, LH/pSTN, and PBN, but the role of each CRF
projection in alcohol drinking was unknown. In the present
study, we found that inactivation of the CRFCeA-BNST projection
but not the CRFCeA-SI, CRFCeA-LH/pSTN, or CRFCeA-PBN projec-
tion fully recapitulated the effects of the inactivation of CeA CRF
neurons. In slice experiments, we found that the inhibition of
CeA CRF axon terminals in the BNST reduced the firing of a
subpopulation of BNST neurons. This result is consistent with
previous studies that reported that CRF can enhance spontaneous
excitatory transmission in the BNST through an increase
in glutamate release27,28. A similar potentiation of excitatory
transmission by CRF has been reported in the CeA and the lateral
septum mediolateral nucleus29. Importantly, not all of the neu-
rons that were patched in the BNST were responsive to light
inhibition. This is consistent with a previous study that showed
that the potentiation of excitatory transmission by CRF in the
BNST is only observed in a small population of BNST neurons27.
The reduction of firing in BNST neurons after the inhibition of
CeA CRF axon terminals in the BNST was mediated by CRF.

mimicked the effect of optogenetic inhibition by reducing action
potential firing and occluded the effect of optogenetic inhibition,
strongly suggesting that the behavioral effects that were observed
after the optogenetic inhibition of CRF CeA neurons and
CRFCeA-BNST terminals is mediated by the CRF-CRF1 system.
Converging evidence suggests that neuropeptides, including
CRF, that are produced locally or project to the BNST are critical
for the modulation of neuronal transmission in the BNST and the
emergence of fear30, negative emotional states, and addiction-like
behaviors31–35. Consistent with these findings, in vivo micro-
dialysis revealed higher extracellular levels of CRF in the BNST
and CeA during alcohol withdrawal13,14. However, the local
administration of a CRF receptor antagonist in the dorsolateral
BNST failed to reduce excessive alcohol drinking in dependent
rats16, whereas the administration of a CRF receptor antagonist in
the CeA decreased alcohol drinking in dependent rats9,16.
Nevertheless, the present results demonstrate that CRF terminals
in the ventral BNST are critical for excessive alcohol drinking in
dependent rats, suggesting that the role of CRF in alcohol
drinking may be subregion-specific in the BNST. Alternatively,
the effects we observed on alcohol intake may have been partially
mediated by other co-neurotransmitters, such as GABA, dynor-
phin, or somatostatin, considering the high degree of colocali-
zation and overlap between these neurotransmitters in this
population of neurons19,36–38. Future studies that investigate the
Cre-dependent
downregulation
of
GABA,
dynorphin,
and
somatostatin may shed light on this possibility.
The present results also showed that the inhibition of CeA
terminals in the BNST completely inhibited the withdrawal-
induced escalation of alcohol consumption in dependent rats. The
mechanism for this marked reduction of alcohol drinking might
be related to a decrease in withdrawal symptoms that leads to less
negative reinforcement that is associated with alcohol consump-
tion. However, inhibition had no impact on three of the five
withdrawal signs that were evaluated. One explanation for this
result may be that somatic signs provide behavioral evidence of
alcohol withdrawal39, but they do not directly measure the
negative affective state that is thought to drive the escalation of
drinking40. Another possibility may be that the CRFCeA-BNST
pathway plays a role in associative learning, and the inhibition of
this pathway inhibits memories of the ameliorative effects of
alcohol. Such a mechanism could be involved in mitigating the
escalation of alcohol consumption despite the persistence of some
withdrawal signs. Further studies are needed to discriminate
between these different possibilities.
In summary, the present study found that the activation of CeA
CRF neurons during withdrawal was required for the recruitment
of a CeA neuronal ensemble that is responsible for excessive
alcohol drinking in dependent rats. Inactivation of the CRFCeA-
BNST pathway completely reversed the escalation of alcohol
drinking during withdrawal and partially prevented the somatic
signs of alcohol withdrawal. Inactivation of the CRFCeA-SI,
CRFCeA-LH/pSTN, and CRFCeA-PBN pathways did not impact
alcohol drinking or somatic signs of withdrawal. Future studies
are needed to (i) examine the role of the CRFCeA-BNST pathway in
females, (ii) determine whether our negative findings with
the CRFCeA-SI, CRFCeA-LH/pSTN, and CRFCeA-PBN pathways
are
attributable
to
technical
limitations,
(iii)
determine
whether these three pathways are involved in other aspects of
alcohol dependence that were not examined in the present study,
and (iv) determine the effect of the optogenetic inhibition of
CRFCeA-BNST, CRFCeA-SI, CRFCeA-LH/pSTN, and CRFCeA-PBN
terminals in nondependent animals.
Overall, the present study identified a neuronal ensemble of
alcohol abstinence in the CeA that is under the control of CeA
CRF neurons and that activation of the CRFCeA-BNST pathway is
required for the escalation of alcohol drinking and expression of
alcohol withdrawal signs in dependent animals. Finally, we
demonstrate that inhibition of the CRFCeA-BNST pathway is
mediated via inhibition of the CRF-CRF1 system and the inhi-
bition of BNST cell firing. These results identify a critical neu-
ronal ensemble for addiction-like behavior and suggest that the
CRFCeA-BNST pathway could be targeted for the treatment of
excessive drinking in alcohol use disorder.
Methods
Subjects. Adult male Crh-Cre rats19, 2-months-old and weighing 200–225 g at the
beginning of the experiments, were housed in groups of two per cage (self-
administration groups) in a temperature-controlled (22 °C) vivarium on a 12 h/12
h light/dark cycle (lights on at 10:00 PM) with ad libitum access to food and water.
All of the behavioral tests were conducted during the dark phase of the light/dark
cycle. All of the procedures adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute.
Operant self-administration. Self-administration sessions were conducted in
standard operant conditioning chambers (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT, USA).
For the alcohol self-administration studies, the animals were first trained to self-
administer 10% (v/v) alcohol and water solutions until a stable response pattern
(20 ± 5 rewards) was maintained. The rats were subjected to an overnight session in
the operant chambers with access to one lever (right lever) that delivered water
(fixed-ratio 1 [FR1]). Food was available ad libitum during this training. After
1 day off, the rats were subjected to a 2 h session (FR1) for 1 day and a 1 h session
(FR1) the next day, with one lever delivering alcohol (right lever). All of the
subsequent alcohol self-administration sessions lasted 30 min. The rats were
allowed to self-administer a 10% (v/v) alcohol solution (right lever) and water (left
lever) on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement (i.e., each operant response was
reinforced with 0.1 ml of the solution). For the saccharin self-administration study,
the rats underwent daily 30 min FR1 sessions. Responses on the right lever resulted
in the delivery of 0.1 ml of saccharin (0.04%, w/v). Lever presses on the left lever
delivered 0.1 ml of water. This procedure lasted 13 days until a stable baseline of
intake was reached.
Alcohol vapor chambers. The rats were previously trained to self-administer
alcohol in the operant chambers. Once a stable baseline of alcohol intake was
reached, the rats were made dependent by chronic intermittent exposure to alcohol
vapors. They underwent cycles of 14 h ON (blood alcohol levels during vapor
exposure ranged between 150 and 250 mg%) and 10 h OFF, during which beha-
vioral testing for acute withdrawal occurred (i.e., 6–8 h after the vapor was turned
OFF, when brain and blood alcohol levels are negligible). In this model, rats exhibit
somatic and motivational signs of withdrawal41.
Operant self-administration and withdrawal scores. Behavioral testing occurred
three times per week. The rats were tested for alcohol or saccharin (and water)

 self-administration on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement in 30-min sessions.
Behavioral signs of withdrawal were measured using a rating scale that was adapted
from a previous study42 and included ventromedial limb retraction (VLR), irrit-
ability to touch (vocalization), tail rigidity, abnormal gait, and body tremors. Each
sign was given a score of 0–2, based on the following severity scale: 0 = no sign,
1 = moderate, 2 = severe. The sum of the four observation scores (0–8) was used as
an operational measure of withdrawal severity.
Intracranial surgery. For intracranial surgery, the animals were anesthetized with
isoflurane. For the behavioral experiments, a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus
that carried inhibitory opsins, AAV-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-
eYFP (Vector Core, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA), was
injected bilaterally or unilaterally in the CeA (coordinates from bregma: anterior/
posterior, −2.6 mm; medial/lateral, ± 4.2 mm; dorsal/ventral, −6.1 mm from skull
surface). The injection was made through a stainless-steel injector that was 2 mm
longer than the guide cannula (so that its tip protruded into the area) and con-
nected to a 10 μl Hamilton syringe, which was controlled by an UltraMicroPump
(WPI, Sarasota, FL, USA). Virus was injected (1.0 μl, 100 nl/min) over 10 min,
followed by an additional 10 min to allow diffusion of the viral particles. For the
rats that were destined for the behavioral experiments, chronic optical fibers were
implanted bilaterally or unilaterally above the CeA (coordinates from bregma:
anterior/posterior, −2.6 mm; medial/lateral, ± 4.2 mm; dorsal/ventral, −8.1 mm
from skull surface) and unilaterally above the BNST (coordinates from bregma:
anterior/posterior, −0.1 mm; medial/lateral, ± 1.4 mm; dorsal/ventral, −6.7 mm
from skull surface), LH/pSTN (coordinates from bregma: anterior/posterior,
−4.2 mm; medial/lateral, ± 1.2 mm; dorsal/ventral, −8.7 mm from skull surface),
SI (coordinates from bregma: anterior/posterior, −0.1 mm; medial/lateral, ± 1.8
mm; dorsal/ventral, −8.5 mm from skull surface), and PBN (coordinates from
bregma: anterior/posterior, −9.2 mm; medial/lateral, ± 1.8 mm; dorsal/ventral,
−6.5 mm from skull surface). Following surgery, the rats were allowed to recover
for 1 week.
Viral vectors. We used commercially available adenoviral constructs (Vector Core,
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) for all of the experiments. All
of the viruses were distributed into 10-μl aliquots, kept at −80°C, and thawed
immediately before the injections.
Locomotor activity. Locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated
in an opaque open field apparatus (100 cm × 100 cm × 40 cm) that was divided into
20 cm × 20 cm squares. On the experimental day, the animals were placed in the
center of the open field, and locomotor activity (number of lines crossed), the time
in the center, total distance traveled, and entries into the center were scored for 10
min. Behavior was videotaped, and AnyMaze software was used to analyze the
recordings.
Optical inhibition. Optical probes were constructed, in which the optical fiber
(200 µm core, multimode, 0.37 NA) was inserted and glued into a ceramic ferrule.
The optical fiber and ferrule were then glued to a metallic cannula and closed with
a dust cap. The optical fiber length was then adjusted based on the brain area of
interest to not leave a gap between the skull and cannula during surgery. The other
end of the optical fiber (FC/PC connection) was attached to a fiber splitter (2 × 1)
that permitted simultaneous, bilateral illumination. The single end of the splitter
was attached to a rotating optical commutator (Doric Lenses) to permit free
movement of the rat. The commutator was connected to a fiber that was connected
to a laser (DPSS, 200 or 300 mW, 532 nm, with a multimode fiber coupler for an
FC/PC connection; OEM Laser Systems). Prior to the experiments, the light output
of the optical fiber was adjusted to ~10 mW, measured by an optical power meter.
Based on measurements in the mammalian brain43 and assuming a geometric loss
of light, a light output of 10 mW that is measured by a standard optical power at
the tip of a fiber with an NA of 0.37 and fiber core radius of 200 µm will produce
~1 mW/mm2 of light up to 1 mm directly away from the fiber tip, which is the
minimum amount necessary to produce opsin activation22,44. Based on in vivo
measurements of the shape of the light output in mammalian brain tissue, these
parameters would be expected to provide sufficient light for opsin activation in at
least 0.4 mm3 of tissue45. Optical fibers were implanted at the same time as the
virus injections, and the animals were habituated to tethering to the commutator
for several self-administration sessions before beginning the experiments. On the
test days, the rats received optical inhibition paired with alcohol self-administration
sessions, locomotor activity assessments, or withdrawal score assessments.
Recruitment of CeA CRF neurons during alcohol withdrawal. The animals were
trained to self-administer 10% alcohol and made dependent on alcohol using the
chronic intermittent exposure model. After the stabilization of excessive drinking,
the animals were transcardially perfused. The brains were harvested, postfixed, and
sectioned at 40 μm.
Inhibition of CeA CRF neurons. The animals were injected with AAV-DIO-
eNpHR3.0-eYFP or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP and implanted with bilateral optical
fibers in the CeA. One week after surgery, the rats were trained to self-administer
10% alcohol until they reached a stable baseline of intake. At this point, the
experiment began, and the rats were tested for alcohol self-administration during
the optical inhibition of CeA CRF neurons. Sham optical inhibition sessions were
performed before and after the test session. The animals were then placed in the
alcohol vapor chambers and 3 weeks later underwent the alcohol self-
administration escalation phase. When the escalation of alcohol intake was
achieved, the animals were tested for the effects of the optical inhibition of CeA
CRF neurons as described above. The effect of optical inhibition on somatic
withdrawal signs was also assessed.
At the end of this phase, the rats were trained to self-administer saccharin for
several sessions until a stable baseline of responses was reached. They were then
tested for the effects of the optical inhibition of CeA CRF neurons on saccharin
self-administration. The effects of optical inhibition on locomotor activity were also
assessed.
Dissection of the role of different CeA CRF pathways. Crh-Cre rats were
bilaterally infused with AAV5-EF1a-DIO-NpHR-eYFP in the CeA, unilaterally
implanted with optical fibers in the CeA, BNST, PBN, SI, and LH, and made
dependent on alcohol using the chronic intermittent exposure model. After the
escalation of drinking, the animals were tested for the effect of the optogenetic
inhibition of CeA CRF projections on alcohol drinking, alcohol withdrawal signs,
and saccharin self-administration.
Immunohistochemistry. Crh-Cre rats were implanted with unilateral optical fibers
in the CeA and tested for the effect of inhibition of the CeA for 30 min during
withdrawal (8 h) from chronic intermittent alcohol. Ninety minutes later, the
animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 100 ml of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) followed by 400 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were post-
fixed in paraformaldehyde overnight and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS/0.1%
azide solution at 4°C for 2–3 days. Brains were frozen in powdered dry ice and
sectioned on a cryostat. Coronal sections were cut 40 µm thick between bregma +
4.2 and −6.48 mm46 and collected free-floating in PBS/0.1% azide solution. Fol-
lowing three washes in PBS, the sections were incubated in 1% hydrogen peroxide/
PBS to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed three times in PBS, and
blocked for 60 min in PBS that contained 0.3% TritonX-100, 1 mg/ml bovine
serum albumin, and 5% normal donkey serum. The sections were incubated for 24
h at 4°C with rabbit monoclonal anti-Fos antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
catalog no. 2250) diluted 1:1000 in PBS/0.5% Tween-20 and 5% normal donkey
serum. The sections were washed again with PBS and incubated for 1 h in undi-
luted Rabbit ImmPress HRP reagent (Vector Laboratories). After washing in PBS,
the sections were developed for 2–6 min in Vector peroxidase DAB substrate
(Vector Laboratories) enhanced with nickel chloride. Following PBS rinses, the
sections were mounted on coated slides (Fisher Super Frost Plus), air dried,
dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol, cleared with Citrasolv (Fisher Sci-
entific), and coverslipped with DPX (Sigma).
Quantitative analysis to obtain unbiased estimates of the total number of Fos+
cell bodies was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot Microscope equipped with
MicroBrightField Stereo Investigator software (Colchester, VT, USA), a three-axis
Mac 5000 motorized stage (Ludl Electronics Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA), a Q
Imaging Retiga 2000R color digital camera, and a PCI color frame grabber.
Double-labeled immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was used to
characterize the type (CRF) and number (NeuN) of neurons that were activated
(Fos+) during alcohol withdrawal. Coronal sections were cut 40 µm thick between
bregma −2.0 and −5.0 mm46. We determined the proportion of all neurons that
expressed Fos during alcohol withdrawal by double-labeling for Fos and the
neuron-specific protein NeuN and the population of activated CRF neurons in the
CeA by double labeling for Fos and CRF.
For Fos/NeuN and Fos/CRF double-labeling, 40 µm sections were washed three
times in PBS and permeabilized/blocked for 60 min in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100,
5% normal donkey serum, and 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking solution). The
sections were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 24 h
on a shaker at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used at the following
concentrations: anti-Fos (1:500, Millipore, catalog no. AB4532) and anti-NeuN
(1:1000, Millipore, catalog no. MAB377). The sections were washed three times in
PBS for 10 min and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies
diluted in PBS for 2 h on a shaker at room temperature. The secondary antibodies
were Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit (1:500, Invitrogen, catalog no. A-
10042), Alexa Fluor 568-labeled donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen, catalog no.
S-11249), and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled donkey anti-goat (1:500, Invitrogen, catalog
no. A-21447). After labeling, the sections were washed three times in PBS for 10
min, mounted on Fisher Superfrost Plus slides (catalog no. 12-550-15), and
coverslipped with PVA-Dabco (Sigma).
We quantified Fos+/CRF+ expression when a neuron exhibited a Fos staining
pattern as a focused nucleus (red) and a cytoplasm that was stained for CRF
(green). Three sections from each rat were bilaterally quantified within the
boundary of the CeA and normalized by area, measured by Fiji software. Counts
from all images for each rat were averaged so that each rat was an n of 1. For DAB

 staining, brown (NeuN) and black (Fos) channels were color-separated using Fiji
software to isolate the red channel. Using the red channel as the background
channel for thresholding leaves dark nuclei from the black (Fos) channel easy to
identify and threshold. Thresholding was applied under the same conditions for
both naive and withdrawal. Thresholded images were counted for positive foci
within the nucleus of NeuN-positive neurons.
Confocal acquisition and three-dimensional analysis. Three-dimensional stacks
of images were acquired with a 780 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Zeiss)
using a 20× (1 μm image slice), 40× (0.6 μm image slice), or 63× (0.2 μm image
slice) objective to observe the entirety of the CeA. The system is equipped with a
stitching stage and Zen software to reintegrate the tiled image stacks. Stitched z-
series images of the entire CeA were imported into Imaris software (Bitplane-
Andor) and Fiji for quantification.
Slice preparation for whole-cell recordings. Crh-Cre rats (n = 20) that received
bilateral infusions of rAAV5/Ef1a-DIO eNpHR in the CeA were deeply anesthe-
tized with 3% isoflurane 4–5 weeks after virus infusion and transcardially perfused
with ice-cold oxygenated sucrose solution. The rats were then decapitated. Brains
were rapidly removed and placed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ice-cold cutting
solution that contained 206 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 7 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM glucose, and 5 mM HEPES. Slices
of the CeA or BNST (300 μm) were cut on a VT1000S Vibratome (Leica Micro-
systems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) and transferred to oxygenated artificial cere-
brospinal fluid (aCSF) that contained 130 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 24 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM
glucose. The slices were first incubated for 30 min at 37°C and then kept at room
temperature for the remainder of the experiment. Individual slices were transferred
to a recording chamber that was mounted on the stage of an upright microscope
(Olympus BX50WI, Waltham, MA, USA) and continuously perfused in oxyge-
nated aCSF at a rate of 2–3 ml/min. Neurons were visualized with a 60× water
immersion objective (Olympus), infrared differential interference contrast optics,
and charge-coupled device camera (EXi Blue, QImaging, Surrey, Canada). Whole-
cell recordings were performed with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1440 A,
and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Patch pipettes
(4-7 MΏ) were pulled from borosilicate glass (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT,
USA) and filled with the following internal solution: 70 mM KMeSO4, 55 mM KCl,
10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.2 mM Na-GTP.
To elicit neuronal inhibition, green light (532 nm) was turned ON for 6.5 s or 5
min via a Master-8 stimulator (AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel) that generated a light train
at 15 Hz. Neurons that expressed eNpHR within the CeA were visualized with
differential interference contrast and widefield fluorescence imaging using an
Olympus 60× immersion objective. To identify eNpHR-expressing neurons, a
Lambda DG-4 light source was used with an in-line EX540/EM630 filter set. A
Mosaic 3 pattern illuminator (Andor Instruments, Belfast, UK) coupled to a 532
nm light-emitting diode (CoolLED Limited, Andover, UK) was attached to the
microscope and used for light delivery (10 mW/mm2, to approximate output in the
behavioral experiments) through the objective within the slice preparation.
Histology. Following completion of the behavioral experiments, the rats were
deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused. Brains were removed, and 40 μm
coronal slices that contained the CeA, BNST, SI, LH-pSTN, and PBN were cut on a
cryostat. The brain slices were mounted on microscope slides, and the expression of
viral vectors and/or optical fiber placements were examined for all of the rats using
fluorescent microscopy. Rats that had no YFP expression in the CeA because of
faulty microinjections or had fiber placements that failed to target the regions of
interest were excluded from the behavioral analysis.
Statistical analysis. The data are expressed as mean ± SEM. For comparisons
between only two groups, p values were calculated using paired or unpaired t-tests
as described in the figure legends. Comparisons across more than two groups were
made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and two-way ANOVA was
used when there was more than one independent variable. Data from experiments
that tested the effect of the unilateral optogenetic inhibition of CeA CRF neurons
on the escalation of alcohol self-administration in dependent rats were analyzed
using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, with time and laser illumination as
within-subjects factors (see Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Figures 4, 5, 6). In the
same experiments, differences between baseline intake before dependence and
intake after vapor exposure (ON and OFF days; see Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary
Figures 4, 5, 6) were analyzed using separate one-way repeated-measures ANO-
VAs. Significant effects in the ANOVA were followed by the Newman Keuls post
hoc test. Withdrawal signs were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
U statistic, followed by Dunn’s multiple-comparison test. The standard error of the
mean is indicated by error bars for each group of data. Differences were considered
significant at p < 0.05. All of these data were analyzed using Statistica 7 software.
