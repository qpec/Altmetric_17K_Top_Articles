How an aging society affects the economic
costs of inactivity in Germany: empirical
evidence and projections

Abstract
Background: Aging societies represent a major challenge for health care systems all over the world. As older people
tend to be more physically inactive, economic costs of inactivity are likely to increase notably. The present
study aims to investigate this relationship between an aging society and economic costs of inactivity using
the example of Germany.
Methods: Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, this study applied the comparative risk assessment
method developed by the WHO to estimate the direct costs of inactivity for the period 2001–2013 differentiated by
gender-specific age-groups (15–29; 30–44; 45–64; 65+). Based on population statistics predicting the aging of the
German population for the years 2014–2060, this research projects the development of future costs of inactivity and
potential effects of interventions promoting physical activity among the German population.
Results: The results reveal an increase in the level of physical activity during the observed period (2001–2013) which
compensated the negative effect of aging and resulted in a decline of inactivity costs. The projections for the years
2014–2060 indicate a constant increase in direct per capita costs until 2060 because of an aging society. Scenarios
indicating how a short-term reduction of physical inactivity impacts costs of inactivity reveal the crucial role of the
oldest age-group in this context.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that the aging of the German population demands further actions and initiatives to
promote physical activity, especially for the oldest age-group.

Background
Demographic trends projected over the next decades
indicate a considerable aging of the world’s population
[1]. Notable changes in societies’ age structure caused by
expected dynamics in fertility, life expectancy, and
migration will challenge public health systems from
countries all over the world [2]. For example, Richardson
and Robertson [3] predicted an annual increase in total
health spending of 0.6% from 1995 to 2051 caused by
the aging of the Australian population. For the United
States, Alemayehu and Warner [4] projected an increase
in total per capita health costs of 20% due to aging from
2000 to 2030 with an annual increase of 0.6% and the
European Commission [5] stated that only because of
demographic changes public health care expenditure in
the European Union would increase from 6.9% to 8% of
national gross domestic product (GDP) between 2013
and 2060. While the above studies have looked at an
aggregated effect of aging, another stream of research has
conducted a disaggregated analysis by investigating the
incidence of various diseases, such as cardiovascular
diseases, pelvic floor disorders, and obesity and forecasting
the respective costs over the next decades [6–8]. The
results of this research have indicated that aging affects
some clinical conditions more than others, especially heart
and vascular diseases [9].
As a consequence, governments developed strategies
to counteract the alarming development for certain
clinical
conditions.
To
that
end,
physical

 represents an effective mechanism. Research has identi-
fied particularly older people to be physically inactive
[10]. While there appears no linear relationship between
age and physical activity [11], people tend to reduce
their level of physical activity from a certain age onwards
[12]. Given that age-appropriate physical activity benefits
the elderly in numerous ways, such as reduced inci-
dences of high blood pressure, stroke, Type 2 diabetes,
and cancer [13], high rates of inactivity can be consid-
ered a major driver of age-related health care costs.
Therefore, governments have tried to promote physical
activity among older population groups, for example
through campaigns [14], provision of specific facilities
[15], or activity-friendly neighborhoods in general [16].
With regard to health care costs, increasing physical
activity rates is important because inactivity was identi-
fied to be associated with considerable costs for public
health care systems in general [17–21]. Across countries,
the identified direct costs linked to physical inactivity
were found to represent between 1% and 2.6% of total
direct health care costs [22]. In addition, indirect costs
of inactivity, such as productivity losses caused by early
death or disabilities, were found to even exceed the
direct costs of inactivity [18, 19]. Given the substantial
body of research dealing with this topic, Pratt et al. ([22],
p. 173) noted that the cost burden of inactivity in wealthy
countries might have been adequately examined already,
but that future research would be needed for a “clinically
important subpopulation such as older adults”.
The overarching objective of this research is to exam-
ine how an aging population affects the economic costs
of inactivity and how physical activity can assist govern-
ments in compensating rising health care costs of aging
societies. The research context for this study is Germany
– one of the Western countries which will be affected by
an aging population in the next decades [23]. The
present analysis serves three main purposes. The first
purpose concerns the estimation of empirical evidence
from the past. For the period 2001–2013, direct costs of
inactivity are estimated for different age-groups and
related to the aging society in this period. The second
purpose is to extrapolate the future development of
direct costs of inactivity. Specifically, direct costs of
inactivity will be projected for the years 2014–2060 by
considering forecasts about the aging of the German
population. The third purpose represents the projection of
the impact of future physical activity promotion on the
development of the direct costs of inactivity. Different
scenarios including fictive reductions in physical inactivity
levels are estimated.
The contribution of this study to the existing literature
is three-fold. First, it is one of the first studies estimating
the development of direct costs of inactivity over a
longer
period
of
time.
Existing
studies
have
only
estimated the costs for one specific year. Second, it
provides projections about the development of future
costs of inactivity in the context of an aging society
and thirdly, this study aims to quantify potential
economic savings which could be generated through
short-term physical activity promotion and resulting
reduction
in
inactivity
levels,
respectively.
These
projections are important for policy development in
light of an aging society.
Methods
Data sources
The first purpose, the estimation of inactivity costs for
the period 2001–2013, requires information about the
annual direct health costs and annual inactivity rates.
The Federal Statistical Office [24] provided annual direct
per capita health costs of several diseases differentiated
by gender-specific age-groups (15–29, 30–44, 45–64,
and 65+) for the years 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008. Infla-
tion was considered and all expenditures were converted
into 2008 prices. Cost data before or after 2002–2008
were not available. Therefore, this study used an aver-
age of these four years taking into account random
cost
drivers
(e.g.
medicine
prices,
technological
innovation) for every year. The cost variable only
contains information about direct costs of diseases,
including curative treatment, prevention, rehabilita-
tion, and continuing caring.
Information about levels of physical inactivity in
Germany stems from the German Socio-Economic Panel
(GSOEP), a panel survey with annual measurements
from 1984 to 2013 [25]. This survey has been used in
previous studies to study outcomes and determinants of
physical activity in Germany [26, 27]. Respondents were
asked to self-report how often they engage in physical
activity. Self-reported measures are usually applied in
studies estimating costs of inactivity which rely on offi-
cial survey datasets since large and representative sample
sizes
are
required
[17–19].
Previous
research
has
produced mixed results on the validity of self-reported
physical activity measures compared to objective ones.
Whereas, for example, some studies found no significant
differences between self-reported and objective measures
[28], others provided evidence of an imprecise estima-
tion due to the problem of social desirability and social
approval [29, 30]. For this study, it is important to note
that those potential response biases would lead to rather
conservative estimates as physical inactivity levels are
likely underestimated.
Depending on the respective wave, respondents could
answer on a four- or five-point scale. Lechner [27] stated
that both scales can be considered sufficiently similar in
terms of the respective descriptive statistics. To obtain
the annual rate of inactivity, the variable was then
Dallmeyer et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:18 
Page 2 of 9
 dichotomized with using 1 when the respondent was
never active (this category was identical in all waves)
and 0 for the other categories. Since the activity question
was not included in every wave, the analysis was con-
ducted for the years 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011,
and 2013. The final sample included n = 166,309 obser-
vations from n = 41,991 individuals. More than half of
the respondents were female (52.4%). The average age
was 49.0 years with a range of 16–103 years. Certain
population subgroups (migrants, Eastern Germans) are
intentionally
overrepresented in the
survey.
Conse-
quently, specific sample weights provided in the dataset
were used to ensure its representativeness of the overall
German population [31].
The second and third purpose require predictions about
future demographic changes of the German population.
The Federal Statistical Office [23] has published informa-
tion and projections about past and future population
changes in gender-specific age-groups for the years 2014–
2060. These predictions are based on a constant fertility
rate of 1.4, life expectancy of 86.7 for men and 90.4 for
women, and annual net migration of 200,000.
Procedure
This section presents the analysis strategy in the order
of purposes. For the first purpose, the prevalence based
comparative risk assessment method developed by the
World Health Organization (WHO) [32] was applied
which is the common method to estimate economics
costs of inactivity [22]. This method consists of the
following five steps [19]:
(1)Identification of diseases related to physical
inactivity including their relative risks
(2)Identification of the annual direct costs of each
disease
(3)Determination of the prevalence of physical
inactivity in Germany (2001–2013)
(4)Calculation of the population attributable fractions
(PAF) for each disease
(5)Multiplying the PAFs with the annual direct costs of
each disease to determine annual direct cost of
physical inactivity.
Regarding the first step, the WHO [32] stated that
ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, colon and
female breast cancer, and Type 2 diabetes were the most
relevant diseases in relation to physical inactivity. In a
meta-analysis, the WHO [32] determined adjusted and
unadjusted relative risks (RR) for every listed disease
(Table 1) which describe the ratio of the incidence rate
among individuals of different age-groups and gender
with a given risk factor (physical inactivity) compared to
the incidence rate among individuals without it. For
other socio-demographic characteristics differentiated
RR are not available. This study uses the adjusted RR mea-
sures as they control for the effects of confounding
factors, such as age, sex, and smoking. Since the variation
between age-groups is essential to the present study, more
recent RR estimates of, for example, Janssen [33] could
not be used. However, the estimated confidence inter-
vals of the RR by the WHO [32] are considered in the
sensitivity analyses explained later and, hence, take into
account differences to more recent RR estimates.
Table 2 presents the average direct per capita costs of
the five diseases mainly associated with physical activity
(in 2008€) required for the second step [24]. The highest
direct per capita costs can be observed for ischemic
heart disease followed by Type 2 diabetes. Overall, the
direct costs associated with the five diseases represent
7.9% of total direct health care costs of Germany in
2008. Ischemic heart diseases, which have the highest
relative risk for physical inactivity, are alone responsible
for 2.6% of the overall direct health care costs. For all
five diseases the economic burden is highest for the old-
est age-group 65+ years.
For the third step, inactivity rates of the German
population were estimated (Table 3) using the data
provided by the GSOEP [25]. The results revealed a

 notable decline in physical inactivity over the examined
time-period (2001–2013). In 2001, 47.5% of males and
54.1% of females aged between 15 and 103 were physic-
ally inactive with the prevalence of inactivity generally
increasing with age. Only 28.0% of people in the age-
group 15–29 years were inactive compared to 79.2% in
the
age-group
65+ years. In 2013, inactivity
rates
decreased to 32.7% among males and 32.6% among
females, respectively. The prevalence of inactive people
regressed in particular in the oldest age-group where
only 47.0% were inactive in 2013.
In a fourth step, by using the rates of inactivity and
the RR of each disease, PAFs for each disease were cal-
culated. A PAF identifies the proportion of a disease
which can be associated with a certain risk factor
(here: physical inactivity). It is estimated with the fol-
lowing equation:
PAF ¼ P RR–1
ð
Þ
½
�= 1 þ P RR–1
ð
Þ
½
�
ð1Þ
where P denotes the prevalence of physical inactivity
and RR the relative risk for a disease if someone is
inactive (Table 1). The inactivity rates were estimated for
gender-specific age-groups for the years 2001–2013. In a
final step, the resulting PAFs were multiplied by the
annual total direct costs for each disease to estimate
annual direct costs of inactivity differentiated by gender
and age-groups.
Considering the second purpose, the direct per capita
inactivity costs of each disease for every gender-specific
age-group from the year 2013 were multiplied by
projected age- and gender-specific population numbers
for the years 2014–2060. The annual total direct costs
per disease were then aggregated to estimate total direct
costs of physical inactivity for every year. This method
has been previously applied to forecast the impact of
aging on health costs [6, 34].
The third research purpose builds on the projections of
the second purpose, but considers two fictive scenarios
predicting how future short-term actions to promote
physical activity could impact projected direct costs of
inactivity. The first scenario assumes that the inactivity
rates in all age-groups could be reduced by five percentage
points until 2020. The authors decided to use five percent-
age points because this value reflects the observed nega-
tive compound annual growth rate of physical inactivity of
3.6% for the period 2001–2013. Moreover, this figure has
already been used in previous studies to estimate the im-
pact of fictive physical activity reduction targets [35, 36].
The second scenario assumes that only the inactivity rate
in the age-group 65+ years can be reduced by five percent-
age points until 2020, which is reasonable, since the level
of inactivity in all other groups already finds itself on a
relatively low level compared to other countries [10]. Also,
the German government prioritized healthy aging includ-
ing promotion of physical activity for the elderly as one of
seven national health goals [37]. For both scenarios, new
PAFs were calculated and direct per capita costs of
inactivity for the year 2020 were estimated. Afterwards,
the projection procedure described in the second purpose
is repeated for the period 2020–2060.
Sensitivity analysis
Since all three purposes are based on calculations using
numerous input factors, this study conducted sensitivity
analyses considering variations among those determining
factors. Therefore, in line with Ding et al. [38], an
extreme scenario approach was used. When conducting
an extreme scenario sensitivity analysis, every factor is
set at its minimum and maximum value to generate a
lower and upper bound of the analyses. The relevant
input factors for the first research purpose were costs of
the
different
diseases
and
relative
risks.
Regarding
disease-specific costs, we followed Katzmarzyk et al. [39]
and varied each disease-specific health care cost by
±20%. For the relative risks, the confidence interval
estimated by the WHO [32] was used. For the second
research purpose, in addition to health costs and relative
risks, the lower and upper bound of the projected devel-
opment of the German population was used as reported
by the German Federal Statistical Office [40]. The lower
bound includes a fertility rate of 1.4, an average life
expectancy of 84.8 for men and 88.8 for women, and a
net migration of 100,000. The upper bound is based on
a fertility rate of 1.6, an average life expectancy of 86.7
for men and 90.4 for women, and a net migration of
200,000. The estimated scenarios of the third research
purpose relied on the same variations in costs, relative
risks, and population projections.
Results
The results related to the first purpose of providing
evidence from the past are visualized in Fig. 1. They
reveal that the overall direct costs of inactivity amounted
to €2.80 billion and €40.13 per capita in 2001, respectively,
which represents 1.3% of the total direct health care costs
of people older than 15 years. The sensitivity analyses

 revealed a lower bound of inactivity costs in 2001 of €1.70
billion and an upper bound of €4.16 billion.
During the 13-year observation period, the costs of
inactivity have declined almost constantly. In 2013, the
overall direct cost were reduced by 24.7% to €2.11
billion and €30.10 per capita, respectively, which repre-
sents a negative compound annual growth rate of 2.3%.
Consequently, the proportion of total direct health care
costs was reduced to 0.9%. For 2013, the best-case
scenario indicated costs of €1.26 billion and the worst-
case scenario costs of €3.19 billion.
Figure 1 also shows how the direct costs would have
developed if the rate of inactivity remained constant
since 2001. In this case, the inactivity costs would have
increased by 21.0% to €3.39 billion, which represents a
compound annual growth rate of 1.6% and is 60.7%
higher than the actual costs of inactivity in 2013.
For the second purpose of projecting the effects of
aging on the costs of inactivity for the years 2014–2060,
the predictions of the population development provided
by the Federal Statistical Office [23] indicate that the
average age of the German population will increase from
44.2 years in 2013 to 49.7 in 2060 [23]. This develop-
ment will mainly be driven by an increase in people who
are 65+ years old. In 2013, 21.7% of all people older than
15 years were aged over 65 years. In 2060, this share is
expected to increase to 30.2%.
Figure 2 presents the direct costs of inactivity associ-
ated with the predicted aging of the German population.
First, the overall annual direct costs of inactivity will rise
by 22.9% from €2.11 billion in 2013 to 2.60 billion in
2039 (in 2008 €). Afterwards, a plateau will be reached
and annual direct costs will remain constant, amounting
to €2.59 billion in 2060. However, direct per capita costs
are predicted to grow continuously. They increase to
their maximum value of €39.03 in 2060 which represents
an overall increase of 30.7% from 2013 with a compound
annual growth rate of 0.6%. The extreme scenario sensi-
tivity analysis shows that the plateau of total cost of
inactivity in 2039 can be between €1.49 billion (lower
bound) and €3.93 billion (upper bound). The increase in
per capita costs until 2060 can vary between €23.21
(lower bound) and €57.89 (upper bound).
Figure 3 provides a more detailed analysis of per capita
costs of inactivity by age-group. It indicates that for the
age-groups 15–29 years and 30–44 years the per capita
costs remain almost constant over the examined period,
while the per capita costs for the age-group 45–64 even
slightly decrease from €8.81 in 2013 to €6.79 in 2060.
The only increase can be observed for the oldest age-
group of 65+ years. Within this age-group, per capita
costs increase from €20.54 in 2013 to €31.83 in 2060
which represents an overall increase of 54.9% and a
compound annual growth rate of 0.9%.
The results of the third purpose analyzing two scenarios
with fictive short-term targets of reducing physical
inactivity are displayed in Table 4. Recall that the first
scenario comprised a reduction of physical inactivity
among all age-groups by five percentage points until

 2020. Applying this scenario, the resulting accumu-
lated

costs
of
inactivity
would
amount
to
€104.5 billion at the end of 2060. This would repre-
sent
an
11.2%
decrease
of
the
original
predicted
values for 2060 based on the inactivity level of 2013.
Overall this could lead to savings of €11.70 billion
until 2060 representing annual cost savings of €292.48
million. The second scenario assumed that only the
inactivity level in the oldest age-group (65+ years),
the most inactive one, will drop by five percentage
points. The results for this scenario show that 73.6%
of the cost savings of the first scenario could be
achieved
which
amounts
to
total
savings
of
8.60
billion and annual cost savings of €215.17 million
from 2020 to 2060.
Discussion
This study investigated the influence of physical inactiv-
ity – a major risk factor for numerous diseases – on the
development of health care costs in Germany in the light
of an aging population. It had three different research
purposes focusing on (1) evidence from the past, (2) the
prediction of future costs of inactivity, and (3) the effect
of future physical activity promotion. Regarding evidence
from the past, 1.3% of total direct health costs could be
attributed to physical inactivity in 2001. This finding is in
line with previous research from several countries, including
the UK, Canada, and the United States [17, 39, 41] where
estimated costs of inactivity ranged between 1% and 2.6%
on average [22]. A comparison with studies estimating the
economic burden of obesity and smoking on the German
health care system to be at 2.1% [42] and 3.3% [43], respect-
ively, indicates that physical inactivity can be considered a
notable public health burden for Germany.
The costs of inactivity have significantly declined over
the 13-year timespan. This development was driven by
an overall decrease in inactivity rates in Germany. At
least two explanations can be advanced for this finding.
First, the results may indicate a rising awareness of the
German
population
for
the
individual
benefits
of
physical activity [44], potentially leading to higher activity
rates. Second, during the same period, the German
government
launched
several
initiatives
to
promote
physical activity, especially among the elderly [45, 46],
which may have contributed to increasing activity rates as
well. Over this time-span, the average age has increased
from 41.3 years in 2001 to 44.2 years in 2013 [40]. More-
over, the proportion of people aged over 65 years
increased from 20.2% to 24.0% of all people older than
15 years. Consequently, if the inactivity rate had remained
at the level of 2001 for this period, the PAFs would
have been held constant, meaning that a resulting
21.0% increase in costs could have been exclusively
attributed to the aging of the German population
during this period. Hence, the negative effect of aging
on costs of inactivity was compensated by an increase
in physical activity patterns among the German popu-
lation during the period 2001–2013.
Turning to the second purpose, the projected progres-
sion of future total costs of inactivity for the period
2014–2060 shows a plateau to be reached in 2039. One
explanation for the following almost constant annual
direct costs might be that at the end of the 2030s most
of the German baby boomers [47] – born between 1955
and 1969 – will have passed away and, hence, the overall
population will shrink which compensates the increases
in direct health costs related to aging. However, the
continuous increase in direct per capita costs during this
period indicates that the economic burden for the
German population will not decline. The analysis by
age-groups revealed that the increase in direct costs of
inactivity can almost solely be attributed to the age-
group 65+ years. As a consequence, although the effect
of aging on direct costs of inactivity was compensated
by a considerable decrease in inactivity rates in Germany
for the period 2001–2013, over the next decades aging
will eat up 92.2% of the gains accomplished during the
period. Since the possibility of a decline in physical
activity has to be taken into account, the economic burden
could even increase if past patterns of physical inactivity
reoccur. Hence, the ongoing aging of the German popula-
tion demands further policy initiatives.
The third purpose of this study was to estimate the
effect of those potential initiatives to reduce physical
inactivity on direct costs of inactivity. The results stress
the economic importance of promoting physical activity

 in particular among the elderly as a decrease in physical
inactivity by 5 percentage points only in the oldest age-
group of 65+ years can generate 73.6% of the costs
savings if physical inactivity is reduced by 5 percentage
points among all age-groups.
Concerning policy development, it is important to con-
sider that policies aimed at reducing physical inactivity
bear different effects for socio-demographic groups. For
example, Humphreys and Ruseski [48] revealed that
spending on parks and recreation only has a significant
effect on outdoor physical activities preferred by younger
people with higher education and higher income. Wicker
et al. [15] showed that the effect of different types of sport
infrastructure varies between age-specific target groups
and Downward and Rasciute [49] documented that
satisfaction with sport facility provision had a significant
positive effect on health related activity levels of females,
but not of males. Consequently, governments have to be
aware of those differences if they want to target specific
socio-demographic groups, such as the elderly.
Conclusion
The results of this study add to the existing literature in
at least three ways. First, it is one of the first to analyze
direct costs of inactivity over a longer period of time
using panel data, enabling insights how costs are influ-
enced by changing physical activity patterns of a popula-
tion
and
demographic
changes
(e.g.
aging
society,
shrinking population). Previous research has only used
cross-sectional data and estimated the economic costs of
inactivity for one year [17, 39, 41]. Second, it provides a
more detailed analysis by differentiating between four
age-group and both sexes. Such a detailed analysis takes
into account that the most important parameters for
estimating costs of inactivity, i.e., inactivity rates and
relative risks, vary by age and gender. Third, it contributes
to the body of research by providing insights about the
role of physical inactivity in the context of aging and
development of health care costs; previous research
has only looked at other risk factors, such as smoking
and obesity [7, 50].
The findings come with implications for policy makers
and public health organizations. Overall the results indi-
cate that the promotion of physical activity can be used
as an important non-pharmaceutical action to reduce
public health care costs considerably. Moreover, espe-
cially increasing physical activity rates among the elderly
can assist governments in compensating the increasing
demand for health care resulting from an aging popula-
tion. In addition, the findings outline the urgency of
short-term actions because a – well feasible – reduction
of physical inactivity within the next five years could
lead to long-term economic benefits for the national
health care system. Since approximately 75% of cost
savings can be attributed to the oldest age-group of
65 + years, initiatives and campaigns promoting physical
activity should particularly target this age-group. Consid-
ering that costs occur for both designing and launching
such campaigns and initiatives and their efficiency can
differ significantly between age-groups [51], promotion
campaigns for older age-groups ought to be prioritized.
Such policy priorities are to be deemed especially
important because public authorities are faced with
budget constraints.
This study has some limitations which could guide
future research. First, it is necessary to note that the
population projections made by the Federal Statistical
Office [23] only consider the aspect of aging, while
possible changes in technology or behavior, and health
policy reforms have not been taken into account.
Furthermore, existing research suggests that not only
age effects are important when investigating physical
activity patterns over time, but also period and cohort
effects [52], which represent an avenue for future
research. Finally, since this study only uses a measure of
the frequency of physical activity, future research would
benefit from more detailed measures also considering
activity duration and intensity that allow calculating
metabolic equivalents (METs).
