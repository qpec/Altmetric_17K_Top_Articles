Abstract
Background: In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) increasingly represent the majority of people living
with and acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Local and federal surveillance programs estimate the number
of persons living with an HIV diagnosis, persons living with HIV infection, and new diagnoses. Given the absence of
population-based estimates of the number of MSM for US states, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), or counties, it is not
possible to accurately estimate rates using these indicators at these levels, inhibiting the ability to understand HIV burden and to
direct prevention efforts.
Objective: To synthesize recently published estimates of MSM population size with publicly available HIV surveillance data,
in order to estimate the prevalence of HIV diagnosis and infection and the rate of new diagnoses, at the national, state, MSA, and
county levels.
Methods: The number of MSM living with HIV infection in 2012 (prevalence), living with an HIV diagnosis in 2012 (diagnosed
prevalence), and newly diagnosed with HIV infection in 2013 (new diagnosis), at state, MSA, and county levels, were obtained
from publicly available data from AIDSVu.org and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The estimated number
of MSM living in every US county was calculated using recently published methodology that utilized data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and American Community Survey. Estimated county-level MSM counts were aggregated
to form MSA- and state-level totals. From this, we estimated HIV prevalence, diagnosed prevalence, and new diagnosis rates.
Results: The estimated HIV prevalence among MSM in the United States in 2012 was 15.0% (666,900/4,452,772), the diagnosed
HIV prevalence in 2012 was 11.1% (493,453/4,452,772), and the new diagnosis rate for 2013 was 0.7 per 100 MSM. For diagnosed
prevalence at the state level, 6 states had both <15,000 cases and diagnosed prevalence rates of ≥15%, all in the South. Five highly
populated states had ≥15,000 cases and rates between 10% and 15%. Georgia was the only state with ≥15,000 cases and ≥15%
diagnosed prevalence rate. Of the 25 MSAs with the highest diagnosed prevalence rates in the United States, 21 were in the South

 and 6 had diagnosed prevalence of ≥25%. County-level data showed high diagnosed prevalence rates in both urban and rural
counties of the South.
Conclusions: HIV infection is hyperendemic among MSM in many areas of the United States, particularly in the South. Our
data emphasize the priorities for HIV prevention and care set forth in the United States National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS)
and provide updatable local estimates of NHAS indicators. Jurisdictions can use these results to direct resources, programs, and
policies to optimally benefit the health of MSM.

Introduction
The United States’ human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
epidemic has long been characterized by a concentration of
infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM
accounted for an estimated 53% of people living with a diagnosis
of HIV in 2013 and 67% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014, despite
representing a minority of men in the United States [1, 2].
Furthermore, individuals of color and those living in the
Southern United States also comprise a disproportionate share
of new infections, new diagnoses, those living with an HIV
diagnosis, and deaths among persons living with an HIV
diagnosis [1, 3, 4]. The intersection of these groups, black MSM
in the South, represents the most affected subgroup in the United
States, for whom extremely high levels of HIV prevalence and
incidence have been recorded across a variety of surveillance
and research designs [5-9]. The 2015 update to the United States
National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) places priority on MSM,
particularly black MSM, and individuals living in the South,
and establishes indicators to monitor progress in reducing the
extent of HIV disparities in these populations, to monitor the
state of the US epidemic, and to guide the allocation of
prevention efforts [10]. The implementation of the NHAS will
require intensive local action, informed by local estimates of
the extent of HIV infection [11].
To best understand the burden of existing and new HIV
infections among MSM at subnational levels, high-quality data
sources for both infection numerators and population-size
denominators are needed, yet historically have been incomplete.
In the United States, HIV infection is reportable; since 2004,
name-based diagnoses of HIV infection have been reported by
all 50 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). CDC routinely releases HIV surveillance data in reports
and on HIV Atlas [1, 5, 12]. These data include estimated state-,
county-, and metropolitan statistical area (MSA)-level counts
of MSM newly diagnosed with HIV infection in each year and
all MSM currently living with diagnosed HIV infection.
AIDSVu.org is a website that uses these data to develop highly
detailed maps and other visualizations of the HIV epidemic and
allows downloads of county-specific CDC data on HIV
prevalence [13]. There is no direct surveillance measurement
of the total number of MSM living with HIV infection (ie,
including those not yet diagnosed), but CDC has used existing
surveillance data to model the number of MSM living with HIV
infection at the state level [14].
Unlike for other groupings of persons (eg, by race, sex, or age)
for which CDC publishes both counts and rates of HIV
diagnoses and prevalence, surveillance-based estimates for
MSM are available only as counts. This limits our understanding
of not only the total burden of HIV infection among MSM but
also the relative burden across geographic areas in which
numbers of MSM may vary. CDC led an effort to create a
national estimated rate of the MSM living with diagnosed HIV
infection using surveillance data from 37 states and an MSM
population-size denominator based on a synthesis of data
sources, primarily the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) [2]. CDC also funds an
ongoing supplemental surveillance project in 20 of the largest
US cities that directly measures the rate of prevalent HIV
infection in a nonrepresentative sample of MSM [6-8, 15, 16].
These data are valuable for understanding the impact of HIV
infection among MSM in those cities, but other areas need
similar estimates to better understand their own community’s
HIV epidemic and to target resources appropriately. This is
particularly critical as part of the nationwide call for
organizations to incorporate the goals and indicators from the
NHAS into their program plans [10, 11]. The rate of new HIV
diagnoses is a central indicator for success in the NHAS goals
of reducing new HIV infections (Goal 1, Indicator 2) and
reducing HIV-related health disparities for MSM (Goal 4,
Indicator 9) [10].
To generate these rates at the state, county, and MSA levels,
we needed new data on the number of MSM in each of those
areas. We have recently published a method that allocates the
national proportion of MSM to all US states, counties, and
MSAs, using additional NHANES results and American
Community Survey (ACS) data [17, 18]. Here, we apply these
new denominators to the publicly available HIV case
surveillance data to obtain rates of HIV diagnoses and
prevalence among MSM at national, state, county, and MSA
levels.
Methods
We estimated and examined a variety of HIV infection indicators
for MSM at multiple levels by combining publicly available
disease numerator data with denominators for MSM, as follows.
Numerator Data Sources and Methods
Estimated MSM diagnosis and infection count data were
extracted from public CDC and AIDSVu.org data sources to
inform estimates at the national level and all 50 US states plus

 the District of Columbia (Table 1) [1, 12, 13]. County-level data
on prevalence of persons living with diagnosed HIV infection
(diagnosed prevalence) among MSM came from AIDSVu.org
[13]. MSA-level data on diagnosed HIV prevalence and new
HIV diagnoses among MSM came from a CDC surveillance
report [5].
To protect the privacy of persons living with HIV infection in
smaller communities, standard publication practices for HIV
surveillance data suppress county data where there are fewer
than 5 cases; this includes stratified counts, such as for MSM.
In addition, CDC adheres to agreements with each individual
state regarding additional restrictions on the public release of
HIV surveillance data at the county level. Although for the
2012-2013 HIV case surveillance data most states (n=32)
allowed CDC to release data about MSM from all counties that
met the 5+ case rule, many either only allowed release of these
data from large mostly urban counties (n=10) or did not allow
the data to be released at all (n=8).

Denominator Data Sources and Methods
We used the method by Grey et al [17] to estimate the number
of MSM in the United States in 2012 and 2013. In brief, we
began with 2 published estimates. The first was the result of a
meta-analysis-based estimate of the percentage of US men who
have had sex with another man in the past 5 years [2]. The
second, from an analysis of NHANES data, was the percentages
of US men who had sex with another man in the past year, at
each of 4 levels of urbanicity: large central metropolitan areas,
large fringe metropolitan areas, medium or small metropolitan
areas, and nonmetropolitan areas [18]. We next evaluated the
percentage of same-sex male couple households among all
households in each county, from the ACS [19]. We then
calculated the ratio of these percentages to the percentage among
all counties at the same level of urbanicity. By multiplying these
ratios by the percentages reported by Oster et al [18], we
assigned each county a new, locally tailored estimated
percentage of men who had sex with a man in the past year
among adult men, a method similar to that published by Lieb
et al [20]. Finally, we multiplied each county’s estimate by the
number of adult men in the county, according to the ACS. In
order to estimate the number of men who had sex with a man
in the past 5 years, generally considered more indicative of the
sexually active MSM population, we scaled the single-year
population sizes to equal the estimate given by Purcell et al [2]
of 3.9% of the US adult male population. To obtain estimates
at the state and MSA levels, we aggregated MSM population
size estimates from their composite counties.
In addition to the numerator-based suppression previously
mentioned, standard publication practices for HIV surveillance
data also suppress the display of county-level rates where there
are fewer than 100 persons in the population, including in any
single group stratum, such as MSM. Ultimately, of the 1521
counties with available and unsuppressed data on MSM living
with an HIV diagnosis, an additional 253 (16%) had fewer than
100 MSM according to our estimation method. The remaining
1268 counties, which contained 84% of the US adult male
population and 89% of all MSM living with an HIV diagnosis
in 2012, contributed to the county-level analysis.
HIV Burden Indicators
At the state level, we computed the rates of HIV prevalence in
2012 (diagnosed and undiagnosed), diagnosed prevalence in
2012, and new diagnoses in 2013. Prevalence rates were among
all MSM; new diagnosis rates were among all MSM and among
only MSM not previously diagnosed with HIV (total MSM in
2013 minus total MSM living with a diagnosis at year-end of
2012). State-level estimates were aggregated to yield national
estimates. At the county level, we computed the rates of
diagnosed HIV prevalence among all MSM in 2012. At the
MSA level, we computed the rates of diagnosed HIV prevalence
in 2012 and new diagnosis in 2013 among all MSM.
Sensitivity Analyses
To explore the potential effect of regional underreporting or
within-urbanicity stratum underrepresentation of male-male
cohabitation on the ACS-based Grey estimator, we also
produced HIV prevalence and new diagnosis rates using MSM
denominators according to more simplified models that assumed
estimates from Oster et al and Purcell et al (see Supplement for
details) [2].

 Results
In the United States in 2012, an estimated 15.0% of MSM were
living with HIV infection (diagnosed and undiagnosed) and
11.1% were living with an HIV diagnosis (Tables 2-3, Figure
1). Using the comparison method in Purcell et al [2], the
diagnosed HIV prevalence rate among MSM was 57.5 times
greater than among other US men. States in the South had the
highest rates of diagnosed HIV prevalence among MSM, with
all rates of ≥15% located in the South (Table 2, Figure 1).
Among states, the rates of diagnosed HIV prevalence among
MSM living in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina were
all approximately twice the national rate. The rates of new HIV
diagnoses among MSM for 2013 at the state level strongly
followed the same pattern as HIV prevalence (Table 2, Figure
2). Only southern states had new diagnosis rates per MSM and
per MSM without an HIV diagnosis of ≥1.00/100 MSM, with
2 (Louisiana and Mississippi) having rates per MSM without
an HIV diagnosis of ≥2.00/100 MSM.
Plotting the diagnosed HIV prevalence case counts versus rates
among MSM in 2012 (Figure 3), 4 groups are notable: populous
states with ≥15,000 cases and diagnosed prevalence between
10% and 15% (California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Texas),
southern states with diagnosed prevalence of ≥15% and <15,000
cases, and states with diagnosed prevalence of <15% and
<15,000 cases. Georgia is uniquely high in both the rate and
case count of MSM living with diagnosed HIV infection.
All but 4 high-prevalence MSAs are located in the South, and
6 southern MSAs have diagnosed HIV prevalence rates among
MSM for 2013 of ≥25% (Table 4, complete MSA data provided
in supplement). The map of county-level diagnosed HIV
prevalence rates among MSM in 2012 shows a similar pattern
of high-prevalence urban areas (Figure 4). This map also shows
that several rural counties in the South have diagnosed HIV
prevalence rates of ≥20% and ≥30% (Figure 4).
The new MSM population size estimation by Grey et al also
appears to produce similar state-level HIV rates to previous
approaches and, in the instances of certain MSAs, more plausible
results (see Supplement for full sensitivity analysis results).

 Discussion
Despite incredible achievements in prevention, HIV diagnosis,
and antiretroviral therapies over the 35 years of the epidemic,
the impact of HIV in US communities of MSM remains
staggering. We examined prevalence of HIV at the state and
county levels, and found that, although there are important local
variations in HIV prevalence, the prevalence of HIV among
MSM is consistently orders of magnitude higher than among
other Americans. Whereas prevalence of HIV is routinely
expressed in cases per 100,000 persons for other groups, for
MSM, we report cases per 100 persons [5]. The levels of
prevalence among MSM correspond to international benchmarks
for epidemicity or hyperendemicity, with all 50 states at least
tripling the prevalence criterion for generalized epidemics among
MSM (>1% prevalence) and 6 states (all in the South) meeting
the UNAIDS criterion for hyperendemicity (>15% prevalence)
[21]. The county-level findings demonstrate that although most
HIV infections among MSM are concentrated among
urban-dwelling MSM, rural areas still represent important places
of HIV burden that may be underserved by HIV prevention and
care services [5, 22]. Furthermore, rates of new diagnoses among
MSM provide insight into the ongoing trajectory of the
epidemic, providing a national, regional, and local view of an
epidemic force of infection that requires urgent response and
prioritization [23].
Our analysis builds on previous reports of the importance of
local variations in social and structural epidemic determinants
[24], and underscores previous identification of the US South
as the area of greatest concentration of HIV infection [10]. In
terms of state-specific HIV prevalence rates among MSM, 9 of
the top 10 are in the South. We also have new evidence that the
HIV epidemic in the South is continuing to grow
disproportionately to other regions. New HIV diagnoses rates
among MSM for 2013 show that the top 13 states were all in
the South, with 10 states having new diagnoses rates of >1%
per year. These concentrations of new diagnoses in the South
might represent relative increases in new transmissions or could
represent previous successes in reducing HIV transmissions
among MSM outside the South [25-27]. Our analysis furthers
previous surveillance reports and analyses by recognizing that
there are differences in the distribution of MSM by state and
by county; having high-quality estimates of MSM denominators
allows for more reliable comparisons in prevalence and
diagnosis rates across geographic areas. Denominators also
allow for a more direct quantification of the health disparity
among MSM than do rates expressed against a denominator of
all men.
Our estimates of HIV prevalence differ importantly from
previous estimates of HIV prevalence in the United States. The
study by Purcell et al, based on data from 37 states, reported a
diagnosed HIV prevalence among MSM in 2007 of about 8%
[2, 28]. Our estimate for 2012, including data from all states
and the District of Columbia, is that diagnosed HIV prevalence
was 11% and that, including estimated undiagnosed infections,
15% of US MSM live with HIV infection. Previous data from
the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) have
shown higher HIV prevalence (18% in 2011) among MSM
recruited in high-risk venues in the 20 largest cities in the United
States [29, 30]; these differences likely reflect selection bias for
men in high-risk venues, and the higher risk of HIV infection
in urban areas. Our findings have relative advantages over
NHBS-derived estimates because of population-based sources
of numerator and denominator data and inclusion of areas
outside the largest US cities, including rural areas.
Evaluating and monitoring data in smaller geographic areas is
critical to making effective local responses and to measuring
their impact. Indeed, the first step of the first goal of the NHAS
is to assess the communities in which HIV is more
concentrated[11]. Our data are also of relevance to the updated
National Strategy [31]. In terms of Goal 3, reducing HIV-related
disparities, our new data illustrate the extent of the health
disparity among MSM—a staggering 57-fold disparity in
diagnosed HIV prevalence rates among MSM compared with
other US men. Because our method of calculating rates of new
HIV diagnoses among MSM can be updated annually, it can
also serve as a source of data to evaluate Indicator 9, measures
of health disparities among MSM. The updated NHAS uses a
denominator of all men to calculate the rate of new HIV
diagnoses among MSM nationally, which was the best available
data at the time. However, at the local level, similar metrics will
have varying amounts of bias, depending on the relative
concentration of MSM in a particular jurisdiction. Thus, for
local planning and evaluation, rates based on local MSM
denominators should be used. To most comprehensively address
this purpose, it will require developing similar race-specific
estimates of MSM at the state and county levels. Such data are
not yet available but would be important for the ongoing
evaluation of an epidemic with profound disparities by race and
ethnicity.
Limitations
These results have important limitations. Because all residential
locations informing HIV case numerators were determined at
the time of diagnosis, and the denominators were based on recent
ACS data, postdiagnosis migration and undercounting of
nonresidents may contribute to mismeasurement. Furthermore,
there are differences in the time frames for assessment of
male-male sex for numerators and denominators. HIV
surveillance classifies males as MSM if the individual reports
any sex with a man since 1977, whereas MSM denominators
were defined as having male-male sex in the previous 5 years
[1, 17]. This shorter time frame is more informative for assessing
public-health-actionable HIV burden, compared with a lifetime
definition of male-male sex. However, to the extent that some
men living with HIV were classified as MSM at the time of
diagnoses but may not have engaged in sexual activity in the
previous 5 years, some inflation of prevalence may be observed.
There is also a potential age mismatch between the HIV case
surveillance-based numerator data and the MSM population
size denominators. Publicly available HIV surveillance data
reports MSM cases for all persons 13 years of age and older,
whereas MSM population size methodologies are for MSM 18
years of age and older. This potentially inflates MSM
prevalence. However, persons aged 13-19 years compose only
0.96% of all US HIV diagnoses and diagnosed HIV prevalence

 is low among MSM aged 13-17 years, so the extent of this bias
is likely minimal [1, 32].
Conclusions
Surveillance data have been described as the conscience of the
HIV epidemic [33], and the new insights provided here on the
rates of HIV prevalence and new diagnoses for US MSM
constitute a call of conscience for heightened responses and
improved monitoring of HIV epidemics among MSM, especially
in the South. Across the United States, MSM are affected by
HIV at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than for other
Americans. This health disparity is even more pronounced in
the South. There is a need for increased resources for HIV
prevention, treatment, and care for MSM. In the South, this
must include expansion of access to health care through
Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act; increased
access to comprehensive HIV prevention services, including
for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP); and increased resources
for programs to support immediate referrals for antiretroviral
therapy for those who are newly diagnosed with HIV. Despite
the disproportionate impact of HIV in the South, PrEP uptake
among MSM is lower in the South than in other geographic
areas [34, 35]. In terms of monitoring, we believe that our
analysis illustrates the power of having denominators available
to characterize health outcomes of sexual minority groups, and
we join the Institute of Medicine’s call [36] to collect data on
sexual orientation and gender identity in federal data collections
and electronic health records, as well as to consider collecting
such data in the United States Census. The health disparities in
HIV for US MSM illustrated in this report are intolerable, and
we call for urgent action to meet the treatment and care needs
of those MSM living with HIV and to support all available
evidence-based approaches to prevent new infections.
