Life Expectancy in the United States

Objectives. To examine changes over 40 years (1970–2010) in life expectancy, life
expectancy with disability, and disability-free life expectancy for American men and
women of all ages.
Methods. We used mortality rates from US Vital Statistics and data on disability
prevalence in the community-dwelling population from the National Health Interview
Survey; for the institutional population, we computed disability prevalence from the US
Census. We used the Sullivan method to estimate disabled and disability-free life ex-
pectancy for 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010.
Results. Over the 40 years, there was a steady increase in both disability-free life
expectancy and disabled life expectancy. At birth, increases in disabled life and non-
disabled life were equal for men (4.5 years); for women, at birth the increase in life with
disability (3.6 years) exceeded the increase in life free of disability (2.7 years). At age 65
years, the increase in disability-free life was greater than the increase in disabled life.
Conclusions. Across the life cycle, there was no compression of morbidity, but at age 65
years some compression occurred. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:1287–1293. doi:

re we living longer healthy lives as well
as longer lives? Over the past 30 years,
researchers have addressed this question
using data for relatively short periods of time,
and the answer has not been a consistent
yes or no.1–4 The answer depended on the
years of observation as well as the measure
of health examined and the composition
of the population studied.
Interest in the length of high-quality life
as well as the quantity of life began as life
expectancy increased at older ages and
mortality decline was concentrated in chronic
diseases.5,6 The possibility was raised that
we could be increasing the length of poor-
quality life but not good-quality life. Op-
posing views on what would happen to
healthy life with improvements in life ex-
pectancy in a population with high levels
of chronic disease ranged from “compression
of morbidity,”7 which foresaw an exten-
sion of healthy life and an elimination of
unhealthy life, to “failure of success,”8,9
which focused on the fact that the sick
and frail could become more numerous. In
the middle was the view of Manton, who
predicted “dynamic equilibrium”5 or
balanced changes in healthy and unhealthy
life.
Using data for the United States for 1970
to 1990, researchers identified different trends
in disability-free life expectancy at birth.2
In the 1970s, almost all of the increases in life
expectancy were in disabled years; by con-
trast, the 1980s were a period when increases
in life expectancy were concentrated in
years without disability. Examining change in
time spent with severe disability among older
age groups, Cai and Lubitz found increases
in total life expectancy and decreases in dis-
abled years.1 By contrast, Crimmins et al.,
using a different data set representing people
older than 70 years and a somewhat different
definition of disability, found increases in
disability-free life equal to the increases in
total-life expectancy and no change in life
with disability between 1984 and 2000.3
Generalizing from a number of studies on
time trends beginning in the 1960s and going
through the early 1990s, Cambois and
Robine concluded that the trend in the
United States was toward increases in life free
of severe disability that were keeping pace
with increases in life expectancy, but also
increases in years of life with mild disability.10
The United States is not exceptional in
showing mixed results in terms of increasing
healthy life. Examination of changes in
disabled and disability-free life expectancy
in 14 European countries from the mid-1990s
to the early 2000s indicated that the coun-
tries fell into 3 groups: those with an in-
creasing proportion of healthy life, those with
stability in the proportion of life free of severe
disability, and those where the proportion
of life with severe disability increased.11
Cambois and Robine also found mixed trends
in European countries through the 1980s
and early 1990s—there were increases in
disabled life in some and decreases in others,
but in general they concluded that years
with severe disability were not increasing.10
Understanding trends in healthy and
disability-free life expectancy is important for
planning and policy. For instance, changes
in the age of full entitlement to social security
should be made with knowledge of trends
in disability-free life rather than total life
expectancy. In light of this, governments
and international agencies have begun to
set goals for extending disability-free life as
well as total life and for monitoring change
in disability-free life.12,13
To get a long-term perspective, we ex-
amined 40 years of change—covering 5
decennial censuses (1970–2010)—in life

 expectancy, disabled life expectancy, and
disability-free life expectancy for American
men and women. To our knowledge, this is
the longest series of disability-free life ex-
pectancy examined to date, beginning at
about the time of the initiation of the sub-
stantial decline in old-age mortality that in-
stigated interest in the question we address.
Our analysis accounted for disabled life spent
in institutions as well as in the community.
METHODS
Healthy life expectancy measures combine
indicators of morbidity and mortality so that
life expectancy can be divided into healthy
and unhealthy expected life. Healthy life
can be defined along any number of health
dimensions (e.g., disease, disability, func-
tioning) and can be computed with multiple
methodological approaches.14 Here, we
define “healthy life” as disability-free life
and “unhealthy life” as life with disability, and
we use the Sullivan method for computing
healthy and unhealthy life expectancy.15
Disability-free life expectancy reflects the
average number of remaining years at
a specified age a person can expect to live
without disability given current mortality
and disability conditions; disabled years are
the expected number of years to be lived with
disability after a given age. Because of the way
the data were collected, we distinguished
between disabled years in the community
and disabled years spent in institutions for
health reasons. As with total life expectancy,
disabled and disability-free life expectancy
were estimated so they would be free of
the influence of changing age structure and
could be compared across time.
To compute disability-free and disabled
life expectancy, we divided the years lived in
each age group into disabled and nondisabled,
using the prevalence of disability at each age.
We summed years lived disabled at all ages
after the specified age and divided them by
the number of people alive at that age to get
disabled life expectancy; we determined
disability-free life expectancy by subtracting
disabled life expectancy from total life ex-
pectancy.14,15 For the working ages (20–64
years), we computed partial life expectancy
values (i.e., years lived between 2 ages). We
computed standard errors and confidence
intervals for the estimated values using the
approach provided by Jagger et al.15
Estimating disability-free life expectancy
over time requires information on mortality
and disability for the entire population that is
comparable at each date. We computed our
life tables using data for 5-year age–gender
groups. Mortality data for this analysis were
from US National Vital Statistics. For 1970,
1980, 1990, and 2000, we used the decennial
life tables for the United States. Because the
decennial life table for 2010 is not yet available,
we used the annual life table for 2010.
To meet its charge of monitoring the
health and health care utilization of non-
institutionalized Americans, the US National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has
regularly collected information on disability
in the National Health Interview Survey
since 1957, using reasonably comparable
methods. This annual survey provides
individual-level data for 51 years of the survey
(1963–2013), which are available from the
Integrated Health Interview Series developed
by the University of Minnesota (https://
www.ihis.us/ihis). Although disability has
been measured throughout the period, the
questions used to elicit reports of disability
have changed somewhat over time (Appen-
dix A, available as a supplement to the online
version of this article at http://www.ajph.
org). The questions allowed us to
construct a series on disability in the
community-dwelling population in which
disability is defined as having any limitation
of activity (i.e., being limited in any way in
the performance of one’s usual or other
activities). This definition encompasses all
disability, both major and minor.
In earlier analyses, we adjusted the time
series on disability for changes that oc-
curred between 1981 and 1982 that affected
selected age groups2; for this study, we also
adjusted the annual data for changes between
1996 and 1997 so that the analysis would
be fully comparable to the earlier series at each
of the years. We used the final basic weight
provided by the NCHS. Our approach to the
adjustment was to estimate the trend within
periods when the questions were consistent
and then estimate the change between pe-
riods. Online Appendix A provides a detailed
description of the methods used to do this.
We then used 3 years of data for each date to
get an estimate of age–gender-specific levels
of disability in the community-dwelling
population at 10-year intervals from
1970 to 2010. We provide confidence
intervals for the prevalences based on the
3-year sample size and the complex sample
design.
Information on those in institutions be-
cause of disability was collected in the de-
cennial census. For the first 3 years (1970,
1980, and 1990), we used the age-specific
prevalence data indicating institutionalization
for health or functioning problems from
Crimmins et al.2 For 2000 and 2010, we used
census information on the population in
group quarters who are in nursing homes
or other institutions, including hospitals or
wards, hospices, and schools for the handi-
capped. We assumed that all people in-
stitutionalized in these types of facilities were
disabled. Appendix B (available as a supple-
ment to the online version of this article
at http://www.ajph.org) provides details
on procedures used to estimate age-specific
prevalence of institutional disability. Because
the data were from population censuses,
we did not construct confidence intervals.
RESULTS
First, we discuss trends in the inputs to
the life tables and then we discuss the trends
in the life expectancy values that result
from combining the inputs to create estimates
of health expectancy states.
Trends in Prevalence of Disability
The trend over the 40 years in the prev-
alence of disability in the community pop-
ulation differed by age (Table 1). For those
younger than 65 years, there was some in-
crease in disability over the whole period,
particularly at the younger ages. For those
older than 65 years, there was a decline in
disability after 1980. Over the entire period,
the change was generally similar for males
and females, with the exception of those aged
85 years and older, among whom only
women experienced improvement.
Over time, there was a marked drop in
the percentage of the population in institu-
tions for health reasons at all ages, although,
except for the oldest age groups, the per-
centage in institutions was very low in all years

 (Figure 1). For the oldest age group (‡ 85
years), which had the highest level of insti-
tutionalization, the maximum percentage
institutionalized was reached in 1990, after
which there were marked declines. Although
the change was similar by gender, among
older people, more women than men were
institutionalized at older ages.
Trends in Life Expectancy
In the United States, life expectancy at
birth increased in each of the decades from
1970 through 2010: by 9.2 years (from 67.0 to
76.2 years) for men and by 6.4 years (from
74.6 to 81.0 years) for women (Table 2). For
women, the increase was fairly rapid in the
first decade of the period and fairly slow more
recently; for men, the trend was more
consistent.
A greater increase in male life expectancy
over the period characterized each age up
to 85 years. Gains in life expectancy during
the working years were larger for men
(1.8 years) than for women (0.9 years); the
same was true at age 65 years: for men, the
increase in life expectancy was 4.7 years
(from 13.0 to 17.7 years), whereas for
women it was only 3.5 years (from 16.8
to 20.3 years). At age 85 years, life expec-
tancy over the 40-year period increased by
1.1 years for men and 1.3 years for women.
For both men and women, about half of
the increase in life expectancy at birth was
due to increasing life expectancy after age
65 years.
Trends in Disability-Free Life
Expectancy
Table 2 also shows the results of combining
age-specific mortality with disability in the
community and in institutions. There was
a steady increase in disability-free life ex-
pectancy at birth over the 30 years after
1980 for women and over the entire 40-year
period for men (Table 2). Over the 40-year
period, the gain at birth was 4.5 years for
men and 2.7 years for women. In the working
ages, disability-free life expectancy in-
creased for men (0.9 years) but decreased for
women (–0.6 years); at age 65 years, the
increase was greater for men (2.7 years)
than for women (2.4 years), and the in-
creases in each of the last 3 decades were
significant for both men and women.
When we compared increases in disability-
free life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years
across the life span, most of the increase

 Trends in Life Expectancy With
Disability
Life expectancy with disability in the
community and in institutions comprises total
disabled life. Over the 40 years, expected
years at birth of life expectancy with disability
in the community increased by 4.7 years
for men and 3.9 years for women. The in-
crease was significant for both men and
women during the 1970s and the 2000s and
was significant for men in the 1990s. Over
the 40 years, life with disability in the com-
munity was the category in which the increase
in life expectancy at birth was largest. In
the working years, for women, disabled life
expectancy in the community increased
(1.6 years) and nondisabled life expectancy
decreased (0.6 years); for men, the changes
in disabled and nondisabled life expectancy
in the community were closer to equal (1.1
and 0.9 years of increase, respectively).
Regarding institutional life, for men, change
in total disabled and nondisabled life in the
working years was equal; for women, the
increase in disabled years was greater.
Over the 40 years, at age 65 years, the
increase in disabled life expectancy in the
community was 2.2 years for men and 1.4
years for women. The increase was significant
in 3 of the decades for men and in 2 of them
for women. At age 85 years, years with
disability in the community increased simi-
larly and significantly for men and women
(0.8 for men vs 0.7 for women). Over the
40 years, average expected time spent in in-
stitutions was reduced by 0.2 and 0.3 years for
men and women, respectively. This change
occurred after the age of 85 years, when
institutionalization is most common. At age
85 years, change in life expectancy for men
was about equally distributed between dis-
abled life (0.6 years) and nondisabled life
(0.5 years); for women, the increase in
nondisabled life (0.8 years) was twice that
in disabled life (0.4 years).
Proportion of Life With and
Without Disability
Combining these changes in life expec-
tancy, we found reductions in the proportion
of expected life at birth free of disability
over the 40-year period (Table 3). For men,
life free of disability at birth declined by
4.1 percentage points; for women, the decline
was 3.3 percentage points. Data for the
working ages indicated some reduction in the
percentage of life free of disability for both
men (1.5 percentage points) and women
(3.2 percentage points). Both at birth and in
the working ages, the negative change oc-
curred in the first decade of the period.
After age 65 years, however, the pro-
portion of expected life free of disability in-
creased over the 40 years, by 1.3 percentage
points for men and 2.5 percentage points
for women; at age 85 years, the increase was
2.4 percentage points for men and 6.7 per-
centage points for women. This increase
resulted from a decrease in the proportion
of life spent disabled in institutions rather
than in the community; across the 40-year
period, the latter figure increased for men and
stayed fairly stable for women.
DISCUSSION
The period we examined was one of in-
creasing life expectancy, more consistently for
men than for women. Over the 40 years,
men’s gain in life expectancy exceeded that of
women by 44%. At birth, for men, the in-
crease in life expectancy was equally split
between disabled and nondisabled years;
for women, the increase in disabled life over
the whole period exceeded the increase in
nondisabled life by about 50%. During the
working years, the change in disabled and
disability-free years was equal for men but for
women the increases in disability-free life
were small relative to the increases in disabled
life. At age 65 years, the increase in non-
disabled life exceeded that in disabled life.
After age 85 years, because institutionalized
life was reduced, women’s increase in
disability-free life exceeded that in disabled
life; for men, however, the decrease in in-
stitutionalized life was not large enough to
outweigh the increase in disabled life in the
community, making the increase in disabled
and nondisabled life about equal.
If we define compression of morbidity as
an increase in the proportion of disability-free
life, there was no compression across the
total life span in the United States from 1970
through 2010 but rather some decrease in the

 proportion of life free of disability. Most
of this decrease occurred in the first decade
of the 40-year period; from 1980 through
2010, the proportion of life expectancy at
birth free of disability stayed virtually con-
stant. There was also no compression of
morbidity during the working years. In
general, the 1970s were a period of more
negative trends, with some expansion of
morbidity, and relative stability from the
1980s onward.
After 1980, there was some compression of
morbidity at the older ages (‡ 65 and ‡ 85
years), with an increase in the proportion
of life free of disability. This improvement
among the old, but not the young, reinforces
much of the existing work on trends in
disability.16,17 Our study clarifies that these
declines in disability at older ages combined
with declines in mortality in recent decades
to increase the length of life free of disabil-
ity and decrease the length of life with dis-
ability in this age range.
Different factors may be affecting disability
at different ages and among these different
cohorts. Some of the increase in disability
among the younger population likely resulted
from change in emphasis in mental health,
the rise in autism and attention deficit hy-
peractivity disorder, and the changing pat-
terns of drug use across time. Changes in drug
use, emotional well-being, and alcoholism in
the working ages may have resulted in in-
creased disability during those years. Changes
in both the young and the working-age
groups may also reflect change in ideas about
how to define disability. Decrease in insti-
tutionalization among the old may be related
to changes in costs, regulations, and norms for
nursing home use rather than changes in
innate disability. On the other hand, there are
factors that have had similar impacts across the
age range, such as the long-term increase in
obesity.
Our analysis has demonstrated the im-
portance of including the institutional pop-
ulation in an analysis of changes in disabled
life over time. Even after major declines in the
percentage institutionalized, in the United
States in 2010, institutionalized life accounted
for 7% of life expectancy at age 85 years
among men and 13% among women. Re-
ductions in this percentage since 1970 have
decreased the relative importance of life in
institutions and have been a force against
reduction in disability levels in the
community.
There are limitations to our analysis. Be-
cause of changing definitions of disability, we
needed to harmonize our data over time by
using estimating procedures. In addition, data
availability limited us to 1 definition of dis-
ability, and we were not able to examine
trends in minor and more major disability.
Finally, we were not able to control for
changes over time in people’s assessment of
their health and ability, or changes in the
environment that affect ability and disability.
However, we believe that the unique char-
acteristics of our analysis outweigh its limi-
tations. We covered the longest period
of time examined for trends in healthy
life expectancy, the entire age range, the
range of disability severity, and the institu-
tional as well as the community-dwelling
population.
Our analysis has produced results that add
significantly to our ability to definitively
describe the long-term trend in disability-free
life expectancy and to interpret and integrate
earlier work on trends in healthy life ex-
pectancy. The decade of the 1970s appears to
have been one of expansion of morbidity,
which coincided with the early years of
preventing mortality from chronic conditions
among the old. In this period, trends mayhave
reflected saving the ill without gains from
prevention, the beginning of the real growth
in obesity, and increases in drug usage that
may have led to increased disability among
some age groups. After 1980, there appears to
have been compression of morbidity among the
older population. Trends for the younger
population, including the working-age
population, are problematic. Although the
increase in life expectancy free from and with
disability in these ages is keeping pace, in-
dicating dynamic equilibrium, there is no
indication that the working-age group’s
ability to support an increasingly older pop-
ulation through higher Social Security and
Medicare payments is growing. In sensitivity
analyses, we examined the change over
time in life expectancy assuming that the
working ages were 20 to 70 years; the con-
clusions were similar to those we present for
age 65 years. There is little evidence from this
analysis of improving health in this age range
that would support increasing the age at
retirement.
The outlook for the future depends on the
trends in disability across the age range. It
appears that we may have begun to prevent or
delay the onset of some diseases as well as their
progression to disability, which would be
a positive influence.18 In addition, the obesity
epidemic appears to be abating.19 These
very recent trends may be promoting an in-
crease in the length of nondisabled life as
well as total life expectancy. Clearly, there is
a needto maintain health and reduce disability
at younger ages to have meaningful com-
pression of morbidity across the age range.
The trends for the last 40 years do not sup-
port projections and policies based on as-
sumptions of a reduced length of disabled life.
This demonstrates the value of using health
expectancy methods to understand the
composite effect of trends in disability
and mortality for considering policy
changes.
