Abstract
The aim of this study was to estimate the patterns of care and annual levels of
health care resource use attributable to the management of different wound types
by the UK’
s National Health Service (NHS) in 2012/2013 and the annual costs
incurred by the NHS in managing them. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of
the records of 2000 patients in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) Database.
Patients’ characteristics, wound-related health outcomes and all health care resource
use were quantified, and the total NHS cost of patient management was estimated
at 2013/2014 prices. The NHS managed an estimated 2⋅2 million patients with a
wound during 2012/2013. Patients were predominantly managed in the community by
general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. The annual NHS cost varied between £1⋅94
billion for managing 731 000 leg ulcers and £89⋅6 million for managing 87 000 burns,
and associated comorbidities. Sixty-one percent of all wounds were shown to heal in
an average year. Resource use associated with managing the unhealed wounds was
substantially greater than that of managing the healed wounds (e.g. 20% more practice
nurse visits, 104% more community nurse visits). Consequently, the annual cost of
managing wounds that healed in the study period was estimated to be £2⋅1 billion
compared with £3⋅2 billion for the 39% of wounds that did not heal within the study
year. Within the study period, the cost per healed wound ranged from £698 to £3998 per
patient and that of an unhealed wound ranged from £1719 to £5976 per patient. Hence,
the patient care cost of an unhealed wound was a mean 135% more than that of a healed
wound. Real-world evidence highlights the substantial burden that wounds impose on
the NHS in an average year. Clinical and economic benefits to both patients and the NHS
could accrue from strategies that focus on (a) wound prevention, (b) accurate diagnosis
and (c) improving wound-healing rates.
Introduction
We recently reported that the UK’
s National Health Service
(NHS) managed an estimated 2⋅2 million patients with a wound
during 2012/2013, equivalent to 4⋅5% of the adult population
(1). The annual cost to the NHS attributable to wound manage-
ment and associated comorbidities was estimated at £5⋅3 billion
(1). This equated to 4% of total expenditure on public health
in the UK in 2013 (i.e. £125⋅5 billion) (2). After adjustment
for comorbidities, the annual NHS cost of managing wounds
was estimated to be £4⋅5–5⋅1 billion, two-thirds of which was
incurred in the community and the rest in secondary care (1).
This is comparable with the annual NHS cost of managing obe-
sity, which was estimated at £5⋅0 billion in 2013 (3).

• the study showed that the NHS managed an estimated
2⋅2 million patients with a wound during 2012/2013;
the annual NHS cost of managing these wounds and
associated comorbidities was £5⋅3 billion; however, costs
differed according to wound type, varying between £1⋅94

We have already reported the prevalence of each wound type
(1). However, the aim of this article is to report the patterns
of care and related resource use attributable to managing the
different wound types in an average year and the annual costs
incurred by the NHS in managing them.
Methods
Study design
This was a retrospective cohort analysis of the records of
patients in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database,
as previously described (1).
Study population
The study population comprised the anonymised case records
of a randomly selected cohort of 1000 patients from the THIN
database who had a wound between 1 May 2012 and 30 April
2013 (cases) and a randomly selected cohort of 1000 control
patients (controls) from the database, who were matched with
the cases according to age, gender and the patient’
s general
practice.
Inclusion criteria for the cases were:
• had to be aged 18 years or above
• had to have a Read code for a wound
• had to have continuous medical history in their case
record, from the first mention of a wound in the study
year up to the time the data were extracted from the
database, unless they died, in order to exclude patients
who had moved or changed their general practice
Exclusion criteria for the cases were:
• patients with a surgical wound if they healed within
4 weeks of the surgical procedure (as any resource use
incurred will be because of the surgical procedure and
not the wound)
• patients with a dermatological tumour
One thousand control patients were matched with 1000 cases
according to the following criteria:
• age
• gender
• being managed at the same general practice
• no history of a wound in their medical record at any time
• had continuous medical history in their case record, from
the matched start date up to the time the data were
extracted from the database, unless they died
The authors obtained the complete medical records of the
2000 patients in the dataset, which enabled analysis of data
within and outside of the study period.
Study variables and statistical analyses
Information was systematically extracted from the patients’
records over the study period in accordance with the protocol.
Wound type was documented in the patients’records, and the
authors categorised them as being either acute (i.e. abscess,
burn, open wound, unhealed surgical wound, trauma) or chronic
(i.e. diabetic foot ulcer, arterial leg ulcer, mixed leg ulcer,
venous leg ulcer, pressure ulcer).
Patients’ characteristics,
comorbidities
(defined
as
a
non-acute condition that patients were suffering from in
the year before the start of their wound and not necessarily
the year before the start of the study period), wound-related
health outcomes and all community-based and secondary care
resource use were extracted from the electronic records. All
the data were quantified for cases and controls and stratified
according to wound type. Differences between the groups were
tested for statistical significance using either a Mann–Whitney
U test or a 𝜒2 test.
Logistic regression was used to investigate relationships
between baseline variables and clinical outcomes. Multiple lin-
ear regression was also used to assess the impact of patients’
baseline variables on resource use and clinical outcomes. All
statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics (V.22.0; IBM Corporation (IBM United Kingdom Limited,
Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK)).

matched patients who had never had a wound. The model spans
the 12-month period, from 1 May 2012 to 30 April 2013.
Unit costs at 2013/2014 prices (4–6) were applied to the
resource use in the model to estimate the total NHS cost of
patient management from the time a patient entered the dataset
(i.e. from 1 May 2012 or the start time of their wound if it
occurred later and the equivalent date in the matched control)
up to the time their wound healed or the end of the study
period, whichever came first. Differences between cases and
controls were considered to be attributable to wound care and
associated comorbidities.
The THIN database contained an estimated 135 000 patients
with a wound that matched the study protocol’
s inclusion and
exclusion criteria, drawn from a base population of 3⋅9 million
active patients. The whole UK population was an estimated
63⋅7 million people in mid-2013, of which 49⋅7 million people
were adults. Using these variables, the outputs of the modelling
were extrapolated to the whole adult population in the UK, as
previously described (1). Accordingly, the model estimated that
there were 2⋅2 million patients with a wound who matched the
study protocol’
s inclusion and exclusion criteria, equivalent to
4⋅5% of the adult population.
Sensitivity analyses
Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed on all of the
model’
s inputs to identify how the cost of wound management
and associated comorbidities would change by varying different
parameters in the model.
Two methods were used to adjust for the cost of managing
patients’comorbidities:
1 The first involved generating an incremental cost among
control patients between those who had no comorbidi-
ties and those who had one, two, three, four, five or
more comorbidities. These incremental costs were then
applied to both groups so that all the patients were mod-
elled to have the maximum number of comorbidities.
The resulting cost difference between the two groups was
considered to be solely because of the wounds.
2 The
second
method
involved
the
removal
of
a
case–control match from the analysis if they did not
have the same number of comorbidities. The resulting
cost difference between the two groups was considered
to be solely because of the wounds.
Results
Patients’ characteristics
The mean age of the cases was 69⋅0 years, and 45% were
male. Eighteen percent of the cases were smokers, 39% were
non-smokers and 40% were ex-smokers, and these were not
significantly different from the controls. Seventy-six percent of
cases presented with a new wound in the study year (patients’
records predated the onset of the study period, enabling both
pre-existing and new wounds to be identified; a similar process
allowed wound-healing to be characterised). There was no
evidence that patients in the dataset had more than one wound.
However, 72% of patients had a wound a mean 4⋅9 years prior to
the one being evaluated in the study period. Table 1 summarises
this data according to wound type.
Significantly more patients with a wound (94%) than control
patients (77%) had at least one comorbidity in the year before
the start of their wound (P < 0⋅001). The comorbidities associ-
ated with patients with different wound types in terms of the
percentage of patients with different comorbidities in the year
before the start of their wound (and not necessarily the year
before the start of the study period) is summarised in Table 2.
The percentage of patients in both groups with different
numbers of comorbidities, stratified by age, is summarised
in Table 3. This table shows that as many as 42% of controls
≤45 years of age (i.e. members of the general public) have
two or more comorbidities, and 23% have three or more
comorbidities.
Binary logistic regression was performed on patients’ age,
gender, smoking status and all comorbidities. Those variables
that yielded a P value ≥0⋅05 were omitted from the analysis,
resulting in the prior presence of cardiovascular disease, derma-
tological symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological

symptoms, nutritional deficiency and respiratory disease being
considered independent risk factors for developing different
wound types:
• Cardiovascular disease, an independent risk factor for
developing a pressure ulcer [odds ratio (OR) 3⋅40 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 1⋅43; 8⋅10); P = 0⋅006] and
a diabetic foot ulcer [OR 2⋅66 (95% CI: 1⋅21; 5⋅83);
P = 0⋅02]
• Dermatological symptoms, an independent risk factor
for developing a venous leg ulcer [OR 3⋅44 (95% CI:
2⋅34; 5⋅10); P < 0⋅001] and an open wound [OR 1⋅78
(95% CI: 1⋅18; 2⋅68); P = 0⋅006]
• Gastrointestinal symptoms, an independent risk factor
for developing a pressure ulcer [OR 1⋅85 (95% CI: 1⋅10;
3⋅12); P = 0⋅02] and a surgical wound [OR 1⋅82 (95%
CI: 1⋅24; 2⋅66); P = 0⋅002]
• Neurological symptoms, an independent risk factor for
developing a pressure ulcer [OR 2⋅16 (95% CI: 1⋅29;
3⋅61); P = 0⋅003]
• Nutritional deficiency, an independent risk factor for
developing a pressure ulcer [OR 4⋅52 (95% CI: 2⋅66;
7⋅71); P < 0⋅001] and an open wound [OR 1⋅64 (95% CI:
1⋅07; 2⋅49); P = 0⋅022]
• Respiratory disease, an independent risk factor for devel-
oping an open wound [OR 1⋅60 (95% CI: 1⋅05; 2⋅45);
P = 0⋅03]
Clinical outcomes
Sixty-one percent of all wounds healed in the study year;
79% of acute wounds and 43% of chronic wounds healed.
The healing rate of each wound type is shown in Table 1.
Binary logistic regression suggests that nutritional deficiency
[OR 0⋅53 (95% CI: 0.41; 0.70); P < 0⋅001] and diabetes [OR
0⋅65 (95% CI: 0.50; 0.85); P < 0⋅001] were independent risk
factors for non-healing during the study period. In addition, 4%
of patients with a wound and 1% of control patients died in the
study year.
Health care resource use associated with patient
management
Patients were predominantly managed in the community by
GPs and nurses. Table 4 shows the annualised resources asso-
ciated with each wound type and the associated comorbidities.
Assessment of peripheral perfusion is a recognised require-
ment for leg ulcer and diabetic foot management, yet only
16% of all cases with a leg or foot ulcer had a Doppler ankle
brachial pressure index (ABPI) recorded in their records, of
which 81% were treated with compression. Of the 84% that did
not have their ABPI recorded, 46% were treated with compres-
sion (Table 5).
The total annual NHS cost of managing 2⋅2 million wounds
and associated comorbidities was estimated to be £5⋅3 billion.
This ranged from £982⋅9 million for surgical wounds to £46⋅5
million for arterial leg ulcers (Table 6).
It was estimated that 1⋅3 million wounds healed (61%) and
0⋅9 million remain unhealed (39%) during the study period.
Moreover, resource use associated with managing the unhealed
wounds was substantially greater than that of managing the
healed wounds (Table 7). Consequently, the annual cost of
managing wounds that healed was estimated to be £2⋅1 billion
compared with £3⋅2 billion for the 39% of wounds that did
not heal within the study year. Furthermore, the estimated
cost of wound products associated with managing the 1⋅3
million wounds that healed was £190 million compared with

£560 million for the 0⋅9 million that did not heal (Table 7).
The only clinical difference that could be detected between
healed and unhealed wounds was that 28% of patients with a
healed wound had nutritional deficiency before the onset of the
wound compared with 42% of patients with an unhealed wound
(P < 0⋅04).
Sixty-six percent of the total annual NHS cost was incurred in
the community and the remainder in secondary care. However,
the distribution of costs varied according to wound type, with
48% and 78% of the total annual NHS cost of managing
acute and chronic wounds, respectively, being incurred in the
community and the remainder in secondary care.
Sensitivity analyses
The estimated annual number of each wound type was indi-
vidually reduced and increased by 25%. This had the effect of
changing the total annual NHS cost of managing wounds and
associated comorbidities by 5% or less. The estimated amounts
of individual resource use were varied by +/− 25%. However,
this only affected the total annual NHS cost of managing 2⋅2
million wounds and associated comorbidities by 6% or less.
When the NHS cost of managing patients was adjusted for
their comorbidities (see description of methods 1 and 2 sections
under Sensitivity Analyses in Methods), the total annual NHS
cost of managing 2⋅2 million wounds was reduced from £5⋅3
billion to £5⋅1 billion when method 1 was used and to £4⋅5 bil-
lion when method 2 was used (Table 8). Hence, the total annual
NHS cost of managing the comorbidities among 2⋅2 million
patients with a wound was estimated to be between £250 and
£788 million. After adjusting for comorbidities, the total annual
NHS cost of managing healed wounds and unhealed wounds
was estimated to be £1⋅9 billion and £2⋅9 billion, respectively.
In addition, within the study period, the cost per healed
wound ranged from £698 to £3998 per patient and that of
an unhealed wound ranged from £1719 to £5976 per patient.
After adjusting for comorbidities, the per patient cost of healed
wounds was reduced by a mean 12% compared with 8% for
unhealed wounds (Table 9). In addition, the per patient cost
of an unhealed wound was a mean 135% more than that of a
healed wound.

Discussion
This article reports the health economic burden that differ-
ent wound types imposed on the NHS in 2012/2013. After
adjustment for comorbidities, the annual NHS cost of managing
2⋅2 million wounds was estimated to be £4⋅5–5⋅1 billion. Of
these wounds, it was estimated that 1⋅3 million wounds healed
(61%) and 0⋅9 million remained unhealed (39%). Moreover,
resource use associated with managing the unhealed wounds
was substantially greater than that of managing the healed
wounds (20% more practice nurse visits, 104% more com-
munity nurse visits, 13% more GP visits, 18% more hospital
outpatient visits, 40% more drug prescriptions). Consequently,
the annual cost of managing wounds that healed was estimated
to be £2⋅1 billion compared with £3⋅2 billion for the 39% of
wounds that did not heal within the study year. This is consistent
with other evidence that the total time to healing was an impor-
tant factor in driving the cost in terms of dressing frequency,
product costs and nursing time (7). In addition, the mean cost
of an unhealed wound per patient was approximately 2⋅5 times
more than that of a healed wound during the study period. The
cost driver for wound care was found to be the probability of
wounds not healing and that nutritional deficiency (OR 0⋅53;
P < 0.001) and diabetes (OR 0⋅65; P < 0.001) were independent
risk factors for non-healing. Moreover, the only clinical differ-
ence that was detected between healed and unhealed wounds
was the percentage of patients with nutritional deficiency (28%
versus 42% for patients with a healed and unhealed wound,
respectively).

This and other studies (8–11) show that wound manage-
ment is predominantly a nurse-led discipline. Despite this, there
would appear to be minimal clinical involvement of tissue
viability nurses and other specialist nurses (Table 4). In addi-
tion, dressing and bandage types were continually switched at
successive wound dressing changes, indicating confusion and
conflict within the treatment plan. Moreover, an estimated 30%
of all wounds being managed within the NHS lacked a dif-
ferential diagnosis. This may be indicative of the difficulties
experienced by non-specialist health care professionals in the
community with establishing a working diagnosis. Further-
more, only 16% of patients with a lower leg ulcer or dia-
betic foot ulceration underwent a vascular assessment with
the Doppler ABPI, although national guidance requires arterial
assessment by Doppler ultrasound measurement of the ABPI
(12,13). It remains unclear why this essential investigation was
not routinely performed. Low levels of Doppler assessment
have been reported previously, and the lack of use of ABPI as a
screening tool may contribute to the lower prevalence of arterial
leg ulcers than would be expected from previously published
data (14).
The wound patients had significantly more comorbidities
than their matched controls. Only 6% of cases and 23% of
controls had no comorbidities (P < 0⋅001). However, it was sur-
prising to find such a high level of illness among the controls.
For example, 55%, 26% and 13% of controls <30 years of age
had at least one or more, two or more or three or more comor-
bidities, respectively. The THIN dataset in this study covers
the period 2012/2013 and comprises patients with a wide age
range (19–98 years), so this level of illness may be a proxy
for the health of the general population at that time. Further-
more, the presence of nutritional deficiency was an independent
risk factor for wound non-healing. Hence, community preven-
tion of patients developing nutritional deficiency should help
improve healing rates following the onset of a wound. More-
over, if patients’wounds and their comorbidities were treated
more holistically with appropriate involvement of allied health
care professionals, rather than just focusing on the wounds, bet-
ter health outcomes might be achieved at lower cost.
This study has demonstrated a lack of evidence-based wound
care (lack of differential diagnosis), treatment at times deviated
from approved guidelines (few Doppler tests being performed),
lack of senior engagement in wound care delivery and lack
of continuity and consistency of wound care and treatment
planning. The NHS Five-Year Forward View (5YFV) (15)
identified a national need for a different integrated model of
health and social care, which is ‘
joined up’and which addresses
the needs of patients with long-term illnesses. Clearly, wound
care requires such a change in its service delivery model. This
could be achieved by:
• Enhanced support for safe self-care (possibly by integra-
tion with local pharmacy support and supervision).
• Improved diagnostic support underpinned by increased
training and education of non-specialist nurses in the fun-
damentals of wound management and faster adoption of
advanced medical devices with proven clinical effective-
ness.
• An integrated progressive care pathway with agreed
defined trigger points for senior involvement and onward
referral for investigation and differential diagnosis and a
shared management plan to be implemented regardless
of care setting.
• Consistent and integrated care with unified support-
ing documentation, including joined-up management by
health and social care, wider commissioning and involve-
ment of qualified tissue viability specialists and dedi-
cated wound care clinics in the community.
• Holistic assessment of patients recognising that patients’
comorbidities impact the probability of wound develop-
ment and healing.
These measures should help overcome some of the problems
encountered in clinical practice and achieve better outcomes in
terms of (a) wound prevention, (b) accuracy of diagnosis and
(c) wound-healing rates. In turn, these actions should lessen
workload and associated health care resource use and lead to
reductions in the cost of wound care.
Previous studies have estimated the cost of some wound
types. One such study estimated the annual NHS cost of treat-
ing patients with venous ulceration to be £168–198 million and
£300 million for diabetic foot ulcers (16). These costs are lower
than our estimates and probably reflect that study’
s limitations
of indirectly extrapolating costs from small sample sizes. In
addition, the annual NHS cost of managing pressure ulcers was
estimated to be £1⋅8–2⋅6 billion (16). This cost is substantially
higher than our estimate of £531 million. The difference may
be because of people residing in nursing homes not having been
included in our study. It may also be because of under-recording
of pressure ulcers in patients’records and/or an over-estimation
in the previous studies and/or a lower prevalence in 2012/2013
than in 2005/2006. Nevertheless, there has been much discus-
sion in the literature about the cost to heal pressure ulcers. Ben-
nett et al. estimated that the mean cost of healing a pressure
ulcer ranged from £1064 per patient for an uncomplicated cate-
gory I ulcer to £10 551 per patient for a category IV ulcer (17).

According to our study, the mean cost of managing a healed
and unhealed pressure ulcer, after adjusting for comorbidities,
was £2343 and £4185, respectively. In 2009/2010, the Northern
Burn Care Network estimated the cost of UK burn care provi-
sion to be £140 million (18). This cost is substantially higher
than our estimate of £89⋅6 million and may reflect that patients
<18 years of age were excluded from our analysis. It may also
reflect different costing methodologies and any differences in
the annual prevalence of burns.
The advantages and disadvantages of using the THIN
database for this study have been previously discussed (1). In
summary, the advantage of using the THIN database is that
the patient pathways and associated resource use are based on
real-world evidence derived from clinical practice. The cost of
managing the comorbidities was estimated to be between £250
and £788 million. Nevertheless, the possibility of resource
use associated with managing a comorbidity being conflated
with that of wound management cannot be excluded. While
the study results are compelling, the analyses were based on
clinicians’ entries into their patients’ records and inevitably
subject to a certain amount of imprecision and lack of detail.
Moreover, the computerised information in the THIN database
is collected by GPs for clinical care purposes and not for
research. Prescriptions issued by GPs and practice nurses are
recorded in the database, but it does not specify whether the
prescriptions were dispensed or detail patient compliance with
the product. Despite these limitations, it is the authors’opinion
that the THIN database affords one of the best sources of
real-world evidence for clinical practice in the UK.
The analysis does not consider the potential impact of those
wounds that remained unhealed beyond the study period. No
assumptions were made regarding missing data, and there were
no interpolations. The THIN database may have under-recorded
use of some health care resources outside the GP’
s surgery
if not documented in the GP records, and the impact of this
was addressed in sensitivity analyses. The analysis excludes
hospital-based prescribing, but this should have minimal impact
on the results as most prescribing is undertaken by GPs and
nurses in the community. Also excluded is the potential impact
of managing patients with wounds being cared for in nurs-
ing/residential homes.
The analysis only considered the annual cost of NHS
resource use for the ‘
average adult patient’
, and no attempt
was made to stratify resource use and costs according to
gender, comorbidities, wound size, wound severity and other
disease-related factors. Also excluded were the costs incurred
by patients and indirect costs incurred by society as a result of
patients taking time off work.
Notwithstanding the study’
s limitations, the real-world evi-
dence highlights the substantial burden that wounds impose on
the NHS in an average year. Clinical and economic benefits to
both patients and the NHS could accrue from strategies that
focus on (a) wound prevention, (b) accurate diagnosis and (c)
improving wound-healing rates.
