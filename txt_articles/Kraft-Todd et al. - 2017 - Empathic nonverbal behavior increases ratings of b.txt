Abstract
In medicine, it is critical that clinicians demonstrate both empathy (perceived as warmth)
and competence. Perceptions of these qualities are often intuitive and are based on nonver-
bal behavior. Emphasizing both warmth and competence may prove problematic, however,
because there is evidence that they are inversely related in other settings. We hypothesize
that perceptions of physician competence will instead be positively correlated with percep-
tions of physician warmth and empathy, potentially due to changing conceptions of the phy-
sician’s role. We test this hypothesis in an analog medical context using a large online
sample, manipulating physician nonverbal behaviors suggested to communicate empathy
(e.g. eye contact) and competence (the physician’s white coat). Participants rated physi-
cians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior as more empathic, warm, and more compe-
tent than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior, adjusting for mood. We
found no warmth/competence tradeoff and, additionally, no significant effects of the white
coat. Further, compared with male participants, female participants perceived physicians
displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior as less empathic. Given the significant conse-
quences of clinician empathy, it is important for clinicians to learn how nonverbal behavior
contributes to perceptions of warmth, and use it as another tool to improve their patients’
emotional and physical health.
Introduction
We define empathy as a social-emotional ability having two distinct components: one affective:
the ability to share the emotions of others, and one cognitive: the ability to understand the emo-
tions of others. This definition is supported by evidence that these two components have disso-
ciable neurological substrates [1, 2]. This approach is broad enough to encompass elements of

 various components of empathy that have been proposed [3, 4]—e.g. sympathy (or shared
emotions) [5], perspective taking [6], and accurate interpersonal perception [7, 8]—while dis-
tinguishing basic cognitive processes underlying them. It is necessary for an operational defini-
tion of empathy to focus on the cognition of the empathic subject (i.e. the person expressing
empathy, such as a physician), but because empathy is fundamentally a relational ability, it is
also useful to understand the cognition of the empathic object (i.e. the individual whose emo-
tions are being empathized with, such as a patient). There is extensive evidence that empathy
(expressed by the subject) is perceived (by the object) as warmth [e.g. 9]. In this paper, we
therefore discuss empathy and warmth as two sides of the same coin (i.e. “empathy/warmth”),
in that they are functionally linked in the context of social interaction.
Empathy is particularly important in the context of medicine, where evidence suggests it is
related to numerous positive outcomes [for a review, see 10] including increased patient satis-
faction [11], good patient rapport [12], increased adherence to treatment [13], increased diag-
nostic accuracy [14], reduced medical errors [15], and positive health outcomes [16–18]
(though see [19]; an intervention of care-giver investment does not alter diabetes outcomes).
Other explorations of how physicians are perceived have further differentiated perceptions of
empathy, distinguishing two dimensions: caring (similar to high empathy) and dominance
(similar to low empathy) [20]. Conveying competence is also important in medicine, as the lit-
erature on “medical professionalism” demonstrates [21, 22]. There have even been attempts to
institutionalize professionalism through, for example, the doctor’s “white coat” [23]. The white
coat has traditionally played a significant part in physician identity formation during medical
training [24–28] as well as role identity in clinical settings. Empathy (perceived as warmth)
and competence are not only important in medicine, but are two frequently-used dimensions
of person perception across many contexts [29].
While ratings of empathy are positively correlated with perceptions of warmth both in the
lab [e.g. 30] and in clinical contexts [e.g. 31, 32], there is evidence that perceptions of warmth
and competence can be inversely related in some contexts [33–37]. Four mechanisms of the
warmth/competence tradeoff are particularly relevant here. First, people can exhibit compen-
satory judgments of warmth and competence [38] particularly when they are under threat
[39]. Because high status and wealth are associated with high ratings of competence [40] and
physicians are often considered high status, patients who are threatened by an upward social
comparison may be biased to perceive their physicians as less warm. Second, though warmth
and competence can be positively related in judgments of individuals, they are more likely to
be negatively related in judgments of groups [37]. To the extent that a patient sees a clinician
as a member of an outgroup—such as the “upper class,” but also in terms of other social group
categories, e.g. gender or ethnicity—they may be more likely to exhibit compensatory judg-
ments of warmth and competence. Third, when comparing two others, people see one individ-
ual or group as high on one dimension and low on the other, and the inverse for the object of
comparison (e.g. among women [34], businesses [41], and immigrant groups [42]). Patients
who are comparing their current clinician experience with others in the past therefore may
perceive warm clinicians as less competent and vice versa. Finally, when being perceived,
people engage in impression management, downplaying one dimension to highlight the
other [36]. Clinicians who are trying to convey empathy, therefore, may downplay their
competence.
The field of medicine therefore faces a dilemma: if empathy (perceived as warmth) and
competence are both important, but are inversely related in patients’ perceptions, which
should be emphasized? Indeed, some have argued that an emphasis on empathic clinician
behaviors could negatively impact patient perceptions of clinician competence [43] while oth-
ers argue that the white coat might emphasize professionalism at the cost of humanism [44,

 45]. However, “competence” in the medical context embodies both technical competence (i.e.
skill in medical procedures and biological knowledge) and interpersonal competence (i.e. skill
in medical social interactions). Given that patients consider interpersonal competence to be
crucial in their evaluations of clinicians, one might expect that competence and empathy/
warmth would be positively correlated because empathy is increasingly becoming a compo-
nent of successful medical care or interpersonal competence [46]. This distinction and trend in
the understanding of medical competence is consistent with the movement of patient-centered
care [47] (and more recently, relationship-centered care [48]), which emphasizes patient expe-
rience with and understanding of treatment (including emotional and social implications).
Patient- or relationship-centered care models have demonstrated both increased efficiency in
treatment and better health outcomes [49, 50]. We therefore predicted that empathic nonver-
bal behavior will increase perceptions of clinician warmth and competence.
Empathy is communicated through both verbal and nonverbal behaviors [51], though the
power of nonverbal communication of empathy may be underestimated, as nonverbal behav-
ior can communicate emotional states subtly [52] and automatically [53]. Further, the litera-
ture on “thin slicing,” demonstrates that we rapidly make judgments of others [54, 55]. In
medical education, emphasis has traditionally been placed on training clinicians in verbal com-
munication [56], with relatively little attention paid to nonverbal communication [57, 58]. The
nonverbal behavior literature provides widespread support for the claim that good nonverbal
behavior is crucial to patient-centered care in medicine [59, 60], and identifies a number of
specific nonverbal behaviors that influence patients’ perceptions of clinicians [58, 61–63]. For
example, open body posture (uncrossed arms), eye contact, smiling, and touch express positive
affect, involvement, availability, attention, warmth, encouragement, respect, understanding,
empathy, and affiliation with the patient [56, 58, 64–68]. Further, nonverbal communication
is also related to positive health outcomes, such as increased pain tolerance [69]. In medical
practice, humanistic concern for patient well-being—which can be expressed via these nonver-
bal behaviors—drives the standard of care forward and incentives for quality care have grown
as healthcare reimbursement from third-party payers is now often tied to patient satisfaction
surveys [64, 70]. There is relatively less research on nonverbal communication of clinician
competence in general [71], and perceptions of the white coat in particular [72]. Because
there is a growing debate about the effects of the white coat [68, 73–79], we thought manipulat-
ing its presence would be a particularly interesting test of the nonverbal communication of
competence.
In the present study, we test whether a warmth/competence trade-off will occur in response
to clinicians’ nonverbal behavior. We also test for interactions of participant gender with our
independent variables as previous findings have indicated gender differences in judgments of
warmth and competence [80–83]. Specifically, while both men and women judge traits related
to warmth to be more important than traits related to competence in their formation of im-
pressions of others, women judge the relative importance of traits related to warmth to be sig-
nificantly more important [84]. There is a gender-role stereotype that women are warmer than
men, and these findings might be partially explained by women internalizing this stereotype
which transfers to their perception of others [81]. Finally, we wanted to ensure that any effect
we found was not driven by mood, such that our manipulations put participants in a positive
or negative mood, which then influenced their perceptions of clinicians [85]. Therefore, we
included participant mood as a covariate in our analyses to ensure that participants’ ratings of
clinicians are attributable to our manipulations. We provide preliminary evidence that nonver-
bal empathic behaviors increase patient perceptions of clinician empathy, warmth, and compe-
tence. We find that this effect may be stronger for women, cannot be attributed to mood, and
that there is no effect of the white coat.

 Methods
Participant characteristics
We used the crowdsourcing tool Amazon Mechanical Turk to recruit 1,377 U.S. participants
(60% female, 80% white, mean age 36yrs., range 18–80) as analog patients [86] in an online
study requiring 7 minutes of participants’ time and paying them $0.30 (commensurate with
pay for similar tasks on this platform; see [87–92]). Participants were randomly assigned to 1
of 4 conditions in a 2 (empathic v. unempathic nonverbal behavior) x 2 (white coat v. no white
coat) factorial design. This study was run in 2 runs; in the first run (N = 194), we did not mani-
pulate the white coat, so subjects were randomly assigned to one of 2 conditions: empathic
v. unempathic nonverbal behavior (physicians were wearing the white coat in both condi-
tions). In the second run (N = 1,177), we did manipulate the white coat, so subjects were ran-
domly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions in the full 2 (empathic v. unempathic nonverbal behavior)
x 2 (white coat v. no white coat) factorial design. The result is that the white coat conditions
had average n = 392 while the no white coat conditions had average n = 297. We found no sig-
nificant main effects of run on any of our dependent variables, nor did we find any significant
interactions of run with any independent variable, so we collapsed across run for our analyses.
The study was IRB-approved by the Partners Human Research Committee and all participants
provided online informed consent.
Study design and protocol
Participants viewed a series of 6 photographs of either a male or a female (randomly assigned)
physician displaying various nonverbal behaviors that were either all empathic or unempathic
(see Fig 1. Photographs were of real physicians—the individuals in these photographs provided
written informed consent, as outlined in PLOS consent form, to publish these case details. See
S1 File Stimuli for detailed descriptions). Each photograph was paired with 2 lines of a scripted
patient-physician conversation (see S1 File Stimuli; all participants saw the same script), and
participants were instructed to imagine that they were the patient. In the empathic condition,
each photograph depicted the same physician displaying various nonverbal behaviors which
have been implicated in physician empathy (eye contact, equal patient-physician eye-level, no
physical barrier, open posture, touch, and concerned facial expression) [58]. In the unempathic
condition, the same physician displayed the opposite nonverbal behaviors (no eye contact,
unequal eye-level, physical barrier, closed posture, no touch, and unconcerned facial expres-
sion). In the white coat condition, each photograph depicted the same physician wearing a white
coat over their clothes, while in the no white coat condition, they simply removed the white coat.
All scenes progressed automatically in 3 phases: photograph only (2sec); photograph and script
(6sec); photograph only (2sec). This progression allowed participants to focus on the image and
nonverbal behaviors displayed by the physician while also incorporating the content of the ver-
bal communication. After viewing all 6 scenes in the interaction, participants completed 3 rating
scales (see S2 File Scales) in random order to assess their current mood, perceptions of clinician
empathy, and perceptions of clinician warmth and competence. Finally, participants completed
several demographic measures, were debriefed, and thanked for their participation.
Study measures
Mood was measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), a 20-item scale
with 2 ten-item subscales for positive affect and negative affect (“Indicate to what extent you
feel this way right now, at the present moment:” e.g., “Excited”, “Upset”, respectively) rated
on a 5-point scale (from “Very slightly or not at all” to “Extremely”) [93]. Both subscales

 demonstrated high reliability—PANAS positive (α = .90) and PANAS negative (α = .93)—so
we created respective composite measures that were the means of the respective items in these
subscales. Empathy was measured using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
measure [66], a 10-item (e.g., “How was the doctor at showing care and compassion (seeming
genuinely concerned, connecting with you on a human level; not being indifferent or ‘de-
tached’)?”) 5-point scale (from “poor” to “excellent”). Though there are many measures of
empathy in the literature (e.g. [3]), we felt that the widely used, reliable and validated CARE
measure was appropriate because it captures the components of our definition of empathy and
is tailored to the clinical context. The CARE measure demonstrated high reliability (α = .97) so
we created a composite measure that was the mean of the items in this measure. Warmth and
competence were measured using a 9-item scale based on Fiske’s stereotype content model
[29, 33]; 4 items measured warmth (e.g., “How much did the doctor seem to be caring”) and 5
measured competence (e.g., “How much did the doctor seem to be intelligent”) on a 5-point

 scale (from 0 to 4). Both measures demonstrated high reliability—warmth (α = .92), compe-
tence (α = .71)—so we created respective composite measures that were the means of the
respective items in these subscales.
Data collection and analysis
We used STATA 13.1 to compute all statistics. We found no significant main effects of our
white coat manipulation on any of our dependent variables nor did we find any significant
interactions of white coat with any independent variable, so we eliminated it from our analyses
(and our results are qualitatively the same whether the white coat is included or not). To assess
whether physician nonverbal behavior (empathic vs. unempathic) and participant gender
affected participants’ ratings of physician empathy, warmth, and competence, we conducted
three separate three-way ANCOVAs, with positive and negative mood as covariates.
Results
Relation among participant ratings of physician empathy, warmth, and
competence
We tested for correlations among participant ratings of empathy, warmth and competence
(see Fig 2A), and found that each pair was significant (all values shown with Bonferroni correc-
tions) and highly correlated: warmth and empathy (r(1375) = .83, p < .001), warmth and com-
petence (r(1375) = .61, p < .001), and competence and empathy (r(1375) = .48, p < .001).
Though we expected a large correlation between empathy and warmth, given the moderate-to-
large correlations of competence with empathy and warmth, we performed a principal compo-
nents analysis with varimax (orthogonal) rotation of these three ratings to determine the extent
to which we could interpret competence as a separate rating. We find that two orthogonal fac-
tors explain 95% of the variance. We find that while warmth and empathy load strongly on
one component, competence loads strongly on the other (Fig 2B).
Participant ratings of physician empathy
As a manipulation check, we first tested participant ratings of physician empathy. Adjusting
for mood, we found a significant main effect of nonverbal behavior on ratings of empathy
such that participants rated physicians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior as more
empathic (M = 3.29, SD = 1.15) than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior
(M = 1.86, SD = .93, F(1,1362) = 568.49, p < .001, η2
p = .30; see Fig 3). There was also a signifi-
cant, albeit very small, main effect of subject gender such that male participants rated physi-
cians in both conditions as more empathic (M = 2.70, SD = 1.21) than the female participants

 (M = 2.49, SD = 1.30, F(1,1362) = 6.60, p = .01, η2
p = .005). There was a marginally significant
interaction of nonverbal behavior with participant gender (F(1,1362) = 3.00, p = .084, η2
p =
.002) such that in the unempathic condition, women perceived physicians as less empathic
(M = 1.73, SD = .88) than men (M = 2.05, SD = .98, F(679) = 13.48, p < .001, η2
p = .02). Positive
mood was a significant covariate of these effects, such that higher positive mood was associated
with higher ratings of physician empathy (F(1,1362) = 95.98, p < .001, η2
p = .07). Negative
mood was not a significant covariate of these effects, and there was no association of negative
mood with ratings of physician empathy.
Participant ratings of physician warmth
Adjusting for mood, we found a significant main effect of nonverbal behavior on ratings of
warmth such that participants rated physicians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior as
more warm (M = 3.73, SD = .93) than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behavior
(M = 2.28, SD = .98, F(1,1362) = 674.49, p < .001, η2
p = .33). We also found a significant interac-
tion of nonverbal behavior with participant gender (F(1,1362) = 4.88, p = .027, η2
p = .004) such
that in the unempathic condition, women perceived physicians as less warm (M = 2.20, SD =
0.98) than men (M = 2.42, SD = .95, F(1,679) = 4.46, p = .035, η2
p = .007). Positive and negative
mood were both significant covariates of these effects, such that higher positive mood was asso-
ciated with higher ratings of physician warmth (F(1,1362) = 64.68, p < .001, η2
p = .05) and
higher negative mood was associated with lower ratings of physicians warmth (F(1,1362) =
12.41, p < .001, η2
p = .01).
Participant ratings of physician competence
Adjusting for mood, there was a significant main effect of nonverbal behavior on ratings of
competence, such that participants rated physicians displaying empathic nonverbal behavior
as more competent (M = 3.64, SD = .65) than physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal
behavior (M = 3.21, SD = .81, F(1,1362) = 85.11, p < .001, η2
p = .06). Positive and negative

 mood were also significant covariates of these effects, such that higher positive mood was asso-
ciated with higher ratings of physician competence (F(1,1362) = 87.65, p < .001, η2
p = .06) and
higher negative mood was associated with lower ratings of physician competence (F(1,1362) =
14.25, p < .001, η2
p = .01).
Discussion
We provide evidence that nonverbal empathic behaviors increase patient perceptions of clini-
cian empathy, warmth, and competence, regardless of whether the clinician is wearing a white
coat. Further, this effect cannot be attributed to mood and it may be stronger for women.
In our design, participants were randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions in a 2 (empathic
v. unempathic nonverbal behavior) x 2 (white coat or no white coat) factorial design. In the
empathic nonverbal condition, the physician displayed numerous empathic nonverbal behav-
iors concurrently, while in the unempathic nonverbal condition, the physician displayed
numerous unempathic nonverbal behaviors concurrently. In the white coat condition, (the
same) physicians wore a white coat while in the no white coat condition, they did not.
Our manipulation check of whether empathic nonverbal behaviors increased patient per-
ceptions of empathy confirmed our hypothesis, explaining 29% of the variance. Consistent
with prior research showing that empathy is perceived as warmth [9], we found empathic non-
verbal behaviors increased patient perceptions of warmth, explaining 33% of the variance.
Contrary to findings of a warmth/competence tradeoff in other domains [e.g. 34, 36], we
found that in the context of patient-clinician interactions, empathic nonverbal behaviors
increased patient perceptions of competence, though the effect size was small, explaining 6%
of the variance. This might reflect changing expectations about the role of clinicians [64, 67,
94] and the importance of interpersonal competence [e.g. 95] in addition to traditional techni-
cal competence in medical procedures and biological knowledge.
Contrary to prior research [71], we did not find an effect of the clinician white coat on per-
ceptions of empathy, warmth, or competence. Consistent with prior research [96], we found
that female subjects were more attuned to signals of empathy than male subjects, as women
rated physicians displaying unempathic nonverbal behaviors significantly less empathic and
less warm than men, though this effect was quite small, accounting for only 0.3–0.7% of the
variance. Finally, mood was a significant covariate of ratings of empathy, warmth, and compe-
tence, but it did not explain the effect of our nonverbal behavior manipulation. Positive mood
was consistently significantly correlated with our effects, accounting for 5–6% of the variance
while negative mood had a smaller effect in the opposite direction, accounting for 1% of the
variance.
Limitations
There are a number of limitations to the current study: 1) null findings from our nonverbal
competence manipulation, 2) the online analog design [97], employing still photographs rather
than video or live actors, 3) including only one medical context (physicians as the only health-
care provider, both of whom were white, and only one physician of each gender), and 4) clus-
tering empathic nonverbal behaviors without investigating the individual contributions of
each. Each of these suggest clear directions for future research.
The null finding of our nonverbal competence manipulation is especially interesting given
that the white coat was instituted to convey physician competence [23] and research demon-
strating that formal dress increases perception of physician competence [e.g. 98]. One possible
explanation for our null result is that it is a “halo effect” [85] of the empathic nonverbal behav-
ior manipulation; i.e., the effect of empathic nonverbal behavior was stronger and participants’

 perceptions of empathy influenced their perceptions of competence, overshadowing any effect
of the white coat. Other explanations include that the white coat simply does not affect percep-
tions of physician warmth (and so there might not be as much cause for concern as has been
argued [e.g. 75]), or that the analog setting does not evoke ecologically valid reactions to the
white coat. Also, it may be that the contrast between competence conditions was not strong
enough; in the non-white coat condition, our physicians were wearing semi-formal dress rather
than less professional attire, such as jeans and t-shirts (though this would be a manipulation of
formal dress rather than the white coat specifically). Further, it should be noted that our design
was between-subjects, and so a direct comparison between physicians wearing and not wearing
a white coat might make the effect of the white coat more salient, which could be explored in
future research using a within-subjects design. Future research might therefore test other
manipulations of nonverbal competence behaviors. Finally, though we acknowledge the differ-
ence between interpersonal and technical competence, we did not explore this distinction in the
present study. Future research might also disambiguate these components of competence.
This study was conducted online, asking participants to imagine themselves as patients
rather than manipulating actual patient-clinician encounters. There is evidence that analog
designs can be useful for studies of medical communication [86], though conducting an inter-
vention study in a real medical setting would provide stronger evidence for our conclusions.
We did not ask participants whether they thought the physicians pictured were real doctors,
which could have affected the extent to which were able to successfully imagine themselves in
the scenario. Because manipulations in analog studies could be moderated by the extent of par-
ticipant engagement, this sort of manipulation check would be important to include in future
research. Further, our Amazon Mechanical Turk subject pool is slightly younger, better edu-
cated, poorer, and more white than a representative sample of the US population [99] (though
more representative than samples drawn from college undergraduates [100]). Finally, by using
still photographs, we may be missing subtle cues of nonverbal behavior that are conveyed with
more fidelity in video or by using live actors; this is a promising area for future research. While
previous research has shown that nonverbal behavior can be explored using photographs
[101–104], these more ecologically valid methods would enhance the generalizability of these
results.
The medical context we used in this study was intentionally vague; while the script de-
scribed negative test results and a required surgery (see S1 File Stimuli), much is left unspeci-
fied. It is possible that the effect of nonverbal behavior in communicating empathy could be
mediated by several situational variables, including medical context (e.g. routine vs. emer-
gency), patient affect (e.g. anxious vs. sad), and the interaction of patient and clinician cultural
backgrounds and group identities. Future research could investigate the impact of these situa-
tional variables. In particular, there is an important literature using social role theory to explain
how perceptions of physician empathy is influenced by physician gender [105–108]. For exam-
ple, male physicians are evaluated more positively than female physicians when displaying
patient-centered behavior, which could be due to the gender-role stereotyped expectation that
female physicians will be more patient-centered [109]. In the present study, we did not analyze
the effect of physician gender because we were limited to one physician of each gender in our
design, and so any physician gender differences might be attributable to the specific physicians
we used as models. Future research therefore might use multiple male and female physicians
in their stimuli to test for the effect of physician gender on perceptions of empathy/warmth,
and competence. In a similar vein, we only investigated the nonverbal behavior of physicians.
It is likely that the nonverbal expressions of empathy communicated by other members of a
medical team have significant effects on patient outcomes [110], though this question has not
received as much research attention.

 Finally, we used a “kitchen sink” approach to the nonverbal communication of empathy. In
other words, we culled the literature for nonverbal behaviors known to affect perceptions of
empathy, and ultimately chose the six that had the most robust evidence base [58]. Our em-
pathic and unempathic conditions varied all six simultaneously, so we were unable to deter-
mine the impact of each individual nonverbal behavior on the communication of empathy.
Future research could address this question in a deconstruction study that explores patient
perception of empathy based on each individual nonverbal behavior, as well as the impact of
empathic nonverbal behavior on mood, and the resulting mediating relationship on ratings of
empathy/warmth and competence.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest a clear practical implication: incorporate empathic nonverbal training into
medical education. A recent meta-analysis shows the empathy trainings can be successful [111],
and one in particular emphasizing nonverbal behavior demonstrated a significant increase to
patient ratings of clinician empathy [67]. Empathy training is therefore not only possible, but
practical, both because third-party payers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
are increasingly emphasizing patient satisfaction scores for reimbursement and also because the
patient-clinician relationship has a positive effect on medical outcomes [16]. Empathy training
may even contribute to improved cross-cultural care, as implicit bias against minorities can be
communicated nonverbally [112, 113]. Given the significant consequences of clinician empathy,
it is important for clinicians to learn how nonverbal behavior contributes to empathic commu-
nication, and use it as another tool to improve their patients’ emotional and physical health.
