Abstract
Background
Health services across the world increasingly face pressures on the use of expensive hospi-
tal services. Better organisation and delivery of primary care has the potential to manage
demand and reduce costs for hospital services, but routine primary care services are not
open during evenings and weekends.
Extended access (evening and weekend opening) is hypothesized to reduce pressure
on hospital services from emergency department visits. However, the existing evidence-
base is weak, largely focused on emergency out-of-hours services, and analysed using a
before-and after-methodology without effective comparators.
Methods and Findings
Throughout 2014, 56 primary care practices (346,024 patients) in Greater Manchester,
England, offered 7-day extended access, compared with 469 primary care practices
(2,596,330 patients) providing routine access. Extended access included evening and
weekend opening and served both urgent and routine appointments. To assess the effects
of extended primary care access on hospital services, we apply a difference-in-differences
analysis using hospital administrative data from 2011 to 2014. Propensity score matching
techniques were used to match practices without extended access to practices with
extended access. Differences in the change in “minor” patient-initiated emergency depart-
ment visits per 1,000 population were compared between practices with and without
extended access.

 Populations registered to primary care practices with extended access demonstrated a
26.4% relative reduction (compared to practices without extended access) in patient-initi-
ated emergency department visits for “minor” problems (95% CI -38.6% to -14.2%, absolute
difference: -10,933 per year, 95% CI -15,995 to -5,866), and a 26.6% (95% CI -39.2% to
-14.1%) relative reduction in costs of patient-initiated visits to emergency departments for
minor problems (absolute difference: -£767,976, -£1,130,767 to -£405,184). There was an
insignificant relative reduction of 3.1% in total emergency department visits (95% CI -6.4%
to 0.2%). Our results were robust to several sensitivity checks. A lack of detailed cost report-
ing of the running costs of extended access and an inability to capture health outcomes and
other health service impacts constrain the study from assessing the full cost-effectiveness
of extended access to primary care.
Conclusions
The study found that extending access was associated with a reduction in emergency
department visits in the first 12 months. The results of the research have already informed
the decision by National Health Service England to extend primary care access across
Greater Manchester from 2016. However, further evidence is needed to understand
whether extending primary care access is cost-effective and sustainable.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Recent policy in England has focused on providing a 7-day National Health Service,
which includes extending access to primary care outside of normal working hours (in
the evenings and on weekends).
• There is limited evidence that improving access to primary care by providing additional
appointments outside of routine working hours reduces demand at emergency
departments.
• National Health Service Greater Manchester provided £3.1 million to enable several
groups of practices to provide additional non-working hour appointments during 2014;
this study evaluates the effects of these appointments on emergency department
attendances.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• The change in emergency department attendance in 2014 compared to average atten-
dance in 2011–2013 was calculated for 56 practices (346,024 patients) with additional
non-working hour appointments and compared to 469 practices (2,596,330 patients)
without additional appointments in Greater Manchester.
• In 2014, emergency department attendance for patients self-referring with minor condi-
tions dropped by 26.4% (10,933 fewer visits) in comparison to practices without addi-
tional appointments.

 • Emergency department costs for treating patients self-referring with minor conditions
reduced by £767,976 in comparison to practices without additional appointments.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• This study provides evidence showing additional primary care appointments outside of
working hours may reduce attendance at emergency departments but may not be cost-
saving to the health service as a whole.
• The findings of the study may not be observed in areas unlike Greater Manchester,
England.
• Practices could opt in to providing additional appointments. Whilst we compare similar
practices on the characteristics we can observe, unobservable differences may restrict the
generalisability of the findings of the study.
Introduction
In common with health services worldwide, the United Kingdom National Health Service
(NHS) faces high demand and cost pressures. In 2014–15, there were 18.5 million visits at
emergency departments in hospitals in England, 20.9% of which resulted in a hospital admis-
sion [1]. The annual cost of non-admitted emergency department activity in 2013–14 was
£2,300 million (US$3,500/€3,200 million), representing 4% of total hospital costs and 2.2% of
total health expenditure [2].
High-quality primary care services improve health and reduce mortality and health inequal-
ities [3]. In the UK NHS, accessible, integrated health care services, with primary care at their
core, feature across the political spectrum [4]. Financial pressures on the NHS in England have
led to a policy focus on improving access to primary care, both to deliver a more convenient
service for patients and, in doing so, to relieve pressures on hospital care. To this end, the UK
government has invested £150 million (US$229/€207 million) since 2013 in a number of
regional initiatives to extend access to primary care across England, as part of a long-term plan
to extend seven-day working across the entire NHS.
A factor which may limit the impact of primary care on use of emergency departments is
opening hours of primary care facilities. In the UK, primary care services are provided by gen-
eral practitioners (GPs), and conventional working hours are approximately 8:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.
M., Monday to Friday, with out-of-hours services provided by a contracted provider. In
England, 26.5% of unplanned emergency department use followed unsuccessful attempts to
access primary care [5], and use of other types of urgent care also arise out of similar issues
[6,7]. Extending access to primary care beyond conventional hours (so-called “out-of-hours”
or “after hours”‘ services) may reduce emergency department use by providing patients with
an alternative to visiting the emergency department.
Studies evaluating the impact of extended out-of-hours services on emergency department
visits are sparse. In a systematic review, Ismail et al. (2013) found limited and mixed evidence:
studies used before-after analysis and, hence, lacked a comparator, and focus has been on out-
of-hours urgent primary care visits rather than pre-booked appointments [8]. In several obser-
vational studies in England, patients with better access to primary care (typically defined in the
studies as the availability of an appointment within 48 h) have been found to have lower

 hospital admissions, though these studies have been condition-specific, restricting generalisa-
bility to the general population [9–14]. Cowling et al. (2015) highlight the need for more robust
analyses on the effects of improving access to primary care on the use of other services, out-
comes, and costs [4].
We investigated the association between extending opening hours in primary care and
emergency department visits for minor conditions, using hospital administrative data to com-
pare populations in practices that did and did not extend open hours.
Methods
Ethical approval was not required for this study since the study was an evaluation of routine
emergency department service use with non-randomisation in process or to allocation to treat-
ment. Data received for the analyses were de-identified.
In the UK, primary care practices usually provide routine and urgent (same-day) appoint-
ments between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 6:30 P.M., Monday to Friday. Outside these times,
patients with urgent problems can access “out-of-hours” services provided outside of general
practice, which include urgent assessment by a doctor if required.
In 2014, NHS England (part of the UK Department of Health, which plans and oversees
delivery of the English NHS) provided funding for a number of sites that would deliver innova-
tions in integrated care, use of technology, and extended access to primary care. Invitations to
bid for funding were sent to all practices in Greater Manchester. Eighteen schemes were sub-
mitted, each varied in the number of practices involved as part of the scheme and with the
involvement of primary care organisations (Clinical Commissioning Groups [CCGs] responsi-
ble for commissioning health care services for their local population of around 200–300,000
people). The formation of practices within schemes was self-determined by practices, but in
some instances was determined by the CCG. A panel including the Chief Executive of NHS
England Greater Manchester, a senior commissioner, an integrated care lead, and senior medi-
cal and nursing staff reviewed each scheme.
Six schemes were successful in obtaining funding totalling £4.1 million (US$6.3/€5.6 mil-
lion). Our analysis concerns four schemes that focused on extending opening hours in primary
care, the four schemes received total funding of £3.1 million (US$4.7/€4.3 million). These
schemes offered a combination of additional urgent and routine GP appointments of between
10 and 15 min, in the evenings Monday to Friday (approximately 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.) and on both
days of the weekend (see Table 1 for specific details). The additional appointments were acces-
sible both to patients requesting an urgent appointment and to those for whom booking an
evening or weekend appointment was more convenient.
The schemes varied considerably in cost and in scale; the largest served a population of over
200,000—almost four times the size of the next largest. An average of approximately 35 addi-
tional hours of appointments were available per scheme per week (ranging from 14–60 h per
week). The schemes also varied in their workforce arrangements, with two using a combination
of local GPs and locums, and two contracting with the local “out-of-hours” provider. All four
schemes received funding for extended access from December 2013. In total there were 10.25
additional appointments per 1,000 registered patients available in January 2014; the number of
additional appointments remained fairly constant over the year with 10.22 additional appoint-
ments per 1,000 patients available in December 2014 (Fig 1).
We used existing hospital administrative data for analysis. This data has complete popula-
tion coverage for all emergency department visits. Walk-in centre activity was excluded since
the data is incomplete for this activity. Data are coded as to type of referral (e.g., patient-initi-
ated, provider-initiated) and problem intensity (“minor,” “standard,” “high,” see Table 2 for

 details). All statistical analysis was carried out using the statistical package Stata (version 13).
Our analysis uses data for Greater Manchester, which has the benefit of enabling comparisons
to practices within the same environment and with similar practice populations.
Our principal analysis concerns patient-initiated visits to emergency departments for
“minor” problems. This measure was chosen as increasing primary care open hours is most
likely to impact on problems that could be adequately managed in primary care. We conduct
secondary analysis for total emergency department visits and also report data on other referral
types (e.g., referrals from primary care) to assess whether the intervention affects referral pat-
terns and “standard” and “high” intensity visits.
The proposal contains a range of proposed analyses (S1 Text). Unlike a standard trial with
accompanying protocol, the evaluation needed to be responsive to what was an exploratory
and time-limited pilot scheme. The bids that were initially submitted by each scheme contained
many services to be piloted and many outcomes that were the proposed target of these services.
This included not only extending the hours that primary care services could be made available
but also extending the range of services on offer; for example, extended diagnostic services or
specialist outreach clinics for long-term conditions. Within the first few months of the funding,
each scheme narrowed its focus substantially, so that in the four schemes in question, establish-
ing an extended hours service became the main focus and plans for extending the range of ser-
vices were dropped. This then meant that the outcomes that might have been associated with
these services (including hospital admissions and emergency department use for more severe
health conditions) were also dropped. This meant the only feasible impact the pilot schemes
could have on secondary care was minor attendance.

 In total we have data on emergency department visits covering 2,942,354 patients from 525
primary care practices in Greater Manchester from 2011_2014. Fifty-six practices (10.7%, with
346,024 patients) participated in one of the four schemes offering extended opening hours dur-
ing the intervention period. Secondary Uses Service (SUS) Payment by Results data for Acci-
dent and Emergency services were provided by the North West Commissioning Support Unit
through NHS England. The data were provided at the patient level and aggregated to primary
care practices, coded as either intervention practices (offering extended opening hours) or
comparator practices (offering routine opening hours and excluding practices involved in one
of the two funded schemes with no additional appointments). The data do not allow us to
assess whether patients visited primary care before attending the emergency department unless
they were referred to the emergency department by the primary care practitioner (“GP-refer-
ral”). Emergency department use was measured quarterly per 1,000 registered practice popula-
tion. We assessed the effects of the intervention on costs of emergency department services by
applying standard Payment by Results tariffs for financial year 2013/14 for each type of use. A
single (2013/14) tariff was applied to all periods to ensure variations in costed activity over the
period reflected activity changes rather than unit cost fluctuations.
Principal Analysis
Relative differences in emergency department visits per 1,000 registered population between
intervention practice and comparators before (2011–2013) and after (2014) the intervention
were estimated using regression analysis of difference-in-differences [15]. We tested for statisti-
cally significant differences in emergency department use between intervention and compara-
tor using an interaction term for intervention with a binary indicator for the intervention
period. The interaction term gives the relative (“risk”) difference in emergency department use
for the intervention practices (the change in use over time beyond the change observed in the
comparison group—the “difference in differences”).
Estimation was made using Ordinary Least Squares regressions with 525 practice level
binary indicators (practice fixed-effects) and 15 time quarter indicators (time fixed-effects).
The practice fixed-effects control for any time-invariant confounding in emergency depart-
ment use between practices that may be associated with the intervention (for example, if inter-
vention practices have higher or lower number of emergency department visits generally).
Time fixed-effects control for any temporal fluctuations (such as seasonal effects) in emergency
department use from the general trend. Standard errors were corrected for heteroscedasticity
to account for potential heterogeneity in the error term (which can result in the variance of
estimates being biased and hence biases statistical inference).
Absolute risk/difference in 2014 was obtained by applying the estimated percentage point
reduction to the average rate of attendances per 1,000 and multiplied by four (quarters) and
the population size (divided by 1,000).
Confounding
To be unbiased, the difference-in-differences approach makes several assumptions [16,17].
First, there should be no confounding due to selection into intervention. Second, both interven-
tion and comparator practices should demonstrate similar trends in emergency department
use over time prior to the intervention.
Confounding due to selection is a concern as primary care practices may self-select into the
intervention. The use of primary care practice fixed-effects removes some of the potential con-
founding due to self-selection; namely, the fixed-effects approach accounts for time-invariant
characteristics of practices that may account for historic differences in the outcome between

 intervention and comparators. Residual confounding may still occur should historic differ-
ences not fully identify whether the patients or practitioners in intervention practices are
more or less likely to embrace the intervention than patients or practitioners in comparator
practices.
To account for potential selection into the intervention group and minimize the derived
bias in the estimated impact, we match intervention practices to comparator practices via pro-
pensity score matching so that, conditional on observable differences between comparator
and intervention groups, the propensity of treatment is similar for both groups. Potential out-
comes under these matched groups are then independent of treatment assignment conditional
on the observable differences [18]. This conditional independence of treatment assignment is
useful in observational studies in which treatment allocation is non-random and can be
viewed as an approach that seeks to replicate random assignment in conventional randomised
controlled trials.
We estimated the propensity to be in the intervention group via a probit model of inter-
vention group membership against observed practice covariates hypothesised to relate to
intervention assignment and the outcome (emergency department use) but not affected
themselves by the intervention. The covariates used include practice practitioner characteris-
tics (age, gender, country of qualification, and the size of registered patients per practitioner)
and practice patient characteristics (age, gender, deprivation, and limited long-standing ill-
ness). Data on practice practitioner characteristics were derived from data from the Health
and Social Care Information Centre on registered practitioners [19] and data on patient char-
acteristics from the General Practice Patient Survey, a national sample survey used with all
English primary care practices, and weighted to produce representative samples of practice
populations [20]. The practice, practitioner, and patient characteristics may influence the rel-
ative volume and type of emergency hospital use, and may result in different responses to the
intervention of extended access. On the one hand, practitioner’s motivation to provide
extended appointments may vary with the gender, age, and ethnicity of practitioners and may
be influenced by the current strains on appointments and the culture within the practice. On
the other hand, the demand and subsequent uptake of extended access appointments may be
hypothesised to be correlated with the age, gender, deprivation, and need structure of a prac-
tice’s patient base.
We excluded practices outside the common support (overlapping propensity scores) from
both intervention and comparator groups. We constructed our matched comparator and inter-
vention groups under a variety of matching strategies: a) nearest neighbour with replacement
(whereby each intervention practice is matched to n comparator practices based on propensity
score closest proximity) [18]; b) radius matching (whereby each intervention practice is
matched to all comparator practices where the propensity score falls within a given radius)
[21]; c) kernel weighting (whereby all comparator practices within a bandwidth are matched to
the intervention practice but weighted in relation to the distance in propensity score) [22]; d)
all comparator practices under the common support range (whereby all comparator practices
have equal weight but must fall under the common support); and e) the top 25% of comparator
practices under common support (whereby only those comparator practices in the top quartile
of ranked propensity score are matched to the intervention practices) [23]. Among the
matched comparator and intervention groups identified with each strategy, we selected the one
that best meets the acceptability criteria of covariate balance. Covariate balance was assessed
via standardised differences (bias) and variance ratios. All propensity score matching was con-
ducted using psmatch2 in Stata [24].
Confounding may also arise should either the intervention or comparator practices have
existing access outside of core hours. We are unable to identify the extent of existing access

 outside of core hours over the period studied, but as the scheme extended existing hours of pri-
mary care access, our results can be considered as a conservative estimate of the impact
extended access has on emergency department use.
The assumption of similarity of trends was tested on the matched sample by estimating a
linear time trend interacted with the intervention dummy in the pre-intervention period. This
was performed separately for each type of emergency department use modelled. Where diver-
gent time trends are observed, the difference-in-differences analysis may be biased since the
estimated difference may be reflective of differences in trends of the outcome variable.
All variables were transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation which can
be interpreted roughly as percentage changes. This is similar to the logarithmic transformation
but can be used when the dependent variable takes zero values [25].
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted additional analyses to assess the robustness of our results:
1. Total attendance: We estimated effects on total emergency department use, excluding those
patients eventually admitted to hospital (since these could be judged as “appropriate” use of
emergency department).
2. 6-mo intervals: We estimated effects at 6-mo intervals to see if the effects of the intervention
were more apparent in later time periods after introduction of the intervention.
3. Regression to the mean: To assess whether our results are subject to bias caused by regres-
sion to the mean (representing random fluctuations around a long-run average), we repli-
cate our models with baseline emergency department use included; as this is time invariant
this removes the potential to include practice fixed-effects.
4. Equal pre- and post-intervention comparisons: We estimate the model using only 2013
quarters as the pre-intervention period. This approach compares pre- and post-intervention
periods close to the intervention start; in the current context this could be 1 y pre- (2013)
and 1 y post-intervention (2014).
5. Model specification: The log-linear approach taken assumes a normal distribution in the
error term, which is unlikely to hold under count data. We estimate negative binomial mod-
els to see whether our results were robust to model specification.
6. Unmatched sample with time-trend adjustment: As an alternative to matching, we esti-
mated effects on the unmatched sample including all practices in Greater Manchester.
Where the difference in trends between intervention and comparators was statistically sig-
nificant, we predicted emergency department use by extrapolating the time trend in the pre-
intervention period to the intervention period. Time-trend adjusted emergency department
use was then calculated as the difference between actual and predicted use at each time
point and used as the outcome of interest. This approach controls for the part of the esti-
mated effect of the intervention that is due to differences in trends before the intervention
under the assumption that practices would have continued along their pre-intervention
trends, and has been used in previous health research [26,27].
A number of changes to the analysis plan were made during the peer review process, includ-
ing the addition of propensity score matching to address imbalance and reduce the potential
for divergent time trends; the inclusion of practice characteristics in comparisons of matches
between practices; and suggestions for sensitivity analysis regarding equal pre- and post-peri-
ods and investigations of modelling negative binomial models as opposed to linear models.

 Results
There were 51,465 additional appointments provided by the intervention during the extended
opening hours (152 appointments per 1,000 population). Numbers of additional appointments
varied between the intervention practices, from 10/1,000/month to 40/1,000/month. In total,
65.1% (33,519/51,465) of additional appointments were used, with an increase over time (see
Fig 2), perhaps reflecting the gradual embedding of the service and increased patient
awareness.
Matching
Assessing the quality of the matched samples requires consideration of the similarity across the
comparator and intervention (treated) group in both the standardised differences and variance
of the observed covariates and propensity scores. Student’s t tests of equivalent covariates are
uninformative due to issues of reduced sample size; a joint test of the significance of all
observed covariates may highlight imbalance but is also suspect to this reduced sample con-
cern. Austin (2009) recommends that comparisons between unmatched and matched samples
be made on the basis of standardised differences and relative variances of both the covariates
and propensity score since these are not sensitive to sample size [28]. This ensures the compar-
ator and intervention groups are similar both in the mean of the covariates and the distribution
of these covariates in addition to the overall propensity score. Equivalent control and interven-
tion groups would have similar means (a low percentage bias) and ratios of variances close to
unity. Rubin (2001) provides recommendations on the diagnostic criteria of the propensity

 score, recommending that the absolute standardised difference of the means of the linear index
of the propensity score between the comparator and intervention (treated) group is below 25%
[29]. Rubin (2001) also recommends that the variance ratio of the propensity score lies between
0.5 and 2 at the extremes.
Diagnostic results for a range of matching procedures are reported in S1 Table. All matching
was conducted under common support of the propensity score; one comparator practice lay
outside the range of common support. Although balance in the observed covariates and accept-
able variance ratios were generally met across each procedure, the acceptable percentage bias of
less than 25% was only met by the kernel matching procedure using the epanechnikov kernel
and bandwidth 0.06. Our analysis was therefore conducted on the kernel matched sample. The
percentage bias for each covariate under the unmatched and matched sample using kernel
matching are reported in S2 Table. The percentage bias in the matched and unmatched sam-
ples are plotted in S1 Fig.
Kernel matching generates weights for comparator practices that are determined by the dis-
tance in propensity scores to intervention practices. We weight the difference-in-differences
models using the kernel weights generated by the propensity score model. Since the weights
used in the regression models are based on propensity scores (predicted values) there are con-
cerns over the validity of the standard errors [30]. Abadie and Imbens (2008) note that unlike
nearest-neighbour matching (which matches a finite, restricted number of comparators to
intervention practices), the number of matches increase with sample size under kernel match-
ing; under these circumstances bootstrapping is likely to generate valid inference [31]. Standard
errors in each model were obtained using bootstrapping with 1,000 replications simultaneously
over both the propensity model and the difference-in-differences model.
Principal analysis
Table 3 and Fig 3 report the pre- and post-period emergency department use for each outcome
measure. On average, there were approximately 95 attendances at emergency departments per
1,000 per quarter, with approximately half being for “minor” problems, and patient-initiated
use making up the largest proportion.
Table 3 provides average pre- and post-intervention observed attendance, an estimate of the
difference in time trends between matched comparator and intervention practices in the pre-
intervention period, and the difference-in-differences estimates. Statistically significant differ-
ences in pre-intervention trends between comparator and intervention practices were found
for standard intensity, patient-initiated, other, and missing referrals attendance. For these, the
difference-in-differences estimate is biased and inference should not be made on these esti-
mated effects (denoted by ^ in Table 3). Intervention practices demonstrated a 26.4% relative
reduction in patient-initiated referrals to emergency departments for “minor” problems (95%
confidence interval [CI] -38.6% to -14.2%; absolute risk/difference: -10,933 per year, 95% CI
-15,995 to -5,866), which in turn led to a 26.6% relative reduction in the costs of patient-initi-
ated referrals for “minor” problems (95% CI -39.2% to -14.1%; absolute difference: -£767,976,
95% CI -£1,130,767 to -£405,184) (-US$1,173,890 [95% CI -US$1,728,434, to -US$619,344];
-€1,057,426 [95% CI -€1,556,953 to -€557,898]). There was an insignificant relative reduction
of 3.1% in total emergency department use (95% CI -6.4% to 0.2%; absolute difference: -3,901,
95% CI -8,094 to 304).
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted additional analyses to assess the robustness of our results:

 1. Total attendance: Admission to hospital following an emergency department visit might
indicate that the patient’s condition would not have been treatable in primary care. After
excluding those patients from the sample, we continue to find no significant change in total
emergency department use between comparator and intervention practices (S3 Table).
2. 6 mo intervals: The effects of the intervention were similar in January–June (immediate
post intervention) and July–December (6–12 mo post intervention), but the effects were
slightly larger in the latter half of the intervention period (S4 Table).

 3. Regression to the mean: Our results on the main variables of interest were robust to the
inclusion of baseline emergency department use (S5 Table). This suggests our main results
are not reflective of random fluctuations around a long-run average.
4. Equal pre- and post-intervention comparisons: Our results on the main variables of interest
were robust where only 2013 was modelled for the pre-intervention period though the mag-
nitude of reduced minor patient-initiated attendances (total and minor attendances) is
lower (higher and now significant) (S6 Table). This suggests our main results for minor
patient-initiated attendances are not substantively sensitive to the pre-period analysed.
5. Model specification: Our fifth analysis concerned the modelling approach taken. We find
our main variables of interest were statistically and economically robust to the use of either
a negative binomial or log-linear estimation approach (S7 Table). Where differences were
observed, these were for measures with rates of attendances close to zero.
6. Unmatched sample with time-trend adjustment: Our final sensitivity check estimated the
effects of the intervention on the unmatched sample. Where time trends were evident, atten-
dance was adjusted via the removal of the trend for both comparator and intervention
groups. In the unmatched sample a significant difference in trends for several outcome mea-
sures in the pre-intervention period was identified between comparator and intervention
groups (S8 Table). Adjusting for these, we find a smaller reduction in patient-initiated
minor attendances.

 Discussion
Principal Findings
In Greater Manchester, primary care practices that extended opening hours demonstrated a
26.4% reduction in patient-initiated referrals to the emergency department with minor prob-
lems. The pattern of results (with an impact mainly on emergency department use for minor
problems) suggests that the decrease was related to the intervention. The overall impact was
robust to choice of comparators and other sensitivity analyses.
The absolute decrease in emergency department use we found is lower than the number of
new out-of-hours appointments booked; the ratio of additional appointments to emergency
attendances avoided is approximately 3:1 (33,159 appointments booked compared to 10,933
reduced patient-initiated referrals to emergency departments).
Our findings add to a sparse literature that has investigated whether extending access to
routine primary care appointments is associated with lower emergency department use. Most
studies assess extended access via the introduction of out-of-hours urgent care centres or tele-
phone triage systems and have suffered from a lack of comparator. No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest these services reduce emergency department use [8]. In general there
was a noted lack of high-quality evidence to assess the associations of interventions that may
reduce emergency department use. One study that is directly relevant to our study evaluated
emergency department use for a group of practices with available weekend primary care
appointments [32]. This study conducted a controlled before and after analysis finding simi-
larly large reductions in emergency department attendance. Unlike our study, however, there
was no control population without access to weekend appointments. The authors’ control
group were those practices who did not host the appointments at weekends (but whose patients
could access these services); this is more in line with addressing the question regarding how
7-day services should be delivered in primary care rather than whether introducing these ser-
vices may reduce emergency department use. The authors did not consider the role of patient
self-referral to emergency department use; this was a leading component in our analyses. Fur-
thermore, the study was based on a relatively smaller population of 34 practices (four hosting
the weekend appointments and 30 not hosting the appointments) covering 190,000 patients
within central London, whilst our study covered a larger population of 525 practices with
2,960,354 registered patients over a wider sociodemographically diverse area.
Strengths and Weaknesses
Our analytic design is suited to the evaluation of rapid, large scale policy interventions, such as
the introduction of financial incentives or new service innovations [26,27,33,34] Nevertheless,
such designs have a number of limitations compared to a formal trial, especially in (a) control-
ling for confounding, (b) comprehensive assessment of outcomes, and (c) standardisation of
the intervention. We explore each of these issues below.
Despite efforts to control for selection outlined in the methods, it is not possible to be
entirely sure that other “unmeasured” confounders were not present. The quality of the match-
ing in the propensity score matching process is only as good as the ability to capture all differ-
ences between the intervention and comparator groups that affect treatment propensity and
outcomes. Although few covariates in the propensity model were significantly different in the
unmatched sample, the standardised differences (S2 Table) revealed large percentage bias. We
were able to reduce the percentage bias of the model to an acceptable level of below 25%, but
this is only valid for those covariates we were able to observe. The intervention and comparator
groups exist within the same local environment which may mitigate the potential for

 unobservable macro-level differences and population differences. Should populations have
changed over the period then residual confounding could be an issue. Further confounding
could occur should there be differences occurring within the study period that differentially
impact on emergency department use for intervention and comparator practices.
Although we explored costs, formal cost-effectiveness analysis requires detailed information
on both costs and outcomes. In terms of outcomes, no data were collected on patient health
outcomes. Health benefits may accrue due to extended access to “out-of-hours” primary care
or via better timeliness of care; alternatively, benefits may not accrue should extended access
result in substitution of appointments during routine open hours. The analysis could also not
account for any additional benefits which may accrue to hospitals from reductions in emer-
gency department use: for example, the lower concentration of use for minor problems may
benefit the workflow of hospital providers. The lack of health outcomes limits an assessment of
cost-effectiveness to a crude incremental cost approach based on the assumption that health
benefits remain the same in both comparator and intervention practices. Taking the perspec-
tive of NHS and social care, the funding provided to the intervention practices was £3.1 million
(US$4.7/€4.3 million). We find the intervention led to a cost reduction in emergency depart-
ment use of £767,976 (US$1,173,890; €1,057,426), the incremental cost is therefore £2.3 million
(US$3.5/€3.2 million). The intervention would therefore need to see significant health gains to
be cost-effective. The evaluation was unable to disentangle set-up costs from running costs of
extended hours, which may over-estimate the long-run cost of the scheme. Further research
into whether the intervention is cost-effective and sustainable is required.
The implementation of the intervention was not standardised or delivered to a protocol, as
in a conventional trial. The exact model of extended opening hours varied between the schemes
(see Table 1), and appointment availability varied over the duration of the study. The funding
provided to the schemes also supported other activities in some sites, which may have influ-
enced outcomes. Nevertheless, there was reasonable commonality to the extension of opening
hours provided in sites.
Data reporting could bias our results. There were 4,318,043 emergency department visits
throughout the period (2011 quarter 2 to 2014 quarter 4). Of these, 13,792 (0.32%) had no
valid practice code, and all had a valid date assigned, suggesting missing administrative data
would have a negligible impact on our findings. Patients registered with a Greater Manchester
practice could utilise services anywhere throughout the United Kingdom either due to movers
having not registered with a new practice or due to the location of the patient at the time treat-
ment was needed. The former is potentially problematic as the patient may not be able to use
enhanced access for geographic reasons when needed. Emergency department use was mea-
sured for all patients registered with a Greater Manchester practice regardless of whether the
emergency department was situated within Greater Manchester or not. Approximately 96% of
emergency department visits were at departments situated within or on the border of Greater
Manchester suggesting the effects of patients registered with intervention practices but not geo-
graphically able to use extended access is minimal. Finally, should reporting quality vary
between hospitals, the difference-in-differences approach removes such bias provided these
differences are time invariant.
Possible Mechanisms and Explanations
Similar to conventional trials of “complex interventions,” we carried out a detailed process
evaluation, which is described below.
The process evaluation explored implementation of the intervention, potential mechanisms
of effect, and issues that might impact on implementation of similar schemes [35]. While the

 different intervention practices were comparable in their main objectives and delivery, they
varied in scale and workforce arrangements (Table 1). This scope was reflected in costs of just
over £1.1 million (US$1.7/€1.5 million) for the largest scheme for 2014, roughly equivalent to
the three other intervention schemes combined, although it should be noted that the scale of
the service meant that the extra provision was diluted to a degree, and provided the fewest
appointments per 1,000 population. The scope of the scheme also raised other challenges, as
the CCG struggled to engage all local practices in the area, resulting in potential inequalities of
access.
The mechanisms by which access is improved are complex, depending on increased avail-
ability, affordability, and acceptability [36,37]. Extending open hours seeks to both expand
availability and better align the “fit” between the system (i.e., time of day practices are open)
and individuals (when patients need to access services). Although affordability is generally not
an issue in the NHS, acceptability may limit the impact of improvements in availability. For
example, use of professionals other than a patient’s usual primary care provider may adversely
affect continuity of care. Acceptability of evening and weekend appointments among patients
may also be a barrier. Our data suggest that the new services were not initially being used to
capacity, and their impact may increase over time as awareness of and trust in the new service
increases among patients, assuming such services can be made acceptable. The impact of
extended access to out-of-hours primary care may be further improved by better “vertical”
integration with hospital services.
In terms of workforce, two intervention CCGs used local staff (existing practitioner part-
ners, salaried practitioners, and locality-based locums), while two contracted out with a local
out-of-hours provider. Although care must be taken in assuming causal relationships, local
staffing was associated with higher uptake of appointments. However, the workload increase
for these local staff was substantial, which might threaten long-term sustainability.
Implications
The international evidence on the effects of improved access to primary care on emergency
department use is inconclusive, has rarely analysed cost data, and has lacked robust compara-
tors [4]. Our study uses more robust methods and suggests that extending opening hours in
primary care may be a useful addition to policies aiming to reduce pressures on hospital ser-
vices, potentially reducing patient-initiated use of the emergency department for minor prob-
lems—but at a significant cost. Evidence on health outcomes is needed to address whether such
schemes are cost-effective, this requires future evaluations to record health-related outcome
data and a more comprehensive recording of costs of the intervention. The long-term effects of
additional appointments and an assessment of the robustness of this study’s findings in other
settings are fruitful avenues for further research. Future schemes would ideally be conducted
and evaluated using more robust randomised designs [38]. Such schemes may involve greater
costs of implementation, in the absence of such finance our approach provides guidance on the
evaluation of future schemes where random allocation is not available.
