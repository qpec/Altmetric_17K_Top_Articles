Purpose: The World Health Organization recommends the initiation of opioid agonists prior to 
release from incarceration to prevent relapse or overdose. Many countries in the world employ 
these strategies. This paper considers the evidence to support these recommendations and the 
factors that have slowed their adoption in the US.
Methods: We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal/observational 
studies that examine participant outcomes associated with the initiation or continuation of opioid 
agonists (methadone, buprenorphine) or antagonists (naltrexone) during incarceration. Papers 
were identified through a literature search of PubMed with an examination of their references and 
were included if they reported outcomes for methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone continued 
during incarceration or initiated prior to release in a correctional institution.
Results: Fourteen studies were identified, including eight RCTs and six observational studies. 
One RCT found that patients treated with methadone who were continued on versus tapered off 
methadone during brief incarceration were more likely to return to treatment upon release. A 
second RCT found that the group starting methadone treatment in prison versus a waiting list 
was less likely to report using heroin and sharing syringes during incarceration. A third RCT 
found no differences in postrelease heroin use or reincarceration between individuals initiating 
treatment with methadone versus those initiating treatment with buprenorphine during relatively 
brief incarcerations. Findings from four additional RCTs indicate that starting opioid agonist 
treatment during incarceration versus after release was associated with higher rates of entry into 
community treatment and reduced heroin use. Finally, one pilot RCT showed that providing 
extended-release naltrexone prior to discharge resulted in significantly lower rates of opioid 
relapse compared to no medication.
Conclusion: Reasons why uptake of these pharmacotherapies is limited in the US and relatively 
widespread in Europe are discussed. Recommendations for future research are outlined.
Keywords: methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, heroin, corrections, incarceration
Introduction
Incarceration is a relatively common experience among the estimated 15.6 million 
opioid-dependent adults in the world.1 In the US, it has been estimated that between 
24% and 36% of opioid-dependent adults cycle in and out of jails each year.2,3 Incar-
ceration of these individuals often results in opioid withdrawal syndrome, which, at a 
minimum, should be treated humanely.1,4 Beyond safe and effective opioid withdrawal 
treatment, there are three major opportunities to provide effective pharmacotherapy to 
inmates. First, inmates receiving opioid pharmacotherapy with either opioid agonists 
(eg, methadone or buprenorphine) or antagonists (naltrexone) in the community could

be continued on their medications during brief incarceration. 
Second, inmates who experience withdrawal and who are 
either out of treatment at the time of incarceration or using 
contraband opioids during incarceration could be started and 
maintained on opioid pharmacotherapy. Finally, abstinent 
inmates with a long history of opioid dependence prior to 
incarceration and who are no longer physiologically depen-
dent on opioids could be started on opioid agonist therapy 
(OAT) with either methadone or buprenorphine, or on the 
opioid antagonist extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) 
prior to discharge. Thus, incarceration presents a potentially 
important event for identifying and treating opioid-dependent 
adults.
Based on the principle that individuals should have access to 
the same treatment options during incarceration as those options 
available to them in the community, the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) recommends that, at minimum, either methadone 
or buprenorphine should be made available to prisoners for 
maintenance treatment and opioid detoxification.1 The WHO 
also recommends that if countries can afford it, methadone, 
buprenorphine, and naltrexone should all be available to pris-
oners. While policies and practices regarding the use of these 
medications during incarceration vary from country to country, 
they are rarely used during incarceration in the US.5–7 In contrast, 
Canadian federal prisons can initiate methadone maintenance 
regardless of whether inmates were in community treatment 
prior to incarceration.8 Many nations in the European Union 
(EU) make methadone and/or buprenorphine available in jails 
and prisons.9,10 Methadone is also available to prisoners in Aus-
tralia, the People’
s Republic of China, Iran, and elsewhere.11,12 
However, in the US, Rikers Island Jail in New 
Y
ork City is one of 
the few jails that will initiate methadone treatment for individuals 
who were not receiving treatment in the community. This jail, 
along with others in Albuquerque (NM), New Haven (CT), and 
Baltimore (MD), is among the relatively few that will continue 
methadone treatment for detainees who were in community-
based treatment at the time of arrest. A growing number of US 
jails and prisons are making XR-NTX available.13 This long-
acting injectable medication, which provides a blockade against 
the effects of opioids for ∼1 month, can be administered just 
prior to release for individuals who are abstinent from opioids 
for a period of approximately 1 week.
Initiation of opioid pharmacotherapy during incarceration 
could play an important role in safeguarding both individual 
and public health, and safety, given the high financial cost of 
opioid dependence,14 high post-release relapse rates,15 drug 
injection, human immunovirus (HIV) risk,16 and overdose 
death of newly released inmates.17 Despite the fact that in 
the late 1960s, the US was the first country to adopt wide-
scale use of methadone treatment in the community and to 
have a random assignment trial of methadone treatment in a 
jail,18 it lags behind many countries in the developed world in 
providing adequate pharmacotherapeutic treatment of opioid 
use disorder and in implementing opioid pharmacotherapies 
during incarceration.19 The purpose of this paper is to provide 
a review of the extant peer-reviewed publications on the use 
of pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence in correctional 
institutions in order to update a prior such review of opioid 
agonist treatments,20 to discuss reasons that might explain 
why the US has not widely adopted this approach, and to 
propose future research directions.
Methods
Inclusion criteria for this review were English language 
peer-reviewed publications of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) or observational studies (included due to the small 
number of RCTs) with results of initiating or continuing an 
opioid agonist or antagonist treatment during incarceration 
for adults ages 18 years and older.
An electronic search was conducted in PubMed using 
the search terms “methadone initiation in jail,” “methadone 
initiation in prison,” “buprenorphine initiation in jail,” 
“buprenorphine initiation in prison,” “naltrexone initiation 
in jail,” “naltrexone initiation in prison,” “methadone jail,” 
“buprenorphine jail,” “naltrexone jail,” “methadone prison,” 
“buprenorphine prison,” and “naltrexone prison” yielding 
287 publications. Papers were only included if they were 
published in English and if they assessed the initiation or 
continuation of opioid agonist or antagonist pharmacotherapy 
in a correctional setting. The final literature search was 
conducted in the summer of 2015, of which the findings are 
reported herein. The lead author read the title and abstract 
to ascertain whether the study fits the focus of this paper. 
Papers that clearly did not pertain to the subject matter or that 
did not report the results of original research (eg, literature 
review, thought pieces, or papers that dealt exclusively with 
outpatient data) were immediately excluded, although biblio-
graphies of such papers were examined in order to ensure 
that all relevant studies were found. The remaining papers 
were obtained and thoroughly read in order to determine if 
they met criteria for inclusion in this review. A total of ten 
RCTs were found through this literature search. One RCT 
found in the literature search was excluded from this report 
because it examined naltrexone implants,21 which are only 
approved for use in Russia where opioid agonist medications 
are not permitted in the community, and hence, its findings

Research review on opioid pharmacotherapy in jails and prisons
would not be of widespread use at this time. A second RCT 
that was conducted by our group with levo-alpha acetyl-
methadol was excluded because this medication is no longer 
available.22 Thus, a total of eight RCTs were included in this 
review. In addition, there were six longitudinal studies that 
were identified.
Studies were categorized according to whether medica-
tions were 1) continued from treatment in the community, 
2) initiated during opioid withdrawal for opioid agonist 
maintenance treatment, or 3) initiated after withdrawal was 
completed for the prevention of relapse. Within these three 
categories, reports were further divided between RCTs and 
observational reports and listed chronologically. Studies 
were summarized by listing their 1) setting, 2) sample size, 
3) study arms, 4) participants’ sex, 5) average age of par-
ticipants, 6) participants’ race/ethnicity, and 7) follow-up 
time frame. As available, outcomes for each of these studies 
were categorized based on 1) percentage of participants who 
entered assigned treatment post release, 2) reincarcerations, 
3) self-reported opioid misuse post release, 4) injection 
drug use post release, 5) retention in treatment, and 6) study 
limitations.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the demographics of each study’s par-
ticipants included in this review. Table 2 summarizes the 
primary outcomes of these studies.
Continuing methadone maintenance 
treatment for patients enrolled in such 
treatment in the community at the time 
of arrest
Rich et al23 completed an RCT in Rhode Island, USA, 
between 2011 and 2013 that compared methadone con-
tinuation for individuals enrolled in methadone maintenance 
treatment (MMT) at the time of arrest versus a forced, 
relatively slow, methadone dose taper during incarceration. 
There were a total of 223 participants randomized to either 
methadone continuation (n=114) or forced methadone dose 
taper (n=109). Males comprised 78% of the sample, 81% of 
participants were Caucasian, and the mean age was 34 years 
(standard deviation [SD] =8.4). Participant data were gath-
ered at 1-month post release with an 88% follow-up interview 
rate. At follow-up, 106 (96%) of the methadone continuation 
group had reentered treatment, compared to 68 (78%) of 
the forced dose taper group (P=0.001). Twelve participants 
(11%) from the methadone continuation group and eight 
(9%) from the forced dose taper group were reincarcerated. 
The proportion of participants reporting opioid use at the 
1-month follow-up was more than twice as high in the forced 
taper group compared to the continuation group (16 [18%] vs 
9 [8%], respectively; P=0.033). Similarly, 19 (17%) individu-
als in the methadone continuation group reported intravenous 
drug use at follow-up, compared to 28 (32%) in the forced 
taper group (P=0.016). Neither retention in treatment nor 
urine drug screening results were reported. While the results 
demonstrated the superiority of continuing methadone during 
incarceration, findings would likely have been even stronger 
had all of the members of the control group been completely 
withdrawn from medication by the time they were released, 
as is commonly the case in the US.
initiation of opioid agonist treatment for 
inmates out of treatment
Five papers describing studies of initiating opioid ago-
nist treatment with either methadone or buprenorphine 
were reviewed: two RCTs (Table 1) and three longitudinal 
studies.
Randomized clinical trials
In an Australian prison in New South Wales, Dolan et al 
conducted an RCT from August 1997 to October 1998 to 
determine whether methadone maintenance reduced heroin 
use, syringe sharing, and/or incidence of HIV or hepatitis C 
during incarceration.24 A total of 382 were randomized to 
either MMT (n=191) or a no-treatment control condition 
(n=191). The entire sample was male, and race/ethnic data 
were not reported. The average age of participants was 
27 years (SD =6). Follow-up interviews were conducted 
in prison, 4 months following baseline, with 253 (66.2%) 
participants (because some participants were released prior 
to follow-up). Compared to the control group, participants 
in the MMT group were significantly less likely to report 
heroin injection (32% vs 74%; P,0.001) and syringe sharing 
(20% vs 54%; P,0.001). However, there were no significant 
differences in opioid-positive hair test results (39 [31%] vs 
43 [37%] in the MMT and control groups, respectively). 
This study’s limitations included an all-male sample and 
no reported postrelease data by study condition. However, 
a subsequent 4-year follow-up report indicated that partici-
pants who were in methadone treatment in the community 
had a lower mortality rate than participants who were not 
enrolled in treatment.25
Magura et al26 published an RCT comparing the initia-
tion of methadone and buprenorphine treatment among jail 
inmates to compare their outcomes after release. Participants

Research review on opioid pharmacotherapy in jails and prisons
were enrolled between August 2006 and 2007 at the Rikers 
Island Jail’s methadone program, which was started in the 
mid-1980s in response to the HIV epidemic.27,28 Opioid-
dependent males who were not in treatment at the time of 
arrest were assigned using treatment-adaptive randomization 
to either buprenorphine or methadone treatment. A total of 
56 men were randomly assigned to and received methadone 
and 77 men were assigned to buprenorphine, of whom 60 
received their assigned medication. As shown in Table 1, the 
average age of the methadone and buprenorphine groups was 
40.7 years (SD =9.1) and 38.4 years (SD =7.9), respectively. 
Seven participants were terminated from treatment in jail for 
attempted medication diversion (six [10%] in the buprenor-
phine group and one [1.8%] in the methadone group). At 
3 months post release (Table 2), the buprenorphine group 
was significantly more likely than the methadone group to 
have entered their assigned postrelease treatment (48% vs 
14%; P,0.001). The buprenorphine and methadone groups 
did not differ significantly in terms of reincarceration rates 
(40% vs 50%, respectively) or any self-reported heroin use 
(53% vs 66%, respectively) at the 3-month follow-up. There 
were a number of limitations to this study, including no report 
of community treatment retention or urine drug screening. 
The sample was exclusively males, and there were acceptable 
follow-up rates (70%).
Longitudinal studies
Between November 1988 and April 1990 at Rikers Island 
Jail in New Y
ork City, Magura et al28 conducted the first 
longitudinal study of out-of-treatment jail inmates who were 
initiated on MMT. The study compared outcomes at a median 
of 6.5 months post release of a systematically selected cohort 
of 446 male and female patients starting methadone mainte-
nance (n=308) at Rikers Island to those of a second cohort 
that received methadone detoxification (n=138). Follow-up 
assessments were conducted with only 250 (56.1%) of the 
446 patients. The MMT group entered and were retained in 
methadone treatment at higher rates (85%) than the control 
group (37%) and reported higher rates of heroin abstinence 
post release (31% vs 22%, respectively). Study limitations 
included lack of random assignment, no urine drug screening, 
and low follow-up rates.
In France, buprenorphine can be prescribed by all phy-
sicians (including those working in prisons) as of 1996, 
and methadone has been available in prisons since 2002. 
A longitudinal study was conducted by Marzo et al29 in 
2003 and 2004 in 47 French remand prisons (where newly 
detained individuals are housed). This study examined

Research review on opioid pharmacotherapy in jails and prisons
3-year reincarceration rates of 507 male and female 
opioid-dependent inmates. Baseline data were obtained 
at admission, while 3-year follow-up reincarceration data 
were obtained through database searches. The majority of 
the sample was males (96.3%), the mean age of participants 
was 30.8 years (SD =6.4), 78% had a prior incarceration, 
54.1% had injected heroin in their lifetime, and 69.3% 
reported being on opioid agonist treatment in the month 
prior to incarceration. Opioid agonist pharmacotherapy was 
provided to 394 (77.7%) study participants. The reason(s) 
that the remainder of the sample did not receive medica-
tion was(were) not described. Maintenance treatment was 
started for 69 of 394 (17.5%) out-of-treatment individuals 
at the time of incarceration and continued for 324 of 394 
(82.2%) individuals who had been receiving such treatment 
at the time of incarceration. The majority of participants 
(73.6%) were treated with buprenorphine, and the remainder 
were treated with methadone. Of the 478 individuals who 
were subsequently released from prison, 238 (49.8%) were 
reincarcerated at least once during the 3-year follow-up 
period. Multivariate analysis found that a history of prior 
incarceration and benzodiazepine use within the month prior 
to the index incarceration, but not maintenance therapy, was 
associated with reincarceration. This study had a number 
of limitations, including the lack of participant interviews, 
urine drug screening, and postrelease treatment entry and 
retention data at follow-up.
Switzerland’s largest remand prison (located in Geneva) 
has been offering opioid agonist treatment for ∼20 years. 
Favrod-Coune et al30 retrospectively reported on the dosing 
practices and patient characteristics of this program. The 
mean age of the entire sample of current opioid users who 
were detained and awaiting trial between January 2007 and 
December 2007 (n=241) was 29.6 years (SD =7.1). Ethnicity 
was 28.9% Western European, 27.5% North African and 
Middle Eastern, 20.1% Sub-Saharan African, and 23.5% 
others. For this study, 233 inmates who used opioids and 
had complete data were identified, of whom 95.3% were 
males and 39.9% injected drugs. Of these individuals, 166 
(71.2%) were considered opioid dependent and treated with 
either methadone or buprenorphine. Approximately 20% had 
been receiving opioid agonist treatment in the community 
prior to incarceration. The only outcome data reported on the 
166 people who received OAT during incarceration were that 
49.7% received follow-up care in the community after their 
release. Of the 67 individuals who did not receive OAT during 
incarceration, only 19 (28.4%) received follow-up care in 
the community. This study had several limitations including

initiation of opioid agonist or antagonist 
for opioid abstinent inmates for 
postrelease relapse prevention
We identified seven publications regarding the initiation of 
opioid agonists or antagonists prior to release, including five 
RCTs and two longitudinal studies.
Randomized trials of opioid agonists
In a pioneering study, Dole et al18 sought to determine 
inmates’ level of interest in, and effectiveness of, initiat-
ing methadone maintenance prior to release from a New 
York City jail (Rikers Island). The inclusion criteria 
were having at least 5 years of heroin addiction, five or 
more prior convictions, and a scheduled release from jail 
between January 1, 1968, and April 30, 1968. Individuals 
were excluded if they were committed to the custody of 
the Addictions Service Agency. Of the 165 male inmates 
screened for participation, 116 (70%) applied for treat-
ment. As shown in Table 1, the study sample consisted 
of 32 men. Initially, 16 were randomly selected to begin 
methadone treatment ∼10 days prior to release; however, 
four from this group declined treatment. Another 16 who 
had an expressed interest in treatment (untreated controls) 
were placed on a waiting list for the 12-month duration 
of the study. Participants had a mean age of 30 years (SD 
=5.08) and were 31.3% African-American, 21.9% Puerto 
Rican, and 46.9% of European descent. Because the par-
ticipants were not physiologically dependent on opioids at 
the time of dose induction, methadone was started at only 
10 mg and was increased slowly to ∼35 mg by the time of 
release. No other services were provided during methadone 
treatment in jail. Outcome data obtained from methadone 
program records and follow-up interviews conducted at 
3-month intervals post release were examined between 
7 months and 10 months post release to determine self-
reported opioid use and whether they were rearrested at 
follow-up. Despite ten of 12 (83.3%) treated participants 
reporting having used heroin intermittently post release 
(Table 2), none of these 12 men reported readdiction (eg, 
regular daily use) to opioids. Three men in this group were 
reincarcerated. In contrast, 15 of 16 control participants 
became readdicted and reincarcerated, and the other was lost 
 
to follow-up. Three of the four individuals who refused treat-
ment became readdicted to opioids and were reincarcerated, 
and one was lost to follow-up. This study demonstrated that 
inmates had an interest in initiating methadone prior to 
release. It also demonstrated the potential utility of initiat-
ing methadone treatment prior to release in a population no 
longer physiologically dependent at the time of treatment 
initiation. The study had a number of limitations, including 
a small sample size and no urine drug screening.
A second RCT examining the initiation of MMT prior 
to release from prisoners recruited participants from 
September 2003 to June 2005 from a prison in Baltimore, 
MD, USA. Participants were 211 males with a history of 
heroin dependence who were not physiologically depen-
dent at the time of study enrollment.15 Participants were 
randomly assigned on a 1:1:1 basis to counseling only with 
a passive referral to treatment in the community/counseling 
with referral to guaranteed MMT entry in the community/
counseling with MMT in prison, with guaranteed MMT 
continuation in the community. Because participants were 
not opioid dependent at study entry, methadone treatment 
was started at a low dose (5 mg/d) that increased quite slowly 
at a rate of 5 mg/week to a target of 60 mg methadone daily. 
Follow-up interviews were conducted at 1 month, 3 months, 
6 months, and 12 months post release. By 1 month post 
release, there was a significant difference in community 
methadone treatment entry such that only 7.8% had entered 
treatment in the counseling only condition, compared to 50% 
in the counseling with postrelease referral to MMT in the 
community, and 68.6% in the counseling with methadone 
in prison condition (all Ps,0.05).31 Outcome data were 
obtained on 204 (96.7%) participants, although it was not 
possible to obtain 89 (43.6%) urine samples at follow-up. 
All participants were males with a mean age of 40.3 years 
(SD =7.1), and 69.6% were African-American and 24.0% 
were Caucasian. There was a significant difference between 
conditions of days in treatment during the year post release. 
The counseling only group had 23.1 days in treatment 
(SD =72.5), counseling with postrelease referral to MMT 
in the community had 91.3 days in treatment (SD =144.6), 
and counseling with methadone in prison had 166.0 days in 
treatment (SD =166.4; in all pairwise comparisons, P,0.01). 
Just over half of all participants were reincarcerated during 
the 1-year follow-up, with no significant differences between 
conditions. Both the counseling only (65.6%) and counseling 
in prison with postrelease referral to MMT in the community 
(48.7%) conditions had significantly higher rates of opioid-
positive urine tests at the 12-month follow-up compared to 
the counseling with methadone in prison condition (25%; 
P=0.001 and 0.008, respectively). This study had a number of 
limitations, including missing data for urine drug screening

Research review on opioid pharmacotherapy in jails and prisons
(43.6% of the samples were missing for a variety of reasons) 
and a male-only sample.
A third RCT was conducted by McKenzie et al32 to further 
examine the effectiveness of MMT prior to release among 
sentenced inmates with a history of opioid dependence who 
were not physiologically dependent on opioids. This study 
recruited participants between October 2006 and February 
2009 from the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, and 
randomly assigned 90 participants to 1) methadone initiation 
prior to release with short-term subsidized MMT in the com-
munity (12 weeks for free and 12 weeks for half price), 2) 
referral to MMT in the community with the same subsidy as 
group 1, or 3) referral to community MMT without subsidy. 
Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) inmates 18 years or older 
who had sentences of #2 years, 2) at least one prior MMT 
experience, 3) injection heroin use prior to incarceration or 
being on MMT prior to incarceration, 4) scheduled release 
date at least 28 days after study enrollment, 5) at least one 
prior drug-related incarceration, and 6) willingness to provide 
two verifiable contacts. Participants assigned to methadone 
initiation were not physiologically dependent at enrollment, 
and therefore, were started on a low dose of methadone 
(5 mg/day) that increased by 2 mg/d until reaching their indi-
vidualized target dose or their release from jail. The average 
dose of methadone at release was 33 mg (range: 5–38 mg/d). 
As shown in Table 1, participants (reported for only those 62 
[70%] who had completed a 6-month follow-up) had a mean 
age of 40.7 years (range: 22–58) and were 71% males, 72.5% 
whites, 6.4% others, and 21% Hispanics, and for 20.9%, race 
was not reported. During the course of the study, a grant to 
provide free treatment for all participants was obtained by 
Rhode Island, and the third study arm (treatment without 
subsidy) discontinued enrollment. Furthermore, some par-
ticipants assigned to group 1 were unable to start MMT prior 
to release and were offered methadone after release (thus, 
shifting to group 2). Because of these group “cross-overs,” 
the investigators, in addition to an intent-to-treat analysis, 
conducted an “as treated analysis” as shown in Table 2 to 
better reflect the outcomes of the actual services received 
rather than assigned. The group that initiated methadone 
prior to release compared to the other groups was significantly 
more likely to enter methadone treatment within 30 days of 
release (P,0.001), although 6-month treatment retention 
was not significantly different between the groups (Table 2). 
The group that initiated methadone in jail compared to the 
other groups reported lower rates of heroin use in the 30 days 
prior to the 6-month postrelease assessment (P=0.008). Two 
participants in the group assigned to begin methadone after 
release died of opioid overdose shortly after release. There are 
a number of limitations in this study, including recruitment 
limited to those individuals who had prior MMT experience, 
lack of biological testing for drug use, and cross-over from 
assigned study conditions.
A fourth RCT was conducted in a Baltimore, MD, USA, 
prison to examine buprenorphine initiation prior to release 
among opioid-dependent adult prisoners who were no longer 
physiologically dependent on opioids. It assessed the initia-
tion of buprenorphine in prison versus in the community and 
also examined whether outcomes differed between partici-
pants randomly assigned to postrelease treatment at an opioid 
treatment program (OTP) or a community health center 
(CHC).33 A total of 213 participants were recruited between 
September 2008 and July 2012 and randomly assigned to one 
of four groups: 1) buprenorphine treatment initiated in prison 
and continued at an OTP (n=53), 2) buprenorphine treatment 
initiated in prison and continued at a CHC (n=53), 3) coun-
seling only in prison and initiation of buprenorphine at an 
OTP (n=54), and 4) counseling only in prison and initiation 
of buprenorphine at a CHC (n=53). Two participants were 
excluded from the study just after randomization, and there-
fore, data from 211 participants were used in the analysis. 
Participants’ mean age was 39.08 years (SD =8.8), and most 
were men (70.1%) and African-American (70.1%). Initial 
outcome data were obtained on 96.7% of participants within 
10 days post release. Notwithstanding the fact that 19 partici-
pants (17.5%) assigned to receive buprenorphine in prison 
were tapered off medication because of attempted medica-
tion diversion, the groups assigned to start buprenorphine 
in prison were more likely to enter community treatment 
compared to the groups assigned to start buprenorphine post 
release (47.5% vs 33.7; P=0.01). There were no significant 
differences in treatment entry by postrelease treatment site. 
This paper did not report community outcomes beyond the 
10-day treatment entry data.
Longitudinal studies of opioid agonist treatment
The feasibility of providing buprenorphine treatment in a 
minimum security prison in Puerto Rico was studied among 
45 male opioid-dependent prisoners.34 The 1-month follow-up 
rate was 93.3%. The majority of participants entered com-
munity treatment at a physician’s office post release (n=35; 
77.8%), and 33 of these individuals continued buprenorphine 
at 1-month post release. Participants who remained in treat-
ment at 1-month post release compared to participants who 
were out of treatment had greater reductions from prerelease 
baseline to follow-up interview in the median number of days

of self-reported use of heroin (P=0.01) and cocaine (P=0.04), 
and lower rates of opioid-positive urine test results (25% vs 
33.3%, respectively). There were no reincarcerations at the 
1-month follow-up.
A study conducted in the Rhode Island Department of 
Corrections (USA) by Zaller et al35 examined the feasibility of 
initiating buprenorphine prior to release from incarceration. 
The study design was initially a longitudinal pilot study with 
a 6-month follow-up, but due to logistical issues, two groups 
emerged (N=44): one that was medicated prior to release 
(n=12) and the other that was medicated only after release 
(n=32). At the 6-month follow-up, 36 participants (82%) 
were assessed. In all, eleven of 12 (92%) participants who 
started buprenorphine prior to release had entered community 
treatment compared to 25 of 32 (78%) who were unable to ini-
tiate medication prior to release (P=0.30). The mean number 
of weeks in community treatment was 20.3 weeks for those 
initiated on buprenorphine while incarcerated compared to 
13.2 weeks for those participants who were initiated post 
release (P=0.007). Overall, initiation of buprenorphine while 
incarcerated was shown to be feasible and to be associated 
with longer community treatment retention compared to 
starting medication after release.
Studies of using opioid antagonists for 
relapse prevention
Randomized trial of opioid antagonist medication
In the first US report of the use of the opioid antagonist 
XR-NTX to prevent relapse among jail inmates, Lee et al36 
conducted a two-arm RCT in which 34 sentenced adult male 
prisoners in the Rikers Island jail with a known release date 
were recruited between January 2010 and April 2013 and 
were randomly assigned to receive either an intramuscular 
injection of XR-NTX prior to release or a treatment-as-usual 
control group without medication. Inmates were eligible 
for the study if they were 18 years or older, met DSM-IV 
criteria for opioid dependence prior to incarceration, had 
a known release date, were neither receiving nor intending 
to receive methadone or buprenorphine treatment, had not 
recently used an opioid, had a negative urine opioid test, 
did not have opioid withdrawal symptoms in response to a 
naloxone (Narcan) challenge, were not pregnant, and had 
liver function tests no more than three times the normal 
level. Eligible participants who provided informed consent 
received a research assessment and some brief drug abuse 
counseling and aftercare referral information and were then 
randomly assigned to receive XR-NTX prior to release with 
the possibility of having two additional injections at 30 days 
and 60 days after release or to a control group. In the XR-
NTX group, two of 17 participants refused medication, one 
of 17 was medicated but withdrawn from the study because 
his release was delayed, and 15 of 17 received an injection of 
XR-NTX during incarceration. None of the 17 participants 
assigned to the control group received XR-NTX. The aver-
age age of the participants was 40 years in the XR-NTX 
group and 47 years in the control group (P,0.01). In the 
XR-NTX group, 12 of the 16 participants who were released 
(75%) received a second naltrexone injection at 1-month 
post release. As shown in Table 2, at the 4-week follow-up, 
there was a significant difference in the primary outcome of 
opioid relapse (defined as $10 days of opioid use and opioid-
positive urine drug testing). Six participants (38%) of the 
XR-NTX group and 15 (88%) of the control group relapsed 
(P,0.004). There were no significant differences between 
conditions in the secondary outcomes of postrelease injec-
tion drug use, cocaine use, participation in community drug 
treatment, or reincarceration. The study had a number of 
limitations, including relatively small sample size with a high 
attrition rate (30% at 4 weeks and 50% at 8 weeks).
Longitudinal study of opioid antagonist medication
In an observational pilot study by Gordon et al,37 27 adult 
male and female prerelease prisoners were given an injec-
tion of XR-NTX prior to release and were offered up to six 
monthly injections in the community. More than one-third of 
participants (37%) completed all six injections. Participants 
who completed the full course of treatment were less likely 
to submit a positive urine opioid screen at follow-up in the 
community (0% vs 62.5%, respectively; P=0.003). This pilot 
study demonstrated the feasibility of beginning XR-NTX in 
prison and continuing it upon release.
Discussion
Since Dole et al18 study was published ∼50 years ago, which 
examined initiation of methadone prior to release from jail 
to prevent relapse, relatively few prospective clinical studies 
of opioid pharmacotherapy in correctional settings have been 
published. Although expanding, research data on the evidence 
for the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for opioid depen-
dence in correctional settings remain limited. The literature 
review by Hedrich et al20 (which also included nonpeer-
reviewed government reports of evaluations) found that 
methadone treatment in prison reduces heroin use and needle 
sharing and is associated with increased treatment entry post 
release. However, this review noted that the evidence for other 
favorable outcomes is either weaker (reducing heroin use

Research review on opioid pharmacotherapy in jails and prisons
post release), equivocal (reducing crime and incarceration), 
or insufficient (reducing HIV infection or mortality). Since 
this publication, several new RCTs have been published. 
First, a large RCT demonstrated a higher rate of return to 
treatment following incarceration for participants who were 
enrolled in methadone treatment at the time of arrest and 
assigned to continuing methadone treatment compared to 
participants who received a dose taper during detention.23 
A second RCT found that starting buprenorphine in prison 
increases the likelihood of attending treatment post release 
compared to similar guaranteed treatment entry post release 
for participants who were assigned to receive counseling 
without medication in prison.33 There have also been two 
studies with XR-NTX, a pilot RCT that showed that provid-
ing this medication prior to discharge resulted in significantly 
lower rates of opioid relapse compared to no medication36 
and an observational pilot study that showed the feasibility 
of initiating XR-NTX prior to release.37
Most of the extant peer-reviewed literature examined 
relapse prevention strategies initiating medications for indi-
viduals who were opioid abstinent and no longer tolerant in 
order to reduce the risk of relapse and overdose death post 
release.17 Few US jails and prisons initiate pharmacotherapy 
for prisoners despite the recommendations of the WHO.1 This 
is unfortunate because postrelease relapse rates following 
extended prison sentences are high,31 and the trials of using 
medications for relapse prevention indicate that there appear to 
be significant benefits to starting opioid agonist or antagonist 
medications prior to release in terms of increased entry into 
community treatment and reduced heroin use at follow-up. 
However, more research is needed comparing different 
approaches to increasing treatment entry post release.
As noted in the introduction, notwithstanding the fact 
that the US was the first country to make widespread use 
of methadone maintenance therapy in the community and 
to study its use during incarceration, it lags behind many 
countries in providing medications during incarceration to 
treat opioid dependence. The reasons for this are complex 
and may be influenced by a number of intertwined issues. 
First, in the UK, EU, and elsewhere, it is widely recognized 
that prisoners have the right to the same health care in prison 
as in the community.10,38 This principle is consistent with the 
position of the WHO that either methadone or buprenor-
phine should be available to prisoners for maintenance and 
management of opioid withdrawal, and that best practice 
recommendations are to ensure the availability of methadone, 
buprenorphine, and naltrexone for prisoners.1 Thus, many 
countries have implemented the full range of methadone and 
buprenorphine treatment in correctional institutions to match 
their community treatment spectrum.
The evidence from clinical trials to support the WHO 
recommendation varies depending on the purpose of the use 
of the medication (initiating at arrest, during incarceration 
or just prior to release, continuing community treatment 
at the time of arrest) and the type of medication. Thus, to 
date three important questions have been examined in just 
one trial each. These questions are 1) is it better to continue 
methadone or taper off methadone during brief incarcerations 
for people who are taking methadone at the time of incarcera-
tion, 2) which medication during incarceration (methadone 
vs buprenorphine) affords superior community outcomes 
after release, and 3) does methadone maintenance in prison 
afford superior in-prison outcomes as compared to no medi-
cation? The evidence supporting naltrexone use stems only 
from one small RCT with limited community follow-up data. 
Finally, evidence for starting methadone or buprenorphine 
prior to versus after release from longer prison sentences has 
more robust support from four trials. One could easily (and 
rightly) argue that inmates should have access to approved 
medications that are available in the community. However, 
given the unique circumstances of incarceration and chal-
lenges linking patients to community services after release, 
community research findings may not automatically general-
ize to correctional settings. At the very least, it is clear that 
important implementation questions regarding the delivery of 
these services within the correctional institutions and upon 
discharge require clarification and further study. It is also true 
that in the absence of strong direct evidence in favor of using 
these medications during incarceration, it may be difficult to 
convince correctional administrators to adopt these treatments 
in light of the cost and logistical challenges.
In some countries such as the US, providing health care 
to prisoners may not typically be entirely determined by 
community standards.39 Whether methadone treatment (or 
presumably other newer pharmacotherapies for opioid depen-
dence) is required to be provided during incarceration has 
been the subject of numerous lawsuits and may be protected 
under various federal laws.40,41 However, to date the issue has 
not been settled. Further complicating the US situation is the 
decentralized nature of its criminal justice system, much of 
which is under the jurisdiction of a patchwork of states and 
municipalities. US jails detain individuals prior to trial as well 
adjudicated individuals with sentences of, generally, ,1 year, 
while prisons house adjudicated individuals whose sentences 
generally are .1 year. Outside the US, facilities housing 
detainees are called remand prisons in some countries. Jails

in the US, unlike prisons (with few exceptions), are operated 
by the local cities, counties, or Indian tribal authorities and 
report to political leadership at the local level, which is quite 
independent of the state. Each of the 50 US states has its own 
separate prison system operated by a department of correc-
tions. Some prisons are even run by for profit companies on 
behalf of states. In addition, there is a separate federal bureau 
of prisons that operates federal penal institutions across the 
country. Hence, there is no one corrections entity that could 
direct all of these institutions to provide pharmacotherapy.
In contrast to the US, most developed countries have uni-
versal health care in the community, and drug abuse treatment 
is a component of their health care system. The US does not 
have a universal health care system, but rather a medley of 
public and private arrangements that vary widely from state 
to state. Therefore, drug abuse treatment coverage is by no 
means universal or adequate to the need. As noted earlier, 
in the absence of meaningful access to community-based 
treatment, it is difficult to ensure access to opioid pharma-
cotherapy upon release.
Even if adequate funding for pharmacotherapy was avail-
able, there are additional regulatory barriers associated with 
providing opioid agonist treatment in the community in the 
US that must also be overcome in correctional settings. For 
example, methadone treatment requires an OTP license and 
the delivery of bundled services of directly observed medi-
cation and counseling. Buprenorphine treatment requires 
physicians to obtain specialized training and a special federal 
approval to permit prescribing this medication.
Likewise, even when there are adequate treatment 
facilities in the community, corrections’ officials may pose 
roadblocks to the implementation of pharmacological treat-
ment for addiction. Reasons provided for not implementing 
pharmacotherapy include stigma, lack of understanding of 
the use of medications, philosophical objections to the use 
of medications, fear of diversion, and cost.4,7,19 Because state 
corrections’ budgets are distinct from the budgets of the 
health care system, the potential benefits of starting medica-
tion during incarceration may accrue in the community to 
the benefit of the health system or the police, but would be 
borne by the correctional system. Thus, the implementation 
of pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence treatment in a 
correctional institution may be considered a financial burden 
to institution administrators.
Although surmountable, there are also barriers to con-
ducting research on treatment for inmates. In the US, fede-
ral research regulations require that the local institutional 
review board apply to the Federal Office of Human Research 
Protection to ensure that special conditions are met prior 
to initiating research with prisoners, including permitting 
only certain types of research and requiring membership of 
a prisoner advocate on the local institutional review board. 
Despite their status as prisoners, participation in research, of 
course, must be voluntary and free of coercion. Payment for 
participation in health research in prison is possible42 but must 
be done with care to avoid the payment seeming coercive in 
a resource-poor environment. Many of the papers reviewed 
herein did not describe how these issues were dealt with, and 
future research papers should provide a description of how 
the study addressed them.
The RCTs reviewed have a number of limitations that 
should be addressed in future research. Three of the eight 
RCTs had ,100 participants.18,32,36 Future studies would be 
strengthened by an adequate sample size, by clearly defined 
primary and secondary outcomes, and by addressing statisti-
cal power. Three of the trials did not conduct biological drug 
testing.18,23,26 Drug testing at follow-up provides objective 
data, which would strengthen reliability of self-reported 
drug use. Three of the studies reported postrelease outcomes 
only in the short term (ie, ,3 months).23,33,36 Future research 
should include longer term follow-up of a year or more 
post release. Another limitation of the extant research is its 
focus on males, with five of the studies including only male 
participants.15,18,24,26,36 The cost to society from crime and 
incarceration and health-related costs associated with drug 
use underscore the need for economic analyses to accompany 
research whenever possible. This will help to bolster and 
make a compelling case to policy makers who might not be 
swayed solely on the basis of patient outcomes data.
Only one RCT examined the effectiveness of continuing 
opioid agonist treatment (in this case, methadone) compared 
to discontinuing it during incarceration.23 Continuing medi-
cations during detention while an individual is awaiting trial 
should be a minimum standard of care for any chronic illness 
(such as epilepsy or hypertension). However, this minimum 
standard is routinely violated in the US for opioid agonist 
treatment. There would not appear to be the need for additional 
research to demonstrate the benefits of continuing opioid 
agonist medication during detention given the robust evi-
dence of its effectiveness in the community. However, future 
implementation studies examining approaches to maximizing 
return to care post release, including engagement strategies 
for those who do not reenter treatment, are needed.
Given the large number of opioid-dependent individuals 
who are out of treatment at the time of arrest and cycle in and 
out of jails, it is surprising that only one RCT26 has examined

Research review on opioid pharmacotherapy in jails and prisons
the use of opioid agonist treatment for out-of-treatment 
individuals at the time of incarceration. However, this study 
compared methadone to buprenorphine and lacked a treat-
ment-as-usual group, making it difficult to draw comparisons 
to usual care. To address the lack of a comparison condition 
resembling (though superior to) usual care, our group is cur-
rently conducting a three-group random assignment study 
comparing initiating methadone in jail, initiating methadone 
in jail with postrelease patient navigation, and initiating 
methadone dose taper in jail with drug treatment and overdose 
prevention referral among newly arrested detainees in opioid 
withdrawal (NCT 02334215). This study, part of a cooperative 
study with two other sites that are examining XR-NTX prior 
to release, seeks to enroll 300 male and female participants 
and has a 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-
up, and includes urine drug testing and economic analyses to 
address some of the limitations described earlier.
Finally, the opioid antagonist XR-NTX may prove quite 
useful for select individuals who prefer a long-acting, non-
agonist medication for relapse prevention. However, given 
that the Lee et al36 study was a pilot, more research is needed 
in this area. There are currently two trials underway as part 
of the aforementioned cooperative study in Albuquerque, 
NM and New Y
ork, NY (NCT 02110264 and 01999946, 
respectively) to compare XR-NTX to referral to treatment 
and overdose prevention that should provide additional infor-
mation regarding the boundaries of this pharmacotherapy. 
Here, too, the research, even if strongly supportive of this 
approach, will have limited impact unless there is the possi-
bility to continued treatment in the communities to which 
these individuals return.
