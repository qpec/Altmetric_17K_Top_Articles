Abstract
The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with an increased 
risk of bone fracture, raising concerns about their increasingly broader usage. This deleterious 
effect is poorly understood and thus strategies to avoid this side effect remain elusive. We show 
here that fluoxetine (Flx), one of the most prescribed SSRI, acts on bone remodeling through two 
distinct mechanisms. Peripherally, Flx has antiresorptive properties, directly impairing osteoclast 
differentiation and function through a serotonin reuptake-independent Ca2+-calmodulin-NFATc1-
dependent mechanism. With time, however, Flx also triggers a brain serotonin-dependent rise in 
sympathetic output that increases bone resorption sufficiently to counteract its local antiresorptive 
effect; thus leading to a net effect of impaired bone formation and bone loss. Accordingly, 
neutralizing this second mode of action through co-treatment with the β-blocker propranolol, 
while leaving the peripheral effect intact, prevents Flx-induced bone loss in mice. Hence, this 
study identifies a dual mode of action of SSRIs on bone remodeling and suggests a therapeutic 
strategy to block the deleterious effect on bone homeostasis from their chronic use.

 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and among them fluoxetine (Flx), the active 
compound in Prozac, are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in western countries. 
Their therapeutic effect is mediated by a central increase of serotonin signaling in post-
synaptic neurons due to an inhibition of serotonin reuptake by the 5-hydroxytryptamine 
transporter (5HTT) expressed by pre-synaptic neurons1,2. Given their remarkable binding 
specificity for 5HTT, SSRIs have progressively been favored over less-targeted 
antidepressants because they decrease the potential for unwanted side effects. They are also 
increasingly prescribed to treat non-psychiatric disorders, including preventing hot flashes in 
menopausal women3,4.
In recent years, however, multiple clinical studies have reported a positive association 
between the use of SSRIs and a decrease in bone mineral density and (or) an increased risk 
of fractures, raising considerable concern about their broad use5–7. This association between 
SSRI treatment and bone loss was confirmed in multiple rodent models8–11. As these animal 
studies bypass a major confounding issue of the clinical analyses, namely the fact that SSRIs 
are prescribed to depressed individuals and that depression is by itself a possible cause for 
bone loss5,6,12, they have strengthened the notion that treatment with SSRIs could be an 
independent risk factor for developing osteoporosis. Yet, despite noting a decrease in bone 
formation8–10 these animal studies did not identify the molecular mechanism for this effect 
on bone or a therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat this side effect. These animal studies 
also did not explain why chronic administration of SSRIs causes bone loss while these drugs 
are designed to increase central serotonin signaling, a pathway known to favor bone mass 
accrual13,14. To explain this paradox and define the action of SSRIs on bone remodeling at 
the molecular level we analyzed the effect of chronic treatments of various length on normal, 
healthy mice. Here, we identify a dual mode of action of Flx on bone remodeling that 
provides a molecular explanation for its observed effects on bone. In particular, we show that 
a short-term (3 weeks) treatment with Flx results in a local anti-resorptive response that 
increases bone mass, but that there is a net loss of bone with longer-term (6 weeks) Flx use, 
which is mediated by a centrally-triggered increase in sympathetic activity. Based on these 
findings we then show that co-treating mice with Flx and a β-blocker can prevent this 
deleterious side effect.
Results
The extent of SSRIs use determines their impact on bone mass
Clinical studies reporting bone loss following treatment with SSRIs examined individuals 
that took these drugs for a relatively long period of time (≥ one year). However, in the rare 
cases that these analyses were performed after only a few months of treatment an improved 
bone density and a decrease in bone resorption parameters have been reported15–17. To test if 
the length of treatment correlates with different effects of SSRIs on bone remodeling we 
treated wild-type (WT) female mice for 3 (3 w) or 6 weeks (6 w) with a dose of Flx resulting 
in plasma concentrations similar to the therapeutic levels achieved in humans18. In both long 
bones and vertebrae, the longer-term treatment caused bone loss while mice treated with Flx 
for the shorter time showed a higher bone volume (BV/TV, bone volume over tissue volume) 
than vehicle (veh)-treated mice (Fig. 1a).

 To understand the cellular basis underlying this time-dependent effect we performed bone 
histomorphometry. Mice treated for only 3 w with Flx showed lower osteoclast surface 
(Oc.S/BS, osteoclast surface over bone surface) while bone formation rate (BFR/BS, bone 
formation rate over bone surface) and osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS, osteoblast surface over 
bone surface) were not significantly affected compared to veh-treated mice (Fig. 1b,c). 
Accordingly, the concentration of Deoxypyridinoline crosslinks (Dpd), a marker of bone 
resorption, was lower in Flx-treated than in veh-treated mice while concentration of 
osteocalcin (OCN), a marker of bone formation, was not (Fig. 1d). In mice treated for 6 w 
with Flx, however, histomorphometry and biomarker analysis showed that the osteoclast 
parameters that were significantly lower after 3 w of treatment compared to the veh-treated 
group were no longer significantly different after 6 w of treatment compared to veh (Fig. 
1b,d,e,f). In contrast, osteoblast parameters such as bone formation rate and OCN 
concentration that were not significantly different after 3 w of Flx treatment versus veh were 
lower following 6 w of treatment with Flx compared to veh (Fig. 1c,d,f,g).
Flx directly impairs osteoclast differentiation and function
To understand the dual effects of Flx on bone resorption with respect to shorter-term versus 
longer-term use, we first assessed the ratio of expression of Tnfrsf11b (also known as 
Osteoprotegerin, OPG) to Tnfsf11 (also known as Receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B 
ligand, RANKL) in long bones, an indicator of a potent osteoblast-driven pathway 
regulating osteoclast differentiation and function19,20. While this ratio was not significantly 
affected following 3 w of treatment, it was lower in mice subjected to the longer treatment 
with Flx compared to veh (Fig. 2a).
To determine if a direct effect on osteoclasts could be a mechanism by which Flx affects 
bone homeostasis we treated primary osteoclast cultures with a dose of Flx similar to levels 
observed in plasma and tissues of individuals taking this drug18. When mouse primary 
osteoclast precursors were differentiated in the presence of Flx or other SSRIs such as 
paroxetine (Paro) and fluvoxamine (Fluvo), the number of differentiated osteoclasts was 
significantly lower compared to veh-treated cultures (Fig. 2b). Yet, veh- and these SSRIs-
treated cultures had a similar number of mononuclear cells suggesting that the viability of 
the osteoclast precursors was not affected (Fig. 2b). Citalopram (Cita), however, did not 
show a significant inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation suggesting the existence of 
intra-class differences among different SSRIs (Fig. 2b). The inhibitory effect of Flx on 
osteoclast differentiation was reversible upon its withdrawal from the culture, further ruling 
out cell death as the basis for this activity (Fig. 2c). SSRIs treatment also directly affected 
osteoclast function, as primary cultures already differentiated and treated for 24 hours with 
Flx, Paro or Fluvo, but not Cita, showed lower tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 
activity compared to veh-treated cells (Fig. 2d).
To better understand how Flx influences osteoclast biology we examined the key processes 
that mark the differentiation of pre-osteoclasts into mature, functional osteoclasts: fusion of 
mononuclear cells into multinucleated osteoclasts, formation of a specific adhesion structure 
termed the ruffled border and the ability to resorb mineralized bone19,20. Whether added to 
the culture of osteoclast precursors during the entire differentiation process or only during its

 final stage, Flx inhibited cell fusion as indicated by a lower average number of nuclei in 
TRAP positive multinucleated cells and lower expression of Dc-stamp and Atp6v0d2, two 
genes encoding proteins required for this process19, compared to veh (Fig. 2e,f). Adhesion 
was also affected since expression of the gene encoding Integrin β3 (Itgb3), a key adhesion 
molecule19, was specifically lower and the supernatant contained more, TRAP-positive, cells 
in Flx- than in veh-treated cultures (Fig. 2f,g). These cells were alive since they could be re-
plated and cultured (Fig. 2g). In contrast, Flx did not affect the formation of the actin ring or 
the expression of the genes encoding proteins required for establishing the ruffled 
border21,22 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Lastly, we analyzed the effect of Flx on the resorptive 
capacity of mature osteoclasts. Expression of multiple genes that encode proteins involved in 
this process such as Cathepsin K or units of the proton pump was lower in Flx- compared to 
veh-treated cultures, as was pit resorption (Fig. 2h,i). Altogether these data indicate that Flx 
directly impairs osteoclast fusion, adhesion and resorptive function. Notably, the expression 
of all genes controlling these processes and found affected by Flx in vitro was lower in mice 
treated for 3 weeks with this drug than in veh-treated mice (Fig. 2j).
Flx alters calcium signaling in osteoclasts
Given the affinity of SSRIs for the 5HTT transporter and its previously reported expression 
in osteoclasts23–25, we next tested whether 5HTT mediates the direct effect of Flx on 
osteoclast biology. The ability of Flx to inhibit osteoclast differentiation was not impaired in 
cells derived from mice lacking Slc6a4, the gene encoding 5HTT, or from mice lacking 
Tph1, the gene encoding the rate limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis (Tph1−/− mice) as 
assessed by TRAP activity or gene expression (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). 
Moreover, following a 3 w treatment with Flx, Slc6a4-deficient mice showed a modification 
of their bone histomorphometry profile similar to WT mice treated for the same amount of 
time with Flx; i.e., a bone volume higher than veh-treated mice associated with a lower 
osteoclast surface (Fig. 3b). These observations indicate that Flx directly inhibits osteoclast 
differentiation and function in a 5HTT-independent manner.
To understand how Flx could directly act on osteoclast biology if not through its canonical 
mode of action we assessed the expression of key factors controlling osteoclast biology26. 
Expression of c-Fos and of its downstream target Nfatc1 was lower in the presence of Flx 
than of veh whereas expression of Cebpa, which acts upstream of c-Fos in the osteoclast 
differentiation cascade27, was not affected (Fig. 3c). Of note, expression of c-Fos and Nfatc1 
was lower in Flx- than in veh-treated Slc6a4-deficient cells, again showing that Flx acts 
direct on osteoclast biology independently from 5HTT (Fig. 3d). Expression of Nfatc1 was 
also significantly lower in the long bones of WT mice treated for 3 weeks with Flx than with 
veh (Fig. 3e).
A decrease in c-Fos expression could be caused by an inhibition of RANKL signaling 
through the p38-MAPKinase pathway or by an interference with the Ca2+-calmodulin 
dependent activation of CREB28,29. Western blot analyses did not detect a change in the 
phosphorylation of p38-MAPK upon Flx compared to veh treatment (Fig. 3f), indicating that 
direct RANKL signaling is not the main pathway affected. There was, however, significantly 
lower levels of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) in Flx-treated than in veh-treated

 osteoclasts (Fig. 3f). Fura-2 calcium imaging experiments confirmed that Flx decreases 
intracellular Ca2+ levels in multinucleated osteoclasts while it does have this effect in 
mononuclear precursors (Fig. 3g). Moreover W5, a selective antagonist of Ca2+-calmodulin 
signaling30, abolished the effect of Flx on the expression of osteoclast differentiation 
markers as well as on resorptive activity (Fig. 3h,i). Likewise, reducing Creb expression 
through gene inactivation or blocking CREB transcriptional activity with the KG-501 
inhibitor31 mimicked and blocked the negative effect of Flx on these parameters (Fig. 3i and 
Supplementary Fig. 2c).
Hence, Flx causes its 5HTT-independent inhibitory effect on osteoclast biology by directly 
impairing a Ca2+/calmodulin-CREB-NFATc1 signaling cascade required for their 
differentiation and function. This effect is reminiscent of the Ca2+ signaling inhibition 
observed in Jurkat T lymphocytes treated with Flx32. We therefore tested whether mice 
treated with Flx for 3 weeks showed differences in lymphocyte differentiation markers. 
Indeed, expression of genes encoding Creb and NFAT but also of the master regulator of 
lymphocyte Th17 differentiation RORγt, a key component of the osteoimmune crosstalk 
involved in rheumatoid arthritis33,34, was reduced in the spleen of Flx- compared to veh-
treated mice (Fig. 3j). These changes in gene expression occurred independently of the 
serotonin reuptake process since they could be observed in Slc6a4-deficient mice (Fig. 3j).
Flx inhibits brain serotonin signaling to cause bone loss
While a direct, negative, effect of Flx on bone resorption can explain the higher bone mass 
observed after a 3 w treatment it cannot explain why a longer-term treatment causes bone 
loss and a decrease in bone formation. Analysis of primary cultures of osteoblasts treated 
with Flx ruled out a direct effect on these cells since Flx did not induce changes in 
expression of the genes controlling their differentiation or characterizing their function35,36 
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
In search for an indirect mechanism that could cause bone loss we reckoned that the lower 
bone resorption compared to veh caused by the direct effect of Flx on osteoclasts was no 
longer apparent after 6 weeks of treatment. This suggested that another, enhancing, effect on 
bone resorption was developing when the treatment was extended. Supporting this 
hypothesis, expression of the gene encoding RANKL and therefore the Tnfrsf11b/Tnfsf11 
ratio was changed after 6 but not 3 w of treatment with Flx and Nfatc1 expression was 
normalized compared to vehicle after 6 w of treatment (Fig. 2a and Fig. 4a). An increase in 
RANKL levels could rescue the inhibitory effect of Flx on the Ca2+-calmodulin-NFATc1 
pathway by independently activating the RANK-NFκB-NFATc1 cascade37,38. To verify that 
Flx does not affect this parallel activity of RANKL, RAW264.7 osteoclasts were treated with 
a low and higher dose of RANKL in the presence of Flx or vehicle. In either case, RANKL 
induced a similar dose-dependent effect: levels of the inhibitor IκBα were lower and NFκB 
p65 nuclear levels were higher than in control cells (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4).
An increase in RANKL-mediated, OPG expression-independent, bone resorption associated 
with a decrease in bone formation is a hallmark of the effect of sympathetic signaling in 
osteoblasts39,40. We therefore tested whether a longer-term treatment with Flx increased 
sympathetic output. Indeed, the concentrations of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE),

 the two main effectors of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), in urine were significantly 
higher after 6 w but not after 3 w of treatment with Flx compared to veh (Fig. 4c). Likewise, 
expression of Ucp1 in brown fat, a marker of SNS activity, was only higher in mice treated 
with Flx for 6 w compared to 3 w of treatment or veh treatment (Fig. 4d).
We then explored how Flx could affect sympathetic output. Both the hypothalamic 
expression of Butyrylcholinesterase (Bche), a gene up-regulated in absence of brain 
serotonin signaling14, and the concentration of NE in brainstem extracts were higher in Flx- 
compared to veh-treated mice (Fig. 4e). These observations suggested that Flx could impair 
signaling of the central serotonin/Htr2c pathway known to specifically influence bone 
remodeling13,14. Indeed, hypothalamic extracts from mice treated for 6 w with Flx showed 
significantly lower levels of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB), a downstream mediator of 
serotonin signaling through Htr2c14, compared to mice treated with veh (Fig. 4f). This effect 
was even more pronounced compared to mice treated for only 3 w with Flx, as these showed 
the increase in p-CREB hypothalamic levels that Flx is expected to induce upon increasing 
serotonin signaling (Fig. 4f). A similar biphasic effect could also be observed when 
Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells that robustly express Htr2c were treated with increasing 
amount of serotonin (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 5). These data suggest that, by 
progressively increasing serotonin signaling in the brain, Flx can induce Htr2c 
desensitization, a classic feature of GPCR signaling41. Of note, western blot analyses also 
showed that levels of Htr2c in hypothalamic extracts became gradually lower after 3 and 6 w 
of Flx treatment compared to veh (Fig. 4f). These data support the notion that, with time, Flx 
decreases serotonin signaling in the hypothalamus.
To confirm genetically that the central effect of Flx is serotonin-dependent we treated mice 
lacking Tph2, the gene encoding the enzyme required for brain serotonin synthesis, with Flx 
or vehicle for 6 weeks. In contrast to the effect observed in WT mice, Flx failed to modify 
sympathetic output or the Tnfrsf11b/Tnfsf11 ratio in Tph2−/− mice (Fig. 4h). As a result, 
these mutant mice treated with Flx did not show lower bone formation parameters and did 
not loose bone compare to the veh-treated group (Fig. 4i). Instead, their bone volume was 
improved compared to veh-treated Tph2−/− mice due to a lower osteoclast surface (Fig. 4i). 
This phenotype, which mimics the one observed in WT mice treated with Flx for 3 w, 
indicates that in absence of a central effect Flx anti-resorptive peripheral activity persists 
after 6 w of treatment. A similar improvement in bone volume was observed in Slc6a4−/− 
mice treated for 6 w with Flx compared to veh (Fig. 4j). Thus, Flx does not use another, 
unexpected and serotonin-independent mechanism than its known action on brain 5HTT to 
induce bone loss.
Given that most of the clinical data on the effect of SSRIs on bone health were acquired in 
women, the previous experiments were all performed in female mice. To test if Flx exerts the 
same action in both genders we next treated groups of male mice with Flx. As in female 
mice, bone loss could be observed in both vertebrae and long bones after 6 w of Flx 
compared to veh treatment (Fig. 5a). This effect was due to a lower bone formation, as 
indicated by a sharp drop of serum OCN concentration (Fig. 5b), while the concentration of 
the resorption marker Dpd was not statistically different compared to the veh-treated group 
despite a markedly lowered Tnfrsf11b/Tnfsf11 ratio (Fig. 5c,d). As in female mice, this

 phenotype was associated with a trend for higher SNS output, although this did not reach 
statistical significance for changes in E and NE concentrations (Fig. 5e,f). Likewise, Flx 
triggered similar inhibitory responses with respect to gene expression and function 
compared to veh in primary osteoclasts derived from male as from female mice (Fig. 5g–i).
Co-treatment with propranolol prevents Flx-induced bone loss
If the bone loss induced by longer-term Flx use results from an increase in SNS output, then 
decreasing SNS signaling in bone cells should prevent this side effect. To test this hypothesis 
we analyzed WT mice co-treated for 6 w with Flx and a low, 0.5 mg/day, dose of 
propranolol (Prop) that does not significantly affect bone mass accrual by itself (Fig. 6a–d). 
Compared to mice treated with Flx alone, mice treated with both drugs did not lose bone, 
showing normal bone formation parameters and lower bone resorption parameters, as 
assessed by histomorphometry of vertebrae and serum concentration of biomarkers (Fig. 6a–
c). Similar results were obtained on tibiae analyzed by microcomputed tomography (μCT) 
(Fig. 6d). In agreement with the role of sympathetic signaling in osteoblasts39,40, the 
Tnfrsf11b/Tnfsf11 ratio, and more specifically the expression of the gene encoding RANKL, 
was normalized in mice co-treated with Flx and propranolol compared to those treated with 
Flx alone although their sympathetic tone was similarly high compared to veh- or Prop-
treated mice (Fig. 6e–g). Notably, in a marble-burying test we used throughout the study as a 
functional readout of the effect of Flx on behavior (Supplementary Fig. 6) the co-treatment 
with a low dose of propranolol did not alter this aspect of Flx activity (Fig. 6h), suggesting 
that Flx’s central action on this behavior was not affected.
Discussion
This study shows that Flx affects bone mass accrual in mice through two distinct 
mechanisms (Fig. 6i). In particular, Flx can interfere directly with Ca2+/calmodulin signaling 
in osteoclasts to decrease CREB phosphorylation, c-Fos and Nfatc1 expression thereby 
impairing the maturation and activity of these cells. This mechanism of action is consistent 
with the lower bone resorption observed in mice treated with Flx for 3 w compared to the 
veh-treated group, and is independent of the 5HTT transporter. Upon a longer treatment (6 
w), however, this direct inhibitory effect on osteoclasts is counteracted and a decrease in 
bone formation leads to bone loss. This second effect is associated with decreased serotonin 
signaling in the hypothalamus and increased SNS output. Accordingly, normalization of 
sympathetic output with a low dose of propranolol can prevent Flx-induced bone loss.
It should be noted that the two independent effects exerted by Flx on bone remodeling are 
not binary effects, and the 3- and 6-w time points are arbitrary points in what is a continuum 
of bone remodeling. Indeed, at the 3 w time point bone parameters already appear to be 
trending down, albeit not significantly, in the Flx- compared to veh-treated mice. Likewise, 
osteoclast surface is still trailing down after 6 w of treatment.
Brain serotonin, signaling through an Htr2c-CREB cascade, positively regulates bone mass 
accrual by inhibiting sympathetic output13,14. Thus, how can Flx mimic the effect of a 
decrease in brain serotonin signaling on bone remodeling while its canonical activity on 
5HTT should increase this activity? In agreement with previous studies showing that high

 concentrations of serotonin can desensitize Htr2c42–44, our data show lower hypothalamic 
levels of phosphorylated CREB, its downstream mediator, upon 6 w of treatment with Flx 
compared to veh. In addition, mice treated with Flx for 3 and 6 w had progressively lower 
levels of hypothalamic Htr2c compared to veh-treated mice. Thus, with time, Flx decreases 
serotonin signaling in Htr2c neurons and thereby causes a similar, negative, effect on bone 
remodeling as the absence of brain serotonin13,14. This central-SNS–mediated detrimental 
activity on bone remodeling appears to be delayed compared to the direct, anti-resorptive, 
action of Flx. This difference in timing could stem from the fact that more time could be 
needed for this drug to cause an increase in inter-synaptic brain serotonin sufficient to 
desensitize the Htr2c receptor and decrease its expression than to reach osteoclasts 
peripherally and directly disturb their function.
An unexpected finding of our study is the fact that Flx can act directly on osteoclasts 
through a pathway different from its canonical mode of action. Although cells from the 
osteoclast lineage express the 5HTT transporter and the gene encoding Tph1, osteoclasts 
derived from mice lacking these genes respond to Flx similarly to wild-type cells23,24,45. 
Thus, at least in mice, Flx acts on these cells independently of the serotonin/5HTT system. 
Instead, this drug directly impairs Ca2+-calmodulin signaling. This ability of Flx to interfere 
with intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis has been observed in other cell types32,46,47. 
Accordingly, Flx can impair extracellular Ca2+ influx by blocking various voltage-gated and 
ligand-gated ion channels47–49. More recently, Flx was also found to inhibit IP3- and 
ryanodine-receptor mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in lymphocytes, an effect 
that could explain the poorly understood immunomodulatory activity of SSRIs32,50–53. 
Additional studies will be needed to determine which of these mechanisms occurs in 
osteoclasts. Further, through a simultaneous inhibition of osteoclast function and a decrease 
in Th17 lymphocyte activation34,50,54, this mode of action could also explain the beneficial 
effect of SSRIs on multiple outcomes of osteoarthritis in mice and humans55–57. Again, 
additional studies are required to test this possibility.
More generally, considering that our study was performed using mouse models one cannot 
exclude that differences could exist between the mechanisms we describe in mice and those 
at play in humans taking SSRIs. Yet, the dual effect of Flx on bone remodeling we observe 
in our mouse models is consistent with data reported in the clinical literature. For instance, 
most clinical studies analyzed long-term SSRIs users and found a negative effect on bone 
health5,6,9,11 consistent with the central effect of Flx on the sympathetic tone that we 
identified. In line with this notion, Flx increases the plasma concentration of E and NE in 
individuals58 suggesting that, as in mice, decreasing sympathetic signaling in osteoblasts 
through the use of a β2-blocker could prevent bone loss in long-term users of SSRIs. 
Likewise, in agreement with the anti-resorptive activity of Flx, individuals evaluated shortly 
after taking SSRIs show higher calcaneal BMD T-score and lower serum concentration of 
the resorption biomarker CTx15,16. Lastly, we show that citalopram does not inhibit mouse 
osteoclast differentiation and others have reported that escitalopram, its S-enantiomer, did 
not affect bone resorption in nondepressed women treated for a short time with this drug59. 
These observations illustrate that SSRIs may not all have a similar impact on bone 
remodeling and that in animal studies as in clinical reports more attention should be given to 
potential intra-class differences.

 Online Methods
Animals and in vivo treatments
We purchased males and females C57BL6/J and Slc6a4−/− mice from The Jackson 
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maryland). Generation of Tph2−/− mice was reported 
previously13. We generated Tph1−/− mice by crossing Tph1fl/fl mice60 and EIIA-Cre. All 
mice were analyzed on the C57BL6/J background. We added fluoxetine hydrochloride USP 
(Flx, 20mg/kg/day, Voigt Global Distribution Inc., Lawrence, Kansas) and propranolol 
(Prop, 0.5mg/day, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) aseptically to the drinking water of virgin 
female or male mice. We treated mice for either 3 w or 6 w as indicated in each specific 
case, replacing bottles every other day. All mice were analyzed between the age of 17 and 20 
weeks. Any mouse displaying immobility, huddled posture, inability to eat or drink, ruffled 
fur, self-mutilation, vocalization, wound dehiscence or signs of hypothermia was excluded 
from the study. In all experiments, animals were randomly assigned to the veh- or Flx-
treated groups. For all assays, investigators were blinded to the type of treatment. The 
Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all 
procedures.
Measurement of biomarkers
We collected blood samples through cardiac puncture under Avertin anesthesia using 
Multivette 600 tubes from Sarstedt (Numbrecht, Germany) and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 
10_ min at 4 °C. We measured the concentration of OCN with Ocn IRMA kit (Immutopics, 
San Clemente, California). We collected urine samples in the morning for at least three days 
within the week previous to sacrifice and measured the concentrations of Dpd with the Dpd 
EIA kit (Quidel, San Diego, California) and of E and NE with the Bi-CAT ELISA kit 
(Alpco, Salem, New Hampshire). We reported urine values to the concentration of 
Creatinine quantified with the Creatinine EIA kit (Quidel). We measured epinephrine 
content in brainstem by HPLC with a modified method described previously61. Briefly, 
dissected brain samples were homogenized in 0.4 M perchloric acid with an Ultra Cell 
Disruptor (Microson). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 14,000 g in cold 
room and a 50 μl of typically four-times diluted aliquot of the supernatant was injected over 
the HPLC system equipped with a Varian Microsorb 100-5 C18 reverse-phase column 
(DYNAMAX 150×4.6 mm). The mobile phase contained 0.75 mM sodium phosphate (pH 
3.1), 1.4 mM 1-Octanesulfonic acid, 10 μM sodium EDTA and 8% acetonitrile and the flow 
rate was maintained at 0.8 ml/min. Values were calculated based on peak area and compared 
to standard solutions. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation of the assay were 
each less than 5%. The sensitivity of the assay was less than 0.5 pmol/injection.
Cell culture, in vitro treatments and imaging
We obtained mouse primary osteoclast precursors (monocytes) by culturing bone marrow 
cells with M-CSF-containing L-929 (ATCC, Massanas, Virginia) cell supernatant (10%) for 
5–6 days in DMEM 10% FBS. We then differentiated osteoclast precursors with 30 ng/mL 
of RANKL (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota) and 10 ng/mL of M-CSF (R&D) 
in αMEM 10% FBS for 6 days. We cultured RAW264.7 cells (ATCC) in DMEM 10% FBS 
and differentiated with 30 ng/mL of RANKL (R&D) in αMEM 10% FBS for 3 days before

 Flx treatment. Medium was replaced every 48h. We isolated mouse primary osteoblasts from 
3 day-old pups and cultured them with αMEM 10% FBS for 2 days as previously 
described62. Osteoblasts were differentiated in αMEM 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml L-ascorbic 
acid, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate for 6 days in presence of veh or Flx (3 μM). We cultured 
Neuro2A cells (ATCC) in DMEM 10% FBS and starved them in 0.5% FBS for 16–18 h 
before serotonin treatment. Creb−/− osteoclasts were generated by infecting Crebfl/fl cells 
with either empty vector or Cre-expressing adenovirus (1:800 MOI) (University of Iowa). 
We did not test the cultures of primary cells or cell lines for mycoplasma infection. Primary 
cell cultures were authenticated through gene expression analysis of specific markers.
We dissolved fluoxetine (Voigt Global Distribution Inc., Lawrence, Kansas), paroxetine, 
fluvoxamine and citalopram (Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) at 10 mM in NaCl 0.9% 
and added them to the medium to the final concentration of 3 μM for 6 days (end point) or 
only during the last 24 h of culture. In 6 days treatment, medium was replaced every 48 h. 
We dissolved W-5 (Santa Cruz) at 10 mM in water and added it to the medium to the final 
concentration of 50 μM. We dissolved KG-501 (Sigma) at 10 mM in DMSO and added it to 
the medium to the final concentration of 10 μM. For detached live cells analysis, we treated 
cultures of mature osteoclasts for 24 h with fluoxetine or vehicle then we collected and 
centrifuged the media. We subjected the pellets to a TRAP assay or re-seeded them in new 
plates and cultured them in osteoclast differentiation medium until we stained the plates with 
TRAP (see below). For counting the number of nuclei/osteoclast, we fixed primary 
osteoclasts in 4% formaldehyde, stained actin with a 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 548-
conjugated phalloidin (Life Technologies, A12380) and nuclei with DAPI at 0.2 μg/ml (Life 
Technologies).
We imaged cultures under bright field (TRAP staining) or fluorescent light (actin) with a 
Leica DM400B (Wetzlar, Germany). We used ImageJ software to quantify the number of 
cells and nuclei for each osteoclast.
TRAP and Pit resorption assays
For TRAP staining, we fixed primary osteoclast cultures in 10% formalin, washed and 
incubated them with TRAP staining reagent (0.5 mg/ml Naphthol AS-MX Phosphate 
(Sigma), 0.4 mg/ml Fast Red Violet (Sigma) in acetate-tartrate buffer [25 mM Sodium 
acetate and 20 mM Sodium tartrate, pH5]) for 30 min at RT. For TRAP quantification in 
supernatant, we incubated 50 μl of culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μl of 10 mM 
pNPP (Sigma) in TRAP assay buffer (200 mM Sodium chloride, 200 mM Sodium citrate 
and 80 mM of Sodium L-(+)-tartrate, pH5). We stopped the reaction by adding 50 μl of 
NaOH 3M and performed colorimetry at 405 nm vs a reference at 490 nm using a 
microplate reader (Bio-Rad 680, Hercules, California). We calculated TRAP activity as 
(Abs405 x vol (ml))/(ε x time (min)). ε (molar extinction coefficient) of pNPP is 17.8 
mM−1cm−1. We processed and read technical duplicates of each sample. We performed pit 
resorption assays using Osteo Assay Stripwell Plates (Corning, New York, New York) 
following the manufacturer’s protocol.

 Gene expression, protein analyses and immunocytochemistry
We purified RNA from cells in culture and tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, 
New York) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We flushed long bones of bone marrow 
prior to RNA purification. We performed real-time PCR (qPCR) using the Taq SYBR Green 
Power PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) on a CFX Connect instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, 
California); Gapdh or Hprt (in case of brain samples) amplification was used as an internal 
reference for each sample. Verification of amplicon specificity was tested through a BLAST 
search and the size of amplicons was verified by gel electrophoresis. Dissociation curves 
analysis was performed for every experiment. Sequences of the primers used for each gene 
are available upon request.
We subjected protein extracts from cells or tissue to western blotting using the following 
antibodies: phospho-CREB in Figure 3f (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, Massachusetts, 
9198), phospho-CREB in all other figures (1:1000, Merck Millipore, Billerica, 
Massachusetts, 06-519) CREB (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9104), phospho-p38 MAPK 
(1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9211), p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling, 9212), IκBα (1:5000, Cell 
Signaling, 4814), GAPDH (1:5000, Cell Signaling, 5174), Htr2c (1:500, Santa Cruz 
sc-17797). We visualized immunocomplexes with a HPR-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-
mouse IgG antibody (1:2000) followed by incubation with ECL-Western blot reagent (GE 
Healthcare, Indianapolis, Indiana). Imaged blots were quantified using the ImageJ software 
(National Institutes of Health). Uncropped blots are presented in Supplementary Data Set 1. 
For all antibodies, validation is provided in manufacter’s website.
For NF-κB p65 localization by immunocytochemistry, we grown RAW264.7 cells until 
differentiation and depleted them of RANKL for 1 h. Subsequently, we incubated for 30 min 
with indicated amounts of RANKL, and with vehicle or Flx as indicated. Then, we fixed 
them in 4% formaldehyde, incubated them in PBS 0.5% Triton-X-100 for permeabilization 
and then treated them with PBS 10% FBS to block nonspecific binding. We incubated them 
overnight at 4 °C with NFκB p65 antibody (1:400, Cell Signaling, 8242). We used Alexa 
Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:400, Life Technologies, A11006) as a secondary 
antibody. We stained actin with a dilution of Alexa Fluor 548-conjugated phalloidin (1:100) 
and nuclei with DAPI at 0.2 μg/ml. We used a Zeiss Axiovert 200 (Jena, Germany) to image 
and the ImageJ software to compose p65 nuclear translocation panels.
Calcium imaging with Fura-2
We cultured RAW264.7 cells on 35 mm glass bottom dishes (CellVis Ca, USA) and 
differentiated them with 30 ng/ml of RANKL (R&D) for 3 days. Before imaging, we loaded 
cells with 5 μM of calcium (Ca2+) indicator Fura-2 for 45 min. At the moment of imaging, 
regular medium was replaced with phenol red free DMEM (CellGro Mediatech, Manassas, 
Virginia). We recorded intracellular Ca2+ levels as represented by ratio of Fura-2 (340/380 
nm) absorbance in single cells of each culture using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope 
equipped with a random access monochromator (Photon Technology International, PTI, 
Birmingham, New Jersey) for excitation and a Photometrics (Tucson, Arizona) QuantEM 
EM-CCD camera for image acquisition. We drawn regions of interest (ROI) around 
osteoclasts and mononuclear cells, and images were acquired using a 40X 1.3 NA oil

 objective for a total of 8 min. We added 3 μM of fluoxetine (Flx) with a pipette at t = 3 min 
and 3 μM sarco/endoplasmics reticulum ATPase blocker, Thapsigargin (Thap) (Sigma, St. 
Louis, Missouri) at t = 6 min. We used increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by Thap as a 
positive control of cell viability. Only cells exhibiting a positive response to Thap were 
subsequently analyzed for Flx effect. We analyzed Fura-2 ratio in the acquired images using 
Easy Ratio Pro software (PTI). We then represented Flx-induced decreased of intracellular 
Ca2+ levels as the area under the curve (AUC), calculated relatively to the lowest value of 
each curve.
Bone histomorphometry and micro-computed tomography
We dissolved calcein (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) in 0.15 M NaCl, 2% NaHCO3 and 
injected it intraperitoneally at 0.025 mg/g body weight on days 1 and 4, then we sacrificed 
mice on day 6. For bone histomorphometric analysis, we fixed L3–L4 vertebrae and tibiae 
for 24_hours in 10% formalin, dehydrated them in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded 
them in methyl methacrylate resin. We performed a Von Kossa/van Gieson staining on 7 μm 
sections for the quantification of bone volume over tissue volume (BV/TV) using the ImageJ 
software (Bethesda, Maryland). We took the pictures using a Leica DM400B (Wetzlar, 
Germany) or Olympus BX53 (Tokyo, Japan). We analyzed bone formation rate (BFR) on 
5μm sections using calcein labeling. For analysis of the parameters of osteoblasts and 
osteoclasts, we stained 5μm sections with toluidine blue and tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRAP), respectively. We performed histomorphometry analysis using the 
Osteomeasure Analysis System from Osteometrics (Atlanta, Georgia). We performed micro-
computed tomography to analyze trabecular morphological parameters of the proximal tibia 
(VivaCT 40, Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Briefly, energy settings were 
55 kV, and 109 μA, and reconstructed images had a 10.5 μm isotropic voxel size. The region 
of interest was defined starting at the growth plate and extending approximately 1 mm 
distally. Prior to analysis, a Gaussian filter was applied (sigma =.8, support =1) to reduce 
noise. A global threshold of 30% of the maximum gray scale value was used to classify 
bone. Standard Scanco evaluation software utilizing a distance transformation method was 
used in the calculation of output variables.
Marble burying test
We performed tests 1 day before sacrifice. We placed twenty glass marbles, evenly spaced in 
five rows, on approx. 5-cm layer of sawdust bedding lightly pressed down to make a flat 
even surface, in a plastic cage. Then, we placed the mouse in the cage and left it for 30min 
after which the number of marbles buried with sawdust was counted63,64.
Statistical analysis
We expressed all values as mean + SEM. We determined group sizes by performing a power 
calculation to lead to an 80% chance of detecting a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05). All 
values use biological replicates and are indicated by group size (n) in figure legends or 
within bar graphs. For in vivo data, each “n” corresponds to a single mouse. For in vitro 
data, each “n” corresponds an independent experiment. If technical replicates were 
performed their mean was considered as one “n”. Statistical analyses were performed using 
one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s or Dunnet’s multiple comparison tests to compare

two groups. Variances were similar between groups. In all figures *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, 
***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001. Analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad 
Software) for ANOVA and Excel (Microsoft) for Student’s t -test.

 diagram of Flx mechanism of action on bone remodeling. Flx directly acts on osteoclasts to 
limit the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of the c-Fos-Nfatc1 cascade causing a 
decrease in bone resorption ➀, independently of 5HTT. Also, through its inhibition of 
serotonin reuptake by 5HTT, Flx increases brain serotonin post-synaptic signaling causing 
the desensitization of Htr2c ➁. As a result, sympathetic output increases, bone resorption 
increases and bone formation decreases. Upon a short exposure to fluoxetine the direct effect 
➀ is predominant causing an increase in bone mass by decreasing bone resorption. 
Following a longer treatment, direct ➀ and central ➁ effects counteract each other in term 
of bone resorption while bone formation decreases, causing bone loss. The deleterious 
central effect of fluoxetine ➁ on bone remodeling can be prevented by a co-treatment with 
propranolol, which blocks the increase in Adrb2 signaling in osteoblasts caused by the 
higher sympathetic tone.
