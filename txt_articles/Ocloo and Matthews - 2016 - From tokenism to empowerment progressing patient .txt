ABSTRACT
Background There have been repeated calls to
better involve patients and the public and to
place them at the centre of healthcare. Serious
clinical and service failings in the UK and
internationally increase the urgency and
importance of addressing this problem. Despite
this supportive policy context, progress to achieve
greater involvement is patchy and slow and often
concentrated at the lowest levels of involvement.
Methods A selective narrative literature search
was guided by the authors’ broad expertise,
covering a range of disciplines across health and
social care, policy and research. Published
systematic literature reviews were used to identify
relevant authors and publications. Google and
hand searches of journal articles and reference
lists and reports augmented identification of
recent evidence.
Results Patients and the wider public can be
involved at most stages of healthcare, and this
can have a number of benefits. Uncertainty
persists about why and how to do involvement
well and evaluate its impact, how to involve and
support a diversity of individuals, and in ways
that allow them to work in partnership to
genuinely influence decision-making. This
exposes patient and public involvement (PPI) to
criticisms of exclusivity and tokenism.
Conclusions Current models of PPI are too
narrow, and few organisations mention
empowerment or address equality and diversity in
their involvement strategies. These aspects of
involvement should receive greater attention, as
well as the adoption of models and frameworks
that enable power and decision-making to be
shared more equitably with patients and the public
in designing, planning and co-producing
healthcare.
INTRODUCTION
Repeated calls have been made to engage
and involve patients and the public and
to place them at the centre of healthcare.
Serious clinical and service failings in the
UK1 2 and internationally3–5 increase the
urgency and importance of addressing
this
problem.6–8
Developing
stronger
patient and public involvement (PPI) in
the organisation and delivery of health-
care is now central to health reform
across W
estern economies.9–11 This rec-
ognition reflects evidence that patients
and the wider public can be involved and
make a difference at most stages
of
healthcare and in service planning and
delivery.12 This, however, does not mean
that all patients choose to be involved or
indeed should have to be responsible for
monitoring care, or indeed may not even
be the most reliable way to do this, given
their vulnerable condition.13 Despite this
supportive policy context, progress to
achieve greater involvement is patchy and
slow and often concentrated at the lowest
levels of involvement. By this we mean
that consultation is more often the norm,
than collaboration.10 14–16 Some health-
care professionals and organisations have
not embraced the idea of partnership
with patients and even feel threatened by
the notion of active involvement.10
17
Though individuals, teams and organisa-
tions may be interested and deeply com-
mitted to involving patients and family
members, they may lack clarity about
what the issues are, who to involve and
the goals of involvement.18 19
METHODS
This article drew upon a selective narra-
tive review20 of various sources of infor-
mation and evidence connected to PPI.
This was not meant to be a systematic
review. W
e searched for literature up to
March 2016 and omitted any literature

tematic literature reviews to identify relevant authors

and methods about the benefits and difficulties with
involvement

this field informed the analysis and synthesis of the
overview.
RESULTS
A growing body of evidence suggests that patients can
be involved and contribute to healthcare in various
ways: from helping to reach an accurate diagnosis,
choosing an appropriate treatment, management strat-
egy or safe provider, ensuring treatment is properly
adhered to and monitored and identifying adverse
events and side effects and acting upon them.12 21
Involving patients, their families and the public can
also have a number of benefits: improving patient
choice, self-care and shared decision-making (SDM)
contributing to research partnerships and changes to
service delivery and patient outcomes.19
22
23 The
involvement process has also been seen as an import-
ant way in healthcare systems of enhancing democratic
principles and accountability.24 25 However, PPI often
appears to be trapped in a vicious cycle. Uncertainty
exists about why and how to do involvement well and
how to involve and support a diversity of patients and
the public, rather than a few selected individuals. The
reality of implementation is complex and yields sub-
optimal evidence of impact.22 26 This fuels the cycle
of predictable and disappointing results and exposes
PPI to criticisms of exclusivity and tokenism.16 27–29
This article presents our reflections on these issues
and explains why we think changing the balance of
power, promoting empowerment, diversity and equal-
ity, and strengthening evaluation of outcomes and
impact are the neglected aspects of involvement that,
if given due attention, can offer a way to break the
cycle.
The purpose and value of involvement
Different
words,
theories
and
approaches
have
emerged from disparate social movements, policies
and practices to describe the involvement process,30
for example, consultation, engagement, participation,
partnership or co-production. These have sometimes
been used to imply a greater or lesser level of involve-
ment, power or influence in decision-making pro-
cesses within an organisation. However, this language
does not always reflect the underlying ethos of these
involvement activities.31 In the absence of consensus
on terminology,30 we define involvement as an activity
that is done ‘with’ or ‘by’ patients or members of the
public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them.32 This
definition sees the involvement process as a partner-
ship between patients, the public and health profes-
sionals.
This
is
important
given
major
power
differentials exist between those involved in a lay cap-
acity and paid healthcare professionals.
At its core, the purpose of any involvement activity
should be to improve the health and the experience of
services for patients, their relatives, carers and users of
health and social care services as well as the wider
public.31 Figure 133 provides a typical organising
framework for involvement (the term engagement is
used in this framework) that shows involvement can
take place at multiple levels.
It can range along a continuum, from consultation
to partnership and shared leadership. At the lower
end, patients are involved but have limited power or
decision-making authority. At the higher end, involve-
ment is characterised by shared power and responsibil-
ity, with patients as active partners in defining agendas
and making decisions. PPI can also occur at the level
of individual health behaviour or direct care, or can

family engagement in health and healthcare.33 This figure
builds upon Arnstein’s34 widely quoted ‘ladder of citizen
participation’. This described “a continuum of public
participation in governance ranging from limited participation,
or degrees of tokenism, to a state of collaborative partnership in
which citizens share leadership or control decisions”.33

 occur at the collective level in organisational design
and governance and in policymaking. W
e argue other
areas can include commissioning, monitoring, evalu-
ation and research. Multiple factors affect the willing-
ness and ability of patients to engage at these different
levels, including patient beliefs about their role, health
literacy, education, organisational policies and prac-
tices and culture, society and social norms, regulation
and policy. W
e believe that issues to do with inequal-
ity, discrimination and social exclusion also play a
strong
role
in
preventing
many
individuals
and
groups, participating in the involvement process as
indicated in table 1.
Understanding the role of power in involvement
Many authors capture the history and evolution of
involvement and demonstrate that multiple influences
and ideas have shaped this activity.30
39–41 Global
health
social
movements42
and
disenfranchised
groups,
including
black,
disabled,
mental
health,
lesbian and gay, and women’s groups, can be seen as
providing collective challenges to poor care and dis-
criminatory
or
paternalistic
services
and
medical
policy and belief systems.42 These rights-based groups
first emerged in healthcare and in other parts of the
public sector in the UK as far back as the 1970s.
Campaigns from patients who have been harmed
during their care, and their relatives, are only the
most recent manifestation of these challenges to pater-
nalistic healthcare. These campaigns have been rein-
forced by wider arguments that also emerged in the
late 1970s, emphasising the limitations of a biomed-
ical model in promoting health and illness43–45 and
calling for more shared models of treatment and
decision-making.46
47 Other concerns during this
period highlighted a need to address poorer and
unequal access to healthcare for some groups48 49 as
well as the role of the professions in healthcare
Table 1
Summary of barriers and enablers for involvement27
Key exclusions
Key barriers
Overcoming barriers
Equality and discrimination: barriers on the basis
of gender, ethnicity, culture, belief, sexuality,
age, disability and class.
Devaluing people: not valuing or listening to
what people say.
Access: ensuring all participants have effective ways
into organisations and decision-making structures
to have a real say in them.
Where people live:
Homeless.
In residential services.
In prison and the penal system.
Travellers/gypsies.
Tokenism: asking for involvement but not taking
it seriously or enabling it to be effective.
Support: building confidence/skills, offering
practical help/opportunities to get together to
support people’s empowerment and capacity.Use
of advocacy: important for people who are
disempowered and isolated.
Communication issues:
Deaf people.
Blind/visually impaired people.
People who do not communicate verbally.
People for whom English is not their first
language.
Unwanted voices: Some points of views/
experiences are more welcome than others
(particularly those who agree or are less
challenging of the system or services). People
can also be excluded because they are seen as
too expensive/difficult to include such as those
with dementia.
Stigma: stigmatising people for their identity or
why they became involved or because they
have had a poor experience of care35 and
discouraging involvement on the basis of their
identity.
Confidence and self-esteem: making people feel
they do not have much to contribute.
Inadequate information about involvement:
Lack of appropriate and accessible information
about getting involved or about the involvement
opportunities.36
Different forms of involvement: using innovative
approaches that go beyond traditional methods:
meetings, surveys, written and verbal
skills. Different methods include: entertainment
organised by lay participants, offering safe
opportunities to explore ideas. Supportive activities,
informal venues and encouraging networking.
Outreach and development work: reaching out to
those traditionally identified as ‘hard to reach’,
going to them and community leaders, building
trust, asking what works.Meetings where used:
making them attractive, inclusive, enjoyable, with
free refreshments that are culturally appropriate,
safe, supportive environment, with access to key
knowledge.
Issues of poor health literacy:
this can be an important determinant of access
to healthcare, impacting upon patients ability to
book, cancel/attend appointments, respond to
an adverse error in their care or medication or a
deterioration in their care.37
Gatekeepers/individuals who block the
involvement process: individuals who obstruct
the involvement process by their attitudes or
actions and stop people getting involved.
Tools to support patient empowerment38
Motivational interviewing: used by clinicians/
non-clinicians, personal budgets, expert patient
(self-management) programme, patient decision
aids in shared decisions, helping people prepare for
consultations, access to health records.
Achieving greater health literacy in the
population is integral to improving the health of
disadvantaged populations and to tackling
health inequalities.23
Financial barriers: not paying participants for
their involvement (which is a widely accepted
principle) and speedily can deter people with
limited resources or high costs because of the
nature of their situation or impairment from
being involved.
Good practice regarding health literacy37
Improving communication with all patients can
include: ascertaining what the patient knows first
to determine level of discussion.
Speaking slowly, avoiding jargon, repeating points
to improve comprehension, encourage and expect
all patients to ask questions.Check understanding
and recall. Ask patients to repeat back critical info
(making clear this is about the health
professionals’ ability to communicate clearly).
Communicate in ways other than speech/printed
material, eg, multimedia, translation services/
materials.

 iatrogenesis.50 51 These arguments are still relevant
today as we discuss later in the paper. In practice,
what they illustrate are various examples where the
balance of power apparently favours the organisation
or system, rather than partnership working with
patients and the public.52
With current involvement practice, power imbal-
ances
frequently manifest
themselves in different
ways, starting with who to involve. PPI often involves
a narrow group of individuals, with the handpicking
of just one or two ‘appropriate’ or ‘acquiescent’29
patient representatives to be involved in committees
or projects. Patient representatives are less commonly
drawn from black and minority ethnic groups,27 53 54
and are often middle class.9 29 31 Yet in the UK,53 55
and “in most healthcare systems, it is acknowledged
that black and minority ethnic (BME) populations
have until now experienced poorer health and barriers
to accessing certain services”.56 57 Many other differ-
ent groups are also excluded from involvement pro-
cesses (table 1). These groups may have particular or
even greater healthcare needs than the wider popula-
tion,58 59 yet their views are seldom heard or listened
to.16 27 28 60 In reality, the capacity to be successfully
involved is significantly affected by education level,
income,
cognitive
skills
and
cultural
differences,
which can affect patients’ health beliefs and ability to
use health services.12 61 The consequences of narrow
PPI selection processes mean that those with most to
gain are most excluded from healthcare decision-
making. This restricts the pool of ideas for improve-
ment and limits the opportunity to break cycles of
suboptimal care and services.
At the organisational level, factors that can hinder
PPI in service planning and decision-making include
laypeople feeling unclear about their role and what is
expected of them, a shortage of resources to support
the process, concerns about representation, negative
attitudes27 and resistance from healthcare staff and
managers12 17 29 62 (table 1).
In the UK, it has been suggested that the majority of
involvement activity in healthcare has traditionally
taken place at the level of feedback and information
giving.63 Shared forms of decision-making, which
have been found to have proven health benefits,64 are
still not the norm.65 Internationally, there is evidence
that shows that patient representatives are struggling
to influence decisions and are largely expected to
work within existing systems in improving quality and
safety.61 Involvement at this level has been criticised
as providing little opportunity to influence decision-
making processes in any depth. This serves to main-
tain
professional
and
system
interests
and
power.10 34 47
Current models of PPI are therefore too often
rooted in a mechanistic, controlled and professionally
dominated approach, based upon a very practical and
atheoretical way to getting someone’s input. This
narrow ‘managerialist or consumerist’ model10 has its
roots in market research and ‘improving the product’,
which has typically come to dominate approaches to
PPI. It mainly draws upon data collection methods
and consultation and the reporting of patient survey
data at board meetings. This contrasts with a wider
democratic rights and values-based approach, which
emphasises the need for the direct involvement and
empowerment of users of services in the decision-
making process and broader democratisation at a com-
munity level. Such an approach goes beyond just a
focus on individuals as the source of the problem and
recognises the systemic nature of health inequities and
how different groups can be excluded. Democratic
models focus on the need for change to take place
within social systems as well as within individuals and
services.66
Linking theory and evidence for empowerment and
impact
Broader frameworks and methods of involvement
should be used that offer better ways to share power
with
healthcare
professionals.
Central
goals
of
involvement should focus on issues of inclusivity and
representation,
equalities,
non-discrimination
and
empowerment. It has been recognised that different
levels of participation are appropriate in different cir-
cumstances.63 But it is clearly important to think
about which level is important and how it will influ-
ence decision-making. In current PPI practice, there
appears to be a considerable disconnection with much
of this thinking and how it can be used to achieve
clarity of purpose in much of mainstream healthcare.
This situation is worse in areas such as patient safety,
where PPI is largely atheoretical.61
At the organisational and community level, models
of co-production are increasingly being seen as a way
of addressing power imbalances by designing and deli-
vering public services in more democratic, equal and
reciprocal relationships between professionals, people
using services, their families and their neighbours.67 68
There is no one ‘correct’ way of doing co-production,
but there are six principles that help to underpin
practice:
A. assets: recognising people as assets;
B. capabilities: building on people’s existing strengths;
C. mutuality: reciprocal relations with mutual responsibil-
ities and expectations;
D. networks: peer support and engaging a range of net-
works inside and outside services;
E. blur roles: removing tightly defined boundaries between
professionals and recipients to enable shared control and
responsibility;
F
.
catalysts: shift from delivering services to supporting
things to happen.67 69 70
This more collaborative framework can also support
methods to empower patients at the individual level.

 been identified: (a) empowering individuals in their
own care; (b) reviving the revolution in decision-
making tools as part of a systematic drive in shared
decision-making (SDM) (SDM offers a process where
patients and clinicians can work together to select
tests, treatments, access personal health records and
health budgets, care planning and decision aids, man-
agement or support packages based on clinical evi-
dence and the patient’s informed preferences).64 65
The latter is particularly important in preventing mis-
diagnosis and unwanted interventions.);71 (c) giving
patients co-ownership of their records, not just access;
and (d) encouraging patients to ask more questions
and targeting a national campaign for people with
long-term conditions and offering greater access to
structured education on self-management. Tackling
health literacy has also been found to be central to the
empowerment
of
patients
and
reducing
health
inequalities.23 T
able 1 provides examples of tools and
ways to develop empowering practice with a diversity
of groups at the individual and organisational level.
Empowering users and providers and supporting
frontline staff to feel confident in sharing power and
accepting user expertise will be crucial in developing
these
more
shared
and
collaborative
ways
of
working.72
This
is
important
given
that
time,
resources and funding17 and competing organisational
priorities and a lack of training for clinical providers
have been identified as key barriers in the implemen-
tation of PPI strategies.73
Finding effective ways to evaluate PPI processes are
also important to ensure a wider range of expertise
and experiences are included in PPI activities. There
are a number of factors that make evaluation in this
area challenging: the need for a shared understanding
of PPI in practice and how it is conceptualised and
measured, limited documentation of underpinning
theory19 and the difficulty in isolating involvement
from other factors that influence change.18 Within the
democratic tradition, less emphasis has traditionally
been placed on measuring PPI as involvement is seen
as something that has intrinsic value in and of itself,
over and above any attempt to measure it from an
instrumental perspective. W
e suggest national involve-
ment standards such as 4Pi31 (table 2) could provide a
broader, inclusive framework by which to support
good practice in the development of PPI approaches
and interventions as well as to understand the effects
of PPI. 4Pi draws on research evidence and user
experience to identify the characteristics and attributes
of meaningful involvement. This framework, in com-
bination with a sound understanding of evaluation
principles,74 could support the generation of better
evidence.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings point to a need to re-evaluate methods
and approaches for involving patients and the public
in all aspects of healthcare and in healthcare improve-
ment. Partnership working has long been the explicit
stated goal of involvement. However, current involve-
ment practices at a national and local level often
involve a narrow group of individuals in involvement
activities, with little consideration given to including a
broader demographic of the population.
Moving
beyond this tokenistic, narrow and exclusive approach
requires a critical appraisal of evidence and a debate
about the focus and methods of involvement. Use of
broader and more democratic models is important to
address imbalances of power between patients, public
and
healthcare
professionals
and
organisations.
Evaluating these approaches, to understand the impact
and effectiveness of chosen PPI methods, as well as
how inclusive they are, is important. Developing
greater partnership working will require key policy
organisations and networks to take a lead in promot-
ing this broader approach, disseminating good practice
and
evidence
and
building
in
requirements
into
funding streams.
Ultimately to deliver a broader and more effective
approach to involvement, staff will need to be trained
and supported within organisational contexts where
partnership working with a diversity of patients and
the public is clear, embedded and normal. Moving
beyond tokenism to sharing power and decision-
making more equitably will promote empowerment
and help develop models of healthcare that are more
co-designed
and
co-produced
between
all
stake-
holders, regardless of whether they are using or pro-
viding services.

influence31
Component
Supportive attributes for inclusion and
empowerment
Principles
Involvement is underpinned by values, eg, inclusivity and
non-discrimination, respect and transparency and being
open-minded to cultural differences.
Purpose
The purpose should be clearly articulated so that
everybody understands the goal of involvement and has
the opportunity to shape and influence the process.
Presence
Who to involve will be determined by the purpose. This
means an inclusive approach that seeks to address
inequalities.
Process
Involvement in direct care for example, will require
different approaches to involvement than at the collective/
organisational level. Consultation methods will deliver
different results by comparison with co-design or
co-production approaches.
Impact
Impact can be considered in different ways, eg, on
individual conduct as well as on organisational culture,
policy/planning, outcomes, outputs, diversity and equality
of opportunity and the experience of service users.
