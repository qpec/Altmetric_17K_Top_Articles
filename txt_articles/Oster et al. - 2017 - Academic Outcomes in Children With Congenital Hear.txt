A
s infant morbidity and mortality for children with con-
genital heart defects (CHD) has decreased over the past 
40 years, there has been an increased focus on improving the 
overall quality of life for these children.1,2 One essential com-
ponent of improving the lives of these children is understand-
ing their neurocognitive outcomes.3 Indeed, the American 
Heart Association in 2012 issued guidelines for the surveil-
lance, screening, evaluation, reevaluation, and management of 
such outcomes in children with CHD.4
To date, however, most studies evaluating neurocogni-
tive outcomes in children with CHD have focused only on 
high-risk patients or have used specialized, resource-intensive 
testing. On the basis of the rigorous developmental and psy-
chological testing methods such as the Bayley Scales of Infant 
Development, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 
Psychomotor Development Index, or the Developmental 
Test of Visual-Motor Integration, we know that children with 
critical heart defects such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome 
or transposition of the great arteries who require surgery in 
infancy are at increased risk of poor neurocognitive outcomes 
in childhood.5–14 However, CHD patients requiring surgery in 
infancy represent only a subset of all CHD patients, and per-
forming such testing on the entire population of children with 
CHD is not feasible or cost-effective. Furthermore, the results 
of these tests do not necessarily translate into the real-world 
outcomes that are of greatest interest to parents, most nota-
bly school performance. Thus, there are important knowledge 
gaps on the neurocognitive outcomes among children with 
less severe forms of CHD and on the school performance of 
children with CHD.
By linking state educational records with birth defects 
registries and birth certificates, we can address these knowl-
edge gaps by conducting large-scale neurocognitive studies 
in patients with known birth defects.15–17 The purpose of our 
study, therefore, was to use state educational records to deter-
mine the association of CHD with academic outcomes and 
Background—Most studies evaluating neurocognitive outcomes in children with congenital heart defects (CHD) have 
focused on high-risk patients or used specialized, resource-intensive testing. To determine the association of CHD with 
academic outcomes and compare outcomes according to the severity of CHD, we linked state educational records with a 
birth defects registry and birth certificates.
Methods and Results—We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the North Carolina Birth Defects 
Monitoring Program, North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, and North Carolina Department of Health 
and Human Services vital records. We performed logistic regression, adjusting for maternal education, race/ethnicity, 
enrollment in public pre-Kindergarten, and gestational age, to determine the association of CHD with not meeting 
standards on reading and math end-of-grade examinations in third grade in 2006 to 2012. Of 5624 subjects with CHD 
and 10 832 with no structural birth defects, 2807 (50%) and 6355 (59%) were linked, respectively. Children with CHD 
had 1.24× the odds of not meeting standards in either reading or math (95% confidence interval, 1.12–1.37), with 44.6% 
of children with CHD not meeting standards in at least one of these areas compared with 37.5% without CHD. Although 
children with both critical and noncritical CHD had poorer outcomes, those with critical CHD were significantly more 
likely to receive exceptional services compared with the noncritical group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.15–1.86).
Conclusions—Children with all types of CHD have poorer academic outcomes compared with their peers. Evaluation 
for exceptional services should be considered in children with any type of CHD.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes.

to compare such outcomes according to the severity of CHD. 
We hypothesized that children with CHD would have poorer 
academic performance than children without CHD, and that 
children with more severe forms of CHD would have poorer 
academic performance than children with less severe forms.
Methods
Study Design
We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study using 
data from the North Carolina Birth Defects Monitoring Program 
(NCBDMP), the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction 
(NCDPI), and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human 
Services vital records. Since 1987, the NCBDMP has collected infor-
mation about major structural birth defects in live births identified ≤1 
year of age via an active, population-based surveillance system.18 For 
classification of heart defects, the NCBDMP uses the system devel-
oped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on the 
British Paediatric Association codes, a system that has been shown 
to be superior to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, for the identification of heart defects.19 The NCDPI col-
lects information on end-of-grade testing, academic promotion, and 
receipt of exceptional services (individualized educational plans for 
children with disabilities) for all children in public schools in NC. In 
NC, end-of-grade testing in reading and math is administered to all 
public school students in third through eighth grades, with students 
being required to demonstrate grade-level proficiency in grades 3, 5, 
and 8 for academic promotion. Because the study used existing data 
only, it was considered exempt by the North Carolina Department 
of Public Health Institutional Review Board, and only individuals 
authorized by the North Carolina Department of Public Health had 
access to confidential information.
Cohorts
All children born in the years 1998 to 2003 and identified with CHD 
via International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes in 
the NCBDMP were linked to the educational records from NCDPI 
and birth certificate records from NC. Staff at NCDPI matched re-
cords from the NCBDMP and school records using a deterministic 
linkage algorithm in SAS, using child’s first and last name, date of 
birth, and sex as matching variables. Matches were verified using the 
last 4 digits of the child’s social security number. Children with the 
known chromosomal anomalies were excluded because these chil-
dren often have other severe developmental disabilities that would 
likely impact the outcomes of interest. Cases of CHD were further 
subclassified as critical or noncritical according to the diagnosis. In a 
manner consistent with similar analyses in this population, a case was 
deemed critical if a child had one or more of the following: coarcta-
tion of the aorta, d-transposition of the great arteries, double outlet 
right ventricle, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, 
interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia, single ventricle, tetral-
ogy of Fallot, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, tricuspid 
atresia, or truncus arteriosus.1 A non-CHD group was generated by 
a random sampling of NC birth certificates of children born 1998 to 
2003 who were not known to have any birth defects, and these records 
were similarly linked with the educational records from the NCDPI. 
Reasons for inability to link include migration out of the state, not be-
ing in public school in the third grade, taking alternate testing instead 
of standardized testing, change in name, or death before third grade.
Outcomes of Interest
Our primary outcome of interest was performance, reported as 
achievement levels, on the reading and math end-of-grade examina-
tions administered in NC public schools at the end of third grade in 
years 2006 to 2012. Achievement scores were classified as either a 
level 1 to 2, indicating that the student has limited or partial command 
of the NC grade-level content matter, or a 3 to 4, indicating a solid or 
superior command of grade-level content. We dichotomized achieve-
ment scores as does not meet grade-level proficiency standard (levels 
1 and 2) versus meets grade-level proficiency standard (levels 3 and 
4). Performance in the third grade was chosen because (1) this period 
is the earliest that standardized mathematics and reading comprehen-
sion examinations are administered in NC and (2) the performance in 
the third grade is a well-established predictor of long-term success, 
including graduating from high school.20 Our secondary outcomes of 
interest included retention at the end of third grade and receipt of 
exceptional services in the third grade.
Statistical Analyses
After describing the distribution of confounders among the cohorts, 
we estimated the odds of each of our outcomes and 95% confidence 
intervals among children with CHD compared with children with-
out a structural birth defect using logistic regression in our primary 
analysis. In subsequent secondary analyses, we stratified our analyses 
by critical versus noncritical CHD comparing outcomes among those 
with critical CHD or noncritical CHD versus those without structural 
birth defects, and those with critical CHD versus those with noncriti-
cal CHD. Finally, we modeled our outcomes of interest among those 
children with and without additional noncardiac defects versus those 
without any structural birth defects. In each model, we performed a 
complete case analysis and included the following covariates of inter-
est chosen a priori: maternal education level (obtained from the birth 
certificate), race/ethnicity (obtained from the birth certificate), enroll-
ment in public pre-Kindergarten (obtained from NCDPI records), and 
gestational age (obtained from the birth certificate). All analyses were 
performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC).
Results
Of the 5624 subjects with CHD and 10 832 with no struc-
tural birth defects, 2807 (50%) and 6355 (59%) were linked, 
respectively, to the third-grade educational records and com-
prise our study cohorts. Among the CHD group, those who 
did not link with a third-grade educational record were more 
likely to be Hispanic or non-Hispanic white than those who 
did link, and the 2 CHD groups were similar in respect to sex, 
maternal education, and gestational age. In comparing the 
linked CHD group with the cohort of children without struc-
tural birth defects, the 2 groups were similar with respect to 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Children with CHD are at risk for poor neurocog-
nitive outcomes. Current American Heart Associa-
tion guidelines recommend routine neurocognitive 
screening only for those children with critical CHD, 
that is, those with cyanosis or who required surgery 
during infancy.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Children with CHD have poorer performance on 
end-of-grade testing in reading and math in the third 
grade compared with children without birth defects.
• Poor testing performance is seen not only in children 
with critical CHD but also in those with noncritical 
CHD.
• Children with noncritical CHD may benefit from 
better recognition and treatment of potential neuro-
cognitive deficits

sex and percentage enrollment in public pre-Kindergarten. 
Those with CHD were less likely to be non-Hispanic white, 
less likely to have mothers who completed high school by the 
time of delivery, and were born on average 2 weeks earlier 
than those without CHD (Table 1). Among the CHD cohort, 
the most common diagnoses were atrial septal defect and ven-
tricular septal defect (Table 2).
In the comparison of those with CHD versus those with-
out any known structural birth defects, those with CHD had 
poorer outcomes (Table 3). Children with CHD were more 
likely not to meet standards in both reading and math, with 
44.6% of those in the CHD group not meeting standards in 
at least one of these areas when compared with 37.5% in 
the non-CHD group. Similarly, those with CHD were more 
likely to have received exceptional services (20.5% versus 
12.5%). Although a higher percentage of children with CHD 
were retained in the third grade, this did not meet statistical 
significance.
We then performed separate analyses comparing children 
with critical CHD and noncritical CHD separately to those 
without known structural birth defects (Table 4). Of the 2807 
with CHD, 463 (16.5%) had critical CHD, and 2344 had only 
noncritical CHD. Both those with critical CHD and noncriti-
cal CHD were more likely than children without structural 
birth defects to not meet standards in at least reading or math 
(adjusted Odds ratio [OR], 1.43 and 1.20, respectively) and 
to have received exceptional services (adjusted OR, 2.24 
and 1.51, respectively). Although there were slightly higher 
percentages of children with critical CHD and noncritical 
CHD being retained in the third grade when compared with 
those without any structural birth defects, these differences 
did not meet statistical significance. When we compared 
those with critical CHD to those with noncritical CHD, we 
found that those with critical CHD were slightly more likely 
to fail reading or math and much more likely to receive 
exceptional services. There was no difference in the third-
grade retention.

 4  Oster et al  Academic Outcomes in Congenital Heart Defects 
In our final analyses, we subdivided those with CHD 
into those without any other structural birth defects and 
those with other noncardiac defects (Table 5). Of the 2807 
with CHD, 2215 did not have any additional structural birth 
defects and 592 did (21.1%). Compared with those without 
any structural birth defects, both groups were more likely not 
to meet standards in reading or math (adjusted OR, 1.19 and 
1.48) and to receive exceptional services (adjusted OR, 1.46 
and 2.40) with the larger effect sizes in the group with addi-
tional noncardiac defects. Those with only CHD were not 
more likely than children without any known structural birth 
defects to be retained in third grade, but those with CHD 
and additional structural birth defects were (adjusted OR, 
1.73). When we compared those with CHD with additional 
noncardiac defects to those with only CHD, we found that 
those with additional noncardiac defects were slightly more 
likely to fail reading or math and much more likely to receive 
exceptional services. There was no difference in the third-
grade retention.
Discussion
In this study, the largest of its kind to study educational out-
comes in children with CHD, we found that children with 
CHD have poorer performance on end-of-grade testing in 
reading and math in the third grade and have higher receipt 
of exceptional services. Interestingly, this poorer perfor-
mance in reading and math was seen in both the critical and 
noncritical CHD cohorts, yet children with noncritical CHD 
were less likely to receive exceptional services than those 
with critical CHD.
Although this study confirms the findings of previous 
studies that children with critical heart defects have poorer 
neurocognitive outcomes than children without birth defects, 
it raises the notion that children with milder defects may, too, 
have significant challenges. Historically, it has been thought 
that the majority of children with mild or moderate CHD 
would not have any developmental disabilities.13 Indeed, in 
the 2012 American Heart Association guidelines for the eval-
uation and management of neurodevelopmental outcomes in

 5  Oster et al  Academic Outcomes in Congenital Heart Defects 
children with CHD, the only heart defects deemed to place 
a child at high risk for a developmental disorder or disabil-
ity were those with cyanosis or that required surgery during 
infancy.4 In our study, there were similar rates of not meeting 
standards in reading or math (≈45%) between the critical and 
noncritical CHD groups and similar rates of being retained in 
the third grade (≈3%). However, 25% of the children with crit-
ical CHD were receiving exceptional services, but only 20% 
of those with noncritical CHD were receiving such services. 
It seems that the academic challenges faced by children with 
noncritical CHD may be underappreciated.
Previous studies using educational records to examine 
outcomes in children with CHD have found similar results to 
ours. In a study of 256 patients in Arkansas, Mulkey et al21 
found that children with CHD had lower scores on school-
age achievement tests and an 8-fold increase in the receipt of 
special education services. As this study was limited to chil-
dren who had surgery in the first year of life, comparisons on 
outcomes for children with milder forms of CHD are not pos-
sible. In a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
study of the use of special education services among children 
in Metropolitan Atlanta, Riehle-Colarusso et al22 found that 
children with CHD were 50% more likely to receive such 
services when compared with children without birth defects, 
with children with critical CHD having only a slightly higher 
likelihood when compared with those with noncritical CHD. 
This study did not examine school testing or grade reten-
tion. Finally, in an evaluation of children in Georgia who had 
undergone surgery for CHD, Oster et al23 found that children 
with a history of CHD surgery had poorer performance on 
math and social studies testing than their peers without CHD, 
but that there was no difference between those in the higher 
surgical risk categories compared with those in the lower.
The rationale as to why children with CHD may be at risk 
for poor neurocognitive outcomes is complex. There are many 
theories to explain this increased risk, including hypoxia, use 
of cardiac bypass, and type of anesthesia, with these effects 
particularly pronounced in the immature neonatal brain.12 
However, children with milder forms of CHD do not typi-
cally have hypoxia or surgical risk factors in infancy. What 
children with noncritical CHD may share with their critical 
CHD counterparts, however, is a similar genetic predisposi-
tion for certain outcomes. The impact of genotype on survival 
and clinical outcomes has been well established.24–26 Now, 
however, it has been suggested that certain genotypes may be 
associated not only with CHD but also with neurodevelop-
ment. Homsy et al27 studied the exome sequencing of 1213 
CHD parent–offspring trios and found that there were shared 
genetic contributions for CHD and neurodevelopmental dis-
abilities. Similar genetic predisposition to certain neurodevel-
opmental outcomes among differing cardiac phenotypes may 
help explain our findings.
This study is not without its limitations. First, our study is 
limited to children who attend public schools. Children in pri-
vate schools or home schools are not tracked via these educa-
tional methods, and we thus have no data on that subset of the 
population. Self-selection of public school by families of chil-
dren with CHD for the purposes such as obtaining exceptional 
services or because of financial constraints already on these 
families from chronic illness may skew our results. Second, 
we do not have information on children who are not able to 
take the end-of-grade testing. Children who are not able to 
take the standard end-of-grade testing may be placed in alter-
native testing. Although we know what portion during this 
timeframe underwent alternate testing (11% of children with 
CHD and 3% of children with no structural birth defects), data 
on the outcomes of such testing are not available, and thus 
these children were not included in our cohorts. Finally, the 
NCBDMP collects information on the diagnosis of CHD, but 
we have no information on the surgical interventions or clini-
cal outcomes. Thus, we are not able to investigate whether 
certain types of treatments, surgeries, or other interventions 
may be associated with educational outcomes; such investiga-
tions are certainly warranted in future studies.
By linking 3 large databases in NC, we were able to 
address important knowledge gaps on the neurocognitive out-
comes of children with CHD. These children face significant 
challenges in school performance, and these challenges are 
not limited to only that subset with critical CHD. Parents and 
providers of children with all types of CHD should be cogni-
zant of the academic obstacles these children may face and 
should consider evaluations for exceptional services.
