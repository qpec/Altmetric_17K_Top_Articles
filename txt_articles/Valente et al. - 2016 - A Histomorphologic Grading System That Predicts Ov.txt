Abstract: Diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is
rare and arises from peritoneal serosal surfaces. Although it
shares similar histomorphology with its counterpart, malignant
pleural mesothelioma, etiologies, clinical courses, and therapies
differ. Nuclear grading and level of mitoses have been correlated
with prognosis in malignant pleural mesothelioma with epi-
thelioid subtype. Whether nuclear grading and level of mitoses
correlate with prognosis in MPeM is still unknown. Our study
utilizes a 2 tier system incorporating nuclear features and level of
the mitoses to stratify cases of MPeM with epithelioid subtype.
Fifty-one cases of MPeM with clinical follow-up underwent
retrospective microscopic review. From that subset, 46 cases
were of epithelioid subtype, which were then stratified into a
low-grade or high-grade tier. Survival times were calculated on
the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis. The low-grade tier had
higher overall survival with a median of 11.9 years and 57% at 5
years when compared with the high-grade tier with a median of
3.3 years and 21% at 5 years (P = 0.002). Although not statis-
tically significant, the low-grade tier had higher progression-free
survival with a median of 4.7 years and 65% at 5 years when
compared with the high-grade tier with a median of 1.9 years
and 35% at 5 years (P = 0.089). Our study is first to specifically
evaluate and correlate nuclear features and level of mitoses with
overall survival in MPeM with epithelioid subtype.

M
alignant mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm arising
from the serosal surfaces of the pleura, peritoneum,
tunica vaginalis, and the pericardium. The majority of
mesothelioma cases are pleural based, with a strong cor-
relation to prior asbestos exposure.1,2 Diffuse malignant
peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is the second most
common site of origin, often with a very poor outcome, as
patients are frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage.3,4
An estimated 10% to 30% of all overall mesothelioma
diagnoses per year in the United States occur in the per-
itoneal cavity.5 The 3 main subtypes of malignant meso-
thelioma are epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic.4 The
most common subtype, the epithelioid subtype, has been
further divided into histologic patterns of tubulopapil-
lary, adenomatoid (microglandular), or solid.6 The 2004
World Health Organization Classification system adds a
fourth subtype, desmoplastic7; in addition, deciduoid,
clear cell, adenoid cystic, small cell, signet-ring cell, on-
cocytoid, rhabdoid, glomeruloid, and pleomorphic pat-
terns have also been described. Because of the uncommon
nature of this neoplasm, few studies have been performed
to correlate histologic features and overall outcome, and
most pathologic interpretations of cancer rely on specific
histologic parameters to provide data on prognosis and
staging with some evidence of correlation.3,8,9 Our group
has
considerable
experience
in
investigating
diffuse
MPeM including the cytopathologic aspects of the dis-
ease.10–13 A histomorphologic grading system for pleural
mesothelioma has been proposed in 2011 on the basis of
nuclear features and level of mitoses by Kadota et al.1 We
used the basis of that study to propose a 2-tier histo-
morphologic grading system to explore a correlation for
nuclear features and level of mitoses with survival in
diffuse MPeM of epithelioid morphology.

 spanning the period from 1984 to 2013. All of the patients in
our study received standard treatment for disseminated
peritoneal mesothelioma, which included cytoreductive sur-
gery, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemo-
therapy.2 The technique for the cytoreductive surgery is
described by Levine et al.14 Clinical information was ob-
tained from a database prospectively maintained by the
Surgical Oncology Service at Wake Forest Baptist Health.
The clinical information encompassed data elements in-
cluding sex, age, surgical assessment of resection, and the
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimen at first
surgery. Female patients with a history of ovarian carcinoma
or where primary serous carcinoma was suspected based on
overall clinical assessment were excluded from the cohort.
The categories for surgical assessment of resection (R0, R1,
R2a, R2b, and R2c) are specifically outlined by Stewart
et al.15 The types of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemo-
therapy regimen patients received were divided into those
regimens including mitomycin-C versus cisplatin. The eval-
uation of these specimens along with the associated clinical
information was approved by the Wake Forest School of
Medicine Institutional Review Board.
Retrospective microscopic examination was per-
formed by 2 experienced surgical pathologists and included
review of all available (median: 10, range: 1 to 75 slides/
case) hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides for a given pa-
tient before hyperthermic intraperitoneal adjuvant chemo-
therapy. The slides were derived from the initial biopsy and
standard cytoreductive large surgical specimen. Con-
firmation of peritoneal mesothelioma was obtained on the
basis of outside institution immunohistochemistry results or
clinical impression to support the diagnosis of peritoneal
mesothelioma. The cases with nonepithelioid morphology
were segmented from those of epithelioid subtype using an
Olympus BX41 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with
a standard eyepiece of 22mm diameter. For each case with
epithelioid morphology, nuclear atypia and mitoses were
examined. Discordance between pathologists in assessment
of nuclear atypia and/or mitotic activity was resolved by
review of the cases together, and a consensus on grading
was reached.
Nuclear atypia was evaluated using a high-power
field (HPF) at �400 magnification (0.237 mm2 field of
view). For nuclear atypia, the area with the highest degree
of atypia was recorded and only if it consisted of >5% of
the entire tumor. The vast majority of tumors exhibited
little to no heterogeneity. Tumors consisting of high-
grade zones within an overall low-grade tumor were not
included in the study, unless consisting of >5% of the
entire tumor. Considerations in the scoring for nuclear
atypia include: nuclear size, nuclear uniformity, shape,
membrane outlines and irregularity, nuclear to cytoplas-
mic (N/C) ratio, chromatin pattern, and prominence of
nucleoli. Prominence of nucleoli was evaluated using as
reference nearby red blood cells, which measured ap-
proximately 7 mm.
After factoring all these considerations, a nuclear
atypia score of 1, 2, or 3 was rendered. Mild atypia, or
score 1, included nuclei uniform in size and shape, low
N/C ratios, a chromatin pattern that was homogenous
with a fine granular pattern, and/or indistinct/incon-
spicuous or very small, distinct nucleoli (< 3 mm). Severe
atypia, or score 3, includes marked membrane irregu-
larities, bizarre contours, nuclear enlargement (at least
twice as large as others), marked variability in size and
shape, high N/C ratios, a coarsely granular chromatin
pattern, and/or prominent large nucleoli (>3 mm).
Mitoses
were
evaluated
in
50 HPF
areas
(11.85 mm2), with the highest mitotic activity identified
after scanning through all tumor slides and counted as an
average of mitotic figures per 10 HPF. To distinguish
mitotic figures from pyknotic cells, the following were
used: absence of a nuclear membrane or a central clear
zone, presence of hairy rather than triangular or spiky
projections, reflection of a mitotic spindle, and cytoplas-
mic basophilia rather than eosinophilia. Areas of necrosis
and prominent stromal fibrosis or inflammation were
avoided, whenever possible. In the cases in which only
small areas of viable tumor were available for review, the
best attempt was made to assess the equivalent of 10 full
HPFs of viable tumor for mitosis counting. A mitotic
score was rendered using the following cutoff values:
mitotic score 1 for 0 to 1/10 HPF, mitotic score 2 for 2 to
4/10 HPF, and mitotic score 3 for >5/10 HPF.
The summation of the nuclear atypia score and the
mitotic score resulted in the implementation of a 2-tier
system. The low-grade tier included cases with a total sum
of 3 or less. The high-grade tier included cases with a total
sum of 4 to 6, 6 being the maximum sum.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
times for the low-grade and high-grade groups from the
epithelioid subtype. If a patient died without a known date
of recurrence/progression, the patient’s length of pro-
gression-free time was calculated as being half of their
survival time; this midpoint approach avoids being po-
tentially too conservative (placing progression at date of
surgery) or too liberal (placing progression date at time of
death). This choice of progression-free time is routinely
used when the date of progression is unknown; using the
midpoint of the survival length prevents overestimation of
PFS that would likely occur by using date of death. Pa-
tients with R0, R1, and R2a defined groups (ranging from
no gross disease with negative microscopic margins up to
5 mm of residual tumor) were used in the PFS calcu-
lations. The aggregate of the R0, R1, and R2a defined
groups were deemed complete resections. Those patients
as defined as R2b and R2c (6 mm or greater in gross re-
sidual disease) were not considered to be disease free. The
aggregate of the R2b and R2c defined groups were deemed
incomplete resections. To assess differences in the study
groups, the log-rank test of the w2 approximation was
used, and a P-value <0.05 was deemed to be significant.

of epithelioid subtype and 5 cases of nonepithelioid

 morphology. Of the 46 cases of epithelioid subtype, 18
cases were classified in the low-grade tier, and 28 cases
were classified in the high-grade tier. Figures 1A and B
are representative images of cases in the low-grade tier
and Figures 2A and B are representative images of cases
in the high-grade tier. In the 5 cases of nonepithelioid
morphology, 4 cases were of biphasic subtype and 1 case
of undifferentiated sarcomatoid subtype.

the corresponding OS Kaplan-Meier curves. The low-grade
tier had the higher OS with a median of 11.9 years and 57%
at 5 years when compared with the high-grade tier with a
median of 3.3 years and 21% at 5 years (P = 0.002).

Assessment for confounding factors was compared
between the 2 tiers. All 51 cases showed invasion, elimi-
nating that variable as a confounding factor. No statisti-
cally significant difference between the 2 tiers was seen with
sex (17/28 [61%] female vs. 10/18 [56%] male; P = 0.77).
No statistically significant difference between the 2 tiers was
seen with age (mean 48 y [SD ± 15 y] in low-grade vs.
mean 52y [SD ± 15 y] in high grade; P = 0.39).
With surgical assessment of resection, no statisti-
cally significant difference between the 2 tiers was seen
when evaluating the proportion of each defined group
within each tier (2/18 [11%] R0, 3/18 [17%] R1, 8/18
[44%] R2a, 2/18 [11%] R2B, 3/18 [17%] R2C in low
grade; 5/28 [18%] R0, 0/28 [0%] R1, 14/28 [50%] R2a,
3/28 [11%] R2b, 6/28 [21%] R2c in high grade; P = 0.32).
No statistically significant difference between the 2 tiers
(5/18 [28%] in low grade vs. 5/28 [18%] in high grade;
P = 0.48) was seen in the subset of complete resections
without any gross disease (R0 and R1 aggregated). Fur-
thermore, between the 2 tiers, the proportion of in-
complete resections (R2b and R2c aggregated) that
encompassed cases excluded from the PFS analysis
showed no statistically significant difference (5/18 [28%]
in low grade vs. 9/28 [32%] in high grade; P > 0.99).
Finally, with types of received hyperthermic intra-
peritoneal chemotherapy regimen, no statistically significant
difference between the 2 tiers was seen with regard to var-
iations of mitomycin-C (4/18 [22%] low grade vs. 12/28
[43%] high grade; P=0.21) or cisplatin (8/18 [44%] low
grade vs. 9/28 [32%] high grade; P=0.53).
DISCUSSION
Albeit sparse with malignant mesothelioma, several
studies have attempted to explore histomorphologic fea-
tures in correlation with prognostic significance. More-
over, most of those studies have focused on malignant
pleural mesothelioma as opposed to diffuse MPeM. Even
fewer are studies that have tangentially addressed the
effect of histomorphologic features on diffuse MPeM in
correlation with prognostic significance.16–19 This is
probably attributable to rarity of diffuse MPeM and ex-
perience in managing and collecting large study cohorts.
Our group has extensively investigated both the
clinical and pathologic features of diffuse MPeM, in-
cluding the investigational biomarker aspects of the dis-
ease.10–13 With this experience, we have been able to
accrue a very large cohort for such a rare disease and, in
addition, be the first study to focus specifically rather than
tangentially on the correlation between histomorphologic
features and prognostic significance.
The study by Kadota et al1 was a landmark because
it was able to associate prognosis of malignant pleural
mesothelioma based specifically on nuclear features and
the level of mitoses. That study showed a histomorpho-
logic grading system that correlated with OS and PFS
times. Taking a similar approach, our study used a 2-tier
system of low grade versus high grade to explore OS and
PFS times with diffuse MPeM.
In our study cohort, for those cases with epithelioid
morphology there was clear delineation with statistical
significance between the low-grade tier versus the high-
grade tier group (median of 11.9 y and 57% at 5 y vs. a
median of 3.3 y and 21% at5 y). This clear delineation
between the low-grade tier and high-grade tier of diffuse
MPeM supports use of such a 2-tier grading system in the
reporting of diffuse MPeM.
In our study cohort, for those cases with epithelioid
morphology, correlation was evident in PFS times be-
tween the low-grade tier versus the high-grade tier group
(median of 4.7 y and 65% at 5 y vs. a median of 1.9 y and
35% at 5 y). These PFS results came close but did not
reach statistical significance (P = 0.089), and there is a
potential reason for this.
The number of cases used in the statistics for PFS
were lower in both the low-grade and high-grade tiers, due
to the nature of calculating PFS, as the cases excluded in
both tiers had incomplete resections (R2B/C) and therefore
were never considered recurrence free. In the low-grade tier,
this corresponded to 5 of 18 (27.7%) cases. In the high-
grade tier, this corresponded to 9 of 28 cases (32.1%). Al-
though the completeness of surgical cytoreduction is a ma-
jor prognostic factor, no statistically significant difference

 was found between the low-grade and high-grade tiers in
terms of complete or incomplete resections. Furthermore, it
is conceivable that with more accrued cases, statistical sig-
nificance for PFS could be achieved.
The low number of available cases (n = 5) did pre-
clude generating statistically significant correlations com-
paring diffuse MPeM of epithelioid morphology versus
nonepithelioid morphology. This was not surprising, as
biphasic, undifferentiated, and sarcomatoid morphologies
are rare manifestations of diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma,
an already rare disease. Several studies have shown that
biphasic and undifferentiated/sarcomatoid subtypes have a
worsened prognosis and refractory response to chemo-
therapy compared with the epithelioid morphology.18–21
That stated, despite the relatively low number of available
cases, it was surprising to see that OS times were remark-
ably better than the high-grade tier of epithelioid mor-
phology (21% and 75% at 5y, respectively, for OS).
Over the last decade, aggressive regional therapy us-
ing cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemotherapy has been increasingly applied to patients
with diffuse MPeM. There are 2 rationales behind this
therapeutic approach.
The first rationale is that complete or near-complete
cytoreduction in generally over one half of all patients
undergoing exploration is achievable. Theoretically this is
due to diffuse MPeM remaining confined to the peritoneal
cavity in the majority of cases and because the peritoneal
implants are superficial and do not invade the underlying
tissues deeply until the late stages.
The second rationale is that direct intraperitoneal
administration of chemotherapy permits a several-fold in-
crease in drug concentration in the peritoneum compared
with systemic administration.22 Despite this regional ad-
vantage, direct penetration into tumor tissue is limited to a
few millimeters and, hence, the theoretical enhancement
through heating the perfusate containing chemotherapy.
With cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intra-
peritoneal chemotherapy, OS in recent studies ranges from
a median of 10.8 to 63 months and 17% to 53% 5-year
survival rates.3,23–29 Despite efficacy, cytoreductive surgery
and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has con-
siderable reported preoperative morbidity and mortality
ranging in recent studies from 30% to 39% preoperative
morbidity and up to 6% preoperative mortality.3,23–25,28
As all cases in our study cohort, regardless of grade tier,
received cytoreductive surgery, followed by hyperthermic in-
traperitoneal chemotherapy, the separation of malignant
mesothelioma of epithelioid subtype into 2 tiers should be
considered, at this juncture, as prognostic, as opposed to
predictive, for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
Potential areas of future investigation include ag-
gregating experiences from multiple institutions to see
whether our results are validated and to look further into
investigational predictive biomarkers for those cases in
the high-grade tier.
In conclusion, our study shows that using a 2-tier
histomorphologic grading system for epithelioid diffuse
MPeM is prognostically effective at determining OS. Of
our cases in the low-grade tier, epithelioid MPeM has a
longer survival time when compared with our cases of
epithelioid MPeM in the high-grade tier.
