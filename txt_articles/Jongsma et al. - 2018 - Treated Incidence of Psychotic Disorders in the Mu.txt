IMPORTANCE Psychotic disorders contribute significantly to the global disease burden, yet
the latest international incidence study of psychotic disorders was conducted in the 1980s.
OBJECTIVES To estimate the incidence of psychotic disorders using comparable methods
across 17 catchment areas in 6 countries and to examine the variance between catchment
areas by putative environmental risk factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An international multisite incidence study (the
European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment
Interactions) was conducted from May 1, 2010, to April 1, 2015, among 2774 individuals from
England (2 catchment areas), France (3 catchment areas), Italy (3 catchment areas), the
Netherlands (2 catchment areas), Spain (6 catchment areas), and Brazil (1 catchment area)
with a first episode of nonorganic psychotic disorders (International Statistical Classification
of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes F20-F33) confirmed
by the Operational Criteria Checklist. Denominator populations were estimated using official
national statistics.
EXPOSURES Age, sex, and racial/ethnic minority status were treated as a priori confounders.
Latitude, population density, percentage unemployment, owner-occupied housing, and
single-person households were treated as catchment area–level exposures.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of nonorganic psychotic disorders (ICD-10 codes
F20-F33), nonaffective psychoses (ICD-10 codes F20-F29), and affective psychoses (ICD-10
codes F30-F33) confirmed by the Operational Criteria Checklist.
RESULTS A total of 2774 patients (1196 women and 1578 men; median age, 30.5 years
[interquartile range, 23.0-41.0 years]) with incident cases of psychotic disorders were
identified during 12.9 million person-years at risk (crude incidence, 21.4 per 100 000
person-years; 95% CI, 19.4-23.4 per 100 000 person-years). A total of 2183 patients (78.7%)
had nonaffective psychotic disorders. After direct standardization for age, sex, and
racial/ethnic minority status, an 8-fold variation was seen in the incidence of all psychotic
disorders, from 6.0 (95% CI, 3.5-8.6) per 100 000 person-years in Santiago, Spain, to 46.1
(95% CI, 37.3-55.0) per 100 000 person-years in Paris, France. Rates were elevated in
racial/ethnic minority groups (incidence rate ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7), were highest for men
18 to 24 years of age, and were lower in catchment areas with more owner-occupied homes
(incidence rate ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8). Similar patterns were observed for nonaffective
psychoses; a lower incidence of affective psychoses was associated with higher area-level
unemployment (incidence rate ratio, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study confirmed marked heterogeneity in risk for
psychotic disorders by person and place, including higher rates in younger men, racial/ethnic
minorities, and areas characterized by a lower percentage of owner-occupied houses.

 T
he World Health Organization Ten-Country Study,1 the
most recent multicenter international study of the in-
cidence of psychotic disorders, was widely interpreted
as demonstrating worldwide homogeneity in rates of schizo-
phrenia and other psychotic disorders. In fact, there was a 2.5-
fold variation in broadly defined nonaffective psychoses.
Subsequent studies2-4 showed that psychotic disorders
vary considerably across replicable social and environmental
gradients, including increased rates among men, younger
adults,5 racial/ethnic minority groups,4 and with urban birth
and upbringing.6 This finding built on earlier epidemiologic
studies from the United States7-9 and Europe,10-12 which re-
vealed strong associations between neighborhood social de-
privation and greater rates of psychosis. Nevertheless, to our
knowledge, there has been no international comparison of the
incidence of psychotic disorders since the World Health Or-
ganizationstudy.1Weestimatedtheincidenceofpsychoticdis-
orders across 17 catchment areas in 6 countries using compa-
rable methods as part of the European Network of National
Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Inter-
actions (EU-GEI) study. Specifically, we tested whether differ-
ences in incidence could be attributed to putative social and
environmental factors, including individual age, sex, and race/
ethnic minority status, catchment area–level latitude,13 popu-
lation density,6 unemployment, and proportion of single-
person households and owner-occupied homes as markers of
social disadvantage.
Methods
Study Design and Settings
The EU-GEI study is a multicenter incidence and case-sibling-
control study of genetic and environmental determinants of
psychotic disorders. Centers for the incidence study were
England (n = 2; southeast London, Cambridgeshire and Peter-
borough), France (n = 3; 20th arrondissement of Paris, Val-de-
Marne, Puy-de-Dôme), the Netherlands (n = 2; central Am-
sterdam, Gouda and Voorhout), Italy (n = 3; part of the Veneto
region, Bologna municipality, and the city of Palermo), Spain
(n = 6; Madrid [Vallecas], Barcelona, Valencia, Oviedo, San-
tiago, and Cuenca), and Brazil (n = 1; Ribeirão Preto). Catch-
ment areas ranged from rural (Cuenca, 11 people per square ki-
lometer) to urban (Paris, 33 260 people per square kilometer).
Writteninformedconsentwasobtainedfromthosewhoagreed
to participate in the case-control study; otherwise, ethical ap-
proval was obtained to extract basic demographic and clini-
cal details from patient records from local research ethics com-
mittees in each catchment area: South London and Maudsley

Participants
We identified all individuals who contacted mental health ser-
vices in our catchment areas for a suspected first episode of
psychosis (FEP). Case ascertainment varied from 12 months
(London, England) to 48 months (Val-de-Marne, France)
(Table1),withamedianof25months(interquartilerange[IQR],
24-36 months). Case ascertainment predominantly took place
between May 1, 2010, and April 1, 2015 (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment), and involved trained researchers making regular con-
tact with all secondary and tertiary mental health care profes-
sionals to identify potential cases. In all countries, it was
uncommon for people to be treated for FEP in primary care;
instead, a patient with a suspicion of psychosis would typi-
cally be referred to specialist mental health services. Re-
search teams were overseen by a psychiatrist with experi-
ence in epidemiologic research and included trained research
nurses and clinical psychologists. Teams received training in
epidemiologic principles and incidence study design to mini-
mize nondifferential ascertainment bias across different lo-
cal and national health care systems.
Potential participants with FEP were included if they met
the following criteria: resident within the catchment area at
first presentation; 18 to 64 years of age; and presentation with
a clinical diagnosis for an untreated FEP, even if longstanding
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Re-
lated Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes F20-
F33). We excluded individuals who had previous contact with
mental health services for psychosis, evidence of psychotic
symptoms precipitated by an organic cause, and transient psy-
chotic symptoms resulting from acute intoxication, as de-
fined by the ICD-10 (codes F1X.5)
Key Points
Question Does the treated incidence of psychotic disorders vary
across 17 settings in 6 countries, and to what extent is this
explained by individual and catchment area–level risk factors?
Findings The overall crude incidence of psychotic disorders in
this international multisite incidence study was 21.4 per 100 000
person-years, and after standardization this incidence varied
8-fold between catchment areas. Higher incidence was also
associated with younger age, male sex, racial/ethnic minority
status, and lower catchment area–level owner-occupancy; similar
variation was found independently for nonaffective and affective
psychoses.
Meaning The incidence of psychotic disorders varied by person
and place, indicating that both individual and catchment
area–level risk factors are important in predicting incidence.

 For participants who met these criteria, we obtained re-
search-based diagnoses using the Operational Criteria Check-
list algorithm (OPCRIT) to ensure comparability of diagnoses
across catchment areas. The OPCRIT has high interrater reli-
ability generally,14 and in our study after training (κ = 0.7). As-
sessment with OPCRIT was based on a semistructured clini-
cal interview or review of case notes and other relevant
information. The clinical interview schedule used at each site
followed local expertise, including the Schedules for Clinical
Assessment in Neuropsychiatry15 (United Kingdom and Italy),
the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History16
(the Netherlands), the Structured Interview for DSM-IV
(Brazil),17 and the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies18
(France). Where OPCRIT assessment was not possible, we
relied on clinical diagnoses.
Population at Risk
Weestimatedthepopulationatrisk,those18to64yearsofage,
in each catchment area from the most accurate local or na-
tional routine demographic data available (eTable 2 in the
Supplement),stratifiedbyage(18-24years,then5-yearbands),
sex, and racial/ethnic minority status. We multiplied the popu-
lation by case ascertainment duration (in years) to estimate
person-years at risk.
Measures
Our primary outcome was an OPCRIT-confirmed ICD-10 diag-
nosisofanyclinicallyrelevantpsychoticdisorder(ICD-10codes
F20-F33). This broad phenotype was considered alongside 2
secondary outcomes: nonaffective psychoses (ICD-10 codes
F20-F29) and affective psychoses (ICD-10 codes F30-F33).
Data on age group (as above), sex, racial/ethnic minority
status, and country of birth were collected at baseline for all
participants using the Medical Research Council Sociodemo-
graphic Questionnaire19 and case notes. We defined a binary
variabletodistinguishbetweentheracial/ethnicmajoritypopu-
lation in each catchment area, and all other racial/ethnic mi-
noritygroups.Ineachcountry,theracial/ethnicmajoritypopu-
lationwasclassifiedasthemajority(white)racial/ethnicgroup,
following national conventions (eAppendix 1 and eTable 2 in
the Supplement), with all other groups classified as the racial/
ethnic minority.
Latitude was estimated in degrees from the equator.
Population density was derived as number of inhabitants per
square kilometer, based on official total population esti-
mates. We derived 3 measures of the social environment (un-
employment, owner-occupied housing, and single-person
households) from the 2011 European Household and Popula-
tion Census,20 a decennial census that provides comparable
data at a provincial level (NUTS-2 [Nomenclature of Territo-
rial Units for Statistics–2] regions). Equivalent data for
Ribeirão Preto were derived from the 2010 National Census
of Brazil.21 Duration of untreated psychosis (in weeks) was
estimated for descriptive purposes, assessed via the Notting-
ham Onset Schedule,22 and based on time from onset of
symptoms to first contact with secondary mental health ser-
vices for suspected psychosis. For deviations from the proto-
col, see eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.
Missing Data
Seven of 2774 cases (0.3%) were missing data on age or sex,
and were excluded from direct standardization and statisti-
cal modeling, but retained for crude incidence rate estima-
tion. Except for Puy-de-Dôme, France (eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement),wecodedanyparticipantsmissingdataonracial/
ethnic minority status (n = 5 [0.2%]) to the racial/ethnic ma-
jority group.
Statistical Analysis
For each outcome, we estimated crude incidence rates per
100 000 person-years and 95% CIs by catchment area and so-
ciodemographic characteristics. Next, we used direct stan-
dardization for age-band and sex and for age-band, sex, and
racial/ethnic minority status to investigate variation in rates
between catchment areas. We used the total population of En-
gland and Wales (2011 Census23) as our standard population,
and estimated standardized incidence ratios using the over-
all sample incidence rate as the reference category. Finally, we
used random-effects (intercepts) Poisson regression to inves-
tigate variance in incidence by sociodemographic and envi-
ronmental factors, accounting for the hierarchical structure of
the data set. Age, sex, their interaction, and racial/ethnic mi-
nority status were treated as a priori confounders. We en-
tered catchment area–level variables into our models one at a
timebasedonthestrengthofassociationwithincidenceinuni-
variable analyses, assessed via Akaike Information Criterion
(lower scores indicate better model fit). Model building was as-
sessed via likelihood ratio test. Analyses were carried out in
Stata, version 13 (StataCorp). Results for secondary out-
comes, as well as sensitivity analyses, are reported in eAppen-
dix 2 in the Supplement. P < .05 (2-sided) was considered
significant.
Results
Participant Characteristics
We identified 2774 people presenting with a first episode of
psychotic disorder, as defined by ICD-10 criteria, during 12.94
million person-years, corresponding to a crude incidence of
21.4 (95% CI, 19.4-23.4) per 100 000 person-years. A total of
1578 participants with FEP were men (56.9%), varying from
48.8% (40 of 82; Oviedo, Spain) to 77.8% (21 of 27; Cuenca,
Spain) (χ2 = 34.3; P = .005; Table 1). A total of 1091 partici-
pants with FEP were from a racial/ethnic minority back-
ground (39.8%), varying from 2.8% (1 of 36; Santiago, Spain)
to 75.6% (198 of 262; Southeast London, England) (χ2 = 455.8;
P < .001). By comparison, almost 49.5% of the population at
risk were men (6 401 911 of 12 933 665), and 22.9% were from
a racial/ethnic minority group (2 962 395 of 12 933 665).
Median age at first contact was 30.5 years (IQR, 23.0-41.0
years),varyingfrom26.0years(IQR,21.0-37.0years)inCuenca,
Spain, to 35.5 years (IQR, 28.0-42.0 years) in Veneto, Italy
(Kruskal-Wallis χ2
16 = 51.3; P < .001). First contact was earlier
in men (28.0 years; IQR, 22.0-38.0 years) than in women (34.0
years; IQR, 26.0-45.0 years; Mann-Whitney test = –11.1;
P < .001), but did not differ by racial/ethnic minority status

 (Mann-Whitney test = 1.0; P = .31). Median duration of un-
treated psychosis was 8.0 weeks (IQR, 2.0-35.0 weeks), vary-
ing from 2.5 weeks (IQR, 1.0-7.0 weeks) in Madrid, Spain, to
26.0 weeks (IQR, 2.0-77.0 weeks) in Cuenca, Spain (eTable 1
in the Supplement; Kruskal-Wallis χ2
15 = 119.7; P < .001).
Variation in the Incidence of FEP
The age pattern of the incidence of FEP differed between men
and women (Figure 1; likelihood ratio test χ2
8 = 119.3; P < .001).
Crude rates of FEP peaked for men between 18 and 24 years
of age (61.0 per 100 000 person-years; 95% CI, 59.0-63.1 per
100 000 person-years) and decreased steeply thereafter. For
women, the incidence of FEP also peaked in the youngest age
group (18-24 years) at 27.0 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI,
24.9-29.1 per 100 000 person-years), but decreased more
gradually thereafter, with a small secondary peak between 50
and 54 years of age. Rates were higher in racial/ethnic minor-
ity groups (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.46-1.72)
after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, their interaction,
and relevant catchment area–level characteristics.
We observed 10-fold variation in crude incidence of FEP
across our catchment areas (Figure 2 and Table 2), from 6.3
(95% CI, 3.9-8.6) per 100 000 person-years in Santiago, Spain,
to 61.4 (95% CI, 59.4-63.5) per 100 000 person-years in south-
east London, England. Age-sex standardization had a negli-
gible effect on this variation (Figure 2). Additional standard-
ization for racial/ethnic minority status attenuated variance,
although an almost 8-fold variation remained; standardized
incidence ratios varied from 0.29 (95% CI, 0.21-0.40) in San-
tiago, Spain, to 2.21 (95% CI, 1.84-2.65) in Paris, France.
TheassociationbetweencrudeincidenceofFEPandcatch-
ment area–level exposures are shown in the eFigure in the
Supplement; univariable random intercepts Poisson regres-
sion showed that greater owner-occupancy (IRR for a 10% in-
crease, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.81) and unemployment (IRR for
a 10% increase, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.84) were associated with
a lower incidence of FEP, while percentage of single-person
households (IRR for a 10% increase, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.24-2.27)
was associated with a higher incidence of FEP (Table 3). A null
random intercepts Poisson model confirmed substantial varia-
tion in incidence by catchment area (σ = 0.32; P = .006), which
persisted after adjustment for age, sex, their interaction, and
racial/ethnic minority status (σ = 0.23; P = .007). In multivari-
able analyses, incidence of FEP was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.46-1.72)
times higher in racial/ethnic minority groups compared with
the racial/ethnic majority population, and lower in catch-
ment areas with more owner-occupied homes (IRR for a 10%
increase in owner-occupancy, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.83). No
othersetting-levelvariables,includinglatitude(IRR,0.99;95%
CI 0.97-1.01), improved our final model (Table 3), where re-
sidual variance by catchment area remained, albeit attenu-
ated (σ = 0.06; P = .02). Similar results were observed for non-
affective and affective psychoses separately (eAppendix 2 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
Principal Findings
We observed substantial variation in the incidence of FEP
across 17 catchment areas in 6 countries, confirming differen-
tial risk by place and person. In line with previous studies,
we observed higher rates of all psychotic disorders in racial/
ethnic minority groups4 and among young people,5 particu-
larly for men.24 We confirmed a small but robust secondary
peak in the risk of all FEPs for women older than 45 years.
Catchment areas with higher owner-occupancy levels were as-
sociated with lower incidence rates of FEPs, implicating so-
cioeconomic factors in the presentation of psychotic disor-
ders, in line with findings of previous research.25,26
Comparison With the Previous Literature
Overall, our incidence rates were consistent with those in
the literature, although between-study heterogeneity in
methods, inclusion criteria, and diagnoses studied make
direct comparisons difficult. For example, the incidence of
broadly defined schizophrenia in the World Health Organiza-
tion Ten-Country Study1 varied from 15 to 42 per 100 000

 person-years, although that study used a different age range
(15-54 years) and did not consider affective psychoses.1 In
our study, comparable rates of nonaffective psychoses var-
ied from 5 to 41 per 100 000 person-years after standardiza-
tion for age, sex, and racial/ethnic minority status. A system-
atic review limited to England observed a pooled crude
incidence of all psychotic disorders of 32.7 per 100 000
person-years,3 somewhat higher than the overall crude inci-
dence rate we observed (21.4 per 100 000 person-years).
Such comparisons should be interpreted with caution, given
heterogeneity in estimation methods and setting; few inci-
dence studies have been conducted in southern Europe until
recently,27-29 where rates appeared to be uniformly low,
despite inclusion of urban catchment areas.

 The higher rates of psychotic disorders we observed in
men,24 younger age groups,5 and racial/ethnic minorities,4 as
well as for nonaffective psychoses,3 are also frequently re-
ported in the literature. Our study provided further robust evi-
dence of a secondary peak in the risk of psychosis for women
olderthan45years,buildingonpreviousobservations.30-32Our
findings add further evidence to the observation that early in-
terventionserviceswithanupperagelimitof35years(orlower)
may lead to sex-related mental health inequalities33: only
50.8% of women (605 of 1190) with psychosis were identified
before 35 years of age in our settings, compared with 67.9% of
men (1070 of 1577) (Figure 1).
Incidence of FEP varied not only by person, but impor-
tantly, by place, suggesting that the social environment may
shape incidence patterns of FEP. Our best-fitting models of all
FEP and nonaffective psychoses (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment) suggested that owner-occupancy levels were associ-
ated with incidence of FEP, although residual variation at the
setting level was not explained by other catchment area–
level measures. Acknowledging the potential for reverse cau-
sality, owner-occupancy may also be a proxy for a variety of
socialexposures,mostobviouslysocioeconomicposition,5but
extending to social stability and cohesiveness, which have pre-
viouslybeenassociatedwithpsychosis.26TheincidenceofFEP
appeared to be lower in southern Europe, but we found no evi-
denceofvariationbylatitudeinourmultivariablemodels.Nev-
ertheless, settings were located within a narrow band (38°-
53° north of the equator), except for Brazil (21° south of the
equator). This location may have contributed to our null find-
ings, and the absence of high rates of psychosis in our south-
ern Europe settings, particularly in major urban centers, re-
quires further investigation; incidence patterns with respect
to population density in southern European settings ap-
peared to diverge from those observed in northern Europe
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).6 Variation in the incidence of af-
fective disorders, with lower rates in catchment areas with
higher levels of unemployment (eTable 3 in the Supplement),
is counterintuitive and unexpected; further research is re-
quired to examine this finding.
Strengths and Limitations
Our findings should be interpreted alongside the strengths
and limitations of our study. Our large sample size allowed
us to estimate 3 psychotic outcomes in 17 settings with a
high degree of precision. To minimize ascertainment bias, all
researchers received training via face-to-face epidemiologic
training sessions, regular teleconferencing, online training
manuals, and interrater reliability protocols. Nonetheless,
some limitations of our multinational design need to be
acknowledged.
Detection of patients who never present to services is an
issue for all epidemiologic studies, and our rate estimates
should be interpreted as the treated incidence. Although our
overarching case ascertainment method was similar across all
settings,someadaptationtolocalhealthcaresystemswasnec-
essary. For example, primary care in each catchment area may
have referred different proportions of patients with FEP to sec-
ondarymentalhealthcareservices,butreferralguidelineswere
very similar across national settings; these guidelines all urge
prompt referral of anyone with FEP. That said, we did not as-
sess whether referral practices were consistent within and be-
tween catchment areas. Difference in the average timing of re-
ferral may have affected the case mix within the FEP category,
but not the overall number of referrals; each center was in a
steady state.
Differences in the organization of secondary mental health
care services across localities may also have influenced detec-
tion of patients. In England and the Netherlands, for ex-
ample, the widespread commissioning of early intervention
in psychosis services may have led to improved detection of
new cases of FEP. The leakage study in Brazil revealed a sub-
stantialnumberofnewcasesatthissite(279[49%]),whilesimi-
lar approaches in 2 French sites (Paris and Val-de-Marne) iden-
tified far fewer missed cases (7 [6%] in Paris and 28 [13%] in
Val-de-Marne).30 Comprehensive, regular contact with men-
tal health services should have helped minimize underascer-
tainment, although some patients, including those treated pri-
vately, may have been missed; in general, we believe these
biases are unlikely to account for the 8-fold variation be-
tween catchment areas.
We used validated semistructured interview schedules,
where possible, to obtain standardized research-based
OPCRIT diagnoses close to the patient’
s first presentation.
We have no reason to believe the use of different schedules
by setting biased our estimates; indeed, this choice was
adapted to local expertise to minimize bias, which may have
otherwise arisen from using unfamiliar interview schedules.
We considered total incidence of FEP as our primary out-
come, as this is useful for, and consistent with, contempo-
rary practice in the management and treatment of psychosis,
to allow symptoms to evolve at first presentation and mini-
mize stigma. This practice is also consistent with some
evidence of diagnostic instability in the early course of
disorder,34 particularly for psychotic disorders other than
schizophrenia.35 Although we relied on clinical diagnoses in
a small proportion of patients, this did not alter the interpre-
tation of our findings (eAppendix 2 and eTable 5 in the
Supplement).
We classified racial/ethnic minority status as a binary
variable, following official definitions used in each country
to distinguish racial/ethnic majority and minority groups.
This approach may have led to some misclassification, par-
ticularly in France, which does not differentiate between
people born in mainland France vs its overseas territories,
nor is able to identify second-generation (French-born)
migrants. This misclassification would have conservatively
biased IRRs with respect to racial/ethnic minority status, as
would have our decision to code participants with missing
data on race/ethnicity (0.2%) to the racial/ethnic majority
group.4 Our binary race/ethnicity variable may also have
permitted residual confounding; risk of psychosis by race/
ethnicity will be studied in greater detail in future EU-GEI
publications.

 only be obtained at the NUTS-2 regional level, which is larger
than our catchment areas. Data from this level may have led
to exposure misclassification, although the effect of this eco-
logical bias is difficult to determine.
Although we controlled for several risk factors simultane-
ously (age, sex, racial/ethnic minority status, and catchment
area-level factors), we were unable to include other putative
risk factors for psychosis, including cannabis use,36 urban
birth,6 family history of psychosis,37 childhood trauma,38 or
genetic risk.39 These factors are not routinely available in de-
nominator estimates, but will be investigated in future case-
control designs from the EU-GEI study.
Conclusions
In this international, multicenter study we found that treated
incidence of psychotic disorders varied 8-fold between catch-
ment areas after standardization for age, sex, and racial/
ethnic minority status. Rates were higher in younger people,
men, racial/ethnic minorities, and areas with lower levels of
owner-occupied housing, although substantial variation be-
tween catchment areas, and by broad diagnosis, remained.
These results suggest that there is pronounced variation in the
health care burden of psychosis worldwide.
