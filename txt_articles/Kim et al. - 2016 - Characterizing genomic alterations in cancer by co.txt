Abstract
Systematic efforts to sequence the cancer genome have identified large numbers of relevant 
mutations and copy number alterations in human cancers; however, elucidating their functional 
consequences, and their interactions to drive or maintain oncogenic states, is still a significant 
challenge. Here we introduce REVEALER, a computational method that identifies combinations 
of mutually exclusive genomic alterations correlated with functional phenotypes, such as the 
activation or gene-dependency of oncogenic pathways or the sensitivity to a drug treatment. We 
use REVEALER to uncover complementary genomic alterations associated with the 
transcriptional activation of β-catenin and NRF2, MEK-inhibitor sensitivity, and KRAS 
dependency. REVEALER successfully identified both known and new associations demonstrating 
the power of combining functional profiles with extensive characterization of genomic alterations 
in cancer genomes.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large-scale genome sequencing projects are 
providing ever-increasing catalogs of somatic and epigenetic alterations in cancer1–4. A 
major challenge moving forward is to be able to identify subsets of functionally relevant 
lesions for further study and eventual therapeutic targeting5–6. These “driver” lesions, in 
synergistic combinations, are responsible for the generation and maintenance of the 
oncogenic state and may determine the characteristics of each tumor or tumor type. 
However, the identification of such drivers is complicated by genomic instability, which 
increases the number of genomic alterations including low penetrance events with uncertain 
functional roles.
Genome-wide functional studies of cancer cell lines and tumors, have proven useful in 
identifying associations between gene dependencies and genomic abnormalities.7–11. 
Associating recurrent genomic abnormalities with their matching therapeutic agent is a 
common strategy under the ‘oncogene addiction’ paradigm. However, the challenge of 
effectively mapping molecular alterations to pathway activity and drug response can be quite 
difficult as those relationships are not one-to-one. Indeed, some driver mutations only 
partially predict drug response because of functional heterogeneity and the rise of resistance 
mechanisms.

 One way to address these difficulties is to systematically explore the landscape of mutually 
exclusive genomic abnormalities along so called functional axes that represent the activation 
of oncogenic pathways or sensitivity to genetic or chemical perturbations. The use of 
appropriate functional profiles is important because the complementary nature of genomic 
alterations is only clearly delineated in the right context, for example, where the relevant 
oncogenic programs, and other synergies such as immune or stress responses, are co-
activated to drive or maintain the oncogenic state.
Here we present REVEALER (Repeated Evaluation of VariablEs conditionAL Entropy and 
Redundancy), a method to identify groups of genomic alterations that together associate 
with a functional activation, gene dependency, or drug response profile. The combination of 
these alterations explains more of the functional target activation or sensitivity than any 
individual alteration considered in isolation. REVEALER can be applied to a wide variety of 
problems and allows prior relevant background knowledge to be incorporated into the 
model. We show that REVEALER can be used to identify genomic features associated with 
functional cancer phenotypes and demonstrate its higher sensitivity and specificity compared 
to other model selection methods.
Results
REVEALER Overview
The optimal execution of REVEALER requires three inputs: i) a functional “target” profile 
for individual samples across a given dataset, ii) a dataset containing a comprehensive 
collection of genomic “features,” and iii) an optional “seed” feature with which to initialize 
the search. The target profile is a readout from quantitative measurements, including e.g. 
gene expression, pathway activation, gene-dependency or drug response. Ideally, the seed is 
a feature that has a known effect on the target profile. REVEALER starts by measuring the 
degree of association between the target and seed feature using a re-scaled mutual 
information metric that we call the Information Coefficient (IC, Figure 1A and 
Supplementary Information). The IC is a non-linear correlation coefficient that takes values 
between 1 (perfect match) and −1 (perfect anti-match). One key distinguishing feature of 
REVEALER is the ability to identify features based on both: target profile and seed. 
Features that match the target profile but are correlated with the seed are penalized, while 
features that associate with the target, and are also complementary to the seed, are scored 
higher. In this way, only genomic features that explain activation or sensitivity in the target 
profile that is not already accounted for, will be included in the model. REVEALER 
achieves this by computing the conditional mutual information of the target profile and each 
feature, conditioned on the seed feature. We refer to this as the Conditional Information 
Coefficient (CIC) (Figure 1B and Supplementary Information). REVEALER then iterates 
this process (Figure 1C).
REVEALER uncovers alterations associated with β-catenin activation
We first used REVEALER to identify genomic features associated with the oncogenic 
activation of β-catenin.12 In Figure 2A, the target t is a β-catenin activation TCF4 reporter13 
assayed across 83 cancer cell lines whose mutations and copy number profiles have

 previously been reported.14 The seed feature so, corresponds to activating mutations in β-
catenin (S33, S34, S37, T45, T41) and the target profile in dark blue represents its presence 
in each sample. The seed feature associates strongly with the target (IC = 0.44) with all of 
the β-catenin mutations located where the reporter readout is high (left side of heatmap), 
consistent with the known activating role for these events. However, about half of the 
samples with high β-catenin activation cannot be explained by alterations in β-catenin. 
Therefore, we used REVEALER to find additional genomic features from a large set of 
candidates to explain the target profile.
The top-scoring genomic feature of the first REVEALER iteration (CIC=0.49) is APC 
mutations (Figure 2A). REVEALER found this specific alteration from 17,721 feature 
candidates consisting of 671 mutations and 17,050 amplifications/deletions (Supplementary 
Fig. 1A). These were generated after filtering out low/high frequency features 
(Supplementary Information) from an initial set of 48,270 features. APC mutations are 
known to be associated with an uncontrolled stabilization and transcriptional activation of β-
catenin15 and are mutually exclusive with β-catenin mutations. Combining β-catenin and 
functional APC mutations to obtain the summary feature increases the IC with the target to 
0.61 (Figure 2A). REVEALER then proceeds to a second iteration and finds the 
amplification of chr13q33 (ITGBL1_AMP), as the top scoring feature (CIC= 0.49, Figure 
2A). Several other features in the same region chr13q11–34 also attain almost the same CIC 
(Supplementary Fig. 2A). Recurrent amplifications in 13q are indeed common in colon 
cancer, and notably, one of our previous studies identified CDK8 in chr13q12.13, as a colon 
oncogene that regulates β-catenin activity16. Attempts to perform a third iteration fail to find 
any feature that will increase the IC with the target and thus REVEALER has completed the 
task. In this case REVEALER performed two iterations before completion but in other cases 
it may require a smaller or larger number of iterations.
The complete REVEALER results are summarized at the bottom of Figure 2A. The three 
features have high complementarity and attain a collective IC of 0.70, accounting for 17 out 
of the top 20 samples with the highest β-catenin. (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). In addition 
to finding the best scoring abnormalities at every iteration, REVEALER also clusters them 
to facilitate the identification of alternative or “second best” hits (Supplementary Figs. 1B 
and 2A, Supplementary Information).
We also investigated whether these features associate with shRNA β-catenin dependence in 
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Information). The samples harboring REVEALER’s 
features indeed display a much higher degree of β-catenin dependency (P values: 0.0005, 
0.0001 and 0.0009, respectively) and are also highly complementary to each other (Figure 
2B). This significant mutual exclusivity and association with both: transcriptional and 
dependency targets provides strong evidence that these alterations indeed activate β-catenin.
To investigate REVEALER’s results robustness, we randomly subsampled 80% of the 
samples, re-ran REVEALER, and found that APC mutations and the 13q-12–34 amplicon 
re-appear in 8 out of 10 runs, suggesting these results are reasonably robust (Supplementary 
Information).

 Transcriptional NRF2/NFE2L2 activation in lung cancer
Here we show how REVEALER can also be used with a combined seed feature.
The transcription factor NRF2 (NFE2L2), induces a cytoprotective response to oxidative 
stresses and its mutations confer constitutive activation in cancer17. We generated a target 
profile using the single-sample GSEA8 scores of NRF2-driven genes18 across 182 lung 
cancer cell lines from the Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, hereafter referred 
as CCLE14. We selected lung cancer cell lines due to the higher frequency of NFE2L2 
alterations,19,20 and used as seed both: NFE2L2 mutations and amplifications (Figure 3A). 
REVEALER merges multiple seeds(logical OR function) to produce a single summary seed. 
The input genomic features consisted of a set of 32,154 alterations (991 mutations and 
31,253 amplification/deletions after filtering from an original set of 48,270).
The first REVEALER iteration yielded KEAP1 mutations, which is an established direct 
mediator of NRF2 and its targets21 (Figure 3A and Supplementary Fig. 3). The second 
iteration yielded features encompassing amplification of chr15q22/26 (OR4F13P_AMP, 
Figure 3A and Supplementary Fig. 4). Besides these two no other features improved the 
match with the target. Of special interest within this amplicon is NOX5 (NADPH oxidase 5) 
because its α and β isoforms have been implicated in the production of extracellular 
superoxide, H2O2 or other reactive oxygen species (ROS)22–24.
To experimentally assess whether NOX5 indeed regulates NRF2 transcriptional activity, we 
used an antioxidant response element (ARE) luciferase reporter as readout of the NRF2 
pathway25. We co-transfected ARE-driven luciferase reporter construct with NOX5, NRF2 
(positive control), and LacZ (negative control) open-reading frame (ORFs) constructs. We 
found that NRF2 and NOX5 ORF constructs led to significant increases in the ARE-driven 
luciferase activity relative to LacZ or no vector indicating that NOX5 expression indeed 
regulates ARE (Figure 3B). To test whether these results comport with biological behavior 
in vivo, we examined a TCGA lung cancer dataset26 and found that these genomic features 
are enriched in tumors with higher NRF2 activation suggesting REVEALER’s results 
generalize to tumors (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Drug sensitivity: the MEK-inhibitor PD-0325901 and MAPK Activation
In this example, we show REVEALER de novo discovery without a seed and with a drug 
sensitivity target.
MEK (MAP2K1), a member of the MAPK signaling pathway, is constitutively activated as a 
result of oncogenic mutations in e.g. BRAF, RAS and MEK1.27 As a target, we used the 
sensitivity profile to the MEK inhibitor PD-032590128 in 493 cancer cell lines from the 
CCLE. As MEK itself is rarely mutated, we ran REVEALER without a seed. The first 
iteration of REVEALER yielded BRAF mutations as the top-scoring feature (Figure 4 and 
Supplementary Fig. 6). The next two iterations yielded mutations in KRAS and NRAS. 
These 3 genes are well-known oncogenic activators of MAPK signaling and their 
combination explains a large fraction of PD-0325901 sensitive samples in the CCLE (Figure 
4 and Supplementary Figs. 7–8).

 Example 4. KRAS dependency
Lastly, we show how REVEALER can be used with a gene dependency target.
The high frequency of KRAS mutations highlights its significance as a major oncogene. 
Besides studies linking KRAS mutations with dependency29, there is growing evidence for 
KRAS wild-type states that are also KRAS-dependent.8,9 Consistent with these findings, our 
examination of KRAS dependency profile across cancer cell lines,30 found evidence that 
while KRAS dependency associates with KRAS mutation status (IC = −0.41), a significant 
number of wild-type samples were also dependent on KRAS. We used REVEALER to 
assess if any other genomic alteration besides KRAS mutation, might account for these 
unexplained KRAS dependencies. We used as target the shRNA KRAS dependency score 
and KRAS mutations as seed (Figure 5A). Strikingly, REVEALER found a copy number 
gain (CNG) in chr8q23–4 (NSMCE2_AMP) as the top-scoring feature in the first iteration 
(Figure 5A and Supplementary Fig. 9A). This feature is followed by amplifications in 
chr9p21 and chr12p12 (KRAS locus), and deletions in chr9q12 as potentially 
complementary alterations with lesser incremental benefit (Figures 5A and Supplementary 
Figs. 10–12). These features together explain the majority of the KRAS dependent cell lines: 
30 out of the top 35 samples with higher KRAS dependency (Figure 5A).
Alterations in chr8q23–24 are frequent events in cancer,31 and the REVEALER finding 
corresponds to a broad region of chr8q23–24 (“chr8q24 gain”) instead of the more specific 
focal MYC amplification (“MYC amplification”, Figure 5B). To assess differences in KRAS 
dependence we grouped cell lines based on: MYC amplification, chr8q24 gain, KRAS 
mutations or none of the above. We found statistically significant differences between cells 
that harbor chr8q24 gain and cells that either have MYC amplification or other genotypes 
(Figure 5C). As both events are centromeric with respect to, and potentially target MYC 
itself, we asked if there were differences in MYC expression between these events. MYC 
amplified cell lines had significantly higher expression of MYC compared to cell lines with 
the 8q24 gain (Figure 5D), which perhaps can be explained by high copy number value of 
MYC amplification region (data not shown). This is consistent with previous studies that 
show tumors with low MYC expression display increased dependence on KRAS32.
To further validate these findings we selected an independent panel of NSCLC cell lines 
with either mutations in KRAS, chr8q24 gain, or controls, and assayed them for relative 
viability upon suppression of KRAS (Figure 5E). Validated shRNAs against KRAS8,9 were 
used to assess if 8q24-gain predicts sensitivity to KRAS suppression. As expected, cells with 
mutant KRAS status were highly dependent on KRAS. Consistent with previous 
observations,8, 33 we also found that cells that do not have alterations in KRAS or chr8q24 
are less dependent on KRAS; however, cells that harbor 8q24 gain were significantly more 
sensitive to KRAS suppression, suggesting that these samples indeed require KRAS for their 
survival.
REVEALER: Simulated data analysis—The objective of this benchmark was to 
investigate how well the CIC metric used by REVEALER could find a known 
complementary feature in controlled circumstances where we know the answer. We were 
also interested in comparing the CIC with other alternative approaches including the partial

 correlation coefficient and two other methods: the ElasticNet34 and mRMR35 
(Supplementary Information). We generated 5,000 simulated data instances of target, seed 
and complementary-feature (the “signal”) using probabilistic models parameterized to fit to 
the empirical data using skew-t distributions and random sampling. We also generate a set of 
2,000 random features (the “noise”) (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Figs. 
13–15). We use each method to find the correct complementary feature in each instance and 
evaluated the results using ROC (Receiving Operating Characteristics) curves, which we can 
estimate because we know the correct complementary feature in each case. The results show 
that the CIC is the most sensitive at finding the correct complementary feature and attains an 
area under ROC equal to 0.872, compared with 0.674 for partial correlation, 0.633 for 
ElasticNet, and 0.672 for mRMR (Figure 6A and Supplementary Fig. 15E).
REVEALER: Comparisons with other methods—Methods to search for 
complementary genomic alterations36–42 or general non-redundant features have been 
proposed in the past;34,35,43 however, REVEALER is different in several aspects: i) it 
incorporates 3 inputs: a target profile, a features dataset and a seed feature(s), ii) it uses a 
sequential search process where the features found in subsequent iterations are influenced by 
the choice of features in early iterations, and iii) it uses the conditional differential mutual 
information. These distinctions make it difficult to directly compare REVEALER with other 
methods; however, if one restricts the comparison to cases with no seed REVEALER can be 
compared with other methods such as the ElasticNet34 and Dendrix.41
We ran REVALER side to side with those methods using the data for Examples 1–4 without 
seeds and compared the results to provide insights into the characteristics of each method 
and delineate their potential suitability to different problem settings. We present below a 
summary of results and refer the reader to the Supplementary Information for details.
Table 1 and Figure 6B summarize the results using: the Target Association Score, the 
absolute value of the IC of a summary feature consisting of the combination of all the top 
selected features, and the Feature Complementarity Index, one minus the average IC across 
pairs of features. Table 1 shows that several of the features found by the ElasticNet overlap 
with REVEALER’s, suggesting that strong feature-target associations are retrieved by both 
methods. Examination of the differences appear to show that the features selected by the 
ElasticNet, while correlated with the target profile, were less complementary with each other 
than the ones selected by REVEALER (Figure 6B). This is likely a consequence of 
ElasticNet’s cost function34 which favors fitting the target and finds features with low 
correlation with each other but not necessarily mutual exclusivity. Dendrix produces rather 
different sets of features compared with the other methods (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 
15A–D) and performs a more comprehensive search of feature complementarity without 
using the sample-per-sample target. As a consequence Dendrix appears to find features with 
high complementarity to each other but somewhat less association with the target 
(Supplementary Fig. 15A–D).

 Discussion
In the examples presented above we demonstrated how REVEALER effectively maps 
genomic alterations to their relevant functional profiles. The identification of i) APC and 
KEAP1 mutations, as alternative causes of activation of β–catenin and NRF2 respectively; ii) 
the association of BRAF, KRAS and NRAS mutations with MEK-inhibition sensitivity, and 
iii) our successful validation of the role of NOX5 in NRF2 activation, and the chr8q23–4 
amplicon in predicting KRAS dependency, all provide a direct confirmation of 
REVEALER’s utility and effectiveness.
The use of mutual information for estimating genomic feature association is not new,44–46 
however, REVEALER makes innovative use of conditional mutual information based on 
continuous distributions and avoids the need for discretization and other simplifying 
assumptions. The simulated benchmark shows that REVEALER can identify a 
complementary feature reasonably well where its CIC is above 0.30 for a wide range of IC 
values between target and seed The results also show that the conditional mutual information 
is more sensitive than the partial correlation, and other selection methods, to discriminate 
subtler relationships between genomic features.
The comparative results across methods (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 15A–D) suggest 
that REVEALER strikes a good balance between weighting the features’ complementarity 
and their association with the target. REVEALER is particularly well suited in cases where 
there is: a) an accurate sample-per-sample functional profile representing a biological state 
of interest, b) prior information to guide the choice of seed(s), c) a comprehensive 
characterization of genomic abnormalities.
The differences between approaches are likely produced by the different emphasis of each 
algorithm. The ElasticNet emphasizes finding uncorrelated features that primarily “predict” 
the target, and are not strictly restricted to be complementary, It is well suited for cases 
where matching the target profile is more important than strict feature complementarity. 
Dendrix, on the other hand, is more appropriate to find multiple sets of features that are 
highly complementary in a subset of samples with less emphasis in fitting the target. These 
methods are all complementary approaches that emphasize different aspects of feature 
selection and have potential applicability depending on the problem setting.

 REVEALER results for transcriptional activation of β-catenin in cancer. A) This heatmap 
illustrates the use of the REVEALER approach to find complementary genomic alterations 
that match the transcriptional activation of β-catenin in cancer. The target profile is a TCF4 
reporter that provides an estimate of the degree of activation of β-catenin. The “seed” is the 
β-catenin activating mutations, the known “cause” of high values in the target. REVEALER 
iterates two times and finds APC mutations and the amplification of 13q33 as 
complementary alterations. At the bottom the heatmap shows the complete set genomic 
alterations associated with activation of β-catenin found by REVEALER. As can be seen in 
the figure the features are highly complementary and account for 17 out of the top 20 
samples with highest reporter values. B) Profiles of the features shown in Figure 2A, 
compared with an shRNA profile of β-catenin dependence in 209 cell lines (Supplementary 
Information). The 3 features are associated with a high degree of β-catenin essentiality but 
are also highly complementary to each other. The IC scores and nominal p-values with 
respect to the target are shown on the right side of the heatmap.

REVEALER results for transcriptional NRF2 activation in lung cancer. A) The target profile 
is the single-sample GSEA profile of a group of NRF2-driven genes in a group of 182 lung 
cancer cell lines. The seed feature was defined as the status of NRF2 mutation or 
amplification. The first iteration of REVEALER identifies KEAP1 mutation, a known co-
activator of NRF2, as a potential cause of activation of NRF2 complementary to the seed 
feature. The second iteration identifies amplification of chr15q22/26 containing the locus of 
NOX5 (NADPH oxidase 5). B) Results of luciferase assay using antioxidant response 
element (ARE) reporter as readout of NRF2 pathway activation and open-reading frame 
(ORF) constructs for NOX5 (REVEALER result), NRF2 (positive control) and LacZ and no 
vector as negative controls (two tailed unpaired t-test: NOX5 vs. LacZ *p>0.01, NRF2 vs. 
LacZ **p>0.001).

mutations, all well-known oncogenes upstream of MEK, as complementary “causes” of 
MEK-inhibitor sensitivity.

 a well-known cause of activation, and the genomic features matrix represents mutations and 
copy number alterations in the same cell lines. REVEALER identifies a copy number gain 
(CNG) across a region on chromosome 8q23–24 as the most complementary genomic 
alteration to KRAS mutation in order to explain KRAS dependency. Other features such as 
amplifications in chr9p21, and chr12p12 and deletions in chr9q12 are also identified but 
with lesser incremental benefit. B) Pattern of copy number changes in cancer cells that have 
gain in 8q23–24 show that copy number changes centromeric to MYC have two distinct 
patterns. Red indicates regions of chromosomal gain (log2 ratio >0.6). C) Dot plot of relative 
KRAS dependence across cell lines with various genotypes (X-axis). Differential KRAS 
dependence between cells were examined between cells with copy number gain on 8q23–24 
relative to cells with other genotype (student t-test with Welch’s Correction ***p<0.0001). 
D) Dot plot of relative MYC mRNA expression across cell lines with various genotypes (X-
axis). Differential MYC mRNA levels were assessed between cells with copy number gain 
on 8q23–24 vs. MYC amplification (student t-test with Welch’s Correction ***p<0.0001). 
E) Validation of KRAS dependence in non-small cell lung cancer cells with indicated 
genotypic status. Cancer cells which harbor 8q23–24 gain from the CCLE were chosen and 
their relative KRAS dependence was assessed for cells that either have mutations in KRAS 
or those that harbor 8q23–24 alteration (KRAS mutant cells: NCIH2009, NCIH1944, A549, 
NCIH1792), 8q23–24 gain: NCIH2110, NCIH1781, NCIH1648, NCIH2126, NCIH2342, 
Others: NCIH28, NCIH1437, NCIH2228). Relative viability was assessed using CellTiter-
Glo assay (Promega) and by normalizing the luminescence values of shKRAS infected cells 
with shLuciferase controls 7 days post-infection.

Each row corresponds to one method’s results. The first method is REVEALER as described in the examples in the main text, the second is 
REVEALER without the seed, the third is the ElasticNet and the fourth is Dendrix. The quantities shown are the target association score, the 
absolute value of the IC of the summary feature consisting of the combination of all the top selected features, and the feature complementarity 
index, 1 minus the average IC across pairs of features. A higher complementary index means that the features are more mutually exclusive.
