ABSTRACT
Produce is increasingly recognized as a reservoir of human pathogens
and transferable antibiotic resistance genes. This study aimed to explore methods to
characterize the transferable resistome of bacteria associated with produce. Mixed
salad, arugula, and cilantro purchased from supermarkets in Germany were analyzed
by means of cultivation- and DNA-based methods. Before and after a nonselective
enrichment step, tetracycline (TET)-resistant Escherichia coli were isolated and plas-
mids conferring TET resistance were captured by exogenous plasmid isolation. TET-
resistant E. coli isolates, transconjugants, and total community DNA (TC-DNA) from
the microbial fraction detached from leaves or after enrichment were analyzed for
the presence of resistance genes, class 1 integrons, and various plasmids by real-
time PCR and PCR-Southern blot hybridization. Real-time PCR primers were devel-
oped for IncI and IncF plasmids. TET-resistant E. coli isolated from arugula and cilan-
tro carried IncF, IncI1, IncN, IncHI1, IncU, and IncX1 plasmids. Three isolates from
cilantro were positive for IncN plasmids and blaCTX-M-1. From mixed salad and cilan-
tro, IncF, IncI1, and IncP-1� plasmids were captured exogenously. Importantly,
whereas direct detection of IncI and IncF plasmids in TC-DNA failed, these plasmids
became detectable in DNA extracted from enrichment cultures. This confirms that
cultivation-independent DNA-based methods are not always sufficiently sensitive to
detect the transferable resistome in the rare microbiome. In summary, this study
showed that an impressive diversity of self-transmissible multiple resistance plasmids
was detected in bacteria associated with produce that is consumed raw, and exoge-
nous capturing into E. coli suggests that they could transfer to gut bacteria as well.
IMPORTANCE Produce is one of the most popular food commodities. Unfortunately,
leafy greens can be a reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance genes. We found
that IncF and IncI plasmids were the most prevalent plasmid types in E. coli isolates
from produce. This study highlights the importance of the rare microbiome associ-
ated with produce as a source of antibiotic resistance genes that might escape
cultivation-independent detection, yet may be transferred to human pathogens or
commensals.

espite its benefit to human health, consumption of produce is increasingly rec-
ognized as a source of pathogenic bacteria, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs)
(1–5). Recently, several foodborne disease outbreaks have been associated with pro-
duce contamination worldwide (5–9). The microbiome of produce is important for plant
health and vigor and was shown to be highly dynamic during growth and postharvest
(10), but can also contain potentially pathogenic bacteria from human and animal

 sources, including Escherichia coli strains (11). Contamination can occur preharvest (i.e.,
through organic fertilizers, soil, wild animals, or contaminated irrigation water) and
postharvest (12, 13).
Antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens has increased globally due to the
widespread use and misuse of antibiotics (14–17). Antibiotic resistance levels in E. coli
are useful indicators of overall resistance levels of bacteria on foods and in animals and
humans (11). Antibiotic resistance and ARGs have been documented for enteric bac-
teria from various types of produce, which could facilitate the dissemination of resistant
bacteria to a wider community of people (1, 2, 4, 16,18, 19). If ARGs are localized on
MGEs such as plasmids or conjugative transposons they can be transferred horizontally
to pathogens (20). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) takes place at sites with high cell
densities of plasmid donors and recipients, nutrient availability, and selective pressure.
The phytosphere, including the rhizosphere and the phyllosphere, have been reported
as hot spots of HGT (21). The plasmid-mediated resistome of produce bacteria might
provide the enterobacteria with ARGs in the intestine under selective conditions.
Conjugative plasmids can often confer resistance not only toward multiple antibiotics
but also toward heavy metal compounds or disinfectants, making coselection possible
(22–25). Although plasmids belonging to the incompatibility groups IncF and IncI have
a narrow host range (NHR), they are assumed to be important for the dissemination of
ARGs in E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae (26, 27). Most importantly, resistance- and
virulence-associated traits of E. coli isolates were almost exclusively found on IncF
group plasmids (28–30). However, no real-time PCR (RT-PCR) systems that allow the
cultivation-independent detection and quantification of these plasmids in total com-
munity DNA (TC-DNA) are available.
In this study, culture-dependent and -independent approaches were employed to
assess the transferable resistome of bacteria associated with produce (Fig. 1). We
focused on tetracycline (TET) resistance because of the large amounts of tetracyclines
used in animal husbandries resulting in a high load released into the agro-ecosystem
via organic fertilizers (31). TET-resistant E. coli was isolated from produce directly after
purchase and after seven days of storage by selective plating with and without prior

 nonselective enrichment. In addition, transferable TET resistance plasmids were cap-
tured into E. coli recipient strains using the so-called exogenous plasmid isolation
method (32). New real-time PCR primers were developed for the detection and quan-
tification of IncF and IncI plasmids. TC-DNA was also extracted from the microbial
fraction detached from produce or after nonselective enrichment to detect and quan-
tify the abundance of ARGs and MGEs.
RESULTS
Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of TET-resistant E. coli isolates. To
find out whether produce was a source of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, we determined the
occurrence and resistance profiles of TET-resistant E. coli isolated from 24 samples of
produce directly or after an overnight enrichment step. The phenotypic characteriza-
tion of a total of 63 TET-resistant E. coli isolates from cilantro (n � 54), arugula (n � 7),
and mixed salad (n � 2), of which 50 were recovered after nonselective enrichment and
13 without enrichment (20.6%) revealed an impressive diversity (Table 1).
Almost all E. coli isolates were resistant to antibiotics from at least one class, and two
isolates were resistant to eight antibiotic classes, tetracyclines (TET and D), penicillins
(AM and AMX), third generation cephalosporins (CTX and CRO), fluoroquinolones (CIP,
OFX, and NA), aminoglycosides (GM and S), sulfonamides (SD), phenicols (C), and
trimethoprim (TMP). Most of the TET-resistant E. coli also displayed resistance to
ampicillin and amoxicillin (84%) and trimethoprim (73%). Resistances to ofloxacin,
ciprofloxacin, sulfadiazine, and streptomycin were also common. We tested all of the
isolates for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) with the
double-disc diffusion test (DDT) and found three ESBL-producing E. coli which were
isolated from two of the cilantro samples.
We then genotypically characterized the collection of E. coli isolates for the presence
of various resistance genes [tet(A), strA, sul1, sul2, sul3, aadA, qacE and/or qacE�1
(qacE/qacE�1), merRT�P, bla genes (TEM, CTX-M, and SHV), qnr genes (qnrA, qnrB, and
qnrS)] and integrase genes intI1 and intI2 by RT-PCR or regular PCR of genomic DNA
(Table 1). The most commonly detected ARG was the tetracycline resistance gene tet(A),
which was found in 59 out of 63 isolates. A total of 10 isolates were positive for the
sulfonamide resistance genes sul1, 14 for sul2, and five for sul3. The combinations of
sul1 and sul2, sul2 and sul3, and sul1 and sul3 were detected in seven, three, and one
isolate, respectively. All three sul genes were found in one TET-resistant E. coli isolate
from cilantro. The qnrB and qnrS genes encoding fluoroquinolone resistance were
detected alone or in combination in one and 38 isolates, respectively. The blaTEM genes
encoding resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin were detected in 82.5% of TET-
resistant E. coli isolates. The blaCTX-M-1 gene encoding ESBL resistance was detected in
only three isolates and was found in combination with blaTEM genes in two E. coli from
cilantro. The blaSHV gene encoding ESBL resistance was not detected in any of the
isolates. For the streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance genes, aadA (24 isolates) was
most common, followed by strA (21 isolates) and aadA and strA (three isolates).
The class 1 integron integrase gene intI1 was detected in 50 isolates, while the class
2 integron integrase gene intI2 was not detected at all. Although qacE�1 encoding
quaternary ammonium compound resistance is a typical component of class 1 inte-
grons, the qacE and/or qacE�1 genes were detected in only 23 isolates, suggesting a
large proportion of atypical class 1 integrons. Interestingly, merRT�P encoding regula-
tion, transport, and extracellular mercury-binding was detected in 12 isolates. These
findings show that produce can be a source of multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates.
Characterization of plasmids in TET-resistant E. coli isolates. To test if the
TET-resistant E. coli isolates recovered from produce harbor plasmids and to assign
them to known plasmid groups, their genomic DNA was screened by TaqMan probe-
based RT-PCR systems for IncF and IncI plasmids and by PCR-based replicon typing
(PBRT) (Table 1). All isolates that were positive by RT-PCR targeting the IncF (traI gene)
were also identified by replicon typing as IncF, confirming the specificity of the novel
TaqMan RT-PCR system. However, PBRT also allowed assignment to the different IncF

 subgroups. Furthermore, other plasmids were also identified by PBRT or RT-PCR (korB,
specific for IncP-1 plasmids) or PCR (IncN). A summary of the plasmid/replicon types
detected among the 63 representative TET-resistant E. coli isolates is given in Table 1.
For cilantro and arugula, almost all TET-resistant E. coli isolates contained plasmids (61
out of 63), but the plasmids detected in the two isolates from mixed salad could not be
assigned using RT-PCR or PBRT. In most isolates (n � 45), one plasmid type was
detected, but some had two (n � 15) or three (n � 1) plasmids. Plasmids from seven
different Inc groups were found in the 63 E. coli isolates, IncFII (n � 21), IncI1 (n � 17),
IncX1 (n � 11), IncFIB (n � 10), IncU (n � 6), IncN (n � 4), and IncHI1 (n � 2). All Inc
groups were found in E. coli isolates from cilantro, whereas only two Inc groups were
found in isolates from arugula, IncI1 (n � 5) and IncFII (n � 2). Plasmids of the IncF
groups (FII and FIB) were the predominant types, followed by IncI1 and IncX1 plasmids.
The combination of replicon types IncFII and IncFIB was detected in two isolates,
whereas the combination of replicon types IncFII and IncI1 and the combination of
IncFIB and IncI1 were found in six and five isolates, respectively. In one isolate from
cilantro, the combination IncFII, IncFIB and IncI1 was detected. IncI2 plasmids were not
detected in any of the E. coli isolates.
Conjugal transfer of antibiotic resistance. Conjugation experiments were con-
ducted in order to determine the potential transfer of antibiotic resistances to other
bacteria. Conjugal transfer experiments were performed using TET-resistant E. coli
isolates positive for ESBL (EK2.29, EK3.43, and EK3.44) as donors and kanamycin- and
rifampin-resistant E. coli CV601 as a recipient at 37°
C. We selected transconjugants on
LB plates containing tetracycline and cefotaxime, which corresponded to phenotypes
of the donors. The transfer of the resistance phenotypes was successful.
Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of plasmids captured via exoge-
nous isolation. We further investigated the presence of transferable plasmids in
produce by capturing TET resistance plasmids from nonselective enrichment cultures of
fresh leaves from cilantro, mixed salad, or arugula by exogenous plasmid isolation into
E. coli CV601. TET-resistant transconjugants were captured only on day 0 but not on day
7. The transfer frequencies of TET-resistant transconjugants were 1.73 � 10�7,
1.55 � 10�4, and 4.66 � 10�9 per recipient in cilantro, mixed salad, and arugula,
respectively. While all transconjugants obtained from cilantro (n � 27) and arugula
(n � 23) were characterized, a total of only 41 transconjugants from mixed salad
was analyzed due to the high number of transconjugants obtained. Based on initial
phenotypic and genotypic analyses, 15 representative out of 91 TET-resistant transcon-
jugants from produce (cilantro, n � 12; arugula, n � 1; mixed salad, n � 2) were
selected for further characterization. The majority of these transconjugants acquired
resistance to at least two antibiotic classes, and all were resistant to tetracycline,
ampicillin, and amoxicillin. The blaTEM genes encoding ampicillin and amoxicillin resis-
tances were detected in 86.7% of TET-resistant transconjugants (Table 2). The tetracy-
cline resistance gene tet(A) was found in 13 out of 15 transconjugants from cilantro and
arugula but not from mixed salad, while tet(Q) was detected in only one plasmid
(pBMS1) isolated from the mixed salad. Four tetracycline resistance plasmids (pBC1.1,
pBC1.3, pBC1.9, and pBC1.12) captured from cilantro carried the insertion sequence
IS1071, class 1 integrons (intI1) and tetracycline resistance gene tet(A), but also encoded
resistance to ampicillin (blaTEM), and mercury compounds (merRT�P). Eight plasmids
from cilantro transconjugants (pBC2.1, pBC2.2, pBC2.3, pBC2.4, pBC2.6, pBC2.8,
pBC2.11, and pBC2.15) carried tet(A), qnrS, and blaTEM and two of the plasmids (pBC2.1
and pBC2.4) carried in addition sul1 and sul2, respectively. Two TET resistance plasmids
(pBMS1 and pBMS4) captured from mixed salad carried sul1, strA, merRT�P, blaTEM, and
intI1. One plasmid (pBA1) captured from arugula carried blaTEM and tet(A) (Table 2).
Thus, this approach demonstrates that transferable multidrug resistance plasmids were
easily captured by E. coli CV601, a process that might also occur in the human gut.

 presence of IncF and IncI plasmids and was validated by PBRT. In addition, other
plasmids were also identified by RT-PCR (korB, specific for IncP-1 plasmids) and South-
ern blot hybridization. Plasmids of known Inc groups were detected in all transconju-
gants from the mixed salad and cilantro but not in the transconjugants from arugula.
Representative transconjugants from cilantro and mixed salad carried either one (n �
11) or two (n � 3) replicons. In 12 transconjugants from cilantro samples, four different
plasmid replicon types were detected (Table 2), IncFII (n � 3), IncFIB (n � 6), IncI1 (n �
2), and IncP-1� (n � 4). In contrast, the transconjugants isolated from mixed salad
showed only one replicon type, IncFII (n � 2). One plasmid that could not be assigned
by PBRT or RT-PCR was isolated from arugula leaves. The combination of replicon types
IncFII and IncP-1� was detected in two transconjugants (pBC1.9 and pBC1.12), while the
combination of replicon types of plasmids IncFIB and IncI1 was found in one transcon-
jugant (pBC2.3) captured from cilantro leaves. Southern blot hybridization for se-
quences specific for IncP-1 plasmids revealed that four plasmids belonged to the
IncP-1� subgroup. IncI2 plasmids were not detected in any TET-resistant transconju-
gants (Table 2). In contrast to IncFIB/FII and IncI1 plasmids, the IncP-1� plasmids
captured exogenously were not detected in the 63 TET-resistant E. coli isolates.
Detection of IncF and IncI plasmids, tet(A), and intI1 in total community DNA.
We also screened for plasmids (IncF, IncI1, and IncI2), tetracycline resistance gene tet(A),
and integrase gene intI1 in TC-DNA extracted from bacterial communities either directly
after their detachment from fresh leaves or after an enrichment step, using PCR-
Southern blot hybridization and RT-PCR (Table 3). Using the RT-PCR method, IncF and
IncI plasmids as well as the tet(A) gene were detected in TC-DNA extracted from
enrichment cultures of leaves, but not in TC-DNA from the detached bacteria. In
contrast, the intI1 gene was detected in both kinds of TC-DNA. Consistent with these
results, PCR-Southern blot hybridization targeting the IncF and IncI plasmids and tet(A)
revealed strong hybridization signals in TC-DNA extracted from the enrichment cultures
but very weak or no signals from direct extractions.
DISCUSSION
The present study showed that bacteria associated with produce can carry various
plasmids that might represent an important link between the environmental and the
human gut microbiomes. Although initially low in abundance, TET-resistant E. coli were
isolated from all purchased produce samples after nonselective enrichment. Contam-

 ination of produce with E. coli strains can occur in the field through contaminated soil
(organic fertilizers), exposure to contaminated irrigation water, or during postharvest
(12, 13). In this study, TET-resistant E. coli isolates were mostly isolated from cilantro that
was purchased from supermarkets in Braunschweig and Magdeburg, Germany, fol-
lowed by mixed ready-to-eat salad and arugula purchased from supermarkets in
Braunschweig. This suggests that produce might be a hot spot for contamination with
E. coli carrying multidrug resistance plasmids that occur at low abundance. A high
proportion of the TET-resistant E. coli isolates was also resistant to penicillins (AM and
AMX) and trimethoprim. Although it is difficult to compare among studies because of
different methodologies used for isolation and resistance testing, our results are in line
with high resistance levels to penicillins and trimethoprim previously reported for E. coli
from irrigation water and vegetables (18), ready-to-eat salads (1), and lettuce (2). In the
present study, TET resistance was commonly conferred by tet(A), partly confirming
previous studies reporting tet(A) and tet(B) genes as the most common TET resistance
genes in E. coli and Salmonella spp. isolated from ready-to-eat vegetables (1, 33). The
rapid dissemination of tetracycline resistance among bacteria has been related not only
to the occurrence of TET resistance genes on transposons and conjugative plasmids (22,
23, 34), but also to selective pressure, e.g., the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry
and the spread of TET resistance genes via organic fertilizers (31).
Plasmid-mediated multidrug resistance plays an important role in the transfer of
ARGs around the world (35). Our study showed that E. coli isolates from produce
harbored various plasmids belonging to replicon types IncF, IncI1, IncX1, IncU, IncN,
and IncHI1, with IncF plasmids being the most frequently detected. These plasmids
might play an important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistances. IncF
plasmids were found predominantly in E. coli isolated from drinking water (36) and
poultry farms (37). In our study, IncFII was the most frequently detected replicon type
(36.5%), followed by IncFIB (15.9%), which is in line with studies on E. coli recovered
from pigs and humans (38), wastewater (39), and animals (40). The combination of
replicon types IncFII and IncFIB in two isolates is consistent with a report on Entero-
bacter cloacae from lettuce (3). However, we cannot exclude that these replicons are
located on the same plasmid, as several studies have reported the combination of
replicon types as a multireplicon on a single plasmid (30, 41–43), likely due to
cointegration (28). In this study, TET-resistant E. coli isolates which carried IncF plasmids
were also positive for tet(A), aadA, sul1, sul2, sul3, qacE and/or qacE�1, qnrB, qnrS, or
blaTEM genes. Previous reports found that IncF plasmids can carry genes conferring
resistance to all major antibiotic classes, including aminoglycosides, �-lactams, pheni-
cols, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones (38, 40, 44).
The NHR IncI1 plasmid types were the second most dominant replicon type (34.9%)

 and IncI1-positive isolates also carried multiple ARGs. In this study, strains carrying IncI1
plasmids were also positive for class 1 integron integrase gene intI1 and a diverse set
of resistance genes, namely tet(A), sul2, strA, blaTEM, qacE and/or qacE�1, aadA, sul3,
qnrS, and/or merRT�P. In a recent study, IncI1 plasmids from irrigation water and lettuce
carried genes sul1, tet(A), aadA, strA, and blaTEM as well as intI1 (18). Similar phenotype
and genotype profiles among E. coli strains from the current study and those recovered
in previous studies from clinical samples, the environment, or other foods indicate that
produce may play a potential role in the dispersal of E. coli carrying plasmid-localized
ARGs. Thus, plasmids belonging to the IncF and IncI groups have the potential to be
major contributors worldwide to the propagation of ARGs within enteric bacteria. One
dissemination route of enteric bacteria carrying IncF and IncI plasmids might be the
consumption of produce.
The newly developed TaqMan probe-based RT-PCR assays demonstrated high spec-
ificity in detecting these plasmids in E. coli isolates, and RT-PCR-positive isolates were
also assigned by PBRT, which in addition enables subtyping.
This is the first study identifying NHR plasmids such as IncX1 and IncHI1 and
broad-host-range (BHR) plasmid IncU in E. coli isolates recovered from cilantro leaves.
Interestingly, IncX plasmids were detected in E. cloacae from lettuce (3). IncHI1 plasmids
were previously reported in E. coli and Citrobacter youngae isolates from water and
healthy calves, respectively (45), while the first IncU plasmids were isolated from
Aeromonas salmonicida (46), and later from Aeromonas caviae from hospital effluent in
the United Kingdom (47). In general, a low prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli was
found on produce, which is similar to previous studies (19, 48, 49). In the present study,
ESBL-producing E. coli were isolated only from cilantro (2.8%).
To our knowledge, this is also the first report of E. coli isolates from cilantro that were
positive for conjugative IncN plasmids, blaCTX-M-1, and resistance to third generation
cephalosporins. The blaCTX-M-1 gene was also reported on plasmids belonging to the
IncN family in E. coli isolated from farm workers, animals, humans, and the environment
(50–52). Although IncN plasmids are able to replicate in a variety of Enterobacteriaceae,
they are most frequently found in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, where they
contribute to the dissemination of cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance (53).
The results of the present study showed that E. coli isolates harboring the blaCTX-M-1
gene also conferred resistance to at least seven classes of antibiotics tested. Moreover,
E. coli harboring CTX-M genes were recently reported from lettuce and irrigation water
(4, 54), raw vegetables (33, 54), and coastal waters (55, 56). Kim et al. (57) reported that
ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying CTX-M were detected in
ready-to-eat vegetables form a local retail market in Seoul, South Korea. A recent study
has detected blaTEM genes in association with IncF and IncI1 plasmids from irrigation
water and lettuce from 16 household farms in Estarreja, Portugal (18).
In previous reports, the occurrence of sul1 and qacE�1 was frequently associated
with class 1 integrons (3, 58). Unexpectedly, only 27% and 36.5% of sul1- and qacE/
qacE�1-positive isolates carried the intI1 gene, respectively, indicating that atypical
class 1 integrons were more prevalent among the isolates, as previously also reported
by Amos et al. (59).
In the present study, transferable TET resistance plasmids were also directly cap-
tured from the produce microbiomes on day 0 but not on day 7 after purchase, and the
highest transfer frequency was observed in mixed salad, followed by cilantro and
arugula. Differences in observed frequencies of transconjugants could be due to
different abundances of bacteria with conjugative plasmids in the various sample types,
or due to real differences in the frequencies of plasmid transfer. The latter might be
affected by the metabolic activity of the produce microbiome, as plasmid transfer
frequency is known to depend not only on plasmid-specific characteristics, but also on
ecological factors affecting the metabolic activity of bacteria (60). Replicon types IncFII,
IncFIB, IncI1, and IncP-1� were captured from cilantro leaves, whereas only IncFII
plasmids were captured from mixed salad. IncF (FII and FIB) plasmids were prevalent
among TET-resistant transconjugants from both types of produce. Most of the IncF

 plasmids exogenously captured harbored blaTEM, tet(A), and qnrS genes. One IncI1
plasmid was captured from cilantro, and another one was captured in combination
with replicon type IncFIB. The conjugative plasmids carried tet(A) and blaTEM genes.
Finally, four IncP-1� plasmids were captured from cilantro leaves and two of them in
combination with replicon type IncFII. IncP-1 plasmids have been frequently captured
by exogenous plasmid isolation from various environments such as sewage sludge (61),
manure (23), and water (62). However, the first isolations of IncP-1 plasmids were from
clinical isolates (63, 64). The IncP-1� plasmids carried genes conferring resistances to
antibiotics tet(A), strA, and blaTEM and also mercury compounds (merRT�P) and disin-
fectants (qacE/qacE�1).
In conclusion, this study showed that produce that we eat might contain bacteria
such as E. coli carrying transferable multidrug resistance plasmids. Although E. coli
numbers are typically low, our nonselective enrichments showed that proliferation can
easily occur. Our study reports a specific TaqMan probe-based RT-PCR assay that can be
used for rapid detection of IncF and IncI plasmids in E. coli isolates and exogenously
captured plasmids as well as in TC-DNA extracted from enrichment cultures of leaves.
However, quantifying these plasmids in TC-DNA directly extracted from the microbial
fraction detached from leaves was impossible due to their low abundance in the
microbiome, but IncF and IncI plasmids were detected in DNA extracted after previous
enrichment. While these assays represent an important and useful tool to be imple-
mented for monitoring the prevalence of IncF and IncI plasmids in isolates and the
environment, negative results of these and other cultivation-independent methods can
lead to an underestimation of the mobile resistome present in the rare microbiome of
produce and other samples. This is the first study demonstrating that multidrug
resistance plasmids present in produce-associated bacteria were transferable to sensi-
tive E. coli recipients, a process that could occur in the human gut. The NHR plasmids
IncF and IncI1 and also the BHR IncP-1� plasmids were captured from the produce. In
particular, the captured IncF and Inc1 plasmids conferred resistance toward several
classes of antibiotics. Thus, produce-associated bacteria should be considered an
important route of disseminating transferable antibiotic resistances, which might be
particularly relevant for patients under antibiotic treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. A total of 24 samples from different locally produced or imported produce
(mixed salad, arugula, and cilantro) was analyzed. The mixed salad and arugula were purchased from
local supermarkets in Braunschweig, Germany, in June and September 2016, and cilantro was obtained
from supermarkets in Braunschweig and Magdeburg, Germany, in May 2017. The produce was stored at
refrigerator temperature and sampled on days 0 and 7 (four replicates for each time point and produce
type).
Isolation and identification of TET-resistant E. coli. For sampling, the produce was cut into pieces
using a sterile scalpel and mixed. For each sample, 25 g each were filled in two stomacher bags (one for
direct plating and the other for enrichment) and mixed three times with 75 ml buffered peptone water
(BPW; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), with subsequent stomacher treatment performed with the Stomacher
400 (Seward, Worthing, United Kingdom) at high speed for 1 min. The enrichment cultures of fresh leaves
in BPW were incubated at 37°
C with shaking (150 rpm) for 18 to 24 h. In order to isolate TET-resistant E.
coli, dilutions (10�1 and 10�2) of the sample suspensions and 100 �l of the enrichment cultures were
plated on different culture media (eosin methylene blue [EMB]; Sifin, Berlin, Germany, and Chromocult
coliform agar [CCA]; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with tetracycline (10 mg liter�1). All
plates were incubated at 37°
C for 18 to 24 h. The presumptive E. coli colonies were picked from each
sample and streaked onto EMB, CCA, and TBX chromogenic agar (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for
confirmation by colony morphology and further characterization. E. coli isolates were then confirmed
by biochemical tests for indole production, methyl red, and catalase activity (65). Furthermore,
isolates were analyzed using PCR for the presence of the gadA gene encoding glutamate decar-
boxylase, specific for E. coli (66). E. coli isolates were stored in Luria broth (LB; Roth, Karlsruhe,
Germany) containing 15% glycerol at �80°
C.
Exogenous plasmid isolation. In order to capture tetracycline resistance plasmids, exogenous
plasmid isolation via biparental mating was performed using gfp�-, kanamycin (Km)-, and rifampin
(Rif)-resistant Escherichia coli CV601 (67) as a recipient. The recipient strain was grown overnight in tryptic
soy broth (TSB; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with rifampin (Rif) (50 mg liter�1) and
kanamycin (Km) (50 mg liter�1). Two milliliters of the recipient strain culture was transferred into a sterile
Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 3,100 � g for 5 min and washed twice with 1:10 TSB. Then, the pellet
was resuspended in 2 ml of 1:10 TSB. The bacterial suspensions (donor) of each sample on days 0 and

 7 were prepared from enrichment cultures of fresh leaves as described above. Twenty milliliters of each
enrichment culture (donor) and 0.5 ml of recipient strain were mixed in a 50-ml falcon tube. As a
background control, 5 ml of the enrichment cultures and 200 �l of the recipient were processed the same
way as the samples. All mixtures were centrifuged at 3,100 � g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended
in 200 �l of 1:10 TSB and then spotted onto a filter for mating (Millipore filters, 0.22 �m). Filters were
incubated overnight at 28°
C on plate count agar plates (PCA; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented
with cycloheximide (Cyc) (100 mg liter�1). After incubation, the filters were placed in 2 ml of sterile 0.85%
NaCl solution in a 50-ml falcon tube. Each filter was washed by vortexing for 1 min. Serial 10-fold
dilutions were done and appropriate dilutions were plated on PCA agar supplemented with rifampin (Rif;
50 mg liter�1), kanamycin (Km; 50 mg liter�1), cycloheximide (Cyc; 100 mg liter�1), and tetracycline (TET;
15 mg liter�1) to select for tetracycline-resistant transconjugants. Background controls of bulk soil and
the recipient controls were plated on the same selective media. Numbers of recipient cells were
determined by applying three replicate 20-�l drops per each serial dilution (10�5 to 10�8) of all mating
mixes on PCA with Km (50 mg liter�1), Rif (50 mg liter�1), and Cyc (100 mg liter�1). All plates were
incubated at 28°
C for up to 3 days. Transconjugants were determined by green fluorescence resulting
from the green fluorescence protein (GFP). The identity of putative transconjugants was confirmed by
BOX-PCR (68). Transfer frequencies were calculated as total number of transconjugants divided by the
total number of recipients.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk
diffusion method on Müller-Hinton agar (MH; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), according to the European
Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The antibiotics (�g) (Becton, Dickinson and
Company, USA) used in this study were amoxicillin (25), ampicillin (10), cefotaxime (30), ceftazidime (30),
ceftriaxone (30), chloramphenicol (30), ciprofloxacin (5), colistin (10), TET (30), doxycycline (30), strepto-
mycin (10), gentamicin (10), ofloxacin (5), kanamycin (30), nalidixic acid (30), trimethoprim (5), and
sulfadiazine (250). TET-resistant E. coli isolates were streaked onto LB agar supplemented with TET (10 mg
liter�1), while TET-resistant E. coli CV601 transconjugants were streaked on plate count agar plates (PCA;
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with TET (15 mg liter�1), Km (50 mg liter�1), and Rif (50 mg
liter�1). E. coli strain CV601 was used as a negative control. The bacterial suspension was prepared from
a single colony in normal saline (0.85% NaCl) to a density of 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. Cotton
swabs were used for streaking the suspension onto MH agar plates. After air drying, antibiotic discs
were placed on the plates. Then all plates were incubated at 37°
C for 18 to 24 h. The inhibition zone
was measured. The results were interpreted according to the guidelines of EUCAST. Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations were used when antibiotic breakpoints in
EUCAST guidelines were absent (i.e., for doxycycline, streptomycin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid).
ESBL production was confirmed among TET-resistant E. coli isolates and transconjugants by double-
disc diffusion test (DDT) (48). The ESBL producers were identified by phenotypic confirmatory test
according to the CLSI.
TC-DNA extraction. The bacterial fraction detached from fresh leaves directly or after an
enrichment culture of each sample as described above were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,100 �
g for 15 min at 4°
C. Total community DNA was extracted from the pellet using the FastDNA spin kit
for soil (MP Biomedicals, Heidelberg, Germany), according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. The
quality of extracted DNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The extracted DNA was
stored at �20°
C until further analysis.
Genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted from overnight cultures of TET-resistant E.
coli isolates, transconjugants, and the recipient strain with a Qiagen genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) using a silica-based kit (silica bead DNA extraction kit; Thermo Scientific, St. Leon-Rot,
Germany). The extracted genomic DNA was stored at �20°
C until further analysis.
Primer-probe design (IncF, IncI1, and IncI2 plasmids). As it is known that relaxase genes can be
used for classification of the mobilization systems of plasmids (69), the traI gene region was chosen as
a target region to design primers detecting IncF, IncI1, and IncI2 plasmid sequences. A total of 4,530
plasmid DNA sequences were downloaded from NCBI (NCBI, Batch Entrez) using the 4,602 plasmid
accession numbers found in GenBank by Shintani et al. (70), among which 298 plasmids were identified
as belonging to the MOBF group. The coding sequences (CDS) of the MOBF plasmids were aligned using
tBLASTn against the relaxase TraI of the F plasmid (GenBank accession number AP001918), resulting in
110 protein sequences sharing �50% identity and �70% coverage. The 110 protein sequences closely
related to TraI were aligned using MAFT multiple sequence alignment software version 1.3.3. The
alignment produced was back translated using the EMBOSS Backtranseq tool and used to generate a set
of degenerated primers and probes using Primer3. All of those steps were carried out in Geneious 8.1.9.
At best, 83 of the 110 traI nucleic acid sequences could be targeted by one set of designed primers and
probe (Table 4). Those sequences belonged mostly to plasmids isolated from Salmonella enterica and
Escherichia coli and a few from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella spp. The plasmids corresponded to
a part of the subclade MOBF12 defined by Garcillán-Barcia et al. (71), which comprises the phylo-
genetically broad IncF complex. When tested against the 4,530 plasmids, the primer/probe targeted
92 plasmids in the database, and 89 of these plasmids belonged to the MOBF group (298 plasmids
recovered belonged to this group) and three were annotated as “non-mob” and belonged to any
MOB group. When looking at the “Inc” classification, 73 of the targeted plasmids belonged to the
IncF (including FI and FII), 14 to the IncZ, and five to the pCD1 type. Among the 4,530 plasmid
sequences, 243 carried a rep gene belonging to the IncF group, indicating that the primer/probe
cannot detect all possible IncF plasmids.

 Available IncI plasmid sequences were downloaded from NCBI. The traI genes were aligned using the
software CLC Main Workbench version 8 (CLC bio, Qiagen) with standard settings for alignments, and
primers were designed to match conserved regions of the traI gene (Table 4). The specificity was
confirmed in silico with NCBI primer BLAST and with a set of plasmids from other incompatibility groups.
Plasmids used for this test were R388, pB10, pHHV216, RSF1010, pSM1890, RP4, pHH3-414, pHH2-227,

pD2RT, pD67, pWW0, and pST527, from which none was amplified.
Detection of IncF, IncI plasmids by real-time PCR. The RT-PCR assay was performed under
standard conditions. All real-time PCR (RT-PCR) reactions were set up in a 25 �l reaction volume using
a Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase (M0495L, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) contain-
ing 5 �l of template DNA, 300 nM primer (reverse), 50 nM primer (forward), and 50 nM probe for IncF,
and 300 nM primer each (forward and reverse) and TaqMan probe for IncI. All primers and probes are
described in Table 4. The following PCR program was used for amplification: 10 min at 95°
C, followed by
40 cycles of 95°
C for 30 sec and 60°
C for 1 min. The assays were carried out in triplicate with real-time
PCR 5=-nuclease assays (TaqMan RT-PCR) in a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Negative controls were included in all tests, and they consisted of all the elements of the
reaction except for the template DNA.
Standard plasmids were used to construct a full standard curve in duplicate in each RT-PCR run.
Standard plasmids were constructed by cloning the purified PCR products amplified from the plasmids
R64 for IncI1, pHNSHP45 for IncI2, and F plasmid for IncF using the corresponding primer pairs used for
the RT-PCR, into TransforMax EC100 electrocompetent E. coli (Epicentre), in pJET1.2 using the Thermo
Scientific CloneJET PCR cloning kit (Thermo Scientific).
Detection of target genes by real-time PCR and PCR. The target genes in genomic DNA extracted
from TET-resistant E. coli isolates and transconjugants were detected by RT-PCR 5=-nuclease assays
(TaqMan or EvaGreen RT-PCR) in a CFX96 RT-PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) or by PCR
for class 1 and 2 integrons; integrase genes intI1 and intI2; korB (IncP-1 plasmids); qacE and/or qacE�1
(qacE/qacE�1) encoding quaternary ammonium compound resistance; aadA and strA encoding strepto-
mycin and spectinomycin resistance; tetracycline resistance genes [tet(Q) and, tet(A)]; the merRT�P gene
part of the mercury resistance operon; sul1, sul2, and sul3 encoding sulfonamide resistance; qnrA, qnrB,
and qnrS encoding fluoroguinolone resistance; �-lactam resistance genes (blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M-1);
IncN (rep); and insertion sequence (IS) IS1071 (represented by the tnpA gene). The DNA of the recipient
strain E. coli CV601 was included as the negative control. The primers and probes targeting these genes
and PCR and RT-PCR conditions are listed in Table 4.
Conjugation assay. TET-resistant E. coli isolates positive for ESBL (EK2.29, EK3.43, and EK3.44) were
examined for their ability to transfer resistance. Briefly, the donors and the rifampin- and kanamycin-
resistant E. coli CV601 recipient strain were grown in LB broth overnight at 37°
C. 500 �l of overnight
cultures of each donor and recipient strain were mixed in 1 ml LB broth and incubated at 37°
C for 24 h
without shaking. 100 �l of the conjugal mixture was spread on LB agar (Roth; Karlsruhe, Germany)
containing Rif (50 mg liter�1), Kan (50 mg liter�1), CTX (2 mg liter�1), and TET (15 mg liter�1), and
incubated at 37°
C for 24 to 48 h. The transconjugants were verified by BOX-PCR and further tested for
the antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes as described above.
Plasmid DNA extraction and detection by Southern blot hybridization. Plasmid DNA extraction
from TET-resistant transconjugants (pBC1.1, pBC1.3, pBC1.9, and pBC1.12) captured exogenously from
the enrichment of cilantro leaves was performed using Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. In order to detect the IncP-1 plasmids with
Southern blot hybridization in these transconjugants, plasmid DNA was digested with the restriction
enzyme NotI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and fragments were separated by electro-
phoresis on a 1% agarose-TBE gel as described previously (72). Southern blot hybridization was
performed with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes generated from PCR amplicons which were obtained
from reference plasmid R751 for IncP1-� as previously described by Binh et al. (73).
Plasmid replicon typing. PBRT was used to identify the incompatibility group of plasmids in
TET-resistant E. coli and transconjugants, and to confirm the presence of IncF and IncI plasmids as
determined via the newly developed RT-PCR method as described above. This was done by PCR
amplification on genomic DNA of the strains using primer sets for 30 replicons, HI1, HI2, I1, I2, X1,
X2, X3, X4, L, M, N, FIA, FIB, FIC, FII, FIIS, FIIK, FIB KN, FIB KQ, W, Y, P1, A/C, T, K, U, R, B/O, HIB-M, and
FIB-M, representative of major plasmid incompatibility groups among Enterobacteriaceae (74, 28).
PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose-TBE gel and stained with
ethidium bromide.
Detection of IncF and IncI plasmids, tet(A), and the class 1 integrase gene intI1 via PCR-
Southern blot hybridization and RT-PCR in TC-DNA. PCR-Southern blot hybridization or RT-PCR was
used to detect tet(A), intI1, IncF, and IncI plasmids in TC-DNA extracted from the microbial fraction
detached from leaves directly or after an enrichment step on days 0 and 7. The PCR products were
separated on a 1% agarose-TBE gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a positively charged nylon
membrane (GE Healthcare, UK). Southern blot hybridization was carried out with digoxigenin (DIG)-
labeled probes generated from PCR amplicons, which were obtained from reference plasmids pKJK5 for
intI1 and tet(A), as described by Dealtry et al. (75), R64 for IncI1, and pHNSHP45 for IncI2 and IncF. The
primers and PCR conditions are listed in Table 4.
