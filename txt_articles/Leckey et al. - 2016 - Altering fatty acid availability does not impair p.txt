doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00855.2015.—We determined the effect of
suppressing lipolysis via administration of nicotinic acid (NA) on fuel
substrate selection and half-marathon running capacity. In a single-
blinded, Latin square design, 12 competitive runners completed four
trials involving treadmill running until volitional fatigue at a pace
based on 95% of personal best half-marathon time. Trials were
completed in a fed or overnight fasted state: 1) carbohydrate (CHO)
ingestion before (2 g CHO·kg�1·body mass�1) and during (44 g/h)
[CFED]; 2) CFED plus NA ingestion [CFED-NA]; 3) fasted with
placebo ingestion during [FAST]; and 4) FAST plus NA ingestion
[FAST-NA]. There was no difference in running distance (CFED,
21.53 � 1.07; CFED-NA, 21.29 � 1.69; FAST, 20.60 � 2.09;
FAST-NA, 20.11 � 1.71 km) or time to fatigue between the four
trials. Concentrations of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol
were suppressed following NA ingestion irrespective of preexercise
nutritional intake but were higher throughout exercise in FAST
compared with all other trials (P � 0.05). Rates of whole-body CHO
oxidation were unaffected by NA ingestion in the CFED and FAST
trials, but were lower in the FAST trial compared with the CFED-NA
trial (P � 0.05). CHO was the primary substrate for exercise in all
conditions, contributing 83-91% to total energy expenditure with only
a small contribution from fat-based fuels. Blunting the exercise-
induced increase in FFA via NA ingestion did not impair intense
running capacity lasting �85 min, nor did it alter patterns of substrate
oxidation in competitive athletes. Although there was a small but
obligatory use of fat-based fuels, the oxidation of CHO-based fuels
predominates during half-marathon running.
carbohydrate; high-intensity running; nicotinic acid; substrate utiliza-
tion; performance
THE MAJOR GOAL OF ENDURANCE training is to induce physiolog-
ical adaptations that increase an athlete’s ability to sustain the
highest average power output or speed of movement for a
given distance or time (14), reduce the oxygen cost (V
˙ O2) of
locomotion, and maintain a higher fractional utilization of
maximal oxygen uptake (V
˙ O2max) during training and compe-
tition (9). Such adaptations depend in part on the rate at which
chemical energy [i.e., fat and carbohydrate (CHO)] can be
converted into mechanical energy for skeletal muscle contrac-
tion (14). In most endurance events, a mix of substrates and
energy-producing pathways contribute to work outputs, and
athletes pursue training/dietary strategies that increase the
overall capacity of these pathways, and they implement acute
competition strategies that ensure optimal substrate availability
to meet the energy cost of the event.
Although the absolute oxidation rate of all energy substrates
increases at the high exercise intensities and power outputs
sustained by athletes in training and competition, CHO-based
fuels are the predominant energy source (4, 6, 17). However,
recent attention has focused on diet-exercise strategies that
reduce skeletal muscle dependence on CHO-based fuels (i.e.,
muscle and liver glycogen, blood glucose, lactate) before and
during exercise while concomitantly maximizing fat oxidation
[adipose and intramuscular triglycerides (TGs), and blood-
borne free fatty acids (FFAs) and TGs] (33). It has been
proposed that such strategies will enhance performance by
promoting greater utilization of fat-based fuels whose avail-
ability is relatively unlimited (33). However, even when these
strategies promote rates of fat oxidation that are substantially
higher than those achieved by the effects of endurance training
alone, there is no clear evidence of a performance benefit (7,
13, 30). Indeed, rates of muscle fat oxidation are inadequate to
support the high relative (70–90% V
˙ O2max) and absolute work
rates sustained by competitive athletes during running or cy-
cling events lasting �2 h (17, 22, 32, 34).
An alternative strategy to test the role of fat availability to
the performance of endurance sports is to investigate scenarios
in which the muscle’s access to fatty substrates is impaired.
Accordingly, in the present study we administered the phar-
macological agent nicotinic acid (NA) during simulated half-
marathon running in both fed and overnight-fasted states. We
hypothesized that suppressing lipolysis via NA ingestion
would not alter substrate selection or have a detrimental effect
on half-marathon running capacity because CHO-based and
not fat-based fuels support optimal endurance exercise up to
�90 min.
METHODS
Participants. Twelve competitive male runners who had completed
a half-marathon within the previous 6 mo were recruited for this
study. Participant characteristics were as follows: age, 31 � 5 (SD) y;
body mass (BM), 70.8 � 5.5 kg; V
˙ O2max, 64.1 � 3.4 ml·kg�1·min�1;
personal best half-marathon time, 80.50 � 4.12 min. At the time of
the investigation, participants were running �82 � 32 km/wk. Par-
ticipants were fully informed of all experimental procedures and
possible risks before providing their written, informed consent. All
participants completed a medical history questionnaire to ensure they
were free from illness and injury before commencing the performance
trials. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee of the Australian Catholic University.
Preliminary testing and familiarization. Each participant com-
pleted an incremental test to volitional fatigue on a motorized tread-
mill (Pulsar 3p; HP Cosmos, Nussdorf-Traunstein, Germany) to

 determine V
˙ O2max. The test commenced at a speed of 12 km/h with a
1% incline and increased by 2 km/h every 2 min until a speed of 16
km/h was reached. Thereafter, the treadmill gradient was increased by
2% every 2 min until the participant reached volitional fatigue,
determined as the inability to maintain the prescribed speed. During
the maximal test and the subsequent described performance trials,
expired gas was collected via open-circuit spirometry (TrueOne 2400;
Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT) and the instantaneous rates of O2 con-
sumption (V
˙ O2), CO2 production (V
˙ CO2), and respiratory exchange
ratio (RER) were calculated every 30 s from conventional equations
(28). Before each test, gas analyzers were calibrated with commer-
cially available gas mixtures (16% O2, 4% CO2), and volume flow
was calibrated using a 3-liter syringe. An individual’s V
˙ O2max was
determined as the highest 30-s average that typically coincided with
an inability to maintain the prescribed pace, an RER �1.15 or a
subjective rating of maximal effort (rate of perceived exertion, RPE).
To familiarize participants to the trial protocol, they completed a
10-km treadmill run within the 10 days before the first performance
trial. To better simulate the metabolic cost of overground running (2)
the treadmill was set at a speed of 95% of individual best half-
marathon (21.1 km) time attained in the last 6 mo with a gradient of
1%. Expired gas was collected at 15 and 30 min, and a CHO gel and
placebo (PLC) capsules were administered at 25 min.
Overview of study design. In a single-blinded, Latin square design,
each participant completed four performance trials in a randomized
order separated by 10–14 d. Participants were blinded to the order of
the trials. Each trial required running to volitional fatigue (i.e., the
inability to maintain the prescribed speed) at a speed of 95% of their
best half-marathon time attained in the last 6 mo with a gradient of 1%
(2). The four performance trials were completed following a preex-
ercise meal with different nutritional values: CHO ingestion before (2
g CHO·kg�1·BM�1) and during (44 g/h) (CFED); CFED plus NA
ingestion (CFED-NA); overnight fasted, PLC meal before, and PLC
during (FAST); and FAST with NA ingestion (FAST-NA).
Exercise and diet control. Participants were instructed to refrain
from any vigorous physical activity in the 48 h before a performance
trial and to abstain from exercise in the 24 h before a trial. During this
time, dietary standardization was achieved by giving participants
individualized prepackaged meals and snacks (daily intake of 8 g
CHO·kg�1·BM�1, 2 g protein·kg�1·BM�1, and 1 g fat·kg�1·BM�1)
(21) and by instructing them to abstain from caffeine (i.e., coffee, tea,
energy drinks) and alcohol. On the day of a trial, participants were
provided a standardized meal consisting of jelly and 600 ml of fluid
(2 g CHO·kg�1·BM�1) or a visually identical, taste-matched PLC of
negligible energy value.
Protocol. On the morning of a performance trial, participants
reported to the laboratory at 7:00 A.M. after a 10- to 12-h overnight
fast (Fig. 1). A cannula (22G; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted
into the antecubital vein of the left arm and a baseline blood sample
(6 ml) was taken. Following each blood draw, the cannula was flushed
with saline (5 ml NaCl) to keep the vein patent. Participants then
ingested either the CHO or PLC meal and rested for 120 min.
Further blood samples were taken at �100 min, �12 min, and
immediately before (0 min) the performance trial. NA (10
mg·kg�1·BM�1 or 5 mg·kg�1·BM�1) or PLC (200 mg maltodex-
trin) capsules were administered 30 min (10 mg·kg�1·BM�1) and
15 min (5 mg·kg�1·BM�1) prior to the performance trial. Inter-
mittent administration of NA was chosen to minimize the risk of
negative circulatory effects that typically occur with a single bolus
dose (27). Each participant’s BM was recorded before they completed
a 5- to 10-min warm up on the motorized treadmill at a self-selected
pace, which remained the same for each individual for each trial.
Participants commenced the performance trial 120 min following
breakfast. During the performance trial, participants were unable to
see elapsed time or distance, but were informed to run until they could
no longer maintain the prescribed pace.
Blood samples (6 ml), RPE using the scale proposed by Borg in
1973, heart rate (HR) (Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland), and
expired gas were collected at 20-min intervals. Participants were
instructed to inform the principal investigator when they were close to
“fatigue” so that a final expired gas sample could be collected.

 PLC gels and NA or PLC capsules were administered every 25 min
and 30 min, respectively. Participants consumed water ad libitum, and
the total volume consumed throughout each trial was measured. On
completion of a trial, participants filled out a questionnaire comprising
a descriptive 9-point gastrointestinal discomfort scale (“no problem at
all” to “worst it’s ever been”) to rate any distress experienced during
the run (29).
Blood analysis. Blood samples (6 ml) were collected into vacu-
tainers containing EDTA and immediately analyzed for blood lactate
and glucose concentrations using YSI 2300 STAT Plus (Yellow
Springs, OH). Following initial analysis, samples were centrifuged at
1,500 g for 10 min at 4°C, and aliquots of plasma were stored at
�80°C for later FFA and glycerol analysis. Samples were analyzed
for FFA concentration using a nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) assay
kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) and glycerol
concentration using a glycerol assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Rates of whole body substrate oxidation and total energy
expenditure. Rates of whole body CHO and fat oxidation (g/min) were
calculated from each steady-state gas sample collected during the
performance trial using conventional equations (28). The calculations
were made from V
˙ O2 and V
˙ CO2 measurements using the nonprotein
RER equations, which are based on the assumption that V
˙ O2 and V
˙ CO2
accurately reflect tissue O2 consumption and CO2 production: CHO
oxidation (g/min) � 4.585 V
˙ CO2 (liter/min) � 3.226 V
˙ O2 (liter/min);
and fat oxidation (g/min) � 1.695 V
˙ O2 (liter/min) � 1.701 V
˙ CO2
(liter/min).
Rates of fatty acid oxidation (�mol·kg�1·min�1) were determined
by converting the rate of triacylglycerol oxidation (g·kg�1·min�1) to
its molar equivalent, assuming the average molecular mass of human
triacylglycerol to be 855.3 g/mol, and multiplying the molar rate of
triacylglycerol oxidation by 3 because each molecule contains 3 �mol
fatty acid. Rates of CHO oxidation (�mol·kg�1·min�1) were deter-
mined by converting the rate of CHO oxidation (g/min) to its molar
equivalent assuming 6 mol of O2 is consumed and 6 mol of CO2 is
produced for each mol (180 g) oxidized. Total energy expenditure was
estimated for each trial assuming an energy yield of 17.57 kJ and
39.33 kJ for 1 g of CHO and fat, respectively.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS
(version 20 for Windows; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data from the four
trials were analyzed using a linear mixed model (time � treatment).
When a significant main effect was reported, a one-way ANOVA was
used (time or treatment) with Bonferroni post hoc analysis. Statistical
significance was set at P � 0.05. All data are represented as means �
SD. Data for distance run was also analyzed for magnitude-based
effect sizes between conditions using a custom spreadsheet (19). Data
were log-transformed to account for nonuniformity and effect size �
90% confidence interval [effect size (ES) � 90% CI] calculated and
classified as either trivial (�0.2 to 0.2, ES) small (0.2–0.6 ES),
moderate (0.6–1.2 ES), or large (1.2–2.0 ES). Where the 90% CI
overlapped small positive (0.2) and negative (�0.2) values, the effect
was considered to be unclear.
RESULTS
Twelve participants commenced this study but one partici-
pant was unable to complete the FAST trial due to illness, and
another participant did not complete two of the prescribed
performance trials with NA ingestion (CFED-NA and FAST-
NA) because of side effects (i.e., dizziness, abdominal
cramps). The preexercise data for the latter two trials have been
included in analyses.
Running distance covered. There were small but statistically
nonsignificant differences in the distance run such that CFED �
CFED-NA � FAST � FAST-NA (Fig. 2, P � 0.067). ES
statistics revealed a moderate reduction in distance run in
FAST-NA (ES �0.96 � 0.61) compared with CFED, and a small
reduction in FAST compared with CFED (ES �0.54 � 0.65).
The difference in distance run in CFED vs. CFED-NA and FAST
vs. FAST-NA was unclear (ES �0.24 � 0.64 and �0.16 � 0.53,
respectively). No difference was measured for the time to com-
pletion between trials (Table 1; P � 0.053).
Blood metabolites. A significant treatment � time interac-
tion was observed for both plasma FFA (P � 0.001) and
plasma glycerol concentrations (P � 0.01) from rest until after
exercise (Fig. 3). There was no difference in FFA or glycerol
concentrations at rest between treatments. Ingestion of NA
suppressed lipolysis and blunted the typical exercise-induced
increase in FFA concentrations in the CFED-NA and
FAST-NA trials. Following the onset of exercise, FFA con-
centrations remained higher in the FAST trial compared with
the CFED, CFED-NA, and FAST-NA trials until the comple-
tion of exercise (Fig. 3A; P � 0.05). FFA concentrations
increased in the CFED trial between 60 and 80 min of exercise
(P � 0.05), but such an increase was not observed in the
CFED-NA trial. FFA concentrations were lower in the CFED
than the FAST trial after exercise (0.29 � 0.05 vs. 0.50 � 0.21
mmol/liter, respectively, P � 0.001). Following 20 min of

 exercise, glycerol concentrations remained higher in the FAST
trial than the CFED, CFED-NA, and FAST-NA trials until
exercise completion (Fig. 3B, P � 0.05). Increases in glycerol
concentrations during the first 40 min of exercise were similar
in the CFED, CFED-NA, and FAST-NA trials. From 60 min of
exercise, glycerol concentrations continued to elevate in the
CFED trial until after exercise (0.46 � 0.16 to 0.54 � 0.18
mmol/liter, P � 0.05) such that they remained significantly
higher than the CFED-NA trial during this period (P � 0.01).
A significant treatment � time interaction was observed for
blood glucose and lactate concentrations (Fig. 4; P � 0.001).
Glucose concentrations increased above rest following inges-
tion of a CHO meal in the CFED and CFED-NA trials (CFED,
1.80 � 0.39; CFED-NA, 1.67 � 0.50 mmol/liter; P � 0.001;
Fig. 4A). Thereafter, a decrease in glucose concentrations to
levels below those at rest was observed in the CFED and
CFED-NA trials until exercise commenced (P � 0.001). At 20
min of exercise, glucose concentrations were lower in the
CFED and CFED-NA trials compared with the FAST and
FAST-NA trials (P � 0.02). In all four trials, glucose concen-
trations increased until 40 min of exercise and remained
relatively stable thereafter until postexercise.
For all performance trials, lactate concentrations increased
in the first 20 min of exercise above baseline (Fig. 4B): levels
in the FAST trial were lower than those in the CFED, CFED-
NA, and FAST-NA trials (P � 0.02), and levels in the
CFED-NA trial were higher than in the CFED trial (P � 0.02).
From 20 to 80 min of exercise no change was observed in
lactate concentrations in the CFED, FAST, and FAST-NA
trials, although there was a decrease in the CFED-NA trial
(3.24 � 0.68 to 2.54 � 1.24 mmol/liter, P � 0.001). No
difference was observed in postexercise lactate concentrations
between treatments.
CHO and fat oxidation during exercise. Rates of whole body
CHO oxidation were similar in the CFED, CFED-NA, and
FAST-NA trials, but they were lower in the FAST trial com-
pared with the CFED-NA trial (338.48 � 34.71 vs. 297.15 �
45.88 umol·kg�1·min�1, respectively, P � 0.010), such that there
was a main treatment effect (P � 0.007) (Table 2). Rates of fat
oxidation were higher in the FAST trial compared with the
CFED-NA trial (16.78 � 8.74 vs. 8.92 � 6.65 umol·kg�1·min�1,
P � 0.023) and there was a main effect of treatment (P � 0.008).
No difference in fat oxidation was observed in the CFED, CFED-
NA, and FAST-NA trials.
There was a significant effect of treatment for total CHO
oxidized during each trial (P � 0.001) but no difference for
total fat oxidized. Total CHO oxidation was lower in the FAST
trial compared with the CFED and CFED-NA trials (310.22 �
49.95 vs. 358.48 � 46.36 g and 310.22 � 49.95 vs. 371.89 �
27.06 g, P � 0.025 and P � 0.002, respectively). Estimated
total energy expenditure was lower in the FAST trial than the
CFED-NA trial (6,539 � 747 vs. 7,164 � 609 kJ, P � 0.011);
as such, there was a significant effect of treatment (P � 0.010)
on estimated total energy expenditure.
Respiratory parameters and RPE. There was a main
effect of time (P � 0.042) and treatment (P � 0.004) for
RER (Fig. 5). RER was lower in the FAST trial compared
with the CFED-NA trial (0.94 � 0.03 vs. 0.97 � 0.02, P �
0.016), although no difference in RER was observed within
the CFED (0.96 � 0.03) and CFED-NA trials or the FAST
and FAST-NA (0.96 � 0.02) trials.
There was no difference in relative exercise intensity be-
tween the four trials (P � 0.137) (Table 1). There was a main
effect of time for V
˙ O2 and V
˙ CO2, HR, RR, and RPE for all trials
(P � 0.05), but no treatment effect for these variables (Table

with gastrointestinal stress rated as “no problem at all” in
the CFED and FAST trials to “very very minor” in the
CFED-NA and FAST-NA trials.
DISCUSSION
The novel finding of the present study was that the suppres-
sion of lipolysis and exercise-induced increase in plasma FFA
concentrations via NA ingestion did not impair half-marathon
running capacity in competitive male athletes. Indeed, regard-
less of substrate priming by preevent nutrition (a CHO-rich
prerace meal or following an overnight fast), intense exercise
was CHO-dependent, with fat oxidation providing only a small
contribution toward total energy expenditure. This is the first
study to administer NA to well-trained runners to suppress
blood-borne fatty acid availability during high-intensity run-
ning.
A primary goal of the current investigation was to determine
whether blunting the normal exercise-induced rise in plasma
FFA would have a detrimental effect on the performance of an
endurance running event (viz. half-marathon) in competitive
athletes. Although time-to-fatigue protocols measure exercise
capacity rather than performance per se, the protocol imple-
mented in this study was necessary to allow steady-state
measures of whole body rates of substrate oxidation. Our
primary finding of no difference in the running distance cov-
ered between the four trials when running at �80% V
˙ O2 max
(Fig. 2) supports our original hypothesis that fat oxidation
plays only a minor role in endurance events lasting �90 min
when CHO availability is high. We observed a step-wise
reduction in the mean distance covered whereby CFED �
CFED-NA � FAST � FAST-NA, although such differences
failed to reach statistical significance. Indeed, ES statistics
revealed small to moderate reductions in performance when
exercising fasted or fasted with NA compared with when CHO
fed, respectively. The small decrement in distance covered
measured in the overnight fasted trials compared with the CHO
fed trials (6.6%) supports the importance of ingesting CHO in
the hours before and during high-intensity running to increase
CHO availability, turnover, and oxidation rates and ultimately
optimize performance. Indeed, it has long been known that
high-CHO availability can delay the onset of fatigue during
prolonged, intense exercise (10). Although a �7% difference
in the distance covered appears a worthwhile improvement for
an athlete, it is important to note that the magnitude of the
increase in distance covered in the trials in which preexercise
CHO was consumed was well below the 10–15% range, which
has been estimated as a meaningful variation when using a
time-to-volitional fatigue trial of similar exercise duration (20).
The majority of studies that have previously investigated the
NA-induced suppression of fat availability on exercise perfor-
mance have focused on cycling protocols (5, 14, 21, Torrens et
al., unpublished observations). Torrens et al. (unpublished
observations) reported no difference in cycling performance
when participants completed a 90-min cycling time trial (TT)
(�300 W, 82% V
˙ O2 max) following the ingestion of NA in a
CHO-fed state compared with a control trial. Equally, no
differences in cycling performance were observed during a
cycling TT of �30 min (320 W, �80% V
˙ O2max) or a 3.5-mile
cycling TT (�12 min) when NA was ingested in a CHO-fed
state compared with a control trial (16, 25). The findings of
these studies might be considered predictable on the basis of
the nature (short-duration, high-intensity) or mode (cycling)
of exercise, both of which favor high rates of CHO oxidation
(1, 8, 31, 32a). The current study adds to the body of knowl-
edge by confirming the importance of CHO as a substrate for
sporting activities at higher exercise intensities and during
running, where rates of fat oxidation are recognized to be
higher at the same relative intensities than observed during
cycling (1, 8). The half-marathon event was chosen for inves-
tigation because endogenous fat and CHO stores would be
highly available as energy substrates under control conditions
(15), and thus a change in performance and fuel use associated
with a change in substrate availability would indicate the
importance of this fuel source.
The second major finding of the current study was that
participants were reliant on CHO substrates to fuel muscular
work under all experimental conditions, as indicated by the
predominant contribution of CHO to total energy expenditure
(83–91%, Fig. 6). The mean rate of CHO oxidation for all four
conditions was �4 g/min, which amounts to a total of �350 g
of CHO for the exercise task (Table 2). Such a value is well
within the 400–500 g of muscle glycogen stored from the CHO
loading diet (8 g CHO·kg�1·BM�1) consumed by the trained
runners in the 24 h prior to our half-marathon protocol (15).
We note that the absolute rates of CHO oxidation in the present

 study are substantially higher than those reported by Lee et al.
(23) during a half-marathon in which CHO was consumed.
However, the well-trained status and faster running speeds
(�15 km/h vs. 12.2 km/h) of our participants along with the
higher energy demand of exercise explains such differences.
Greater amounts of CHO (�55 g) were oxidized in the trials
involving preexercise CHO intake compared with overnight-
fasted conditions; this is explained by greater CHO availability
and the priming of the hormonal environment to increase rates
of CHO utilization (11). The blunting of FFA availability with
NA led to an equal increase in total CHO oxidation, regardless
of preexercise CHO intake. However, even under conditions
that should favor fat oxidation (overnight fasting, absence of
exogenous CHO intake during exercise), CHO remained the
predominant fuel source (83% total energy expenditure).
It has long been known that ingestion of NA alters fuel
availability and hence muscle substrate selection during exer-
cise (5). A blunting of the typical exercise-induced rise in
FFAs has been demonstrated in previous studies that have
administered NA in cycling protocols (16, 25) and was clearly
demonstrated in the present study, independent of CHO status
(Fig. 3). However, there was an additive effect of preexercise
CHO and NA on fat metabolism during exercise, as evidenced
by the reduction in plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations
after 60 min and 80 min of running, respectively, compared
with preexercise CHO feeding alone. These findings support
the results of Murray et al. (25) who reported higher circulating
plasma FFA during submaximal cycling (�70% V
˙ O2max) when
ingesting CHO compared with coingestion of CHO plus NA.
Although administration of NA in the current study suppressed
adipose tissue lipolysis as evidenced by the reduction in plasma
FFA, total fat oxidation during the running protocol was
estimated to be �21 g, with no difference observed between
trials (Table 2). Because plasma FFA made only a small
contribution to total fat utilized, it is likely that a large propor-
tion of the fat oxidized was from intramuscular triglycerides
(31, 32a). Consequently, the small yet obligatory contribution
of endogenous fat substrates when running at high intensity
irrespective of nutritional status preexercise should not go
unrecognized.
Bergström et al. (5) reported higher respiratory quotient
(RQ) values measured via arteriovenous oxygen difference
across the working leg and thus greater CHO utilization during
submaximal cycling exercise following administration of NA.
The higher RQ was associated with a 33% increase in muscle
glycogen utilization, greater arterial blood lactate concentra-
tions, and a reduction in arterial FFA and glycerol concentra-
tions. The measurement of whole body RER in the present
study makes it difficult to isolate the energy contribution from
individual CHO sources. However, NA ingestion was associ-
ated with a greater increase in blood lactate concentrations at
the onset of exercise regardless of the effect of preexercise
CHO intake on lowering blood glucose concentrations (Fig. 4).
This provides indirect evidence for a greater reliance on en-
dogenous CHO sources (i.e., muscle and liver glycogen) as
previously reported (5).
When investigating the interaction between training status,
exercise intensity, and preexercise nutritional state on substrate
oxidation, Bergman and Brooks (3) reported that substrate
oxidation during graded cycling was largely determined by the
relative intensity of exercise. O’Brien et al. (26) also previ-
ously demonstrated the importance of exercise intensity during
simulated marathon running in “fast” (completion time �2 h
43 min, 73% V
˙ O2 max) and “slow” (completion time �3 h 30
min, 65% V
˙ O2 max) runners. Those researchers reported that
RER values and energy contribution from CHO substrates
were both significantly higher throughout the marathon in the
fast runners (0.99, approximately 85–90% vs. 0.90, approxi-
mately 60–70%), even under conditions in which rates of fat
oxidation would be expected to be maximized (i.e., overnight
fasted, no CHO feeding during exercise). Although a recent
study highlighted the importance of fat oxidation during high-
intensity exercise (18), the results of that investigation should
be interpreted with caution. Hetlelid et al. (18) reported that
RER values during interval-run training (6 � 4-min work bouts
at approximately 90–94% of V
˙ O2max) were reduced in well-
trained runners compared with recreational runners (0.88 vs.
0.95, respectively). However, Hetlelid et al. (18) failed to
demonstrate steady-state conditions during exercise, or to cor-
rect for bicarbonate kinetics, so it is not known whether breath
V
˙ O2 and V
˙ CO2 values accurately reflect tissue oxygen consump-
tion and CO2 production (12). Furthermore, even if the rates of
fat oxidation were valid in that study (18), they would still
contribute only a maximum of 38% of total energy expenditure
in well-trained runners (18), demonstrating CHO rather than
fat dependence. Our results support the original findings of
O’Brien et al. (26), who reported CHO dependency in both
CHO fed and overnight fasted conditions when running a
half-marathon, and further reinforce the fact that when highly
trained athletes compete in endurance events lasting up to 3 h,
CHO-based, not fat-based fuels, are the predominant fuel for
the working muscles, and CHO, not fat availability, becomes
rate limiting for performance (17).
In conclusion, the results of the current study show that
well-trained runners are CHO-dependent when running a half-
marathon at race pace. Furthermore, when CHO availability is
high, blunting the exercise-induced increase in FFA via NA
ingestion did not impair intense exercise capacity in competi-
tive athletes. During exercise of this intensity and duration, fat
oxidation constitutes only a small percentage of overall energy
expenditure independent of preevent CHO status and CHO
availability during exercise. Although there is a small but

dietary strategies that ensure high-CHO availability before and
during competition to maximize rates of CHO oxidation and
