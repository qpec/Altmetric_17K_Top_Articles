Abstract
Background: Cheese is generally rich in saturated fat, which is associated with increased risk for cardio-
vascular diseases. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that cheese may be antiatherogenic.
Objective: The goal of this study was to assess whether intake of two types of Norwegian cheese, with widely
varying fat and calcium content, might influence factors of the metabolic syndrome and serum cholesterol
levels differently.
Design: A total of 153 participants were randomized to one of three groups: Gamalost†, a traditional fat- and
salt-free Norwegian cheese (50 g/day), Gouda-type cheese with 27% fat (80 g/day), and a control group with
a limited cheese intake. Blood samples, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and questionnaires
about lifestyle and diet were obtained at inclusion and end.
Results: At baseline, there were no differences between the groups in relevant baseline characteristics, mean
age 43, 52.3% female. After 8 weeks’ intervention, there were no changes in any of the metabolic syndrome
factors between the intervention groups compared with the control group. There were no increases in total- or
LDL cholesterol in the cheese groups compared with the control. Stratified analysis showed that those in the
Gouda group with metabolic syndrome at baseline had significant reductions in total cholesterol at the end
of the trial compared with control (�0.70 mmol/L, p�0.013), and a significantly higher reduction in mean
triglycerides. In the Gamalost group, those who had high total cholesterol at baseline had a significant
reduction in total cholesterol compared with control (�0.40 mmol/L, p�0.035).
Conclusions: In conclusion, cholesterol levels did not increase after high intake of 27% fat Gouda-type cheese
over 8 weeks’ intervention, and stratified analysis showed that participants with metabolic syndrome had
reduced cholesterol at the end of the trial.

ardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most com-
mon causes of mortality in the world (1), and
lifestyle factors such as dietary changes are
successful in reducing the risk of these diseases. Full fat
dairy products are rarely recommended in these so-called
heart-healthy diets due to the high content of saturated
fat in those products, approximately 17% by weight in
Norwegian Gouda-type cheeses (2), which is assumed to
increase serum cholesterol levels. The Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension, for example, recommends a high
intake of dairy products, with a focus on predominantly
low-fat milk and yoghurt (3). In addition to serum cho-
lesterol, raised serum triglyceride concentrations have
long been associated with an increased risk for CVDs;
however, whether it promotes CVD or is just a biomarker
for risk is still debated (4). Even so, recommendations
are to limit the intake of saturated fats, follow a
Mediterranean style diet, or to reduce or to maintain
serum triglyceride levels below 1.7 mmol/L (4).
On the contrary, observational studies have shown that
cheese intake is associated with lower serum triglycerides
(5, 6). Furthermore, a higher intake of full fat dairy and

 total dairy was associated with a better cardiovascular
health score than a low intake (7). Intervention trials
have also shown that there is some difference within full
fat dairy, as cheese intake was shown to lower LDL
cholesterol compared with butter intake of equal fat
content (8, 9). Cheese and dairy products have also been
associated with reduced prevalence (5) and incidence (6)
of the metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for
diabetes type 2 and CVD. The findings related to dairy
and CVDs are, however, inconsistent and show both a
positive effect of cheese intake in women with decreased
CVD risk (p for trend: 0.03) (10), a negative effect with
a 32% higher risk in CVD mortality for each standard
deviation increase in high-fat dairy products (11), as well
as a favorable cardiovascular risk profile in women, but
not in men (12). The reasons for these inconsistencies
could be numerous, including different study designs, dif-
ferent outcome measures, different intake levels, and
whether they investigate dairy products separately or as
a large group encompassing all dairy intakes. Suggested
mechanisms of action on the effect of dairy and cheese
intake on serum lipids include the effect of bioactive com-
pounds, fatty acids, and micronutrients, specifically cal-
cium (13), as well as inhibition of D9-desaturase activity
through some unidentified cheese components, possibly
related to conjugated linoleic acid (14).
We previously completed a cross-sectional trial to
explore whether Gamalost† intake might influence fac-
tors of the metabolic syndrome. It was found that intake of
Gamalost was negatively associated with systolic blood
pressure (BP) (B��0.7, p�0.03) (15). Since Gamalost is
fat-free, we wanted to investigate experimentally whether
intake of either Gamalost or a Gouda-type cheese would
influence metabolic syndrome factors. Gouda-type cheeses
are the most commonly consumed cheeses in Norway.
Unlike most other types of cheese, Gamalost is a tradi-
tional Norwegian skimmed milk cheese in that it is
naturally free of salt and fat, contains only 160 mg
calcium/100 g cheese, and has high protein content and a
high amount of bioactive peptides. Details on the produc-
tion of Gamalost have been previously described elsewhere
(16). Norvegia†, the Gouda-type cheese included in this
trial, contains 27% fat and 800 mg/100 g calcium, making
it very different from Gamalost. Since results on dairy
intake and factors associated with metabolic syndrome
have been inconsistent, and dairy fat content has been
implicated, we wanted to compare the effects upon meta-
bolic syndrome factors of these two widely differing
cheeses. Possibly, variations in saturated fat, bioactive
peptides, and calcium between the cheeses may give dif-
ferent effects on metabolic syndrome factors.
The aim of this trial was accordingly to investigate
whether intake of Norvegia or Gamalost cheese might
influence factors of the metabolic syndrome, and if they
influenced the factors differently.
Methods
Subjects
Participants in the trial were recruited from the general
population, through local radio, newspapers, and tele-
vision. We specifically tried to recruit persons with
moderately high BP, but normotensive persons were also
included. Men and women over 18 years of age who
fluently read Norwegian were included. Exclusion criteria
were pregnancy and use of BP-lowering medications.
Design
This randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial was
performed with three parallel arms, which is illustrated
in Fig. 1. An 8-week intervention period included mea-
surements taken at baseline and at the end of the trial.
The randomization procedure and envelopes containing
information as to which arm the participants had been
allocated to were prepared by an independent person not
involved in the study. Independent of all baseline mea-
surements, the participants were handed the envelopes by
two independent persons not involved in the study or the
baseline measurements.
This study was carried out at the Department of
Chemistry, Biotechnology and Food Science, Norwegian
University of Life Sciences, A
˚ s, Norway from April
2013 to July 2013 and was approved by the Regional
Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics
(Oslo, Norway) on March 7, 2013 (2013/166) (registered
at www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01913756). The study was
conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects.
Interventions
The participants were randomly assigned to one of three
groups � Norvegia, Gamalost, or control. Participants in
the cheese groups were asked to maintain their habitual
diet, whereas subjects in the control group were asked
to limit their intake of the two intervention cheeses.
The control group was given a list of cheeses they could
consume, consisting mostly of fresh cheeses, blue cheese,
and cream cheese. Norvegia and Gamalost are registered
trademarks of TINE SA, Norway. The participants con-
sumed 50 g/day or 80 g/day of Gamalost or Norvegia,
respectively. These amounts were chosen because they
were judged to be higher than the average intake of each
cheese, but not so high that the participants were unable
to consume the designated amount. Also, to have similar
cheese protein intakes in the two cheese groups, the
Norvegia intervention cheese amount was larger than the
Gamalost intervention. The participants were equipped
with digital kitchen scales to accurately weigh out the daily
intake. The Gamalost cheeses were all made from the same
batch, and they were ripened for 10 days. The Norvegia
cheeses were also from the same batch, and they were

 ripened for approximately 90 days. The participants were
provided with all cheese needed for the duration of the
study and given more as needed. The nutritional values of
the cheeses are presented in Table 1.
Compliance with the cheese intake was judged by
evaluation of charts of weighed daily cheese intake, filled
out by a subset of the study population.
Questionnaire
A questionnaire was developed for a cross-sectional trial
on Gamalost intake and BP that preceded the current
study (15). The questionnaire was a revised version of the
previously validated questionnaires used in the cross-
sectional Oslo Health Study (the main questionnaire and
the second supplementary questionnaire 1 of the Oslo
Health Study were used) (17). The baseline questionnaire
contained questions about lifestyle, health, medication
use, and habitual diet. Some questions focused specifi-
cally on dairy product intake. Total dairy product intake
was calculated by summarizing the frequency of intake
of all cheese, all milk, and fermented milk products. The
exclusion questionnaire focused on diet through the trial,
difficulty with following the diet, and whether the parti-
cipants had experienced any discomfort during the inter-
vention. A version of the baseline questionnaire translated
into English can be found in Supplementary Material 1.
Blood samples
Venous blood samples were drawn in the morning between
06:30 and 10:30 after an overnight fast (approximately
10�12 h), using the Vacutainer† system (Becton Dickinson
Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The samples were cen-
trifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature,
and the serum was separated approximately 1�2 h after the
blood was drawn. The serum was frozen to �208C within
5 h. Fu
¨rst Medical Laboratories (Oslo, Norway) con-
ducted the serum analyses. The measured biochemical
markers were total cholesterol (mmol/L), HDL cholesterol
(mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (mmol/L), and triglycerides
(mmol/L). Fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) was measured
in capillary blood by the finger stick method, using a
LifeScan OneTouch† VerioTMPro (Cilag GmbH Interna-
tional, Schaffhausen, Switzerland).

 Blood pressure
BP was measured using a Microlife† BP A200 sphygmo-
manometer (Microlife, Widnau, Switzerland). BP was mea-
sured after approximately 10 min of rest, in a sitting
position and according to the American Heart Association
guidelines (18). Three consecutive measurements were
taken, and the average of the second and third measure-
ments was recorded. All participants were informed of
their BP and whether or not it was within the normal
range.
Anthropometric measurements
Body weight was measured without shoes or heavy cloth-
ing, to the nearest 0.1 kg using digital scales (TBF-
300A Body Composition Analyzer, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan).
Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a port-
able stadiometer (Seca 217, Seca, Hamburg, Germany).
Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg) divided
by the square of height (m). Waist circumference was
measured using a measuring tape (Seca 201 Circumference
measuring tape, Seca) to the nearest 0.1 cm, according
to World Health Organization recommendations, that is,
at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lowest rib
margin (19).
Metabolic syndrome
To qualify as having metabolic syndrome, a person must
have at least three of the following five criteria: elevated
waist circumference (country-specific cut points,]94 cm
and]80 cm for European men and women, respectively),
elevated triglycerides (]1.7 mmol/L), reduced HDL
cholesterol (B1.0 mmol/L in men andB1.3 mmol/L in
women), raised BP (systolic]130 and/or diastolic]85
mmHg), or elevated fasting blood glucose (]5.6 mmol/L)
(20). Participants were stratified into two groups for
some statistical analyses: MetS-yes if they had metabolic
syndrome at baseline, and MetS-no if they did not meet
the criteria at baseline. They were also stratified for sub-
group analyses by the presence of each individual MetS
factor at baseline and categorized as follows: waist-yes/
waist-no, TAG-yes/TAG-no, GLU-yes/GLU-no, HDL-
yes/HDL-no, SBP-yes/SBP-no, and DBP-yes/DBP-no.
Total and LDL cholesterol are not part of the metabolic
syndrome and were therefore stratified based on choles-
terol guidelines from ‘
Adult Treatment Panel III’ (21).
Hence, LDL-yes/LDL-no with cut-off at 3.4 mmol/L, and
CHOL-yes/CHOL-no with cut-off at 5.2 mmol/L.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY
, USA). Prior to ana-
lyses, the dataset was recoded by an independent person
so that the primary researcher was blinded with regard to
the intervention group. Data were analyzed according to
the intention to treat principle. Baseline characteristics
of the study population are presented as mean (standard
deviation) or as percentages where appropriate. One-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple compar-
isons or the chi-square (x2) test were used to assess differ-
ences between intervention groups at baseline. Paired
samples t-test was used to assess change in metabolic
syndrome factors from inclusion to end of trial in each
intervention group.
The Dunnett test was used to evaluate mean changes
between each treatment group and the control group.
The Dunnett test was also done for the groups stratified
by MetS-yes or no, and by each individual factor of
the syndrome, as well as total and LDL cholesterol.
A p-valueB0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics
At inclusion, 153 participants were randomized to one of
the three groups of the trial (n�50 in Norvegiagroup,
n�53 in Gamalost group, n�50 in control group). Five
participants were lost to follow-up, one in the Norvegia-
group, and two each in the Gamalost and control groups,
as illustrated in Fig. 1. Two participants in the Norvegia
group lacked some of the baseline or follow-up measure-
ments due to failure to fast (n�1) or failure to complete
blood draw (n�1), resulting in an effective sample size of
47 for that group. The baseline characteristics of the whole
study population and the three groups are presented in
Table 2. Approximately, 30% of the population met the
criteria to be diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome.
As can be seen, there were no major differences in dairy
intake or factor of the metabolic syndrome between the
three groups at inclusion. LDL cholesterol was higher in
the control group than the two other groups (p�0.05).
As expected from normal Norwegian consumption pat-
terns, the participants had a higher intake of all Gouda-
type cheeses (approximately six servings per week) than
Gamalost (less than one serving per week).
The questionnaire used in this trial was not detailed
enough to assess changes in energy or macronutrient
intake. However, the questions used to assess food intake
showed no changes in food intake, except increased total
dairy and cheese intake in the Gamalost and Norvegia
groups (data not shown).
All of the individual metabolic syndrome variables were
strongly correlated with the whole syndrome (pB0.001),
and over 90% of participants who met the criteria for
the metabolic syndrome had systolic BP over 130 mmHg,
30% had high triglycerides, whereas just 11% of the
participants met the low HDL cholesterol criteria
(Supplementary Material 2).
Total and LDL cholesterol changes
As shown in Table 3, a paired samples t-test showed
that total cholesterol decreased significantly in the entire

 study population during the intervention, but analyzing
the three groups separately, cholesterol was only signifi-
cantly decreased in the Norvegia group (�0.204 mmol/L,
p�0.017). Table 4 shows that when stratifying by meta-
bolic syndrome diagnosis, total cholesterol was reduced
in MetS-yes participants in the Norvegia group (�0.70
mmol/L, pB0.001). Those participants who had high
total cholesterol at baseline (Table 5) had significant
decreases in total cholesterol in both the Norvegia
(�0.39 mmol/L, p�0.021) and the Gamalost groups
(�0.39 mmol/L, p�0.001). Using the Dunnett test to
compare changes in the intervention groups with the
control group, total cholesterol was only significantly
reduced in the Norvegia group (Table 6): for those
with MetS-yes, cholesterol was lowered by 0.70 mmol/L
(p�0.013). Table 6 shows that in those participants
who had high total cholesterol at baseline, total choles-
terol was decreased in both the Norvegia (�0.39 mmol/
L, p�0.021) and Gamalost groups (�0.40 mmol/L,
p�0.035) compared with control.
LDL cholesterol was reduced in the whole study
population for participants who had high LDL at base-
line (Table 5) (�0.17 mmol/L, p�0.025), but this was
only found in the Gamalost group (�0.32 mmol/L,
p�0.011) when separating the groups. There was no
effect on LDL cholesterol when comparing with the
control group.
Metabolic syndrome changes
There were no overall effects of the cheese interventions
on the metabolic syndrome as a whole (data not shown),
but there were some changes in the individual factors.
When stratifying participants by the presence or absence
of the metabolic syndrome at baseline, the paired samples
t-test and the Dunnett test showed some differences
in whether or not the participants met the metabolic
syndrome criteria. When comparing the change in each
metabolic syndrome variable between the intervention
groups with the control group, there were no differences
between the cheese groups and the control group when
analyzing all the participants in each group (data not
shown), but again, the stratified analyses showed some
changes.
As can be seen from Table 3, paired samples t-test
showed that waist circumference decreased significantly
in the entire study population and in the three groups
separately during the intervention. Weight, and thus
BMI, was slightly reduced from start to end in the
Gamalost and control groups, but, there were no signi-
ficant changes in either weight or BMI between the
groups (data not shown). Table 6 shows that MetS-yes
participants in the Gamalost group borderline signifi-
cantly reduced their waist circumference compared with
the control group (�2.0 cm, p�0.054). Waist circum-
ference was also significantly decreased in the Gamalost

 group for those participants with waist-yes compared
with the control group (�2.0, p�0.037).
As shown in Table 3, there was a slight overall increase
in fasting blood glucose in the whole study population
(p�0.049) which was only borderline significantly present
in the Gamalost group when analyzing the three groups
separately. There was no significant effect on glucose
change when comparing the cheese intervention groups
with the control group (data not shown). As can be
seen from Table 3, paired samples t-test showed that
BP decreased significantly in the entire study population
during the intervention. All three intervention groups
obtained significantly decreased systolic BP during inter-
vention, whereas the Gamalost group was the only group
with significant decrease in diastolic BP. There were no
differences in systolic or diastolic BP when comparing
the cheese groups with the control group at 8 weeks
(Nilsen, 2015, unpublished observations). For participants
who were MetS-no there were some changes in metabolic
syndrome variables, as seen in Supplementary Material 3,
but there were no significant differences between the
cheese groups and the control group.
Serum triglycerides decreased in the Norvegia group
for MetS-yes participants (Table 4) (�0.29 mmol/L,
p�0.039). As shown in Table 6, compared with the
control group those participants who were MetS-yes,
significant reductions in triglycerides (�0.70 mmol/L,
p�0.047) were measured in the Norvegia group. As can
be seen from Table 3, there was a slight significant overall
decrease in HDL cholesterol (p�0.004) in the study
population which was only present in the Gamalost group
when analyzing the three groups separately. However,
this association was lost when comparing the Gamalost
group with the control group (results not shown).
Discussion
The results of this randomized controlled trial suggest a
neutral effect on the metabolic syndrome as well as serum
cholesterol in participants who consumed a moderate to
large amount of the cheeses Norvegia and Gamalost,
compared with a control group. When participants were
stratified, that is, by MetS at baseline and by each factor
of MetS at baseline, the results showed some changes in
cholesterol and triglycerides according to cheese inter-
vention group.
Cholesterol and cheese intake
Total serum cholesterol is not part of the diagnostic
criteria for metabolic syndrome; however, it was included
in this trial due to its possible relationship with CVDs.

 The American Heart Association’s diet and lifestyle re-
commendations to prevent CVD make two recommenda-
tions related to cheese intake: 1) select fat-free, 1% fat,
and low-fat dairy products; and 2) to lower cholesterol,
reduce saturated fat to no more than 5�6% of total
calories, about 13 g on a 2,000 kcal/day diet (22). In this
trial, the participants in the Norvegia group consumed
about 14 g/day of saturated fat just from the cheese, but
at the end of follow-up there were no increases in total or
LDL cholesterol after 8 weeks of increased cheese con-
sumption. Furthermore, those participants in the Norvegia
group who were MetS-yes and those who had high
cholesterol at baseline had reduced their total cholesterol
levels from baseline to the end of the trial, which was also
found to be significant when comparing the Norvegia
group to the control group of low cheese intake. We are
not aware of many similar intervention trials investigating
the effect of different cheeses on cholesterol levels, but
some results are in accordance with ours and indicate that
cheese may not raise cholesterol, as the previously stated
recommendations would suggest. Results from an Iranian
cross-sectional trial showed that those who consumed
cheese more than seven times/week did not have increased
cholesterol compared with those who consumed cheese
less than seven times/week (23). They also found that
lower odds of having metabolic syndrome and low HDL
cholesterol if participants had a high cheese intake. How-
ever, a cross-sectional trial of adolescents in Portugal
found that total cholesterol was significantly higher in
the appropriate cheese intake group compared with the
low cheese intake group (24). Results from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
III show no association between cheese intake and total
cholesterol levels in men or women in the United States,
but higher frequency of cheese intake was associated with
higher HDL cholesterol in women only (12). It is difficult,
however, to compare these trials as they are from different
countries and habitual diets are likely dissimilar between
the three. The three previously mentioned trials were con-
ducted in Iran, Portugal, and the United States, respec-
tively, which are countries with dietary patterns that are
distinct from each other. Annual consumption per capita
figures show that the average cheese intake in Iran is
4.9 kg 2013; in Portugal it is 9.6 kg (2012), while it is
15.4 kg (2013) in the United States (25, 26). In Norway,
the annual consumption was higher than the previously
mentioned countries, with 18.1 kg in 2013 (26), or approxi-
mately 7.5 servings per week as measured in the current
trial.
These contradictory results from cross-sectional studies
indicate the need for intervention trials investigating the
effect of dairy and cheese on cholesterol under differing
habitual diets. Not many intervention trials compare a
high cheese intake with a control group of low cheese
intake, making it difficult to compare our results with
other populations. However, there are some similar trials
which show a comparable effect on cholesterol. Total cho-
lesterol was significantly lower on a cheese diet (150 g/8
MJ daily) compared with a diet of butter and casein (27)
and a high cheese diet (143 g/day) resulted in 5.7% lower
total cholesterol compared with a butter diet (47 g/day)
(8). Tholstrup et al. investigated the effect of 205 g hard
cheese/10 MJ daily compared with butter and milk intake
and found a moderately lower LDL cholesterol after the
cheese intervention compared with butter intervention
(9). They found no significant effect on total cholesterol
which was 0.20 mmol/L higher after the butter interven-
tion compared with cheese intervention (p�0.054). It is
not completely clear why we have these neutral effects or
reductions in cholesterol on a high cheese or high dairy
diet. It has been suggested that the main mechanism of
action is through calcium, which binds to saturated fatty
acids and forms insoluble salts which increase fecal fat
excretion, making less saturated fat available for absorp-
tion (28). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
indicated that increasing calcium intake from dairy by
1,241 mg/day corresponded to an increase of 5.2 g/day
of fecal fat excretion (29). A randomized crossover inter-
vention study of 15 healthy men with a 14-day dietary
intervention of increased calcium from milk (1,143 mg
Ca/10 MJ) or cheese (1,172 mg Ca/10 MJ), or low calcium
control group (362 mg Ca/10 MJ) was carried out in
Copenhagen from 2011 to 2012 (30). Feces and urine were
collected at days 10�14 and 14, respectively, and analyzed
for fat and calcium content. Contrary to our results, total
and LDL cholesterol increased from baseline in all three
groups. However, this effect was attenuated in the cheese
and milk groups compared with control. Fecal fat was
increased in both milk and cheese groups, and this was
correlated with change in both LDL and total cholesterol.
In our trial, the Norvegia group consumed 640 mg/day of
calcium just from the cheese, indicating that increased
calcium intake could be one of the reasons why total
cholesterol did not increase even though the participants
increased their cheese intake. However, the Gamalost
group only consumed 80 mg/day calcium from the cheese,
but still had a reduction in total cholesterol compared
with control in those participants who had high choles-
terol at baseline. This could be a random effect, or it
indicates some other mechanism by which cheese may be
hypocholesterolemic, for example, possibly related to the
presence of bioactive peptides, but further investigations
are necessary to support this hypothesis.
The amount of total cholesterol reduction in MetS-
yes participants in our trial, about 0.7 mmol/L in the
Norvegia compared with control group, may be of clinical
significance. A meta-analysis estimated that each 1 mmol/
L reduction in total cholesterol corresponded to a 17.5%
reduction in relative risk of all-cause mortality (31), hence
a reduction of 0.7 mmol/L could contribute to reductions

 in mortality. Our results show no effect of Norvegia on
LDL or HDL cholesterol separately. In the Gamalost
group, there was a small but significant decrease in HDL
cholesterol compared with baseline in both those who
were MetS-no and those who were HDL-no; however, this
effect was not present when comparing Gamalost to the
control group.
Metabolic syndrome and cheese intake
Hypertension is a very prevalent condition around the
world, and it was estimated that up to 17% of all deaths
are attributed to high BP (32). In this trial, over 90% of
participants with metabolic syndrome had higher than
normal systolic BP, making it the most prevalent criteria
of the syndrome. However, after 8 weeks of intervention,
there were no significant effects of the cheeses on BP
in this trial. Several studies have shown positive effects
of dairy product intake on MetS or single factors of the
MetS. However, there are inconsistencies and variations in
study design and in which dairy products are studied. In
the observational Oslo Health Study, results showed that
the frequency of cheese intake was significantly negatively
associated with serum triglycerides, diastolic BP, and waist
circumference, and positively associated with HDL cho-
lesterol (5). Similarly, a French prospective observational
study found that frequency of cheese intake was negatively
associated with triglyceride levels and also lower increase
in waist circumference over 9 years (6). Another French
prospective observational trial found no effect of cheese
intake on factors of MetS in men or women; however,
when stratifying by baseline BMI, cheese intake was sig-
nificantly positively associated with HDL cholesterol and
negatively with fasting glucose in those who had a
BMIB25 kg/m2 (33). These trials did not differentiate
between different types of cheese, meaning the results
could be associated with any kind of cheese. Only about
one third of the MetS-yes participants in our trial had
high triglycerides, making it one of the least prevalent
abnormalities. It has been known for a long time that
serum triglycerides is associated with CVD risk, indepen-
dent of other risk factors (34), but the effect of dietary
change on triglycerides is less well established. A meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials found that low-
fat diets had no effect on serum triglycerides in women
(35) and neither did low glycemic index diets (36).
There are no good figures for the prevalence of meta-
bolic syndrome in the general healthy Norwegian popu-
lation. The International Diabetes Federation estimates
that about 25% of the world’s population have metabolic
syndrome (37), whereas the prevalence in healthy non-
diabetic Europeans was approximately 15% in 2004 (38).
In the current trial, about one third of the population
met the criteria, indicating that the prevalence has either
increased over the past 10 years, or that our population is
not representative of the general European population.
However, the different metabolic syndrome definitions
used can also influence the prevalence, as the European
trial used a modified WHO definition where hyperinsuli-
nemia had to be present to be diagnosed. Furthermore, we
specifically tried to recruit participants with moderately
high BP, which obviously has an effect on the prevalence of
metabolic syndrome in this study.
The design of the study itself is the main strength of
this trial. The duration of the intervention was quite long
and the population fairly large compared with similar
trials, and the randomization allowed for three groups
of similar characteristics at baseline. The Norvegia inter-
vention cheese is the most commonly consumed cheese in
Norway, making the results relevant to a large part of the
population. A limitation of this trial is the possibility of
the results being influenced by the statistical phenomen-
on known as regression to the mean (39). If the base-
line measurements were falsely high, it is possible that
reductions would occur on subsequent visits, irrespective
of the interventions. However, since the subjects were
randomly allocated to the groups, it can be argued that
the regression to the mean is equal in all groups, and
therefore that the results represent a true change.
In conclusion, even though cheese and high-fat dairy
products are not recommended in heart-healthy diets,
results from this trial do not show a negative effect of
cheese intake on cholesterol or metabolic syndrome. Con-
suming 80 g/day of Norvegia, a 27% fat Gouda-type
cheese, appeared to have a slight hypocholesterolemic
effect in those participants who had metabolic syndrome
and high cholesterol at baseline, compared with the con-
trol group of low cheese intake. Additional studies are
needed to confirm these results, as well as to investigate
the effect of other cheeses.
