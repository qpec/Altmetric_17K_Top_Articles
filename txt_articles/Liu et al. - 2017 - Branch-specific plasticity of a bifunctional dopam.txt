Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of food they consume but also
choose which types of food to ingest. The shifting of food preference driven by nutrient-
specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying
mechanisms. We identified a dopamine circuit that encodes protein-specific hunger in
Drosophila. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation.
Activation of this circuit simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar
consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered
branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained
protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial circuit mechanism by which animals
adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.
B
eyond satisfying caloric needs, animals
must also ingest nutrients that cannot be
biosynthesized. The “specific appetite” hy-
pothesis posits that nutrient-specific hunger
drives homeostatic consumption of sub-
stances such as protein and salt (1–3). Protein is
an indispensable macronutrient (4, 5) and is par-
ticularly requiredinanabolicstates, suchasinfancy
and pregnancy (6, 7). Recent studies in Drosophila
have identified signaling mechanisms regulat-
ing protein hunger, particularly in the context
of postmating effects (8–12). However, specific
circuitsencodingproteinhungerremainunknown.
Yeast is an ethologically relevant protein food
source for Drosophila, containing a negligible
amount of sugars. Studies in fruit flies demon-
strated that mated females have greater drive
for protein and amino acid intake (9, 11, 13) (fig.
S1, A to D). We thus used this potent physiolog-
ical drive for protein in mated females as an
entry point to investigate the neural basis of pro-
tein hunger. We assayed yeast-feeding in mated
females after conditional silencing of different
neuromodulatory cell groups (14). Dopamine (DA)
neurons were specifically required for yeast con-
sumption (fig. S1, E and F) and preference (Fig. 1A
and fig. S1G). To identify the specific DA neurons
mediating this effect, we used two restricted
Gal4drivers(TH-C-Gal4andTH-D-Gal4)containing
regulatory sequences of the tyrosine hydroxylase
gene (TH) and found that conditional silencing
of the neurons labeled with either driver led to
significantly reduced protein preference (Fig. 1A
and fig. S1G). These drivers label largely non-
overlapping DA cells, aside from two cells in
each protocerebral posterior medial 2 (PPM2)
subgroup (15) (fig. S2, A and B).
To isolate these PPM2 neurons, we used an
intersectional approach (TH-C-FLP with TH-D-
Gal4, where FLP encodes flippase) to drive ex-
pression of FRT-stop-FRT-mCD8-GFP (a membrane
tethered green fluorescent protein). We identified
two PPM2 neurons in each hemisphere that pro-
ject ventrally to the “wedge” neuropil (Fig. 1B).
On the basis of this projection pattern, we named
these two PPM2 neurons DA-WED cells. Next,
using the FLP-induced intersectional GAL80/GAL4
repression (FINGR) system [TH-D-Gal4, TH-
C-FLP, tub-FRT-Gal80-FRT (WED1-Gal4)] (16)
(fig. S2D) to express dendritic versus terminal
markers, we found that the wedge area contains
the dendritic field, whereas the two dorsally bi-
furcating branches contain presynaptic terminals
(Fig. 1C). Intersection between TH-C-Gal4 and
another restricted driver TH-F3-Gal4 (15) (WED2-
Gal4) also revealed the two DA-WED neurons (fig.
S2, C and E). We specifically inactivated these cells
with the inward-rectifying potassium channel
Kir2.1 and found substantial inhibition of yeast
preference and consumption (fig. S3, A and B).
General hunger, thirst, and salt appetite were
not affected when DA-WED neurons were silenced
(fig. S3, C to E).
We next asked whether the DA-WED neurons
play a general role in homeostatic regulation of
protein intake, beyond mated females. Although
male flies did not prefer yeast at baseline (fig. S1,
A to D), they exhibited significant protein prefer-
ence and consumption after yeast deprivation for
8 days (9), which was fully suppressed if an amino
acid mix was provided during the deprivation
period (fig. S4, A and B). Inactivating the DA-
WED neurons significantly reduced yeast pref-
erence and consumption in protein-deprived
male flies (Fig. 1, D and E). Conversely, conditional
activation (17) of these cells with the heat-activated
cation channel dTrpA1 induced yeast preference
and consumption in males (Fig. 1, F and G, and
fig. S4, C and D). Similar data were obtained for
virgin females (fig. S4, E to L). Conditional si-
lencing (fig. S5, A and B) or activation (fig. S5, C
and D) of DA-WED neurons reduced or increased
protein consumption, respectively, over a range
of internal protein-hunger states in both mated
female and male flies, so we chose to focus on
male flies for subsequent experiments to avoid
postmating effects. Reducing DA levels in DA-WED
neurons by knocking down the neuronal specific
isoform of TH in these cells (fig. S6, A and B)
decreased yeast intake in protein-starved male
flies (fig. S6C).
To investigate whether the activity of the DA-
WED neurons correlates with protein need, we
first performed perforated patch-clamp record-
ings (18) from these neurons (Fig. 2, A to E). After
yeast deprivation, thespontaneousactionpotential
(AP) firing rate of DA-WED neurons increased
about fourfold compared to controls (Fig. 2, A
and B). Moreover, evoked AP firing rates were
higher at all measured depolarizing currents
after yeast deprivation (Fig. 2, C to E). Protein
starvation did not significantly alter the resting
membrane potential or input resistance of these
cells (fig. S7, A and B). Cytosolic Ca2+ concentra-
tions in these cells (but not in nearby PPM3 DA
neurons) was substantially increased after yeast
deprivation when monitored with the CaLexA
(calcium-dependent nuclear import of LexA)
activity reporter system (19) (Fig. 2, F and G,
and fig. S7, C and D). This increase in intra-
cellular Ca2+ concentration was suppressed when
an amino acid mix was provided in the protein-
deficient diet (Fig. 2, F and G). This effect was
specific for protein, as general starvation did not
affect CaLexA signal in the DA-WED neurons (fig.
S7E). Similar data were obtained with GCaMP
imaging, as an alternative method to measure
cytosolic Ca2+ levels (fig. S7, F and G).
What component of protein serves to signal
protein satiety to the DA-WED neurons? We
hypothesized that a specific amino acid may play
this role. We first subjected flies to protein de-
privation, but provided individual amino acids in
the diet, and then monitored the activity of DA-
WED neurons using CaLexA. Tryptophan and
glutamine (Gln) supplementation suppressed the
enhanced activity of DA-WED neurons induced
by protein deprivation, and proline and glutamate
supplementation showed a trend toward this
effect (fig. S8A). Next, we assessed whether sup-
plementation of these four individual amino
acids modulated homeostatic regulation of yeast
intake. Yeast intake was significantly inhibited
when Gln was added back to a protein-deficient
diet (fig. S8B). Conversely, an amino acid mix
lacking only Gln failed to suppress the increase
in DA-WED activity and was less effective at
inhibiting protein consumption after yeast dep-
rivation (Fig. 2, H and I). We also found that
Gln levels in the hemolymph were significantly
reduced after protein deprivation (fig. S8C). To-
gether, these data suggest that Gln in partic-
ular may be important for signaling protein
deficiency.

 Despite strong preference for sucrose at base-
line, yeast deprivation caused flies to decrease
their consumption of this nutrient (fig. S9A). Be-
cause DA-WED neurons are activated after sub-
stantial protein deprivation, we hypothesized that
they also play a direct role in reducing sucrose
intake under these conditions. Silencing DA-WED
neurons with Kir2.1 significantly enhanced sugar
intake after protein deprivation, whereas activat-
ing these neurons reduced sucrose consumption
(Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S9C).
We next investigated the mechanisms under-
lying the opposing effects of DA-WED neurons
on sucrose and yeast intake. There are four DA
receptors in Drosophila encoded by DopR1, DopR2,
D2R, and DopEcR. Both DopR1 and DopR2 mu-
tants exhibited a reduced preference for yeast after
protein deprivation in a two-choice assay, which
could reflect either a reduced preference for pro-
tein or a greater preference for sucrose (fig. S9B).
Thus, we focused on these two receptors as po-
tential targets acting downstream of the DA-WED
neurons. In one-choice assays, DopR2 mutants
exhibited significantly reduced yeast intake,
whereas DopR1 mutants displayed a robust in-
crease in sucrose feeding (fig. S9, D and E). Mu-
tations in DopR2 and DopR1 also suppressed the
increase in yeast consumption and decrease in
sucrose feeding triggered by activating DA-WED
neurons, respectively (fig. S9, F and G). We con-
firmed these findings by pan-neuronal knockdown
of DopR1 or DopR2 (nsyb-Gal4>UAS-DopR1-miR
or nsyb-Gal4>UAS-DopR2-miR) (fig. S9, H and I),
which yielded similar results (Fig. 3, C and D). We
therefore hypothesized that DopR2 and DopR1 act
in discrete neuronal targets of the DA-WED cells
to regulate protein and sugar feeding, respectively.
To identify putative candidate circuits acting
downstream of the DA-WED cells, we performed
a GRASP (GFP reconstitution across synaptic part-
ners) (20)–based screen with Rubin Gal4 drivers
derived from DopR2 and DopR1 enhancer sequen-
ces to assess connectivity with the DA-WED neu-
rons (figs. S10A and S11A). Among DopR2-derived
driver lines, only the R70G12-Gal4 (fig. S10B) line
exhibited GRASP signal at the DA-WED terminal
branches (specifically, the medial branch) (Fig.
3E). Moreover, knockdown of DopR2 with R70G12-
Gal4 significantly reduced yeast intake after pro-
tein starvation (Fig. 3C), without affecting general
hunger (fig. S12A) or sucrose consumption in
yeast-deprived animals (fig. S12B). This reduc-
tion in protein appetite in R70G12-Gal4>UAS-
DopR2-miR flies was observed over a range of
protein-hunger states in both mated female and
male flies (fig. S12, C and D). To identify the
specific cells in this driver that contact the DA-
WED neurons, we conducted a multicolor flip out
(MCFO) experiment (21). We identified a neuron
whose cell body is located in the posterior me-
dial protocerebrum and sends its projections
first to the fan-shaped body (FB), before extend-
ing more anteriorly to the lateral accessory lobe
(LAL) area where the GRASP signal was observed
(Fig. 3F). We therefore named these neurons FB-
LAL cells based on this projection pattern. We
identified an independent driver R75B10-Gal4
(fig. S13A) that also labeled the FB-LAL neuron
and displayed GRASP signal at the medial branch

 of the DA-WED neurons (fig. S13B). Knockdown
of DopR2with R75B10-Gal4 decreasedyeast intake
in protein-starved flies (Fig. 3C). As expected, in-
tersection between R70G12-Gal4 and R75B10-Gal4
drivers (R70G12-Gal4, R75B10-LexA>LexAop-FLP,
UAS-FRT-stop-FRT-mCD8-GFP) revealed two pairs
of FB-LAL neurons (fig. S13C). Silencing these
cells reduced yeast intake in protein-starved flies,
whereas activating these cells induced elevated
yeast consumption in male flies (fig. S13, D to
F). Activation of DA-WED neurons expressing
ATP (adenosine 5′-triphosphate)–gated P2X2 re-
ceptors (22) induced a substantial increase in
GCaMP signal in the cell bodies of downstream
FB-LAL neurons (fig. S14A).
By contrast, among the DopR1-derived lines,
the R72B03-Gal4 driver (fig. S11B) demonstrated
GRASP signal at the DA-WED lateral branches
(Fig. 3G). Knockdown of DopR1 with the R72B03-
Gal4 driver triggered an increase in sucrose in-
take in protein-deprived flies (Fig. 3D), without
affecting general hunger (fig. S12E) or yeast intake
after protein starvation (fig. S12F). MCFO analysis
using R72B03-Gal4 revealed a small subset of
neurons in the posterior lateral protocerebrum
(PLP) that send their projections locally to the
ventrolateral and superior neuropils, so we named
these cells PLP neurons (Fig. 3H). PLP neurons
were also labeled by another driver line R32A06-
Gal4 (fig. S15A). Similar to R72B03-Gal4, R32A06-
Gal4 exhibited GRASP signal at the lateral branch
of DA-WED neurons (fig. S15B). MCFO analysis
with the new R32A06-Gal4 driver (fig. S15C) re-
vealed cells whose cell body location and pro-
jection pattern match that seen with the PLP
neuron identified in the R72B03-Gal4 driver
(Fig. 3H). Knockdown of DopR1 with R32A06-
Gal4 increased sucrose intake in protein-starved
flies (Fig. 3D). Silencing or activating these PLP
neurons with R72B03-Gal4 or R32A06-Gal4 led
to a reduction or an increase, respectively, of
sucrose intake (fig. S15, D to G).
Following substantial deprivation of an essen-
tial nutrient, animals must engage in persistent
behavior aimed at replenishing it. Plasticity of
relevant neural circuits may underlie the per-
sistent drive for motivated behaviors (18, 23). To
address whether the DA-WED neurons undergo
protein hunger–dependent plastic changes, we
first assessed the morphology of their terminal
branches using mCD8-GFP (24) and a GFP-tagged
version of the synaptic vesicle–associated protein
synaptotagmin (Syt-GFP) (25). The medial, but
not the lateral, branches were significantly elon-
gated following protein deprivation, which was
suppressed when Gln was selectively restored in
the protein-deficient diet (fig. S16A and Fig. 4, A
and B). Similar data were obtained for the num-
ber and total volume of Syt-GFP+ puncta (Fig. 4C
and fig. S16B). To address whether the number
of active zones also changed in the medial
branches of DA-WED neurons after protein star-
vation, we expressed a truncated fragment of the
active-zone marker Bruchpilot (Brp-short) (26) in
these cells. The number of BRP+ puncta in the
medial, but not lateral, branch was significantly

 elevated when flies were protein-deprived, and
this increase showed a trend toward being in-
hibited by Gln in the protein-deficient diet (fig.
S16, C to E). We next used GRASP to determine
whether protein starvation altered the connec-
tivity between the DA-WED cells and their down-
stream targets. GRASP signal between the medial
branch of the DA-WED neurons and the FB-LAL
cells, but not the lateral branch and PLP neurons,
was substantially elevated with protein starva-
tion, and this increase was again suppressed if
Gln was provided in the protein-deficient diet
(fig. S16, F to H).
To characterize the functional consequences
of the plastic changes in the DA-WED neurons,
we performed sharp intracellular current-clamp
recordings of the FB-LAL cells to measure fre-
quency and amplitude of postsynaptic potentials
(PSPs) (Fig. 4, D to F, and fig. S17A). Protein dep-
rivation induced a substantial increase in the
frequency of PSPs in the FB-LAL neurons (Fig.
4E). Moreover, examination of the distribution
of PSP amplitudes revealed the presence of high-
amplitude PSPs solely in yeast-deprived animals
(Fig. 4F). This population of high-amplitude PSPs
likely reflects evoked responses seen only with
protein deprivation and suggests that downstream
signaling is markedly enhanced after protein star-
vation. Knockdown of DopR2 in FB-LAL cells sig-
nificantly reduced the number of high-amplitude
PSPs in yeast-deprived animals (Fig. 4, D to F),
consistent with a model wherein the DA-WED
neurons signal via DopR2 on the FB-LAL cells
to promote protein consumption.
We next examined whether the plastic changes
in the medial branches of the DA-WED cells led
to a change in feeding behavior. We used dTrpA1
to activate the DA-WED cells and assessed yeast
or sucrose consumption at different time points
after cessation of heat treatment. dTrpA1 activa-
tion of the DA-WED neurons resulted in a pro-
longed increase in yeast consumption lasting at
least 6 hours (Fig. 4G) and induced persistent
plastic changes in the medial, but not lateral,
branches as revealed by Syt-GFP staining (Fig.
4I and fig. S17B). In contrast, although sucrose
intake was reduced immediately after dTrpA1
activation, this response did not persist and
was no longer present within 1 hour (Fig. 4H).
After 24 hours, both yeast consumption and
terminal morphology of DA-WED neurons were
indistinguishable from control flies (Fig. 4G and
fig. S17B). Together, these findings demonstrate
branch-specific plastic changes of the DA-WED
neurons in response to substantial protein depri-
vation, providing a mechanism for the persistent
hunger for protein, but not sugar, under these
conditions (Fig. 4J).
Appropriate regulation of food consumption
is essential for the survival of organisms that must
navigate environments with variable and uncertain
food availability and quality. A number of studies
have investigated how animals reject diets devoid
of essential amino acids (27, 28) and how mono-
aminergic and TOR-S6K (target of rapamycin–S6
kinase) signaling in Drosophila regulates mating-
induced protein feeding (8, 9, 11, 12). However,
little is known about the circuit mechanisms
mediating the homeostatic regulation of protein
intake. Our study suggests that protein hunger
is encoded by the DA-WED neurons, providing
a path toward dissecting these mechanisms. Our
findings suggest that glutamine, directly or in-
directly, regulates the activity of these neurons,
thus modulating behavioral responses to protein
deprivation.
Our data suggest that the DA-WED neurons
play a crucial role in homeostatic control of
protein intake, functioning on multiple time
scales to restore protein balance. Shortly after
substantial protein deprivation, the DA-WED

 neurons act to mediate the behavioral switch
between consumption of a food source preferred
at baseline (sucrose) and the deprived nutrient
(protein), by activating a dedicated “protein” feed-
ing circuit, while simultaneously inhibiting a
“sugar” feeding circuit. Over a longer time frame,
the DA-WED cells undergo branch-specific plastic
changes that underlie the selective and persistent
hunger for protein under these conditions. In the
wild, these actions may correspond to promoting
greater selectivity for protein in an initial foraging
response, followed by maintenance of protein
consumption after the protein food source has
been identified.
Given that branch-specific plasticity has gen-
erally been described in postsynaptic dendrites
(29, 30), our finding that the presynaptic ter-
minals of the DA-WED neurons exhibit this phe-
nomenon is highly unusual. The mechanisms
underlying this process are currently unclear
but may depend on extrinsic neuromodulatory
influences that differentially regulate potential for
plasticity of the distinct presynaptic terminals of
the DA-WED cells. Further characterization of
these and related circuit mechanisms should help
delineate the fundamental principles governing
protein-specific hunger. A better understanding of
how animals choose to consume protein may also
have implications for the treatment of obesity.

persistent stimulation of the downstream FB-LAL neurons via DopR2 receptors
to promote prolonged protein intake. Simultaneously, signaling from the lateral
branch to downstream PLP neurons via DopR1 receptors induces a transient
inhibition of sugar intake.T
ogether, these changes result in a behavioral switch
from consuming sugar to persistent intake of protein.
