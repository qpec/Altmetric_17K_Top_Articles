Abstract
Objective—Adults and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) show a blunted neural 
response to rewards. Depression has been validated in children as young as age 3; however, it 
remains unclear whether blunted response to reward is also a core feature of preschool-onset 
depression. If so, this would provide further validation for the continuity of the neural correlates of 
depression across the life span and would identify a potential target for treatment in young 
children.
Method—Fifty-three 4–7-year-old children with depression and 25 psychiatrically healthy 4–7-
year-old children completed a simple guessing task in which points could be won or lost on each

 trial while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Psychiatric diagnosis was established 
using a preschool version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Depression.
Results—Young children with depression showed a reduced differentiation between response to 
gains and losses, and this finding was driven by a blunted response to reward (i.e., the reward 
positivity [RewP]). These findings held even when controlling for co-occurring attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The RewP 
did not vary as a function of depression severity within the group with depression.
Conclusion—Similar to adults and adolescents with depression, preschoolers with depression 
display reductions in responsivity to rewards as indexed by the RewP. These findings provide 
further evidence for continuity in the neural mechanisms associated with depression across the 
lifespan, and point to altered reward sensitivity as an early-emerging potential target for 
intervention in preschool-onset depression.

INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most widespread and costly mental 
illnesses.1 MDD is associated with substantial social burden, as it reduces quality of life and 
function among individuals who suffer from this illness, and is also associated with 
increased rates of suicide and self-harm.2 As such, identifying precursors or early indicators 
associated with the earliest onset of MDD has received growing research attention.3–9 
Preschool-onset depression is now recognized to be associated with alterations in later 
childhood brain development10 and to be a precursor for later childhood and adolescent 
MDD.5, 11 If reliable and effective preventative interventions can be developed and validated 
for this population at an early age, it could minimize both the personal and societal burdens 
of depression and its long-term deleterious effects. To accomplish this goal, it is imperative 
that we advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression in early childhood.
Recent findings suggest that deficits in reward processing—blunted neural and 
psychological responses to obtaining reward—may be a characteristic associated with risk 
for depression that emerges early in life and sustains throughout adolescence and into 
adulthood.12–15 Further, blunted reward responding may be an important predictor of risk for 
the development of depression in adolescence.16–19 As such, blunted reward responding may 
also be an important treatment target for children even earlier in development. Thus, the goal 
of the current study is to examine whether children with preschool-onset depression also 
show altered neural responses to reward, as a key precursor to understanding whether this 
domain of function may be a potential focus of intervention among children with depression 
early in life.

 Two complementary approaches that have helped to delineate alterations in task-related 
neural activation associated with the processing of reward in depression are functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs). The fMRI 
literature has focused on response to reward in a network that includes the dorsal and ventral 
striatum, the orbital frontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate.20, 21 ERP research has focused 
on the Reward Positivity (RewP), which is a frontocentral deflection occurring 250–550ms 
post feedback that indexes responses to positive (e.g., wins) outcomes in a range of tasks 
using reward, such as guessing, and/or gambling.22 Prior literature indicates that the RewP 
correlates with subcortical regions of the brain such as the ventral striatum and the dorsal 
anterior cingulate.23–25
A growing body of literature suggests that adults with depression show altered behavioral 
responses to reward in a variety of domains,15, 26 including reduced impact of reward on 
adaptive behavior27, 28 and less willingness to expend effort for rewards.29–31 Additionally, 
adults with MDD also consistently show a reduction in reward circuit activation in fMRI 
studies of reward processing, especially in the striatum.15,26,32 Further, a number of studies 
show a reduction in RewP amplitude among adults with MDD33,34 and in association with 
higher self-reported depression.35 Similarly, adolescents and school-aged children with 
MDD show behavioral evidence of reduced responsiveness to reward,26,36 including 
evidence for an association between elevated anhedonic symptoms and reduced behavioral 
responses to rewards in 7–10-year-old children.37 Further, both children and adolescents 
with depression also showed altered neural responses to reward, including reduced task-
related activation to reward processing in the striatum13,38 and a blunted RewP 
amplitude.39,40 Importantly, prospective studies have found that a blunted ventral striatal 
response to reward anticipation in previously healthy adolescents predicted increased 
depression two years later.18 Along similar lines, work has also shown that a reduced RewP 
in never-depressed adolescent girls (15–17 years) predicted later MDD and increased 
depressive symptoms, even when controlling for baseline depressive symptoms.16,41
Thus, reduced neural response to rewards has been robustly demonstrated among adults, 
adolescents, and school-aged children with or at risk for depression; moreover, evidence 
suggests that reduced reward responding predicts the emergence or worsening of depression 
over time.
However, little is known about the nature of reward processing in young children (< age 7) 
with symptoms of depression. There are several reasons why it is critical to determine 
whether altered responsivity to reward is also present in even younger children with 
depression. First, it would provide added evidence for the similaritiy of depressive features 
across the lifespan and would be consistent with the hypothesis that some of the same neural 
and behavioral mechanisms are associated with depression whether it emerges very early in 
life, during school age or adolescence, or as an adult. This would provide important 
guidance for studies examining the genetic and environmental mechanisms that may 
contribute to depression across the lifespan. Second, if young children with depression also 
show blunted reward processing, it is possible that these neural markers may guide the 
development of novel intervention and prevention strategies. Because response to reward 
and experiences of positive affect are a highly salient developmental feature of early

 childhood when pleasure in activities and play is a central theme, early childhood may be an 
ideal time to intervene to target and enhance this neural response. Thus, the goal of the 
current study was to determine whether young children with preschool-onset major 
depression (PO-MDD) show evidence of blunted neural responses to reward. It is important 
to note that we used PO-MDD throughout the manuscript but children in the PO-MDD 
group could be up to 7 years old.
Given the very large literature demonstrating the feasibility of using ERPs with preschool-
aged children, the current study used a developmentally appropriate guessing task to 
examine the RewP in response to rewards in young children with preschool-onset 
depression. Based upon the findings from older children and adolescents discussed above, 
we hypothesized that: (1) treatment-naive children with PO-MDD would show significantly 
smaller responses to reward (i.e., RewP) than typically developing same-age peers, and (2) 
among children with PO-MDD, children who are more severely depressed would show 
significantly smaller responses to reward (i.e., RewP).
METHOD
Participants
The current study included a total of N = 84 children between the ages of 4 and 7. Child 
participants with depression were recruited from a larger ongoing randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) study (PCIT-ED [Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development]) for 
PO-MDD. Caregivers and their children were invited to participate in the current ERP study 
during their initial visit for their baseline assessment as part of the parent study. All children 
in the group with depression met developmentally modified DSM criteria for an acute 
episode of MDD at the time of their ERP. Exclusion criteria for both depressed and healthy 
children included current enrollment in psychotherapy, current use of psychiatric medication 
for mood disorders, or diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, as well as neurological 
disorders, head injury, or severe developmental delay. An additional recruitment effort was 
launched to attain typically developing children with no current or prior diagnosis (based on 
parent report) of MDD for use as a healthy comparison group. Children in the healthy 
comparison group were recruited from similar geographical areas and matched as closely as 
possible, at the group level, to the depressed group of children on age, gender, parental 
income, and ethnicity. ERP data was collected from children prior to being randomized to a 
treatment group (i.e., 16-week treatment vs. 16-week waitlist) and prior to the 
commencement of any therapy sessions. All children were recruited from a large 
metropolitan area and its surrounding cities. Table 1 provides demographic data as well as 
diagnostic group differences on key demographic and clinical variables.
Of the total 84 included in the study (n = 27 healthy and n = 57 PO-MDD), n = 6 children (n 
= 2 healthy controls) were excluded because they had <50% usable ERP segments (≤ 30 
usable trials out of 60 total) in the reward and/or loss condition. Thus, the final sample 
included in analyses was n = 53 children with depression and n = 25 healthy control 
participants.

 Behavioral and Diagnostic Measures
Preschool Depression—PO-MDD diagnosis was determined using the Kiddie Schedule 
for Affective Disorders and Depression-Early Childhood Version (K-SADS-EC),42 
administered to the child’s primary caregiver by a research clinician trained to reliability. To 
be diagnosed with PO-MDD, the parent had to report that the child met four or more of the 
DSM criteria for major depression with a 2-week duration in the last month.43 In addition to 
generating a categorical diagnosis for MDD, depression severity scores were created for 
each child by summing the total of 9 possible core DSM symptoms used to assess MDD. For 
the current sample, interviewer intraclass correlation coefficient for MDD severity scores 
averaged .96, 95%CI: .89 – .99 and Kappa for MDD diagnosis averaged .91.
Comorbid Diagnoses—The K-SADS also assess symptoms for a number of other Axis I 
disorders. The three that were most frequently co-occurring in the children with PO-MDD 
were oppositional defiant disorder (ODD: 52%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD: 30%) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD: 20%). Thus, we accounted for the 
presence of these comorbidities in analyses.
Preschoolers’ Behavioral Activation/Inhibition—The Behavioral Activation and 
Inhibition Scales (BIS/BAS) were administered to the primary caregivers of preschool 
participants. Extant literature indicates that the BIS/BAS is a valid and reliable measure of 
children’s appetitive motives (BAS), in which the goal is to move toward something desired, 
as well as aversive motives (BIS), in which the goal is to move away from something 
unpleasant.44 We examined the following subscales, BAS Drive, BAS Reward 
Responsiveness, and BIS, using the recently revised and validated scoring.45
Preschoolers’ Emotion Regulation—The Emotion Regulation Checklist – Preschool 
Version (ERC-PV) was administered to the primary caregivers reporting on preschool 
participants. The measure targets such processes as affective liability, intensity, valence, 
flexibility, and situational appropriateness.46
Maternal Depression—The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 
mothers of preschool participants. The BDI measures severity of depression through self-
report of symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as 
guilt, and physical symptoms such as fatigue.47,48
Task and Materials
Children were asked to complete a guessing game. The guessing game was a modified 
version of the Doors Guessing Task (see Figure 1) used in numerous previous studies of 
older children, adolescents, and adults with depression.33,40,49–51 Although still analogous to 
“gambling” tasks used with older samples, the modified version uses varying level of prizes 
(e.g., poor prize = a single yellow pencil; a great prize = a doll or nerf toys) instead of the 
typical monetary incentives. That is, young children do not have a clear conception of 
money and its relative quantities; however, at very young ages, children reactive positively to 
prizes and gifts. Prior to the task, children were shown 3 boxes of toys: each box had 
increasingly appealing toys (e.g., least appealing box included standard pencils, and the

 most appealing box included toys such as dolls and nerf toys). Children were told that when 
they guessed the correct door, they would see a green up arrow, and if they guessed the 
wrong door, they would see a red arrow pointing down. The experimenter explained that the 
box of toys the children could pick from depended on the total number points they earned by 
guessing doors with either green vs red arrows behind them. Children were told that green 
arrows were worth 10 pts and red arrows were only worth 5 pts and that the more points they 
received the better the box they could choose from. The experiment explained that the 
computer would keep track of the number of green and red arrows and their total number of 
points.
The task was administered on a computer, using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, 
Inc., Albany, California, USA) software to control the presentation and timing of all stimuli. 
Prior to the task, the experimenter first showed children three containers of prizes, each 
increasing in attractiveness to the child and in amount of points required to obtain a prize. 
The experimenter told the children that if they received a certain number of points in the 
subsequent task, they could receive a prize from one of the containers. This exchange was 
designed to encourage the child to engage in the task and to make it relevant to the children. 
During the task, participants were shown a graphic displaying two doors horizontally 
adjacent and were told to select a door to open (the graphic occupied approximately 6” of 
the visual field vertically and 8” horizontally). Participants were instructed to respond using 
a Logitech Gamepad F310 game controller by pressing a specific button on the left of the 
controller to choose the left door, or a specific button on the right of the controller to choose 
the right door. Following each choice, a 1,000 ms fixation cross was presented, and then a 
feedback stimulus appeared on the screen informing the children whether they lost or gained 
points. A green upward arrow indicated a correct guess, and a red downward arrow indicated 
an incorrect guess. All cues and feedback were presented against a black background and 
occupied approximately 3” of the visual field vertically and 1” horizontally. A fixation mark 
(+) was presented prior to the onset of each stimulus.
The order and timing of all stimuli were as follows: (i) the text “Click for the next round” 
was presented until the participant presses a button, (ii) a fixation mark was presented for 
1000 ms, (iii) the graphic of two doors was presented until a choice was made (iv), a fixation 
mark was presented for 1000 ms, (v) a feedback arrow was presented for 2000 ms, and 
finally (vi) a fixation mark was presented for 1500 ms. The timing of the task can be found 
in Figure 1. Participants received negative feedback on exactly 50% of the trials, and 
positive feedback on exactly 50% of the trials.
Procedure
Following a brief description of the experiment, electroencephalography (EEG) sensors were 
attached while participants watched a movie of their choice. To familiarize children with the 
procedure and to increase ther interest in participating in the task, they were given a practice 
block containing four trials. The actual experiment involved 60 trials (3 blocks of 20) that 
were presented in random order.

 Psychophysiological Recording and Data Reduction
The EEG was recorded using a BrainVision ActiCHamp recording system and actiCAP 
active electrodes (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). The electrodes were mounted 
in an elastic cap using a subset of the International 10/20 System sites (FP1, F3, F7, FC1, 
FC5, FT9, C3, T7, CP1, CP5, TP9, P3, P7, O1, Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, FP2, F4, F8, FC2, FC6, 
FT10, C4, T8, CP2, CP6, P4, P8, TP10, O2). A ground electrode was located at FPz. The 
EEG data were recorded and referenced to Cz. The horizontal electrooculogram (EOG) was 
recorded as the voltage between electrodes placed lateral to the external canthi and was used 
to measure horizontal eye movements. The vertical EOG was recorded from electrodes 
placed above and below the left eye and was used to detect blinks and vertical eye 
movements. An electrode on the forehead served as the ground for the EOG signals. The 
EEG and EOG were digitized at 500 Hz with 24 bits of resolution.
Offline analysis was performed using Brain Vision Analyzer software (Brain Products 
GmbH, Munich, Germany). EEG data were re-referenced offline to the average of TP9 and 
TP10 (located adjacent to the mastoids) and band-pass filtered with cutoffs at .1 and 30 Hz. 
The EEG was segmented for each trial, beginning 200 ms before feedback onset and 
continuing for 1000 ms. The EEG for each trial was corrected for blinks and eye movements 
using the method developed by Gratton et al.52 Specific intervals for individual channels 
were rejected in each trial using a semi-automated procedure, with physiological artifacts 
identified by the following criteria: a voltage step of more than 50.0 µV between sample 
points, a voltage difference of 300.0 µV within a trial, and a maximum voltage difference of 
less than .50 µV within 100 ms intervals. At the initial start of the doors task the mean 
impendence level for the entire sample at cite PZ was 6.80 kΩ with SD = 6.05 kΩ and a 
maximal impendence value = 30 kΩ and a mode of 2.00 kΩ.
Data Analysis
Stimulus-locked ERPs were averaged separately for each type of feedback (reward or loss) 
and the activity in the 200 ms window prior to stimulus onset served as the baseline. Based 
on visual inspection of the overall grand average ERP, we measured the mean amplitude 
between 250 ms to 550 ms at electrode site Pz separately for reward and loss trials. We 
defined the RewP as the difference between the mean amplitude on gain minus loss trials. 
Our primary analysis was a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the 
two groups across the two conditions (reward and loss). We also conducted a univariate 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine whether the hypothesized effect of PO-MDD 
on RewP was significant when covarying for children’s concurrent diagnosis of ODD, 
ADHD, and GAD. To further understand the source of any significant group difference in 
RewP, we used regression to create two residual scores.53–55 The first was the residuals from 
a regression using the mean amplitude of the loss condition to predict the mean amplitude of 
the reward condition. This residual score reflected variation in the reward responses not 
predicted by the loss response. The second was the residuals from a regression using the 
mean amplitude of the reward condition to predict the mean amplitude of the loss condition. 
This residual reflected variation in loss responses not associated for by reward responses.

 We then used Pearson’s product moment correlations to examine the relations between 
children’s depression severity, as well as their manifestations of anhedonia as reported by 
caregivers, BIS-BAS scores and the RewP (reward minus loss) and the reward residual 
score. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (24.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
Illinois, USA).
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes demographic and clinical information for the groups. Results from t-
tests indicated no significant diagnostic group differences in relation to children’s age or 
parental income. Further, Chi-Square results showed that diagnostic groups did not differ in 
relation to gender, age, or ethnicity. As expected, results indicated that diagnostic groups 
differed on depression severity measured by the KSADS. Maternal depression, as measured 
by the BDI, also differed significantly between depressed and healthy preschool groups.
Differences in Neural Response to Reward (RewP) Between Young Children With 
Depression and Healthy Young Peers
A repeated measured ANOVA was conducted to test for diagnostic group differences 
between the reward and loss condition mean amplitudes. Results indicated that the main 
effect of condition (reward vs. loss) approached statistical significance, F(1,76) = 2.95 p = .
09. More importantly, the results indicated a significant condition by diagnostic group 
interaction effect, F(1,76) = 7.39, p = .008, Willks Lambda = .91 (see Figures 2 and 3). 
Specifically, children in the PO-MDD group (M = 4.03, SD = 7.11) had a smaller response 
to reward trials compared to healthy children (M = 8.53, SD = 6.16), t(76) = 2.72, p = .008, 
but the PO-MDD (M = 4.52, SD = 7.00) and healthy children (M = 6.34, SD = 7.43) did not 
differ in response to loss trials, t(76) = 1.05, p = 30 (see Table 2 for descriptive ERP values). 
Within-group analyses indicated that there was a significant effect of condition within 
healthy control children, F(1,24) = 7.96 p = .009, but not within the PO-MDD group, 
F(1,52) = .75 p = .39.
To further understand the source of the group differences in RewP, we examined the 
diagnostic group differences in the residualized reward and loss scores. As shown in Figure 
4, the children with MDD showed a significant reduction compared to the healthy controls in 
the residualized reward scores, t(76) = 3.16, p = .002, but did not differ significantly in the 
residualized loss scores, t(76) = −1.70), p = .09.
RewP Amplitudes in Young Children With Depression When Covarying for GAD, ODD, and 
ADHD
We used a repeated measures ANCOVA to test for the effect of PO-MDD on response to 
reward and loss when covarying for children’s concurrent diagnosis of GAD, ODD, and/or 
ADHD. Results indicated that children in the PO-MDD group still showed a group × 
condition interaction with a significantly smaller RewP when covarying for concurrent 
GAD, ODD, and ADHD, F(1,73) = 7.37, p = .008. Again, when conducting separate follow-
up analyses using reward and loss residual scores, the groups did not differ on loss response, 
Belden et al.

 F(1,73) = 4.02, p = .05. However, children in the PO-MDD group showed a significantly 
smaller response to reward compared to controls when covarying for co-morbid GAD, ODD, 
and ADHD, F(1,73) = 8.79, p = .004.
Individual Differences in RewP and MDD Severity, BIS-BAS, Emotion Regulation, and 
Maternal Depression
Results from bivariate correlations indicated that in the total sample of children, greater 
depression severity was associated with significantly reduced neural response to reward, r = 
−.20, p = .04. However, follow-up within-group analyses indicated no significant association 
between depression severity and neural response to win trials within the healthy (r = −.24, p 
= .13) or depressed groups (r = −.06, p = .32). An additional series of bivariate correlations 
was performed within the children with depression to relate the RewP to the BIS/BAS 
scores, emotion regulation, and maternal depression. There were no significant correlations 
between children with depression’s RewP amplitudes and their BIS/BAS scores, their 
emotion regulation scores, or maternal depression (all rs < |.17|, all ps > .12). We also 
examined correlational analyses using children residualized reward scores. Again results 
indicated no significant associations with any of the individual difference variables (all rs < |.
18|, all ps > .10).
DISCUSSION
We found that preschool-aged children with depression showed a reduced RewP in an age-
appropriate reward task compared to healthy control children. This group difference was 
driven by a blunted response to reward in depressed compared to healthy preschoolers. 
However, there were no significant relationships between individual differences in RewP 
within the healthy or depressed group in relation to emotion functioning or depression 
severity. These findings provide evidence for similar reward-related neural dysfunction in 
depression as early as age 4, and add further evidence for the importance of reward 
processing in understanding the pathophysiology of depression across the lifespan and 
beginning early in childhood.
The reduction in RewP in young children with depression is consistent with findings from 
adolescent and adult samples, showing reductions in RewP are associated with current 
depression,33,34,39,40 and predict later emergence/worsening of depression.16,41 Further, we 
found that the reduction in RewP among preschool-aged children with depression held even 
when controlling for comorbid ADHD, ODD, and GAD diagnoses, suggesting that the 
group differences in RewP were not accounted for by these comorbid diagnoses and were 
specific to depression. Within-group findings also demonstrated that in healthy children, 
brain activity related to reward feedback was significantly greater than activity elicited by 
negative feedback. In contrast, but consistent with expecations, brain activity elecited by 
reward and loss feedback did not differ in magnitude in the group of young children with 
depression. These findings contribute to the growing literature suggesting that both 
behavioral and neural alterations in response to rewards are a consistent characteristic of 
depression at varying developmental periods15,26 that may also serve as a risk factor for 
future episodes.19

 At one level, our results are consistent with the idea that anhedonia (reduced response to 
pleasure) is a core feature of MDD, which should be related to reduced neural responses to 
reward. However, in the current study, we did not find a relationship between individual 
differences in neural responses to gains and depression severity (including anhedonia 
symptoms in particular), BIS-BAS responses, or emotion regulation within our sample of 
preschoolers with depression. On average, our sample of children with PO-MDD had a high 
level of depression severity and anhedonia (i.e., approximately 85% of the children with 
depression exhibited anhendonia) without a great deal of variance. Thus, there may not have 
been sufficient variation in the current sample to detect these effects. Additionally, because 
of the age of the children, we needed to primarily rely on parent reports of anhedonia, which 
may not fully capture this trait in preschool children. Future studies could address this issue 
by including an observational measure of anhedonic symptoms in children to supplement 
parent report.
Interestingly, we did not find any evidence for increased response to loss in preschoolers 
with MDD as compared to healthy controls. There is some evidence in the literature that 
elevated negative mood associated with depression relates to increased behavioral measures 
of loss avoidance in children (7–10 years) at high risk for depression37 as well as stronger 
responses to loss in the striatum among high-risk children; however, these studies were 
conducted with an older sample.19 Other studies in the literature that have found evidence 
for increased loss responses associated with depression or risk for depression have also 
worked with older children or adults.56–59 Thus, it is possible that an enhanced response to 
loss emerges later in the course of development in children with depression or at risk for 
depression.12 It is also possible that the absence of increased brain activity in relation to loss 
feedback was due to differences in the task used across studies. For example, in an fMRI 
study examining reward processing in relation to depressive symptomatology in at-risk 
children ages 7 to 10, authors found blunted response to reward was associated with greater 
risk for MDD, but they also found the stronger deactivation to loss was an even stronger 
predictor of risk group.19 It may be that young children in the current sample did not react to 
loss as one might expect because they knew that the negative feedback was related to poorer 
prize choices but would not result in losing a prize all together. It is also possible that 
negative feedback is simply less salient to younger children as this is a developmental period 
in which gratification and reward seeking are especially strong motivators. A study with a 
wider range of ages that spans from preschool through adolescence will be needed to test 
this hypothesis.
This study had a number of limitations that are important to consider. As noted above, our 
measures of individual differences in depression, approach and avoidance motivation, and 
emotion regulation were based on parent report rather than direct child observation. It is 
possible that there was bias in this reporting and/or a greater difficulty in reporting more 
nuanced internalizing symptoms of depression such as experiences of pleasure or loss. An 
additional limitation and direction for future research would be the inclusion of a third 
comparison group that included preschoolers who are symptomatic with a form of 
psychopathology other than depression (i.e., anxiety, disruptive disorder). Further, although 
the use of ERP to measure RewP is becoming increasingly common and has many 
advantages, this method also has limitations. ERPs have excellent temporal resolution for

 measuring real-time neural responses, are straightforward to use in young populations, and 
provide an important measure of reward response that is not dependent on self-report. 
However, ERPs do not provide the same spatial resolution as measures such as fMRI, and 
thus we cannot localize our finding to specific brain regions (e.g., ventral striatum). 
Nonetheless, prior studies integrating ERP and fMRI have suggested that the RewP signal 
correlates with fMRI responses to reward in the striatum and the dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex.23–25 Finally, our rewards scenario was an abstracted situation that was experienced in 
a laboratory setting, and thus may not fully generalize to real-life situations in which 
children might encounter rewarding or disappointing feedback.
In summary, this is the first study to our knowledge to show that preschoolers with 
depression showed reduced ERP response to rewards and lack of differentiation between 
rewards and losses (reduced RewP) as compared to healthy controls. This is the youngest 
sample in which the RewP has been examined in relation to individual differences, and adds 
to the literature on the value of using ERP measures to understand neural function in young 
children and in relation to psychopathology. These findings provide important evidence for 
diminished response to rewarding outcomes as a potentially key mechanism associated with 
depression across the lifespan by demonstrating its atypical neural actiation in the youngest 
sample with depression studied to date.
Study findings underscore the importance of clinical attention to alterations in reward 
response as a core area of emotional impairment in early childhood depression. These 
findings of continuity in reward response deficits in depression as early as the preschool 
period suggest that interventions targeting behavioral and/or neural mechanisms of reward 
processing may be an important avenue for early interventions in depression. Study findings 
point to the potential utility of focusing on upregulation of responses to rewards as a 
potential pathway for intervention in already depressed young children, or as a means to 
prevent the occurrence of depression in individuals at risk for this often debilitating illness.
