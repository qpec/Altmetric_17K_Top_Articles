Objective: The study estimated costs and effects associated
with increasing access to publicly funded psychological ser-
vices for depression in a public health care system.
Methods: Discrete event simulation modeled clinical events
(relapse, recovery, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and sui-
cide), health service use, and cost outcomes over 40 years in a
population with incident depression. Parameters included ep-
idemiologic and economic data from the literature and data
from a secondary analysis of the 2012 Canadian Community
Health Survey on mental health. Societal costs were measured
with the human capital approach. Analyses estimated the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with im-
proved access to psychological services among individuals
not receiving adequate mental health care and reporting an
unmet need for such care compared with present use of
health services for mental health reasons.
Results: Over 40 years, increased access to mental health
services in a simulated population of adults with incident
depression would lead to significantly lower lifetime
prevalence of hospitalizations (27.9% versus 30.2% base
case) and suicide attempts (14.1% versus 14.6%); fewer
suicides (184 versus 250); a per-person gain of .17 quality-
adjusted life years; and average societal cost savings of
$2,590 CAD per person (range $1,266–$6,320). Pub-
licly funding psychological services would translate
to additional costs of $123,212,872 CAD ($67,709,860–
$190,922,732) over 40 years. Savings to society would
reach, on average, $246,997,940 CAD ($120,733,356–
$602,713,120).
Conclusions: In Canada, every $1 invested in covering psy-
chological services would yield $2.00 ($1.78 to $3.15) in
savings to society. Covering psychological services as part
of Medicare for individuals with an unmet need for mental
health care would pay for itself.

In North America, up to 20% of the population report having
a common mental disorder, such as depression, in the course
of their lifetime (1). Depression has been associated with
decreased functional status and low perceived quality of life
(2–4), mortality (5,6) and suicide rates that are four times
higher than in the general population (2), and increased
health system costs (7–9).
Although cost-effective psychological treatments for de-
pression exist (10–12), data from the Canadian Community
Health Survey (CCHS), conducted in 2012, showed that 39%
of adults with major depression reported an unmet need for
mental health care, with 71% reporting a need for counseling
(13). A recent report by Quebec’s health commissioner on the
performance of the health system clearly highlighted inequity
in access to effective mental health services, such as psycho-
therapy (14). Although most patients prefer psychotherapy
over antidepressants for depression (15), socioeconomic bar-
riers prevent use of specialty providers of psychotherapy, such
as psychologists, in primary care (16). The cost of psychological
services is the primary concern (17).
In Canada, the family physician is the most frequently
consulted professional for mental health reasons (18). Al-
though most physicians are aware of evidence-based psycho-
logical interventions, they have reported not being comfortable
in providing such interventions because of time constraints or
inadequate training or because they preferred not to (19). The
physicians cited cost as the largest barrier to referring patients
to psychologists, because services are not covered by public
health insurance.
Governments are currently struggling to decide whether
to reimburse access to psychological services. To date, the
United Kingdom and Australia have decided to reimburse
psychological therapies in their health systems. In the United
Kingdom, Layard and colleagues’ (20,21) cost-benefit analysis
of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)
program showed that the program would pay for itself within

 five years. In France, a similar study estimated a cost-benefit
ratio ranging between 1.14 and 1.95 (22).
In the United Kingdom, the economic modeling exercise
(20) was helpful in the decision-making process involved in
creating the IAPT program. Currently, Canada is examining
how best to use the federal transfer funds for health in
2017 (23), and in the province of Quebec, the health technol-
ogy assessment agency is working on a report on equitable
access to psychological services. Therefore, the objective of
this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness associated
with rendering psychological services as part of Canadian
Medicare for individuals with unmet mental health needs.
This study provides important health system policy information
for decision makers on how best to allocate resources for a
more efficient public managed health care system.
METHODS
Study Cohort
Using discrete event simulation (DES), we modeled the
evolution of depression among patients over a 40-year pe-
riod to assess the cost-effectiveness of increasing publicly
funded access to psychotherapy in Canada, compared with
the status quo. We included in the model incident cases of de-
pression (2.9% of the population) among persons ages 20 to 85
and estimated patterns of past-year health service use for mental
health reasons from the 2012 CCHS–Mental Health (24).
Model Overview
DES modeling with the ARENA–Rockwell software pro-
gram was used to depict the disease progression of de-
pression (25). As shown in studies by Le Lay and colleagues
(26) and by Vataire and colleagues (27), this method is
flexible and allows for an accurate depiction of the evolution
of depression, a disease that is characterized by multiple
episodes, with prognosis depending on disease history. The
main advantage of DES is its flexibility in allowing individuals
with different attributes to move from one event to another in
sequential order while the model simultaneously takes into
account important risk factors, such as age, disease history,
and time to event (26). In DES, the model considers time-
dependent events that trigger disease evolution and changes in
health states (26,28). [More information about use of DES in
this study is provided in an online supplement to this article.]
Model Parameters
We designed the model to predict the health outcomes and
costs associated with different pathways of care received
after an incident episode of depression. We modeled out-
comes on the basis of type of health service recieved and the
health events with which it was associated (Figure 1). The
probability of events and model parameters were based on
secondary analyses of data captured in the 2012 CCHS
mental health survey carried out by Statistics Canada (24)
(Table 1), as well as on epidemiologic, pharmacologic, cost
(direct and indirect), and utility estimates, for the calculation
of quality-adjusted life years, from the literature. [Tables in
the online supplement present parameter estimates from
the published literature.] The CCHS mental health data
provided population estimates of major depression and
prevalence of health service use for mental health reasons
by community-dwelling adults ages 15 and older who were
living in the ten provinces, representing 28.3 million Ca-
nadians. We also determined the past-year and lifetime
prevalence estimates of major depression, hospitalizations,
and suicide attempts.
Among respondents with past-year major depression (4.6%
of the Canadian population), we assessed past-year health
service use for mental health reasons (yes or no), by type of
provider consulted and number of visits and antidepressant
use. The following categories were studied: general prac-
titioner or family physician (GP/FP) only, psychiatrist only,
GP/FP and psychiatrist, other mental health specialist only
(psychologist, psychotherapist or counselor, social worker,
and nurse), GP/FP and other mental health specialist, psy-
chiatrist and other mental health specialist, and GP/FP and
psychiatrist and other mental health specialist. Average
fees for each type of service were ascertained from national
(29) and provincial billing manuals (30,31). The prevalence
and annual costs of antidepressant use were also based on
previous estimates (32).
Respondents who had used services in the past year were
further categorized according to the CCHS data as receiving
adequate mental health services (yes or no). Adequate mental
health services were defined according to Canadian rec-
ommendations for the treatment of depression (12) as either
12 or more psychotherapy consultations with a psychiatrist, a
GP/FP (at least 25 minutes), or another mental health spe-
cialist or use of an antidepressant with four visits to a GP/FP
or a psychiatrist.
The Canadian population status quo (base-case scenario)
was defined according to the results obtained from analyses
of the CCHS data (Table 1). Briefly, among individuals who
reported a major depressive episode, 64.3% had used services
for mental health reasons, whereas 36.7% had not. Among
these service users, 67.4% had received adequate care as de-
fined above. Data on patterns of use of various provider types
are presented in Table 1.
The alternative scenario of increased access to care was
also based on analyses of 2012 CCHS data on unmet mental
health needs, which showed that 17.0% and 12.7% of re-
spondents with major depression reported a partially met
or an unmet mental health need, respectively. Seventy-one
percent of needs were for counseling (13), and in the
increased-access scenario, this would result in 9% (12.7% 3
71%) of past-year nonusers becoming users and 12.1%
(17% 3 71%) of past-year users who had not received ad-
equate care receiving such care. Following the Australian
GP gatekeeper model of psychological services (33), all
these users were assigned to the GP/FP user group and to the
group that used other mental health specialists. The pop-
ulation prevalence rates of health service use by provider

 categories in this alternative scenario are presented in
Table 1. [Information about how estimates were drawn and
the data sources used is included in the online supplement
(15,23,24,27,32,34–64).]
Economic Analyses
Costs were assessed from a health system perspective and
from a societal perspective; the latter included costs associated
with productivity losses. Costs were then incorporated into an
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, which compared
the status quo with coverage of psychotherapy as part of pub-
licly funded psychological therapy services for incident cases of
depression in which individuals had not received adequate care.
The improved-access scenario was based on results of the
Better Access initiative in Australia (33) and the IAPT pro-
gram in the United Kingdom (65,66), in which GP/FPs or
psychiatrists follow and refer individuals to receive publicly
funded psychological services. In those programs, adequate
care was considered to consist, on average, of two visits
with a GP/FP and eight sessions with a mental health pro-
fessional; sensitivity analyses considered a lower estimate
of two GP/FP visits and four sessions with a mental health
professional and a higher estimate of four GP/FP visits
and 12 sessions with a mental health professional. Medical,
nonmedical, and productivity costs were tracked. Utility
values for the depression and suicide-related health states
(attempted suicide and suicide) were used to calculate quality-
adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were also carried
out to test the robustness of the results to changes in assumed
data values with possible ranges of the cost data (lower and
upper limits) and less conservative utility estimates.
Finally, to more accurately represent a dynamic adult
population of incident and prevalent cases of depression, the
ARENA program was run for a total of 105 years after which
the last 40-year period, representing a steady-state picture
of a population with depression, was retained in the cost-
effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS
The results of the 40-year model of the base-case scenario and
the alternative scenario, in which there was increased access to
psychological services, are presented in Table 2. A preliminary
validation of the base-case scenario showed that the lifetime
prevalence of suicide attempts and hospitalizations for mental
health reasons among respondents with depression reached
14.6% and 30.2%, respectively. These results are similar to those
from analyses of mental health data from the 2012 CCHS,

 which found that lifetime rates of attempted suicides and
hospitalizations among respondents with major depression
in the past year reached 14.1% and 29.9%, respectively.
In addition, in the base-case model, there were 250 suicides
over the 40-year period, which translates into 9.1 suicides
per 100,000 population per year. Earlier published results
indicated that the percent-
age of suicides attributable to
the population of individuals
with mental or substance use
disorders reached 74% (67).
The suicide rate in the Cana-
dian population for persons
ages 20 to 85 was close to 12.1
per 100,000 in 2011 (68); it
can be estimated that 8.9
suicides per 100,000 are at-
tributable to affective disor-
ders, such as depression, a
rate similar to the rate that
we observed in the model.
In the increased-access sce-
nario, a significant decrease
was noted in the number of
days suicidal and depressed,
with an increase in the num-
ber of days in a well or healthy
state (Table 2). This translated
into an average benefit of .17
quality-adjustedlifeyearsgained
per person. The increased-
access model also showed a
decrease in health system
and societal costs. The results
indicated that by increasing
access to psychotherapy, the
alternative scenario domi-
nated the status quo in that it
was more effective and less
costly (Table 3). The sensitiv-
ity analyses showed that the
most important influence on
the results was the use of the
friction cost method and the
human capital approach in
assessing loss of productivity.
DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS
This 40-year, prospective-
value implementation study
showed that rendering psy-
chological services as a pub-
licly funded treatment in
Canada for adults with de-
pression reporting an unmet mental health need leads to
improved health-related quality of life and cost savings to the
health system and society. Respondents with a reported un-
met mental health need, mainly for counseling, who have not
received adequate mental health care for their depression
represent 8.1% of prevalent cases of depression in Canada.

INSURING PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES AS PART OF MEDICARE FOR DEPRESSION IN CANADA
 Increasing access and render-
ing publicly funded psycho-
logical services for this adult
population would translate in-
to additional costs, on average,
of $123,212,872 CAD ($1,292
[two GP/FP visits plus eight
psychotherapy sessions in a
year] per individual multi-
plied by 95,366 individuals
with unmet needs) (range
$67,709,860–$190,922,732).
The savings to society, cal-
culated by using the human
capital approach, would reach,
on average, $246,997,940
CAD (range $120,733,356–
$602,713,120).
These estimates need to
be interpreted in light of the
study’s limitations. First, the unit cost analyses were based
on national data and the costs are for the province of Quebec,
which may limit generalizability to other countries with
public health care systems similar to Canada’s (69). Second,
the results presented assume that eight psychotherapy ses-
sions and two physician visits would, on average, be covered
in the scenario of increased access to psychotherapy (20).
Previous publications in Australia have reported that most
people use six sessions, with improved outcomes on the ten-
item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and the 21-item
Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (33). Third, not all in-
dividuals with a need for mental health care would avail
themselves of the services (20), and thus the average costs
associated with increased access may be an overestimate.
Inversely, one may argue that individuals without a signifi-
cant need for mental health care may receive treatment
because of the greater availability of services. Canadian
population data indicate that 8.1% of those who do not meet
criteria for a mental or substance use disorder report a need
for mental health counseling and may want to access such care
(13). A previous study showed that individuals who did not
report a common mental or substance use disorder had con-
sulted a psychologist in the previous year, with a median of
four visits (16). How this would affect the estimates of cost and
quality-adjusted life years is difficult to predict. However, in
this subgroup of individuals without a clinical diagnosis
who express a need for counseling, consulting a mental
health professional may be associated with a decrease in
psychological distress, which may be accompanied by im-
proved quality of life and increased productivity, even if
only marginal, and which may prevent an episode of major
depression.
Fourth, the model did not consider factors, such as
gender and general medical comorbidities. In regard to
gender, females are usually more likely to seek services for
mental health reasons (16), and thus the health outcomes may
be overestimated for males. In addition, treatment of
mental health problems with evidence-based psychologi-
cal interventions can also significantly benefit general medical
conditions. Therefore, the study may have underestimated the
potential gain in health-related quality of life (70) and the de-
crease in health service use by individuals with depression and
chronic general medical illnesses (71), as reported elsewhere.
Fifth, the model did not account for any positive or negative
lifetime events (for example, a new job or the loss of a job or
bereavement after the death of a family member), which may
also affect the incidence and persistence of episodes. Sixth,
although the analyses included the costs and decrements in
utility associated with the prevalence and persistence of
antidepressant use, the direct effect that publicly funded
psychotherapy may have on patterns of prescription—for
example, incidence and persistence of antidepressant use—is
difficult to estimate and was not considered. Finally, most
mental health problems start in childhood (72), and the
study may have underestimated the potential benefits of
providing services to children with depression, including
cost savings to society.
If one were to consider covering psychotherapy sessions
for all Canadian adults with incident depression (2.9%), the
program costs would reach $1.008 billion CAD. This esti-
mate is similar to those in previous reports. In Australia, in
the first three years of the Better Access initiative, close to
2,017,000 individuals received close to 11.1 million psy-
chotherapy sessions (six sessions per individual) (73), for a
total budget, in Canadian dollars, of $2.80 billion or $1,514
per individual. More than half of individuals had never
consulted a professional for their mental health problems.
In the United Kingdom, the cost of the IAPT program in
2006 was estimated at £600 million to treat 800,000 patients
opting for psychological therapy (21). Recently, the National
Health Service invested an additional £400 million in the
IAPT program to offer services to children, adolescents, older

 adults, and persons with severe mental illness and chronic
general medical problems (74). In France, the estimated yearly
cost of covering 12 psychological sessions for persons with
depression and those with anxiety disorders (close to 2.3% of
the population) was $729 million (in Canadian dollars) (22).
This estimate is lower than in our study, because a psycho-
therapy session in France costs €41 ($65 CAD), and in Canada
it costs an average of $145 CAD.
Finally, our results indicate that covering psychological ser-
vices as part of Medicare for individuals with major depression
who do not receive adequate care would pay for itself. In
Canada,every $1 investedin the programwould yieldon average
$2 ($1.78–$3.15) in savings to society. In the United Kingdom,
the return on investment for the IAPT program reached £1.75
for every £1 in health care expenditures (20,65,66). In France,
spending €1 in psychotherapy for people with depression
yielded savings of €1.95 (€1.30–€2.60) (23).
To put the results of this study into perspective for de-
cision makers, public expenditures for mental health and
addictions account for only 7.2% of the total health budget in
Canada, amounting to $540 per capita (75). An additional
investment of $3.42 per capita, representing .07% of the total
health care budget, would lead to a more efficient publicly
managed health care system that would produce cost savings
for society and improved indicators of mental health in the
population, including reductions in disability, in premature loss
of life, and in loss of productivity. Major depression has been
identified as a leading cause of disease burden (76), and health
planners and decision makers should aim to develop mental
health policies that reduce income barriers to accessing
psychotherapy services in
primary care (16,17) for indi-
viduals who are not otherwise
able to access such care.
The health policy of cov-
ering psychological services
as part of Medicare in a public
managed health care system
may have important impli-
cations. In Australia, the in-
creasing costs of the Better
Access program caused great
concern, and many argued
that the program was wid-
ening the socioeconomic gap
in mental health service use
(77). However, Harris and
colleagues (78) showed that
over 90% of Better Access
users had a 12-month ICD-10
mental disorder or other rel-
evant indication. Those with-
out an affective or anxiety
disorder who used services
were not from higher socio-
economic groups, and those
with a mental disorder received significantly more services
than those without.
Finally, a successful health policy that is aimed at im-
proving access to mental health services and that is relevant
to a public health care system should consider the following:
access (who gets treatment?), equity, type of services offered,
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (are health outcomes
improved at a sustainable cost?), and patient-centered care
(does the service meet individual mental health needs?) (79).
Future research should also focus on modeling the im-
pact of improved access to psychological services for
children, adolescents, and clinically complex populations
with multiple morbidities for whom the return on in-
vestment may be more important compared with the adult
population (80).

a The alternative scenario provides increased access (IA) to publicly funded psychological services for major depressive
episode among persons with unmet need for mental health care.
b Less pessimistic (irrespective of health service use): utility for well state, .85; utility for days depressed, .58
c For individuals with incident major depression who accessed publicly funded psychological therapies, the number of
annual visits is four with or without two general practitioner (GP) visits.
d For individuals receiving care from all three types of professionals (GP or family physician, psychiatrist, and other mental
health specialist), all costs related to visits to other mental health specialists will be incurred by the health system.
