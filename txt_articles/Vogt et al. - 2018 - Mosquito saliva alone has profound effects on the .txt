Abstract
Mosquito saliva is a very complex concoction of >100 proteins, many of which have
unknown functions. The effects of mosquito saliva proteins injected into our skin during
blood feeding have been studied mainly in mouse models of injection or biting, with many of
these systems producing results that may not be relevant to human disease. Here, we
describe the numerous effects that mosquito bites have on human immune cells in mice
engrafted with human hematopoietic stem cells. We used flow cytometry and multiplex cyto-
kine bead array assays, with detailed statistical analyses, to detect small but significant vari-
ations in immune cell functions after 4 mosquitoes fed on humanized mice footpads. After
preliminary analyses, at different early times after biting, we focused on assessing innate
immune and subsequent cellular responses at 6 hours, 24 hours and 7 days after mosquito
bites. We detected both Th1 and Th2 human immune responses, and delayed effects on
cytokine levels in the blood, and immune cell compositions in the skin and bone marrow, up
to 7 days post-bites. These are the first measurements of this kind, with human immune
responses in whole animals, bitten by living mosquitoes, versus previous studies using
incomplete mouse models and salivary gland extracts or needle injected saliva. The results
have major implications for the study of hematophagous insect saliva, its effects on the
human immune system, with or without pathogen transmission, and the possibility of deter-
mining which of these proteins to target for vaccination, in attempts to block transmission of
numerous tropical diseases.
Author summary
Mosquito saliva proteins have numerous effects on the immune system, and we describe
here the use of mice with a humanized immune system to study the effects of mosquito
bites on human cells. Our results show that the number of immune cell types affected is
much larger than previously described, and some immune responses to mosquito bites
can be detected up until 7 days post-bite. The biological significance of these changes
remains to be determined, but it might explain how some pathogens, such as viruses, can

Introduction
Approximately 750,000 people die of mosquito transmitted diseases each year, including
malaria, dengue, West Nile, Zika, and chikungunya fevers [1, 2]. The incidence of these dis-
eases is expected to rise significantly in the next few decades as the host ranges of multiple spe-
cies of mosquitoes increase due to climate change [3, 4]. Not only do mosquitoes transmit
diseases, but they also may increase the severity of the diseases they transmit. In experimental
infections of mice, delivery of arboviruses via mosquito bite or via needle injection in conjunc-
tion with uninfected mosquito bite results in more severe disease than delivery of virus alone
via needle injection [5–9]. In mouse models of infections by malaria and leishmania parasites,
mosquito and sandfly saliva have also been shown to enhance infectivity and disease progres-
sion [10, 11].
Mosquito saliva is a complex mixture of proteins that allows the mosquito to acquire a
blood meal from its host (necessary for egg maturation), by circumventing vasoconstriction,
platelet aggregation, coagulation, and inflammation or hemostasis (reviewed in [12]). It is well
known that mosquito saliva contains proteins that are immunogenic to humans, and some
allergic responses can be very severe [13, 14]. Because mosquito saliva can be immunogenic, it
is speculated that mosquito saliva may enhance pathogenicity of arboviruses by manipulating
the host’s immune response.
The human immune system can be divided into innate (natural killer (NK) cells, neutro-
phils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells) and adaptive (T and B cells)
arms. Upon activation, innate immune cells release cytokines and chemokines, kill cells via
cytotoxic molecules (NK cells only), and phagocytose pathogens, which aids in pathogen
destruction and allows specialized cells to process antigens for presentation to T and B cells.
Successful T and B cell activation by their cognate antigen induces their differentiation into
clonal effector or long-lived antigen specific memory cells both of which are crucial to protect
us from recurrent, severe disease (reviewed in [15]).
T cells are often classified based on expression of the CD4 or CD8 co-receptors. Upon acti-
vation, CD4 T cells can differentiate into a variety of T helper cells (Th1, Th2, etc.), each with
unique functions, whereas CD8 T cells become cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [16, 17]. A
small proportion of T cells outside of the thymus express both CD4 and CD8. These double
positive (DP) T cells arise from CD4 or CD8 T cells that upregulate expression of the other co-
receptor in the periphery through an unknown mechanism [18]. DP T cells can have similar,
albeit more exaggerated, functions to CTLs [18–23]; moreover, they can regulate or exacerbate
inflammation through the production of cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, and IFNγ [18, 24,
25]. Another type of T cell that performs similar functions to DP T cells is the natural killer T
(NKT) cell. These cells, which develop in the thymus and express a rearranged T cell receptor
and NK cell markers, can be cytotoxic. Activated NKT cells are also potent and rapid cytokine
producers and can polarize immune responses through the production of large amounts of
IFNγ, IL-4, and/or IL-17A [26–28].
Immune responses can be classified according to the type of helper T cell involved; the two
canonical immune responses are the Th1 response and the Th2 response. The Th1 response
typically involves a cell-mediated response to eradicate intracellular pathogens. Antigen pre-
senting cells activated by intracellular pathogens produce the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18. These

 cytokines stimulate naïve CD4 T cells to differentiate into Th1 T cells, which produce the cyto-
kines IFNγ, IL-2, and TNFβ and stimulate the activation of CTLs. Th1 cells also stimulate B
cells to produce specific IgG isotypes that mediate effector functions against intracellular path-
ogens [29]. The Th2 response typically involves a strong humoral response to eradicate extra-
cellular pathogens and parasites. When overactive, a Th2 response can cause allergies or
asthma. During a Th2 response, activated mast cells or T cells produce the cytokine IL-4,
which stimulates naïve CD4 T cells to become Th2 cells. These Th2 cells produce more IL-4 as
well as the cytokines IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13, which together, inhibit phagocytic
inflammation and promote the proliferation and survival of mast cells and other cells needed
for the clearance of extracellular pathogens. Th2 cells also stimulate B cells to produce antibod-
ies of the IgE isotype. Th1 and Th2 responses are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as mixed
Th1/Th2 immune response can occur; however, cytokines produced in each response do
actively inhibit production of cytokines and processes involved in the other response (reviewed
in [17, 30, 31]).
In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of mosquito saliva on the human immune
system. Previous studies have addressed this phenomenon but used mouse models genetically
predisposed to a Th1 (C57BL6 mice) or Th2 (BALB/c mice) response, and/or used mosquito
salivary gland extracts instead of secreted mosquito saliva or mosquito bites [32, 33]. These
studies have produced conflicting results as to the anti-inflammatory and viral enhancing
properties of saliva proteins [13]. Furthermore, these studies did not use detailed analyses of
cellular responses to mosquito bites or use mouse models that mimic human infection [34,
35]. It is clear that mouse models of human disease do not replicate many innate and adaptive
immune responses [36], so we sought to create a model in which we could measure the human
cytokine and cellular responses, in vivo. Thus, we have developed a humanized mouse model
of mosquito biting, to study the specific effects of mosquito saliva on the pathogenesis of mos-
quito-borne viruses. Our results are the only to measure the effects of mosquito bite on specific
components of the human immune system, especially early after saliva injection, and they
indicate long-lasting effects of these components, up to 7 days in human skin and bone mar-
row cells.
Materials and methods
Mosquito rearing
Aedes aegypti (Rockefeller) mosquitoes were obtained from BEI resources as eggs (MRA-734).
Mosquitoes were maintained under standard insectary conditions (~28˚C, 80% relative
humidity) with a 12-hour light/dark cycle maintained by the Philips Hue Smart Lighting sys-
tem. Larvae were raised in water pans and fed on a mixture of ground rabbit chow (Purina)-
liver powder (Bio-Serv)-yeast (Bio Serv) in a 4:1:1 ratio, ad libitum. Emerged mosquitoes were
moved to mesh cages and fed on 10% sucrose (Sigma) solution ad libitum. Colony mainte-
nance was performed by feeding mosquitoes on anesthetized C57/BL6 mice (IACUC AN-
6151). In the subsequent days following blood feeding, eggs were collected, desiccated, and
stored for a maximum of 6 months.
Mosquito salivation
Mosquito saliva was collected from female Aedes aegypti Rockefeller mosquitoes 4–5 days
post-eclosion. Adult female mosquitoes were immobilized by removal of wings and legs. The
proboscis was inserted into a 10μL microcapillary tube (Drummond) containing microscopy-
grade immersion oil (Zeiss). The mosquitoes were allowed to salivate into the oil at insectary
conditions for 45 minutes. After salivation, the mosquitoes were confirmed to have salivated

 and be alive as evidenced by saliva droplets in the oil, and response to physical stimulus,
respectively. Saliva was extracted immediately from the oil by pooling the salivations and add-
ing one volume of cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The salivation/PBS mixture was pulse
vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000g for 5min. The aqueous layer was removed and the protein
concentration was quantified using the BCA assay (Pierce).
Isolation and stimulation of human PBMCs
Source leukocytes were obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (Houston,
TX). PBMCs were isolated via density centrifugation using Leucosep centrifuge tubes (Gre-
nier Bio-one) and lymphocyte separation media (Corning) according to manufacturers’
protocols. To remove any residual red blood cell contamination, PBMC pellets were then
treated with red blood cell lysis solution (eBiosciences) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and were plated at 1x106 cells/well in a 24 well plate. PBMCs were stimulated with mosquito
saliva (2μg salivary proteins per well), or the equivalent of 4 mosquito bites [37], to corre-
spond with the number of infected mosquito bites required to produce dengue fever in
humanized mice [7], and lipopolysaccharide (1mg/L media; Sigma), pokeweed mitogen
(5mg/L media; Sigma), or untreated media. Supernatant samples were collected daily for
five days post stimulation to assess cytokine production. On day five post stimulation, all
PBMCs were assessed via flow cytometry.
Production of humanized mice
Humanized mice were engrafted as previously described [7]. Briefly, male and female NSG
breeders were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, and mice were bred in the Transgenic
Mouse Facility at Baylor College of Medicine. One day post birth, each pup from these
breedings was sublethally irradiated with 100 centigrays and intrahepatically injected with
3x105 CD34+ stem cells. These stem cells were isolated from human umbilical vein cord
blood from either the University of Texas MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank (Houston, TX)
or the Texas Cord Blood Bank (San Antonio, TX) using the Dynabeads CD34 positive selec-
tion kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of engraftment of
human hematopoietic cells were tested 6 to 8 weeks later using flow cytometry to target
human and mouse CD45+ cells (S1 Table).
Mosquito biting of Hu-NSG mice
Mosquito biting of reconstituted humanized mice was carried out as previously reported [7],
although with uninfected mosquitoes. In short, 4 to 7 days post-emergence, female mosquitoes
were starved for 24 hours in dram vials (4–6 mosquitoes per vial) capped in a fine, white poly-
ester mesh (Bio-Serv). Dram vials were kept at insectary conditions (28˚C, 80% humidity) for
the duration of the 24-hour starving. Mosquitoes were then transferred to a BSL3 facility, and
the dram vials were held against a footpad of anesthetized, humanized mice, allowing the mos-
quitoes to feed (IACUC AN-6151). A “bite” was defined visually by mosquito engorgement
and did not include probing; approximately 4 bites total occurred for each mouse, on both
footpads. This number was chosen based on our previous studies demonstrating that 4
infected mosquitoes are required to bite each humanized mouse to consistently produce den-
gue fever [7].

 Tissue collection and processing
Six hours, 24 hours, or 7 days post mosquito bite, mice were humanely euthanized via isoflur-
ane overdose. Upon cessation of breathing, mice were exsanguinated via intracardiac bleed.
Blood was stored in heparin treated and untreated microcentrifuge tubes for further process-
ing. Skin from rear footpads was removed using surgical scissors and stored separately in PBS
with 2% FBS (PBS/FBS) and 5μg/mL collagenase. Spleens and femurs were also removed from
each mouse and stored separately in PBS/FBS.
Blood stored in untreated tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for at least thirty min-
utes. The clotted blood was then centrifuged at 1500g for ten minutes at 4˚C. Following this cen-
trifugation, serum was transferred to new microfuge tubes and stored at -70˚C until used in
multiplex cytokine bead array assay. Blood stored in heparinized tubes were transferred to 50mL
conical tubes. Red blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis solution (eBioscience) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The remaining white blood cell pellet was resuspended at 1x104 to 1x106
cells/mL in PBS/FBS. These cells were stored at 4˚C until stained for flow cytometry analysis.
Skin footpads were cut into small pieces and incubated in PBS/FBS and 5mg/mL collage-
nase at 37˚C for 1 hour. Following digestion, skin pieces were ground over a 40μm cell strainer
into a 50mL conical tube. Skin cells were washed twice in PBS/FBS and resuspended at 1x104
to 1x106 cells/mL in PBS/FBS.
Spleens were burst by grinding between two frosted microscope slides. Spleen contents
were then ground over a 40μm strainer into a 50mL conical tube. Red blood cells were lysed
using RBC lysis solution (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Remaining
cells were resuspended at 1x106 – 1x107 cells/mL in PBS/FBS.
Bone marrow was flushed out of femurs using a 25G needle filled with PBS/FBS. Marrow
was ground over a 40μm strainer into a 50mL conical tube. Red blood cells were lysed and
remaining cells were resuspended as with the spleen cells.
Flow cytometry
Blood, bone marrow, skin, and spleen cells from hu-NSG mice and stimulated human PBMCs
were transferred to 96 well plates and incubated with antibodies against extracellular targets
(Table 1) on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the FoxP3 Transcrip-
tion Factor Staining Buffer Kit (eBioscience) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following
permeabilization, cells from hu-NSG mice were incubated with antibodies against intracellular
targets (Table 1) on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS/FBS, and stored
at 4˚C until analysis. Samples were analyzed on the LSRII Fortessa (BD) using the HTS mod-
ule. Data were collected using the FACSDiva software (BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJo
(v10.2; FlowJo, LLC) (S2 Fig).
Multiplex cytokine bead array assay
Cytokine and chemokine levels in PBMC supernatant and mouse serum samples were determined
using the Milliplex 41-plex human cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel (Millipore) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were collected on either the Bio-Plex (Bio-Rad) using
Bio-Plex Manager software or the Magpix (Millipore) using xPonent software (Luminex).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (v6.0; GraphPad) software. Outliers were
removed using ROUT analysis (Q = 1%). Data were analyzed via two-way ANOVA and t-test
using Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons.

Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine (IACUC Protocol AN-6151),
and the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute
for Laboratory Animal Research, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences,
2011). The Institutional Review Board at Baylor College of Medicine determined that our use
of human blood products in this study did not constitute human subjects research.
Results
Mosquito saliva increases the frequency of natural killer T cells in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells
Our previous studies demonstrated that mosquito saliva enhances dengue infection in human-
ized mice [7]. Therefore, we hypothesized that mosquito saliva modulates the human immune
response to enable virus replication. To determine which type of effects we might see in
human immune cells, we studied the ex vivo responses of primary human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to mosquito saliva.
Human PBMCs were isolated from two separate blood donors and then treated with mos-
quito saliva (equal to 4 mosquito bites: 2.0 μg [37]) or untreated media. We examined the
immune cell populations present 5 days post treatment via flow cytometry (Fig 1). Natural
killer T cells (NKT; CD3+CD56+) were found at a higher frequency following mosquito saliva
treatment; however, we saw no statistical differences in the number of activated cells (CD69+).
When activated, NKT cells can rapidly produce large amounts of IFNγ, IL-4, and/or IL-17A.
Fig 1. Mosquito saliva increased frequency of CD4+CD8+ double positive T cells and natural killer T cells. Human PBMCs from two donors were
stimulated with either mosquito saliva or untreated media. Flow cytometry was performed on these cells 5 days post stimulation to assess frequencies of different
immune cell populations. These frequencies are expressed as the mean percentage of CD45+ cells with error bars indicating 1 standard error of the mean (SEM).
The subset of the T cell plot represents the percentage of NKT cells that were activated. T-tests were performed using GraphPad Prism. Multiple comparisons
were corrected for using the Holm-Sidak method, which increased the significance threshold to p < 0.01. #, p<0.1; ##, p<0.05; �, p<0.01; ��p<0.005.

 These cytokines can polarize the immune system towards a Th1, Th2, or Th17 response,
respectively. [26–28].
Mosquito saliva suppresses cytokine production in human PBMC cultures
Cytokines are secreted signaling proteins of the innate immune system and are crucial in
establishing an effective immune response; thus, we investigated whether mosquito saliva has
an effect on cytokines produced by human PBMCs ex vivo. Supernatants were collected daily
from human PBMCs treated with either mosquito saliva or untreated media; cytokine levels
were assessed using multiplex cytokine bead array assays. As positive controls, PBMCs were
stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or pokeweed mitogen to verify that these PBMCs were able
to produce cytokines (S1 Fig).
Mosquito saliva-treated PBMCs had lower supernatant concentrations at all time
points of most cytokines examined compared to those of the untreated control, with the
most significant decreases at days 1 and 2 post treatment (Fig 2). The most significantly
lowered cytokines were PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and RANTES, all of which are secreted in
response to endothelium wall breach and promote clotting and immune cell recruitment
[38, 39]. These functions would antagonize mosquito feeding; thus, suppression of these
cytokines by mosquito saliva is not unexpected. However, RANTES does regulate CD8+ T
cell functions during West Nile virus and HIV infections, so suppression of this cytokine
by mosquito saliva could impact the anti-viral immune response [40]. We also observed a
decrease in levels of IP-10 in saliva-treated PBMCs; IP-10 is a chemokine that can attract a
wide variety of immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells
[41]. In the context of dengue virus infection, IP-10 has been shown to have a protective
effect by competitively inhibiting the access of dengue virus to heparin sulfate, a putative
host cell receptor [42, 43]; thus, mosquito saliva could potentially enhance infection by
decreasing IP-10 levels. Currently, we are unable to determine whether mosquito saliva
actively inhibits the process of cytokine production or merely kills the cells responsible
for producing the cytokines.

 Preliminary flow cytometry studies
After observing alterations in cytokine production and NKT cell frequency in PBMCs treated
with mosquito saliva, we expanded our study to investigate the effects of mosquito saliva on
the immune system of an entire organism. To this end, we used the hu-NSG mouse model
(humanized NOD/SCID/IL2-gamma chain null mice (NSG), generated by infusion of human
hematopoietic stem cells into NSG mice), which reproduces human myeloid and human lym-
phoid cell responses and is susceptible to infection by dengue virus [7, 44–47]. To determine
the impact of mosquito bite on the population of various immune cells, donor matched hu-
NSG mice were each bitten by an average of 4 mosquitoes on their rear footpads while under
ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Mice were euthanized at 12 hours, 24 hours, or 48 hours post-
bite. Skin (rear footpads), blood, spleen, and bone marrow were examined for immune cell
population changes to capture both the local and the systemic changes in response to mosquito
bite. Unbitten mice served as negative controls. Figs 3 and 4 describe the changes in T cell and
other leukocyte populations, respectively.
To summarize our results, at 12 hours post-bite, IL-2 producing CD4 T cells (CD45+,
CD3+, CD4+, IL-2+) were decreased in the blood in the exposed compared to control mice.
Also at 12 hours post-bite, B cells (CD45+, CD3-, CD19+) cells were decreased in the skin.
At 24 hours post-bite, NK cells (CD45+, CD3-, CD56+) were increased in the blood. Also,
at 24 hours post-bite, CD8 T cells (CD45+, CD3+, CD8+) were increased in the bone mar-
row while CD14+ myeloid cells (CD45+, CD3-. CD14+, CD11c+) were decreased in the
bone marrow. In the skin at 24 hours post-bite, IL-12 producing monocytes and macro-
phages (CD45+, CD3-, CD14+, IL-12+) were increased. Lastly, at 48 hours, CD4 T cells
(CD45+, CD3+, CD4+) were decreased in the blood, and NK cells (CD45+, CD3-, CD56+)
were decreased in the bone marrow. Collectively, these results indicate that mosquito saliva
modulates the human immune system represented in our humanized mice, and many sig-
nificant changes occur in the early hours after mosquito bite. These responses include
migration of leukocytes and T cells into the blood, skin and bone marrow; this indicated
that further effects could probably be measured downstream, later in time after bite.
Mosquito bite impacts lymphocyte and myeloid cells across multiple
tissues
Because our preliminary flow cytometry study revealed that mosquito bite impacts the
immune system of the hu-NSG mice, we performed a similar experiment using different time
points (6 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days post-bite) to deepen our knowledge of the effects of mos-
quito saliva on the innate (6 hours, 24 hours) and adaptive (7 days) immune responses. For
experiments involving these new time points, mice were bitten and euthanized and their tis-
sues collected as in the preliminary flow cytometry study. Figs 5 and 6, along with Tables 2 and
3, describe the changes in T cell and other leukocyte populations, respectively.
At 6 hours post-bite in the blood, we observed an increase in NKT cells (CD45+, CD3+,
CD56+), CD8 T cells (CD45+, CD3+, CD4-, CD8+), and DP T cells (CD45+, CD3+, CD4+,
CD8+), which all have cytotoxic capabilities, and a decrease in regulatory T cells (Tregs;
CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, FoxP3+), which can dampen inflammatory responses through secre-
tion of IL-10. Also, B cells (CD45+, CD3-, CD19+), NK cells (CD45+, CD3-, CD56+) and
myeloid cells (CD45+, CD3-, CD11c+; dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutro-
phils) were increased at 6 hours in the blood. The increase of B cells we observed is likely a
result of increased production of B cells in the bone marrow. Most myeloid cells are anti-
gen-presenting cells; their increase in the blood may indicate that they are travelling either
to or from the bite site. In the spleen, there was an increase in NK cells, but a decrease in the

 total number of T cells (CD45+, CD3+), and in the bone marrow there were decreases in
both total T cells and Tregs. Considering that we observed an increase in multiple T cell
subsets in the blood, the reduction of T cells in these two organs could be a result of migra-
tion to the blood. Taken together, these results indicate that the immune system is not at
steady-state and may be shifting toward a Th1 response; future studies will verify that con-
clusion by determining which cytokines, if any, are being produced by the DP T, NKT, NK,
and CD11c+ cells.
At 24 hours post-bite, Tregs were increased in the blood and decreased in the spleen. The
decrease of Tregs in the spleen is coincident with an increase of Tregs in the blood and could
indicate that the Tregs migrated from the spleen to the blood. If the increase of Tregs in the
blood were associated with an increase in serum IL-10 levels, then this could indicate an anti-
inflammatory response. In the skin, DP T cells were decreased at 24 hours post-bite. Because
DP T cells are often associated with inflammatory responses, this could indicate a decrease in
inflammation in the skin. We also saw a decrease in myeloid cells in the spleen and NK cells in
the bone marrow. Taken together, these results indicate a shift towards an anti-inflammatory
response.
At 7 days post-bite, DP T cells were increased in the blood, skin, and bone marrow. These
DP T cells are typically found at sites of inflammation, indicating that there may be skin
inflammation occurring at this time point. There was also a decrease in Tregs and an increase
in NK cells in the skin, providing a further indication of inflammation in the skin. We also saw
a decrease in neutrophils and myeloid cells in the blood. Because inflammation and DP T cells
are associated with both Th1 and Th2 responses, further experiments will need to be done to
determine the role of DP T cells following mosquito bite. We saw a decrease in neutrophils
and myeloid cells in the blood and a decrease in myeloid cells and monocytes and macro-
phages cells in the bone marrow. Lastly, there was an increase in CD8 T cells but a decrease in
myeloid cells in the spleen. CD8 T cells are typically associated with a Th1 response and can
produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further experiments will determine
whether mosquito saliva activates these CD8 T cells and stimulates them to produce cytokines.
While T cells and NK cells indicate an inflammatory response, the overall data suggest a mixed
Th1/Th2 response.
Mosquito bite alters cytokine levels in hu-NSG mice
To further our examination of mosquito bites on the immune system of humanized mice, we
investigated whether serum levels of human cytokines changed in mosquito-bitten mice.
Serum was collected at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days post-bite from the same mice used to
examine immune cell populations, and cytokine levels were measured via multiplex cytokine
bead array assays. Fig 7A shows the fold-change of each bitten mouse compared to the mean
of the control group. Cytokines were grouped by the following functions to assist in analysis:
chemokines, growth factors pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, Th1
cytokines, and Th2 cytokines. A majority of the bitten mice did not appear to differ from the
control in cytokine levels; however, the fold change differences in Th2 cytokines and anti-
inflammatory cytokines increased over time.

 Despite a lack of significant changes across broad classes of cytokines, we did see significant
changes in concentrations of specific cytokines. At 6 hours post-bite, we saw an increase in the
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α, but a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p40
and TNFα. In addition to promoting inflammation, IL-12p40 stimulates the production of
IFNγ (the major Th1 cytokine) by NK cells and T cells [48]. We also saw a decrease in the Th2
cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 at 6 hours post- bite. Both of these cytokines are produced by T cells
[49, 50]; from our examination of T cell populations in the hu-NSG mice following mosquito
bite (Fig 5), we saw a significant decrease in total T cells in the spleen and bone marrow and a
trend toward a decrease in total T cells in the skin and blood at 6 hours post-bite. This decrease
in T cells may account for the decreased serum concentrations of IL-5 and IL-9. We also saw a
decreased serum concentration of the chemokines IL-8, MCP-1, and MDC at this time point.
Lastly, we saw an increase in the growth factor VEGF at this time point; VEGF is often released
in response to endothelium wall breach to stimulate the growth of endothelial cells [51, 52].
Since the mosquito bites likely caused limited vascular injury in the mice, it is not unexpected
that we observed an increase in serum VEGF in the bitten mice compared to the control mice.
To summarize, the serum cytokine concentrations at 6 hours post- bite indicate a dysregula-
tion of inflammatory signaling, a decrease in Th1 and Th2 signaling, an alteration in chemo-
tactic signaling, and an increase in endothelium repair signaling.
At 24 hours post-bite, we saw an increase in the pro-inflammatory and anti-viral cytokine
IFNα [53]. This cytokine is usually produced in response to viral infection, so its presence after
uninfected mosquito bite is unexpected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of IFNα pro-
duction following mosquito bite. We saw a decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-
1RA, a cytokine that competitively inhibits IL-1α and IL-1β from binding to the IL-1 receptor
[54, 55]. The increase in this cytokine may be an attempt to regulate the increased IL-1α
observed at 6 hours post-bite. We saw an increase in the Th2 cytokine IL-9; this increase con-
trasts with our observation at 6 hours post-bite where a decrease in IL-9 was coincident with a
decrease in the number of total T cells. At 24 hours post-bite, numbers of total T cells in the
bitten mice is equivalent to that of the control mice, which may account for the increase in
serum concentrations of IL-9. We saw an increase in the chemokines fractalkine and MDC.
An increase in these chemokines in the serum could induce an influx monocytes and other
cells that express the appropriate chemokine receptors into the blood [56–58]. We did not see
any shifts in monocyte populations in the mice at 24 hours post-bite, but perhaps this shift
occurred at a time point that was not analyzed. Lastly, we saw an increase in the growth factors
VEGF and IL-3. As previously mentioned, VEGF is involved in endothelium wall repair; IL-3
is also involved in endothelium wall repair and promotes the production of platelets, which
are consumed during an endothelium wall breach [59]. To summarize, the serum cytokines
present at 24 hours post-bite indicate an interferon response, an anti-inflammatory response, a
Th2 response, an influx of monocytes, and a continued endothelium repair response.
At 7 days post-bite, we saw a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokine sCD40L in the bit-
ten mice compared to the control mice. In addition to stimulating an inflammatory response,
this cytokine is also important for immunoglobulin class switching by B cells [60–62]. In the

 context of a viral infection, decreasing or preventing immunoglobulin class switching could be
detrimental for the host. We saw an increase in serum concentrations of the chemokine frac-
talkine and a decrease in the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1. Since both fractalkine and MCP-1
attract similar cell types (namely monocytes), it is difficult to predict whether changes in con-
centrations of these two chemokines affect efflux or influx of cells into the blood [56, 57, 63].
While we did not see a significant change in monocyte numbers in the blood, we did see a
decrease of monocytes in the bone marrow at this time point. Also, the decrease in IL-8 in the
serum did correspond with a decrease in neutrophils (the target of IL-8) in the blood and a
trend toward an increase in neutrophils in the skin [64]. We also observed an increase in the
growth factors IL-3 and IL-7. IL-7 enhances the growth of early B and T cells and stimulates
the proliferation of mature T cells [65, 66]. This increase in IL-7 correlated with an increase in
CD8 T cells in the spleen and DP T cells in the blood, skin, and bone marrow. To summarize,
at 7 days post-bite, we saw a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, an increase in some but
a decrease in other chemokines, and an increase in growth factors.
We were unable to detect the following cytokines in the serum of either the bitten or the
control mice at any of the time points: Flt-3 ligand, GRO, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-15,
MCP3, TGFα and TNFβ. Of these, GRO, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13 and TGFα can be detected in
the serum of healthy humans [67–70]. T cells are the primary producers of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
and IL-13 [71–78]. Because hu-NSG mice do not have a human thymus, the T cells present in
these mice are not HLA restricted to human cells and may not respond appropriately to signals
from other human immune cells in the mice. This could account for the lack of these cytokines
in the serum. Both GRO and TGFα are produced by keratinocytes and monocytes in the skin
[79, 80]. Since hu-NSG mice do not have human keratinocytes, these mice would produce low
to no levels of GRO and TGFα. Lastly, since we only investigated cytokines present in the
serum of these mice, our data do not exclude the possibility that these cytokines were produced
in the tissues. Future studies will investigate what cytokines are produced at the site of mos-
quito bite and at other tissues throughout the body.

 Discussion
Mosquitoes deposit numerous salivary proteins into their host’s skin while acquiring a blood
meal. Past work has shown that mosquito saliva enhances the pathogenicity of dengue, West
Nile, and other arbovirus infections. From these results, we hypothesized that mosquito saliva
modulates the host immune system in a way that promotes arbovirus replication and transmis-
sion. In this work, we used human PBMCs treated with mosquito saliva and humanized mice
bitten by mosquitoes to determine what effects mosquito saliva alone has on the human
immune system. Our results suggest that the human immune response to mosquito saliva is
significant and complex: mosquito saliva alters the frequencies of several immune cell popula-
tions, in multiple tissues, at several times after blood feeding. Mosquito saliva also affects
serum cytokine levels, with the most notable trend being an increase in anti-inflammatory and
Th2 cytokines compared to unbitten, control mice, at 7 days post- bite. The fact that these
effects last up to 7 days post-bite is especially interesting, and is of concern in the context of
allergic reactions. The long-lasting effects in the humanized bone marrow and skin cells could
explain how some of the viruses transmitted by mosquitoes could possibly still be viable in
these tissues, or how they could serve as replication reservoirs.
Relatively few studies have investigated the effects of mosquito saliva on human cells ex
vivo; fewer have investigated cytokine production from human cells following stimulation
with mosquito saliva. Salivary gland extracts from the Armigeres subalbatus mosquito (a vector
of Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses) induce apoptosis in human PBMCs and THP-
1 cells (human monocytic cell line) [81]. In another ex vivo study, monocyte-derived dendritic
cells differentiated from human PBMCs produced higher amounts of the cytokine IL-12p70
when stimulated with mosquito saliva collected from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes [82]. In a third
study, mosquito saliva from Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (a vector of malaria) induced the
degranulation of the human mast cell line LAD-2 [83]. We did not detect a significant decrease
in cell populations or an increase in IL-12p70 production in our ex vivo studies; however, this
is most likely due to differences in study design. We used mosquito saliva as opposed to sali-
vary gland extract (a heterogeneous mixture of saliva and the cells that make it) and mono-
cyte-derived dendritic cells and mast cells are rarely found in the blood and therefore would
not be a component of our human PBMCs.
Other mouse studies of the effects of mosquito saliva on the immune system concluded that
mosquito saliva primes the immune response toward a Th2 response (reviewed in [84]); how-
ever, our results indicate a mixed Th1/Th2 response. We observed increases in both regulatory
T cells and CD4/CD8 double positive T cells. As these cells are rare, and more potent cytokine
producers and killers than conventional single positive T cells [18–22], it is interesting to spec-
ulate that mosquito saliva may be uniquely capable to induce the differentiation of single posi-
tive T cells into this cytotoxic double positive T cell subset. Further studies are needed to
examine whether these unique double positive T cells play an important role in host protection
from flavivirus infection. Furthermore, we noticed decreases in total T cells and natural killer

 cells after mosquito bite; these decreases may point toward a Th2 response. When analyzing
the serum cytokine response, we did observe a significant trend toward Th2 cytokine produc-
tion at 7 days post-bite. Th2 immune responses occur most often in response to parasitic infec-
tions or allergen exposure, and they tend to dampen inflammatory and cytotoxic responses,
both of which are needed to clear viral infections. Thus, if mosquito saliva were to trigger a
Th2 response in the context of an arbovirus infection, the virus would be able to replicate to
higher levels than it would in the presence of a Th1 response. In most arbovirus infections,
higher viral load corresponds to more severe disease. Thus, a saliva-induced Th2 immune
response could explain observations in experimental models of arbovirus infections that mos-
quito saliva enhances pathogenesis.
At various times post mosquito bite, we also observed increases in cell populations typically
associated with a Th1 immune response: natural killer T cells, natural killer cells, and CD8+ T
cells. While these cells can kill virus-infected cells and are generally important for clearing
viral infections, they have been implicated in increased disease severity of dengue infection in
humans [85]. In cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever in human children, increased numbers of
CD69+ natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells have been observed [86–88]. Some
speculate that the increase in these cell populations is a response to severe infection, not a
mechanism of pathogenesis; however CD8+ T cells isolated from these severely infected indi-
viduals were primed towards producing large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and not
towards killing viral infected cells [88, 89]. Further investigations will need to be done to deter-
mine whether the increased CD8+ T cell populations we observed were pro-inflammatory
CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that even though mosquito saliva increases
some subsets of immune cells typically associated with a Th1 immune response, these cells
could be responsible for increased disease severity in humans.
Our study is not the only one to show that mosquito saliva produces a mixed Th1/Th2
response. Pingen et al discovered that while a mosquito bite does induce some elements of a
Th2 response, it did not prevent elements of a Th1 response in C57BL/6 mice [90]. They con-
cluded that mosquito saliva enhances disease by recruiting arbovirus-susceptible cells to the
bite site, in their model of Semliki Forest virus infection. Zeidner et al. reached the same con-
clusion, in "flavivirus-susceptible" (C3H) mice bitten by Aedes mosquitoes, with some T cells
and cytokines detectable in the serum up to 7 days post-bite; however, this study did not
include flow cytometry, for identification of cell subsets, and these mice are not good models
of human infection [34]. In our study, we observed an increase in monocytes and macrophages
to the bite site, but only after 7 days post-bite. In the context of arbovirus infection, the migra-
tion we observed would be too late to impact the initial replication or dissemination of the
virus but could allow for infected cells to return to the skin where they could transmit the virus
to new mosquitoes. This is a significant observation that could possibly explain epidemiologic
events, where arbovirus transmission is often limited to distinct, small areas of hypertransmis-
sion, and where non-viremic hosts could be sources of infection [91–93].
All of the mouse studies of mosquito saliva effects reported previously have used mice that
differ from human immune systems: AG129 (which lack type I and type II interferon recep-
tors), BALB/c mice (which are predisposed to Th2 immune responses), and C57BL/6 mice
(which are predisposed to Th1 immune responses) [32, 33, 90, 94]. The mouse model we used
in this study does not have the same limitations because these mice have been reconstituted
with a human immune system, including innate immunity [95]. However, this model does not
have either a full human complement system or a fully functional T cell compartment [95]. In
future studies, we seek to address these limitations by using other types of reconstituted
humanized mice (e.g., BLT, DRAG), which would reproduce different parts of the human
immune system (such as active T helper cells, immunoglobulin class-switching, etc.) following

 mosquito bite [44, 47, 96]. In addition, we expect to test for the biological significance of these
immune cell changes, which might lead to stimulation of infected cells to migrate to important
sanctuary tissues (e.g., bone marrow or brain), where viral reservoirs could be established,
away from the full forces of the immune system. In the case of arboviruses, many establish
infections in brain or bone marrow cells of human patients, leading to specific pathologies
such as encephalitis or bone loss and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia [97–99]. It is currently
unclear if mosquito saliva contributes to these tissue infections and more severe pathologies.
Mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit are of growing public health concern. Often,
there are no prophylaxes for these diseases other than mosquito control and no treatments
other than palliative care. Understanding how mosquito saliva interacts with the human
immune system not only helps us understand mechanisms of disease pathogenesis but also
could provide possibilities for treatments. If we know which mosquito saliva components
enhance pathogenesis of diseases, we could create a human vaccine to counteract these effects
for multiple arbovirus infections. A similar approach has been used to vaccinate and protect
mice against a sandfly saliva protein (maxadilan) that enhances the infection and progression
of Leishmania major [100]. These approaches have been commercialized and used to interrupt
tick transmission of cattle diseases [101], and we expect that the definition of these factors
would help provide the same approaches in humans.

S1 Fig. Stimulation with pokeweed mitogen or LPS alters immune cell population frequen-
cies and cytokine production in human PBMCs. Human PBMCs were isolated from two
different human donors and stimulated with mosquito saliva, pokeweed mitogen, LPS, or
untreated media. Pokeweed mitogen and LPS were used to confirm that the human PBMCs
used in these experiments were capable of responding to immunomodulatory compounds. (A)
Immune cell population changes following stimulation with pokeweed mitogen and LPS.
Stimulated human PBMCs were analyzed via flow cytometry five days post stimulation. Data
presented are the mean frequencies of individual cell populations as a percentage of CD45+
cells. The subset of the T cell plot represents the percentage of NKT cells that were activated.
Error bars represent 1 standard error of the mean. Abbreviations: NK = Natural Killer; MF =
Macrophage; DC = Dendritic Cell; DP = Double Positive. Cell markers used to define cell pop-
ulations: T cells, CD45+CD3+; NK Cells, CD45+CD3-CD56+; B Cells, CD45+CD3-CD19+;
Monocytes/MFs, CD45+CD3-CD14+; Neutrophils, CD45+CD3-CD66b+; DCs/Monocytes/

lowing stimulation with pokeweed mitogen and LPS. Supernatants from stimulated human
PBMCs were collected daily up to five days post stimulation and analyzed for cytokine concen-
trations. Data shown are the log10 fold change of each of the stimulated conditions compared
to the media stimulated control for the each donor and time point; the darker the color, the
higher production of cytokines in treated PBMCs (saliva, pokeweed mitogen, or LPS). Areas
with slashes represent samples where no data were collected for that cytokine.
