Abstract: Pathogenic bacteria have evolved numerous virulence mechanisms that are essential 
for establishing infections. The enterobacteria, Yersinia, uses a Type III Secretion System 
(T3SS), encoded by a 70-kb, low-copy, IncFII-class virulence plasmid. Here, we report a novel 
virulence strategy in Y. pseudotuberculosis in which this pathogen up-regulates the plasmid copy-
number during infection. We show that increased dose of plasmid-encoded genes is 
indispensable for virulence and substantially elevates the expression and function of the T3SS. 
Remarkably, we found direct, tight coupling between plasmid replication and T3SS function. 
 This regulatory pathway provides a framework for further exploration of the environmental 
sensing mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria.
One Sentence Summary: Regulation of plasmid copy-number is an indispensable virulence 
strategy in pathogenic Yersinia.
Main Text: Three human pathogenic Yersinia strains: Y. pestis, Y. enterocolitica, and Y. 
pseudotuberculosis, share a common 70-kb virulence plasmid (IncFII) that encodes a set of 
virulence proteins, called Yersinia Outer Protein (Yops) (1, 2). These bacterial toxins are secreted 
by a plasmid-encoded organelle, the ysc/yop Type III Secretion System (T3SS) (3-5). The T3SS 
is composed of ~20 proteins that span the inner and outer bacterial membranes (6, 7). Upon 
contact with eukaryotic cells, Yersinia deploys the T3SS to translocate Yops into the cytoplasm 
of target cells via a translocon formed in the cell membrane (8, 9). This process is strictly 
regulated, and Yop expression and secretion increases after the bacterium establishes intimate 
contact with the eukaryotic target cell (10). This cell contact-dependent regulation can be 
mimicked in vitro at 37°C by depleting Ca2+ from the growth medium (11). 
Incubation of Yersinia at 37°C in Ca2+-deficient medium leads to T3SS induction and growth 
restriction after approximately two generations (4). Growth arrest may be due to the metabolic 
burden caused by excess expression of plasmid-encoded T3SS proteins (12). Thus, the function 
of the T3SS is paradoxical, because conditions that promote Yop-secretion result in bacterial 
growth restriction. This feature is incompatible with infection; consequently, we reasoned that 
Yersinia must have evolved a mechanism to circumvent this problem. We observed that 
increased levels of virulence plasmid DNA were recovered from wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis 
cells grown under T3SS-inducing conditions compared with bacteria grown under T3SS 
repressive conditions. Therefore, we hypothesized that Yersinia may undergo rapid changes in 
 gene expression by increasing and decreasing virulence plasmid copy-numbers. Rapid gene-dose 
changes could adjust the T3SS output to trade off virulence costs and the pathogen’s metabolic 
capacity to optimize growth. 
To explore a potential connection between virulence and plasmid copy-numbers, we first 
determined plasmid (pIBX) copy-numbers in Y. pseudotuberculosis YpIII (YpIII/pIBX) (13) 
cultures under different conditions with a PCR-free whole-genome sequencing approach (14). 
The depth of coverage (the number of times a nucleotide is read during the sequencing process) 
reflects the concentrations of chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA molecules in the sample. We 
found that the pIBX copy-number increased from ~1 to ~3 per chromosomal equivalent when 
conditions were repressive (26°C) or inductive (37°C, Ca2+-free), respectively, to T3SS activity 
(Fig 1A). At 37°C in the presence of Ca2+ (T3SS repressed conditions), the copy-number only 
increased modestly (1.6 per chromosomal equivalent). Similar differences in plasmid copy-
numbers were found with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Fig S1A) and Southern Blot 
analysis (Fig S1B). 
We used qPCR to determine the time course of pIBX copy-number variations. We found that the 
copy-number increased and plateaued 1 hour after the temperature shift to T3SS-inducing 
conditions (Fig 1B). Bacteria grown at 37°C under T3SS-repressing conditions plateaued at ~2 
chromosome equivalents (Fig 1B). These results confirmed that the plasmid copy-number 
increased in Y. pseudotuberculosis under T3SS-inducing conditions. 
To analyze the control of plasmid copy-number in Yersinia, we investigated copy-number 
changes in T3SS regulatory mutants. Earlier studies have shown that both Ca2+ and temperature 
regulates the T3SS in Yersinia (15, 16). LcrF activates transcription of the T3SS-regulon in 
 response to elevated temperature (37°C) and low Ca2+. lcrF mutants lack Yop expression and 
growth is not restricted in Ca2+-depleted medium at 37°C (16). In contrast, yopD mutants have 
Ca2+-insensitive Yop-expression and restricted growth at 37°C, irrespective of Ca2+ 
concentrations (17). Thus, YopD is involved in a negative-feedback regulatory pathway 
controlling T3SS expression (18). We found that plasmid copy-number control was not affected 
in a ΔlcrF mutant (YpIII/pIB73) (Fig 1C). In contrast, in a ΔyopD mutant (YpIII/pIB621), the 
plasmid copy-number was elevated at 37°C under T3SS-repressive conditions  (+Ca2+, Fig 1C). 
Thus, YopD is directly or indirectly inhibiting a default temperature regulated plasmid copy-
number increase in Yersinia. 
The plasmid replication initiation protein RepA initiates IncFII plasmid replication. The level of 
RepA is controlled at the translational level by the antisense RNA CopA (19). To investigate if 
the IncFII replicon per se is responsible for increased virulence plasmid copy-number, we 
expressed the Yersinia copA (20) under control of the yopE promoter. This should increase CopA 
levels, and consequently, reduce the rate of initiation of virulence plasmid replication under 
T3SS-inducing conditions. This construct was integrated in cis into the virulence plasmids of 
wild-type Yersinia and a ΔyopD mutant. CopA overexpression resulted in reduced plasmid copy-
numbers under T3SS-inducing conditions in both strains (Fig 1D). This shows that the IncFII 
replicon, per se, is essential for the T3SS regulated copy-number increase. Furthermore, the 
reduced plasmid copy-number in the CopA-overexpressing strains suppressed T3SS-related 
growth defects and reduced Yop-expression under T3SS-induced conditions (Fig S2, Fig 1D 
insert). This indicates that Yersinia has evolved a T3SS-dependent mechanism to down-regulate 
the copy-number of its virulence plasmid, likely to counteract the metabolic burden associated 
with induction of the T3SS.
 To investigate whether increased plasmid copy-number is involved in virulence, we designed a 
mutant strain that could not change virulence plasmid copy-number during infection. This was 
achieved by inserting pIBX, without the replication function (IncFII-), into the chromosome of Y. 
pseudotuberculosis (Fig 2A). The final mutant, YpIII:(cIBX)n=1, contained one copy of the 
replication-deficient pIBX inserted into the chromosomal gene YPK_3687 (Fig 2A). YPK_3687 
was previously shown to be redundant for Y. pseudotuberculosis virulence (21). Insertion of a 
single copy of the replication-deficient pIBX plasmid, (cIBX)n=1, into YPK_3687 was verified by 
DNA-sequencing and qPCR (Fig 2B and S3). As expected, the mutant strain was unable to 
change the gene-dose of plasmid-encoded genes in response to T3SS activity (Fig S3). Secretion 
analysis showed that YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 retained temperature- and Ca2+-dependent regulation of 
Yop-expression and secretion, but Yop levels were severely reduced by comparison with wild-
type (Fig 2C). Yop-translocation experiments showed that YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 could translocate the 
reporter protein, YopH1-99-Bla (22), into HeLa-cells, in a dose dependent manner, but less than 
the parental YPIII/pIBX wild-type strain (Fig 3A). Importantly, the YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 mutant was 
severely attenuated in an oral BALB/c mouse infection model. YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 initially colonized 
Peyer’s-patches (PP), cecum, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN, Fig 3B and S4) but all 
infected mice survived and recovered their initial body weight (Fig 3B insert), showing that the 
YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 strain is avirulent. 
To confirm if the reduced virulence of YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 was a result of a reduced gene-dose of 
virulence-plasmid encoded genes, we amplified the integrated virulence plasmid in the mutant. 
This was achieved by selecting for a gene-dose dependent increase in chloramphenicol resistance 
conferred by the cat gene encoded by the integrated construct (Fig 2A) (23, 24). Amplification of 
the cat gene was possible through homologous recombination of the duplicated (831 bp) 
 YPK_3687 sequences flanking the integrated IncFII- pIBX plasmid (Fig 2A). When YpIII:
(cIBX)n=1 was plated on to agar plates with different chloramphenicol concentrations, we 
recovered clones resistant to 150 μg/ml chloramphenicol at a frequency of 1  10-6 and found 
duplication of the integrated virulence plasmid. After initial duplication, further amplification 
was achieved after selection on plates with 300 μg/ml chloramphenicol at a frequency of 1 x 10-4. 
As expected, in the absence of selective pressure (23), the amplified virulence plasmid-
containing clones were unstable and reverted to the original single-copy genotype at a frequency 
of 2  10-1. These revertants showed the same phenotype as the original YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 variant.
A clone with three copies of the plasmid (YpIII:(cIBX)n=3) was selected for further analysis of 
T3SS function and virulence. We verified the high- and low-copy genotypes of YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 
and YpIII:(cIBX)n=3, respectively, by whole-genome sequencing and qPCR (Fig 2B and S3). 
YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 showed Yop-expression, secretion and translocation profiles similar to those of 
the wild-type strain (Fig 2C and 3A). While the YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 strain showed a similar growth 
rate as the plasmid cured YpIII (T3SS-) strain, the YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 strain showed reduced growth 
at 37°C under T3SS-induced conditions similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig S5). 
Importantly, YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 was virulent in an oral BALB/c mouse infection model (Fig 3B). All 
infected mice developed a systemic infection and were consequently euthanized. Bacterial loads 
2 days after infection were 100-fold higher in homogenized PPs from animals infected with 
virulent YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 compared with those infected with avirulent YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 (Fig S4). 
The high- and low-copy genotypes of bacterial strains were retained after passage through the 
mouse. YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 colonies recovered from PPs, MLNs, and cecum 2 days after infection 
showed variable numbers of virulence plasmid equivalents (Fig 3C). Remarkably, several 
isolated colonies possessed greater plasmid equivalents than the original three, indicating that the 
 integrated plasmid was under selective pressure for further amplification. Collectively, the 
observed gene-dose dependent virulence of YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 and YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 indicates that 
plasmid copy-number amplification is essential for Yersinia virulence. 
To determine whether the plasmid copy-number increases during infection, we isolated total 
DNA from PPs of mice after infection with wild-type YpIII/pIBX. The copy-number of pIBX 
was determined by whole genome DNA-sequencing and qPCR in the complex DNA sample. 
Both independent methods showed a six-fold increase in virulence plasmid copy-number in the 
PPs compared with the infecting inoculum (Fig 4A). Increased virulence plasmid copy-number 
during infection was verified by qPCR of lysates prepared from animal tissues recovered at 
different times after oral infections with wild-type YPIII/pIBX (Fig 4B). We observed substantial 
increases in virulence plasmid copy-numbers in all infected samples analyzed. 
It has been shown that reduced ratios of copA antisense RNA compared to repA mRNA leads to 
elevated RepA levels and thus to an increase in plasmid replication initiation (19). Analysis of 
copA and repA transcript levels in Yersinia during infection showed that the ratio of copA and 
repA RNA decreased significantly during PP colonization compared to bacteria grown in vitro 
(Fig 4C), corroborating the findings presented above. Our results show that the T3SS related 
copy-number regulation affects the stability or transcription of both RNA species (Table S2, Fig. 
S6). Importantly, considering the actual gene dose of plasmid-encoded genes under the different 
conditions, we found that the major change was a marked decrease in copA levels while the repA 
mRNA levels per plasmid copy remained basically unchanged (Table S2, Fig. S6). This favors a 
model where the T3SS related copy-number regulation operates via a change in the copA 
antisense RNA levels.
 In summary, we show that increased gene-dose of plasmid-encoded genes is essential for 
Yersinia virulence. One copy of the virulence plasmid that encodes the T3SS-regulon is 
insufficient to establish a systemic infection in mice; thus, Yersinia has evolved a mechanism to 
rapidly increase the copy-number during an infection. Our results also show that, despite the 
increased metabolic burden caused by three T3SS-regulon copies, during infection, there was 
selective pressure to increase the T3SS gene-dose. Moreover, the secreted protein, YopD, is 
involved in regulation of the copy-number. This feature indicates that the system is tightly 
controlled, linking external sensors to T3SS activity and the plasmid copy-number. 
In Yersinia, high T3SS activity is deleterious for growth in vitro. Yet, T3SS expression is 
essential for successful infection and proliferation in hosts. We found an inverse correlation 
between virulence plasmid gene-dose and growth rate under T3SS induced conditions. 
Therefore, we propose that Yersinia maintains the entire T3SS virulence system in a plasmid, 
which enables rapid adjustments in T3SS expression in response to prevailing environmental 
conditions. This basic regulatory tactic is likely to apply to any plasmid-encoded genes by 
analogous mechanisms. Our findings provide a framework for further functional investigations 
of the regulatory pathways that allows pathogens to respond to environmental cues and may be 
important in bacterial antibiotic resistance.

Growth conditions and growth curves
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S3. Yersinia 
pseudotuberculosis and Escherichia coli strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) 
broth or agar at 26°C for Y. pseudotuberculosis strains and 37°C for E. coli strains supplemented 
with appropriate antibiotics (Kanamycin (Km) 50 μg/ml, Chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 μg/ml and 
Carbenicillin (Cb) 50 μg/ml), unless otherwise stated. For T3SS induction experiments, 
overnight Y. pseudotuberculosis cultures were inoculated in fresh LB (1:20) supplemented with 
20 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM CaCl2 (T3SS repressed conditions, +Ca2+) or 5 mM EGTA (T3SS 
induced conditions, -Ca2+) followed by 1 hour incubation at 26°C before shifting the cultures to 
37°C. 
Growth curves were obtained from 2 independent bacterial cultures assayed in duplicates. 
Bacteria were grown overnight at 26°C in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) and were thereafter 
inoculated in fresh BHI (1:400) supplemented with 20 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM sodium oxalate (-
Ca2+, T3SS induced conditions). The cultures were grown 1 hour at 26°C before two 100 μl 
aliquots of each culture were distributed in 96 well clear bottom assay plates (Costar). The plate 
was assayed at 37°C using a TECAN Infinite F200 micro-plate reader (TECAN) by measuring 
OD595 every 10 min with 20 seconds orbital shaking before each measurement.
DNA techniques
Total DNA (both genomic and plasmid DNA) from bacterial cells and infected tissues was 
purified using GeneJet Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific). Bacterial DNA was 
enriched in total DNA samples from infected tissues using a NEBnext Microbiome DNA 
Enrichment Kit (New England Biolabs). Y. pseudotuberculosis virulence plasmids were extracted 
using alkaline lysis methods (25). Pure virulence plasmid preparations were isolated using 
standard CsCl2 gradient centrifugation methods. For qPCR analysis, total DNA lysates of 
bacterial cells and infected mouse tissues were prepared using a mericon DNA Bacteria Kit 
(Qiagen). The concentration of dsDNA was determined using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer according 
to manufacturer’s recommendations (Thermo Scientific).
Mutant construction
Two DNA fragments flanked by SphI sites (pUCpyopE-copA and pUCΔoriR1-sacB) were 
purchased from GenScript USA (Fig. S7). The 860 bp fragment in pUCpyopE-copA included 560 
bp encoding yerA (sycE) and the yopE promoter sequence fused to a 288 bp fragment starting 
with the reported copA-antisense RNA start site (21) and downstream sequence encoding 
putative termination sequences (Fig. S7A). The 4497 kb fragment in pUCΔoriR1-sacB included 
831 bp of the YPK_3687 gene, a 798 bp fragment starting 1107 bp downstream of the pIBX repA 
stop codon, a 2001 bp fragment encoding the Bacillus subtillis sacB gene, and a 837 bp fragment 
starting 1453 bp upstream of the pIBX repA start codon (Fig. S7B). The fragments were excised 
with SphI and ligated into pNQ705 (26), giving pNQpyopE-copA and pNQΔoriR1-sacB 
respectively. 
The pNQpyopE-copA suicide plasmid was introduced into wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis 
(YpIII/pIBX) and ΔyopD Y. pseudotuberculosis (YpIII/pIB621) by conjugation using standard 
techniques. Cmr and Kmr YpIII/pIBX-pyopE-copA and YpIII/pIB621-pyopE-copA clones 
 resulting from integration of pNQpyopE-copA into the yerA (sycE) locus in the respective 
virulence plasmids, were isolated on Yersinia selective (CIN) agar plates. The mutants were re-
streaked on selective LA-plates and verified by PCR and sequencing.
pNQΔoriR1-sacB was integrated into the pIBX virulence plasmid using the same procedure 
presented in the previous section. SacB counter-selection of the resulting sacB+, Cmr and Kmr 
YpIII/pIBX:pNQΔoriR1-sacB strain on agar plates containing 10 % sucrose, 50 μg/ml Km, and 
25 μg/ml Cm, recovered SacB-, Cmr and Kmr Yersinia clones where pIBX (lacking 3426 bp 
encoding the IncFII replicon) fused to pNQ705, had been integrated into the YPK_3687 gene in 
the YpIII chromosome (Fig 2A). The final clone (YpIII:(cIBX)n=1) was verified by PCR and 
sequencing. Proper integration of pIBX (IncFII-) into the chromosome in YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 was 
further verified by loss of pIBX after purification of the plasmid using alkaline lysis.
Amplification of the pIBX (IncFII-) amplicon in the chromosome by chloramphenicol selection 
Overnight YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 cultures were diluted 1:20 in fresh LB and grown at 26°C for 3 
hours. Serial, 10-fold dilutions of the culture were plated on LA plates with 50 μg/ml Km and 
increasing concentrations of Cm (25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 μg/ml). The plates were 
incubated at 26°C for 48 hours followed by counting of recovered colonies. The relative number 
of virulence plasmid equivalents compared to the chromosome in recovered colonies was 
determined by qPCR. The pIBX (IncFII-) duplication frequency was calculated from the number 
of colonies appearing on LA plates with 150 μg/ml Cm after 48 hours incubation, compared to 
total bacteria plated. The procedure was repeated on duplicated clones after the first round of 
selection giving the frequency for further amplification. The genotype of YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 and 
YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 was verified by whole-genome sequencing and qPCR.
The gene-dose of the integrated pIBX (IncFII-) amplicon correlated with the recorded 
bioluminescence of individual colonies due to increased lux-operon copies encoded by the 
integrated construct. 48 hours after plating Y. pseudotuberculosis strains with multiple copies of 
the chromosomally integrated plasmid on non-selective LA plates, the reversion rate was 
determined by counting the number of bioluminescent colonies exhibiting low, YpIII:(cIBX)n=1 
levels of bioluminescence after exposure with a Chemidoc Darkbox (Bio-Rad). The low, single 
copy genotype of the colonies was verified using qPCR. 
Yop expression and secretion experiments
Overnight Y. pseudotuberculosis cultures were diluted 1:20 in fresh LB with 20 mM MgCl2 
and 5 mM EGTA (T3SS induced conditions, -Ca2+). The cultures were incubated 1 hour at 26°C 
before shifting the cultures to 37°C. Aliquots were extracted at the indicated times. Whole-cell 
samples were prepared from the bacterial culture, and samples containing secreted proteins were 
prepared from bacteria-free supernatants recovered after centrifugation. The samples were 
separated by 12 % SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobillon PVDF membranes (Millipore) and 
probed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against Yop proteins. The final blots were 
developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, GE-healthcare).
β-lactamase translocation experiments
HeLa-cells (2 x 104) were seeded in DMEM lacking Phenol Red (Gibco) supplemented with 
10 % fetal calf serum (FCS) in μCLEAR 96-well black chimney well plates (Greiner) one day 
before experiments. Overnight cultures of YopH1-99-Bla expressing Y. pseudotuberculosis strains 
(YpIII/pIBX, YpIII:(cIBX)n=1, YpIII:(cIBX)n=3, and YpIII/pIB219) carrying pET101yopH99-bla 
were diluted 1:100 in fresh DMEM lacking Phenol Red with 10 % FCS and grown at 26°C for 2 
 hours before infection. The amount of bacteria present in the cultures was determined by OD600 
measurements and the bacteria were diluted and added to the cultured HeLa-cells at the indicated 
multiplicity of infection (MOI). The infections were ended by adding Gentamicin to a final 
concentration of 25 μg/ml before labeling the cells with CCF2-AM loading solution 
(LiveBLAzer FRET-B/G Loading Kit, Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml 
Probenecid (Molecular Probes) for 2 hours at room temperature. Translocation of YopH1-99-Bla 
was determined by measuring the cleavage of the FRET substrate CCF2-AM by translocated 
YopH1-99-β-lactamase fusion protein at wavelengths 409/520 nm (green) and 409/450 nm (blue) 
employing a Tecan infinite M200 (TECAN). The response ratio was calculated by dividing the 
recorded blue to green ratio in the infected wells by the average negative ratio recorded from 
CCF2-AM labeled uninfected HeLa-cells. Images of the cells were also acquired by Live cell 
imaging microscopy (Nikon Eclipse Ti-E) using a Nikon DS-2Fi color camera, a 20 × objective, 
and a filter with 405/20 nm excitation, 425 nm dichroic mirror, 435 nm (long-pass) emission, 
designed specifically for visualization of the CCF2-AM reaction (Chroma, USA). The MOIs of 
the infections were verified by viable counts of diluted infecting cultures after each experiment.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) 
Y. pseudotuberculosis cells (~108 cells) were harvested by centrifugation 6,000 x g for 5 min 
at 4°C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of Fast Lysis Buffer from a mericon DNA 
Bacteria Kit (Qiagen). For isolation of bacterial DNA from infected mouse tissues, the organs 
were homogenized in 1 ml pre-cooled PBS using a Dispomix drive homogenizer (Medic Tools, 
Switzerland). Tissue homogenates were cleared by centrifugation 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4°C. 
Total DNA lysates were prepared using mericon DNA Bacteria Kit (Qiagen) for Gram-negative 
bacteria according to the manufacture’s instructions. 
Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed using an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR detection 
System (Bio-Rad) with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). After amplification, a melting 
curve analysis was performed to confirm the specificity of the reaction. Samples were analyzed 
with three different specific genomic DNA primer pairs and two specific plasmid primer pairs 
(Table S4). Plasmid copy number was defined as the ratio of plasmid DNA per chromosome, 
using the formula 2-∆CT, where ∆CT is the difference in threshold cycles between the plasmid 
gene and the chromosomal gene. 
Southern blot analysis 
A sample with 200 ng BamHI digested total DNA isolated from Y. pseudotuberculosis 
bacterial strains and increasing amounts of BamHI digested CsCl2 purified pIBX were separated 
on a 1 % agarose gel. The DNA was transferred to a Zeta-probe Blotting Membrane (Bio-Rad) 
using standard capillary DNA transfer. The DNA was fixed to the membrane by UV irradiation 
(Spectrolinker, Spectronics Corporation), and the membrane was hybridized with Rapid-Hyb 
Buffer (GE Healthcare) with indicated P32 labeled DNA probes (Random Primed DNA Labeling 
Kit, Roche) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The probes were PCR amplified 
using primers presented in Table S4. The washed membranes were exposed to a Storage 
Phosphor Screen (Molecular Dynamics) and visualized using a Typhoon FLA 9500 Biomolecular 
Imager (GE Healthcare). The signals were quantified using the Quantity One software package 
(Bio-Rad).
Whole genome sequencing and data analysis 
 Purified total DNA (1 μg) was fragmented using an Adaptive Focused Acoustics S220 
(Covaris). 350 bp, single indexed, paired-end DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using a 
TruSeq DNA PCR-free LT sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. The prepared TruSeq PCR-free DNA libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq 
DNA sequencing system with a 2 x 150 bp setup using a MiSeq Reagent kit V2 (300-cycles) 
(Illumina). 
For DNA samples isolated from Peyer’s Patches, library preparation was the same as 
described above. Clustering was done by “cBot” and samples were sequenced on HiSeq2500 
(HiSeq Control Software 2.2.58/RTA 1.18.64) with a 2 x 126 bp setup using “HiSeq SBS Kit v4” 
chemistry by Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) and National Genomic Infrastructure 
Sweden (NGI). The Bcl to FastQ conversion was performed using bcl2fastq-1.8.4 from the 
CASAVA software suite. The quality scale used is Sanger / phred33 / Illumina 1.8+.
Data analysis and Tracks generation were performed using the CLC Genomic Workbench 
(CLC bio, Qiagen). Sequences were aligned against Y. pseudotuberculosis sequences 
(NC_010465 for the YPIII chromosome and an in house pIB1 sequence for the plasmid). The 
plasmid copy number was calculated by dividing the average coverage of plasmid DNA with the 
average coverage of chromosomal DNA. 
Mouse infection and bioluminescent imaging
Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles river) were allowed to acclimate to the new 
environment for one week before the experiments. Mice were deprived of food and water for 16 
hours prior to oral infection with bioluminescent wild-type YpIII/pIBX, YpIII:(cIBX)n=1,  or 
YpIII:(cIBX)n=3 and monitored using IVIS Spectrum (Caliper LifeSciences). Bacteria grown 
overnight at 26°C were harvested and re-suspended at a concentration of 2 x 108 CFUs/ml in 
sterile tap-water supplemented with 150 mM NaCl. The bacterial suspensions were provided for 
6 hours as drinking water. The infection dose was determined by viable counts and drinking 
volume. Mice were inspected frequently for signs of infection, and mice showing prominent 
clinical signs were euthanized promptly to prevent suffering. Mice were monitored for 
bioluminescent emission using IVIS Spectrum (Caliper LifeSciences). Mice were anesthetized 
using the XGI-8 gas anesthesia system (Caliper LifeSciences) prior to imaging with 2.5% 
IsoFluVet in oxygen (Orion Pharma Abbott Laboratories Ltd, Great Britain), and during imaging 
in 0.5% IsoFluVet. Images were acquired and analyzed using Living Image 4.5 (Caliper 
LifeSciences). To analyze bacterial localization within organs, mice were euthanized, the 
intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen removed, and the organs imaged by 
bioluminescent imaging. Bacteria were isolated from infected organs after plating serial, 10-fold 
dilutions of organ-homogenates in PBS on LA plates with 50 μg/ml Km. 
Mice were housed in accordance with the Swedish National Board for Laboratory Animals 
guidelines. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Umeå 
University (Dnr A144-12). 
RNA isolation from bacterial cultures
Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 was grown in LB broth to stationary growth phase (16 
hours; OD600 of approx. 4.0) at 25°C or 37°C. Total bacterial RNA was isolated via a column-free 
hot phenol RNA extraction protocol (27). Remaining traces of DNA were digested with TURBO 
DNase (Ambion). The RNA was purified once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and 
twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and recovered via ethanol precipitation. RNA integrity 
 was assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent 
Technologies). From 8 µg of high quality total RNA (RIN ≥ 9) ribosomal RNA was depleted 
using the MICROBExpress bacterial mRNA Enrichment Kit (Ambion). 1 µg rRNA depleted 
RNA was treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP; Epicentre Biotechnologies) as 
recommended by the manufacturer.  
Infection of mice for in vivo RNA-seq
Female BALB/c mice aged 7-8 weeks were purchased from Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle, 
St Berthevin Cedex, France) and housed in individually ventilated cages under specific 
pathogen-free conditions. Animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the 
German Recommendations of the Society of Laboratory Animal Science (GV-SOLAS) and the 
European Health Recommendations of the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science 
Associations (FELASA). The animal protocols were approved by the Niedersächsisches 
Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit: animal licensing committee 
permission no. 33.9.42502-04-12/1010. Animals were handled with appropriate care and all 
efforts were made to minimize suffering. Animals were provided with food and water ad libitum; 
14 hours prior to infection food was removed and provided again immediately after the infection. 
Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 was grown 16 hours overnight in LB broth at 25°C, washed 
and resuspended in 1xPBS. Three groups of five weight-matched mice were infected 
intragastrically using a gavage needle with approx. 2×108 CFUs of Y. pseudotuberculosis. All 
mice were monitored daily to determine the body weight and health status. At day 3 after 
infection, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Peyer’s patches were excised aseptically 
and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
RNA isolation from Peyer’s Patches
For column-free total RNA isolation from Peyer’s patches a modified version of earlier 
described protocols was applied (28, 29). Snap frozen Peyer’s patches were transferred to sterile 
plastic tubes (Greiner) containing pre-cooled 1.5 ml of a solution containing 4 M guanidinium 
thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% (wt/vol) N-laurosylsarcosine, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol 
(Solution D) and immediately homogenized on ice at 11,000 rpm for 10 seconds using a Polytron 
PT 2100 homogenizer (Kinematica, Switzerland). After homogenization, 0.5 ml aliquots of 
tissue lysate were rapidly transferred to previously cooled 2 ml reaction tubes containing 100 mg 
of small (100 µm) and big (1 mm) acid washed glass beads (Sigma Aldrich). Bead-beating was 
performed using a TissueLyser (Qiagen) at fixed speed (30 Hz) for 1 min. Between bead-beating 
steps, samples were cooled on ice for 1 min. 0.5 ml of lysate was transferred to a new reaction 
tube prior addition of 50 µl of 2 M sodium acetate pH 4.0 and 500 µl water-saturated phenol and 
mixed thoroughly by inversion. After addition of 100 µl chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, samples 
were mixed vigorously by hand, cooled on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 10.000 g for 20 min 
at 4°C. The supernatant was washed twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. Total RNA was 
recovered via ethanol precipitation. DNA was digested using TURBO DNase (Ambion) as 
described by the manufacturer. The RNA was purified once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl 
alcohol and twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and recovered via ethanol precipitation. RNA 
integrity was assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer 
(Agilent Technologies). High quality RNA (RIN ≥ 9) from Peyer’s Patches of 5 mice were 
combined in equal amounts to one RNA pool. From 3 independent RNA pools mouse rRNA was 
depleted using the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal kit (Illumina). Prior TAP-treatment, 1 µl of 
 either 1:10 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 or Mix 2 (Ambion) were added to 1 µg 
of mouse rRNA depleted RNA. TAP treatment was performed as recommended by the 
manufacturer.
Strand-specific cDNA library preparation and deep sequencing
RNA adapter based strand-specific cDNA library preparation and deep sequencing 
(Illumina HiSeq2500) was performed as described earlier (20). Quality of the sequencing output 
was analyzed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics). Libraries were mapped to the IP32953 
genome (NC_006155) and the pYV plasmid (accessions NC_006153) using Bowtie2 (version 
2.1.0) with default parameters. After read mapping, SAMtools was employed to filter the 
resulting bam files for uniquely mapped reads (both strands). The high-throughput read data is 
deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with the accession no PRJEB14242.
Statistics
All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Statistical differences were 
analysed by Mann-Whitney nonparametric test or Student’s unpaired t-test as indicated, with the 
significance set at *P≤0.05, **P≤0.01, and ***P≤0.001. Data are presented as the mean ± 
S.E.M..
