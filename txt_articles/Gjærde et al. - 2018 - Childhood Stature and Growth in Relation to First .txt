Background and Purpose—Attained height, an indicator of genetic potential and childhood growth environment, is inversely 
associated with stroke, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated whether childhood height and growth 
are associated with ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
Methods—In a cohort of Danish schoolchildren born 1930 to 1989, with measured height from 7 to 13 years, we investigated 
associations of childhood stature and growth with risks of adult IS and ICH. Cox proportional hazards regressions were 
performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with CIs separately for women and men.
Results—Among 311 009 individuals, 10 412 were diagnosed with IS and 2546 with ICH. Height at 7 years was inversely 
and significantly associated with IS in both sexes (per z score, equivalent to ≈5.2 cm in women and 5.1 cm in men; 
women: HR=0.89 [95% CI: 0.87–0.92]; men: HR=0.90 [95% CI: 0.88–0.92]) and with ICH in men (HR=0.89 [95% 
CI: 0.84–0.94]) but not in women (HR=0.97 [95% CI: 0.91–1.04]). Associations were similar at older childhood ages 
and were stable throughout the study period. No statistically significant associations for growth from 7 to 13 years were 
observed for IS or ICH.
Conclusions—Short stature at 7 to 13 years is significantly associated with increased risks of IS in both sexes and with 
ICH in men. Growth during this period of childhood is not significantly associated with either of these stroke subtypes, 
suggesting that underlying mechanisms linking height with risks of stroke may exert their influence already by early 
childhood.

T
he global burden of stroke will increase in the future,1,2 and 
identifying disease mechanisms that improve possibilities 
of primary stroke prevention is essential. In most high-income 
countries, a decline in stroke incidence and mortality rates, 
which were mainly observed in women,3 occurred simultane-
ously with a general increase in attained adult height. Taken 
together, this suggests the involvement of shared underlying 
mechanisms for height growth and stroke disease develop-
ment.4 Adult stature is inversely associated with stroke,5–7 
particularly intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)6; the Emerging 
Risk Factors Collaboration, including >1 million participants, 
found that per 6.5-cm increase in adult height, the risk of 
dying from ischemic stroke (IS) and ICH was reduced by 6% 
and 10%, respectively.7 Although short stature has associa-
tions with the risk of stroke that are nearly as strong as for 
body mass index, studies investigating growth, as opposed to 
weight gain, have been neglected.8,9
A potential explanation is that it is not possible to intervene 
on adult height, and the effects of doing so in childhood are 
uncertain. However, in addition to being genetically deter-
mined, adult height is a marker of exposures affecting child-
hood growth (eg, maternal diet during pregnancy, childhood 
diet, infection, and psychological stress), of which many are 
modifiable and all are thought to affect the risk of stroke.6 The 
decline in stroke incidence and mortality rates may thus not 
only be explained by enhanced management of stroke risk 
factors and stroke treatment but also by improved growth-
promoting childhood conditions.
Studies that investigated associations of childhood stature 
with later stroke are few and small in size (maximum of 507 
total stroke cases)10–12 with one also investigating the effect of 
growth in infancy11 and another also investigating growth later 
in childhood.10 None of these studies investigated men and 
women separately, and the youngest participants included in 
these studies were born in 1944, thus their results may not be 
generalizable to the children of today. Investigating height and 
especially growth during childhood, across a longer period of 
time in the 20th century where average height increased, may

provide insights into the complex height-related mechanisms 
underlying stroke. We hypothesized that short stature and poor 
childhood growth are associated with increased risks of IS and 
potentially even stronger increased risks of ICH and that the 
strength of the associations has attenuated over time because 
of the increase in average height. Therefore, in a cohort of 
children born from 1930 to 1989, we investigated associations 
of childhood stature and growth with first IS or ICH in women 
and men separately.
Materials and Methods
The data that support the findings of this study are available from the 
corresponding author on reasonable request and pending approval by 
the data steering committee.
We studied a cohort of 372 636 children from the Copenhagen 
School Health Records Register.13 The children were born from 
1930 to 1989 and attended public or private schools in Copenhagen. 
Information from mandatory health examinations, which were per-
formed annually until 1983 and thereafter at school entry and exit, 
has been computerized. In April 1968, all Danish residents were 
assigned a unique identification number, and it was recorded on every 
child’s health card from this date or subsequently retrieved for chil-
dren who left school before this time.
We used information on height from ages 7 to 13 years, which 
was measured without shoes at health examinations by trained 
school physicians and nurses using standardized procedures. Height 
was transformed into z scores based on internal age-, sex-, and birth 
cohort (5-year intervals)–specific references to account for secular 
increases in height. Unless a measurement was taken at the exact 
age, the z score was interpolated or extrapolated within a ±12-month 
period. Absolute height was based on back-transformed z scores to 
get a value as close to exact age as possible.
The identification number was used to link to the Danish National 
Hospital Register,14 which was established in 1977, and the Danish 
Cause of Death Register15 (computerized since 1970) for data on first 
IS or ICH. Stroke was defined by the 8th revision of the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes until 1994 and the 10th revi-
sion thereafter: IS (ICD-8, 433, 434; ICD-10, I63), ICH (ICD-8, 
431; ICD-10, I61), and unspecified stroke (ICD-8, 436; ICD-10, 
I64). Information on vital status was obtained from the computerized 
Danish Civil Registration System.
Our starting population consisted of individuals with an iden-
tification number and who were at least 25 years of age on study 
entry. Follow-up began in 1977, when the Danish National Hospital 
Register was established, and ended on the date of first-ever stroke 
diagnosis, of death, of emigration, of loss to follow-up, or December 
31, 2013, whichever came first. We excluded individuals if they had 
an outlying measurement of height and body mass index (as a quality 
control)or lacked data on height and body mass index at all childhood 
ages, or if they had a stroke diagnosis before 25 years (Figure I in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. 
According to Danish law, ethical approval is not required for purely 
register-based research.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the change in average height between 7 and 13 years 
during the study period by subtracting the mean height of individuals 
from the oldest birth cohort (born 1930–1934) from the mean height 
of individuals from the youngest birth cohort (born 1980–1988). 
Thereafter, we investigated the association of height, using z scores 
and absolute height, at ages 7 to 13 years with IS and ICH, respec-
tively, using Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the 
underlying time axis separately for each sex. Statistical significance 
was set at a P<0.05, and all tests were 2 sided.
The linearity of the associations was tested against a restricted 
cubic spline with 5 knots, and we found no deviations from linearity 
(all P>0.10) for IS. For associations with ICH in men, but not in 
women, we found limited indications of deviations from linearity 
(all P>0.06, except for height at 8, 9, and 12 years, with P values 
of 0.03, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively). Therefore, we also conducted 
a categorical analysis using quintiles of height as exposure. The 
assumption of proportional hazards was tested by stratifying the 
analyses into quartiles of age at diagnosis and using time varying 
coefficients. Furthermore, we used the Nelson-Aalen estimator to 
investigate whether an inflection point (a change in the association) 
occurred at a specific age. We tested whether the height–stroke asso-
ciations differed by birth cohort using the likelihood ratio test (all 
P>0.05 for interactions between childhood height and birth cohort in 
a model stratified by age at diagnosis for IS and a nonstratified model 
for ICH). All analyses were conducted separately for women and 
men although we only found limited indications of interactions by 
sex (all P values using the likelihood ratio test >0.08, except height 
at 7 years and ICH [P=0.03]).
In a subsample of individuals with height measurements at 7 and 
13 years, we conducted growth analyses that were adjusted for base-
line height at 7 years. Assumptions of proportional hazards were 
investigated as were birth cohort effects.
In a sensitivity analysis of the associations between height and IS, 
unclassified stroke was included in the outcome because >60% of the 
unclassified strokes in Denmark are ischemic.16
Results
Study Population
The study included 311 009 individuals (49% women). Girls 
were an average of 1 cm shorter than boys until 11 years at 
which point the height difference disappeared (Table 1). By 
12 to 13 years, the girls were an average of 1.5 cm taller than 
boys. During the study period, average height increased by 
4.1 and 4.2 cm at 7 years and by 7.3 and 8.8 cm at 13 years, in 
girls and boys, respectively. The average growth (SD) between 
7 and 13 years was lower among individuals from the old-
est birth cohort (women: 32.0 [3.7] cm; men: 29.8 [3.6] cm) 
compared with the most recent birth cohort (women: 35.5 
[3.9] cm; men: 34.4 [5.1] cm). Follow-up was from 25 years 
through 83 years with a median duration of 31.1 years. During 
this period, 5313 women and 7645 men were diagnosed with 
a first-ever IS (80.4%) or ICH (19.6%). Incidence rates for IS 
and ICH increased with age in both sexes. For IS, the rate was 
higher in men than women until 75 years, after which the rate 
rapidly increased in women (Figure 1). The incidence rate for 
ICH was higher in men at all ages. The majority of IS events 
were diagnosed at 55 to 75 years. For ICH, the proportion of 
cases were more evenly distributed at ages <75 years (Table I 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Childhood Height and IS
In both sexes, we found inverse linear associations between 
childhood height and IS. Because the pattern of the asso-
ciations was similar across all childhood ages, we present 
results for 7, 10, and 13 years (Figure 2; see other ages in 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Already at 7 
years, a 1 z score increase in height was associated with an 
11% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.89; 95% CI [0.87–0.92]) reduced 
risk of IS in women and a 10% (HR=0.90; 95% CI [0.88–
0.92]) reduced risk in men. To put this into perspective, a 1 
z score difference, despite being birth cohort specific, cor-
responds to ≈5.2 cm in girls and 5.1 cm in boys at 7 years

(10 years: 6.3 cm in girls and 6.1 cm in boys; 13 years: 
7.0 cm in girls and 8.1 cm in boys). When examining the 
risk of IS within quintiles of absolute height at 7 years, it 
seemed to be the increased risk among shortest individuals 
that was responsible for the inverse association as opposed 
to a lower risk among tallest individuals (Table 2). The asso-
ciations did not differ between the sexes and were consis-
tent across all childhood ages and birth cohorts both when 
using z scores and absolute height. There were some indi-
cations of an attenuation of the inverse associations with 
age at diagnosis, but there was not a distinct age at which 
the associations changed. We, therefore, present the overall 
inverse association (see age-specific estimates in Table III in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
In the sensitivity analysis including 7286 IS (41% women) 
and 8159 unclassified (41% women) strokes combined, we 
found inverse associations of childhood height with IS plus 
unclassified stroke in both sexes (Tables IV and Table V in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The patterns of the associations 
were similar to those when only IS was used as the outcome.

Childhood Height and ICH
As with IS, the pattern of associations between height and 
ICH was similar across childhood ages (Figure 2; Table I in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Among women, childhood 
height was weakly and inversely associated with ICH, whereas 
in men, the association was inverse. In addition, individuals in 
the lowest height quintiles appeared to have a higher risk of 
ICH compared with risk of IS (Table 2). Moreover, the inverse 
association between childhood height and ICH was stable 
across birth cohorts and did not change with age at diagnosis 
(all P>0.07 for an interaction between age at diagnosis and 
childhood height).
Growth in Relation to IS and ICH
In the 252 146 women and men with height available at 7 and 
13 years, we investigated whether growth was associated with 
either IS or ICH. In both sexes, we found limited evidence for 
associations between growth from 7 to 13 years (expressed 
per 0.5 z score change) and IS (women: HR=1.03, 95% CI 
[1.00–1.66]; men: HR=1.02, 95% CI [0.99–1.50]) or ICH 
(women: HR=0.98, 95% CI [0.92–1.04]; men: HR=0.99, 95% 
CI [0.94–1.05]).
Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study, we found that 
height at 7 through 13 years was inversely associated with 
IS in both sexes and with ICH in men. Growth was not sig-
nificantly associated with either stroke subtype. Moreover, 
the inverse associations remained stable throughout the study 
period even though the average height among the children 
increased substantially.
Short childhood stature was also associated with increased 
risk of stroke in 2 smaller Finnish studies10,11 investigating 
this relationship as well as in the Boyd Orr cohort12 from the 
UK where inverse associations between childhood height and 
leg length, which is a measure of prepubertal growth, were 
observed. However, these studies were limited by a small 
number of cases (507, 331, and 92 cases of total stroke, 
respectively), impeding their possibilities of making sex- and 
stroke subtype–specific analysis.
Our results primarily have implications for understand-
ing disease pathogenesis rather than for clinical risk pre-
diction. Attained adult height is an indicator of growth 
conditions during childhood, timing of puberty, and genetic 
height potential.17–19 Although we found strong inverse 
associations between height already at 7 years and IS in 
both sexes, as well as with ICH in men, we observed lim-
ited indications of childhood growth being associated with 
these 2 stroke subtypes. This suggests that the main effects 
of height on stroke are initiated before 7 years, already 
well before entering puberty. In contrast with our findings, 
the earlier mentioned 2 Finnish studies reported a positive 
trend for change in height from 7 to 15 years among men 
who developed any kind of stroke,10 whereas growth from

2 to 11 years was not associated with total stroke among 
women and men.11 If accelerated growth in midchildhood 
is associated with stroke, it is expected that the strength of 
the inverse association between height and stroke would be 
weaker for adult height. This was investigated in the Boyd 
Orr cohort, where indications of a weaker inverse associa-
tion with self-reported adult height, compared with child-
hood height, was observed. We did not have information 
on adult height to investigate this hypothesis or to perform 
mediation analyses for the inverse childhood height–stroke 
association. It thus remains a possibility that a factor, such 
as pubertal timing, which affects midchildhood growth in 
a more complex way than what we were able to investigate 
in our study, could influence the associations between short 
childhood stature and risk of stroke.
It is well-known that height is positively associated with 
socioeconomic status (SES).6 SES, which represents expo-
sures to risk factors, health behaviors of the mother, and 
access to resources, has been found to be associated with 
stroke, especially low SES during childhood.20–22 The inverse 
association between adult height and stroke has, however, 
generally been robust to adjustments for SES.6 Although we 
found equally strong overall inverse associations of child-
hood stature with both IS and ICH among men, the categori-
cal analysis indicated that the risk of ICH was higher among 
the shortest quintiles of childhood height compared with the 
risk of IS. This is in line with the hypothesis of ICH having 
stronger links to poor nutrition and lower SES in childhood 
than IS which has been put forward in some previous stud-
ies on adult height.7,23–25 However, the sex differences in the 
associations of childhood stature with ICH argues against 
confounding by SES as SES in our population-based cohort 
is expected to be equally distributed among women and men 
(unless SES affects men and women differently in regards to 
this stroke subtype).
Unlike the 3 previous studies that investigated associa-
tions of childhood height with stroke in individuals born 
within a maximum of a 10-year period during the first half 
of the 20th century, we studied a more recent population 
born from 1930 to 1988, during which living circumstances, 
smoking patterns, alcohol consumption, preventive treat-
ment, and stroke care markedly changed. During the study 
period, we observed a significant increase in average child-
hood height, which is in line with what has been observed 
for average adult height in the general population,4 and 
thought to be a result of overall improved early-life growth 
conditions, such as access to food, dietary diversification, 
sanitation, living standards, and reductions in childhood 
infections.4,26 Both poor nutrition27 and infectious burden28 
have been found to be associated with risk of stroke. If it 
was these factors that were driving the inverse associations 
between childhood height and later stroke, we would expect 
the inverse associations to be weaker in the most recent birth 
cohorts, where nutrition conceivably was better and chronic 
childhood infections were less frequent. This is, however, 
not what we observed because we did not detect birth cohort 
effects, nor was it observed in the Emerging Risk Factor 
Collaboration study,7 where stronger inverse associations 
between adult height and risk of stroke were reported in 
more recent birth cohorts. Even though the relationship 
between SES and adult height may have changed little in 
recent decades,29,30 the stable inverse associations for both 
relative height (z scores) and absolute height across birth 
cohorts, despite an increase in average height, point toward 
a causal (ie, genetically determined) relationship between 
height and stroke because the pace of change in average 
height cannot be attributable to changes in the gene pool. 
The potential causal effect of adult height on stroke was 
investigated in a Mendelian Randomization study, where an 
allele score based on 69 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
associated with adult height, was used in an instrumental 
variable analysis applied in 17 prospective studies, includ-
ing 43 790 participants with 4878 stroke events.31 The study 
reported a null-effect for stroke, which remained unchanged 
after adjustment for cardiovascular traits (body mass index, 
blood pressure, lung function, lipids, and CRP [C-reactive 
protein]) that showed an association with the gene score for 
height, but the authors emphasized that the estimate from 
the analysis was imprecise and that a causal effect of height 
on stroke cannot be excluded by their findings.
It thus remains a possibility that childhood height is an 
indicator of other factors experienced during early life, maybe 
already in utero, expressing their effects on growth as well 
as stroke risk in adulthood which have not changed during 
our long study period. As some strokes occur relatively early 
in adult life, it is plausible that early-life exposures have a 
greater influence on stroke early in adulthood compared with 
stroke diagnosed later in life. We found some support for this 
hypothesis in the current study, in which we observed stron-
ger inverse associations of childhood height with IS diag-
nosed at earlier versus older ages. Moreover, in the Emerging 
Risk Factor Collaboration study, the inverse associations of 
height with stroke were not appreciably altered after adjust-
ment long-term smoking, adiposity, inflammation biomarkers, 
blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes mellitus, thus reducing the 
likelihood that these well-known adult risk factors are media-
tors of the inverse associations.
The major strengths of this study include the prospective 
study design with a long study period, mandatory height 
exams, multiple measures of height, among a large group 
of schoolchildren, thus minimizing the possibility of reverse 
causality. Moreover, we followed the children for an exten-
sive period of time with minimal loss to follow-up through 
the national registers. The coverage of each register is high, 
with virtually every event recorded.14,15 IS is recorded with 
a high degree of validity in the National Hospital Discharge 
Register (positive predictive value of >97%), whereas the 
diagnoses of ICH may be less accurate (positive predictive 
value of 74%).16 In the National Cause of Death Register, 
cardiovascular disease diagnoses are less precise.15 However, 
<5% of the cases in this study came only from that register. 
Moreover, the analyses of the combined end points of IS and 
unspecified stroke were in accordance with the results for 
IS only. However, there were some limitations as well. As 
previously mentioned, we were unable to compare the mag-
nitude of the inverse associations for childhood height with

corresponding measurements in adulthood, or to attempt to 
disentangle the independent effects of childhood measures 
versus adult measures on stroke risk. Finally, although height 
may be a proxy for SES, and thus a greater access to care 
and preventive treatment,6 this explanation is less plausible 
in a setting, such as Denmark, in which participants have had 
universal access to tax paid medical care and thus no direct 
payments for services.
Conclusions
In this large prospective study, shorter stature during child-
hood was associated with increased risks of IS in women 
and men and with ICH in men. In both sexes, growth during 
midchildhood was not associated with any of these stroke 
subtypes. The inverse associations were stable during the 
study period, in which average childhood height increased 
significantly. Our results support the potential role of early-
life exposures associated with growth before midchildhood 
in stroke genesis. Future studies should focus on the mecha-
nisms underlying the relationship between childhood height 
and later stroke.
