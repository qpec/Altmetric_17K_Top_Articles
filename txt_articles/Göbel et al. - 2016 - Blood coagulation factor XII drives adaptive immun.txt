Aberrant immune responses represent the underlying cause of central nervous system (CNS)
autoimmunity, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent evidence implicated the crosstalk
between coagulation and immunity in CNS autoimmunity. Here we identify coagulation factor
XII (FXII), the initiator of the intrinsic coagulation cascade and the kallikrein–kinin system,
as a specific immune cell modulator. High levels of FXII activity are present in the plasma of
MS patients during relapse. Deficiency or pharmacologic blockade of FXII renders mice less
susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a model of MS) and is
accompanied by reduced numbers of interleukin-17A-producing Tcells. Immune activation by
FXII is mediated by dendritic cells in a CD87-dependent manner and involves alterations in
intracellular cyclic AMP formation. Our study demonstrates that a member of the plasmatic
coagulation cascade is a key mediator of autoimmunity. FXII inhibition may provide a strategy
to combat MS and other immune-related disorders.

 A
utoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS),
such as multiple sclerosis (MS), are mediated by the
intimate
interplay
of
many
cellular
and
molecular
immune components1,2. It is widely accepted that autoreactive
T cells generated in the periphery migrate across the blood–brain
barrier (BBB), inducing disseminated inflammatory lesions
within the brain parenchyma, leading to demyelination. Recent
studies suggest that both interferon (IFN)-g- and interleukin
(IL)-17A-producing effector T-helper cells (TH1 and TH17,
respectively) contribute to inflammation and tissue damage in
the course of CNS autoimmunity3–5. Interaction of T cells with
dendritic
cells
(DCs),
professional
antigen-presenting
cells
(APCs), is crucial for T-cell differentiation6,7. Accumulation of
effector T cells in human brain lesions and subsequent increased
expression of cell-specific signature cytokines in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients also indicate a role of
autoreactive T cells in human MS8,9.
More recent evidence suggests that other factors not tradition-
ally considered components of the immune system might also be
involved in MS pathophysiology. In particular, blood coagulation
constituents, such as platelets, are thought to contribute to
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse
model of human MS10. Moreover, deposition of plasmatic
coagulation factors, such as fibrinogen, has been described in
human MS lesions11–13, and tissue factor and protein C inhibitor
have been identified within chronic active MS plaques14.
Although findings indicate a role of the extrinsic coagulation
system in EAE and MS, the function of the intrinsic coagulation
system remains unknown. The initiator of intrinsic coagulation is
factor XII (FXII; Hageman factor)15. FXII activation occurs
through the contact with negatively charged surfaces16, resulting
in activation of the intrinsic blood coagulation system and
subsequently fibrin clot formation15,17. FXII also triggers the
proinflammatory kallikrein–kinin system (KKS), which consists
of several sequentially linked serine proteases, with the peptide
hormone bradykinin (BK) being the end product. In addition,
FXII may interact with cell-surface-associated receptors, such as
the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (also designated
CD87)18.
As FXII is at the interface between inflammation and
coagulation, and has recently been identified as a major driving
force
during
ischaemic
neurodegeneration19,
we
therefore
investigated
its
role
in
autoimmunity
and
the
potential
underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, we assessed FXII
as a therapeutic target in different EAE models. We showed
that FXII drives pathologic adaptive immune reactions via
CD87-mediated modulation of DC.
Results
FXII-deficient mice are less susceptible to CNS inflammation.
To assess whether FXII is relevant during CNS autoimmunity
in vivo, we first analysed the plasma, lymph nodes (LNs) and the
inflamed CNS of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55
(MOG35–55)-immunized wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, FXII
levels were significantly increased in the plasma and LN on dis-
ease maximum of EAE (Fig. 1a). Despite these peripheral
alterations, extensive FXII depositions could also be found in the
inflamed CNS of immunized mice (Fig. 1a,b), implying a
potential contribution of FXII to EAE pathology.
To this end, we subjected FXII-deficient (F12 � / �) mice to
EAE. F12 � / � and WT control mice were immunized with
MOG35–55, and clinical scores were evaluated daily over a 35-day
period. FXII deficiency was associated with later disease onset and
reduced maximum disease severity (dmax) (Fig. 1c; Supplementary
Table 1). Inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination were less
prevalent in MOG35–55-immunized F12 � / � mice compared with
WT mice (Fig. 1d). While the distribution of different immune
cell subsets in spleens and LNs from F12 � / � and WT mice was
only slightly shifted under basal (that is, non-immunized, reduced
CD11c þ cells, increased forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) cells) and
MOG35–55-immunized
conditions
(Supplementary
Table
2;
Supplementary Fig. 1), FXII deficiency was associated with lower
relative numbers of CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells as well as CD11b þ
and
CD11c þ
cells
in
the
CNS
of
EAE
mice
at
dmax
(Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 2).
Importantly, reconstitution of F12 � / � animals with human
FXII fully restored the susceptibility to EAE (Fig. 1e), indicating
that the protective phenotype in EAE, due to FXII deficiency, can
be specifically attributed to the absence of FXII. To further test
whether FXII is involved in the priming or effector phase of EAE,
we performed adoptive transfer (AT)-EAE. Interestingly, WT and
F12 � / � animals that received F12 � / � LN cells developed
almost no signs of EAE. Similarly, F12 � / � mice receiving LN
cells from WT or F12 � / � mice were likewise protected from
AT-EAE, indicating that FXII impacts priming as well as the
effector mechanisms within the inflamed CNS (Fig. 1f).
FXII shifts immune cells towards a TH17 pattern. We next
evaluated the differentiation of immune cells on MOG35–55
immunization in an FXII-deficient or -proficient setting. To this
end, active EAE was induced in WT and F12 � / � animals. At day
10 (priming phase) and dmax (day 16) of EAE, the amount of
several transcription factor genes was determined in CD4 þ
T cells obtained from the LN or CNS infiltrates by real-time
reverse transcription–PCR (rRT–PCR). CD4 þ T cells of F12 � / �
animals displayed no significant difference in Tbx21 (coding for
Tbet; a TH1 marker) and in Gata3 transcripts (a TH2 marker), but
a significant decrease in retinoic acid receptor-related orphan
receptor C (Rorc) transcripts (encoding the TH17 specification
marker) and an increase in Foxp3 transcripts (a marker of
regulatory T cells (Treg)) at day 10 (Fig. 2a). No significant
changes were observed for any of these transcripts in CD4 þ T
cells at dmax (Fig. 2a). In line with the findings in the preclinical
phase of EAE, brain-infiltrating lymphocytes (BILs) of F12 � / �
animals displayed a similar pattern of Tbx21, Gata3, Rorc and
Foxp3 transcripts at dmax, as already shown for CD4 þ T cells at
day 10 (Fig. 2a). These data suggest a FXII-induced shift to a
TH17 signature in response to MOG35–55 immunization.
While proliferation of CD4þ T cells was unchanged in F12 � / �
mice compared with WT animals, FXII favoured TH17 cell
emergence as indicated by the cytokine profile (low IL-17A,
unaltered IFN-g, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b
from CD4 þ T cells within LN, and low IL-6, IL-23, unaltered
IL-10, IL-12, IL-27 and TGF-b from CD11c þ DC; Fig. 2b) and
by the number of IL-17A-producing CD4 þ T cells obtained from
LNs, as determined by flow cytometry in the preclinical phase
(day 10; Fig. 2c). The same signature could be found in the CNS
of EAE mice on dmax (low IL-6, IL-17A, IL-23, increased IL-27,
unaltered IFN-g, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-b and increased number
of IL-17A-producing lymphocytes, Fig. 2d,e), while peripheral
changes
were already
lost
(unaltered
number
of
IL-17A-
producing cells, Fig. 2f). Notably, the amount of IL-17A-
producing MOG35–55-activated CD4 þCD40 ligand (CD40L) þ
T cells obtained from draining LN was reduced in F12 � / � mice,
as compared with WT animals, while the number of IFN-g-
producing CD4 þCD40L þ T cells was unaltered, suggesting
that antigen-specific sensitization and priming of TH17 cells is
impaired in FXII deficiency (Supplementary Fig. 3).
FXII worsens EAE independently of the coagulation and KKS.
FXII can initiate both the proinflammatory KKS, resulting in BK

 release, and the intrinsic coagulation cascade, leading to fibrin
formation20. Although basal serum BK levels were lower when
FXII was
absent,
cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF)
BK
levels of
immunized F12 � / � animals were indistinguishable from those
of immunized WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Accordingly,
BK receptor 1 (B1R) or B2R expression levels in the inflamed
spinal cords from F12 � / � and WT mice did not differ on EAE
induction (Supplementary Fig. 4b). We recently showed that
blockade of B1R on endothelial cells reduces immune cell
invasion across the activated BBB in EAE21. We therefore
analysed the impact of FXII deficiency on the migratory capacity
of LN-derived immune cells in an in vitro transmigration assay,
using murine brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMECs)
from B1R-deficient or WT mice. The number of immune cells
crossing the MBMEC barrier did not differ significantly in either
group (Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Western blot analysis revealed that the amount of fibrin/
fibrinogen detectable in the CNS was similar between WT and
F12 � / � mice at dmax (Supplementary Fig. 4d). That the effects of
FXII in EAE were not mediated by the intrinsic coagulation
system was corroborated by the fact that deficiency of FXI, the
primary substrate of activated FXII during thrombus formation,
did
not
alter
the clinical
course,
demyelination,
immune
cell infiltration or cytokine levels in the course of EAE
(Supplementary Fig. 4e–g). Overall, these findings indicate that
the detrimental effects of FXII in autoimmune CNS inflammation
cannot be attributed to the KKS or plasmatic coagulation cascade
activation.
Another
pathway,
which
is
triggered
by
FXII,
is
the
complement system15. Modulation of certain components of
the complement system, such as C3a or C5a, has been shown
to be relevant in EAE22. However, C5a serum levels were
not significantly different between WT and F12 � / � animals
(Supplementary Fig. 4h).
FXII is pivotal for DC to orchestrate T-cell differentiation.
FXII can directly act on cells by binding to domain 2 of the
glycoprotein CD87 (refs 16,18). Hence, we evaluated Cd87
expression in different immune cell subtypes isolated from
the LN or spleen of naive WT mice by rRT–PCR (Fig. 3a).
Interestingly, Cd87 expression was prominent in CD11c þ DC,
identifying those cells as a potential target of FXII. Naive
CD4 þ T-cell activation under TH1-, TH17- and inducible Treg
(iTreg)-favouring conditions did not lead to substantial CD87
upregulation (Fig. 3b). To search for CD87 þ DC subsets, we
purified conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)
from WT mouse spleens. Both cell types expressed high levels of
CD87 at both the messenger RNA and protein levels (Fig. 3b,c).
Further protease-activated receptors (PAR), such as PAR1–4, are
also able to interact with coagulation factors23. However, in
contrast to CD87, cDC and pDC expressed only low numbers of
Par1–4 messenger RNA transcripts (Fig. 3d).
We examined potential immunoregulatory functions of FXII
pertinent to the interaction between CD4 þ T cells and DC using
different co-culture approaches. No significant differences in
T-cell proliferation and cytokine production of IFN-g and IL-17A
were observed when incubating CD4 þ T cells with FXII or
vehicle (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In addition, TH1, TH17 or Foxp3
induction in CD4 þ T cells cultivated under TH1-, TH17- and
iTreg-inducing conditions, respectively, was not significantly
affected by the presence of FXII (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In
contrast, FXII-treated cDCs produced higher amounts of IL-6 in
response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as compared with control
conditions, while the levels of IL-10 and IL-12 were significantly
reduced (Fig. 3e). In line with the finding for IL-6, the amount of
IL-23 was also significantly higher, whereas the levels of TGF-b
and IL-27 were reduced in the presence of FXII compared with
controls (Fig. 3e). However, treatment of pDCs with FXII alone or
together with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1,826 (CpG) did not
lead to a significant shift in IL-6, IL-10, IL-23 or TGF-b
production (Fig. 3e). For cDCs, similar results were obtained
using FXIIa, the active form of FXII (Fig. 4a) and a non-cleavable
FXII (Fig. 4b), indicating that both the active and inactive forms
of FXII can modulate cDC function. Notably, immature and
mature DCs did not differ significantly in terms of expression
of the different surface markers in F12 � / � mice compared
with WT controls or after exposure to FXII (Supplementary
Figs 6 and 7).
To address the hypothesis that FXII modulates cDC function
via CD87, cDCs of CD87-deficient (Cd87 � / �) mice were treated
with FXII or vehicle in the presence of LPS. In this scenario, cDC
cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, TGF-b and IL-27 were not affected
by FXII, indicating that CD87 on DCs is the main receptor
mediating the effects of FXII (Fig. 4c). However, as CD87 is a
glycoprotein
without
an
intracellular
domain
and
cannot
induce intracellular signalling by itself, we sought to determine
whether further transmembrane receptors are necessary to
initiate intracellular signalling. Previous evidence has suggested
that CD87 may form lateral complexes with b2-integrins, such
as
Mac-1
integrin
(also
designated
CD11b/CD18),
which
could thereby serve as mediators of CD87-triggered signalling
events24,25. Thus, we engaged CD11b-deficient (Itgam � / �)
cDCs, which we treated with FXII or vehicle in the presence of
LPS. FXII failed to induce changes in the production of cytokines
in CD11b-deficient cDCs, indicating that the ligation of CD87 by
FXII induces intracellular signalling in a CD11b-dependent
manner (Fig. 4d).
Pathways inducing enhanced cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in
DCs are triggered by LPS and enhance cytokines associated
with TH17 responses, such as IL-6 and IL-23, while decreasing
TH1-associated cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-27 (refs 26,27).
We therefore challenged WT cDCs with LPS in the presence and
absence of FXII. Although FXII had only a slight effect on basal
cAMP levels, it further increased the intracellular cAMP induced
in cDCs by LPS (Fig. 4e). This effect was again CD87 dependent,
as FXII failed to alter intracellular cAMP levels in Cd87-deficient
DCs (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, production of TH17-associated
cytokines was also reduced by treating WT cDCs with FXII in
combination with different protein kinase A signalling inhibitors
(Fig. 4f), indicating no significant role of protein kinase
A-independent pathways of cAMP.
We
obtained
consistent
results
using
DC-CD4 þ
T-cell
co-cultures. Under unskewed co-culture conditions (WT or
Cd87 � / � CD4 þ T cells and WT DCs), FXII reduced IFN-g and
increased IL-17A, IL-6 and IL-23 (Fig. 4g). In contrast, cytokine
levels of Cd87 � / � DCs co-cultured with WT or Cd87 � / �
CD4 þ T cells were not significantly different from controls
(Fig. 4g). To prove that CD87 is also relevant in vivo, an AT
model was created using CD4 þ T cells and DCs isolated from
WT and Cd87 � / � mice restimulated in the presence or absence
of FXII (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, WT mice treated with FXII-
restimulated WT CD4 þ T cells and DCs displayed an aggravated
disease course, while FXII had no additional effect on CD87-
deficient CD4 þ T cells and DCs. Of note, transfer of Cd87 � / �
CD4 þ T cells and DCs led to an attenuated disease course, as
compared with control conditions (Fig. 5a).
To address a relevant role of CD87 also on resident cells, bone
marrow (BM) chimeras were created by transferring WT or
Cd87 � / � BM into WT and Cd87 � / � hosts after irradiation.
Cd87 � / � or WT mice reconstituted with Cd87 � / � BM were
less susceptible to the development of EAE compared with WT

 mice reconstituted with WT BM (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, transfer
of WT BM into Cd87 � / � animals led to a partial protection
(Fig. 5b) arguing for a role of FXII on both peripheral and
resident cells.
CD87 is also expressed on endothelial, microglial and astroglial
cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Hence, we isolated MBMECs
from WT mice and treated them with FXII under naive and
inflammatory conditions. While inflammation led to a significant
reduction of transendothelial resistance (TER), FXII had no
additional effect (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Furthermore, while
MIP-1b production of MBMECs was increased in the presence of
FXII, other chemokines were not influenced (unaltered level of
CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, MIP-1a, RANTES, CCL11,
CCL17 and CCL22; no detection of CCL20, CXCL5 and CXCL13;
Supplementary Fig. 8c). To exclude a direct effect of FXII on
transmigration, we analysed the impact of FXII on the migratory
capacity of immune cells in an in vitro transmigration assay. The
number of immune cells crossing the MBMEC barrier did not
change in the absence or presence of FXII (Supplementary
Fig. 8d). To analyse the potential effect of FXII on microglia and
astrocytes, primary cultures were prepared. However, FXII did
not affect major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I or –II, or
production of IL-6, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a)
cytokines in both microglia (Supplementary Fig. 8e,g) and
astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 8f,h). Of note, the number
of
activated
microglia
and
astrocytes
was
unchanged
in
FXII-deficient animals compared with WT controls on dmax of
EAE (Supplementary Fig. 8i,j).
As extensive FXII depositions were found in the CNS of
immunized mice (Fig. 1a,b), we analysed the possible effect of
FXII on cDCs present in the CNS on dmax of EAE mice.
Therefore, we separated cDCs from the CNS on dmax (Fig. 5c).

 Interestingly, cDCs isolated from F12 � / � mice showed again a
reduction in IL-6 levels (Fig. 5d), while the surface markers CD80,
CD86 and MHC-II were unchanged (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, FXII
depositions were localized in the close proximity of DCs in the
inflamed spinal cord (Fig. 5f).
Pharmacologic inhibition of FXII protects from EAE. Since
FXII deficiency prevented EAE, we investigated whether the effect
of FXII deficiency could be mimicked using the highly specific
FXII inhibitor, recombinant human albumin (rHA)-Infestin-4
(ref. 28). Indeed, rHA-Infestin-4, starting 1 day after MOG35–55
immunization, significantly attenuated the signs of EAE in WT
mice (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table 3) and was able to ameliorate
cellular inflammation and demyelination (Fig. 6b,c). Again, the
protective effect of rHA-Infestin-4 in WT mice was associated
with a reduced TH17 immune response (Fig. 6d). In contrast,
rHA-Infestin-4 could no longer alter the EAE disease course
when applied after neurologic symptom onset (Fig. 6e). Inter-
estingly, rHA-Infestin-4 could not be found in the CNS of EAE
mice, indicating no significant entrance of the substance through
the BBB into the CNS (Supplementary Fig. 9). These findings
point again to both a predominant role of FXII in DC-mediated
EAE disease priming and influence on resident APCs.
To further demonstrate that FXII inhibition represents a
promising new approach to combat MS, we challenged SJL/JRj
mice in a relapsing–remitting-EAE (RR-EAE) model29. FXII
inhibition significantly reduced the number and severity of
relapses, even when rHA-Infestin-4 was injected in a delayed
setting, that is, not until the first clinical attack (Fig. 6f;
Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, the inhibition of FXII
was challenged in a spontaneous model of EAE that has been
used in our group before30. For this purpose, double transgenic
Devic mice were generated by crossbreeding transgenic mice
carrying either a MOG35–55-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) or
MOG35–55-specific
B-cell
receptor,
since
50–70%
of
these
mice spontaneously develop EAE-like symptoms without the
administration of any substances used for immunization31.
Littermates were treated daily with rHA-Infestin-4 (200mgkg� 1
body weight) or vehicle for 20 consecutive days, starting at
postnatal day 20. Devic mice treated with rHA-Infestin-4
displayed attenuated clinical symptoms (Fig. 6g,h), sustained
motor coordination, as revealed by rotarod analysis (Fig. 6i), and
a limited number of CNS-infiltrating CD4 þ T cells (Fig. 6j).
To further analyse the functional relevance of FXII in adaptive
immunity, we introduced a skin contact hypersensitivity model in
which TH17 cells are critically involved in disease pathogenesis. In
this model, mice are immunized by painting dinitrofluorobenzene
on the shaved abdomen on day 0 and undergo antigen
rechallenge on day 5 by painting the same antigen on the ear.
Ear
thickness
and
the
underlying
immune
responses
are
assessed 1 day later. F12 � / � mice developed less inflammation
in the challenged ear and less IL-17A production from T cells,
while proliferation and IFN-g production were unchanged
(Fig. 6k), suggesting that FXII deficiency can inhibit TH17 cell
development, not only under neuroinflammatory conditions but
also in other immune disorders.
FXII is upregulated in MS patients. To assess the involvement of
FXII in humans, we analysed the plasma from individuals with
different forms of MS (clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing–
remitting MS, primary progressive MS and secondary progressive
MS, Supplementary Table 5). FXII plasma level was significantly
increased in patients with relapsing–remitting MS and secondary
progressive MS compared with healthy donors (HDs; Fig. 7a).
Interestingly, enhanced FXII amount was observed during the
course of a relapse (Fig. 7b). Moreover, FXII levels tended to
correlate with disease activity, as higher levels were associated
with a shorter relapse-free period, independent of immunomo-
dulatory therapy (Fig. 7c). In addition to these peripheral
alterations, extensive FXII depositions could be found in the CNS
of individuals with MS, but not in HDs (Fig. 7d). These deposi-
tions were in close contact with DCs, indicating that these cells
may be the potential targets of FXII in the CNS of MS patients as
well (Fig. 7e). As mouse data suggest an immunomodulatory
function of FXII on DCs, also in the periphery, we examined the
influence of FXII on these cells in humans (Fig. 7f). Interestingly,
in contrast to the mouse data, FXII led to an extensive upregu-
lation of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in human
DCs (Fig. 7g,h), while CD40 and MHC-II expression was unal-
tered (Fig. 7i,j). Furthermore, CD87, the proposed binding part-
ner of FXII, was significantly increased in human DCs on FXII
treatment (Fig. 7k). Together, these data suggest that FXII also
significantly enhanced the amount of IL-6 and IL-23 (Fig. 7l),
indicating a significant immunomodulatory role of FXII, not only
in mice but also in humans.
Discussion
Immune inflammation triggered by pathogenic and/or auto-
reactive TH cells underlies various immune diseases3,32,33. To our
knowledge, our work represents major novel insights into the role
of a plasmatic coagulation cascade member as a critical trigger of
autoimmune inflammation. Genetic deficiency or pharmacologic
blockade of FXII significantly protected from EAE in different
clinically relevant settings. Mechanistically, FXII stimulates
DC-mediated
TH17-cell
generation
in
a
CD87-dependent
manner. Importantly, FXII deficiency also ameliorated skin
allergy, thereby underpinning the pathophysiologic importance
of this coagulation factor in adaptive immunity, and thus as a
potential therapeutic target in autoimmunity.
The traditional view of plasmatic coagulation cascade is linked
to thrombotic diseases19. However, there is increasing evidence
that
some
coagulation
factors
may
also
be
involved
in
autoimmune disorders, such as in MS, inflammatory bowel
disease or dermatitis34–36. Depositions of fibrinogen and the
degradation products thereof were found in the CNS and skin of
patients with MS or dermatitis34–36. In the brain, those
depositions fostered microglia activation and subsequent plaque
formation12,36. Moreover, a close correlation between the cerebral
or spinal fibrin load and the number of relapses was reported in
EAE mice, and anticoagulant administration or fibrinogen
depletion reversed the pathology14,37. Apart from triggering
thrombus
formation
via
the
intrinsic
pathway
of
blood
coagulation, FXII is also central to the triggering of the
proinflammatory KKS, leading to the formation of BK. The
physiologic and pathophysiologic effects of BK are mediated by
two distinct BK receptors38. Human studies revealed that B1R is
expressed on circulating lymphocytes and infiltrating T cells
during active episodes of MS. Moreover, B1R can be found on
endothelial cells within MS plaques39–41. In the EAE model,
contradictory reports exist with regard to the relevance of B1R
and B2R21,42.
While
the
immune
system
of
FXII-deficient
mice
was
dominated by a protective response with a reduction in TH17
cells, we found that, for this shift, neither the coagulation system
nor the KKS was required. This unexpected observation led us to
hypothesize that FXII might affect the immune system via CD87
(ref. 18).
CD87 is a glycoprotein tethered to the cell membrane with a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. CD87 was originally identi-
fied as a binding site for urokinase on the surface of different cells,

 but can also be activated by FXII18. Indeed, cDCs and pDCs
isolated from the periphery constitutively expressed CD87, as did
activated CD4 þ T cells. Most notably, FXII tipped the balance of
T-cell differentiation towards a TH17 phenotype, which is
increasingly
being
recognized
as
a
key
player
in
MS
pathophysiology8,43. This effect of FXII critically depended on
the presence of CD87 in cDCs. Moreover, since CD87 lacks an
intracellular domain, we identified the CD11b integrin, which was
previously shown to interact with CD87 on the membrane24,25,
as the adapter-mediating intracellular signalling and cytokine
upregulation triggered by FXII.
Our data suggest that FXII acts on peripheral DCs, thereby
shaping T-cell differentiation and adaptive immunity. FXII was
also found in the CNS during neuroinflammation, indicating a

 significant local role. Resident cells such as microglia, astrocytes
and endothelial cells are known to express CD87. However, none
of these cells could be identified as a relevant target of FXII in our
model. Nevertheless, FXII was able to induce a cytokine shift in
DCs localized in the CNS during neuroinflammation. DCs can
regulate T-cell function and are capable of integrating a myriad of
incoming immune signals to govern downstream circuits44,45. We
here provide evidence that CD87 activation through FXII impacts
the cytokine responses to inflammatory signals and yields a
typical TH17 cytokine network by boosting IL-6 production
under neuroinflammatory conditions.
From a translational perspective, FXII blockade in WT mice
with the highly specific FXII inhibitor rHA-Infestin-4 had a
beneficial effect on disease severity and progression in different
EAE models. Since rHA-Infestin-4 has anticoagulant properties
and potentially interferes with hemostasis, there might be a
considerable risk of inducing bleeding complications when using
this compound. However, previous experimental stroke and
thrombosis studies revealed that neither F12 � / � nor WT mice
treated with rHA-infestin-4 developed a bleeding phenotype19,28.
This is in line with the notion that FXII is dispensable for
hemostasis, but only contributes to thrombosis16. The fact that
FXII
inactivation
does
not
affect
hemostasis
makes
FXII
inhibition a safe pharmacologic approach, at least in rodents46.
Whether this also applies to humans, and particularly in the
course of autoimmune CNS inflammation, needs to be elucidated.
Notably, we never observed any major haemorrhages in the
organs of F12 � / � mice subjected to EAE (not shown).
Overall, our study identifies FXII as a key regulator of
adaptive immune responses during neuroinflammation. Targeted
inhibition of FXII might become a promising approach to redress
immune balance in MS. Further studies in relevant preclinical
disease models are warranted.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6N mice, which served as controls (WT), and SJL/JRj mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). FXII-deficient
(F12 � / �)19, factor XI-deficient (F11 � / �)19, B1R-deficient (B1r � / �)21 and
B2R-deficient (B2r � / �) mice21 were a gift from C. Kleinschnitz (Department of
Neurology, University Hospital Wu
¨rzburg, Wu
¨rzburg, Germany). CD11b-deficient
(Itgam � / �)47 mice and CD87-deficient (Cd87 � / �)48 animals were obtained from
T. Chavakis (Department of Clinical Pathobiochemistry and Institute for Clinical
Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Clinic Carl Gustav Carus,
Technische Universita
¨t of Dresden, Dresden, Germany) and C. Ruppert
(Department of Internal Medicine, Universities of Giessen & Marburg Lung Center
(UGMLC)/Member of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Justus-Liebig
University, Giessen, Germany), respectively. Transgenic 2D2 (TCRMOG) and
Th (IgHMOG) mice from the laboratory of H. Wekerle (Department of
Neuroimmunology, Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried,
Germany) were also used31. All mice, except SJL/JRj, had a C57BL/6 background.
All animal experiments were performed on adult mice at 8–10 weeks of age.
All animal protocols were approved by the local authorities, and were in
accordance with the German laws and regulations for animal care.
Induction and evaluation of EAE. Active EAE was induced by immunization
of 8–10-week-old female F12 � / �, F11 � / � and WT (C57BL/6N) mice
with MOG35–55 peptide (Charite
´, Berlin, Germany)21. Briefly, animals were
subcutaneously immunized with 200 mg of the mouse MOG35–55 peptide emulsified
in 200 ml complete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim,
Germany) containing 200 mg Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37 Ra; Becton,
Dickinson and Company (BD), Sparks, MD, USA). Pertussis toxin (PTx; 400 ng
in 200 ml PBS; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) was injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) on the day of immunization (day 0) and 2 days later. Some
mice were treated daily with intravenous (i.v.) injections of FXII (200 mg kg � 1
body weight, Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT, USA) or respective
vehicle from MOG35–55 immunization. Furthermore, FXII inhibitor rHA-Infestin-4
(200 mg kg � 1 body weight; CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) or respective
vehicle were administered by daily i.v. injection starting 1 day after MOG35–55
immunization (prophylactic regimen) or 1 day after the appearance of first clinical
signs (therapeutic regimen). For AT-EAE experiments49,50, WT, F12 � / � or
Cd87 � / � donor mice were immunized as described above for active EAE
experiments, but animals received a dose of 200 ng PTx on the day of
immunization and 2 days later. LN cells were isolated 12 days post immunization,
and, in some cases, further separated into CD4 þ T cells as well as CD11c þ APCs
as described below. LN cells or CD4 þ T and CD11c þ cells (ratio 5:1, conditions as
described in the figures) were restimulated for 72 h with 10 mg ml � 1 MOG35–55
peptide and 0.5 ng ml � 1 IL-12 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). AT of the
encephalitogenic LN cells (8.4 � 106 cells per mouse) or CD4 þ T and CD11c þ
cells (1.5 � 107 cells per mouse) in 200 ml PBS was performed by i.p. injection into
recipient mice. For the generation of BM chimera51, WT and Cd87 � / � mice were
irradiated with a single dose of 10 Gy, and BM cells from WT or Cd87 � / � mice
from the same litter were injected i.v. into the irradiated mice (4.0 � 106 cells per
mouse). Six weeks later, active EAE was induced as above described. RR-EAE was
induced in SJL/JRj mice by vaccination with 75 mg of proteolipid protein peptide
139–151 (Genemed Synthesis, San Antonia, TX, USA) emulsified in complete
Freund’s adjuvant containing 600 mg M. tuberculosis29. Each mouse received
subcutaneous injections of 200 ml emulsion divided among four sites draining
axillary and inguinal LN. PTx (400 ng) was administered i.p. on the day of
immunization and 2 days later. Animals were scored as described below.
rHA-Infestin-4 (200 mg kg � 1 body weight) or respective vehicle was administered
daily i.v. after the onset of the first clinical RR-EAE attack. A relapse was defined as
a sustained (42 day) increase in the clinical score by at least one full grade after the
animal had improved previously by at least one full grade and had stabilized for at
least 2 days. For a spontaneous model of EAE, 2D2 mice were crossed with Th mice
(IgHMOG) to generate double transgenic Devic mice (TCRMOG � IgHMOG) in our
facility30. Littermates received daily i.p. injections of rHA-Infestin-4 (200 mg kg � 1
body weight) or vehicle for 20 consecutive days, starting at postnatal day 20. The
motor coordination was assessed using the rotarod test. For this, mice were placed
on a rotarod with automatic timers and falling sensors (Harvard Apparatus March-
Hugstetten, Germany) while the speed of the rod was accelerated from 4 to
40 r.p.m. within 10 min, and the time the mice remained on the rod was recorded.
For each mouse, the average time of three trials followed by 30-min breaks was
recorded daily. All animals were kept under standard conditions and had access to
water and food ad libitum. The clinical course of EAE was monitored daily by two
blinded investigators using the following score system: grade 0, no abnormality;
grade 1, limp tail tip; grade 2, limp tail; grade 3, moderate hindlimb weakness;
grade 4, complete hindlimb weakness; grade 5, mild paraparesis; grade 6,
paraparesis; grade 7, heavy paraparesis or paraplegia; grade 8, tetraparesis; grade 9,
quadriplegia or premoribund state; or grade 10, death. Animals with a score 47
were killed and the last score observed was included in the analysis until the end of

 the experiment. The mean cumulative score for a treatment group was calculated as
the sum of the daily scores of all animals from day 0 until the end of the
experiment divided by the number of animals in the respective group.
Cell preparation. Single-cell suspensions of mouse LN (cervical, axillary,
mesenterial and inguinal), spleens or BM were prepared from naive animals, or
immunized animals 10 days after the induction of EAE or at the peak of disease21.

 CD4 þ T cells were isolated from LN cells of WT, F12 � / � and F11 � / � mice
using CD4 þ or CD4 þCD62L þ T-cell isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany). DCs were purified from the spleen or BM of WT, F12 � / �,
Cd87 � / � and Itgam � / � mice using the CD11c þ or pDC isolation kits (Miltenyi
Biotec). All immunomagnetic cell separations were performed according to the
supplier’s manual. For purification of BILs52, brains and spinal cords from
immunized WT and F12 � / � animals at dmax were collected after transcardial PBS
perfusion. CNS tissues were cut into pieces and further mechanically homogenized
in PBS, layered on a 30–50% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient and continuously
centrifuged for 30 min at 2,500 r.p.m. Mononuclear cells were isolated at the
interphase. After isolation, cells were washed and resuspended in the appropriate
buffer or medium for further analysis. For quantification of cell numbers isolated
from the CNS, Calibrite beads (BD) were added to freshly isolated BILs from WT
and F12 � / � animals before washing and staining. Furthermore, human PBMCs
were obtained from leukoreduction system chambers (Department of Transfusion
Medicine, University of Mu
¨nster) of anonymous HDs by density gradient
centrifugation as described before53. Purified PBMCs were left untreated or treated
with 60 nM FXII for 24 h before the use for further analysis by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. For rRT–PCR, CNS-derived
DC subsets were isolated from the spinal cord and brain of immunized WT and
F12 � / � animals at dmax by sorting on a BD fluorescence-activated cell sorting Aria
III instrument after BIL purification. Cell purity was routinely 495%.
ELISA and proliferation assay. Samples of serum, plasma, single-cell suspensions
of LN and CSF were taken from mice under basal conditions or at dmax of EAE
from respective mice. CSF was collected according to the technique described by
Fleming et al.54 Samples (5 ml) were diluted 20 times in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20, and frozen at � 80 �C.
Determination of FXII was performed using the ELISA Kit for Coagulation FXII
(USCN Life Science, Inc., Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In one set of experiments, irradiated (35 Gy) DCs from WT or
F12 � / � mice were pulsed with 10 mg ml � 1 MOG35–55 and used as APC
co-cultured with syngeneic CD4 þ T cells derived from the LN, as described
before52. Cells were cultured in 1 ml DMEM containing 10 mM HEPES,
25 mg ml � 1 gentamicin, 50 mM mercaptoethanol, 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM
glutamine and 1% non-essential amino acids (Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium) for
2 days and stimulated with 10 mg ml � 1 MOG35–55. [3H]thymidine (Amerham,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) was added for the final 14 h, and radioactivity was measured
on a b-scintillation counter (TopCount NXT, PerkinElmer, Rodgau-Ju
¨gesheim,
Germany). The supernatants were analysed for different cytokines by ELISA.
Fractioned DC subpopulations were incubated for 48 h with medium alone,
1 mg ml � 1 LPS (for cDCs) or 10 mg ml � 1 CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1,826 (for
pDCs) in the absence or presence of FXII, non-cleavable FXII (CSL Behring) or
FXIIa (American Diagnostica Inc.—now Sekisui Diagnostics, Stamford, CT, USA).
Cytokine production from BILs was measured in culture supernatants collected
after a 24-h cell incubation with 10 mg ml � 1 MOG35–55. Mouse cytokines (IL-6, IL-
10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-23, IL-27, IFN-g and the active form of TGF-b1) and human
cytokines (IL-6 and IL-23) were assessed in culture supernatants of the above-
described cells by ELISA using specific kits (R&D Systems, Peprotech, Hamburg,
Germany, and eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The concentrations of cAMP in cDCs were measured using cAMP XP
assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Cambridge, UK). Briefly, cDCs were
incubated with medium only or with 1 mg ml � 1 LPS for 10 min in the absence or
presence of FXII. Reactions were stopped by aspirating the medium, and then the
cells were lysed with 100 ml of lysis buffer. Cell lysate was transferred into microtiter
plates, and cAMP concentrations were measured according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. BK levels were determined using the Bradykinin ELISA Kit (Phoenix
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) with minor modifications. Briefly,
biotin-labelled antigen was diluted 20 times to increase the sensitivity. The
competitive immunoextraction step was carried out by incubating for 4 h at room
temperature (RT) under agitation. Peptides were detectable at a 1–10 pg ml � 1
linear range with 0.1 pg ml � 1 minimum detectable concentration42. For
complement (C5a) detection, plates were precoated with a rat anti-mouse C5a
capture antibody (clone I52-1486; BD) diluted in coating buffer (100 mM NaHCO3
and 34 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.5), and incubated overnight55. This capture antibody is
specific for a neoepitope exposed only in mouse C5a/C5adesArg, and does not
cross react with native C5. Then, plates were blocked for 1 h in assay diluent
(10% FCS/PBS, followed by a 2-h incubation with samples and standards.
Thereafter, a rat anti-mouse C5a biotin-labelled detection antibody (clone I52-278;
BD) was added for 1 h. To detect captured mouse C5a, streptavidin–horseradish
peroxidase (BD) was added for 30 min, followed by tetramethylbenzidine
(Sigma-Aldrich); the reaction was stopped using 1 M H2SO4, and the plate was read
at 450 nm. Concentrations of measured analytes were calculated via four-parameter
logistic curve fitting according to standard curves, respectively. For in vitro cell
treatments, FXII, non-cleavable FXII and FXIIa were diluted in medium to a final
concentration of 60 nM, unless otherwise specified.
Histology and immunohistochemistry/-cytochemistry. For murine CNS tissue,
spinal cords were removed after transcardial perfusion with PBS from naive
WT mice or from MOG35–55-immunized WT, F11 � / � and F12 � / � mice at dmax,
embedded in Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Miles
Laboratories, Elkhart, IN, USA), and cut into 10-mm-thin sections from the lumbar
region. For human CNS tissue, human autopsy and biopsy material from MS
patients and HDs was obtained from The UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank
(Division of Neuroscience and Mental Health, London, UK, n ¼ 5). For the present
study, five MS cases were analysed for whom cryofixed brain tissue was available.
The lesions fulfilled the morphologic criteria of an inflammatory demyelinating
process consistent with MS when stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), Luxol
fast blue (LFB)-periodic acid Schiff myelin stain and Bielschowsky’s silver
impregnation for axons. Cryofixed tissues from MS patients and HDs were cut into
10-mm sections. For immunohistochemistry/-cytochemistry, sections or cell cul-
tures were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT, washed with
10 mM PBS, blocked for 1 h at RT with 1 � PBS containing 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA), 1% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and
incubated with primary antibody at 4 �C overnight. Primary antibodies were
diluted in 1 � PBS containing 5% BSA and 1% normal goat serum, and incubated
overnight at 4 �C. Sections were stained with the primary antibodies to the fol-
lowing: FXII (1:50, Proteintech), human CD11c (1:100, clone 3.9, Abcam, Cam-
bridge, UK), human albumin (1:50, Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA),
ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (1:250, polyclonal, Wako Chemicals
GmbH, Neuss, Germany), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1,000, clone G-A-
5, Sigma-Aldrich) and mouse CD11c (1:1,000, clone N418, eBioscience, San Diego,
CA, USA). Astrocyte and microglia cultures were stained with anti-GFAP and anti-
CD11b (1:1,000, clone EPR1344, Abcam), respectively. In addition, both were
stained with anti-MHC-I (1:200, clone ER-HR52, Abcam) and anti-MHC-II (1:50,
clone NIMR-4, Abcam). After washing steps, secondary antibodies were diluted in
1 � PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated for 1 h at RT. The following secondary
antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-mouse (1:100, polyclonal,
Invitrogen, Waltham, MA USA) or goat anti-Armenian hamster (1:100, polyclonal,
Invitrogen), and Cy3-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (1:800, polyclonal,
Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). All stainings were embedded in peqGOLD (Peqlab,
Erlangen, Germany) before microscopic analysis. Negative controls were obtained
by either omitting the primary or secondary antibody and revealed no detectable
signal (not shown). To reveal inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination21,
sections were stained with HE and LFB according to the standard procedures. All
stainings were examined by microscopy (Axiophot2, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)
with a charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analysed
in a blinded manner using Axiovision (Zeiss) and also Image J software. For
quantification, inflammatory foci (HE), demyelinated areas (LFB) and the
fluorescence intensity of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and GFAP
were counted on three slices of six mice per group, and the fluorescence intensity of
MHC-I and MHC-II per area was calculated for five coverslips per condition,
whereas the value of each coverslip is the mean of five cells per coverslip.
Flow cytometry. For the detection of cell surface markers and intracellular/
intranuclear markers by flow-activated cell-sorting analysis, single-cell suspensions
from murine LN, spleen and BIL of WT and F12 � / � mice under basal conditions,
or 10 days after the induction of EAE or at the peak of disease, as well as fractioned
cell populations and human PBMCs were stained for 30 min at 4 �C, with
appropriate combination of indicated fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibodies
in PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and 0.1% BSA. Corresponding isotype controls were
used for all stainings. For blocking of Fc receptors, cells were preincubated with
purified anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (BioLegend, London, UK, 1.0 mg per 106 cells in
100 ml volume) or with human Fc receptor-blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 5 min on ice before immunostaining. The
following monoclonal antibodies were used at 1:200 dilutions for the detection
of cell surface markers: CD3 (clone 17A2, BioLegend), CD4 (clone RM4-5,
BioLegend), CD8a (clone 53-6.7, BioLegend), CD11b (clone M1/70, eBioscience),
CD11c (clone N418, BioLegend), CD25 (clone PC61, BioLegend), CD40 (clone
1C10, eBioscience), CD45R/B220 (clone RA3-6B2, BD), CD80 (clone 16-10A1,
BD), CD86 (clone GL1, BD), CD154 (also known as CD40L, clone MR1,
BioLegend), CD317 (clone 927, BioLegend), Ly-6C (clone HK1.4, BioLegend),
MHC-II (clone M5/114.15.2, eBioscience) and TCR-g/d (clone GL3, BioLegend)
for mouse cells; and CD1c (clone AD5-8E7, Miltenyi Biotec), CD11b (clone M1/70,
BioLegend), CD11c (clone 3.9, eBioscience), CD19 (clone HIB19, BD), CD40
(clone 5C3, BioLegend), CD80 (clone L307.4, BD), CD86 (clone 2331, BD), CD87
(clone VIM5, eBioscience) and MHC-II (clone G46-6, BD) for human cells. The
biotinylated polyclonal anti-mouse CD87 antibody (1:20, R&D Systems) was
detected by a following fluorescence-labelled streptavidin-conjugated antibody
(1:100, Invitrogen). For immunofluorescent staining of intracellular cytokines,
peripheral LN cells as well as CNS infiltrates were isolated 10 days after the
induction of EAE or at the peak of disease and polyclonally restimulated for 4 h at
37 �C in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin and brefeldin
A, using Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (BD) to block cytokine secretion. In the
case of in vitro TH1 and TH17 differentiation (which is described below), cells were
treated with brefeldin A (BD) for 8 h after culturing. After cell-specific surface
staining, mouse IL-17A (1:50, clone eBio17B7, eBioscience) or IFN-g (1:50, clone
XMG1.2, BD) protein expression was evaluated by intracellular staining using the
Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kit (BD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
intranuclear Foxp3 (1:100, clone FJK-16S, eBioscience) analyses, after cell-specific

 surface staining, cells were fixed/permeabilized with the Foxp3/Transcription
Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Stained cells were assayed on a FACSGallios flow cytometer using Kaluza software
(Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany).
rRT–PCR. RNA isolation and RT–PCR were performed as previously described
following TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA)21: Tbx21 (Mm00450960_m1), Gata3 (Mm00484683_m1), Rorc
(Mm01261622_m1), Foxp3 (Mm00475162_m1), Brdkb1 (B1R, Mm00432059_s1),
Brdkb2 (B2R, Mm00437788_s1), Cd87 (Mm00440911_m1), Par1
(Mm00438851_m1), Par2 (Mm00433160_m1), Par3 (Mm00473929_m1), Par4
(Mm01228147_m1), Il-6 (Mm00446190_m1) and eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA
(Hs99999901_s1). Results were analysed using the StepOne software (Applied
Biosystems) and the comparative Ct (Threshold cycle) method. Data are expressed
as 2 � DDCt for the experimental gene of interest normalized to the housekeeping
gene and presented as fold change relative to control.
Western blot. Spinal cord was homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) containing 0.1% SDS and
4% proteinase inhibitor (complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel,
Swiss))19,55. Samples were sonified for 10 s. Afterwards, tissue lysates were
centrifuged at 15,000g for 30 min at 4 �C, and the supernatants were used for
bicinchoninic acid protein assay and subsequent western blot analysis. The total
lysates were treated with 4 � SDS–PAGE loading buffer (final concentration:
62.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 3% b-mercaptoethanol, 8% SDS, 15% glycerol) at 95 �C for
5 min. A 20-mg amount of total protein was electrophoresed and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking for 30 min with blocking
buffer (5% non-fat dry milk, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20),
membranes were incubated with anti-fibrin/fibrinogen polyclonal antibody 1:500
(cross-reactive for fibrin and fibrinogen; Acris Antibodies, Herford, Germany).
After a washing step with TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05% Tween-20),
membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (for fibrin/fibrinogen; Dianova) at a dilution of
1:5,000 and were finally developed using ECL plus (GE Healthcare, Hamburg,
Germany). Images have been cropped for presentation. Full-size images are
presented in Supplementary Fig. 10.
MBMECs and transmigration assays. MBMECs21 were prepared from brains
of WT and B1r � / � mice, and cultured 6 days before reseeding on Collagen
IV/fibronectin- (Sigma) coated Transwell inserts with 3.0 mm pore polyester
membrane (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA). Purity, confluency and cell morphology
were checked on a regular basis by flow cytometry, resistance measurements and
microscopy. To induce upregulation of B1R, MBMECs were inflamed in vitro using
IFN-g and TNF-a (each 500 IU ml � 1, Peprotech) for 24 h. Naive LN cells from
WT and F12 � / � mice were loaded in the upper chamber and were allowed to
migrate towards 5% FCS. After an incubation period of 18 h, migrated cells from
the lower chamber of two compartments were collected, and the relative cell
number of CD4 þ T cells was determined by flow cytometry. To assess the effects
of FXII on MBMECs, the cells were treated with FXII (60 nM) under naive
or inflamed conditions with IFN-g and TNF-a (each 500 IU ml � 1) for 24 h,
during which the transendothelial resistance was monitored with the cellZscope
apparatus (nanoAnalytics GmbH, Mu
¨nster, Germany). Twenty-four hours post
inflammation, MBMEC supernatants were collected, and the concentration of
proinflammatory chemokines was assessed using the LEGENDplex Mouse
Proinflammatory Chemokine immunoassay (catalogue no. 740007; BioLegend)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To assess MBMEC permeability, 24 h
post inflammation with or without FXII, naive splenocytes from WT mice were
loaded on the upper chamber of the transwell and were allowed to migrate for 18 h
towards 5% FCS. For quantification of migrated cells, Calibrite beads were added
before collecting the cells from the lower chamber. Numbers of migrated cells were
determined by counting 1.0 � 104 references beads by flow cytometry as described
before56.
In vitro cell differentiation. Purified naive CD4 þCD62L þ T cells were activated
for 3 days with 5 mg ml � 1 of plate-bound CD3-specific (clone 145-2C11;
eBioscience) and 1 mg ml � 1 soluble CD28-specific (clone 37.51; BD) antibodies
in the absence or presence of 60 nM FXII, and in the presence of various combi-
nations of recombinant cytokines and blocking antibodies as follows: 10 mg ml � 1
anti-IL-4 (clone 11B11, eBioscience) and 10 ng ml � 1 IL-12 (Peprotech) for TH1
cells; 5 ng ml � 1 human TGF-b (R&D Systems), 20 ng ml � 1 IL-6 (eBioscience),
10 mg ml � 1 anti-IFN-g (clone XMG1.2, eBioscience) and 10 mg ml � 1 anti-IL-4 for
TH17 cells; 5 ng ml � 1 TGF-b, 10 mg ml � 1 anti-IFN-g and 10 mg ml � 1 anti-IL-4 for
iTreg cells. After 3 days at 37 �C and 5% CO2, cells of TH1 and TH17 differentiation
were further analysed by flow cytometry as described above.
Contact hypersensitivity. We sensitized female mice by applying 25 ml of 1%
(w/v) dinitrofluorobenzene in acetone/olive oil (4:1, v/v) on the shaved abdominal
skin. After 5 days, animals were rechallenged by applying 20 ml of 0.3%
dinitrofluorobenzene to the left ear. To determine ear swelling, ear thickness was
measured with a micrometre before and 24 h after antigen re-exposure. LN cells
from WT and F12 � / � mice were prepared and cultured on day 5.
Primary murine cell cultures. For microglia culture, pups of WT mice were
decapitated at postnatal days 1–5 and, after removal of the cerebellum, the
meninges were removed. Up to five brains were mechanically homogenized
together in 5 ml L-glutamine-containing DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
with a 5-ml pipette. The supernatants were incubated for 5 min on ice, and after
centrifugation of the pooled supernatants at 486g for 5 min at RT, the pellets were
resuspended in 1 ml medium/2–3 brains. The cell suspensions were transferred to
poly-L-lysin-precoated 75-cm2 cell culture flasks in a total volume of 10 ml each
and incubated at 37 �C and 5% CO2. After 1 and 7 days of culturing, the medium
was changed. After 7 additional days of culturing, microglial cells were selectively
detached by carefully knocking against the flask. Suspended microglia cells were
pelleted at 300g for 5 min at RT, before 60,000 cells in 250 ml medium were seeded
for further analysis. For immunocytochemistry and rRT–PCR experiments, cells
were seeded on poly-L-lysin-precoated coverslips and cytokine production in the
supernatants was assessed by ELISA as described above after treating the cells.
Therefore, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 �C and 5% CO2 after seeding to rest,
and stimulated with LPS (1 mg ml � 1) or LPS (1 mg ml � 1) and FXII (60 nM),
or not stimulated for 1 additional day. Astrocyte cell cultures were obtained from
WT mice on postnatal days 1–3 as described51. In brief, mice were killed by
decapitation, their brains were transferred to Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution and the
meninges were removed. After preparation of the cortex, tissue was collected in
13.5 ml Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution and incubated for 15 min at 37 �C with
1.5 ml DNAse I and 1.5 ml trypsin 2.5%. Cells were mechanically dissociated
and filtered through a 45-mm cell strainer. Then, 4.5 � 106 astrocytes were
cultured in 75-cm2 flasks in astrocytes medium (1 � minimum essential
medium, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 33.3 mM glucose, 10% horse serum and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin). The medium was changed 24 h later and twice per week
thereafter. When reaching a confluent layer, astrocytes were trypsinized with 0.25%
trypsin and EDTA, and frozen in freezing medium (astrocyte medium and 10%
dimethyl sulfoxide). Cells were defrosted and cultured on poly-D-lysine-coated
coverslips for 2 weeks in astrocyte medium at 37 �C and 5% CO2 for further
analysis as described for microglia.
Patients. Fresh blood samples were obtained from 260 MS patients referred to
the Departments of Neurology at the University Hospital Wu
¨rzburg and the
University of Mu
¨nster. MS diagnosis was made according to the revised criteria
of McDonald et al.57 Of the patients included in the study, 87 had not received
immunomodulatory treatment except for corticosteroids, with the last dose
administered at least 3 months before study entry. In addition, we included 173
patients who had received different immunomodulatory therapies (glatiramer
acetate, interferons, fingolimod, natalizumab, teriflunomide and mitoxantrone). All
patients gave informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
a protocol approved by the Ethics Committees of the Universities of Wu
¨rzburg and
Mu
¨nster. Blood (10–20 ml) was collected by venous puncture using a tourniquet.
In parallel, 130 sex- and age-matched HDs were included in the study. FXII activity
of plasma samples was determined with an automated blood coagulation system
(Siemens Healthcare, Eschborn, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The percentage of FXII activity was calculated in comparison with
standard human plasma and FXII-deficient plasma (Siemens Healthcare, Eschborn,
Germany).
Statistical methods. EAE data were analysed by the non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U-test. To compare the mean day of onset and maximal score,
the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test was used. Paired data were evaluated by the
Student’s t-test. Mann–Whitney U-test for parametric data without normality data
sets was used. In the case of multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by post hoc analysis using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or
Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn post hoc analysis was used. Data were analysed
using Prism 5.04 (Graph Pad, USA), and the values of probability (P)o0.05 were
considered as statistically significant. The level of significance was labelled as
NS (not significant), *Po0.05, **Po0.01 or ***Po0.001. In vitro and in vivo
data are expressed as mean±s.e.m.)from at least three independent experiments,
unless otherwise indicated. The number of animals (n ¼ 12) necessary to detect a
standardized effect size on EAE score Z0.5 (WT mice versus F12 � / � mice)
was calculated via a priori sample size analysis with the following assumptions:
a ¼ 0.05, b ¼ 0.2 (power 80%), mean and s.d. 20% of the mean (StatMate 2.0;
Prism 5.03, Graph Pad). To compare FXII activity in patients, analysis of variance
was used.
