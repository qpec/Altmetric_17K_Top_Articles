Background
Both behavioural support (including brief advice and counselling) and pharmacotherapies (including nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT), varenicline and bupropion) are effective in helping people to stop smoking. Combining both treatment approaches is recom-
mended where possible, but the size of the treatment effect with different combinations and in different settings and populations is
unclear.
Objectives
To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medication to aid smoking cessation, compared to a minimal intervention
or usual care, and to identify whether there are different effects depending on characteristics of the treatment setting, intervention,
population treated, or take-up of treatment.
Search methods
We searchedthe Cochrane TobaccoAddictionGroupSpecialisedRegisterin July2015 forrecords with anymention of pharmacotherapy,
including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline.
Selection criteria
Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support for smoking
cessation, compared to a control receiving usual care or brief advice or less intensive behavioural support. We excluded trials recruiting
only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.
Data collection and analysis
Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by two authors. Data
was extracted by one author and checked by another.
The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition
of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

 Main results
Fifty-three studies with a total of more than 25,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. A large proportion of studies recruited
people in healthcare settings or with specific health needs. Most studies provided NRT. Behavioural support was typically provided by
specialists in cessation counselling, who offered between four and eight contact sessions. The planned maximum duration of contact
was typically more than 30 minutes but less than 300 minutes. Overall, studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, and findings were
not sensitive to the exclusion of any of the six studies rated at high risk of bias in one domain. One large study (the Lung Health
Study) contributed heterogeneity due to a substantially larger treatment effect than seen in other studies (RR 3.88, 95% CI 3.35 to
4.50). Since this study used a particularly intensive intervention which included extended availability of nicotine gum, multiple group
sessions and long term maintenance and recycling contacts, the results may not be comparable with the interventions used in other
studies, and hence it was not pooled in other analyses. Based on the remaining 52 studies (19,488 participants) there was high quality
evidence (using GRADE) for a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural treatment compared to usual care, brief advice
or less intensive behavioural support (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.98) with moderate statistical heterogeneity (I² = 36%).
The pooled estimate for 43 trials that recruited participants in healthcare settings (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.18) was higher than for
eight trials with community-based recruitment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76). Compared to the first version of the review, previous
weak evidence of differences in other subgroup analyses has disappeared. We did not detect differences between subgroups defined by
motivation to quit, treatment provider, number or duration of support sessions, or take-up of treatment.
Authors’ conclusions
Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural support increase smoking cessation success compared to a minimal
intervention or usual care. Updating this review with an additional 12 studies (5,000 participants) did not materially change the effect
estimate. Although trials differed in the details of their populations and interventions, we did not detect any factors that modified
treatment effects apart from the recruitment setting. We did not find evidence from indirect comparisons that offering more intensive
behavioural support was associated with larger treatment effects.

Does a combination of stop smoking medication and behavioural support help smokers to stop?
Background
Behavioural support (such as brief advice and counselling) and medications (including varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement
therapies like patches or gum) help people quit smoking. Many guidelines recommend combining medication and behavioural support
to help people stop smoking, but it is unclear if some combinations are more effective than others, or if the combination of medication
and behavioural support works better in some settings or groups than in others.
Study Characteristics
In July 2015 we searched for studies which tested combinations of behavioural support and medication to help smokers to stop
compared to usual care or brief behavioural support. People who smoked were recruited mainly in health care settings. Some trials only
enrolled people who said they wanted to try to quit at that time, but some included people who weren’t planning to quit. Studies had
to report how many people had stopped smoking after at least six months.
Results
We found 53 studies with a total of over 25,000 participants. One very large study found a large benefit. It gave intensive support
including nicotine gum, multiple group sessions, and long term contact to help people stay quit or encourage additional quit attempts.
Because it was not typical of most treatment programmes, it was not included when we estimated the likely benefit, although it shows
that such intensive support can be very effective. Based on the remaining 52 studies, we found high quality evidence that using a
combination of behavioural support and medication increases the chances of successfully quitting after at least six months. Combining
the results suggests that the chance of success is increased by 70 to 100 percent compared to just brief advice or support. There was
some evidence that the effect tended to be larger when participants were recruited in healthcare settings. There was no clear evidence
that providing more contact increased the number of people who quit smoking at six months or longer. .

 GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1 Baseline risk calculated as mean control group risk for both comparisons
2 Some evidence of asymmetry in a funnel plot; excess of small trials detecting larger effects. However, in a sensitivity analysis, removing
smaller studies did not markedly decrease the pooled estimate.
3 Downgraded due to indirectness. As this study had a particularly intensive intervention, the results may not be generalisable to real
world treatment programmes.

Giving up smoking is the most effective way for people who smoke
toreduce theirriskof smokingrelateddisease andpremature death.
Behavioural support and pharmacotherapies help people to stop
smoking. Behavioural support interventions include written ma-
terials containing advice on quitting, multisession group therapy
programmes or individual counselling sessions in person or by
telephone. Providing standard self-help materials alone seems to
have a small effect on success, but there is evidence of a benefit of
individually tailored self-helpmaterials or more intensive advice or
counselling (Lancaster 2005; Hartmann-Boyce 2014). Nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion, cytisine and
nortriptyline all increase the long-term success of quit attempts
(Cahill 2013). Many clinical practice guidelines recommend that
healthcare providers offer people who are prepared to make a quit
attempt both classes of intervention on the basis that they may
have an additive or even multiplicative effect. This approach as-
sumes that the two types of treatment have complementary modes
of action, and may independently improve the chances of main-
taining long-term abstinence. However, it is recognised that many
people who use pharmacotherapy will not take up the offer of
intensive behavioural support. NRT products are available over
the counter (OTC) without a prescription in many countries, and
people who purchase them may not access any specific behavioural
support. People who obtain prescriptions for pharmacotherapies
are more likely to receive some support, but this may be focused
on explaining proper use of the drug rather than on behavioural
counselling. Surveys suggest that the proportion of people who use
both types of treatment when attempting to stop smoking is low
(Shiffman 2008; Kotz 2009b). The aim of this review is to assess
the the effect of the combined intervention of pharmacotherapy
and behavioural support, compared to using neither type of treat-
ment, or receiving only brief advice or behavioural support.
Other Cochrane Tobacco Addiction reviews have evaluated the
separate effects of behavioural and pharmaceutical interventions.
In order to quantify these individual effects, these reviews restrict
inclusion to trials where the intervention under investigation is
unconfounded. By unconfounded, we mean that trials of phar-
macotherapies had to provide the same amount of behavioural
support (materials, advice, counselling contacts) to all participants
whether they receive active treatment or a placebo or no medica-
tion. Likewise, when behavioural interventions are evaluated there
must be no systematic difference in the offer of medications be-
tween the active and control arms of the trial.
The findings from reviews of unconfounded trials support the use
of combined pharmacological and behavioural therapy, but do not
provide a direct estimate of the size of the benefit to be expected
from combining the two types of treatment. The aim of this re-
view is to synthesize the evidence from trials that directly evaluate
the use of an intervention combining pharmacotherapy and be-
havioural support, where the control condition includes neither
pharmacotherapy nor the same intensity of behavioural support.
The control will involve either usual care, or brief advice. If the
pharmacotherapy and the behavioural support components exert
independent effects on successful cessation, these trials might be
expected to give considerably larger treatment effects than would
be achieved from either the behavioural or the medication com-
ponent alone. However, other factors may affect the size of this
effect. In particular, pragmatic trials of interventions in healthcare
settings may find smaller effects than placebo-controlled pharma-
cotherapy studies in research settings, as delivery of the interven-
tion components may be lower. To address this, we set out to
identify moderators that might lead to heterogeneity in effects of
combined treatment, including the motivation of participants, the
nature of the treatment setting, and the type of therapist. We also
aimed to categorize by the intensity of behavioural support, based
on number and duration of contacts, in order to evaluate whether
the intensity of the behavioural support affected treatment suc-
cess. Previous meta-analyses have suggested that there is a dose
response, with more contacts improving outcomes amongst peo-
ple receiving pharmacotherapy (Fiore 2008 table 6.23). We also
considered the degree to which participants used both medication
and behavioural components as a possible explanation for any het-
erogeneity.
For this review we identified trials of interventions that combined
pharmacotherapies (including NRT, varenicline, bupropion, cyti-
sine, or nortriptyline) with behavioural support (tailored mate-
rials, brief advice, in person or telephone counselling) and that
compared outcomes against a control group that received either
usual care or a brief cessation component (i.e. advice to quit but
no other behavioural support or medication common to the in-
tervention). A companion review will evaluate whether more in-
tensive behavioural support improves cessation outcomes for peo-
ple using pharmacotherapy, using the direct evidence from trials
that compare different levels of behavioural support for people re-
ceiving any type of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation (Stead
2015).
O B J E C T I V E S
To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medi-
cation to aid smoking cessation, compared to using neither, and to
identify whether there are different effects depending on charac-
teristics of the treatment setting, intervention, population treated,
or take-up of treatment.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
5
Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions for smoking cessation (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Types of studies
Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials. We did not
exclude studies on the basis of publication status or language of
publication.
Types of participants
We included trials that recruited people who smoke in any setting,
with the exception of trials which only recruit pregnant women or
adolescents. These populations are considered in specific reviews.
Trial participants did not need to be selected according to their
interest in quitting or their suitability for pharmacotherapy.
Types of interventions
We included interventions for increasing smoking cessation that
included behavioural support and the availability of pharma-
cotherapy, regardless of type of pharmacotherapy. We excluded
trials where fewer than 20% of participants were eligible for or
used pharmacotherapy. The provision of written information or
brief instructions on correct use of the pharmacotherapy was not
regarded as behavioural support. The control group should not
have been systematically offered pharmacotherapy but we did not
exclude studies where some control group participants obtained
medication from other sources. Control group participants could
be offered usual care, self-help materials or brief advice on quit-
ting, but support had to have been of a lower intensity than that
given to intervention participants.
Types of outcome measures
Following the standard methodology of the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group, the primary outcome is smoking cessation at
the longest follow-up using the strictest definition of abstinence,
that is, preferring sustained over point prevalence abstinence and
using biochemically validated rates where available. We also noted
any other abstinence outcomes reported and conducted sensitivity
analyses to test if the choice of outcome affected the results of
meta-analysis. We excluded trials reporting less than six months
follow-up from the start of intervention.
Search methods for identification of studies
We identified trials from the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Spe-
cialised Register (the Register). This is generated from regular
searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for trials of
smoking cessation or prevention interventions. The most recent
search of the Register was in July 2015. At the time of the search
the Register included the results of searches of the CENTRAL
to issue 4, 2015; MEDLINE (via OVID) from 1946 to update
20150501; EMBASE (via OVID) from 1974 to week 201519 and
PsycINFO (via OVID) from 1967 to update 20150506. See the
Tobacco Addiction Group Module in the Cochrane Library for
full search strategies and a list of other resources searched.
We searched the Register for records with any mention of pharma-
cotherapy in title, abstract or indexing terms (see Appendix 1 for
the final search strategy). We checkedtitlesandabstractstoidentify
trials of interventions for smoking cessation that combined phar-
macotherapy with behavioural support. We also checked the ex-
cluded study lists of reviews of behavioural therapies and pharma-
cotherapy for trials excluded because pharmacotherapy was con-
founded with additional behavioural support compared to the
control group. Trials with a factorial design that varied both phar-
macotherapy and behavioural conditions were also considered for
inclusion. We also tested an additional MEDLINE search using
the smoking related terms and design limits used in the standard
register search and the MeSH terms ‘combined modality therapy’
or (Drug Therapy and (exp Behavior therapy or exp Counseling)).
This search retrieved a subset of records already screened for the
inclusion in the Register and was used to assess whether it might
retrieve studies where there was no mention of a specific cessation
pharmacotherapy in the title, abstract or indexing. We did not
find any additional studies from this.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
LS identified potentially relevant trial reports according to the
criteria above. Areas of uncertainty were discussed with PK and
TL. LS and either TL or PK extracted data.
Data extraction and management
We extracted the following information from trial reports:
• Country and setting of trial
• Method of recruitment, including any selection by
motivation to quit
• Method of sequence generation
• Method of allocation concealment
• Characteristics of participants including gender, age,
smoking rate
• Characteristics of intervention deliverer
• Intervention components: type, dose and duration of
pharmacotherapy, type and duration of behavioural support
• Control group components
• Outcomes: primary outcome length of follow-up and
definition of abstinence; other follow-ups and abstinence
definitions; use of biochemical validation; loss to follow-up.

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Studieswere evaluatedonthe basisof the randomizationprocedure
and allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data assessment
and any other bias (Schulz 2002a; Schulz 2002b; Higgins 2011).
Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.
Measures of treatment effect
Trial effects were expressed as a relative risk (RR): (quitters in
treatment group/total randomized to treatment group)/ (quitters
in control group/total randomized to control group).
Dealing with missing data
Numbers lost to follow-up were reported by group where available.
Following standard Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group meth-
ods, people lost to follow-up were assumed to be smoking and
included in the denominators for calculating the RR. Any deaths
during follow-up were reported separately and excluded from de-
nominators.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We considered pooling all trials comparing combined therapy to
usual care/minimal intervention control if heterogeneity as as-
sessed by the I² statistic (Higgins 2003) was less than 50%.
Data synthesis
For groups of trials where meta-analysis was judged appropriate,
relative risks were pooled using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect
model, and a pooled estimate with 95% confidence intervals re-
ported.
If trials had more than one intervention condition we compared
the most intensive combination of behavioural support and phar-
macotherapy to the control in the main analysis.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We undertook planned subgroup analyses by setting, participant
selection, intervention provider, number of sessions, total duration
of contact, and take-up of treatment. The subgroups are listed
below.
Setting
• Recruited in healthcare settings
• Recruited as community volunteers
Participant selection
• Selected for willingness to make a quit attempt/ high take-
up of pharmacotherapy
• Not selected for interest in quitting/ low take-up of
pharmacotherapy
• Not explicitly selected but study procedures and participant
characteristics suggested that most participants were willing to
make a quit attempt
Provider
• Usual care provider
• Specialist in smoking cessation
• Peer group counsellor (ex-smoker)
Intensity
We conducted alternative analyses of intensity adapted from two
of the categories used in the US Guidelines (Fiore 2008). We used
planned contact time and number of sessions where possible. If
this was variable or unclear we used any report of actual delivery.
We categorised total amount of contact time as zero (if the only
support was sent by mail), 1 to 30 minutes (collapsing one to three
and 4 to 30 US guideline categories), 31 to 90, 91 to 300, and
over 300 minutes.
Number of person-to-person sessions was categorised as zero, one
to three (instead of zero to one and two to three as used in US
guidelines), four to eight and over eight sessions.
Treatment take-up (compliance with medication and
behavioural support)
We expected this group of trials to include some pragmatic studies
where participants are offered treatment but did not use all the
components offered. After pilot testing, we categorised studies into
three groups:
• High - over 70% starting pharmacotherapy and receiving at
least one session of support (where applicable)
• Moderate - Over 30% starting pharmacotherapy and over
50% receiving at least one session of support
• Low - less than 30% starting pharmacotherapy or less than
50% receive at least one session of support
We did not separate trials using different pharmacotherapies in
initial analyses but we considered the type of pharmacotherapy as
an explanation for remaining heterogeneity.
Where there was evidence from subgroup analyses of clinically
relevant differences between categories in any of the subgroups
above, we used meta regression (Stata) to explore whether any
of the characteristics were effect modifiers, including each of the
characteristics as categorical (dummy) variables. To assess possi-
ble effect modification according to the intensity of intervention
7

 received, we also included number of sessions, amount of con-
tact time and take-up together in a single meta-regression analy-
sis. Since these analyses were not pre-specified they are hypothesis
generating only.
Sensitivity analysis
We considered the sensitivity of the results to changes in the cut-
off range for categories outlined above. If data for multiple out-
comes were provided, we conducted sensitivity analyses to test if
the choice of outcome affected the results. We also conducted sen-
sitivity analyses removing smaller studies to assess possible impact
of publication bias.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The original register search retrieved approximately 2200 records,
approximately 400 additional records were screened for this up-
date. Most of the records that did report trials of interventions for
smoking cessation were not relevant because they were placebo-
controlled trials of pharmacotherapies, in which the behavioural
support was the same for intervention and control conditions. We
identified 41 studies for inclusion in the original review and a
further 12 for the update. Many included studies were identified
via more than one study report. All reports related to a study are
listed in the reference section with the primary report used for data
extraction identified. Trials are identified by the first author and
year of publication of the main study report. A further 90 studies
are listed as excluded.
Included studies
We identified 53 studies that met all inclusion criteria with a total
of more than 25,000 participants. Most have been published since
2000, with the earliest published in 1988. One trial had almost
6000 participants (Lung Health Study) and one over 2000 (Hollis
2007). Thirty-one trials had more than 100 participants in the
intervention arm and most of the remainder had more than 50 in
the intervention arm. Twelve trials are new for this update (Murray
2013; Prochaska 2014; Rigotti 2014; Stockings 2014; Winhusen
2014; Bernstein 2015; Haas 2015; Hickman 2015; Lee 2015;
Peckham 2015; Perez-Tortosa 2015)
About half the studies were conducted in the USA. Of the others
there were five from Canada (Wilson 1988; Reid 2003; Ratner
2004; Chouinard 2005; Lee 2015), fourfromAustralia(Vial 2002;
Wakefield 2004; Baker 2006; Stockings 2014), three from Den-
mark (Tonnesen 2006; Villebro2008; Thomsen 2010), three from
Spain (Juarranz Sanz 1998; Rodriguez 2003; Perez-Tortosa 2015),
four from the UK (Molyneux 2003; Binnie 2007; Murray 2013;
Peckham 2015) and one each from Brazil (Otero 2006), Italy
(Segnan 1991), the Netherlands (Kotz 2009), Sweden (Sadr Azodi
2009), Japan (Hanioka 2010) and Hong Kong (Chan 2010).
Details of can be found in the Characteristics of included studies
table. Appendix 2 tabulates the following study characteristics:
setting and provider; selection by motivation; number and total
duration of contact categories; and level of take-up of treatment.
Trial setting and recruitment
A high proportion of trials were conducted in healthcare set-
tings and/or recruited people with specific health needs. These
included ten trials in general (non psychiatric) hospital inpatients
(Simon 1997; Lewis 1998; Vial 2002; Molyneux 2003; Reid 2003;
Chouinard 2005; Mohiuddin 2007; Brandstein 2011; Murray
2013; Rigotti 2014), one in emergency room patients (Bernstein
2015), five in patients awaiting admission for surgery (Ratner
2004; Villebro2008; SadrAzodi 2009; Thomsen2010; Lee2015),
three in psychiatric hospital inpatients (Stockings 2014; Prochaska
2014; Hickman 2015), three for other mental health patients
(Baker 2006; Hall 2006; Peckham 2015), four in outpatient sub-
stance abuse treatment programmes (Cooney 2007; Reid 2008;
Carmody 2012; Winhusen 2014), one in an AIDS clinic (Wewers
2000), two for people with cancer (Wakefield 2004; Duffy 2006),
and one for cancer survivors (Emmons 2005). Eight trials re-
cruited patients of primary care clinics (Wilson 1988; Ockene
1991; Segnan 1991; Juarranz Sanz 1998; Katz 2004; Perez-Tortosa
2015 (diabetic patients); Haas 2015) or primary care and women’s
health clinics (Wewers 2009), and two recruited dental clinic pa-
tients (Binnie 2007; Hanioka 2010). One recruited Chinese men
with erectile dysfunction (Chan 2010). Three recruited people
identified as having mild airway obstruction (Lung Health Study;
Kotz 2009) or COPD (Tonnesen 2006). One recruited employees
at annual occupational health checks (Rodriguez 2003). Okuyemi
2007 recruited residents of low-income public housing depart-
ments. Schauffler 2001 recruited members of health maintenance
organisations and Velicer 2006 recruited Veterans Administration
medical centre patients, in both cases using proactive telephone
contact. An 2006 recruited Veterans Administration medical cen-
tre patients by mail. Hall 2002, Otero 2006 and McCarthy 2008
recruited community volunteers motivated to quit and Hollis
2007 recruited callers to a quitline seeking cessation assistance.
Selection by motivation to quit
We tried to classify trials according to whether or not willingness
to make a quit attempt was required for study eligibility. In some
studies motivation was an explicit requirement, including four tri-
als that enrolled motivated volunteers for pharmacotherapy trials
8

 involving placebos (Hall 2002; Tonnesen 2006; McCarthy 2008;
Kotz 2009). In some study reports there was no mention of mo-
tivation as a requirement for inclusion. Some of these trials did
recruit some people with no plans to quit smoking. In others, the
method of recruitment or the requirement to adhere to a protocol
made it seem likely that only people interested in attempting to
quit would enrol. We grouped the studies as follows:
• Motivation required (22 trials, 42%): Simon 1997; Lewis
1998; Wewers 2000; Hall 2002; Vial 2002; Reid 2003;
Rodriguez 2003; An 2006; Baker 2006; Otero 2006; Tonnesen
2006; Cooney 2007; Hollis 2007; McCarthy 2008; Reid 2008;
Kotz 2009: Chan 2010; Hanioka 2010; Carmody 2012; Rigotti
2014; Winhusen 2014; Peckham 2015.
• Motivation not required but participants likely to have been
interested in quitting (10 trials, 19%): Juarranz Sanz 1998;
Molyneux 2003; Wakefield 2004; Mohiuddin 2007; Okuyemi
2007; Villebro 2008; Sadr Azodi 2009, Wewers 2009;
Brandstein 2011; Haas 2015.
• Not selected by motivation (21 trials, 40%): Wilson 1988;
Ockene 1991; Segnan 1991; Lung Health Study; Schauffler
2001; Katz 2004; Ratner 2004; Chouinard 2005; Emmons
2005; Duffy 2006; Hall 2006; Velicer 2006; Binnie 2007;
Thomsen 2010; Hickman 2015; Lee 2015; Murray 2013;
Bernstein 2015; Perez-Tortosa 2015, Prochaska 2014; Stockings
2014.
Participant characteristics
Trials typically had between 35 to 65% female participants. Two
trials recruited only women (Wewers 2009; Thomsen 2010) and
one only men (Chan 2010). Five trials in the US Veterans Admin-
istration medical system had higher proportions of men (Simon
1997; An 2006; Velicer 2006; Cooney 2007; Carmody 2012) as
did a Spanish workplace trial (Rodriguez 2003). The average age
typically ranged from low 40’s to mid 50’s. The age was younger
in a trial amongst survivors of childhood cancer (Emmons 2005).
Provider characteristics
Most counselling and support was provided by specialist cessation
counsellors or trained trial personnel. In a small subgroup the
intervention was largely given by usual care providers including
general practitioners/family physicians (Ockene 1991; Segnan
1991; Juarranz Sanz 1998; Perez-Tortosa 2015), dental hygienists
(Binnie 2007), dentists and dental hygienist (Hanioka 2010) or
occupational physicians (Rodriguez 2003). Two studies used peer
group counsellors (Emmons 2005; Wewers 2000) and one used
trained lay advisers (Wewers 2009).
Intervention characteristics
The typical intervention involved multiple contacts with a spe-
cialist cessation adviser or counsellor, with most participants using
some pharmacotherapy and receiving multiple contacts. However,
there was a great deal of variation, including some interventions
which involved making pharmacotherapy and behavioural com-
ponents available to a large population in which take-up of treat-
ment was low (Schauffler 2001), or providing a brief intervention
to all participants and offering stepped care for those willing to set a
quit date (Reid 2003; Katz 2004). One intervention was delivered
entirely by mail or prerecorded phone messages, using an expert
system for tailoring contact (Velicer 2006) and two by telephone
counselling alone (Hollis 2007; Haas 2015). All others included
some face-to-face contact but additional sessions was sometimes
provided by telephone. More than half the trials (n = 28, 53%)
offered between four and eight sessions and a quarter (n = 13) over
eight sessions. The modal category for contact time was 91 to 300
minutes (n = 22, 42%), with 17 (32%) offering between 31 and
90 minutes and eight (15%) over 300 minutes. We categorised
interventions according to the maximum planned contact unless
session duration was not described, so the typical time per partic-
ipant would have been smaller, even in studies where the take-up
of treatment was high.
The treatment offered to the control group typically involved brief
advice and self-help materials.
Excluded studies
We list 90 studies as excluded. In most of these there was no dif-
ference between treatment conditions in the use of pharmacother-
apy, and the trial tested different types or amounts of adjunct be-
havioural support. Trials of this type contribute to a separate re-
view (Stead 2015). A small number of studies did not report six
month or longer follow-up. Reasons for exclusion can be found in
the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
Risk of bias in included studies
Figure 1 presents review authors’ judgements about each risk of
bias item as percentages across all included studies. We did not
judge any studies to be at risk of ’other’ bias.

Risk of bias graph: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item presented as
percentages across all included studies.
Allocation
All studies reported that treatment allocation was random, with
more than half explicitly describing an adequate method of gener-
ating the randomization schedule. One cluster randomized study
was judged at high risk of bias because the unit of assignment
was the ward, and an imbalance in the type of ward assigned to
each condition lead to an imbalance in participant characteris-
tics (Murray 2013). Thirty (57%) reported a procedure for al-
location concealment that we judged to be at a low risk of bias.
Three studies were judged at high risk of selection bias (Wilson
1988; Duffy 2006; Perez-Tortosa 2015), two of which were cluster
randomized. The participants in Wilson 1988 were recruited by
receptionists who could not be blind to practice condition, and
there were baseline differences in consent rate and in motivation
to quit between conditions. Some participants in Perez-Tortosa
2015 were recruited in health centres after allocation. Duffy 2006
recruited cancer patients with either smoking, alcohol or depres-
sion problems, and had more smokers in the intervention group
suggesting possible recruitment bias. The other 20 (38%) trial re-
ports gave too little information about allocation procedures to be
certain that the risk of bias was low, and were hence judged to be
at unclear risk of bias in this domain.
Blinding
We did not formally evaluate blinding of participants, providers or
other personnel. It was almost always unclear whether or not par-
ticipants would have known that they were in a control condition,
but most controls did include advice and support for smoking
cessation. Providers could not have been blind to treatment con-
dition. Self-reported smoking status was biochemically validated
at longest follow-up in 35 studies, with twelve of these measuring
cotinine and the remainder carbon monoxide (CO). Seven studies
either did not collect samples at final follow-up (Sadr Azodi 2009;
Bernstein 2015; Lee 2015) or did not obtain samples from enough
participants and did not report validated quit rates (Reid 2003;
Katz 2004; Villebro 2008; Hickman 2015). Eleven studies did not
attempt any type of validation (Ockene 1991; Schauffler 2001;
Emmons 2005; An 2006; Duffy 2006; Otero 2006; Velicer 2006;
Hollis 2007; Thomsen 2010; Brandstein 2011; Haas 2015).
Incomplete outcome data
We classified two studies at high risk of attrition bias. In Hanioka
2010 a number of control participants declined consent once told
their treatment group. In Perez-Tortosa 2015 a number of partic-
ipants were excluded from analyses because of a lack of baseline
data, and losses to follow-up were also excluded from reported
analyses. In other studies, later dropouts were counted as contin-
uing smokers, and all other trials were classified as low risk of bias
due to loss to follow-up. Most trials lost less than 20% of each
condition. There were a small number of trials in which the pro-
portion lost to follow-up was over 20% and also differed between
groups. Of the trials at potential risk of bias, Binnie 2007 and
Villebro 2008 had high and differential losses, but since both were
small trials any effect on the meta-analysis of different assumptions
would be small. Hall 2006 and Hollis 2007 both had relatively
high losses but both reported that different assumptions about the
smoking status of those lost to follow-up would not be likely to
alter their relative effects.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Combined
pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions for smoking
cessation
A pooled estimate combining all 53 included studies using a Man-
tel-Haenszel fixed-effect model had a very high level of heterogene-
ity (I² = 70%, data not shown). This heterogeneity was attributable
to the Lung Health Study which showed a very strong intervention
effect (relative risk [RR] 3.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.35
to 4.50). This study had a particularly intensive intervention; the
10

 behavioural component was a group-based 12 session course, and
nicotine gum was available without charge for six months. Re-
moving this study from the meta-analysis reduced heterogeneity
(I² = 36%), and a benefit of intervention was still detected (RR
1.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.98, 19319 participants, Figure 2, Analysis
1.1, Summary of findings for the main comparison). Only three
trials (Wakefield 2004; Ratner 2004; Okuyemi 2007) had lower
quit rates in the intervention than the control group and all had
wide confidence intervals.

 There was some evidence of asymmetry in a funnel plot; there
was an excess of small trials detecting larger effects, suggesting the
possibility of publication or other bias. In a sensitivity analysis,
removing smaller studies did not markedly decrease the pooled
estimate.
Subgroup analyses
Appendix 2 lists study characteristics used for subgroup analyses
for each included study. All the subgroup analyses reported below
exclude the Lung Health Study.
Effect of setting
The pooled estimate for trials that recruited participants in health-
care settings (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.18, 43 trials, 13863 par-
ticipants) was significantly higher than that for trials that recruited
volunteers in other settings (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76, 8
trials, 4906 participants) (Analysis 2.1). There were more small
trials with large and significant effects in the healthcare subgroup,
and a number of these had notably low quit rates in the control
arms.
Effect of selection by motivation to quit
We did not detect evidence that the relative effect of the inter-
vention differed according to whether participants were prepared
to make a quit attempt or not (Analysis 3.1). The subgroup of
participants selected for motivation had a slightly larger estimated
effect (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.15, 22 trials, 7088 participants)
than the ’Not selected’ subgroup (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.80,
20 trials, 10138 participants); the largest effect estimate was in the
subgroup of 10 trials that did not explicitly select for motivation,
but that seemed unlikely to recruit unmotivated participants (RR
2.71, 95% CI 2.11 to 3.49, 2262 participants). There was also
considerable heterogeneity in this subgroup (I² = 61%), for which
there was no obvious explanation. In a meta-regression, motiva-
tion to quit was not found to be an effect modifier (p = 0.09).
In this update there was no longer any sign that average control
group quit rates were higher in the more motivated populations.
Effect of provider
The behavioural intervention was provided by specialists in ces-
sation counselling in 39 of the trials. In nine trials, the support/
counselling was given by a non specialist healthcare professional
involved in usual care. In a further two trials behavioural support
was provided by a peer counsellor, one of which was a very small
pilot (Wewers 2000). One trial used trained lay advisers (Wewers
2009). One trial (Velicer 2006) had no person-to-person contact
and behavioural support was provided by an ’expert system’ gener-
ating individualised written materials and prerecorded telephone
messages. There was no important difference between the special-
ist care subgroup (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.64 to 1.99, I² = 25%, 39
trials, 12252 participants) and the subgroup where counselling
was linked to usual care (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.43, I² =
54%, 9 trials, 5112 participants) (Analysis 4.1). In the previous
version of the review there was a difference by provider that might
have been attributable to confounding with take-up of treatment
and duration of contact. For this update, we did three separate ex-
ploratory meta-regressions controlling for type of provider, take-
up of treatment and duration of contact; none was an effect mod-
ifier (p-values 0.37, 0.08 and 0.46 respectively).
Effect of intensity
We categorised trials by intended number of sessions and planned
total duration of contact. Not all interventions prescribed a fixed
number or standardised length of sessions, and not all participants
received all planned contacts. Unsurprisingly there was some cor-
relation between number of sessions and duration of contact; for
example, all interventions that intended to provide at least 300
minutes of contact had at least four sessions scheduled. Where
there was personal contact, there was only weak evidence that
studies offering more sessions had larger effects (Analysis 5.1); the
subgroup of trials offering eight or more sessions had the largest
estimate (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.68, 13 trials, 2270 partici-
pants) but CIs overlapped. One to three and four to eight session
categories had almost the same effects.There was no clear evidence
that increasing the duration of personal contact increased the ef-
fect either (Analysis 6.1). Estimates for each subgroup overlapped.
There was more heterogeneity in the 31 to 90 minute category (I²
= 55%), partially attributable to Juarranz Sanz 1998, (RR 9.34).
In an exploratory meta-regression neither number (p = 0.85) nor
duration (p = 0.46) alone or in combination (p = 0.73) were effect
modifiers, nor was take-up in combination with these (p = 0.36).
Effect of differences in treatment take-up
Only three trials were classified as ’low take-up of treatment’ (Katz
2004; Reid 2003; Schauffler 2001), and in these the estimated
effect was smaller, whilst there was little difference between the
18 that were moderate and 29 that were high (Analysis 7.1). As
noted above in the analyses of intensity, there was no longer any
evidence from meta-regression of an effect of intensity even in the
subgroup of ’high take-up’ trials.
Direct tests of intensity of support
Two trials compared multiple intensities of support. In both cases
the more intensive condition was compared to the control in the
13

 primary analysis. Hollis 2007 offered up to four additional tele-
phone calls in the intensive counselling condition compared to a
30 to 40 minute motivational interview and a single follow-up call
in the moderate condition but this did not significantly increase
quit rates. Higher intensity participants had on average only about
14 minutes more contact. Otero 2006 randomized to one, two,
three or four weekly hour-long sessions but pooled reported out-
comes for one to two and three to four sessions. Direct compar-
isons of different intensities of behavioural therapy as adjuncts to
pharmacotherapy are covered in a separate review (Stead 2015).
D I S C U S S I O N
Behavioural support and certain pharmacotherapies increase the
chance of successful cessation for people trying to quit. These
effects have been confirmed by reviews of trials that synthesise
the results of trials of both modalities of treatment. Nicotine
replacement therapy (Stead 2012), bupropion and nortriptyline
(Hughes 2014) and varenicline and cytisine (Cahill 2012) increase
quit rates. Group therapy (Stead 2005), individual counselling
(Lancaster 2005) and telephone counselling (Stead 2013) have all
been shown to be successful ways of delivering behavioural sup-
port for cessation with some support for individually tailored writ-
ten self-help materials (Hartmann-Boyce 2014). The effects of the
two treatment modalities are largely assumed to be independent,
although behavioural support may influence correct use of medi-
cation. Although guidelines support combining approaches where
possible, the size of effect that might be expected when both ther-
apies are combined has not been clear.
Summary of main results
In this review of 53 trials evaluating interventions that combine
pharmacotherapy with behavioural support, we found, unsurpris-
ingly, that the combination improves quit rates compared to no
treatment or a minimum intervention (see Summary of findings
for the main comparison). This finding is in accord with the ev-
idence that each type of intervention is effective when evaluated
independently. A strength of the evidence from these trials is that
the results are largely consistent, with little evidence of clinically
important heterogeneity even though they use a wide range of ap-
proaches in many different populations and settings.
One trial demonstrated a large benefit of a multimodal therapy.
The Lung Health Study, conducted in the early 1990s, achieved
a cessation rate of 35% at one year in the intervention group,
compared with 9% for the control. The investigators also reported
sustained benefits after five years, and demonstrated reduced mor-
tality in the intervention group. As noted above, this was a par-
ticularly intensive intervention. Participants were offered mainte-
nance sessions, and repeat treatment was available for those failing
to quit. In addition, all participants had mild airway impairment,
and intervention group participants were further randomized to
use a bronchodilator or placebo inhaler. This component might
have increased motivation for quitting, and the relatively high rates
of cessation in the control group would support this.
The pooled estimate for the remaining 52 trials (RR 1.83, 95% CI
1. 68 to 1.98) suggests that a combined intervention might typi-
cally increase cessation success by 70 to 100%. Most of the trials
in this review offered one or more types of NRT, or bupropion.
Based on estimates from Cochrane reviews of the effects for NRT
alone (pooled estimate from 117 trials RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.53 to
1.68, Stead 2012) and bupropion alone (pooled estimate from 44
trials, RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.76, Hughes 2014), the addi-
tional benefit from the behavioural component might seem small.
However it may be misleading to directly compare these estimates,
and we did not attempt any formal statistical comparison.
There are important differences between the trials included in this
review and typical pharmacotherapy studies that should be noted.
Pharmacotherapy trials included in meta-analyses typically have
a placebo control, but the control group also receives identical
behavioural support to the active therapy group. The intensity
may vary from brief advice on correct use of pharmacotherapy and
provision of self-help materials, to multiple counselling sessions.
The trial protocol may call for frequent contact with a clinical
research centre, even if counselling contact is limited. Participants
may have high expectations for the effect of treatment, but also
the knowledge that they could be receiving placebo. In contrast,
in the studies included in this review the control groups had lim-
ited support, but this typically involved advice that could be clas-
sified as a cessation intervention in other contexts. Additionally,
it was generally unclear whether controls would have known the
components of the active intervention and we did not attempt to
assess the risk of bias from lack of blinding. In almost all the trials,
intervention group participants would have known they were re-
ceiving active medication, but without the connotations of receiv-
ing a ’new’ drug. Apart from the small number of included trials
that were placebo-controlled factorial studies of medication and
behavioural components (Hall 2006; Tonnesen 2006; McCarthy
2008), trials in this review had pragmatic designs and the interven-
tion typically involved an offer of treatment. Actual use of med-
ication and take-up of a full programme of behavioural support
was not uniform across trials.
We had previously detected weak evidence for possible effect mod-
ifiers using subgroup analyses and meta-regression. For most of
the subgroups, any differential effects have become smaller and
were no longer evident in meta-regressions. We did find evidence
of larger effects when trials recruited participants in health care
settings. We did not find evidence that the type of provider, the
motivation of the participants, the intensity of behavioural sup-
port or the amount of support taken up by participants affected
the estimates of relative effects. Almost all of the interventions in
this review involved multiple sessions, with some studies providing
or offering more than eight sessions and as much as eight hours
14

 of contact, although the typical intensity was much lower. We no
longer detected evidence from indirect comparisons that increas-
ingcontactincreasedquitsuccess in the trialswith the highesttake-
up of treatment. Stronger evidence for a dose-response trend might
have been obscured by the multiple differences between trials. We
used meta-regression for exploratory analyses of some potential
effect modifiers but the relatively small number of trials and large
number of variables reduces the power of this approach. We might
not have been able to identify or quantify possible moderators. For
example, more intensive support might have been tested in ’hard
to treat’ populations but it is not clear how this might be charac-
terised. It seems unlikely that the number of supportive contacts
and their length would have absolutely no effect on outcome, but
our findings suggest that the added benefit from offering more
intensive support may be small. One possible explanation is that
the use of pharmacotherapy attenuates the importance of the be-
havioural support. Healthcare providers have an important role in
convincing smokers of the importance of attempting to quit and
making pharmacotherapy and behavioural support available. We
did not find evidence from indirect comparison that counselling
by trained specialists was critical for success; in fact the estimated
treatment effect was higher in the smaller group of trials where the
behavioural support was provided by non specialists, although we
do not think great importance should be attached to this finding.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
These trials have been undertaken in a very wide range of set-
tings using different providers of care and amongst different pop-
ulations. The populations include people with mental illness and
smoking related diseases. The relative homogeneity of their re-
sults therefore supports the general applicability of the evidence.
Although most of the trials provided one or more types of NRT,
and a small number offered bupropion, there is no reason to sup-
pose that the results would not apply to interventions that offered
varenicline.
Using a pharmacotherapy and accessing behavioural support will
increase the chance of giving up smoking, but people who smoke
are unlikely to use this combination when making a quit attempt.
A US survey in 2003 found that only 5.9% of those making a quit
attempt in the previous year had used combined behavioural and
pharmacologic treatment (Shiffman 2008). An English survey of
smokers between 2006 and 2012 found that 4.8% of people at-
tempting to quit smoking had used both a prescription pharma-
cotherapy and specialist behavioural support (Kotz 2014).
Quality of the evidence
The majority of studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk
of bias, and only five of the included studies were judged to be
at high risk of bias in one or more domains. The results of the
meta-analysis were not sensitive to the exclusion of any single trial.
Excluding studies that did not use biochemical validation did not
reduce the effect size. The largest study, Hollis 2007, was atypical
in that all contact was telephone-based, via a quitline (most other
studies included some face-to-face contact); it also had a potential
methodological weakness due to losses to follow-up and lack of
biochemical validation, although we did not judge these to put it
at a high risk of bias. Excluding this study did not alter the effect
estimate.
Potential biases in the review process
We used the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialised Register to
identify studies. The Register includes reports of trials identified
from the major bibliographic databases. There is no straightfor-
ward term for the type of intervention we were interested in, but
we screened any trial report that mentioned a pharmacotherapy.
It is possible that the Register does not include all relevant trial
reports or that we failed to identify some. Our methods for data
extraction and analysis are those used for other Cochrane reviews.
The practice of imputing missing data as smoking is standard
practice for primary and secondary research in smoking cessation
and has the advantage that absolute cessation rates are not inflated
by ignoring loss to follow-up. Bias in the relative effect will only
be introduced if misclassification differs for people who are lost
from the intervention condition compared to the control. If pro-
portionately more of those who are lost in the control group are
assumed to be smokers but have in fact quit then the treatment
effect would be overestimated.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The results of this review are broadly in agreement with other
reviews and guidelines (Hughes 1995; Reus 2008). US Guidelines
(Fiore 2008) endorse a dose-response relationship for total amount
of contact time (up to 300 minutes) and number of sessions, as
well as session length. Their meta-analyses suggest clear trends
although there were not necessarily significant differences between
adjacent categories. There were however clear differences between
for example 4 to 30 minutes of contact time (odds ratio (OR)
1.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3) and 91 to 300 minutes (OR 3.2, 95%
CI 2.3 to 4.6) (Fiore 2008 table 6.9) and between two to three
treatment sessions (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7) and over eight
sessions (OR 2.3, 95% CI 2.1 to 3.0) (Fiore 2008 table 6.10). Our
estimates comparing subgroups of trials classified by within trial
differences in intensity show less clear evidence of a dose-response
effect, although they do not exclude there being one.

Implications for practice
Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural
support increase smoking cessation success in a wide range of set-
tings and populations, compared to a minimal intervention or
usual care. This suggests that clinicians should encourage smokers
to use both types of aid. Offering more intensive behavioural sup-
port was not shown to be associated with larger treatment effects;
this may be because intensive interventions are more difficult to
deliver consistently to participants.
Implications for research
It is unlikely that further trials will alter the main findings of this
review, although they may contribute to further understanding
about the effects of treatment in particular settings or in popula-
tions of smokers.

Provider: cessation specialist, telephone based
Interventions
Factorial design; 3 levels of counselling, +/- offer of up to 8 weeks of free nicotine patches.
No face-to-face contact.
1. Control (Brief): 15 min call + referral material + tailored S-H materials. [Mean 1
session, 20 min contact time]
2. Moderate: 40 min call + brief call to encourage use of community services, tailored
S-H materials. [Mean 2.0 sessions, 47 min contact]

 Murray 2013
Methods
Setting: 18 acute medical wards in 1 hospital, UK
Recruitment: Inpatients, unselected for motivation
Participants
493 smokers (within 4 weeks of admission); 40% F, av. age 56, av. cpd not reported
Provider: Specialists (research team)
Interventions
Pharmacotherapy: Dual nicotine replacement therapy was most common (patch, inhala-
tor) but varenicline was also used
1. Usual care: possible advice to quit & cessation support
2.Intervention: brief advice &offerof support. Those accepting supportreceivedtailored
support, pharmacotherapy (usually patch, inhalator or both)
Outcomes
Abstinence: continuous at 6 months
Validation: CO < 10 ppm
Notes
Intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.07, higher than expected. Numbers in
meta-analysis adjusted to 17/91 vs 7/80 to allow for clustering (as described in Cochrane
Handbook 16.3.4/5). Paper reports OR adjusted for clustering and stratification of 1.
53 (0.60 to 3.91) compared to 2.40 (0.94, 6.12) for adjusted data so we also tested
sensitivity of overall results to this study

Low risk
Clinical andresearch staffandpatientswere
aware of group assignment, and Interven-
tion group participants were recruited soon
after admission whilst control group partic-
ipants recruited prior to discharge. How-
ever ’Although the study design precluded
blinding, ward staff were unaware of the
exact details of the study, and patients
were specifically not informed of the com-
ponents of the intervention being tested.
Consent ... was only sought for the fol-
low-up measures, for which the procedure
was identical for both groups. It is therefore
unlikely that knowledge of missing out on
treatment influenced the results gained in
the study,’ so judged low risk

Ockene 1991
Methods
Setting: US primary care residency programme (physicians in training)
Recruitment: unselected patients in 5 primary care clinics
Participants
1286 smoking patients not selected for motivation to quit
Providers: 196 primary care physicians in training
Interventions
1. Advice only
2. Patient-centred counselling, written materials, asked to schedule follow-up visit, fol-
low-up letter (not used in this review)
3. Patient-centred counselling and offer of prescription for nicotine gum
(Each group was further randomised to minimal (no calls) or intensive follow-up by tele-
phone (3 calls over 6m) from a health educator (HE) but no main effects or interactions
were noted and no results were presented at 12 months so this factor is not analysed
here)
Outcomes
Sustained abstinence at 12m (reported in Ockene 1994) (6 & 12m). PP also reported
Validation: none
Notes
Adjusted rates used in analysis. All physicians received training in minimal vs intensive
interventions and delivered them according to random allocation of patient. 12m PP
abstinence showed no effect of intervention.
69% of group 3 accepted prescription and received at least 1 box of gum.
Also contributes to Cochrane reviews of physician advice and NRT

Outcomes
Abstinence at 12m (sustained for 3m)
Validation: saliva cotinine ≤ 0.057 µmol/L, or saliva thiocyanate ≤ µ1724 mol/L if the
patient was still using nicotine gum
Notes
Intervention patients more motivated to quit, so adjusted mean cessation rates used. For
meta-analysis we estimated number of quitters without a correction for clustering within
practices; the number of clusters was large, cluster size small (average 28 patients/cluster)
and cessation rates did not vary significantly among practices within treatment groups.
Less than 65% of intervention used any gum, 27% used only a few pieces

A second planned objective of the review was to evaluate the effect of increasing behavioural support for people using pharmacotherapy.
This is now addressed in a companion review (Stead 2015).
The categories used for some subgroup analyses were altered: we distinguished between no person-to-person contact and between one
and three sessions rather than using the US Guideline categories of zero to one and two to three, and collapsed one to three minutes
and 4 to 30 minutes for contact time. We added categories of peer group counsellor and lay counsellor to provider type, and we added
a category of studies that did not explicitly select for motivation but where study procedures or participant characteristics suggested
that participants were typically motivated to quit.
We did not use a brief/moderate/intensive subgroup analysis because it did not help discriminate between studies.
