IMPORTANCE Treating surgical complications presents a major challenge for hospitals striving
to deliver high-quality care while reducing costs. Costs associated with rescuing patients from
perioperative complications are poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate differences across hospitals in the costs of care for patients surviving
perioperative complications after major inpatient surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using claims data from the
Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files. We compared payments for patients who died
vs patients who survived after perioperative complications occurred. Hospitals were
stratified using average payments for patients who survived following complications, and
payment components were analyzed across hospitals. Administrative claims database of
surgical patients was analyzed at hospitals treating Medicare patients nationwide. This study
included Medicare patients aged 65 to 100 years who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm
repair (n = 69 207), colectomy for cancer (n = 107 647), pulmonary resection (n = 91 758),
and total hip replacement (n = 307 399) between 2009 and 2012. Data analysis took place
between November 2015 and March 2016.
EXPOSURES Clinical outcome of surgery (eg, no complication, complication and death, or
complication and survival) and the individual hospital where a patient received an operation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk-adjusted, price-standardized Medicare payments for
an episode of surgery. Risk-adjusted perioperative outcomes were also assessed.
RESULTS The mean age for Medicare beneficiaries in this study ranged from 74.1 years
(pulmonary resection) to 78.2 years (colectomy). The proportion of male patients ranged
from 37% (total hip replacement) to 77% (abdominal aortic aneurysm repair), and most
patients were white. Among patients who experienced complications, those who were
rescued had higher price-standardized Medicare payments than did those who died for all 4
operations. Assessing variation across hospitals, payments for patients who were rescued at
the highest cost-of-rescue hospitals were 2- to 3-fold higher than at the lowest cost-of-rescue
hospitals for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair ($60 456 vs $23 261; P < .001), colectomy
($56 787 vs $22 853; P < .001), pulmonary resection ($63 117 vs $21 325; P < .001), and total
hip replacement ($41 354 vs $19 028; P < .001). Compared with lowest cost-of-rescue
hospitals, highest cost-of-rescue hospitals had higher risk-adjusted rates of serious
complications with similar rates of failure to rescue and overall 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After 4 selected inpatient operations, substantial variation
was observed across hospitals regarding Medicare episode payments for patients rescued
from perioperative complications. Notably, higher Medicare payments were not associated
with improved clinical performance. These findings highlight the potential for hospitals to
target efficient treatment of perioperative complications in cost-reduction efforts.

S
urgical complications are expensive events for pa-
tients, hospitals, and payers.1,2 Emerging value-based
purchasingpolicies,suchasbundledpaymentsandnon-
payment for readmissions, seek to reward hospitals that de-
liver high-quality care at lower costs. Thus, common targets
for surgical quality improvement initiatives include reducing
hospitals’rates of perioperative complications and death. It is
increasingly recognized that effective treatment of complica-
tions once they have occurred is another important indicator
of hospital quality with inpatient surgery.3 Preventing mor-
tality after patients have experienced a major complication (ie,
preventing failure to rescue) presents a particular challenge for
clinicians who strive to improve quality while delivering cost-
efficient care.
The costs associated with rescuing patients from peri-
operative complications are poorly understood. While sev-
eral studies have demonstrated that surgical complications
dramaticallyincreasetheoverallcostofcare,1,2,4,5toourknowl-
edge, none have explored variation in how efficiently hospi-
tals manage those complications. In the attempt to rescue a
dying patient from a surgical complication, clinicians might
devote more resources (eg, diagnostic studies, therapeutic in-
terventions, and postoperative rehabilitation) toward that pa-
tient’
s care. Alternatively, vulnerable patients who experi-
ence complications may simply die earlier and incur fewer
expenses than those who survive following adverse events. A
morenuancedunderstandingofthecostsofperioperativecom-
plications would help hospitals and policy makers better gauge
cost efficiency with surgery to more appropriately incentiv-
ize high-quality, low-cost surgical care.
To better understand the relationship between peri-
operative complications and health care costs, we analyzed
Medicare claims data for patients who underwent abdominal
aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, colectomy for cancer, pulmo-
nary resection, and total hip replacement. We examined costs
from the payer perspective, with Medicare expenditures rep-
resentingsocietalcostsofhealthcare.First,wecomparedMedi-
care episode payments across 3 groups of patients: those with-
out complications, those with complications who died, and
those with complications who were rescued. Then, we evalu-
ated between-hospital variation in Medicare payments for pa-
tients who were rescued from complications. Finally, we as-
sessed the relationship between the “cost of rescue” and other
clinical outcomes at these hospitals.
Methods
Data Sources and Study Population
Using procedure codes from the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, we identified
all Medicare patients aged 65 years to 100 years who under-
went any of 4 operations between 2009 and 2012: AAA re-
pair, colectomy, pulmonary resection, or total hip replace-
ment(eAppendix1inthe Supplement).Theseprocedureswere
selected because they are common, high-risk operations that
have varying rates of perioperative adverse events and re-
quire management with different sets of clinical resources. To
enhance the homogeneity of the individual cohorts, patients
who underwent AAA repair were excluded if diagnostic or pro-
cedure codes indicated rupture of the aneurysm,6-8 and only
patients who underwent colectomy for a diagnosis of cancer
were included. For similar reasons, patients who underwent
total hip replacement were excluded if diagnostic codes indi-
cated primary or secondary malignancy or hip fracture.2
Claims data were analyzed from the Medicare Provider
AnalysisandReviewfiles,whichcontainhospitaldischargeab-
stracts for all fee-for-service acute care hospitalizations of US
Medicare beneficiaries. Patients were eligible for payment
analysis if they were enrolled in Medicare Part A and B (fee-
for-service) plans and had no payments from a health main-
tenance organization for 1 month prior to and 6 months after
the index operation.9 This ensured that payments for a pa-
tient’
s episode of surgical care were captured entirely by Medi-
care. Hospitals were excluded if they had no record of pa-
tients who survived a postoperative complication, which
excluded 1% to 5% of patients eligible for payment analysis.
Information about hospital characteristics was obtained from
Medicare cost reports and the American Hospital Association
Annual Survey Database. This study was approved by the in-
stitutional review board of the University of Michigan and
judged to be exempt from human participant review owing to
the retrospective nature of the study and negligible risk to pa-
tient.
Risk Adjustment
In all models evaluating Medicare payments and periopera-
tiveoutcomes,covariatesincludedage,sex,race/ethnicity,and
29 Elixhauser comorbid diseases.10,11 Additional covariates
were procedure year, admission priority, preoperative length
of stay, and surgical approach (eg, endovascular vs open AAA
repair, laparoscopic vs open colectomy, and video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery vs open pulmonary resection).
Medicare Payments
Actual Medicare payments, not submitted hospital charges,
were assessed for each patient. Consistent with prior litera-
ture, patient discharge records were linked to other Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services files containing claims for ser-
vices relevant to the index operation, including the carrier (ie,
physician),outpatient,andhomehealthfiles.2,9Paymentswere
Key Points
Question How do Medicare payments vary across hospitals for
patients rescued from perioperative complications?
Findings In this cohort study, Medicare payments for patients
who were rescued at the highest cost-of-rescue hospitals were
2- to 3-fold higher than at the lowest cost-of-rescue hospitals for
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair ($60 456 vs $23 261),
colectomy ($56 787 vs $22 853), pulmonary resection ($63 117 vs
$21 325), and total hip replacement ($41 354 vs $19 028).
Meaning These findings highlight the potential for hospitals to
target efficient treatment of perioperative complications in
cost-reduction efforts.

determined for all service types from the date of hospital
admission for the index operation to 30 days from the hos-
pital discharge date (ie, episode payments), consistent with
the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission practices.2,9
As specified elsewhere, total episode payments were orga-
nized into individual types of services: index hospitaliza-
tion, readmissions, physician services, and postacute care
services.2,9
For each patient, total Medicare payments were assessed
using risk-adjusted and price-standardized payments. Risk ad-
justment accounted for patient-specific factors as described
earlier.PricestandardizationexcludedthesubsidiesthatMedi-
care provides to hospitals for indirect medical education and
disproportionate share costs and were calculated using meth-
ods previously established to account for regional variation in
Medicare payments.9,12 After risk-adjusting for patient char-
acteristics, these price-standardized payments can be inter-
preted as a meaningful measure of relative resource usage
(ie, cost efficiency) across hospitals because they account for
intended differences in Medicare spending. In this study, the
primary outcome was the average price-standardized epi-
sode payment for patients who survived following periopera-
tive complications.
Perioperative Outcomes
Perioperative outcomes were assessed using Medicare claims
data. Perioperative complications were identified using Inter-
nationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModi-
fication codes from the index hospitalization (eAppendix 2 in
theSupplement).2,13,14Thesecodeshavebeenvalidatedinprior
studies of surgical outcomes.15,16 Eight major perioperative
complications were identified for this study: pulmonary fail-
ure, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, deep venous throm-
bosis/pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, postopera-
tive hemorrhage, surgical site infection, and gastrointestinal
bleeding. Serious complications were defined by a coded com-
plication and an extended length of stay (>75th percentile for
each operation).8,17 Failure to rescue was defined as death in
a patient who had at least 1 complication.13,14 Mortality within
30 days of the index operation was ascertained from the Medi-
care denominator file.
Statistical Analysis
The average total Medicare payment for an episode of surgi-
cal care was determined at the patient level for each cat-
egory of clinical outcome: no complication, complication
and death, or complication and survival. After price stan-
dardization, total payments were risk-adjusted using linear
regression with log link owing to the right-skewed distribu-
tion of actual payments. All analyses accounted for cluster-
ing of patients within hospitals by calculating robust stan-
dard errors.
Differences in episode payments between patients who
died following complications and patients who survived fol-
lowing complications were compared using 1-way analysis of
variance with the Bonferroni multiple-comparison test. To as-
sess variation in the cost of rescuing patients from periopera-
tive complications, hospitals were ranked and grouped into
quintiles based on their average payment for patients who sur-
vived an adverse event.
Risk-adjustedperioperativeoutcomesweremodeledusing
multiple logistic regression. C statistics ranged from 0.70 (fail-
ure to rescue) to 0.88 (serious complications), indicating mod-
erate to strong predictive power for individual models. Odds
ratios were converted to relative risks to facilitate clinical
interpretation,18 and 95% confidence intervals were calcu-
lated using robust variance estimates.
Hypotheses were tested using a 2-sided approach with
α = .05. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA, ver-
sion 11.2 (StataCorp).
Results
Patient and Hospital Characteristics
Patient demographics and comorbidities varied across the 4
selected procedures as did perioperative outcomes (Table 1).
Overall, rates of adverse perioperative events were lowest for
total hip replacement and highest for colectomy. Mean rates
of overall complications ranged from 4.9% for total hip re-
placement to 25.1% for colectomy. Average rates of failure to
rescue (ie, mortality among patients who had a complication)
ranged from 3.4% for total hip replacement to 17.7% for col-
ectomyand18.0%forpulmonaryresection.Inaconsistentpat-
tern,averageratesofoverall30-daymortalityrangedfrom0.3%
for total hip replacement to 6.2% for colectomy.
Hospital factors also differed depending on the operation
(Table 1). Hospital procedure volume in Medicare patients was
highest for total hip replacement, while volumes were lowest
for AAA repair and pulmonary resection. Most hospitals were
nonprofit and reported as nonteaching hospitals.
Medicare Payments for Patients with Complications
As expected, mean Medicare episode payments were higher
for patients with perioperative complications than for pa-
tients without complications (Figure 1). Furthermore, among
patients who experienced complications, those who sur-
vived had higher price-standardized Medicare payments than
did those who died ($37 746.57 vs $36 793.16 for AAA repair
[P = .42], $36 619.33 vs $31 949.96 for colectomy [P < .001],
$38 093.10 vs $34 030.70 for pulmonary resection [P < .001],
and $28 278.32 vs $26 801.74 for total hip replacement
[P = .003]). For all 4 operations, the index hospitalization
accounted for a greater proportion of total Medicare pay-
ments among patients who died following a complication
than among those who survived. Among patients who sur-
vived their complications, readmissions and postacute care
services largely contributed to the higher total episode pay-
ments (Figure 1).
Next, we focused specifically on patients who were res-
cued from perioperative complications. After ranking hospi-
tals on their average Medicare payments for patients who were
rescued, impressive variation in episode payments was
observedacrosshospitalquintilesforall4operations(Figure2).
Payments for patients who were rescued at highest cost-
of-rescue hospitals were 2- to 3-fold higher than at lowest

Relationship Between Outcomes and Payments
for Patients Rescued From Complications
In addition to having higher Medicare payments for patients
rescued from complications, these highest cost-of-rescue hos-
pitals also had higher risk-adjusted rates of overall and seri-
ous complications compared with the lowest cost-of-rescue
hospitals (Table 3). Risk-adjusted rates of serious complica-
tions were higher at the highest cost-of-rescue hospitals than
at the lowest cost-of-rescue hospitals for AAA repair (relative
risk [RR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.21-1.33), colectomy (RR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.36-1.45),lungresection(RR,1.26;95%CI,1.20-1.32),andtotal
hip replacement (RR, 1.27, 95% CI, 1.16-1.37).
Similarly, highest cost-of-rescue hospitals performed no
better and in some cases worse than lowest cost-of-rescue hos-
pitals when assessing failure to rescue and overall 30-day mor-
tality (Table 3). Rates of failure to rescue were similar at the
highest and lowest cost-of-rescue hospitals for AAA repair, col-
ectomy, pulmonary resection, and total hip replacement. Fur-
thermore, rates of overall 30-day mortality were significantly
worse at the highest cost-of-rescue hospitals for AAA repair
and colectomy. Trends in surgical outcomes are displayed
across all hospital quintiles of cost-of-rescue payments in the
eTable in the Supplement.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the costs associated with res-
cuing patients from perioperative complications after 4
common, resource-intensive operations at hospitals nation-
wide. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that price-
standardized Medicare payments were higher for patients
who survived their complications than for those who died,
largely owing to payments for readmissions and postacute
care services. However, we observed striking hospital-level
variation in Medicare spending for rescuing these patients.
Mean Medicare payments for patients who were rescued
varied as much as 3-fold between the highest and lowest
cost-of-rescue hospitals. Furthermore, highest cost-
of-rescue hospitals had higher risk-adjusted rates of overall
and serious complications. These highest cost-of-rescue
hospitals also failed to demonstrate better rates of failure to
rescue and 30-day mortality.
It is well documented that perioperative complications are
associatedwithincreasedcostsofsurgicalcare.1,2,5Despitethis

relationship between complications and costs, perioperative
mortality has not been linked with higher surgical costs.2 This
discrepancy may be explained by the possibility that patients
who die following perioperative complications incur fewer
coststhanthosewhoexperienceaprolongedrecoveryandsur-
vive their complications. Another feasible explanation is that
certain hospitals may rescue their patients from complica-
tions more efficiently than other hospitals. Our study sought
toevaluatethesevariablesourcesofhealthcarespending.First,
we provide empirical evidence that among patients who
experience surgical complications, those who die actually
have lower Medicare payments than do those who are res-
cued. Next, importantly, our data reveal significant varia-
tion in the cost of rescuing patients from perioperative com-
plications across hospitals. Going beyond existing evidence
that poor surgical quality leads to higher costs,2,5 our results
suggest that inefficient treatment of perioperative compli-
cations once they occur contributes substantially to higher
health care spending. Our finding that the lowest cost-
of-rescue hospitals have 3-fold lower Medicare payments
without sacrificing clinical quality highlights a potential tar-
get for surgical cost reduction.
Numerous studies have argued that reducing the overall
occurrence of adverse events can lead to significant financial
savings.2,4,19,20 While this argument certainly has face valid-
ity, even the best hospitals and surgeons will continue to have
complications at some rate.3 Efficient treatment of complica-
tions that do occur may be an important approach that, to our
knowledge, has not yet been explored for containing health
care costs. Comparing cost-efficiency across hospitals can be
challenging owing to variable payment patterns at each insti-
tution. For example, certain hospitals are inherently more ex-
pensive because they treat many low-income patients with-
out insurance or they carry out educational missions by
teachingresidentsandstudents.Byspecificallystudyingprice-
standardized Medicare payments (which accounted for in-
tended differences in Medicare spending), this analysis en-
abled a meaningful comparison of resource use for surgery
across hospitals.
Although it is known that Medicare expenditures in gen-
eral vary across hospitals for episodes of surgery,9,21,22 to our
knowledge, cost-efficiency in treating patients with compli-
cationshasnotbeenstudied.Thesefindingsindicatethatvaria-
tion in Medicare payments for rescuing patients from compli-
cations is as pronounced as, if not more than, that observed
for all surgical patients. Furthermore, this study provides a de-
tailed appreciation of the mechanisms underlying the varia-
tioninepisodepaymentstohospitalsforpatientsrescuedfrom
adverse events. While the index hospitalization is known to
be a major source of variation in Medicare payments,2 we ob-
served that readmissions and postacute care also contrib-
uted substantially to variation in cost-efficiency for patients
with perioperative complications.
Whetherhigherspendingisrequiredtoachievebetterclini-
cal quality is the fundamental question for policy makers in
the value-based purchasing era.23-25 Similar to the relation-
ship between episode payments and surgical outcomes dem-
onstrated previously for all patients together,2 higher pay-
ments for rescuing patients with complications were not
associated with better outcomes in this study. Here, hospitals
receiving the largest payments for rescued patients had higher
rates of complications, but were no more effective and in some
cases worse than other hospitals at preventing mortality. From
another perspective, lowest cost-of-rescue hospitals achieved
equivalent or superior surgical quality with remarkably lower
Medicare spending.

This study has several limitations. First, the use of Medi-
carepaymentsmaybeconsideredaproxyforthetruecoststhat
institutionsincurforprovidingcare(ie,costsforindividualtests
and studies ordered). However, episode payments represent
costs to Medicare, which offers a federally funded perspective
of health care use and a key area where national payment re-
form is being piloted via value-based purchasing initiatives.
Next, studying Medicare claims limits the generalizability of
these findings to younger patients with private insurance. Nev-
ertheless, the 4 operations we studied are commonly per-
formed for elderly patients, and private insurers tend to base
decisions on results demonstrated in the Medicare popula-
tion.Additionally,arecognizeddrawbackofadministrativedata
analysis is residual confounding from lack of clinically granu-
lar data. To evaluate this limitation, we performed several
sensitivity analyses to enhance the homogeneity of the study
cohort, with similar findings to the results presented here. Fur-
thermore, studying Medicare patients uniquely enabled us to
fully capture all payments associated with an episode of surgi-
cal care. Finally, this study could not answer with certainty the
question of why the highest cost-of-rescue hospitals were less
efficient with Medicare dollars. What we can learn from these
data is that patients at high cost-of-rescue hospitals tended to
experiencecomplicationsmorefrequently.Importantly,thiswas
associatedwithrelativelyhigherMedicarepaymentsfornotonly
the index hospitalization but also for readmissions and post-
acute care services. Future studies using quality collabora-
tives could more thoroughly understand differences in clinical
care processes for surgical care between highest and lowest
cost-of-rescue hospitals.
This study presents important considerations for emerg-
ing policy initiatives. While innovative reimbursement strat-
egies,suchasaccountablecareorganizationsandbundledpay-
ments,aimtorewardcost-efficienthospitalsthatprovidehigh-
quality care, a concern is that surgical quality at expensive
hospitals might decrease further if their reimbursements are
reduced. However, this analysis suggests that steering pa-
tientsawayfromthesehospitalshasthepotentialtobothlower
Medicare spending and improve the safety of surgical care for
patients.Inthisstudy,thelowestcost-of-rescuehospitalsdem-
onstrated lower rates of perioperative complications in gen-
eral. Furthermore, these lower-cost hospitals did not sacri-
fice clinical quality when treating patients who did incur
adverse events (ie, their rates of failure to rescue were equiva-
lent to rates at higher-cost hospitals). This study provides evi-
denceforcost-efficiencywhileeffectivelytreatingpatientswith
perioperative complications. Emerging payment policies that
incentivize high-quality care at lower costs may lead to pre-
viously unforeseen benefits even when applied to surgical
patients who experience costly complications.
Conclusions
Using price-standardized Medicare payments to evaluate cost-
efficiency with 4 inpatient operations, wide variation was ob-
served across hospitals regarding episode payments for pa-
tients rescued from perioperative complications. Compared
with lower cost-of-rescue hospitals, the highest cost-of-
rescue hospitals had higher risk-adjusted complication rates
with similar rates of failure to rescue and 30-day mortality.
These results highlight the potential for hospitals to examine
strategies for managing perioperative complications to iden-
tify opportunities for improved cost efficiency with surgery.
