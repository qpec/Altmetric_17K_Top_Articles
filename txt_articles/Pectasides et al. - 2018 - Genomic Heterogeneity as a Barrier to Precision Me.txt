ABSTRACT 
 
Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is a lethal disease where targeted therapies, 
even when guided by genomic biomarkers, have had limited effi
 cacy. A potential rea-
son for the failure of such therapies is that genomic profi
 ling results could commonly differ between the 
primary and metastatic tumors. To evaluate genomic heterogeneity, we sequenced paired primary GEA and 
synchronous metastatic lesions across multiple cohorts, fi
 nding extensive differences in genomic altera-
tions, including discrepancies in potentially clinically relevant alterations. Multiregion sequencing showed 
signifi
 cant discrepancy within the primary tumor (PT) and between the PT and disseminated disease, with 
oncogene amplifi
 cation profi
 les commonly discordant. In addition, a pilot analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
sequencing demonstrated the feasibility of detecting genomic amplifi
 cations not detected in PT sampling. 
Lastly, we profi
 led paired primary tumors, metastatic tumors, and cfDNA from patients enrolled in the 
personalized antibodies for GEA (PANGEA) trial of targeted therapies in GEA and found that genomic 
biomarkers were recurrently discrepant between the PT and untreated metastases. Divergent primary and 
metastatic tissue profi
 ling led to treatment reassignment in 32% (9/28) of patients. In discordant primary 
and metastatic lesions, we found 87.5% concordance for targetable alterations in metastatic tissue and 
cfDNA, suggesting the potential for cfDNA profi
 ling to enhance selection of therapy. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
 We demonstrate frequent baseline heterogeneity in targetable genomic alterations in 
GEA, indicating that current tissue sampling practices for biomarker testing do not effectively guide 
precision medicine in this disease and that routine profi
 ling of metastatic lesions and/or cfDNA should 
be systematically evaluated.

RESEARCH BRIEF

INTRODUCTION
Gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas (GEA) are lethal 
malignancies, responsible for over 700,000 deaths annually (1). 
Current systemic treatments largely rely on modestly effective 
chemotherapy (2). Increasingly, genomic profiling is being 
performed on cancer samples in order to identify pathogenic 
somatic DNA alterations, with these genomic biomarkers then 
used to guide selection of targeted therapies toward specific 
activated oncogenes (3, 4). In GEA, with the exception of tras-
tuzumab in ERBB2-amplified (HER2+, herein ERBB2+) tumors 
(5), clinical testing of targeted therapies guided by molecular 
testing and directed against targets such as MET, FGFR2, and 
ERBB2-directed receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors has 
been disappointing (6–9). In addition, EGFR-directed therapy 
failed testing in unselected patient populations with meta-
static GEA (10, 11). There are several reasons this strategy of 
selecting targeted therapies based upon molecular biomarkers 
may be frequently ineffective in GEAs. Here, we focus on one 
potential etiology: baseline tumor heterogeneity in genomic 
alterations between different sites of a patient’s cancer.
Biomarker profiling is routinely performed on a single site 
of GEA, typically endoscopic biopsies of the primary tumor 
(PT). This approach assumes that critical genomic altera-
tions are present homogeneously and that the profile of a PT 
sample matches all other sites of disease, including metastatic 
sites. In malignancies where targeted therapies have been 
more successful, including lung cancer and melanoma, analy-
sis of paired primary and metastatic biopsies revealed 90% 
to 100% concordance of EGFR or BRAF mutations (12–14). 
Comparative analyses of matched primary/metastatic colo-
rectal tumors revealed >90% concordance of KRAS, BRAF, and 
PIK3CA mutations (15–17). In breast cancer, ERBB2 testing 
has been shown to be concordant between primary tumors 
and metastases in >90% of cases (18–20).
Genomic studies of GEA, consisting of analyses of PT, 
revealed substantial chromosomal instability, with tumors 
often possessing multiple activated oncogenes (21–23). The 
presence of this instability and multiple co-occurring onco-
genes raises questions regarding the heterogeneity within 
these tumors and between distinct tumor foci. Existing studies 
evaluating heterogeneity of candidate therapeutic biomarkers 
in GEA have shown mixed results. Studies using FISH, IHC, 
or multiplex PCR to query amplification of specific oncogenes 
identified discrepant profiles of targets, including ERBB2 
within the PT or between the PT and lymph node (LN) metas-
tases in approximately 30% to 50% of cases (24–26). In con-
trast, other studies that queried discordance of ERBB2 within 
distinct regions of the PT found discrepancies in only 12% of 
cases (27, 28), or that patients with metastatic GEA with nega-
tive ERBB2 testing from a biopsy of the PT showed ERBB2 
positivity in the metastatic disease in only 5.7% of cases (29). 
In addition, other studies have shown 87.5% to 98.5% concord-
ance of ERBB2 between PT and paired metastatic sites (30, 
31). Based upon these existing data, new 2016 guidelines for 
assessment of ERBB2 status in GEA recommend that testing 
be performed on a single site, either the PT or metastases, stat-
ing that the totality of literature does not suggest common 
heterogeneity of ERBB2 between sites (32).
In this study, we sought to comprehensively evaluate 
genomic heterogeneity as a potential barrier to precision medi-
cine by evaluating the extent of genomic heterogeneity in 
patients with newly diagnosed metastatic GEA, prior to receipt 
of systemic therapy. Using next-generation sequencing across 
multiple sample cohorts, we compared the current practice 
of performing genomic profiling upon a single PT focus to 
results from broader profiling, including testing of both mul-
tiple regions of the PT, biopsies of metastatic sites, and evalu-
ation of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from peripheral 
blood samples. Together, these data demonstrate that targeta-
ble genomic alterations within GEAs, especially copy-number 
amplifications, are commonly heterogeneously present across 
a patient’s cancer, with consequent significant implications 
for targeted treatment selection. These results suggest that 
the common and accepted practices of performing biomarker 
profiling using only a single focus of PT GEA may frequently 
lead to suboptimal therapy selection and that new biomarker 
profiling strategies are needed to advance targeted therapeutics 
in this disease.
RESULTS
Cohort 1: Whole-Exome Sequencing of  
Paired, Synchronous Primary, and Metastatic 
Gastric Adenocarcinoma Identifies Baseline 
Genomic Heterogeneity
We compared the results of whole-exome sequencing of 
gastric adenocarcinoma PTs and synchronous metastases 
(Fig. 1A), including (i) single biopsies each of PT and paired 
metastasis from 10 patients, and (ii) one patient with two sep-
arate biopsies from the primary and metastatic tumors (Sup-
plementary Table S1). We observed no consistent trend in 
total numbers of mutations between paired primary/metas-
tasis but found three patients (C1-1, C1-2, C1-8) where there 
was substantial increase in chromosomal alterations in the

metastasis compared with the primary (Supplementary Fig. 
S1A and B; Supplementary Table S1). As somatic mutations 
and amplifications are commonly evaluated as therapeutic 
biomarkers, we next quantified concordance of these altera-
tions between paired PT and metastatic lesions (Fig. 1B). 
Among all single-nucleotide and insertion/deletion muta-
tions, an average of 42% of events was discordant between the 
PT/metastasis. Discordance was higher, 63%, for amplified 
genes. All paired samples shared some alterations, confirm-
ing that they originated from the same tumor. To confirm 
that the discrepant mutations were actually absent in the 
paired sample, samples with discrepant mutations by whole-
exome sequencing in genes present in an established targeted 
243-gene panel (Supplementary Table S2) were resequenced 
using the targeted panel to a mean target coverage of 242.6×. 
All 22 discrepant mutations by whole-exome sequencing 
were validated to be present in one sample and absent in the 
paired sample on the repeat targeted panel sequencing (Sup-
plementary Table S3). Except for one mutant read (1/108) 
for gene FAT3 in the metastatic sample C1-6, there were zero 
reads identified to suggest a mutation in any of the samples 
originally called negative for the mutation.
As these analyses demonstrated extensive heterogeneity 
between paired synchronous PT/metastatic samples, we next 
focused upon concordance of potentially clinically relevant 
alterations. Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor and 
amplifications of oncogene CCNE1 were generally shared 
between PT/metastasis (Fig. 1C and D). However, amplifi-
cations at other oncogenic loci were frequently discrepant 
between PT/metastasis. For example, 3 of 11 patients’ meta-
static sites possessed KRAS amplification not detected in the 
matched PT. Clinically relevant discrepancies were not lim-
ited to amplifications. In patient C1-1, a subclonal PIK3CA 
hotspot mutation in the PT was absent in the metastasis 
(Fig. 1C). Other patients’ tumors possessed combinations of 
shared/private amplifications. Patient C1-2’s PT and metasta-
sis shared a MET amplification, but only the metastasis had 
KRAS and CDK6 amplifications (Fig. 1C). Thus, discrepant 
pathogenic alterations between the PT and paired metastatic 
lesions occurred in 5/11 (45%) of patients.
Cohort 2: Multiregion Targeted Sequencing of 
Matched Primary GEA Tumors, Lymph Node 
and Distant Metastases Revealed Significant 
Heterogeneity of Genomic Alterations
A limitation of studies in cohort 1 was that the extent of 
heterogeneity could not be determined because only a single 
focus of PT and a single metastatic biopsy were profiled. We 
therefore evaluated a second cohort of 26 samples (cohort 2) 
in which the use of surgical resection samples allowed us to 
isolate DNA from multiple regions of the PT and multiple 
LNs with metastatic cancer compared with a matched germ-
line sample from each patient. We also obtained biopsies 
of metachronous distant metastases from patients whose 
tumors recurred following surgery, but in whom no systemic 
treatment was started prior to biopsy (Fig. 2A; Supplementary 
Table S4). Through multiregion sequencing, we found strik-
ing heterogeneity within the PT and between the paired PT/
metastases. TP53 mutations and CCNE1 amplification were 
again more homogeneous, suggesting these are early events 
in tumor development that are retained. In contrast, genomic 
alterations such as multicopy amplifications of EGFR, ERBB2, 
CDK4/6, and MET and canonical “hotspot” PIK3CA muta-
tions were frequently discordant both within the PT and 
between PT/metastases (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S5). 
Specifically, among alterations in RTKs, 9 of 12 cases (75%) 
were discordant across all matched samples [including 3 of 5 
(60%) ERBB2-amplified cases; Fig. 2C, top].
In several cases, we validated these discrepant test results. 
In patient C2-20, all PT and metastatic samples harbored the 
same TP53 mutation, and EGFR amplification was present 
in two of three PT foci and both LN metastases, yet absent 
in the distant metachronous metastasis. Another region of 
the PT harbored KRAS amplification. The metachronous 
distant metastasis collected from a recurrence harbored a 
MET amplification not detected in any other sample. These 
amplifications were validated using FISH (Fig. 2B). Simi-
larly, in patient C2-5, a TP53 mutation was shared among 
seven foci, but an ERBB2 amplification detected in all three 
PT foci was not detected in any of four nodal metastases, as 
validated by IHC (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2). These data 
demonstrate heterogeneity both within the PT and across dis-
seminated disease in both clinically relevant and potentially 
relevant genomic alterations.
Cohort 3: Correlation of Genomic Alterations 
between GEA Tumors and cfDNA
Based upon the heterogeneity we observed in cohorts 1 and 
2, we next evaluated cfDNA, which is obtained from peripheral 
blood plasma, as an alternative means for genomic profil-
ing. cfDNA, shed by multiple disease foci and cleared from 
circulation in under two hours, may assess systemic disease 
without the need for invasive sampling. We performed a pilot 
comparison to test how genomic amplification assessment 
in cfDNA compares with tumor profiling using DNA from 
clinical material. We collected plasma from 11 patients with 
metastatic GEA whose tumors were subjected to Clinical Labo-
ratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified profiling 
of tumor DNA (Supplementary Table S6) and performed 
whole-genome sequencing on cfDNA (Fig. 3A). We noted both 
concordance and discordance in potentially actionable onco-
gene amplifications (Fig. 3B). Although patient C3-10’s PT and 
cfDNA shared KRAS amplifications (Fig. 3C), other patients’ 
tumors were discordant and harbored ERBB2 (C3-7) or FGFR2 
amplifications (C3-8) detected in the PT but not in matched 
cfDNA (Fig. 3B and D). In patient C3-6, a CDK6 amplification 
detected in cfDNA was absent from the PT, suggesting that 
areas of the cancer that were not biopsied, including distant 
metastases, harbored this genomic alteration. Thereby, we have 
shown that cfDNA testing may uncover targetable genomic 
events not detected in PT profiling. However, we also found 
that genomic aberrations detected in a PT biopsy were missing 
from cfDNA, raising the question whether those were present 
in the bulk of the patient’s disease burden.

within a GEA Clinical Trial of Molecularly

We next performed comprehensive testing in the personal-
ized antibodies for GEA (PANGEA) trial cohort to evaluate

 Genomic Heterogeneity in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
RESEARCH BRIEF
 
JANUARY  2018 CANCER DISCOVERY | 43 
coupled genomic profiling of PT and metastatic disease, 
paired with cfDNA sampling. In this trial, patients with 
untreated metastatic GEA are assigned to a combination 
of FOLFOX chemotherapy and distinct targeted therapies, 
including trastuzumab (anti-ERBB2), ABT-806 (anti-EGFR), 
ramucirumab (anti-VEGFR2), or nivolumab (anti–PD-1; Sup-
plementary Fig. S3; Supplementary Table S7). Patients in the 
planned MET and FGFR2 inhibitor arms have, to date, been 
treated with FOLFOX due to lack of targeted drug availabil-
ity. The method of biomarker profiling in this study enabled 
us to ask several questions related to tumor heterogeneity. 
In PANGEA, patients underwent sampling and molecular 
testing of both their PTs and at least one metastatic biopsy 
along with parallel cfDNA testing. When biomarker testing 
was discordant between the PT and metastasis, treatment was 
guided by the metastatic biopsy. To date, 28 enrolled patients 
had biomarker profiling complete (Supplementary Table S8).
Despite the focused number of biomarkers evaluated to 
guide assignment to specific arms of this trial, comparative 
biomarker analysis of matched PT/metastatic and cfDNA 
revealed substantially divergent results. We found signifi-
cant discordance between the PT and metastasis in 10 of 
 
28 patients (36%; Supplementary Fig. S4), leading nine patients 
(32%) to have treatment reassignment based upon differences 
between metastatic and PT profiling (Fig. 4B). In five discord-
ant cases, no actionable genomic alteration was detected in 
the PT, yet the metastasis and cfDNA both revealed action-
able alterations in ERBB2 (2), MET (1), EGFR (1), or FGFR2 (1). 
In two patients, ERBB2 alterations found in the PT were not 
detected in metastatic disease or cfDNA. In the first case, the 
PT, metastasis, and cfDNA all possessed an EGFR amplifica-
tion (patient 3), whereas in the other case, the metastatic biopsy 
and cfDNA harbored an FGFR2 amplification, which was not 
 
detected in the PT (patient 7). These results were validated 
by low throughput assays (Fig. 4C–E). We observed high 
concordance of metastatic and cfDNA profiling with 17 out 
of 20 (85%) targetable gene amplifications (MET, ERBB2, 
FGFR2, EGFR, and KRAS) in the metastasis detected in cfDNA 
 
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S4). In seven of eight cases 
(87.5%) with discrepancy of genomic alterations between the 
PT and metastatic lesion, results were concordant between 
the metastasis and cfDNA. These results demonstrate the 
potential for cfDNA profiling to discriminate between ampli-
fications widely present in the metastatic cancer and those 
that may be present only within the PT.
Additionally, although it is premature to report response 
data from this interim report of the biomarker testing in the 
PANGEA trial, anecdotal experiences from this study dem-
onstrate the potential for “metastatic genomic analysis” to 
enhance targeted therapy efficacy in GEA. Patient 5’s multiple 
PT biopsies were ERBB2−, indicating a patient who would not 
receive trastuzumab in standard practice. However, because 
further testing revealed the metastasis and cfDNA to both 
be ERBB2+, trastuzumab was added per protocol starting in 
cycle 2 of therapy. This patient experienced near-complete 
resolution of his metastatic burden after 4 cycles and con-
tinues on first-line therapy 13 months after diagnosis. By 
contrast, patient 3’s PT harbored both an ERBB2 and EGFR 
amplification, denoting a patient who would routinely receive 
chemotherapy with trastuzumab. The additional profiling 
demonstrated the metastasis and cfDNA to be EGFR ampli-
fied but ERBB2−. Initiating first-line therapy with FOLFOX 
with EGFR inhibitor ABT-806 led to a 69.6% decrease in 
tumor burden, and the patient remains on study 16 months 
from diagnosis. In light of the frequent discrepancies this 
study has revealed between the PT and metastatic lesions, 
these results suggest the potential for biomarker profiling 
of the metastatic disease or cfDNA to more effectively guide 
therapy compared with assigned targeted therapy based on 
the PT profile.
DISCUSSION
New technology is increasingly allowing genomic analysis 
of tumor DNA to become a routine part of cancer care. This 
testing is already being used to guide treatment with an 
increasing number of targeted inhibitors, with the goal of 
using these biomarkers to match the drugs to the aberrantly 
active specific growth-promoting oncogene present in each 
tumor. In diseases where the use of genomic profiling to guide 
selection of targeted therapies has been most successful, such 
as in lung cancer or melanoma, the genomic biomarkers used 
to guide treatment decisions are highly concordant between 
the PT and metastasis. This concordance allows the profiles 
obtained from the more readily available PT to be an accurate 
proxy for the biomarker status of the metastases, typically the 
areas of tumor where systemic therapy is intended to treat. 
Results reported to date strongly suggest that a primary 
reason for failed targeted therapy trials in metastatic GEA is 
the problem of intrapatient tumor heterogeneity. Herein, we 
have detailed the extent of this baseline heterogeneity in both 
Western and Eastern cohorts.
The strategy of genome-guided or precision medicine has 
had disappointing results to date in GEA. Large clinical tri-
als testing therapies in patients positive for biomarkers for 
targets such as ERBB2, MET, EGFR, and FGFR2 all failed to 
improve outcomes (refs. 6–11; 33). When biomarker testing 
was performed in these trials, a positive result in a focus of PT 
was deemed sufficient to guide target selection. The results 
we present here clearly challenge the assumption underlying 
the biomarker testing in these trials that a single focus of PT 
is a reliable measure of the larger disease burden. By compre-
hensively assessing a large number of biomarkers in multiple 
cohorts of patients using next-generation sequencing, we 
demonstrated that in GEA there is extensive baseline discord-
ance in the biomarker profiles of synchronously collected PT 
and both LN and distant metastatic lesions. By evaluating 
only tumors without prior systemic therapy, our results dem-
onstrate that the heterogeneity observed is not attributable 
to acquired resistance or treatment effects. Given the poten-
tial for technical artifacts to artificially inflate the degree of 
heterogeneity, we took several steps to guard against this 
possibility. First, we utilized four separate sample cohorts, 
from different tissue source sites and using distinct genomic 
platforms. Second, sequencing results were either CLIA certi-
fied or were manually reviewed with only samples with suf-
ficient tumor purity for the detection of somatic alterations 
included in our analysis. Third, extensive validation with 
additional sequencing, IHC, and FISH were performed and 
concordant with our computational results. Additionally, we

 Genomic Heterogeneity in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
RESEARCH BRIEF
 
JANUARY  2018 CANCER DISCOVERY | 45 
limited our gene-centric analysis of events of likely patho-
genic relevance, including multicopy amplifications of onco-
genes or mutations that were truncating or known missense 
mutations that are recurrent in human cancer.
These results help resolve uncertainty over the nature and 
degree of genomic heterogeneity within GEA. Prior reports 
using FISH and IHC to assess select targets across different 
samples have yielded discrepant results (24, 25, 27–29). But 
some recent reports are consistent with our data. Stahl and 
colleagues used FISH to examine amplification of a set of 
genes, including ERBB2 and EGFR, in multiple sites of the PT 
and paired synchronous LN metastases, and found signifi-
cant differences both within the PT and between the PT and 
metastatic disease in almost half the cases (24). Another pub-
lished study performed multiregion whole-exome sequenc-
ing in eight surgically resected esophageal adenocarcinomas, 
finding substantial heterogeneity in somatic mutations but 
not key pathogenic amplifications (34). Differences between 
our results and this report by Murugaesu and colleagues 
include the larger sample numbers in our study and our use 
of samples with regional and/or distant metastases at diagno-
sis and thus potentially more aggressive biology.
The heterogeneity we have documented is a clear challenge 
to current biomarker profiling procedures in GEA. Recently 
released GEA ERBB2 (HER2) testing guidelines recommend 
that testing be performed on any site, either the PT or 
metastatic biopsy, and discounted potential discordance of 
ERBB2 copy-number alterations between disease sites (32). 
However, our data show that performing biomarker profil-
ing for ERBB2 or other targets by sampling only a small PT 
focus, the most available and typical site tested, often misrep-
resents the aggregate disease burden and therefore may not 
optimally guide targeted therapy. Emerging clinical reports 
are consistent with our hypothesis that targeted therapies 
may fail in patients with GEA because the biomarker being 
tested to guide therapy is heterogeneously present within the 
patients’ cancer. For instance, discordance in amplification 
of MET and other RTKs between the PT and metastatic sites 
has been shown to lead to failure of MET inhibition (35). 
In a recent FGFR inhibitor trial that was guided by FGFR2 
amplification testing of the PT, many patients with FGFR2+ 
PTs failed to respond. However, those patients who did 
respond to therapy had both homogenous FGFR2 testing in 
the PT and FGFR2 amplifications detectable in cfDNA (36). 
These accumulating data indicate that biomarker profiling 
that includes assessment of the metastatic tumor, either by 
direct biopsy or cfDNA measurement, may allow more effec-
tive targeted therapy selection. These results suggest that one 
factor contributing to the failure of recent GEA clinical trials 
of targeted agents may have been that many patients lacked 
the treatment target in a majority of their metastatic disease 
despite a positive result from a PT biopsy.
Current practice relying upon a single PT biopsy, and even 
multiple PT biopsies, for genomic profiling cannot discrimi-
nate between alterations that are present only in the sampled 
region of the PT and those present throughout the patient’s 
disease. One concerning implication is that many patients 
with disseminated ERBB2+ GEA are not receiving trastu-
zumab because the sampled PT is negative (e.g., PANGEA 
patients 2 and 5). Breast cancer guidelines already call for 
repeat biopsy to capture discordant findings when patients 
develop new metastasis, with treatment based on the metas-
tasis when discordant with the primary (37). In a disease such 
as GEA with marked genomic heterogeneity, paired genomic 
profiling of PT and disseminated disease may enable better 
selection of targeted therapies. Optimal therapeutic targets 
are most likely those that are present throughout the cancer 
and identifiable on both PT and cfDNA/metastatic profiling. 
Targets detected in metastatic foci but absent in the PT may 
be efficacious, but responses may be more transient because 
of documented presence of cancer cells lacking the target and 
therefore possessing an intrinsic resistance mechanism to the 
targeted therapy. In contrast, targets detected in the PT but 
absent in metastases would be predicted to be less likely to 
provide significant palliative or survival benefit.
Although these provocative results challenge current 
guidelines and practice, many questions emerge regarding 
optimal biomarker profiling in GEA. To our knowledge, our 
study is the first to explore cfDNA as a means to identify 
therapeutic targets not detectable from standard tissue-based 
testing in untreated metastatic disease. It is encouraging 
that cfDNA sequencing could detect genomic alterations 
present in metastases but not in the PT. cfDNA profiling 
may ultimately provide a more accurate representation of 
disseminated disease in GEA (38–42), potentially reducing 
the need for costly and invasive metastatic biopsies. Future 
GEA studies should more rigorously determine the sensitivity 
and specificity of cfDNA profiling compared with metastatic 
biopsies, and the extent of heterogeneity of key genomic 
biomarkers between distant metastatic sites. Additional pro-
spective targeted-therapy trials, such as PANGEA, remain 
necessary to define the impact of baseline heterogeneity on 
GEA treatment strategies and upon the optimal use of meta-
static and cfDNA profiling to guide therapy.
METHODS
Cohort 1: Whole-Exome Sequencing of Synchronous 
Primary Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Metastases
We performed whole-exome sequencing on 11 sets of fresh-frozen 
PTs, synchronous metastatic biopsies, and non-neoplastic tissue 
from patients with untreated gastric adenocarcinoma at Samsung 
Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) after institutional review board 
(IRB) approval. Exome sequencing, data processing, and mutation 
and somatic copy-number aberration analysis were performed, as 
previously described (43–48). The ABSOLUTE computational algo-
rithm was performed to evaluate tumor ploidy and to establish evolu-
tionary relationship of the primary and metastatic disease as detailed 
in Supplementary Methods (49). To confirm that the discrepant 
mutations were actually absent in the paired sample, samples with 
discrepant mutations by whole-exome sequencing in genes present 
in an established targeted gene panel consisting of all exons of 243 
genes commonly mutated in GEA (Supplementary Table S1) were 
resequenced using the targeted panel to a mean target coverage of 
242.6×. Mutation calling was performed using MuTect v1.1.4 (50) 
and annotated by variant effector predictor (VEP; ref. 51). Mutation 
calls as well as the raw number of wild-type and mutant allele reads 
were compared between the paired primary and metastatic lesions. 
When a mutation was present in one sample, two mutant allele reads 
identified in the paired sample were considered evidence for a low-
level mutation to be present in that sample as well.

Cohort 2: Multiregion Targeted Sequencing of Matched 
Primary GEA Tumors, Lymph Node and Distant Metastases
We obtained 26 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded untreated, 
surgically resected GEAs with 1-4 synchronous LN metastases and/or 
metachronous distant metastases from Brigham and Women’s Hos-
pital (Boston, MA) and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pitts-
burgh, PA) following IRB approval. Metachronous metastases were 
collected from patients who received no systemic therapy following 
surgical resection. Geographically distinct areas of primary/metastases 
were macrodissected. DNA from distinct foci and paired germline DNA 
were subjected to massively parallel sequencing of exons of 243 genes 
(Supplementary Table S2) commonly altered in GEA. Mutation calling 
was performed using MuTect v1.1.4 (50) and annotated by VEP (51). 
Mutations detected in the paired normal sample were filtered out, and 
only “hotspot” mutations reported in COSMIC ≥3 times were included 
in the analysis. Selected findings were validated with IHC for ERBB2 
(HER2), or with FISH for KRAS, EGFR, MET, and CCND1.
Cohort 3: Targeted Sequencing of GEA Tumors and 
Correlation with Genomic Profiling of cfDNA
We compared genomic characterization of cfDNA and tumor pro-
filing from 11 metastatic GEAs. We collected plasma from patients 
consenting to CLIA-certified next-generation sequencing at Dana 
Farber/Brigham and Women’s Hospital Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) 
using a 305-gene panel (52). Tumor biopsy and plasma collection 
were performed within 4 weeks of each other. Ten patients underwent 
biopsy of the PT and one had a gastric LN sample. Tumor samples 
underwent review by a pathologist to confirm adequate tumor con-
tent and were subsequently macrodissected. From plasma, cfDNA 
was extracted and underwent low-pass whole-genome sequencing to 
∼1× coverage to enable evaluation of somatic copy-number profiles. 
The percentage of the cfDNA corresponding to tumor DNA was 
computationally derived to ensure adequate tumor content to detect 
copy-number alterations.
PANGEA: Platform Clinical Trial of Molecularly Driven 
Therapies in Patients with GEA
The PANGEA; NCT02213289 trial (University of Chicago) is a phase 
IIa, open-label, nonrandomized “platform” trial of chemotherapy plus 
molecularly directed therapies in previously untreated metastatic GEA 
(53, 54). The study assigns patients to treatment groups based on a 
prioritized algorithm: ERBB2+, MET+, FGFR2+, EGFR+, microsatellite 
unstable (MSI-H), and microsatellite stable (MSI-L) patients lacking 
the previously listed alterations (Fig. 4A). Patients in the first four 
groups were intended to receive 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxalipl-
atin (mFOLFOX6) plus monoclonal antibodies against ERBB2 (tras-
tuzumab; 6 mg/kg loading then 4 mg/kg), MET, FGFR2, or EGFR 
(ABT-806; 24 mg/kg). The study initiated with MET and FGFR2 arms 
treated with FOLFOX alone, with intention to amend the protocol 
when drugs are secured. MSI-H tumors received FOLFOX plus anti–
PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Relegation groups of MSI-L tumors without 
these targetable alterations received FOLFOX plus either anti-EGFR 
(ABT-806; 24 mg/kg) or anti-VEGFR2 antibody (ramucirumab; dose 
8 mg/kg; Supplementary Table S3) depending on EGFR expression 
by mass spectrometry. Baseline profiling includes Foundation One 
commercial next-generation sequencing panel performed on the PT 
and synchronous metastatic tumor biopsies, and cfDNA also collected 
for sequencing using Guardant360 commercial assay. ERBB2 testing is 
done on all tissue samples by standard methods (IHC/FISH) in parallel 
with next-generation sequencing of tumor and cfDNA. EGFR, MET, 
and FGFR2 amplification as well as MSI-H is initially determined by 
next-generation sequencing and is validated by IHC (and FISH for 
amplification) in all cases. Treatment is based on metastatic profiles 
when discordance is observed between PT and metastasis. FOLFOX 
is initiated immediately with targeted antibodies added as molecular 
results become available. Coprimary endpoints are feasibility, time to 
initiate targeted therapy, safety, and survival for the PANGEA strategy, 
as compared with historical controls. Secondary endpoints include rate 
of baseline genomic heterogeneity between PT and metastasis leading 
to altered treatment assignment, and response rate and progression-
free survival for each line of therapy. To date the study has enrolled 28 
of 68 planned patients; this interim analysis reports the baseline hetero-
geneity assessment for 28 patients. The study was approved by the IRB 
at University of Chicago, and written informed consent was obtained 
from all patients participating in the study.
