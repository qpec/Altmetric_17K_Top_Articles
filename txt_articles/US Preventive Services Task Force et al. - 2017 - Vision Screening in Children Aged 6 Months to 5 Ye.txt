 Vision Screening in Children Aged 6 Months to 5 Years
US Preventive Services Task Force
Recommendation Statement
US Preventive Services Task Force
IMPORTANCE One of the most important causes of vision abnormalities in children is
amblyopia (also known as “lazy eye”). Amblyopia is an alteration in the visual neural pathway
in a child’
s developing brain that can lead to permanent vision loss in the affected eye. Among
children younger than 6 years, 1% to 6% have amblyopia or its risk factors (strabismus,
anisometropia, or both). Early identification of vision abnormalities could prevent the
development of amblyopia.
SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS Studies show that screening rates among children vary by
race/ethnicity and family income. Data based on parent reports from 2009-2010 indicated
identical screening rates among black non-Hispanic children and white non-Hispanic children
(80.7%); however, Hispanic children were less likely than non-Hispanic children to report
vision screening (69.8%). Children whose families earned 200% or more above the federal
poverty level were more likely to report vision screening than families with lower incomes.
OBJECTIVE To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation
on screening for amblyopia and its risk factors in children.
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of vision screening
tests and the benefits and harms of vision screening and treatment. Surgical interventions
were considered to be out of scope for this review.
FINDINGS Treatment of amblyopia is associated with moderate improvements in visual acuity
in children aged 3 to 5 years, which are likely to result in permanent improvements in vision
throughout life. The USPSTF concluded that the benefits are moderate because untreated
amblyopia results in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss, and the benefits of screening and
treatment potentially can be experienced over a child’
s lifetime. The USPSTF found adequate
evidence to bound the potential harms of treatment (ie, higher false-positive rates in
low-prevalence populations) as small. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate
certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate for children aged 3 to 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The USPSTF recommends vision screening
at least once in all children aged 3 to 5 years to detect amblyopia or its risk factors.
(B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient
to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vision screening in children younger than
3 years. (I statement)

Rationale
Importance
Oneofthemostimportantcausesofvisionabnormalitiesinchildren
isamblyopia(alsoknownas“lazyeye”).Amblyopiaisanalterationin
the visual neural pathway in a child’
s developing brain that can lead
to permanent vision loss in the affected eye.1,2 It usually occurs in 1
eye but can occur in both. Risk factors associated with the develop-
ment of amblyopia include strabismus (ocular misalignment); vision
deprivation caused by media opacity (eg, cataracts); high, uncor-
rectedrefractiveerrors(eg,myopia,hyperopia,andastigmatism);and
anisometropia (Table 1). Other common causes of vision abnormali-
tiesarenonamblyopicstrabismusandnonamblyopicrefractiveerror.1
Among children younger than 6 years, 1% to 6% have amblyopia or
itsriskfactors(strabismus,anisometropia,orboth),which,ifleftun-
treated,couldleadtoamblyopia.1,3-7Earlyidentificationofvisionab-
normalities could prevent the development of amblyopia.
Detection
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools
are accurate in detecting vision abnormalities, including refractive
errors, strabismus, and amblyopia. The USPSTF found inadequate
evidence to compare screening accuracy across age groups (<3 vs
�3 years). Many studies of clinical accuracy did not enroll children
younger than 3 years.
Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of amblyo-
pia or its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years leads to improved
visual acuity. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of im-
provementinvisualacuityisofmoderatebenefit.TheUSPSTFfound
inadequateevidencethattreatmentreducedtheincidenceoflong-
term amblyopia or improved school performance, functioning, or

tiallyreducepsychosocialharms.TheUSPSTFfoundinadequateevi-
dence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children
younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes (ie, visual
acuity) or other benefits.
Harms of Early Detection and Treatment

ing tests in children aged 3 to 5 years, including higher false-positive

USPSTF Assessment
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vision screen-
ingtodetectamblyopiaoritsriskfactorsinchildrenaged3to5years
has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the ben-
efitsofvisionscreeningtodetectamblyopiaoritsriskfactorsinchil-

efits and harms cannot be determined for this age group.
Clinical Considerations
Patient Population Under Consideration
This recommendation applies to children aged 6 months to 5 years
(Figure 2).
Risk Factors Associated With Amblyopia
Although all children aged 3 to 5 years are at risk of vision abnor-
malities and should be screened, there are certain risk factors that
increaserisk.Riskfactorsforamblyopiaincludestrabismus;high,un-
corrected refractive errors (eg, myopia, hyperopia, and astigma-
tism); anisometropia; and media opacity.1-3 Additional risk factors
associated with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors include
familyhistoryinafirst-degreerelative,prematurity,lowbirthweight,
maternalsubstanceabuse,maternalsmokingduringpregnancy,and
low levels of parental education.1,8-13
Screening Tests
A variety of screening tests are used to identify vision abnormalities
inchildreninprimarycaresettings(Table2).Visualacuitytestsscreen
for visual deficits associated with amblyopia and refractive error.
Ocular alignment tests screen for strabismus. Stereoacuity tests as-
sess depth perception.1,14 For children younger than 3 years, screen-

 screening in children older than 3 years may include the red reflex
test, the cover-uncover test (for strabismus), the corneal light
reflex test, visual acuity tests (eg, Snellen, Lea Symbols [Lea-Test],
and HOTV [Precision Vision] charts), autorefractors and photo-
screeners, and stereoacuity tests.1,14 Children with positive findings
should be referred for a complete eye examination to confirm the
presence of vision problems and for further treatment.
Screening Interval
The USPSTF did not find adequate evidence to determine the op-
timal screening interval in children aged 3 to 5 years.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the specific condition and includes correc-
tion of any underlying refractive error with the use of corrective
lenses,occlusiontherapyforamblyopia(eg,eyepatching,atropine
eyedrops,orBangerterocclusionfoils),orsurgicalinterventionsfor
some causes of refractory strabismus.

benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section
of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

andinjuries,experiencingbullyingbehaviors,poorvisualmotorskills,
depression and anxiety, poor self-esteem, and problems at school
and work.21-25
Current Practice
Vision screening is routinely offered in most primary care settings.
Screening rates among children aged 3 years are approximately
40% and increase with age.1,26 One survey reported that 3% of
pediatricians began vision screening at age 6 months.1,27 Typical
components of vision screening include assessments of visual acu-
ity and strabismus. Younger children (<3 years) are often unable to
cooperate with some of the clinical screening tests performed in
clinical practice, such as visual acuity testing, which may result in
false-positive results. Some clinical practice guidelines now recom-
mend using handheld autorefractors and photoscreeners as alter-
native approaches to screening in children 6 months and older
because of improved child cooperation and improved accuracy.1,28
One potential disadvantage of using some types of photoscreeners
is the need for external interpretation of screening results. Children
with positive findings should be referred for a complete eye exami-
nation to confirm the presence of vision abnormalities and for fur-
ther treatment.
Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence. Well-designed
trials are needed to better understand the effects of screening vs
no screening, the optimal age for initiation of screening, and appro-
priate screening intervals. Additional studies are needed to deter-
mine the best screening approach and most favorable combina-
tions of screening tests in primary care. There is also a need for
studies that examine the benefits and harms of vision screening
and treatment in children younger than 3 years and the long-term
benefits and harms of preschool vision screening on health out-
comes, such as quality of life, school performance, developmental
trajectory, and functioning.

All children aged 3 to 5 years are at risk of vision abnormalities and should be screened; specific risk factors include strabismus,
refractive errors, and media opacity. Additional risk factors associated with amblyopia, strabismus, or refractive errors include
family history in a first-degree relative, prematurity, low birth weight, maternal substance abuse, maternal smoking during pregnancy,
and low levels of parental education.
Various screening tests are used in primary care to identify vision abnormalities in children, including the red reflex test, the
cover-uncover test, the corneal light reflex test, visual acuity tests (such as Snellen, LEA Symbols, and HOTV charts), autorefractors
and photoscreeners, and stereoacuity tests.
Treatments
Primary treatment includes correction of any underlying refractive error with the use of corrective lenses, occlusion therapy for
amblyopia (eye patching, atropine eye drops, or Bangerter occlusion foils), or a combination of treatments.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vision
screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children
aged 3 to 5 y has a moderate net benefit.
The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of vision screening to detect
amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 y are uncertain
and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF found 34 fair-quality studies (n = 45 588 observa-
tions) that assessed the accuracy of various screening tests: visual
acuity tests (6 studies), stereoacuity tests (4 studies), ocular align-
ment tests (1 study), combinations of clinical tests (4 studies),
autorefractors(16studies),photoscreeners(11studies),andretinal
birefringence scanning (1 study).1
Fourteen studies recruited participants from ophthalmology
clinicsand17studiesrecruitedfromHeadStart,community,orschool
settings; 2 studies were conducted in primary care settings, and 1
study did not report its setting. Across the studies, screening was
administered by diverse personnel such as pediatricians, orthop-
tists, ophthalmologists, nurses, and Head Start staff.1
Morethanhalfofthestudies(19studies)wereconductedinthe
United States. The remaining studies took place in Canada (5 stud-
ies), Europe (7 studies), and New Zealand or Australia (3 studies).
Study sample sizes ranged from 63 to 4040 participants. The age
of study participants ranged from 6 months to 6 years. About one-
third of study participants were younger than 3 years; most were 3
years and older.1 Many of the studies evaluating photoscreeners
(n = 6187 observations) included children younger than 3 years;
5 of the 16 studies evaluating autorefractors (n = 16 712 observa-
tions) included children younger than 3 years.1
The Vision In Preschoolers (VIP) study (n �4040) provided
data for several publications. The VIP study evaluated the accuracy
of multiple screening tests for a wide range of vision conditions. It
preferentially enrolled children aged 3 to 5 years from Head Start
with amblyopia, amblyopia risk factors, reduced visual acuity, or
strabismus.1,33 Phase 1 of the study compared the accuracy of 11
screeningtests.33Testingwasconductedinspeciallyequippedvans
that provided a standard environment with minimal distractions.
Phase 2 of the study compared screening performed by nurses vs
lay staff and focused on 4 of the 11 screening tests.34 The VIP study
evaluatedtheaccuracyofscreeningforabroaderrangeofvisioncon-
ditions than most other studies, including significant nonam-
blyogenic refractive error.

Direct Comparisons of Different Screening Tests

the Retinomax (Nikon), SureSight (Welch Allyn), and Power Refrac-
tor(Plusoptix)autorefractorshadhighersensitivityforidentifyingany

gies). However, LRs were similar. Positive LRs were generally in the
moderaterangeandnegativeLRswereinthesmalltominimalrange,
with overlapping confidence intervals.1,33
Age and Testability
Five studies evaluated whether the accuracy of different screening
tests(includingvisualacuitytests,acombinationofclinicaltests,an
autorefractor, and 2 photoscreeners) varies by age.1 Data were lim-
ited and estimates were imprecise. Most studies of test accuracy
(n = 45 588 observations) did not enroll children younger than 3
years. Accuracy did not clearly differ among preschool-aged chil-
dren by age group.1
Testability (the ability to complete the screening test) may
limit the usefulness of some clinical screening tests in children
younger than 3 years. Testability was reported in many of the
included studies; however, few reported data stratified by age or
for children younger than 3 years. Testability generally exceeded
80% to 90% in children aged 3 years, with small increases
through age 5 years. Studies that evaluated testability found bet-
ter testability rates in older children (�3 years); visual acuity and
stereoacuity tests had low testability rates in children younger
than 3 years.1 Some data suggest that photoscreeners have high
testability rates in children as young as 1 year.1 The VIP study found
testability rates near 100% (in children aged �3 years) for autore-
fractors and photoscreeners.1,33

ized trial within a population-based cohort study (Avon Longitudi-
nal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]) and the ALSPAC
cohort study. The studies assessed prevalence of amblyopia at age
7.5 years (using visual acuity testing); school performance, func-
tion, or quality of life outcomes were not evaluated.1,35,36 The
ALSPAC nested trial (n = 3490) compared earlier, more intensive
screening (at ages 8, 12, 18, 25, 31, and 37 months) vs 1-time screen-
ing at age 37 months.1,35 Periodic screening (including clinical
examination, a visual acuity test, and the cover-uncover test) from
ages 8 to 37 months was associated with a 1% decrease in the
prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years compared with 1-time
screening at age 37 months; however, the difference was only sta-
tistically significant for 1 of 2 definitions of amblyopia (interocular
difference in acuity �0.2 logMAR [logarithm of the minimum angle
of resolution], 1.5% vs 2.7%; relative risk, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.29-1.04];
and interocular difference in acuity �0.3 logMAR, 0.6% vs 1.8%;
relative risk, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15-0.86]).1,35 The ALPSPAC cohort

ALSPAChadseverallimitations.Amajorlimitationwasthehigh
overall attrition rate (about 55%) in both studies. Additional limita-
tions included inadequate randomization and the inability to parse
out the effects of earlier screening vs repeated screening. As a re-
sult, the USPSTF did not consider ALSPAC to be adequate direct
evidence.1,35,36
One fair-quality trial and 2 good-quality trials (n = 417) of older
preschool-aged children (mean age, 4-5 years) assessed the ben-
efits of eye patching for the treatment of amblyopia or its risk
factors.1,37-39 There were no trials in children younger than 3 years.
Two trials compared patching vs no patching (children were pre-
treated with eyeglasses if indicated in both groups).1,38,39 One
trial compared patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs
no treatment.1,37 Study sample sizes ranged from 60 to 180
participants.1 One of the 3 trials (evaluating patching plus eye-
glasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment) enrolled screen-
detected children.1,37 Treatment duration was 5 weeks, 12 weeks,
and 1 year; follow-up duration was 1 year, 12 weeks, and 1.5 years,
respectively.1,37 Trials were conducted in the United States or the
UnitedKingdom.1,37-39Thetrialsreportedbestcorrectedvisualacu-
ityandimprovementinvisualacuity(secondaryoutcome).1,37-39Re-
sults could not be pooled, due to differences in study populations
(eg, eligibility criteria and baseline visual acuity), outcome mea-
sures, comparisons, and length of follow-up.1
Patching improved visual acuity in the amblyopic eye by an av-
erageoflessthan1lineontheSnellenchartafter5to12weeksamong
children with amblyopia risk factors who were pretreated with
eyeglasses.1 More children treated with patching experienced im-
provement of at least 2 lines on the Snellen chart than did children
with no patching (45% vs 21%; P = .003). Patching plus eyeglasses
improved visual acuity by about 1 line on the logMAR chart after 1
year (0.11 logMAR [95% CI, 0.05-0.17]) among children with am-
blyopiariskfactorsnotpretreatedwitheyeglasses.1Eyeglassesalone

Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Potential harms of vision screening in preschool-aged children in-
clude psychosocial effects such as labeling and anxiety, unneces-
sary referrals due to false-positive results, overdiagnosis, and un-
necessary use of corrective lenses or treatments to prevent
amblyopia. Studies of screening test accuracy (n = 9723) found
higherfalse-positiverates(usually>75%)inpopulationswithalower
prevalence(<10%)ofvisionabnormalities,whereasstudiesinpopu-
lationswithahigherprevalenceofvisionabnormalitiesfoundlower
false-positive rates (usually <35%).1 No studies reported measures
of psychosocial distress, labeling, or anxiety. The ALSPAC prospec-
tive cohort study (n = 4473) evaluated bullying behaviors among
8-year-oldsinasubgroupofchildrentreatedwitheyepatching.The
likelihood of experiencing bullying behaviors was lower among
patched children offered screening at age 37 months than among
those not screened (25.7% vs 47.1%; P = .033; adjusted odds ratio,
0.39 [95% CI, 0.16-0.92]).1,36
Potentialharmsoftreatmentincludelossofvisualacuityinthe
amblyopic eye, psychological harms (eg, effects on child happi-
ness, behavioral problems, and parental concern or upset), inverse
amblyopia, and patch allergy. One fair-quality trial and 2 good-
quality trials (n = 417) assessed treatment harms1,37-40 and did not
reportsimilaroutcomes.Therewerenotrialsinchildrenyoungerthan

chological harms of treatment were evaluated in 144 of 177 study

dren were upset about treatment with patching than with eye-
glasses alone (85% vs 29% at age 4 years, P = .03; 62% vs 26% at

Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools
are accurate in detecting vision abnormalities. Accuracy did not
clearly differ among preschool-aged children by age group. Treat-
mentofamblyopiaisassociatedwithmoderateimprovementsinvi-
sual acuity in children aged 3 to 5 years, which are likely to result in
permanent improvements throughout life. The USPSTF concluded
that the benefits are moderate because untreated amblyopia re-
sults in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss, and the benefits of
screeningandtreatmentpotentiallycanbeexperiencedoverachild’
s
lifetime.TheUSPSTFfoundadequateevidenceonharmsofscreen-
ing (ie, higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations).
TheUSPSTFfoundadequateevidencetoboundthepotentialharms
of treatment as small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with mod-
erate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate for children
aged 3 to 5 years.
Trials that examined the benefits and harms of treatment did
not enroll children younger than 3 years. The USPSTF found inad-
equate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in
children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes
or other benefits. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the
harmsoftreatmentinchildrenyoungerthan3years.Therefore,the
USPSTFconcludesthatthebenefitsofscreeningtodetectamblyo-
pia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years are uncertain,
and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined
for this age group.

Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for
publiccommentontheUSPSTFwebsitefromFebruary28toMarch
27,2017.Somecommentsexpressedconcernaboutthescopeofthe
reviewforscreening.TheUSPSTFaddedlanguagetoclarifythatthe

with delaying screening until the age of 3 years. The USPSTF added
more language about the lack of evidence regarding screening and
treatment in children younger than 3 years to the Discussion sec-
tion. Last, some comments requested information about the ef-
fects of screening on learning and quality of life outcomes. The
USPSTF revised the Research Needs and Gaps section, which dis-
cusses these gaps in the evidence on outcomes.
Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation
This recommendation is an update of the USPSTF 2011 recom-
mendation,32 in which the USPSTF recommended vision screening
for amblyopia and its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years
(Brecommendation).TheUSPSTFconcludedthattheevidencewas
insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vision
screening in children younger than 3 years (I statement). The cur-
rent recommendation reaffirms the previous recommendation.
Recommendations of Others
In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Associa-
tion for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, American Acad-
emy of Certified Orthoptists, and American Academy of Ophthal-
mology released a joint clinical report recommending preschool
vision screening.41 The joint report recommends vision assess-
ment in children aged 6 months to 3 years with physical examina-
tion(eg,externalinspection,thefixationandfollowtest,theredre-
flextest,andpupilexamination).Instrument-basedvisionscreening
(with autorefractors or photoscreeners) may be used, when avail-
able,inchildrenaged1to3years.Visualacuityscreeningmaybeat-
tempted at age 3 years using HOTV or Lea Symbols charts; children
aged 4 to 5 years should have visual acuity assessed using HOTV or
LeaSymbolscharts,thecover-uncovertest,andtheredreflextest.1,41
The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends vi-
sionscreeninginallchildrenatleastoncebetweentheagesof3and
5 years to detect amblyopia or its risk factors; it concluded that the
currentevidenceisinsufficienttoassessthebalanceofbenefitsand
harms of vision screening in children younger than 3 years.42
The American Optometric Association recommends initial vi-
sion screening in infants at birth. Regular comprehensive eye ex-
aminations should occur at age 6 months, 3 years, and prior to en-
try into first grade; eye examinations should then occur at 2-year
intervals unless children are considered at high risk for vision
abnormalities.43
