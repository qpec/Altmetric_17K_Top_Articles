Dendritic cells (DC) are specialized sentinel cells that bridge the innate and adaptive
immune response and play a crucial role in shaping the adaptive immune response.
Vitamin D, a known epidemiological risk factor for the development of several
autoimmune diseases, influences the development of dendritic cells. Consequently,
vitamin D metabolites are frequently used in protocols to develop therapeutic dendritic
cell therapies for autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms by which vitamin D
modulates DC function remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of vitamin
D on murine CD11c+ bone marrow derived DC (BMDC) function by analyzing global
gene expression in CD11c+ BMDC generated in the presence (VitD-CD11c+BMDC) or
absence (Veh-CD11c+BMDC) of the active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Seven genes were significantly increased in expression in both
immature and LPS-matured VitD-CD11c+BMDC, one of which was CD31, a member
of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Gene knockdown of CD31 enhanced the ability
of VitD-CD11c+BMDC to prime naïve CD4+ T cells in vitro; conversely, increased
expression of CD31 on vehicle treated CD11c+BMDC restrained their T cell priming
abilities. Time-lapse imaging of BMDC and CD4+ T cells during in vitro priming revealed
that CD31 reduced the BMDC–T cell interaction time. Finally, we confirmed a similar effect
of 1,25(OH)2D3 on human CD34+ cell-derived CD11c+DC, whereby DC generated in the
presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 had increased CD31 expression. In summary, we show that
both mouse and human DC generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 upregulate CD31
expression, resulting in a reduced ability to prime CD4+ T cells by impairing a stable
cell-cell contact.

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Upregulates CD31 on DCs
INTRODUCTION
Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells
which play a crucial role in shaping the adaptive immune
response (1). They have the ability to either tolerize or activate T
cells depending on their activation status and concomitant
expression of co-stimulatory or inhibitory molecules. In the
absence of activation, antigen presentation by steady-state DC
can lead to T cell unresponsiveness and tolerance (1). In the
presence of co-stimulatory molecules, antigen presentation by
DC results in T cell activation.
A wide range of factors can influence the phenotype and
function of DC. One of the most widely studied molecules known
to alter the development of DC is the active vitamin D metabolite,
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) (2–5). The interest in
probing the effects of vitamin D on DC function has, in part,
been due to the wealth of data which now links suboptimal
vitamin D status to the development and progression of many
autoimmune diseases (6–8). Several groups have demonstrated
that DC generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 from either
bone marrow cells or monocytes have a reduced ability to prime
T cells in vitro and in many experimental systems can tolerize
T cells (9–12). These findings have led to the development of
clinical trials of tolerogenic 1,25(OH)2D3 conditioned DC in
human patients with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid
arthritis and multiple sclerosis (5, 13–15).
However,
the
mechanisms
by
which
1,25(OH)2D3
manipulates
the
phenotype
of
DC
remain
incompletely
understood. We, and others, have shown that the addition
of 1,25(OH)2D3 to bone marrow cell cultures leads to the
generation of BMDC which have lower MHC class II expression
alongside reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules such
as CD80 and CD86 (16, 17). Given the widespread impact
that 1,25(OH)2D3 can have on immune cells, it would appear
likely that additional co-stimulatory or inhibitory pathways
may be influenced by exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3. To explore
this further we performed a global gene expression analysis on
CD11c+BMDC generated in the absence (Veh-CD11c+BMDC)
or presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (VitD-CD11c+BMDC). We focused
our attention on CD11c+ cells for two key reasons; firstly,
CD11c+ cells are known to have potent antigen presenting
capacity and secondly, the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 is known
to lower the proportion of CD11c+ in murine BMDC cultures
(16, 17). Consequently, we wanted to evaluate gene expression in
cells which have the capacity to prime antigens and did not want
to confound our data by including cells which were CD11c− and
did not express MHC class II molecules.
Here, we present microarray results on this defined population
which demonstrate that the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted
in a large number of differentially expressed genes. Specifically,
we discovered that CD31 was one of only seven genes whose
expression was upregulated in both immature and LPS-matured

VitD-CD11c+BMDC. CD31 is a 130-kDa member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily, a single-chain transmembrane
glycoprotein with six C2-type Ig-like extracellular domains, and
a cytoplasmic tail containing two immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (18, 19). CD31 is concentrated
at endothelial tight junctions where it supports endothelial cell
layer integrity (20), and is also expressed at lower levels on
platelets and most leukocytes (21). CD31 mostly facilitates cell-
cell adhesion via trans-homophilic interactions (22, 23), but has
also been reported to interact in a heterophilic manner via CD177
(24), αvβ3 (25), glycosaminoglycans (26), and CD38 (27). Not
surprisingly, CD31 has been implicated in mediating leukocyte
migration across the endothelial cell layer (28), but has also
drawn attention as a potential immunomodulatory molecule
important for communication between immune cells, e.g., as a
detachment signal between live neutrophils and macrophages
(29), and as a co-inhibitory molecule on T cells (21) and DC
(30). Very little is known about the factors which regulate CD31
expression in immune cells.
Here, we present data revealing 1,25(OH)2D3 as a potent
inducer of CD31 expression on BMDC, and identify increased
CD31 levels on BMDC as a novel mechanism by which
1,25(OH)2D3 restrains the ability of BMDC to prime naïve
CD4+ T cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice, Antigens, and Tissue Culture Medium
B10.PLxC56BL/6 (CD45.2) and Tg4 (CD45.1) mice were bred
under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of
Edinburgh. All experiments had local ethical approval from the
University of Edinburgh’s Animal Welfare and Ethical Review
Body and were performed in accordance with UK legislation.
All mice used in the experiments reported were female as
this allowed for standardization of experiment groups and
permitted the housing of mice from different litters in the same
experimental cage. The mice were maintained in individually
ventilated cages, and were between 8 and 12 weeks old when
used for experiments. The housing facility was compliant with
Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations
guidelines on screening mice for infectious diseases. Tg4 mice
express a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing the Ac1-9
peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP) in association with I-Au
(31). The MBP Ac1-9 (4Tyr) analog peptide was obtained from
Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Teesside, UK). To obtain cell
culture medium, RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin,
and 5 × 10−5 M 2-ME (all from Gibco, Paisley, UK) and 10%
heat-inactivated FCS (Labtech, East Sussex, UK).
Generation and Stimulation of Murine
BMDC
BMDC were generated in the presence of recombinant GM-
CSF (Peprotech, London, UK) for 9 days as previously described
(32). Briefly, bone marrow was collected from femurs and
tibias of B10.PLxC57BL/6 mice, and clusters within the bone
marrow suspension were dispersed by vigorous pipetting. Red

blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK) for 1 min and cells subsequently washed once in
cell culture medium. Cells were seeded into the center of 6 well
plates at 2 × 105/ml in 2 ml of cell culture medium with the
addition of 20 ng/ml GM-CSF. At day 3, a further 2 ml of cell
culture medium containing 20 ng/ml GM-CSF was added to each
well. On day 6, 2 ml of culture supernatant was removed and
replaced with 2 ml fresh culture medium containing 20 ng/ml
GM-CSF. Vehicle (100% ethanol) or 1,25(OH)2D3 was added to
the BMDC culture media at the concentration indicated in the
text initially and at all subsequent media changes. At day 9, the
BMDC cells were harvested and CD11c+ cells were isolated by
FACS (Supplementary Figure 1). The CD11c+ BMDC were re-
plated at 2 × 106 BMDC/ml in cell culture medium, 5 ng/ml
of GM-CSF with 0.1 µg/ml Ac1-9(4Tyr) MBP for an additional
18 h. 0.1 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to some
overnight CD11c+ BMDC cultures (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset UK).
No 1,25(OH)2D3 was added to the culture media during the
overnight stimulation with LPS and MBP. Cytokines were
measured in BMDC supernatants by Ready-SET-Go ELISA as per
manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience, San Diego, USA).
Generation of Human DC From Mobilized
Peripheral Blood CD34+ Progenitor Cells
CD34+ cells were obtained from a commercial source (AllCells,
LLC., Alameda, CA, USA). The CD34+ cells had been isolated by
positive selection with an immunomagnetic bead system, from
volunteer mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ stem/progenitor
cell donations following informed consent. CD34+ progenitors
were cultured in Iscove Basal Medium (Biochrom) with BIT
9500 Serum Substitute (Stemcell Technologies), 100 ng/ml SCF
(Pharmacy), 100 ng/ml FLT3L (Peprotech), and 50 ng/ml TPO
(Peprotech). Medium was replenished every 4 days by addition
to cultures and splitting into fresh flasks to maintain optimum
culture conditions.
After
3
weeks,
expanded
cells
were
differentiated
to
DC by culture in TexMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotech)
supplemented with 50 ng/ml GM-CSF (Peprotech) and 15 ng/ml
IL-4 (Peprotech), in the presence of 20 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 or
vehicle (100% ethanol). Seven days later, cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry.
RNA Extraction and Microarray Analysis of
BMDC
RNA was extracted from CD11c+BMDC using commercially
available kits (RNeasy Mini Kit). RNA integrity number (RIN
>8) was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyser and RNA 6000
Pico kit (Agilent, CA, USA). Sense strand cDNA preparation
from RNA samples was generated and labeled using Ambion WT
expression kit (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and Affymetrix
Gene Chip-WT terminal labeling kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse
Gene 2.1 ST 16-Array Plate (Affymetrix, CA, USA). Raw data
was normalized using robust multichip average method and
principal component analysis created using Genomics suite
(Partek Incorporated, MO, USA).
Primary Tg4 CD4+ T Cell Activation Assays
To study the primary activation of Tg4 CD4+ T cells, varying
numbers (as stated) of BMDC (CD45.2) were cultured with 2 ×
104 Tg4 CD4+ T cells (CD45.1) per well in a round bottomed, 96
well plate. The CD4+ T cells were purified using microbeads as
per manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK).
Tg4 CD4+ T cell production of cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α, GM-CSF,
and IFN-γ) was assessed in culture supernatants by Ready-SET-
Go ELISA (eBioscience, San Diego, USA). IL-2 was measured
in supernatants after 48 h of culture and IFN-γ, TNF-α, and
GM-CSF were measured after 72 h of culture.
Lentiviral Transduction of BMDC for
Modulation of CD31 Expression
To investigate the effects of CD31 expression on the ability of
CD11c+BMDC to prime CD4+ T cells, lentiviral constructs
expressing GFP and murine CD31 or murine CD31 siRNA
were
developed.
For
the
CD31
overexpression
construct
(pLenti6-cppt-CMV-mCD31-IRES-emGFP-opre),
murine
platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (Pecam-1; mCD31)
isoform 3 (NM_001305157.1) was synthesized by Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT, Leuven, Belgium). The synthetic
gene was flanked by attB1 and attB5r GATEWAY cloning
sites (Thermo Fisher Scientific: Invitrogen UK) and a Kozak
consensus overlapped the start codon. Using GATEWAY
technology this was used to create the lentiviral shuttle vector
pLenti6-cppt-CMV-mCD31-IRES-emGFP-opre (33). Negative
control lacked mCD31. By partially concentrating lentivirus in
Optimem (Invitrogen, UK) titers of 107 transduction units/ml
(TU/ml) were obtained.
For siRNA-expressing vectors, knock down target sequences
within mCD31 were identified by a combination of literature
searches and the output of the Invitrogen Block-iT RNAi designer
web program. A scrambled sequence was used as a negative
control. The synthesized oligonucleotides were annealed, then
inserted into pcDNA6.2-GW_emGFP-miR 285, 816, and 1827,
with numbers identifying the target distance from the start
codon of mCD31 (Table 1). These were shuttled into pLenti6.2-
cppt-CMV-DEST-opre using GATEWAY (Invitrogen, UK), and
packaged. Titers of 108 TU/ml were routinely obtained.
Six days following BMDC induction, cells were seeded at 5 ×
105 cells/well in a 24 well cell culture dish in 1 ml cell culture
medium and lentiviral constructs added at an MOI of 20. For
CD31 overexpression lentiviral constructs, 6 µg/ml DEAE were
added to enhance transduction efficiency. Two days later, BMDC
were stimulated for 18 h as described above and CD11c+GFP+
BMDC isolated by FACS prior to further experimentation.
Preparation of Spleen Mononuclear Cells
and FACS Analysis
Single cell suspensions were made from the spleen and
draining lymph nodes, red blood cells were lysed using
an ammonium chloride buffer (Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK),
and cells were then re-suspended in FACS buffer (PBS,
2% fetal calf serum, 0.01% sodium azide (Sigma Aldrich,
Dorset, UK). Fc receptors were blocked with supernatant from

FACS data were collected using a 6 laser LSR Fortessa (BD
Biosciences, New Jersey, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Olten, Switzerland).
PrimeFlow RNA Assay
Murine BMDC were stained with fixable viability dye for
30 min at 4◦C, washed once, and stained for surface markers of
interest (anti-CD11c-PE-Cy7, anti-CD31-PE, anti-CD86-bv785,
and anti-MHC-II-PE-ef610) for 30 min at 4◦C, followed by
another washing step. PrimeFlow RNA assay was performed for
CD31 mRNA (VB4-10932) as per manufacturer’s instructions
(Affymetrix). Briefly, cells were fixed in PrimeFlow RNA Fixation
Buffer 1 for 30 min at 4◦C, then washed twice in PrimeFlow RNA
Permeabilization Buffer supplemented with RNAse Inhibitors,
and fixed in PrimeFlow RNA Fixation Buffer 2 for 60 min at
room temperature. Following two washing steps with PrimeFlow
Wash Buffer, target probe hybridization was performed for 2 h
at 40◦C. Samples were washed twice again in PrimeFlow RNA
Wash Buffer and stored overnight in PrimeFlow RNA Wash
Buffer supplemented with RNAse Inhibitor 1. The following
day, consecutive signal amplification steps were performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions at 40◦C, prior to sample
acquisition on a BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer (BD biosciences).
Time-Lapse Imaging
BMDC transduced with control or CD31 overexpressing
lentiviral vector were stimulated for 4 h with 0.1 µg/ml LPS and
0.1 µg/ml 4Y peptide. CD11b+CD11c+GFP+ cells were FACS
sorted and re-plated onto poly-L-lysine coated glass-bottom
plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/ml in cell culture medium.
After overnight adhesion, BMDC were carefully washed twice in
PBS before naïve CD4+ T cells from the spleen of a Tg4 (CD45.1)
mouse were slowly added at a 4:1 ratio in phenol red-free HBSS.
Brightfield images (5 randomly selected fields in each well) were
acquired every 30 s using an Axiovert 200 microscope in a CO2-
supplemented chamber at 37◦C. Movies of cells were tracked
in Fiji ImageJ to determine the duration of interaction between
BMDC and CD4+ T cells.
Statistical Analysis
For the bioinformatic analyses, a total of 20 arrays (n = 3
Veh-CD11c+BMDC no LPS, n = 3 VitD-CD11c+BMDC
no LPS, n = 6 Veh-CD11c+BMDC LPS, n = 8 VitD-
CD11c+BMDC LPS) were assessed for quality control using
the
arrayQualityMetrics
package
in
Bioconductor
(www.
bioconductor.org). log2 expression values for the high quality
arrays were quantile normalized. Pairwise group comparisons
were undertaken using linear modeling with the limma package
in Bioconductor. Subsequently, empirical Bayesian analysis
was applied, including vertical (within a given comparison)
p-value adjustment for multiple testing, which controls for
false-discovery rate. An adjusted p-value of <0.05 was applied
as the significance threshold. Functional enrichment analyses
of KEGG pathways associated with the significant loci were
performed using hypergeometric tests (34). Focused genes
of interest lists were assembled from the literature and other
publicly available resources. Statistical analysis of cytokine
results was performed using a two tailed Student’s t-test.
Cytokine concentrations are presented as mean concentration
±SEM. The proportion of T cell and BMDC interactions which
were <5 min was compared between Veh-CD11c+BMDC and
VitD-CD11c+BMDC by a Fisher’s exact test. Significance was set
at p < 0.05.
RESULTS
Addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 to BMDC Cultures
Leads to Altered Gene Expression Profiles
in CD11c+BMDC
1,25(OH)2D3 and vehicle conditioned BMDC were generated
as described in materials and methods. After 9 days of
culture, CD11c+ cells were isolated by FACS and cultured
overnight in 1,25(OH)2D3 free media in the presence or
absence of LPS. Global gene expression analysis revealed that
101 genes were downregulated and 24 were upregulated in
non-LPS stimulated VitD-CD11c+BMDC compared to Veh-
CD11c+BMDC (Figure 1A). The number of genes differentially
expressed in VitD-CD11c+BMDC increased following LPS
stimulation, with 254 genes downregulated and 178 upregulated
(Figure 1A). The genes with the greatest upregulation and
downregulation in VitD-CD11c+BMDC compared to Veh-
CD11c+BMDC are shown in Tables 2–5. The gene expression
datasets for this study can be found in the Gene Expression
Omnibus, accession number GSE114768.

CD31 Expression Is Increased on
VitD-CD11c+BMDC
There were 47 genes which were differential expressed in VitD-
CD11c+BMDC (in both immature and LPS-matured cells),
of which 7 were upregulated and 40 were downregulated
(Figure 1B). The 7 upregulated genes were Pecam1, Cd300ld,
Adgre1, Epb41l3, Srgap3, Klk1b1, and Mmp8. The increased
expression of CD31 in VitD-CD11c+BMDC was striking
given recent studies which have indicated that CD31 plays
an important role in regulating a wide range of leukocytes
(30, 35). The increased mRNA expression of CD31 in non-
LPS stimulated VitD-CD11c+BMDC was confirmed by flow
cytometric evaluation of CD31 mRNA (Figure 1C). Protein
expression of CD31 on VitD-CD11c+BMDC was subsequently
examined by flow cytometry which demonstrated an increase in
CD31 expression on BMDC which had been conditioned with
20 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 (Figure 1D). This increase was dependent
on the dose of 1,25(OH)2D3, with sequential increases in
CD31 expression occurring in CD11c+BMDC which had been
generated in the presence of 5, 10, and 15 nM of 1,25(OH)2D3
(Supplementary Figure 2A). The increase in expression of CD31
on VitD-CD11c+BMDC was an early event with high levels
of CD31 detectable on VitD-CD11c+BMDC as early as day
3 of the BMDC cultures (Supplementary Figure 2B). When
1,25(OH)2D3 was added to the BMDC culture on day 3 or
day 6, rather than on day 0, CD31 levels were still upregulated
on day 9, although at lower levels compared to BMDC which
were cultured in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 since the
beginning of the culture (Supplementary Figure 2C). However,
when 1,25(OH)2D3 was added to or removed from Veh-
CD11c+BMDC or VitD-CD11c+BMDC, respectively, during
overnight stimulation with LPS, no change in CD31 levels
was observed (Supplementary Figure 2D), indicating that CD31
levels are determined during the generation, not the maturation,
of BMDC.
CD31 Expression on VitD-CD11c+BMDC
Restrains Their Ability to Prime CD4+ T
Cells
CD31 is expressed on both naïve and activated CD4+ T
cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Consequently, it would be
challenging to dissect the role of CD31 expression in the ability
of BMDC to prime CD4+ T cells in vitro by adding a blocking
CD31 antibody to the BMDC-T cell co-cultures, as this would
also affect CD31 availability on T cells. To precisely explore
the role of CD31 expression in CD11c+BMDC function, we
used lentiviral constructs to either upregulate or downregulate

CD31 expression. Initially, we produced three siRNA lentivirus
constructs. Both control vectors and siRNA constructs were
effective in transducing BMDC (Figure 2A). The transduction
efficiency increased as multiplicity of infection (MOI) range was
increased from 1 to 50 (Supplementary Figure 4A). Construct
1827 was able to reduce the expression of CD31 most effectively
and was used in all subsequent experiments (Figure 2B). There
was no increase in the extent of CD31 downregulation with
increasing MOI (Supplementary Figure 4B).
Following transduction with lentiviral constructs there was
little change in the numbers of viable cells in the cultures.
There was no difference in the number of viable cells in
VitD-CD11c+BMDC cultures transduced with negative control
vector containing a scrambled siRNA compared to vectors
encoding CD31 siRNA (Supplementary Figure 4C). Following
the transduction with CD31 siRNA lentivirus, CD31 expression
was successfully decreased with no significant changes to MHC
class II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression compared to control
vector treated CD11c+BMDC (Supplementary Figure 5A).

containing a scrambled siRNA or CD31 siRNA construct were
co-cultured with naïve cognate CD4+ T cells. IL-2 production
was significantly increased in co-cultures of CD4+ T cells and
VitD-CD11c+BMDC which had CD31 expression reduced
by the siRNA encoding vector (Figure 2C). In addition,
production of IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and TNF-α was also increased
following priming by VitD-CD11c+BMDC with reduced CD31
expression (Figure 2C).
Overexpression of CD31 Expression on
Veh-CD11c+BMDC Reduces Their Ability
to Prime CD4+ T Cells
To examine the effects of increased CD31 expression on
CD11c+BMDC, a GFP-CD31 lentiviral construct was developed.
The construct was readily incorporated into a proportion of host
cells and GFP+ cells had a marked increase in CD31 expression
(Figure 3A). There was a reduction in IL-2 production by CD4+
T cells that were co-cultured with Veh-CD11c+BMDC over
expressing CD31 (Figure 3B). In addition, pro-inflammatory
cytokine production was also reduced from CD4+ T cells
co-cultured with Veh-CD11c+BMDC over expressing CD31
(Figure 3B). The proportion of cells which were dividing and
activated was lower in T cells stimulated with BMDC over
expressing CD31 (Figure 3C). Lentiviral induction of CD31
overexpression had no influence on the levels of MHC class
II, CD40, CD80 and CD86 expression in Veh-CD11c+BMDC
(Supplementary Figure 5B) or increase the proportion of T
cells which expressed Foxp3 (Supplementary Figure 5C). Taken
together, the genetic manipulation experiments, which allowed us
to both overexpress and downregulate CD31, demonstrated that
CD31 on BMDC is a potent regulator of CD4+ T cell priming.

progenitor cells were isolated from mobilized blood and

a marked increase in CD31 expression when generated in
the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, suggesting that 1,25(OH)2D3
could modulate DC function through CD31 not only in mice,
but also in humans (Figures 5A,B). When CD11b+CD11c+
cells were sorted and re-plated overnight with or without
LPS, cells generated in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 were
able to maintain high CD31 levels whereas control cells
showed a considerable reduction in CD31 expression upon

our approach on studying the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on
CD11c+BMDC since we have previously established that
1,25(OH)2D3 leads to the development of a higher proportion
of CD11c− cells in GM-CSF-supplemented bone marrow
cell cultures (16). Many of the CD11c− cells in 1,25(OH)2D3
conditioned BMDC do not express cell surface markers
such as MHC class II molecules which are considered
to be a critical feature of DC (16). Consequently, the
gene changes we observed are within the BMDC subset

of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC-II, and pro-inflammatory
cytokines (36). We were therefore particularly interested in genes
whose expression was upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3, and their
functional relevance in DC biology. For further investigation,
we focused on genes which were upregulated robustly in both
immature and LPS-matured VitD-CD11c+BMDC; one of the
seven genes fitting this criterion was CD31. CD31 is a member
of the Ig superfamily and highly expressed on endothelial cells
but also on platelets and the majority of leukocytes (37) and plays
an important role in transendothelial migration (38, 39). Beyond
its role in cell-cell contact and migration, CD31 has also been
found to act as a co-inhibitory molecule on both T cells (21) and
DC (30).
1,25(OH)2D3 as a Novel Transcriptional
Regulator of CD31 Expression in BMDC
Very little is known about the regulation of CD31 expression
in immune cells. In naïve T cells, downregulation of CD31
expression has been observed in association with homeostatic
proliferation (40). Human memory T cells, on the other hand,
have been reported to acquire CD31 expression following
trans-endothelial migration in vitro (41). Conversely, in mouse
leukocytes, CD31 expression has consistently been found to be
reduced upon transmigration through the endothelial cell layer,
both in vitro (42) and in vivo (43, 44), although the details of the
mechanisms involved and the functional implications of these
expression changes are at present unclear. The data presented
here reveal a strong influence of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the expression
levels of CD31 in mouse and human DC and thereby provide a
first insight into transcriptional control of this multifunctional
glycoprotein. In human DC, CD31 is known to be downregulated
upon maturation (45, 46). The reduction in the expression of this
co-inhibitory molecule upon DC maturation is thought to allow
for an adequate immune response to be mounted upon encounter
of infective agents and is likely to play an important role in
balancing immune tolerance vs. immunity. In line with this,
we observed a downregulation of CD31 expression on human
mBDC when matured in the presence of LPS. Strikingly, the
presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced CD31 levels in immature
DC and stabilized CD31 expression during DC maturation with
LPS. This suggests that the stably enhanced CD31 expression
on human DC through 1,25(OH)2D3 could contribute to the
tolerogenic effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, as observed in mouse BMDC.
Interestingly, we did not observe a reduction in CD31 expression
on mouse BMDC matured in the presence of LPS, which does not
align with results from Clement et al. (30). In their study, they
observe that following LPS stimulation, a subgroup of BMDC
that exhibit a more pronounced activation status as defined
by higher MHC-II and CD80 expression than the majority of
BMDC have slightly lower CD31 expression. However, an overall
comparison of CD31 expression between immature and LPS-
matured BMDC was not made, and this difference in analysis
may account for the distinct observations made. In 1,25(OH)2D3
conditioned BMDC, however, CD31 expression was greatly
enhanced, and high CD31 expression levels were retained
upon stimulation with LPS. The details of this 1,25(OH)2D3-
dependent transcriptional control of CD31 expression in mouse
and human DC deserve further investigation, and more extensive
studies are required to address the transcriptional regulation of
CD31 in other cell types which express the Vitamin D receptor
and could respond to changes in 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations.

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Upregulates CD31 on DCs
CD31 Expressed by DC Controls DC—T
Cell Interaction Time and T Cell Priming
CD31 contains six extracellular Ig C2-type domains. These enable
transhomophilic binding of CD31 on adjacent cells (22, 23),
but have also been reported to allow heterophilic binding of
αVβ3 (25), glycosaminoglycans (26) and CD38 on lymphocytes
(27). Mechanistically, we were able to show that high CD31
expression on BMDC led to reduced interaction times with
CD4+ T cells during in vitro priming. This observation is
consistent with results published by Brown et al. who elegantly
showed that neutrophil CD31 engagement with macrophages
induced a detachment signal in neutrophils, thereby avoiding
engulfment by the APC (29). Apoptotic neutrophils, however,
lacked the intracellular signal and were not able to detach
from macrophages, resulting in apoptotic neutrophil engulfment.
In the case of BMDC, as presented in the present study,
1,25(OH)2D3-induced elevated CD31 expression led to reduced
interaction time and consequently reduced priming of CD4+
T cells. Whether this mechanism involves transhomophilic or
heterophilic binding of CD31 has not been established in the
present study, but we show that CD31 is expressed on both
naïve and activated CD4+ T cells. This does not exclude
the possibility that CD31 interaction between BMDC and T
cells does not also lead to inhibitory downstream signaling in
BMDC themselves or T cells in this setting. The cytosolic ITIM
domains of CD31, when phosphorylated, recruit Src homology 2
(SH2) domain-containing proteins, e.g., SH2 domain containing
protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (47). In CD4+
T cells, CD31 downstream signaling has been shown by several
groups to have inhibitory effects on TCR downstream signaling
(35). The reduced activation of T cells during in vitro priming
with CD31-enriched BMDC may therefore well be the result of a
combination of reduced interaction time and CD31 signaling in
T cells.
In DC, CD31 has more recently been proposed to act as a
co-inhibitory molecule via SHP-1 (30). Clement et al. used a
stimulatory CD31 peptide to show that sustained CD31 signaling
in DC led to reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules such
as CD40 and CD86, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine
production (30). In the present study, CD31 expression was
modulated, rather than changing its signaling, and altered
CD31 expression patterns did not result in changes in surface
expression of co-stimulatory molecules. DC tolerized by culture
with 1,25(OH)2D3 have been shown to induce regulatory T cells,
and would therefore be a potential mechanism by which CD31
could confer its tolerogenic effect. However, no increase in Treg
induction during in vitro priming of T cells with CD31-enriched
BMDC was observed in this study. In contrast, Clement et al.
reported an increase in the Treg pool in vivo when mice were
injected with DC matured in the presence of stimulating CD31
peptide, attributed to the enhanced secretion of TGF-β and IL-
10 (30). It appears that CD31 signaling induced by a soluble
CD31 peptide alters the phenotype and cytokine expression
pattern of DC toward a more tolerogenic phenotype, which
consequently induce regulatory T cells and have an attenuated
ability to prime conventional T cells. The present study shows
that the overexpression of CD31 in BMDC per se, using lentiviral
constructs, does not induce a change in BMDC phenotype. The
observed reduction in T cell priming by CD31-enriched BMDC
is therefore likely a direct result of CD31 binding and not
confounded by an altered BMDC phenotype indirectly leading
to changes in T cell priming.
1,25(OH)2D3-Induced CD31 Expression on
DC: Implications for Treatment of
Autoimmune and Chronic Inflammatory
Disease?
The use of tolerogenic DC as cell therapy in autoimmune
and chronic inflammatory diseases is considered a potential
breakthrough in personalized medicine and antigen-specific
therapy (5, 15). Although numerous protocols have been
described to generate tolerogenic DC, 1,25(OH)2D3 is one
of the most widely used molecules to generate DC with a
tolerogenic phenotype (15). A key attribute of tolerogenic DC
is to suppress autopathogenic T cells which may be through
the induction of anergy or apoptosis or via the induction
of regulatory T cells (5). Prevention of further activation of
effector T cells is clearly an important attribute of tolerogenic
DC; our study indicates that 1,25(OH)2D3 mediated increase
in CD31 expression may be one way in which 1,25(OH)2D3
could restrain priming ability in tolerogenic DC used in clinical
therapies. Our work suggests that evaluation of CD31 expression
on tolerogenic DC may be informative on their priming
ability prior to administration to patients. In addition, genetic
manipulation of CD31 expression may further improve the safety
profile of tolerogenic DC by lessening their capacity to activate
effector T cells.
CONCLUSION
The factors that control CD31 expression on BMDC have been
poorly explored to date. This is the first study to demonstrate
that the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3 can enhance
CD31 expression in both mouse and human DC. CD31 acts as
a co-inhibitory molecule and prevents effective T cell priming at
least in part by reducing the interaction time between BMDC and
naïve T cells. This finding is an important demonstration that the
failure of 1,25(OH)2D3 conditioned BMDC to effectively prime T
cells is not simply due to the reduced expression of MHC class II
and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD86.
Exposure of BMDC during development to 1,25(OH)2D3 is
critical in the upregulation of inhibitory pathways which further
restrain the ability of BMDC to prime T cells.
