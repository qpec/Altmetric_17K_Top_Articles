Abstract. A randomized trial (VITACOG) in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) found that B vitamin treatment to
lower homocysteine slowed the rate of cognitive and clinical decline. We have used data from this trial to see whether baseline
omega-3 fatty acid status interacts with the effects of B vitamin treatment. 266 participants with MCI aged ≥70 years were
randomized to B vitamins (folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12) or placebo for 2 years. Baseline cognitive test performance, clinical
dementia rating (CDR) scale, and plasma concentrations of total homocysteine, total docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic
acids (omega-3 fatty acids) were measured. Final scores for verbal delayed recall, global cognition, and CDR sum-of-boxes were
better in the B vitamin-treated group according to increasing baseline concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, whereas scores in
the placebo group were similar across these concentrations. Among those with good omega-3 status, 33% of those on B vitamin
treatment had global CDR scores >0 compared with 59% among those on placebo. For all three outcome measures, higher
concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid alone significantly enhanced the cognitive effects of B vitamins, while eicosapentaenoic
acid appeared less effective. When omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are low, B vitamin treatment has no effect on cognitive
decline in MCI, but when omega-3 levels are in the upper normal range, B vitamins interact to slow cognitive decline. A clinical
trial of B vitamins combined with omega-3 fatty acids is needed to see whether it is possible to slow the conversion from MCI
to AD.

INTRODUCTION
Trials to delay or prevent cognitive decline and
Alzheimer’s disease with nutrients are increasingly rel-
evant due to the lack of new drugs to treat older persons
with cognitive impairment. It is likely that the earlier
treatment or preventative measures are introduced, the
better the resulting efficacy of intervention for those

with memory impairment, since the loss of neural net-
works is not as great at early stages of cognitive decline
as it is when dementia has become established.
Nutrients involved in different metabolic pathways
that have shown some positive effects on cognition
include B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids [1–3].
Inadequate B vitamin status results in accumula-
tion of homocysteine, a non-essential amino acid.
Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a recog-
nized modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment,
Alzheimer’s disease [4], and other dementias [5].
Treatment trials with B vitamins have given conflict-
ing results on cognitive outcomes [6–8], but some trials
carried out specifically on people with elevated tHcy
concentrations have shown positive outcomes. The
FACIT (Folate after Coronary Intervention Trial) trial
[9] of folate treatment for those with baseline tHcy con-
centrations >13 �mol/L showed a slowing of decline in
several cognitive domains and improved performance
in episodic memory tests in healthy older people.
The VITACOG trial showed that a B vitamin supple-
ment (folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12) in older adults
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) slowed the rate
of global [10] and regional brain atrophy [11] and
maintained verbal episodic memory, semantic mem-
ory, and global cognitive performance (Mini-Mental
State Examination, MMSE), but only for those with
high baseline tHcy concentrations. After 2 years on B
vitamins, more than half of those with elevated tHcy
reverted from MCI back to control status, assessed by
the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale [12].
Eating fish rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
acids, such as the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), protects
against the onset of dementia [5]. DHA constitutes
30%–40% of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
in grey matter cerebral cortex [13]. Intervention trials
with DHA and EPA supplements have, like B vitamin
trials, given conflicting results on cognitive outcomes
[14, 15]. Some trials suggest that older adults with
mild cognitive deficits may benefit more from omega-3
fattyacidsupplementsthanthosewithAlzheimer’sdis-
ease[16–19].Benefitsinvisuospatialepisodicmemory
were seen after 6 months of supplementation with
DHA alone in older adults with mild age-related cog-
nitive decline [18]. Furthermore, in subjects with MCI,
EPA plus DHA improved general cognitive perfor-
mance [17] and letter fluency [20]. A meta-analysis
of ten omega-3-fatty acid randomized controlled trials
reported a benefit for attention and processing speed
in those with cognitive impairment but no dementia
[21], while a more recent meta-analysis of studies on
the memory domain (episodic, sematic, and working
memory) showed that DHA, with or without EPA, con-
tributes to improved memory function in older adults
with mild memory complaints [19].
Differences in trial design may account for some
of the inconsistency in results [8, 14]. Nutritional
interventions to remediate cognition are influenced by
factors such as the stage of cognitive decline, the extent
of nutritional deficiency of the investigated population,
the applied nutrient and its dose, and the duration of the
intervention [22, 23]. Effects will likely be smaller in
healthy adults or those with advanced cognitive impair-
ment [24]. It has also been proposed that combinations
of different nutrients might be more effective than sup-
plementation with single nutrients [3, 25].
In this regard, it is noteworthy that links between
omega-3 fatty acids and homocysteine have been sug-
gested [26]. Homocysteine has a role in regulating
phospholipid metabolism and omega-3 distribution via
the methionine cycle. In turn, B vitamins are important
for the synthesis of phospholipids. The question arises:
is there a beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the
disease-modifying actions of B vitamins in MCI? We
have already shown that in VITACOG a good omega-
3 fatty acid status enhances the protective effect of B
vitamins on brain atrophy, the primary trail outcome
[27]. In this report, we analyze the VITACOG trial
data to see if there is an interaction between baseline
omega-3 fatty acid status and B vitamin treatment on
the secondary cognitive and clinical outcomes of the
trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Therecruitmentmethodsandconsentprocessforthe
VITACOG trial, the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
and the neuropsychological tests have been described
previously [10, 12]. 266 participants 70 years and over
with MCI [28] were randomized either to high dose
B vitamins (n = 133) or placebo for 2 years. Baseline
demographics (age, gender, education) and blood lev-
els of tHcy, vitamin B12, serum folate, vitamin B6,
DHA, and EPA were measured, and repeated at the
end of the trial period. APOE allele status, depressive
symptomswiththegeriatricdepressionscale,andother
risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease were also assessed
[10].
Cognitive testing
Cognitive tests were administered at baseline and
at the 2-year end-point as secondary trial outcomes.
 A. Oulhaj et al. / Omega-3 and B Vitamin Interactions on Cognition
549
Some cognitive tests were conducted at more than two
time-points during the trial to allow for longitudinal
analyses. These included the Hopkins verbal learn-
ing test (for verbal episodic memory) with delayed
recall (HVLT-DR) using six different versions of the
wordlists [29] to minimize a learning effect, and
the telephone inventory for cognitive status-modified
(TICS-M) [30], which assesses general cognition. The
HVLT-DR was conducted face-to-face at baseline and
two-year endpoint, but by telephone at 3, 6, 12, and
18 month time points. The TICS-M was assessed at
baseline, 15, and 27 months; the latter test was done
three months after the treatment ceased. The CDR [31]
was administered as a clinical and functional measure
to both the participant and informant at baseline and
two-year follow-up. See supplement in de Jager et al.
[12] for detailed descriptions of the tests and scoring.
Biochemical assays
Plasma total DHA and EPA were quantified by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (Focus GC-DSQ
II GC-MS system, Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hemp-
stead, UK) as described [27]. The method measures the
combined pool of DHA and EPA in plasma, including
the free fractions, and those esterified into phospho-
lipids, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters. In short,
30 �L non-fasting plasma was transmethylated using
methanolic-HCl(3 N)at95◦Cfor2 h.Fattyacidmethyl
esters were extracted with hexane, and separated on a
BPX70 column (25 m × 0.22 mm, 25 �m film, SGE,
Weiterstadt, Germany). DHA and EPA were quantified
by comparison with calibrations curves, corrected for
the presence of internal standard, and absolute concen-
trations were expressed in �mol/L. APOE genotype,
plasma tHcy, folate, and vitamin B12 were assayed as
previously described [32].
Statistical methods
The main objective in this study is to show how the
baseline concentration of omega-3 fatty acids modifies
the effect of B vitamin treatment on cognitive function.
The baseline concentrations of combined long-chain
omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA), of DHA alone
and of EPA alone were divided into tertiles for the
placebo group and for the B vitamin group separately.
The concentration split-points and numbers in each
subgroup are shown in Supplementary Table 4. Inter-
action terms were tested using the likelihood ratio test
and were considered significant if their correspond-
ing p values were <0.1. In addition to quantitative
interactions, we also statistically investigated for the
presence of cross-over interactions. This type of inter-
action occurs when one treatment is superior for some
subgroup(s) of patients and the alternative treatment is
superiorforanothersubgroup(s).Pleaserefertothefol-
lowing papers for examples of cross-over interactions
[33, 34].
For each of the cognitive scores, the last follow up
measure (24 months or, for TICS-M, 27 months) was
statistically modeled as a function of B-vitamin treat-
ment code, baseline omega-3 level (in tertiles) and an
interaction term between both. The model adjusted for
baseline cognitive score, age, gender, APOE4 status,
education, and baseline tHcy. A multiple linear regres-
sion model was used for HVLT-DR, TICS-M, and
CDR-sum-of-boxes (CDRsob). The CDR overall score
was dichotomized into CDR = 0 (normal) or CDR >0
(equivalent to MCI and mild Alzheimer’s disease) and
then used in multiple logistic regression. Longitudinal
changes in HVLT-DR, with the six repeated measures
(using alternate versions) from baseline through to
last follow-up, were analyzed by a linear mixed effect
(LME) model. The LME model included main effects
of treatment, time, and combined omega-3 levels and
two and three-way interactions between these factors.
A random intercept and a random slope were included
in the LME model. We compared the distribution,
across tertiles of omega-3, of demographic and clinical
variables at baseline to identify potential confounders
that might distort the modifying effect of omega-3 on
B vitamin treatment. We dealt with the issue of con-
founding by using adjusted analysis in the multiple
linear regression models [35].
No adjustment procedure for multiplicity was used
when testing for multiple hypothesis testing. All anal-
yses were performed using ‘R’ software version 3.0.3.
RESULTS
Demographics
The B vitamin treated and placebo groups showed
no differences in most demographic variables at
baseline, including age, gender ratio, total years of
education, APOE4 allele status, smoking, blood pres-
sure, BMI, creatinine, tHcy, folate and vitamin B12
concentrations, DHA, EPA and combined omega-
3 concentrations, MMSE, HVLT-DR, TICS-M, and
CDR scores. The treated group had lower baseline
geriatric depression scores than the placebo group
(Table 1). Self-reported use of B vitamin supplements
and fish oils did not differ between the groups.

Subjects in the different tertiles of omega-3 showed
no differences in most demographic variables at base-
line, including age, total years of education, smoking,
blood pressure, BMI, and vitamin B12 concentra-
tions (Supplementary Table 1). The highest tertiles of
omega-3 were more likely to have a higher proportion
of men, lower levels of tHcy, higher levels of folate,
and lower levels of creatinine.
Linear regression analyses of final cognitive test
performance
Episodic memory (HVLT-DR) at last follow-up
The scores for HVLT-DR at the last follow-up
(24 months) increased in the B vitamin treated
group across increasing tertiles of combined omega-3
fatty acids, whereas the scores in the placebo group
showed negligible change (Fig. 1). The likelihood
ratio test showed a significant interaction between
Fig. 1. Episodic memory score after 2 years according to baseline
omega-3 fatty acid concentration. The interaction between omega-3
tertiles and B vitamin treatment was significant (p = 0.028). In the
third tertile of the combined omega-3 fatty acid concentration, the
memory score in the B vitamin group was higher than in placebo
(p = 0.047). In the B vitamin group, memory score in the 3rd tertile
of omega-3 was higher than in the 1st tertile (p = 0.01). See Table 2.

B-vitamin treatment and plasma combined omega-3
fatty acids (pinteraction = 0.028) (Table 2). This finding
is mainly due to the 2.08 point difference between
scores (p = 0.010) in the 1st and 3rd tertile of com-
bined omega-3 fatty acids. The HVLT-DR score was
also significantly higher (p = 0.047) in the B vitamin
group compared with the placebo group for those
with combined omega-3 fatty acids in the 3rd ter-
tile (>579 �mol/L), while at lower omega-3 levels
there was no significant difference in performance
by treatment code. When HVLT-DR was assessed in
relation to tertiles of baseline plasma concentrations
of DHA and of EPA separately, similar results were
obtained and were particularly significant for DHA
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 2
and 3). Thus, for DHA the interaction was significant
at p = 0.003; in the 3rd tertile the average HVLT-DR
score was 1.7 points higher in the B vitamin treated
group compared with placebo group (p = 0.002). A
marked concentration-dependent effect of DHA was
found in the B vitamin treated group: in the 3rd tertile
the average HVLT-DR score was 1.96 points higher
than in the 2nd tertile (p = 0.015) and 2.53 points
higherthaninthe1sttertile(p = 0.001)(Supplementary
Table 2).
Global cognition (TICS-M) at last follow-up
TheTICS-Mscoresatthelastfollow-up(27months)
increased in the B vitamin treated group across increas-
ing tertiles of combined omega-3 fatty acids, whereas
the scores in the placebo group were not affected
(Fig. 2). The likelihood ratio test showed a significant
interaction between B vitamin treatment and combined
omega-3 fatty acids (pinteraction = 0.09). There was also
a significant difference in the treatment effects between
the 3rd and the 1st tertile of combined omega-3 fatty
acids (difference = 2.85 points, p = 0.035) with higher
scores for those in the 3rd tertile (Fig. 2 and Supple-
mentary Table 1).
When TICS-M was assessed in relation to tertiles
of baseline plasma concentrations of DHA and EPA
separately, only higher concentrations of DHA signif-
icantly enhanced the cognitive effects of B vitamins,
pinteraction = 0.098 (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supple-
mentary Tables 2 and 3). In the 3rd DHA tertile, there
was a significant effect of B vitamin treatment on
TICS-M (p = 0.041) and in the B vitamin treatment
group there was a concentration-dependent effect of
DHA with a 2.78 point higher TICS-M score in the
3rd tertile compared with the 1st tertile (p = 0.039)
(Supplementary Table 2).

1Defined as the average score in treated minus the average score in placebo for HVLT-DR, TICS-M and CDRsob. For CDR it is the OR ratio for
a worse outcome comparing treated to placebo. The crude estimate uses the raw data without any statistical modeling. The adjusted treatment
effect was obtained by using statistical modeling and adjusting for baseline cognitive score, age, gender, APOE4 status, education, and baseline
tHcy. 2This is the p-value for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect within a fixed tertile. This applies to adjusted analysis only.
3Overall interaction tests the null hypothesis that treatment effects in 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles are all the same. 4This is the p-value for testing
the null hypothesis of no overall interaction. 5p1st vs 2nd is the p-value for testing the null hypothesis that treatment effects in 1st and 2rd tertiles

The proportion of participants who had a CDR over-
all score of >0 (worse outcome) at the 24 month
follow-up is shown in Fig. 3A. In the 3rd tertile of
baseline combined omega-3 fatty acids only 33% of
those on B vitamin treatment had CDR scores >0 com-
pared with 59% in the placebo group. Also, in the 3rd
tertile, B vitamins markedly reduced the risk of hav-
ing CDR scores >0 (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10,
0.95; p = 0.043) (Table 2). There was a trend for a

fatty acids: the proportion scoring >0 in the B vitamin
group declined from 70% to 33% from the 1st tertile
to the 3rd tertile (p = 0.053).
Significant interaction effects were also found for
DHA (pinteraction = 0.097), with an adjusted odds ratio
of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08, 0.81) for a worse CDR, com-
paring B vitamin treated versus placebo in the 3rd
tertile of DHA (p = 0.022) (Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 3A). There was a concentration-
dependent effect of DHA in the B vitamin group with
a greater improvement in the 3rd than in the 1st ter-
tile (p = 0.034) (Supplementary Table 2). The effects
of EPA on the CDR showed similar patterns but did
not reach significance (Supplementary Table 3 and

there was a significant difference in the average

effect of B-vitamin treatment depended on the base-
line plasma concentration of combined omega-3 fatty
acids and DHA alone (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 6A,
Supplementary Table 6). The likelihood ratio test for
interaction between B vitamin treatment and com-
bined omega-3 was significant at an alpha level 10%
(p = 0.086) and also for interaction between B vita-
min treatment and DHA (p = 0.025), but did not reach
significance for EPA (Supplementary Table 6). The
modifying effect of omega-3 was mainly characterized
by different slopes in placebo and B vitamin group in
the 3rd tertile compared to the 1st tertile. For example,
in the 3rd tertile of combined omega-3, the average
HVLT-DR significantly increased in the B vitamin
group by 0.46 points per year of follow-up (p = 0.013)
compared to no significant change in the placebo group
(p = 0.91). However, in the 1st tertile, there were no
significant changes in HVLT-DR in either placebo
(p = 0.36) or B-vitamin groups (p = 0.44). The same
pattern occurred for the third tertile of DHA (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5A) with an increase in HVLT-DR
score of 0.46 points per year in the B vitamin group
(p = 0.009), but no significant change in the placebo
group (Supplementary Table 6). The pattern for EPA
was similar to that for DHA (Supplementary Fig. 5B)
but did not reach significance (Supplementary Table 6).
Testing for qualitative or cross-over interactions
We observed a consistent trend for subjects in the
lowest tertile of omega-3: B-vitamin treatment, com-
pared with placebo, appeared to be associated with
lower cognitive scores. However, there is no evidence
for any cross-over interactions as shown in Supple-
mentary Table 5. This means that treatment effects are
not in opposite directions across tertiles of omega-3.
Although this observation was not significant on anal-
ysis of cross-over interactions, it will be important to
examine this possibility in other observational stud-
ies and clinical trials. Residual confounding cannot be
excluded.
DISCUSSION
This study revealed significant beneficial effects of
higher baseline omega-3 fatty acid concentrations on
certain cognitive and clinical outcomes of B vitamin
treatment in older persons with MCI, both cross-
sectionally at the study end, and longitudinally for
episodic memory, over the 2-year intervention period.
The cross-sectional regression analyses for all cog-
nitive and clinical outcomes tested showed similar
patterns. For participants with high baseline levels
of omega-3 fatty acids, the B vitamin treated group
performed better than placebo, while those with low
baseline omega-3 fatty acids did not benefit from B
vitamin supplementation. In general, the effects were
 554
A. Oulhaj et al. / Omega-3 and B Vitamin Interactions on Cognition
more significant for DHA alone than for EPA or com-
bined omega-3 fatty acids, especially for the HVLT-DR
and TICS-M. However, due to the small number of
participants and a considerable co-variation between
DHA and EPA, the present data set is not ideal for sep-
arating effects between the two fatty acids. Overall,
DHA and EPA showed similar patterns on all cog-
nitive outcomes (see Supplementary Figures). These
results should be used for hypothesis generation and
optimization of future trials.
As mentioned in the Introduction, trials of both
omega-3 fatty acids and, separately, of B vitamins
have given conflicting results regarding cognitive
outcomes. Nevertheless, some previous studies have
shown benefits of omega-3 fatty acid treatment alone
on various types of memory [14, 19], attention and
processing speed [21], as well as global cognition [17],
while trials with B vitamins have shown benefits on
episodic memory, verbal fluency, and global cognition
in people with high baseline tHcy [9, 12]. We find
here that this beneficial effect of B vitamin treatment
on cognition only clearly occurs in those with a
good omega-3 fatty acid status. A similar interaction
between omega-3 fatty acid status and B vitamin
treatment was found in VITACOG for the slowing of
brain atrophy rate [27]. Our previous findings revealed
that cognitive scores including the HVLT-DR and
TICS-M decline more rapidly in those with the most
brain atrophy [36]. We discuss below the likely causal
links between cognitive scores and regional brain
atrophy.
On the whole, trials on the efficacy of B vitamin sup-
plementation for cognitive impairment have produced
variable and sometimes negative results (see Introduc-
tion). Our results lead us to suggest that the variable
outcomes might in part be related to different omega-3
fatty acid status in the trial participants, either due to
diet or supplement intake. If intake is not monitored at
baseline and controlled for in the randomization of par-
ticipants to treatment, omega-3 status may confound
the results. Future trials of B vitamin treatment should
accordingly control for omega-3 fatty acid status. The
different cognitive outcomes used may also account for
variable outcomes in clinical trials. Manders et al. [24]
found that general cognitive tests such as the MMSE
often did not show effects for nutrients. But positive
results were obtained when domain-specific tests were
used,especiallyforfluidratherthancrystallizedability,
such as information processing. We found significant
results for the episodic memory domain (HVLT-DR)
and for general cognition with the TICS-M. However,
the TICS-M contains more memory items than the
MMSEandisamoresensitivetestforcognitivedecline
[30].
There has been one randomized trial with a com-
bination of B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids in
which cognition was assessed [37]. This was a sec-
ondary prevention trial in patients with cardiovascular
disease, but only one cognitive assessment was done,
at the end of the trial, and so it was not possible to
studytheeffectofthetreatmentuponcognitivedecline.
Overall, no significant treatment effects were found
on the final cognitive test scores, apart from a higher
score in temporal orientation in those with a history of
ischemic stroke and a lower score in semantic mem-
ory in those with a history of heart disease. This trial
was not designed to study cognitive decline, and used
doses of nutrients at dietary levels rather than pharma-
cological levels; it is thus not suitable for answering
the question of whether omega-3 fatty acids enhance
the slowing effect of B vitamins on cognitive decline.
A randomized trial should now be performed with
high dose combinations of these supplements in peo-
ple who will experience cognitive decline during the
trial period, such as those with MCI.
The findings from VITACOG, here on cognition
and earlier on brain atrophy [27], are evidence of an
interaction between two different classes of nutrients,
B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, in people with
MCI. Possible mechanisms for this interaction have
been discussed in our earlier report [27] and include
the hypothesis that B vitamins facilitate the forma-
tion of phosphatidylcholine (PC) enriched in omega-3
fatty acids from phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. 5)
and hence the transport of omega-3 fatty acids into
the brain [26, 38]. PC synthesized by this B vitamin-

dependent pathway has been shown to contain higher
levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including omega-
3, compared with the alternative CDP-choline pathway
[39, 40]. Selley [26] found that the raised plasma S-
adenosylhomocysteine in patients with Alzheimer’s
disease was associated with decreased erythrocyte
concentrations of PC and with increased concen-
trations of phosphatidylethanolamine; he therefore
suggested that raised homocysteine inhibits phos-
phatidylethanolamine methyltransferase. Selley [26]
also found that the PC in Alzheimer’s disease erythro-
cytes was relatively depleted in DHA. It is noteworthy
that decreased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids
in PC occur in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease [38].
Also, low levels of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and
EPA) in plasma PC are a risk factor for dementia [41]
and have been found in plasma PC in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease [42]. Animal experiments are con-
sistent with the above hypothesis: rats made deficient
in folate had impaired spatial memory performance
and showed a halving in brain PC concentration and
an increase in brain phosphatidylethanolamine [43].
Notably, the memory deficit and the decline in brain
PC were both reversed by treatment of the rats with
methionine. It remains to be shown whether the deple-
tion of brain PC in folate deficiency is associated with
a loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
The striking agreement between the results on the
rate of brain atrophy and on cognitive decline in
VITACOG raises the question of whether the two
outcomes are causally linked. We have previously
addressed this question by mediation analysis [11].
We found associations between cognitive decline and
loss of gray matter in specific brain regions. Worsen-
ing of CDRsob and MMSE scores was associated with
gray matter loss, most pronounced bilaterally in the
amygdalo-hippocampal complex and entorhinal cor-
tex. Decreases in HVLT-delayed recall and category
fluency scores were associated with increased gray
matter loss in the left hippocampus and entorhinal cor-
tex. These gray matter regions involved in cognitive
decline also showed a marked reduction of atrophy
with B-vitamin treatment in subjects with high tHcy
levels. We found that the optimal Bayesian network
model explaining our data indicated the following
causal chain of events: B vitamin treatment (mainly
vitamin B12) caused a fall in tHcy levels, which
reduced the rate of gray matter atrophy, which, in turn,
delayed cognitive decline (HVLT-DR, category flu-
ency, CDRsob) [11]. It would be of interest to see what
the effect would be of the inclusion of omega-3 fatty
acid status in these analyses.
A limitation of our study is that omega-3 fatty acids
were not supplemented during the trial, so the find-
ings only relate to baseline levels. Another limitation,
which may account for the variability between sub-
groups, was the small number of participants in some
of the subgroups. The small numbers also prevented us
from looking for modifying factors, such as the pos-
sible interaction between the effects of omega-3 fatty
acids and APOE4 status [44].
In conclusion, when plasma omega-3 fatty acid con-
centrations are low, B vitamin treatment does not slow
cognitivedeclineinpeoplewithMCI.Incontrast,when
omega-3 fatty acid levels are in the upper range of nor-
mal, the slowing effects of B vitamins on both brain
atrophy [27] and cognitive decline are enhanced. We
suggest that the effects of this interaction between the
two nutrients on brain atrophy and cognition is con-
sistent with the view that they slow down the disease
process in MCI. These results may have public health
implications. It will be important to test in a clinical
trial whether the administration of these two nutrients
will delay the conversion from MCI to dementia.
