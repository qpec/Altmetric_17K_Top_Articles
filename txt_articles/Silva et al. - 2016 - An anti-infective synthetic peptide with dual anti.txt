Antibiotic-resistant infections are predicted to kill 10 million people per year by 2050, costing the 
global economy $100 trillion. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative technologies. We 
have engineered a synthetic peptide called clavanin-MO, derived from a marine tunicate antimicrobial 
peptide, which exhibits potent antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. 
The peptide effectively killed a panel of representative bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant 
hospital isolates. Antimicrobial activity of the peptide was demonstrated in animal models, reducing 
bacterial counts by six orders of magnitude, and contributing to infection clearance. In addition, 
clavanin-MO was capable of modulating innate immunity by stimulating leukocyte recruitment to the 
site of infection, and production of immune mediators GM-CSF, IFN-γ and MCP-1, while suppressing an 
excessive and potentially harmful inflammatory response by increasing synthesis of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-10 and repressing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-α. 
Finally, treatment with the peptide protected mice against otherwise lethal infections caused by both 
Gram-negative and -positive drug-resistant strains. The peptide presented here directly kills bacteria 
and further helps resolve infections through its immune modulatory properties. Peptide anti-infective 
therapeutics with combined antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties represent a new 
approach to treat antibiotic-resistant infections.
Antibiotics are often considered the most successful intervention in modern human medicine. However, their 
efficacy has been hampered by the rise of drug-resistant bacteria1. In addition, despite the marked increase in 
efforts to find new drugs, no new antibiotics have been licensed for clinical use in recent years1. The urgent need 
to develop novel antimicrobial therapeutics has recently been emphasized by the estimation that by the year

2050, 10 million people will die annually worldwide as a direct result of antimicrobial resistance2. Antimicrobial 
peptides (AMPs) represent a potential alternative to available antibiotics3,4. These peptides are evolutionarily 
conserved molecules that serve in host defence against microbial infections. Present in all living organisms, 
these peptides generally range in size from 12 to 50 amino acids and are cationic due to the presence of lysine 
and arginine residues5. Moreover, about 50% of the amino acids in AMPs are hydrophobic and they can adopt 
amphipathic structures, which enables them to interact with and penetrate cell membranes3,5. Naturally occurring 
peptides as well as synthetic derivatives have been shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial, anti-biofilm and immu-
nomodulatory properties6–8. The multifunctional nature of these peptides makes them attractive for therapeutic 
use, as targeting multiple cellular pathways in living bacteria is known to reduce the selective pressure for the 
development of resistance.
Clavanin A (VFQFLGKIIHHVGNFVHGFSHVF-NH2) is a naturally occurring AMP that was first isolated in 
1997 from the hemocytes of the marine tunicate Styela clava9,10. In addition to its cationic and amphipathic char-
acteristics, this peptide possesses an amino acid sequence rich in histidine, phenylalanine and glycine residues. 
Clavanin A has been shown to be broadly effective in vitro and in vivo against Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
bacteria as well as fungi. This peptide also has the advantageous property over other AMPs of being active even at 
high salt concentrations and in acidic pH10–14.
Here, we first confirmed the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of clavanin A and next found that clava-
nin A also exhibited immunomodulatory properties12. We decided to engineer clavanin A in order to improve 
its antimicrobial and immune modulation capabilities. For this, first we computationally searched for a con-
served region in AMPs that was predicted to exhibit both antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities. We 
found a hit in the conserved oligopeptide FLPII, which was found to be present in a large number of peptides 
with immunomodulatory activity. Interestingly, this hydrophobic region is conserved in plant lipocalins, a fam-
ily of proteins that are known to interact with different types of membranes and organelles through this short 
hydrophobic oligopeptide domain. We next incorporated the hydrophobic region composed of five non-polar 
amino acid residues FLPII to the N-terminal end of clavanin A, and called the new molecule clavanin-MO 
(FLPIIVFQFLGKIIHHVGNFVHGFSHVF-NH2). In minimal inhibitory concentration and flow cell micro-
fluidic assays this novel synthetic peptide generally exhibited increased antimicrobial activity compared to its 
wild-type predecessor peptide, presented a range of immune modulatory activities both in vitro and in vivo, and 
conferred protection against lethal infections caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive drug-resistant patho-
gens in animal models. Additionally, the peptide lacked cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo against erythrocytes, 
monocytes and fibroblasts. The peptide therapy described here represents a new and innovative approach to treat 
infectious diseases through its combined antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties.
Results
Antibacterial activity profile of peptides. 
In the present study, a hydrophobic amino acid oligopeptide 
tag FLPII was added to the N-terminus of the natural AMP clavanin A to generate a modified clavanin sequence 
called clavanin-MO with increased overall hydrophobicity (Table S1). The antibacterial activity profiles of clava-
nin A and clavanin-MO are shown in Table 1. Both clavanin A and clavanin-MO were active against all bacterial 
strains tested, with MIC values ranging from 1.5 to 45 μ 
M (Table 1). Interestingly, in all cases, clavanin-MO 
showed improved antimicrobial activity (MICs 2-to-5 fold lower) compared to clavanin A. It was observed that 
 
S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. coli ATCC 8739 were the least susceptible to the action of clavanin-MO (MICs of 24 
and 12 μ 
M, respectively) while B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and E. faecalis ATCC 12953 were the most susceptible (MIC 
of 1.5 μ 
M) (Table 1). In addition, the antibacterial activity of clavanin-MO was superior to that of the human 
cathelicidin AMP LL-37 against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Importantly, clavanin-MO was 
more effective at killing antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative strains, such as KPC positive strains of E. coli and 
K. pneumoniae or multidrug resistant E. coli 2101123, compared to the commonly used antibiotics gentamicin 
(an aminoglycoside) and imipenem (a β 
-lactam) (Table 1). Finally, clavanin-MO displayed antibacterial activity 
against methicillin-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates thus highlighting the potential of this synthetic peptide to 
overcome antibiotic resistance.
In parallel studies, we tested the ability of the peptides to eradicate surface-associated biofilms, which are bac-
terial aggregates that are up to 1000-fold more resistant to antibiotics compared to their planktonic counterparts 
and are associated with two-thirds of all infections in humans6. To assess the anti-biofilm eradication activity of 
clavanin-MO, we first performed microtiter static biofilm assays and observed increased anti-biofilm activity for 
clavanin-MO cf. clavanin-A (data not shown). To confirm the biofilm inhibitory potential of clavanin-MO in 
using a more sophisticated biofilm model, we performed microfluidic flow cell assays as previously described6,15. 
Biofilms formed by antibiotic-resistant strains K. pneumoniae KPC971 and S. aureus MRSA were grown for 2 
days, after which they were treated with peptides for 24 hours. At a peptide concentration of 16 μ 
g.ml−1 (~5 μ 
M), 
clavanin-MO did not fully eradicate either biofilm (Fig. S1), however it did decrease the overall biofilm biomass of 
drug-resistant strain K. pneumoniae KPC971 while S. aureus MRSA biofilms were relatively unaffected (Fig. S1). 
 
Since previous reports identified the stress response nucleotide ppGpp-mediated pathway as a target for some 
synthetic peptides with anti-biofilm activity6,16, we asked whether clavanin A or clavanin-MO were affecting this 
cellular pathway. In this context, we performed thin layer chromatography assays of nucleotides extracted from 
intact P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. aureus HG001 bacteria in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations 
of peptide (Fig. S2). As expected, the peptides did not reduce ppGpp levels in either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or S. 
aureus HG001 (Fig. S2), even when tested to peptide concentrations as high as 64 μ 
g.mL−1.
Structural characterization studies. 
Next, we investigated the behaviour of both clavanin A and its syn-
thetic variant clavanin-MO in a DOPC bilayer by means of molecular dynamics (Fig. S3). Since it is known 
that clavanin A adopts an α 
-helical conformation in DOPC bilayers17, we reasoned that such simulations would

provide insights into any potential conformational differences between clavanin A and clavanin-MO. The evo-
lution of the backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) during the simulation indicated that the struc-
tures were maintained, since the RMSD were above 4 Å (Fig. S1B). Clavanin-MO showed more fluctuations in 
RMSD than clavanin A, however both peptides behaved similarly in the DOPC bilayers, whereby after 100 ns 
the structures suffered an inclination relative to the Z axis, reflecting their being more embedded in the mem-
brane (Fig. S1A). From the results obtained in these studies, we conclude that the addition of the five residues 
FLPII enhanced the affinity of clavanin-MO towards the hydrophobic core of membranes. Overall, both peptides 
behaved similarly in contact with membranes thus indicating that the increased antimicrobial activity displayed 
by (Table 1) is not due to its direct interaction with membranes.
In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies. 
Next, we determined the cytotoxic effects of peptides clavanin A and 
clavanin-MO on mouse red blood cells (mRBCs), RAW264.7 macrophage, L929 mouse fibroblast cell lines and 
human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK-293). Cell viability, through detection of cellular oxidative metabolism, 
was measured using the MTT assay after 24 hours of treatment with different peptide concentrations. Similar to 
previous studies, clavanin A showed no haemolytic activity and no significant cytotoxic effects on cells in cul-
ture9,12 (Fig. 1). Addition of the oligopeptide tag did not result in increased toxicity, as clavanin-MO exhibited 
similar levels of low toxicity as its parent peptide (Fig. 1A) and did not cause cytotoxicity towards RAW264.7, 
L929 cells and HEK-293 cells at the concentrations required for antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity 
(Fig. 1B–D, respectively). Consistent with these in vitro results, neither clavanin A nor clavanin-MO caused any 
apparent toxicity in mice treated intraperitoneally with a dose as high as 50 mg.kg−1 of peptide (data not shown), 
five times the maximum utilized here for successful anti-infective therapy.
In vitro immunomodulatory properties. 
Certain cationic peptides are capable of modulating the innate 
immune response due to their ability to stimulate the induction of chemokines while suppressing potentially 
harmful pro-inflammatory cytokines16,18–20. Here, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of peptides clava-
nin A and clavanin-MO on murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with 10 ng.ml−1 LPS (Fig. 2A–C) 
and compared them to the anti-endotoxin effect of the human cathelicidin peptide LL-37. RAW 264.7 cells stim-
ulated with LPS alone produced low levels of IL-10 while strongly inducing IL-12 and TNF-α 
 levels. In the pres-
ence of peptides, there was a significant increase in IL-10 production, particularly in groups treated with clavanin 
A and clavanin-MO compared to groups exposed to LL-37 (Fig. 2A). All three peptides caused a significant and 
almost complete reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-α 
 in LPS-stimulated cells 
(Fig. 2B,C, respectively).
In vivo peptide-mediated immune modulation. 
Peptides are chemotactic for leukocytes in mice. An 
important immunomodulatory activity exerted by some peptides is their ability to stimulate the migration of 
leukocytes to the site of an infection, as this is a key step into resolving infections 20–22. Therefore, we examined 
whether clavanin A and clavanin-MO were capable of inducing the migration of leukocytes to the infection focus 
and if these peptides could promote leukocyte recruitment into the intraperitoneal cavity of healthy mice and 
mice infected with either E. coli ATCC 8739 or S. aureus ATCC 29213. As seen in Fig. 2D, there was a substantial 
and significant peptide-induced increase in the number of leukocytes in the peritoneal fluid of healthy animals, 
similar to leukocyte migration induced by positive controls groups treated with thioglycolate (TGA). In mice 
not treated with peptide and infected with E. coli ATCC 8739 (Fig. 2E) and S. aureus ATCC 29213 (Fig. 2F) there 
was a large increase in leukocyte counts in the peritoneal cavity 24 hours post infection, likely reflecting the

establishment of the infection in mice. In peptide treated groups, the peak of leukocyte migration was observed 
much earlier, only 3 h post-infection in both healthy and infected mice (Fig. 2D–F). Interestingly, leukocyte num-
bers were significantly reduced in peptide treated mice 24 hours post-infection, similar to levels seen in mice 
treated with the β 
-lactam antibiotic imipenem (Fig. 2E,F). This can be attributed to the resolution of the bacterial 
infection in mice treated with peptides clavanin A and clavanin-MO, consistent with our bacterial cell count 
results (Fig. 2I–L).
Peptides modulate innate immunity in mice. We then tested the ability of the peptides to modulate the immune 
response in mice. In an early infection phase (i.e., 3 hours post-infection), both clavanin A and clavanin-MO 
significantly triggered the release of cytokines GM-CSF, IFN-γ 
 and MCP-1 in mice infected with both E. coli and 
S. aureus (Fig. 2G,H).
Efficacy of peptides in bacterial infection models. 
Synthetic peptide clavanin-MO provided 
broad-spectrum protection against lethal infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens in mice. Due to the 
potent and very promising antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of clavanin-MO, we decided to test 
its anti-infective potential. We established a mouse model of aggressive bacterial infection similar to previously 
described12,13. Mice were infected with one of the following bacteria via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection: E. coli 
ATCC 8739, E. coli KPC-positive ID N°. 1812446, S. aureus ATCC 29213 or S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591 and 
3 hours later treated i.p. with 10 mg.kg−1 of peptide or antibiotic suspended in sterile saline. As shown in Fig. 3, 
both clavanin A and clavanin-MO prolonged the survival of infected mice. After 8 days of infection, 80% survival 
was observed for animals infected with wild-type E. coli ATCC 8739 (Fig. 3A) or S. aureus ATCC 29213 (Fig. 3C) 
and treated with 10 mg.kg−1 of clavanin A. The same survival rate was seen for mice infected with E. coli ATCC 
8739 (Fig. 3E), E. coli KPC-positive (Fig. 3F) or S. aureus ATCC 29213 (Fig. 3G) and treated with 10 mg.kg−1 of 
clavanin-MO. Mice infected with MRSA and treated with clavanin-MO showed 60% survival (Fig. 3H), a 20% 
increase in survival rate compared to animals treated with its parent peptide clavanin A (Fig. 3D). Twenty-four 
hours post-infection, peritoneal fluid was collected and bacterial colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were per-
formed. These assays showed a significant decrease in the number of viable bacterial counts in peptide-treated 
groups (Fig. 3I–L), thus suggesting that the highly protective activity of clavanin A and clavanin MO was due to 
their bacterial killing activity. In mice infected with drug-resistant E. coli (Fig. 3J) peptide treatment led to ~4 
orders of magnitude greater bacterial killing compared to the conventional β 
-lactam antibiotic imipenem.
Overall, peptide treatment led to an effective reduction in both bacterial load and infection-associated 
mortality.
Discussion
We have identified a novel synthetic peptide, clavanin-MO, which can directly kill bacteria and simultaneously 
modulate innate immune responses, thereby providing effective treatment of a broad spectrum of infections,

while controlling an excessive inflammatory response that could lead to sepsis. This is in contrast with most 
conventional antibiotics, which actually stimulate the release of bacterial pathogen-associated signature molecule 
components and can contribute to the risk of damaging inflammation and sepsis23.
Clavanin-MO was generated by adding a hydrophobic oligopeptide sequence FLPII to the N-terminus of 
the parent peptide clavanin A. This hydrophobic region is conserved in plant lipocalins, which are a family of 
proteins that are known to interact with different types of membranes and organelles through this short hydro-
phobic domain (FLPII)24–26. Based on our results, we propose that this hydrophobic sequence could be enhancing 
the affinity of clavanin-MO towards bacterial membranes, resulting in improved antimicrobial activity. In our 
studies, we did not find substantial differences in the interactions of the peptides with membranes (Fig. S1), 
therefore indicating that clavanin-MO may kill bacteria through other mechanisms. Generally, it is known that 
increasing the hydrophobicity of peptides tends to increase their toxicity27–29. However, here we have shown that 
clavanin-MO, despite its increased hydrophobicity, was not toxic in vitro or in vivo.
In addition, the peptides influenced the inflammatory response of RAW 264.7 cells through the production 
of anti-inflammatory mediators such as cytokine IL-10 and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 
TNF-α 
 and they significantly stimulated the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection in vivo. The abil-
ity of the peptides to skew host responses to favour cellular recruitment whilst controlling excessive harmful

inflammation makes these peptides ideal candidates for treating acute infections and disease conditions such 
as sepsis. Early stage sepsis is characterized by a hyper-inflammatory state, which results in impaired immune 
function and eventual immunosuppression30. Clavanin-MO could help to balance these delicate host responses 
to reduce the prolonged production of pro-inflammatory mediators but also enhance the activity and recruitment 
of leukocytes, which are important for baseline immune function. In this context, it is worth noting that other 
peptides have been shown to modulate the host immune response. For example, the human cathelicidin LL-37 is 
known to exert several immunomodulation activities, including recruitment of monocytes in vivo31,32. Other syn-
thetic peptides with immunomodulatory properties (e.g., IDR-HH2, IDR-1002, and IDR-1018) have been shown 
to induce neutrophil migration and chemokine production, and suppress the release of ROS and pro-inflammatory 
cytokine TNF-α 
22,30–33.
Importantly, treatment with both clavanin A and clavanin-MO protected mice from lethal infections caused 
by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Clavanin A was previously shown to promote survival of 
mice infected with E. coli ATCC 8739 and S. aureus ATCC 2921312,13. In the present study we further demon-
strated that clavanin-MO exhibited similar protective activity to clavanin A in infections caused by wild-type 
bacteria. However, clavanin-MO exhibited 20% increased survival cf. clavanin A in mice infected with multidrug 
resistant E. coli and MRSA. Furthermore, the peptides almost completely eradicated the infection after 24 h as 
revealed by CFU counts from bacteria present in the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 3I–L).

colistin, continues to increase. At the same time, there has been a decline in the number of antimicrobial thera-
pies under development or approved for human use. This has led to the estimate that by 2050, 10 million people 
will die per year as a result of antibiotic-resistant infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel, 
alternative approaches to treat infectious diseases. Here, we have identified a single peptide that acts by 1) directly 
killing bacterial pathogens and 2) targeting the host through stimulation of immune cells and suppression of 
potentially harmful inflammation that could lead to sepsis. In animal models, peptide treatment protected against 
lethal infections caused by drug-resistant E. coli and S. aureus clinical isolates, therefore proving the potential of 
this peptide therapy as a novel anti-infective to counter the rise of antibiotic resistance. However, further stud-
ies are needed to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the peptide. Additional strategies to 
increase the stability of the peptides and their overall therapeutic potential may include incorporation of D-amino 
acid residues into the peptide sequence.
Experimental Procedures
Peptides. 
Clavanin A, clavanin-MO and cathelicidin LL-37 (Table S1) were synthesized by Shanghai Hanhong 
Chemical (R.P. of China) using the solid-phase with the N-9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy and 
purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (GE, USA)10,34. The identity of each peptide was 
confirmed by MALDI ToF MS (Bruker, Germany). Peptide purity used in biologic assays was higher than 95%.
Strains and growth conditions. 
Strains used included clinical isolates Escherichia coli KPC-positive 
ID N°.181244635, Escherichia coli multiresistant ID N°.210112335 and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella 
pneumoniae 1825971 (KPC971), as well as reference strains Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Enterococcus faecalis 
ATCC 12953, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591, 
Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13885, Proteus 
mirabilis ATCC 25933, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and Salmonella enterica ATCC 14028. Bacteria 
were plated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar (Himedia, India) from a frozen stock. Following 24 h incuba-
tion, three isolated colonies were transferred to 1 mL of BHI broth. The broth culture was incubated overnight 
(12–16 h) at 37 °C with shaking36.
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Determination. 
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
of peptides and antibiotics was evaluated using the broth microdilution technique in BHI with an initial inoculum 
of 5 × 105 cells in non-treated polystyrene microtiter plates (Corning, USA) as described by Wiegand et al.37. The 
MICs were interpreted as the lowest concentration of peptide or antibiotic that completely inhibited the visible 
growth of bacteria after 12 h of incubation at 37 °C. Each agent was tested in triplicate in at least three independent 
experiments12.
Antibiofilm assays. 
Experiments were performed as described previously6,15. Briefly, flow cell chambers 
(dimensions of 1 × 
 4 × 
 40 mm) were inoculated with bacteria by injecting 400 μ 
l of an overnight culture. After 
inoculation, the chambers were left without flow for 2 hours to enable initial bacterial adherence. Biofilms were 
grown in BM2 glucose minimal medium flowing through the cells at a constant rate of 2.4 ml/h for 48 hours 
at 37 °C. The matured biofilms were then exposed to clavanin-MO or media alone for an additional 24 hours. 
Biofilm cells were stained using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability kit (Molecular Probes, USA) prior 
to microscopy experiments. Microscopy was performed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, 
Fluoview FV1000, USA), and 3D reconstructions were generated using the Imaris software package (Bitplane 
AG).
Thin Layer Chromatography. 
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) assays were used to measure ppGpp lev-
els in biofilms as described previously6,15. Briefly, untreated or bacteria treated with the peptides were labelled 
with 10 μ 
Ci/ml 32P for 3 hours. Samples were then extracted with frozen 13 M formic acid by three cycles of 
freeze-thaw. Aliquots (7.5 μ 
l) of the supernatants were applied to 20 × 
 20 cm PEI cellulose TLC plates and resolved 
with 1.5 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) for 4 hours. After chromatography, nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography 
and quantified with MolecularImager FX PhosphorImager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, USA).
Cell cultures. 
Murine macrophage-like cells RAW 264.7 and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK-293) 
were purchased from the Rio de Janeiro Cell Bank and were maintained in supplemented Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, USA) (4 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM nonessen-
tial amino acids, 50 mg.mL−1, gentamicin, and 100 units.mL−1, penicillin/streptomycin) in the presence of 5% 
CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated by adding 0.1 ng/mL LPS (E. coli 0111:B4) (Sigma, USA) into the medium 
specified above. Peptides were added at a concentration of 2 μ 
M were 30 min after addition of LPS. After 6, 12, 
24 and 48 h of incubation, plates were centrifuged for 6 min at 400× 
  g and the supernatants were collected and 
kept frozen at − 
20 °C until used for analysis of IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-α 
 production by ELISA (see below for 
detailed experimental procedure)12,38.
Hemolysis assays. 
The hemolytic activity of clavanin A and clavanin-MO was evaluated against fresh mouse 
red blood cells (mRBCs) by measuring the peptide-induced change in the optical density (OD) at 540 nm (Victor 
X, Perkin-Elmer, Germany)39 of a mRBC cell suspension [a 20% (v/v) erythrocytes/phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS) suspension]. Maximum lysis (100%) was determined by analyzing the supernatant of erythrocytes that had 
been incubated with 1% Triton X-100 while PBS was used as a negative control12,39–41.
Cytotoxicity assays. 
Cellular cytotoxicity was measured by a colorimetric assay that makes use of thi-
azolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT: Sigma, USA). A sub-confluent monolayer culture of L929, RAW264.7

and Human Embryonic Kidney HEK-293 cells were collected by scraper in supplemented DMEM (Invitrogen, 
USA). Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per well, with different concen-
trations of peptide or antibiotic controls (1–600 μ 
M). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 
for 48 h. Following incubation, MTT was added to the cells (10 μ 
L at 5 mg.mL−1). The plate was incubated for 
4 hours in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Formazan crystals was dissolved by the addition of 100 μ 
L of 100% 
DMSO (Mallinckrodt Chemical, USA) per well. Plates were then gently swirled for 5 min at room temperature to 
dissolve the precipitate. Absorbance was monitored at 575 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Victor X, 
PerkinElmer, Germany)12,37,38. Maximum cytotoxicity (100%) was determined by cells incubated with 1% Triton 
X-100, PBS was used as a negative control.
Animal experiments. 
Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Central Bioterium of the USP/Ribeirão Preto) 
were used for all studies. Mice used in this study were housed in an animal facility at the Catholic University of 
Brasilia (UCB). Mice were provided standard food and water ad libitum.
Ethics Statement. 
The use of mice was conducted in accordance with the regulations set forward by the 
respective national animal protection committees and in accordance with European Community Directive 
86/609 and the U.S. Association for Laboratory Animal Care recommendations for the care and use of laboratory 
animals. All the techniques/procedures have been refined to provide for maximum comfort/minimal stress to the 
animals. Experiments performed have been approved by Animal Ethics Committees of the Catholic University of 
Brasilia (AECs/UCB), number 005/13.
In vivo toxicity assays. 
The in vivo toxicity of clavanin A and clavanin-MO were evaluated by intraperito-
neal (i.p.) injection of each peptide to groups of 10 C57BL/6 mice as described42. Each mouse was injected with a 
0.5-ml solution of freshly prepared peptide in PBS. Doses of peptide administered per mouse were 0, 10, 30, 50, 
70 and 90 mg.kg−1 of body weight. Animals were directly inspected for adverse effects after 6 hours, and mortality 
was monitored for 7 days thereafter12,42.
Murine systemic infection model. 
Based on preliminary experiments to determine an effective challenge 
bacterial inoculum [E. coli ATCC 8739 and E. coli KPC-positive ID N°.1812446 or S. aureus ATCC 29213 and S. 
aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591] that resulted in consistent systemic infection without rapidly killing the mice (data 
not shown), mid-log-phase bacteria were diluted to ~2 × 107 CFU/mouse in PBS for Gram-negative bacteria and 
~2 × 109 CFU/mouse in PBS for Gram-positive bacteria12,13,35. Mice were challenged by i.p. injection with 200 μ 
L 
of bacteria suspended in PBS. The day of challenge was designated as day 1 of the experiment. Three hours after 
bacterial injection, mice (n = 
 10) were treated by i.p. injection with 10 mg.kg−1 of peptides, gentamicin, imipenem 
or PBS for 8 days and treated every 24 hours12,43. For bacterial load evaluation, 5 mice/group were humanely killed 
24 h after bacterial administration. To measure bacterial colonization, peritoneal lavage was obtained by washing 
the cavity with 5 ml of sterile PBS. Samples of these washes were serially diluted and 100 μ 
l of each dilution was 
spread in duplicate on appropriate agar plates to count colonies44.
Isolation of leukocytes from the peritoneal cavity of mice. 
C57BL/6 mice were injected i.p. with 
10 mg.kg−1 of peptide suspended in sterile saline. Mice were euthanized, and peritoneal lavage was carried out at 
different times post-injection. Additionally, leukocyte counts present in the in peritoneal cavity of mice infected 
with E. coli ATCC 8739 or S. aureus ATCC 29213 were determined. Animals infected and treated with peptides 
were euthanized 3 and 24 hours after treatment, and peritoneal lavage was performed to count leukocytes cells 
in the peritoneal cavity45. Animals were sacrificed, and cells present in the peritoneal cavity were harvested by 
introducing 3.0 ml of PBS containing 1 mM EDTA. Total cell counts were performed with a cell counter (Coulter 
AC T series analyzer), and differential cell counts were conducted on cytocentrifuge slides (Cytospin 3; Thermo 
Shandon) stained by the May-Grünwald-Giemsa (Rosenfeld) method. The results are expressed as the number 
of cells per cavity46.
ELISA. 
Cultured cells or peritoneal lavage samples were centrifuged at 1000 × 
 g for 10 min to obtain cell-free 
samples and stored at − 
20 °C. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA using anti-mouse IL-10, IL-12p70 and 
TNF-α (Peprotech, USA). Cytokine levels were analysed according to the manufacturer’s instructions35.
Molecular modelling studies. 
Initially, the clavanin-MO sequence was submitted to QUARK ab initio  
modelling server47 in order to obtain a full folded clavanin-MO structure. Then, the ab initio structure was 
used together with the NMR structure of clavanin A14 as templates for construction of the final model of 
clavanin-MO. One hundred molecular models were constructed by comparative molecular modelling through 
MODELLER 9.1448. The models were constructed using the default methods of auto-model and environ classes 
from MODELLER. The final models were selected according to the discrete optimized protein energy score 
(DOPE score). This score assesses the energy of the models and indicates the best probable structures. The best 
models were evaluated through PROSA II49 and PROCHECK50. PROCHECK checks the stereo-chemical quality 
of a protein structure through the Ramachandran plot, where good quality models are expected to have more 
than 90% of amino acid residues in most favored and additional allowed regions, while PROSA II indicates the 
fold quality. Structure visualization was done in PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).
Molecular Dynamics. 
The three-dimensional structures of clavanin A and MO were placed into a DOPC 
(1,2-dioleolyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) membrane using the CHARMM-GUI server51. The principal axis of 
the peptide was aligned to Z-axis and then inserted in a rectangular bilayer of 50 Å1 (X and Y axis) using the inser-
tion method for system building. The system peptide-membrane was solvated with Single Point Charge water

model52. The analyses were performed using the GROMOS96 53a6 force field extended for Berger lipids52 and 
the computational package GROMACS 453. Chlorine ions were added in order to neutralize the system charge. 
The geometry of water molecules was constrained using the SETTLE algorithm54. All atom bond lengths were 
linked by using the LINCS algorithm55. Electrostatic corrections were made according to the Particle Mesh Ewald 
algorithm56, with a cut-off radius of 1.4 nm in order to minimize the computational time. The same cut-off radius 
was also used for van der Waals interactions. The list of neighbours of each atom was updated every 10 simulation 
steps of 2 fs. The system underwent an energy minimization using 50,000 steps of the steepest descent algorithm. 
After that, the system temperature was normalized to 310 K for 100 ps, using the velocity-rescaling thermostat 
(NVT ensemble). Then, the system pressure was normalized to 1 bar for 100 ps, using the Parrinello-Rahman 
barostat using semiisotropic pressure and the thermostat was changed to Nosé-Hoover one (NPT ensemble). 
The systems with minimized energy, balanced temperature and pressure were simulated for 100 ns by using the 
leap-frog algorithm57. The structures were saved every 2 ps of simulation.
Statistical analyses. 
Data are presented as mean ± SD of all samples. Statistical significance of fatality rates 
between different groups was analysed by Kaplan–Meier test. In vivo assays were analysed using the Fisher´s exact 
test. The other data were submitted to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni correction. 
Values of p < 
 0.05 were considered statistically significant. GraphPad Prism software v5.0 (GraphPad Software, 
USA) was used for all statistical analyses12.
