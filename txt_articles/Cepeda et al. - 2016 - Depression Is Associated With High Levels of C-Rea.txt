and Low Levels of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide:

and Nutrition Examination Surveys

ajor depressive disorder may be viewed as a 
psychoneuroimmunological disorder1 that includes not 
only the traditional monoamine deficiency2 but also a persistent 
low-grade inflammation.3 Subjects with major depressive disorder 
have increased levels of a variety of inflammatory markers compared 
with those subjects who are not depressed,3–5 and administration 
of cytokines has been shown to induce behavioral changes that are 
consistent with the symptoms of major depressive disorder.6
High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammatory 
disease, have been documented in subjects with depression.3 
However, this association of elevated levels of CRP with depression 
has been attenuated in some studies after controlling for body mass 
index and chronic medical conditions.3
Nitric oxide (NO), in addition to being an inflammatory mediator, 
is also a neurotransmitter at the neuron synapses.7 It modulates 
norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate and thus is 
speculated to play a role in the pathogenesis of depression.8 Nitric 
oxide is also currently seen as a marker of airway inflammation and 
can be measured during exhalation.9 Fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
(FeNO) may represent both constitutive and inducible NO.10,11 Small 
studies suggest that subjects with depressed mood have low levels 
of FeNO.10,12
As the measure of exhaled NO has been standardized for clinical 
use, we sought to assess the association of depression with CRP and 
FeNO levels in a large and representative sample of the US population 
to shed light on the premise that neuroimmunological dysfunction 
could be part of the major depressive disorder pathophysiology.
METHODS
We designed and conducted a cross-sectional analysis using 
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a research program that collects 
health information about the US population through interviews, 
medical examinations, and laboratory tests.13 NHANES has all 
the information needed for our analysis: participants respond to a 
validated depression screener questionnaire, provide blood samples 
to quantify CRP, and undergo a respiratory health examination that 
includes measurement of FeNO levels in the last 2 recent survey 
cycles, and the study findings are generalizable to the US population.
We included subjects ≥ 20 years old who participated in NHANES 
during the period 2007 to 2012, responded to the depression 
questions, and had CRP or at least 2 reproducible FeNO measures.
Depression was measured in NHANES with the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9-item depression screening 
ABSTRACT
Objective: Major depressive disorder may be due to 
psychoneuroimmunological dysfunction, as studies have 
documented increased levels of a variety of inflammatory 
mediators in depressed subjects. Nitric oxide (NO) is marker 
of inflammation, and fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) is a 
marker of airway inflammation. Plasma NO and FeNO levels 
have been shown to be lower in subjects with depression 
in small studies. We sought to assess the association of 
depression with C-reactive protein (CRP) and FeNO levels in 
a large and representative sample of the US population.
Methods: Population-based cross-sectional study using data 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES). NHANES collects health information about the 
US population through interviews, medical examinations, 
and laboratory tests. We included subjects ≥ 20 years old 
who participated in NHANES in 2007 to 2012, responded 
to the depression questions, and had CRP values or ≥ 2 
reproducible FeNO measures. Depression was measured 
using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). 
Subjects were classified as depressed if PHQ-9 scores were 
≥ 10. FeNO and CRP levels were log transformed. Unadjusted 
and adjusted regression analyses were conducted.
Results: A total of 14,276 subjects responded to the PHQ-9, 
and 7.73% had depressive symptoms. Of these subjects, 
10,036 had CRP values and 12,513 had FeNO measurements. 
Subjects with depressive symptoms had, after adjustment, 
CRP levels that were 31% higher (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 14% to 50%) and FeNO levels that were 10.7% lower 
(95% CI, −2.5% to −17.1%) than in subjects with no 
depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: Depression is associated with high CRP levels 
and low FeNO levels. Of importance, this study (1) assesses 
the association of depression with CRP and exhaled NO 
levels in a large and representative sample of the US 
population, (2) contributes to the neuroimmunological 
dimension of depression, (3) confirms the association of 
depression with high levels of CRP, and (4) assesses, for the 
first time, the association of depression with peripheral NO 
in more than 10,000 subjects from the general population.

instrument that asks participants to choose 1 of 4 responses 
about frequency of depressive symptoms during the previous 
2 weeks.14 Subjects were classified as having depressive 
symptoms if PHQ-9 scores were ≥ 10. Scores ≥ 10 represent 
moderate or severe depressive symptoms.15
CRP Measurement
All adult survey participants were eligible to provide blood 
samples. NHANES CRP measurements were processed at 
the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. CRP 
levels were quantified using latex-enhanced nephelometry. 
Particle-enhanced assays were based on the reaction between 
a soluble analyte and the corresponding antigen or antibody 
bound to polystyrene particles. For the quantification of CRP, 
particles consisting of a polystyrene core and a hydrophilic 
shell were used to link anti-CRP antibodies covalently. A 
dilute solution of test sample was mixed with latex particles 
coated with mouse monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. CRP 
present in the test sample forms an antigen antibody complex 
with the latex particles.16
FeNO Measurement
Adult survey participants were eligible for FeNO testing. 
Participants who had current chest pain or a physical 
problem with forceful expiration or those who were using 
supplemental oxygen were excluded from participation.
FeNO was measured in NHANES using the Aerocrine 
NIOX MINO, a portable, hand-held NO analyzer 
(Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden) approved by the US Food 
and Drug Administration in 2008. This device relies on 
an electrochemical sensor to detect exhaled NO levels and 
provides measurements from 5 to 300 parts per billion 
(ppb) in whole numbers. The testing was conducted with 
participants sitting in front of a mirror so that they could 
see display prompts on the NO analyzer screen. Holding 
the device, participants were first asked to empty their lungs 
and then to place their mouth on the analyzer’s disposable 
filter mouthpiece and to fill their lungs to capacity with 
NO-free air. Participants were then asked to blow out all 
of their air at a constant pressure while exhaled NO from 
the bronchial tree was measured. The device automatically 
provides auditory and visual cues to assist in performing 
the test correctly. The NHANES protocol required 2 FeNO 
measurements that were reproducible, in accordance with 
testing procedures recommended by the manufacturer and 
similar to those published by the American Thoracic Society 
and European Respiratory Society.17
CRP Level Association With Depressive Symptoms
To assess the association of CRP levels with depressive 
symptoms, we conducted 2 types of analyses. In one, we 
analyzed the levels of CRP as a continuous variable, and, in 
the other, we categorized CRP into 4 categories of increasing 
CRP levels: ≤ 1.00 mg/L, 1.01–3.00 mg/L, 3.01–10.00 mg/L, 
and > 10.00 mg/L. This categorization has been used in 
previous studies of CRP and depression.3
To assess the association of depressive symptoms with 
CRP levels, we built linear regression models using log-
transformed CRP levels as the outcome. CRP levels were 
log transformed to approximate normality because CRP 
levels were skewed. In the unadjusted analysis, the only 
covariate included was depressive symptoms as a binary 
Yes/No variable. For the adjusted analyses, we added age 
and body mass index (BMI) as continuous variables and 
gender, self-reported history of diabetes or renal disease, 
and a composite variable that included presence of self-
reported inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), 
cardiovascular conditions (coronary arteriosclerosis, acute 
myocardial infarction, angina, or heart failure), cancer and 
celiac disease, and medications to the model. Medications 
were grouped at level 4 of the hierarchy of the Enhanced 
Therapeutic Classification (ETC; http://www.fdbhealth.
eu/international-drug-knowledge-classifications/). The 
medications included were anti-inflammatory analgesic 
agents, cardiovascular agents, and endocrine agents. All of 
these variables have been associated with CRP levels.18–20 
We also included the PHQ-9 score as a continuous variable 
to the adjusted analysis, instead of having it as depressive 
symptoms Yes/No.
To assess the association of depressive symptoms with 
varying categories of CRP, we built a logistic regression 
model with depressive symptoms as the outcome variable 
and included the categories of CRP, with the lowest category 
as a reference category, in addition to the variables described 
above for the linear regression analysis as covariates. We 
report odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
FeNO Level Association With Depressive Symptoms
To assess the association of depressive symptoms with 
FeNO levels, we built linear regression models using log-
transformed FeNO levels. FeNO levels were log transformed 
to approximate normality because FeNO levels were skewed. 
In the unadjusted analysis, the only covariate included was 
depressive symptoms as a binary Yes/No variable. For the 
adjusted analyses, we added to the model: age and BMI as 
continuous variables and gender, race, self-reported asthma 
(including hay fever, chronic bronchitis), emphysema (a 
variable that indicated if the participant was a smoker), and 
medications. The medications were grouped at level 4 of the 
hierarchy of ETC with the exception of antidepressants that 
were entered as level 2 of the hierarchy. The medications 
included were respiratory agents, anti-inflammatory 
Clinical Points
 
■ Assessing the association of depression with C-reactive 
protein and nitric oxide in a large number of subjects 
representative of the US population will increase the 
understanding of the pathophysiology of depression.
 
■ Analysis of data from National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys showed that depression is associated 
with high levels of C-reactive protein and low levels of 
fractional exhaled nitric oxide.
 
■ Inflammation could play a role in the pathophysiology 
of depression, and depression may be seen as a 
psychoneuroimmunological disorder.

analgesic agents, and endocrine agents, which include 
corticosteroids. Participants were classified as smokers 
if they reported smoking more than 100 cigarettes in 
a lifetime. These variables have been known to affect 
FeNO levels.9,21 We also included variables reflecting 
behaviors immediately prior to the assessment that could 
acutely affect FeNO levels: self-report indicating if the 
participant smoked, exercised during the hour prior to 
the FeNO measurement, or consumed food rich in NO. 
Subjects were provided with the list of food items rich in 
NO when asked the questions.
In addition, we included the PHQ-9 score as a 
continuous variable to the adjusted analysis, instead of 
having it as depressive symptoms Yes/No.
For the linear regression analyses, we report the 
coefficients of a log-transformed variable and also the 
exponentiated coefficient. The exponentiated coefficient 
can be converted into a percent change in CRP or FeNO 
levels associated with being depressed. To help provide 
perspective on the magnitude of the effect of depressive 
symptoms, we also report the effect of asthma on FeNO 
levels.
Association Between FeNO Levels and CRP Levels
To assess the association between FeNO levels and CRP 
levels, we built a linear regression model and included 
age, gender, BMI, and smoking history, in addition to the 
FeNO and CRP levels. FeNO and CRP levels were both 
log transformed.
To correctly account for the complex survey design, all 
the analyses included the Primary Sampling Unit variable 
(sdmvpsu) as the stratification variable (sdmvstra) and the 
Mobile Examination Center (MEC) examination variable 
(wtmec2y) as the weight variable for the CRP. For the 
FeNO analyses, we multiplied the weight variable by 
one-third, because we included 3 survey periods. STATA 
SE version 12.1 (Stata Corp LP) was used to conduct the 
analyses.
Each of the NHANES surveys has been approved by 
the National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics 
Review Board. NHANES releases anonymized coded 
survey data to the public. These are the data used in the 
present study.
RESULTS
A total of 14,276 subjects responded to the PHQ-9, 
and 7.73% had depressive symptoms (Table 1). In terms 
of severity of depressive symptoms, 77.31% had scores 
< 5, 14.96% had scores between 5 and 9 (inclusive), 4.82% 
had scores between 10 and 14, 2.13% had scores between 
15 and 19, and 0.78% had scores > 20.
Of the subjects classified as depressed, 46.06% 
were taking antidepressants. Subjects with depressive 
symptoms were more likely to be women and had more 
medical conditions than subjects with no depressive 
symptoms (Table 1).
CRP Levels
A total of 10,036 subjects had CRP values. CRP levels were 
not normally distributed. The distribution had a skewness of 
7.58 and a kurtosis of 95.12. Natural logarithm transformation 
normalized the distribution (skewness = 0.04, kurtosis = 2.79).
Subjects with depressive symptoms were more likely to have 
conditions that could affect CRP levels, such as self-reported 
history of inflammatory conditions, diabetes, and renal diseases 
(Table 1).
Subjects with depressive symptoms had CRP levels that were 
46% higher than those of nondepressed subjects. The elevated 
levels persisted after adjustment, as subjects with depressive 
symptoms still had levels of CRP that were 31% higher (95% 
CI, 14% to 50%) than subjects with no depressive symptoms 
(Table 2). The analysis using the PHQ-9 score provided similar 
results, ie, there was a 1.90% increase in levels of CRP for each 
unit increase in PHQ-9 score (Table 2).
Almost all of the population (98.86%) had levels of CRP 
≤ 3.0, but a larger proportion of subjects with depressive 
symptoms were in the high CRP categories. Subjects with 
depressive symptoms had much greater odds of being in the

category with the highest CRP levels, > 10 mg/L. The adjusted 
OR for being in such a CRP category was 14.25 (95% CI, 1.58 
to 128.16) (Table 3).
FeNO Levels
A total of 12,513 subjects had at least 2 reproducible FeNO 
measurements. FeNO levels were not normally distributed 
(skewness = 4.58, kurtosis = 47.54) but became normalized 
after natural logarithm transformation (skewness = 0.16, 
kurtosis = 3.32).
Subjects with depressive symptoms were more likely to 
smoke before the FeNO measurement, more likely to report 
a history of smoking, and more likely to have conditions 
that could affect the FeNO levels such as asthma, chronic 
bronchitis, and emphysema.
Subjects with depressive symptoms had FeNO levels that 
were 16% lower than those of subjects without depressive 
symptoms (Table 4). This relationship persisted after 
adjustment, as subjects with depressive symptoms continued 
to have lower FeNO levels (10.7% lower; 95% CI, −2.5% to 
−17.1%) (Table 4). Mean FeNO levels in subjects taking 
antidepressants were similar to FeNO levels of subjects 
not taking antidepressants (2.58 versus 2.61, respectively; 
P = .26). The analysis using the PHQ-9 score provided similar 
results, ie, there is a 0.99% decrease in FeNO levels for each 
unit increase in PHQ-9 score.
Subjects with asthma had FeNO levels that after 
adjustment were 24% higher than those of subjects who did 
not report asthma (Table 4).
Association Between FeNO Levels and CRP Levels
The negative correlation between FeNO and CRP levels 
was no longer statistically significant once smoking history 
was added in the regression model. The P value moved from 
.001 to a P value of .09.
DISCUSSION
We found that depressive symptoms were associated with 
high levels of CRP. Our findings support a body of evidence 
suggesting that depressive symptoms are associated with 
high levels of CRP and that the association remains after 
adjustment.18,19
We analyzed FeNO levels in more than 10,000 subjects 
and found that depressive symptoms were associated with 
low levels of FeNO. Small studies have showed that subjects 
with depressive mood have lower levels of FeNO.10,12 Nitric 
oxide in exhaled air represents 2 sources: inducible and 
constitutive. Elevated FeNO levels have been associated with 
high risk of airway inflammation,9 and the raised exhaled 
NO concentration observed in subjects with asthma is quite 
likely derived from inducible NO synthase. In the absence 
of airway inflammation, FeNO levels represent constitutive 
NO.11,22
Subjects with depression also have low levels of plasma 
and platelet NO.23,24 The low systemic levels of NO have 
been postulated to be responsible for the increased risk of 
cardiovascular events observed in subjects with depression,24 
as NO produces vasodilatation.
The low FeNO levels and high CRP levels observed 
in subjects with depressive symptoms could be seen as 
paradoxical. The complex role of NO in inflammation, 
its dual role, and complex interactions can explain the 
findings. Nitric oxide exerts several modulating effects; it 
regulates humoral and cellular responses and has both anti-
inflammatory and proinflammatory properties.25,26 Also, 
depression and chronic stress could decrease levels of NO 
through increases in oxidative stress or through increases in 
levels of arginase, an enzyme that would interfere with NO 
production.21
Animal studies suggest the role of NO in depression8: 
(1) lower levels of NO in the brain induce antidepressant-
like effects, (2) NO exerts a negative control over levels 
of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, and (3) some 
antidepressants decrease central levels of NO. However, these 
findings are at odds with the present study findings whereby 
subjects with depression had lower FeNO levels than did 
nondepressed subjects.
The studies, including ours, that have shown an association 
of depression with low levels of NO have all measured NO in 
the periphery and not in the central nervous system, where 
NO modulates neurotransmission activity. The inability to 
make direct measurements of NO in the central nervous

from studies (eg, minorities), and therefore the ability to 
generalize the study findings to the US population; second, 
the large number of subjects who responded to a validated 
depression screening questionnaire and had CRP and FeNO 
information; third, high-quality data, due to strict quality 
control and quality assurance protocols; fourth, the use of 
standardized analyses of laboratory results, which decreases 
variability of results; and last, transparency, as the NHANES 
data are made publicly available, and thus the results can be 
replicated.
In summary, this large population-based study found that 
depression is associated with high levels of CRP and low 
levels of FeNO. These findings corroborate the premise that 
inflammation could play a role in the pathophysiology of 
major depression and that major depression may be seen as 
a psychoneuroimmunological disorder. Because the study 
provides a snapshot, we cannot determine whether the role 
of inflammation is causal or reactive.

system makes it difficult to understand the role of NO in 
the pathophysiology of depression.
The magnitude of the decrease in FeNO levels in subjects 
with depressive symptoms is half of the magnitude of the 
change in FeNO levels seen in subjects with asthma,9 but it 
could be much smaller based on variability of the estimate. 
Therefore, the clinical relevance of the decrease in FeNO 
levels observed in subjects with depressive symptoms is 
unclear. Nonetheless, the study findings corroborate prior 
evidence that subjects with depression exhibit lower levels 
of NO in the periphery.
To measure depression, we used the PHQ-9; although 
scores ≥ 10 had an 88% sensitivity and specificity15 for 
major depression, depression was not formally diagnosed 
by a mental health professional. Errors in depression 
classification could lead to underestimation of the association 
of depression with CRP and FeNO levels. The association 
of depressive symptoms with high CRP levels and low 
FeNO levels could reflect the health status of subjects with 
depressive symptoms. Subjects with depressive symptoms 
had more medical conditions and risk factors known to 
be associated with elevated CRP, such as inflammatory 
conditions, or associated with abnormal levels of FeNO, 
such as being a smoker or having asthma. Although the 
associations remained after adjustment, the findings could 
still reflect the poorer health conditions of subjects with 
depressive symptoms. On the other hand, depression could 
be the driver for the occurrence of the comorbidities due 
to its contribution to increased neuroinflammatory and 
systemic inflammatory burden,27 making adjustment 
unnecessary.
Interesting is the finding that a large number of subjects 
with moderate or severe depression were not taking 
antidepressants. A previous report using 2005 to 2008 
NHANES data found that almost 40% of subjects with 
severe depression reported receiving neither treatment from 
a mental health professional nor an antidepressant.14 As 
described above, our study and the latter report14 used the 
PHQ-9 to classify subjects instead of a formal diagnosis; thus, 
the subjects may not have had major depressive disorder.
The use of the NHANES data in the current study 
offers many advantages: first, a population that included 
a representative sample of the US population and assures 
coverage of individuals often excluded or underrepresented
