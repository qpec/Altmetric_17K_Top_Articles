A
pplying an ischemic stimulus distant from the brain 
(remote ischemic conditioning [RIC], eg, transient limb 
ischemia) after a stroke can induce neuroprotection.1 The 
mechanisms of action underlying this are unclear; the produc-
tion of a chemical messenger released from the hypoxic limb 
has been implicated, for example, NO, bradykinin, adenos-
ine, heat-shock proteins, and endocannabinoids.2,3 RIC is an 
attractive prospect because it bears minimal cost and would 
be simple to administer. It may decrease stroke risk in patients 
with intracranial arterial stenosis, and applying RIC in pre-
hospital stroke patients is feasible.4,5 Furthermore, preliminary 
studies of RIC in patients with acute myocardial infarction are 
encouraging.6 In the current study, we aimed to demonstrate 
tolerability and feasibility of RIC in patients presenting to 
hospital with acute stroke while simultaneously investigating 
potential mechanisms of action.
Methods
Trial Design
The RECAST (Remote Ischemic Conditioning After Stroke Trial) 
was a single-center, randomized, outcome-blinded, placebo-con-
trolled trial (ISRCTN 86672015).
Subjects
Adult patients with an ischemic stroke in the past 24 hours causing 
arm or leg weakness were eligible. Exclusion criteria included modi-
fied Rankin Scale score >3, thrombolysis for index event, and signifi-
cant comorbidity. Participants were recruited from Derby Teaching 
Background and Purpose—Repeated episodes of limb ischemia and reperfusion (remote ischemic conditioning [RIC]) may 
improve outcome after acute stroke.
Methods—We performed a pilot blinded placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke, randomized 1:1 
to receive 4 cycles of RIC within 24 hours of ictus. The primary outcome was tolerability and feasibility. Secondary 
outcomes included safety, clinical efficacy (day 90), putative biomarkers (pre- and post-intervention, day 4), and 
exploratory hemodynamic measures.
Results—Twenty-six patients (13 RIC and 13 sham) were recruited 15.8 hours (SD 6.2) post-onset, age 76.2 years (SD 10.5), 
blood pressure 159/83 mm Hg (SD 25/11), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 5 (interquartile 
range, 3.75–9.25). RIC was well tolerated with 49 out of 52 cycles completed in full. Three patients experienced vascular 
events in the sham group: 2 ischemic strokes and 2 myocardial infarcts versus none in the RIC group (P=0.076, log-rank 
test). Compared with sham, there was a significant decrease in day 90 NIHSS score in the RIC group, median NIHSS 
score 1 (interquartile range, 0.5–5) versus 3 (interquartile range, 2–9.5; P=0.04); RIC augmented plasma HSP27 (heat 
shock protein 27; P<0.05, repeated 2-way ANOVA) and phosphorylated HSP27 (P<0.001) but not plasma S100-β, matrix 
metalloproteinase-9, endocannabinoids, or arterial compliance.
Conclusions—RIC after acute stroke is well tolerated and appears safe and feasible. RIC may improve neurological outcome, 
and protective mechanisms may be mediated through HSP27. A larger trial is warranted.

Randomization and Intervention
In addition to standard care (single antiplatelets, blood pressure, 
and cholesterol reduction), RIC was performed on the stroke unit 
immediately after randomization (web-based, 1:1, minimized on 
age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score, 
and systolic blood pressure). Intervention: 4 cycles of intermittent 
limb ischemia; alternating 5 minutes inflation (20 mm Hg above 
systolic blood pressure) and 5 minutes deflation performed manu-
ally using a standard upper arm blood pressure cuff in the non-
paretic arm. Patient position was not specified. The control group 
received a sham procedure (cuff inflation to 30 mm Hg).
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was tolerability and feasibility of RIC after 
acute ischemic stroke.
Secondary Outcomes
Blood samples were collected (pre-RIC, post-RIC, and day 4) for 
surrogate markers of efficacy (plasma S100-β, matrix metallopro-
teinase-9, troponin T), inflammation (C-reactive protein), and other 
putative biomarkers (HSP [heat shock proteins] and endocannabi-
noids). Transcranial Doppler was performed as a continuous beat-
to-beat recording during the intervention; central pressures measured 
with Sphygmocor.7 Serious adverse events, modified Rankin Scale 
score, impairment (NIHSS score and motricity index), Barthel index, 
extended activities of daily living, Zung depression scale, and cog-
nition (Mini-Mental State Examination) were measured at day 90. 
Statistical tests are described in Figure 2 and the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Sample Size
Assuming a meaningful delivery of RIC of at least three of the four 
5-minute cycles, 26 patients gives 90% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that intervention and sham are equally tolerated (SD 
4 minutes and α=0.05). The original sample size was rounded to 
30, but with no losses to follow-up or crossovers, recruitment was 
stopped at 26.
Results
Twenty-six participants were recruited during 27 months 
(Figure 1). All participants had an average age of 76 years; 
mean blood pressure of 159/83 mm Hg, and median NIHSS 
score of 5 (Table). More participants in the control group had 
diabetes mellitus (5 versus 0; P=0.04, Fisher exact test), and 
time to randomization was 15.8 hours.
Tolerability
RIC was well tolerated: 49 out of 52 cycles were completed 
in full. One participant was intolerant of RIC (because of cuff 
pressure), with an overall mean difference between groups of 
46 seconds (P=0.33). 
All patients tolerated the sham procedure. 
Eight (5 RIC and 3 sham) of 26 participants correctly stated at 
day 90 the intervention they received at randomization.
Adverse Events
There were no procedure-related serious adverse events (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement). Three patients experi-
enced vascular events in the control group: 2 ischemic strokes 
(days 6 and 8) and 2 myocardial infarcts in the same patient 
(days 1 and 66) versus none in the RIC group (P=0.076, log-
rank test).
Laboratory Measures
In the RIC group, plasma analysis showed a significant increase 
in total HSP27 (P<0.05, repeated 2-way ANOVA) and phos-
phorylated HSP27 (pHSP27; P<0.001; Figure 2). HSPs 60, 70, 
and 90 did not differ between groups or over time. Similarly, 
plasma C-reactive protein, S100-β, matrix metalloprotein-
ase-9, troponin T, and endocannabinoids did not differ between 
groups (Figures I and II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Hemodynamic Measures
RIC did not significantly affect central blood pressure, mean 
arterial pressure, arterial compliance, or Buckberg index (Figure 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). Most patients were 
ineligible for Transcranial Doppler assessment (atrial fibrillation, 
n=11; proxy consent, n=4; intolerant, n=3; refusal, n=1; and no 
operator, n=3; Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).

Clinical Outcomes
Day 90 modified Rankin Scale score was nonsignificantly 
lower in the treatment group (2 versus 3; P=0.8; Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement). There was a significant 
decrease in day 90 NIHSS score in the RIC group: median 
NIHSS score 1 (interquartile range, 0.5–4) versus 3 (inter-
quartile range, 1–4.5; P=0.04 Mann–Whitney U test).
Discussion
The RECAST has demonstrated that RIC is well tolerated 
after acute stroke and seems safe and feasible. Furthermore, 
RIC may improve neurological outcome and reduce vas-
cular event rates evidenced by a significant improvement in 
NIHSS score and a trend to fewer vascular events by day 90. 
Biomarker studies suggest that protective mechanisms may be 
mediated through phosphorylated HSP27.
There were no serious adverse events relating to RIC with 
only one patient reducing treatment because of cuff pressure 
intolerance. Prehospital RIC after acute stroke seems feasible, 
but at least 18% of patients had a transportation time too short 
for 4 full cycles (the procedure was discontinued on arrival).4 
The primary outcome, penumbral salvage, did not improve 
with RIC, but there were more TIAs and less severe strokes on 
arrival to hospital in the per-conditioned group.4 The absence 
of baseline measurements and an imbalance at randomization 
confounds interpretation of their results.

Numerous messengers have been implicated in ischemic 
conditioning, and we have demonstrated that RIC causes a 
significant increase in serum total HSP27 and phosphory-
lated HSP27 (pHSP27) 4 days after intervention, compared 
with control. Human HSP27 is neuroprotective in experi-
mental stroke, and infarct volume reduction is enhanced if 
HSP is in a phosphorylated form.8 Preclinical models have 
shown benefit using RIC ≤6 hours post-ictus,1 but the role of 
RIC in the current trial is unlikely to be neuroprotective as 
the intervention was too late (16 hours). Inflammation post-
stroke is a process occurring over hours to days; hence, other 
potential mechanisms include reducing cerebral edema1,3 
and inducing ischemic tolerance to recurrent events. Indeed, 
mice overexpressing HSP27 are protected against cerebral 
infarction.3
This trial has several limitations. First, the sample size 
meant the trial was not powered to detect changes in clinical 
outcomes, and the differences seen in neurological improve-
ment and the trend to a reduction in vascular events may be 
because of chance or a greater cardiovascular risk in the con-
trol group. Second, participants receiving stroke thrombolysis 
were not included; the safety of running RIC in parallel with 
hyperacute stroke treatments requires further investigation, 
planned in the RECAST-2, an ongoing pilot study (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02779712). Finally, the lon-
ger-term effects of RIC are unknown and should be consid-
ered in future trial design; RIC may have both acute and more 
prolonged effects.9
