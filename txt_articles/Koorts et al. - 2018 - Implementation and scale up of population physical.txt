Abstract
Background: Few efficacious physical activity interventions are successfully translated and sustained in practice. We
propose a practical guide for researchers to increase the likelihood of successful implementation and scale up of
physical activity interventions in practice contexts. The guide is based on two principles: (i) differences between the
research and practice context can be addressed during intervention development and implementation planning by
focusing on system, delivery personnel, and intervention characteristics; and (ii) early planning for implementation
barriers and facilitators can improve subsequent translation into practice.
Methods: From the published literature, we identified evidence of strategies to improve research-practice translation,
along with narrative descriptions of different approaches to addressing translational challenges. These, along with
constructs taken from widely cited implementation outcome, process, and mechanistic models were collated and
inform the guide.
Results: The resultant PRACTIS guide (PRACTical planning for Implementation and Scale-up) comprised the following
four iterative steps: Step 1) Characterize the parameters of the implementation setting; Step 2) Identify and engage key
stakeholders across multiple levels within the delivery system(s); Step 3) Identify contextual barriers and facilitators to
implementation, and; Step 4) Address potential barriers to effective implementation.
Conclusions: A lack of practical guidance for researchers on how to effectively plan implementation and scale up of
physical activity interventions prevents us moving quickly from evidence to action. We recommend that intervention
development and adaptation for broad and sustained implementation be prioritized early in intervention planning and
include active engagement from delivery organizations and stakeholders. The PRACTIS guide is also relevant for clinical
and public health researchers in other areas of prevention.

Background
The past decade has seen a significant rise in the number
of efficacious interventions to promote physical activity
[1]. Although promising, only a minority of these inter-
ventions move from research into practice, and those that
do provide limited information on sustainability or
institutionalization
within
routine
practice
[2].
The
movement of research to practice settings is a dynamic
process that includes dissemination, implementation, and
scale-up. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) define
dissemination as the targeted distribution of information
and intervention materials to a specific public health or
clinical practice audience, with the intent to spread know-
ledge and the associated evidence-based interventions [3].
Implementation is the use of strategies to adopt and inte-
grate evidence-based health interventions and change
practice patterns within specific settings [3]. Scale-up is

 described as replicating and extending the reach of an
intervention into other localities, cities, or regions [2].
Scalability describes an intervention’s potential to be
delivered to an increasing number of participants or
through an increasing number of settings, while retaining
effectiveness [4].
There are some clear examples of dissemination [5],
implementation [6], and scale-up of physical activity in-
terventions [7, 8]. However, across three decades of
physical activity intervention research, the majority of
publications have been efficacy/effectiveness trials and
only 3% comprised dissemination studies [4]. This con-
tinued lack of evidence for the successful institutionali-
sation of physical activity interventions in real-world
settings, combined with unacceptably high levels of
physical inactivity worldwide [9, 10], makes addressing
the research-to-practice gap a significant public health
priority.
Implementing and sustaining physical activity inter-
ventions in practice contexts is challenging [11, 12].
These challenges are grounded in the social-ecological
differences between testing a physical activity interven-
tion within an efficacy trial under optimal conditions to
dissemination, implementation, and scale-up trials where
multilevel infrastructure, resources, values, and charac-
teristics of participants are much more variable [13–15].
In public health and health promotion research, dissem-
ination is often an afterthought in the program life cycle,
or conceptualized as a separate process that occurs at
some nonspecific time after efficacy trials are completed
[16]. Features of the implementation context which can
influence the impact of an intervention (i.e. delivery cap-
acity of implementers and organizations [17]), may also
only be addressed when an intervention is considered
ready for dissemination. As a result, when efficacious in-
terventions are implemented in real-world settings, they
can either fail to be adopted or report lower effect sizes,
and are less likely to be sustained over time [5, 18].
There have been calls for the research community to
shift the focus from small scale tightly controlled inter-
ventions to evaluating those capable of dissemination
and
translation
[2].
Pragmatic
trials
[19],
hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trials [20] and participa-
tory research approaches [21–23] are examples of study
designs more suited to community and clinical-relevant
research. These approaches engage key stakeholders,
prioritize
implementation
outcomes
and
assess
the
generalizability of intervention effects. In addition, there
have been calls to improve the translation of research
into practice by considering a broader set of metrics,
such as generalisability and sustainability, and to in-
crease the adoption of theory-driven implementation re-
search. For example, systems science methods (e.g.
social
network
analysis,
agent-based
modelling
and
system dynamics) can elucidate the effects of dissem-
ination and implementation barriers and facilitators
on
intervention
outcomes
[24].
Measurement
of
implementation outcomes, such as intervention feasi-
bility and implementation cost, can be used as a
proximal indicator of implementation processes, suc-
cess, and sustainability [25].
There has been an increased recognition of the im-
portance of theory-driven approaches to enhance dis-
semination and implementation research [26]. Extending
beyond Roger’s Diffusion of Innovations Theory [27],
which underpins a large body of dissemination research,
there are currently over 60 published theories, models
and frameworks [28]. Although methodological advances
to support dissemination, implementation and scale-up
trials are promising, theories, models and frameworks
do not provide guidance
on how best to initiate
contextually-relevant processes to engage and work with
typical community or clinical organizations. There is a
gap in the current literature which explicitly describes
‘how to’ enact strategies to successfully translate research
into practice.
The ‘how to’ guide proposed here does not purport to
be a new framework or model. Rather, it draws on exist-
ing models and frameworks to address how to plan for
implementation and scale-up during intervention devel-
opment, testing and ongoing adaptation. We propose
that prioritising factors relevant to dissemination, imple-
mentation,
and
scale-up
early
within
the
research
process, will enable potential barriers to be addressed
and their impact measured; although this remains to be
tested and is beyond the scope of this paper. The PRAC-
TIS (PRACTical planning for Implementation and Sca-
le-up) guide outlines a structure for researchers and
stakeholders, with varying levels of implementation ex-
perience and expertise, to navigate the complex consid-
erations and decision-making processes involved in
translating evidence-based interventions into practice.
The purpose is to increase the likelihood that physical
activity interventions can be implemented at scale and
sustained in practice contexts. The challenges associated
with intervention implementation and scale-up are rele-
vant across all areas of public health prevention. For the
purposes of this paper, therefore, we refer to physical
activity intervention research to discuss these issues and
illustrate operationalization of the PRACTIS guide.
Methods
The guide was developed based on two bodies of
relevant
literature
addressing
strategies
to
improve
research-practice translation, and constructs associated
with effective implementation from widely cited imple-
mentation outcome, process, and mechanistic models.

 To identify processes to improve research-practice
translation, we refer to literature outlining strategies
used to enhance implementation of evidence-based prac-
tices [29, 30], and the challenges of making research
findings relevant to community and clinical systems [12,
31–33]. Common critiques include lack of representa-
tiveness of participants and intervention implementation
staff, and a focus on achieving the largest effect possible,
without a focus on the financial, resource, and human
capital costs or even a consideration of the most likely
system that would ultimately implement a physical activ-
ity intervention. Specifically, when planning an interven-
tion, it is recommended to consider strategies to address
participant reach and representativeness, organizational
staff and system adoption, delivery ease and quality of
implementation, and intervention sustainability [34].
Our summary of this literature encouraging an expan-
sion of outcome assessment within dissemination, imple-
mentation, and scale-up research is included in the
guide. It informed the development of a comprehensive
checklist to support researcher and stakeholder planning
that addresses strategies to improve implementation, dis-
semination and scale-up, and tools to aid the decision
making processes used to develop partnerships with sys-
tems that will ultimately apply research findings within
practice.
To identify constructs associated with effective imple-
mentation, we referred to a second body of literature
summarizing
implementation
theories,
models
and
frameworks [26, 28]. Frameworks were chosen for
inclusion in the PRACTIS guide based on the following
criteria: (i) a typology of constructs associated with ef-
fective dissemination, implementation, and/or scale-up;
(ii) specifying causal multi-level associations with imple-
mentation effectiveness; (iii) developed based on either
empirical results or unifying constructs from existing
conceptual frameworks/theories; (iv) previous applica-
tion in physical activity and preventive health research
and; (v) applicability to a variety of implementation set-
tings. Three widely cited explanatory frameworks were
identified: the Interactive Systems Framework (ISF) [17],
the ecological framework for effective implementation
[14], and the Consolidated Framework for Implementa-
tion Research (CFIR) [35].
Constructs within each framework were individually
tabulated and grouped based on five higher order do-
mains described within the frameworks (implementer
characteristics; organizational characteristics; interven-
tion
characteristics;
community
characteristics
and;
process of implementation). We compared and con-
trasted the constructs and propositions from each of
these frameworks, and identified overlapping constructs
based on a shared definition or meaning (i.e. ‘skills’ in
the ISF and ‘skill proficiency’ in Durlak and Dupre’s
ecological framework), and a comparable level of impact
(i.e. organizational or community level). A total of 85
individual constructs existed across the three frame-
works, which resulted in 72 overlapping ‘common’ con-
structs, to produce a compilation of multi-level barriers
to implementation (see Additional file 1 which presents
the framework constructs). As the five higher order
domains from these frameworks span all levels of the
social-ecological model, they were used as areas of
emphasis throughout our proposed guide.
A draft of the guide was piloted among physical activ-
ity and nutrition experts (n = 9) during an Implementa-
tion Science workshop held at an Australian University
in October 2017. Registration was voluntarily and there
were no costs to participate. Feedback during this work-
shop led to revisions to the explanatory text within the
guide, to improve use ability and application of the guide
in practice.
The proposed PRACTIS guide
The guide is based on the following underlying princi-
ples. First, multi-level differences that exist between the
research (intervention testing) and practice (intervention
implementation) context can be best addressed during
early intervention planning that engages stakeholders.
Second, early anticipation and planning for barriers to
intervention implementation, typical in community or
clinical settings, can improve the translation of evidence
to practice.
The guide describes a series of steps outlining how
best to plan the dissemination, implementation, and
scale-up of physical activity interventions for clinical and
public health settings: Step 1) Characterize the parame-
ters of the implementation setting; Step 2) Identify and
engage key stakeholders across multiple levels within the
delivery system(s); Step 3) Identify contextual barriers
and facilitators to implementation, and; Step 4) Address
potential barriers to effective implementation. Character-
istics of the potential implementation context feature as
the foremost component of the guide. The ‘implementa-
tion context’ refers to the physical, social and cultural
environment where the physical activity intervention
would be integrated. The implementation context also
includes who, what and how the intervention would
be delivered if research funding has ceased. Charac-
teristics
of
the
implementation
context
(Step
1)
underpin all decisions and strategies to improve im-
plementation planning and intervention testing (Steps
2-4). Figure 1 presents an overarching process flow-
chart of the steps required.
The process begins by engaging key stakeholders to
consider: the population who will receive or deliver the
intervention; the place where the intervention will be im-
plemented; the intervention and implementation process;
Koorts et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2018) 15:51

 the provisions needed for implementation; and the princi-
ples underpinning scale up. Optimally, iterative evaluation
is used to refine implementation strategies for dissemin-
ation, for sustained implementation, and to assess out-
comes when scale-up is complete.
Outcomes from Steps 1- 4 are likely to contribute to
more effective strategies for intervention implementa-
tion, and also to assessments of implementation-related
outcomes (e.g. reach, delivery quality, acceptability,
compatibility, costs). Each Step considers multi-level
influences
on
implementation
of
physical
activity
interventions in practice settings. Common constructs
identified from within key implementation frameworks
inform potential barriers in Step 3. Formative and
process
evaluation
approaches
[36,
37],
including
intervention testing methodologies [12, 31, 34], inform
strategies to address potential barriers to effective
implementation in Step 4.
We present these steps as a linear process of repeated
cycles, but acknowledge that steps are not mutually ex-
clusive and the process is iterative, thus will reflect
learnings from systematic implementation efforts. For
example, identifying barriers in Step 3 may lead to revi-
siting how the parameters of the implementation setting
are characterized. The Steps may occur sequentially, in-
clude overlapping activities, and/or in a different order
depending on the complexity of the intervention and
setting. The Steps should be followed as contextually
appropriate.
Step 1: Characterize parameters of the implementation
setting
Step 1 describes features of the proposed implementation
setting, pinpointing gaps in the planning process. Early
familiarization
with
characteristics
of
the
real-world
implementation context promotes planning and account-
ability for future implementation, and may enhance imple-
mentation efforts. Table 1 presents a 15-item checklist
containing 38 questions to guide researcher and stake-
holder familiarisation with the potential implementation
setting. Researchers and stakeholders can complete the
checklist independently, to enable differences in perspec-
tives and expectations regarding implementation to be
highlighted and addressed. Questions within this checklist
can also be used to guide researcher-stakeholder discus-
sions on target areas of importance (Step 2). As disparities
exist in physical activity participation [38], special consid-
eration is given across the checklist to reflect on high need
populations that may be more at risk of physical inactivity
due to particular disparities. The process within this guide
is iterative and therefore some checklist items may only be
answerable after stakeholder consultation or intervention
piloting, for example. The checklist should be used to
identify gaps or areas for further exploration throughout
the implementation and scale up process as new informa-
tion emerges.
Checklist items correspond to key issues relating to
intervention adoption, delivery and sustainability in
practice, potential scalability of the intervention and

 implementation process, and important multi-level con-
textual characteristics. Checklist responses contribute to
describing: who/how many people the intervention will
reach and which individuals will be involved/required
for effective implementation (i.e. People); what settings/
organizations will be involved/required (i.e. Place); how
the intervention or implementation process will occur
(i.e. Process); what resources may be necessary to
achieve this (i.e. Provisions); and the underlying princi-
ples of the intervention (e.g. individual behavior change)
and implementation process (e.g. building capacity for
implementation) that will be scaled-up (i.e. Principles).

Outcomes from the five P’s inform: (i) actions required
to make the intervention implementable and/or scalable;

 scale-up; and (iii) formative evaluation strategies and/or
process measures that may improve implementation and
scale-up. Researchers may complete the checklist inde-
pendently or in collaboration with stakeholders identi-
fied in Step 2, however responses should be presented to
stakeholders for validation or refinement.
Step 2: Identify and engage key stakeholders across
multiple levels within the delivery system(s)
The aim of Step 2 is to identify and engage with key stake-
holders (individuals or organizations) in interventions. Ir-
respective of the target setting, participatory research with
stakeholders can facilitate implementation and sustainabil-
ity of physical activity interventions, for example in com-
munity [39] and school settings [40], and scale up of
physical activity interventions requires partnerships be-
yond the health sector [2]. An intervention that considers
stakeholder priorities may lead to improved engagement
and involvement [41], as implementation will be opti-
mized through an understanding of an intervention’s likely
or potential ‘fit’. Figure 2 presents a decision tree to facili-
tate stakeholder identification.
To operationalize the decision tree (Fig. 2), firstly iden-
tify stakeholders (individuals or organizations) that will:
(i) fund and/or have overarching responsibility or ‘own-
ership’ for the intervention; (ii) disseminate (distribute)
the intervention to the target setting and population; (iii)
host and/or deliver the intervention either in the target
setting or to the target population; and (iv) receive the
intervention
(target
user).
Stakeholder
discussions
should aim to increase awareness of the research, prac-
tice and policy activities involved in implementation and
scale up, and facilitate effective information exchange,
collaboration
and use
of
existing
knowledge
[42].
Strategies for effective stakeholder engagement and
communication should feature throughout implemen-
tation, to ensure transparency in roles and responsi-
bilities,
and
agreement
on
outcome
expectations.
Depending on the context and scale of implementa-
tion (i.e. targeting 100 or 10,000 people), stakeholders
may represent multiple distinct organizations or mul-
tiple distinct roles within any one organization. De-
pending on the type of intervention, stakeholders may
also represent single or multiple ‘systems’ (i.e. health,
education, transport systems).
Strategies and resources required to engage these
stakeholders will therefore differ based on the type of
intervention, scale of implementation and number of
systems that will be involved in delivery. Outcomes from
the
decision
tree
will
highlight
opportunities
to
strengthen or seek new stakeholder relationships, and
possible limitations if engagement and/or participation is
suboptimal.
Step 3: Identify contextual barriers and facilitators to
implementation
The purpose of Step 3 is to identify potential contextual
barriers and facilitators to implementation and scale-up,
to enhance integration of research findings into practice
[32]. Figure 3 presents an ecological model depicting 45
of the 72 overlapping ‘common’ constructs, identified
from the three frameworks. The remaining 27 ‘common’
constructs are not depicted in Fig. 3 for pragmatic
reasons, as they either underpin another CFIR construct
presented
in
Fig.
3
(see
italicized
constructs
in
Additional file 1) or are constructs that influence all
levels of the ecological model. Constructs influencing all
ecological levels include intervention characteristics (i.e.
intervention’s legitimacy, quality/validity of evidence,
adaptability,
trialability,
complexity,
compatibility,
relative advantage, design quality and cost) [14, 35], and
the process of implementation (i.e. intervention specific
and general capacity building [14, 17], and planning, en-
gaging, executing, reflecting and evaluating the imple-
mentation process [35]).
The purpose of Fig. 3 (and Additional file 1) is to illus-
trate the breadth of commonly occurring factors that
may require exploration with stakeholders during imple-
mentation planning and intervention testing. This com-
pilation could be useful in pinpointing aspects of the
intervention design and implementation/scale-up plan
that may warrant refinement or further testing. The
compilation can also be used as a reference tool when
completing the 15-item checklist in Step 1, and provide
a pictorial representation of potential challenges to im-
plementation when engaging with stakeholders in Step 2.
Step 4: Address potential barriers to effective
implementation
The purpose of Step 4 is to address potential barriers to
effective implementation identified in Step 3, through re-
finements to the intervention and implementation process
with stakeholders, and/or formal assessment of their im-
pact
on
implementation
and
intervention
outcomes
through research testing. Table 3 presents example strat-
egies to be incorporated during intervention and imple-
mentation planning (formative evaluation) and/or during
intervention testing (process and outcome evaluation),
which may improve research-practice translation.
Translational formative evaluation [43] can include
practice-based activities (i.e. strategic partnering with
stakeholders, community members, decision-makers and
opinion leaders associated with future implementation
and scale-up), and research-based activities (i.e. needs
assessments, feasibility and pilot trials) to assess local
needs, values and intervention compatibility with the
local context. Process measures are assessed in parallel
to intervention testing, and can elucidate underlying
Koorts et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2018) 15:51 
Page 6 of 11
 mechanisms in the intervention context that may ex-
plain outcomes or how to move from research to prac-
tice [44]. Example ways of using formative and process
evaluation to inform implementation and scale-up of
physical activity interventions are described in the fol-
lowing section.
Operationalizing the PRACTIS guide
To exemplify operationalization of the PRACTIS guide, we
retrospectively applied the guide to four evidence-based
physical activity interventions previously translated into
clinical and community settings (see Additional file 2 for a
summary of these case studies). To illustrate how outcomes
from Step 1 correspond to implementation planning, we
present information from these example interventions
against the criteria of the five P’s (Table 2). The example in-
terventions have all been adopted and implemented at a
state or national level in the United States or Australia and
were designed with implementation in mind. These inter-
ventions were chosen as they adopted a range of interven-
tion strategies and targeted varying populations and
settings, for example: early childcare centers (Nutrition and

 Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care [NAP
SACC] [45]), the school setting (the Child and Adolescent
Trial for Cardiovascular Health [CATCH] [46, 47]), and
community-based/clinical
healthcare
contexts
(Healthy
Living after Cancer [HLaC] [48] and Move More [49]).
Findings from earlier trials of NAP SACC have led to the
development of an online delivery version to extend the
program’s reach (‘Go NAP SACC’ [50]). For the purpose of
this paper, we only draw on early publications detailing
original study/intervention design and implementation
planning processes.
The use of case studies to illustrate application of the
guide highlights the variation in coverage of the four
Steps. Consistent across all intervention examples, was
that information gathered on the ‘five P’s’ to determine
the parameters of the implementation context was used
in each of the subsequent Steps. Each intervention
adopted a participatory and collaborative approach to
the co-production of evidence, drawing on stakeholders
to guide the research design and implementation plan-
ning process, in addition to having input into interven-
tion materials and resources. While these case studies
are only briefly presented here and based on the avail-
able published descriptions of implementation planning,

Intervention population
(Individual level)
• Focus groups with target population to explore
barriers and facilitators to intervention design at scale
and fostering sustained participation.
• Needs assessments to address current gaps between
what is available versus what is required by target
population.
• Measure characteristics of responders and non-
responders, and compare with general population to
assess representativeness and generalizability.
• Compare participant characteristics with retention and
outcome variables.
• Measure participant perceptions of intervention
characteristics, and explore association with uptake,
delivery and outcomes.
Implementers (Provider level)
• Focus groups with target implementers to explore
existing implementation infrastructure and feasibility
of intended intervention delivery.
• Participatory approaches allow target user input on
intervention design, training and implementation
strategy, and can assist in identifying potential
‘champion’ implementers.
• Measure level of intervention delivery (i.e. dose
delivered, dose received, and fidelity/adaptation) and
assess associations with implementer characteristics.
• Explore associations between level of delivery and
intervention, and implementer characteristics.
• Measure perceived barriers and facilitators to
intervention delivery and sustainability, compare
changes in delivery with outcomes over time.
Delivery setting/org.
(Organizational level)
• Consultation/participatory research approaches with
stakeholders (delivery settings who will support/
provide the training/host implementers) on existing
dissemination strategies and implementation
infrastructure, to identify barriers to sustained
implementation.
• Measure characteristics of delivery setting (i.e. size)
and explore association with adoption decision,
intervention delivery (i.e. dose) and intervention

Discussion
Challenges and recommendations to improve interven-
tion dissemination and implementation are well docu-
mented [31, 34, 51]. What is less well established is how
researchers should apply this knowledge pragmatically
to improve the implementation of physical activity inter-
ventions in real-world settings. The PRACTIS guide ad-
dresses this gap and demonstrates how to map features
of the implementation setting, identify and engage im-
portant stakeholders, and anticipate and address poten-
tial barriers and facilitators to effective implementation
and scale up.
It is assumed that interventions must first demonstrate
efficacy under controlled conditions in a randomised
trial, then effectiveness under real-world conditions, and
finally evidence for potential scale up and subsequent
dissemination [52]. In the context of behavioral inter-
ventions in particular, this sequential progression from
efficacy to dissemination has been criticised on the basis
that efficacy trials tell us little about the generalizability
of interventions [53–55]. There is also the implicit as-
sumption that dissemination and implementation may
only be considered later in the research process. Con-
trary to Flay et al. (2005), we propose that conceptual
and methodological issues in translation, constructs
identified in implementation frameworks, and strategies
to improve the translation of physical activity interven-
tions, can and should be considered from the beginning
of intervention development. Starting with the end ap-
plication in mind can strengthen translation efforts [34],
address challenges of dissemination [16], and may be
linked to more successful scale-up efforts [56]. Engaging
practice professionals and other stakeholders early in
intervention planning may also strengthen research
translation efforts and enhance application of the pro-
posed steps [15].
The guide is also applicable when planning scaled-up
interventions in other areas of public health prevention.
Unlike discrete intervention trials targeting small popu-
lations, at scale the impact of system-level factors such
as bureaucratic cultures, political environments and glo-
bal trends may be amplified [57]. Funding and resources
are also more likely to be sourced from within user orga-
nizations or the broader delivery systems (i.e. health,
education, political), until intervention costs become in-
tegrated into national and local budgets [58]. Interven-
tion flexibility and contextual adaptation are critical
credentials for the widespread adoption of interventions
across diverse sociocultural settings [56]. Irrespective of
the scale of implementation, adaptation can be both de-
sirable (such as adapted intervention modality to in-
crease reach) and undesirable (such as a lower dose of
delivery due to conflicting demands) [59]. Ascertaining
intervention flexibility and associated effectiveness fol-
lowing contextual adaptation, should feature within all
public health intervention planning. Successful scale up
may depend on the interaction between an intervention’s
intensity and the resources available within the delivery
setting [5, 60]. The PRACTIS guide is hypothesized to
result in intervention and implementation adaptations
that align more closely to resources available within the
delivery context.
Real-world implementation is an evolving process that
mirrors constant changes in the physical and social en-
vironment. As the intervention and research progresses,
and new information emerges, this guide may need to be
revisited. Addressing all potential barriers to implemen-
tation (Step 3) may neither be feasible nor necessary,
and decisions in Step 4 are likely to be informed by bar-
rier implications, researcher capacity and pragmatism.
For example, system-level barriers such as existing
policies which conflict with intervention objectives or a
political system that does not prioritize preventive
health, will require complex resolutions that are not
immediately ‘solvable’. Researcher capability to respond
to a barrier may therefore be limited, irrespective of
well-meaning intentions or strong supportive evidence.
Abandonment (or de-implementation) of health inter-
ventions should occur, for example, when evidence contra-
dicts existing practices [61]. However, de-implementation
can depend on multiple factors, beyond scientific evidence,
such as cultural, societal values and inertia [61]. For ex-
ample, interventions that are ‘designed for scalability’ at an
individual level (e.g. using an online modality to facilitate
broad reach among target users) or have demonstrated evi-
dence for effectiveness, may still fail to achieve sustained
stakeholder support for implementation, due to entrenched
organizational or system level factors. We hypothesize that
de-implementation is best achieved when alternative op-
tions are available and a participatory approach is used to
match intervention strategies to organizational resources as
described in the PRACTIS guide. Following the guide may
also help identify circumstances when further testing and/
or adaptation of interventions should cease, or when aban-
don of implementation is more viable.
This guide is not without limitations and the complex-
ities and costs of implementation within single and
multiple systems should not be understated. To date, the
majority of implementation research has emanated from
clinical and health service contexts and it is unclear if
such
evidence
is
transferable
to
physical
activity
intervention research where the ‘place’ of delivery ex-
tends to a wide variety of community settings. Solutions

 to implementation barriers are also likely to differ by set-
tings, multicomponent implementation strategies may
be suited to different stages of implementation [30], and
the appropriateness and effectiveness of strategies may
vary by translation phase [62]. It is also less clear
whether implementation variables should be prioritized
in specific contexts, and which implementation strategy
is best under which circumstance. Future research which
investigates these core issues is needed. We encourage
researchers to apply this population-focused guide and
critically evaluate the proposed process.
Conclusions
Complex characteristics of real-world implementation
settings and the multilevel barriers to effective imple-
mentation are two of the many challenges faced when
translating evidence-based interventions into practice.
Those who are interested in translating physical activity
promotion research into sustained practice are encour-
aged to use, and may benefit from, the PRACTIS guide
to inform and operationalize their work. This guide is
also relevant for clinical and public health researchers in
other areas of prevention, to translate evidence-based
interventions into real-world settings.
