Certain low pathogenic avian influenza viruses can mutate to highly pathogenic viruses when they circulate in do-
mestic poultry, at which point they can cause devastating poultry diseases and severe economic damage. The H7N9 
influenza viruses that emerged in 2013 in China had caused severe human infections and deaths. However, these 
viruses were nonlethal in poultry. It is unknown whether the H7N9 viruses can acquire additional mutations during 
their circulation in nature and become lethal to poultry and more dangerous for humans. Here, we evaluated the evo-
lution of H7N9 viruses isolated from avian species between 2013 and 2017 in China and found 23 different genotypes, 
7 of which were detected only in ducks and were genetically distinct from the other 16 genotypes that evolved from 
the 2013 H7N9 viruses. Importantly, some H7N9 viruses obtained an insertion of four amino acids in their hemag-
glutinin (HA) cleavage site and were lethal in chickens. The index strain was not lethal in mice or ferrets, but readily 
obtained the 627K or 701N mutation in its PB2 segment upon replication in ferrets, causing it to become highly lethal 
in mice and ferrets and to be transmitted efficiently in ferrets by respiratory droplet. H7N9 viruses bearing the HA 
insertion and PB2 627K mutation have been detected in humans in China. Our study indicates that the new H7N9 
mutants are lethal to chickens and pose an increased threat to human health, and thus highlights the need to control 
and eradicate the H7N9 viruses to prevent a possible pandemic.

Introduction
Influenza viruses are negative-sense RNA viruses, 
whose genome comprises eight gene segments: basic 
polymerase 2 (PB2), basic polymerase 1 (PB1), acidic 
polymerase (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein 
(NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and nonstructur-
al protein (NS). Each gene segment encodes one or two 
proteins. Influenza A viruses are categorized into differ-
ent subtypes on the basis of antigenic differences in their 
two surface glycoproteins: HA and NA. Currently, 16 
different HA and 9 different NA subtypes of influenza vi-
ruses have been detected in avian species, but only three 
subtypes, namely H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, have caused 
influenza pandemics in humans [1, 2]. 
In the last two decades, avian influenza viruses of the 
H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes have continued to present 
challenges to the poultry industry and human health. The 
H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have 
caused infections and disease outbreaks among poultry 
and wild birds in over 60 countries around the world [3, 4], 
and have sporadically jumped to humans and caused se-

vere disease and deaths [5]. Several studies have indicat-
ed that the H5N1 influenza viruses will become transmis-
sible in mammals if they acquire more mutations in their 
HA protein that allow them to recognize human-type re-
ceptors and the mutation of lysine (K) at position 627 of 
their PB2 [6-8], or if they reassort with human influenza 
viruses [9]. 
H7N9 subtype viruses have caused severe human 
infections and deaths every year in China since they 
emerged in 2013 [10]. Epidemiology studies have shown 
that humans become infected mainly through exposure 
to virus-infected poultry or a contaminated environment 
[11-15]. Biologic studies on H7N9 viruses have revealed 
several important characters: (i) the viruses can replicate 
efficiently in chickens but do not cause disease in any 
avian species [16]; (ii) most of the viruses can bind hu-
man-type receptors [16-19], mainly because they bear 
valine (V) at position 186 and leucine (L) at position 226 
in their HA protein [18] (H3 numbering used through-
out), which is an important determinant for avian influ-
enza virus to infect humans; and (iii) when the viruses 
replicate in humans, they can easily obtain the glutamic 
acid (E) to K mutation at position 627 (E627K) or aspar-
tic acid (D) to asparagine (N) mutation at position 701 
(D701N) in their PB2 [10, 11, 16, 20, 21]. These two 
mutations are known to increase the virulence and trans-
missibility of avian influenza viruses in mammals [22-
27]. Indeed, the human H7N9 viruses are transmissible 
in ferrets, although their transmissibility varies among 
different strains [16, 17, 28-30]. The ability to bind to 
human-type receptors and transmit in mammals is an im-
portant indicator of the pandemic potential of the H7N9 
viruses. However, because the H7N9 viruses showed low 
pathogenicity in poultry, strategies to eradicate them in 
poultry have not been successful in China, with the ex-
ception of the temporary closure of live poultry markets 
in cities where human cases were detected. 
The low pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza virus-
es are predisposed to acquire more mutations when they 
circulate in gallinaceous poultry and subsequently be-
come highly pathogenic for chickens and turkeys, as oc-
curred of the H5N2 outbreak in the United States in 1983 
[31], the H5N2 outbreak in Mexico in 1995 [32], and 
the H7N1 outbreak in Italy in 1999 [33]. It is unknown 
whether the H7N9 viruses can acquire additional muta-
tions during their circulation in nature and become lethal 
to poultry. Therefore, close monitoring and evaluation of 
the H7N9 viruses have important implications for both 
animal and human public health. Here, we characterized 
H7N9 viruses isolated from avian species in China be-
tween 2013 and 2017. 
Results
Surveillance and genetic analysis of H7N9 avian influen-
za viruses 
To monitor the evolution of the H7N9 viruses in poul-
try, we collected 112 593 samples from poultry markets, 
farms, wild bird habitats, and slaughterhouses in 24 
provinces from July 2013 to January 2017, and inoculat-
ed the samples individually into 10-day-old embryonated 
chicken eggs for virus isolation. In total, 3 664 influenza 
viruses were detected from these samples, of which 293 
strains of H7N9 viruses were isolated across 17 provinc-
es (Supplementary information, Table S1). Six viruses 
were isolated from samples collected from chicken farms 
in Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces; 
all of the other viruses were isolated from samples col-
lected from live poultry markets (Supplementary infor-
mation, Table S1). 
To detect the key mutations that may significantly af-
fect the biologic properties of the viruses, portions of the 
HA and PB2 genes of the 293 viruses were sequenced. 
We found that 280 and 266 of the 293 avian viruses bear

186V and 226L mutations, respectively, in their HA, but 
none of them bear the 627K or 701N mutations in their 
PB2 (Table 1). Importantly, 12 extra nucleotides (-aaac-
ggactgcg-) encoding four amino acids (-KRTA-) in the 
cleavage site of HA were detected in seven viruses isolat-
ed from chickens in Guangdong province in 2017 (Table 
1).
To investigate the genetic relationships among these 
viruses, we sequenced 83 representative viruses from 
different sampling times, places, and species. The HA 
genes of these viruses shared 88%-100% identity at the 
nucleotide level and formed four phylogenetic groups 
(Figure 1A). The HA genes of the group 1 viruses shared 
over 97% identity and clustered with the HA genes of the 
2013/H7N9 viruses, whereas the HA genes of the other 
three groups belonged to viruses that emerged in China 
during this time period and were detected only in ducks. 
The NA genes of these viruses shared 90%-100% 
identity at the nucleotide level and formed three phyloge-
netic groups (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). 
The six internal genes of these H7N9 viruses showed 
distinct diversity, with the PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS 
genes of the 83 viruses sharing 84.8%-100%, 88.6%-
100%, 86.8%-100%, 86.4%-100%, 88.5%-100%, and 
87.8%-100% identity, respectively, at the nucleotide 
level. The PB1 and NP genes each formed eight groups 
in the phylogenetic trees (Supplementary information, 
Figure S1C and S1E), and the PB2, PA, M, and NS genes 
each formed six, nine, five, and four groups, respectively, 
in their phylogenetic trees (Supplementary information, 
Figure S1B, S1D, S1F, and S1G). 
Given this genomic diversity, we divided these H7N9 
viruses into 23 different genotypes (Figure 1B). The 
predominant viruses were categorized as genotype 1 
and 2 viruses because they were detected in eight and 
nine provinces, respectively; the viruses in the other 
genotypes were only detected in one to three provinces 
(Figure 1B; Supplementary information, Figure S3). The 
seven viruses bearing the four amino acid insertion in 
their HA belonged to genotypes 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 1B). 
Of note, the time-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggested 
that the HA mutants may have arisen from two different 
H7N9 viruses (Supplementary information, Figure S2), 
one of which subsequently reassorted with others to form 
two more genotypes (Figure 1, viruses labeled with two 
stars).
Replication and virulence of H7N9 HA mutant A/chick-
en/Guangdong/SD008/2017 (CK/SD008) in chickens
The minimum motif in the HA cleavage site associated 
with high pathogenicity of H5 and H7 influenza viruses 
in chickens is -BXBR- (B = basic amino acids arginine or 
lysine, X = any amino acid, R = arginine) [34] or -RXXR- 
[35]. The motif in the new H7N9 viruses is “-KRTAR-”, 
which meets the criterion of “-RXXR-” for high patho-
genicity. Since not all H5 or H7 viruses that bear these 
motifs are highly pathogenic to chickens [36, 37], and 
the H7N9 mutants were all isolated from apparently 
healthy chickens in live poultry markets, we investigated 
their virulence by testing the intravenous pathogenicity 
index (IVPI) of the index strain A/chicken/Guangdong/
SD008/2017 (CK/SD008) [38]. Groups of 10 6-week-
old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were inoc-
ulated intravenously with 0.1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of 
bacteria-free allantoic fluid containing 107.7 50% egg 
infectious dose (EID50) of the virus. All of the chickens 
inoculated with the virus died within 24 h post-inocu-
lation (p.i.) (Figure 2A), yielding an IVPI value of 3 (0 
= least pathogenic; 3 = most pathogenic). We collected 
brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, pancreases, hearts, livers, 
and cecum from three chickens that were inoculated with 
CK/SD008 and determined viral titers in eggs. The virus 
was detected in all of these organs with mean titers rang-
ing from 5.3 to 7.9 log10EID50/g (Figure 2B). We also 
inoculated 13 SPF chickens intranasally (i.n.) with 10
6 
EID50 of CK/SD008. Three chickens were killed on day 3 
p.i. for virus titration and the other 10 were observed for 
signs of disease and death. The virus replicated system-
ically in chickens after i.n. inoculation and was detected 
in both pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (Figure 2B); the 
observed chickens died within 4 days of infection (Figure 
2A). Our results indicate that an H7N9 virus isolated in 
2017 that descended from the H7N9 viruses that emerged 
in China in 2013 has mutated into a highly pathogenic 
strain for chickens.
Replication and virulence of H7N9 virus CK/SD008 in 
mice
The multiple basic amino acid motif in the HA cleav-
age site of H5N1 influenza viruses is a prerequisite for 
lethality in mammals [25, 39], but not all H5N1 viruses 
that have this motif are lethal in these animals [40, 41]. 
To investigate whether the four amino-acid insertion in 
HA also increases H7N9 virus virulence in mammals, we 
tested the replication and virulence of virus with this HA 
insertion in mice and ferrets.
Three 6-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated i.n. 
with 106.0 EID50 of CK/SD008 and then killed 3 days p.i. 
Their nasal turbinates, lungs, spleens, kidneys, and brains 
were collected for virus titration. The 50% mouse lethal 
dose (MLD50) of the virus was determined by inoculating 
groups of five mice i.n. with 10
1.0-10
7.0 EID50 of the vi-
rus, and daily monitoring of body weight, disease signs, 
and death for 2 weeks. Virus replication was detected

in the nasal turbinates and lungs of mice but not in their 
spleens, kidneys, or brains (Figure 2C). No disease signs 
or deaths were observed among mice inoculated with any 
dose of the virus, and all mice gained weight during the 
observation period (Figure 2D). Therefore, the MLD50 of 
CK/SD008 is > 7.5log10EID50 (Figure 2G). 
Replication and transmission of the CK/SD008 virus in 
ferrets
To evaluate viral replication in ferrets, we inoculated 
two ferrets i.n. with 10
6.0 EID50 of CK/SD008. Nasal tur-
binates, tonsils, trachea, lungs, spleen, kidneys, and brain 
were collected on day 4 p.i. for virus titration in eggs. 
Unlike the 2013 H7N9 avian viruses that only replicated 
in the tonsils and respiratory tracts of ferrets [16], CK/
SD008 was detected in the tonsils throughout the lungs, 
and in the brains of the two ferrets, but not in the spleens 
or kidneys (Figure 3A). 
We then evaluated the transmission of CK/SD008 in 
ferrets, a commonly used animal model for transmis-
sion studies [6, 7, 16, 28]. We used the H7N9 virus CK/
S1053, which did not transmit in our previous study [16], 
as a negative control. Groups of three ferrets were i.n. 
inoculated with 106 EID50 of CK/S1053 and CK/SD008, 
respectively. The ferrets were housed separately in cages 
within an isolator. Twenty-four hours later, three naive 
ferrets were placed in adjacent cages. Each pair of ani-
mals was separated by a divider as described previously 
[9, 16, 42, 43]. Nasal washes were collected every 2 
days from all of the animals beginning 2 days p.i. (1 day 
post-exposure (p.e.)) to assess virus shedding. Sera were 
collected from all animals on day 14 p.i. for hemaggluti-
nin inhibition (HI) antibody detection. Respiratory drop-
let transmission was confirmed when virus was detected 
in the nasal washes and by seroconversion of the naive

period.
Virus was detected in all directly infected ferrets (Fig-
ure 3D, 3E). A low virus titer was detected on day 9 p.e. 
from one of the three ferrets that was exposed to the CK/
SD008-infected ferrets (Figure 3E); no virus was detect-
ed from any ferrets exposed to the CK/S1053-infected 
ferrets (Figure 3D). Ferrets exposed or infected with CK/
SD008 experienced a 1.9%-8.2% weight loss, whereas 
ferrets directly infected with CK/S1053 showed a 4.0%-
4.6% weight loss (Figure 3I, 3J; Table 2). Body tem-
perature increases were detected in two ferrets of each 
directly infected group (Supplementary information, 
Figure S5). Seroconversion occurred in all of the animals 
directly infected with virus, and in one exposed animal 
in the CK/SD008 group (Table 2). Similar to our findings 
in 2013 [16], these results indicate that CK/SD008 trans-
mits in ferrets by respiratory droplet with low efficiency.

viruses in mammals [22-27]. We previously showed that

to H7N9 viruses, readily acquire the PB2 627K or PB2

701N mutation upon infection of ferrets [42]. The CK/
SD008 virus does not contain either of these two PB2 
mutations. To investigate whether these mutations oc-
curred in CK/SD008 during its replication in ferrets, we 
sequenced the PB2 gene of the viruses recovered from 
the organs of ferrets on day 4 p.i. and from the nasal 
washes of ferrets that participated in the transmission 
study. We found viruses bearing PB2 627K and viruses 
bearing PB2 701N in the organs (Supplementary infor-
mation, Table S2) and nasal washes of ferrets that were 
directly infected in the transmission study (Supplementary 
information, Table S3). The virus in the nasal washes of 
the exposed animals contained only the PB2 627K muta-
tion (Supplementary information, Table S3). 
The PB2 627K and 701N mutations were not detected 
in any of the H7N9 viruses isolated from poultry (Table 
1); however, about 83% of 648 H7N9 viruses isolated 
from humans contain PB2 627K or PB2 701N (Table 1), 
indicating that the H7N9 viruses could easily obtain these 
mutations during their replication in humans. To assess 
the risk of a CK/SD008-like virus obtaining such muta-
tions after replicating in humans, we purified the mutants 
from the ferret lung samples by limited dilution in eggs. 
Two viruses were confirmed by genome sequence anal-
ysis to each contain one of the two PB2 mutations (CK/
SD008-PB2/627K and CK/SD008-PB2/701N) and were 
then used for further studies in mice and ferrets.
As observed in other influenza viruses [44], the PB2 
627K and 701N mutations also significantly increased 
the viral polymerase activity of the CK/SD008 virus

G186V, and Q226L, which play key roles in H7 avian 
influenza virus binding to human-type receptors [18], 
appeared in over 90% of the H7N9 avian influenza field 
viruses we isolated in this study (Table 1). We tested the 
receptor-binding properties of the CK/SD008 and two 
viruses that were isolated in 2013, CK/S1053 and AH/1, 
which all bear HA 186V and 226L, and found that they 
all bound to the α2, 6-siaylglycopolymer (human-type 
receptor) with higher affinity than that of their binding 
with the α2, 3-siaylglycopolymer (avian-type receptor) 
(Figure 4).
Thermal stability of H7N9 viruses
Thermal stability is also reported to be important for 
the transmissibility of some highly pathogenic H5N1 
laboratory-adapted viruses [6]. We therefore compared 
the thermal stability of seven influenza viruses, including 
the five H7N9 viruses we used in the transmission study, 
a 2016 H7N9 avian virus, an H5N1 avian influenza vi-
rus, with the 2009 H1N1 human pandemic virus (SC/1), 
using the method described by Imai et al. [6]. We found 
that the two 2013 H7N9 viruses CK/S1053 and AH/1 
were less stable than the human virus SC/1, but the CK/
SD008 virus and its PB2 mutants, as well as the 2016 
H7N9 virus and the H5N1 virus, were comparable to 
or more thermal stable than the human pandemic virus 
SC/1(Supplementary information, Figure S6). 
Discussion
Influenza viruses mutate; it is their nature. The most 
undesirable mutations are the ones that convert a low 
pathogenic avian influenza virus to a highly pathogenic 
avian influenza virus and the ones that allow a new influ-
enza virus to be transmissible in humans. In this study, 
we show that these alarming mutations are occurring 
in the H7N9 viruses. Our findings provide important 
information for the control of H7N9 influenza. As soon 
as we detected the highly pathogenic H7N9 mutants in 
chickens, a series of actions were taken to prevent and 
minimize the damage they could cause to both poultry 
and humans, including the establishment of a rapid dif-
ferential diagnostic test [45], urgent surveillance in poul-
try, careful analysis of samples from human patients, and 
evaluation of a poultry vaccine.
Virulence and transmission of influenza viruses are 
polygenic traits. The MLD50 of CK/SD008-PB2/627K was 
(Supplementary information, Figure S4). The viral titers 
of CK/SD008-PB2/627K and CK/SD008-PB2/701N 
in the nasal turbinates and lungs of mice were signifi-
cantly higher than those of mice inoculated with CK/
SD008. CK/SD008-PB2/627K was also detected in the 
brains of all three mice, and in the spleen and kidneys 
of one mouse (Figure 2C). Both viruses caused severe 
disease and killed mice at low doses (MLD50 values of 
CK/SD008-PB2/627K and CK/SD008-PB2/701N were 
1.8log10EID50 and 3.4log10EID50, respectively) (Figure 
2E, 2F, 2H, 2I). 
Replication, virulence, and transmission of CK/SD008 
PB2 mutants in ferrets
We next evaluated the replication of the two viruses in 
ferrets. The tissue tropism and viral titers in the organs of 
ferrets inoculated with CK/SD008-PB2/627K and CK/
SD008-PB2/701N were comparable with those of the 
ferrets inoculated with CK/SD008 (Figure 3). We then 
investigated the respiratory droplet transmission of CK/
SD008-PB2/627K and CK/SD008-PB2/701N in fer-
rets. In the directly infected groups, virus was detected 
from all animals; in the CK/SD008-PB2/627K-exposed 
group, virus was detected in one ferret on day 1 p.e. and 
in all three animals on the other days tested (Figure 3F); 
in the CK/SD008-PB2/701N-exposed group, virus was 
detected in one ferret on days 3 and 5 p.e. and in two 
ferrets on day 7 and 9 p.e. (Figure 3G). One ferret infect-
ed with CK/SD008-PB2/627K had a body temperature 
increase on day 7 p.i., but no marked body temperature 
change was detected in the CK/SD008-PB2/701N-in-
fected ferrets (Supplementary information, Figure S5). 
The ferrets directly infected with virus lost 11.3%-
28.9% of their body weight (Figure 3K, 3L). One CK/
SD008-PB2/627K-inoculated ferret was killed because 
it showed signs of severe disease, including tremor and 
torticollis, and became paralyzed on day 10 p.i.; one 
CK/SD008-PB2/701N-inoculated ferret became very 
sick and died on day 10 p.i. (Table 2). Seroconversion 
occurred in all of the inoculated animals and exposed an-
imals (Table 2). 
We repeated the ferret transmission study of the CK/
SD008-PB2/627K virus, along with CK/S1053 and A/
Anhui/1/2013 (AH/1) as negative and positive con-
trols, respectively. Transmission of CK/S1053 was not 
detected, but CK/SD008-PB2/627K and AH/1 were 
transmitted to all three animals. Moreover, one CK/
SD008-PB2/627K-inoculated ferret lost 26.9% of its 
body weight and died on day 8 p.i. (Figure 3D, 3F, 3H; 
Table 2). These results indicate that the newly emerged 
chicken-lethal H7N9 virus became highly lethal in mice 
and efficiently transmissible in ferrets after obtaining the

mers containing either α2,6-siaylglycopolymer or α2,3-siaylglycopolymer.
1.8log10EID50, indicating that this virus was > 10
5-fold 
more lethal than CK/SD008 (MLD50, > 7.5log10EID50), 
and > 10
3-fold more lethal than the 2013 H7N9 human 
isolates bearing the PB2 627K mutation, whose MLD50s 
were > 5.4log10EID50 [16]. Therefore, the high virulence 
in mice of CK/SD008-PB2/627K represents genetic 
changes in both the PB2 and HA genes. 
The virulence in mammals of these H7N9 PB2 mu-
tants is similar to that of H5N1 highly pathogenic viruses 
that caused an ~ 60% mortality rate in infected humans 
[46-48], and is over 20% higher than that caused by the 
current low pathogenic H7N9 viruses in humans. Pre-
vious studies suggested that H5N1 mutants that were 
transmissible in ferrets were attenuated in mammals 
relative to their wild-type parent viruses, with the loss 
of virulence being the tradeoff for transmissibility [6, 7]. 
We previously reported that, after replication in humans, 
low pathogenic H7N9 viruses could become transmis-
sible in ferrets, but the viruses were not highly lethal in 
mice or ferrets [16]. In this study, we found that after the 
new H7N9 chicken-lethal virus acquired the PB2 627K 
or 701N mutation, it not only became highly transmissi-
ble in ferrets, but also became highly lethal in mice and 
caused severe disease and death in ferrets. Given that 
over 83% of the low pathogenic H7N9 viruses have ob-
tained the PB2 mutations during their replication in hu-
mans (Table 1), it is highly likely that the chicken-lethal 
H7N9 virus will obtain similar mutations in their PB2 
when they replicate in humans. Thus, it is very import-
ant to carefully monitor and evaluate the H7N9 human 
isolates to prevent such a virus from transmitting among 
humans by aerosol.
After we detected the chicken-lethal H7N9 viruses, 
we performed vital surveillance, collecting 2 950 sam-
ples from chicken farms and live poultry markets in 
Guangdong province in February, 2017. We isolated 28 
H7N9 viruses (Supplementary information, Table S4), 
and partial sequence analysis of their HA genes revealed 
that 15 of them had the HA insertion (Supplementary 
information, Table S5). In addition to this insertion, 
we detected three additional motifs in the HA cleavage 
site of these viruses (Supplementary information, Table 
S5). The viruses with all of the other three different HA 
cleavage motifs were also lethal in chickens (Supplemen-
tary information, Table S5), although their virulence in 
mammals remains to be investigated. One of the motifs, 
-PKRKRTAR/G-, was found in isolates from patients in 
Guangdong province (Supplementary information, Table 
S5). The PB2 627K mutation was also detected in these 
human isolates (Supplementary information, Table S5). 
We compared the thermal stability of different avian 
influenza viruses with the 2009 human pandemic H1N1 
virus SC/1, and found that the naturally isolated duck 
H5N1 virus, the recent low and highly pathogenic H7N9

viruses, and the H7N9 PB2 mutants were all more ther-
mally stable than the H1N1 pandemic virus. If thermal 
stability is important for influenza virus transmission, as 
reported by Imai et al. [6], our results indicate that some 
of the H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses circulat-
ing in nature have already acquired this quality. The two 
H7N9 PB2 mutants are more thermally stable than the 
parent CK/SD008 virus, suggesting that similar to other 
properties of influenza virus, thermal stability may be a 
polygenic trait that is determined by a gene constellation 
rather than by the HA gene alone. 
While this manuscript was in preparation, the H7N9 
highly pathogenic virus has spread from Guangdong to 
several other provinces and caused huge outbreaks, and 
millions of chickens have been killed in efforts to control 
the disease [49]. It should be noted that, slaughtering the 
lethal H7N9 virus-infected poultry alone cannot solve 
this problem, because the broadly circulating low patho-
genic H7N9 viruses can mutate to the highly pathogenic 
form at any time. Therefore, given the damage the H7N9 
lethal virus will cause to poultry and the high risk it pos-
es to human health, control and eradication of both the 
low and highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses should be the 
highest priority for animal disease control authorities in 
China.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statements
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recom-
mendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory An-
imals of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s 
Republic of China. The protocols were approved by the Commit-
tee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Harbin Veterinary 
Research Institute (HVRI) of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural 
Sciences (CAAS).
Biosafety statement and facility
All experiments with live H7N9 viruses were conducted with-
in the enhanced animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3+) facility in 
the HVRI of the CAAS approved for such use by the Ministry of 
Agriculture of China. All animal studies were approved by the 
Review Board of the HVRI, CAAS. The details of the facility and 
the biosafety and biosecurity measures used have been previously 
reported [9].
Sample collection and virus isolation
From July 2013 to January 2017, 112 593 samples, including 
environment, cloacal, and tracheal swab samples of birds (cloacal 
and tracheal swabs of the same bird were put in the same sam-
ple collection tube and counted as one sample) from live poultry 
markets, poultry farms, poultry slaughterhouses, as well as faeces 
from wild bird habitats were collected in 24 provinces in China 
(Supplementary information, Table S1). Each sample was placed 
in 2 ml of minimal essential medium supplemented with penicillin 
(2 000 U/ml) and streptomycin (2 000 U/ml). All of the individual 
samples were inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated chicken 
eggs for 48 h at 37 °C. The allantoic fluid was collected and tested 
for HA activity with 0.5% chicken red blood cells. Where the HA 
assay was positive, HI assays were performed by using antisera 
against the 16 HA subtypes of avian influenza viruses and New-
castle disease virus (NDV), another avian virus frequently isolated 
from avian species. NA subtypes were determined by direct se-
quencing. 
Genetic and phylogenetic analysis
Viral RNA of H7N9 viruses was extracted from virus-infect-
ed allantoic fluid with the QIAmp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, 
Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR was performed with a set of gene-spe-
cific primers and the products were sequenced on an Applied 
Biosystems DNA analyzer. Primer sequences are available upon 
request. The nucleotide sequences were edited using the Seqman 
module of the DNAStar package. We performed the phylogenetic 
analysis using the Mega 6.0.6 ClustalW software package, im-
plementing the neighbor-joining method. The tree topology was 
evaluated by 1 000 bootstrap analyses; 97% sequence identity cut-
offs were used to categorize the groups of each gene segment in 
the phylogenetic trees. 
We also created a Bayesian time-resolved phylogenetic tree for 
the HA gene of the group 1 and group 2 viruses using BEAST 1.8.4. 
The SRD06 nucleotide substitution model, the uncorrelated re-
laxed clock with a log-normal distribution, and the skygrid flexible 
effective population size tree prior were selected for the analysis. 
A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain was run. The chain 
consisted of 30 000 000 steps and was sampled every 3 000 steps; 
the first 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in. The above 
MCMC settings were chosen to achieve a post burn-in effective 
sample size of at least 200 in all parameters, as recommended by 
the BEAST program [50]. The data were evaluated by using AICM 
in Tracer 1.6. The tree was viewed in Figtree 1.4.3.
Animal studies
Randomization and blinding were not used for the allocation of 
animals to experimental groups. 
Chicken study
To determine the pathogenicity of the viruses, the IVPI was 
determined according to the recommendations of the Office In-
ternational Des Epizooties [38]. Groups of ten 6-week-old SPF 
White Leghorn chickens housed in isolator cages were inoculated 
intravenously (i.v.) with 0.1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of bacterium-free 
allantoic fluid containing virus and were observed for signs of 
disease or death for 10 days. The organs, including brains, lungs, 
kidneys, spleens, pancreas, heart, liver, and cecum, of three dead 
birds inoculated with the index virus CK/SD008 were collected for 
virus titration in eggs.
Thirteen chickens were also inoculated i.n. with 10
6 EID50 of 
CK/SD008 virus in a 0.1 ml volume, and three chickens were 
killed on day 3 p.i., and their tracheal and cloacal swabs, organs, 
including brains, lungs, kidneys, spleens, pancreas, heart, liver, 
and cecum were collected for virus titration in eggs. The remain-
ing 10 birds and the negative control birds were observed for signs 
of disease or death for 10 days.

Mouse study
To determine MLD50 values, groups of five mice (Vital River 
Laboratories, Beijing, China) were lightly anesthetized with CO2 
and inoculated intranasally with 10-fold serial dilutions containing 
10
1-10
7 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) of CK/SD008 or 10
1-10
6 
EID50 of CK/SD008-PB2/627K and CK/SD008-PB2/701N in a 
volume of 50 µl. The mice were monitored for 14 days for weight 
loss and mortality. To assess virus replication, groups of three 
mice were lightly anesthetized with CO2 and inoculated intranasal-
ly with 10
6 EID50 of the test virus in a volume of 50 µl, and were 
then euthanized on day 3 p.i.; their nasal turbinates, lungs, spleens, 
kidneys, and brains were collected and titrated for virus infectivity 
in eggs.
Ferret study
Four-month-old female ferrets (Wuxi Cay Ferret Farm, Jiangsu, 
China) that were serologically negative for influenza viruses were 
used in these studies. The animals were anesthetized via intramus-
cular injection with ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (1 mg/kg). 
To investigate virus replication, groups of two ferrets were anes-
thetized and inoculated i.n. with 10
6 EID50 of test virus in a 500 l 
volume (250 µl per nostril). The ferrets were killed on day 4 p.i 
and the nasal turbinates, tonsils, trachea, lung, spleen, kidneys, and 
brain were collected for virus titration in eggs. 
For the respiratory droplet transmission studies, groups of three 
ferrets were inoculated i.n. with 10
6 EID50 of test virus and housed 
in specially designed cages inside an isolator as reported previ-
ously [9, 16]. Twenty-four hours later, three naive animals were 
placed in an adjacent cage (4 cm away), separated by a double-lay-
ered net divider. These cages allow free passage of air. Nasal 
washes were collected at 2-day intervals, beginning on day 2 p.i. (1 
day post exposure) and titrated in eggs. Sera were collected from 
all animals on day 14 p.i. for HI antibody detection. The ambient 
conditions for these studies were set at 20-22 °C and 30%-40% 
relative humidity. The airflow in the isolator was horizontal with 
a speed of 0.1 m/s; the airflow direction was from the inoculated 
animals to the exposed animals. 
Receptor-binding analysis
Receptor specificity was analysed by use of a solid-phase direct 
binding assay with two different glycopolymers: α-2, 3-siaylgly-
copolymer [Neu5Acα2-3Galß1-4GlcNAcß1-pAP (para-amino-
phenyl)-alpha-polyglutamic acid (α-PGA)] (avian-type receptor) 
and α-2, 6-sialylglycopolymer [Neu5Acα2-6Galß1-4GlcNAcß1-
pAP (para-aminophenyl)-alpha-polyglutamic acid (a-PGA)] (hu-
man-type receptor) as described previously [9]. Chicken antisera 
against CK/S1053 virus, A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) virus, and A/
chicken/Hebei/3/2013(H5N2) virus were generated in SPF chick-
ens in our laboratory, and the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-con-
jugated goat-anti-chicken antibody was purchased from Sigma-Al-
drich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 
Heat stability test
Viruses (128 HA units in PBS) were incubated for the times 
indicated at 50 °C. Hemagglutination activity was then determined 
by use of hemagglutination assays using 0.5% chicken red blood 
cells, and infectivity was determined in 10-day-old chicken em-
bryos.
Polymerase activity analysis
A dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used 
to compare the polymerase activities. Briefly, 0.5 µg of the firefly 
luciferase reporter plasmid p-Luci and the internal control plas-
mid Renilla were transfected into 293T cells together with 0.5 µg 
each of the four protein expression plasmids pCAGGS-PB2 (or 
pCAGGS-PB2/627K or pCAGGS-PB2/701N), pCAGGS-PB1, 
pCAGGS-PA, and pCAGGS-NP from the CK/SD008 virus. The 
assay was performed at 33 and 37 °C. Cell lysates were analysed 
24 h after transfection to measure firefly and Renilla luciferase 
activities. Luminescence of the firefly luciferase was standardized 
using a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase. Values shown are 
the mean ± SD of three independent experiments and are com-
pared to those obtained with CK/SD008. The 293T cells purchased 
from ATCC have been tested to be mycoplasma negative by the 
commonly used PCR method.
Statistical analysis
Virus titres of mice were statistically analysed by one-tailed 
paired t-test. The polymerase activity values were statistically ana-
lysed by two-tailed paired t-test.
