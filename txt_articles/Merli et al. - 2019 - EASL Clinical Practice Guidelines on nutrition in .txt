 EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on nutrition
in chronic liver diseaseq
European Association for the Study of the Liver*
Summary
A frequent complication in liver cirrhosis is malnutrition, which
is associated with the progression of liver failure, and with a
higher
rate
of complications
including
infections,
hepatic
encephalopathy and ascites. In recent years, the rising preva-
lence of obesity has led to an increase in the number of cirrhosis
cases related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Malnutrition,
obesity and sarcopenic obesity may worsen the prognosis of
patients with liver cirrhosis and lower their survival. Nutritional
monitoring and intervention is therefore crucial in chronic liver
disease. These Clinical Practice Guidelines review the present
knowledge in the field of nutrition in chronic liver disease and
promote further research on this topic. Screening, assessment
and principles of nutritional management are examined, with
recommendations provided in specific settings such as hepatic
encephalopathy, cirrhotic patients with bone disease, patients
undergoing liver surgery or transplantation and critically ill cir-
rhotic patients.

Introduction
Malnutrition is frequently a burden in patients with liver cirrho-
sis, occurring in 20–50% of patients. The progression of malnutri-
tion is associated with that of liver failure. While malnutrition
may be less evident in patients with compensated cirrhosis it
is easily recognisable in those with decompensated cirrhosis.
Malnutrition has been reported in 20% of patients with compen-
sated cirrhosis and in more than 50% of patients with decompen-
sated liver disease.1 Both adipose tissue and muscle tissue can be
depleted; female patients more frequently develop a depletion
in fat deposits while males more rapidly lose muscle tissue.2,1
As detailed in these clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), mal-
nutrition and muscle mass loss (sarcopenia), which has often
been used as an equivalent of severe malnutrition,3 are associ-
ated with a higher rate of complications4 such as susceptibility
to infections,5 hepatic encephalopathy (HE)6 and ascites, 4 as
well as being independent predictors of lower survival in cirrho-
sis7,8 and in patients undergoing liver transplantation.9 Given
these observations, malnutrition and sarcopenia should be
recognised as complications of cirrhosis, which in turn worsen
the prognosis of cirrhotic patients.
Whether malnutrition can be reversed in cirrhotic patients is
controversial. Although there is general agreement about the
need to improve the dietary intake of these patients, by avoiding
limitations and restrictions that are not evidence based, amelio-
ration of the nutritional status and muscle mass is not always
achievable.10–12
Although the term ‘‘malnutrition” refers both to deficiencies
and to excesses in nutritional status, in the present CPGs ‘‘mal-
nutrition” refers to ‘‘undernutrition”. More recently, in addition
to
undernutrition,
overweight
or
obesity
are
increasingly
observed in cirrhotic patients because of the increasing number
of
cirrhosis
cases
related
to
non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis
(NASH). Muscle mass depletion may also occur in these
patients, but due to the coexistence of obesity, sarcopenia might
be overlooked. Obesity and sarcopenic obesity may worsen the
prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis.13–15,3
No previous guidelines released by the European Association
for the Study of Liver Disease (EASL) have dealt with nutrition in
advanced liver disease and/or have evaluated the relationship
between nutritional status and the clinical outcome of patients.
Therefore, the EASL Governing Board has asked a panel of
experts in the field of nutrition and hepatology to produce the
present CPGs.
Methodology
The panel initially established the most relevant questions to
answer, considering relevance, urgency and completeness of
the topics to be covered. The main questions addressed were:
How can nutritional problems be recognised? In which condi-
tions are nutritional assessments recommended? What are the
available methods of evaluation? What are the consequences
of malnutrition and its correction? Different clinical scenarios
have been considered with special attention paid to nutrition
in HE and before and after liver transplantation. A section
devoted to bone metabolism in chronic liver disease has also
been included. Each expert took responsibility and made pro-
posals for statements for a specific section of the guideline.
The literature search was performed in different databases
(PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus) and a list of perti-
nent articles was derived from this ‘‘first line” search The initial
key words were: ‘‘Nutrition” OR ‘‘Nutritional status” OR ‘‘Mal-
nutrition” OR ‘‘Sarcopenia” AND ‘‘Liver cirrhosis” OR ‘‘Chronic
liver Disease”. Further, more specific key words were also uti-
lised:
‘‘nutritional
assessment”,
‘‘nutrition
risk”,
‘‘hepatic

 encephalopathy”, ‘‘osteoporosis”, ‘‘liver transplantation” for
each specific topic of the guideline. The selection of references
was then based on appropriateness of study design, number of
patients, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Original
data were prioritised. The resulting literature database was
made available to all members of the panel.
All recommendations were discussed and approved by all
participants. The Committee met on two occasions during inter-
national meetings with experts who were available to partici-
pate, two ad hoc teleconferences also took place for discussion
and voting.
The evidence and recommendations in these guidelines have
been graded according to the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.16
The classifications and recommendations are therefore based
on three categories: the source of evidence in levels I through
III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate
(B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendations
classified as strong (1) or weak (2) (Table 1). All recommenda-
tions based on expert opinion because of the lack of available
data
were
graded
as
III.
The
recommendations
were
peer-reviewed by external expert reviewers and approved by
the EASL Governing Board.
These guidelines are directed at consultant hepatologists,
specialists in training, and general practitioners and refer specif-
ically to adult patients with cirrhosis. Their purpose is to pro-
vide guidance on the best available evidence to deal with
nutritional problems in patients with chronic liver disease. A
few schemes were produced by the panel and are included in
these guidelines to help with the management of nutritional
problems in patients with liver cirrhosis.
For clarity, the terms and definitions used in the present
CPGs are summarised (Box 1).
Screening and assessment for malnutrition and
obesity in liver cirrhosis: Who, when and how
Given the worse prognosis associated with malnutrition, all
patients with advanced chronic liver disease, and in particular
patients with decompensated cirrhosis are advised to undergo
a rapid nutritional screen. Those at risk of malnutrition should
complete a more detailed nutritional assessment to confirm

 the presence and severity of malnutrition,17–19 in order to
actively manage this complication.
Nutrition screening tools
Two simple criteria stratify patients at high risk of malnutrition:
being underweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) (kg.body
weight [BW]/[height in meters]2) < 18.5 kg/m2,20 in which the
vast majority of cirrhotic patients have sarcopenia, and having
advanced decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C patients).17,21
There are several possible scoring tools to classify patients
who are at risk of malnutrition. Most have not been validated
in cirrhotic patients, and are prone to bias in cases of fluid reten-
tion, which should be accounted for. There are two liver disease-
specific tools, however, both need further validation. The Royal
Free Hospital-nutritional prioritizing tool (RFH-NPT) score was
reported to correlate with clinical deterioration, severity of dis-
ease (Child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease
[MELD] score), and clinical complications such as ascites, hepa-
torenal syndrome, and episodes of HE.22 Furthermore, improve-
ment
in
RFH-NPT
score
was
associated
with
improved
survival.22 This scheme takes less than 3 mins to be completed
and can be used by non-specialist staff. The liver disease under-
nutrition screening tool is based on six patient-directed ques-
tions regarding: nutrient intake, weight loss, subcutaneous fat
loss, muscle mass loss, fluid accumulation and decline in func-
tional status. However, it relies almost completely on the
patient’s subjective judgment and has low negative predictive
value.23 If the initial screening using these tools is negative, it
is recommended that the evaluation be repeated over time.
Detailed nutritional assessment
It is advisable that patients who are at risk of malnutrition dur-
ing screening undergo a detailed nutritional assessment for the
diagnosis of malnutrition, preferably by a registered dietitian or
nutrition expert. In patients with cirrhosis whose screening
results indicate a high risk of malnutrition, it is suggested that
each component be assessed and documented every 1–6
months in the outpatient setting and for inpatients, at admis-
sion and periodically throughout the hospital stay.17
The components of a detailed nutritional assessment include
evaluation of: muscle mass, global assessment tools and a
detailed dietary intake assessment, as described below.
Sarcopenia: How to assess
Sarcopenia is a major component of malnutrition. Direct quan-
tification of skeletal muscle mass requires cross-sectional imag-
ing.24 Computed tomographic (CT) image analysis at the L3
vertebra is almost universally recognised as a specific method
to quantify muscle loss. Psoas muscle and possibly para spinal
and abdominal wall muscles are considered core skeletal mus-
cles that are relatively independent of activity and water reten-
tion,
but
are
consistently
altered
by
the
metabolic
and
molecular perturbations of cirrhosis. Any of the several possible
image analysis software packages can be used to analyse the
total cross-sectional area (cm2) of abdominal skeletal muscles
at L3. This area is then normalised to height to calculate the
skeletal muscle index (cm2/m2). Even though magnetic reso-
nance imaging has also been suggested, data in patients with
liver cirrhosis are scarce and normal values are still required.
The routine use of CT imaging for nutritional assessment,
especially for repeated assessments, is obviously limited in clin-
ical practice, due to cost and exposure to radiation. However,
since CT scanning is frequently available in cirrhotic patients
(second line imaging for screening hepatocellular carcinoma,
evaluation for liver transplant, evaluation of vascular shunts
or portal thrombosis), it can be utilised at least once for assess-
ment of sarcopenia.
All measures require normal values that are based on age,
gender and ethnicity. In addition, there are gender differences
in the interpretation of muscle mass and function, indicating
lower predictive validity in women.21,25 Normal CT measures
and cut-off values to define sarcopenia were initially derived
from an oncologic population.26 Cut-off values derived from cir-
rhotic patients on the liver transplant list and based on clinical
outcomes have only recently been suggested (50 cm2/m2 for
men and 39 cm2/m2 for women),27 and still need to be further
validated. The predictive role of CT-assessed skeletal muscle
mass in liver transplant candidates was demonstrated in a
meta-analysis, showing an independent association between
low muscle mass and post-transplantation mortality (pooled
hazard ratios of sarcopenia 1.84, 95% CI 1.11–3.05), independent
of the MELD score.28
Body mass assessment can also be performed by simple bed-
side anthropometric methods29 including mid-arm muscle cir-
cumference (MAMC, defined as mid-arm circumference minus
[triceps skinfold (TSF) � 0.314]),30 mid-arm muscular area
[MAMA = (MAMC)2/4 � 0.314] and TSF, which are simple to
perform, rapid, low cost, and not affected by the presence of
fluid retention. Both MAMC and TSF have a demonstrated prog-
nostic value for mortality among cirrhotic patients, with MAMC
having a higher prognostic power than TSF.31 If performed by
trained personnel, these measurements have good intra and
inter-observer agreement (intra-class correlation of 0.8 and
0.9 for TSF and MAMC, respectively).32 Compared to the diagno-
sis of sarcopenia by cross-sectional imaging (by CT or magnetic
resonance), the predictive value of MAMC was shown to be
good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) of 0.75 for men and 0.84 for women.30 In a small
sample study, a significant but moderate correlation was
observed between CT measurement and MAMC in cirrhotic
men (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), but not in women.31 In addition, low
MAMC was found to be an independent predictor of mortality
after liver transplant,33 and in a large sample of the general pop-
ulation, but only among men.34

allows measurement of bone mineral density, fat mass and
fat-free mass. However, fat-free mass is not only skeletal muscle
mass. Radiation exposure, cost and logistics are additional lim-
itations, while water retention may limit the validity of the for-
mula applied to assess body composition. The ability to quantify
limb muscle mass, which could be more reliable and has corre-
sponding cut-offs in the healthy population, is an advantage and
may overcome the confounding effect of overhydration.
Tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) uses the
two-compartment model, and segmental BIA measurements
allow limb non-fat mass quantification. Low cost, portable
equipment and ease of use are advantages of BIA. However,
the validity of these methods also depends on stable hydration
status, which may be altered in patients with cirrhosis.35
Skeletal muscle contractile function is not a direct measure
of muscle mass but has been used as a measure of sarcopenia.
Handgrip strength is a simple, inexpensive, and effective
method to detect malnutrition in cirrhotic patients; predicting
incidence of major complications and mortality.36–38

 Measures of frailty, defined as patient’s vulnerability to
stress, decreased physiologic reserve and functional status
deficits39,40 can also be used in the assessment of cirrhotic
patients. There are several measures of frailty that are used in
geriatrics and were also demonstrated to have predictive value
in cirrhotic patients. The Fried frailty phenotype is characterised
by
five
domains:
unintentional
weight
loss,
self-reported
exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and
low physical activity.39 An increase in the Fried frailty score
was demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of liver
transplant waitlist mortality, even when adjusting for MELD.40
The short physical performance battery (SPPB) consists of timed
repeated chair stands, balance testing, and a timed 13-ft walk
and takes 2–3 mins to complete. Although the SPPB does not
correlate with CT-based muscle mass in men or women,38 it
predicts liver transplant waitlist mortality.38,40 At present, there
are no standardised or universally accepted criteria to diagnose
frailty in cirrhosis.
Global assessment tools in cirrhosis
The technique of subjective global assessment (SGA) uses data
collected during clinical evaluation to determine nutritional sta-
tus without recourse to objective measurements.32 Overall, SGA
has fair to good inter-observer reproducibility41 and is associ-
ated with various clinical and prognostic variables of liver trans-
plantation.42 However, agreement of SGA with other methods of
assessment of nutritional status (total lymphocyte count,
MAMC, MAMA, TSF, subscapular skinfold thickness, BMI and
handgrip measurement) is low (K <0.26).43 Furthermore, SGA
underestimates the prevalence of muscle loss in liver disease
patients, compared with other objective measures.36,44–47
The Royal Free Hospital-global assessment (RFH-GA),32 for
determining nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis is
reproducible, correlates with other measures of body composi-
tion
and
predicts
survival
and
post-transplant
complica-
tions.32,48,49 Patients are stratified into one of three categories
based on their dry weight-based BMI and their MAMC: ade-
quately nourished, moderately malnourished (or suspected to
be), or severely malnourished. The limitations of this tool
include the time required, and the need for trained personnel
for consistent results.
Reported dietary intake
Dietary interviews provide practical information for nutritional
interventions by identifying what and how much the patient is
willing and capable of eating and determining specific nutrient
deficiencies that need to be corrected. A detailed assessment of
dietary intake is suggested to include: food, fluids, supplements,
number of meals and their timing throughout the day (e.g. inter-
val between meals, breakfast and late-night meals as recom-
mended), as well as calories and quality and quantity of
protein intake. It should also include barriers to eating: nausea,
vomiting, aversion to certain foods, taste, low-sodium diet, early
satiety, gastrointestinal pain and diarrhoea or constipation. The
symptoms section of the abridged scored patient-generated
subjective global assessment (abPG-SGA) can be used to con-
struct the questions.50
Evaluation of dietary intake is time consuming, requires
skilled personnel and relies on patient recall and cooperation.
The best method that relies the least on patient recall is a
three-day food diary. However, it requires patients to cooperate
and follow detailed instructions, which may make it difficult to
implement in those with advanced disease. Therefore, repeated
24 h dietary recalls are also optional.51 The 24 h recall technique
requires short-term recall, is less burdensome, less likely to alter
eating behaviour than food diary, and can be used across diverse
populations because it does not require a high level of literacy.52
At a minimum, patients should be asked if their relative food
intake has changed and, if so, by how much (by half etc.) and
over what period of time (for example, as indicated in the
SGA – nutritional assessment tool).53
Obesity in cirrhosis: Assessment and interpretation
With the increasing prevalence of obesity and NASH-related cir-
rhosis, attention needs to be paid to obesity in patients with cir-
rhosis. Obesity does not rule out malnutrition. The combination
of loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose tissue is termed
sarcopenic obesity and is observed in a significant number of
patients with cirrhosis.14,54,55 Moreover, post-transplant obesity
and metabolic syndrome are common and weight gain after
transplantation is considered to be primarily due to an increase
in the adipose tissue, with concomitant loss in skeletal mus-
cle.55,56 Therefore, malnutrition needs to be estimated routinely
and treated in the obese cirrhotic patient. In clinical practice,
BMI is adequate to recognise obesity (defined as BMI equal or
greater than 30 kg/m2) in cirrhotic patients, in the absence of
fluid retention. In the case of fluid retention, BW needs to be
corrected by evaluating the patient’s dry weight, commonly
estimated by post-paracentesis BW or weight recorded before
fluid retention if available, or by subtracting a percentage of
weight based upon the severity of ascites (mild 5%; moderate
10%; severe 15%), with an additional 5% subtracted if bilateral
pedal oedema is present, as performed in several studies.21,30
This is still not validated but excellent inter-observer agreement
has been demonstrated. The dry-weight BMI is then calculated
by dividing the patient’s estimated dry weight (kg) by the
square of the patient’s height (m).
The proposed process for nutritional screening and assess-
ment in patients with chronic liver disease is summarised
(Fig. 1).
Recommendations
� Perform a rapid nutritional screen in all patients with
cirrhosis and complete a detailed assessment in those
at risk of malnutrition, to confirm the presence and
severity of malnutrition. (Grade II-2, B1)
� Assume
risk
for
malnutrition
to
be
high
if
BMI
<18.5 kg/m2 or Child-Pugh C. Utilise nutritional screen-
ing tools to assess the risk of malnutrition in all other
instances. (Grade II-2, B1)
� In the diagnosis of obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) always
consider the confounding effect of fluid retention and
estimate dry BW, even though the accuracy is low.
(Grade II-2, B2)
� Include an assessment of sarcopenia within the nutri-
tional assessment. (Grade II-2, B1)
� Whenever a CT scan has been performed, assess muscle
mass on images by this method. Anthropometry, DEXA
or BIA are possible alternatives, which also allow for
serial measurements. (Grade II-2, B1)

most appropriate tool, such as handgrip strength and/
or the short physical performance battery. (Grade II-2,

� Assess dietary intake by trained personnel (ideally a
dietician with knowledge of managing patients with
liver disease) working as part of a team with the hepatol-
ogist. Assessment should include: quality and quantity
of food and supplements, fluids, sodium in diet, number
and timing of meals during the day and barriers to eat-
ing. (Grade II-2, B1)
Nutritional management principles in patients with
liver cirrhosis
Since malnutrition and sarcopenia are independent predictors
of adverse clinical outcomes including survival57–59,17,60 any
nutritional approach in cirrhotic patients needs to be guided
by some general principles of nutritional management.
Energy and protein requirements in cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is a state of accelerated starvation demonstrated by a
rapid post absorptive physiology which is characterised by a
reduction in the respiratory quotient.61,62 The reduction in the
respiratory quotient is the manifestation of a metabolic switch
in the primary fuel from glucose to fatty acids. During this state
of accelerated starvation, protein synthesis is decreased and
gluconeogenesis from amino acids is increased, necessitating
proteolysis, which contributes to sarcopenia. Gluconeogenesis
is an energy-expensive procedure which may further increase
resting energy expenditure (REE) in these patients. Accelerated
starvation is aggravated by reduced dietary intake due to a vari-
ety of factors including dysgeusia, anorexia of chronic disease,
salt restricted food that is not tasty, portal hypertension that
contributes to impaired gut motility, decreased nutrient absorp-
tion and protein losing enteropathy.63–66 Additional factors that
result in decreased dietary intake include inappropriate dietary
protein restriction, hospitalisation with periods of fasting for
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, encephalopathy and
gastrointestinal bleeding.
Energy supply needs to balance total energy expenditure
(TEE), which includes REE, food-related thermogenesis and
energy expenditure related to physical activity. TEE is measured

accepted tools. A liver specific screening tool which takes into consideration fluid retention may be advisable (Royal Free Hospital Nutritional Prioritizing Tool
(RFH-NPT). Patients found to be at high risk of malnutrition should undergo a detailed nutritional assessment, and based on the findings they should receive
either supplementation or regular follow-up. yIn a case of fluid retention, body weight should be corrected by evaluating the patient’s dry weight by post-
paracentesis body weight or weight recorded before fluid retention if available, or by subtracting a percentage of weight based upon severity of ascites (mild,

 ideally with doubly labelled water or in a respiratory chamber,
but these methods are not feasible in the clinical setting. Phys-
ical activity is reduced in patients with decompensated cirrhosis
and negligible when patients are hospitalised. In cirrhotic
patients, TEE varies between 28 to 37.5 kcal/kg.BW/d.63,67–70
Some studies evaluated whether decompensated liver cirrhosis
affected REE. One small longitudinal study suggested that
ascites increases REE.71 However, a cross-sectional study found
no difference in REE between patients with varying levels of
liver disease severity and fluid retention.72–74 Measured REE
may be higher than predicted, a situation termed hyperme-
tabolism. However, hypermetabolism cannot be identified by
clinical or laboratory parameters,75 the severity and the aetiol-
ogy of liver cirrhosis and the presence of ascites.25 REE may
be estimated by predictive formulae but these are inaccurate
in advanced cirrhotic patients, and thus measurement by indi-
rect calorimetry is advisable whenever possible.61,62 The avail-
ability of the hand held calorimeter at the bedside is a
possible alternative to determine a patient’s daily caloric
needs.76
The approach of most nutritional intervention studies in liver
cirrhosis is to supply at least 35 kcal/kg.BW/d. The use of actual
BW, corrected for ascites (see previous section), is considered
safe. This can be achieved primarily by tailoring the oral dietary
intake, even though this goal is frequently difficult to accom-
plish. The role of a nutrition support team has recently been
underlined by a retrospective study showing that nutritional
intervention, led by a multidisciplinary team, and in which cir-
rhotic patients participated in teaching sessions about the rele-
vance of appropriate nutrition in chronic liver disease, was able
to improve survival rates and quality of life.77
Whether frequent feeding can help prevent accelerated star-
vation and the related proteolysis has also been extensively
evaluated. Since the longest inter-meal duration is at night,
strategies to shorten nocturnal fasting with a late evening snack
have been explored, achieving an improvement in metabolic
profile and quality of life, although muscle mass did not show
consistent improvement.78 The adoption of a breakfast contain-
ing some proteins79 and a late evening snack80 to shorten the
period of fasting are therefore recommended in cirrhotic
patients.
Protein needs are based on the minimum protein intake
required
to
maintain
nitrogen
balance.
In
alcoholic
cirrhosis, nitrogen balance was achieved with intakes of
0.8 g/kg.BW/d.81 This cut-off was confirmed in studies wherein
cirrhotic patients received diets with increasing protein con-
tent.70,82 These studies also showed that cirrhotic patients are
able to utilise up to 1.8 g/kg.BW/d of protein.70 In the past, there
has been controversy about whether patients suffering from HE
should undergo a transient restriction in protein intake, in order
to limit the synthesis of ammonium and the deamination of
protein to aromatic amino acids. However, normal to high pro-
tein intake does not precipitate HE83,84 and may even improve
mental status85,86 (see paragraph on hepatic encephalopathy).

diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is 1.2–1.5 g/kg.BW/d to prevent loss
of muscle mass and reverse muscle loss in those who are sar-
copenic. Indeed, sarcopenia, as previously stated, contributes
to worse clinical outcomes, independent of the severity of liver
disease.27,63 Options for the treatment of sarcopenia will be
discussed in the next section.
Short dietary advice for use when treating a cirrhotic patient
at bedside or during an outpatient visit is provided (Box 2).
Approach to sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis
Factors related with sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis
Skeletal muscle mass is the largest protein store in the body. A
balance between skeletal muscle protein synthesis and break-
down is responsible for protein homeostasis (or proteostasis)
that maintains skeletal muscle mass.66,87,88 In the past, whole
body protein turnover studies have yielded conflicting results
with unaltered, increased or decreased protein synthesis and
breakdown in cirrhosis.3,89 Skeletal muscle mass depends on a
number of physiological factors including age, gender and eth-
nicity. The severity and aetiology of liver disease also affects
muscle mass, with cholestatic and alcoholic liver disease lead-
ing to the most severe muscle loss independently of the severity
• Most of what you have heard/read on the relationship between food and the liver has limited scientific evidence to support it. Generally, healthy eating of a 
variety of foods is advisable for all patients. 
• Virtually no food other than alcohol actually damages the liver and/or is genuinely contraindicated in patients with chronic liver disease.
• In most patients with chronic liver disease, eating an adequate number of calories and protein is much more important than avoiding specific types of food, 
so it is important that you have a good, varied diet that you enjoy.
• You should try to split your food intake into 3 main meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and 3 snacks (mid-morning, mid-afternoon, late evening). The 
late-evening snack is the most important, as it covers the long interval between dinner and breakfast.
• You should try to eat as many fruit and vegetables as you can. If you feel that this makes you feel bloated, and that it makes you eat less, please report to 
your doctor or dietician.
• You should try not to add too much salt to your food. It may take some time to adjust, but it usually gets easier with time. However, if you keep feeling that 
this makes your food unpleasant to eat, and that it makes you eat less, please report to your doctor or dietician.
• A limited proportion of patents with liver disease have a complication called hepatic encephalopathy, which may make them tolerate animal protein (meat) 
less well than vegetable protein (beans, peas etc.) and dairy proteins. Before you make any changes to your protein intake, you should always ask your 
doctor or dietician. Please do not reduce your total protein intake as it is not advisable in cirrhosis.  
• Some patients with liver disease have other diseases, for example diabetes or overweight/obesity, which require dietary adjustments. Please remember to 
tell your doctor about all your illnesses and about any dietary advice you have already received from other doctors, nurses or dieticians.

 of the underlying liver disease, although data on alcoholic liver
disease are not consistent.66,90 Hepatocellular dysfunction and
portosystemic shunting also result in biochemical and hor-
monal perturbations in cirrhosis that contribute to sarcopenia.
Increased skeletal muscle ammonia, reduction in testos-
terone and growth hormone, endotoxemia, as well as decreased
dietary nutrient intake contribute to sarcopenia.89,91–93 In addi-
tion, amino acid perturbations, specifically reduction in the
branched chain amino acid, L-leucine, and consequent impaired
global protein synthesis has also been reported to contribute to
sarcopenia in cirrhosis.3,94–97
To better understand how to correct the progressive deple-
tion of muscle mass in cirrhotic patients, molecular mechanisms
of muscle wasting have recently been investigated (Fig. 2).
Molecular pathways that regulate skeletal muscle mass include
myostatin, a TGFb superfamily member that inhibits protein
synthesis and potentially increases proteolysis.88 Data in animal
models, humans and cellular systems have consistently shown
that myostatin expression is increased in cirrhosis.95,98,99 In
addition to impaired protein synthesis, proteolysis is also
required for loss of muscle mass.63,66 The ubiquitin proteasome
pathway and autophagy are currently believed to be the domi-
nant mechanisms of skeletal muscle proteolysis.63,100 Human
skeletal muscle from patients with cirrhosis and preclinical
models of hyperammonaemia show increased autophagy with
impaired
or
unaltered
proteasome-mediated
proteoly-
sis.95,100,101 A more extensive view of molecular mechanisms
of muscle wasting in patients with liver cirrhosis is reviewed
in Refs. 63,65.
Strategies to improve muscle mass in cirrhosis
A number of potential therapeutic strategies to improve muscle
mass in patients with cirrhosis have been evaluated. These
include dietary manipulations, increased physical activity and
exercise,3,102–104
hormone
replacement
therapies,
105
ammonia-lowering strategies and targeting the underlying liver
disease.106–109
Nutritional supplementation
It is advised that any nutritional interventions follow the gen-
eral recommendations reported as ‘‘energy and protein require-
ments in cirrhotic patients” (previous paragraph). However, an
adequate calorie and protein intake is difficult to achieve in
malnourished sarcopenic patients with advanced liver disease.
Oral nutritional supplement and branched chain amino acid
(BCAA) supplements have been utilised in clinical trials to over-
come this issue110,111 showing some benefits.
In patients with malnutrition and cirrhosis, who are unable
to achieve adequate dietary intake with the oral diet (even with
oral supplements), short-term enteral or parenteral nutrition
should be used to overcome the phase of underfeeding. Nutri-
tional guidelines proposed by international medical societies
for enteral and parenteral nutrition in patients with chronic
liver disease are reported (Table S1).
Enteral feeding has been utilised in malnourished cirrhotic
patients admitted to hospital, but despite promising individual
studies, systematic meta-analyses have not shown significant
benefits in terms of survival.11,12,112 There are also conflicting
data on the benefits of parenteral nutritional supplementation
in patients with cirrhosis, but this is likely to have a beneficial
role during prolonged periods of poor oral intake including
encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired gut
motility or ileus.113 The use of enteral and parenteral nutrition
in the perioperative setting is dealt with in a dedicated section.
There is limited but consistent data that supplemental nutri-
tion improves quality of life if it results in an increase in lean
body mass, even though direct studies on sarcopenia are cur-
rently unavailable.114
Exercise and physical activity
In addition to nutritional supplementation, increased physical
activity and exercise are also anabolic stimuli that can improve
muscle mass and function. However, consistent long-term
data
in
cirrhosis
are
lacking.87,115

 necessarily muscle mass.116 Resistance exercise promotes an
increase in skeletal muscle mass.116 However, exercise also
increases
muscle
ammonia
generation
and
portal
pres-
sure,117,118 both of which can have adverse effects in cirrhotic
patients. Despite these potential adverse responses, beneficial
effects have been reported.103,104 Since both muscle loss and
impaired contractile function are components of sarcopenia in
cirrhosis, a combination of resistance and endurance exercise
would probably be appropriate and beneficial, as confirmed by
emerging data indicating the benefit of a moderate intensity
exercise regimen in cirrhosis.104
Nutrient supplementation following physical activity is ben-
eficial in physiological states, but whether such an intervention
is beneficial in cirrhosis is currently unknown.119,120 Continued
impaired functional capacity and reduced peak oxygen con-
sumption are associated with decreased survival and poor
post-transplant outcomes.121,122 Hence measures to increase
functional capacity are likely to improve long-term clinical out-
comes in cirrhosis.102
Other strategies
Hormone replacement therapy utilising growth hormone or
testosterone has been proposed but has not been consistently
effective.91,92,123,124 Furthermore caution is needed when using
testosterone because of the possibility of increasing the risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma.105
A number of reports in preclinical models have shown that
hyperammonaemia results in impaired protein synthesis and
increased autophagy, both of which result in loss of muscle
mass.99,100
Long-term
ammonia-lowering
strategies
may
result
in
increased muscle mass and contractile strength but the data
are derived from preclinical studies and require validation in
human studies.109
Nutritional approach and management of obesity in
patients with liver cirrhosis
Two studies have shown that obesity is at least as frequent in
compensated cirrhosis as it is in the general population, ranging
from 20 to 35%,13,125 regardless of the origin of liver disease. In
NASH-related cirrhosis obesity is present in most cases. More-
over, a sedentary lifestyle is highly prevalent in patients with
cirrhosis and might be seen as a cofactor, leading to an increase
in BW in this population. In the HALT-C trial125 the risk of his-
tological progression or decompensation increased by 14% for
each increase in BMI quartile, and the risk of progression
increased by 35% in patients whose BW increased by >5% at
one year.
In a randomised controlled trial comparing the use of timolol
or placebo to prevent the onset of gastroesophageal varices, BMI
was associated with clinical decompensation, independently of
portal hypertension and albumin, in patients with no varices
and an hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥6 mmHg.13
Data from different studies suggest that a reduction in BW
improves outcomes in obese patients with compensated cirrho-
sis.102,125,126 This was achieved by a programme of lifestyle
intervention including nutritional therapy and supervised mod-
erate intensity physical exercise. A weight decrease ≥5–10% is
considered an adequate goal, associated with a reduced rate of
disease progression in patients included in the HALT-C trial.125
Dietary intake is aimed to guarantee both moderate caloric
restriction and adequate protein intake. Indeed, although good
quality data are lacking, particular attention must be paid to
the protein intake needed to maintain muscle mass, because
of the potential risk of exacerbating sarcopenia during weight
loss interventions.
No clear-cut data is available regarding the best type of phys-
ical exercise (aerobic vs. anaerobic; endurance vs. resistance/
strength training) and its duration in this population. In patients
with portal hypertension, avoidance of abdominal pressure
seems reasonable even though there is some data suggesting
that resistance exercise is probably safe.126 Exercise needs to
be tailored to the patient’s ability, beginning with moderate
intensity and maintained for the long-term.
Recommendations
� Nutritional counselling should be performed in cirrhotic
patients with malnutrition, when possible by a multidis-
ciplinary team, helping patients to achieve adequate
caloric and protein intake. (Grade II-2, C2)
� Optimal daily energy intake should not be lower than
the recommended 35 kcal/kg. actual BW/d (in non-
obese individuals). (Grade II-2, B1)
� Optimal daily protein intake should not be lower than
the recommended 1.2–1.5 g/kg. actual BW/d. (Grade
II-2, B1)
� Include late evening oral nutritional supplementation
and
breakfast
in
dietary
regimen
of
malnourished
decompensated cirrhotic patients. (Grade II-1, B1)
� BCAA supplements and leucine enriched amino acid sup-
plements should be considered in decompensated cir-
rhotic patients when adequate nitrogen intake is not
achieved by oral diet. (Grade II-1, C1)
� In patients with malnutrition and cirrhosis who are
unable to achieve adequate dietary intake with the oral
diet (even with oral supplements), a period of enteral
nutrition is recommended. (Grade II-1, B1)
� Patients
with
cirrhosis,
whenever
possible,
can
be
encouraged to avoid hypomobility and to progressively
increase physical activity to prevent and/or ameliorate
sarcopenia. (Grade II-1, C2)
� Implement a nutritional and lifestyle programme to
achieve progressive weight loss (>5–10%) in obese cir-
rhotic patients (BMI >30 kg/m2 corrected for water
retention). (Grade II-2, C1)
� A tailored, moderately hypocaloric (-500–800 kcal/d)
diet, including adequate protein intake (>1.5 g pro-
teins/kg.ideal BW/d) can be adopted to achieve weight
loss without compromising protein stores in obese cir-
rhotic patients. (Grade II-1, C2)
New research should address the following topics
1. Does the improvement in muscle mass and/or muscle func-
tion improve clinical outcomes (lower the risk of first decom-
pensation, ascites, infection and encephalopathy, reduce
hospital readmissions, decrease length of hospital stay,
reduce risk of falls, improve survival)?

Micronutrients
In general, vitamin deficiencies in liver disease are related to
hepatic dysfunction, diminished reserves and, with increasing
disease severity, inadequate dietary intake and malabsorption.
Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are common. A retrospective
study reported that the majority of liver disease patients being
considered for transplantation presented with vitamin A and D
deficiencies.127
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the general pop-
ulation ranges from 20 to 100% when referring to serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations <20 ng/ml, and
affects all age groups.128 In patients with chronic liver disease
vitamin
D
(25(OH)D)
levels
below
20 ng/ml
have
been
reported in between 64 and 92% of patients, predominantly
in chronic cholestatic conditions, and usually inversely corre-
lated with more advanced disease and Child-Pugh score.129,130
Although low vitamin D levels might, in part, be due to
decreased plasma binding proteins in the presence of liver
insufficiency, some evidence in pre-cirrhotic stages provide
support for a true nutritional deficit. Recent data suggest a
close correlation between vitamin D levels and response to
treatment in patients with hepatitis C virus infection, non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease and those who develop hepatocel-
lular carcinoma.130–132
Based on these data, it is advisable to assess plasma vitamin
D (25(OH)D) levels in all patients with chronic liver disease, par-
ticularly in those with advanced disease,128,130 non-alcoholic
fatty liver and cholestatic disorders.133 Although there are no
specific recommendations in patients with chronic liver disease
except for those with chronic cholestasis, it seems reasonable to
supplement all chronic liver disease patients with vitamin D
levels below 20 ng/ml with oral vitamin D until reaching a
serum vitamin D level above 30 ng/ml. Higher doses may be
necessary in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.134
Vitamin K deficiency should always be considered in patients
who are jaundiced or whose liver disease is cholestatic in origin,
and parenteral supplementation might be needed.
Patients with both alcohol and non-alcohol related cirrhosis
are prone to deficiencies in water-soluble vitamins, particularly
thiamine (B1). They often exhibit evidence at autopsy of
Wernicke’s encephalopathy, even in the absence of a history/
clinical signs during life.135 If Wernicke’s encephalopathy is sus-
pected,
generous
parenteral
thiamine
supplementation
is
mandatory. Deficiencies in pyridoxine (B6), folate (B9) and
cobalamin (B12) may also develop rapidly in chronic liver dis-
ease resulting from diminished hepatic storage.136 However,
good quality data on their prevalence and/or need for supple-
mentation are scarce. As vitamin status is not easily assessed
and multivitamin supplementation is cheap and substantially
side effect free, a course of oral multivitamin supplementation
could be justified in decompensated patients.
Hyponatraemia is common in patients with cirrhosis and is
more likely to occur when the intake of sodium is low, and that
of water unchanged or increased.137 Thus, careful monitoring of
both sodium and water intake is required. If severe hypona-
traemia is corrected, this needs to be done slowly, to avoid the
risk of central pontine myelinolysis.138 A reduction in dietary
sodium intake is recommended in patients with ascites,139
although evidence in this respect is limited and conflicting.140
Sodium intake should certainly not be reduced below 60
mmol/d, as this makes the diet unpalatable, potentially compro-
mising energy and protein intake.141 Reductions in circulating
levels of calcium, magnesium, and iron need to be considered
and corrected.142 Tissue zinc concentrations are reduced in
patients with cirrhosis and zinc has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of HE. However, data on the effects of zinc supple-
mentation on mental performance have been conflicting.143–145
Selenium deficiency has been related to the severity of hepatic
fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C and identified as one of the
factors contributing to insulin resistance in these patients.146
Patients with cirrhosis have elevated total body manganese
levels, which may result in selective manganese accumulation
in the basal ganglia.147 While there is no clear relationship
between such a phenomenon and HE, it is probably reasonable
to avoid nutritional supplements containing manganese.
Specific evidence about the beneficial effect of micronutri-
ents and vitamin supplementation in cirrhotic patients is not
available. However, confirmed or clinically suspected deficiency
should be treated based on accepted general recommendations
and common practice.
Recommendations
� In cirrhotic patients, administer micronutrients and vita-
mins to treat confirmed or clinically suspected defi-
ciency. (Grade II-1, C1)
� Assess vitamin D levels in cirrhotic patients, as defi-
ciency is highly prevalent and may adversely affect clin-
ical outcomes. (Grade II-3, B1)
� Supplement vitamin D orally in cirrhotic patients with
vitamin D levels <20 ng/ml, to reach serum vitamin D
(25(OH)D) >30 ng/ml. (Grade II-1, B1)
� In cirrhotic patients with ascites under sodium restric-
tion (recommended intake of sodium �80 mmol day =
2 g of sodium corresponding to 5 g of salt added daily
to the diet according to EASL guidelines) take care to
improve diet palatability as this regime may cause a
reduction in caloric intake. (Grade II-2, B1)

 Nutritional treatment options for hepatic
encephalopathy
The relationship between malnutrition and HE has been known
since the seminal observation that decreased energy intake
determines weight loss and coma in Eck’s fistula dogs.148
Human studies also support this association. HE occurs more
frequently in malnourished patients with cirrhosis, and there
is an inverse relationship between muscle mass and blood
ammonia levels.149,150 Sarcopenia, as assessed by the skeletal
muscle index, is an independent risk factor for the development
of HE after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt place-
ment.151
Muscle
plays
an
important
role
in
ammonia
removal152 by increasing glutamine synthesis, a reaction that
is catalysed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase.153 This has
generally been thought of as a straightforward, benign process
of ammonia disposal but evidence is accumulating that hyper-
ammonaemia may impair muscle function and contribute to
muscle loss,154 thus establishing a vicious circle. There is also
evidence that lowering ammonia levels can reverse sarcopenia
in animal models.155 Recently a randomised clinical trial
showed
that
nutritional
intervention
(30–35 kcal/kg.BW/d,
1.0–1.5 g vegetable protein/kg.BW/d for six months) was able
to improve neuropsychiatric performance in patients with min-
imal HE, and decrease their risk of developing overt HE com-
pared to no nutritional intervention.114
Energy requirements in patients with cirrhosis and HE are
thought to be the same as those of patients with cirrhosis per
se.156 Patients with HE need to avoid long periods of fasting, and
should be encouraged to split their caloric and protein intake into
small, frequent meals. It is advisable that breakfast79 and a late
evening snack80 also include some proteins (see also paragraph:
Energy and protein requirements in patients with liver cirrhosis).
Dysregulated nitrogen metabolism plays a major role in the
development of HE and its modulation is key to HE manage-
ment. Up until the middle of the 20th century, meat protein
was
administered
to
patients
with
cirrhosis
to
avoid
catabolism.157 Then, a few uncontrolled studies showed that
decreased protein intake was associated with better mental sta-
tus in patients with HE and porto-systemic shunts,158 leading to
a widespread practice of chronic protein restriction.159 Protein
restriction is now considered detrimental, except perhaps, for
very short periods of time, in patients with severe overt HE
and gastrointestinal bleeding. There is sufficient evidence that,
in general, patients with HE tolerate diets with a normal protein
content,86 and their nitrogen requirements are the same as
those of patients with cirrhosis per se.160
The type of protein ingested may be important. The original
demonstration that Eck’s fistula dogs fed with fish/milk protein
rather than meat developed fewer/no behavioural abnormali-
ties161 led to the idea that patients with HE may benefit from
the replacement of meat with dairy/vegetable protein. Subse-
quent uncontrolled, human studies showed that dairy protein
is better tolerated than protein from mixed sources and that
vegetable protein is better tolerated than meat protein.83,162,163
While there is a good pathophysiological basis for the use of
dairy/vegetable diets in patients with HE, the results of the clin-
ical studies undertaken remain unconvincing.164 In addition,
concerns have been raised in relation to tolerability/palatability,
and thus potential negative effects on overall caloric intake.156
This is likely to depend on the features of the staple diet. Inter-
estingly, a 14-day casein-vegetable, high-protein, high-calorie
diet was shown to improve mental performance and to decrease
ammonia levels in 150 patients with overt HE.85 One of the
advantages of vegetable diets may be due to their fibre content
rather than protein content, as fibre has both prebiotic and lax-
ative properties. While increased dietary fibre may be of value
in patients with HE, the available literature is limited,165 and
increasing fibre consumption is difficult even in the healthy
population. Notably, support from a multidisciplinary nutrition
team has been shown to be useful in patients with cirrhosis77
and should be considered in patients with HE.
A decreased serum ratio of BCAA to aromatic amino acids has
been associated with a poor prognosis,166 but there is limited
evidence that the original assumptions behind BCAA supple-
mentation in HE are correct. However, BCAA supplements, in
daily divided doses, may facilitate the provision of an adequate
nitrogen intake in patients who are intolerant to meat pro-
tein.167,168 The replacement of meat with dairy/vegetable pro-
tein plus BCAA supplements is likely to be preferable to a
reduction in total protein intake. Long-term, oral BCAA supple-
mentation may also have nutritional value.110,169 Palatability
has proven to be a significant issue. In addition, costs and the
possibility to prescribe BCAA as a drug (vs. a food supplement)
vary considerably between countries.
It has also been shown that L-leucine alone can reverse the
decrease in disturbed muscle protein homeostasis (proteostasis)
due
to
hyperammonaemia.170
A
Cochrane
meta-analysis
included 16 randomised clinical trials, comparing oral or intra-
venous BCAA supplementation vs. a control intervention in 827
patients with HE.171 Oral BCAA had a positive impact on HE.
However, oral or intravenous BCAA did not influence mortality,
quality of life or nutritional status. No firm conclusions could be
reached on their nutritional effects and on how they compare
with non-absorbable disaccharides/antibiotics.172 Their use
intravenously for episodic overt HE is not supported by the
available evidence.
In patients with HE grade III-IV, as oral dietary intake is
unfeasible or impossible, in keeping with common practice in
patients with neurologic coma, nutrition should be provided
by nasogastric tube or parenterally.
Recommendations
� Nutritional status and the presence of sarcopenia should
be evaluated in patients with HE. (Grade II-3, B1)
� Avoid protein restriction in patients with HE. (Grade
II-1, A1)
� Optimal daily protein and energy intake should not be
lower than the general recommendations for cirrhotic
patients (recommendations 14 and 15). (Grade II-1, A1)
� Encourage the consumption of vegetables and dairy pro-
tein. (Grade II-3, B1)
� BCAA supplementation should be considered to improve
neuropsychiatric performance and to reach the recom-
mended nitrogen intake. (Grade I-1, A1)
� Oral dietary intake is preferred in patients who can tol-
erate it. In patients with grade III-IV encephalopathy,
who are unable to eat, provide nutrition by nasogastric
tube (in patients with protected airways) or parenterally.

 Nutritional treatment options in cirrhotic patients
with bone diseases
‘Hepatic osteodystrophy’, including osteoporosis and osteoma-
lacia, has been used for years to describe the bone disease of
patients with liver damage. Osteoporosis, characterised by loss
of bone mass and quality that leads to fragility fractures, is com-
mon in patients with chronic liver disease.173 Osteomalacia
resulting from poor bone mineralisation is uncommon and only
present when associated with persistent vitamin D deficiency in
individuals with severe and long-lasting cholestasis and intesti-
nal malabsorption.174 Nutritional, hormonal, metabolic, genetic,
and inflammatory factors play a significant role in the patho-
genesis of osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease,
mainly because of decreased bone formation.
The diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on bone mineral den-
sity (BMD) that is generally measured by DEXA. According to
World Health Organization, osteoporosis is considered when
BMD is 2.5 standard deviations below the young average value
(T-score ≤2.5) and osteopenia when the T-score is between �1
and �2.5, and severe or ‘established’ osteoporosis refers to indi-
viduals who meet densitometric criteria and have one or more
fragility fractures.175
Prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver dis-
ease depends mostly on patient selection and diagnostic crite-
ria. In summary, about 30% of patients have osteoporosis, with
higher prevalence in patients with cholestasis including pri-
mary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangi-
tis.176–188 In patients eligible for liver transplantation the
prevalence of osteoporosis is 30%.188–191 Fracture prevalence
ranges between 7% and 35%,176–188,192–198 being more frequent
in postmenopausal women than in young women and men,182
and in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy.199 Vertebral
fractures are associated with osteoporosis and osteopenia with
a T-score lower than �1.5 in patients with PBC and primary
sclerosing cholangitis.180. Patients with a T-score below �1.5
have a high risk of hip and vertebral fractures, supporting this
T-score as a practical guide for starting specific therapy.
Osteoporosis
is
frequently
observed
in
transplanted
patients,200 and associated with a high incidence of fractures
(25 to 35%) within the first year after liver transplanta-
tion.201,202 Improvements in the management of bone health
in
transplanted
patients
have
reduced
the
incidence
of
fractures.203
According to the WHO, bone densitometry of the lumbar
spine and hip is the gold standard procedure for the diagnosis
of osteoporosis and osteopenia. Lateral X-rays of dorsal and
lumbar spine should also be performed to disclose vertebral
fractures.204 Laboratory measurements to identify abnormal
calcium and vitamin D metabolism are also appropriate. The
biochemical markers of bone turnover can be determined, but
they are most helpful for monitoring the response to therapy.
Undecalcified transiliac bone biopsy is recommended only in
the exceptional cases with presumed osteomalacia.
The diagnosis and management of bone disease in patients
with chronic liver disease is summarised in (Fig. 3). Bone densit-
ometry should be evaluated in patients with previous fragility
fractures and those treated with corticosteroids and before liver
transplantation.180,204 Bone densitometry needs to be assessed
in patients with cholestatic diseases or if any of the described
risk factors are found, and in cirrhotics. In patients within nor-
mal BMD, it is advisable to repeat DEXA after two to three years,
as is suggested in the non-cirrhotic population. In conditions
associated with rapid bone loss, such as in cholestatic patients
with more than one risk factor for osteoporosis, and in those
in whom high-dose corticosteroid therapy has recently been ini-
tiated, DEXA can be repeated in a shorter interval of approxi-
mately one year. This schedule is also recommended for
patients with advanced cirrhosis, particularly in those eligible
for transplantation. Inaccuracies in BMD and bone marker mea-
surements in patients with cirrhosis or chronic cholestasis need
to be taken into consideration.205,206 Recognition of the risk fac-
tors for bone loss including those for osteoporosis and fractures
in patients with chronic liver disease is recommended, as in
general population and in postmenopausal women (Table 2).204
A balanced diet is recommended because patients with
chronic liver disease are often malnourished. Supplements of
calcium (1,000–1,500 mg/d) and 25(OH)D (400–800 IU/d or
260 lg every two weeks) or the dose required to preserve nor-
mal levels should be provided. However, there is no definite
data confirming the efficacy of these supplements in preventing
bone loss in patients with liver disease.134 Physical activity is
recommended, in particular with exercises designed to improve

 the mechanics of the spine. Factors that contribute to bone loss
need to be reduced to a minimum, including alcohol and tobacco
use. Corticosteroids ought to be minimised whenever possible.
Different pharmacological therapies have been proposed for
improving bone mass in patients with chronic liver disease, but
most studies have included small numbers of patients, and
therefore it is difficult to reach any definite conclusions. Fur-
thermore, no clear anti-fracture effect has been demonstrated,
and except for osteoporosis in PBC and after liver transplanta-
tion, no systematic studies have been reported.
There is no general agreement concerning the appropriate
time to start treatment, but patients with established osteo-
porosis, and therefore with fragility fractures, should be treated
to reduce the risk of further fractures. Since patients with PBC
with a lumbar or a proximal femur T-score lower than <�1.5
have a high risk of vertebral fracture, it seems reasonable to
consider specific therapy in these patients,180 and in all patients
with osteoporosis before transplantation.
Bisphosphonates are anti-catabolic drugs which increase
bone mass and reduce the incidence of fractures in post-
menopausal osteoporosis. Their effects in chronic liver disease
are not entirely defined, mostly because of the very limited num-
ber of studies and small numbers of patients.207–212 Nonetheless,
etidronate, alendronate and ibandronate increase bone mass in
patients with PBC, resulting in these patients achieving similar
bone mass as patients with osteoporosis associated with other
causes.208,211 Serious adverse events have not been observed
and potential harmful effects of bisphosphonates have not been
reported in liver patients. Moreover, bisphosphonates appear to
be well tolerated, although it would be reasonable to exercise
caution in using the drug in cirrhotics with recent oesophageal
banding/sclerotherapy to avoid oesophageal injury. Bisphospho-
nates may also have a role in transplanted patients.213–215
Favourable effects have been reported using zoledronic acid,216
and weekly alendronate.217 Moreover, zoledronic acid reduces
bone turnover and results in lower fracture rates.216
In patients with liver disease, hormonal replacement therapy
was limited for many years as it was considered harmful. Trans-
dermal oestrogens prevent bone loss or even increase BMD in
patients with PBC or autoimmune cirrhosis and in post-
menopausal women after liver transplantation, with no adverse
effects on the liver.218–221 In males with hemochromatosis and
hypogonadism, treatment with testosterone and venesection is
also effective.222 One concern about restoring testosterone
levels in cirrhotic patients is the increased risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma.105
There are no studies assessing the effects of anabolic drugs in
liver patients with osteoporosis, but PTH 1–34 is a potential
therapy for osteoporosis in these patients223 as well as deno-
sumab, a human monoclonal IgG antibody that binds to RANKL
and inhibits bone resorption.
Recommendations
� Evaluate BMD in cirrhotic patients and in patients with
cholestatic liver diseases, those receiving long-term cor-
ticosteroid treatment, and before liver transplantation.
(Grade II-2, A1)
� Utilise lumbar and femoral densitometry (DEXA) to diag-
nose osteoporosis and osteopenia. Lateral X-rays of dor-
sal and lumbar spine for diagnosing vertebral fractures.
(Grade II-3, A1)
� Repeat DEXA after two to three years in patients within
normal BMD, and within one year when rapid bone loss
is expected. (Grade II-1, B1)
� Include supplements of calcium (1,000–1,500 mg/d) and
25(OH)D (400–800 IU/d or 260 lg every two weeks) in
patients with chronic liver disease and a T-score below
-1.5. (Grade II-3, A1)
� Utilise bisphosphonates in cirrhotic patients with osteo-
porosis and in those waiting for liver transplantation.
(Grade I, A1)
� Consider testosterone supplementation and venesection
in males with hemochromatosis and hypogonadism.
(Grade II-2, B1)
New research should address the following topics
1. The use and safety of anabolic drugs, such as PTH 1–34 and
denosumab as potential new therapies for osteoporosis in
patients with cirrhosis.
Clinical scenarios requiring special considerations
Malnutrition in patients undergoing liver transplantation
and liver surgery
Preoperative nutrition
Both severe under nutrition (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) and severe obe-
sity (BMI >40 kg/m2) prior to liver transplantation are associ-
ated with increased mortality and morbidity.224–227 Severe
obesity prior to liver transplantation is associated with a higher
prevalence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension), crypto-
genic cirrhosis and increased mortality from infectious compli-
cations,
cardiovascular
disease
and
cancer.226,227
Some
investigators found that severe obesity was associated with
increased morbidity and mortality even when patients were
classified according to ‘‘dry BMI”227 while others have reported
that the amount of ascites and not BMI contributes to the
increased mortality risk.228
Numerous descriptive studies have shown higher morbidity
and mortality in cirrhotic patients with protein malnutrition
when such patients undergo liver transplantation.57,229–231
Recently, sarcopenia and frailty have been shown to confer an
increased risk of morbidity and mortality on the waiting list
and after transplantation.58,232–241 Patients on the waiting list
are at risk because of an inadequate food or caloric intake,242
and those consuming a low protein diet (<0.8 g/kg.BW/d) have

 an increased waiting list mortality.243 Nevertheless, there are no
formal trials showing that preoperative nutritional intervention
improves clinical outcome.
In less advanced and predominantly cholestatic liver cirrho-
sis, nutritional counselling plus oral nutritional supplement
(ONS) improved MAMC and grip strength compared to nutri-
tional counselling alone, while there was no difference in mor-
tality.244 In one pilot study, ONS enriched with x-3 fatty acids,
arginine and nucleotides appeared to reduce infectious compli-
cations.245 In a subsequent randomised trial, perioperative
immunonutrition did not provide significant benefits in terms
of preoperative total body protein status or postoperative out-
come compared to standard ONS.246
A combined meta-analysis of different interventions like glu-
tamine or x-3 fatty acids by the parenteral or enteral route
reported overall beneficial effects regarding morbidity and liver
function, but no significant difference in survival.247 Kaido and
colleagues observed less postoperative infections in their trans-
planted patients who received preoperative immuno-modulating
ONS.248 Interestingly, BCAA supplementation only conferred bet-
ter survival to sarcopenic patients on the waiting list but not to
non-sarcopenic individuals.249
In malnourished cirrhotic patients, the risk of postopera-
tive morbidity and mortality is increased after abdominal
surgery.250,251 Liver glycogen is depleted in cirrhotic patients.
Therefore it is advisable to take great care to shorten peri-
ods without nutrient intake in order to avoid gluconeogene-
sis
from
muscle
protein
in
an
already
protein
depleted
individual.252,253 Additionally, in liver surgery, adoption of
enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols improves
morbidity and reduces length of hospital stay when, among
other measures, patients are given carbohydrate containing
clear liquids up to 2 h preoperatively, and are fed early
and mobilised.254–256
Recommendations
� Screen for malnutrition and sarcopenia in cirrhotic
patients listed for transplantation or scheduled for elec-
tive surgery. Sarcopenia can be treated prior to elective
surgery, as this will enable improvement in body protein
status and clinical outcomes. (Grade III, B2)
� Screen for sarcopenic obesity, with body composition
analysis, in obese cirrhotic patients being considered
for surgery, in order to identify those at higher risk of
morbidity and mortality. (Grade III, C2)
� Preoperatively, if the treatment goal is maintenance of
nutritional status, plan a total energy intake of 30 kcal/
kg.BW/d and a protein intake of 1.2 g/kg.BW/d. If
improvement of nutritional status is the goal, plan a total
energy intake of 35 kcal/kg.BW/d and a protein intake of
1.5 g/kg.BW/d. (Grade II-3, B1)
� For preoperative nutrition, utilise standard nutrition reg-
imens, since specialised regimens (e.g. BCAA-enriched,
immune-enhancing diets) have not been shown to
improve morbidity or mortality in intervention trials.
(Grade II-1, B1)
Postoperative nutrition
After transplantation, postoperative parenteral or enteral nutri-
tion decreases time on the ventilator, length of ICU stay, and
reduces the risk of bacterial infections and bile duct complications
compared to only infusing fluids and electrolytes.258 Early enteral
nutrition (12 h after the operation) is associated with fewer viral
infections and better nitrogen retention than parenteral nutri-
tion.258 In a direct comparison between parenteral nutrition and
early enteral nutrition, both strategies proved to be equally effec-
tive with regard to the maintenance ofnutritional statebut enteral
nutrition reduced complication rates and costs.259 For early ent-
eral nutrition in adult liver transplant recipients, whole protein
formulae with260 or without pre- and probiotics258,259 or
peptide-based formulae via catheter jejunostomy261,262 have
been used. Formulae were administered via nasogastric or naso-
duodenal tubes after endoscopic placement259 or via catheter
jejunostomy261–263 placed during laparotomy. According to a
European survey256 the combination of enteral nutrition and par-
enteral nutrition was used in 10/16 centres, while 3/16 used par-
enteral nutrition or enteral nutrition alone.
After liver transplantation there is a considerable nitrogen
loss and patients remain in negative nitrogen balance for a pro-
longed period245,264 necessitating an increase in the provision of
protein or amino acids. Protein or amino acid provision of
1.0–1.5 g/kg.BW/d has been reported,257 which is slightly
lower than recommended for hospitalised or critically ill
patients.265–267 No difference was observed between a standard
and
a
BCAA-enriched
amino
acid solution
for
parenteral
nutrition after liver transplantation.257
In the early postoperative phase there is often a disturbance
in glucose metabolism associated with insulin resistance. In this
situation blood glucose levels should be managed like in other
surgical patients.256 In the first 48 h postoperatively, a lower
provision of energy (<18 kcal/kg.BW/d)268 may be advisable in
the light of the growing recognition of autophagy as a source
of endogenous substrate supply.269 Less postoperative morbid-
ity and shortened length of stay was reported, seemingly in
duplicate, when x-3 fatty acids were used for parenteral nutri-
tion.270,271 The function of the hepatic reticuloendothelial sys-
tem was reported to recover better when a medium chain
triglyceride/long chain triglyceride emulsion was given as par-
enteral nutrition instead of a long chain triglyceride emulsion
after liver transplantation.272
For the growing subgroup of obese patients undergoing sur-
gery, recent guidelines recommend energy (25 kcal/kg ideal
BW/d) and protein (2.0 g/kg ideal BW/d) intakes based on ideal
BW calculated based on height and gender.273
Chronic dilutional hyponatraemia is not infrequent in cir-
rhotic patients and should be corrected carefully after trans-
plantation
in
order
to
avoid
pontine
myelinolysis.274
Magnesium levels need to be monitored in order to detect and
treat cyclosporine or tacrolimus induced hypomagnesaemia.275
The simultaneous administration of enteral feeding with tacro-
limus did not interfere with tacrolimus absorption.276
Long-term survivors of liver transplantation are at consider-
able risk of becoming overweight or even obese and developing
relevant morbidities due to the metabolic syndrome.277–279
Attention should be paid to avoiding sarcopenic obesity,280
using stringent postoperative physiotherapy and dietary coun-
selling
to
overcome
the
deconditioning
of
pre-transplant
chronic liver disease.281–283

 Sarcopenic cirrhotic patients undergoing non-transplant sur-
gery like resection for hepatocellular carcinoma have an
increased mortality risk.284,285 In cirrhotic patients undergoing
non-transplant visceral surgery, the complication rate and
nitrogen economy can be improved when nutrition support is
provided instead of just fluid and electrolytes.286,263 It may be
safely assumed that enteral nutrition in the early postoperative
period would yield at least equally beneficial results. However,
there are no studies comparing the two regimens in cirrhotic
patients. There are data to suggest a beneficial effect on gut per-
meability
of
sequential
parenteral/enteral
nutrition
(via
jejunostomy), compared to parenteral nutrition alone or no
postoperative nutrition at all.263
In cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection, oesophageal
transection and splenectomy or splenorenal shunt, the rate of
HE was not increased when a conventional amino acid solution
(50 g/d) was used for postoperative parenteral nutrition instead
of a BCAA-enriched amino acid solution (40 g/d).286 Tang and
colleagues reported improved immune function and preserved
gut mucosal integrity when parenteral nutrition supplemented
with glutamine and human growth hormone was used in cir-
rhotic patients.287
Recommendations
� After liver transplantation initiate normal food and/or
enteral tube feeding preferably within 12–24 h postop-
eratively, or as soon as possible, to reduce infection rates.
(Grade II-2, B1)
� When oral or enteral nutrition are not possible or are
impracticable,
parenteral
nutrition
should
be
used
instead of no feeding in order to reduce complication
rates, time on mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.
(Grade II-2, B1)
� After the acute postoperative phase, provide an energy
intake of 35 kcal/kg.BW/d and a protein intake of 1.5 g/
kg.BW/d. (Grade II-2, C1)
� After other surgical procedures, patients with chronic
liver disease can be managed according to the ERAS pro-
tocol. (Grade III, C2)
� Consider parenteral nutrition in patients with unpro-
tected airways and HE when cough and swallow reflexes
are compromised, or enteral nutrition is contraindicated
or impractical. (Grade II-2, C1)
� Enteral tube feeding and/or parenteral nutrition with a
reduced target energy intake (25 kcal/kg.BW/d) and an
increased target protein intake (2.0 g/kg.BW/d) can be
utilised in obese patients. (Grade III, C2)
Nutrition in the critically ill cirrhotic patient
In critically ill cirrhotic patients (patients hospitalised for severe
complications of the disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure,
patients in an intensive care unit, those with acute alcoholic
hepatitis), maintenance of an adequate nutritional support is a
relevant
target.
Direct
measurement
of
REE
by
indirect
calorimetry is advisable in these patients whenever possible.
Of note, as in all critically ill patients, tight glucose control is
indicated to prevent hyper- and hypoglycaemia.29,113 Critically
ill cirrhotic patients more frequently require enteral or par-
enteral nutrition. Nutritional guidelines exist, proposed by dif-
ferent medical societies, for patients with chronic liver disease
in different settings (Table S1).
Alcoholic liver disease and severe/acute alcoholic hepatitis
Nielsen et al. focussed on patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and
found a mean TEE of 32 ± 7 kcal/kg.BW/d70 and, in another study,
a median TEE of 28 kcal/kg.BW/d,81 similar to that in patients with
cirrhosis of different aetiologies. However patients with active
alcohol abuse may have a higher REE than healthy controls.288,289
An early study in alcoholic hepatitis showed that the intra-
venous addition of 70 to 85 g of amino acids to a diet containing
3,000 kcal and 100 g of protein over four weeks, was safe and
associated with a lower mortality rate.290 A low protein intake
was also shown to worsen HE in 136 patients with alcoholic
hepatitis and HE.291
Two meta-analyses evaluated the impact of nutritional sup-
plementation in patients with alcoholic liver disease.12,112 The
first included seven randomised controlled studies testing oral
or intravenous nutritional supplementation vs. a hospital diet
in 262 patients, for 21 to 28 days. Nutritional support improved
the resolution of clinical encephalopathy but did not influence
mortality, ascites or laboratory parameters.112 The second
included studies comparing parenteral nutrition, enteral nutri-
tion and ONS with no nutritional support.12 No benefits of nutri-
tional support were observed but a trend towards a better
nitrogen balance with parenteral nutrition was noted.
It was hypothesised that enteral nutrition improves survival
to the same extent as corticosteroids. One study found no differ-
ence in mortality in 71 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis
(71% with cirrhosis) randomised to prednisone or enteral nutri-
tion for 28 days.292 In another study, 136 patients with alcoholic
hepatitis were randomised to methylprednisolone and enteral
nutrition or methylprednisolone with conventional nutrition.
No difference in the six-month mortality was observed but calo-
ric intake lower than 21.5 kcal/kg.BW/d was associated with
higher mortality.293
Immunonutrition
Immunonutrition, i.e. nutritional solutions enriched with x-3
fatty acids, arginine and nucleotides, has also been proposed.
One retrospective study examined patients undergoing elec-
tive liver resection, who received preoperative oral immunonu-
trition for seven days (n = 84; 14 patients with cirrhosis) vs. no
oral supplementation (n = 63, 5 patients with cirrhosis). The
authors found no impact on postoperative complications.294
When considering the components of immunonutrition sepa-
rately, oral x-3 fatty acids administered to cirrhotic patients
with ascites and renal failure did not improve renal function
but increased bleeding time and arterial blood pressure, leading
the authors to argue against their use in cirrhotic patients.295
Nutritional support in gastrointestinal bleeding
In a randomised study, 22 patients with liver cirrhosis were
administered enteral nutrition by a nasogastric tube or no oral
intake during the first four days after acute bleeding from oeso-
phageal varices.296 No difference in re-bleeding, nutritional sta-
tus, liver function, duration of hospital stay and mortality was
observed between the groups after a follow-up of 35 days. Nev-
ertheless, experts recommend withholding enteral nutrition for
48–72 h after acute bleeding,297,298 because enteral nutrition

 increases splanchnic blood flow, which in turn may increase
portal pressure and the risk of variceal re-bleeding.
Recommendations
� Consider nutritional status and presence of sarcopenia in
all critically ill cirrhotic patients and provide nutritional
support while treating other manifestations of severe
decompensation. (Grade II-3, C1)
� Supplement dietary intake by enteral nutrition in criti-
cally ill cirrhotic patients who are unable to achieve ade-
quate dietary intake by mouth. If oral diet or enteral
nutrition are not tolerated or contraindicated parenteral
nutrition should be provided. (Grade III, A1)
� Naso-gastroenteric tubes are not contraindicated in
patients with non-bleeding oesophageal varices. (Grade
II-2, A1)
� It is best to avoid PEG insertion in cirrhotic patients
because of the risk of bleeding. (Grade III, B2)
� Take care that daily energy intake in critically ill cirrhotic
patients is not lower than the recommended 35–40 kcal/
kg.BW/d or 1.3 times measured REE. (Grade II-2, B1)
� Take care that daily protein intake in critically ill cir-
rhotic patients is not lower than the recommended 1.
2–1.3 g/kg.BW/d. (Grade II-2, B1)
� Standard nutrition regimens can be utilised in critically
ill cirrhotic patients since no advantage has been shown
for specialised regimens (e.g. BCAA-enriched, immune-
enhancing diets) in terms of morbidity or mortality.
(Grade II-1, B2)
� In critically ill cirrhotic patients with HE, BCAA-enriched
solutions should be used to facilitate resolution. (Grade
I, A1)
� In cirrhosis and severe/acute alcoholic hepatitis, nutri-
tional support should be provided to accelerate resolu-
tion of HE, and, improve survival in patients with low
calorie intake. (Grade II-1, A1)
New research should address the following topics
1. In the absence of indirect calorimetry, what is the best way
to calculate energy needs in critically ill patients with liver
diseases?
2. Does increased energy and protein intake improve outcomes
in critically ill patients with liver diseases?
3. Should the nutritional recommendations differ according to
the nutritional status at baseline?
Conclusion
Nutrition in chronic liver disease is a rapidly evolving field and
the object of growing clinical interest. These Clinical Practice
Guidelines have been produced with the aim of summarising
current knowledge in this field. Nutritional impairment and
sarcopenia have been recognised as crucial complications of
chronic liver disease, which severely impact on prognosis.
Undernutrition and sarcopenia are also interconnected with
other complications of cirrhosis such as HE, ascites and the sus-
ceptibility to infection. The molecular mechanisms underlying
sarcopenia have been investigated in depth and clarified to
some extent. At the same time, a novel condition has emerged,
i.e. the occurrence of overweight and obesity in cirrhotic
patients. This deserves both clinical attention and further study.
Recent research has provided preliminary data on the potential
benefit of physical activity in patients with cirrhosis. However,
both the target population and the exact features of the activity
(i.e. isometric vs. aerobic) need to be better defined.
While working on these guidelines the authors had to recog-
nise that high quality studies in the field of nutrition in liver dis-
ease are often lacking. There are many reasons for this,
including uncertainties in definitions, lack of standardised out-
comes and scarcity of interventional studies. These require
large, homogeneous groups of patients and long-term observa-
tion. Consequently, the available studies are often underpow-
ered, and even meta-analyses have failed to reach definite
conclusions. Thus, in several instances the working panel pro-
duced recommendations, and sometimes even strong recom-
mendations, despite the lack of high quality, specific evidence.
These were based on the literature from parallel research and
clinical fields, recommendations directed to the general popula-
tion, standard practice, feasibility, costs and, ultimately, com-
mon
sense.
While
lack
of
strong
evidence
represents
a
limitation, the present document reflects the actual situation
of this clinical and research field, and it will hopefully serve as
a basis for future studies providing better data to reinforce or
modify current practices.
