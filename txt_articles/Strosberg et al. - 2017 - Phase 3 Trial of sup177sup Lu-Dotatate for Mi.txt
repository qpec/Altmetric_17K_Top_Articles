BACKGROUND
Patients with advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors who have had disease progres-
sion during first-line somatostatin analogue therapy have limited therapeutic options. 
This randomized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of lutetium-177 
(177Lu)–Dotatate in patients with advanced, progressive, somatostatin-receptor–positive 
midgut neuroendocrine tumors.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 229 patients who had well-differentiated, metastatic midgut neu-
roendocrine tumors to receive either 177Lu-Dotatate (116 patients) at a dose of 7.4 GBq 
every 8 weeks (four intravenous infusions, plus best supportive care including octreotide 
long-acting repeatable [LAR] administered intramuscularly at a dose of 30 mg) (177Lu-
Dotatate group) or octreotide LAR alone (113 patients) administered intramuscularly at 
a dose of 60 mg every 4 weeks (control group). The primary end point was progression-
free survival. Secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, 
safety, and the side-effect profile. The final analysis of overall survival will be conducted 
in the future as specified in the protocol; a prespecified interim analysis of overall sur-
vival was conducted and is reported here.
RESULTS
At the data-cutoff date for the primary analysis, the estimated rate of progression-free 
survival at month 20 was 65.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.0 to 76.8) in the 177Lu-
Dotatate group and 10.8% (95% CI, 3.5 to 23.0) in the control group. The response rate 
was 18% in the 177Lu-Dotatate group versus 3% in the control group (P<0.001). In the 
planned interim analysis of overall survival, 14 deaths occurred in the 177Lu-Dotatate 
group and 26 in the control group (P 
= 
0.004). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocyto-
penia, and lymphopenia occurred in 1%, 2%, and 9%, respectively, of patients in the 
177Lu-Dotatate group as compared with no patients in the control group, with no evidence 
of renal toxic effects during the observed time frame.
CONCLUSIONS
Treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate resulted in markedly longer progression-free survival and 
a significantly higher response rate than high-dose octreotide LAR among patients with 
advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors. Preliminary evidence of an overall survival 
benefit was seen in an interim analysis; confirmation will be required in the planned 
final analysis. Clinically significant myelosuppression occurred in less than 10% of 
patients in the 177Lu-Dotatate group. (Funded by Advanced Accelerator Applications;

euroendocrine tumors of the mid-
gut (which is defined as the jejunoileum 
and the proximal colon) commonly metas-
tasize to the mesentery, peritoneum, and liver and 
are frequently associated with the carcinoid syn-
drome.1,2 Neuroendocrine tumors of the midgut 
represent the most common type of malignant 
gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors and are 
associated with 5-year survival rates of less than 
50% among persons with metastatic disease.3,4 
First-line systemic therapy usually consists of a 
somatostatin analogue for control of both hor-
monal secretion and tumor growth.5-7 With the 
exception of everolimus for the treatment of 
nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors,8 no stan-
dard second-line systemic treatment options are 
currently available.8,9
Since 1992,10-15 radiolabeled somatostatin ana-
logue therapy (a form of treatment also known as 
peptide receptor radionuclide therapy) has shown 
considerable promise for the treatment of ad-
vanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, 
a majority of which express high levels of soma-
tostatin receptors to which somatostatin analogues 
bind.16 This targeted form of systemic radiother-
apy allows the delivery of radionuclides directly to 
tumor cells. Initial efficacy results were based on 
very high doses of 111In-DTPA0-octreotide,11 but 
more promising results were subsequently found 
with 90Y-DOTA0-Tyr3–octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC)17 
and with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3–octreotate (177Lu-
Dotatate).12 Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a beta- and 
gamma-emitting radionuclide with a maximum 
particle range of 2 mm and a half-life of 160 
hours.18 In a single-group trial of 177Lu-Dotatate 
involving 310 patients who had gastroenteropan-
creatic neuroendocrine tumors, complete tumor 
remissions occurred in 2% of the patients and 
partial tumor remissions in 28%.12 The median 
progression-free survival was 33 months.
We report here results from the phase 3 Neuro-
endocrine Tumors Therapy (NETTER-1) trial, 
which evaluated the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-
Dotatate as compared with high-dose octreotide 
long-acting repeatable (LAR) in patients with 
advanced, progressive, somatostatin-receptor–
positive midgut neuroendocrine tumors.
Methods
Patients
This international, multicenter, phase 3 trial was 
conducted at 41 centers in 8 countries world-
wide. Eligible patients were adults who had mid-
gut neuroendocrine tumors that had metastasized 
or were locally advanced, that were inoperable, 
that were histologically confirmed and centrally 
verified, and that showed disease progression 
(according to Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.119) on either 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) over the course of a maxi-
mum period of 3 years during treatment with 
octreotide LAR (20 to 30 mg every 3 to 4 weeks 
for at least 12 weeks before randomization). Pa-
tients were required to have a Karnofsky perfor-
mance-status score of at least 60 (on a scale 
from 0 to 100, with lower numbers indicating 
greater disability), a tumor with well-differenti-
ated histologic features, and somatostatin recep-
tors present on all target lesions (as confirmed 
by blinded, independent central review). Well-
differentiated histologic features were defined 
as a Ki67 index (the percentage of cells that are 
positive for Ki67 as determined by immunos-
taining of the primary tumor) of 20% or less; 
tumors were assessed as low-grade if they had a 
Ki67 index of 0 to 2%, intermediate-grade if they 
had a Ki67 index of 3 to 20%, or high-grade if 
they had a Ki67 index of greater than 20%, with 
a lower grade indicating a lower rate of prolifera-
tive activity. Target lesions were selected from CT 
or MRI, and the degree of expression of soma-
tostatin receptors was determined on the basis of 
the lesion that had the highest uptake of radio-
tracer observed on planar somatostatin receptor 
scintigraphy within 24 weeks before randomiza-
tion. All CT and MRI images were reviewed and 
evaluated for disease progression (according to 
RECIST criteria) and somatostatin receptor ex-
pression by independent central reviewers who 
were unaware of the treatment assignments.
Key exclusion criteria were a serum creatinine 
level of more than 150 μmol per liter (1.7 mg per 
deciliter) or a creatinine clearance of less than 
50 ml per minute; a hemoglobin level of less 
than 8.0 g per deciliter; a white-cell count of less 
than 2000 per cubic millimeter; a platelet count 
of less than 75,000 per cubic millimeter; a total 
bilirubin level of more than 3 times the upper 
limit of the normal range; a serum albumin 
level of more than 3.0 g per deciliter, unless the 
prothrombin time value was within the normal 
range; treatment with more than 30 mg of octreo-
tide LAR within 12 weeks before randomization; 
peptide receptor radionuclide therapy at any time

before randomization; and any surgery, liver-
directed transarterial therapy, or chemotherapy 
within 12 weeks before randomization.
Trial Design
In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly 
assigned patients, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive 177Lu-
Dotatate plus best supportive care, consisting of 
octreotide LAR at a dose of 30 mg every 4 weeks 
for symptom control (177Lu-Dotatate group) or to 
receive high-dose octreotide LAR, at a dose of 
60 mg every 4 weeks (control group). Random-
ization was performed with the use of a central-
ized permuted block (block size of 4) randomiza-
tion scheme, with stratification according to the 
highest tumor uptake score on somatostatin re-
ceptor scintigraphy (grade 2, 3, or 4 on a scale 
ranging from 0 [no uptake by tumor] to 4 [very 
intense uptake by tumor] with higher grades in-
dicating a higher level of expression of soma-
tostatin receptors)12 and according to the length 
of time that a patient had been receiving a con-
stant dose of octreotide (≤6 months or >6 months).
In the 177Lu-Dotatate group, 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) 
of 177Lu-Dotatate was infused intravenously over 
a period of 30 minutes. Patients received four 
infusions every 8 weeks (cumulative radioactivity, 
29.6 GBq [800 mCi]) unless unacceptable toxic 
effects occurred, centrally confirmed disease 
progression (according to RECIST) was present 
on imaging, the patient was unable or unwilling 
to adhere to trial procedures, the patient with-
drew consent, or the patient died. For renal 
protection, an intravenous amino acid solution 
(Aminosyn II 10% [21.0 g of lysine and 20.4 g 
of arginine in 2 liters of solution] or VAMIN-18 
[18 g of lysine and 22.6 g of arginine in 2 liters 
of solution]) was administered concomitantly for 
at least 4 hours, starting 30 minutes before infu-
sion of the radiopharmaceutical. In the 177Lu-
Dotatate group, patients continued to receive 
supportive care with octreotide LAR, which was 
administered intramuscularly at a dose of 30 mg 
approximately 24 hours after each infusion of 
177Lu-Dotatate and then monthly after completion 
of all four treatments. In the control group, 
octreotide LAR at a dose of 60 mg was adminis-
tered intramuscularly every 4 weeks. In both treat-
ment groups, patients were allowed to receive 
subcutaneous rescue injections of octreotide in 
the event of hormonal symptoms (i.e., diarrhea 
or flushing) associated with their carcinoid syn-
drome.
Trial Oversight
This trial was sponsored by Advanced Accelera-
tor Applications and was designed by Advanced 
Accelerator Applications in collaboration with the 
last two authors. The trial protocol was approved 
by the investigational review board or independent 
ethics committee at each participating institu-
tion. Contract research organizations monitored 
the trial and collected, compiled, maintained, and 
analyzed the data. The trial was performed in ac-
cordance with the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, International Conference on Harmoni-
sation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all 
applicable regulations. All the patients provided 
written informed consent. An independent data 
and safety monitoring board oversaw the conduct 
of the trial. The first draft of the manuscript was 
prepared by the first author with assistance from 
a professional medical writer funded by the spon-
sor. All the authors contributed to subsequent 
drafts and agreed to submit the manuscript for 
publication. All the authors vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and the analy-
sis and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
The protocol and statistical analysis plan are avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was progression-free sur-
vival, which was defined as the time from ran-
domization to documented disease progression 
(as evaluated by independent central review by 
radiologists who were unaware of the treatment 
assignments) or death from any cause. Secondary 
end points included the objective response rate, 
overall survival (defined as the time from ran-
domization to death from any cause), safety, and 
the side-effect profile. An objective tumor assess-
ment on CT or MRI was performed every 12 weeks 
after the date of randomization in both treatment 
groups. The treatment was considered to have 
failed if a patient had progressive disease on 
imaging, according to central assessment with the 
use of RECIST criteria, and patients with treat-
ment failure proceeded directly to the long-term 
follow-up phase. We calculated the response rate 
as the percentage of patients who had a response 
according to RECIST (sum of partial responses 
and complete responses). Definitions of all re-
sponse categories are provided in the protocol.
Safety was assessed (at least every 2 to 12 weeks, 
depending on the phase of the trial [treatment 
phase or follow-up phase] and treatment group)

on the basis of adverse events (which were 
graded according to the National Cancer Insti-
tute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.03), laboratory results (hemato-
logic, chemical, and urologic), physical examina-
tions, vital signs, electrocardiography, and Kar-
nofsky performance status. Additional details 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the required number of patients 
for the trial assuming that the median progres-
sion-free survival would be 30 months in the 
177Lu-Dotatate group and 14 months in the con-
trol group, the study would have 90% nominal 
power at an alpha level of 5%, and the prespeci-
fied enrollment period and follow-up period for 
both groups would be 18 months. On the basis 
of those assumptions, we calculated that we 
needed a sample of 124 patients, and the analy-
sis of the primary end point was planned to be 
conducted after at least 74 events of disease 
progression or death that were centrally con-
firmed and could be evaluated had occurred. 
However, the sample size of the trial was ad-
justed to 230 patients to enable us to detect a 
statistically significant and clinically relevant 
difference between the two treatment groups in 
overall survival as a secondary end point. This 
calculation was based on the assumption that 
the median overall survival would be 50 months 
in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 32 months in the 
control group, with 80% nominal power at an 
alpha level of 5%, and a prespecified enrollment 
period of 18 months and a long-term follow-up 
period of 60 months. A prespecified interim 
analysis of overall survival was conducted at the 
time of the analysis of progression-free survival. 
The final analysis of overall survival is planned 
to be performed either after 158 deaths have oc-
curred or 5 years after the last patient underwent 
randomization, whichever occurs first.
All patients who underwent randomization 
were included in the analyses of efficacy, demo-
graphics, and baseline characteristics. The safe-
ty population, which comprised all patients who 
underwent randomization and received at least 
one dose of trial treatment, was used for all 
safety analyses. The median point estimate and 
95% confidence interval for progression-free 
survival and overall survival were estimated by 
means of the Kaplan–Meier method. Objective 
response rates and corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals were calculated for each treat-
ment group and were compared with the use of 
Fisher’s exact test. Survival curves were com-
pared with the use of an unstratified log-rank 
test and were tested against the null hypothesis. 
Hazard ratios were estimated with the use of an 
unstratified Cox proportional-hazards model.
Results
Patients
From September 2012 through mid-January 
2016, a total of 229 patients underwent random-
ization at 41 sites (27 sites in Europe and 14 in 
the United States); 221 of the 229 patients who 
underwent randomization received at least one 
dose of trial treatment, including 111 patients in 
the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 110 in the control 
group (safety population) (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The demographic and clini-
cal characteristics of the patients were well bal-
anced between the two treatment groups; the 
ileum was the primary tumor site in a majority 
of patients (73%), and most patients presented 
with metastases in the liver (83%), the lymph 
nodes (62%), or both, typically in the mesentery 
or retroperitoneum (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The treatment groups 
were well balanced with respect to tumor grade 
(low-grade [grade 1] Ki67 proliferation index in 
66% of patients in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 
in 72% in the control group) and with respect to 
the highest uptake of tumor somatostatin radio-
tracer (high-grade [grade 4] uptake in 61% of 
patients in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and in 59% 
of patients in the control group). Serum chromo-
granin A levels and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
levels in a 24-hour urine specimen were similar 
in the two treatment groups. Approximately 
80% of the patients had undergone previous 
surgical resection (78% in the 177Lu-Dotatate 
group and 82% in the control group), and nearly 
half the patients had undergone a previous form 
of systemic therapy other than somatostatin 
analogue therapy (41% of patients in the 177Lu-
Dotatate group and 45% in the control group).
Efficacy
At the time of the data cutoff for the primary 
analysis (July 24, 2015), 23 events of disease

progression or death had occurred in the 177Lu-
Dotatate group and 68 such events had occurred 
in the control group. The estimated rate of pro-
gression-free survival at month 20 was 65.2% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 50.0 to 76.8) in 
the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 10.8% (95% CI, 3.5 
to 23.0) in the control group. The median pro-
gression-free survival had not yet been reached 
in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and was 8.4 months 
(95% CI, 5.8 to 9.1) in the control group (hazard 
ratio for disease progression or death with 177Lu-
Dotatate vs. control, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.33; 
P<0.001), which represented a 79% lower risk of 
disease progression or death in the 177Lu-Dot-
atate group than in the control group (Fig. 1A). 
Consistent treatment benefits associated with 
177Lu-Dotatate were observed irrespective of 
stratification factors and prognostic factors, 
which included levels of radiotracer uptake on 
somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, tumor grade, 
age, sex, and tumor marker levels (Fig. 1C).
In addition to the analysis of progression-free 
survival, we performed a planned interim analy-
sis of overall survival. A total of 14 deaths in the

an estimated risk of death that was 60% lower 
in the 177Lu-Dotatate group than in the control 
group (hazard ratio for death with 177Lu-Dotatate 
group vs. control, 0.40; P 
= 
0.004) (Fig. 1B). The 
O’Brien–Fleming threshold for significance at 
the first interim analysis was 0.000085. Data were 
not sufficiently mature to provide an estimate of 
the median overall survival in either treatment 
group. Within the population of patients who 
could be evaluated for tumor response (201 pa-
tients), the total number of complete and partial 
responses was 18 in the 177Lu-Dotatate group 
and 3 in the control group, which corresponded 
to response rates of 18% and 3%, respectively 
(P<0.001) (Table 2).
Treatment Administration and Safety
A majority of patients (77%) in the 177Lu-Dotatate 
group received all four infusions of 177Lu-Dotatate. 
A total of eight patients required dose reduction. 
Details regarding patient exposure to treatment 
are presented in Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
In total, 201 patients (95% of patients in the 
177Lu-Dotatate group and 86% of patients in the 
control group) had at least one adverse event dur-
ing the trial. Adverse events that were considered 
by the investigator to be related to trial treatment 
occurred in 129 patients: 95 patients (86%) in the 
177Lu-Dotatate group and 34 patients (31%) in 
the control group (Table 3). Adverse events that 
occurred after the start of treatment and subse-
quently led to premature withdrawal from the

The objective response rate was defined as the percentage of patients who had a response according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (sum of partial responses and complete responses). Patients for whom 
no post-baseline computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or central response data 
were available (15 patients in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 13 patients in the control group) were excluded from this 
analysis (trial is still ongoing).

177Lu-Dotatate for Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors
the 65 patients [65%] and in 38 of the 52 patients 
[73%], respectively) were attributable to amino 
acid infusions that were performed concurrently 
with administration of 177Lu-Dotatate, and the 
events resolved once the infusions were com-
pleted. Other common adverse events in the 
177Lu-Dotatate group included fatigue or asthe-
nia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; however, a 
majority of the patients in whom these events 
were reported (≥97%) had events of grade 1 or 2 
(Table 4). Among patients in the control group, 
the most common adverse events were gastro-
intestinal disorders and fatigue or asthenia. The 
rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were similar 
in the two groups; however, grade 3 or 4 neutro-
penia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia were 
reported in 1%, 2%, and 9% of patients, respec-
tively, in the 177Lu-Dotatate group versus no pa-
tients in the control group. These hematologic 
events were transient (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). No evidence of renal toxic effects 
was seen among patients in the 177Lu-Dotatate 
group (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix) 
during the observed time frame (median dura-
tion of follow-up, 14 months).
The myelodysplastic syndrome is an adverse 
event of potential interest in this trial, given the 
long-term risk of the myelodysplastic syndrome 
or acute leukemia that has been reported previ-
ously in approximately 2% of patients.20,21 Before 
the data cutoff date, one patient in the 177Lu-
Dotatate group of our trial (0.9%) who had a 
history of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown 
clinical significance had cytopenias; the patient 
subsequently underwent a bone marrow biopsy 
that revealed histologic changes consistent with 
the myelodysplastic syndrome that were consid-
ered by the investigator to be possibly related to 
the investigational therapy.
Discussion
In this randomized, phase 3 trial involving pa-
tients with progressive midgut neuroendocrine 
tumors, treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate resulted 
in a risk of progression or death that was 79% 
lower than the risk associated with high-dose 
octreotide LAR. The estimated rate of progres-
sion-free survival at month 20 was 65.2% (95% 
CI, 50.0 to 76.8) in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 
10.8% (95% CI, 3.5 to 23.0) in the control group. 
The median progression-free survival was 8.4 
months in the control group and had not yet 
been reached in the 177Lu-Dotatate group. A sub-
group analysis showed consistent benefit across 
major subgroups. The response rate of 18% in 
the 177Lu-Dotatate group (as compared with 3% 
in the control group) is also notable given that 
response rates above 5% have not been observed 
in large randomized clinical trials of other sys-
temic therapies in this patient population.22-25 
Although our trial has not yet reached the point 
at which the median overall survival can be cal-
culated, the results of the interim analysis sug-
gest longer overall survival with 177Lu-Dotatate 
than with high-dose octreotide LAR. The final 
analysis of overall survival is planned to be per-
formed either after 158 deaths have occurred or 
5 years after the last patient underwent random-
ization, whichever occurs first. 177Lu-Dotatate, 
when administered concomitantly with a renal-
protective agent, was associated with low rates 
of grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects and 
showed no evidence of renal toxic effects over 
the trial time frame (median duration of follow-
up, 14 months).
Radiolabeled somatostatin analogues provide 
a means of delivering targeted radiation with a 
high therapeutic index to tumors that express 
somatostatin receptors.12-15,20,21,26-28 Data from non-
randomized trials of 177Lu-Dotatate have consis-
tently shown high response rates and long dura-
tions of median progression-free survival in 
heterogeneous patient populations with gastro-
enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.12,26,29,30 
The NETTER-1 trial validates these early-phase 
data in the context of a prospective, randomized 
trial.
In summary, 
177Lu-Dotatate resulted in marked-
ly longer progression-free survival than high-dose 
octreotide LAR and was associated with limited 
acute toxic effects in a population of patients 
who had progressive neuroendocrine tumors that 
originated in the midgut.
