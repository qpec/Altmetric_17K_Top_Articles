Abstract
Timings of human activities are marked by circadian clocks which in turn are entrained to dif-
ferent environmental signals. In an urban environment the presence of artificial lighting and
various social cues tend to disrupt the natural entrainment with the sunlight. However, it is
not completely understood to what extent this is the case. Here we exploit the large-scale
data analysis techniques to study the mobile phone calling activity of people in large cities to
infer the dynamics of urban daily rhythms. From the calling patterns of about 1,000,000
users spread over different cities but lying inside the same time-zone, we show that the
onset and termination of the calling activity synchronizes with the east-west progression of
the sun. We also find that the onset and termination of the calling activity of users follows a
yearly dynamics, varying across seasons, and that its timings are entrained to solar mid-
night. Furthermore, we show that the average mid-sleep time of people living in urban areas
depends on the age and gender of each cohort as a result of biological and social factors.
Author summary
For humans living in urban areas, the modern daily life is very different from that of peo-
ple who lived in ancient times, from which todays’ societies evolved. Mainly due to the
availability of artificial lighting, modern humans have been able to modify their natural
daily cycles. In addition, social rules, like those related to work and schooling, tend to
require specific schedules for the daily activities. However, it is not fully understood to
what extent the seasonal changes in sunrise and sunset times and the length of daylight
could influence the timings of these activities. In this study, we use a new approach to
describe the dynamics of human resting periods in terms of mobile phone calling activity,
showing that the onset and termination of the resting pattern of urban humans follow the
east-west sun progression inside the same timezone. Also we find that the onset of the low
calling activity period as well as its mid-time, are subjected to seasonal changes, following
the same dynamics as solar midnight. Moreover, with resting time measured as the low
activity periods of people in cities, we discover significant behavioural differences between
different age and gender cohorts. These findings suggest that the length and timings of the

Data Availability Statement: The original dataset
comprises call detail records of individuals whose
actual identities are not known but addressed by
uniquely hashed identifiers by the service provider
thus the dataset is fully anonymized prior been
given to us. Each record in this dataset pertains to
a call in which two individuals participated and the
record contains the precise time and duration of
the call. The metadata also includes age, gender
and postal code information of each anonymized
subscriber. In addition, we had to sign a Non-
Disclosure Agreement for not to share the original
data. A processed aggregated data, comprising the
 human daily rhythms, still have a sensitive dependence on the seasonal changes of the
sunlight.
Introduction
The daily activity of people varies across space and time from place to place, date to date, and
hour to hour as a result of biological, societal, economic, and environmental factors, shaping
the society where they live. Roughly speaking, each day humans do certain activities at specific
times. There are many environmental factors (cues or ‘zeitgebers’) involved in the entrainment
of this clock, but as pointed out by Roenneberg et al. [1], the most dominant is light and is
associated with the light-darkness cycle determined by the daily rhythm of daylight. However,
mainly in places not close to the equator, the timing and duration of daylight is subject to
noticeable seasonal variation due to the yearly movement of the Earth around the Sun, and
these changes have a direct influence on the kind and timing of different human activities. On
the other hand, humans living in urban areas are also immersed in an environment full of cues
that could influence the entrainment of the circadian clock. Artificial lighting, social practices
and schedules (work and school hours, workdays vs weekends), particularly for those living in
big urban areas, could have a noticeable influence on the entrainment process. Social conven-
tions impose characteristic schedules on individuals, and, at the population level we can expect
people in urban areas to have periods of high activity between morning and evening, and peri-
ods of low activity (resting) during the night. The length and timings of human activity peri-
ods, specifically in urban areas, has important consequences for human health [2–5], economy
and power consumption [6], and public transportation efficiency [7].
The human sleep wake cycle (SWC), and its dynamics in particular, has been studied in
recent years to understand the processes and cues that govern it [8]. Generally speaking, most
research on human SWC has focused on experiments with small groups under controlled con-
ditions [9, 10], or questionnaire studies [1, 11–14] (mainly using the Morning-Eveningness
Questionnaire (MEQ) [15] and the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) [16]). The
use of these tools for studying SWC has proved to be very fruitful and effective, though having
some limits on the domain of applicability [14]. In contrast, the ever-increasing availability of
information communication technologies (ICT) combined with researchers’ ability to access
large-scale ICT-generated datasets (‘Big data’) has made possible the study of human behav-
iour using a variety of reality (data) mining techniques. In particular, there are a number of
examples where mobile phone datasets have been analyzed to study social networks [17–20],
sociobiology [21, 22], mental health [23], mobility [24–27], as well as social behaviour of cities
[28, 29]. Over the past decade or so, the existence and accessibility of these large population-
level datasets, has allowed scientists to study intrinsic human behavioural and socio-
evolutionary patterns in unprecedented and complementary ways, compared to other research
approaches.
Recently, datasets of mobile phone usage have also been used to study circadian rhythms,
by analyzing individual’s mobile phone usage from the data captured by sensors [26, 30–35],
or people’s communication patterns from their call detail records (CDRs) [31–33]. For exam-
ple, one study used the mobile phone screen on-off sensor data to examine the sleep wake
cycle of nine individuals, finding that most of the individuals varied their sleep time patterns
between weekdays and weekends, as well as showing seasonal changes in their mid-sleep time
[30]. In another study using mobile phones calls and text messages of a small number of indi-
viduals, it was shown that individuals can be classified as having morning type or evening type

 activity levels [31]. In our previous related work [33], we quantified the resting periods of peo-
ple from their mobile phone calling activity, showing that there is a counterbalancing effect
between the afternoon and night time resting periods, due to an interplay between ambient
temperature and sunlight. The use of CDRs as a tool for investigating the sleep/wake circadian
rhythm, is in our view a promising new line of research as of that complements the other
research approaches especially the large scale survey-based studies, pioneered by Roenneberg
et al [11–13].
In this study, we apply reality mining techniques to users’ call records in a mobile phone
communication network to study the dynamics of the users’ calling patterns by focusing on
the periods of low activity, i.e. when almost no calls are made. Users of the mobile phone net-
work typically have specific time periods during which their calling activity ceases, and we
may assume that the SWC is bounded inside this period of inactivity. We observe that the
daily calling activity time displays an interesting dynamics across the year through seasons and
along different geographical zones. By studying these patterns we can gain insights into
human activity patterns, and the SWC, in particular. Interestingly, the calling activity pattern
changes with the day of the year and it is found to depend also on the geographical location
(latitude and longitude of the mobile phone user). From the circadian clocks involved in the
daily rhythms of human societies, only those entrained to solar-based events depend also on
the geographical location and on the day of the year.
In this work, we use mobile phone calling activity at the population level to study how the
onset and termination of the urban human activity in different cities is synchronized with the
East-West progression of the Sun. Also, we analyzed the annual progression of the onset and
termination of the calling activity, finding that they show a strong seasonal variation. We note
that this behavior is similar to the annual dynamics of solar midnight, inferring that solar mid-
night is an important cue entraining the human circadian clock. Finally, we determine the
mid-time of the period of low calling activity, which is bounded between the termination of
calling activity each day and its onset on the next day. We interpret this mid-time to corre-
spond to the mid-sleep time, and show that it is strongly dependent on the age and gender of
the individuals in the population.
Results
Using an anonymized dataset containing details of mobile phone communication of subscrib-
ers of a particular operator in a European country described in detail in the Methods section,
we investigate the calling activity of the urban population living in cities as a function of time
of the day for all the dates during the year. This we do by calculating for each city the probabil-
ity distribution Pall(t, d) for finding an outgoing call at time t of a day d = (1,. . .,365) of the
year. For all the studied cities, a region of almost null activity can be found around 4:00 am.
Using this natural bound to split the calling activity from one day to another, we define a ‘day’
starting from 4:00am of a calendar day and running to 3:59am of the next calendar day.
In Fig 1 we show Pall(t, d) (green line) during days d = 214−215 (marking early August) for
a city with over a 500,000 inhabitants. The distribution Pall(t, d) has two high calling activity
periods with the first one corresponding to the morning calls, peaking around noon, and the
second related to the evening calls, peaking around 8:00 pm. This bimodal pattern is present
every day across the year and all the cities included in this study. The high calling activity peri-
ods are delimited by two periods of low activity, one centered around 4:00 pm related to the
time after lunch, and the second one in the middle of the night, around 4:00 am within the
sleeping period. The pattern present in Pall(t, d) is similar to that reported in other studies
using different CDRs [29, 36], mainly at the times when the calling activity starts and ceases.

 In ref. [29], where the calling activity of some Spanish cities was studied, the histogram of the
number of active users at each time has a similar bimodal shape, with similar times for their
onset and termination, as well as the depth in the middle located around the same time period
(i.e. between 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm).
To study the specific times when the calling activity rises and falls, we analyze the ‘morning’
and ‘night’ periods separately, defining the former between 5:00 am and 3:59 pm, and latter
between 5:00 pm and 3:59 am on the following calendar day, in such a way that each period is
11 hours long. During each ‘morning’, we select only the first call made by each user inside
that period and construct the associated probability distribution for the time of the first call
PF(t, d), directly related to the rise of calling activity. Similarly, during the ‘night’ we define the
corresponding probability distribution for the time of the last call PL(t, d) by taking into
account only the last call made by each user within that period. In Fig 1, it can be seen that the
three defined probability distributions Pall(t, d) (green), PL(t, d) (red), and PF(t, d) (blue) for
consecutive days during winter, for a particular city with a population over a 500,000. The
shape of the distributions Pall(t, d), PL(t, d), and PF(t, d) depicted in Fig 1 for a specific day
appear to be preserved for all the days and cities we have studied.
Urban activity synchronization with East-West sun progression
The mean time of the first call tF and of the last call tL of people in a city can be influenced by
environmental, social, and economic factors, and their possible daily value could be distributed
completely at random. However, we find that during the year and at different latitudes, despite
the different factors influencing the shape of the distribution Pall, the onset and termination of
calling activity follows a consistent pattern, and this characteristic behaviour allows us to

 compare the calling activity pattern of cities lying at different latitudes. If the onset or termina-
tion of the urban calling activity is socially driven, with fixed times for specific activities (like
office working hours from 9:00am to 6:00pm), one could expect that cities lying in the same
time zone and at the same latitudes have similar calling activity timings (onset and termina-
tion). However, we find that the onset and termination of calling activity synchronizes with
the East-West sun progression, in such a way that cities lying in western locations start (and
terminate) their calling activity after cities at eastern locations, with a delay difference corre-
sponding to the time difference between their local meridians. In Fig 2A and 2B we show tL
and tF for 5 different cities lying inside a latitudinal band centered at 42˚N±400. The region
including the 5 cities spans a longitudinal angle of 10.8˚, and by taking one of the cities as a ref-
erence, other cities are located at −7.8˚, −4.7˚, −3.7˚, and +3.0˚ from the reference city marked
here with 0.0˚. Then we compare the actual distributions PL and PF of the time of the last call
and of the first call, respectively, for the 5 cities in the same latitudinal band, and find that PL
and PF for western cities seem shifted to later times. However, when the distributions are
shifted by an amount of time corresponding exactly with the time difference between the local
meridian of the corresponding city and the reference city, the distributions visibly collapse
onto each other, as can be seen in Fig 2C and 2D. In this case, the time shifts are +31.2,
+18.8, +14.8, and -12 minutes for the cities located at -7.7˚, -4.7˚, -3.7˚, and +3˚ from the refer-
ence city at 0˚, respectively.

different cities lying at the same latitude but at different relative longitudes from a reference point located at
the second city from east to west within the band for two consecutive days during the year. The relative
longitudes of the cities are -7.8˚, -4.7˚, -3.7˚, 0˚, and +3˚. (Upper panel) Probability distributions for (A) the time
of the last call, and (B) the time of first call. (Lower panel) Probability distributions for (C) the time of the last

transit times (31.2, 18.8, 14.8, and -12 minutes for the cities located at -7.8˚, -4.7˚, -3.7˚, and +3˚ from the
reference city, respectively). The collapse of the distributions onto the reference city’s distribution is evident
when the longitudinal time shift is added. This collapse implies that the 5 cities begin (or cease) their calling
activity in a way that is synchronized with a temporal phase corresponding to the difference between their sun
transit times.

 The distribution collapse shown in Fig 2 is obtained by introducing a time shift correspond-
ing to the sun transit differences between cities. In order to quantify the exact delay between
the distributions, we calculate the required time shift that should be introduced between the
calling distributions to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence DKL between them (see the
Methods section). This measure is indicative of the similarity between the distributions, and is
minimized when they are identical. We extend this analysis to include data from 30 cities, each
one lying in one of the four latitudinal bands centered at 37˚N (10 cities), 39.5˚N (5 cities),
41.5˚N (7 cities), and 42.5˚N (8 cities). For each band, we choose one city lying near the mid
point of the band as the reference, and calculate for all the cities in the band the average time
shift between them and the reference city. This is done for each day of the week, averaging
over 52 weeks of the year 2007. The results are shown in Fig 3, and it can be seen that the time
shift that minimizes the divergence between the distributions corresponds to the delay
between their local sun transit times. This synchronization appears stronger for the termina-
tion of the calling activity (represented by the distributions PL). As this pattern is consistently
present in all of the four analyzed latitudinal bands, we conclude that it is a general behaviour
of the population living in the cities. This result is consistent with those reported by Roenne-
berg et al. [12], obtained from MCTQ studies of people in Germany, distributed over a region
that is 9˚ wide longitudinally. In their work, they take into account the population of the city
by defining three population size categories, i.e. less than 300,000 inhabitants, between 300,000
and 500,000 inhabitants, and more than 500,000 inhabitants, while we classify each city of
more than 100,000 inhabitants according to its latitudinal coordinate. Grouping the cities into
latitudinal bands, we found a consistent entrainment to the East-West progression of the Sun,
regardless of the population size of each city.
This result implies that the termination (last call of the day) and onset (first call of the next
day) of calling activities in cities at similar latitudes follow an external cue driven by solar
events, and the time difference in these solar events between two different cities is reflected in
the timings of their calling activity.
Entrainment of urban calling activity with sun-based cues
We have shown that the cities located at the same latitude but at different longitudes have peri-
ods of low calling activity with different onset and termination times (Figs 2 and 3). This shift
coincides with the difference between their local sun transit times, i.e. when the sun crosses the
meridian of the city. This observation raises the question as to what external daily event
induces such synchronization. As the delays correspond to the time period between the local
sun transit times of the cities, it seems plausible to think that the sun functions as a cue for this
entrainment.
At the latitudes where the studied cities are located, the time difference between the sunset
in the summer and in the winter is around 3 hours, if daylight saving is not taken into account,
and the same holds for the time difference between sunrises. In contrast, the time difference
between the mean time of the last calls between summer and winter is at most one hour [33].
However, there is a clear synchronization between the sun transit time and the timings of call-
ing activity. This means that there should be an external clock functioning as a cue. On the
other hand, from a biological perspective, the time when the secretion of melatonin reaches its
maximum [37] lies close to midpoint between sunset and sunrise (i.e. solar midnight), once
the night is as dark as possible. It has been proposed that the mid-sleep time coincides with the
time corresponding to maximum melatonin secretion [38, 39], and if the solar midnight shifts
through the year, the time for the maximum melatonin secretion should follow a similar pat-
tern, as well as the entrained mid-sleep time.

is required to collapse the distributions.

 In their study, Allenbradt et al. [40], using the MCTQ approach, have reported that mid-
sleep time (on free-days) changes from one season to another. In some of the studied popula-
tions, they found that there is a small but significant difference in the average mid-sleep time
between the days when Daylight Saving Time is applied and other days. This lends support to
our assumption that if the mid-sleep time shifts in response to seasons, the timings of the call-
ing activity should be influenced by its variation. In such a case, when the human mid-sleep
time occurs at later hours, the timings of the calling activity for the following days should also
occur at later hours. In other seasons, when the mid-sleep time occurs earlier, the activity tim-
ings should also be shifted towards earlier hours. If this is the case, then solar midnight should
be functioning as the cue to which the calling activity timings are entrained. The activity pat-
tern is a consequence of the interplay between seasonal and geographical factors, as well as
social and societal activities like work and/or school, transportation, eating and leisure activi-
ties. However, the latter require specific timings during the day, not necessarily controlled by
the sleep/wake cycle. We have shown elsewhere [33] that the total period of low calling activity
(that is, the period between the termination and the onset of the calling activity) is strongly
correlated with the duration of daylight, showing seasonal changes similar to the mid-sleep
time.
In order to find any possible synchronization between the onset (and termination) of call-
ing activity and solar midnight, we calculate the average of the mean times of the last call �
t L
and that of the first call �
tF, for three sets of cities located at the latitudinal bands ϕ = 37˚300N
(seven cities), 40˚200N (six cities), and 43˚00N (eight cities). We compare �
tL, and �
tF with the
yearly evolution of the solar midnight in a reference city within a given latitudinal band (see
Fig 4). A detailed description of how �
tL and �
tF are calculated can be found in the Methods sec-
tion. It can be seen that only �
tL resembles to some extent the dynamics of the solar midnight,
with their two minima and at least one of their maxima occurring around the same days of
those of solar midnight, although the relative amplitudes are not in correspondence. In addi-
tion, the discontinuities introduced by the daylight saving is visible in all the graphs, suggesting
that the timings of the calling activity are not solely influenced by the socially-driven time, but
instead are synchronized with an external (astronomical) clock.
Age and gender dependence of the mid-sleep times
The period of low calling activity is bounded by the mean times of the last call during the night
and of the first call in the morning. The duration of this period changes across seasons [33]
and is strongly influenced by the length of the day (or conversely by the length of the night).
The mid-time of this low calling activity period should correspond to the average time of
human low activity, i.e. when the majority of the urban population is sleeping. In chronobiol-
ogy studies, the mid-sleep time, corresponding to the time when human sleep is in the middle
of its cycle, has been found to vary with the age and gender of the individuals [11, 41]. Despite
the fact that each individual has a distinctive sleep-wake cycle, with a chronotype ranging from
advanced sleep period (morningness) to delayed sleep period (eveningness) [42], at the popu-
lation level a characteristic mid-sleep time can be consistently calculated, taken simply as the
average of individual mid-sleep times.
From the mean times of the last call of the day, tL and of the first call tF of the next day, we
define the period of low calling activity TLCA as the elapsed time between tL and tF, as a mea-
sure of the time when cities cease their activity. In Fig 5a, the width of the low activity period
TLCA of the most populated city in the dataset is shown, for 4 different days of the week (Tues-
days, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays), as a function of the subscribers’ age and gender. There
is a noticeable change of about 3 hours, moving from the age cohort of 20 to that of 40 year

 olds. After that rather abrupt increase, especially for Fridays and Saturdays, TLCA slightly
decreases, reaching a local minimum value for the age cohort of 50 year olds, and then it
increases again to reach the highest value at the age of 78 years. For the analyzed weekday
(Tuesday) as well as for Sunday, TLCA increases almost monotonically with the cohort age,
showing a small plateau for age cohorts between 45 and 58.
We have also tracked the midpoint of the inactivity period, defined as the mid-time
between tL and tF. Due to its similarity with the average time in the middle of the sleeping
period [41], we interpret this minimum calling activity time as the mid-sleep time tmid, calcu-
lated simply as tmid = (tL + tF − 24)/2. Both quantities are found to depend on the age and gen-
der of each cohort, as can be seen in Fig 5b. We find that, for certain age groups (from 18 to 32
years old, and from 43 to 80 years old) tmid occurs at a later time for women as compared to
men, while in the age group of 33 to 42 years old, tmid for the men occur later. This finding dif-
fers somewhat from the reported mid-sleep times (on free days) in the chronotype question-
naire study based on the MCTQ [11, 13], where males show a later mid-sleep time for age
cohorts younger than 38 years old. Also, there is a strong dependence on age, with younger age
cohorts (20–30 year old) having later tmid, i.e. around 30 minutes after that of the oldest age
cohort (70-80 years old). This observation is in accordance with the observed chronotypes
[41], which are attributed to biological factors or internal clock being regulated by neuronal
and hormonal mechanisms. We also found an unexpected rise of tmid for the age cohort of

activity is not solely influenced by the socially-driven time, but is synchronized with an external (astronomical)
event. The number of cities inside the bands ϕ = 37˚300N (blue), 40˚200N (green), and 43˚00N (red), are 7, 6,
and 8, respectively.

 45–65 year old individuals, which we suspect is entirely of social origin. Hence it seems that
both biological and social factors play a role in changing tmid, i.e. shifting the period of low
activity to later hours.
In addition, we find that tmid varies across days of the week. On Fridays and Saturdays tmid
occurs at a later hours compared with the other days. Similarly, the age cohort with the latest
mid-sleep time tmid is different for different days of the week. On Saturdays, individuals in the
age group 30 to 45 years old have the latest tmid, while for the other days of the week it is the
20–25 years old cohort which shows the latest mid-sleep time. The results of TLCA and tmid for
the most populated city are also and consistently found in the next 5 most populated cities, as
shown in the Supplementary Material (S1 and S2 Figs, respectively).
Discusion
In this study, we have found that the onset and termination of the period of low calling activity
for people in cities at about the same latitude but at different longitudes are shifted according
to their relative longitudinal separation. Cities westward from the easternmost analyzed city
stop their activity later in line with the time delay of the sun transit time. This result suggests
that a solar event acts as a cue for the circadian rhythm of the period of low calling activity
with the SWC bounded inside. This result is consistent with those reported by Roenneberg

Period of low calling activity TLCA. The TLCA is calculated as the elapsed time between the mean time of the
last call and that of the first call, as a function of the age and gender of different cohorts, for the most populated
city in the dataset in 2007. (b) mid-sleep time tmid, calculated as the time in the middle of the interval between
the mean time of the last call and that of the first call, as a function of the age and gender of different cohorts of
the same city. For each age cohort, TLCA and tmid are calculated for females (circles) and males (triangles)
separately. Both quantities are different for different days of the week, and the corresponding plots are shown
for (green) Tuesdays, (red) Fridays, (blue) Saturdays, and (violet) Sundays. As Mondays to Thursdays have
similar values, therefore only the data for Tuesdays is shown.

 et al. [12], although strictly speaking the two studies cannot be compared directly as the focus
of our study is on variation by latitude and theirs was on variation by population size of cities.
In addition, we found that the seasonal variation of the termination of calling activity
resembles the annual variation in solar midnight (or solar noon). However, when the annual
behaviour of activity termination is compared with other characteristic solar events like the
sunrise and sunset, it appears to have a different functional form with different number of
maxima and minima with different dates. Although, it seems likely that solar midnight (or
solar noon) acts as a cue in the synchronization of the termination of the calling activity, fur-
ther research is needed to confirm this. At the individual level, knowledge of the mid-sleep
time and sleep duration allows the determination an individual’s chronotype [16]. However, at
the population level, we could determine from the calling distributions the characteristic varia-
tion in the sleep duration and mid-sleep time as a function of the group age. The observed
overall trends are in line with the earlier findings [41] and reveal an increase in the sleep dura-
tion and decline in the mid-sleep time with age. Several other intricacies are also evidenced at
closer inspection. Firstly, the aspect of ‘social jetlag’ [43], defined as the difference between the
mid-sleep times on free days and that of work days, becomes apparent across all age groups.
Interestingly, although social jet-lag is expected to give rise to extended sleep duration on free
days as a compensatory effect, for young adults (20–25) we find that the sleeping periods are
comparatively less on free days (Friday and Saturday nights and the following mornings).
Therefore, sleep deprivation is likely to be at a maximum for this age range. Second, previous
observations suggest a monotonic decrease in the mid-sleep time from around 20 years of age,
which can be attributed to endocrine factors [41]. In contrast, we observe a reversal in trend of
the mid-sleep time such that at the age of 45 years it starts rising till 55 years of age, after which
it decrease again.
Materials and methods
In this study, we have analyzed a very large dataset of anonymized call detail records (CDRs)
from a mobile phone service provider offering services in a a country located in the Southern
Europe subregion of the United Nations geoscheme [44]. Due to a Non Disclosure Agreement
associated to the dataset we are bound to keep the identity of the country unknown, and thus
we have partially masked the latitude and Longitude coordinates of the cities to screen their
actual location, such that each city is associated with a latitudinal band, and the latitude at the
center of the band is assigned as the latitude of the city. In the analyses, depending on the mea-
sure we were focusing on, we chose the width and center of the latitudinal bands and in all
cases specifying the corresponding values. The latitude coordinate associated with each band is
described by ϕ ± dϕ, with ϕ the latitude in degrees at the center of the band, and dϕ the half-
width of the band in degrees. On the other hand, as the latitudinal region is given, the Longi-
tude coordinate is also screened by providing instead its angular separation from, an arbitrary
point located in the same latitudinal band. Thus, for a given city, its longitude coordinate
θ denotes the number of degrees from a reference point located in the same latitudinal band.
The anonymization of the subscribers’ identities was performed by the service provider prior
the data been given to us. The dataset contains CDRs of around 10,000,000 subscribers during
2007, with more than 3 billion calls between 50,000,000 unique identifiers. Each record con-
tains the date, time, duration, and anonymized caller and callee identifiers. The dataset also
includes demographic information of the majority of the subscribers, and, for those cases, the
age, gender, postal code, and location of the most accessed cell tower (MAC-tower) are
known. Thus, there are three possible locations associated to each user, namely the associated
city center, the location of the MAC-tower and the center of the postal code region, and we use

 them to determine whether the subscriber “lives in a city”—defined by cases where their three
associated locations are sufficiently close to each others. Taking as a reference point the geo-
graphical location of the associated city center, a subscriber lives there if the following three
conditions are satisfied:
1. the distance between the location of the MAC-tower and the associated city’s center is less
than 15 km
2. the distance between the center of the associated postal code region and the associated city’s
center is less than 15 km
3. the distance between the location of MAC-tower and the center of associated postal code
region is less than 30 km.
In this study, we chose 36 of the cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in 2007 (see
S3 Fig in the Supplementary Material), in such a way that our final analysis takes into account
the calling patterns of around 1,000,000 subscribers in total. Locations of the subscribers are
associated with the locations of the cities they reside. Each city is associated with the following
two geographical coordinates: the latitudinal coordinate is fixed as the midpoint of a latitudinal
band including the city, and the longitudinal coordinate, defined as the angular distance
between the city and a reference point located in the studied region.
Quantifying delays between calling activity timings
Calling behavior varies seasonally, particularly the mean value and the width of the distribu-
tions of the first and last call vary across the year, being pushed towards the afternoon during
winter and towards midnight during the summer. In spite of this seasonal variation, for a
given day the calling distributions of different cities have similar shapes, and we exploit this
similarity to calculate the delays between them to identify the temporal shifts of the distribu-
tions. The Kullback-Leibler divergence [45] is a measure of similarity between two distribu-
tions, commonly used in statistical analysis, for example when comparing one distribution
obtained from data and another generated by a model. It reaches zero, its minimum possible
value, when the distributions are identical, and it increases in value as the distributions become
more and more dissimilar. In the case of the calling activity of different cities, the distributions
are not identical but have a very similar shape. Applying Kullback-Leibler divergence to a pair
of these distributions, it would reach a minimum value when these distributions overlap most,
falling on top of each other and collapse to one. Thus, if we measure the amount of time one
distribution should be shifted in order to minimize its divergence from the second distribu-
tion. The time shift would correspond the actual time delay between them.
In order to quantify the actual time shift between the distributions PL of last calls for
cities lying along different Longitudes, we proceed as follows. First, for all the cities within the
band, we calculate all the distributions PL(t, d) between January 2nd and December 31st.
For each day d, we fix PL(t, d)0˚ of the city labeled ‘0˚’ as the reference distribution, and for
every other city c in the band, we compared the reference PL(t, d)0˚ with time-shifted versions
PL(t + nΔ, d)c of the distribution PL(t, d)c, with −5 � n � 8 and Δ = 5 min, to find the time shift
n�Δ that minimizes the divergence DKL between them. Here, DKL is the Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence measure, defined as DKL(P, Q) = ∑i Pi log(Pi/Qi), with P, Q being the two discrete distri-
butions. Once we find for each city the set {n�Δ} with all the time-shifts across the year, we
calculate its average time-shift hn�Δi, and plot it for all the cities in the band in the right col-
umn of Fig 3. As the time for the mean time of the last call is different for different days of the
week [33], the average is calculated separately for each day of the week. We apply the same

 procedure for the time of the first call distributions PF, and the results are shown in the left col-
umn of Fig 3.
Averaging the mean times of the calling activity inside a latitudinal band
In order to find if there is any relation between tL and tF and the solar midnight, we have cho-
sen 7, 6 and 8 cities, lying in the latitudinal bands centered at ϕ = 37˚300 N, 40˚200 N, and 43˚00
N, respectively. For each city, we shift its corresponding distributions in accordance with its
longitudinal difference to collapse all into one. Then we calculate the average mean time of the
last call, �
tLðdÞ ¼ h�
t0
Lðd; cÞi, where, �
t0
Lðd; cÞ denotes the mean time of the last call for the shifted
distribution for a city c belonging to the analyzed band during the day d, and h�i denotes the
average over all cities lying within the band. Similarly, we calculate the average mean time of
the first call �
tFðdÞ for the given latitudinal band. The quantities �
t LðdÞ and �
tFðdÞ are compared
with the time at which the solar midnight occurs in the reference city of each band. It should
be noted that in the original graphs there are days of national holidays and local festivities that
introduce drastic pattern changes, which we filter out to construct the final graphs.

calculated as the elapsed time between the mean time of the last call and of the first call, as a
function of the age and gender of different cohorts, for the six most populated city in the data-
set in 2007. For each age cohort, TLCA is calculated for females (circles) and males (triangles)
separately. TLCA is different for different days of the week, and the corresponding plots are
shown for (green) Tuesdays, (red) Fridays, (blue) Saturdays, and (violet) Sundays. Mondays to
Thursdays have similar values, therefore only the data for Tuesdays is shown.

S2 Fig. Mid-sleep time tmid for different age and gender cohorts. tmid is calculated as the
time at middle of the interval between the mean time of the last call and of the first call, as a
function of the age and gender of different cohorts, for six of the seven most populated cities in
the dataset in 2007. For each age cohort, tmid is calculated for females (circles) and males (trian-
gles) separately. tmid is different for different days of the week, and the corresponding plots are
shown for (green) Tuesdays, (red) Fridays, (blue) Saturdays, and (violet) Sundays. Mondays to
Thursdays have similar values, therefore only the data for Tuesdays is shown. During some
Fridays nights, the calling activity extended until very late in the night, and the distribution of
the morning calling activity on the next day presents a small peak around 4:00 a.m. If present,
we include this peak in the analysis when calculating the time of the first call, due to its small
amplitude and width compared with the main part of the distribution for the time of the first
call. This is also true for the results shown in Fig 5 in the main text.
