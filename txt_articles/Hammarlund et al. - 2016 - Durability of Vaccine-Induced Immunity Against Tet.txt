Background.
Many adult immunization schedules recommend that tetanus and diphtheria vaccination be performed every 10
years. In light of current epidemiological trends of disease incidence and rates of vaccine-associated adverse events, the 10-year re-
vaccination schedule has come into question.
Methods.
We performed cross-sectional analysis of serum antibody titers in 546 adult subjects stratified by age or sex. All sero-
logical results were converted to international units after calibration with international serum standards.
Results.
Approximately 97% of the population was seropositive to tetanus and diphtheria as defined by a protective serum an-
tibody titer of ≥0.01 IU/mL. Mean antibody titers were 3.6 and 0.35 IU/mL against tetanus and diphtheria, respectively. Antibody
responses to tetanus declined with an estimated half-life of 14 years (95% confidence interval, 11–17 years), whereas antibody re-
sponses to diphtheria were more long-lived and declined with an estimated half-life of 27 years (18–51 years). Mathematical models
combining antibody magnitude and duration predict that 95% of the population will remain protected against tetanus and diphtheria
for ≥30 years without requiring further booster vaccination.
Conclusions.
These studies demonstrate that durable levels of protective antitoxin immunity exist in the majority of vaccinated
individuals. Together, this suggests that it may no longer be necessary to administer booster vaccinations every 10 years and that the
current adult vaccination schedule for tetanus and diphtheria should be revisited.

Vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria has resulted in a sig-
nificant decline in the incidence of these 2 serious diseases.
Deaths attributable to tetanus have declined by 99% since the
prevaccine era, and diphtheria is virtually nonexistent in the
United States despite as many as approximately 21 000 cases
and approximately 1800 diphtheria-related deaths recorded
each year before introduction of routine vaccination [1].
These vaccines have a long safety history, but nevertheless,
50%–85% of patients experience injection site pain or tender-
ness, and 25%–30% experience edema and erythema [2].Higher
preexisting anti-tetanus antibody levels are also associated with
higher reactogenicity of greater severity [2]. Anaphylaxis after
tetanus vaccination represents a rare but potentially serious ad-
verse event, with an incidence of 1.6 cases per million distribu-
ted doses [3]. Concerns about vaccine-associated adverse events
when immunizations were performed at short intervals led to
revision of the tetanus/diphtheria vaccination schedule in
1966 to once every 10 years for patients >6 years of age [4, 5].
Understanding the durability of vaccine-induced immunity
is critical for making informed decisions on the recommended
time interval between booster vaccinations. In longitudinal
studies involving 7 [6] or 45 [7] subjects, tetanus-specific anti-
bodies declined with a half-life of 11 years (95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 10–16) [7]. Likewise, longitudinal analysis indicated
that diphtheria-specific antibody titers declined with a half-life
of 19 years (95% CI, 14–33) [7]. Although these studies provid-
ed provocative details indicating that immunity to tetanus and
diphtheria could be long-lived, the number of subjects followed
up was too small to inform clinical decisions on the overall pro-
portion of persons who have antibody titers above a protective
threshold or the duration of serological immunity that may exist
in the context of a broader population. Although many coun-
tries, including the United States [8] and Canada [9], continue
to recommend booster vaccination every 10 years, the United
Kingdom recommends no adult booster vaccinations after the
initial 5-dose childhood immunization series [10]. The safety
and success of more moderate European vaccination programs
with longer intervals between booster vaccinations [10–13] in-
dicate that the current 10-year booster vaccination schedule
should be reexamined. In the current study, we measured the
magnitude and duration of immunity to these vaccine antigens
to determine whether antibody responses declined more rapidly
in an aged population and to provide an evidence-based evalu-
ation of current tetanus and diphtheria vaccine programs.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and Study Design
Subjects (n = 546) were recruited from 2002 to 2008 (526 in
2002–2004) to study the duration of immunity after vaccination
against smallpox [14], tetanus and diphtheria. Further details
are provided in the Supplementary Data. All studies were ap-
proved by the institutional review board of Oregon Health &
Science University.
Analysis of Toxin-Specific Antibody Titers
Tetanus and diphtheria toxin-specific antibodies were measured
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [7, 14],
double-antigen tetanus ELISA [15],or diphtheria neutralization
assays [16] after calibration with international serum standards
(see Supplementary Data).
Statistics
The duration of antibody-mediated protection by cross-section-
al analysis was examined with a regression model using diph-
theria- or tetanus-specific antibody levels at >1 year after
vaccination as the dependent variable and time after vaccination
(years) as the independent variable in the following equation:
log(antibody titer) = α + β * years + ε, where α represents mean
log titer at time of vaccination; β, decay rate or average log titer
change per year; and ε, error term. In this model, the half-life is
independent of the reference time point and is estimated as log
(0.5)/β. For longitudinal analysis, we used the random intercept
and slope model to account for correlated errors within the
same individual subject, as described elsewhere [7]. Statistical
analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System soft-
ware (SAS; version 9.3), with further details provided in the
Supplementary Data.
RESULTS
Magnitude and Duration of Immunity to Tetanus
Tetanus vaccines became commercially available in the United
States in 1938, but routine vaccination was not widely practiced
until the mid-1940s [2]. To determine the magnitude and per-
sistence of tetanus-specific antibody responses in contemporary
populations, we measured the levels of immunity as a function
of age (Figure 1A) or time after vaccination (Figure 1B). In ge-
neral, tetanus-specific antibody levels were high, averaging 3.6
IU/mL for the total population, and there was no significant dif-
ference (P = .36) in titers between men and women (3.89 and
3.46 IU/mL, respectively) (Table 1). In terms of protective im-
munity, 99% of subjects <60 years of age (and 97% of the overall
population) demonstrated tetanus-specific antibody responses
above the protective level of 0.01 IU/mL.
We next determined the half-life of tetanus-specific antibody
as a function of time after last vaccination (Figure 1B). The
overall half-life was found to be 14 years (95% CI, 11–17).
There was no significant difference (P = .59) in antibody
decay rates between men and women (half-life, 14 and 13
years, respectively) (Table 1). The duration of protective immu-
nity is a function of the magnitude of the serum antibody re-
sponse and the time it takes for antibody titers to decline to
nonprotective levels. Based on these parameters, the model pre-
dicts that 95% of the population will remain seroprotected
against tetanus for up to 72 years without further booster vac-
cination (Figure 1B). In a previous longitudinal study, the teta-
nus-specific antibody half-life was estimated to be 11 years [7].
If this more conservative antibody half-life is applied to the cur-
rent population-based data set, we find that 95% of the subjects
will remain seroprotected for 64 years without requiring further
vaccination.
Magnitude and Duration of Immunity to Diphtheria
In contrast to tetanus, diphtheria represents a communicable
disease and although relatively rare in developed countries, it
is believed that vaccine coverage of 80%–85% must be main-
tained to reduce the threat of an outbreak [17]. Diphtheria tox-
oid is commonly administered as a combined vaccine with
tetanus toxoid and we measured the duration of immunity to
diphtheria to determine if protective levels of immunological
memory were similar to that observed for tetanus (Figure 2).
The mean antibody titer to diphtheria was 0.35 IU/mL, and
there were no significant differences (P = .23) in titers between
men and women (0.31 and 0.37 IU/mL, respectively) (Table 1).
Approximately 99% of subjects <60 years of age (and 97% of the
overall population) showed diphtheria-specific antibody re-
sponses that were above the protective level of 0.01 IU/mL.
Based on analysis of antibody levels as a function of time after
vaccination (Figure 2B), we found that diphtheria-specific im-
munity declined with a 27-year half-life (95% CI, 18–51
years) (Table 1). Although the overall antibody levels to diph-
theria were lower than observed with tetanus, the antibody re-
sponse to diphtheria showed a longer half-life, and 95% of the
population is predicted to maintain seroprotection for 42 years
without requiring further booster vaccination (Figure 2B).
Diphtheria-specific antibody was shown elsewhere to have a
19-year half-life when measured longitudinally [7], and if this
half-life is applied to the data set, 95% of adults are predicted
to remain seroprotected for 30 years without additional booster
vaccinations.
Impact of Age on Serological Memory to Tetanus and Diphtheria
Potential age-associated defects in immunological function rep-
resent an important parameter when measuring herd immunity
because this may alter the interpretation of the data set and the
levels of protective immunity within a given cohort. Of the 13
subjects lacking tetanus-specific immunity (<0.01 IU/mL), 11
of 13 (85%) were >60 years old (mean age, 69 years; median,
70 years; range, 36–86 years). Likewise, of the 17 subjects lack-
ing diphtheria-specific immunity (<0.01 IU/mL), 14 of 17
(82%) were >60 years old (mean age 67 years; median, 68
years; range, 25–86 years). Four subjects (aged 58, 61, 80, and

 86 years) lacked immunity to both toxins. These results indicate
that individuals older than 60 years have an increased likelihood
of low immunity to tetanus or diphtheria.
When stratified by age, cross-sectional analysis (Figures 1A
and 2A) indicated that older subjects (age, ≥50 years) had
lower antibody titers to tetanus and diphtheria than younger

based on an estimated 11-year half-life [7] and indicates that 95% of the population will remain protected against tetanus for 64 years after vaccination.

 subjects (age, <50 years) (Table 2), and this is consistent with
findings of prior studies [18, 19]. To determine whether differ-
ences in antitoxin immunity were due to more rapid antibody
decay rates in older individuals, we used cross-sectional analysis
to compare antibody half-life estimates between subjects <50
years and those ≥50 years of age (Table 2). Tetanus-specific an-
tibody decay rates were essentially the same in the younger and
older age groups (half-life [95% CI], 11 [8–20] and 14 [10–20]
years, respectively; P = .11). Similar results were observed when
comparing subjects aged <60 (n = 407) or ≥60 (n = 133) years
(half-life [95% CI], 15 [11–24] vs 16 [11–26] years).
When the durability of immunity against diphtheria was
compared, antibody half-life was also similar between individ-
uals <50 or ≥50 years of age (half-life [95% CI], 24 [12 years to
∞] and 30 [18–84] years, respectively), although the modest in-
crease in antibody half-life among older subjects was statisti-
cally significant (P = .02). Diphtheria-specific immunity was
also long-lived among subjects <60 or ≥60 years of age (half-
life [95% CI], 23 [13–76] vs 57 [23 to ∞]). Together, these re-
sults indicate that serological memory to these 2 bacterial toxins
does not decay faster in older populations.
DISCUSSION
We examined the levels and duration of serological memory
after vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria toxins in a
cross-sectional analysis of >500 adults. Protective levels of anti-
toxin antibodies were observed in 99% of subjects <60 years old
(approximately 97% of the total all-age population), and
vaccine-induced antibody responses declined with estimated
half-lives of 14 years for tetanus and 27 years for diphtheria.
Mathematical analysis of the magnitude and decay rate of anti-
toxin antibody responses predicts that 95% of the adult popu-
lation remain protected for ≥30 years after vaccination.
Serosurveys conducted with samples obtained >20 years
ago in the United States indicated that only about 58% [20],
70% [18] or 72% [19] of adults had protective immunity to
tetanus, and only 51%–61% showed protective immunity to
diphtheria [19, 20]. One key difference between these prior
publications and our current study is the working definition
of protective immunity. In prior studies [18–20], a protective
antibody titer was defined as ≥0.15 IU/mL for tetanus and
≥0.10 IU/mL for diphtheria [19, 20]. These threshold values
are likely to underestimate the levels of protection because stud-
ies in humans and animal models have shown that 0.01 IU/mL
is a protective level of immunity for tetanus [2, 21–23] or
diphtheria [17, 24–26]. For comparison with prior serosurveys
[18–20], if we use ≥0.15 IU/mL as the protective threshold for
tetanus and ≥0.10 IU/mL for diphtheria, we found that 96% of
the population would be protected against tetanus, and 69%
against diphtheria.
These proportions of protected individuals are higher than
observed in prior studies [18–20] performed with samples ob-
tained in the late 1980s and early 1990s but more comparable to
findings in recent studies showing similar durability of anti-
tetanus immunity among European American and African
American military personnel [27]. Interestingly, seroprotection
rates in Finland showed similar improvements over time [28];
the percentage of individuals with protective immunity to diph-
theria (0.01 IU/mL) within the 30–39-year age group increased
from 77% to 92% from the 1980s to the 1990s and further im-
proved to 98% protection in 2000–2001. This change was be-
lieved to be due to improved vaccination coverage during
these periods of time, and it highlights the importance of reeval-
uating population serostatus to different vaccines, which may
change over time in parallel with changes in vaccination policies
and improvements in vaccination coverage.
In concordance with prior epidemiological studies [18–20],
we found that immunity to tetanus and diphtheria was lower
in older subjects (Figures 1A and 2A; Table 2). These findings
could be due to a “cohort effect,” in which older subjects
born in the 1920s and 1930s (ie, before initiation of routine vac-
cination) may not have received the full childhood vaccination
series. Alternatively, lower antibody titers in older subjects
could result from age-related immune senescence in which
antibody responses decay more rapidly with advanced age.
We were able to examine this question in more detail by divid-
ing adults into 2 age groups and measuring antibody half-life
longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally (Table 2). This analy-
sis was informative because we discovered that the duration of
antitoxin immunity (ie, antibody half-life) was not affected by
age regardless of whether we measured immunity to tetanus or
to diphtheria or if we stratified the cohorts according to an age
cutoff of 50 or 60 years.
Tetanus is rare in the United States, with approximately 27
cases reported annually from 2008 to 2012 [29]. Although tet-
anus is highly lethal in unvaccinated patients, disease severity is
sharply reduced in fully vaccinated individuals [2, 30–33]. Of
124 cases of tetanus, all 14 deaths occurred in patients who
had received <3 doses of vaccine or had unknown vaccination
status, whereas all 110 patients (100%) who received ≥3 doses of

Immunity Against Tetanus and Diphtheria • CID 2016:62 (1 May) • 1115

 tetanus is exceedingly rare, with a mortality rate of approxi-
mately 3 deaths per year among a population of >300 million.
Diphtheria is nearly nonexistent in the United States, with no
cases reported from 2008 to 2012 [29]. This indicates that it is
less common than other rare reportable bacterial diseases, in-
cluding tularemia, plague, cholera, or anthrax [29]. Serious ad-
verse events after vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria are
uncommon, but anaphylaxis is estimated at 1.6 cases per mil-
lion doses, and brachial plexus neuropathy may occur at a
rate of 5–10 cases per million doses [3]. When multiplied by
an estimated 16 million doses of tetanus and diphtheria (Td)
vaccine administered annually in the United States [32], severe
adverse events include approximately 25 severe allergic events
and 80–160 cases of brachial plexus neuritis. Because overimmu-
nization provides a negligible increase in protection [32], this
suggests that the risk-benefit ratio of a decennial adult booster
vaccination schedule should be reexamined.
The data provided in this study indicate that adult booster
vaccination with Td every 10 years may no longer be necessary
to maintain protective immunity. Others have questioned the
decennial vaccination schedule [32, 34, 35], and countries
such as the United Kingdom do not vaccinate adults after
they have received their childhood vaccination series [10]. Al-
though the impact of advanced age was not determined, a re-
cent cross-sectional study performed in US military personnel
also found immunity to tetanus to be long-lived (antibody half-
life, 51.6 years) [27]. Indeed, the World Health Organization
recommends only a single booster to be given at the time of
first pregnancy or during military service [36]. If a revised
adult Td vaccination schedule were implemented, we believe
that a simplified age-based vaccination plan could be designed
to involve a single vaccination at age 30 years and again at age
60 years. By substituting tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular per-
tussis (Tdap) for Td at age 30 years, this would not affect the
currently recommended 1-time dose of Tdap for adults. Like-
wise, Tdap vaccination of pregnant women should be continued
as a preventive step toward protecting infants from Bordatella
pertussis. Vaccination of adults at age 60 years is important, be-
cause the majority of unprotected individuals reside within this
age group [2]. The current adult vaccination guidelines already
recommend varicella zoster virus vaccination at age 60–64
years, and it is possible that these 2 vaccines could be adminis-
tered on the same visit to further increase patient compliance.
The large diphtheria outbreaks that occurred in the former
Soviet Union in the 1990s provide several lessons on the impor-
tance of maintaining herd immunity through broad vaccination
coverage [37–39]. In the mid-1980s, diphtheria outbreaks that
occurred mainly in Russia ranged from 839 to nearly 2000
cases per year before reaching the peak of the epidemic in
1994–1995, with >98 000 cases and 3400 deaths reported in
the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union
[37]. Universal childhood immunization began in the late
1950s, but by the 1980s, the number of booster doses was re-
duced [37, 39], and with decreased public support of childhood
vaccination and a vocal antivaccine movement [39] coverage of
infants fell to between 60% and 80% or as low as 18%–59% in
some areas [38,39].In general, adult immunization was not rec-
ommended [37], and vaccine coverage was estimated at 20% in
1990 [38]. The combination of low vaccination coverage among
both children and adults resulted in a population that was sus-
ceptible to explosive outbreaks of diphtheria.
The circumstances leading to these large outbreaks in the for-
mer Soviet Union, however, are very different from those facing
the United States and many other developed nations today. In
contrast to hundreds of diphtheria cases reported each year in
the former Soviet Union in the pre-epidemic 1980s, only 5 cases
of diphtheria have been reported in the United States in the last
15 years [40]. Vaccination coverage of children is >90%, and if
antivaccine sentiment can be held in check through continued
education of healthcare workers and the general public, this
high level of herd immunity will be maintained. Likewise, unlike
the former Soviet Union in which there was a highly susceptible
unvaccinated adult population, our results show that approxi-
mately 97% of adults have protective levels of anti-diphtheria
antibodies (Figure 2A). Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional
analysis of antibody half-life (Tables 1 and 2) and a model of
booster vaccination every 30 years, protective immunity is pre-
dicted to remain at ≥95% (Figure 2B).
Modification of decennial Td vaccination may have a sub-
stantial impact on healthcare costs. Among adults aged 19–64
years, 63%–64% self-report that they comply with the decennial
Td revaccination schedule [41, 42]. Of 234 million adults (2010

age for comparison with the cross-sectional analysis.

 census), this would indicate that approximately 150 million
adults have been vaccinated within the last 10 years, or approx-
imately 15 million doses administered per year, similar to pre-
vious estimates [32].This is also in line with the number of adult
Td vaccine doses distributed by the CDC (eg, approximately
15.2 million doses distributed in 1998) [37]. At a cost of $28
per dose (CDC adult vaccine price list [43], this equals $420
million per year spent on adult Td booster vaccination. If this
were changed to a 30-year schedule, then the costs would be re-
duced by two-thirds, equating to a reduction of approximately
$280 million per year in healthcare costs (ie, >$1 billion in cost
savings within 4 years). As noted elsewhere [32], in addition to
substantial cost savings, other advantages of modifying the
adult Td booster vaccination interval include (1) improved
compliance with age-based recommendations and a simplified
age-specific vaccination schedule, (2) better acceptance of rec-
ommendations based on immunological and epidemiological
data and current risk-benefit analyses rather than conformity
to historical convention [32], and (3) reduction of vaccine-
associated adverse events owing to overimmunization.
