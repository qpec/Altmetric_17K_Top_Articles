Objective: Diet is increasingly recognized as a potentially 
modifiable factor influencing the onset and outcomes of 
psychiatric disorders. Whereas, previous research has 
shown long-term schizophrenia is associated with various 
nutritional deficiencies, this meta-analysis aimed to deter-
mine the prevalence and extent of nutritional deficits in 
first-episode psychosis (FEP). Method: A search of elec-
tronic databases conducted in July 2017 identified 28 eli-
gible studies, examining blood levels of 6 vitamins and 10 
minerals across 2612 individuals: 1221 individuals with 
FEP and 1391 control subjects. Meta-analyses compared 
nutrient levels in FEP to nonpsychiatric controls. Clinical 
correlates of nutritional status in patient samples were sys-
tematically reviewed. Results: Significantly lower blood 
levels of folate (N = 6, n = 827, g = −0.624, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] = −1.176 to −0.072, P = .027) and 
vitamin D (N = 7, n = 906, g = −1.055, 95% CI = −1.99 
to −0.119, P = .027) were found in FEP compared to 
healthy controls. Synthesis of clinical correlates found both 
folate and vitamin D held significant inverse relationships 
with psychiatric symptoms in FEP
. There was also limited 
evidence for serum level reductions of vitamin C (N = 2, 
n = 96, g = −2.207, 95% CI = −3.71 to −0.71, P = .004). 
No differences were found for other vitamins or minerals. 
Conclusions: Deficits in vitamin D and folate previously 
observed in long-term schizophrenia appear to exist from 
illness onset, and are associated with worse symptomology. 
Further research must examine the direction and nature of 
these relationships (ie, mediator, moderator, or marker) 
with clinical status in FEP
. Future trials assessing efficacy 
of nutrient supplementation in FEP samples should con-
sider targeting and stratifying for baseline deficiency.

Introduction
Nutritional deficiencies, resulting from insufficient intake 
or absorption of nutrients critical to human health, are 
now a recognized risk factor for psychiatric disorders.1,2 
For instance, excessive intake of nutritionally devoid 
foods is predictive of poor mental health,3 whereas a 
healthy diet reduces risk.4 Although previous research has 
focused on common mental disorders,1,5 recent attention 
has been drawn to the food intake of people with schizo-
phrenia—who may have the worst diet, poorest metabolic 
health, and greatest premature mortality across all severe 
mental illnesses.6–8
Blood levels of certain nutrients are also significantly 
reduced in psychiatric disorders. Folate (B9) and B12 are 
often deficient in schizophrenia,9,10 and be associated with 
symptom severity.11 Furthermore, B-vitamin supplemen-
tation can significantly reduce symptoms of schizophre-
nia12 and reverse some neurological deficits associated 
with the disorder.13 This is perhaps due to the neuropro-
tective properties of these nutrients,14 or the ability of B 
vitamins to lower homocysteine levels, which adversely

affect mental health.14,15 Antioxidant vitamins C and E 
are also reduced in long-term schizophrenia, potentially 
contributing to the elevated oxidative stress observed in 
this population.16
Additionally, vitamin D is implicated in schizophre-
nia onset, with a body of research showing develop-
mental deficiencies in vitamin D3 increase later risk.17–20 
Furthermore, vitamin D deficiencies persist over long-term 
illness and may be associated with worsened physical and 
mental health outcomes.21,22 Studies have also indicated 
that certain dietary minerals, such as zinc and selenium, 
are lowered in people with schizophrenia;23–25 as has been 
observed in other conditions such as depression.26,27 The 
direction of these nutrient/pathology associations how-
ever need to be clarified by prospective research.
Previous meta-analyses examining individual nutrient 
levels in individuals with long-term schizophrenia have 
shown clear deficits in B vitamins (folate28 and B1229), anti-
oxidant vitamins (C and E),16 and vitamin D.30 However, 
which nutritional deficiencies are present at the first epi-
sode of psychosis (FEP), independent of antipsychotic 
treatment, has yet to be determined. This is a particularly 
pertinent issue, given that diet quality appears reduced 
from psychosis onset,31,32 and inflammation and oxidative 
stress are highest at this point of illness16,33; both of which 
may be also linked to poor nutrition. Additionally, the FEP 
phase has been identified as a “critical period” as firstly it 
is the stage where the process of neuroprogression appears 
most active,34 and secondly for reducing physical health 
inequalities,35 as the initiation of antipsychotic treatment is 
associated with rapid weight gain and metabolic dysfunc-
tion.36 Therefore, determining which nutritional deficits 
are present from the onset of antipsychotic treatment, and 
identifying which nutritional deficiencies are associated 
with physical and mental health outcomes in FEP, will 
identify key targets for dietary/nutrient interventions to 
improve nutritional status and attenuate neuroprogression 
and metabolic risk. Indeed, randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) in long-term schizophrenia have already indicated 
that vitamin supplementation has greatest efficacy among 
individuals with shorter illness duration.12
In the current study, we used meta-analytic techniques 
to quantify the presence and severity of nutritional defi-
cits in FEP, across every class of vitamin and/or dietary 
mineral examined in this population to date. Along with 
determining where deficits may exist, we also sought to 
systematically review the clinical correlates of nutritional 
status, to identify which vitamins and minerals are related 
to physical and mental health outcomes in FEP.
Methods
This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA statement37 
to ensure comprehensive and transparent reporting 
(supplement 1).
Search Strategy
An electronic database search Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment 
Database, AMED, HMIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and 
EMBASE was conducted on July 7, 2017. A keyword 
search algorithm (supplement 2) was developed to iden-
tify all studies assessing blood levels of any vitamins and/
or minerals in FEP. The reference lists of retrieved arti-
cles and Google Scholar were also searched to identify 
any additional relevant articles.
Screening and Selection Process
Only peer-reviewed research articles available in English 
were included. Eligible samples were those in which 
>75% of individuals were specified as “first-episode 
psychosis.” Studies in which the term “first-episode psy-
chosis” was not explicitly used were only eligible if the 
entire patient sample was specified as either (1) currently 
receiving treatment from “early intervention in psycho-
sis” services, or (2) within the first 3 years of receiving 
antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia or other non-
affective psychotic disorders (as this period is broadly 
accepted and used as an appropriate timeframe for 
“early intervention” programs for psychosis).38–40 This 
criterion was applied to capture all relevant studies of 
patients in relatively early stages of illness and antipsy-
chotic treatment, while excluding samples likely repre-
sentative of those with more established illness. Eligible 
studies were those which either: (1) compared blood 
levels (including whole blood, plasma, serum, eryth-
rocyte, leukocyte, or other blood components) of any 
vitamin and/or dietary mineral (as defined by the British 
Nutrition Foundation, 201641) in FEP to a non-FEP 
control sample, or (2) reported on clinical correlates (ie, 
any metabolic, psychiatric, or neurocognitive param-
eters assessed using a clinically validated measure) of 
vitamin/mineral levels in FEP samples. For inclusion in 
the systematic review, no restriction was placed on the 
nature of control sample used. However, meta-analyses 
used only the data from studies which compared FEP to 
“healthy” control samples (ie, individuals with no psy-
chiatric diagnosis).
Data Extraction
Articles were screened for eligibility by 2 independent 
reviewers (J.F. and R.C.). Disagreements were resolved 
through discussion until consensus was reached. Where 
further information or study data were required, the 
corresponding authors of the respective articles were 
contacted twice over the period of 1 month to request 
this. This was attempted for one paper but data were not 
retrieved.42 A systematic tool was used to extract the fol-
lowing data from each study:

Nutritional Deficits in Early Psychosis
(1)  
Study characteristics: study design, country, sample 
size (n).
(2)  
FEP sample: age, % male, inpatient/outpatient sta-
tus, duration of untreated psychosis, medication 
type, and duration of antipsychotic treatment.
(3)  
Control sample: age, % male, clinical/healthy pop-
ulation, any sociodemographic characteristics 
matched to FEP sample for.
(4)  
Study findings: blood levels of vitamin/minerals in 
FEP and controls, outcomes of all reported statisti-
cal comparisons between groups, relationships with 
any physical/psychiatric/neurocognitive assessment 
measures.
Statistical Analyses
Meta-analyses were performed in Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis 2.0.43 A random effects model was applied to 
all analyses to account for methodological heterogene-
ity between eligible studies,44 in terms of differences in 
both blood sampling procedures and assay measures 
used across studies. Individual analyses were performed 
for each vitamin and mineral examined in FEP patients, 
using pooled comparisons with blood levels observed in 
nonpsychiatric control samples. Where studies used mul-
tiple measures of an individual vitamin or mineral, the 
more complex measure which best reflects bioavailable 
levels or long-standing nutrient was preferentially used. 
The overall difference between FEP and control groups 
for each vitamin/mineral was computed as Hedge’s G 
from the raw (ie, unadjusted) mean levels reported in 
each study.
Variance between studies was assessed using Cochran’s 
Q and I2 values, both of which estimate the degree of var-
iance resulting from between-study heterogeneity, rather 
than chance. For all statistically significant findings, 
Egger’s regression test was applied to quantify the risk 
of publication bias. Additionally, a “Fail-Safe N”45 was 
calculated to determine the number of unpublished null 
studies which would invalidate the findings, and Duval 
and Tweedie’s trim-and-fill analysis was applied. We also 
performed post hoc sensitivity analyses to assess if com-
parable differences were still observed when excluding 
outlier studies with very high effect sizes.
Finally, for all individual study findings which could 
not be combined in meta-analyses, we produced a sys-
tematic narrative synthesis reporting on: (1) differences 
between FEP samples and other “non healthy” (ie, clini-
cal/psychiatric) populations, and (2) all clinical correlates 
of vitamin/mineral levels in FEP.
Results
The initial database search was performed on July 7, 2017. 
The search returned 1578 results, reduced to 1176 after 
duplicates were removed. A further 1071 articles were 
excluded after and abstract screening. Full text versions 
were retrieved for 105 articles, of which were 26 eligible 
for inclusion. A further 2 eligible articles were identified 
from an additional search of Google Scholar. Full details 
of the search results and reasons for exclusion and are 
summarized in figure 1.
A total of 28 articles, reporting data from 24 unique 
samples of 2612 participants (1221 FEP, 1391 controls) 
were included. These assessed differences in blood lev-
els of 6 vitamins (A, B12, C, D, E, and folate) and 10 
minerals (zinc, magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium, 
copper, chromium, iron, manganese, and selenium). Four 
studies were conducted in India, 3 in Pakistan and China, 
2 in United States of America, United Kingdom, Turkey, 
Spain, and Nigeria, and individual studies in Poland, 
Romania, Norway, and Singapore. Full details and find-
ings of all included studies are shown in table 1a–d.
B Vitamins in FEP
Nine studies, with 6 independent samples, reported on 
B vitamin levels across 872 participants: 425 with FEP, 
all of whom were medication-naïve (except for one 
study where this was no specified; table 1), and 447 con-
trols. Two B vitamins were examined: folate (B9) and 
cobalamin (B12).
Random effects meta-analyses found significantly 
lower blood levels of folate in FEP compared with 
healthy controls (figure 2), with a moderately large effect 
size (N = 6, n = 827, g = −0.624, 95% CI = −1.176 to 
−0.072, P = .027). There was significant heterogeneity 
(Q = 66.0, P < .01, I2 = 92.4%), and a range of blood 
measures applied across studies, showing significant dif-
ferences between FEP and controls in plasma, serum, 
and red blood cell levels (table 1). There was no evidence 
of publication bias (Eggers regression, P = .16) and the 
trim-and-fill analysis did not identify any outlier stud-
ies. Furthermore, the fail-safe N was 71, indicating 71 
additional null studies would be required to make the 
observed difference nonsignificant.
Four studies (n = 620) examined blood levels of vita-
min B12, finding no significant difference between FEP 
and healthy controls (g = −0.059, 95% CI = −0.22 to 
0.10, P = .468, Q = 2.96, I2 = 0%). A single study com-
pared serum folate and vitamin B12 levels in FEP to peo-
ple with depression,46 finding no significant differences 
between the 2 patient groups. However, no firm conclu-
sions could this be drawn due to the low number of FEP 
patients examined (n = 14).
Table 1a shows all clinical correlates of B vitamin levels 
in FEP. Five studies examined relationships between folate 
levels and psychiatric symptoms (measured using the 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; “PANSS”47).48–52  
Only one found a significant correlation with PANSS 
total scores.48 However, 3 found significant correlations 
between serum folate and PANSS subscales; with lower

folate levels predicting more severe negative48,49 or gen-
eral53 symptoms. No associations were found for positive 
symptoms or cognition.
Three studies examined clinical correlates of vita-
min B12 in FEP. One found trend-level correlation with 
reduced positive symptoms,52 and 2 found significant 
inverse correlation between B12 and negative symptom 
scores.51,53 One further study examining the impact of 
antipsychotic medications found significant reductions 
in serum levels of both folate and B12 after 12 weeks of 
treatment with olanzapine, but no reduction from risperi-
done in FEP.50 Finally, one study found that neither folate 
or B12 levels were related to childhood trauma.53
Vitamin D in FEP
Seven studies examined blood levels of vitamin D using 
plasma and serum measures across 906 participants; 429 
with FEP, 477 controls (table 1b). Meta-analyses com-
paring FEP to healthy control samples (all matched for 
age and ethnicity) showed that people with FEP had 
reduced vitamin D levels; with a large, significant differ-
ence between the 2 groups (g = −1.055, 95% CI = −1.99 to 
−0.119, P = .027) (figure 2). There was significant heter-
ogeneity but no evidence of publication bias (Q = 216.6, 
P < .01, I2 = 97.2%, Egger’s regression P = .27, Fail Safe 
N = 265). A sensitivity analysis excluding the single study 
with large effect size (g = −4.04) which did not use estab-
lished FEP criterion (classifying patients as “newly diag-
nosed”)54 found the difference was still significant among 
6 remaining studies (g = −0.554, 95% CI = −1.00 to 
−0.113, P = .014). A study comparing vitamin D in FEP 
and multi-episode schizophrenia found no significant 
differences between groups.55 However, one study found 
that the FEP patients later diagnosed with schizophrenia 
had trend-level lower vitamin D than FEP patients who 
were later diagnosed with other psychoses (P = .06).56
Three studies examined correlations between vita-
min D and psychiatric symptoms; all finding some 
link between low vitamin D and worse mental health 
(table 1b). Graham et al57 found serum levels of vitamin 
D were negatively associated with PANSS totals and neg-
ative subscale scores, overall neurocognitive function-
ing, and specific tests of verbal fluency. There was also 
a trend-level association (P = .054) with PANSS positive 
symptoms. Yee et al58 found low vitamin D levels were 
only associated with greater PANSS negative symptoms, 
whereas Nerhus et al55 only observed a significant rela-
tionship with depressive symptoms (PANSS factor scale).
Antioxidant Vitamins in FEP
Five studies assessed blood levels of antioxidant vitamins 
(A, C, and E) in FEP (table 1c). As shown in figure 2, 
significant differences were only observed for vitamin C 
(g = −2.207, 95% CI = −3.71 to −0.71, P = .004) from 
2 studies observing large deficits of vitamin C in FEP 
samples.59,60 However, there was a small sample (n = 96), 
substantial heterogeneity (Q = 11.9, P < .01, I2 = 91.6%), 
and studies did not report the specifics of FEP classifi-
cation (samples only described as “newly diagnosed for 
schizophrenia”). Differences in vitamin E were nonsig-
nificant (N = 4, n = 253, g = −1.09, 95% CI = −2.54 to 
0.36, P = .14). The sole study examining vitamin A levels 
in FEP (n = 30) found no difference from healthy controls 
(n = 30).61

Regarding clinical correlates of antioxidant vitamins, 
neither A or E levels correlated with psychiatric symptoms 
(measured with PANSS or Clinical Global Impression 
scales).61 Nonetheless, Dakhale et al62 found that higher 
plasma vitamin C in newly diagnosed schizophrenia 
patients receiving vitamin C supplementation (n = 40) 
were associated with greater symptomatic improvement 
over 8 weeks (assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating 
Scale) (r = −.38, P < .05).
Dietary Minerals in FEP
Ten dietary minerals were assessed across 8 studies 
(table 1d) with 480 participants (224 FEP, 173 healthy 
controls, 83 older/longer-term schizophrenia). Only one 
study used the term “first-episode psychosis,”58 with all 
others describing their samples as “medication-naïve” or 
“newly treated/diagnosed schizophrenia patients.” There 
were 3 studies examining blood levels of calcium, copper, 
magnesium, sodium, and zinc; 2 studies for iron, man-
ganese, potassium, and selenium; and 1 study for chro-
mium. Meta-analyses found no significant differences 
between FEP samples and healthy controls for any die-
tary mineral (figure 3).
When comparing patient groups, 2 studies found no 
difference in mineral levels between newly diagnosed 
patients and those with established schizophrenia.63,64 
However, Arinola et al65 found that zinc, manganese, 
and chromium were all significantly lower in newly diag-
nosed, medication-naïve patients (n = 15) compared to 
medicated schizophrenia patients (n = 20). Furthermore, 
in a longitudinal study, Nechifor et al66 found that both 
magnesium and zinc were raised significantly following 
antipsychotic treatment (with either haloperidol or ris-
peridone). No studies examined correlations between 
mineral levels and symptomology in FEP.
Discussion
This is the first study to examine serum nutrient status in 
FEP, and the first to show that compared to nonpsychi-
atric controls, reduced nutritional status exists independ-
ently, and in some cases, before antipsychotic treatment. 
To date, meta-analyses have only examined nutritional 
status in people with long-term schizophrenia,28–30 and 
each of these have focused on single nutrients in isola-
tion.28–30 In this study, we included all vitamins and miner-
als examined in FEP to date, to identify which particular 
nutrient levels may act as specific biomarkers and/or ther-
apeutic targets for this population. Our systematic search 
found 28 studies with 24 independent samples compar-
ing blood levels of 6 vitamins and 10 dietary minerals in 
1221 people with FEP to 1391 controls. Random effects 
meta-analysis found significant reductions in folate, vita-
min D, and vitamin C among people with FEP compared 
to nonpsychiatric controls, with no significant differences 
for other vitamins or minerals.
The strongest evidence was found for vitamin D 
deficits; with pooled data from 7 independent studies 
showing a large, significant reduction across 429 individ-
uals with FEP compared to 477 nonpsychiatric controls 
(g = −1.1, P = .027), all matched for age and ethnicity.

Nutritional Deficits in Early Psychosis
Given the prevalence of vitamin D deficiencies in long-
term schizophrenia,30 and the compelling evidence for 
low vitamin D status during brain development being 
linked to schizophrenia onset,67 it is perhaps unsurprising 
that FEP is associated with lower vitamin D. However, 
the extent of the deficit in FEP samples compared to 
the general population observed in this meta-analysis is 
troubling, especially considering that vitamin D levels are 
often low even among healthy adults,68 with 20%–40% 
of young adults in UK population showing insufficien-
cies.69 Furthermore, within the FEP samples, lower vita-
min D levels were found to be associated with more severe 
symptomology.55,57,58
Currently, there is an absence of RCTs examining the 
efficacy of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunc-
tive treatment in FEP—although previous studies have 
shown vitamin D supplements used during childhood can 
reduce the risk of developing schizophrenia.20 The effi-
cacy of vitamin D supplementation in young people with 
FEP is currently being examined in a placebo-controlled 
RCT, the “D-Fend” study (“Vitamin D First Episode 
Neuroprotection Design”) (ISRCTN12424842). This will 
provide the first insights into potential benefits for this 
population. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for both 
metabolic and neurological health.70,71 Thus, supplement-
ing at the first-episode phase may attenuate the metabolic 
and neurological abnormalities which arise during the 
early stages of treatment. Indeed, preliminary research 
has already shown that vitamin D levels hold positive 
correlations with metabolic health,21 along with brain 
structure and functioning in people with psychosis.57,72
We also found that FEP samples had significantly 
lower serum folate than nonpsychiatric controls; as has 
previously been observed for long-term schizophrenia.28 
Folate deficiencies, even in the general population, are 
among the most widespread of all nutritional deficiencies 
globally, and adversely affect intellectual development 
and mortality risk.73 Folate also plays an important role 
in maintaining neuronal integrity74 and lowering levels 
of homocysteine—which has been linked to aetiology 
of schizophrenia.15 Indeed, 2 studies also found higher 
serum folate correlated with reduced negative symptoms 
in FEP,48,49 as has been previously observed in long-term 
schizophrenia.11,13
Interestingly, the one study which measured dietary 
folate intake found that reduced folate levels in FEP could 
not be accounted for by differences in diet.52 Instead, 
genotypic differences in folate absorption efficiency may 
be responsible for deficiencies observed in schizophre-
nia.15,52,75 In long-term schizophrenia, this hypothesis is 
supported by strong experimental evidence showing that 
symptomatic benefits from standard folic acid supple-
ments are moderated by genotypic differences in absorp-
tion,75,76 whereas administration of “L-methlyfolate” (the 
most bioactive folate type; readily absorbed regardless 
of genotype) significantly reduces negative symptoms

across entire schizophrenia samples.13 Symptomatic ben-
efits of L-methylfolate have also been shown in multiple 
RCTs in people with depression.77,75 Although there are 
no RCTs of L-methylfolate to date in individuals with 
FEP, research in long-term schizophrenia samples sug-
gests that patients with shorter illness durations are more 
responsive to B vitamin treatments.12 Given the very low 
side-effect profile of L-methylfolate (with RCTs in other 
populations administering over 100 times the recom-
mended daily requirement without any negative effects),78 
this could potentially be trialed as an adjunctive treat-
ment in FEP, or even as a prevention strategy for individ-
uals identified as at-risk of psychosis. Additionally, B12 
(another homocysteine-reducing B vitamin) may also be 
as useful adjunctive treatment, as although no pooled dif-
ferences were observed between FEP and controls for this 
nutrient, studies consistently indicated that higher B12 
was related to better mental health in FEP.51–53
Although only examined in 2 studies, vitamin C was 
also significantly reduced in FEP. This is concordant with 
data suggesting low fruit and vegetable intake in this pop-
ulation.79 Additionally, a single RCT in patients under-
going first antipsychotic treatment has shown 500 mg of 
vitamin C per day significantly reduces psychiatric symp-
toms.62 Furthermore, increases in plasma vitamin C were 
correlated with symptomatic improvements following the 
trial. Meta-analyses of other antioxidant vitamins A and 
E found no evidence for deficits in FEP.
However, a limitation of this meta-analysis is that 
despite the large number of total studies, certain individ-
ual nutrients were only examined in a small number of 
FEP samples—reducing statistical power to detect signif-
icant differences. Therefore, although the review provides 
evidence that folate and vitamin D are reduced in FEP 
compared to healthy populations, the nonsignificance of 
differences for other vitamins does not necessarily rule 
these out as deficient. Indeed, further adequately pow-
ered studies could ultimately find a spectrum of defi-
ciencies impacting on the physical and mental health of 
people with FEP. Additionally, the lack of significant 
differences found between FEP samples and other psy-
chiatric populations, such as depression46 and long-term 
schizophrenia,55,63,64 could be due to limited sample sizes 
in respective studies. Thus, further research is required to 
determine if any nutritional deficiencies are particularly 
pronounced in FEP, or if these deficiencies are prevalent 
across all phases/types of severe mental illness.
Another limitation is that the causative and mechanistic 
links between nutritional deficiencies and mental health 
outcomes has yet to be established.80 Further longitudi-
nal and interventional research in individuals identified 
at “ultra-high risk” for psychosis would provide valua-
ble insights into both the predictive value of nutritional 
deficiencies in the onset of psychosis, along with poten-
tially determining if nutritional supplementation can 
confer any benefit for reducing psychosis risk. A note of 
caution is warranted, as in disorders such as cardiovascu-
lar disorders and cancer, where nutrient deficiencies have 
also been noted, the research has been underwhelming in 
supporting supplementation. For instance, while vitamin 
D insufficiency is widespread across noncommunicable 
medical conditions, RCTs of vitamin D supplementation 
in cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and osteoporosis have 
generally failed to robustly support causative hypoth-
eses.80–82 It should also be considered that although nutri-
tional deficiencies could feasibly exacerbate psychiatric 
symptoms, it is also possible that therapeutic benefits of 
supplementation may not be reliant upon vitamin/min-
eral deficiencies. For instance, beneficial effects of other 
nutrient-based adjunctive treatments (such as NAC83 and 
Taurine84) are not due to restoring specific nutritional def-
icits, but instead attributed to these amino acids targeting 
pathological neurological processes.83,84 Therefore, even 
in the absence of clear deficiencies, certain nutrients may 
confer positive effects in FEP through the neurochemical 
properties of these compounds, regardless of deficiency 
status.
Given the marked reductions in vitamin D and folate 
observed in FEP compared to nonpsychiatric samples, 
future research should also examine what proportion of 
individuals with FEP reach clinical thresholds for nutri-
tional deficiencies in comparison to established reference 
values, which in turn could have implications for routine 
screening of nutritional deficiencies in FEP. Additionally, 
much of the emphasis for dietary intervention in schiz-
ophrenia so far lies with reducing over-consumption of 
obesogenic foods.7,85 Thus, this review also holds implica-
tions for dietary interventions to further emphasize the 
importance of consuming a good quality diet contain-
ing adequate nutrients. Indeed, large-scale epidemiolog-
ical studies show that low levels of both vitamin D and 
folate are linked to cardiovascular mortality.86,87 Further 
efforts toward resolving these deficiencies holds prom-
ise to reduce the physical health inequalities observed 
in schizophrenia. Additionally, multi-ingredient “nutra-
ceuticals,” which combine various beneficial nutrients 
to target specific nutritional deficits and neurological 
processes implicated in psychiatric disorders,88,89 may 
also provide safe and effective adjunctive treatments for 
FEP. These data also support stratification of individuals 
based on nutrient intake/status as criteria for nutraceuti-
cal interventions and in trial design. Given the clear lack 
of experimental evidence in this area,12 there is a now a 
clear need for clinical trials to evaluate the use of whole 
diet interventions as well as nutrient-based interventions 
for improving the typically poor recovery rates observed 
among people with FEP.
