Abstract
Background: Candida auris is a globally emerging multidrug resistant fungal pathogen causing nosocomial transmission.
We report an ongoing outbreak of C. auris in a London cardio-thoracic center between April 2015 and July 2016. This is
the first report of C. auris in Europe and the largest outbreak so far. We describe the identification, investigation and
implementation of control measures.
Methods: Data on C. auris case demographics, environmental screening, implementation of infection prevention/control
measures, and antifungal susceptibility of patient isolates were prospectively recorded then analysed retrospectively.
Speciation of C. auris was performed by MALDI-TOF and typing of outbreak isolates performed by amplified fragment
length polymorphism (AFLP).
Results: This report describes an ongoing outbreak of 50 C. auris cases over the first 16 month (April 2015 to July 2016)
within a single Hospital Trust in London. A total of 44 % (n = 22/50) patients developed possible or proven C. auris
infection with a candidaemia rate of 18 % (n = 9/50). Environmental sampling showed persistent presence of the yeast
around bed space areas. Implementation of strict infection and prevention control measures included: isolation
of cases and their contacts, wearing of personal protective clothing by health care workers, screening of
patients on affected wards, skin decontamination with chlorhexidine, environmental cleaning with chorine
based reagents and hydrogen peroxide vapour. Genotyping with AFLP demonstrated that C. auris isolates from
the same geographic region clustered.
Conclusion: This ongoing outbreak with genotypically closely related C. auris highlights the importance of
appropriate species identification and rapid detection of cases in order to contain hospital acquired transmission.

Background
The fungal pathogen Candida auris (C.auris) was first
described in 2009 after isolation from the ear of a pa-
tient in Japan, and is responsible for a wide range of
healthcare associated invasive infections [1]. Since its
first description, reports of nosocomial outbreaks of C.
auris have been reported from India [2], South Korea
[3], South Africa [4] and Venezuela [5]. C. auris is
phylogenetically related to C. haemulonii and accurate
species identification is necessary for the administration
of appropriate antifungal therapy and the control of out-
breaks in hospital settings [6].
Methods
Outbreak setting and epidemiological data
The outbreak involves the Royal Brompton Hospital in
London (United Kingdom) which is a National Health
specialist centre for cardio-thoracic surgery with 296 beds.
C. auris cases were identified by routine microbiology

 cultures from clinical sites such as wound swabs, urine
samples, vascular devices tips, blood cultures as well
as skin screening samples (including nose, axilla, groin
and stool samples) of patients exposed to C. auris
cases or an environment where positive patients were
previously based. Demographics including gender, age
and ward were collected prospectively. All microbio-
logical samples were prospectively collected and data
retrieved using the laboratory Information Manage-
ment system (WinPath v5.32 software, Clinisys Solu-
tions Ltd, Chertsey, UK).
Definitions
Colonization with C. auris was defined as culture posi-
tive skin, oropharynx, vascular line exit site, respiratory,
and urinary tract without clinical signs of Candida in-
fection. Candidaemia episode was defined as a Candida
positive blood culture (BC) treated within a three
months period. Possible C. auris infection was defined
as a case with a positive culture from a non-sterile site
(sternal wound, urine, vascular line tip) and clinical
signs and symptoms of infection requiring treatment
with antifungal agents. Presumed invasive candidiasis
of unknown focus of infection was defined as a patient
demonstrating raised inflammatory markers despite the
use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and responding to
systemic antifungal treatment and/or expressing add-
itionally raised serum β-D-glucan (BDG).
Laboratory methods
Candida isolates from clinical, patient and staff screen-
ing and environmental swabs were plated on Sabouraud
dextrose agar plates and identified using Chromogenic
ager
(Brilliance
Candida
Agar,
Thermo
Scientific,
Basingstoke, UK). Non-C.albicans isolates including C.
auris were speciated by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorp-
tion
Ionization-Time
of
Flight
mass
spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF; Bruker, Bremen, Germany) using the
Biotyper v3.1 software (Bruker Ltd, Coventry, UK). An-
tifungal susceptibility testing was done by microbroth
dilution (Sensititre YeastOne; Trek Diagnostic Systems
Ltd, East Grinstead, UK).
Typing of Candida isolates from representative iso-
lates of a number of global outbreaks was done by AFLP
analysis as previously described [7, 8]. Briefly, genomic
DNA was extracted from 48 h liquid cultures using the
MasterPure
yeast
DNA
purification
kit
(Epicentre
Biotechnologies, Cambridge, United Kingdom) with an
additional bead beating step included. Extracted gDNA
was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and
dsDNA BR (double-stranded DNA, broad range) assay
kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Results
Outbreak description
We report an ongoing outbreak describing the first
16 month experience. During this period there were a
total of 50 C. auris cases (17 female, 33 male; average
age 53 years, range 19-78) within a single Hospital
Trust in London. In April 2015 the first patient was
identified in a 20 bedded mixed medical-surgical adult
intensive care unit (ICU) of a specialist cardio-thoracic
centre. The yeast was initially cultured from a sternal
wound. Within one week a second patient in the adjacent
bed to the index case became C. auris culture positive in
their sputum and subsequently developed an intravascular
line related infection. Both patients had undergone cardiac
surgery and required treatment with the antifungal agent
caspofungin for their infection. A 12-month retrospective
microbiology database search showed that C. auris had
not been previously isolated from any patient. At the time
it was thought that hospital acquired transmission from a
single index case was likely but no obvious source was
apparent.
In June 2015 after a one-month gap a further two ICU
patients were identified carrying C. auris (Fig. 1). The
possibility of a healthcare associated transmission within
the ICU was raised and prompted a review of possible
routes of transmission including processes for washing
patients, shared equipment, ventilation, lapses in clean-
ing and hand hygiene. Environmental sampling of the
clinical area surrounding colonized patients demonstrated
contamination with C. auris of horizontal surfaces such as
the floor around bed sites, trollies, radiators, windowsills,
equipment monitors and key pads, and also one air sample.
Further attention was focused on infection prevention and
control (IPC) measures. Prospective surveillance of C. auris
from clinical specimens and screening of C. auris positive
patient contacts was also introduced to actively identify
further transmissions. No further cases occurred over a
three-month period until the end of September 2015 when
a series of new cases occurred, and by November 2015
there were a total of nine C. auris cases including several
with candidaemia. Formal outbreak meetings were set up
with regular review and audit of IPC measures (described
below). The outbreak slowed down over the Christmas
period but resurged in January 2016 with a steep increase
of cases, reaching a total of 50 cases over a 16 months
period by July 2016 (Fig. 1). Due to the movement of C.
auris positive patients and their contacts from the ICU to
other wards, new cases also occurred briefly in those wards.
Infection control and prevention measures
A formal outbreak investigation led to the implementation
of enhanced measures to limit transmission including isola-
tion of all positive C. auris patients, cohorting of their
direct patient contacts as well as ceasing new admissions to
Schelenz et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control  (2016) 5:35

 the affected rooms. All positive patients were kept under
strict isolation for the duration of their hospital stay. All
direct contact patients were screened for the presence of
this yeast in sites including nose, axilla, groin, throat, rec-
tum or faeces, vascular line exit sites and clinical samples
such as urine, wounds, drains and respiratory specimens.
Route cause analysis revealed that the minimum contact
period with a positive case or a contaminated environment
for the acquisition of C. auris was ≥4 h. However, no single
point source of transmission was identifiable. Direct contact
patients were only de-isolated after three consecutive nega-
tive C. auris screens and screened weekly thereafter until
discharge. The latter was introduced as one patient became
positive after three consecutive negative screens.
As healthcare workers (HCW) have been implemented in
the transmission of other Candida species in the past we
have undertaken an extensive staff screening programme
involving doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, catering and
cleaning staff, dieticians, a Chaplin and ward administra-
tors. Staff hands (agar impression plates), nose, axilla, groin
and throat swabs were analysed for the presence of
Candida [9]. Only one out of 258 HCW screened were
found to have a C. auris positive nose swab (all other
samples were negative). This nurse had been caring for
a heavily C. auris colonized patient. After a five day
decolonization protocol with chlorhexidine washes, nasal
ointment and oral nystatin medication (as described below)
repeat microbiology samples were negative suggesting
transient carriage only. Retrospectively the staff mem-
ber reported a skin allergy to alcohol gel which may
explain suboptimal hand decontamination and subse-
quent colonization of the nose. However, as this HCW
was not nursing any other previous or subsequent new
C. auris cases it was felt that the outbreak was unlikely
to be related to this person.
Strict contact precautions were introduced for all health-
care workers, cleaners and visitors on entering rooms
where patients were isolated. These included the wearing of
cuffed long-sleeved disposable gowns, gloves and aprons
similar to Public Health England recommendations for car-
bapenemase producing enterobacteriaceae control [10]. For
decolonization of C. auris, patients were prescribed twice
daily 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate washes using single use
wipes (Sage, Geneva, Switzerland) or aqueous 4 % chlor-
hexidine formulation, mouthwashing containing 0.2 %
chlorhexidine (Corsodyl, GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK)
or chlorhexidine 1 % dental gel (Corsodyl) for patients on
ventilator support and oral nystatin if oropharyngeal
colonization was present. We also introduced the use
of chlorhexidine impregnated protective disks for all
central vascular catheter exit sites (BioPatch, Johnson &
Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA) to reduce line associated
C. auris blood stream infections.
For environmental decontamination we implemented
extreme measure for cleaning and disinfection of the
patient rooms and equipment using 1000 ppm chlorine
based products (Chlorclean, Guest Medical, Ashford,
UK) three times a day. On discharge or transfer of a C.
auris positive case the room was subjected to a terminal
cleaning with 10,000 ppm chlorine based detergent
(Haztab, Guest Medical) and any cleaned equipment was
left in the room to be disinfected with hydrogen peroxide
vapour (Bioquell Ltd, Andover, UK).
Characteristics and typing of outbreak strains
C. auris appeared as beige coloured colonies on Chromo-
genic agar and species was confirmed using MALDI-TOF
analysis. All isolates expressed high level fluconazole re-
sistance (MIC: >256 mg/L) but the majority were suscep-
tible to echinocandins (MIC 0.06-0.25 mg/L), 5-flucytosine
Fig. 1 New cases of C. auris per month. Total number of monthly new cases of C. auris are listed from the 1 April 2015 to the end of July 2016

 (MIC <0.06-0.12 mg/L) with variable susceptibility to
amphotericin B (0.5-2 mg/L). A small selection of iso-
lates were tested for nystatin and terbinafine (1 mg/l)
susceptibility.
AFLP has previously been shown to reliably distinguish
C. auris from closely related species C. haemulonii, C. pseu-
dohaemuloni and C. duobushaemulonii, and was performed
on available outbreak isolates to identify a geographic origin
of this outbreak [7, 8]. AFLP analysis of a selection of UK
isolates (n = 15) was done and compared to isolates from
India (n = 22), Japan (n = 1), South Africa (n = 4), South
Korea (n = 2) and Venezuela (n = 19) using previously
published methodology [7, 11]. The resulting dendrogram
suggests that the London isolates form a distinct cluster
compared to other global isolates (Fig. 2). The high degree
of relatedness within the AFLP dendrogram (Fig. 2) sug-
gests a single introduction of the infecting genotype into
the hospital however analysis of whole-genome sequences
is ongoing to confirm this preliminary observation.
Clinical impact of C. auris and prevalence
In the majority of cases C. auris was confined to colon-
isation of skin sites or mucosa. However, a total of 44 %
(n = 22/50) of patients required anti-fungal therapy with
an echinocandin, amphotericin B and/or 5-flucytosine
for possible or proven C. auris infection including nine
episodes of candidaemia in a total of eight patients
(Table 1). Some cases developed candidaemia despite the
use of echinocandins which also did not reduce skin
colonization. An independent mortality review demon-
strated that there were no deaths directly attributable to
infections by C. auris.
In order to establish whether patients already carrying C.
auris on admission to the hospital have contributed to the
positive case load we analysed a random set of C. auris
admission screens obtained between July 2015 and July
2016. The prevalence of C. auris in our admitted patient
population was 0.04 % (n = 1/2246 screened patients).
Discussion
C. auris is a globally emerging multidrug resistant fungal
pathogen with the first clinical case being described in
2009 causing an ear infection in a Japanese patient [1].
Whilst isolated sporadic cases occur, there is a growing
concern regarding the propensity of C. auris to cause
widespread nosocomial outbreaks [2]. Several clusters
have emerged globally including countries such as South
Korea [3, 12], India [7, 8, 11, 13], South Africa [4],
Pakistan [14], and hospitals in Latin America [5, 14].
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) demonstrated highly
related C. auris isolates in the same geographic areas
[14, 15]. Alarmingly, our outbreak is the first description
of hospital acquired transmission leading to a large out-
break in a European country adding to the evidence that
this multidrug resistant pathogen is capable of transmission
in the health care setting causing potentially serious in-
fections of a global concern. As carriage was negligible
(0.04 %) in our admitted population, the observed rate
of infection within our facility was 44 % with an 18 %
rate of candidaemia amongst colonized patients. These
values are high and pose a serious risk to critically ill
patients. Unsurprisingly, intensive care stay has been
reported as a major risk factor for C. auris infections in a
recent case series from developing countries [5, 11, 13, 16].
The occurrence of candidaemia that is attributed to C auris
appears increasingly common and is associated with mor-
tality of up to 50 % in some countries, although not seen in
our series or others [3–5]. The antifungal drug resistance is
of particularly concern as it characteristically demonstrates
high level resistance to azoles (particularly fluconazole) and
in other studies has been shown to be multidrug resistant,
including echinocandins and amphotericin [2].
Early identification of Candida species as recommended
by the British Society for Medical Mycology best practice is
not only important for the appropriate use of antifungal
treatment but also in order to implement effective infection
control measures [17]. Many microbiology laboratories cur-
rently do not routinely speciate non-Candida albicans
isolates or utilize yeast identification methods such as
chromogenic agar, biochemical tests (API) or automated
systems such as VITEK which do not speciate this patho-
gen or may misidentify C. auris as yeasts such as Candida
haemulonii, Candida sake, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa
[6, 11]. Currently, reliable methods for speciation are mo-
lecular based methods such as PCR, AFLP fingerprinting,
sequencing analysis, and MALDI-TOF biotyping [6–8].
Our data shows an innate resilience of this fungal patho-
gen for survival and persistence in the clinical environment,
the ability for rapid colonization of patient’s skin and high
transmissibility within the health care setting leading to a
serious and prolonged outbreak. The management of this
outbreak has been a costly challenge despite extremely
stringent IPC measures focussing particularly on rapid
identification of carriers of C. auris, prompt isolation
and decolonisation of positive patients, extensive con-
tact tracing and screening of patients, and enhanced
cleaning and decontamination of the environment includ-
ing medical equipment. We learned that despite daily
chlorhexidine washes as recommended for the prevention
of healthcare associated infections, patients continue to be
colonized [18]. This is presumably due to reinfection from
within their bedding and clothing although a reduced sus-
ceptibility of C. auris to chlorhexidine may be a possibility
which we are currently investigating.
Our results from environmental screening demonstrate
that positive patients can shed C. auris into the close
environment posing a risk of continuous transmission.
Although we have not been able to identify a specific point

 source we believe the prolonged outbreak is likely to be
due to low level environmental contamination. Despite a
comprehensive review of modern technologies for envir-
onmental decontamination there is currently no published
data in the literature on the effectiveness of cleaning
agents or decontamination of the environment for C.
auris specifically [19]. Nevertheless, from our own prac-
tical experience based on environmental screening pre-
and post-cleaning we have now reasonable confidence that
high strength chlorine based agents and hydrogen per-
oxide vaporisation are effective. This highlights the
importance of strict adherence to cleaning/decontamin-
ation protocols and the need for isolating/cohorting all
positive patients.
Conclusion
Based on our experience we would recommend, firstly,
being vigilant in searching for C. auris in clinically signifi-
cant specimens in high risk hospital environment/high
risk patients such as intensive care units. There should be
a high level of suspicion when isolating non-C. albicans
isolates with fluconazole resistance.
Secondly, it is advisable to implement stringent IPC
measures for all positive C. auris cases including strict iso-
lation/cohorting and decolonization using chlorhexidine
and oral nystatin (if susceptible) and to perform extensive
screening of all direct contacts. More information is
needed on effective skin decolonisation regimens in
order to prevent invasive infections and further shed-
ding of this yeast into the environment.
Thirdly, regular environmental and equipment cleaning
with high strength chlorine-based agents and possibly
hydrogen peroxide vaporization is key to the reduction of
C. auris in the environment. In our experience, once the
yeast has been introduced in the environment it poses a
risk of transmission to patients and is difficult and costly
to eradicate. Regular auditing of IPC practices in particu-
larly compliance with hand washing/decontamination
should be undertaken. Although in our investigation we
have not been able to detect C. auris carriage on HCW
hands but others have shown that hands can be key
vectors in the transmission of Candida species either
via direct contact with colonised/infected patients or
indirect contact with contaminated environment or
equipment [9].
All in all, because there is very little known about the
factors promoting environmental resilience and transmis-
sion, the mechanisms of resistance to antifungal drugs or
disinfectants and properties contributing to prolonged host
colonization, the management of outbreaks in healthcare
facilities will remain a difficult challenge.
