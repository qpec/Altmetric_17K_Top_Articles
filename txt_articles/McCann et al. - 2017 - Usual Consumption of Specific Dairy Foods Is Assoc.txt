Abstract
Background: Dairy foods are complex mixtures which include nutrients and non-nutrient
substances that could potentially influence cancer etiology, including breast cancer.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine associations between the types and quantity
of dairy foods consumed and the risk of breast cancer among women participating in the Roswell
Park Cancer Institute Data Bank and BioRepository (DBBR) between 2003 and 2014.
Methods: Archived clinical and questionnaire data were obtained from the DBBR from 1941
women diagnosed with breast cancer between December 2003 and October 2014, and 1237
control participants. Intakes of dairy foods were queried with a self-administered food-frequency
questionnaire and grouped into monthly intakes of total dairy, milk, yogurt, low-fat cheese, other
cheese, and sweet dairy. ORs and 95% CIs were estimated with unconditional logistic regression
adjusting for age, race, body mass index, menopausal status, energy intake, type of milk usually
consumed, cigarette smoking status, and family history of breast cancer.
Results: Total dairy intakes were associated with a non-significant 15% reduction in breast cancer
risk (P = 0.11). Higher intakes of yogurt were associated with reduced risk of breast cancer (OR:
0.61; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.82) and higher intakes of American, cheddar, and cream cheeses were
associated with a marginally significant increased risk (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.34; P = 0.05).
Associations with dairy foods were mixed when stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status,
and in general reflected those of overall breast cancer. However, we observed positive
associations between milk intake and risk of ER2 breast cancer (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.37)
and inverse associations between sweet dairy and ER+ breast cancer (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29,
0.95).
Conclusions: Specific dairy foods may contribute to breast cancer risk in women, although the risk
varies by source of dairy. Future studies are warranted to confirm the protective potential of
yogurt in this type of cancer.

Introduction
Several lines of evidence suggest that foods that contain calcium and vitamin D, particularly
dairy, may be important in the etiology of several cancers (1). Vitamin D, as measured by cir-
culating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, has been inversely associated with the risk
of colorectal cancer and, to a lesser degree, with the risk of breast cancer (2), yet the evidence
for associations with calcium intake has been inconsistent (1). Despite some supporting ev-
idence from observational studies, supplemental low-dose vitamin D and calcium was not
shown to be preventive against breast cancer incidence in the Women’s Health Initiative
(2, 3). Aside from studies of vitamin D and calcium as single nutrients, evidence for dairy

 products in association with breast cancer risk is also variable and
dependent upon dose, dairy food form, and period of consumption
(youth or adult) (4). This complexity is probably not unexpected, be-
cause dairy foods are complex mixtures and include several nutri-
ents and nonnutrient substances that could potentially influence
cancer etiology through either increases or decreases in risk.
Healthy lifestyle factors that may accompany dairy food consump-
tion could further confound the associations, although to our
knowledge this has not been directly documented in the literature.
To better understand these complex relations and to facilitate the
synthesis of evidence-based dietary recommendations, more epide-
miologic studies are necessary. The purpose of this study was to ex-
amine the associations between the types and quantity of dairy foods
consumed and breast cancer in women participating in the Roswell
Park Cancer Institute Data Bank and BioRepository (DBBR)6 be-
tween 2003 and 2014.
Methods
Archived clinical and questionnaire data were obtained from the
DBBR at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) from 1941 women di-
agnosed with breast cancer between December 2003 and October
2014, and 1237 control participants. DBBR control participants had
no reported history of cancer, and were recruited from those who
were accompanying cases (friends and family members), were
community volunteers, or were employees of RPCI. Controls
were randomly selected from this pool of healthy participants and
frequency-matched on 10-y age strata to cases. The DBBR is a shared
resource at Roswell Park Cancer Institute that provides biospeci-
mens and linked data for studies of cancer etiology and prognosis
(5). The protocol for the DBBR was approved by the RPCI Institu-
tional Review Board, and all participants provided signed informed
consent. Demographics, anthropometric measurements, medical his-
tory, lifestyle variables, and food habits were ascertained with a self-
administered extensive epidemiologic questionnaire, and clinical
characteristics for women with breast cancer were obtained from
the RPCI tumor registry through linkage with the DBBR. We ex-
cluded women with an energy intake ,2092 kJ/d or .18,828 kJ/d
(n = 119), leaving 1857 cases and 1202 controls for analyses.
As part of the self-administered questionnaire, participants com-
pleted a detailed FFQ that queried the usual frequency of consump-
tion of 110 foods and beverages in the year before diagnosis. Nutrient
intake was calculated from the FFQ with the use of USDA food com-
position data and standard nutrient calculation algorithms. Dairy
foods queried on the FFQ included fluid milk, yogurt, cheese (Amer-
ican, cheddar, or cream cheese), low-fat cheese, ricotta or cottage
cheese, ice cream, low-fat frozen desserts, and pudding. Dairy foods
were classified according to nutrient content and culinary use, and
were expressed as servings/mo calculated from the FFQ as the
product of frequency of use and portion size summed across group
members. Separate questions were not queried for milk by fat con-
tent; rather, a single qualitative question was included that asked
what types of milk were usually consumed that allowed multiple
choices to be recorded but did not capture the proportion of
each type of milk consumed. Therefore, we were unable to exam-
ine associations with milk by fat content. Monthly dairy consump-
tion was categorized to represent typical daily serving sizes, and
ranges varied according to dairy group. Dairy intake was not nor-
mally distributed; therefore, dairy consumption was evaluated as
a categorical variable.
Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS 9.3 for Windows.
All tests were 2-sided and considered to be statistically significant
at P , 0.05. Menopause was defined as self-reported cessation of
menses either as natural menopause or hysterectomy with bilateral
oophorectomy. Differences in characteristics between cases and
controls were assessed with standard descriptive statistics: differ-
ences in continuous characteristics between cases and controls
were assessed with Student’s t tests and with Pearson’s chi-square
for categorical variables. ORs and 95% CIs for the associations of
breast cancer with each dairy group and total dairy were estimated
with unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age (continu-
ous), race (Caucasian or other), BMI (continuous), menopausal sta-
tus (pre- or postmenopausal), energy intake (continuous), type of
milk usually consumed (nonfat, low-fat, whole, or nondairy milk),
cigarette smoking status (never, former, or current), and family his-
tory of breast cancer (yes or no). Although unadjusted ORs were
similar to the adjusted estimates, adjustment for the above variables
slightly strengthened the observed associations. In the interest of
clarity, only the adjusted estimates are presented. Additional covari-
ates (education, food groups other than dairy, alcohol, physical activ-
ity, and other lifestyle variables) were assessed for inclusion, but did
not substantially modify the risk estimates. Analyses were conducted
for breast cancer overall and further assessed by estrogen receptor
(ER) status (ER+ and ER2). If data for ER status were missing, those
cases were excluded for that analysis. Finally, because stratification
by menopausal status is conventional in breast cancer research, we
had initially conducted stratified analyses. However, estimates
were similar between pre- and postmenopausal women; therefore,
overall breast cancer estimates are presented herein.
Results
The descriptive characteristics of the women with breast cancer and
healthy controls selected from the RPCI DBBR and included in this
analysis are shown in Table 1. Among pre- and postmenopausal
women, those with breast cancer tended to be older than those with-
out breast cancer (mean 6 SD: 45.5 6 5.9 y compared with 44.7 6
5.9 y and 64.6 6 8.9 y compared with 62.3 6 8.6 y, pre-and postmen-
opausal cases and controls, respectively). Postmenopausal women
with breast cancer had a higher mean BMI (in kg/m2) than did post-
menopausal women without breast cancer (29.2 6 6.4 compared
with 28.4 6 6.1). Age at menarche was comparable between cases
and controls, but cases were less likely than controls never to
have had children. Premenopausal cases were more likely to be

 never smokers than were premenopausal controls, whereas post-
menopausal cases were more likely to be current smokers than
were postmenopausal controls. As expected, family history of
breast cancer was higher in women with breast cancer than in
those without breast cancer.
The clinical characteristics of women with breast cancer are
detailed in Table 2. The majority of breast cancer was stage 2 or
lower among both pre- and postmenopausal women. ER2 cancers
were present in 20.0% of premenopausal and 16.3% of postmeno-
pausal women. Approximately 25% of tumors were progesterone
receptor negative (PR2). Human epidermal growth factor recep-
tor 2 (HER2) status was positive in 12.8% of premenopausal and
7.2% of postmenopausal women.
Although we were unable to examine the associations between
breast cancer and milk by fat content, adjustment for types of milk
usually consumed significantly affected the majority of the esti-
mates; thus, it was included in all models. In our sample, prefer-
ence was distributed as follows: 14% drank no milk, 24% usually
drank nonfat milk, 20% usually drank 2% milk, 11% usually drank
1% milk, 4% usually drank whole milk, and 27% drank various
combinations of milk types (data not shown).
ORs and 95% CIs for associations between dairy intake and
breast cancer are shown in Table 3. For total dairy, women

(.42 servings/mo compared with ,14 servings/mo) had a mar-
ginally significant 15% lower risk of breast cancer (OR: 0.85;
95% CI: 0.68, 1.06; P = 0.11). The inverse association between total
dairy intake and breast cancer appeared to be mainly attributable
to higher yogurt intake (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.82). Contrary to
our observations between yogurt and breast cancer, we observed a
marginally significant 53% increased risk of breast cancer associ-
ated with higher “other cheese” (American, cheddar, and cream
cheese) intake (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.34; P = 0.05). No associ-
ations were observed with the remaining dairy groups and breast
cancer in these data.
Associations between the intake of total dairy and specific dairy
foods and ER+ and ER2 breast cancer are shown in Table 4. We
observed a borderline significant 18% reduction in the risk of ER+
cancer in women with highest compared with lowest total dairy
intake (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.04; P = 0.10). As with breast can-
cer risk overall, yogurt intake was statistically significantly nega-
tively associated with the risk of both ER+ and ER2 breast
cancer (ER+ OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.89; ER2 OR: 0.61; 95%
CI: 0.38, 0.99). However, the estimates were comparable, sup-
porting no effect of ER status on the observed associations
(P-heterogeneity = 0.73). The intake of low-fat cheese was in-
versely associated with the risk of ER2 breast cancer (OR: 0.54;
95% CI: 0.29, 0.99), although the estimates were not statistically
significantly different from those associated with ER+ breast can-
cer (P-heterogeneity = 0.23). Associations between milk intake and
ER status were significantly different (P-heterogeneity = 0.04), with
no associations observed for ER+ breast cancer, but an increased risk
of ER2 breast cancer (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.05,2.37). Finally, we
observed significant heterogeneity in associations between

 sweet dairy foods and ER status (P = 0.01) wherein a higher intake
was inversely associated with ER+ breast cancer (OR: 0.52; 95% CI:
0.29, 0.95), but appeared to increase the risk of ER2 breast cancer,
although this association was not statistically significant (OR: 1.55;
95% CI: 0.89, 2.70).
Discussion
In a recent meta-analysis, total dairy and yogurt consumption were
inversely associated with breast cancer risk, especially among pre-
menopausal women (4). Similarly, in this hospital-based case-
control study of usual adult dairy consumption and breast cancer,
we observed total dairy consumption to be negatively associated
with breast cancer, and especially ER+ cancer. Whereas milk con-
sumption was weakly negatively associated with breast cancer overall,
a higher intake was strongly positively associated with ER2 postmen-
opausal breast cancer. Unexpectedly, the consumption of sweetened
dairy foods (pudding, low-fat frozen yogurt, and ice cream) was in-
versely related to ER+ breast cancer.
Dairy foods are important sources of several nutrients that
could favorably affect cancer risk, including vitamin D, calcium,
conjugated linoleic acid, butyrate, and other nutrients and phyto-
chemicals, but they also contain substances, such as insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and other growth hormones, that may ad-
versely affect risk (6, 7). In the Nurses’ Health Study, calcium and
vitamin D were inversely related to breast cancer incidence in pre-
menopausal women (8). The multivariable RR for highest calcium
intake compared with lowest calcium intake was 0.80 (95% CI:
0.58, 1.12). When further separated into dairy compared with non-
dairy calcium, dairy calcium was associated inversely with risk.
The consumption of .800 mg Ca compared with ,200 mg Ca
had an RR of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.98). Total vitamin D intake
was also associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in premen-
opausal women (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.94) in the Nurses’
Health Study.
However, the Women’s Health Initiative, a large randomized
trial of vitamin D and calcium in postmenopausal women, did
not show a beneficial effect of supplementation with these nutri-
ents on breast cancer risk in women already consuming supple-
ments (3), a common practice among postmenopausal women.
However, associations with dairy foods and breast cancer were
not assessed in the Women’s Health Initiative, and, to our knowl-
edge, clinical trials testing the impact of dairy foods on cancer risk
have not been conducted. Given that dairy foods are complex mix-
tures of nutrients and nonnutrient substances that could be nega-
tively as well as positively associated with risk, an examination of
whole foods rather than single nutrients is warranted.
Whereas dairy foods may be important contributors of nutri-
ents with anticarcinogenic potential, inverse associations may be
partly explained by the healthier lifestyle adopted by those who
consume low-fat dairy products. These factors could include to-
bacco avoidance, being physically active, use of dietary supple-
ments, and interest in health-promoting behaviors, although the
literature is sparse concerning documentation of these associa-
tions. However, adjustment for lifestyle factors such as physical
activity did not have a large impact on our observed estimates,
and we were unable to examine dairy consumption according to
fat content, because our FFQ was not designed to query this level
of detail. However, adjustment for usual type of milk consumed
was an important covariate and suggests that part of our associa-
tions could be due to reduced fat consumption from low-fat dairy
products, because the majority of milk consumed was nonfat or
reduced fat.
Despite the fact that fluid milk consumption provided the larg-
est contribution to total dairy intake in our study (R2 = 0.72), we
observed fairly substantial inverse associations with yogurt con-
sumption. Yogurt provides nutrients and nonnutrient compounds
beyond those found in fluid milk, including probiotics and prebi-
otics that could promote a healthy gut bacterial community struc-
ture (9). The gut bacterial community has been implicated in both
innate and adaptive immunity, which suggests that dysbiosis may
contribute to suboptimal immune function and subsequent disease
development (10, 11). Therefore, it is possible that higher yogurt
consumption may be favorably affecting immune function and
subsequent cancer risk.
Contrary to our expectations, we observed inverse associations
between the intake of sweet dairy foods and ER+ breast cancer, al-
though there were no associations with breast cancer overall. The
sweet dairy group included ice cream, frozen yogurt, low-fat

 frozen desserts, and pudding, and it therefore contributed primar-
ily to added sugar intake. A higher sugar intake could increase in-
sulin secretion, which has been associated with cancer etiology;
therefore, one would expect a positive association between the in-
take of these foods and breast cancer. Furthermore, the intake of
these foods was low and did not contribute a large proportion of
the variation in total dairy intake (R2 # 0.04). Although there
may be unknown mechanisms responsible for this finding, it is
also possible that it is due to chance.
Whereas the majority of associations between dairy intake and
breast cancer in this study were inverse, a strong positive associ-
ation was noted between high and low consumption of milk and
ER2 postmenopausal breast cancer. Fluid milk is relatively high
in IGF-1 as a consequence of the growth hormones used to in-
crease milk production (12). Because IGF-1 and the ER participate
in substantial crosstalk, positive associations would be more likely
between ER+ breast cancer and dairy, which is contrary to our
current findings (13–15). Alternatively, milk protein consumption
has been shown to increase postprandial hyperinsulinemia, which
could potentially increase cell growth and proliferation, indepen-
dently of the ER (16).
The current study is subject to limitations common in hospital-
based case-control studies. Case-control studies may be susceptible
to recall bias if the cases are more likely than controls to remember
an exposure. Both cases and the majority of controls were recruited
at RPCI or at cancer-focused community events, and participants
completed the questionnaire at home. Whereas the controls did
not have a cancer diagnosis, many were family members or friends
of nonbreast-cancer patients seeking care at RPCI, and thus also
may have been more aware of the role of diet in cancer etiology,
thus reducing the differential recall between the groups. Another
possible limitation is that all cases were patients of RPCI and all
controls were friends, relatives, or community members from the
surrounding area. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable
to all women, but should be generalizable to the western New
York catchment area.
Dietary intake was queried with a self-administered FFQ that
included the majority of commonly consumed dairy foods. Accu-
rate completion of an FFQ requires the averaging of estimated in-
take of a fairly large number of foods, and, therefore, intake could
be under- or overestimated by this method. Measurement of abso-
lute intake was not a goal of our study; rather, we ranked partici-
pants on reported intake, which is standard epidemiologic
methodology. Dairy intake in our sample was comparable to that
reported in the NHANES (17), and we are confident that intake es-
timates are adequate for US populations. Finally, although the time
period of interest was specified to be in the few years before diag-
nosis, this may not be the relevant time period for breast cancer
development, particularly if growth hormones are of interest.
Timing of dairy consumption was examined in the meta-analysis

 by Zang et al. (4), and childhood consumption was not strongly
associated with subsequent breast cancer risk.
In conclusion, we found inverse associations between total
dairy intake and yogurt intake and breast cancer, and positive
associations between other cheese and breast cancer, as well as
between milk and ER2 breast cancer. Our study suggests that
specific dairy foods may influence breast cancer risk, although
the direction of the associations varied by food source. Future
studies are also warranted to explore the mechanisms by which
yogurt could contribute to risk reduction for breast cancer.
