Abstract
Background: Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (VT) of 6 mL/kg/predicted body weight (PBW), to maintain
plateau pressure (Pplat) lower than 30 cmH2O, does not completely avoid the risk of ventilator induced lung injury
(VILI). The aim of this study was to evaluate safety and feasibility of a ventilation strategy consisting of very low VT
combined with extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R).
Methods: In fifteen patients with moderate ARDS, VT was reduced from baseline to 4 mL/kg PBW while PEEP was
increased to target a plateau pressure – (Pplat) between 23 and 25 cmH2O. Low-flow ECCO2R was initiated when
respiratory acidosis developed (pH < 7.25, PaCO2 > 60 mmHg). Ventilation parameters (VT, respiratory rate, PEEP),
respiratory compliance (CRS), driving pressure (DeltaP = VT/CRS), arterial blood gases, and ECCO2R system operational
characteristics were collected during the period of ultra-protective ventilation. Patients were weaned from ECCO2R
when PaO2/FiO2 was higher than 200 and could tolerate conventional ventilation settings. Complications, mortality
at day 28, need for prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and data on weaning from both
MV and ECCO2R were also collected.
Results: During the 2 h run in phase, VT reduction from baseline (6.2 mL/kg PBW) to approximately 4 mL/kg PBW
caused respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.25) in all fifteen patients. At steady state, ECCO2R with an average blood flow of
435 mL/min and sweep gas flow of 10 L/min was effective at correcting pH and PaCO2 to within 10 % of baseline
values. PEEP values tended to increase at VT of 4 mL/kg from 12.2 to 14.5 cmH2O, but this change was not
statistically significant. Driving pressure was significantly reduced during the first two days compared to baseline
(from 13.9 to 11.6 cmH2O; p < 0.05) and there were no significant differences in the values of respiratory system
compliance. Rescue therapies for life threatening hypoxemia such as prone position and ECMO were necessary in
four and two patients, respectively. Only two study-related adverse events were observed (intravascular hemolysis
and femoral catheter kinking).
Conclusions: The low-flow ECCO2R system safely facilitates a low volume, low pressure ultra-protective mechanical
ventilation strategy in patients with moderate ARDS.

Background
Over-distention of the normally aerated lung and/or open-
ing and closing of collapsed alveoli may worsen pulmon-
ary damage in patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). Current guidelines for ARDS recom-
mend a protective ventilation strategy based on limitation
of tidal volume (VT) to 6 mL/kg predicted body weight
and plateau pressure (Pplat) to 30 cmH2O, an approach
that has been shown in a randomized clinical trial to re-
duce mortality by 9 % [1]. However, recent studies have
shown that ARDS patients who are ventilated according
to the ARDS Network (ARDSnet) protective ventilatory
strategy may still be exposed to forces that can induce
lung injury [2–5], thus challenging current recommenda-
tions on how to minimize the risk of ventilator-induced
lung injury (VILI) [3]. Moreover, Hager and coworkers [6]
showed that mortality decreases as Pplat is reduced. How-
ever, as this relationship appears to be linear [6], several
authors have postulated that an ultra-protective ventila-
tion strategy based on further reduction in VT from 6–4
mL/kg and Pplat from 30–25 cmH2O may improve out-
comes [3]. Such tidal volumes reduce alveolar ventila-
tion resulting in respiratory acidosis, which can be
mitigated through the application of extracorporeal
carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) [7–9].
The feasibility and safety of ultra-protective ventilation
strategies facilitated by ECCO2R has been tested in sev-
eral studies using a pump-less arteriovenous device op-
erating at a blood flow rate of 1.0–1.5 L/min [10–12].
Information on feasibility and safety of ultra-protective
ventilation strategies facilitated by low-flow venous-
venous ECCO2R are limited to a single-center study [8].
The aim of the current study was to assess in a multi-
center
trial
the feasibility and safety
of an
ultra-
protective ventilation strategy facilitated by low-flow
veno-venous ECCO2R in patients with moderate ARDS.
We used an ECCO2R system (Hemolung Respiratory
Assist System, ALung Technologies), which is specific-
ally designed to provide clinically significant CO2 re-
moval at low blood flow rates (350–550 mL/min).
Methods
Patients were enrolled in four European intensive care
units of academic hospitals. Local ethics committees
approved the study protocol. Informed consent was
obtained from the patients. In the case of incompetent
patients, consent was obtained in accordance with local
ethics committee procedures [13].
Patients
The study included fifteen adult patients with moderate
ARDS according to the Berlin definition (PaO2/FiO2 (P/
F) 100–200 mmHg, with positive end-expiratory pres-
sure (PEEP) >5 cmH2O) [14], who were mechanically
ventilated with an expected duration of ventilation lon-
ger than 24 h. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years,
pregnancy, decompensated heart insufficiency or acute
coronary syndrome, severe chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary disease (COPD), respiratory acidosis with arterial
PCO2 (PaCO2) >80 mmHg, acute brain injury, severe
liver insufficiency (Child-Pugh score >7) or fulminant hep-
atic failure, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, contra-
indication for systemic anticoagulation, patient moribund,
decision to limit therapeutic interventions, catheter access
to femoral vein or jugular vein impossible, pneumothorax,
or platelet count <50 × 103/mL.
ECCO2R System
Low-flow ECCO2R was provided with the Hemolung
Respiratory Assist System (RAS) (ALung Technologies,
Inc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) [15]. Briefly, venous blood is cir-
culated through a 15.5-Fr dual lumen venous catheter
(jugular or femoral) by a magnetically driven centrifugal
pump at a flow rate of 350–550 mL/min. The pump is in-
tegrated within a cylindrical bundle of hollow fiber mem-
branes, creating a flow pattern, which improves CO2
transfer efficiency relative to passive oxygenators. Sweep
gas (air or 100 % O2) is drawn through the hollow fibers
under negative pressure by a vacuum pump, creating a
gradient for CO2 diffusion. Maintaining the sweep gas
under negative pressure mitigates the risk of air embolism
across the membrane, and also allows for automatic re-
moval of plasmatic water condensation from the fiber lu-
mens in order to preserve gas exchange efficiency. Level
of blood flow, pump speed (RPM) and extracorporeal
CO2 removal rate (vCO2) are displayed on a controller.
Study protocol
Patients
were
sedated,
paralyzed
and
ventilated
in
accordance with the EXPRESS trial protocol [16]: VT of
6 mL/kg (ideal body weight); PEEP set to achieve Pplat of
28–30 cmH2O; respiratory rate (RR) set to 20–35 to
maintain approximately the same minute ventilation as
before study initiation. Percutaneous venous femoral or
jugular cannulation was performed through insertion of
a single dual-lumen catheter (15.5 Fr) after administra-
tion of a heparin bolus (80 IU/kg). The device was

Page 2 of 7
 activated at a blood flow rate of 350–550 mL/min and a
sweep gas of 0 L/min such that no CO2 removal was ini-
tially performed.
Following a 2-h run-in time, VT was gradually reduced
from 6 to a minimum value of 4 mL/kg by 0.5 mL/kg every
30 minutes and PEEP was increased to target a Pplat between
23 and 25 cmH2O . If arterial pH was <7.25 with PaCO2 >60
mmHg, despite an increase in RR up to 35/min, sweep gas
through the ECCO2R device was switched on with 100 %
oxygen at 10 L/min to obtain an arterial pH ≥7.25 with a
PaCO2 ≤60 mmHg and RR ≤35/min. If PaCO2 was >75
mmHg and/or pH <7.20, despite a respiratory rate of 35/
min and optimized ECCO2R, sodium bicarbonate could be
infused. If undesirable hypercapnia/acidosis persisted, VT
was increased at the discretion of the treating physician. Re-
fractory hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia could be managed
at the discretion of the attending physician using veno-
venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),
prone positioning, or nitric oxide (NO) inhalation. If
PaCO2 was constantly <35 mmHg and/or pH was >7.50
under the aforementioned ECCO2R settings, the respira-
tory rate was decreased to 18–22/min and sweep gas flow
was decreased to 2–5 L/min.
The ECCO2R-facilitated
ultra-protective
ventilation
strategy was continued for at least 24 h. The potential
for
weaning
from
ultra-protective
ventilation
and
ECCO2R was assessed daily if PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) was >200
by setting mechanical ventilation according to conven-
tional ARDSnet settings (VT = 6 mL/kg, PEEP 5–10
cmH2O, RR 20–30/min, inspired O2 fraction (FiO2) = 40
%) and switching off sweep gas through the ECCO2R de-
vice. Under these conditions, if the patient remained
stable for at least 12 h with Pplat <25 cmH2O and PaCO2
<50 mmHg (allowing for RR up to 30–35/min), ECCO2R
was discontinued and the venous catheter removed.
ECCO2R parameters (blood flow, sweep gas flow, and
CO2 removal rate), ventilator settings (VT, PEEP, RR, Pplat,
mean airway pressure, minute ventilation, inspiratory-
to-expiratory
ratio,
inspired
fraction
of
oxygen),
hemodynamics (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, dose of
vasopressor) and arterial blood gas values (pH, PaO2,
PaCO2, HCO3
–, lactate), heparin dose and activated partial
thromboplastin time ratio (aPTTr) were collected at base-
line, after run-in time, 30 minutes after every VT reduction
and at least twice a day (08:00 am ± 2 h and 08:00 pm ± 2
h) in the subsequent days on ECCO2R. Blood chemistry
data were collected daily. Respiratory system compliance
[17] and driving pressure [18] were calculated according to
the standard formula.
Serious adverse events (SAE) were prospectively defined
as: (a) any event that is fatal or immediately life threaten-
ing, permanently disabling, severely incapacitating or re-
quires prolonged hospitalization; or (b) any event that
may jeopardize the patient and requires medical or
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed
above; and (c) which the attending physician perceives
might be directly related to enrollment in the clinical trial.
Adverse events were considered to be study-related if the
event followed a reasonable sequence from a study pro-
cedure and could readily have been produced by the study
procedure. Adverse events were considered non study-
related if they were related primarily to the underlying dis-
ease or to ARDS and its sequelae. Other adverse events
not fulfilling the above definition were recorded in the pa-
tients’ case report forms (CRFs). Following discontinuation
of ECCO2R, subjects were monitored for adverse events
until hospital discharge or day 8 after enrollment, which-
ever occurred first.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was
performed by one-way analysis of variance for repeated mea-
sures, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test for comparison
between different time points (Stata Corp, College Station,
TX, USA). P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

the period April to November 2014. Baseline characteris-
tics of patients enrolled in the study are shown in Table 1.

 FiO2 ≤200, they were ventilated with a conventional pro-
tective ventilation strategy according to the EXPRESS
trial protocol, and were paralyzed for a median time of 1
day kk. The initial stepwise reduction in VT, without
ECCO2R, resulted in significant respiratory acidosis (pH
<7.25) in all 15 patients at a mean VT of 3.96 ± 0.1 mL/
kg. After initiation of ECCO2R, a VT of 4.29 ± 0.5 mL/kg
was achieved and respiratory acidosis was significantly
corrected, with pH and PaCO2 returning to within 10 %
of baseline values obtained at VT = 6 mL/kg. The median
number of days on ECCO2R was 3 (2–4). The reduction
in VT was associated with a significant reduction in Pplat
from 27.7 ± 1.6 to 23.9 ± 1 cmH2O (p <0.05) at day 1
and this difference remained significant throughout the
study period (Table 3). PEEP tended to increase from 12
± 3 to 14 ± 2 cmH2O at day 1, however, this difference
was not statistically significant over time (Table 3). Driv-
ing pressure (Pplat – PEEP) was significantly reduced
during the first 2 days compared to baseline (p <0.05);
there were no significant differences in the values of re-
spiratory system compliance (Fig. 1). At day 1, the
ECCO2R device provided CO2 removal of 81 ± 9 mL/
min at a blood flow rate of 435 ± 60 mL/min and sweep
gas flow rate of 10 ± 0.3 L/min. The efficiency of the
ECCO2R system was stable throughout the study period
(Table 3). Infusion of bicarbonate and renal replacement
therapies for acute kidney injury were never used in this
cohort of patients.

 At day one, the heparin dosage was 341 ± 138 IU/kg/day
with an aPTT ratio of 1.77 ± 0.7, and remained stable over
time. The average baseline value of hemoglobin (Hb) was
10.4 ± 2 gr/dL, and the median Hb threshold for transfu-
sion was 6.9 gr/dL (6.9–7.0). On day 1, four patients re-
ceived 2.25 ± 0.5 red blood cell (RBC) units and 1.25 ± 2.5
pools of platelets. On day 2, only two patients received
1.5 ± 0.7 units of RBCs. On day 3, only one patient re-
ceived two units of RBCs.
Two study-related adverse events were observed. In one
patient, intravascular hemolysis (plasma-free hemoglobin
401.4 mg/dL) was observed resulting in a discontinu-
ation of ECCO2R after 2 days. Kinking of the ECCO2R
catheter caused a reduction in circuit blood flow in an-
other patient. Individual data for patients who needed
rescue therapies for worsening hypoxemia are given in
Table 4. The overall mortality at day 28 was 47 %.
Among
the
eight
survivors,
six
were
successfully
weaned from both ECCO2R and mechanical ventilation;
while two patients were still dependent on ventilator
support at 28 days.
Discussion
The main finding of the current study is that the low-
flow ECCO2R system effectively prevents respiratory
acidosis consequent to the reduction of tidal volume to
4 mL/kg in patients with moderate ARDS. Severe hypox-
emia occurred in about one third of the patients and
was managed by prone positioning in conjunction with
ECCO2R; conversion to VV-ECMO was required in two
patients. Side effects related to ECCO2R (intravascular
hemolysis and pump malfunction by femoral catheter
kinking) were observed in two patients.
The landmark study by the ARDSnet demonstrated a
9 % mortality reduction in patients with ARDS by
limiting plateau pressure to <30 cmH2O [1]. However,
recent studies have shown that patients with ARDS may
still be at risk of VILI despite values of Pplat ≤30 cmH2O
[2, 4, 5]. Terragni [2] and Bellani [4] showed that in
some patients, tidal hyperinflation may still occur des-
pite limiting VT to 6 mL/kg and Pplat to 30 cmH2O, and
that this is associated with biological signs of VILI, such
as higher levels of inflammatory mediators and increased
metabolic activity of the lungs. Grasso and coworkers
showed that hyperinflation might be attenuated by redu-
cing the levels of PEEP based on the shape of the airway
pressure time curve and that this is associated with
lower levels of pulmonary inflammatory cytokine release
[5]. Moreover, Hager and coworkers found that ARDS
patients may benefit from VT reduction even if they
already have Pplat <30 cmH2O [6].
ECCO2R has been proposed to partially clear CO2 and
consequently reduce the need of minute ventilation as
delivered by conventional mechanical ventilation [9].
The first evidence that ECCO2R might be a safe adjunct-
ive therapy to conventional mechanical ventilation for
ARDS patients dates back to the early 1980s [19, 20]. At
that time, a modified veno-venous ECMO circuit with a
blood flow not >1 L/min allowed for dramatic reduc-
tions
of
minute
ventilation
and
ventilator-applied
pressure [19]. More recently, Terragni and colleagues

 demonstrated that a modified renal replacement therapy
circuit with an oxygenator in series with the hemofilter
could facilitate an ultra-protective ventilation strategy,
which may mitigate VILI [8]. Our results extend these
findings by performing a prospective multicenter study
in 15 ARDS patients across four European ICUs.
Monitoring of respiratory mechanics may help clini-
cians in assessing the risk of VILI [17]. In the presence
of normal chest wall elastance, values of Pplat around
30 cmH2O may increase the risk of alveolar hyperin-
flation, which is the main determinant of VILI [2];
analysis of a large dataset including ARDS patients
previously enrolled in clinical trials, shows that driving
pressure (i.e., the ratio of tidal volume to respiratory sys-
tem compliance) is an independent risk factor for hospital
mortality, because regardless of the changes in VT and
PEEP, only changes in driving pressure affected the out-
come [18]. Our data show that an ultra-protective ventila-
tion strategy facilitated by low-flow veno-venous ECCO2R
resulted in values of respiratory mechanics associated with
enhanced protection from VILI as: (1) values of Pplat
around 25 cmH2O, as achieved in this study, have
been associated with lower serum levels of the pro-
inflammatory cytokine
interleukin-6
and a
smaller
percentage of lung hyperinflation, as demonstrated by
computed tomography [2, 7, 8]; and (2) our ultra-
protective ventilation strategy resulted in a significant
reduction in driving pressure. These findings allow us
to speculate that in our patients, global interaction
between moderate-to-high levels of PEEP and very
low tidal volume, facilitated by ECCO2R, might be
beneficial to minimize the risk of VILI.
In recent years, advances in technology have generated
renewed interest in all extracorporeal support tech-
niques. While high flow veno-venous ECMO has been
increasingly used to treat life-threatening hypoxemia
[21, 22], ECCO2R systems are used to provide partial-to-
full CO2 removal with minimal effects on oxygenation
[9]. Appropriate strategies to manage worsening hypox-
emia during ECCO2R treatment is a compelling issue. In
fact, depending on the severity of lung injury, patients
with ARDS may experience worsening of arterial oxy-
genation that might be life threatening [23]. Moreover,
the use of very low tidal volumes may expose patients to
the risk of de-recruitment in the event that insufficient
PEEP is applied. Consequently, prone positioning while
the patient is still on ECCO2R, or shift to high-flow
veno-venous ECMO, might be necessary. In this regard,
prone positioning has been demonstrated to be effective
not only in improving oxygenation but also in decreas-
ing early and late mortality [24]. In the current study, in-
dication for rescue therapies for profound hypoxemia
was not established by protocol. Within the first week of
enrollment 27 % of patients in our cohort required
prone positioning when their PaO2/FiO2 dropped to a
median value of 137. Notably, patients underwent prone
position without any interruption of ECCO2R and had
improvement in arterial oxygenation. Only two patients
required escalation from ECCO2R to ECMO because of
life-threatening hypoxemia. Mortality at 28 days was
47 %, which was expected in a cohort of patients with
moderate and severe ARDS.
Previous-generation ECCO2R systems have carried a
high rate of mechanical complications such as pump
malfunction, membrane clotting, and catheter displace-
ment [8]. In the current study, target blood flow rates
were not reached in one case only due to a kinked cath-
eter; otherwise, the treatment was consistent over time.
Compared with arterio-venous systems in which limb
ischemia,
compartment
syndrome,
and
intracranial
hemorrhage have been described [7], only one case of
intravascular hemolysis requiring transfusion was re-
ported in our series.
Some limitations of this study should be addressed.
First, inferences from this study are limited by its small
sample size. Second, although we speculate that the
strategy tested in this multicenter study was lung-
protective, we did not measure pro-inflammatory media-
tors associated with VILI and we did not evaluate lung
volume/densities distribution with computed tomog-
raphy of the chest. The precise impact of worsening oxy-
genation during ECCO2R treatment is also not clear.
Consequently, this approach will be systematically tested
in an upcoming randomized clinical trial, such as that
under the auspices of European Society of Intensive
Care Medicine, which will test the feasibility, safety
and efficacy of several ECCO2R systems to facilitate
ultra-protective ventilation - VT of 4 mL/kg predicted
body weight (PBW) and Pplat <25 cmH2O - in patients
with moderate and severe ARDS (SUPERNOVA: a strat-
egy of ultraprotective lung ventilation with extracorpor-
eal CO2 removal for new-onset moderate to severe
ARDS) [25].
Conclusions
In conclusion, low-flow ECCO2R is feasible, safe and ef-
ficient. It facilitates an ultra-protective mechanical venti-
lation strategy for reducing tidal volume to 4 mL/kg
to maintain Pplat <25 cmH2O. This approach allows
the delivery of mechanical ventilation with relatively
low driving airway pressures while preserving suffi-
cient gas exchange and preventing hypercapnia and
respiratory acidosis due to reduced ventilation. The
current study provides a clinical and physiological ra-
tionale for testing whether ultra-protective mechanical
ventilation
improves
clinical
outcomes
of
patients
with moderate and severe ARDS in randomized con-
trol trials.
