Background: The pathogenesis of colorectal cancer recurrence after a curative resection remains poorly
understood. A yet-to-be accounted for variable is the composition and function of the microbiome
adjacent to the tumour and its influence on the margins of resection following surgery.
Methods: PubMed was searched for historical as well as current manuscripts dated between 1970 and
2017 using the following keywords: ‘
colorectal cancer recurrence’
, ‘
microbiome’
, ‘
anastomotic leak’
,
‘
anastomotic failure’and ‘
mechanical bowel preparation’
.
Results: There is a substantial and growing body of literature to demonstrate the various mechanisms
by which environmental factors act on the microbiome to alter its composition and function with the net
result of adversely affecting oncological outcomes following surgery. Some of these environmental factors
include diet, antibiotic use, the methods used to prepare the colon for surgery and the physiological stress
of the operation itself.
Conclusion: Interrogating the intestinal microbiome using next-generation sequencing technology has
the potential to influence cancer outcomes following colonic resection.

Introduction
Despite
improvements
in
surgical
technique
and
postoperative surveillance, colorectal cancer recurrence
after pathologically confirmed complete resection remains
a significant problem. Recurrence affects at least 40
per cent of patients, typically occurring within the first
3 years1–3. Historically, disease recurrence has been
attributed to tumour stage, grade, presence of obstruction
or perforation at presentation, presence of lymphovascular
invasion, and the ability to achieve an R0 resection4,5.
Although many factors, both genetic and environmental,
can affect disease recurrence, the intestinal microbiome
(the microbial community membership, structure and
function) has not been viewed as an active participant.
With the development of advanced intestinal sampling
and analysis of both nucleic acids (RNA sequencing) and
protein products (transcriptomics), the intestinal micro-
bial community has emerged as a key component not
only in tumorigenesis, but also in disease-free survival
after surgery. Much of the initial investigation into the
microbiome’
s role in colorectal cancer recurrence has been
sparked by clinical studies in which local recurrence has
been shown to be much higher in patients who developed
anastomotic complications6. The focus of the present
study was how the intestinal microbiome has influenced
our understanding and management of colorectal cancer,
with a particular focus on recurrence.

Microbiome and tumorigenesis
At birth, the gut is first colonized and then stabilized
through adaptation with four dominant phyla: Firmi-
cutes, Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.
Depending on environmental conditions, genetics, the
host’
s immune system, diet, and early exposure to infec-
tion or antibiotics, the presence and dominance of these
species becomes highly varied among healthy individuals7.

With further advances in molecular techniques and bioin-
formatics analysis, a more complete understanding of what
constitutes flux of a healthy microbiome is emerging to
define what constitutes a pathological disturbance in the
microbiome8. Such dysbiosis, or disturbance in micro-
bial community membership, structure or function, can
consist of a loss of specific beneficial bacteria or a crit-
ical loss of diversity among the beneficial bacteria. This
produces a state termed a pathobiome, defined as loss of
the health-promoting microbiome with a predominance of
disease-producing pathogens9,10.
Several studies11–13 have demonstrated an overabun-
dance of Fusobacterium, Alistipes, Porphyromonadaceae,
Coriobacteridae,
Staphylococcaceae,
Akkermansia
and
Methanobacteriales, and lack of Bifidobacterium, Lac-
tobacillus, Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia and
Treponema in patients with colorectal cancer. Although
these microbes may be associated with colorectal cancer,
their causal relationship with disease remains to be clari-
fied. T
o address this, Baxter and colleagues14 analysed the
tumour burden in germ-free mice that were subjected to
a chemical carcinogen and given a faecal transplant with
a sample from either a patient with colorectal cancer or a
healthy patient. Mice that had a microbiome dominated
by Gram-negative Bacteriodes, Parabacteroides, Alistipes and
Akkermansia had a higher tumour burden, regardless of
whether the faecal transplant was from the colorectal
cancer donor or the healthy patient. In this model, the
presence of species within the Clostridium genus had a
negative correlation with tumour count14. A European
study15 reported similar findings after analysing stool
samples following colonoscopy. Patients with colorectal
cancer were more likely to have an abundance of the
Gram-negative phylum of Fusobacteria and a decrease in
the Gram-positive phylum of Actinobacteria. The pres-
ence of Fusobacterium also showed a positive correlation
in biopsy samples of adenomas compared with biopsies
of normal tissue16. This bacterium is thought to acti-
vate the FadA adhesin, which binds to an extracellular
domain of E-cadherin, triggering invasion and activat-
ing WNT signalling, leading to promotion of tumour
growth17. Additionally, it can inhibit T cell-mediated
immune responses against colorectal cancer cells16,18,19.
The abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA has also
been correlated positively with advanced disease stage and
higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality20. Bacteriodes
fragilis is another bacterium that is associated with poor
disease-free survival in patients with colorectal cancer20,
and has been shown to cleave E-cadherin and enhance
WNT/B-catenin signalling while also increasing the
expression of MYC21.
Impact of neoadjuvant therapy
Colorectal cancer is commonly treated with cytotoxic
agents,
such
as
5-fluorouracil
(5-FU),
capecitabine
and oxaliplatin, that interfere with DNA replication22.
Platinum-based antineoplastic therapeutics such as oxali-
platin cause severe toxicity in multiple organ systems,
including intestinal, renal and auricular. Its toxicities also
affect the intestinal microbiome via damage to the rapidly
regenerating intestinal mucosal cells, breaching immuno-
logical barriers, and altering environmental cytokines and
inflammatory markers. Although the presence of a gut
microbiota is not necessary for oxaliplatin to penetrate
the tumour and induce genetic damage, the production
of reactive oxygen species and antitumour effects requires
the presence of certain bacterial species, such as Lac-
tobacillus acidophilus, for cisplatin-induced inflammatory
gene expression23. Mouse studies have shown that the
gut microbiota may modulate local immune responses, in
turn affecting chemotherapy and immunotherapy24–27. Yu
and co-workers28 found that autophagy-related pathways
are enriched and activated in patients with colorectal
cancer and a high amount of F. nucleatum, promoting colo-
rectal cancer chemoresistance. F. nucleatum has been found
to attach to the host epithelial E-cadherin, promoting
colorectal carcinogenesis via the fusobacterial adhesion
FadA17. F nucleatum has also been found to mediate chemo-
resistance through targeting specific micro-RNA and
autophagy elements. Its direct association with colorectal
cancer recurrence has even been posited as a method of pre-
dicting patient outcomes or modifying chemotherapeutic
regimens, such as the inclusion of capecitabine and oxali-
platin, for patients with a high burden of F. nucleatum28.
Chemotherapy resistance in non-malignant cells is well
described29. When Geller et al.30 co-cultured human
dermal fibroblasts with colorectal cancer cell lines, the
cancer cells were found to be more resistant to the chemo-
therapeutic drug gemcitabine. It was found that Mycoplasma
hyorhinis exposure to human dermal fibroblasts resulted
in the metabolism of gemcitabine into its deaminated and
inactive metabolite 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine, rendering
the chemotherapeutic ineffective. In a cursory exploration
of 27 bacterial species, 13 were found to eliminate the
effect of gemcitabine on human colorectal cancer cells30.
A broad understanding of the chemotherapeutic resistance
conferred by changes in the microbiota awaits further
exploration.
Radiotherapy is genotoxic for tumour cells, but affects
non-targeted and non-irradiated cells through changes in
inflammatory and immune reactivity, as well as genomic
instability31,32. Gap junction proteins are disrupted and
mediators such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide,

cytokines and exosomes are released33–37. Although there
is interplay between the mechanisms of the microbiota and
the effects of radiation therapy, there are several crossovers
that warrant consideration. The abscopal effect, wherein
distant metastases regress with irradiation of the pri-
mary tumour, is an immune-mediated response requiring
the activation of antigenic presenting dendritic cells and
immune T cells, interactions that have long been known to
be deeply influenced by the microbiome25,26,38. The clini-
cal effects of radiation therapy include oral mucositis, diar-
rhoea, enteritis and colitis, which are manifestations of and
precursors to microbiotal disruption39,40.
In addition to the clinical features mentioned above,
radiotherapy is a known risk factor for anastomotic leak,
having been determined to triple the rate of anasto-
motic failure41. Radiation has been shown to induce endo-
thelial cell dysfunction, marked by increased permeability,
detachment from the underlying basement membrane and
apoptosis42,43. The reduced vascular density and thickening
of the intimal layer result in some parenchymal tissue not
receiving perfusion44, creating an ischaemic environment
known to deplete health-promoting obligate anaerobes
such as Bacteroides and Clostridia, while allowing facultative
anaerobes such as Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae to
flourish45. In a mechanism similar to how anastomotic tis-
sues select for microbes that express enhanced virulence,
irradiated tissue can be expected to do the same given
its resultant vascular damage, killing of rapidly prolif-
erating epithelial cells and mucositis46. The commensal
intestinal bacteria and their T
oll-like receptors (TLRs)
are known to be necessary for the regulation of intesti-
nal homeostasis, with its interaction with the nuclear factor
(NF) κB pathway protecting intestinal epithelial cells from
radiation-induced apoptosis47.
The authors’laboratory has demonstrated using in vivo
animal modelling that preoperative radiotherapy plus inoc-
ulation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa leads to a significant
incidence of anastomotic leak compared with radiotherapy
alone. Phenotype analysis of the original inoculating strain
versus the strain recovered from the anastomotic tissues
after irradiation demonstrated an alteration in pyocyanin
production, enhanced swarming motility, high collagenase
production and a destructive phenotype against epithe-
lial cells (apoptosis, loss of barrier function, cytolysis).
Comparative genotype analysis revealed a single nucleotide
polymorphism mutation in the mexT gene, and its replace-
ment led to reversion of the preinoculation/irradiation
phenotype48. Work in Drosophila has shown that intestinal
infection with P. aeruginosa activates the c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) pathway, which leads to apoptosis of entero-
cytes and proliferation of stem cells49.
Impact of surgery
Although it is likely that patients with colorectal cancer har-
bour a pathobiome that plays a significant role in tumori-
genesis, the role, if any, that this may play in recovery from
surgery and/or recurrence remains to be clarified. Using
a reverse transcriptase–quantitative polymerase chain
reaction, Ohigashi and colleagues50 reported that obligate
anaerobes such as Clostridium coccoides, C. leptum, B. fragilis,
Bifidobacterium, Atopobium and Prevotella, bacteria impor-
tant in maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis51, are
diminished following colorectal cancer surgery. In contrast,
pathogens associated with surgical complications such as
the facultative anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, Entero-
coccus and Staphylococcus, as well as the aerobe Pseudomonas,
were observed to be increased after surgery. The functional
impact of this response was considered to be significant,
given the additional finding of depletion of short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), which serve as a key energy source
for colonocytes. SCFAs are well established bacterial
exoproductions that maintain epithelial barrier function,
prevent infection, suppress ammonia absorption and pro-
mote apoptosis in tumour cells52–54. The extent to which
these changes are predictive of complications and tumour
recurrence is presently unknown.
Anastomotic leak and colorectal cancer
recurrence
Anastomotic leak is known to have a significant impact on
hospital costs, length of stay, morbidity and mortality55–57.
The incidence varies from 1 to 19 per cent depending on
definitions and types of anastomosis58–60. Reported local
recurrence rates of colorectal cancer vary between 1 and
23 per cent, with recurrence affecting an average of 8 per
cent of surgical patients61. Curiously, the majority of recur-
rences are perianastomotic, occurring in the extramural
tissue, and only 12 per cent occur intraluminally62,63. The
molecular mechanisms for this finding remain unknown.
A number of studies6,55,64 have shown that anastomotic
leak is associated with increased local recurrence and
reduced disease-free survival in patients with colorectal
cancer. Although this could be due to a delay in adju-
vant therapy, several mechanistic theories are worthy of
discussion in the context of the microbiome: implanta-
tion of exfoliated tumour cells on to the anastomotic site,
metachronous carcinogenesis and inflammation-mediated
carcinogenesis65–67.
Of note, viable colorectal cancer cells invariably persist
in the bowel lumen after surgical resection. These cells are
clones of the original tumour and harbour the capability for
implantation into remote tissues68,69. In nine of ten patients

who undergo surgery for colorectal cancer malignant cells
remain on tissues discarded from the circular stapling
device70. A more recent study71 demonstrated that over
half of patients undergoing a right hemicolectomy for col-
orectal cancer had exfoliated malignant cells in lavage fluid
collected from the anastomotic site. Remarkably, there was
no correlation between tumour size or depth of invasion
and the presence of residual colorectal cancer cells71.
Another mechanism of local recurrence that has been
suggested
is
metachronous
carcinogenesis
or
‘
field
cancerization’
72.
Umeto
and
co-workers73
suggested
that microenviromental changes in the region of the pri-
mary tumour can lead to genetic instability resulting in
new tumour growth near the anastomotic site. A third
theory relates to the impact of acute-phase reactants
and inflammatory mediators on cancer biology. Several
studies74–77 have demonstrated that the presence of
inflammatory biomarkers (tumour necrosis factor, inter-
leukin (IL) 1, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
vascular endothelial growth factor) can lead to tumour
progression, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy.
Salvans et al.78 demonstrated that peritoneal liquid sam-
ples surrounding a postoperative infection have the ability
to enhance proliferation, migration and invasiveness of
colorectal cancer cells in vitro.
An additional mechanism worthy of discussion is the
possible attraction of circulating colorectal cancer cells
to sites of inflammation; this could explain the lack of
intraluminal tumour recurrence. Circulating tumour cells,
a prognostic and predictive factor for progression-free and
overall survival79, can seed multiple organs, but metastatic
tumours may grow in only one or a few places80. Angio-
genic dormancy is a phenomenon by which a balance
of proliferation and apoptosis results in micrometastases
that do not progress81,82, suppressing the malignancy
to metastatic cells until hospitable perturbations in the
microenvironment allow their reactivation. Sites of inflam-
mation promote systemic conditions that continuously
recruit inflammatory cells to the tumour mass75, setting
up a cascade of events by which the tumour-promoting
effects of immune cells (wound repair, angiogenesis, cell
proliferation83) can be progressively amplified, resulting in
the recurrence of local cancer at the antiluminal surface of
the intestine with exposure to circulating tumour cells and
a consistently inflammatory environment creating the soil
for the seed.
In the context of anastomotic leak and the microbiome,
it is possible that many of the above mechanisms act in
concert to drive tumour recurrence following colorectal
cancer surgery. Once a leak occurs, there is often a long
period of inanition, resulting in poor nutritional status,
hospital confinement with further exposure to pathogens,
the physiological stress of a second operation, and ongo-
ing infection and inflammation, often requiring prolonged
exposure to antibiotics and invasive procedures. Under
such circumstances, the intestinal microbiome can not only
become depleted, but may also be transformed to a patho-
biome capable of inducing further anastomotic inflamma-
tion and seeding of exfoliated cells to anastomotic sites.
The extent to which an anastomotic leak disrupts the
local microenvironment and potentially leads to colo-
rectal cancer recurrence remains to be elucidated. Fur-
thermore, the extent to which loss of the microbiome,
the presence of a pathobiome, or both, drive tumorigen-
esis remains to be clarified. It is now well established that
the presence of the normal microbiota plays a key role
in maintaining both local intestinal and systemic immune
function24,25. In addition, the presence of certain highly
pathogenic species in the gut, permissively promoted by
loss of the competitive exclusion by the normal micro-
biome (colonization resistance), can directly suppress the
immune system84. Whether these factors influence exfoli-
ated colorectal cancer cells to implant on to anastomotic
tissues and migrate into deeper tissues remains to be fully
explored.
Previous work from the authors’laboratory has demon-
strated that anastomotic leak can occur when the normal
microbiome is depleted and low abundance strains such as
Enterococcus faecalis predominate. Pathogens such as E. fae-
calis can drive the pathogenesis of anastomotic leak as they
possess high collagenase activity and activate (MMP-9),
key contributors to tissue breakdown and intestinal
inflammation85. MMPs are a group of proteolytic enzymes
that mediate extracellular matrix degradation and regulate
the release of growth factors, chemokines and adhesion
proteins86. High levels of MMP-9, a gelatinase MMP with
type IV collagen as its primary substrate, have been shown
to be a marker of invasion and worsen the oncological
outcome in patients with colorectal cancer87–89. That E.
faecalis strains seem to play a major role in anastomotic
leak pathogenesis and remain present at anastomotic
tissues despite current methods of preparing the bowel
for surgery50, suggests that one overlooked element in
local recurrence may be suppression of the microbiome
and the presence of a highly inflammatory pathobiome.
These collagenase-producing strains of E. faecalis in a
GelE/SprE-dependent manner can interact with resident
macrophages and shift cultured mouse colonic epithe-
lial cells to express a mesenchyme-like phenotype with
aggressive invasive features, similar to the epithelial mes-
enchymal transition that is involved in cancer metastasis90
(Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Hypothesized mechanism of colorectal cancer recurrence following surgical resection. Across the continuum of care to treat
colorectal cancer (preoperative chemoradiotherapy, antibiotics, surgical resection), a unique environmental context is created that
promotes colonization by collagenase-producing microbes (Enterococcus faecalis) followed by implantation of cancer cells, which are shed
continuously both during and after surgery. High collagenase-producing microbes may activate local macrophages such that
anastomotic healing is impaired in a manner that promotes shed cancer cells to implant and migrate to extramucosal sites, leading to
local tumour recurrence. MMP, matrix metalloproteinase

biota may serve as a prognostic biomarker of survival in
patients with colorectal cancer. Flanagan and colleagues91

survival
in
patients with colorectal cancer with higher levels of
F. nucleatum. The presence of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis in
the colonic mucosa was associated with a higher colorectal
cancer stage92. Wei and co-workers20 concluded that
abundance of F. nucleatum or B. fragilis was a prognostic
biomarker of poor survival, associated with increased levels
of inflammatory mediators including MMP-9. In addition,
B. fragilis can induce NF-κB signalling and release of
inflammatory cytokines93. Thus, one intervention that
has the capability to shape the microbiome before surgery
and potentially downstage colorectal cancer is mechanical
and antibiotic bowel preparation. The extent to which
current bowel preparation methods affect gut microbial
community composition, refaunation, overall morbidity
and oncological survival remains inadequately studied and
largely unknown.
Bowel preparation in the genomic era
Bowel preparation, including the use of oral and intra-
venous antibiotics, is a topic of much debate in general
and colorectal surgery. Historically, the goal was exten-
sive decontamination with mechanical bowel preparation
(MBP), which includes mechanical cleansing and oral
non-absorbable antibiotics, to prevent anastomotic com-
plications and surgical-site infections. In the 1990s, as
outcomes of colonic surgery improved, there was a move
to eliminate MBP. Multiple studies seemed to suggest that
full MBP, including purgative cleansing and oral antibi-
otics, was unnecessary. An RCT94 and a meta-analysis95
failed to find evidence that MBP decreased postoperative
infectious complications.
However, with the ability to mine large databases
electronically, more recent studies96,97 have validated
the
original
practice
of
MBP
combined
with
oral
antibiotics, demonstrating a decrease in anastomotic
leak and surgical-site infection rates. The effect of bowel
preparation on oncological outcome is largely unknown

and there is conflicting evidence regarding the impact of
MBP on the long-term survival of patients with colorectal
cancer98,99. Among the many reasons for this conflicting
evidence is that the scientific basis of the components
of the MBP relative to overall efficacy has not been
properly elucidated. As such, the current approach of a
broad-based ‘
kill’ strategy suffers from the empiricism
of its original formulation and its lack of recalibration to
the shifting demographics of human populations, their
ever-evolving microbiome, and the selective pressures on
human pathogens that drive disease.
The inherent flaw of a broad-based intestinal decon-
tamination approach to prepare the bowel for surgery
is the lack of recognition that a diverse gut microbiome
actually serves to suppress the development of potentially
harmful pathobiota and promotes intestinal healing100.
With next-generation technology, including microbial
metagenomics, it is possible to define the scientific basis of
a ‘
bowel prep 2.0’
. For example, one might consider gentle
cleansing of the bowel along with nutritional supplements
and non-microbicidal antivirulence agents101, rather than
mass destruction of the microbiome, as is current practice.
Preliminary studies have addressed this issue with selective
gut decontamination. In an RCT, Reddy and colleagues102
studied the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae after various
combinations of MBP, neomycin and/or synbiotics. There
was a significant reduction in Enterobacteriaceae in faecal
samples and in bacterial translocation after bowel mobil-
ization when the patients were administered synbiotics
with neomycin and MBP. However, this selective decon-
tamination and preservation of the intestinal barrier was
not associated with postoperative systemic inflammatory
response or rate of septic complications102. Although the
results did not significantly alter septic morbidity, a similar
concept is already being implemented with hydration and
nutritional supplementation solutions being administered
within 2 h of elective surgery, rather than the overnight
starvation that was practised in many centres until recently.
Several randomized trials have demonstrated that patients
consuming preoperative oral carbohydrate supplementa-
tion had a shorter hospital stay103,104, improved metabolic
profiles,
and
attenuated
inflammatory
responses
to
surgery105,106.
Bowel preparation as it relates to colorectal cancer
recurrence
These evolving concepts may inform the design of a
more targeted bowel preparation solution, with the
potential to reduce inflammation and colorectal cancer
recurrence rates after surgery. For example, butyrate
is produced by bacteria during the breakdown of fibre
and carbohydrates. It is a SCFA that is used as a fuel
source for colonocytes, and is an inhibitor of histone
deacetylases, which suppress the proliferation of col-
orectal cancer cells107. Other additives to ‘
bowel prep
2.0’ might include key nutrients that are known to sup-
press bacterial virulence among problematic pathogens
such as P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis without affecting
their growth, thus allowing the normal microbiota to
proliferate and further suppress pathogen virulence.
Such an approach has the potential to induce benefi-
cial effects on the mucosal epithelium and underlying
immune cells by producing a more balanced, diverse
microbiome108. It would be interesting to follow the
patients studied in the randomized trial102 that found
selective
gut
decontamination
eliminated
Entero-
bactericeae from the faeces. Whether this practice altered
the colonic cancer recurrence rates in these patients could
then be interrogated.
Previous work from the authors’laboratory has shown
that pathogens with the capacity to proliferate when the
microbiota become depleted, such as P. aeruginosa, E.
faecalis and Serratia marcescens, can produce collagenase
and elicit intestinal inflammation leading to anastomotic
leak48,85. It was observed that merely providing oral
non-absorbable phosphate, a key nutrient that becomes
depleted following surgical injury and is known to sup-
press pathogen virulence, can prevent bacteria-mediated
anastomotic leak in animals109. Because elements such
as SCFAs and phosphate actually promote the pro-
liferation of bacteria, a balanced solution of a ‘
bowel
prep 2.0’
, containing both nutrients and antivirulence
agents, might represent a more scientifically validated
approach to preparing the bowel for surgery that allows
for purgative cleansing while preserving the important
function of the normal microbiota (Fig. 2). The appli-
cation of next-generation technology to analyse the
effect of our current approach to preparing the bowel
for surgery promises to inform the design of future
formulations to prevent surgical-site infections, remote
infections, anastomotic leakage and colorectal cancer
recurrence.

Fig. 2 Theoretical perioperative microbiome disruption. As the
body undergoes various stressors, such as antibacterial and
purgative preoperative preparation, as well as surgical
manipulation, the microbiome changes accordingly. In
aggregate, these factors provide stress to the microbiome with a
reduction in commensal bacteria and a proliferation of
low-abundance γ proteobacteria that cause infection.
The point of susceptibility to infection (*) marks a theoretical
time point at which the virulence activation of pathogenic
bacteria and the suppression of healing-promoting species
would make the patient most likely to become infected. It is a
vulnerable period that determines whether future postoperative
recovery is complicated by microbial dissemination. FMT, faecal
microbiota transplant; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids
treatment strategies. Many serious infections following
colorectal cancer surgery are a surprise to surgeons who
have done their best perform safe and effective procedures.
Understanding changes in the human microbiome and
the phenotypes they express over the course of high-risk
surgery represents the next phase of a genetic approach
to inform patient care. Implicit in this approach will be to
understand, at a high-resolution molecular level, how best
to prepare the bowel in the perioperative period. This will
require that we depart from the tradition of empiricism
and apply next-generation sequencing in designing future
formulations to control the influence of the microbiome on
surgical outcomes. This should reduce surgical-site infec-
tions, anastomotic leaks and colorectal cancer recurrences
through scientific endeavour rather than a traditional
conservatist dogma.
