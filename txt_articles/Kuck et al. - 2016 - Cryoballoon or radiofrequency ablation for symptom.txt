Aims
The primary safety and efficacy endpoints of the randomized FIRE AND ICE trial have recently demonstrated
non-inferiority of cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency current (RFC) catheter ablation in patients with drug-refractory
symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the current study was to assess outcome parameters that
are important for the daily clinical management of patients using key secondary analyses. Specifically, reinterventions, re-
hospitalizations, and quality-of-life were examined in this randomized trial of cryoballoon vs. RFC catheter ablation.
Methods
and results
Patients (374 subjects in the cryoballoon group and 376 subjects in the RFC group) were evaluated in the modified
intention-to-treat cohort. After the index ablation, log-rank testing over 1000 days of follow-up demonstrated that
there were statistically significant differences in favour of cryoballoon ablation with respect to repeat ablations
(11.8% cryoballoon vs. 17.6% RFC; P ¼ 0.03), direct-current cardioversions (3.2% cryoballoon vs. 6.4% RFC;
P ¼ 0.04), all-cause rehospitalizations (32.6% cryoballoon vs. 41.5% RFC; P ¼ 0.01), and cardiovascular rehospitalizations
(23.8% cryoballoon vs. 35.9% RFC; P , 0.01). There were no statistical differences between groups in the quality-of-life
surveys (both mental and physical) as measured by the Short Form-12 health survey and the EuroQol five-dimension
questionnaire. There was an improvement in both mental and physical quality-of-life in all patients that began at 6 months
after the index ablation and was maintained throughout the 30 months of follow-up.
Conclusion
Patients treated with cryoballoon as opposed to RFC ablation had significantly fewer repeat ablations, direct-current
cardioversions, all-cause rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations during follow-up. Both patient groups
improved in quality-of-life scores after AF ablation.

 Introduction
FIRE AND ICE was the first large randomized controlled trial to
compare the efficacy and safety of the single-step cryoballoon abla-
tion technique with the point-by-point radiofrequency current
(RFC) ablation approach in symptomatic patients with paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation (AF).1 The trial confirmed its primary efficacy ob-
jective of the non-inferiority of cryoballoon ablation at 1 year with
estimated event rates (first documented recurrence of AF, occur-
rence of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, use of antiarrhythmic
drugs, or repeat ablation outside a 90-day blanking period) of
34.6% in the cryoballoon and 35.9% in the RFC arm [hazard ratio
(HR) ¼ 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76–1.22; P , 0.001
for non-inferiority]. Overall safety was also not significantly different
(1 year Kaplan–Meier event rate estimates, 10.2% with cryoballoon
and 12.8% with RFC; HR ¼ 0.78; 95% CI: 0.52–1.18; P ¼ 0.24).
While the first FIRE AND ICE report focused on primary out-
comes, this current report will focus on secondary endpoints and
additional analyses that have important implications on daily clinical
practice, including all-cause rehospitalization after the index proced-
ure (which encompasses all repeat ablations for atrial arrhythmias),
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular rehospitalizations, and
direct-current cardioversions (DCCVs). Also, the analysis includes
an assessment of the quality-of-life surveys for both mental and
physical function throughout the 30 months of follow-up.
Methods
Study design and procedure overview
The FIRE AND ICE trial (NCT01490814) was a multicentre, rando-
mized, blinded-outcomes, parallel-group evaluation of cryoballoon
and RFC catheter ablation in patients being treated for drug-refractory
and symptomatic paroxysmal AF.1,2 A study design manuscript and the
primary endpoints have been separately published.1,2 In brief, each treat-
ment centre approved the study design with their local ethics review
committee(s), and patient informed consent was obtained prior to en-
rolment. Patients were randomized to either cryoballoon ablation using
the Arctic FrontTM family of catheters (Medtronic) or RFC catheter ab-
lation using the ThermoCoolw series of catheters (Biosense Webster).
During the index procedure, the (1:1) randomly selected ablation
modality was used in the left atrium to electrically isolate the pulmonary
veins (PVs).3–5 In the cryoballoon procedures, pulmonary vein isolation
(PVI) was achieved using fluoroscopic guidance to position the cryobal-
loon catheter. Once PV-to-balloon occlusion was confirmed by retro-
grade radiopaque contrast agent retention, circumferential ablation
was performed by freezing with a ‘single-shot’ delivery of coolant to
the balloon. In the RFC procedure, PVI was achieved using a focal
‘point-by-point’ catheter approach, which delivers heat energy to the
cardiac tissue. RFC lesion sets encircle the PV antra using electroanato-
mical mapping for guidance. In both cohorts, a PVI-only strategy was
used to ablate AF, and acute index procedure success was documented
in both arms with diagnostic testing. All investigators demonstrated the
success of PVI by the abolition of conduction of atrial impulses into the
PVs. After the index procedure, subjects were followed in this study for
up to 33 months.1,2 In both groups, subjects were followed-up for a
mean time of 1.54 +0.8 years.1
In the publication of the primary endpoints, the data were presented
as time-to-first event reported per subject, and a 90-day blanking period
was predefined.1 Recurrences of atrial arrhythmias and repeat ablations
within the 90-day blanking period did not contribute towards the pri-
mary endpoint.1 However, robust clinical data were collected (on rein-
terventions and rehospitalizations) in this trial both within the 90-day
blanking period and after the primary endpoint event to allow for the
analyses of the current presented endpoints. The data presented in
this current analysis are the total clinical events that were documented
in this trial from the index procedure through the study exit for each
subject to provide a comprehensive summary of the disease burden
to the patients and to the healthcare systems.
Rehospitalization
During the trial, study sites were required to report all patient rehospi-
talizations after the index ablation procedure.2 All-cause rehospitaliza-
tions are inclusive of every recorded event, and cardiovascular
rehospitalizations are a subset of all-cause rehospitalizations. Both
repeat ablations and DCCVs are specific rehospitalization events that
occur within cardiovascular rehospitalizations. In the study, a rehospita-
lization was defined as a prolonged stay (i.e. of two or more nights) or an
in-patient stay of more than one calendar day (i.e. at least one overnight
stay) not concurrent with the index ablation procedure. The pre-
specified main causes for cardiovascular rehospitalization included
(i) unstable or stable angina or atypical chest pain; (ii) syncope;

 (iii) transient ischaemic attack or stroke; (iv) non-fatal cardiac arrest;
(v) ventricular arrhythmia; (vi) cardiac transplantation; (vii) any type of
cardiovascular surgery; (viii) implantation of a pacemaker, implantable
cardioverter defibrillator, or any other cardiac device; (ix) percutaneous
coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral intervention; (x) blood-
pressure-related rehospitalization; (xi) cardiovascular infection; (xii) ma-
jor bleeding; (xiii) pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis; and
(xiv) other adjudicated cardiovascular events, including atrial arrhythmias.
A complete list of cardiovascular rehospitalization events are given in the
Supplementary material online (see Supplementary material online, Table
S3). Any hospital stay planned prior to the index intervention was not
considered a rehospitalization in this analysis.
Quality-of-life
Quality-of-life was assessed using the Medical Outcome Study Short
Form-12 (SF-12) questionnaire to evaluate the subject’s mental and
physical performance at baseline and every 6 months after the index ab-
lation procedure for up to 30 months. Physical and mental health com-
posite scores are calculated using responses to 12 questions with a
response range from 0 to 100, where a 0 score indicates the lowest level
of health measured by the scale and 100 indicates the highest level of
health. Questionnaires were completed without input from study per-
sonnel. Additionally in this study, an estimate of generic health status
was made using the EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire,
during the same period of examination. The EQ-5D-3L (used in this

 study) measures five dimensions of health, including (i) mobility, (ii) self-
care, (iii) physical activities, (iv) pain and discomfort, and (v) anxiety and
depression. This survey uses a three-tier evaluation indicating no prob-
lem, some problem, or extreme problem. The EQ-5D-3L uses a scale
that measures up to one, which is the best health imaginable, and all
measurements (in this study) were analysed using the utility score based
on the US value set.
Statistical analyses
Data analyses were conducted using the modified intention-to-treat
(mITT) study populations (consistent with previous presentations of
the data).1,2 The mITT evaluation consisted of those patients that
were enrolled and randomized (n ¼ 762), with subjects removed due
to screening failures (n ¼ 6), withdrawal of consent (n ¼ 4), declining
ablation (n ¼ 1), and being mentally unfit for study (n ¼ 1).1 In the
mITT examination, 374 subjects comprised the cryoballoon group,
and 376 subjects were included in the RFC group.1 This cohort is inclu-
sive of four subjects treated with a non-study RFC catheter (St. Jude
Medical), and five subjects treated with a ThermoCool RFC catheter
originally randomized to the cryoballoon group.
Repeat ablations, rehospitalizations, and DCCVs are presented in
two formats: as dot plots showing the number of events by days since
the index procedure and as Kaplan–Meier event-free survival curves.
Time-to-first events between the cryoballoon and RFC arms are com-
pared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression mod-
el was utilized to assess consistency across subgroups for cardiovascular
hospitalization rates. For each subgroup, a Wald test for interaction was
performed. A subgroup interaction term was considered significant for
P , 0.05. Kaplan–Meier survival curves are presented for the sub-
groups with significant interaction terms. Hazard ratios for hospitaliza-
tion rates and subgroup hospitalization rates are estimated with a Cox
proportional-hazards model.
Changes in quality-of-life (SF-12 and EQ-5D-3L scores) are presented
as mean + standard deviation from baseline. Box plots are utilized to
graphically display the changes in SF-12 scores over the study visits. A lin-
ear mixed model (accounting for repeated quality-of-life measurements
within a subject across visits) was utilized to compare quality-of-life scores
between the groups. t-Tests were utilized to assess quality-of-life changes
from baseline within a group.
Quality-of-life, cardiovascular rehospitalization, and repeat ablation
examinations were predefined in the study protocol and the statistical
analysis plan. All-cause hospitalization and DCCV analyses were not
predefined; however, the data fields were present in the case report
form. No adjustments were made for multiple testing. All analyses
were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and
the R statistical package, version 3.2.2 (www.r-project.org).
Results
Rehospitalization
As depicted in Figure 1A, 49 repeat ablations were conducted in 44
subjects (44/374; 11.8%) in the cryoballoon group and 70 repeat ab-
lations were conducted in 66 subjects (66/376; 17.6%) in the RFC
group. As shown in Figure 1B, a log-rank test confirmed that the cryo-
balloon group had a statistically significant lower rate of repeat abla-
tion compared with the RFC group [HR ¼ 0.65 (95% CI: 0.45–0.95);
P ¼ 0.03]. As shown in Figure 2A, 210 all-cause rehospitalizations oc-
curred in 122 subjects (122/374; 32.6%) in the cryoballoon group
when compared with 267 all-cause rehospitalizations that occurred
in 156 subjects (156/376; 41.5%) in the RFC group. A log-rank test
confirmed that there was a statistical difference, with the cryoballoon
cohort having fewer all-cause rehospitalizations [HR ¼ 0.72 (95% CI:
0.57–0.91); P ¼ 0.01; Figure 2A]. When examining cardiovascular
rehospitalizations, Figure 2B demonstrates that 139 cardiovascular re-
hospitalizations occurred in 89 subjects (89/374; 23.8%) of the cryo-
balloon group, whereas 203 cardiovascular rehospitalizations
occurred in 135 subjects (135/376; 35.9%) of the RFC group. Statis-
tical analysis by log-rank test demonstrated that the cryoballoon
group had fewer cardiovascular rehospitalizations compared
with the RFC group [HR ¼ 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47–0.80); P , 0.01;
Figure 2B]. The entire rehospitalization data set is summarized in
Table 1, and the cardiovascular rehospitalizations are further detailed
in the Supplementary material online.
Direct-current cardioversions
post-ablation
As shown in Figure 3A, 13 DCCVs were administered during follow-
up to 12 subjects (12/374; 3.2%) in the cryoballoon group, whereas
28 DCCVs were given to 24 subjects (24/376; 6.4%) in the RFC
group. As illustrated in Figure 3B, a log-rank test demonstrated a sig-
nificant difference between the cryoballoon group and the RFC
group with regard to DCCV after the index ablation [HR ¼ 0.49
(95% CI: 0.25–0.98); P ¼ 0.04].

 Cardiovascular rehospitalization
subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses of cardiovascular hospitalization rates are
displayed in Figure 4A. For all subgroups, cardiovascular rehospitali-
zation rates were consistently lower in the cryoballoon group (all
HRs ,1). Two subgroups had significant interaction terms, prior
(history of) DCCV (P ¼ 0.02) and CHA2DS2-VASc (P ¼ 0.01), indi-
cating the treatment effect as measured by cardiovascular rehospi-
talization rate was different within the subgroups. In the prior
DCCV subgroup, cardiovascular rehospitalization rates were
20.9% (18/86) in the cryoballoon group vs. 48.9% (43/88) in the
RFC group [HR ¼ 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20–0.59); P , 0.01]. In the no
prior DCCV subgroup, cardiovascular rehospitalization rates were
24.7% (71/288) in the cryoballoon group vs. 31.9% (92/288) in the
RFC group [HR ¼ 0.74 (95% CI: 0.54–1.01); P ¼ 0.05]. The cryo-
balloon group had significantly lower cardiovascular rehospitaliza-
tion rates in each subgroup, even more so in the prior DCCV
subgroup (Figure 4B). In the CHA2DS2-VASc (0–1 subgroup), car-
diovascular rehospitalization rates were 13.3% (22/166) in the cryo-
balloon group vs. 31.8% (56/176) in the RFC group [HR ¼ 0.36
(95% CI: 0.22–0.60); P , 0.01]. In the CHA2DS2-VASc (2–5 sub-
group), cardiovascular rehospitalization rates were 32.2% (67/208)
in the cryoballoon group vs. 39.5% (79/200) in the RFC group
[HR ¼ 0.78 (95% CI: 0.56–1.07); P ¼ 0.13]. The cryoballoon
group had lower cardiovascular rehospitalization rates in each sub-
group but more significant in the CHA2DS2-VASc 0–1 subgroup.
Quality-of-life
As demonstrated in Figure 5, there was an improvement in the
quality-of-life parameters (both mental and physical) when evaluat-
ing patients with the SF-12 questionnaire throughout the 30 months
of follow-up. There was no statistical difference between the abla-
tion modalities. The improvements in both mental and physical
scores were first observed at 6 months of follow-up in both ablation

 groups, and they were maintained throughout the study out to the
30-month follow-up visit. Table 2 summarizes the SF-12 and
EQ-5D-3L results at 6 and 12 months, with a test of significance con-
ducted between baseline and 6 months results.
Trial cohorts
Throughout this analysis, the mITT cohort was utilized; however, it
is noted that the study can be presented using an ‘as-treated’ cohort.
Specifically, nine patients may be re-assigned to evaluate the data set
by the ablation modality used in the index procedure. In an as-
treated cohort, four subjects treated with a non-study RFC catheter
(St. Jude Medical) were removed from the data set, and five subjects
treated with a ThermoCool RFC catheter (but randomized to the
cryoballoon group) were removed from the cryoballoon group
and re-allocated to the RFC group. An examination of the as-treated
cohorts is given in the Supplementary material online. The results of
the mITT and as-treated analyses were almost identical, and only
post-ablation DCCVs changed in statistical significance when exam-
ining the as-treated cohort.
Discussion
The FIRE AND ICE trial showed non-inferiority in efficacy and safety
of cryoballoon vs. RFC ablation in symptomatic patients with parox-
ysmal AF.1 However, the analyses of the secondary endpoints as
shown in this article demonstrated significant differences during
follow-up in favour of cryoballoon ablation, which are clinically rele-
vant and of importance from a patient disease burden and health eco-
nomical point of view.6,7 Mainly, the cryoballoon ablation group had
significantly fewer reinterventions (repeat ablations and DCCVs), all-
cause rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations. Only
the quality-of-life measurements were not statistically different be-
tween groups. But both trial groups showed improvements in the
mental and physical aspects of the quality-of-life assessment at
6 months after the index ablation, which were maintained throughout
the 30 months of follow-up.
Previous studies mainly in patients undergoing RFC ablation have
shown that hospitalization rates are nearly 40% (within the first
year) following AF ablation, with �10% occurring within the first
30 days post-ablation.6,7 Atrial firillation-related readmission rates
were as high as 22% at the 12-month follow-up.6,7 Also, �10% of
all patients underwent a repeat ablation, exposing patients to the
same potential of procedural complications as during the index ab-
lation.4,6,7 In FIRE AND ICE, very similar rates were found across the
entire study for repeat ablation, all-cause rehospitalization, and car-
diovascular rehospitalization. However, when comparing both abla-
tion groups, there was a decrease in rehospitalization rates for the
cryoballoon group when examining relative reductions, including a
33% reduction in repeat ablations, a 50% reduction in DCCVs, a
21% reduction in all-cause rehospitalizations, and a 34% reduction
in cardiovascular rehospitalizations. By comparison, the FreezeAF
study (a smaller single-centre study of cryoballoon vs. RFC evaluat-
ing mostly first generation catheters; NCT00774566) did not detect
a statistical difference in redo procedures (19.9% with cryoballoon
vs. 19.5% with RFC; P ¼ 0.933).8 However, the redo procedure
criteria in FreezeAF were different. Notably, redo procedures were
allowed only after 6 months, and the study follow-up concluded at
12 months. Consequently, the FreezeAF study gave only a snapshot
of the redo procedures that occurred within a duration of 6 months.
Our discrepancy (with the FreezeAF study) potentially demonstrates
that the cryoballoon reductions in reinterventions may be more

 observable on a larger scale (across healthcare systems or larger
clinical studies); it may reflect the low usage of advanced generation
ablation catheters in the FreezeAF study; and/or it may reflect
the small window (time duration) of redo ablations observed in the
FreezeAF study.
The significant reductions in reinterventions such as repeat abla-
tions and DCCVs indicate that the primary endpoint (i.e. time-to-first
recurrence of atrial tachycardia or AF, re-initiation of antiarrhythmic
drug therapy, or repeat ablation) does not fully reflect the benefit of
catheter ablation in patients with AF and the technique used to
achieve PVI.4 Another important result (namely, the reduction in
healthcare burden) is not reflected by the time-to-first event but
by the total number of reinterventions and rehospitalizations.9–11
In our analysis, cryoballoon ablation reduced all reintervention and
rehospitalization endpoints to a significantly greater amount than
RFC ablation, indicating a larger effect of cryoablation on healthcare
burden reduction than compared with RFC ablation.
The extent of reduction in reinterventions and rehospitalizations is
not only statistically significant but also clinically relevant.6,7 Our pre-
sented data are the main events that define the patients’ perception
regarding the procedural success of an AF ablation procedure. Poten-
tially, these data are as important as the primary endpoint outcomes
of a traditional clinical trial (time-to-recurrence/failure). The lower
number of reinterventions and rehospitalizations also has a health
economic effect, particularly in times of limited resources in most
healthcare systems.6,7 A relative reduction in repeat ablations, cardi-
oversions, and rehospitalizations ranging from 21 to 50% as shown in
this study is particularly meaningful if the overall procedural costs are
taken into account. Therefore, this result should be considered when
physicians need to decide which ablation modality (cryoballoon or
RFC) should be selected for PVI in patients with AF.
Lastly, in this study, there was an improvement in mental and phys-
ical quality-of-life that was apparent at 6 months following the index
ablation and maintained throughout the 30 months of follow-up. This
improvement was observed across both ablation modalities, and
there was no statistical difference between ablation groups. The
marked improvement at 6 months is consistent with the alleviation
of atrial arrhythmia symptoms.4 However, the SF-12 and EQ-5D-3L
surveys can be imprecise tools when evaluating patient performance
by ablation modalities because of the typically shorter follow-up per-
iods when comparing between groups (,5–10 years).12 Additionally
(specific for the EQ-5D-3L), the three-level scoring system allows for
wide usage because of the ease of scoring, but the survey suffers
from the lack of specificity that is found in more detailed question-
naires that do not have a ceiling effect.13,14 Importantly, longer term
follow-up is needed or disease-specific questionnaires must be used
when comparing between ablation modalities.
Limitations
The data presented in this study were collected during the FIRE
AND ICE trial which was a non-inferiority study with a traditional
90-day blanking period - an appropriate and common clinical trial
practice during the time of the subjects’ enrolment into the
study.1,2,4 It is reasonable that this could have influenced some
operators in some of the clinical judgement(s) (for instance, repeat
ablations and DCCVs during the 90-day blanking period were per-
formed without penalty in the data analyses of the primary end-
points), but these 90-day events were included in this current
study examination of reinterventions and rehospitalizations for
evaluation completeness. Also, the data examined in this study
were secondary endpoints, and some analyses were not predefined
but have been included due to the clinical implications to the
patients.
Conclusions
When comparing cryoballoon and RFC catheter ablation in symp-
tomatic patients with paroxysmal AF, this study demonstrated stat-
istically significant and clinically relevant advantages for patients
treated with cryoballoon ablation in terms of repeat ablations,
DCCVs, all-cause rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular rehospitali-
zations. Both patient groups improved in quality-of-life scores after
AF ablation. The endpoint events captured in this current analysis
are important to the patient’s perception of a successful AF ablation
procedure and to the burden of disease on the healthcare systems.
