Objective Office environments have been causally 
linked to workplace-related illnesses and stress, yet little 
is known about how office workstation type is linked to 
objective metrics of physical activity and stress. We aimed 
to explore these associations among office workers in US 
federal office buildings.
Methods We conducted a wearable, sensor-based, 
observational study of 231 workers in four office 
buildings. Outcome variables included workers’ 
physiological stress response, physical activity and 
perceived stress. relationships between office 
workstation type and these variables were assessed 
using structural equation modelling.
results Workers in open bench seating were 
more active at the office than those in private 
offices and cubicles (open bench seating vs private 
office=225.52 mg (31.83% higher on average) 
(95% ci 136.57 to 314.46); open bench seating vs 
cubicle=185.13 mg (20.16% higher on average) 
(95% ci 66.53 to 303.72)). Furthermore, workers in 
open bench seating experienced lower perceived stress 
at the office than those in cubicles (−0.27 (9.10% 
lower on average) (95% ci −0.54 to −0.02)). Finally, 
higher physical activity at the office was related to lower 
physiological stress (higher heart rate variability in the 
time domain) outside the office (−26.12 ms/mg (14.18% 
higher on average) (95% ci −40.48 to −4.16)).
Conclusions Office workstation type was related to 
enhanced physical activity and reduced physiological 
and perceived stress. this research highlights how office 
design, driven by office workstation type, could be a 
health-promoting factor.
Nearly 50 
million workers in the USA spend over 
one-fifth of their time in office settings.1 2 Techno-
logical advancements over the past several decades 
have led to an increasing share of the workforce 
being concentrated in office-based occupations. 
Office workers have an increased risk of physical 
inactivity at work compared with other profes-
sions and do not tend to engage in compensating 
behaviour outside of work.3 4 Sedentary patterns and 
inactivity are related to negative health outcomes, 
including fatigue, poor mood,5 as well as cardiovas-
cular diseases and other chronic diseases,6 7 which 
are in turn associated with increased rates of work 
exit.8 Importantly, lower physical activity levels at 
work have been linked to higher levels of perceived 
stress,9 a major public health risk associated with 
cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and 
poor diet.10 11 
Such health outcomes have enormous economic 
consequences, as modern office environments in 
the USA have been linked to workplace-related 
illnesses costing up to $225 
billion, or more than 
10% of office workers’ contribution to the US 
Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Office workers are at risk for low levels of 
physical activity and associated poor health 
outcomes, and workplace-related illnesses cost 
the US economy $225 billion a year, yet little is 
known about how office design elements may 
impact objectively measured health outcomes.
What are the new findings?
 
► This study applies recent advances in wearable 
sensors to the workplace setting.
 
► It is the first to investigate the effects of office 
workstation type on objective measures of both 
stress and physical activity.
 
► Across four different federal office buildings 
in the USA, workers in open bench seating 
exhibited higher levels of physical activity 
compared with those in cubicles and private 
offices.
 
► Higher physical activity at the office was in turn 
related to lower physiological stress outside the 
office as measured by heart rate variability.
How might this impact on policy or clinical 
practice in the foreseeable future?
 
► Objective measurements using wearable, 
sensor-based methods can inform policies 
and practices that affect the health and well-
being of hundreds of millions of office workers 
worldwide.
 
► The US General Services Administration will 
use these findings to inform design practices 
used to provide over 370 million square feet of 
office space and house over 1 million federal 
employees.
 
► The findings demonstrate the need for 
additional interventional research to improve 
our understanding of how elements of office 
design contribute to physical activity levels at 
work.

gross domestic product,12 and work-related stress and mental 
health problems in the European Union cost up to €269 
billion 
annually.13 Thus, although occupational safety and health 
programmes have eliminated many health risks, changes to poli-
cies and best practices in workplace design and operation aimed 
at health promotion could lead to further positive effects on 
health measures.
The vast majority of studies investigating how characteristics 
of the built office environment affect workers are survey-based, 
and suggest that there are worker performance, worker satis-
faction and economic trade-offs between types of office work-
stations.14–16 Few studies have included objective, continuous 
measures of stress in workplace settings,17–19 and no known 
study has investigated how characteristics of the built office 
environment relate to objective measures of stress and physical 
activity.
The purpose of our study, part of the US General Services 
Administration’s Wellbuilt for Wellbeing research project, was to 
explore the relationship between workplace design, health and 
well-being across four federal office buildings. To test whether 
behaviours and physiological and psychological responses to the 
working environment may differ based on spatial design charac-
teristics, we measured participants’ physiological stress response 
in real time using heart rate variability (HRV), perceived levels 
of stress through survey tools and objectively measured physical 
activity levels.
MeTHOds
Participants and setting
Self-described healthy adult workers involved in a variety of 
office-based roles for the US government were recruited across 
four federal office buildings in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern 
regions of the USA. Buildings were selected for their representa-
tion of common office workstation types across the US General 
Services Administration’s portfolio of over 370 
million square 
feet of office space that houses over 1 
million employees. Staff in 
sections of each office building from organisations with leader-
ship approval were offered the opportunity to participate.
After giving written informed consent, participants completed 
an intake survey consisting of demographic questions. Partici-
pants then wore a chest-worn heart and physical activity monitor 
for three consecutive workdays and two nights while answering 
hourly surveys on a smartphone during work hours related to 
a range of items including their current mood. Finally, partic-
ipants completed an exit survey including a global measure of 
stress. Pregnant women and those wearing pacemakers or insulin 
pumps were excluded. Participants taking medication known 
to affect HRV were noted but not excluded. Participants were 
enrolled serially across the four sites, between 5 May 2015 
and 25 August 2016. Between five and ten volunteers typically 
participated during each week of observation at each site.
Office workstation type and work type
Office workstation type varied across the four sites of the study 
and belonged to three categories: (1) private office (completely 
walled enclosure); (2) cubicle (high-walled partitions that one 
cannot see over while seated; and (3) open bench seating (no 
partitions or partitions that are readily seen over while seated) 
(figure 1).
Because we recruited participants from a variety of work 
divisions, work type varied and was coded (yes/no) for having 
‘computer-dominant’, ‘managerial’ and ‘technical’ qualities. For 
more information, see the online supplementary material.
Measures of perceived stress
During the intake survey, participants used online survey soft-
ware (Qualtrics, Provo, Utah) to provide demographic informa-
tion on age, gender, height and weight (used to calculate body 
mass index (BMI)), and the highest education level obtained.
While participants were working at the office, ecological 
momentary assessments (EMA) of current mood were taken over 
the 3 
days of observation. Randomly each hour, but never closer 
than 30 
min apart, participants were prompted on smartphones 
with Android operating systems using the movisensXS applica-
tion (movisens, Karlsruhe, Germany) and rated their momentary 
affect based on the circumplex model. Relevant for the purpose 
of this study, participants reported how ‘tense’ they currently felt 
on a 1–7 scale (1=‘not at all’ to 7=‘very much’).
Finally, during the exit survey, a one-time measure of long-
term perceived stress over the past month was taken using the 
validated Short Form Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4).20
Cardiac activity
Cardiac activity was recorded using a small, chest-worn sensor, 
EcgMove 3 (movisens). Details of the characteristics of this 
device have been published elsewhere.21 To quantify the physi-
ological stress response, we calculated the mean of the standard 
deviation of normalized interbeat intervals (SDNN).22 SDNN is 
a global index of HRV and reflects longer term circulation differ-
ences. Lower SDNN values indicate an increase in the sympa-
thetic stress response, and higher SDNN values have consistently 
been found to indicate better health.23 SDNN index, the mean 
of each 5 
min period of SDNN, was calculated according to 
the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the 
North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology.22 In 
order to better capture stressful moments, we then calculated 
the 10th percentile of the SDNN index variable.24 The 10th 
percentile value represents relatively low HRV values during 
Figure 1 examples of office workstation types from the study. From left to right, open bench seating, cubicle and private office.

the observation periods and serves as an indicator of relatively 
high sympathetic activation.24 For more information, see the 
online supplementary material.
Physical activity
Participants’ average physical activity levels were assessed in mG 
from the EcgMove3’s triaxial accelerometer sensor using algo-
rithms25 26 validated for day-to-day monitoring.27 The intensity 
level of physical activity has been shown to be a reliable predictor 
of physical health.28 This method captures the overall intensity 
of movement throughout the entire workday. It provides a finer 
granularity of movement data for office workers, who tend to sit 
for the vast majority of their time at the office, than traditional 
parameters such as step counts and sit-stand transitions. In other 
words, the method used in this study captures the intensity of 
movement throughout the entire workday during all activities 
(eg, sitting, standing, walking). For more information, see the 
online supplementary material.
statistical methods
Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to estimate the 
direct and indirect effects of aspects of the office environment 
on outcome measures (figure 2). SEM is a multivariate statis-
tical analysis technique that is used to estimate the relationships 
among multiple variables simultaneously in a single analysis.29 It 
is a suitable data analysis method in this study because it allows 
for the exploration of complex relationships between types of 
office workstations, types of work, individual characteristics, 
and physical activity and stress outcomes within one compre-
hensive model. Significant, unstandardised path coefficients (B) 
represent the total effect of one variable’s influence on another, 
taking into consideration all of the other variables’ contributions 
to the model. We reverse-coded 10th percentile SDNN values 
for ease of interpretability, as they are inversely proportional 
to physiological stress. To facilitate further understanding of 
the SEM results, the total effects for work type and office type 
on workers’ stress outcomes and physical activity were also anal-
ysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). For more information, 
see the online supplementary material.
resulTs
Participants
A total of 248 office workers expressed interest in participating 
in the study, representing approximately 12% of the workers 
located in areas of the office buildings where recruitment took 
place. Due to scheduling problems, sickness and exclusionary 
criteria, 17 office workers did not participate, resulting in a total 
enrolment of 231 participants. Due to unexpected changes in 
work schedules, 8 of the 231 participants were only observed 
for two workdays, rather than the full 3 
days. Demographic 
characteristics and descriptive data for measures of interest are 
provided in tables 1 and 2.
T
ype of work characteristics are not mutually exclusive, and 
thus sums across rows may not equal office workstation type 
frequencies. The total for type of work and office workstation 
type, along with missing values, can be found in table 1.
effects for office workstation type and work type
Stress and physical activity
All results described below are based on the SEM, unless other-
wise specified. Workers in open bench seating exhibited signifi-
cantly higher physical activity compared with workers in private 
offices (B=225.51 
mG; 95% 
CI 136.57 to 314.46). Workers in 
open bench seating also exhibited significantly higher physical 
activity compared with workers in cubicles (B=185.13 
mG; 
95% 
CI 66.53 to 303.72). To further illustrate the magnitude of 
these differences, we compared the mean differences between 
office workstation types. Workers in open bench seating exhib-
ited 31.83% higher physical activity compared with workers in 
private offices, and 20.16% higher physical activity compared 
with workers in cubicles.
Workers in open bench seating experienced significantly 
lower perceived stress at the office compared with those 
in cubicles as measured by the average ‘tense’ EMA ratings 
(B=−0.27 units; 95% CI −0.54 to −0.02). Importantly, the 
significant differences found between the types of office work-
stations reflect differences above and beyond any differences 
found due to types of work being performed. Only one work 
type difference was found in the model, where workers with 
computer-dominant jobs exhibited significantly lower physical 
activity compared with those with jobs that were not rated as

computer-dominant (B=−140.94 mG; 95% CI −239.49 to 
−42.39).
We then further tested the relationships identified between 
office workstation type and types of work on outcome variables 
at the office in one-way ANOVA models. We found significant 
differences between office workstation types in ‘tense’ EMA 
ratings at the office (F(2,194)=3.377, p=0.036, η2=0.03), 
between office workstation types in physical activity at the office 
(F(2,188)=9.476, p<0.001, η2=0.09), and between workers 
with and without computer-dominant jobs in physical activity 
at the office (F(1, 200)=6.179, p=0.0137, η2=0.03), thus 
revealing effects that converge with the findings obtained from 
the SEM.
Consistent with the idea that there may be elements of the 
workplace that we take home in the form of stress, higher 
physical activity at the office was significantly related to lower 
levels of physiological stress outside the office as measured 
by the 10th percentile SDNN (B=−26.12 ms/mG; 95% CI 
−40.48 to −4.16). To further illustrate this relationship, 
a median split of physical activity at the office showed that 
compared with workers with lower physical activity, those 
with higher physical activity had 14.18% lower physiolog-
ical stress outside the office. However, physical activity at 
the office was not significantly related to physiological stress 
while at the office. Furthermore, physiological stress at the 
office was significantly related to physiological stress outside 
the office as measured by the 10th percentile SDNN (B=0.74; 
95% CI 0.64 to 0.85).
In line with what is understood in the literature about the 
relationship between age, body composition and HRV
,30 31 we 
found that physiological stress at the office was significantly 
higher among older participants (B=0.36; 95% 
CI 0.24 to 0.48) 
and was significantly higher among participants with higher 
BMI (B=0.61; 95% 
CI 0.46 to 0.76). We also observed that, 
compared with male workers, female workers exhibited signifi-
cantly lower physical activity at the office (B=−149.32 
mG; 
95% 
CI −215.26 to −83.38) and significantly higher physiolog-
ical stress outside the office (B=1.95 
ms; 95% 
CI, 0.01 to 3.92). 
Lastly, higher perceived stress at the office was significantly 
related to higher long-term perceived stress as measured by the 
PSS-4 (B=0.44; 95% 
CI 0.27 to 0.60).

Key results
We found a statistically significant relationship between partic-
ipants’ office workstation type and their physical activity while 
at the office using a statistical model controlling for factors 
including type of work, demographics, and perceived and phys-
iological stress levels. Workers in both private offices and tradi-
tional, high-partition cubicles exhibited lower levels of physical 
activity than workers in open bench seating arrangements at a 
degree shown to be clinically meaningful in other populations.32 
Furthermore, we found that higher physical activity levels 
at the office were related to lower physiological stress levels 
outside the office. The magnitude of this association has also 
been shown to be clinically meaningful in prior research.33 This 
finding is consistent with research showing that the effects of 
certain office characteristics may carry over to non-office hours 
and affect diurnal patterns of physiological stress.17 Consistent 
with prior research, we found higher stress levels at the office 
among older participants and those with higher BMI. Inter-
estingly, our analyses also revealed that women exhibited both 
lower levels of physical activity at the office and higher levels of 
stress outside the office compared with men. This observation 
warrants further investigation of workplace and non-workplace 
factors and mechanisms contributing to these gender differences.
Taken together, this study establishes a new paradigm for 
objectively investigating the behavioural, well-being and health 
consequences of built environments, and it provides, for the 
first time, empirical evidence for associations between office 
workstation type, physical activity, and objective and subjective 
stress responses both at and outside of the office. These find-
ings have important implications, as economic forces and the 
changing nature of work patterns are driving more and more 
office spaces towards open designs.34 This is the first study to 
show that open bench seating may be an unrecognised positive 
factor in promoting physical activity levels at work. Given the 
importance of physical activity to health, the fact that office 
workstation type may influence how much people move at work 
should not be overlooked in the health field.
limitations and interpretation
Because this is an observational study, we cannot confirm a causal 
relationship between office workstation type and physical activity, 
nor confirm causal relationships for any other significant paths in 
our model. Importantly, we verified that participants in the study 
did not self-select but instead were assigned to consistent office 
workstation types based on location and organisation. While we 
controlled for relevant variables such as certain demographics, 
perceived stress and work type in the statistical models, there may 
be other contributing factors to these findings. For instance, because 
of the sample size, we were limited in the number of variables that 
we could include in the SEM. We prioritised modelling variables 
such as BMI, age, gender and work type over other factors such as 
ethnicity and education level.
Office workstation size, materiality, appearance, ambient envi-
ronmental characteristics, common workspace availability and 
work culture differences may vary systematically among partici-
pants. Such factors should be considered in future research. For 
instance, the total area allocated to office workstations tends to 
differ by design between the three office workstation types. In 
our sample, 97.9% of open bench seating workstations were 
under 36 square feet in area, 96.9% of cubicles were between 
36 and 64 square feet in area, and 95.2% of private offices were 
at least 100 square feet in area. Since workstation type and size 
tend to be related, the effect of workstation type on physical 
activity and stress apart from any possible effect of workstation 
size cannot be disentangled in this study. Moreover, the distribu-
tion of office workstation type was closely tied to study site. To 
account for this, we recruited participants from a variety of work 
types within each site (table 2) and statistically accounted for 
these characteristics. However, ultimately, the natural inability 
to fully insulate workstation effects from influences of clustering 
of workstations by building or departments remains a limitation.
We also explored the relationships of several other charac-
teristics of the built environment on physical activity and stress 
responses. For instance, we were interested in investigating the 
effect of window views to nature and the office workstation 
distance to windows on other variables, but the limited amount 
of available data for these two variables prevented inclusion in 
our model. There are many more workplace design features 
that may help explain differences in levels of observed phys-
ical activity, including circulation patterns, the availability of 
informal meetings spaces and the accessibility of stairwells.
In this study we have only used SDNN measures to repre-
sent HRV
. While previous studies suggest a high correlation 
between SDNN and other HRV measures, other metrics provide 
a different window into the stress response. When the root 
mean square of successive differences, a stronger indicator of 
parasympathetic activity, is used in the SEM analysis, the link 
between physical activity at the office and stress response outside 
the office is not present (see online supplementary table A and 
supplementary figure A). This may be due to the fact that SDNN 
represents both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity,35 but 
further analyses, which are beyond the scope of this paper, are 
needed to clarify this.
Little empirical evidence exists on the mechanism by which 
office workstation type can affect physical activity, yet this 
finding suggests an important potential health benefit of open 
bench seating that must be weighed against other office space 
design trade-offs.
Workers tend to rate private offices as more desirable than 
other office workstation types,16 but there may be other conse-
quences when compared with open bench seating arrangements. 
For instance, valuable, impromptu conversations may be an 
unintended benefit to this design strategy, as well as improved 
communication and an increased awareness of others.14 It is 
possible that the open nature of a space leads to increased phys-
ical activity by encouraging interaction and mobility, including 
movement to spaces designed for unplanned meetings and phone 
calls, when available. Individuals in open bench seating may also 
be more aware of others and more dependent on shared services 
(eg, meeting rooms, printing and filing areas, social spaces) than 
those in private offices.
Similarly, there may be unintended trade-offs between cubicles 
and open bench seating. Past research has shown that workers in 
cubicles tend to report higher levels of visual privacy compared 
with those in open bench seating, yet this pattern does not hold 
for perceived auditory privacy. In fact, there is evidence that 
workers in cubicles report less auditory privacy compared with 
workers in open bench seating.16 It is possible that because there 
is less of a visual connection between workers in cubicles, people 
in cubicles may be less aware of the presence of other workers

nearby and thus less sensitive to the impact on others when 
they engage in conversations and phone calls.15 16 It is possible 
that this greater awareness of others enhances physical activity 
and encourages better sound etiquette.
While the relationship between physical activity patterns and 
built environment design elements is rarely simple and often 
contains cultural elements,36 this study suggests that in some 
cases, design modifications may be employed to overcome 
the negative health impact features of different types of office 
workstations. To explore potential mechanisms for behavioural 
changes associated with office design characteristics, we are 
currently investigating the relationship between sound levels, 
types of work tasks and office workstation type. Moreover, the 
process employed to transition workers to new office worksta-
tion types may influence workers’ perceptions. There is evidence 
that the process of engagement with both management and 
individual workers, to effectively understand needs and commu-
nicate design intent before a move, may increase subsequent 
satisfaction levels and achievement of design goals.37 38 Commu-
nicating the health implications of different office workstation 
types to future occupants may also help transitions.
The results of this study are an important step towards estab-
lishing best practices and guidelines for office design and opera-
tions. There are ongoing and accelerating trends towards reducing 
dedicated individual workspace in offices in order to save rental 
and other overhead costs, and to reduce environmental impacts of 
underutilised space. The US federal government in particular views 
reduction and consolidation of office space as a critical cost-saving 
measure as indicated by the recent passage of the Federal Property 
Management Reform Act of 2016.39
While many US government programmes are not informed 
by research,40 the US General Services Administration seeks to 
use the best research available to shift the focus of occupational 
health programmes from risk avoidance to health promotion. 
Indeed, the current study’s methodology can be applied to 
other types of office workspaces and to other building types, 
such as healthcare and education settings. Doing so will help 
to better understand how the behaviour and health of millions 
of people are affected by the built environment in which they 
spend so much of their lives. The findings of this study suggest 
that features of office design may play a role in office workers’ 
levels of physical activity. While further interventional research 
is required to better understand the related mechanisms, this 
study can inform designers’ thinking about how office design 
elements might encourage physical activity and potentially even 
reduce levels of stress, thus facilitating a healthier lifestyle.
