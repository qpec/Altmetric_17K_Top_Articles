Adult umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) has emerged as an important option for patients lacking matched related (MRD) and
matched unrelated donors (MUD). We compared chronic GVHD (cGVHD) incidence, immunosuppression burden and late infections and
hospitalizations in consecutive patients undergoing CBT (n = 51) versus peripheral blood MUD transplant (n = 57) at our center between
June 2009 and April 2014. At 3 years post transplantation, the cumulative incidence (CI) of moderate to severe cGVHD was 44%
following MUD versus 8% following CBT (P = 0.0006) and CI of any cGVHD was 68% following MUD versus 32% following CBT
(P =0.0017). Median time to being off immunosuppression among CB patients was 268 days versus not reached among MUD patients
(Po0.0001). Late infections and late hospitalized days were reduced in CB patients (P = 0.1 and o0.001, respectively). Three-year CI of
transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse as well as 3-year overall survival (OS) were similar following CB and MUD transplantation.
We demonstrate a significantly lower incidence of cGVHD, immunosuppression burden and late complication rate following UCB versus
peripheral blood MUD transplant without decreased OS, increased relapse or early TRM. Combined with the rapid availability of UCB,
these findings have led our center to move primarily to UCB over peripheral blood MUD when a MRD is not available.

INTRODUCTION
Umbilical cord blood (CB) has emerged as an important donor
source for patients lacking matched related (MRD) and matched
unrelated donors (MUDs). Numerous recent studies comparing
transplantation outcomes using each donor source have demon-
strated similar overall survival (OS) in both adult and pediatric
populations.1–6 However, owing to ongoing concerns about graft
failure, delayed engraftment, delayed immune reconstitution and
costs following CB transplantation (CBT), most adult centers
currently prioritize MUD over CB.
Among long-term relapse-free survivors of transplantation,
chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and its sequelae account for the majority
of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. We compared out-
comes of consecutive adult peripheral blood MUD and CBT at our
center with a focus on cGVHD as well as late infections and
hospitalizations. Whereas OS, relapse, and both early and late
transplant-related mortality (TRM) were comparable between each
group, the incidence of cGVHD, time to immunosuppression
withdrawal and incidence of late post-transplantation infections
and hospitalizations were lower following CBT versus peripheral
blood MUD transplantation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
We compared outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing first CB
(n = 51) versus first peripheral blood MUD transplantation (n = 57) at our
center between June 2009 and April 2014. No bone marrow transplants
were performed for hematologic malignancies during this period. All
patients signed IRB-approved informed consent authorizing data collection
for this study. Patients were treated on multiple protocols including
research and standard of care regimens. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) was graded
according to established criteria.7 cGVHD and late aGVHD was graded
according to the 2005 National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus
criteria.8 Patient and transplant details are summarized in Table 1. Among
CB patients, median age at transplant was 58 (range 22–73) versus 54
(range 18–72) among MUDs. Eighteen CB patients underwent myeloa-
blative conditioning and 33 patients underwent non-myeloablative
conditioning for ALL (n = 7), AML (n = 27), myelodysplastic syndrome
(n = 5), CLL (n = 3), non Hodgkins lymphoma (n = 7) and CML (n = 2). GVHD
prophylaxis was cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. All CB patients
received double cord transplants. Median cryopreserved total nucleated
cell dose per unit was 2.3 × 107/kg (1.5–5.1). Matching was 4/6, 4/6 n = 9,
4/6, 5/6 n = 11, 5/6,5/6 n = 20, 6/6,5/6 n = 5, 6/6,6/6 n = 4, 6/6/, 4/6 n = 2.
Fifty-four MUD patients were 10/10 matched and three patients were 8/8
matched (DQ mismatched). Eighteen patients underwent myeloablative
conditioning (tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis) and 39 patients
underwent non-myeloablative conditioning (tacrolimus/mycophenolate
mofetil GVHD prophylaxis) for ALL (n = 8), AML (n = 13), non Hodgkins
lymphoma (n = 15), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 10), CLL (n = 5) and
other (n = 6). For all patients, standard immunosuppression taper in the
absence of GVHD or relapse was scheduled to be completed approxi-
mately 6 months following transplant. Through November 2013, our donor
selection algorithm prioritized MUDs over CB, and all CB transplants were
performed on patients lacking available MUDs. On the basis of preliminary
analyses of the data presented in this manuscript, our donor selection
algorithm shifted to prioritizing CB over MUD transplant in November
2013. Between November 2013 and April 2014, 13 CB and 2 MUD
transplants were performed. As a result, median follow-up is shorter in the

 CB population. However, all results are similar to analyses performed on
patients transplanted between June 2009 and November 2013.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics and follow-up times are summarized using standard
measures. Cumulative incidence (CI) estimates of aGVHD and cGVHD, time
to immunosuppression withdrawal, relapse and TRM were utilized, with
relapse, TRM, immunosuppression taper for persistent disease and graft
failure (defined as sustained trilineage cytopenias without other explana-
tion or loss of detectable donor chimerism) included as competing risk
events as appropriate.9 For aGVHD, cGVHD and time to immunosuppres-
sion withdrawal, relapse, TRM and graft failure were considered competing
risks. For relapse, TRM was considered a competing risk, and for TRM,
relapse was considered a competing risk. CI curves were compared using
Gray’s test. Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to evaluate OS. Censoring
for all time-to-event outcomes occurred at the date of last contact. Kaplan–
Meier curves were compared using log-rank test.
For assessments of infectious episodes and hospital days/days of follow-
up, a Wald test statistics was constructed to compare the two groups.
Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the
relative risks.
Landmark analysis beginning day 90 post transplantation was used to
assess CI of cGVHD as well as late infections and hospitalizations. Landmark
analysis beginning day 180 post transplantation was used to assess CI of
time to immunosuppression withdrawal. Statistical analysis was performed
using SAS statistical software.
RESULTS
Acute GVHD
Twenty CB patients experienced grade 2–4 aGVHD prior to day
100 (two grade 3–4) and six (all of whom experienced aGVHD prior
to day 100) experienced recrudescent aGVHD after day 100

 (including one patient who escalated from grade 3 to grade 4).
Twenty-two MUDs experienced grade 2–4 aGVHD prior to day 100
(7 grade 3–4) and 12 (4 of whom did not experience aGVHD prior
to day 100) experienced late aGVHD (including one patient who
escalated from grade 2 to grade 3). CI of grade 2–4 aGVHD was
39% for CB patients and 47% for MUD patients (P = 0.47) (Figure 1).
Chronic GVHD
At 3 years post transplant, CI of moderate-to-severe cGVHD was
44% following MUD versus 8% following CBT (P = 0.0006) and CI of
any cGVHD was 68% following MUD versus 32% following CBT
(P = 0.0017) (Figure 2). The CI of immunosuppression withdrawal
was significantly more rapid following CB than MUD transplant
(Po0.0001); median time to being off immunosuppression
among CB patients was 268 days versus not reached among
MUD patients (Figure 3). Median follow-up among all CB patients
was 411 days (range 18–1853) and median time to onset of
cGVHD was 210 days (range 108–490). Onset was de novo n = 3,
quiescent n = 8 and progressive n = 3. Median follow-up among all
MUD patients was days 488 days (range 24–1955) and median
time to onset of cGVHD was 225 days (range 83–803). Onset was
de novo n = 7, quiescent n = 12 and progressive n = 11.
Among CB patients, one patient remained on immunosuppres-
sion 384 days post transplant. One patient who died of cGVHD-
related complications remained on immunosuppression at the
time of death. Four patients restarted immunosuppression owing
to recrudescent symptoms, but all four patients subsequently
tapered again and remain off immunosuppression. Among MUD
patients, the five patients who died of cGVHD-related complica-
tions and the two patients who died of relapse after developing
cGVHD remained on immunosuppression at the time of death.
Twenty-two of 31 surviving patients who did not experience
competing risks prior to onset of cGVHD remain on immunosup-
pression without ever stopping. Of nine patients who stopped
immunosuppression, eight subsequently restarted for recrudes-
cent GVHD symptoms and five remain on immunosuppressive
therapy.
Late infections and hospitalizations
We performed a descriptive analysis comparing late infection and
hospitalization rates among CB and MUD patients who underwent
successful transplants without early competing risks and without
late relapse. Analysis began 90 days post transplantation; patients
who died or relapsed (n = 8 CB, 10 MUD), experienced graft failure
(n = 3 CB, 5 MUD) or underwent rapid immunosuppression for
persistent disease (n = 1 CB, 1 MUD) prior to day 90, as well as any
patients experiencing the competing risk of relapse (n = 8 CB, 7
MUD) after day 90 post transplantation were excluded. Infectious
episodes were defined as bacterial, fungal or viral infections in
which patients were symptomatic or required treatment (CMV
reactivation) and pathogens were identified by culture, PCR or
histological exam. Among 31 CB patients (median follow-up
551 days (range 40–1763)) and 34 MUD patients (median follow-

 up 920 days (range 37–1865)), comprehensive follow-up data
were not available for 1 MUD patient. Six cord patients died
(cGVHD = 1, aGVHD n = 1, infection n = 2, pulmonary failure n = 2)
and nine MUD patients died (cGVHD n = 5, aGVHD n = 1, suicide
n = 1, infection n = 1, pulmonary failure n = 1) during follow-up.
Of the CB patients, 12 did not experience infectious episodes
after 3 months post transplantation and 19 experienced infections
(median 2 infectious episodes, range 1–11). Of the 33 assessable
MUD patients, 4 did not experience infectious episodes after
3 months post transplantation and 29 experienced infections
(median 3 infectious episodes, range 1–9). The relative risk of late
infection episode on a per infection level (total number of
infections, including multiple infections in a single individual) for
CB patients was comparable with MUD patients (P = 0.37, relative
risk 0.95 (95% CI 0.67–0.1.3)). Excluding patients who died during
the follow-up period, the relative risk of late infection episode on a
per infection level for CB patients trended toward lower compared
with MUD patients (P = 0.10), relative risk 0.77 (95% CI 0.51–1.16).
(Table 2)
Among CB patients, 16 were not rehospitalized after 3 months
post transplantation and 15 were readmitted (median 2 read-
missions, range 1–10). For 19 405 total follow-up days, patients
spent 535 days hospitalized (0.028 hospital days/follow-up days).
Among MUD patients, 9 were not rehospitalized after 3 months
post transplantation and 25 were readmitted (median 1 read-
missions, range 1–7). For 29 418 total follow-up days, patients
spent 825 days hospitalized (0.028 hospital days/follow-up days).
The relative risk of late hospitalized days following CBT was
comparable with that following MUD transplantation (P = 0.4,
relative risk 0.98 (95% CI 0.88–1.1). Excluding patients who died
during the follow-up period, the relative risk of late hospitalized
days following CBT was lower than following MUD transplantation
(Po0.001), relative risk 0.74 (95% CI 0.66–0.82). (Table 2)
Given the variable follow-up time among patients included in
the analyses of infections and hospitalizations above, we assessed
infections and hospitalizations for all surviving patients between
days 90 and 309 post transplantation (309 days being the shortest
follow-up). Results were unchanged with this analysis.
Relapse, TRM and OS
Among the 51 CBT patients, there were 21 deaths due to
relapse (n = 11) or TRM (n = 10). Among patients experiencing
TRM, causes of death included cGVHD (n = 1), aGVHD (n = 1)
conditioning-related toxicity (n = 1), infection (n = 3), late pulmon-
ary failure (n = 2) and graft failure with subsequent relapse (n = 2).
Twelve patients experienced relapse. Among the 57 MUD patients,
there were 25 deaths due to relapse (n = 10) or TRM (n = 15).
Among patients experiencing TRM, causes of death included
cGVHD (n = 5), aGVHD (n = 2), conditioning-related toxicity (n = 2),
infection (n = 1), late pulmonary failure (n = 1), graft failure
with
subsequent
relapse
(n = 2)
or
death
due
to
GVHD
following subsequent transplant (n = 1), and suicide (n = 1). Sixteen
patients experienced relapse. Three-year CI of TRM was 25%
for CB and 24% for MUD patients (P = 0.73) and 3-year CI of
relapse was 22% for CB and 24% for MUD patients (P = 0.86).
Three-year OS was 54% for CB and 52% for MUD patients
(P = 0.68). (Figure 1)
DISCUSSION
cGVHD is the most important cause of long-term morbidity and
mortality among non-relapsed survivors of HSCT. Our data confirm
previous reports suggesting a low incidence of cGVHD following
CBT as compared with peripheral blood URD transplant.1,2,10 In
addition, we demonstrate significantly more rapid removal of
immunosuppression and sustained immunosuppression disconti-
nuation following CBT as compared with peripheral blood MUD
transplantation as well as decreased infections and hospital
days after more than 90 days post transplantation. These data
have important implications for long-term survivors of transplan-
tation; if OS and other complications are comparable between
the two groups, being alive without cGVHD or on immunosup-
pression may lead to improved quality of life and reduced costs
of care.
The 3-year CI by landmark analysis of any as well as moderate/
severe cGVHD was significantly lower following CBT as compared
with MUD transplantation (32 versus 68%, P = 0.0017 and 8 versus
44%, P = 0.0006, respectively). Owing to censorship of patients
experiencing competing risks, CI of cGVHD following transplant
has some limitations, though it is the standard method for
calculating
incidence
of
cGVHD.
By
also
assessing
cGVHD
incidence in patients not experiencing competing risks of relapse,
TRM or graft failure prior to the onset of cGVHD, we are able to
predict the likelihood of being alive with cGVHD following an
otherwise successful transplant. When counseling patients regard-
ing risks of cGVHD, this information may be more valuable then
describing the landmark cumulative incidence analysis risk of
cGVHD. In our study, though the CI of cGVHD among MUDs was
68% percent, 94% of MUD patients who were alive without

 competing risk experienced cGVHD (63% moderate to severe) in
contrast to a 32% CI of cGVHD among CB patients and only a 52%
chance of cGVHD among CB patients (11% moderate to severe)
who were alive without competing risk.
In addition, our data demonstrate time to immunosuppression
discontinuation,
as
well
as
sustained
immunosuppression
discontinuation, markedly favor CBT. Whereas all of the CB
patients were off immunosuppression by 500 days post trans-
plantation,
84%
of
surviving
MUD
patients
remained
on
immunosuppression 2 years post transplantation. Though the
median dose was low in these MUD patients (10 mg of prednisone
and low dose calcineurin inhibitors), side effects, costs and
inconvenience of the medications remain important issues
independent of symptoms related to cGVHD. Time to immuno-
suppression discontinuation data can also be deceptive, as many
studies do not indicate whether immunosuppression needs to be
restarted following tapering to off. Notably, four CBT patients
who tapered immunosuppression restarted for recrudescent
symptoms, but all four rapidly re-tapered and remain off
immunosuppression. In contrast, 8 of 10 MUD patients who
tapered off immunosuppression subsequently restarted, and all
remain on immunosuppression.
We also assessed late infections and hospitalizations following
transplantation and found fewer events in the CBT group. Others
have reported excellent long-term outcomes among CBT patients
not experiencing early TRM,11,12 and our data are consistent with
these
findings.
As
expected,
the
highest
burden
of
late
hospitalization and infection fell on patients with significant
cGVHD. Among long-term survivors, late hospitalization rates were
lower following CBT and infection rates trended toward fewer
(P = 0.1) following CBT.
Adult CBT is historically associated with several concerns in the
early post-transplant period including higher rates of graft failure,
delayed engraftment and higher risk for infection early post
transplantation. Optimization of conditioning regimens including
development of middle intensity regimens,13 use of double unit
transplants to decrease graft failure,14,15 ex vivo expansion and
other strategies to decrease time to engraftment,16,17 and
accumulation of an increasing inventory of CB units allowing for
selection of larger and better matched units have all contributed
to decreases in graft failure and lower early post-transplantation
infection risk. In our series, early TRM was comparable between
CBT and MUD donors.
aGVHD, the other significant source of early post-transplant
morbidity and mortality, remains an issue following CBT as well as
MUD transplantation. In our series, the incidence was comparable
following transplant with each donor source. This finding is
consistent with other reports.1,2 However, although the incidence
of aGVHD was comparable between donor sources, others have
suggested higher sensitivity of CB patients to aGVHD treatment.18
Our data are consistent with this observation and is reflected in
the successful rates of rapid sustained immunosuppression
withdrawal. Others have also noted late aGVHD to be common
following CBT.18 Although we observed more late aGVHD than
classic cGVHD in our cord patients, the issue was not significant, as
again reflected in the successful
rates of rapid sustained
immunosuppression withdrawal.
Our study is small, retrospective and involves heterogeneous
populations. Importantly, our study compared CBT with periph-
eral blood MUD transplantation; incidence of cGVHD following
bone marrow transplantation or T-cell-depleted transplantation
is known to be lower. Several different conditioning regimens
and GVHD prophylaxis strategies were used and multiple
diseases at different stages were included. However, all GVHD
prophylaxis regimens have been well described in conjunction
with their corresponding conditioning regimen and donor
source. The CBT and MUD populations were well matched
with respect to age, disease, disease status, comorbidity index
and
proportion
of
myeloablative
and
non-myeloablative
transplants.
Others have reported excellent long-term outcomes for CB
patients who survive the acute transplant period. Our data are
consistent with these observations, and, importantly, we did not
observe increased early TRM following CBT. The decreased
cGVHD and late complications we have observed following CBT
combined with the rapid availability of CB has led our center to
move primarily to CB when a MRD is not available, particularly
when large and well-matched CB units are available. Ongoing
analysis will examine whether moving directly to CBT for patients
with common haplotypes with MUDs available will result in
larger, better matched CB units for patients and whether this will
result in improved outcomes. Additional assessments of late and
total costs of care (including potential cost reductions resulting
from
more
rapid
transplantation
with
less
consolidation)
following CBT as well as formal quality of life assessments are
ongoing.
