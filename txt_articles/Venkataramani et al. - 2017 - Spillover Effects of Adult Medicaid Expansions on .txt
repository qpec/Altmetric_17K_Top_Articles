Spillover Effects of Adult Medicaid 
Expansions on Children’s Use 
of Preventive Services

BACKGROUND: Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid enrollment has increased 
by ∼17 million adults, including many low-income parents. One potentially important, 
but little studied, consequence of expanding health insurance for parents is its effect on 
children’s receipt of preventive services.
METHODS: By using state Medicaid eligibility thresholds linked to the 2001–2013 Medical 
Expenditure Panel Surveys, we assessed the relationship between changes in adult 
Medicaid eligibility and children’s likelihood of receiving annual well-child visits (WCVs). 
In instrumental variable analyses, we used these changes in Medicaid eligibility to estimate 
the relationship between parental enrollment in Medicaid and children’s receipt of WCVs.
RESULTS: Our analytic sample consisted of 50 622 parent-child dyads in families with 
incomes <200% of the federal poverty level, surveyed from 2001 to 2013. On average, a 
10-point increase in a state’s parental Medicaid eligibility (measured relative to the federal 
poverty level) was associated with a 0.27 percentage point higher probability that a child 
received an annual WCV (95% confidence interval: 0.058 to 0.48 percentage points, P = 
.012). Instrumental variable analyses revealed that parental enrollment in Medicaid was 
associated with a 29 percentage point higher probability that their child received an annual 
WCV (95% confidence interval: 11 to 47 percentage points, P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we demonstrate that Medicaid expansions targeted at low-income 
adults are associated with increased receipt of recommended pediatric preventive care 
for their children. This finding reveals an important spillover effect of parental insurance 
coverage that should be considered in future policy decisions surrounding adult Medicaid 
eligibility.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Cross-sectional 
studies have revealed inconsistent relationships 
between parental insurance coverage and children’s 
health care use. To our knowledge, no studies have 
investigated the link between parental insurance 
and pediatric care by using more robust quasi-
experimental methods.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: We found that parental 
Medicaid enrollment is associated with a 29 
percentage point higher probability that low-
income children received annual well-child visits, 
highlighting a link between parents’ Medicaid 
coverage and their children’s health care use.

 Since the passage of the Affordable 
Care Act (ACA), 31 states and the 
District of Columbia have expanded 
Medicaid to adults earning <138% 
of the federal poverty level (FPL).1 
Medicaid expansions have been 
shown to increase preventive care 
use, improve health outcomes, 
and reduce the financial burden of 
obtaining care.2 
–5 The authors of 
several studies have also identified 
potential spillover effects in which 
increases in adult Medicaid coverage 
indirectly affect health care use in 
other populations, for example, by 
increasing insurance enrollment 
among children and improving family 
financial standing.5 
– 
7
One important but understudied 
effect of expanding access to health 
insurance for parents is its impact 
on well-child visit (WCV) use 
among children. Recommended 
annually for children 3 years of age 
and older, and more frequently for 
infants and toddlers, 
8 WCVs serve 
as the primary platform for growth 
and developmental screening, 
vaccination, and provision of 
anticipatory guidance. Children who 
receive WCVs are more likely to 
complete immunization schedules 
and are less likely to have avoidable 
hospitalizations.9, 
 
10 WCV use in the 
United States has been persistently 
suboptimal, particularly among racial 
and ethnic minorities and in low-
income families.11
Although the authors of previous 
studies have shown that parental 
health care use is correlated with 
children’s receipt of care, 
12 
– 
15 
evidence regarding the relationship 
between parental insurance coverage 
and pediatric care use is mixed. The 
authors of several cross-sectional 
studies found a positive correlation 
between parents’ insurance status 
and children’s health care use in 
primarily low-income families, 
16 
– 
18  
whereas analyses in mixed income 
populations did not.14, 
 
15 A limitation 
of cross-sectional analyses is that 
insured and uninsured adults differ 
in unobserved ways that may be 
related to their child’s use of care, 
potentially biasing the estimated 
relationship between these 
variables.19
To address this bias, we used a 
quasi-experimental design that 
leveraged state-level variation in 
adult Medicaid eligibility over the 
period from 2001 to 2013 to assess 
the relationship between parents’ 
Medicaid coverage and children’s 
receipt of annual WCVs. Our findings 
reveal how changes in federal and 
state policies that affect Medicaid 
coverage for adults could indirectly 
affect low-income children’s use of 
recommended primary care services.
MethODs
Data sources
We analyzed data from the 2001–
2013 Medical Expenditure Panel 
Surveys (MEPS) linked to state 
Medicaid eligibility criteria from 
the Kaiser Family Foundation and 
county-level characteristics from 
the Area Health Resources File. The 
MEPS is a nationally representative 
survey of the noninstitutionalized 
US population and includes detailed 
information about family structure 
and demographic characteristics, 
health insurance status, and health 
care use.20
Our analytic sample consisted of 
children ages 2 through 17 linked 
to their biological, step, or adoptive 
parents living in the same household 
during the calendar year. We first 
selected children ages 2 through 17 
living in the household the entire 
year. We then linked each child to a 
parent or guardian (age 20–64) living 
in the household for the full year. 
Consistent with previous research, 
preference was given to the selection 
of the mother if more than 1 parent 
in the household was surveyed.15
Because Medicaid eligibility rules 
differ for pregnant women, we 
excluded children whose mothers 
met inclusion criteria but were 
pregnant at any point during the 
calendar year. Because pregnancy 
status was not uniformly reported in 
all years of the MEPS, we identified 
pregnant women as having either a 
child born in the same calendar year 
or by September of the next calendar 
year, or as having any pregnancy-
related inpatient visits over the same 
period. This measure was highly 
correlated with pregnancy status for 
the years in which this variable was 
included in the MEPS (Supplemental 
Table 5).
Consistent with the methods in 
previous studies, 
16 
– 
18 our primary 
analyses were focused on low-income 
families, defined as those with 
incomes <200% of the FPL.
Measures
Outcome: WCV Use
We assessed whether a child received 
at least 1 WCV in the calendar year. 
WCVs were defined as outpatient 
visits for a “well-child examination, 
”  
for a “general checkup, 
” or for 
“immunization or shots” for children 
<17.21 We controlled for changes in 
the recommended WCV schedule 
over time (such as introduction of 
annual visit requirements for 7- and 
9-year-olds in 2007) by including 
year fixed effects in regression 
analyses.8
State-Level Medicaid Eligibility for 
Parents
We obtained state Medicaid 
eligibility thresholds from 2000 
through 2012 from the Kaiser 
Family Foundation’s surveys of state 
Medicaid programs.22 
– 
32 Because 
states may change their Medicaid 
eligibility limits at different points in 
a year, we used income thresholds 
from the preceding year in all 
regression analyses. Thresholds 
were based on eligibility criteria for 
unemployed parents with dependent 
children, reflecting (if applicable) the 
higher income limits allowed under 
federal expansion waivers, and were

 expressed in percentage points of the 
FPL.33 We used linear interpolation 
to approximate thresholds in years in 
which data were not reported (2002, 
2007, and 2010).
Parental Enrollment in Medicaid
We constructed a binary indicator 
for whether an adult had Medicaid 
coverage at any point in the study 
year.
covariates
In our primary analyses, we 
controlled for parental, family, child, 
and county-level characteristics 
that are associated with children’s 
health care use.11, 
 
16 
– 
18, 
21 Parental 
characteristics included age, sex, 
race, Hispanic ethnicity, comfort 
speaking English, education, and 
smoking status. Family level variables 
were total income, size, and parental 
structure (mother and father both 
present in household versus not). We 
additionally controlled for the child’s 
age and sex, the density of physicians 
in the patient’s county (total active 
MD physicians divided by the county 
population), the county-level poverty 
rate, and an indicator for whether the 
family lived in an urban area (defined 
as a Metropolitan Statistical Area).
statistical analyses
We first examined the association 
between the changes in a state’s 
parental Medicaid eligibility 
thresholds and WCV receipt. 
Specifically, we estimated a 
multivariable logistic regression 
model in which our outcome was 
the probability that a child received 
at least 1 WCV during the year by 
using parental Medicaid eligibility 
thresholds (lagged by 1 year) as the 
main independent variable. In this 
intention-to-treat framework, we 
used within-state changes in the 
Medicaid eligibility threshold for 
parents as the exposure of interest. 
The models controlled for state and 
year fixed effects, in addition to the 
covariates described above. We ran 
models for our full sample of parent-
child dyads (the unit of analysis) 
and stratified by category of family 
income (<100% of the FPL and 100% 
of the FPL to <200% of the FPL). We 
used these regression analyses to 
estimate the change in probability 
of receiving a WCV because of state 
Medicaid expansions for adults, 
holding all other covariates at their 
sample means.
We then examined the relationship 
between a parent’s enrollment 
in Medicaid and WCV usage by 
using an instrumental variable (IV) 
analysis. This approach addresses 
bias from unmeasured factors that 
could impact a parent’s insurance 
status and their children’s health 
care use by using within-state 
changes in Medicaid eligibility 
for parents as an instrument for 
parental Medicaid enrollment. We 
estimated a binary probit model for 
the probability that a child received a 
WCV as a function of his/her parent’s 
Medicaid enrollment status, which 
we instrumented by using within-
state changes in Medicaid eligibility 
thresholds for parents. Our IV models 
controlled for state fixed effects, 
year fixed effects, and the covariates 
described above (see Supplemental 
Information for details). By using 
these models, we calculated a 
predicted change in the probability 
that a child would receive a WCV if 
their parent enrolled in Medicaid, 
holding all covariates at the sample 
means. The IV models were run on 
our full sample of families and by 
stratum of family income.
We performed 4 sensitivity analyses. 
First, because a child’s insurance 
status may change in response 
to changes in parental access to 
insurance34 (eg, “welcome mat” 
effects), and because children’s 
insurance status is known to be 
an independent determinant of 
health care use, 
11, 
 
16, 
 
18 we ran 
models additionally controlling for 
the child’s Medicaid or Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 
status to determine if our findings 
could be explained by changes in 
children’s health insurance status. 
Second, because states may also 
undergo concurrent expansions in 
children’s Medicaid eligibility over 
time, which could in turn affect 
child insurance coverage status, we 
repeated our analyses for a subgroup 
of 29 large states (with observable 
state identifiers in the MEPS) whose 
income thresholds for child Medicaid 
or CHIP programs were consistently 
≥200% of the FPL during the study 
period. In these states, low-income 
children in our cohort would have 
remained consistently eligible for 
Medicaid, further isolating the impact 
of parental Medicaid expansions on 
WCVs.
Third, we limited the study period 
to 2001 to 2009 to ensure that our 
results were not driven by the ACA’s 
introduction of regulations requiring 
insurer coverage of preventive 
health care services. Fourth, we 
reestimated our models for families 
with incomes ≥400% of the FPL. 
Because we expected parents in these 
families to be relatively unaffected by 
Medicaid expansions, this serves as 
a falsification test (eg, we would not 
expect to see an impact of increasing 
parental Medicaid eligibility on 
children’s WCV receipt for this higher 
income sample).
We used family survey weights 
provided in the MEPS and variance 
estimates that accounted for 
clustering of observations at the state 
level. This study was approved by 
the institutional review board of the 
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Results
Our analytic sample consisted of 
50 622 parent-child dyads across 
the 13 study years, representing 
266 557 804 weighted pairs through 
the study period (Table 1). Slightly 
less than half of the dyads (44.7%) 
had incomes <100% of the FPL. The 
mean age of children was 9.3 years,

 and the mean age of linked parents 
was 35.8 years. The majority of 
parents were white (72.5%), non-
Hispanic (67.4%), and had earned 
at least a high school diploma or 
general education diploma (67.0%). 
The majority of dyads consisted of 
children linked to mothers (95.4%).
At the beginning of the study period 
(2001), mean adult Medicaid 
eligibility (weighted for the 
population across states in our 
sample and lagged by 1 year) for 
unemployed parents was 73.5% of 
the FPL, and increased to 107.7% 
of the FPL by 2013 (Supplemental 
Table 6). The proportion of states 
with parental Medicaid eligibility 
limits ≥200% of the FPL increased 
from 7.8% to 29.4% over the study 
period (Supplemental Table 6). The 
percentage of children in our sample 
receiving an annual WCV increased 
from 32.7% in 2001 to 47.9% in 2013 
(Table 2).
In the intention-to-treat analysis, 
we found that a 10-point absolute 
increase in a state’s adult Medicaid 
eligibility threshold (relative to the 
FPL) was associated with a 0.27 
percentage-point increase in the 
probability that low income children 
received an annual WCV (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.058 to 0.48 
percentage points, P = .012; Table 3).  
In stratified analyses, changes in 
adult Medicaid eligibility thresholds 
were positively associated with 
WCV use for families with incomes 
100% of the FPL to <200% of the 
FPL (0.38 percentage points, 95% 
CI: 0.10 to 0.66 percentage points, 
P = .008) and was positively but not 
significantly related to WCVs in the 
lowest (<100% of the FPL) income 
group (0.13 percentage points, 95% 
CI: −0.11% to 0.36% points, P = .284) 
(Table 3).
In IV analyses, we found that parental 
Medicaid enrollment was associated 
with a 29 percentage-point (95% 
CI: 11 to 47 percentage points; P = 
.002) increase in the probability that 
their child would have a WCV (Table 
4). This relationship was strongest 
in families with incomes 100% to 
<200% of the FPL. For these families, 
there was a 45 percentage point 
higher probability that a child would 
have a WCV if a parent was enrolled 
in Medicaid compared with the 
parent not being enrolled (95% CI: 
17 to 73 percentage points, P = .002). 
The relationship remained positive, 
but was not statistically significant, in 
the <100% of the FPL income group 
(11 percentage points, 95% CI: −7.4 
to 30 percentage points, P = .237) 
(Table 4).
In sensitivity analyses (summarized 
in Supplemental Table 9), controlling 
for child Medicaid and/or CHIP 
enrollment did not significantly 
affect our results, revealing that 
parental Medicaid enrollment 
affects WCV use independently of 
children’s insurance status. Limiting 
our analysis to large states in which 
child eligibility for Medicaid and 
CHIP remained ≥200% through the

Downloaded from 
 study period revealed a positive 
relationship between parental 
Medicaid eligibility thresholds and 
WCVs for our primary analytic 
sample and a significantly positive 
relationship for a subset of this 
sample (families with incomes 
125%–200% of the FPL). Limiting 
our analysis to the pre-ACA 
period (2001–2008) also did not 
significantly affect our results. 
Finally, we did not find a significant 
association between parental 
Medicaid eligibility and WCVs in 
higher-income families (≥400% 
of the FPL), demonstrating that 
the effects of changes in Medicaid 
coverage were concentrated, as 
expected, among lower-income 
families.
DIscussIOn
Leveraging 13 years of changes in 
state Medicaid eligibility for adults 
and performing an IV analysis, we 
found that increases in the income 
threshold for adult Medicaid 
eligibility were associated with a 
greater likelihood that children 
in low-income families received 
at least 1 annual WCV. With our 
results, we provide evidence of an 
independent relationship between 
parental Medicaid enrollment and 
children’s primary care use in low-
income families, and we illustrate 
the potential for adult Medicaid 
expansions to have positive spillover 
effects on children’s health care use.
We found the strongest relationship 
between adult Medicaid eligibility 
and WCVs in near-poor families 
(100% to <200% of the FPL). This 
likely reflects the fact that increases 
in parental Medicaid eligibility during 
the 2000s primarily affected families 
with incomes slightly >100% of the 
FPL, whereas states with the least 
generous Medicaid coverage for 
nonpregnant adults generally did 
not expand parental eligibility over 
the study period. Our analyses were 
therefore less able to detect effects 
of eligibility changes in the lowest-
income families.
Several mechanisms may underlie 
this spillover effect of parental 
Medicaid coverage on WCV receipt. 
One hypothesis, supported by the 
Behavioral Model of Health Services 
Use, 
35 is that insurance enhances 
parents’ ability to navigate the health 
care system for themselves and 
for family members. This may lead 
to an increase in parental health-
seeking behaviors for their children 
(eg, scheduling WCVs). It may also

However, because our estimates 
were substantively unchanged 
after we controlled for children’s 
Medicaid and/or /State CHIP status, 
our analyses indicate that such a 
woodwork effect was not primarily 
responsible for changes in WCV use.
Another potential mechanism is that 
parental Medicaid coverage may 
improve families’ financial standing, 
freeing up resources to provide 
preventive services for children. 
Low-income families who enroll in 
public insurance have decreased out-
of-pocket medical spending and a 
reduced likelihood of bankruptcy.5,

Studies have revealed that children’s 
health care use is sensitive to out-

of Medicaid enrollment; however, 
we use a quasi-experimental design 
that leverages plausibly exogenous 
state-level policy changes to isolate 
the effect of parental Medicaid 
enrollment on WCVs from other 
family and person-level determinants 
of this relationship. Second, our 
analyses may not isolate the impact 
of changes in parental Medicaid 
eligibility and coverage on WCVs if 
states contemporaneously expanded 
Medicaid eligibility or increased 
coverage generosity for children. To 
address this concern, we conducted 
a sensitivity analysis in which we 
limited our analytic sample to states 
with CHIP or children’s Medicaid 
eligibility thresholds consistently 
>200% of the FPL. In this sensitivity 
analysis, we continued to find a 
positive relationship between 
parental eligibility for Medicaid and 
WCVs, particularly in near-poor 
families. Third, our study period 
encompasses several changes in 
the recommended WCV schedule, 
the introduction of the ACA’s 
requirement that insurance plans 
cover preventive services for 
children, and other efforts to increase 
pediatric preventive care.11 We 
incorporated year fixed effects into 
our models to control for temporal 
trends that may have resulted from 
these changes and verified that our 
results were unchanged when we 
limited the study period to years 
preceding these ACA mandates 
for pediatric care (2001–2009). 
Finally, many measures in the 
MEPS, including insurance status 
and health care use, are self-
reported and subject to recall and 
social desirability bias. However, 
respondents are aware that health 
care providers may be contacted to 
verify self-reported use, which may 
mitigate reporting error.15
These findings are of great 
significance given the current 
uncertainty surrounding the future 
of the ACA and Medicaid expansions 
authorized by the law. Our work 
highlights the potential for Medicaid 
expansions targeting low-income 
adults to mitigate disparities in the 
receipt of WCVs between low- and 
high-income families. Currently, 
19 states have not expanded adult 
Medicaid coverage to 138% of the 
FPL under the ACA. According to 
Current Population Survey data, ∼5.5 
million children in these 19 states 
live in families in which a parent 
would qualify for expanded Medicaid 
coverage. Our intention-to-treat 
estimates imply that the spillover 
effect of Medicaid expansion would 
result in ∼135 000 additional annual 
WCVs for low-income children in 
these 19 states (see Supplemental 
Information for calculation).
Likewise, our results reveal 
the potential for reductions in 
adult Medicaid coverage to have 
unintended spillover effects on 
children’s health care use. Recent 
proposals to reform the Medicaid 
program by using block grants or 
“per-capita caps” on federal financial 
support have raised the concern that 
states could curtail Medicaid benefits 
or eligibility, thereby significantly 
reducing parental enrollment.39, 
 
40 
Given the evidence that increased 
access to pediatric care early in life is 
associated with improved health and 
lower hospital use in adulthood, 
41 
–43 
changes in parental coverage may 
have long-term impacts on children 
that will be important to consider 
when modifying the Medicaid 
program.
cOnclusIOns
In our study, we demonstrate that 
parental Medicaid enrollment is 
associated with increases in pediatric 
primary care use in low-income 
families. Given the suboptimal rates 
of WCV use in low-income families, 
our findings suggest that efforts to 
expand Medicaid for parents may 
help to promote their children’s 
receipt of recommended preventive 
care.
