Objectives To estimate the prevalence, the frequency and 
the perpetrators of alcohol-related harm to others (AHTO) 
and identify factors associated with experiencing harm and 
aggressive harm.
Design Cross-sectional survey.
setting England.
Participants Adults (general population) aged 16 and over.
Outcome measures Percentage of respondents who 
experienced harm. Socioeconomic and demographic 
factors associated with the outcomes. Outcomes were 
(1) experienced harm/did not experience harm and (2) 
experienced aggressive harm (physically threatened, 
physically hurt and forced/pressured into something sexual)/
did not experience an aggressive harm (no aggressive harm 
plus no harm at all).
results Data to support a response rate calculation were 
not collected; 96.3% of people surveyed completed the 
AHTO questions. The weighted sample was 4874; 20.1% 
(95% CI 18.9 to 21.4, N=980) reported experiencing 
harm in the previous 12 months and 4.6% (95% CI 4.0 to 
5.4, N=225) reported experiencing an aggressive harm. 
Friends and strangers were the dominant perpetrators. 
Most harms (74.8%) occurred less than monthly. Factors 
associated with experiencing harm were: younger age 
(p<0.001), drinking harmfully/hazardously (p<0.001), 
white British (p<0.001 compared to other white groups 
and Asian groups and p=0.017 compared to black groups), 
having a disability (p<0.001), being educated (p<0.001 
compared to no education) and living in private rented 
accommodation (p=0.004 compared with owned outright). 
Being in the family stage of life (defined as having 
children in the household) had significantly lower odds of 
harm (p=0.006 compared to being single), as did being 
retired (p<0.001 compared to being employed). Factors 
associated with experiencing an aggressive harm were 
similar. 
Conclusions This exploratory study, using data 
collected through the Alcohol Toolkit Survey, shows 
that AHTO affects 20.1% of the population of England. 
Even apparently minor harms, like being kept awake, 
can have a negative impact on health, while aggressive 
harms are clearly of concern. Using a standard 
methodology to measure harm across studies would be 
advantageous. Policies that focus on alcohol must take 
into consideration the impact of drinking on those other 
than the drinker. 
IntrODuCtIOn  
The detrimental effects of alcohol are well 
documented; in 2012 alcohol consumption 
was responsible for approximately 6% of 
deaths and 5% of disease burden globally.1 
The focus has been on the harmful effects of 
alcohol on the drinker with less attention on 
the harms caused to others, including fami-
lies, work colleagues and wider society. The 
WHO’s global alcohol strategy highlights the 
need to consider the harm alcohol causes to 
people other than the drinker,2 and it is these 
alcohol-related harms to others (AHTO) that 
are the focus of this study.
Health and social data provide insight 
into the potential harms caused by another’s 
drinking. Data from the Crime Survey for 
England and Wales, for example, show that 
in just over half of all violent crimes the victim 
perceived the offender to be under the influ-
ence of alcohol and that drinking was partic-
ularly implicated in violent incidents between 
strangers.3 Data from the Department of 
Transport show that in England during 2013–
2015, there were almost 10 000 alcohol-re-
lated road traffic accidents in which at least 
one driver failed the alcohol breathalyser 
test (data are available at: https://

strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This is the largest survey on alcohol-related harm 
to others in the UK and the first national survey in 
England.
 
► The sampling approach and weighting ensured 
the data were representative of the population of 
England.
 
► There is potential selection bias which is inherent in 
all national surveys.
 
► The use of a bespoke survey made comparison of 
the findings with the literature difficult but when the 
study was initiated, no other universally accepted 
survey was identified.

demonstrating a considerable potential harm to both the 
drinking driver and to others on the roads.
In the last decade or so, several studies have aimed to 
quantify and explore AHTO in more detail. These studies 
have provided widely varying estimates of the prevalence 
of harm, largely due to differences in the way harms are 
defined and the reference population. Studies which focus 
on identifying the sociodemographic and behavioural 
factors associated with being the victim of harm do not 
always provide consistent findings, suggesting the need 
for further research. While there is a relatively consis-
tent finding across studies that younger age increases the 
likelihood of experiencing harm,4–6 the association of 
harm with other characteristics is less clear. For example, 
women have generally been identified as more at risk of 
harm from another’s drinking than men but this is not 
consistent across all countries and some authors report 
this association for certain types of harm only.4–7 Two 
studies identified that women were more likely to expe-
rience unwanted sexual attention/harassment/assault, 
whereas men were more likely to experience having their 
belongings or property damaged.4 6
When the impact of alcohol includes the effects to the 
individual drinker and wider society, the cost is consid-
erable. A review of studies in high-income countries 
found the gross economic costs of alcohol to range from 
1.4% to 2.7% of gross domestic product; in the UK in 
2016, this would be equivalent to between £27 billion and 
£52 billion.8 There is a need to better understand AHTO 
and the characteristics of those affected in order to imple-
ment an effective response. To date there has been no 
national survey of AHTO in England, although surveys 
have been conducted in Scotland,9 Wales10 and Ireland.11 
The objectives of this exploratory study were to estimate 
the prevalence of AHTO in England, identify factors asso-
ciated with being the victim of harm, the frequency with 
which this harm occurs and the perpetrators of harm.
MethOD
the survey
The questions to identify experience of AHTO were 
devised after an evidence review and were added to the 
Alcohol Toolkit Survey (ATS) between 1 November 2015 
and 31 January 2016. The ATS is a cross-sectional house-
hold survey, run by University College London and admin-
istered by Ipsos MORI using computer-assisted interviews. 
Each month, a new sample of adults aged 16 and over 
who live in England complete the survey. Households are 
selected using a type of random location sampling which 
is a hybrid of random probability sampling and simple 
quota sampling (so that each monthly sample is represen-
tative of the population). Interviews are conducted with 
one member of the selected household.12 The AHTO 
questions were self-completed following guidance on 
this from the Research Support and Governance Office, 
Public Health England. Due to the novel and exploratory 
nature of the work, no formal sample size calculation 
was undertaken as the parameters on which to base this 
were unknown. Instead, a 3-month window of data collec-
tion was chosen, knowing that the ATS aimed to survey 
approximately 1800 adults per month.12 The sample 
size was considerably larger than other studies of AHTO 
conducted in the UK.9 10 13
The AHTO questions asked whether or not the respon-
dent had experienced the following harms from anoth-
er’s drinking in the past 12 months:
Because of someone else’s drinking, I have…
1. Had a serious argument that did not include physical 
violence.
2. Felt physically threatened.
3. Been emotionally hurt or neglected.
4. Been physically hurt due to them assaulting me or 
acting violently.
5. Been physically hurt due to them accidentally injur-
ing me (eg, by falling on me).
6. Been put at risk in a car when someone was driving 
after drinking.
7. Felt forced or pressured into sex or something sexual.
8. Felt uncomfortable or anxious at a social occasion 
(eg, a party).
9. Had someone break or damage something that mat-
tered to me.
10. Had money that would have improved the quality of 
my life spent on their alcohol-related purchases.
11. Felt genuinely concerned that they may cause harm 
to my children or someone else’s children.
12. Had to spend my personal time caring for a person 
with a long-term health condition or disability that 
resulted from their current or previous drinking.
13. Been let down by someone due to them failing to do 
something that I was counting on them to do because 
of their drinking.
14. Been kept awake due to noise or disruption.
15. Drank alcohol myself in order to cope with the prob-
lems caused by their drinking.
16. Had to stop seeing or being in contact with someone 
because of their drinking.
17. Had to move out of my usual place of residence and 
stay somewhere else.
18. Had contact with the police.
If a respondent indicated that they had experienced 
any of the harms they were asked to indicate who perpe-
trated the harm and the frequency with which the harm 
occurred. Response options for who perpetrated the harm 
were: someone you were in a relationship with (eg, wife/
husband, partner) who you lived with, someone you were 
in a relationship with (eg, wife/husband, partner) who 
you did not live with, another family member you lived 
with, a family member you did not live with, someone else 
you lived with, a friend, a work colleague, someone else 
you know, a stranger, refused/prefer not to say and don’t 
know. Response options for the frequency of harm were: 
daily or almost daily (ie, 4–7 days per week), weekly (ie, 
1–3 times per week), monthly (ie, 2–3 times per month), 
less than once a month, refused/prefer not to say and

don’t know. For each of the 18 harms, people were able 
to select more than one perpetrator category. Respond-
ents were able to select only one frequency per harm. The 
frequency of harm could therefore include harm caused 
by more than one perpetrator. In some instances, people 
who reported a harm did not report who perpetrated this 
or how frequently the harm occurred. 
A range of demographic and socioeconomic variables, 
collected as part of the ATS, were used as independent 
variables: sex (female, male), age band in years (16–24, 
25–44, 45–64, 65 and over), broad ethnic group (white 
British, other white, black, Asian, other), life stage (single, 
prefamily, family, postfamily), educational attainment (no 
qualifications, General Certificate of Secondary Educa-
tion (GCSE)/O-level/General Certificate of Education 
(CSE), A-level/vocational, degree/higher degree, other/
still studying), social grade (AB (higher managerial, 
administrative and professional), C1 (supervisory, clerical 
and junior managerial, administrative and professional), 
C2 (skilled manual workers), D (semiskilled and unskilled 
manual workers), E (state pensioners, casual and lowest 
grade workers, unemployed with state benefits only)), 
tenure of home (owned outright, bought on a mortgage, 
rented from local authority, rented from private landlord, 
other), self-defined disability (yes, no) and employment 
status (employed, unemployed, economically inactive, 
retired). ‘Life stage’ was derived from age, marital status 
and number of children living in the household and 
is defined as follows: single (up to the age of 39, not 
married/in a civil partnership and no children in the 
household), prefamily (up to the age of 39, married/in 
a civil partnership and no children in the household), 
family (children living in the household) and postfamily 
(aged 40 and over, no children in the household). The 
respondents’ alcohol consumption was measured using 
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) 
which is used to identify hazardous and harmful drinkers. 
Here, hazardous/harmful drinkers were identified as 
those with scores of 8 or more if aged 65 or under, and 
scores of 7 or more if aged over 65, in line with WHO 
guidance.14
Analysis
Respondents who refused to complete the AHTO ques-
tions and those who chose the ‘don’t know’ or ‘refused/
prefer not to say’ options for all 18 harm questions were 
excluded from all analyses. χ2 tests were used to compare 
the characteristics of those who were included in the anal-
ysis to those that were excluded due to missing data on 
the AHTO questions. Individuals who failed to provide a 
valid response to other questions were excluded from the 
analysis of that particular independent variable. People 
with one or more missing covariate were excluded from 
the multivariate analyses.
Two binary dependent variables were created. ‘Any 
harm’ was coded as yes if a person had experienced any 
of the 18 harm types in the previous 12 months. ‘Aggres-
sive harm’ was coded as yes if the person had experienced 
one or more of the following three harms: felt physically 
threatened, been physically hurt due to them assaulting 
me or acting violently and felt forced or pressured into 
sex or something sexual. The categorisation of ‘aggressive 
harm’ is in line with previous research on AHTO.4
All analyses were undertaken using Stata V.13 and the 
‘svy’ command prefix for analysing survey data. Prev-
alence was estimated by dividing the positive responses 
by the total responses for each harm type, any harm and 
aggressive harm; 95% CI were calculated for each prev-
alence estimate using the standard settings of Stata’s 
‘svy: tabulate’ command.15 Bivariate independence was 
tested using a ‘corrected’ Pearson χ2 statistic for survey 
data (design-based F tests based on Rao and Scott correc-
tion).16 Multivariate analyses (binary logistic regression) 
were conducted to model the joint effects of the inde-
pendent variables significantly associated with any harm 
and aggressive harm in the bivariate analyses with ‘no 
harm’ and ‘no aggressive harm’ as the reference catego-
ries. Adjusted ORs (AOR) are presented in comparison 
to the reference category for the given variable and t tests 
provide an indication of statistical significance. Where 
comparisons are presented between categories of a vari-
able where neither is the reference category, an indica-
tion of statistical significance is given using adjusted Wald 
tests. Analyses were weighted (using weights generated by 
the ATS) in order to improve the representativeness of 
the sample relative to an English population profile using 
multiple sociodemographic variables.12  Analysis using 
weighted data results in small discrepancies in some totals 
and percentages due to rounding. For example, sample 
sizes were rounded to whole numbers because they repre-
sent people, but the percentages were calculated using 
unrounded values. Due to the exploratory nature of the 
analysis, α was set at 0.05 for all tests. The risk of type I 
error is considered less important than the risk of type 
II error: deflating α may limit further investigation at a 
point where the evidence base is developing.

Missing data
The original (unweighted) sample size was 5068. The 
proportion of missing data was relatively small; 96 people 
(1.9%) did not complete the AHTO questions and a 
further 91 (1.8%) answered ‘don’t know/refused’ to 
all AHTO questions; both groups were excluded from 
the analyses leaving an unweighted sample size of 4881 
(96.3% of the original sample). Online supplementary 
table 1 compares the number/proportion of people 
included in the analyses with those who were excluded 
because they did not provide a response to the AHTO 
questions, by independent variable.  There were signifi-
cant differences for four variables in the proportion of 
people that were excluded: sex (3.1% of females and

4.3% of males, p=0.023), tenure of home (2.5% of people 
who owned their own home outright, 4.6% of people 
who bought their home on a mortgage, 4.5% of people 
who rented from a local authority, 3.0% who rented 
from a private landlord and 6.4% of ‘other’, p<0.001), 
disability (5.6% of people who considered themselves as 
disabled and 3.2% of people who did not, p=0.002) and 
AUDIT score (3.3% of non-hazardous/harmful drinkers 
and 5.5% of hazardous/harmful drinkers, p=0.003). Of 
the 4881 people included in the bivariate analyses, 189 
(3.9%) were excluded from the multivariate analyses 
because one or more independent variable was missing.
Prevalence of harm
Table 1 reports the estimated prevalence of each type of 
harm. In total 980 people (20.1%, 95% CI 18.9%-21.4%) 
reported experiencing at least one harm due to someone 
else’s drinking in the past 12 months. These data by sex 
are reported in online supplementary table 2. While the 
numbers are too small to make a comprehensive assess-
ment of the differences by sex (and such differences are 
not the focus of this paper), some disparities in harm 
were evident. For example, there was a clear difference 
between the proportion of men (2.1%, 95% CI 1.6% to 
2.9%) and women (4.8%, 95% CI 3.9% to 5.8%) who 
reported experiencing alcohol-related emotional hurt 
or neglect. Aggressive harms were experienced by 225 
people (4.6%, 95% CI 4.0%-5.4%). 
bivariate and multivariate results (factors associated with 
harm)
Factors associated with experiencing any harm in the 
bivariate analyses are reported in table 2. Experience 
of harm decreased with age. This trend by age was 
reflected in experience of harm by life stage, with 36.5% 
(95% CI 32.8% to 40.5%, N=251) of single people

experiencing harm compared with 15.0% (95% CI 13.4% 
to 16.7% N=344) of those in a postfamily life stage. White 
British people were more likely to report experiencing 
harm (21.8%, 95% CI 20.3% to 23.4% N=830) than 
people of other broad ethnic groups; people of Asian 
ethnicity had the lowest prevalence (10.9%, 95% CI 8.2% 
to 14.2% N=46). People with no qualifications were least 
likely to report experiencing harm (9.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 
12.5% N=75). Those whose highest attainment was A-level 
or vocational had the highest prevalence (26.7%, 95% CI 
24.1% to 29.3% N=354). People in the private-rented 
sector had the highest harm prevalence by tenure (29.9%, 
95% CI 26.9% to 33.1% N=289). This compares to just 
14.0% (95% CI 12.3% to 16.0% N=237) of people who 
owned their home outright experiencing harm. People 
who considered themselves disabled were more likely 
to report having experienced harm than those who did 
not (24.0%, 95% CI 20.3% to 28.1%,  N=125 compared 
with 19.7%, 95% CI 18.4% to 21.1% N=842). Those who 
were unemployed (26.8%, 95% CI 21.0% to 33.6% N=58) 
or economically inactive (26.8%, 95% CI 24.0% to 
29.9% N=232) were more likely to report harm than 
those who were employed (22.0%, 95% CI 20.2% to 
24.0% N=588); the difference between the unemployed 
and employed was not significant. Retired people were 
much less likely to report experiencing at least one 
harm (9.1%, 95% CI 7.5% to 10.9% N=102) than people 
across all other employment statuses. The prevalence 
of AHTO was significantly higher among hazardous/
harmful drinkers (37.9%, 95% CI 33.9% to 42.1% N=256) 
compared with those who were not (17.3%, 95% CI 16.0% 
to 18.6% N=723).
In the multivariate model, young age remained strongly 
associated with experiencing harm due to someone else’s 
drinking, with those aged 16–24 having greater odds of 
experiencing harm than all older age groups (table 2). 
Being a hazardous/harmful drinker was strongly associ-
ated with experiencing harm; the odds of experiencing 
harm were around double the odds of those who were 
not hazardous/harmful drinkers. Being white British 
compared with being other white, black or Asian ethnici-
ties was also associated with greater odds of experiencing 
harm, as was considering oneself disabled, being educated 
and living in private-rented accommodation compared 
with being an owning outright. The odds of experiencing 
harm were lower for respondents in the family stage of 
life than the odds for those that were single. The odds 
of experiencing harm were lower for retired respondents 
than the odds for employed respondents.
Aggressive harm
In bivariate analyses, men were marginally more likely to 
experience an aggressive harm than women (5.3% and 
4.0% respectively, p=0.04, table 3). The other character-
istics associated with experiencing aggressive harms were 
similar to experiencing any harm, with a higher preva-
lence of aggressive harm associated with being younger, 
disabled, single, non-retired, white British, renting 
accommodation and being a hazardous/harmful drinker.
Controlling for other variables in the model, sex and 
stage of life were not associated with experiencing an 
aggressive harm (table 3). Age remained associated with 
harm after adjustment for other variables; those aged 45 
and over had lower odds of experiencing an aggressive

harm than those aged 16–24. Disability was also strongly 
associated with experience of aggressive harm; the odds 
of experiencing aggressive harm for non-disabled people 
was just over a third of the odds for disabled people 
(AOR=0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59). Housing tenure was 
relatively strongly associated, with the odds of experi-
encing an aggressive harm for renters around double 
the odds of those who are home owners. This was also 
the case for hazardous/harmful drinkers, with an AOR 
of 2.35 (95% CI 1.63 to 3.40) relative to those who were 
not hazardous/harmful drinkers. Being white British 
compared with being in the other white, black or Asian 
ethnic groups was also associated with greater odds of 
experiencing an aggressive harm. Differences in the odds 
of experiencing an aggressive harm between people with 
different educational attainment were minimal; the only 
significant difference being the greater odds for those 
with a degree/higher degree relative to those with no 
qualifications. The odds of experiencing an aggressive 
harm for those that were retired remained significantly 
lower than the odds of an aggressive harm for those that 
were employed (AOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83).
Perpetrators of harm
Respondents could select more than one perpetrator 
category per harm type. Overall, the most frequently 
reported perpetrators of harms were friends (23.4% of 
total perpetrator reports N=590) and strangers (22.9% of 
total perpetrator reports,  N=578), while work colleagues 
were the least reported perpetrators (3.7%, of total perpe-
trator reports, N=94,  figure 1). The perpetrator varied 
according to the type of harm (online supplementary table 
3). Focussing on the most common harms experienced, 
being kept awake due to noise or disruption was predom-
inantly perpetrated by strangers (49.5%, 95% CI 43.8% to 
55.3%;  of the 370 people who were kept awake at night,

183 indicated a stranger perpetrated this harm),  while 
both strangers and friends were the most common cause 
of feeling uncomfortable or anxious at a social occasion 
(strangers 34.4%, 95% CI 28.5% to 40.7%; N=105/305 
friends 32.8%, 95% CI 27.2% to 39.0% N=100/305). 
Serious arguments that did not include physical violence 
were predominantly perpetrated by friends (35.7%, 
95% CI 29.5% to 42.6% N=93/260) or someone the 
respondent was in a relationship with and lived with 
(23.1%, 95% CI 17.6% to 29.6% N=60/259). Likewise, 
being let down by someone or being emotionally hurt or 
neglected were harm types perpetrated by people close to 
respondents.
 Strangers were most likely to be the perpetrators of 
two of the aggressive harms: of the 154 respondents who 
reported being physically threatened, 93 indicated a 
stranger perpetrated this harm (60.5%, 95% CI 51.2%– 
to 69.1%). Of the 83 people who reported being phys-
ically hurt, 26 said a stranger perpetrated this harm 
(31.5%, 95% CI 21.5% to 43.6%). While 19.0% (95% CI 
6.5% to 44.2%, N=5/27) of respondents who reported 
being forced or pressured into sex or something sexual 
reported the perpetrator was a stranger, the most 
commonly reported perpetrator for this sexually aggres-
sive harm was someone the respondent was in a relation-
ship with and lived with (23.3%, 95% CI 9.8% to 46.0%, 
N=6/27; rising to 39.9% when also including people in a 
relationship who lived elsewhere). 
Frequency of harm
Figure 2 reports information on the frequency with 
which harms were experienced. The majority of reported 
harms were experienced less than once a month 
(N=1536, 74.8%); 12.8% (N=262) of harms were experi-
enced at least monthly but less than weekly, 7.2% (N=149) 
of harms were experienced weekly but less than daily and 
5.2% (N=106) of harms were experienced daily or almost 
daily.
The frequency of harm varied by harm type 
(online supplementary table 4). The harm types reported 
to reoccur most often were those for which the descrip-
tion implies that the harm occurred over a prolonged 
period of time with someone whom the respondent was 
in regular contact. These included ‘had to spend my 
personal time caring for a person with a long-term health 
condition or disability that resulted from their current 
or previous drinking’ (19.4% of people [10/53] who 
reported experiencing this harm did so  daily or almost 
daily, 95% CI 10.2% to 33.8%) and ‘had to stop seeing or 
being in contact with someone because of their drinking’ 
(19.3% of people [21/107] who reported experiencing 
this harm did so daily or almost daily, 95% CI 11.9% to 
29.6%). It was less common for other harms to be expe-
rienced at a daily or almost daily frequency. Nevertheless, 
all harm types had at least one respondent reporting daily 
or almost daily frequency of harm.
DIsCussIOn
In this exploratory study, one in five respondents expe-
rienced AHTO in the previous 12 months. The most 
commonly reported AHTO were being kept awake due 
to noise or disruption and feeling uncomfortable or 
anxious at a social occasion which have been identified 
as the most prevalent harms in other studies.4 5 More 
concerning, 4.6% reported experiencing an aggressive 
harm. Experiencing AHTO was associated with a number 
of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Friends 
and strangers were the dominant perpetrators of AHTO.
Most harms occurred less than monthly but some harms 
were experienced daily or almost daily. 
The main strength of this study is its large sample size; 
this is the largest survey on AHTO conducted in the UK 
and the first to provide data for England. The sampling 
and weighting strategy employed ensured the sample was 
representative of the English population and thus the 
generalisability of the findings. There are a number of 
limitations to note. Recall is always a problem with surveys; 
harms that occurred a year ago or had little impact on the 
respondent may be more difficult to recall. Attributing 
causality is not possible using a cross-sectional design. 
There are also some social groups that are systematically 
missing from surveys such as homeless people, those in 
hospital or care homes and those in prison; populations 
whose alcohol use is likely to be different.17 Previous 
studies on AHTO have also largely relied on cross-sec-
tional surveys and are affected by the same limitations. A 
response rate could not be calculated because Ipsos MORI 
did not collect the necessary data. While the total amount 
of missing data is small, any missing data can potentially 
introduce bias. There were some significant differences 
in the characteristics of those that answered the AHTO 
questions and those that did not. The internal validity of 
the AHTO questions used here has not been measured; 
in the initial search of the literature the authors failed 
to identify a validated survey. Consequently, it is possible 
that discrepancies exist between the responses provided 
by participants and their actual experience of alcohol-re-
lated harm. Finally, ecological fallacy, where the infer-
ences about individuals are made based on data for a 
group, is also a consideration in this type of study. It is

likely that systematic differences exist in harm by popula-
tion subgroups (eg, by sex and ethnicity) and future work 
on AHTO in the UK should explore this. It is possible that 
the findings on factors associated with harm represent 
those that are associated with the most common but ‘low 
impact’ harms and cannot be generalised to more severe 
harms. However, the fact that we specifically examine 
factors associated with aggressive harms (which are the 
most serious harms considered) mitigates this. That said, 
further research to identify the factors associated with 
individual harms would be advantageous.
In this study, the prevalence of harm was 20.1%. 
The closest comparison is from a cross-sectional survey 
conducted in Wales in 2015 which used identical AHTO 
questions and reported the prevalence of any harm in 
the previous 12 months to be 59.7%.10 There is some 
evidence from routine data to support a lower preva-
lence of harm in England than Wales. For example, the 
percentage of violent incidents where the victim believed 
the offender(s) to be under the influence of alcohol 
tends to be higher in Wales than England18 although not 
conclusively so. However, the magnitude of the difference 
in the reported prevalence of harm between England and 
Wales seems questionable, given the similarities between 
the two nations. This difference could be due, in part, 
to differences in methodology and caution needs to be 
applied in drawing direct comparisons. In Wales, a free 
text box was included that gave participants the option 
to report ‘other alcohol-related harm’, and these were 
included in the ‘any harm’ figures for Wales which would 
likely increase the prevalence compared with England. 
This approach was not undertaken in England because 
not all harms reported in the free text box appeared to be 
alcohol- related,  while others appeared to repeat harms 
already included within the 18 specific AHTO questions. 
In England, the harm questions were asked after the ATS 
questions; this may have affected how people perceived 
harm, and therefore how they responded to the harm 
questions. It is also possible that respondents were expe-
riencing fatigue by the end of the survey and this may 
have affected how fully they reported their experiences of 
harm. The English survey was administered face-to-face 
while the survey in Wales was administered via the tele-
phone using landline numbers. Using data from the USA, 
researchers comparing face-to-face and telephone inter-
views reported that telephone surveys may miss certain 
sections of the population if they solely rely on landlines, 
including those with lower incomes.19 However, the Welsh 
survey was weighted so the data were representative of the 
deprivation of the general population.10 Other surveys of 
AHTO conducted in the UK have reported the prevalence 
of harm in adults to be 28% in Ireland,11 51% in Scot-
land,9 79% in the North West of England,13 however these 
studies used very different AHTO questions so the results 
are not comparable. Despite the difference in prevalence 
between the Welsh survey and the current study, the rela-
tive prevalence of the types of harm were similar; being 
kept awake at night, feeling uncomfortable or anxious at 
a social occasion and having a serious argument were the 
most prevalent harms in both surveys.
Being a hazardous/harmful drinker increased the odds 
of experiencing AHTO. This is perhaps unsurprising given 
that drinking with other drinkers and in places where 
alcohol is consumed increases one’s exposure to drinkers. 
However, the association with drinking and experiencing 
alcohol-harm is not conclusive. A cross-sectional compar-
ison of harm from ‘heavy drinking’ friends and family 
across five Nordic countries and Scotland reported that 
drinking frequency was not significantly related to expe-
riencing harm from others but binge drinking frequency 
was. A higher frequency of binge drinking increased the 
risk of experiencing AHTO in Sweden and Norway, and 
there was some evidence for this relationship in Finland 
also, but not in the other countries.7 A paper using 
the same Norwegian data showed that the association 
between experiencing harm, and one’s own drinking was 
not evident for all types of harm.6 Other cross-sectional 
surveys show an association between one’s own drinking 
and experience of any harm,20 21 including two which 
report a dose response relationship, with dependent/
frequent risky drinkers having the greatest risk.4 22
Here, age was also associated with experiencing any 
harm and aggressive harm. A number of studies from a 
range of countries have reported that being of younger 
age increases the risk of being harmed from another’s 
drinking.4–7 23 However, ‘younger age’ in this context 
does not always mean ‘young’; one study, for example, 
concluded that those aged 59 or less had a higher risk of 
being negatively affected by a known drinker than those 
aged 60 and over.7 A global survey of 63 725 respondents 
aged 18–34 years reported that those aged 18–24 years 
were significantly more likely to experience an aggressive 
AHTO than those aged 30–34 or 25–294; similar to results 
reported here.
The respondent’s sex was not significantly associ-
ated with experiencing harm. The literature is mixed 
regarding sex as a risk factor. Women were reported to 
be significantly more likely to experience harm than men 
in Finland and Sweden but not in Denmark, Iceland, 
Norway or Scotland.5 6 Being a woman was found to 
be a significant risk factor for all harms and aggressive 
harms using data from the Global Drug Survey.4 The 
association of sex and experiencing harm is different for 
different types of harm. For example, women are signifi-
cantly more likely than men to experience unwanted 
sexual attention/sexual harassment or assault,4 6 whereas 
men are more likely to have clothing, property or other 
belongings damaged.4 6 Survey data from the USA exam-
ined family/marriage, financial and assault harms due 
to drinking of a partner/spouse/family member and 
reported that women were more likely to report financial 
and family/martial harms while a higher proportion of 
men experienced assaults.24 While examining differences 
in harm by sex was not the focus of this study, online 
supplementary table 2 shows that such differences may 
exist. For example, there is a clear difference between

the proportion of men (2.1%, 95% CI 1.6% to 2.9%) and 
women (4.8%, 95% CI 3.9% to 5.8%) who reported expe-
riencing alcohol-related emotional hurt or neglect. Such 
differences should be considered in future work on this 
topic in the UK.
Few studies have considered whether ethnic back-
ground is a risk factor for experiencing harm. Data from 
the USA demonstrate that the link between ethnicity and 
experience of harm is not conclusive (two studies show 
no association and one a weak association).20 23 24 Here, 
being white British was significantly associated with expe-
riencing harm and also aggressive harm. Most minority 
ethnic groups in the UK have higher rates of abstinence 
from alcohol and lower levels of drinking than people of 
white ethnicity.25 However, the results of the multivariate 
modelling presented in this study show that white British 
ethnicity is associated with experiencing harm and aggres-
sive harm independently of AUDIT score.
Having a disability was also significantly associated 
with experiencing any harm and an aggressive harm. 
No previous studies on the association between having 
a disability and experiencing alcohol-related harm were 
identified. However, there is good evidence to show 
that those with a disability are the victims of harm more 
generally including physical, sexual and intimate partner 
violence,26 27 and financial hardship.28
Being in the family stage of life also lowered the odds 
of experiencing harm compared with being single. This 
is perhaps surprising given that the survey included ques-
tions which specifically asked about harms most likely 
caused by a family member. Evidence on the effect of 
relationships and household types is mixed and largely 
dependent on the way these are categorised and so 
cannot be directly compared.
Educational attainment, type of accommodation, social 
grade and employment status are proxy measures for 
socioeconomic status. Literature on the effect of socio-
economic status is mixed, and comparisons are hindered 
by the multitude of different measures used in different 
studies. In this study, social grade was not significantly 
associated with harm or aggressive harm in the bivariate 
analyses. A study in Scotland also reported no significant 
difference in experience of any harm according to social 
class.9
Here, findings show that experiencing harm was signifi-
cantly associated with having qualifications (compared 
with having none) with the greatest odds being for those 
with a degree or higher degree. The association between 
education and experience of harm in the literature is 
mixed. Data from two national surveys (Denmark29 and 
the USA20) showed no clear association between experi-
encing harm and education level. Data from the Global 
Drug Survey showed no association between education 
and experience of harm or aggressive harm but there was 
an association between education and experiencing partic-
ular types of harm.4 However, a comparison of northern 
European countries reported that a significantly higher 
proportion of respondents with high school/university 
education experienced harm than those with elementary 
education in four of the six countries considered.5 Those 
with higher educational attainment were more likely to 
experience any harm in a Canadian study.30
The current study shows that being retired lowers the 
odds of experiencing harm and aggressive harm compared 
with all other employment statuses. This association was 
independent of age. The odds of being harmed did not 
differ significantly between those who were employed 
and not employed. A cross-sectional survey in Canada 
also reported that those who were retired were least likely 
to experience harm.30 Data from two surveys conducted 
in the USA show that those who were unemployed were 
significantly more likely to experience AHTO than those 
who were employed.23 24 Data from Denmark show that 
employment might be significantly associated with expe-
riencing harm but no conclusive results were provided, 
and the wide CIs show that estimates lacked precision.29 
Conversely, data from the USA reported no association 
between experiencing any harm and employment status.20
Here, compared with those that owned their home 
outright, those who rented from a private landlord had 
significantly greater odds of experiencing harm and 
those who rented from the local authority or rented from 
a private landlord had significantly greater odds of expe-
riencing an aggressive harm. No previous studies on the 
association between type of accommodation tenure and 
experiencing alcohol-related harm were identified. It is 
possible that those who rent represent a more transitory, 
poor and vulnerable population which increases their 
risk of harm. Research not specifically related to alcohol 
shows that those living in unstable housing (eg, living on 
the streets, in temporary sheltered accommodation or 
with relatives or friends) experience relatively high rates 
of victimisation,31 32 while data from national surveys in 
Great Britain show that being the victim of domestic prop-
erty crimes is higher among those who rent (including 
those in the private-rented sector) than those who own 
their own homes.33
How exactly socioeconomic status influences the expe-
rience of harm is not clear from our findings. Neither 
social grade nor employment status (excepting retire-
ment) were associated with AHTO in our study. Educa-
tion, as a proxy of earning potential, was associated with 
AHTO, but there was no significant variation between 
the groups GCSE/O-level/CSE, A-level/vocational and 
degree/higher degree. No clear picture of the associa-
tion between experience of harm and socioeconomic 
status emerges from the literature either. A comparable 
study of AHTO in Wales reported no association between 
experience of any harm and area-level deprivation.10 It is 
possible that more sensitive methods are needed to fully 
explore the relationship between socioeconomic status 
and AHTO, and any patterns in relation to particular 
types of harm.
In the UK, there are cultural differences in drinking 
behaviour, and some of these are reflected in our AHTO 
findings (such as differences between ethnic groups).34

However, other sociocultural variations are not easily 
identified in our findings. For example, while national 
survey data show that people have different drinking 
habits across income levels (people on higher incomes 
tend to drink more34), this pattern is not reflected in our 
findings on socioeconomic status.
This study identified friends and strangers as the domi-
nant perpetrators making up around 46% of all reports, 
though the perpetrator varied depending on type of 
harm. For example, family members made up a larger 
proportion of perpetrators of harms such as stopping 
seeing someone or having to care for someone because 
of their drinking. While three-quarters of harms were 
experienced less than monthly, 5.2% were experienced 
daily or almost daily indicating a considerable burden of 
alcohol-related harm for a section of the population. The 
frequency of experiencing harm was largely dependent 
on the type of harm. Harms with the highest frequency 
of daily/almost daily reports were those which occurred 
over a prolonged period of time and/or implied frequent 
contact with the perpetrator such as caring for someone 
with a long-term health condition or disability that results 
from them drinking. Data from two surveys suggest that 
exposure to heavy drinkers is associated with poorer 
health, well-being and quality of life.37 38
To conclude, this is the largest ever survey of AHTO 
conducted within the UK and the first national study in 
England. It is clear that AHTO is relatively prevalent and 
that some individuals experience harm frequently. The 
most prevalent harms could be considered trivial but 
even apparently minor harms such as sleep disruption 
can have an impact on health and quality of life,39 partic-
ularly if experienced persistently. It is difficult to compare 
results with the literature because of the diversity of 
methods being employed. In order to support temporal 
and geographical comparisons, it would be advantageous 
for studies to use a consistent methodology including 
the sampling and data collection methods, in addition to 
the harm questions. The WHO ThaiHealth project has 
designed a survey to measure AHTO in order to facilitate 
international comparisons40 41 but unfortunately authors 
were not aware of this when they began the current study. 
While lengthy, using this would be a good way to develop 
a comprehensive and consistent evidence base. However, 
it is clear that there are differences across harm types and 
more detailed analysis of specific harms would be valuable 
for supporting remedial action from policy-makers. Here, 
we consider ‘aggressive harms’ as a distinctive group of 
harms; future research could consider other harm group-
ings in order to provide a more detailed assessment of 
specific harm types. Research on the types of alcohol 
consumption patterns that increase the likelihood of 
experiencing AHTO in the UK would be valuable. Under-
standing what puts younger adults at increased risk could 
be a useful focus for future research as it might identify 
the contextual factors which make experiencing harm 
more likely. Further focus on the differences in harm by 
sex would also be advantageous as there is little data on 
this in relation to the UK. Policy to address AHTO is less 
well developed than policy that seeks to address harms 
to the drinker; exceptions include crime and violence 
and harm to the unborn fetus which have been included 
in previous Government’s Alcohol Strategy.42 Given that 
AHTO research is in its early stages, it is too early to advo-
cate a detailed policy response but results presented here 
will be of interest to policy-makers to help understand the 
wider impact of other people’s drinking.
