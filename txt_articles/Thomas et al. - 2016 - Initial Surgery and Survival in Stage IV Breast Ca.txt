Initial Surgery and Survival in Stage IV Breast Cancer
in the United States, 1988-2011
Alexandra Thomas, MD; Seema A. Khan, MD; Elizabeth A. Chrischilles, PhD; Mary C. Schroeder, PhD
IMPORTANCE Management of the primary tumor site in patients with metastatic breast
cancer remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the patterns of receipt of initial breast surgery for female patients
with stage IV breast cancer in the United States, with particular attention to women who
survived at least 10 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study using data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Female patients diagnosed as
having stage IV breast cancer between 1988 and 2011 and who did not receive radiation
therapy as part of the first course of treatment were included (N = 21 372). Kaplan-Meier
estimates of median survival and descriptive statistics were used to compare patient and
tumor characteristics by receipt of breast surgery at diagnosis. A Royston-Parmar survival
model and logistic regression analysis assessed demographic and clinical factors associated
with survival and prolonged survival (of at least 10 years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Differences in survival, particularly survival of at least 10
years, by receipt of initial surgery to the primary tumor.
RESULTS Among the 21 372 patients, the median survival increased from 20 months
(1988-1991) to 26 months (2007-2011). During this time, the rate of surgery declined (odds
ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% CI, 0.12-0.21). Even so, receipt of surgery was associated with improved
survival in multivariate analysis, which controlled for patient and clinical characteristics, along
with time period (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63). For women diagnosed as having
cancer before 2002 (n = 7504), survival of at least 10 years was seen in 9.6% (n = 353) and
2.9% (n = 107) of those who did and did not receive surgery, respectively (OR, 3.61; 95% CI,
2.89-4.50). In multivariate analysis, survival of at least 10 years was associated with receipt of
surgery (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.08-3.77), hormone receptor–positive disease (OR, 1.76;
95% CI, 1.25-2.48), older age (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32-0.54), larger tumor size (OR, 0.37; 95%
CI, 0.27-0.51), marital status of being separated at the time of diagnosis (OR, 0.67; 95% CI,
0.51-0.88), and more recent year of diagnosis (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-1.99).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Survival in stage IV breast cancer has improved and is
increasingly of prolonged duration, particularly for some women undergoing initial breast
surgery. As systemic therapy advances provide better control of distant disease in stage IV
breast cancer, and as women present with lower distant disease burdens, these findings on
initial surgery to the primary tumor may be of importance.

reast canceristhemostcommonmalignancyinwomen
in the United States and the developed world.1,2 Ap-
proximately 5% to 10% of women diagnosed as having
breast cancer present with stage IV disease and have an intact
primary breast tumor.3 While this represents a small portion
of patients with breast cancer, given the prevalence of the dis-
ease, management of the primary tumor in stage IV disease re-
mains a common clinical scenario. As with earlier-stage dis-
ease, these tumors are heterogeneous with regard to biology
and disease burden. The appropriate local management of the
primary tumor in stage IV breast cancer, which currently is
largely considered incurable, continues to be debated.
Thisquestionhasalsobeenconsideredinothersolidtumors.

ever, these studies also noted that patients undergoing surgery
were younger and healthier, likely introducing bias and con-
founding practical interpretation of these data. Randomized

andreport.Tworandomizedtrials,heretopresentedonlyinab-
stractform,failedtoshowanoverallsurvivalbenefittoprimary
disease-site surgery.12,13 Prospectively enrolled registries may
also further delineate the role of surgery in metastatic breast
cancer.14 Current guidelines for the management of stage IV
breast cancer consider this a systemic disease and generally re-
serve primary site treatment for palliation of local symptoms.
More recent literature has found subsets of women who
may benefit from aggressive local management. A random-
ized clinical trial from Turkey, with more than 20 months of
follow-up, suggested that patients with solitary bone metas-
tases had significantly improved survival following complete
excision of the primary breast tumor and regional nodes.12
However, interpretation of this work is limited by small pa-
tient numbers and lack of a confirmatory biopsy of the pre-
sumptive metastatic site. A retrospective study of 300 women
found a survival advantage for patients undergoing breast sur-
gery who had bone-only metastases.9 A large meta-analysis
found survival benefit in women with small primary tumors,
fewer comorbidities, and lower metastatic burden.15
In contrast, the benefit of local control in stage IV breast
cancer for palliation is well established.16-18 Previous random-
ized clinical trials have also reported benefit for primary sur-
gery to the breast in establishing local disease control.12,13 Ad-
ditionally, at least 1 retrospective series has also suggested that
local control, established through early resection of the breast
tumor, can be associated with improved survival, although
again bias was a concern and randomized clinical trials to ad-
dress this question were urged.18
Importantly, the spectrum of stage IV breast cancer is also
evolving. Precise modern imaging often captures small depos-
itsofmetastaticdisease.Manywomendiagnosedashavingstage
IV disease today have a lower overall disease burden than their
counterparts from earlier eras. These lower disease loads likely
have survival implications. Several reports, largely institu-
tional series, described prolonged survival in women with lim-
ited stage IV disease treated with aggressive multimodality
therapy.19-21 With this increasingly common scenario of du-
rable control of stage IV disease, management of the intact pri-
mary breast tumor may again be a relevant question.
In this context, we report outcomes by initial treatment to
the primary site, by period, for women presenting with stage
IV breast cancer in the National Cancer Institute’
s Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry from
1988-2011. We also describe treatment trends over time and
survival outcomes by clinical parameters. The characteristics
of women who experienced prolonged survival (≥10 years) are
also presented.
Methods
We obtained population-based data from the SEER program,
whichcurrentlyincludes18cancerregistriesandcoversapproxi-
mately 28% of the US population.22 The SEER program collects
demographic(eg,patientageatdiagnosis,sex,race/ethnicity,and
marital status) and clinical (eg, cancer site, histology, stage, tu-
morsize,andhormonereceptorstatus)information,alongwith
local therapy (surgery and/or radiation) and length of survival.
TheSEERprogramidentifiesonlythefirstcourseoftherapy,de-
fined as those recorded in the treatment plan at diagnosis and
administered before disease progression or recurrence.
This study was reviewed and approved by the institu-
tional review board at the University of Iowa and determined
to not be human participant research; therefore, patient con-
sent was waived.
Between 1988 and 2011, 39 875 women were diagnosed as
having microscopically confirmed, adjusted American Joint
Committee on Cancer sixth edition stage IV breast cancer. Pa-
tients were excluded if they were diagnosed as having dis-
ease at autopsy or on death certificate (n = 69), if the index
breast cancer was not known to be their first malignant pri-
mary (n = 5610), or if their first course of local therapy was un-
known (n = 1126). Because SEER does not record the ana-
tomic site of radiation, individuals were also excluded if they
received radiation as part of initial therapy, as this could have
been delivered to a distant site (n = 11 698). Our final cohort
included 21 372 women (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

95% CIs of these differences were calculated via bootstrap. A
multivariate survival model was implemented to assess fac-
tors associated with overall mortality. Royston-Parmar sur-
vival functions were chosen instead of a Cox model because
theproportionalhazardsassumptionwasviolated.23Thebase-
line survival function was approximated and smoothed by a
restricted cubic spline function with 5 df (4 intermediate knots
placed at quintiles of the distribution of events and 2 knots at
eachboundary).Thisflexibleparametricsurvivalmodelframe-
work is able to account for time-dependent effects using a sec-
ond spline function (a deviation from the baseline spine) to fit
interactions between the covariate and time. We allowed treat-
ment and age effects to vary over time, specifying 3 df for the
spline. The underlying time scale was defined as time in
months since breast cancer diagnosis.
We also performed additional analyses to assess pro-
longedsurvivalof10ormoreyears.Forthesesubanalyses,only
patients diagnosed as having cancer before 2002 were in-
cluded to allow sufficient follow up (n = 7504). The charac-
teristics of women who survived at least 10 years after diag-
nosis (n = 460) was compared with those who died within 20
months, the median survival for this sample (n = 4152). A mul-
tivariate logistic model predicted prolonged survival, control-
ling for receipt of surgery, patient characteristics, and period
(1988-1991, 1992-1996, and 1997-2001).
Surgery use over the study period was estimated using

linear regression models were used to calculate average an-
nual percentage change for each trend segment.

and Joinpoint version 4.2 (National Cancer Institute).
Results
Patient Characteristics
The full cohort of women from SEER who presented with de
novo stage IV disease from 1988-2011 and who did not re-
ceive upfront radiation therapy included 21 372 patients
(Table 1). Surgery was recorded in the initial treatment plan at
diagnosisanddeliveredto39.0%ofwomen(n = 8330).Women
receiving no surgery were on average 1.9 years older than
women who received surgery (64.0 vs 62.1 years; 95% CI of
difference, 1.5-2.3). Larger tumor size (>5 cm) correlated with
no surgery. Married women represented the largest propor-
tion of women and were more likely to undergo surgery than
single or separated women. Although black women make up
12% to 13% of the female population24 and 10.4% of all inva-
sivefemalebreastcancers,25theycomprised16.1%ofthestudy
sample. They were also less likely to undergo surgery. Over-
all, HR-negative tumors were more likely to receive surgery
than HR-positive tumors, although this was not consistently
the case until after 2001 (results not shown).

Surgery Over Time
Surgery trends changed significantly over the 24-year period
(Figure).Overtime,fewerwomenreceivedsurgery,from67.8%
in1988to25.1%in2011(oddsratio[OR],0.16;95%CI,0.12-0.21).
The average annual percentage decrease in the proportion of
women receiving surgery was 3.2% (95% CI, 2.7%-3.7%) from
1988-2006 and 7.1% (95% CI, 4.9%-9.3%) from 2006-2011.
Survival by Receipt of Surgery
For the entire cohort, the median survival was 23 months
(Table 2). Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in eFigure
2 in the Supplement. Those undergoing surgery had longer
median survival than those who did not (28 months vs 19
months; 95% CI of difference, 7.6-10.4). Improved survival
was associated with surgery, regardless of tumor size. Women
with tumors 2 cm or smaller saw an additional improvement
in survival of 11 months (95% CI, 6.4-15.6) with surgery. The
increase was 7 months for those with tumors greater than 5
cm (95% CI, 4.9-9.0).
Irrespectiveofsurgery,mediansurvivalhasincreasedover
time, with the largest gains occurring after 2001. Women di-
agnosed as having breast cancer from 1988-1991 who under-
went surgery had a median survival of 24 months. Their coun-
terparts in 2007-2011 had an improvement of 11 months (95%
CI, 6.8-15.2).

Estimates from the flexible parametric survival model re-
veal an association between surgery and longer survival
(Table 3). Younger age, smaller tumor, more recent year of di-
agnosis, being married at the time of diagnosis, white or other
race/ethnicity, and HR positivity were also associated with lon-
ger survival. Controlling for all other covariates, the largest ef-
fect size was associated with HR-positive tumors (hazard ra-
tio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.50-0.56), followed by receipt of surgery
(hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63) and then age 65 years
and older (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.46-1.62). Propensity-
adjusted analyses were conducted ad hoc, as a number of fac-
tors were associated with both treatment and survival (eTable
1 in the Supplement). Results from this model found similar
survivalimprovementsassociatedwithsurgery(OR,0.63;95%
CI, 0.60-0.66).
Prolonged Survival
Women with stage IV breast cancer are increasingly experienc-
ing prolonged survival. For women diagnosed as having stage
IV breast cancer before 2002 (n = 7504), 6.2% survived 10 or
more years (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Women who re-
ceivedsurgerytotheintacttumoratdiagnosisweremorelikely
tosurviveatleast10yearsthanthosewhodidnot(9.6%vs2.9%;
OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.89-4.50). Of women who underwent sur-
gery as initial local therapy, 13.5% of those 45 to 64 years old,
13.4%ofthosewithtumorsize2cmorsmaller,and11.1%ofthose
with HR-positive disease survived 10 or more years.
Characteristics of women diagnosed as having stage IV
breast cancer before 2002 who survived 10 or more years
(n = 460) were compared with those who died within 20
months (n = 4152), the median survival for this group (eTable
3 in the Supplement). Factors associated with prolonged sur-
vival in this univariate analysis were similar to those associ-
ated with median survival.
On multivariate analysis, survival of at least 10 years was
most strongly associated with surgery (Table 4). Women who
received surgery were 2.80 times more likely to survive at least
10 years than those who did not (95% CI, 2.08-3.77). Similar

year of diagnosis. Propensity-adjusted models were also fit-

Discussion
This study provides contemporary information from a large
population-based data set on the complex topic of survival for
women receiving initial surgery to the primary tumor in stage
IV breast cancer. This updates earlier reports, which de-
scribed outcomes for women diagnosed as having stage IV
breast cancer more than a decade ago.7-9 Importantly, the pro-
portion and characteristics of a large cohort of long-term sur-
vivors are described. Limited literature has previously been
available on this subset of patients with breast cancer.26
During the study, treatment changed significantly, with
fewer women who presented with de novo metastatic breast
cancer receiving surgery to the primary tumor. This is consis-
tent with the dogma that evolved over this period that meta-
static breast cancer is a systemic disease and local therapy
would have little impact on outcome. As we move into an era
with markedly improved systemic therapies, enhanced radio-
therapy, and advanced radiology, which finds ever smaller de-
posits of distant disease, this is a concept that may need to be
revisited. Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women
such as those with an already established potential for du-
rable remission, including those with oligometastatic disease
or disease that is biologically vulnerable to newer systemic
therapies.19-21,27-29Removaloftheprimarybreasttumorinsuch
cases could improve survival by providing local control, eradi-
cating a potential seed source and possibly a stimulant of dis-
tant disease sites, and perhaps also by modulating immune
response.8,30
In this population-based study of more than 21 000 pa-
tients spanning 24 years, initial surgery to the primary tumor
was associated with survival benefit. Women undergoing sur-
gery were younger and more likely to be married. This is con-
sistentwithareportdescribingbettercanceroutcomesformar-
ried patients, as they are generally thought to have stronger
support networks.31 However, the multivariate model con-
trolled for these imbalances, as well as year of diagnosis and
tumor size, and still found a significant and positive associa-
tion between surgery and survival. The hazard ratio reported
here is similar to those seen in other observational series.7-10
We also found that black women were disproportionately pre-
senting with stage IV disease compared with the general popu-
lation and invasive breast cancers. They were less likely to un-
dergo surgery and had poorer survival.
The absolute survival benefit observed for women with
small primary breast tumors is also consistent with a previous
meta-analysis.15Thismaysupporttheconceptthatsomewomen
withalowerdiseaseburdencouldhavegreaterbenefitfromsur-
gery. Additionally, women with larger tumors received sur-
gery less often. Presumably, many of these cancers were not
amenabletosurgery,suggestingthatthesewomenhadaheavier
localdiseaseburden.Theycouldhavehadmorechallenginglo-
cal control and may have done poorly on this basis. One obser-
vational series has associated local control with survival in the
metastatic setting.18 The overview by Clarke and colleagues32
reportedthatlocalcontrolintheadjuvantsettingimpactsover-
all survival after 15 years. Thus, the notion that local control in
the stage IV setting could impact survival is plausible.
Even so, the biology of breast cancer is heterogeneous.
Some patients may have a disease burden or disease biology
such that overall control, obtained through systemic therapy,
needs to be sought first. Results from a randomized clinical
trial, which presented early outcomes, showed that women
with aggressive disease consistently do worse with early lo-
cal therapy.12 Patients with multiple visceral metastases had
worse survival with initial surgery when compared with up-
front systemic therapy. If these women who may require pri-
mary systemic therapy to gain disease control were removed
from the analysis, would the benefit to others be still greater?
This body of work also leaves open the possibility that some
subtypes of breast cancer, perhaps those that are more immu-
nologically driven, may benefit from surgery. This would cor-
respond to the model seen in some other solid tumors.
On multivariate analysis, women who received initial lo-
cal therapy of surgery were more likely to survive 10 or more
years.Thiswasamorepowerfulpredictorthanage,tumorsize,
year of diagnosis, marital status, race/ethnicity, and tumor re-
ceptor status. However, SEER cannot account for many vari-
ables including use of ever-improving systemic therapies, so-
cial support, and access to care. It is possible that receiving
upfront surgery is a surrogate for these and other factors that
contribute to prolonged disease control.
Further limitations to this work include the caveats inher-
ent in large observational data sets. We excluded a large group
of patients who received radiation as initial course of therapy
because the anatomic site of radiation is unknown. Addition-
ally, the number and sites of metastases are not reported in
SEER, neither is detailed information on treatment and tim-
ing of staging. A subset of our cohort was likely upstaged dur-
ing surgery. For these patients, who presumably had a lower
burden of disease, the initial treatment decision was made un-
der the assumption of a lower stage. Information on the ex-
tent of surgical margins or regional lymph node surgery is also
not available; thus, it is not possible to determine whether the
observed benefit of surgery is heterogeneous for these sub-
groups. Finally, SEER includes palliative surgery as cancer-
directed surgery when cancer tissue is removed, and some
patients may have received palliative surgery for symptoms.
The inclusion of palliative surgical procedures would suggest
the reported OR associated with surgery is likely a lower bound
of the true estimate. Notably, we were unable to account for
hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy, both
with regard to their use and timing of delivery. Patients who
respond to systemic therapy may be identified as having more
controllable disease and subsequently receive surgery. Also,
our analysis of prolonged survival included only patients
diagnosed as having stage IV breast cancer prior to 2002. Since
then,therehavebeenmultipleadvancesinsystemictreatment.

Conclusions
This work will add to the body of evidence on these impor-
tant concepts in the care of women with advanced breast
cancer. Randomized clinical trials and prospectively
enrolled registries will be essential to understanding the
underlying causal relationship between our observed asso-
ciation of receipt of surgery and improved survival. A large
benefit for many women with stage IV breast cancer with
surgery to the intact primary tumor is unlikely, especially as
an ever-increasing array of more potent and targeted drugs
may be able to provide better control or even eradication of
systemic disease. However, systemic therapies cannot yet
manage all macroscopic disease fully. Hopefully, this time
will come. Until then, local therapy with surgery to the pri-
mary tumor may offer critical disease control for select
patients and could be an essential component of prolonged
survival.

Invited Commentary
Surgery for Stage IV Breast Cancer
Domestic and International Disparities
Lisa A. Newman, MD, MPH
Advances in systemic therapy have improved survival of
women with metastatic breast cancer. The Thomas et al1 analy-
sis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data
supports the concept that surgery may contribute to an out-
come advantage by reducing
the total body burden of dis-
ease. While this study’
s over-
archingfocusisindeedmean-
ingful, it is also informative to place results from this report
in the context of conversations regarding breast cancer dis-
parities associated with racial/ethnic identity, young age, and
country of origin.
First, lifetime incidence of breast cancer is lower for Afri-
can American compared with white American women; there-
fore, African American women account for a smaller propor-
tion of breast cancer cases compared with their general
population distribution. Thomas and colleagues1 found a dis-
proportionately high prevalence of African American women
among their stage IV study population, and African Ameri-
can women were also 30% less likely to undergo surgery. This
treatmentimbalanceraisesquestionsregardingselectionofpa-
tients that are triaged toward more aggressive care. Interest-
ingly, Park et al2 published a different analysis of SEER data,
demonstrating that treatment variables are likely just as im-
portant as disease stage and tumor biology in explaining breast
cancer survival improvements observed over the past several
decades. Unfortunately, one can infer from these 2 SEER-
based studies that inequities in the treatment offered to Afri-
can American women may contribute to their disproportion-
ately high breast cancer mortality risk.
Second, breast cancer incidence increases with age; how-
ever,thebreastcancerburdenofyoung/premenopausalwomen
generates substantial attention because of the associated im-
pact on a population subset that assumes much of the nation’
s
family and general workforce responsibilities. Furthermore,
while the population-based incidence rates of breast cancer in
women younger than 45 years have been stable over the past
severaldecades,weareindeedseeingalargernumberofyoung
patients with breast cancer because census data confirm that
this demographic has grown by nearly 10 million since 1980.3
Unfortunately,thepopulation-basedincidenceofstageIVbreast
cancer has doubled among young American women4 but hap-
pily,Thomasetal1 foundthatyoungerwomenweremorelikely
to undergo surgery, and age younger than 45 years was an in-
dependent predictor of prolonged survival.
Finally,regardinginternationalpopulations,2phase3trials
comparing surgery vs no surgery in metastatic breast cancer
were presented at the 2013 San Antonio Breast Cancer Sym-
posium, with neither demonstrating a survival advantage as-
sociated with surgery.5 Unfortunately, both of the these stud-
ies are subject to questions regarding their relevance in a more
affluentcountrysuchastheUnitedStates,wherepatientshave
improved access to advanced diagnostic and treatment op-
tions. For example, the trial conducted in India did not in-
cludeanti-HER2/neutherapyandtheTurkishtrialdidnotman-
date biopsy of the metastatic focus. Both of these strategies
are standard in the United States and influence survival.
It is difficult (if not impossible) to identify any breast can-
cer study that does not provide an opportunity to investigate
disparities in disease burden and outcome.
