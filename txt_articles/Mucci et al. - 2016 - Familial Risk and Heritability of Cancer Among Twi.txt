Abstract
Importance—Estimates of familial cancer risk from population-based studies are essential 
components of cancer risk prediction.
Objective—To estimate familial risk and heritability of cancer types in a large twin cohort.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Prospective study of 80 309 monozygotic and 123 382 
same-sex dizygotic twin individuals (N = 203 691) within the population-based registers of 
Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Twins were followed up a median of 32 years between 
1943 and 2010. There were 50 990 individuals who died of any cause, and 3804 who emigrated 
and were lost to follow-up.
Exposures—Shared environmental and heritable risk factors among pairs of twins.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The main outcome was incident cancer. Time-to-event 
analyses were used to estimate familial risk (risk of cancer in an individual given a twin's 
development of cancer) and heritability (proportion of variance in cancer risk due to 
interindividual genetic differences) with follow-up via cancer registries. Statistical models adjusted 
for age and follow-up time, and accounted for censoring and competing risk of death.
Results—A total of 27 156 incident cancers were diagnosed in 23 980 individuals, translating to 
a cumulative incidence of 32%. Cancer was diagnosed in both twins among 1383 monozygotic 
(2766 individuals) and 1933 dizygotic (2866 individuals) pairs. Of these, 38% of monozygotic and 
26% of dizygotic pairs were diagnosed with the same cancer type. There was an excess cancer risk 
in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with cancer, with estimated cumulative risks that were an 
absolute 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%) higher in dizygotic (37%; 95% CI, 36%-38%) and an absolute 
14% (95% CI, 12%-16%) higher in monozygotic twins (46%; 95% CI, 44%-48%) whose twin 
also developed cancer compared with the cumulative risk in the overall cohort (32%). For most 
cancer types, there were significant familial risks and the cumulative risks were higher in 
monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Heritability of cancer overall was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%). 
Significant heritability was observed for the cancer types of skin melanoma (58%; 95% CI, 
43%-73%), prostate (57%; 95% CI, 51%-63%), nonmelanoma skin (43%; 95% CI, 26%-59%), 
ovary (39%; 95% CI, 23%-55%), kidney (38%; 95% CI, 21%-55%), breast (31%; 95% CI, 
11%-51%), and corpus uteri (27%; 95% CI, 11%-43%).
Conclusions and Relevance—In this long-term follow-up study among Nordic twins, there 
was significant excess familial risk for cancer overall and for specific types of cancer, including

 prostate, melanoma, breast, ovary, and uterus. This information about hereditary risks of cancers 
may be helpful in patient education and cancer risk counseling.
The global burden of cancer is considerable, with an estimated 12 million new cases and 8 
million cancer deaths each year.1 In 2015 in the United States, 1.7 million individuals will 
be diagnosed with cancer and 590 000 will die of cancer, accounting for 1 in 4 deaths.2 In 
the Nordic countries, cancer is the leading cause of mortality, accounting for 30% of all 
deaths. Refinement of primary and secondary prevention strategies (ie, factors that would 
have the greatest influence on reducing cancer incidence and mortality) requires a detailed 
understanding of the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to disease 
pathogenesis.
Family-based studies have been helpful in describing familial aggregation of cancer.3-6 
Many inherited risk loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies; however, 
these known loci explain only a small proportion of the variability in cancer incidence. 
Large twin studies of cancer can provide further insight into the relative contribution of 
inherited factors and characterize familial cancer risk by leveraging the genetic relatedness 
of monozygotic and dizygotic pairs of twins.
A study in 2000 found significant estimates of heritability (ie, the proportion of variability in 
disease risk in a population due to genetic factors) of 42% for prostate cancer, 35% for 
colorectal cancer, and 27% for breast cancer among twins from Sweden, Denmark, and 
Finland.7 The confidence intervals around these heritability estimates were wide, and the 
estimates were not interpretable for other common cancers.
To address these limitations, we undertook an analysis within the Nordic Twin Study of 
Cancer (NorTwinCan), including twins from nationwide registers in Denmark, Finland, 
Norway, and Sweden followed up for an average of 32 years for cancer incidence and 
mortality. Statistical methods that take into account the potential statistical bias due to 
censoring and competing risk of death8 were used to estimate heritability and familial risk 
for specific types of cancer.
Methods
Study Population
The NorTwinCan study is an international, multidisciplinary collaboration of researchers 
working to investigate the genetic and environmental underpinnings of cancer.9 The cohort 
includes 357 377 individual twins from the population-based twin registers of Denmark, 
Finland, Norway, and Sweden and is composed of both monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic 
and opposite-sex dizygotic twins. In each country, the twin registries were assembled 
through the nationwide identification of twins across several birth cohorts.10-13
Twins were identified through a range of methods, including review of national birth 
registries, church parish records, and civil registration systems. For example, the twin 
registry in Denmark was assembled for4 birthcohorts during the study period of 1870 
through 2004. The first cohort from 1870 through 1930 was assembled retrospectively in the

 1950s through review of birth register records in each of the local parishes for which births 
were recorded.10
Subsequent birth cohorts in Denmark were identified through review of the civil registration 
system and national birth registry records. Nationwide coverage of twin registries ranges 
between 30% for the oldest birth cohort (from 1870-1930) and 70% for the birth cohort from 
1931 through 1952. Coverage was approximately 100% for later cohorts. The lower 
coverage in the earlier cohorts is due in large part to the fact that pairs of twins had to 
survive to the age of 6 years to be included in the registry.
Twin zygosity for same-sex pairs of twins is determined primarily by validated questionnaire 
methods that show a high degree of accuracy (>95% agreement with genetic markers; 
questionnaire given either to the twin member or a relative if twin diseased).14,15 We 
excluded data from 5376 twins with missing or inconsistent zygosity data. The ethical 
committees at each of the twin registries' host institutions approved this project.
Cohort Follow-up
Residents in Nordic countries each have a unique national registration number that allows 
for linkage of data from the Nordic twin register to national cancer registers for each 
country, mortality registers, and registers of the total population to glean outcome and vital 
status information (date of death or emigration) for each individual. For cancer diagnoses, 
we obtained data by linkage to the national cancer register in each country.
Physicians and pathologists are mandated by law to report every newly diagnosed malignant 
tumor in each of the 4 countries. In addition, the nationwide death registries send 
information to the cancer registry for individuals when the death certificate mentions cancer. 
Case reporting to each registry is close to 100% complete,16-19 the quality of the data are 
assessed through careful review, and all reports of cancer diagnosis are verified at national 
registries.
Cancer register data include diagnoses of cancer type classified according to the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10). For this study, we grouped the ICD-10 codes to categories defined in 
comparable ways across the cancer registries using the NORDCAN (a system designed for 
the standardization of cancer codes across the Nordic registries) classification of cancers.20
Cohort follow-up is initiated at the start of cancer registration in each country or at a later 
time for birth cohorts born after the start. For example, the cancer register in Denmark was 
initiated in January 1943. For twins born in the cohorts to 1930, follow-up began in 1943. 
For Danish twins born after 1943, follow-up began in 1968 at the time when the national 
registration number system was started. We have follow-up through the end of 2008 in 
Norway, 2009 in Denmark and Sweden, and 2010 in Finland. Details of the country-specific 
dates of start and end of follow-up are summarized in Table 1 and additional details are 
provided in Hjelmborg et al.9

 Statistical Methods
After combining cancers of the head and neck (ICD-10 codes OC 00-14), 36 cancer types 
remained. We present results for familial risk for 23 cancer types with more than 1 
concordant monozygotic and dizygotic pair, and heritability estimates for malignancies with 
at least 5 concordant pairs of twins. In a twin study, familial or concordance risk is defined 
as the risk of a specific cancer type in a twin, given that the co-twin was diagnosed with the 
same cancer. Comparing the conditional risk with the cumulative incidence in the population 
provides an estimate of the excess familial risk of a cancer.
In particular, dizygotic twins are as genetically alike as full siblings and thus familial risk 
among dizygotic twins can be generalized to siblings. Heritability is defined as the 
proportion of variance in cancer risk on the liability scale due to interindividual genetic 
differences in the population. For both familial risk and heritability, estimates are a function 
of follow-up time and the age of the cohort.
Individuals were followed up prospectively through the registries until cancer diagnosis, 
death or emigration during follow-up, or the end of the study. We defined the dates of entry 
and follow-up separately for each cohort depending on ascertainment procedures and data 
availability in each country (Table 1).
In statistical models, we accounted for left truncation from differing start dates of follow-up 
and right censoring for those censored at the end of follow-up, those censored when lost to 
follow-up due to emigration, or at competing risk of death. Cumulative risk of cancer was 
calculated using the nonparametric Aalen-Johansen estimator.13 We modeled potential 
competing deaths as described in Scheike et al,8 which accounted for competing causes in 
both the twin and co-twin.
We used quantitative genetic models to estimate the relative contribution of genetic and 
environmental factors with the variation in cancer risk. This approach assumes that there is a 
normally distributed liability to develop a genetically complex disease such as cancer. The 
probability that an individual will express the disease is modeled as a function of the latent 
unmeasured liability, and disease occurs only when an individual surpasses the threshold. 
This approach analyzes the disease covariance within monozygotic and dizygotic pairs and 
decomposes the variance into a sum of components: additive genetic effects (A), common 
environmental effects shared among twins (C), and individually unique environmental 
effects (E).
Within-pair covariance is expressed as κ × var(A)+var(C), where κ = 1 for monozygotic 
pairs because they share 100% of their genomes and κ = ½ for dizygotic pairs because they 
share on average half of their segregating genes. To test whether there is evidence of a 
genetic component for each of the cancer types, we compared the tetrachoric correlation for 
monozygotic and dizygotic twins in a model in which the marginal estimates were the same.
The biometric modeling approach is comparable with that of Lichtenstein et al,7 except that 
we adjusted for censoring by weighting individuals by the inverse probability of being 
censored at the time of follow-up using the same weights within pairs of twins.9 The

 probabilities of being censored were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by 
zygosity and country.
We similarly used the inverse probability of weighting to estimate the median difference in 
age at diagnosis for the pairs of twins concordant for cancer. All analyses were performed 
using the R mets package version 1.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Two-sided 
P values were used with an α level of less than .05.
Results
This analysis comprised 203 691 individual twins in the cohort, 80 309 monozygotic and 
123 382 same-sex dizygotic twins, of whom 104 251 were women (Table 1). During an 
average of 32 years of follow-up, we identified 27156 incident cancers among 23 980 
individuals. In addition, 50 990 individuals died of any cause and 3804 individual twins 
emigrated and were lost to follow-up.
Cancer was diagnosed in both twins among 1383 monozygotic (2766 individuals) and 1933 
dizygotic (2866 individuals) pairs. Of these, 38% of monozygotic pairs (n = 522) and 26% 
of dizygotic pairs (n = 496) were diagnosed with the same type of cancer.
The estimated cumulative incidence of cancer in the overall cohort and the familial risk 
among monozygotic and dizygotic twins appear in the Figure. The estimated cumulative 
incidence of cancer, accounting for competing causes of death, was8% by the age of 65 
years, 25% by the age of 80 years, and 32% by the age of 100 years using twins as 
individuals in a standard cohort analysis.
These risks are similar to the nationwide rates in the Nordic populations, showing 
representativeness of the twins. The lifetime familial risk of any cancer for those whose co-
twins were also diagnosed with cancer was 37% (95% CI, 36%-38%) among dizygotic pairs 
and 46% (95% CI, 44%-48%) among monozygotic pairs by the age of 100 years.
There was an excess cancer risk in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with cancer, with 
estimated cumulative risks that were an absolute 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%) higher in dizygotic 
(37%; 95% CI, 36%-38%) and an absolute 14% (95% CI, 12%-16%) higher in monozygotic 
twins (46%; 95% CI, 44%-48%) whose twin also developed cancer compared with the 
cumulative risk in the overall cohort (32%).
The types of cancers with the highest estimated cumulative incidence in the cohort were 
prostate (10.5%), breast (9.4%), lung (3.2%), nonmelanoma skin (1.9%), and colon (2.9%) 
(Table 2). There were elevated familial risks among monozygotic and dizygotic pairs of 
twins for most cancer types as indicated by the familial risk estimates compared with the 
cumulative incidence. These risks were substantially higher for monozygotic than dizygotic 
pairs for cancers of the prostate and breast.
Some of the strongest familial associations were observed for somewhat less common 
cancers. For testicular cancer, for which the cumulative risk in the cohort was 0.5%, the risk 
was substantially higher when his co-twin was also diagnosed with testicular cancer; for

 dizygotic twins, the familial risk estimate was 6% (95% CI, 2%-17%) and for monozygotic 
twins it was 14% (95% CI, 6%-30%) if his co-twin had previously been diagnosed with 
testicular cancer.
Familial cancer risk was also high for melanoma of the skin, with familial risks of 6% (95% 
CI, 3%-13%) for dizygotic twins and almost 20% (95% CI, 12%-31%) for monozygotic 
twins compared with a cumulative risk of 1.2% for the overall cohort. Familial risk of 
nonmelanoma skin cancer was also evident, although less than for melanoma. Familial risk 
of ovarian cancer for women whose twins also had ovarian cancer was similarly greater in 
monozygotic (9%; 95% CI, 4%-18%) than dizygotic (3%; 95% CI, 1%-7%) twins.
Results from the quantitative genetic modeling used to decompose the familial associations 
into the genetic and shared environmental components that affect twins the same way appear 
in Table 3 and in the eTable in the Supplement. The heritability for cancer overall was 33% 
(95% CI, 30%-37%), with no evidence of a shared environmental component.
A high estimate of heritability of 57% (95% CI, 51%-63%) was found for prostate cancer.9 
For breast cancer, 31% of variability may be associated with genetic factors and 16% with 
shared environmental factors. The strong familial effect noted for testicular cancer among 
monozygotic and dizygotic twins was associated with both significant genetic (37%) and 
shared environmental (24%) factors. Moreover, we found significant heritability estimates 
for cancer of the kidney (38%), skin melanoma (58%), and skin nonmela-noma (43%).
Lung cancer had one of the highest estimates for shared environmental factors (24%). 
Heritability estimates for gastrointestinal cancers of the colon (15%; 95% CI, 0%-45%), 
rectum (14%;95%CI, 0%-50%), and stomach (22%;0%-55%) were smaller relative to other 
malignancies.
Data on the median difference in age at diagnosis among concordant pairs of twins for 
selected cancer types appear in Table 4. For all cancer cases combined, the median age 
difference was slightly shorter in monozygotic pairs (8.0 years) than in dizygotic pairs (9.3 
years). With the exception of prostate cancer, none of these differences in median age 
differed between monozygotic and dizygotic pairs for 11 cancer types.
Discussion
This prospective Nordic twin cohort study provides familial risk estimates for cancer overall, 
for 23 types of cancer, and for relatively rare cancer types. Overall, there was a significantly 
excess familial risk of developing any cancer, 37% in dizygotic pairs and 46% in 
monozygotic pairs compared with 32% in the whole twin cohort. The data provide strong 
evidence of an excess familial risk for 20 of the 23 cancer types, as shown by the 
comparison of familial risks for those cancers with the cumulative risk in the twin cohort 
overall.
Testicular cancer and nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers showed substantial excess 
familial risks, particularly among monozygotic pairs. Although the excess familial risk for

 breast, prostate, and other cancer types were more modest, the absolute differences in risk 
were considerable.
These estimates of familial risk are in line with other family- and twin-based cohort 
studies.6,21 Precise estimates of familial cancer risk from population-based studies are 
essential components of accurate cancer risk prediction,22 and could be used in clinical 
practice to guide genetic counseling. Dizygotic pairs of twins are as genetically similar as 
siblings.
As such, familial risk estimates among dizygotic pairs are relevant for siblings who are born 
at separate times. Risk estimates among monozygotic pairs (who share nearly 100% of their 
inherited genomes) can be used to derive an upper bound on the ability of genetic studies to 
discriminate individuals who will experience different disease outcomes.23
Shared environmental factors can include parental factors, such as socioeconomic status, 
lifestyle, and occupation and experiences and exposures shared by siblings during childhood 
and adolescence, and screening patterns in adult life. For many cancer types, we did not 
observe evidence of shared environmental associations, even though our models specifically 
allowed for estimation of these environmental factors that members of a family share.
Lung cancer had one of the highest shared environmental components, likely due to shared 
smoking habits of pairs of twins. Testicular and breast cancer also had significant estimates 
of shared environment, which may reflect in part the hypothesized in utero origins of these 
cancer types.24,25 It is possible that the shared environment components may be somewhat 
higher in twins than the estimates expected for siblings because twins may share a more 
similar child-raising experience.
Most pairs of twins were discordant for a specific cancer. Indeed, among the pairs of twins 
in which both members developed cancer, more than two-thirds were diagnosed with a 
different malignancy. This finding of familial aggregation across different cancer types is in 
line with data from an Icelandic family-based study that showed excess familial aggregation 
among 17 different cancer types.26
There are novel insights from genetic epidemiology studies suggesting pleiotropy of genetic 
variants across multiple cancer types.27,28 A more detailed investigation of shared familial 
risk across cancer types may provide key insights into the underlying cancer susceptibility.
Twin studies can provide context for genome-wide association studies, many of which have 
identified multiple risk loci for cancer incidence.29-32 Estimates of heritability in twin 
studies, as well as those derived from genome-wide association studies, allow for the 
calculation of the extent to which cancer variability is explained by established genetic risk 
loci. For prostate cancer, the 100 risk loci identified to date explain approximately one-third 
of the genetic contribution.33,34 For breast cancer, the estimated proportion of heritability 
explained by the known genetic risk loci may approach up to 30%.35
Few genome-wide association studies of more rare cancers have been undertaken, but our 
data suggest that such studies may be essential in elucidating the etiology of certain cancer

 types, such as melanoma, ovarian, kidney, and testicular. A recent analysis of genome-wide 
association studies for 13 cancer types suggests that the identified genetic variants for most 
cancer types do not explain the majority of heritability.36 Moreover, the heritability estimate 
of 33% for developing any cancer type suggests there are shared genomic regions associated 
with multiple cancer types. The results from 2 family-based studies are also in line with this 
observation.37,38 A systematic genome-wide association study of individuals with any 
cancer compared with controls free of any cancer may be a powerful and feasible approach 
to identify novel loci given that multiple cancer type–specific data sets already exist.
The concept of heritability has its limitations39 and is often misinterpreted as an estimate of 
population-attributable risk. Heritability can be thought of as the proportion of the variation 
in cancer risk in a population that can be accounted for by interindividual genetic 
differences.
A high estimate of heritability for cancer does not translate to a low population-attributable 
risk associated with lifestyle and environmental factors, nor does a high heritability exclude 
the possibility of an effective preventive action. The observed genetic estimates based on 
family relationships for specific cancer types are due to both cancer-specific genetics and 
genetic contributions to cancer risk factors, such as obesity and smoking, which have a 
genetic component.
The interval between diagnosis of cancer among concordant pairs of twins was fairly long. 
The median time between cancer diagnoses in concordant pairs of twins ranged from 4 to 15 
years. The difference in pairs of twins with any cancer was similar to the specific numbers 
for cancer type.
These data suggest that there maybe unique environmental factors that influence the timing 
of disease development or diagnosis. Moreover, cancer likely involves stochastic processes 
inherent in the carcinogenic process that may ultimately influence the timing of cancer 
initiation and diagnosis.
Our study has some strengths and limitations to consider in interpreting the study results. To 
our knowledge, this is the largest familial study of cancer to date and includes more than 3 
decades of follow-up. In prior studies, the number of concordant pairs with cancer was 
small, leading to imprecise estimates of familial risk and heritability for common cancer 
types and uninterpretable estimates of heritability for less common cancer types. The large 
number of cancer cases and long follow-up in the cohort allowed us to provide more precise 
estimates of familial risk and heritability for several malignancies.
Not with standing the large size of the cohort and long-term follow-up, we were unable to 
provide estimates of familial risk or heritability for some of the more rare cancer types, 
including many of the hematological malignancies. The linkage with national population-
based registers and the high quality of cancer case registration allowed for complete follow-
up of the study population.
The study is based on twins from the Nordic countries, primarily a white population. For the 
majority of cancer types, the cumulative incidence of cancer in the twin cohort was similar

 to that of the entire country, suggesting these data can be generalized to the Nordic 
countries. However, it is unclear the extent to which these data can be generalized to 
multiethnic populations.
Given the older age at which many cancer types occur, long-term follow-up provides greater 
clarity on estimates of familial risk and heritability by allowing the cohort to attain sufficient 
age at which most cancer types occur. On a related note, some individuals at risk of 
developing cancer may also be at higher risk of dying from another chronic condition, thus 
influencing the estimates.
Our statistical approach addressed this challenge and accounted for differential follow-up 
time, censoring, and competing causes of death. The twin modeling estimates of heritability 
assume that there are similar shared environments between monozygotic and dizygotic pairs 
of twins, which cannot be formally tested in this setting.
Conclusions
In this long-term follow-up study among Nordic twins, there was significant excess familial 
risk for cancer overall and for specific types of cancer, including prostate, melanoma, breast, 
ovary, and uterus. This information about hereditary risks of cancers may be helpful in 
patient education and cancer risk counseling.

 Figure. Cumulative Incidence and Familial Risk of Developing Any Cancer Over Time in the 
NorTwinCan Cohort
The cumulative incidence is the risk of developing a first cancer over time within the full 
twin cohort, and the estimate is adjusted for censoring and competing risks of death. 
Familial risk is defined as the risk of developing any cancer given the twin's co-twin also 
developed cancer. At the start of follow-up, there were 79 980 individual monozygotic twins 
and 122 888 individual dizygotic twins in the risk set. The extent to which the estimate of 
familial risk is higher than the cumulative incidence gives a sense of the magnitude of excess 
risk that may be associated with familial factors. Shaded areas indicate 95% confidence 
intervals; NorTwinCan, Nordic Twin Study of Cancer.
