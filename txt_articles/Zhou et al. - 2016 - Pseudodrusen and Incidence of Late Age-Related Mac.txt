Abstract
Purpose—To evaluate the association between pseudodrusen and incidence of late age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) in fellow eyes of patients with unilateral neovascular AMD 
(nAMD).
Design—Cohort study within the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT).
Participants—Patients with neither nAMD nor geographic atrophy (GA) in the fellow eye at 
baseline.
Methods—Presence and type (dot, reticular, or confluent) of baseline pseudodrusen were 
assessed using digital color fundus photography (CFP) viewed under full color, green channel, and 
blue channel; red-free images; and fluorescein angiography (FA). Incidence of nAMD was based 
on monthly clinical examination and reading center evaluation of images at years 1 and 2. 
Incidence of GA was based on reading center evaluation of CFP and FA images at years 1 and 2. 
Associations of baseline pseudodrusen with incident nAMD and GA were summarized with

 adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariate Cox 
models, with adjustment of covariates identified through backward stepwise selection.
Main Outcome Measures—Incident nAMD and GA.
Results—Among 620 fellow eyes, 176 (28.4%) had baseline pseudodrusen (55% dot, 82% 
reticular, 35% confluent). Within 2 years, nAMD occurred in 54 eyes (30.7%) with pseudodrusen 
and in 72 eyes (16.2%) without pseudodrusen (aRR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.43–2.93); GA occurred in 27 
eyes (15.3%) with pseudodrusen and in 37 eyes (8.3%) without pseudodrusen (aRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 
1.13–3.17); late AMD occurred in 73 eyes (41.5%) with pseudodrusen and in 101 eyes (22.8%) 
without pseudodrusen (aRR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.51–2.83). Dot pseudodrusen were associated 
independently with nAMD (aRR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.60–4.00), whereas confluent pseudodrusen were 
associated independently with GA (aRR, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.69–11.2). Eyes with pseudodrusen had 
increased incidence of late AMD regardless of whether the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study 
(AREDS) severity score was 2 (28.7% vs. 10.3%), 3 (34.9% vs. 13.7%), or 4 (50.5% vs. 32.0%).
Conclusions—In fellow eyes of CATT participants, pseudodrusen were associated 
independently with a higher incidence of both nAMD and GA. Dot pseudodrusen were associated 
with nAMD, whereas confluent pseudodrusen were associated with GA. Pseudodrusen should be 
considered along with the AREDS severity score for predicting late AMD.
Pseudodrusen were reported first by Mimoun et al1 in 1990 as a special type of drusen in the 
macula of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Later, the terms reticular 
drusen, reticular pseudodrusen, reticular macular disease or reticular macular lesions, and 
subretinal drusenoid deposits were used to describe this type of drusen.2–8 Population-based 
studies, such as the Beaver Dam Eye Study and the Blue Mountains Eye Study, found that 
eyes with early AMD features and pseudodrusen demonstrated on color fundus photography 
(CFP) were 4 to 6 times more likely to progress to late AMD within 5 years when matched 
to eyes without pseudodrusen but with otherwise similar early AMD features.9–11 Several 
clinical studies also have demonstrated a strong association between pseudodrusen and the 
development of late AMD.3,7,8,12–14 However, the specific association of pseudodrusen with 
neovascular AMD (nAMD) or with geographic atrophy (GA) is not clear because these 
studies were limited by a small number of incident cases.
It is well known that when nAMD is present in one eye, the fellow eye is at high risk of 
demonstrating late AMD.15–17 A meta-analysis provided incidence estimates for nAMD in 
the fellow eye of 12.2% by 1 year after nAMD detection in the first eye and of 26.8% by 4 
years.18 These estimates are much higher than the estimates of the annual incidence of 
0.57% to 1.13% in white Americans 75 to 84 years of age.19 This elevated risk is 
independent of treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab for nAMD.20 A few clinical 
studies with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 271 patients have evaluated the association of 
pseudodrusen with development of nAMD and GA in the fellow eye of patients with 
unilateral nAMD.21–25 However, the conclusions from these studies were inconsistent, most 
likely because of small numbers of incident cases of nAMD and GA and differences in the 
imaging methods used to detect pseudodrusen.
The Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT) provided 
a large cohort of patients with nAMD in the study eye treated with randomly assigned

 ranibizumab or bevacizumab through 2 years.26,27 This well-characterized cohort provided a 
unique opportunity to evaluate the association of pseudodrusen with incidence of nAMD and 
GA in the fellow eye of patients with unilateral nAMD.
Methods
Details on the CATT study design and methods have been reported in our previous 
publications20,26,27 and at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier, NCT00593450). Only features 
relevant to the evaluation of pseudodrusen at baseline and assessment of nAMD and GA in 
the fellow eye are noted here.
Study Participants
Participants were enrolled from 43 clinical centers in the United States between February 
2008 and December 2009. The study enrollment criteria included age of 50 years or older, 
untreated active neovascularization resulting from AMD in the study eye (1 eye per 
participant), and visual acuity between 20/25 and 20/320 on electronic visual acuity testing. 
Active neovascularization was defined by the presence of leakage on fluorescein 
angiography (FA) and fluid on time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The 
study was approved by an institutional review board associated with each center. All patients 
provided written informed consent.
At enrollment, participants provided information on demographic characteristics and 
medical history, including a history of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Participants 
were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatment groups: (1) ranibizumab monthly, (2) bevacizumab 
monthly, (3) ranibizumab as needed (pro re nata [PRN]), and (4) bevacizumab PRN. At 1 
year, participants initially assigned to monthly treatment retained their drug assignment, but 
were reassigned randomly to either monthly or PRN treatment. Participants initially 
assigned to PRN treatment retained both their drug and regimen for year 2.
Study Procedures
At enrollment, patients were examined by study-certified retina specialists. The retina 
specialist indicated whether there was a history of nAMD or active nAMD in the fellow eye. 
Patients underwent bilateral stereoscopic CFP, red-free (RF) imaging, and FA that included 
stereo images of the macula of the fellow eye at 2 and 10 minutes after dye injection. 
Follow-up examinations for both the study eye and the fellow eye were scheduled every 28 
days for 2 years. During each examination, the study retina specialist completed case report 
forms with specific questions regarding whether there had been any treatment for nAMD in 
the fellow eye since the last CATT examination or whether treatment was scheduled on the 
day of the examination. At years 1 and 2, CFP and FA also were performed in both study 
eyes and fellow eyes. Certified graders at the CATT Fundus Photograph Reading Center 
reviewed images acquired at baseline and years 1 and 2 for nAMD morphologic features in 
the study eye and the presence of nAMD, GA, and scar in the fellow eye.28 The presence of 
large drusen (>125 μm) and pigment abnormalities (hyperpigmentation or depigmentation) 
at baseline in the fellow eye also were graded.

 Patients were included in this study if the fellow eye did not have any evidence of 
neovascularization, scar, or GA at baseline on either clinical examination or image 
evaluation by the reading center using CFP and FA. Incident nAMD in the fellow eye was 
considered present at the earliest follow-up visit when the examining retina specialist 
indicated that treatment for nAMD in the fellow eye had occurred since the last study 
examination or would occur on the day of the study visit. In addition, eyes confirmed to have 
leakage on FA or a new scar on CFP at years 1 or 2 by the Director of the Fundus 
Photograph Reading Center (E.D.) were classified as having nAMD. Incident GA was 
identified from reading center evaluation of images from year 1 or 2. The diagnosis of GA 
required the presence within the macular vascular arcades of 1 or more patch of 250 μm or 
more in longest linear dimension of partial or complete depigmentation on the CFP that had 
1 or more of these additional characteristics: sharply demarcated borders seen on CFP, FA, 
or both; visibility of underlying choroidal vessels; excavated or punched out appearance on 
stereoscopy of CFP or FA; or uniform hyperfluorescence bounded by sharp borders on late-
phase angiography.29
Pseudodrusen Evaluation
Baseline digital CFP images from fellow eyes of CATT participants were evaluated for the 
presence and type of pseudodrusen by one of the authors (Q.Z.), who was masked to the 
status of late AMD during follow-up. To enhance the visibility of pseudodrusen, CFP images 
were reviewed with full color, only the green channel, or only the blue channel in Photoshop 
(Photoshop CS6, version 13.0; Adobe System, Inc., San Jose, CA). Pseudodrusen usually 
are more visible when viewing CFP images with the green or blue channel than in full color.
2,8 In Photoshop, the command “Channels” was used to display channels for each color (red, 
green, and blue) plus a composite channel (i.e., original image) of the RGB (full-color) 
image. If needed, adjustment of brightness and contrast was made to improve the view of 
pseudodrusen. Besides the CFP, digital RF fundus photographs also were used to aid in the 
detection of pseudodrusen that were not clearly apparent when viewing CFPs. In addition, 
FA images were used to distinguish pseudodrusen from other drusen (soft, hard, or cuticular 
drusen). We graded the presence of pseudodrusen (none, questionable, yes) and the type of 
pseudodrusen (dot, reticular, and confluent; Figs 1, 2, and 3). When the presence of 
pseudodrusen was questionable, the consensus results after review with the Director of the 
Fundus Photograph Reading Center (E.D.) and a senior certified grader (R.M.) were used for 
data analysis.
Our definition of pseudodrusen on CFP was based primarily on 2 previous studies.30,31 In 
full-color and green- or blue-channel viewing of CFP images, pseudodrusen were considered 
to be present if 5 or more drusen were brighter in the green or blue channel than in full color 
(Figs 1A, 2A, and 3A).2,13,32 The method to determine the presence of pseudodrusen on RF 
images was similar to that on green- or blue-channel images (Figs 1B, 2B, and 3B). On FA, 
pseudodrusen are different from regular drusen in that pseudodrusen are not visible in the 
early phase and generally are not visible in the middle and late phases (Figs 1E, F; 2E, F; 
and 3E, F)1,7,8,12,33–35 or show only faint fluorescence in the late phase.3,36 In contrast, 
regular drusen usually are hyperfluorescent in the early phase and stain in the late phase (Fig 
1E, F).

 Based on the pseudodrusen features on CFP, pseudodrusen were classified further as dot, 
reticular, and confluent.30,31 Dot pseudodrusen appear as discrete, round to oval dots with 
areas between dot pseudodrusen exhibiting no marked changes (Fig 1A). Reticular 
pseudodrusen form a complex network of curvilinear lesions or interlocking ribbons, with 
areas between reticular pseudodrusen exhibiting no marked changes (Fig 2A). Confluent 
pseudodrusen are lesions that appear merged or running together (Fig 3A). Dot and reticular 
pseudodrusen can be present separately or together, whereas confluent pseudodrusen are 
almost always present with dot or reticular pseudodrusen.
Quality Assurance
We randomly selected 60 fellow eyes to evaluate intergrader and intragrader agreement for 
grading presence and type of pseudodrusen. All images of the selected fellow eyes were 
graded and regraded by the grader (Q.Z.) at an interval of approximately 2 months. In 
addition, the selected images also were graded by a certified senior grader (R.M.) in the 
CATT Fundus Photograph Reading Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The results for 
intragrader and intergrader agreement are reported in Table 1 (available at 
www.aaojournal.org). The presence of any pseudodrusen had good intragrader agreement 
(95% agreement; weighted κ, 0.89) and intergrader agreement (83% agreement; weighted κ, 
0.59). Presence of each type of pseudodrusen had similar intragrader agreement (90%–92% 
agreement; weighted κ, 0.79–0.84) and intergrader agreement (77%–80% agreement; 
weighted κ, 0.54–0.61).
Statistical Analyses
The characteristics of participants with or without baseline pseudodrusen in the fellow eye 
were compared using the t test for means and the Fisher exact test for proportions. The Age-
Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) severity score was calculated by adding for each eye 1 
point for any large druse, 1 point for any pigment abnormality (hyperpigmentation or 
depigmentation), and 2 points for late AMD.17 Because the study eye already had nAMD at 
baseline, the AREDS score of CATT participants at baseline was either 2, 3, or 4. The 
associations between presence of pseudodrusen or type of pseudodrusen at baseline and the 
incidence of nAMD, GA, or late AMD (nAMD, GA, or both) in the fellow eye in 2 years 
were assessed using risk ratios (RRs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from 
univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. In the multivariate Cox regression 
models, we started with the model that included age, gender, drug, dosing regimen, smoking 
status, diabetes, hypertension, dietary supplement use, and the AREDS severity score. 
Backward stepwise selection of covariates was applied, and the final multivariate Cox model 
included only the statistically significant covariates. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
estimate the cumulative incidence of nAMD, GA, and late AMD in fellow eyes by baseline 
pseudodrusen status and was stratified by baseline AREDS severity score. For the analyses 
involving types of pseudodrusen, indicator variables for each type of pseudodrusen, that is, 
dot pseudodrusen (yes or no), reticular pseudodrusen (yes or no), and confluent 
pseudodrusen (yes or no), were included in the same multivariate model to evaluate the 
independent association of each type of pseudodrusen with nAMD, GA, and late AMD. All 
statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, NC).

 Results
Among 1185 CATT subjects, 458 fellow eyes had nAMD, 74 had GA at baseline, and 33 
eyes had insufficient image quality for pseudodrusen evaluation, leaving 620 CATT 
participants (52.3%) eligible for this analysis (Fig 4, available at www.aaojournal.org). 
Among the 620 patients, 176 (28.4%) had pseudodrusen in the fellow eye at baseline. Table 
2 shows the comparison of patient characteristics for fellow eyes with baseline pseudodrusen 
with those without pseudodrusen. Patients with pseudodrusen were older (mean age, 81.3 
years vs. 76.9 years; P < 0.0001) and were more likely to be women (79.0% vs. 53.4%; P < 
0.0001), less likely to be a former or current smoker (48.9% vs. 64.4%; P = 0.002), and less 
likely to be diabetic (13.6% vs. 20.7%; P = 0.04). There were no differences in reported 
history of cardiovascular diseases (P = 0.56), hypertension (P = 0.70), or dietary 
supplements (P = 0.23). The proportions in the group with pseudodrusen and the group 
without pseudodrusen were similar for large drusen (68.2% vs. 72.3%; P = 0.31) and for an 
AREDS severity score of 4 (61.9% vs. 61.0%; P = 0.16), but the proportion with 
hyperpigmentation was higher in eyes with pseudodrusen than eyes without pseudodrusen 
(84.7% vs. 74.8%; P = 0.008).
Among the 176 eyes with pseudodrusen, 96 (54.5%) had dot pseudodrusen, 145 (82.4%) had 
reticular pseudodrusen, and 61 (34.7%) had confluent pseudodrusen. Two or more types of 
pseudodrusen were present 104 eyes (59%). Among the 96 eyes with dot pseudodrusen, 44 
(45.8%) also had reticular pseudodrusen, 2 (2.0%) also had confluent pseudodrusen, and 22 
(22.9%) had all 3 types. Among the 69 eyes with confluent pseudodrusen, 36 (59.0%) also 
had reticular pseudodrusen, 2 (2.9%) also had dot pseudodrusen, and 22 (31.9%) had all 3 
types.
During the 2-year follow-up, nAMD developed in 126 fellow eyes (20.3%) and GA 
developed in 64 fellow eyes (10.3%); thus, late AMD (nAMD, GA, or both) developed in a 
total of 174 eyes (28.1%). Among 16 eyes in which both nAMD and GA developed, GA was 
observed in 12 eyes (75%) at the same visit or a later visit when nAMD was first observed or 
treated.
During the 2-year follow-up, nAMD developed in 54 fellow eyes (30.7%) with 
pseudodrusen and 72 fellow eyes (16.2%) without pseudodrusen. The cumulative incidence 
of nAMD during 2-year follow-up is shown in Figure 5. On univariate analysis, the presence 
of baseline pseudodrusen was associated significantly with a higher risk of nAMD 
developing (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48–3.00; P < 0.0001; Table 3). This association persisted 
(adjusted RR [aRR], 2.20; 95% CI, 1.51–3.19; P < 0.0001) after adjustment for the 
significant covariates (i.e., AREDS severity score [P = 0.02] and use of dietary supplements 
[P = 0.03]). In the multivariate analyses adjusted by AREDS severity score and use of 
dietary supplements, both dot pseudodrusen (aRR, 2.74; P < 0.0001) and reticular 
pseudodrusen (aRR, 1.71; P = 0.005) were associated with nAMD (Table 3, middle 
columns). However, when all 3 types of pseudodrusen were considered simultaneously in a 
multivariate model adjusted by AREDS severity score and use of dietary supplements, only 
dot pseudodrusen were associated independently with nAMD (aRR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.60–
4.00; P < 0.0001; Table 3, right columns).

 During the 2-year follow-up, GA developed in 27 fellow eyes (15.3%) with pseudodrusen 
and in 37 fellow eyes (8.3%) without pseudodrusen (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.15–3.11; P = 0.01; 
Table 3). After adjustment for the significant covariate (i.e., AREDS severity score [P = 
0.004]), the association persisted (aRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.13–3.17; P = 0.02). In the 
multivariate analyses adjusted by AREDS severity score, both reticular pseudodrusen (aRR, 
1.81; P = 0.03) and confluent pseudodrusen (aRR, 3.60; P < 0.0001) were associated with 
GA (Table 3, middle columns). However, when all 3 types of pseudodrusen were considered 
simultaneously in a multivariate model, only confluent pseudodrusen were associated 
independently with GA (aRR, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.69–11.2; P = 0.002; Table 3, right columns).
When eyes with nAMD and GA were considered together for the development of late AMD, 
fellow eyes with pseudodrusen had a higher risk of late AMD developing (aRR, 2.07; 95% 
CI, 1.51–2.83; P < 0.0001; Table 3) after adjustment for AREDS severity score (P < 0.0001) 
and use of dietary supplements (P = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis adjusted by AREDS 
severity score and use of dietary supplements, dot pseudodrusen (aRR, 2.12; P < 0.0001), 
reticular pseudodrusen (aRR, 1.74; P = 0.0009), and confluent pseudodrusen (aRR, 2.15; P < 
0.0001) all were associated significantly with late AMD (Table 3, middle columns). When 
all 3 types of pseudodrusen were considered simultaneously in a multivariate model, dot 
pseudodrusen (aRR, 1.76; P = 0.009) were associated significantly with late AMD, and 
confluent pseudodrusen (aRR, 1.64; P = 0.07; Table 3) were associated marginally with late 
AMD.
Most CATT participants (89.7%) had a baseline AREDS score of 3 or 4. An increased 
incidence of nAMD, GA, and late AMD associated with pseudodrusen was seen across each 
level of AREDS severity score (Table 4, available at www.aaojournal.org). In patients with 
an AREDS severity score of 3, the cumulative incidence of late AMD was 34.9% for fellow 
eyes with pseudodrusen and 13.7% for eyes without pseudodrusen. For patients with an 
AREDS severity score of 4, the cumulative incidence of late AMD was 50.5% for fellow 
eyes with pseudodrusen and 32.0% for eyes without pseudodrusen at baseline. The Kaplan-
Meier curves showed higher risk of nAMD (Fig 6), GA (Fig 7, available at 
www.aaojournal.org), and late AMD (Fig 8, available at www.aaojournal.org) developing 
over 2 years in fellow eyes with pseudodrusen than in those without pseudodrusen with an 
AREDS score of 3 or 4. Baseline pseudodrusen improves the prediction of late AMD; the 
area under receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.64 (predicted by AREDS 
severity score and dietary supplement use) to 0.68 (P = 0.004) when baseline pseudodrusen 
was added into the prediction model.
Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of pseudodrusen as ascertained from CFP and FA 
and the association of pseudodrusen with incidence of nAMD and of GA in the fellow eye of 
CATT participants with unilateral baseline nAMD. We found that more than one fourth of 
fellow eyes had pseudodrusen at baseline, and fellow eyes with baseline pseudodrusen had 
an approximately 2 times higher incidence of nAMD and GA than those without 
pseudodrusen. The analyses suggest that dot pseudodrusen had the strongest association 
with nAMD, whereas confluent pseudodrusen had the strongest association with GA. The

 risk conferred by pseudodrusen was incremental to the risk of late AMD developing 
associated with each AREDS severity level, implying that pseudodrusen should be 
considered as another independent predictor along with large drusen and pigment 
abnormalities.
Pseudodrusen in this study were detected using the digital CFP images viewed under full 
color, blue channel only, and green channel only, supplemented by the RF image and FA. 
Use of at least 2 imaging methods has been recommended for accurate detection, with 
spectral-domain (SD) OCT and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy being the most 
sensitive and specific image methods for pseudodrusen detection.37,38 At enrollment for 
CATT (between February 2008 and December 2009), time-domain OCT images were 
obtained because SD OCT was not yet available to most of the participating clinical centers. 
Although standard full-color viewing of CFP has been reported to have the lowest sensitivity 
for detection of pseudodrusen (36%),23,38 viewing digital CFP images with the green or blue 
channels and RF photographs improves pseudodrusen detection. Smith et al8 reported that 
CFP images viewed in the green and blue channels had a sensitivity of 88% to detect 
pseudodrusen when compared with indocyanine green angiography. Similarly, Ueda-
Arakawa et al37 reported 76% sensitivity and 100% specificity when pseudodrusen were 
viewed on images with the blue channel. Pseudodrusen were detected with 100% specificity 
on RF images, although with lower sensitivity (48%) than on other imaging methods (blue 
light autofluorescence, infrared photography, and SD OCT).23 Spaide and Curcio32 
speculated that the reason pseudodrusen are more visible in blue light is that pseudodrusen 
are on the top of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and therefore do not have any blue 
light attenuation from the RPE. In contrast, regular drusen are below the RPE. Our study 
also used FA to distinguish pseudodrusen from other drusen (soft, hard, or cuticular drusen) 
based on the property that pseudodrusen are not visible in the early phase and generally are 
not visible in the middle and late phases, although they sometimes show faint fluorescence 
in the late phase. The absence of pseudodrusen on FA (especially in the early phase) has 
been reported in several previous studies.1,7,8,12,33–35 Rudolf et al34 proposed that the RPE 
acts as an intact outer blood–retinal barrier to prevent absorption of fluorescein; thus, 
pseudodrusen lying over the RPE are not visible on FA, whereas drusen under the RPE are 
stained by fluorescein. All of these findings suggest that the imaging methods (CFP images 
in full-color view or viewed in green or blue channels, RF imaging, and FA) used in this 
study correctly identified most pseudodrusen and did not incorrectly identify other retinal 
abnormalities as pseudodrusen.
In recent years, a few cohort studies have evaluated the association of pseudodrusen with the 
incidence of late AMD in the fellow eye of patients with unilateral nAMD.21–25 In the first 
study by Pumariega et al,21 pseudodrusen were associated with increased risk of both 
nAMD (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.4) and GA (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6). In a more recent 
study by Finger et al,22 pseudodrusen in the fellow eye at baseline were associated with only 
increased risk of GA (RR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.1–22.9), and were not associated with nAMD 
(RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–1.9). However, Hogg et al23 found that pseudodrusen were associated 
significantly with nAMD (RR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.1–28.8), but no strong conclusions could be 
reached regarding the association with GA because only 5 cases were detected. Two other 
studies from Asia concluded that pseudodrusen were associated significantly with nAMD.

 24,25 In our study, which had the largest sample size, we found that pseudodrusen in the 
fellow eye are associated significantly with an approximately 2 times higher risk of both 
nAMD and GA than those eyes without pseudodrusen. These results were consistent with 
previous studies for nAMD,21,23–25 GA,21,22 and late AMD,21,23 respectively.
In contrast to previous cohort studies of pseudodrusen in the fellow eye, our study classified 
pseudodrusen into 3 types (dot, reticular, and confluent). Among 176 eyes with 
pseudodrusen, approximately 55% had dot pseudodrusen, 82% had reticular pseudodrusen, 
and 35% had confluent pseudodrusen. In 2012, Lee et al31 first classified pseudodrusen into 
3 types (discrete, branching, and confluent) based on their appearance on CFP. Suzuki et al30 
later proposed another classification based on CFP and infrared scanning laser 
ophthalmoscopy that classified pseudodrusen into dot, ribbon, and peripheral pseudodrusen. 
In the classification by Suzuki et al, the dot pattern was similar to the discrete pattern and the 
ribbon pattern was similar to branching or reticular pseudodrusen. Suzuki et al also 
mentioned another uncommon type, peripheral pseudodrusen, which are located primarily 
peripheral to the perifoveal region, outside the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
grid.30 In our study, we found only 3 fellow eyes with peripheral pseudodrusen located 
outside the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid (Fig 9, available at 
www.aaojournal.org). Suzuki et al30 also observed that dot pseudodrusen had a bulls-eye 
target configuration on infrared scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. We found a similar 
appearance on CFP for dot pseudodrusen, which typically were surrounded by a dark halo 
(Fig 10, available at www.aaojournal.org). This feature is more visible when viewing images 
in the green or blue channels and RF images than when viewing them with full color on 
CFP. We used this feature as one of the characteristics to distinguish dot pseudodrusen from 
regular drusen.
Our study is unique in that it evaluated the association of each type of pseudodrusen (dot, 
reticular, and confluent) with late AMD. We found that dot pseudodrusen were associated 
independently with an approximately 3-fold increased risk for development of nAMD, 
whereas confluent pseudodrusen were associated independently with a 4-fold increased risk 
for development of GA when all 3 types of pseudodrusen were considered simultaneously 
along with the AREDS severity score in a multivariate model. Although reticular 
pseudodrusen were associated significantly with nAMD in a multivariate model without 
adjustment for the other 2 types of pseudodrusen, the association became weaker after 
adjustment for dot and confluent pseudodrusen. Similarly, reticular pseudodrusen were 
associated significantly with GA in a multivariate model without adjustment for the other 2 
types of pseudodrusen; however, the association became weaker after adjustment for dot and 
confluent pseudodrusen. The fact that the association between reticular pseudodrusen and 
late AMD became weaker when adjusted for the presence of the other 2 types of 
pseudodrusen suggests that these other 2 types may be the strongest risk factors. Our 
findings on the independent association of confluent pseudodrusen with GA are consistent 
with the findings of Lee et al, who found that eyes with confluent pseudodrusen had a 
significantly higher prevalence of GA and speculated that the pseudodrusen were a 
progressive disease from initial localized dot pseudodrusen to final confluent pseudodrusen.
31 Our results also validated the speculation of Suzuki et al30 that different pseudodrusen 
types may result in different risks of progression to late AMD. Based on the different

 appearance in various imaging methods, it may be that different types of pseudodrusen result 
from different pathogenic mechanisms and may signal different processes in the 
development of nAMD and GA.30
Although the exact mechanism for the association of pseudodrusen with nAMD and GA is 
not known, pseudodrusen are related to lower choroidal thickness,39–44 which may result in 
decreased choroidal perfusion and subsequently ischemia of choroid and retina,7 and 
eventually induce choroidal and retinal neovascularization. Pseudodrusen are derived from 
RPE cells and contain some components of drusen, but not all.34 The presence of either 
pseudodrusen or drusen may indicate a disorder in the transport mechanism of the RPE that 
results in overproduction of secretions that may be inflammatory or toxic.45 These secretions 
may damage adjacent RPE cells, leading to the death of dysfunctional RPE cells and the 
development of GA. Suzuki et al30 speculated that dot and reticular (ribbon) pseudodrusen 
are different types rather than one being a more advanced version of the other; however, both 
types can become confluent. Thus, confluent pseudodrusen seem to be the advanced version 
of dot pseudodrusen and reticular pseudodrusen. Confluent pseudodrusen, with larger lesion 
area and more drusenoid material than dot and reticular pseudodrusen, may be associated 
with more dysfunctional RPE cells and also may cause more damage to RPE cells, 
eventually leading to a higher risk of GA developing. Future longitudinal evaluation of how 
these 3 types of pseudodrusen progress over time will help to clarify the associations of each 
type of pseudodrusen with development of late AMD and will provide a better 
understanding of how pseudodrusen are related to the development of late AMD.
Although pseudodrusen are distinct from the conventional AMD phenotype (i.e., drusen), 
population-based studies have confirmed similar risk factors for both drusen and 
pseudodrusen, including increasing age, female gender, and smoking.46 Similar to previous 
studies, we found pseudodrusen were more prevalent in women7,8,10,14,21,22 and in older 
subjects.10,11,14,47 However, smoking was not associated with pseudodrusen, likely because 
of the selective CATT participants with a high percentage of former smokers (51%) or 
current smokers (9%). The Beaver Dam Eye Study reported that patients with pseudodrusen 
had higher mortality rates,10 suggesting pseudodrusen may be a manifestation of a systemic 
disease such as cardiovascular disease. In our study, we did not find any difference between 
a history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension between subjects with and without 
pseudodrusen. Although we found a lower proportion with diabetes among subjects with 
pseudodrusen, conclusions must be made with caution. Retinal disease, such as choroidal 
neovascularization or subretinal fluid, can result in the fading or loss of pseudodrusen.3,8 We 
can speculate that diabetic retinopathy following the same mechanism may result in the low 
rate of pseudodrusen in diabetics.
Predicting progression from early to late AMD has high clinical usefulness. In 2005, the 
AREDS Study Group developed a simple AMD severity score for clinical use based on 
fundus photographic features (large drusen and pigment abnormalities) to predict the risk of 
progression to late AMD.17 In the AREDS scoring system, 1 point is added for having any 
large drusen and 1 point for any pigment abnormality (hyperpigmentation or 
depigmentation) in each eye. This simple AREDS scoring system is highly predictive of late 
AMD development.17 In our study, we found that pseudodrusen are an additional

 independent risk factor for late AMD development. Subjects with pseudodrusen had an 
approximately 2 times higher risk of late AMD developing than those without pseudodrusen 
across each level of the AREDS severity score. The baseline pseudodrusen improved the 
prediction for late AMD with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve 
improved from 0.64 (based on AREDS severity scale and dietary supplement use) to 0.68 (P 
= 0.004). This finding supports the inclusion of pseudodrusen evaluation along with large 
drusen and pigmentation abnormalities when predicting the development of late AMD. 
However, pseudodrusen evaluation requires additional grading time on CFP and other 
images (RF images, FA, etc.) by readers with expertise in pseudodrusen evaluation. The 
feasibility and validity of pseudodrusen evaluation in the clinical setting by busy clinicians is 
uncertain. These factors need to be considered before applying the evaluation of 
pseudodrusen to clinical use. The cost effectiveness of applying pseudodrusen evaluation to 
clinical practice requires further investigation.
The strengths of this investigation include a large and well-characterized cohort of unilateral 
nAMD patients. The study has a few limitations. First, the CATT study participants are 
patients with active untreated nAMD. The results from this selective population may not be 
generalizable to the general AMD patients. Second, although the study has large sample 
size, the analyses by type of pseudodrusen (dot, reticular, and confluent) leads to smaller 
cases of pseudodrusen and lower statistical power for detecting their associations with late 
AMD. Our findings that the association of pseudodrusen with nAMD and GA varied with 
type of pseudodrusen need to be validated in future studies. Third, our evaluation of GA was 
based on CFP and FA findings. Not including SD OCT for GA determination may lead to 
the underestimate of GA, because early stages of GA may not be recognized by CFP and 
FA. Finally, we used fundus photographs to detect pseudodrusen that may lead to 
misclassification of pseudodrusen. The prevalence of pseudodrusen in our study (28.4%) 
was lower than in other studies of pseudodrusen in the fellow eye of patients with unilateral 
nAMD (34.6%–55.6%).21–25 Our proportion with pseudodrusen also was lower than the 
proportion (34.6%) from a study that used CFP and blue light photography.21 This 
difference could be the result of the older age of the CATT patients (mean age, 78 years vs. 
74 years), because older patients have more media opacities that hamper the quality of CFP.
8,37 If eyes with pseudodrusen are misclassified as being without pseudodrusen and these 
misclassified pseudodrusen have similar risk to our observed pseudodrusen, the RR for the 
association between pseudodrusen and late AMD may have been underestimated.48 
However, if the misclassified pseudodrusen are at earlier stage and signal lower risk of late 
AMD, the RR may have been overestimated.
In summary, baseline pseudodrusen in the fellow eye of CATT patients were associated with 
an approximately 2 times higher risk of late AMD developing through 2 years follow-up. 
The association with nAMD and GA varies with pseudodrusen type; dot pseudodrusen were 
associated most highly with nAMD, whereas confluent pseudodrusen were associated most 
highly with GA. The presence of pseudodrusen is an independent risk factor for progression 
to late AMD that confers considerable additional risk to eyes with large drusen or pigment 
abnormalities and should be considered when assessing the risk of late AMD.

AMD = age-related macular degeneration; AREDS = Age-Related Eye Diseases Study; GA = geographic atrophy; nAMD = neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
*Adjusted by AREDS severity score and dietary supplement use for nAMD and late AMD; adjusted by AREDS severity score for GA.
†Besides the adjustment of AREDS severity score and dietary supplement use for nAMD and late AMD and adjustment by AREDS severity score for GA, the multivariate model also was adjusted by the 
existence of each type of pseudodrusen by including indicator variables for dot pseudodrusen (yes or no), reticular pseudodrusen (yes or no), and confluent pseudodrusen (yes or no) to evaluate the 
independent association of each type of pseudodrusen with late AMD.
