  IMPORTANCE—Suicide attempts in the US Army have risen in the past decade. 
Understanding the association between suicide attempts and deployment, as well as method and 
timing of suicide attempts, can assist in developing interventions.
 OBJECTIVE—To examine suicide attempt risk factors, methods, and timing among soldiers 
currently deployed, previously deployed, and never deployed at the time this study was conducted.
 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study 
of Regular Army–enlisted soldiers on active duty from 2004 through 2009 used individual-level 
person-month records to examine risk factors (sociodemographic, service related, and mental 
health), method, and time of suicide attempt by deployment status (never, currently, and previously 
deployed). Administrative data for the month before each of 9650 incident suicide attempts and an 
equal-probability sample of 153 528 control person-months for other soldiers were analyzed using 
a discrete-time survival framework.
 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Suicide attempts and career, mental health, and 
demographic predictors were obtained from administrative and medical records.
 RESULTS—Of the 9650 enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide, 86.3% were male, 68.4% 
were younger than 30 years, 59.8% were non-Hispanic white, 76.5%were high school educated, 
and 54.7% were currently married. The 40.4% of enlisted soldiers who had never been deployed 
(n = 12 421 294 person-months) accounted for 61.1% of enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide 
(n = 5894 cases). Risk among those never deployed was highest in the second month of service 
(103 per 100 000 person-months). Risk among soldiers on their first deployment was highest in 
the sixth month of deployment (25 per 100 000 person-months). For those previously deployed, 
risk was highest at 5 months after return (40 per 100 000 person-months). Currently and 
previously deployed soldiers were more likely to attempt suicide with a firearm than those never 
deployed (currently deployed: OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.9–5.6; previously deployed: OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 
1.8–3.9). Across deployment status, suicide attempts were more likely among soldiers who were 
women (currently deployed: OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0–4.0; previously deployed: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 
1.4–1.7; and never deployed: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.3–2.6), in their first 2 years of service (currently 
deployed: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5–2.3; previously deployed: OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9–2.7; and never 
deployed: OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.7–3.6), and had a recently received a mental health diagnosis in the 
previous month (currently deployed: OR, 29.8; 95% CI, 25.0–35.5; previously deployed: OR, 
22.2; 95% CI, 20.1–24.4; and never deployed: OR, 15.0; 95% CI, 14.2–16.0). Among soldiers 
with 1 previous deployment, odds of a suicide attempt were higher for those who screened positive 
for depression or posttraumatic stress disorder after return from deployment and particularly at 
follow-up screening, about 4 to 6 months after deployment (depression: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.9; 
posttraumatic stress disorder: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1–2.8).
 CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Identifying the timing and risk factors for suicide 
attempt in soldiers requires consideration of environmental context, individual characteristics, and 
mental health. These factors can inform prevention efforts.
Suicide attempts (SAs), similar to suicides, have increased in the US Army over the past 
decade.1,2 Soldiers who deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation 
Iraqi Freedom have increased risk of psychiatric morbidity3,4 and have often,2,5,6 but not 
always,7,8 been found to have increased risk of suicide compared with those who never

 deployed (ND).Despite their importance as a gateway to suicide and their associated 
morbidity and costs, SAs have been less studied in general and in the Army in particular.
Worldwide, about 0.4% of adults report that they have made an SA within the past year.9 
The World Health Organization and the US government have called for increased attention 
to suicide and SAs.10,11 Women are at about 50% increased risk of SAs compared with men. 
Those younger than 50 years of age are at about twice the risk of those who are older.9 The 
presence of a mental disorder and the number of disorders substantially increase risk.12 In 
the Army, findings based on data from 2004 to 2009 indicate that women and soldiers who 
are early in their career, younger, and those with a recent mental health diagnosis are at 
increased risk. Those findings also highlighted the significant role of deployment status 
(DS), with ND soldiers at highest risk.13 However, little is known about how risk factors for 
SA may vary by DS, which can inform the development of interventions.14,15
Using a life/career history perspective, we examined risk of Army SAs as a function of DS, 
individual characteristics, and mental health. We examined method of SA by DS because 
access to firearms is increased in theater and may contribute to increased suicide deaths 
during deployment.5,16
 Methods
This component of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members)17 
was approved by the institutional review boards of the Uniformed Services University, 
University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, University of California–San Diego, 
and Harvard Medical School, which determined that the study did not constitute human 
participant research because it relied on deidentified secondary data; therefore, informed 
consent was not obtained. Using a longitudinal, retrospective cohort study design and 
individual-level person-month records for all soldiers on active duty between January 1, 
2004, and December 31, 2009 (N = 1.66 million),17 we selected our analytic sample from 
975 057 Regular Army soldiers (excluding activated Army National Guard/Reserve), 9791 
of whom had a documented SA. This study focused on Regular Army–enlisted soldiers, 
accounting for nearly 99% of SAs from 2004 through 2009.13 The final analytic sample 
included all 9650 enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide and 153 528 control person-
months. Data were analyzed using a discrete-time survival frame work with person-month as 
the unit of analysis18 and each month in the soldier’s career treated as a separate 
observational record. We reduced computational intensity by selecting from the population 
an equal-probability 1:200 sample of control person-months stratified by sex, rank, time in 
service, DS at the time of SA (never, currently, or previously deployed), and historical 
time.19
We identified SA using the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report and International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes E950–
E958 (self-inflicted poisoning or injury with suicidal intent) from health care encounter data 
systems for military and civilian treatment facilities, combat operations, and aeromedical 
evacuations (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The E959 code (late effects of a self-inflicted 
injury) was excluded because it confounds the temporal associations between the predictors

 and SA.20 For soldiers with multiple SAs, we selected the first attempt using a hierarchical 
classification.1 The Department of Defense Suicide Event Report and International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification E950–E958 diagnostic 
codes for method of SA were organized into 2 categories: firearms (excluding explosives, n 
= 1) and other methods (eg, overdose, hanging, and electrocution) (eTable 2 in the 
Supplement).
Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 
from the Military Health System Data Repository, Theater Medical Data Store, and 
Transportation Command Regulating and Command and Control Evacuating System 
records, we identified previous diagnoses of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), and substance use disorder (SUD), and created an indicator for any previous mental 
health diagnosis that included most International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification codes for mental disorders (eTable 3 in the Supplement). To examine 
self-reported depression and PTSD following deployment, we used heath screening data 
from the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA; administered just prior to or 
immediately after return) and Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (PDHRA; 
administered 3–6 months after return) (eAppendix in the Supplement).21,22 We included 
soldiers completing both assessments, using a time frame of 1 month before return to 3 
months after return (PDHA) and 4 to 6 months after return (PDHRA), capturing most 
screening data.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).23 To examine 
the association of DS with method of SA, we used an overall data array with separate data 
files for method of attempt (firearm and other) stacked and distinguished by dummy 
variables. The stacked sample was modeled with a 2-way interaction between DS and 
sample that controlled for sociodemographic and service-related variables.
To examine multivariate associations of sociodemographic and service-related variables with 
SA, separate logistic regression analyses were conducted within groups of soldiers stratified 
by DS. In separate models, we examined the incremental predictive effects of depression, 
PTSD, and SUD diagnoses; the number of those diagnoses in previous months and since 
entering service; and any previous mental health diagnosis. Using the subset of soldiers with 
1 previous deployment who completed both the PDHA and PDHRA prior to their person-
month record, we examined the effects of PTSD or depression diagnosis either early 
(PDHA) or late (PDHRA). Logistic regression coefficients were exponentiated to obtain 
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Final model coefficients were used to generate standardized 
risk estimates (SRE)24 (number of SAs per 100000 person-years) for each category of each 
predictor under the model, assuming other predictors were at their samplewide means. 
Logistic regression models included a dummy predictor for calendar month and year to 
control for increasing rates of SA from 2004 to 2009.1 Coefficients of other predictors can 
be interpreted as averaged within-month associations based on the assumption that effects of 
other predictors do not vary over time.
To examine the risk of SA as a function of time and DS, we used discrete-time hazard 
functions and linear spline models. Analyses estimated risk by (1) months since entering

 service among ND soldiers, (2) months since deploying among those currently on their first 
deployment (CD), and (3) months since returning from first deployment among those 
previously deployed (PD). Splines (piecewise linear functions) were examined using χ2 
tests, deviance, and the Akaike Information Criterion to test whether knots and additional 
linear segments improved model fit to assess nonlinearities in changes in risk by time in 
service.
 Results
Of the 163 178 enlisted soldiers included in this study, 9650 enlisted soldiers attempted 
suicide. The 40.4% of ND soldiers (n = 12 421 294 person-months) accounted for 61.1% of 
enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide (n = 5894 cases) and had the highest rate of attempt 
(569 per 100000 person-years), followed by the 36.2% (n = 11 120 816 person-months) who 
were PD (29.2% of soldiers who attempted suicide [n = 2816 cases]; 304 per 100 000 
person-years) and the 23.4% (n = 7 173 140 person-months) of CD soldiers (9.7% of 
soldiers who attempted suicide [n = 940 cases]; 157 per 100 000 person-years) (Figure 1). 
Firearms were used by 56 (1.0%), 127 (13.6%), and 108 (3.9%) ND, CD, and PD soldiers, 
respectively (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Overdose was the most common method 
(52.2%-56.9%) among soldiers who used other methods. Deployment status was associated 
with SAs by firearm (
; P < .001) and by other methods (
; P < .001). The 
interaction of DS by method of SA was significant (
; P < .001). Odds of a SA by 
firearm were higher among CD soldiers (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.9–5.6) and PD soldiers (OR, 
2.7; 95% CI, 1.8–3.9) than ND soldiers. Previously deployed soldiers had lower odds of an 
SA by firearm than CD soldiers (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
 Predictors of Suicide Attempt by Deployment Status
Standardized risk estimates were highest among ND soldiers and lowest among CD soldiers 
for all sociodemographic and service-related risk factors. Female soldiers had higher odds of 
SA than male soldiers (CD: OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0–4.0; PD: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4–1.7; and 
ND: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.3–2.6). The association of sex differed by DS (
; P < .001). 
Risk of SA decreased with longer time in service in each DS, and associations varied across 
groups (
; P < .001). Soldiers with 1 to 2 years in service had higher odds than those 
with 5 to 10 years (CD: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5–2.3; PD: OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9–2.7; and ND: 
OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.7–3.6).Among soldiers with comparable time in service, the SRE was 
higher among ND soldiers (106–744 per 100 000 person-years) and PD soldiers (114–556 
per 100 000 person-years) than among CD soldiers (63–250 per 100 000 person-years) 
(Table, eFigure 2, and eTable 5 in the Supplement).
History of any mental health diagnosis was associated with SA in all deployment groups, 
controlling for sociodemographic and service-related variables. Soldiers with a diagnosis in 
the previous month had the highest odds vs those with no diagnosis (CD: OR, 29.8; 95% CI, 
25.0–35.5; PD: OR, 22.2; 95% CI, 20.1–24.4; and ND: OR, 15.0; 95% CI, 14.2–16.0). Odds 
decreased monotonically as time increased since the most recent diagnosis. Never-deployed 
soldiers with a diagnosis in the previous month had the highest SRE (4813 per 100 000 
person-years), twice that of CD or PD soldiers with a comparably recent diagnosis (2383

 and 2340 per 100 000 person-years, respectively) (Figure 2; eTable 6 and eTable 7 in the 
Supplement).
Odds were highest for more recently recorded diagnoses of depression, PTSD, and SUD. 
Soldiers with depression in the previous month had the highest odds of SA (CD: OR, 14.1; 
95% CI, 10.4–19.1; PD: OR, 10.6; 95% CI, 9.3–12.0; and ND: OR, 10.2; 95% CI, 9.3–11.2). 
The odds associated with past-month PTSD ranged from 2.4 for PD to 8.1 for CD, and the 
odds associated with past-month SUD ranged from 4.3 for ND to 5.7 for CD soldiers. 
Associations of depression (
; P = .007), PTSD (
; P < .001), and SUD 
(
; P < .001) varied by DS. Never-deployed soldiers with depression, PTSD, or SUD 
in the previous month were at greatest risk (SREs of 4465, 1566, and 2256 per 100 000 
person-years, respectively) (eTable 6 and eTable 7 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
The odds of SA increased as number of diagnoses (depression, PTSD, and SUD) in the 
previous month increased from 1 (CD: OR, 13.2; 95% CI, 10.1–17.2; PD: OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 
8.5–10.4; and ND: OR, 8.8; 95% CI, 8.1–9.5) to 2 or more (CD: OR, 37.1; 95% CI,20.2–
68.4; PD: OR, 17.0; 95% CI, 13.7–21.1; and ND: OR, 17.1; 95% CI, 13.5–21.6). This 
association varied by DS (P = .002), with the highest odds associated with CD soldiers. The 
pattern was similar for the total number of mental health diagnoses since entering the Army 
for each DS. Odds increased from no diagnoses to 1 diagnosis (CD: OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 3.1–
4.1; PD: OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 4.3–5.2; and ND: OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 5.0–5.7) and 2 or more (CD: 
OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 5.5–8.6; PD: OR, 12.3; 95% CI, 11.2–13.6; ND: OR, 11.2; 95% CI, 10.0–
12.4) (eTable 6 and eTable 7 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Among soldiers with 1 deployment, those who screened positive for depression or PTSD 
early (PDHA) had greater risk of SA (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8) but odds were highest 
among those who screened positive later (PDHRA) (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3–3.1). Standard 
risk estimates for soldiers with a negative screen, early positive screen only, and late positive 
screen for depression or PTSD were 259, 370, and 689 per 100 000 person-years, 
respectively. Examined simultaneously in the same model, depression (P < .001) and PTSD 
(P < .001) were significant and continued to independently be associated with SA during the 
later screen. Soldiers with a late positive depression screen were more likely to attempt 
suicide (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.0–2.9), whereas the odds among those with an early positive 
depression screen were not elevated (OR, 1.2; 95% CI,0.9–1.7). Odds were higher among 
soldiers with a late positive PTSD screen relative to those with a negative screen (OR, 1.7; 
95% CI, 1.5–2.1) but not higher among those with only an early positive PTSD screen (OR, 
1.3; 95% CI, 0.9–1.7) (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
 Monthly Risk of First Suicide Attempt by Deployment Status
Never-deployed soldiers were at greatest risk in the second month of service (103 per 100 
000 person-months). Risk in this group increased early in service, followed by a decline, 
then increased at a gradual and constant rate through the end of the first year of service. The 
median deployment length was 12 months, with 75% having a deployment 11 to 15 months 
long. Among soldiers on their first deployment, risk of SA was highest in the sixth month of 
deployment (25 per 100 000 person-months), followed by a gradual decline in risk over the

 remaining months. Among soldiers who had returned from their first deployment, risk of SA 
increased and peaked around the fifth month after return (40 per 100 000 person-months), 
followed by a decrease over time (Figure 3).
Hazard functions indicated that monthly risk of SA was highest for those with a late positive 
screen for depression or PTSD (62–107 per 100 000 person-months). Monthly risk was 
lower for those with only an early positive screen after deployment (21–66 per 100 000 
person-months), and lowest for those who screened negative for both disorders (19–29 per 
100 000 person-months). Spline analyses indicated that the risk decreased over the 24 
months after deployment but remained elevated for those who screened positive on the 
PDHRA (Figure 4).
 Discussion
To our knowledge, SA has rarely been studied with data as comprehensive as available for 
these analyses. The findings highlight the importance of life and career history in 
understanding SAs in soldiers and the complexity of risk and protective factors across 
contexts. We found the highest rates of SA were among ND soldiers and those in their first 
years of service. Future research should examine the degree to which this risk is accounted 
for by those who recently entered service. Prior studies found that female soldiers are more 
likely than male soldiers to make a medically documented13,25 or self-reported SA.26 We 
found this effect across all deployment contexts, with CD women having the highest odds of 
SA relative to men. Although men are more likely to die by suicide in any deployment 
context, this pattern of increased risk among CD women has also been observed for suicide 
death.27 Further research is required to understand factors that may contribute to these sex 
differences: occupational differences among those deployed, variation in social support by 
DS, the role of sexual assault or harassment,28 or sex differences in response to deployment-
related stressors.
The association of mental health diagnosis with suicidal behaviors is well established.29 We 
found that the magnitude of this association across deployment contexts increased with 
recent diagnosis. This pattern was observed for a history of any mental health diagnosis and 
specifically for depression, PTSD, and SUD. This finding is consistent with evidence that 
75%of service members had contact with the health care system in the month prior to a self-
inflicted injury.30 Although the importance of recent diagnosis may be expected because it is 
a potential indicator of acuity, it also highlights the challenges of prevention even among 
soldiers identified as having psychiatric risk. Posttraumatic stress disorder, SUD, and 
depression each increased risk even after adjusting for the other 2 disorders.
The higher risk among ND soldiers in their second month of service, a stressful time during 
basic training and Army acculturation, reinforces the importance of developing and 
evaluating effective risk detection and intervention strategies early in a soldier’s career. 
Whether this risk pattern was associated with expanded Army recruitment during war or 
anticipated deployments or is a persistent pattern of risk among soldiers in training remains 
to be determined.

 Although SA by firearm made up a small percentage of attempts, the risk was increased 
during deployment and after deployment, suggesting that the deployment environment, with 
high access to firearms, may contribute to the lethality of suicidal behavior. Indirect support 
for this comes from previous Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service-members 
research indicating that CD enlisted soldiers had a higher rate of suicide death than ND 
soldiers,5 and nearly all suicides in theater were by firearm.31 The rate of SA during 
deployment peaked in the sixth month, the approximate mid-deployment period (often a 
time of return home and changing anticipation of deployment length). A similar curvilinear 
relationship for suicide and suicide ideation, peaking at mid-deployment, was observed in 
early Army reports and was associated with the worst levels of self-reported morale and 
mental health problems.32 Information on temporal risk patterns can inform health care 
professionals so that intervention strategies are available and accessible during high-risk 
periods. The SA rate during this mid-deployment period remains lower than in ND soldiers 
during their first year of service. This may be the result of screening prior to deployment, 
fewer mental health diagnoses among those deployed, or other individual or contextual 
factors.
Among PD soldiers, risk increased over the first 5 months after deployment. Difficulties 
with postdeployment readjustment are well documented.33 The peak risk at 5 months after 
deployment is consistent with previous research suggesting that self-reported mental health 
concerns are significantly greater 3 to 6 months postdeployment than immediately on 
return.34 This is further supported by our finding that soldiers who screened positive for 
depression or PTSD during the later assessment (PDHRA) had higher risk than those with a 
negative screen and those with an early (PDHA) positive screen only. Risk among those with 
a late positive depression screen decreased over time but remained elevated up to 2 years 
after deployment. These data suggest that self-report screening, in addition to clinician 
diagnosis, may be a valuable part of a larger risk detection program. Programs to help 
soldiers in the months following redeployment may be particularly important;22 however, 
the effectiveness of these programs can be hampered by underreporting of difficulties.35
Research by Nock et al26 found increased odds of a past SA among PD soldiers. However, 
there are important methodological differences.13 Whereas this study includes ND soldiers 
who are still in training (a period of greatly increased risk), Nock et al26 surveyed soldiers in 
later stages of their careers who were presumably healthy and resilient enough to complete 
training. In addition, Nock et al26 studied self-reported first lifetime SA, whereas our study 
examines first medically documented SA during Army service. Future studies using a 
combination of Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members survey data 
with linked administrative data can further detail the reasons for these differences.
Several limitations in this study are noteworthy. First, ascertainment of SAs was limited to 
events captured by the health care system that vary in degree of lethality, particularly 
attempts by firearm. They are subject to coding errors and changes in policy and procedures 
(eg, electronic vs paper medical records). Second, findings represent 2004 to 2009. Third, 
this study examined a limited set of predictors. Fourth, post-deployment health findings may 
not represent all PD soldiers because they were limited to soldiers who deployed only once 
and completed both assessments. Finally, differences across DS are not evidence of within-

 person changes over time because the composition of these groups is affected by the non-
random nature of deployment and Army attrition.36–38
 Conclusions
Deployment context is important in identifying SA risk among Army-enlisted soldiers. A 
life/career history perspective can assist in identifying high-risk segments of a population 
based on factors such as timing, environmental context, and individual characteristics. Our 
findings, while most relevant to active-duty US Army soldiers, highlight considerations that 
may inform the study of suicide risk in other contexts such as during the transition from 
military to civilian life.39

 Acknowledgments
Funding/Support: Army STARRS was sponsored by the Department of the Army and funded under cooperative 
agreement U01MH087981 with the US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, 
and the National Institute of Mental Health
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: As a cooperative agreement, scientists employed by the National Institute of Mental 
Health (Drs Colpe and Schoenbaum) and Army liaisons/consultants (COL Steven Cersovsky, MD, MPH USAPHC 
and Kenneth Cox, MD, MPH USAPHC) had a role in the design and conduct of the study; and collection, 
management, analysis, and interpretation of the data. Although a draft of this manuscript was submitted to the 
Army and National Institute of Mental Health for review and comment prior to submission, this was with the 
understanding that comments would be no more than advisory and they had no direct role in the preparation, 
review, or approval of the manuscript, or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

 Key Points
Question
How does suicide attempt risk vary by deployment, mental health, and timing among US 
Army–enlisted soldiers?
Findings
In this cohort study of administrative records (individuals who attempted suicide vs 
control individuals), risk estimates for sociodemographic and mental health predictors 
were highest among those never deployed, and currently and previously deployed 
soldiers had the highest risk of attempt by firearm. Risk was highest in the second month 
of service (never deployed), sixth month of deployment (currently deployed), and fifth 
month after return (previously deployed).
Meaning
Deployment status, mental health, and timing are important to understanding risk of 
suicide attempts among soldiers.

 Figure 1. Suicide Attempts by Deployment Status Among Regular Army Enlisted Soldiers
The sample of enlisted soldiers (9650 soldiers who attempted suicide and 153 528 control 
person-months) is a subset of the total sample (193 617 person-months) from the Army 
Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members Historical Administrative Data 
Study. Standardized risk estimates (soldiers who attempted suicide per 100 000 person-
years) assume other predictors were at their samplewide means. Estimates were calculated 
based on logistic regression models that included basic sociodemographic and service-
related variables (sex, age at entry into the Army, current age, race/ethnicity, education, 
marital status, and time in service) and also included a dummy predictor variable for 
calendar month and year to control for secular trends.

 Figure 2. Standardized Risk of Suicide Attempt by Mental Health Diagnosis and Deployment 
Status Among Regular Army Enlisted Soldiers
The sample of enlisted soldiers (n = 9650 soldiers who attempted suicide and 153 528 
control person-months) is a subset of the total sample (n = 193 617 person-months) from the 
Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service members Historical Administrative 
Data Study. Any mental health diagnosis includes most International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for mental disorders (eg, major 
depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and personality disorders), but excludes 
postconcussion syndrome and tobacco use disorder when those were the only recorded 
mental health diagnoses. See eTable 3 in the Supplement for a complete list of included and 
excluded International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
codes. Standardized risk estimates (soldiers who attempted suicide per 100 000 person-
years) assume other predictors were at their samplewide means. Estimates were calculated 
based on logistic regression models that included basic sociodemographic and service-
related variables (sex, age at entry into the Army, current age, race/ethnicity, education,

 Figure 4. Postdeployment Depression or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Risk of Suicide 
Attempt Among Regular Army–Enlisted Soldiers With 1 Previous Deployment
The sample of 10 378 enlisted soldiers with 1 previous deployment who completed both the 
Postdeployment Health Assessment (early screen; 1–3 months after deployment) and 
Postdeployment Health Reassessment (late screen; 4–5 months after deployment) prior to 
their suicide attempt (cases) or sampled person-month record (controls) is a subset of the 
total sample (193 617 person-months) from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience 
in Service members Historical Administrative Data Study. Odds ratios and standardized risk 
estimates for each diagnostic category were calculated based on logistic regression models 
that adjusted for the other diagnostic categories and basic sociodemographic and service-
related variables (sex, age at entry into the Army, current age, race/ethnicity, education, 
marital status, and time in service), and which also included a dummy predictor variable for 
calendar month and year to control for secular trends.
