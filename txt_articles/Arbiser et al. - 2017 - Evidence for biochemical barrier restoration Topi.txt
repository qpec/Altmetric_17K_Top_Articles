Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting 2.5–6 million patients in the United States. The 
cause of psoriasis remains unknown. Previous human and animal studies suggest that patients with a 
susceptible genetic background and some stimulus, such as barrier disruption, leads to a coordinated 
signaling events involving cytokines between keratinocytes, endothelial cells, T cells, macrophages 
and dendritic cells. Ceramides are endogenous skin lipids essential for maintaining skin barrier function 
and loss of ceramides may underlie inflammatory and premalignant skin. Ceramides act as a double-
edged sword, promoting normal skin homeostasis in the native state, but can be metabolized to 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), linked to inflammation and tumorigenesis. To overcome this difficulty, 
we synthesized solenopsin analogs which biochemically act as ceramides, but cannot be metabolized 
to S1P. We assess their in vivo bioactivity in a well-established mouse model of psoriasis, the KC-Tie2 
mouse. Topical solenopsin derivatives normalized cutaneous hyperplasia in this model, decreased T cell 
infiltration, interleukin (IL)-22 transcription, and reversed the upregulation of calprotectin and Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) 4 in inflamed skin. Finally, they stimulated interleukin (IL)-12 production in skin dendritic 
cells. Thus suggesting barrier restoration has both a biochemical and physical component, and both are 
necessary for optimal barrier restoration.
Psoriasis is a common autoimmune disease mediated in part by interleukin (IL) 17-biased T lymphocytes1, 2. 
It affects 1–2% of the US population and the mainstays of treatment are topical agents for limited disease and 
systemic and biologic agents for more generalized disease. Systemic agents include methotrexate, vitamin A 
derivatives and cyclosporine, while biologic therapies target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα
), IL-23 and 
IL-17. Biologic therapies have made a major impact on the quality of life of patients with severe psoriasis, but are 
expensive and predispose patients to infection and malignancy3–5. Finally, biologic agents are not indicated for 
the majority of patients who have mild to moderate disease. For decades, the mainstay of topical treatment for 
psoriasis was topical steroids. While effective in a significant number of patients, topical steroids are not a pana-
cea for psoriasis. First, resistance (tachyphylaxis) is observed after long-term use. Second, cutaneous atrophy is a 
well-known side effect of long-term topical steroid use6. Finally, some lesions are highly refractory to topical ster-
oids, especially thicker lesions. While new topical agents have been introduced, none have significantly impacted 
the rate of use of topical steroids. These agents include vitamin D analogs, retinoids, and calcineurin inhibitors. 
Barrier restoration with emollients contributes to resolution of psoriasis, but does not fully reverse the psoriatic 
phenotype.

Ceramides play an essential role in maintaining the barrier function of the skin and loss of barrier function 
increases expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major mediator of angiogenesis and inflam-
mation7. However, the failure of emollient barriers to fully reduce inflammation implies a specific biochemical 
role of ceramides in epidermal homeostasis. Ceramides are generated from lipid precursors and can be degraded 
by enzymatic hydrolysis or metabolized into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a mediator of cellular growth, car-
cinogenesis, and inflammation8. We have synthesized ceramide analogs that are incapable of hydrolysis or metab-
olism to S1P and have demonstrated that these analogs have in vivo efficacy in a well-validated murine model of 
psoriasis9. Gene array analysis validated by immunohistochemistry indicates that these analogs decrease produc-
tion of S100A8 and S100A9 (calprotectin) and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 calprotectin receptor, leading to a 
reduction in epidermal thickness and lymphocytic infiltration10. Calprotectin is a dimer of S100A8 and S100A9, 
which complexes both calcium and zinc, and may act as a pro-inflammatory factor through the sequestration 
of zinc. Fecal calprotectin is now used as a biomarker of colonic inflammation11–14. Gene array of treated vs. 
untreated inflamed skin shows downregulation of IL-22 and upregulation of AP-1 members FosB and c-Jun. 
Calprotectin has been implicated as the human PSORS4 locus15, 16. Given that IL-22 plays a major role in medi-
ating both inflammation and carcinogenesis17–20, these compounds could potentially be useful in a wide variety 
of skin disorders. Thus, restoration of barrier function with stable ceramide analogs leads to an upregulation of 
IL-12, downregulation of IL-22 and stable production of IL-23, leading to an antiangiogenic phenotype. Finally, 
we introduce the concept of biochemical barrier restoration that explains, in part, why physical barrier restoration 
is, by itself, incapable of fully resolving cutaneous inflammation.
Results
Topical S12 and S14 treatment of KC-Tie2 mice decreases epidermal thickness and immune 
cell infiltrate. 
S12 and S14 are solenopsin analogs that have 12 and 14 carbon side chains respectively, on the 
piperidine pharmacophore. KC-Tie2 mice treated with either S12 or S14 for 28 days showed significant decreases 
(n = 9/grp; 28–35%; P < 0.001) in acanthosis and hyperkeratosis compared to animals treated with vehicle control 
(n = 8; Fig. 1). This pattern of acanthosis and hyperkeratosis is highly similar to the pathologic changes seen in 
human psoriasis.
Psoriasis is characterized by T cell infiltration. Significant decrease in CD4+ T cell infiltration (47–63%; 
P < 0.001) accompanied the improvement in acanthosis in both S12- and S14-treated mice (Fig. 2). In order 
to determine whether solenopsin analogs had differential effect on T cell and murine dendritic cells (DC), we 
examined the effect of treatment on KC-Tie2 mice treated with S14, but not S12. Treatment with S14 resulted in 
significant decreases in CD8+ T cell (47%; P < 0.01) and CD11c+ dendritic cell infiltration into dorsal skin (18%; 
P = 0.04) compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 3). It may be that the 14 carbon chain is an optimal length to pene-
trate cell membranes and inhibit the function of both CD8+ and CD11c+ dendritic cells. We have made analogs 
with longer side chains than 14 carbons and have found them to be not as effective9.
In order to gain insight into the mechanism of the efficacy of solenopsin analogs, RNA was generated from 
vehicle- and compound-treated skin and subjected to gene array analysis. The heat maps showed strong overlap 
between the genes regulated by S12 and S14 compared with controls (Figure S1) and genes commonly regulated 
by both analogs compared with vehicles were studied further. These include specific AP-1 subunits, including 
FosB and ATF3.
S12 and S14 compounds cause a decrease in IL-22, an increase in IL-12, but no changes in IL-23 
production by dendritic cells. 
Since the solenopsin analogs were shown to decrease DC infiltration, and 
given DC are a source of IL-22, antiangiogenic IL-12 and proangiogenic IL-23, we wanted to investigate the 
effect of S12 and S14 on DC. Murine DC were pre-incubated with the compounds and then stimulated with 
a TLR4-ligand, LPS. The compounds significantly inhibited mRNA expression of IL-22 (Fig. 4A) and strongly 
induced IL-12p70 production in DC (Fig. 4B). This effect was not observed in IL-23 production (Fig. 4C).
Solenopsin Analogs Downregulate TLR4 expression in Keratinocytes. 
TLR4 serves as a 
co-receptor for S100A8 and S100A9 and has been shown to be a prominent mediator of both inflammation and 
tumorigenesis10. Given that S100A8 and S100A9 are downregulated by solenopsin analogs and that S100A8/
A9 expression of TLR4 could mediate a positive feedback loop, we looked at the expression of TLR4 in human 
HaCaT keratinocytes treated with LPS, a canonical activator of TLR4. Treatment with the solenopsin derivatives 
S12 and S14 led to a significant decrease in TLR4 expression (Fig. 5).
Discussion
Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that afflicts approximately 1% of the population3, 21. Increasing evidence of 
systemic involvement is suggested by epidemiologic association with other diseases, including coronary artery 
disease, obesity, and metabolic syndrome21. In recent years, targeting cytokines has become very popular for the 
treatment of severe psoriasis, with modalities targeting TNFα
, IL-12, and, most recently, IL-1722–25. These modal-
ities are reserved for the most severe cases, as they can result in systemic immunosuppression and are also costly.
Most cases of psoriasis are classified as mild or moderate and topicals are a mainstay of therapy. Topical 
corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy for the last 5 decades, with other topicals (retinoids, calcineurin 
inhibitors and vitamin D analogs) playing a relatively minor role in the management of psoriasis26. While effective 
in some cases, topical corticosteroids exhibit some negatives as well, including loss of efficacy, rebound, and skin 
atrophy. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis.
Barrier disruption is a well-known clinical phenomenon in inflammatory and malignant skin disease. We have 
previously demonstrated that barrier disruption induces the potent angiogenic mediator VEGF, which contrib-
utes to chronic inflammation and angiogenesis7. Ceramides may also impact on the neuroendocrine environment

of the skin in a manner to prevent excess inflammation and angiogenesis27, 28. The biochemical effectors of barrier 
disruption are not fully understood, but one candidate is a family of lipids known as ceramides, a class of fatty acid 
amides. Ceramides are synthesized from fatty acid precursors and degraded in part through amide hydrolysis. 
Ceramides have been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. The beneficial effects of

ceramides have been explained in part by the normalization of lipid rafts, which subsequently activates the tumor 
suppressor PTEN, as well as stimulating mitophagy29. Disordered ceramide synthesis has been shown to result in 
an inflammatory skin disorder in mice8, 30, 31.

In order to augment ceramide signaling, we synthesized a series of non-hydrolysable ceramide analogs that 
exhibit ceramide-like signaling, including normalization of lipid rafts and mitophagy9, 32, 33. Since these com-
pounds, analogs of the ant venom compound solenopsin, lack amide groups, they cannot be hydrolyzed. We 
analyzed the effect of a topical 1% formulation of two analogs, S12 and S14, which we have previously found to be 
the most biologically-active derivatives.
In order to determine the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of topical solenopsin derivatives, we 
performed gene array analysis on active- vs. vehicle-treated skins and looked for genes that were coordinately 
upregulated by both S12 and S14. The top most regulated genes were S100A8 and S100A9, which are downregu-
lated by the derivatives. These two genes form a complex called calprotectin that protects against reactive oxygen 
stress, chelates zinc, and has antimicrobial properties. Of interest, calprotectin is upregulated in virtually every 
murine model of psoriasis, including this model, imiquimod-induced inflammation, and loss of selective AP-1 
subunits from the epidermis (c-Jun/JunB), and is highly expressed in human psoriasis, but not atopic dermati-
tis1, 11, 34. Our derivatives also downregulate TLR4, a co-receptor for calprotectin. Examination of the promoter 
sequences of S100A8, S100A9, and TLR4 reveal that these genes are regulated by NFκ
B and AP-135, 36. It should 
also be noted that both S100A8 and S100A9 are highly expressed in vascular atheroma of atherosclerosis that is 
highly associated with psoriasis37, 38.
Traditionally, psoriasis has been thought to be mediated by CD4 lymphocytes. However, recent findings have 
pointed towards a distinct role of CD8 lymphocytes in psoriasis. First, CD8 lymphocytes have been found to be 
more abundant in psoriatic epidermis than CD4 lymphocytes39. Second, subsets of CD8 lymphocytes have been 
shown to be of the Tc22 lineage, which is a major producer of IL-22 in the skin.

in IL-22 mRNA expression. The compounds also increase levels of IL-12 but no changes in IL-23 production

Both S12 and S14 also upregulated the AP-1 transcriptional regulators FosB and ATF3 in gene arrays. These 
genes have previously been demonstrated to be downregulated in non-lesional psoriatic skin compared with 
normal skin, thus suggesting that even non-lesional skin in psoriasis patients may have disturbances in ceramide 
metabolism and that this disturbance may predispose skin to psoriatic inflammation8, 40.
Finally, solenopsin derivatives modulate DC to produce IL-12 rather than IL-23. IL-12 has been shown to be 
anti-angiogenic and, more recently, has been shown to have anti-psoriatic activity on its own41. Thus, it is likely 
that solenopsin analogs, by restoring ceramide signaling, restore normal skin homeostasis potentially through an 
anti-inflammatory AP-1/IL-12 pathway.
Our findings have direct relevance to human psoriasis. S100A8 is upregulated by some of the current treatments 
for human psoriasis, namely glucocorticoids and UVA40, 42, 43. We believe this to be a compensatory upregulation of 
S100A8 and related molecules in response to treatment, which may be a mechanism of resistance to anti-psoriatic 
therapy. S100A8 may thus serve as a biomarker for the effectiveness of anti-psoriatic drugs, and combination ther-
apies with solenopsin analogs and other modalities for psoriasis, such as glucocorticoids and UV light, may lead to 
long-term remission. Further studies of these analogs as anti-psoriatic drugs are warranted in humans.
Materials and Methods
Mouse Model. 
K5tTA and TetosTek/Tie2 mice (on a CD1 outbred background) were crossed to generate 
double transgenic KC-Tie2 mice as described previously44. These mice spontaneously develop an inflammatory 
skin phenotype that phenocopies human psoriasis, including an ~6-fold increase in epidermal thickness (acan-
thosis), infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a dense cutaneous myeloid cell presence (CD11c+, CD11b+ 
and F4/80+), along with the development of munro-like microabscesses containing GR1+ neutrophils44. The 
skin resembles human psoriasis at the transcriptomic45 and proteomic levels46. The cutaneous phenotype is 
reversible following broad immunosuppression using cyclosporine A (CsA)44 and inhibition of clinically effica-
cious targets, including TNFα
, IL-23 or antigen cell depletion20–22. Importantly, KC-Tie2 mice fail to respond to 
drugs to which psoriasis patients have failed to respond47, 48. Thus, the KC-Tie2 model provides a critical tool for 
testing efficacy of responsiveness to potential anti-psoriasis drugs.
Adult male and female KC-Tie2 mice with established skin disease were treated with the compounded S12 
(n = 9) or S14 (n = 9) analogs or control vehicle cream (n = 8) applied to their dorsal skin 1x/day for 28 days. At 
the completion of the experiment, mice were euthanized and dorsal skin harvested and processed as described 
previously44 for histological, immunostaining and transcriptomic analyses.
Animal protocols were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC; Cleveland, OH) and were consistent with guidelines issued by the American Association for 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
Histological and immunostaining analyses. 
Dorsal skin was collected and processed as described pre-
viously for histology and immunohistochemistry44. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin was sectioned and 
stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard techniques as described44. Fresh frozen skin was 
sectioned and stained, as previously published44, 49, using antibodies targeting the following proteins: CD4 (clone 
RM4-5, Cat.#550280), CD8a (clone 53-6.7, Cat.#550281), CD11c (clone HL3, Cat.#550283; all BD Pharmingen; 
San Jose, CA) and F4/80 (clone BM8, Cat.#14-4801, eBioscience; San Diego, CA).
Epidermal thickness (acanthosis) measurements and immune cell quantification in dorsal skin sections 
was completed using microscopic images collected from the stained sections using interactive image analyses 
approaches as described previously44.
Gene array analysis. 
Dorsal skin samples from KC-Tie2 mice treated with control vehicle, S12 or S14 
were excised, snap-frozen and submitted to the Emory Integrated Genomics Core for RNA extraction, quality 
analysis and gene expression assay. Gene expression analysis was performed using an Affymetrix GeneChipTM 
Microarray: Mouse Gene ST 2.0 and Gene Expression Module of GenomeStudio Software (v2011.1, Illumina).
Generation of murine bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells (BMDCs). 
Murine dendritic 
cells (DC) were generated from bone marrow cells according to the method of Guenova et al.50. Tibiae and femurs 
from naive mice were removed under sterile conditions. Both ends of the bones were cut off and bone marrow 
was collected from the medullary cavities by flushing with a PBS-filled syringe. Bone marrow was disrupted by 
pushing the clumps through 40 μ
m cell strainers using the rubber tip of a syringe plunger. Cell suspensions were 
centrifuged and the cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μ
l hypotonic ACK Lysing Buffer and incubated for 3 min 
to lyse the erythrocytes. Cells were centrifuged, washed with medium, and counted.
Bone marrow cells were resuspended at 2 ×
 105 cells/ml in DC culture medium containing 200 U/ml 
rmGM-CSF (Cat.#415-ML, R&D) and 10 ml were plated into 100 ×
 15 mm plastic petri dishes (Cat# 351029, 
BD). On day 3, an additional 10 ml DC culture medium containing 200 U/ml rmGM-CSF (R&D) were added 
and, at day 6, half of the culture supernatant was removed and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended 
in 10 ml DC culture medium containing 200 U/ml rmGM-CSF and transferred back into the plate. At day 7, 
BMDCs (non-adherent cells) were harvested and used for stimulation. Cells were treated with vehicle, S12 or S14 
compounds (5 µM or 10 µM) overnight and, at day 8, DC were further stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 
100 ng/ml, from Salmonella minnesota R595, Alexis Biochemicals, Lausanne, Switzerland) for 24 h.
Supernatants were collected for ELISA. For FACS analysis, BMDCs were harvested and labeled with appro-
priate antibodies to measure the expression of activation markers and costimulatory molecules. Cytokines 
were detected by ELISA using commercially available kits for determination of IL-12p70 (BD Biosciences, 
Cat.#555256) and IL-23 (eBioscience, Cat.#88-7230).

TLR4 Assessment. 
Human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell line was obtained from UAB Skin Disease Research 
Center and propagated in monolayer in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% 
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μ
g/ml penicillin and 100 μ
g/ml streptomycin from Life Technologies 
(Carlsbad, CA). The cells were maintained in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 
different concentrations of solenopsin analogs (in DMSO) and/or primed with LPS (10 µg/ml) for 24 h.
Total RNA was extracted from HaCaT cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The concentration of 
total RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Bio-Rad Smart Spec spectrophotometer 
(Hercules, CA). cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg RNA using Reverse Transcriptase kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) 
according to kit instructions. Using iQTM SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), cDNA was amplified by 
qPCR using human TLR4 primers with a Bio-Rad MyiQ thermocycler and SYBR Green detection system (Bio-Rad, 
Hercules, CA). The standard PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 
30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The expression level of TLR4 was normalized to the expression level of GAPDH in each sam-
ple. Relative mRNA expression for duplicate samples was calculated using the Δ
Δ
CT method.

IL-22 mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR as previously described by 
Fritz et al. with primers purchased from Applied Biosystems - primers chosen to span intro-exon51.
Statistics. 
Comparisons between groups for acanthosis and immune cell density were performed using an 
unpaired, two-tailed, unequal variance Student’s t-test. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered signifi-
cant. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
Statistics for GeneChipTM Analysis. 
Probe level intensity values were extracted and quantile normalization 
was performed using the Gene Expression Module of the GenomeStudio Software (v2011.1, Illumina). Principle 
Component Analysis (PCA) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were used to assess the variation in the 
expression profiles. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM; http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/) 
 
was used to derive a refined list of genes most affected by S12 and S14 compared to the vehicle control.
