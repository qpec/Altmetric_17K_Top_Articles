BACKGROUND
In sub-Saharan Africa, among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, the rate of death from infection (including tuberculosis and cryptococcus) shortly 
after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is approximately 10%.
METHODS
In this factorial open-label trial conducted in Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Kenya, we 
enrolled HIV-infected adults and children 5 years of age or older who had not received previ-
ous ART and were starting ART with a CD4+ count of fewer than 100 cells per cubic milli-
meter. They underwent simultaneous randomization to receive enhanced antimicrobial 
prophylaxis or standard prophylaxis, adjunctive raltegravir or no raltegravir, and supplemen-
tary food or no supplementary food. Here, we report on the effects of enhanced antimicro-
bial prophylaxis, which consisted of continuous trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole plus at 
least 12 weeks of isoniazid–pyridoxine (coformulated with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole 
in a single fixed-dose combination tablet), 12 weeks of fluconazole, 5 days of azithromycin, 
and a single dose of albendazole, as compared with standard prophylaxis (trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole alone). The primary end point was 24-week mortality.
RESULTS
A total of 1805 patients (1733 adults and 72 children or adolescents) underwent randomiza-
tion to receive either enhanced prophylaxis (906 patients) or standard prophylaxis (899 pa-
tients) and were followed for 48 weeks (loss to follow-up, 3.1%). The median baseline CD4+ 
count was 37 cells per cubic millimeter, but 854 patients (47.3%) were asymptomatic or 
mildly symptomatic. In the Kaplan–Meier analysis at 24 weeks, the rate of death with en-
hanced prophylaxis was lower than that with standard prophylaxis (80 patients [8.9% vs. 108 
[12.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.03); 98 patients 
(11.0%) and 127 (14.4%), respectively, had died by 48 weeks (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58 
to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04). Patients in the enhanced-prophylaxis group had significantly lower rates of 
tuberculosis (P 
= 
0.02), cryptococcal infection (P 
= 
0.01), oral or esophageal candidiasis 
(P 
= 
0.02), death of unknown cause (P 
= 
0.03), and new hospitalization (P 
= 
0.03). However, 
there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of severe bacterial infection 
(P 
= 
0.32). There were nonsignificantly lower rates of serious adverse events and grade 4 ad-
verse events in the enhanced-prophylaxis group (P 
= 
0.08 and P 
= 
0.09, respectively). Rates of 
HIV viral suppression and adherence to ART were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, enhanced antimicrobial pro-
phylaxis combined with ART resulted in reduced rates of death at both 24 weeks and 48 weeks 
without compromising viral suppression or increasing toxic effects. (Funded by the Medical 
Research Council and others; REALITY Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN43622374.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A
lthough the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) guidelines now recom-
mend universal antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) regardless of the CD4+ count,1-3 20 to 25% 
of patients with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection in sub-Saharan Africa present for 
care with severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count, 
<100 cells per cubic millimeter).4 Among these 
patients, approximately 10% die during the first 
3 months after ART initiation.5-8 Causes of death 
are multifactorial and similar between adults and 
older children,7 with severe bacterial infection,3,9 
tuberculosis,8,10,11 and cryptococcal infection12,13 
playing prominent roles. The development or 
exacerbation of such infections has been linked 
in part to the immune reconstitution inflamma-
tory syndrome (IRIS) associated with the initia-
tion of ART. Current guidelines recommend rul-
ing out tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis 
before the initiation of ART, along with the use 
of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and isoniazid 
prophylaxis.1,14,15 The risk of death increases 
markedly with decreasing CD4+ counts and 
body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters) in 
both adults and children,7 which suggests the 
need for additional interventions aimed at pre-
venting infection, accelerating immune recovery 
(through rapid viral-load reduction), and improv-
ing nutritional status.
One approach to preventing infection in all 
patients is administering preemptive treatment 
courses for specific high-burden diseases (e.g., 
tuberculosis) when ART is initiated.16,17 Another 
is an antimicrobial prophylaxis package target-
ing dominant pathogens among patients with ad-
vanced HIV infection after the clinical exclusion 
of active infections. Such a pragmatic approach 
could be universally provided at low-level health 
facilities. Possible adverse outcomes include tox-
icity, antimicrobial resistance, and reduced ad-
herence to the ART regimen because of the need 
to take additional pills.
In the Reduction of Early Mortality in HIV-
Infected Adults and Children Starting Antiretro-
viral Therapy (REALITY) trial, we compared three 
interventions — enhanced antimicrobial pro-
phylaxis, additional raltegravir, and food supple-
mentation — to reduce early mortality in adults 
and older children with a CD4+ count of fewer 
than 100 cells per cubic millimeter in whom 
ART was initiated in four sub-Saharan African 
countries. Here, we report the effect of enhanced 
antimicrobial prophylaxis only.
Methods
Trial Enrollment
From June 2013 through April 2015, in eight ur-
ban or periurban centers in Uganda, Zimbabwe, 
Malawi, and Kenya, we enrolled HIV-infected 
adults and children who were 5 years of age or 
older, who had not received previous ART, and 
who had a CD4+ count of fewer than 100 cells 
per cubic millimeter. Patients were excluded if 
they were pregnant or breast-feeding, had re-
ceived single-dose nevirapine to prevent mother-
to-child transmission of HIV, or had any contra-
indications to the trial drugs. Adult patients and 
guardians provided written informed consent; 
older children provided additional assent, accord-
ing to national guidelines. The trial was approved 
by ethics committees in Uganda, Zimbabwe, 
Malawi, Kenya, and the United Kingdom.
Trial Design
All the patients initiated ART with two nucleo-
side reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and one non-
nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. They 
were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
initiate open-label enhanced antimicrobial pro-
phylaxis or standard prophylaxis. Enhanced 
prophylaxis consisted of a single dose (400 mg) 
of albendazole, 5 days of azithromycin (500 mg 
once daily), 12 weeks of fluconazole (100 mg once 
daily), and 12 weeks of a fixed-dose combina-
tion of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (160 mg 
of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxa-
zole), isoniazid (300 mg), and pyridoxine (25 mg) 
as a scored once-daily tablet (total, three tablets 
per day for 1 to 5 days, then two pills per day for 
12 weeks). Doses were halved for children young-
er than 13 years of age, except for albendazole. 
Standard prophylaxis consisted of trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole alone.
After 12 weeks, fluconazole was discontinued 
and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole or the fixed-
dose combination was continued in the enhanced-
prophylaxis group; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxa-
zole was continued or switched to the fixed-dose 
combination in the standard-prophylaxis group. 
The use of isoniazid–pyridoxine beyond the 12-
week period depended on national guidelines for 
the use of isoniazid preventive therapy. Screen-

Enhanced Prophylaxis for HIV Infection in Africa
ing for active tuberculosis before randomization 
was performed with the use of a WHO-based 
symptom checklist (see the Methods section in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org). Sputum 
samples were examined and chest radiography 
was performed in centers where such evaluation 
was possible. Patients who were already receiv-
ing antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis or 
who needed such therapy were treated regardless 
of randomization but received other prophylaxis 
according to randomization.
Randomization was stratified according to 
trial center, age (<13 years vs. ≥13 years), and 
other factorial randomizations (12 weeks of addi-
tional raltegravir vs. no raltegravir and 12 weeks 
of additional ready-to-use supplementary food 
vs. no supplementary food). A computer-generated 
sequential randomization list with variably sized 
permuted blocks was prepared by the trial stat-
istician and incorporated securely into the online 
trial database. The list was concealed until eligi-
bility was confirmed by staff members at the 
local center, who then performed the random-
ization.
Patients discontinued their participation in the 
trial after 48 weeks. At weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 
36, and 48, a nurse reviewed a symptom check-
list and asked patients about their adherence to 
the trial drugs, and a pharmacist dispensed the 
trial drugs. At weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48, a 
physician took a medical history and performed 
a physical examination; laboratory testing that 
included a full blood count, CD4+ count, and 
evaluation of kidney and renal function was per-
formed (with testing of kidney and renal func-
tion performed only at weeks 4 and 48); and 
plasma was stored for retrospective evaluation of 
the HIV viral load. All the nurses and physicians 
were aware of the trial-group assignments; all 
testing was performed in a blinded manner. At 
the physicians’ discretion, antiretroviral drugs 
could be substituted in cases of drug toxicity; in 
cases of first-line drug failure, regimens could 
be switched to second-line regimens, according 
to WHO guidelines.18
Following the factorial design, all the patients 
also underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive 12 weeks of additional raltegravir or no 
raltegravir and to receive 12 weeks of ready-to-
use supplementary food or no routine supple-
mentation. The results of these analyses are not 
reported here. Full details regarding the trial 
design and analyses are provided in the protocol, 
available at NEJM.org.
Trial Oversight
Gilead Sciences, ViiV Healthcare/GlaxoSmithKline, 
Cipla, and Merck donated the antiretroviral drugs, 
Cipla donated the prophylaxis drugs, and ready-
to-use supplementary food was purchased from 
Valid International. Representatives of the drug 
manufacturers had no role in the trial design, 
data collection, data analysis, or manuscript prep-
aration. All the authors vouch for the complete-
ness and accuracy of the data and all analyses, 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
The primary outcome was death from any cause 
occurring from randomization to 24 weeks. Sec-
ondary outcomes, which were evaluated through 
48 weeks, were death from any cause; serious 
adverse events, grade 4 adverse events, and ad-
verse events leading to modification of ART or 
other trial drugs; mechanisms of each interven-
tion, including a change in the CD4+ count; in-
cidence of tuberculosis, cryptococcal infection, 
candidiasis (esophageal or oral), and severe bacte-
rial infections; changes in weight or BMI; hospi-
talization; and patient-reported adherence to and 
acceptability of the ART regimen. Adverse events 
were graded according to the criteria of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health.19,20 Other outcomes 
included WHO stage 3 or 4 events.18 An end-
point review committee whose members were 
unaware of trial-group assignments and trial 
drugs received used protocol-defined criteria 
and grading tables19,20 to adjudicate all the sec-
ondary clinical outcomes that were reported by 
the trial physicians, along with determining the 
relatedness of the outcome to a trial drug and 
compatibility with IRIS. (Details regarding the 
trial outcomes are provided in the Methods sec-
tion in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Economic Analysis and Quality of Life
We performed economic analyses to estimate 
costs and health outcomes during the 48-week 
trial using data on resources used in the trial 
and published unit costs for each country. Health 
was measured on the basis of quality-adjusted 
life-years, according to the three-level EuroQol 
Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire,

The value of each health state was assigned with 
the use of a Zimbabwean value set.21
Statistical Analysis
We determined that the enrollment of 1800 
adults and children would provide a power of 
more than 80% to detect a rate of death from 
any cause that was 50% lower in the enhanced-
prophylaxis group than in the standard-prophy-
laxis group at 24 weeks (a reduction in mortality 
from 7.0% to 3.5%) at a two-sided alpha level of 
0.05, allowing for a 5% loss to follow-up. An 
independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee used the Haybittle–Peto approach to re-
view interim data at three annual meetings. We 
used the intention-to-treat principle to compare 
the randomized groups using log-rank tests or 
competing-risks methods for time-to-event out-
comes, exact tests for binary outcomes, and gen-
eralized estimating equations with independent 
working correlation for global tests of repeated 
measures. The primary analyses were stratified 
according to the factors used to stratify the ran-
domization, with no adjustment for multiple 
testing. All the analyses were performed with 
the use of Stata software, version 14.2.
Results
Trial Patients
A total of 1805 patients underwent randomiza-
tion to receive enhanced prophylaxis (906 patients) 
or standard prophylaxis (899 patients) (Fig. 1). 
The baseline characteristics of the patients were 
well balanced in the two groups (Table 1, and 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
median age was 36 years; 72 patients (4.0%) 
were 5 to 17 years of age. The median CD4+ 
count was 37 cells per cubic millimeter, and 
1300 of 1763 patients (73.7%) had a viral load of 
at least 100,000 copies per milliliter. Despite 
these findings, 854 patients (47.3%) were asymp-
tomatic or mildly symptomatic (WHO clinical 
disease stage, 1 to 2).
Before randomization, 174 patients (9.6%) were 
receiving isoniazid treatment and 196 (10.9%) 
were receiving fluconazole treatment; 3 (0.2%) and 
9 (0.5%), respectively, were receiving the drugs 
as prophylaxis. More patients in the standard-
prophylaxis group than in the enhanced-prophy-
laxis group were prescribed fluconazole, azithro-
mycin, or other antibiotics at randomization, a 
difference that probably reflected additional use 
for treating oral candidiasis or minor bacterial 
infections. All the patients initiated ART at a 
median of 5 days after screening, predominantly 
with first-line tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efa-
virenz.
A total of 56 patients (3.1%) — 24 in the 
enhanced-prophylaxis group and 32 in the stan-
dard-prophylaxis group — were lost to follow-up 
(i.e., no clinic attendance for >91 days) (P 
= 
0.28). 
At last follow-up, 1765 patients (97.8%) were still 
receiving first-line ART, of whom 119 (6.6%) had 
made within-class substitutions. There was no 
significant between-group difference in the per-
centage of patients who missed at least one 
scheduled visit before death or loss to follow-up 
(11.6% [105 patients] in the enhanced-prophy-
laxis group and 11.9% [107 patients] in the 
standard-prophylaxis group, P 
= 
0.84).
Receipt of Prophylaxis and Treatment
During the first 12 weeks after the initiation of 
ART, patients in the enhanced-prophylaxis group 
were prescribed isoniazid prophylaxis for 84.4% 
of person-time and isoniazid treatment for 
11.3% of person-time, as compared with 3.6% 
and 10.7% of person-time, respectively, in the 
standard-prophylaxis group. Patients in the en-
hanced-prophylaxis group were prescribed flu-
conazole prophylaxis for 96.7% of person-time 
and fluconazole treatment for 1.9% of person-
time, as compared with 0.3% and 2.6% of person-
time, respectively, in the standard-prophylaxis 
group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
All the patients in the enhanced-prophylaxis 
group were prescribed azithromycin and alben-
dazole (Table 1).
At 12 weeks, a substantial proportion of the 
patients in the standard-prophylaxis group initi-
ated isoniazid preventive therapy (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Thus, from 12 week to 
48 weeks, the patients in the enhanced-prophy-
laxis group were prescribed isoniazid prophylaxis 
for 46.3% of person-time and isoniazid treatment 
for 3.2% of person-time, as compared with 54.8% 
and 3.2% of person-time, respectively, in the 
standard-prophylaxis group. In contrast, after 12 
weeks, patients in the enhanced-prophylaxis group 
were prescribed fluconazole prophylaxis for 2.3% 
of person-time and fluconazole treatment for 
0.7% of person-time, as compared with 0.5%

Enhanced Prophylaxis for HIV Infection in Africa
and 0.8% of person-time, respectively, in the 
standard-prophylaxis group.
During the first 12 weeks, the patient-reported 
rate of adherence to prophylaxis was slightly 
(but significantly) poorer in the enhanced-pro-
phylaxis group than in the standard-prophylaxis 
group (P 
= 
0.004); for example, 7.4% and 5.2% of 
the patients, respectively, reported that they had 
missed any doses of prophylaxis drugs (including 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) between weeks 
8 and 12. However, during weeks 12 to 48, the 
adherence rates were similar in the two groups 
(P 
= 
0.30), as were rates of patient-reported ac-
ceptability of the drugs (Fig. S3B and S3C in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Mortality at 24 Weeks and 48 Weeks
Death by 24 weeks (the primary outcome) was 
reported in 80 patients in the enhanced-prophy-
laxis group and in 108 in the standard-prophy-
laxis group (8.9% vs. 12.2% by Kaplan–Meier 
analysis; hazard ratio in the enhanced-prophy-
laxis group, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.55 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.03 by the log-rank test) 
(Fig. 2A). Thus, at 24 weeks, 30 patients would 
need to have received enhanced prophylaxis to 
prevent 1 death. A significant survival benefit 
was maintained through 48 weeks, with deaths 
reported in 98 patients in the enhanced-prophy-
laxis group and in 127 in the standard-prophy-
laxis group (11.0% vs. 14.4% by Kaplan–Meier 
Figure 1. Enrollment and Randomization.
Patients could have more than one reason for exclusion; they could also be lost to follow-up without withdrawal of 
consent and vice versa, so the total numbers of patients with exclusions and discontinuations are lower than the 
sums of the individual categories. Details regarding the patients’ adherence to treatment are provided in Figure S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix.

P 
= 
0.04 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2A). Thus, at 
48 weeks, 29 patients would need to have re-
ceived enhanced prophylaxis to prevent 1 death. 
There was no evidence that benefits varied over 
time (P 
= 
0.49 for interaction in the comparison 
of 0 to 24 weeks vs. 24 to 48 weeks) and no evi-
dence of interaction with other factorial random-
izations to additional raltegravir or supplemen-
tary food (P>0.70).
The most common primary cause of death 
was infection in 92 of 225 deaths (40.9%) (Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Causes of 
death were often multifactorial; many occurred 
at home, and a clear cause was not determined. 
As adjudicated by the end-point review commit-
tee, deaths from cryptococcus infection and from 
unascertained causes occurred less frequently 
in the enhanced-prophylaxis group than in the 
standard-prophylaxis group (P 
=

respectively), but there was no evidence of sig-
nificant between-group differences in the rates 
of death from tuberculosis (P 
= 
0.72), presump-
tive bacterial infections (P 
= 
0.63), or other causes 
(P 
= 
0.85) (Fig. 2B). There was marginal evidence 
that IRIS-compatible deaths were less common 
with enhanced prophylaxis than with standard 
prophylaxis (P 
= 
0.06). (Details are provided in the 
Results section in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Estimated rates of death were highest on day 
18, when the absolute difference between en-
hanced prophylaxis and standard prophylaxis 
was greatest; these rates then decreased sharply 
through week 12. The rate of death from unas-
certained causes followed a similar pattern to 
that of known causes (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
There was no evidence that the mortality ben-
efit varied across nine preplanned subgroups, 
including the other randomizations (P>0.20). In 
particular, there was no evidence that mortality 
benefits depended on the CD4+ count at the 
initiation of ART (P 
= 
0.29 for the interaction 
with categories of CD4+ count; P 
= 
0.89 for the 
interaction with the CD4+ count as a continuous 
variable). Of nine exploratory subgroup analyses, 
only one suggested that benefits from enhanced 
prophylaxis might be greater among male patients 
than among female patients (P 
= 
0.048) (Fig. S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary Outcomes at 48 Weeks
Enhanced prophylaxis was associated with signifi-
cantly lower rates of WHO stage 3 or 4 events or 
death than was standard prophylaxis (in 179 pa-
tients [19.8%] vs. 224 [24.9%], P 
= 
0.008), along 
with lower rates of a new diagnosis of tubercu-
losis (in 64 patients [7.1%] vs. 92 [10.2%], 
P 
= 
0.02), cryptococcal infection (9 [1.0%] vs. 23 
[2.6%], P 
= 
0.01), candidiasis (10 [1.1%] vs. 23 
[2.6%], P 
= 
0.02), and new hospitalization (154 
[17.0%] vs. 186 [20.7%], P 
= 
0.03) (Fig. 3, and 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The total number of days of hospitalization 
were 2233 with enhanced prophylaxis and 2819 
with standard prophylaxis (P 
= 
0.057 by the rank-
sum test) during a total of 184 hospitalizations 
and 247 hospitalizations, respectively (P<0.001 
by Poisson regression). There was a significantly 
lower rate of IRIS-compatible events (as adjudi-
cated by the end-point review committee) with 
enhanced prophylaxis than with standard pro-
phylaxis (in 67 patients [7.4%] vs. 108 [12.0%], 
P 
= 
0.001). There was no evidence of a between-
group difference in the rate of new presumptive 
severe bacterial infections (in 42 patients [4.6%] 
vs. 33 [3.7%], P 
= 
0.32).
There was marginal evidence of a lower rate of 
serious adverse events in the enhanced-prophylax-
is group than in the standard-prophylaxis group 
(P 
= 
0.08) and of a lower rate of grade 4 adverse 
events (P 
= 
0.09) (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), findings that were strengthened in 
exploratory analyses that included subsequent 
events (P 
= 
0.002 for serious adverse events and 
P 
= 
0.01 for grade 4 adverse events by Poisson re-
gression) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). There was no evidence of a between-group 
difference in grade 3 or 4 adverse events (P 
= 
0.31), 
in grade 4 adverse events that were adjudicated 
by the end-point review committee as “definitely 
or probably” related to any prophylaxis drug 
(P 
= 
0.27) or as “definitely, probably, or possibly” 
related to any prophylaxis drug (P 
= 
0.50), or in 
adverse events leading to the discontinuation of 
a prophylaxis drug (P 
= 
0.97). Enhanced prophy-
laxis was discontinued in 14 patients (1.5%) be-
cause of toxicity involving the liver (in 7 patients), 
skin (in 4), or blood (in 3) (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
There was no evidence that the patient-reported 
rate of adherence to ART (based on any missed 
dose in the previous 4 weeks) differed between 
the two groups (P 
= 
0.31) (Fig. S3D in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Consistent with this finding, 
there was no significant between-group differ-
ence in the suppression of the HIV viral load to 
fewer than 50 copies per milliliter (P 
= 
0.52) or in 
the CD4+ count (P 
= 
0.42) (Fig. 4A and 4B). At 24 
weeks after ART initiation, 601 of 785 patients 
(76.6%) in the enhanced-prophylaxis group and 
557 of 738 (75.5%) in the standard-prophylaxis 
group had an HIV viral load of fewer than 50 cop-
ies per milliliter (P 
= 
0.62), and the mean (±SD) 
increase in the CD4+ count was 113±3.1 cells 
with enhanced prophylaxis versus 112±3.1 with 
standard prophylaxis (P 
= 
0.85). In adolescents 
and adults who received enhanced prophylaxis, 
there were nonsignificantly greater increases in 
BMI (P 
= 
0.053) (Fig. 4C) and weight (P 
= 
0.051).
Quality of Life and Cost-Effectiveness

is group had a higher number of quality-adjusted

life-years and life-years gained than did those in 
the standard-prophylaxis group, improvements 
that came at a higher financial cost (Tables S6 
and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Con-
comitant medications and antiretroviral drugs 
were more costly with enhanced prophylaxis 
than with standard prophylaxis because of the 
use of the intervention drugs and longer survival 
(mean cost of concomitant medications, $34.79 
vs. $16.73); however, hospitalizations were more 
costly with standard prophylaxis. On the basis 
of actual within-country drug costs, the cost of 
enhanced prophylaxis was $761 per quality-
adjusted life-year and $613 per life-year gained 
through 48 weeks; these prices were reduced to 
$201 and $162, respectively, on the basis of 
minimum drug costs across the four countries 
in the trial.
Discussion
Among HIV-infected adults and older children 
with advanced immunosuppression who initiated 
ART, the relative rate of death at 24 weeks was 
27% lower among those who received an en-
hanced antimicrobial prophylaxis package than 
among those who received trimethoprim–sulfa-
methoxazole alone (standard prophylaxis) for 
12 weeks. Benefits were maintained through 48 
weeks (24% lower rate), with a number-needed-
to-treat of 29 to prevent one death. Patients who 
received enhanced prophylaxis also had a sig-
nificantly lower rate of hospitalization, WHO 
stage 3 or 4 events, IRIS-compatible events, tuber-
culosis, and cryptococcal and candida infections; 
the rate of presumptive bacterial infection was 
similar in the two groups. There was no evi-
dence of increased toxicity, poorer HIV viral-load 
suppression, or worse adherence to the ART regi-
men with enhanced prophylaxis; rather, there were 
nonsignificantly fewer serious adverse events and 
grade 4 adverse events.
Two trials have shown a lack of efficacy of 
an alternative approach to reducing early tuber-
culosis-related mortality through the initiation 
of preemptive tuberculosis treatment with four 
drugs at the time of ART initiation in all adults 
with severe immunosuppression.16,17 A third trial 
was terminated early because of low enroll-
ment22; a fourth is ongoing.23 Isoniazid prophy-

Enhanced Prophylaxis for HIV Infection in Africa
laxis is effective and is now recommended in 
WHO guidelines after the exclusion of active 
disease,15 but when our trial started, such treat-
ment was not standard care in any of the recruit-
ing countries. At that time, it had been imple-
mented in only 28% of African countries.24 The 
timing of the initiation of isoniazid prophylaxis 
is unspecified in the WHO guidelines. Barriers 
to uptake include poor availability of individual 
isoniazid–pyridoxine formulations and concern 
about toxicity, pill burden, and isoniazid resis-
tance. During the first 12 weeks after the ad-
ministration of single-dose albendazole and 
azithromycin (one pill once daily for 5 days), 
the enhanced-prophylaxis regimen in our trial 
required only one more pill per day than was 
required for standard prophylaxis; in addition, 
enhanced prophylaxis was associated with good 
rates of acceptability and adherence.25 Unfortu-
nately, we could not assess isoniazid resistance 
in new tuberculosis cases, since these investiga-
tions were not routinely performed at the trial 
centers. Previously, low rates of isoniazid resis-
tance have been reported with isoniazid preven-
tive therapy.26
To prevent cryptococcal disease, the WHO rec-
ommends testing for cryptococcal antigen in pa-
tients with a CD4+ count of fewer than 100 cells 
per cubic millimeter.1 Such screening and pre-
emptive treatment reduced early mortality in one 
trial,27 but screening tests may not be available 
at lower-level health facilities. We therefore evalu-
ated a lower-cost dose of fluconazole (100 mg) 
once daily for all patients with immunosuppres-
sion, administered during the first 12 weeks of 
ART, when CD4+ counts remain lowest. This 
dose was extrapolated from an effective dose of 
200 mg three times weekly among patients who 
tested negative for cryptococcal antigen and who 
had initiated ART with a CD4+ count of fewer 
than 200 cells per cubic millimeter.28 The rate of 
death associated with cryptococcal infection re-
mained significantly elevated for at least 12 weeks 
in the standard-prophylaxis group, a finding that 
supports this approach.
One of the limitations of our trial is that we 
tested an antimicrobial prophylaxis package, 
which made it difficult to quantify the effect of 
each component. In the enhanced-prophylaxis 
group, the rates of death and complications 
from cryptococcal infection were significantly 
lower than those in the standard-prophylaxis 
group, as was the rate of new tuberculosis infec-
tion but not the rate of death from tuberculosis. 
Another limitation of our trial is that although 
there was no significant between-group differ-
ence in the rate of severe bacterial infections, 
most of the diagnoses were presumptive because 
many centers lacked facilities for performing mi-
crobiologic analyses, and causes of death were 
frequently not ascertained because the patients 
died at home soon after randomization. How-
ever, the patients who received enhanced pro-
phylaxis had a lower rate of early death from 
unknown causes. Given the diagnostic challenges 
posed by severe bacterial infections and their 
major contribution to HIV-related mortality,3,9 it is 
likely that such infections contributed to deaths 
of unknown cause. Thus, azithromycin may pro-
vide additional protection over trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole, given its broad antimicrobial 
activity, longer half-life, antiinflammatory prop-
erties, and activity against nontuberculous myco-
bacteria.29 Concern regarding antimicrobial resis-
tance30 should be balanced against the potential 
for a substantial short-term mortality benefit in 
this high-risk population. Further mechanistic 
studies will be needed to determine the contri-
bution of each drug to the efficacy of enhanced 
prophylaxis and to assess whether omitting any 
component of the package could reduce its efficacy.
The cost of enhanced prophylaxis ranged 
from $8 to $34 across trial countries (Table S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix). However, drug 
costs varied by a factor of 10, which highlights 
the importance of ensuring that all countries can

access drugs at the lowest prices. At the mini-
mum price, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
falls within recently published cost-effectiveness 
thresholds for even the lowest-income countries.31 
This analysis does not capture the longer-term 
benefits associated with reduced mortality be-
yond 48 weeks, and the inclusion of such bene-
fits would further increase the value-for-money 
of enhanced prophylaxis.
We enrolled both adults and older children 
or adolescents because the rates and causes of 
death are similar regardless of age.7 We expected 
that 300 children over the age of 5 years would 
be enrolled, but we identified only 72 who had a 
CD4+ count of fewer than 100 cells per cubic 
millimeter. This finding may be due to improved 
coverage of ART to prevent mother-to-child HIV 
transmission.32 Although the numbers were 
lower than expected, there is no reason why the 
enhanced-prophylaxis package would not bene-
fit older children who are vulnerable to tubercu-
losis, cryptococcal infection, candidiasis, and 
helminths. In contrast, the trial recruited adults 
faster than expected, which suggests that large 
numbers of patients could benefit from enhanced 
prophylaxis. Nearly half of the patients had mini-
mal symptoms despite having a median CD4+ 
count of 37 cells per cubic millimeter, which 
shows the continued importance of obtaining 
CD4+ counts for the assessment of patients be-
fore ART initiation.33 Whether patients who ini-
tiate ART with a CD4+ count of 100 to 200 cells 
per cubic millimeter would also benefit from 
enhanced prophylaxis is unclear. However, two 
other groups with potentially low CD4+ counts 
may benefit from enhanced prophylaxis: those 
in whom ART has failed, especially if the pre-
ART CD4+ count was low,34 and those returning 
to care after they had been lost to follow-up.
Another limitation of our trial is its open-
label design, as necessitated by the multiple 
randomizations, weight-based pediatric dosing, 
and importance of comparing adherence and ac-
ceptability in the two groups. However, the pri-
mary mortality end point was objective. The 
pragmatic design meant that the patients who 
received standard prophylaxis also spent time 
receiving treatments or secondary prophylaxis as 
necessary, which probably reduced the differences 
between the groups. However, any dilution bias 
would lead to an underestimation of the benefits 
of enhanced prophylaxis.
In conclusion, we found a survival benefit for 
multicomponent enhanced antimicrobial prophy-
laxis in adults and older children with advanced 
HIV infection who were initiating ART with a 
CD4+ count of fewer than 100 cells per cubic 
millimeter — a group that represents a substan-
tial proportion of those starting treatment who 
are at increased risk for early death.4 The en-
hanced prophylaxis is relatively inexpensive, has 
a low pill burden and an acceptable side-effect 
profile, and would be easy to implement at pri-
mary health centers since it relies only on screen-
ing for clinical symptoms and testing of CD4+ 
counts to identify asymptomatic patients with 
advanced HIV infection.
