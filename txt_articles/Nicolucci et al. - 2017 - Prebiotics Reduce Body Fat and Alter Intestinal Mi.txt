BACKGROUND & AIMS: It might be possible to manipulate the
intestinal microbiota with prebiotics or other agents to prevent
or treat obesity. However, little is known about the ability of
prebiotics to specifically modify gut microbiota in children with
overweight/obesity or reduce body weight. We performed a
randomized controlled trial to study the effects of prebiotics on
body composition, markers of inflammation, bile acids in fecal
samples, and composition of the intestinal microbiota in chil-
dren with overweight or obesity. METHODS: We performed a
single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2 sepa-
rate cohorts (March 2014 and August 2014) at the University of
Calgary in Canada. Participants included children, 7–12 years
old, with overweight or obesity (>85th percentile of body mass
index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly
assigned to groups given either oligofructose-enriched inulin
(OI; 8 g/day; n¼22) or maltodextrin placebo (isocaloric dose,
controls; n¼20) once daily for 16 weeks. Fat mass and lean
mass were measured using dual-energy-x-ray absorptiometry.
Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured at
baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter. Blood samples were
collected at baseline and 16 weeks, and analyzed for lipids,
cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and insulin. Fecal samples were
collected at baseline and 16 weeks; bile acids were profiled
using
high-performance
liquid
chromatography
and
the
composition of the microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA
sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The
primary outcome was change in percent body fat from baseline
to 16 weeks. RESULTS: After 16 weeks, children who
consumed OI had significant decreases in body weight z-score
(decrease of 3.1%), percent body fat (decrease of 2.4%), and
percent trunk fat (decrease of 3.8%) compared with children
given placebo (increase of 0.5%, increase of 0.05%, and
decrease of 0.3%, respectively). Children who consumed OI also
had a significant reduction in level of interleukin 6 from
baseline (decrease of 15%) compared with the placebo group
(increase of 25%). There was a significant decrease in serum
triglycerides (decrease of 19%) in the OI group. Quantitative
polymerase chain reaction showed a significant increase in
Bifidobacterium spp. in the OI group compared with controls.
16S rRNA sequencing revealed significant increases in species
of the genus Bifidobacterium and decreases in Bacteroides
vulgatus within the group who consumed OI. In fecal samples,
levels of primary bile acids increased in the placebo group
but not in the OI group over the 16-week study period.
CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled, randomized trial, we
found a prebiotic (OI) to selectively alter the intestinal micro-
biota and significantly reduce body weight z-score, percent
body fat, percent trunk fat, and serum level of interleukin 6 in
children
with
overweight
or
obesity
(Clinicaltrials.gov
no: NCT02125955).

T
he largest community of microbes in the human
microbiota reside in the gut and, through a sym-
biotic relationship with the host, play a role in maintaining
health and metabolic homeostasis, including the produc-
tion of a diverse array of metabolites. Dysbiosis is associ-
ated
with
the
promotion
or
aggravation
of
chronic
metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes
(T2D).1 One trigger for metabolic disease relates to the gut
microbiota’s role in modulating inflammation whereby
elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is
exacerbated by a high-fat or high-fructose diet, induces a
low-grade
inflammatory
state
termed
metabolic
endotoxemia.2–4 A shift in metabolite production is also
observed with dysbiosis; this is particularly true for fecal
bile acids (FBA), which require the gut microbiota for
transformation.5 From a clinical stand point, there is great
interest in determining if modulating the gut microbiota is
a viable strategy to manage obesity and improve metabolic
health.
Consumption of prebiotics, which are non-digestible
food ingredients utilized by gut microorganisms and bene-
ficially affect host physiology, is one such strategy.6,7
Microbial shifts in response to prebiotic intake have

CLINICAL AT
 Lactobacillus, 2 common genera that may be increased with
prebiotics and are associated with their beneficial effects on
host health.6 However, with the understanding that global
community structure and microbial diversity is important
for intestinal and host health, there is a need to examine
broader microbial changes that occur in response to pre-
biotics, for example with sequencing approaches.7 This
approach is lacking in studies with children.
In a systematic review of clinical trials, prebiotic intake
was associated with a significant improvement in satiety,
postprandial glucose, and insulin concentrations in adult
subjects8. Consumption of an inulin/oligofructose blend has
also been shown to increase Bifidobacterium spp. and Fae-
calibacterium prausnitzii, which both negatively correlated
with LPS and Bifidobacterium spp. negatively correlated
with percent fat mass and low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol.9,10 These promising outcomes in adults justify the
assessment of prebiotics as a dietary intervention to
modulate gut microbiota and metabolic outcomes in pedi-
atric obesity.
Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adult-
hood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated
morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of
early intervention.11 The potential for prebiotics to influ-
ence body weight in children was suggested by the slowed
rate of weight gain observed in a trial assessing combined
prebiotic and calcium intake in non-obese healthy chil-
dren.12,13 To date, however, there is no research assessing
the totality of changes in gut microbiota in children with
overweight and obesity with prebiotic intervention. There is
also limited research assessing global microbial composition
of children with overweight and obesity with or without an
intervention. Therefore, our objective was to assess the ef-
fect of prebiotic supplementation on gut microbiota, FBAs,
and associated metabolic outcomes (body composition,
serum inflammatory markers, lipid profile, and fasting
glucose and insulin concentrations) in otherwise healthy
children with overweight and obesity.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Male and female children, aged 7–12 years with over-
weight or obesity (� 85th body mass index (BMI) percentile)
were voluntarily recruited from Calgary, Canada. This was a
single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted
in 2 separate cohorts (March 2014 and August 2014) at the
University of Calgary. Following screening, subjects were
randomly assigned using computer-generated numbers (and
stratified according to age, sex, and BMI) to either prebiotic
oligofructose-enriched inulin (OI) or placebo control malto-
dextrin for 16 weeks. The randomization was performed by
an investigator that did not interact with the subjects, and 1
research assistant was responsible for all product distribu-
tion. Randomization sequences were not revealed to the study
staff. Subjects and research staff were blinded to the treat-
ments that were provided in identical foil packets. Parents/
care givers completed a health and lifestyle questionnaire on
behalf of the subjects to assess eligibility. Eligible subjects
were otherwise healthy children with � 85th BMI percentile
at a Tanner developmental stage � 3 (assessed by physical
exam by a pediatric endocrinologist from the Alberta Chil-
dren’s Hospital, Calgary, Canada). Exclusion criteria included
type 1 or 2 diabetes, liver disease, cardiovascular abnormal-
ities, supplement or medication use influencing appetite,
weight or metabolism, currently following a weight loss diet,
> 3 kg weight loss 12 weeks before the initial test day,
extreme changes in exercise intensity 4 weeks prior, or anti-
biotic use < 3 months prior.
This study, which was powered on the primary objective of
reduction in percent body fat with 80% power and a ¼ .05,
required a minimum of 18 subjects per group.14 An additional 4
subjects were added per group to compensate for a potential
20% drop-out rate.8 Ethics approval was received from the
Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of
Calgary, REB13-0975. Written and informed consent was pro-
vided by the parents and verbal assent was provided by the
subjects before the initial test day.
Dietary Intervention
Subjects were randomized to consume either 8 g/day (13.2
kcal/d) of OI, (Synergy1; BENEO GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
or an isocaloric dose of 3.3 g/day of maltodextrin placebo
(Agenamalt 20.222; Agrana, Konstanz, Germany). Maltodextrin
has a similar taste and appearance to Synergy1 and has been
used previously in prebiotic trials.8 The prebiotic and placebo
were consumed as a powder and provided to participants in
pre-weighed individual packets. Participants and their par-
ent(s) were instructed to dissolve an entire packet in 250 mL of
water in a provided reusable water bottle. They were instruc-
ted to consume half the dose for the first 2 weeks, to promote
adaptation and mitigate gastrointestinal symptoms, and the full
dose for the remaining 14 weeks, 15–20 minutes before their
evening meal. Empty and unused packets were returned to
measure compliance. Our objective was to examine the effects
of the prebiotic supplementation independent of any other
lifestyle changes; therefore, subjects purchased their own food,
were instructed to eat until comfortably full, and maintain their
usual level of physical activity. An informal interview was

Physical Characteristics and Body Composition
Fat mass and lean mass were measured using whole-body
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic QDR 4500;
Hologic, Inc, Bedford, MA). Android and gynoid fat was esti-
mated using the Hologic QDR software according to Arnberg
et al.15 The android to gynoid fat ratio (A:G) was calculated as
[android fat mass/gynoid fat mass]. Height, weight, and waist
circumference were measured in duplicate at baseline and
every 4 weeks thereafter. Height and weight z-scores were
calculated using the Baylor College of Medicine-Body Compo-
sition

completed the Godin’s Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire17
at the initial, mid, and final test days.
Blood Analysis
A fasted blood sample was obtained at baseline and final
test days. Serum lipids were analyzed by Calgary Lab Services
(Calgary, Canada). Serum inflammatory cytokines were quan-
tified using Human Adipokine Milliplex kits (Millipore, St.
Charles, MO) and Luminex instrument at Eve Technologies
(Calgary, AB, Canada). Plasma LPS was measured using the
Pyro-Gene Recombinant Factor C Endotoxin Detection assay
(Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) and fasted plasma
glucose using the Glucose Trinder assay (Stanbio Laboratory,
Boerne, TX). Fasting insulin was quantified using a Human In-
sulin ELISA kit (Millipore) and insulin resistance estimated
using the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance
2 (HOMA2-IR).18
FBA Analysis
FBAs were profiled using high-performance liquid chro-
matography.19 Briefly, lyophilized, powdered fecal samples
(10–20 mg) were suspended in water (250 mL) and heated for
10 minutes at 90�C. Samples were cooled then incubated for
16 hours at 37�C after adding 250 mL of sodium acetate buffer
(100 mmol/L, pH 5.6) containing 15 units of cholylglycine
hydrolase and 150 units of sulfatase. Isopropanol (500 mL)
and 1 mol/L NaOH (100 mL) were then added and alkaline
hydrolysis was performed by incubating 2.5 hours at 60�C. An
internal standard (nordeoxycholic acid, 50 nmol/L) and 3 mL
of 0.1 mol/L NaOH was added and FBAs were extracted
through ultrasonication for 1 hour. After centrifugation, the
supernatant was collected and cleaned using a Sep Pak tC18
cartridge where the FBAs were eluted with 6 mL of methanol.
The eluate was dried under Speedvac at 40�C. The unconju-
gated FBAs were derivatized by adding 150 mL of triethyl-
amine (10 mL/mL) and 2-acetobromophenone (12 mg/mL) to
their 24-phenacyl esters under ultrasonication for 1.5 hours
at 50�C. The derivatized FBAs were further cleaned using a
Sep-Pak silica cartridge and the eluate was dried under
Speedvac at 30�C. The derivatized samples were suspended in
82% methanol and filtered through a 3 kDa centrifuge filter
before injecting into the high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy. Individual bile acid (BA) 24-phenacyl esters were
detected at l254nm.
Gut Bacterial Community Profiling–16S rRNA
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
Subjects and parent(s) were instructed to collect a stool
sample preferably the evening before but up to 3 days before
baseline and final test days using a stool collection kit. Stool
was placed in a sterile conical tube and stored in a biohazard
bag in the participant’s home freezer. Samples were brought to
the laboratory on ice and stored at -80�C until analysis. Total
bacterial DNA was extracted using FastDNA Spin Kit for Feces
(MP Biomedicals, Lachine, QC, Canada) and quantified using the
Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA).
All samples were diluted to 4 ng/mL before storage at -30�C.
Amplification and detection was conducted in 96-well plates
with SYBR Green qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Master Mix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to our previous
work20 using group specific primers.21
Gut Bacterial Community Profiling–16S rRNA
Illumina Sequencing
Ethanol precipitation was performed on extracted bacterial
DNA to ensure a purified sample. Quantification was performed
using Qubit dsDNA assay (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY)
and diluted to 5 ng/mL working concentration. Microbial
profiling was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq platform,
according to the Illumina 16S Metagenomics Sequencing Li-
brary Preparation protocol and in accordance with our previ-
ous work22 (Centre for Health Genomics and Informatics,
Calgary, AB, Canada). Primary PCRs amplified the V3-V4 region
of the 16S rRNA gene and secondary PCRs attached dual indices
to
amplified
regions
with
manufacturer
recommended
primers.22 Sequencing was performed with dual indexed paired
300 bps. Results were approximately 20 million total reads.
Gut Bacterial Community Analysis - 16S rRNA
Illumina Sequencing
Because of poor merging between the primers, the V3 re-
gion was selected for the analysis as it consisted of higher
quality sequences. Microbial community analysis was per-
formed as described in Krumbeck et al.23 Sequences were
trimmed to 250 nts and filtered using the FASTX-toolkit. Chi-
meras were removed and operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
with 98% homology were generated using USEARCH. Se-
quences were classified from phylum to genus level using the
Ribosomal Database Project MultiClassifier. Alpha and beta-
diversity metrics were calculated in QIIME using rarefied data
to control for the number of sequences in each sample. All
taxonomic data was calculated as proportions of sequences
based on the total number of sequences for each sample.
Statistical Analysis–Biological and
qPCR Outcomes
Data were presented as mean ± SEM. Analysis was per-
formed on an intent-to-treat basis, regardless of subject
compliance or completion. Cases with missing outcomes were
excluded from analysis for that outcome. Normality was veri-
fied for each outcome and corresponding non-parametric tests
were conducted on outcomes with a skewed distribution.
Parametric tests were used to compare baseline measurements
(independent t-test), between-group differences using mean

 differences from the 2 time points (independent t-test) and
within-group differences (dependent t-test). Outcomes were
further analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
assessing for sex, age, and BMI as potential covariates. Height,
body weight, and waist circumference, which were measured
multiple times, were analyzed using a mixed model repeated
measures ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment.
Statistical Analysis–16S rRNA
Illumina Sequencing
Data were presented as mean ± SD. All statistical analysis
was performed using R version 3.2.2.24 Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests were used to analyze within-group differences for mi-
crobial groups and alpha-diversity. Between-group differences
were evaluated using linear mixed-effect model with package
“lme4” assessing the interaction between treatment groups and
time.25 Beta-diversity was assessed based on Bray-Curtis dis-
tances and significance was determined using an analysis of
similarities (ANOSIM) with the “vegan” package.26 To account
for multiple comparisons an false discovery rate (FDR)
correction was applied with the “fdrtool” package.27 For cor-
rected P values, significance was set at < .2.
All authors had access to study data and reviewed and
approved the final manuscript.
Results
Subject Characteristics
A total of 42 subjects consented to participate in the
study of which 22 were randomized to the prebiotic group
and 20 to the placebo. A total of 4 subjects withdrew for
personal reasons (time constraints) or otherwise not spec-
ified (Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, a total of 38
children, 20 in the prebiotic group and 18 in the control
group, completed the study (90% retention). There were no
significant differences in baseline characteristics between
the groups (Table 1). A total of 81.8% of participants were
white and 18.2% classified as “Other” (represented by black
and Hispanic).
Improvements in Anthropometry and Body
Composition With Prebiotic
Prebiotic consumption slowed weight gain compared
with placebo. Although absolute body weight increased in
both groups over 16 weeks, the increase was significantly
higher in placebo (2.4-fold greater weight gain) compared
with prebiotic (Table 2). Age and sex-specific analysis of
body weight showed significant decreases in body weight
z-score within the prebiotic group (P ¼ .006). The interac-
tion of treatment and time significantly influenced BMI
(P ¼ .009) whereby there was no change in BMI within the
prebiotic group compared with baseline, but at all 4 time
points compared with baseline, BMI significantly increased
in the placebo group (Supplementary Figure 2). Percent
total body fat was significantly lower with OI compared with
placebo (P ¼ .005; Figure 1). Both groups had a significant
increase in lean mass. Regional body fat assessment showed
significant decreases in percent trunk fat within the prebi-
otic group (P ¼ .019) and significant differences between
the groups (P ¼ .029). Percent android fat tended to be
reduced in prebiotic vs placebo (P ¼ .055).
Prebiotics Induced Marginal Changes in
Systemic Inflammation
There was little change in the serum inflammatory
profile
within
the
prebiotic
and
placebo
groups
(Supplementary Table 1). Although there was a 31%
decrease in serum C-reactive protein in the prebiotic group
and an 8% increase in the placebo group, this was not
significantly different. Between-group analysis did show a
significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-6 from baseline with
OI, whereas placebo increased (P ¼ .01). There was a trend
(P ¼ .088) for LPS to be decreased (-1.9�) with OI intake
and increased with placebo (1.4�).
Metabolic Outcomes
There was a significant decrease in serum triglycerides
within the prebiotic group, but no between-group differ-
ences in lipid profile (Supplementary Table 2). There were
no differences in fasting glucose, insulin, or HOMA2-IR
within or between groups. At the end of the trial, howev-
er, 4 of the subjects in the prebiotic group (3 male, 1 female,
baseline BMI 29.0 ± 2.9 kg/m2, baseline percent total body
fat 46.7 ± 2.2%, baseline trunk fat 46.7 ± 2.2%, baseline
HOMA2-IR 2.5 ± 0.2), compared with zero in the placebo
group, were no longer classified as insulin-resistant as
defined by HOMA2-IR (HOMA2-IR > 2.10).28
Fecal Bile Acids
Primary FBAs, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA) were significantly different between the OI and
placebo group after adjusting for age, sex, initial BMI, and
compliance (Table 3). Within-group analysis showed sig-
nificant increases in both primary FBAs in the placebo

FBAs within or between treatment groups. The percentage
of
CDCA
to
total
FBAs
(CDCA%)
was
significantly
increased within the placebo group over time and the
between-group difference showed a higher percentage in
placebo vs OI.
Characterization of Gut Microbial Changes
Quantitative analysis of specific taxa (qPCR) showed a
within-group difference of increased Bifidobacterium spp. in
prebiotic (P ¼ .023) and decreased Clostridium cluster XI
(P ¼ .044) in placebo (Supplementary Table 3). A significant
between-group difference was seen for Bifidobacterium spp.
with OI intake resulting in significantly higher abundance
than placebo at 16 weeks (P ¼ .049). The change in Bifi-
dobacterium spp. from baseline was also significantly
different between the prebiotic and placebo group (1.71% ±
0.80 vs 0.13% ± 0.94, P ¼ .049).
A community-wide analysis with Illumina 16S rRNA
sequencing mirrored the outcomes from qPCR (Table 4). OI
consumption resulted in a significant bifidogenic response
over the 16 weeks within the prebiotic group. Actino-
bacteria, the only observed phylum level change, signifi-
cantly increased 1.4 fold (P ¼ .008, FDR¼0.217) and at the

abundance
significantly
increased. Moreover, 2 OTUs most likely representing Bifi-
dobacterium adolescentis (OTU_2169) and Bifidobacterium
longum (OTU_2403) significantly increased. Between-group
analysis highlighted an interaction effect of treatment and
time on Bifidobacterium longum (OTU_14) although not
statistically significant (Supplementary Table 4).
Further analysis of within- and between-group differ-
ences showed significant changes in bacterial community
composition beyond Bifidobacterium. Within-group anal-
ysis showed significant decreases in Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii (OTU_2516) abundance with prebiotic (P ¼
.002, FDR¼0.153) (Table 4). The interaction between
treatment and time significantly influenced 2 separate
OTUs
representing
F.
prausnitzii
(OTU_2516
and
OTU_1938) (Supplementary Table 4). Although no signifi-
cant changes in the Bacteroidetes phylum or the genus
Bacteroides were observed, Bacteroides sp. (OTU_29) was
significantly influenced by the interaction of treatment and
time. OTU level analysis of within-group differences
revealed OI significantly decreased Bacteroides vulgatus
(OTU_2492, P ¼ .005, FDR¼0.155) (Table 4). Significant
decreases in OTU_2376 representing Ruminococcus gauv-
reauii were also observed with consumption of OI, whereas
decreases observed in genus Ruminococcus were not sta-
tistically significant following
adjustment (P ¼ .026,
FDR¼0.311).
The Shannon and Simpson Index, which were used to
assess alpha-diversity, significantly decreased within both
groups and no significant change in observed OTUs was
detected within either group (Table 4). Beta-diversity,
assessed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots
based on Bray-Curtis distances, revealed differential clus-
tering within the prebiotic group from baseline to 16 weeks

Microbial Correlations With Clinical Biomarkers
Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to assess the
relationship between changes in gut microbial abundance
and changes in body composition and biological parameters
(Figure 2). When assessing correlations with change in body
composition, changes in body weight (rs¼0.414, P ¼ .012),
fat mass (rs¼0.358, P ¼ .032), and BMI (rs¼0.373, P ¼ .025)
were significantly and positively correlated with changes in
OTU_2559 representing Clostridium clostridioforme and
change in trunk body fat was significantly and positively
correlated with change in Bacteroides vulgatus (OTU_2492)
(rs¼0.494, P ¼ .002) and change in bacterium mpn-isolate
(OTU_1554) (rs¼0.394, P ¼ .017). Change in OTU_2559 was
also significantly and positively correlated with changes in
IL-6 (rs¼0.657, P ¼ .0001), whereas change in serum tri-
glycerides was significantly and positively correlated with

Side Effects and Compliance
No gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by
70% of participants in the prebiotic group and 61.1% in the
placebo. A mild increase in flatulence and bloating was
experienced by 25% and 27.8% of subjects in prebiotic and
placebo, respectively. A moderate increase in flatulence and
bloating was reported by 5% and 11.1% of subjects in
prebiotic and placebo, respectively. During the informal
interview to assess blinding, 50% of the prebiotic group and
72.2% of the placebo group were able to correctly guess
their grouping. There was 87% and 91% compliance in the

Discussion
This is the first randomized controlled study to assess
the totality of changes in gut microbial composition and
FBAs with prebiotic intervention in children with over-
weight and obesity. The results demonstrate that OI con-

 body and trunk body fat, modifies primary FBAs, and
selectively alters gut microbiota.
Although weight loss is a key outcome in obesity in-
terventions, pediatric trials must consider the confounding
effects of growth. One other trial with prebiotics in youth29
did not observe a reduction in absolute body weight with OI,
which is consistent with our findings. However, height and
weight are expected to increase linearly in children 6–10
years old with little difference between the sexes; in
particular, body weight is expected to increase 2–3 kg
annually.30 Based on our 4-month intervention data, the
annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic
group would be 3 kg, within the expected range, whereas
the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kg, almost
triple the expected yearly increase. The normalization of
absolute body weight gain with OI is important because it
allowed children to meet and not exceed expected growth
trends.29 This normalization may be attributed in part to the
improved appetite control we previously demonstrated in
the OI group.31
In the present study, the reduction in percent body fat
observed in the subjects consuming OI was similarly
observed by Abrams et al13 as a reduction in total fat mass
in normal weight and overweight children consuming 8 g of
OI with supplemental calcium for a year. Important from a
metabolic health perspective,32 percent trunk fat was

 decreased in our participants consuming OI, which was
similarly observed in adults with overweight and obesity
consuming oligofructose for 12 weeks.8 The decrease in
central adiposity in the present study could explain in part
the significant reduction in serum triglycerides observed in
the prebiotics group.
A proposed mechanistic link between obesity and its
associated comorbidities, such as insulin resistance, is low-
grade inflammation. Increased IL-6 and TNF-a are seen in
adult obesity,33 while C-reactive protein is positively
correlated with obesity in children and adults.33,34 In
healthy, normal-weight adults, there was no change in
cytokines following prebiotic intake, likely because base-
line levels were not elevated enough to detect differ-
ences.35 This is likely the case in our subjects as well, given
that IL-6 was the only cytokine significantly reduced with
prebiotic and greater inflammation is typically needed to
see a treatment response.36,37 We did observe a trend to-
ward a reduction in metabolic endotoxemia, which is
consistent with reduced LPS seen with inulin-type fructan
intake in otherwise healthy obese adults, healthy normal
weight adults, and overweight and obese women with
T2D.9,35,38–40
Microbial metabolites, such as FBAs, are 1 potential
mechanism through which changes in gut microbiota
composition impact host physiology.41 Increased primary
FBAs have been associated with negative clinical outcomes,
including diarrhea-prominent irritable bowel syndrome,
which was associated with a significant decrease in Bifido-
bacterium.5 Of relevance to obesity, increased serum levels
of the primary BA, CDCA relative to total BAs (CDCA%) was
seen in obesity with T2D > obesity > overweight > healthy
control.42 There was also a positive correlation between
CDCA%
and
BMI,
HbA1c,
LDL-cholesterol,
and
tri-
glycerides.42 In our participants, no change in fecal CDCA%
was seen in the OI group (albeit a numerical but not sig-
nificant decrease) but there was a significant 17% increase
in the placebo group over time. It is possible that intake of
OI mitigated the natural trajectory of increased primary
FBAs seen in the placebo group, in part through increased
Bifidobacterium.43
Although our current understanding of what constitutes
a healthy microbiota is still incomplete, certain genera have
been established as primarily beneficial, including species in
the genus Bifidobacterium.44 Infant studies highlight the
benefits of increased bifidobacteria, with Bifidobacterium
spp. dominating the gut of breast-fed infants that is asso-
ciated with a reduced likelihood of overweight and obesity
in childhood.45,46 Similarly, adults with obesity had a sig-
nificant reduction in Bifidobacterium spp. compared with
healthy weight.47 Our analysis of microbial changes at the
genus level showed sequencing results that mirrored those
from qPCR. Significant increases in Bifidobacterium spp.
within the prebiotic group in this study was the only mi-
crobial change when assessed with qPCR, which was also
observed in diverse adult cohorts consuming various pre-
biotics.9,10,35 Sequencing analysis in the present study also
showed significant increases in OTUs representing Bifido-
bacterium such as Bifidobacterium longum (OTU_2403),
which was similarly observed after prebiotic supplementa-
tion in women with obesity.10 In the adult human gut, sig-
nificant increases in Bifidobacterium were observed after
>10 g/day of short-chain fructooligosaccharides.48 In our
pediatric population, we observed a significant bifidogenic
response in the prebiotic group with a lower 8 g/day dose
of OI.
The definition of prebiotic is currently a hotly debated
issue, largely because of advancements in high-throughput
sequencing showing changes beyond Bifidobacterium and
Lactobacillus and the requirement for selective utilization.7
In accordance with this debate, changes in several other
species and genera were observed with OI consumption,
although the number remained limited, supporting a selec-
tive utilization argument. In the present study, a significant
decrease in Bacteroides vulgatus (OTU_2492) was observed
with OI consumption. Importantly, this reduction in B vul-
gatus was correlated with a reduction in percent trunk fat
over the 16-week intervention. This positive correlation
between B vulgatus and adiposity was also observed in
women with obesity after prebiotic intervention.9 C clos-
tridioforme has been defined as a pathogenic bacteria
associated with serious and invasive human infection.49 In
reference to metabolic disease, 2 metagenome projects
observed C clostridioforme significantly enriched in patients
with T2D compared with healthy controls.50,51 In the pre-
sent
study,
Clostridium
clostridioforme
(OTU_2559)
decreased in prebiotic vs placebo, and it was significantly
positively correlated with changes in different biological and
compositional outcomes.
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a prominent butyrate-
producing bacterium that has been suggested to have an
anti-inflammatory role in inflammatory bowel disease and
has been negatively correlated with LPS in participants with
obesity.9,52 In the present study, however, F prausnitzii
(OTU_2516) significantly decreased with OI consumption.
This result is consistent with a cross-sectional study in India
showing increased F prausnitzii abundance in children with
obesity compared with non-obese children with qPCR,53 and
more recently with Illumina sequencing showing 20%
higher abundance of F prausnitzii in Italian children with
obesity compared with normal-weight,54 including a posi-
tive correlation of BMI z-score with Faecalibacterium.
Conversely, in adult populations, prebiotic significantly
increased F. prausnitzii abundance,9,55 and these differences
may be because of the cross-feeding interactions between
bifidobacteria and F prausnitzii.56 In vitro analysis revealed
that the relationship between bifidobacteria and F praus-
nitzii, in the presence of inulin-type fructans, could be
commensal or competitive, and this relationship was
dependent on the bifidobacterial strain and its capacity for
prebiotic degradation. Functional differences between ge-
netic phylotypes of F prausnitzii with different capacities for
butyrate production have also been observed with lean in-
dividuals having a genetic variant with a more moderate
capacity for butyrate production compared with individuals
with obesity and T2D.57 In accordance with this, children
with obesity had higher stool concentrations of butyrate
compared with normal-weight controls.58

CLINICAL AT
 There are some limitations to our study, including a
reduced generalizability of our findings because of the pri-
marily white and middle to high socioeconomic status of our
participants. Our participants were also otherwise healthy
overweight and obese children and, therefore, future studies
should also include a pediatric population with greater
metabolic dysfunction to more fully understand how geno-
type and environment affect the relationship between the
host and the gut microbiome.7 Lastly, many children in the
study did not have regular bowel movements; therefore, our
stool collection at baseline and final test days could not be
tightly controlled (eg, time of day, 24-hour collection),
which could affect the concentrations of some fecal metab-
olites such as FBAs.
In
conclusion,
supplementation
with
OI
improved
obesity outcomes in children with overweight/obesity.
Importantly, we have shown that OI induced specific gut
bacterial shifts compared with placebo. The metabolic and
microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for
a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. Prebiotics
are inexpensive and non-invasive and, therefore, a plausible
dietary intervention in the overweight and obese pediatric
population.
