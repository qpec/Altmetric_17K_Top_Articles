Abstract
IMPORTANCE—US hospitals receive financial penalties for excess risk–standardized 30-day 
readmissions and mortality in Medicare patients. Under current policy, readmission prevention is 
incentivized over 10-fold more than mortality reduction.
OBJECTIVE—To determine how penalties for US hospitals would change if policy equally 
weighted 30-day readmissions and mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Publicly available hospital-level data for fiscal 
year 2014 was obtained, including excess readmission ratio (ERR; risk-standardized predicted 
over expected 30-day readmissions) and 30-day mortality rates for heart failure, pneumonia, and 
acute myocardial infarction, as well as readmission penalties (as percent of Medicare Diagnosis 
Group payments). An excess mortality ratio (EMR) was calculated by dividing the risk-
standardized predicted mortality by the national average mortality. Case-weighted aggregate ERR 
(ERRAGG) and EMR (EMRAGG) were calculated, and an excess combined outcome ratio 
(ECORAGG) was created by averaging ERRAGG and EMRAGG. We examined associations 
between readmission penalties, ERRAGG, EMRAGG, and ECORAGG. Analysis of variance was 
used to compare readmission penalties in hospitals with concordant (both ratios >1 or <1) and 
discordant performance by ERRAGG and ECORAGG.

 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome investigated was the 
association between readmission penalties and the calculated excess combined outcome ratio 
(ECORAGG).
RESULTS—In 1963 US hospitals with complete data, readmission penalties closely tracked 
excess readmissions (r = 0.81; P < .001), but were minimally and inversely related with excess 
mortality (r = −0.12; P < .001) and only modestly correlated with excess combined readmission 
and mortality (r = 0.36; P < .001). Using hospitals with concordant ERRAGG and ECORAGG as the 
reference group, 17%of hospitals had an ECORAGG ratio less than 1 (ie, superior combined 
mortality/readmission outcome) with an ERRAGG ratio greater than 1, and received higher mean 
(SD) readmission penalties (0.41% [0.28%] vs 0.29% [0.37%]; P < .001); 16%of US hospitals had 
an ECORAGG ratio of greater than 1 (ie, inferior combined mortality/readmission outcome) with 
an ERRAGG ratio less than 1, and received minimal mean (SD) readmission penalties 
(0.08%[0.12%]; P < .001 for comparison with reference).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In fiscal year 2014, financial penalties for one-third of 
US hospitals would have been substantially altered if 30-day readmission and mortality were 
considered equally important. Under most circumstances, patients would rather avoid death than 
rehospitalization. Current Medicare financial penalties do not meet the goals of aligning incentives 
and fairly reimbursing hospitals for patient-centered outcomes.
In fiscal year (FY) 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began 
penalizing hospitals in the United States under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction 
Program for excess risk– standardized 30-day readmissions in Medicare patients with heart 
failure (HF), pneumonia (PNA), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In FY 2014, the 
Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program began penalizing hospitals with higher than 
expected risk– standardized 30-day mortality for these diagnoses. Readmission and death are 
competing but weakly correlated outcomes, leading to the belief that hospitals with low 
mortality are not more likely to receive readmission penalties.1
Currently, unbalanced incentives favor readmission prevention over mortality reduction. 
Patients who die within 30 days without rehospitalization are excluded from readmission 
metrics. Moreover, financial penalties are more than 10- fold greater for readmission than 
for mortality. We investigated how hospital penalties might change if 30-day readmission 
and mortality were weighted equally.
Methods
Hospital-level data for FY 2014 were obtained from Medicare.gov and Kaiser Health 
News.2,3 Data included excess readmission ratio (ERR; ratio of risk-standardized predicted 
to expected 30-day readmission) and 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for HF, PNA, 
and AMI (each calculated by CMS as a 3-year average), and FY 2014 readmission penalties 
(as % diagnosis related group [DRG] payments). Fiscal year 2014 was chosen for analysis 
because additional diagnoses were added to FY 2015 and FY 2016 readmission metrics 
without corresponding penalties for mortality.
An aggregate ERR for each hospital, weighted by the number of cases, was calculated:

 An excess mortality ratio (EMR) was calculated for each condition by dividing the risk-
standardized predicted mortality by the national average mortality, with a case-weighted 
hospital aggregate EMR (EMRAGG) derived analogously to ERRAGG:
We created an excess combined outcome ratio (ECORAGG) by averaging excess readmission 
and mortality:
We examined associations between readmission penalties, ERRAGG, EMRAGG, and 
ECORAGG. We used analysis of variance to compare readmission penalties in hospitals with 
concordant and discordant performance by ERRAGG and ECORAGG. Because the decision 
to equally weight mortality and readmission was arbitrary (and conservative), we performed 
sensitivity analyses with mortality weighted 2 and 5 times as much as readmission. Analyses 
were performed using Stata version 10.0 (StataCorp LP).
Results
In 1963 US hospitals with complete data for analysis, FY 2014 readmission penalties (0%–
2%ofDRGreimbursement) closely tracked excess readmissions (r = 0.81; P < .001), but were 
minimally and inversely associated with excess mortality (r = −0.12; P < .001) and only 
modestly correlated with excess combined readmission and mortality (r = 0.36; P < .001). 
The associations between condition-specific excess readmission and mortality were weak 
(HF: r = −0.21; P < .001) or absent (PNA: r < 0.001; P = .99 and AMI: r = 0.002; P = .94) 
and similar to those reported in previous Medicare cohorts for these diagnoses.1
As shown in both Figure 1 and Figure 2, 17% of hospitals had an ERRAGG ratio greater than 
1 and received readmission penalties, yet had an ECORAGG ratio of less than 1 (ie, superior 
combined outcomes if mortality and readmission were considered equally important). 
Conversely, 16%of hospitals had an ERRAGG ratio less than 1 and received little or no 
readmission penalty, yet had an ECORAGG ratio greater than 1 (ie, inferior combined 
outcomes).
With mortality weighted twice as much as readmission, 21% of hospitals had an ERRAGG 
ratio greater than 1 and an ECORAGG ratio less than 1, and 23% of hospitals had an 
ERRAGG ratio less than 1 and an ECORAGG ratio greater than 1. With mortality weighted 5 
times as much as readmission, 24% of hospitals had an ERRAGG ratio greater than 1 and an 
ECORAGG ratio less than 1, and 27% of hospitals had an ERRAGG ratio less than 1 and an 
ECORAGG ratio greater than 1. In other words, in FY 2014 more than half of US hospitals

 would have been misclassified for CMS penalties if death were considered 5 times more 
important than readmission.
Discussion
For FY 2014, CMS financial penalties for one-third of US hospitals would likely have been 
substantially different if the methodology equally weighted 30-day readmission and 
mortality. These discrepancies increased as mortality was weighted more heavily.
The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, implemented in 2012 as part of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, was designed to “improve quality of care… by 
incentivizing the reduction of hospital readmissions” and “reward hospitals for delivering 
services of higher value.”4 Mortality risk-standardization for HF, PNA, and MI is reasonably 
accurate,5 and publicly reported mortality for these conditions reflects hospital mortality 
rates for other diagnoses.6 By contrast, the discrimination of readmission risk models is 
low,5 and 30-day readmission rates reflect the sociodemographic composition of the 
population served more than the quality of care delivered or severity of illness.7
Financial penalties for excess 30-day readmissions, which cost some hospitals millions of 
dollars per year, clearly affect resource usage. Shortly after the advent of the Hospital 
Readmission Reduction Program, nearly 9 in 10 US hospitals reported creating quality 
improvement teams to reduce HF rehospitalizations,8 the primary driver of CMS 
readmission penalties.9 Some benefits have clearly accrued from this effort, as discharged 
patients now receive better coordination of care transitions, and 30-day readmissions have 
slightly decreased.10 Yet relatively few readmissions are truly preventable,11 and less 
attention has been paid the other side of the equation: What if so mere admissions are 
appropriate and necessary to prevent deaths?12 While the rates are not directly comparable, 
it is interesting to note that, after more than a decade of steady decline, age-adjusted 
mortality rates for US patients with HF have recently increased at the same time 30-day 
readmission rates decreased.10,13
Health care performance metrics are proliferating rapidly and are increasingly used to 
incentivize provider and system behavior. This is occurring without full consideration of 
misaligned incentives and the potential for unintended consequences. In FY 2016 the 
maximum penalty for high 30-day mortality rates is 0.2%ofDRGpayments, compared with 
3.0% maximum DRG penalty for excess 30-day readmissions. Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and stroke now also appear on the list of nonsurgical diagnoses penalized 
for excess 30-day readmissions. Similar concerns have been raised related to insufficient risk 
standardization and lack of evidence on how to prevent readmissions for these 
conditions,14,15 and there are no corresponding penalties for excess 30-day mortality.
Conclusions
The concept of quality-adjusted life years is a widely accepted method of assessing and 
improving health care decision making, and is based on patient-derived health utility of 
various states compared with death or perfect wellness. Again considering the case of 
hospitalized patients with HF, even surviving 3 or more cardiovascular rehospitalizations has

 relatively little negative effect on reported health utility.16 Put another way, under most 
circumstances, hospitalized patients would much rather avoid death than readmission. In the 
coming years, hospital financial penalties for readmissions will continue to over shadow 
those for mortality. If the goal of federal regulation is to align incentives and fairly reimburse 
hospitals for patient-centered outcomes, current CMS policy does not reflect these aims.
