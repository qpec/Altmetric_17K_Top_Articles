Background-—Bilirubin may protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) by reducing oxidative stress. Whether elevated bilirubin
reduces the risk of CVD events among HIV+ individuals and if this differs from uninfected individuals remain unclear. We assessed
whether bilirubin independently predicted the risk of CVD events among HIV+ and uninfected participants in VACS (Veterans Aging
Cohort Study).
Methods and Results-—We conducted a prospective cohort study using VACS participants free of baseline CVD. Total bilirubin was
categorized by quartiles. CVD as well as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke events were assessed. Cox
regression was used to evaluate hazard ratios of outcomes associated with quartiles of total bilirubin in HIV+ and uninfected people
after adjusting for multiple risk factors. There were 96 381 participants (30 427 HIV+); mean age was 48 years, 48% were black,
and 97% were men. There were 6603 total incident CVD events over a mean of 5.7 years. In adjusted models, increasing quartiles
of baseline total bilirubin were associated with decreased hazards of all outcomes (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval,
0.80–0.91). Among HIV+ participants, results persisted for heart failure, ischemic stroke, and total CVD, but nonsignificant
associations were observed for acute myocardial infarction.
Conclusions-—VACS participants (regardless of HIV status) with elevated bilirubin levels had a lower risk of incident total
CVD, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke events after adjusting for known risk factors. Future
studies should investigate how this apparently protective effect of elevated bilirubin could be harnessed to reduce CVD risk
or improve risk estimation among HIV+ individuals.

A
fter achieving HIV virologic suppression, cardiovascular
disease (CVD) emerges as one of the principal causes of
morbidity and mortality for individuals living with HIV.1 HIV
infection has been shown to increase the risk of CVD,
independent of established risk factors, by 50% to 100%.2–4
The mechanisms underlying this increased risk may be mediated
by inflammation, immune activation, and oxidative stress.5 Thus,
the search for better methods of identifying those PLWH at
highest risk and discovering novel ways to address the cause of
CVD has been of crucial importance for the past several years.6

 Bilirubin is known to have antiatherogenic properties,
mediated in part by reducing oxidative stress.7–10 Individuals
with Gilbert syndrome have elevated levels of unconjugated
bilirubin because of a defect in uridine diphosphate glu-
curonosyltransferase 1A1 enzyme.11 Longitudinal studies of
this syndrome have demonstrated reductions in coronary
artery
disease,12
stroke,13
and
other
inflammatory
conditions.14
Certain medications can also increase bilirubin levels. For
example, the antiretroviral drug atazanavir can competitively
inhibit
uridine
diphosphate
glucuronosyltransferase
1A1,
leading to an increase in unconjugated bilirubinemia.15
Several studies have shown atazanavir use can improve
endothelial function and reduce lipid levels and blood
pressure in HIV-uninfected diabetic patients.16,17 Among
HIV-positive individuals, atazanavir decreased markers of
inflammation and slowed progression of carotid intimal-medial
thickness when compared with other antiretroviral treatment
(ART), an effect that appears to be partially mediated by
bilirubin.18,19
We sought to determine whether increased total bilirubin
levels were associated with reduced CVD events in VACS
(Veterans Aging Cohort Study) and to determine if those
associations differed by HIV status, atazanavir use, and liver
disease.
Methods
Study Design and Data Source
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will be made
available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the
results or replicating the procedures.20,21 VACS is a prospec-
tive longitudinal cohort of HIV-positive veterans matched 1:2
with uninfected veterans on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
clinical site; they were enrolled in the same calendar year.20,21
We included all VACS participants enrolled on or after April 1,
2003, in whom the baseline was the first clinic visit on or after
this date. Participants were followed from baseline until
development of CVD, date of death, or December 31, 2011.
Participants with known CVD (myocardial infarction, coronary
heart disease, stroke, heart failure [HF], or cardiomyopathy)
before the baseline visit were excluded. Prevalent CVD was
determined using International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes from Medicaid, Medicare, and
Veterans Affairs (VA) data. In addition, veterans who sero-
converted to HIV-positive status during follow-up were
excluded. The institutional review boards at Vanderbilt
University, Yale University, and West Haven VA Medical
Center approved this study. VACS has a waiver of informed
consent.
Exposure, Outcome, and Covariates
The primary outcome of interest was total incident CVD,
defined as the composite of the following incident events:
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke (IS), and
HF.
ICD-9
codes
for
AMI
included
1
inpatient
or
2
outpatient 410.xx codes; for HF, 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient
402.xx, 404.xx, and 428.xx codes; and for IS, 1 inpatient
433.x1, 434.x1 (excluding 434.x0), or 436 code or 2
outpatient 438.x codes. Secondary outcomes were the
individual incident events that made up the composite CVD
outcome.
The primary exposure was total bilirubin level closest to
baseline (up to 180 days after baseline), which was pulled
from laboratory data for each participant. All measurements
of bilirubin were performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improve-
ment Amendments–certified and compliant clinical laboratory.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study demonstrated, for the first time, that levels of
bilirubin can predict cardiovascular disease for individuals
with HIV, even after adjusting for known risk factors in this
population, and did not appear to be mediated by atazanavir
use.
• These findings were also confirmed among age-, sex-, and
ethnicity-matched HIV negative controls from the same
healthcare system using a total population size of 96 381
patients.
• This inverse relationship between increasing bilirubin levels
and cardiovascular disease occurred within the normal
physiologic range.
• Even after excluding individuals with liver disease, these
findings persisted.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Mounting evidence has demonstrated that HIV-positive
individuals have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease
than HIV-negative individuals, even after adjusting for
known risk factors.
• Inflammation appears to be a mediator of this increased
risk.
• Additional studies would be necessary to explore the use of
bilirubin as a biomarker for other inflammation-mediated
conditions and all-cause mortality among individuals with
HIV.
• Total bilirubin could also provide additional prognostic
information on morbidity and mortality risk calculators.
• This work provides epidemiologic rationale for future studies
to investigate how the antioxidant effect of bilirubin could
be harnessed to reduce chronic disease morbidity risk.

 Various clinical laboratories across the VA Healthcare System
may differ in testing platforms over time, but this would serve
to increase standard error and likely bias results toward the
null. The variation in total bilirubin results between testing
platforms from laboratories that have received Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments approval would be
within 20%. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were gathered from
VA administrative data, whereas systolic blood pressure,
diabetes mellitus status, and lipid levels were collected from
clinical outpatient and laboratory data closest to the baseline
date. Body mass index was taken from VA vital sign data. ART
receipt was based on pharmacy data, and smoking status was
ascertained from the health factors data that are collected on
a standard VA form. Systolic blood pressure was the mean of
3 routine outpatient measurements closest to baseline.
Diabetes mellitus status was determined on the basis of at
least 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient codes for this diagnosis and a
validated algorithm that incorporates glucose levels and use
of antidiabetic agents. Body mass index was dichotomized
using a cut point of at least 30 kg/m2. Smoking status was
categorized as current, former, or never. Alcohol and cocaine
abuse or dependence was determined using ICD-9 codes.
ICD-9 codes or the presence of a positive hepatitis C virus
antibody test result was used to determine hepatitis C virus
status. As a measure of liver fibrosis, we used FIB-4, which is
calculated from age, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, and platelet count.22 ART was categorized
by regimen within a window of 180 days before baseline
through 7 days after baseline, including a nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) plus a protease inhibitor, an
NRTI plus a non-NRTI, other (ie, use of protease inhibitor,
NRTI, or non-NRTI medications but not in combination, as
described in the other 2 categories), and no ART (reference
group). HIV-specific biomarkers CD4 and viral load were
collected at baseline and throughout follow-up until the end of
2011.
Statistical Analysis
We performed descriptive analyses stratified by bilirubin
quartile. We used survival analyses to construct cumulative
incidence plots stratified by total bilirubin quartile for each
outcome. Log-rank tests were performed to determine
whether time to event differed by total bilirubin quartile. To
further explore this relationship between baseline bilirubin
and risk of CVD, restricted cubic splines were developed to
allow a nonlinear association between the log-hazards of CVD
outcomes and bilirubin. We then performed multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression to examine the association
between baseline quartiles of total bilirubin and risk of total
CVD and its components in the full cohort and for HIV+
participants only. In the full cohort, models were adjusted for
HIV status, demographic characteristics, and traditional CVD
risk factors, as well as liver fibrosis and substance depen-
dence or abuse. Models limited to HIV-positive veterans were
additionally adjusted for HIV-1 RNA, CD4 cell count, and ART
regimen. Next, we incorporated all recorded values of total
bilirubin on those in our full sample during the follow-up
period using total bilirubin as a time-varying covariate and the
same adjustment variables previously mentioned, and we
again assessed the association between total bilirubin and
incident CVD.
Sensitivity analyses were performed on participants with-
out liver disease (defined as FIB-4 ≥1.45, hepatitis C virus
infection, alcohol abuse, or ICD-9 codes indicative of hepatic
decompensation23) using quartiles of baseline total bilirubin
and time-updated total bilirubin as our exposure of interest.
Because atazanavir has been shown to increase total bilirubin
levels, supplemental analyses assessed whether rates and
risk of CVD differed among those HIV-positive individuals
receiving atazanavir compared with those receiving other ART
regimens.
Missing data were accounted for by creating 5 complete
data sets through the use of multiple imputation. Continuous
variables were imputed through the use of predictive mean
matching to produce biologically plausible imputed values,
whereas multinomial logistic regression was used to impute
categorical variables. All analyses were performed in Stata
13.1 (Stata Corp), and a 2-sided P<0.05 was used to
determine statistical significance.
Results
Participant Characteristics
In total, there were 96 381 participants (30 427 HIV+ and
65 954 HIV�) who were followed up for a mean of 5.7 years
after enrollment. The mean age was 48 years, with 97% of the
cohort being men and 48% being black. During the follow-up
period, we observed 6603 total CVD events, 3843 HF events,
1931 AMI events, and 2112 IS events. All participant
characteristics (Table 1) were statistically different across
quartiles of total bilirubin (P<0.05).
Cumulative Incidence and Cox Proportional
Hazards Regression Models
The thresholds for bilirubin quartiles in this cohort were ≤0.4,
0.5 to 0.6, 0.7 to 0.8, and ≥0.9 mg/dL. Cumulative incidence
of CVD, HF, AMI, and IS events differed across quartiles of
total bilirubin (all log-rank P<0.05), with the highest incidence
occurring in lowest quartile and lowest incidence in the
highest quartile (Figure 1). Using splines to allow for nonlinear
relationships, we found that CVD risk exponentially decreased

Bilirubin Is Associated With CVD for HIV+ and HIV�

 with increasing bilirubin (Figure 2A). The same association
was seen with HF, AMI, and IS. In all cases, the risk decreased
until �0.9 mg/dL and subsequently increased as total
bilirubin levels increased to values indicative of liver failure.
When individuals with known liver disease were excluded
(Figure 2B), the risk continued to decrease throughout the
range of increasing bilirubin levels.
In adjusted regression models, CVD risk differed by
bilirubin quartile (P<0.001), and higher bilirubin quartiles
were associated with lower CVD risk compared with the
lowest bilirubin quartile (Table 2). A test for trend across
quartiles was also statistically significant (P<0.001), with risk
of CVD decreasing by 8% for each increase in total bilirubin
quartile. In separate adjusted models for HF, AMI, and IS, this
same inverse relationship was observed (Table 2), although
the trend was not as consistent for AMI or IS.
Among HIV-positive participants, regression models were
further adjusted for baseline HIV�1 RNA, CD4 count, and ART
regimen (Table 3). The relative risk of CVD events by bilirubin
quartiles was similar, although incidence rates were higher
among HIV-positive participants compared with the full
cohort. Trends and statistical significance for HF, AMI, and
IS were similar between the full cohort and the HIV-positive
participants, except for the lack of association between total
bilirubin quartiles and AMI risk among HIV-positive partici-
pants.
In the full cohort, when time-updating total bilirubin
throughout the follow-up period, we observed the following
CVD risk compared with the referent group composed of
those with a total bilirubin ≤0.4 mg/dL: total bilirubin 0.5 to
0.6 mg/dL, hazard ratio [HR]=0.82 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.76–0.88); total bilirubin 0.7 to 0.8 mg/dL, HR=0.79
(95% CI, 0.73–0.86); and total bilirubin ≥0.9 mg/dL, HR=0.81
(95% CI, 0.75–0.87).
Sensitivity and Supplemental Analyses
To determine whether liver disease could have affected the
relationship between bilirubin and CVD, a subgroup analysis
was performed on the entire cohort, excluding individuals with
hepatitis C virus, an FIB-4 ≥1.45, alcohol abuse at baseline, or
ICD-9 codes indicative of hepatic decompensation (Table 4).
Rates of CVD were lower for each quartile, but the trend in
relative risk reduction with increasing bilirubin quartile was
maintained (P<0.001). On time-updating total bilirubin in the
subset of individuals without liver disease,22 we observed the
following CVD risk compared with the referent group
composed of those with a total bilirubin ≤0.4 mg/dL: total
bilirubin 0.5 to 0.6 mg/dL, HR=0.77 (95% CI, 0.68–0.87);
total bilirubin 0.7 to 0.8 mg/dL, HR=0.76 (95% CI, 0.67–
0.87); and total bilirubin ≥0.9 mg/dL, HR=0.70 (95% CI, 0.62–
0.80).
Last, the incidence of CVD events was assessed among
HIV-positive participants by atazanavir use to explore whether
the observed inverse association between bilirubin levels and
CVD could be explained by an atazanavir-mediated increase in
bilirubinemia and an atazanavir-mediated reduction in CVD
risk or whether atazanavir had an additive effect to reduce the

 incidence of CVD (Table 5). There were 425 HIV-positive
participants receiving atazanavir at baseline (1.4%), whereas
12 853 (42.2%) were receiving an ART regimen excluding
atazanavir. CVD incidence rates were slightly higher among
those receiving atazanavir (16.5 [95% CI, 11.07–24.64] versus
14.6 [95% CI, 13.86–15.47] events per 1000 person-years),
but this difference did not reach statistical significance.
Discussion
In this study of bilirubin and CVD risk, we found that VACS
participants with mildly elevated bilirubin levels had a lower
risk of incident CVD, HF, AMI, and IS events, even after
adjusting for known risk factors. Among HIV-positive partic-
ipants, this inverse association persisted for HF and IS but
was not significant for AMI. The association remained even for
individuals without liver disease.
To date, this is the first report of the relationship between
bilirubin levels and incident CVD events for individuals living
with HIV. In clinical studies of HIV-positive individuals, mildly
elevated levels of bilirubin have been beneficial for multiple
conditions. Individuals with Gilbert syndrome have a lower risk
of ischemic heart disease (2%) compared with the general
population (12.1%).24 In particular, those homozygous for the
UGT1A1*28 allele had one third of the risk of coronary heart
disease than those who were not homozygotes in the
Framingham Heart Study.25 Although the (TA)-repeat variation
in the UGT1A1 gene is the main genetic factor for determining
bilirubin concentrations, the penetrance ranges from 1% to
67%,26 further confounding the genetic association, protein
expression, and CVD outcomes. Genetic association studies
have not conclusively found an association between the (TA)-
repeat variation or a causal relationship between bilirubin and
CVD outcomes; however, a causal relationship cannot be
excluded on the basis of these studies.
In the general population, multiple studies have confirmed
the strong negative association of bilirubin levels with
atherosclerosis,27 even among those with familial coronary

also found an inverse relationship with stroke, in which a
0.1-mg/dL increase resulted a 9% reduction in the odds of an
event in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey.8 This reduction is similar to the changes seen in this
study at the lower quartiles. The decreasing trend observed
with increasing quartiles suggests that the nonlinear trend
observed in the time-updated analysis in the full cohort may
have been driven by individuals with abnormally high bilirubin
levels, which are indicative of liver failure, or the effect is
maximal or saturated at lower bilirubin levels. An earlier study
showed a similar U-shaped relationship in a cohort of British
men.32 On the other hand, the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal
and Vascular End-Stage Disease) study demonstrated a log-
linear relationship for both CVD and stroke that persisted
through the entire range of bilirubin levels.33 Although it was
unclear whether participants with liver disease were excluded
from the main study, in the meta-analysis from this article,
there appeared to be a narrower variance of the CVD risk
reduction for studies that adjusted for other liver markers.
There are several mechanisms whereby bilirubin levels may
directly affect CVD outcomes. As an end product of heme
metabolism, bilirubin is toxic and insoluble. As such, it must
be glucuronidated before being excreted in the bile. Alterna-
tively, bilirubin can serve as a potent antioxidant by reducing
reactive oxygen species and is subsequently oxidized back to
biliverdin.34,35 This pathway appears to affect oxidative
stress–induced membrane lipid degradation more than its
effect on water-soluble proteins (in contrast to glutathione).
Although concentrations of bilirubin are relatively lower than
glutathione, the continuous recycling of biliverdin to bilirubin
amplifies its effect by ≥10 000 times. Therefore, even minor
increases in bilirubin levels could account for a significant
increase in antioxidant potency and, therefore, affect CVD
outcomes. In mouse models, depletion of bilirubin levels has
resulted in intracerebral hemorrhage,36 neuronal apoptosis,37
traumatic brain injury,38 and cerebral ischemia.39 Increased
levels of bilirubin also appear to establish a lean hypolipidemic
state by decreasing circulating cholesterol and triacylglycerol
concentrations9 and have been found to inhibit platelet
hyperreactivity and thrombosis formation via interaction with
collagen and ADP receptors.10 There is even evidence that
bilirubin can inhibit neointima formation after arterial injury,
block proliferation and migration of human arterial smooth
muscle cells,40 and promote angiogenesis.41
Although, in this analysis, there did not appear to be an
independent effect of atazanavir with CVD18 risk, 2 studies
(ACTG 5257 and 5260) have shown a reduction in cardio-
vascular biomarkers and slower progression of carotid
intimal-medial thickness19 with atazanavir compared with
raltegravir and boosted darunavir, which was partially medi-
ated by bilirubin. A study from Spain showed similar
findings.42 Three cross-sectional studies,43 2 that compared
those with normal levels to levels >2.5 mg/dL, did not find
any benefit.44,45 Atazanavir has even been tested in HIV-
negative diabetic patients to determine its effect on carotid
intimal thickness. In one of these trials, endothelial function
improved,16 whereas the second study showed only a
reduction
in
low-density
lipoprotein
levels
and
blood
pressure.17 To potentially explain these mixed findings,
atazanavir and other protease inhibitors have been shown
to actually increase endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress,
and von Willebrand factor, thereby counteracting some of the
benefits of the elevated bilirubin levels.46–48 Because CVD
rates did not differ by atazanavir status in the VACS analysis,
it is unlikely that the bilirubin effect is merely a surrogate for
a protective effect afforded by atazanavir use.

Bilirubin Is Associated With CVD for HIV+ and HIV�

 If replicated successfully, these results have potential
clinical implications not only for CVD risk assessment and
reduction but also in other chronic conditions, including
cancers,
demyelinating
neuropathies,
seasonal
affective
disorder,14 and rheumatoid arthritis.49 This work provides
epidemiologic rationale for future studies to investigate how
the antioxidant effect of bilirubin could be harnessed to
reduce chronic disease morbidity risk. Future studies should
explore the use of bilirubin as a biomarker for other
inflammation-mediated conditions and all-cause mortality.
Total bilirubin could also provide additional prognostic
information in morbidity and mortality risk estimators, like
the VACS index.50 Interestingly, large increases in bilirubin
were not required to see an effect on CVD risk reduction,
and most of the change happened well within the normal
physiologic range and specifically from the first to the
second quartile.
Limitations
This study had a few limitations. Because VACS is an
observational study, causality cannot be determined nor can
all confounders be identified and completely controlled.51
Because the vast majority of participants were men, we

 cannot generalize these findings to a population of women.
Direct versus indirect bilirubin was not examined. CVD events
were not further categorized into type-specific disease codes.
Conclusions
Recent HIV guidelines have emphasized the need to enhance
the detection and management of those individuals at risk of
CVD through behavioral modification and preventive therapy,
such as aspirin and lipid-lowering agents. It is important to
determine whether incorporating bilirubin levels into current
risk stratification models could improve prognostication of
inflammatory
diseases.
In
addition,
further
exploration
into the mechanisms related to the antioxidant properties
of bilirubin could provide new insights into therapeutic
strategies.
