Summary
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of regional
diets on the health of the poor in mid-Victorian Britain.
Contemporary surveys of regional diets and living condi-
tion were reviewed. This information was compared with
mortality data from Britain over the same period. Although
there was an overall improvement in life expectancy during
the latter part of the 19th century, there were large regio-
nal differences in lifestyle, diet and mortality rates. Dietary
surveys showed that the poor labouring population in iso-
lated rural areas of England, in the mainland and islands of
Scotland and in the west of Ireland enjoyed the most nutri-
tious diets. These regions also showed the lowest mortality
rates in Britain. This was not simply the result of better
sanitation and less mortality from food and waterborne
infections but also fewer deaths from pulmonary tubercu-
losis, which is typically associated with better nutrition.
These more isolated regions where a peasant-style culture
provided abundant locally produced cheap foodstuffs such
as potatoes, vegetables, whole grains, and milk and fish,
were in the process of disappearing in the face of increasing
urbanisation. This was to the detriment of many rural poor
during the latter half of the century. Conversely, increasing
urbanisation, with its improved transport links, brought
greater availability and diversity of foods to many others.
It was this that that led to an improved nutrition and life
expectancy for the majority in urbanising Britain, despite
the detrimental effects of increasing food refinement.

Introduction
It has been argued in this journal that the mid-
Victorian urban diet provided the basis for a significant
protection against major degenerative diseases and a
life expectancy not dramatically different from today.1
It was suggested that many of the benefits of this diet
were lost as a result of its deterioration during the latter
part of the century because of the increasing use of first
generation, mass produced refined foods. Nevertheless,
life expectancy continued to improve during the latter
half of the 19th century. McKeown and Record2
argued that improved nutrition in England and Wales
was the most important factor in the reduction of the
death rate during this period. Although better sanita-
tion led to a reduction in deaths from gastrointestinal
infections, it was maintained that improved nutrition
had a major impact by lowering the death rate from
tuberculosis. Both these arguments are complicated by
the huge regional differences in lifestyle, living condi-
tions, diet and mortality in Britain in the mid-Victorian
period. This study reviews the diverse dietary differ-
ences and living conditions across Britain. It attempts
to
understand
how
these
differences
may
have
influenced patterns of disease and life expectancy
during the mid-Victorian period.
Methods
Contemporary Victorian surveys of diet and living
condition, notably those of Smith,3 as well as more
recent studies, were reviewed. The information was
compared with mortality data from mid-Victorian
Britain. The mortality data were taken from the
decennial summaries in the 25th and 45th Reports
of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and
Marriages in England, the 17th Report of the
Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages
in Ireland and the 10th Detailed Annual Report of
the Registrar General of Births Deaths and Marriages
in Scotland.4–7 Death rates were adjusted using the
mean population in England and Wales between
1851 and 1860 as reference.
Regional characteristics
Mid-19th century Britain was the major manufactur-
ing powerhouse of the world, but it was still
predominately a rural society with less than half of
the 18 or 19 million people in England and Wales
living in large urban centres.8 Among the population
of about three million in Scotland, only just over one
million resided in town districts. The census of 1871
in Ireland showed that of the population of around

 5.5 million less than 30% was urban, mainly in
the eastern provinces around Belfast and Dublin,
with the western provinces of Ireland being almost
entirely rural.
One of the important characteristics of British
society both in the growing urban centres and rural
areas was that the vast majority of the population
were by today’s standards poor. In urban areas,
there were vast armies of labouring people in indus-
try, construction and in mining as well as over a mil-
lion domestic servants.8 Large urban or industrial
regions of dense population were found in parts
of London such as Whitechapel, around the coalfields
of
east
Lancashire,
West
Yorkshire,
parts
of
Birmingham, the Black Country, the Potteries and
Tyneside.9 The spectacular expansion of Liverpool
was a result of a large proportion of the world’s com-
modities passing through its port on the river Mersey.
More than half of the population in these areas had
migrated from rural districts. Glasgow and west cen-
tral Scotland was also one of the most industrialised
regions in the British Isles. The most industrialised
areas in Ireland centred on Belfast.
The largest category among the poor labouring
people
still
worked
in
the
agricultural
sector.
By mid-century, most common fields had been
enclosed and farming was predominantly capitalist
in type in England, Wales and the Lowlands of
Scotland. Whilst this had increased the efficiency of
agriculture, it had resulted in agricultural workers
being made into paid labourers, often in a seasonal
or intermittent manner reliant on a cash economy for
housing, food and clothing. The poverty of many in
this situation increased the migration to urban areas
where jobs were more plentiful and often better paid.
Agricultural regions were diverse, each possessing
their own distinctive cultural, economic structures
and living conditions. In the southern and southeast
parts of England, there was a greater density of
farm workers and nucleated villages were the norm.
The isolation of farms in regions distant from urban
centres required a system based on individual farms
or hamlets.10 This isolation often dictated payment in
kind, in grain, potatoes and coal or land where workers
were encouraged to produce their own food and keep
their own livestock.10 In the Lowlands of Scotland, the
agricultural revolution was well advanced, but the pea-
sant-style farming culture remained vibrant because of
the relative immaturity of capitalist farm production.11
In contrast to England, Wales and the Lowlands of
Scotland, the Highlands and islands of Scotland, like
much of Ireland, remained very poor and traditional.
During the 100 years between 1750 and 1850, the
rural community in the western Highlands had
moved from a feudal clan relationship into an
impoverished and overcrowded peasantry so with
much migration to the enlarging industrial towns
and abroad.12
Whilst appalling sanitary conditions were well
documented in the large urban centres, living condi-
tions were not idyllic in many rural communities.13
Housing was often poor, crowded, squalid or other-
wise insalubrious. Well water could be limited and
other water supplies often contaminated by refuse.13
Polluted water was prevalent in low-lying country,
marshlands or along the Thames estuary.14
Dietary patterns in Britain
Although a number of dietary surveys were con-
ducted in Victorian Britain, the largest and most
informative were those performed by Dr Edward
Smith in mid-century.3,15 He studied representative
families involved in specific, poorly paid urban occu-
pations such as weaving and shoemaking in the north
of England, the Midlands and London and poorly
paid agricultural labourers who represented the dif-
ferent rural regions of the United Kingdom. Whilst he
acknowledged it was selective, he argued that it did
provide a broad understanding of the typical diets of
the working poor across urban and rural districts in
Britain.
Although the overall caloric intake among the
poor has been disputed, it was not high by the stand-
ards today, particularly at a time when significant
physical activity was usual.16 Throughout Britain,
with the exception of some areas of the north of
England, the uplands of Scotland, and in Ireland,
white bread made from bolted wheat flour was the
staple component of the diet.15 This basic diet was
typically supplemented, when affordable, by vege-
tables, fruit and animal-derived foods such as meat,
fish, milk, cheese and eggs, in many ways similar to a
Mediterranean-style diet.1 Although the price of
bread had fallen following the repeal of the Corn
Laws in 1846, the poorest urban families still had
limited resources to purchase an adequate caloric
intake as well as more expensive meat, fish, milk
products, vegetables and fruit compared with better
off families.16 Smith and others documented many
poorer urban families eating bread and potatoes
with little or no meat or milk. In some poor families,
the main beverage was tea with sugar without milk,
even for children.13,17
This pattern also existed in many rural areas of
England among poor agricultural workers who were
largely dependent on a cash economy for the pur-
chase of food. Many rural families existed largely
on bread with little milk or meat. Fish was not gen-
erally consumed in rural areas unless close to the sea.

 It was notable that milk was not easily obtainable by
many of the rural poor as recorded by Smith and
other observers.18
However, the rural diet was often better for the
poor in more isolated areas of England because of
payment made in kind, notably in fuel, grain, pota-
toes, meat, milk or small patches of land to grow
potatoes and vegetables or keep an animal or two.
Similarly, in the Lowlands of Scotland elements of
peasant culture persisted where workers were also
commonly paid in kind and able to retain their own
plots of land and grow food and keep animals. Smith
concluded that the farm labourers in Scotland were
well fed by English standards because of the large
quantity of milk and oatmeal obtained.3 That the
rural labouring population in Scotland was generally
well fed compared with those in England was a
consistent observation even later in the century.19
Although the people of the uplands and islands
of Scotland were extremely poor and had experienced
the pressure of increasing population and changes to
the system of land tenure, the economy remained
essentially peasant in type with each family farming
a plot of land. The diet was based on oats and
increasingly the potato along with abundant milk
and some meat from household livestock as well as
fish, notably herring in the western Highlands. Thus,
milk or whey was the normal accompaniment to oats
and potatoes with meat or fish when available.20 The
diet of island communities was also based on oats and
vegetables, less milk but large quantities of fish and
shellfish, a situation that was retained into the 1930s
in isolated communities with little access to processed
foods.21
In Ireland, the rural population, especially in the
western provinces such as Connaught, was mostly
exceptionally poor. Here, food was unvaried, consist-
ing largely of milk with potatoes when in season and
increasingly maize or oats mixed with milk, a meal
termed ‘stirabout’. Meat was very limited, and tea
or beer was hardly drunk at all by the poor in the
country areas. Despite the monotony of this diet,
Smith, through the eyes of a physician, described a
particularly robust and healthy-looking population
compared with their English counterparts, indicating
that this diet was particularly nutritious.
Whilst Clayton and Rowbotham suggested that
the urban working class in mid-Victorian Britain ate
a superior version of the Mediterranean diet which
protected against degenerative diseases, there was
clearly much regional variability in quality across
the United Kingdom. Many of the poor working
population in urban areas as well as in some rural
areas in England and Wales had difficulty in obtain-
ing a high-quality diet with additional animal-derived
foods to supplement a diet of bread, tea and sugar,
whereas this was far less of a problem in isolated rural
areas in England and in parts of Scotland. Even
among the poorest peasant population of Ireland,
the monotonous diet of potatoes, grain and milk
was more nutritious than among many poor in
England. Following the publication of the study by
Smith, The Times noted that England seemed to be
the worst-fed region of the United Kingdom with
Scotland and Ireland being the best fed.22
Height and nutrition
Studies of the heights of military recruits during the
Victorian era support the conclusions of the dietary
surveys that suggest the rural Scots and Irish were
generally better nourished than their English counter-
parts. A considerable number of longitudinal analyses
of the heights of young male military recruits from
poor backgrounds,
adjusted for
minimal
height
requirements, have been conducted as a measure of
a ‘biological standard of living’. Whilst recruits to
Sandhurst from better off families were taller than
their poorer counterparts, these studies have consist-
ently shown that over first half of the 19th century,
the heights of male recruits from areas distant from
London, notably the northern parts of England and
rural Scotland and Ireland, were taller than their
southern counterparts, suggesting better nutrition
during the growth period of life.23
Patterns of disease
Whilst causes of death were not as clearly defined
during the Victorian era as in modern times, and a
significant number were unknown, reported causes of
death were similar across the entire Kingdom. Most
deaths were related to infectious disease. Infant and
childhood mortality were high as a result of common
childhood infections. About 10% of deaths under
the age of 5 were a result of diarrhoeal diseases.
Diarrhoea, dysentery and typhoid also caused signifi-
cant deaths among adults, indicating that poor sani-
tary conditions were prevalent in many parts of
Britain. Deaths from typhus also occurred in small
numbers, although it was not widely distinguished
from typhoid fever till after mid-century. However,
tuberculosis caused a relatively high death rate par-
ticularly among young adults. Most cardiac disease
was mainly a consequence of infectious diseases such
as rheumatic fever. Although ischaemic heart disease
was well recognised, it was uncommon, seen as a dis-
ease of wealthier, stout men who did little exercise.24
Although this pattern of causes of death was
common to all parts of the United Kingdom, major

 regional differences existed. Some typical differences
are illustrated in Table 1, where death rates have been
standardised to the age of the population in England
and Wales given in the 1851–1860 decennial report.
The first Irish decennial report was for the years
1871–1880 so that comparable figures for England
and Wales for 1871–1880 are also provided for
comparison.

 As noted by contemporaries, urban areas such as
Liverpool showed the highest death rates, not surpris-
ingly as a result of high infant mortality and gastro-
intestinal
infections
but
also
tuberculosis.
Poor
suburbs of London, such as Whitechapel, also
showed similar high rates.
Regions with much lower death rates were scattered
across rural areas in the extreme south, southwest and
north of England. This is exemplified in England in the
rural county of Herefordshire. Here, infant and child-
hood mortality and deaths from gastrointestinal dis-
eases and pulmonary tuberculosis were all significantly
lower than in urban areas. Surprisingly, the wealthy
agricultural county of Cambridgeshire showed death
rates only comparable to those of England as a whole.
It is notable that although the Welsh island of
Anglesey had a low death rate from gastrointestinal
disease, it had a very high death rate from tuberculosis.
In Scotland, the first decennial period with complete
returns (1855–1865), although less detailed, showed
that the death rate was generally lower than in
England and Wales although there was a similar differ-
ence between urban and rural areas.6 Whilst rural and
island regions of Scotland showed low death rates from
gastrointestinal infectious, death rates from tubercu-
losis were also lower in these regions than comparable
regions in England during the period 1851–1860.
The first decennial review (1871–1880) in Ireland
also showed generally lower mortality rates than com-
parable years in England and Wales (Table 1).
However,
urbanised regions
in the
east
around
Dublin had higher mortality than the more rural west-
ern provinces. The regions around Belfast also had
similar high death rates. It is striking, however, that
the western rural area exemplified by the poor province
of Connaught showed the very lowest childhood and
infant mortality, as well as low death rates from both
gastrointestinal infections and tuberculosis.7
Discussion
Although the reliability of Victorian surveys may be
questioned, the regional differences in dietary quality
reported by Smith are reflected by the data on the
heights of young military recruits, where taller
young men were found in the better fed regions.
Moreover, these better fed regions of Britain also
showed lower mortality rates. This is entirely consist-
ent with recent studies that have shown a decreased
risk of death following improvement towards a higher
Mediterranean dietary standard.25
However, most of the best fed regions were rural
and distant from urban centres. It is therefore not sur-
prising that these less crowded regions generally
showed fewer deaths from food and waterborne
gastrointestinal
infections
than
urban
centres.
Nevertheless, the fact that water- and food-borne dis-
eases were also prevalent in rural communities implies
that sanitary conditions were far from ideal. It has been
postulated that much poor health in low-lying regions
within Cambridgeshire, the Fens and along the Thames
Estuary were the result of a polluted water supply.14
This was undoubtedly partly responsible for the high
infant and childhood mortality in these areas.
Nevertheless, the best fed regions identified by
Smith also showed significantly lower death rates
from pulmonary tuberculosis. This was one of the
most important infectious diseases that caused high
mortality, notably among young adults. Although
the
accuracy
of
death
certification
in
Victorian
Britain was imperfect, the clinical features of pulmon-
ary tuberculosis (phthisis) were well recognised, even if
tuberculosis undoubtedly accounted for more deaths
from less well-defined respiratory disease. It was ende-
mic throughout the United Kingdom. Whilst transmis-
sion rates from infected sputum were probably higher
in crowded urban areas, this does not provide an
explanation for the low death rates in some regions.
Autopsy records show that most people had been
infected, although most did not develop active disease
and die from it.26,27 A study by Grimshaw in Ireland
showed that although rural areas had lower mortality
rates from tuberculosis than urban regions, the actual
prevalence of the disease was similar in both areas.28
Moreover, some more sparsely populated rural areas
such as the island of Anglesey in Wales, whilst having
a low death rate from water and foodborne infections,
had particularly high death rates from tuberculosis
indicating that a rural environment alone was not
protective.
It has long been recognised that a high death rate
from tuberculosis is typically associated with poor
and inadequate nourishment. Dietary deficiency has
a profound effect on cellular immune function and a
wide range of human and experimental studies have
confirmed that multifaceted malnutrition, protein
deficiency and deficiencies of vitamin A and C
increase susceptibility to tuberculosis.29 Following
the logic of McKeown and Record, it can be clearly
argued that the lower death rates from tuberculosis in
these rural regions were the result of a more nutri-
tious diet.
It can be concluded that poor rural societies enjoy-
ing the best diet and health in mid-century were those
retaining a more traditional lifestyle where high-qual-
ity foods were obtained locally. Unfortunately, these
societies were in the process of disappearing under the
pressure of urbanisation, commercial farming and
migration. Such changes in Victorian society were
forerunners of the dietary delocalisation that has
Greaves
5
 occurred across the world which has often led to a
deterioration of diversity of locally produced food
and reduced the quality of diet for the poor rural
populations.30 Conversely, in much of rapidly urba-
nising Britain improvements in living conditions,
better transport links and access to a greater variety
of imported foods led to improved life expectancy for
many of the urban poor.
