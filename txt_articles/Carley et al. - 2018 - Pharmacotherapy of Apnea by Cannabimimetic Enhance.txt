Study Objectives: There remains an important and unmet need for fully effective and acceptable treatments in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). At present, 
there are no approved drug treatments. Dronabinol has shown promise for OSA pharmacotherapy in a small dose-escalation pilot study. Here, we present 
initial findings of the Phase II PACE (Pharmacotherapy of Apnea by Cannabimimetic Enhancement) trial, a fully blinded parallel groups, placebo-controlled 
randomized trial of dronabinol in people with moderate or severe OSA.
Methods: By random assignment, 73 adults with moderate or severe OSA received either placebo (N = 25), 2.5 mg dronabinol (N = 21), or 10 mg dronabinol 
(N = 27) daily, 1 hour before bedtime for up to 6 weeks.
Results: At baseline, overall apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was 25.9 ± 11.3, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was 11.45 ± 3.8, maintenance of 
wakefulness test (MWT) mean latency was 19.2 ± 11.8 minutes, body mass index was 33.4 ± 5.4 kg/m2, and age was 53.6 ± 9.0 years. The number and severity 
of adverse events, and treatment adherence (0.3 ± 0.6 missed doses/week) were equivalent among all treatment groups. Participants receiving 10 mg/day of 
dronabinol expressed the highest overall satisfaction with treatment (p = .04). In comparison to placebo, dronabinol dose-dependently reduced AHI by 10.7 ± 4.4 
(p = .02) and 12.9 ± 4.3 (p = .003) events/hour at doses of 2.5 and 10 mg/day, respectively. Dronabinol at 10 mg/day reduced ESS score by −3.8 ± 0.8 points 
from baseline (p < .0001) and by −2.3 ± 1.2 points in comparison to placebo (p = .05). MWT sleep latencies, gross sleep architecture, and overnight oxygenation 
parameters were unchanged from baseline in any treatment group.
Conclusions: These findings support the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in people with OSA. In comparison to placebo, dronabinol was associated with 
lower AHI, improved self-reported sleepiness, and greater overall treatment satisfaction. Larger scale clinical trials will be necessary to clarify the best potential 
approach(es) to cannabinoid therapy in OSA.
Keywords: obstructive sleep apnea, pharmacotherapy, cannabinoid, clinical trial.
INTRODUCTION
The burden of untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syn-
drome in the general population is immense.1 Longitudinal 
studies with up to 20 years of follow-up demonstrate OSA to 
be an independent risk factor for both incidence and progres-
sion of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and depression, as well 
as mortality.1–4 This burden is amplified by the fact that health 
care utilization and costs among people with OSA are double 
those of age, body mass index (BMI), and gender matched 
controls.2 The first-line treatment, positive airway pressure 
(PAP), improves quality of life, reduces daytime sleepiness, 
lowers blood pressure, diminishes hospital admissions and 
health care costs, and increases survival in people with OSA.2 
Unfortunately, PAP is cumbersome and difficult for many 
patients to tolerate, yielding poor long-term adherence rates.5–7 
 
Thus, there remains a critical unmet medical need for novel 
OSA therapies.
Drug treatments for OSA have been sought for many years, 
but effective agents remain to be identified.8–10 Based on a 
series of animal investigations, we proposed that drugs which 
dampen afferent vagal feedback to the medulla may be effect-
ive in stabilizing respiratory pattern generation and increasing 
activation of upper airway dilating muscles during sleep (for a 
review, see Ref.11). Nodose ganglion cells express a variety of 
somatic receptors including excitatory serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) 
and inhibitory cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors.12,13 We pre-
viously demonstrated that dronabinol, a nonselective CB1 and 
CB2 receptor agonist, reduced the frequency of spontaneous 
central apneas in a rodent model of sleep-related breathing 
disorder.14 In an initial small scale dose-escalation pilot study, 
we further demonstrated that dronabinol significantly reduced 
the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) in 17 patients with moder-
ate-to-severe OSA.15
Here, 
we 
report 
initial 
findings 
from 
the 
PACE 
(Pharmacotherapy of Apnea by Cannabimimetic Enhancement) 
study; a Phase II multisite, fully blinded, parallel groups, ran-
domized placebo-controlled clinical trial of dronabinol in par-
ticipants with moderate or severe OSA. We hypothesized that 
dronabinol would dose-dependently reduce OSA severity and 
daytime sleepiness in comparison to placebo.
Statement of Significance
Untreated or insufficiently treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with significant independent risks for incidence and progression of 
cardiovascular, metabolic, and behavioral morbidities. Positive airway pressure, the current frontline therapy, is efficacious but difficult to tolerate and  
long-term adherence is poor. There are no approved drug treatments for OSA. Here, we report initial results from the largest and longest randomized 
controlled trial to date of any putative drug treatment for OSA. The findings suggest the therapeutic potential of dronabinol, a nonselective cannabinoid 
agonist, in OSA. Future trials will be necessary to clarify the best approach(es) to cannabinoid therapy in OSA.

METHODS
Participants
Participants aged 21 to 65 years with known or suspected 
OSA were drawn from the clinical populations of two ter-
tiary-care sleep centers (University of Illinois at Chicago 
and Northwestern University). Additional participants were 
recruited from the community via print and radio advertising. 
Participants with AHI ≥ 15 and ≤50 documented by screening 
polysomnography (PSG) were randomized to treatment group 
subject to the following exclusion criteria: Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale (ESS) score < 7 (to exclude nonsleepy participants); BMI 
> 45; motor vehicle accident or “near-miss” due to sleepiness 
(self-report) within 2 years; arterial oxygen saturation < 75% 
for more than 5% of total sleep time on baseline (screening) 
PSG; severe OSA that in the investigator’s judgment precluded 
delaying (re)institution of PAP treatment; prior upper airway 
surgery for snoring or OSA as an adult; significant defect in 
nasal patency due to anatomical abnormality or uncontrolled 
rhinitis; bariatric surgery within 2 years; medically managed 
weight-loss program within 6 months; noninvasive treatment 
for OSA within 1 month (self-report); history of shift work or 
rotating shifts within 1 month; any clinically significant uncon-
trolled cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, hepatic, 
renal, hematologic, endocrine (including type 1 diabetes), neu-
rological, urogenital, psychiatric, or sleep disorder (other than 
OSA); seizure disorder; use of CNS active drugs; pregnancy; 
recreational drug use or positive urine drug screen; or clinic-
ally significant abnormality on complete blood count or liver 
function tests. This study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Boards of the University of Illinois at Chicago and 
Northwestern University.
Study Protocol
The overall protocol included six laboratory visits spanning 7–8 
weeks. During the initial visit, after providing written informed 
consent, all participants underwent general and detailed sleep 
histories, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. 
After a 5–10-day placebo run-in period, visit 2 completed the 
screening process, including baseline overnight laboratory 
PSG, maintenance of wakefulness testing (MWT), and comple-
tion of the ESS and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for 
Medication (TSQM)—a well-established and validated instru-
ment for use in individuals with chronic disease.16 Participants 
meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized 
to a treatment group. Randomized participants completed daily 
self-administration of study drug for 6 weeks, returning to the 
laboratory every 2 weeks for overnight PSG, MWT, physical 
examination, and questionnaire completion. A final exit visit 
was completed 2–5 days after final drug administration.
Figure 1 depicts the disposition of all enrolled participants. 
Four hundred seventeen participants provided initial informed 
consent to participate and were enrolled. Seventy-eight of the 
417 enrolled participants met all inclusion/exclusion crite-
ria and 73 of these participants agreed to continue and were 
randomized to specific treatment groups. Fifty-three of these 
participants had moderate OSA (15 ≤ AHI < 30) and 20 had 
severe OSA (30 ≤ AHI ≤ 50). The randomization schedule was 
prepared and maintained by the investigational pharmacy at the 
University of Illinois at Chicago. The most frequent reasons for 
participant exclusion during the screening process were AHI 
out of range (97), reported recreational drug use or positive 
urine screen (60), ESS < 7 (24), use of CNS active medications 
(16), and BMI out of range (15). An additional 34 participants 
declined to continue their participation after initial enrollment 
but prior to final screening. Although the randomization sched-
ule was balanced, the number of participants who completed the 
study per-protocol ranged from 17 to 20 per treatment group.
Randomized participants initiated treatment the night imme-
diately following their baseline screening PSG. Each rand-
omized participant was provided blinded study agent in white 
capsules prepared on coded blister cards labeled with the date 
for each pill to be taken as well as storage and administra-
tion instructions. Participants self-administered one capsule 
by mouth, 60 minutes before bedtime, and completed a sleep/
activity/drug-administration log daily throughout their partici-
pation. Participants were randomized to one of the three treat-
ment groups: Placebo, 2.5 mg/day dronabinol or 10 mg/day 
dronabinol. These doses were selected based upon the previous 
pilot study of dronabinol in OSA15 and on the FDA-approved 
clinical dosing for appetite stimulation in AIDS-related wasting 
(2.5 to 20 mg per day).17 Participants maintained daily dosing 
for 42 days with repeated laboratory visits on days 14, 28, and 
42. Each 14-day card supply carried four labeled reserve doses, 
allowing a ±2-day window for scheduling of repeat visits and 
also to replace lost or damaged dose units. They returned all 
unused study medication and were provided a new supply at 
Figure 1.—Workflow diagram illustrating the disposition of 417 
enrolled in the protocol.

each laboratory visit. Participants randomized to the Placebo 
or 2.5 mg/day groups received their assigned doses each day 
throughout the 42-day treatment period. In order to comply with 
FDA-approved dronabinol labeling, participants randomized 
to the 10 mg/day group completed an initial dose escalation 
phase, receiving 2.5 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 5 mg/day 
for 7 days, and then 10 mg/day dronabinol for the final 14 days 
of the 28-day treatment period. Treatment adherence was 
assessed by self-report (logged) study drug administration and 
by return of unused dosage units. At the initial screening visit, 
participants were instructed to maintain a regular schedule and 
sleep/wake/activity pattern throughout their participation. They 
were given sleep/activity/drug-administration logs, instructed 
in their use, and asked to return completed logs at each subse-
quent visit. They were cautioned that the study medication may 
cause drowsiness and that they should refrain from driving or 
operating equipment until they determined their reaction to the 
medication. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored by sched-
uled phone calls from study coordinators, by study logs, and by 
physician evaluation at laboratory visits.
Participants underwent overnight PSG/MWT at either 
University of Illinois at Chicago or Northwestern University. 
Participants reported to the sleep center at 20:30 and were 
instrumented for electroencephalogram (EEG; C3/A2, C4/A1, 
F3/A2, F4/A1, O1/A2, O2/A1), bilateral electrooculogram, 
electromyogram (submental, bilateral anterior tibial), electro-
cardiogram, oronasal airflow (thermistor and nasal pressure 
transducer), thoracoabdominal motion (piezo crystals), arterial 
oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, snoring, and body posi-
tion. All signals, including infrared digital video, were acquired 
and stored using Alice5 (Respironics) or Polysmith 8 (Nihon 
Kodon) digital PSG systems. All biopotential signals were 
digitized at 500 samples per second. Records were securely 
transferred to a centralized data coordinating center using the 
European Data Format. Participants were administered their 
study medication 60 minutes before lights out when in the lab-
oratory and were given an 8-hour time in bed sleep opportunity.
Sleep was scored by a single registered polysomnographic tech-
nologist according to standard criteria on 30-second epochs, and 
respiratory events were scored according to American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine guidelines.18 Specifically, hypopneas were 
scored when a reduction in airflow of >50% was associated 
with either an oxygen desaturation of >3% or an arousal. EEG 
arousals were scored according to American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine guidelines.19 Time in bed (TIB) was computed as the 
number of minutes in bed between lights out and lights on, total 
sleep time (TST) as the number of minutes of sleep between 
lights out and lights on, and sleep efficiency as the ratio of 100 × 
TST/TIB. The distribution of sleep stages was separately com-
puted as percentages of total sleep time for stage N1 or N2, stage 
N3, and stage rapid eye movement (REM).
Commencing 2 hours after completion of each overnight 
PSG, a 4-trial 40-minute MWT protocol was conducted accord-
ing to guidelines published by the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine.20 Specifically, trials were separated by 2 hours, and 
for each trial, participants were seated comfortably in the same 
room used for overnight testing and instructed to sit still and 
remain awake for as long as possible, without looking dir-
ectly into the light. Indirect illumination was provided with an 
intensity at the participant’s eyes of approximately 0.1–0.15 
lumens. Each trial was ended after 40 minutes of wakefulness, 
or after 10 consecutive epochs of sleep. For each trial, sleep 
latency was defined as three consecutive epochs of stage 1 
sleep or one epoch of any other sleep stage, based on central 
and occipital EEG derivations. A latency of 40 minutes was 
assigned if sleep was not observed. A single board-certified 
polysomnographer, blinded to participant and treatment, scored 
all PSG and MWT studies reported here.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses reported here are based on the intent to treat (ITT) 
population, comprising all participants who received at least 
one dose of study medication (N = 73). Safety was assessed by 
tabulation of the frequency and nature of AEs in relation to treat-
ment group, as well as other biometric variables. Tolerability 
was assessed by tabulation of TSQM scores, again in relation to 
treatment group and biometric variables. Adherence to the med-
ication regimen (quantified by missed doses per 2-week treat-
ment interval) was used as a secondary tolerability measure. 
Measures of association were tested by the likelihood ratio (χ2).
The primary efficacy measure was changed from baseline 
in the AHI at the end of treatment. The changes in AHI in 
the active treatment groups were compared with the Placebo 
group. Additional primary endpoints included changes in ESS 
score and MWT mean sleep latency. Changes in AHI, ESS, and 
MWT were assessed using direct likelihood estimation of linear 
mixed effect models. Because the individual participants were 
assessed at multiple time points during the trial, these models 
included participant-specific random effects to account for the 
correlation between these measurements. We chose the direct 
likelihood estimation method, as “likelihood methods are in 
principle the most efficient because they do not involve simula-
tion at all.”21 This approach carried the additional advantage that 
data imputation methods were un-necessary.22 This modeling 
approach also allowed specific contrasts between active treat-
ment groups and the Placebo group to be assessed at each avail-
able time point.22 Baseline values of age, race, ethnicity, gender, 
and AHI scores were introduced into the models as potential 
explanatory covariates. Similar models were employed to con-
duct secondary endpoint analyses of change in AHI stratified 
according to event type (apnea/hypopnea) and sleep stage (non-
rapid eye movement [NREM]/REM), as well as to measures of 
sleep architecture and oxygenation. Assessment of these sec-
ondary endpoints was viewed as exploratory and p values are 
reported without adjustment.
A priori power calculation suggested that 37 participants per 
treatment group would be sufficient to detect simultaneous 
effects in three primary endpoints, with an α level of 0.05 and a 
power for each endpoint of 80%. This estimate was based on the 
effect size for dronabinol on AHI (Cohen’s d = 0.59) estimated 
from our previous pilot study of dronabinol in OSA.15 In all 
cases, p < .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents baseline characteristics of the full ITT popu-
lation. There were no significant differences between treatment 
groups in polysomnographic characteristics, blood pressure, 
BMI, or gender, race, or ethnicity distributions. Age did differ

between treatment groups with placebo participants being old-
est and low dose dronabinol participants being youngest. These 
age differences were not clinically meaningful. Additionally, 
there were trends toward differences in ESS score and MWT 
mean sleep latency at baseline between treatment groups. 
Participants’ characteristics did not differ between the two 
recruiting sites in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, or base-
line AHI, ESS, or MWT scores. The majority of participants 
randomized at the University of Illinois at Chicago were African 
American, whereas the majority of participants randomized at 
Northwestern University were white (p = .06).
Safety
Most (88%) participants experienced one or more AEs during 
their participation. The likelihood of reporting one or more 
AEs did not differ according to treatment group (p = .16), 
gender (p = .35), race (p = .49), or ethnicity (p = .72). 
 
The average number of AEs reported by the 73 participants 
in the ITT group was 4.1 ± 4.0 and this did not differ from 
Placebo (3.4 ± 2.9) among participants receiving either 2.5 mg/
day (2.8 ± 3.6) or 10 mg/day (5.8 ± 4.7) of dronabinol. The 
number of AEs reported by women (5.5 ± 5.6) tended to be 
higher than the number reported by men (3.4 ± 3.1; p = .057 by 
one-way ANOVA); and the number reported by black partici-
pants (5.4 ± 5.1) was significantly higher than reported by white 
participants (2.9 ± 2.3; p = .03 by Scheffe test).
The most frequently reported verbatim AEs included sleepi-
ness/drowsiness (N = 25; 8% of total AEs reported), headache 
(N = 24; 8%), nausea/vomiting (N = 23; 8%), and dizziness/
lightheadedness (N = 12; 4%). The frequency of these AEs did 
not differ according to treatment group (p > .1 for each).
As shown in Table 2, severity was rated as mild for 73% of 
AEs, moderate for 25%, and severe for only 2%; the distribution 
of AE severity did not differ by randomization group (p = .47).

Similarly, AE severity did not differ by ethnicity (p = .16), but 
women versus men tended to report more severe AEs (p = .06), 
as did black versus white participants (p = .02). Half of all AEs 
were judged to be unrelated to the study agent, with 44% judged 
as possibly related and 5% as probably related.
Of the 73 participants randomized to treatment, two par-
ticipants experienced serious adverse events: one participant 
was struck by a car while riding a bicycle during the placebo 
run-in period and discontinued participation; one participant 
experienced diarrhea and vomiting while on treatment and was 
admitted to the hospital for hydration and monitoring. This par-
ticipant was released after 24 hours and continued to complete 
the study—the hospital admission was not reported to the study 
team until after discharge. This AE was judged to be possibly 
related to study medication. Six other participants withdrew or 
were withdrawn by investigators due to adverse events. One 
participant experienced lactose intolerance during the placebo 
run-in period and withdrew; one participant reported flu-like 
symptoms that were disclosed to have started before randomi-
zation and withdrew; one participant experienced dizziness and 
vision changes possibly related to study medication and was 
withdrawn; one participant reported vertigo probably related 
to study medication and withdrew; one participant experienced 
ECG arrhythmias detected during PSG after 4 weeks of treat-
ment, which were judged to be possibly related to study medi-
cation and was withdrawn; one participant reported headache, 
dizziness, and vomiting during the first 2 weeks of treatment 
judged to be possibly related to study medication and was 
withdrawn.
Tolerability
As illustrated in Table 3, the TSQM allowed the participant to 
rate overall treatment satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale from 
“extremely dissatisfied” to “extremely satisfied.” The distribu-
tion of scores on this scale did not differ (p = .26) between ran-
domization groups at the end of the placebo run-in period. In 
contrast, there was a significant association between treatment 
satisfaction and randomization group at the end of 6-weeks 
treatment (Table 3; p = .04), with participants receiving 10 mg/
day dronabinol expressing the greatest overall satisfaction.
As noted above, 7 of the 73 participants randomized to treat-
ment discontinued participation prior to completing the protocol 
due to a variety of adverse events. An additional 10 participants 
elected to discontinue prior to completing the protocol due to 
a range of reasons such as taking a new job, family illness, 
unexpected travel requirements, or participant burden of partic-
ipation. Thus, 56 participants completed participation per-pro-
tocol. Randomized participants who completed the protocol did 
not differ from participants discontinuing early according to 
treatment randomization group (p = .15), BMI (p = .28), base-
line AHI (p = .97), TSQM scores (p = .29), race (p = .21), or 
ethnicity (p = .26), but there was a trend for a greater fraction 
of men (15/52) to discontinue than women (2/21) (p = .07). The 
average number of AEs reported by randomized participants 
who discontinued participation early (4.12 ± 3.10) did not dif-
fer (p = .99 by ANOVA) from those who completed the protocol 
(4.11 ± 4.31).
Another metric of tolerability is adherence to treatment. 
Table 4 summarizes the number of “missed doses” for each 
2-week treatment interval. Overall, nearly two-thirds of partici-
pants took all scheduled doses and returned the correct number 
of dosage units across all treatment intervals. The maximum 
number of missed doses in any 2-week treatment interval was 
7. As shown in Table 4, the distribution of missed doses was 
equivalent during all three treatment intervals (p = .22) and was 
equivalent for all three treatment groups during each 2-week 
interval (p > .33 for each).
Neither placebo treatment (−0.2 ± 2.6 kg) nor dronabinol at 
2.5 mg/day (−0.5 ± 3.9 kg) or 10 mg/day (0.5 ± 0.7 kg) caused 
any weight change among study participants (p ≥ .4 for each).
Efficacy—Primary
By design, the primary efficacy endpoint for this study was 
change from baseline in AHI after 6-weeks of treatment. 
Figure 2A depicts the end-of-treatment change from baseline 
AHI for each of the treatment groups. With respect to baseline, 
the AHI increased significantly among Placebo participants 
(p = .01), whereas it decreased among participants receiving 
dronabinol. ∆AHI was significantly negative in comparison 
to Placebo for participants receiving dronabinol at either 2.5 
(p = .02) or 10 (p = .003) mg/day. ∆AHI did not differ sig-
nificantly between the 2.5 and 10 mg/day dronabinol groups. 
We repeated this analysis entering age, race, ethnicity, and 
baseline AHI as covariates. After adjusting for these covari-
ates, the main effect of treatment group remained significant 
(Table 5), whereas none of the other covariates was significant.

After adjustment, the increase in AHI from baseline in the 
Placebo-treated group was smaller and not statistically signif-
icant (p = .45). Conversely, the decrease from baseline AHI in 
the group treated with 10 mg/day dronabinol was greater than 
without adjustment. Again, adjusted ∆AHI was significantly 
negative in comparison to Placebo for participants receiv-
ing dronabinol at either 2.5 (p = .02) or 10 (p = .004) mg/day. 
Adjusted ∆AHI did not differ significantly between the 2.5 and 
10 mg/day dronabinol groups (Table 5).
Self-reported daytime sleepiness, assessed by the ESS, was 
a second primary efficacy endpoint. In comparison to base-
line, participants receiving Placebo treatment and those receiv-
ing 2.5 mg/day dronabinol showed no change in ESS score 
(Figure 2B). In contrast, participants receiving 10 mg/day dron-
abinol showed significantly decreased sleepiness in comparison 
to baseline (p < .0001), and this decrease was also significant 
with respect to the changes observed with treatment by Placebo 
(p = .05) or 2.5 mg/day dronabinol (p = .002). Conversely, 
objective sleepiness measured by the MWT mean sleep latency, 
the third primary efficacy endpoint, did not change from base-
line in any treatment group (Figure 2C).
Efficacy—Secondary
Table 5 delineates the effects of treatment on disordered breath-
ing events in the ITT population stratified by sleep stage, event 
type, and body position, showing values adjusted for age, gen-
der, race, ethnicity, and baseline AHI. As for overall AHI, both 
NREM AHI and REM AHI decreased significantly in compari-
son to Placebo for both 2.5 and 10 mg/day dronabinol treatment 
groups, which did not differ significantly from each other.
As shown in Table 5, these effects on AHI were driven pri-
marily by changes in the expression of apneas. As for overall 
AHI, both the NREM apnea index (AI) and the REM AI were 
decreased significantly with respect to Placebo by both doses 
of dronabinol. In fact, the impact of 10 mg/day dronabinol on 
REM AI was the largest treatment effect size for any event type 
in any sleep stage. In contrast, dronabinol had little net effect on 
the expression of hypopneas, with only the higher dronabinol 
dose tending to decrease NREM hypopnea index (HI) in com-
parison to Placebo (p = .09).
Table 6 demonstrates the impact of treatment on sleep archi-
tecture, sleep position, and oxygenation measures, providing 
baseline and end of 6-week treatment values for each parame-
ter. Statistical assessments of significance for overall treatment 
effects and contrasts between treatment groups were again 
derived from linear mixed models applied to within participant 
changes from baseline to end of treatment using the per-proto-
col dataset. As can be seen from the table, there were no statis-
tically significant changes in sleep architecture or oxygenation 
observed for any of the treatment groups, with the exception

of a slight increase in REM% among participants treated with 
dronabinol and a concomitant decrease in REM% among 
Placebo-treated participants. In addition, there were no signif-
icant changes in the duration of supine sleep from baseline to 
end of treatment in any treatment group.
Efficacy—Responder Analysis
No clear consensus exists regarding what is a clinically meaning-
ful response to OSA treatment. If we arbitrarily consider a final 
on-treatment AHI of ≤15 plus a reduction from baseline AHI of 
≥50% to represent a clinically meaningful treatment response, 
6 of 39 participants randomized to receive dronabinol were 
treatment “responders,” in contrast to 0 of 17 participants rand-
omized to receive Placebo treatment (p = .03 for the association 
between active versus placebo treatment and responder status). 
Figure 3 presents the individual treatment responses of these 
six individuals in terms of AHI (mean decrease = 15.0 ± 4.0), 
NREM AHI (mean decrease = 10.3 ± 7.6), and REM AHI (mean 
decrease = 33.0 ± 17.8). Responders exhibited a threefold 
greater decrease in ESS score (−4.8 ± 4.3) than did nonrespond-
ers (1.6 ± 4.1), but this did not achieve statistical significance 
(p = .08), perhaps due to the small number of responders. There 
was no difference between responders (−2.0 ± 8.1 minutes) 
and nonresponders (−1.5 ± 12.0 minutes) in treatment-related 
change in mean sleep latency on the MWT.
Because there were no “responders” among the Placebo-
treated group, we focused on exploratory analysis of differing 
characteristics between responders and nonresponders on the 39 
individuals who completed the protocol and were randomized 
to receive active treatment.
Treatment responders were slightly younger (47.8 ± 11.6 years) 
in comparison to nonresponders (54.8 ± 5.9 years; p = .03 by 
ANOVA), but responders and nonresponders were equivalent 
in terms of BMI, change in BMI, baseline AHI, baseline ESS, 
number of missed treatment doses, and number of AEs reported 
(Table 7). Sleep architecture did not differ between respond-
ers and nonresponders in terms of sleep efficiency, sleep onset 
latency, REM latency, arousal index, or percentages of slow-
wave, NREM, or REM sleep (p > .10 for each). However, 
responders did achieve more total sleep than nonresponders 
during baseline PSG recordings (Table 7).
In contrast to overall sleep architecture, the characteristics 
of disordered breathing did differ significantly, with respond-
ers exhibiting a greater preponderance of REM-related apnea/
hypopnea and a shorter average event duration in comparison 
to nonresponders. Both the REM AHI and the ratio of REM-
AHI/overall-AHI were significantly higher among responders 
(Table 7).
We also employed logistic regression to model treatment-re-
sponder status. Age and race (using white as the index race) 
showed significant effects on the odds of being a treat-
ment responder, with increasing age decreasing those odds 
(OR = 0.87 ± 0.06; p = .046) and black or Asian race increasing 
those odds (OR = 3.22 ± 1.90; p = .047).
DISCUSSION
This randomized, fully blinded, placebo-controlled trial sup-
ports that dronabinol is safe and well-tolerated in people with

moderate or severe OSA. Moreover, dronabinol dose-de-
pendently reduced AHI from baseline in comparison to Placebo 
during both NREM and REM sleep. This effect was accom-
panied by a dose-dependent reduction in self-reported but 
not objective daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, participants 
receiving the higher dose of dronabinol expressed significantly 
greater overall treatment satisfaction. We found no evidence for 
improved sleep architecture with dronabinol treatment.
The safety and tolerability of dronabinol use by people with 
OSA are supported by the present findings. Nearly 90% of all 
participants reported at least one adverse event while on treat-
ment, but this proportion did not differ between Placebo and 
active treatment groups. Furthermore, neither the number nor 
severity of AEs differed between Placebo and either dronabinol 
treatment groups. There was a single serious adverse event 
involving diarrhea and vomiting that required overnight hos-
pitalization. This serious AE was judged as possibly related 
to the study drug, but was transient and did not recur. The 
participant went on to complete the study. All of these obser-
vations argue that dronabinol, at doses from 2.5 to 10 mg/day, 
is safe for use by medically stable patients with moderate or 
severe OSA. Participants also tolerated and adhered well to 
daily self-administration of dronabinol. The average number 
of “missed” doses reported during each 2-week treatment 
interval was less than one, and this did not differ between the 
three treatment groups (p = .93). Conversely, overall treatment 
satisfaction did differ significantly among the groups, with 
those receiving 10 mg/day dronabinol expressing the greatest

treatment satisfaction on the TSQM. Although not strictly 
a tolerability measure, weight gain is undesirable for most 
individuals with OSA and dronabinol is clinically indicated 
for appetite stimulation in AIDS-related wasting syndrome.17 
Therefore, it is important to note that dronabinol did not cause 
weight gain over a 6-week treatment period in individuals with 
moderate or severe OSA.
This study also supports the potential efficacy of dronabinol, 
demonstrating improvements in AHI and ESS score in com-
parison to placebo. The potential mechanisms of these effects 
therefore have clinical relevance. Although the mechanisms of 
dronabinol’s action on respiratory pattern and upper airway sta-
bility cannot be determined from the present study, increased 
vagal afferent activity has been hypothesized to play a role in 
OSA. For example, apnea exacerbation has been associated 
with use of vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy.23 Afferent 
vagal neurons express a range of somatic receptors, including 
both inhibitory CB1
12,13 and excitatory 5-HT3
24 subtypes. Under 
this hypothesis, activation of nodose ganglion 5-HT3 receptors 
would be expected to increase apnea propensity, whereas acti-
vation of CB1 receptors would be expected to attenuate apnea 
expression. Using an animal model for spontaneous sleep-re-
lated central apneas, both of these effects have been demon-
strated.14,25 Intraperitoneal serotonin, which does not cross the 
blood brain barrier, increased apnea frequency,25 whereas both 
dronabinol and oleamide, an endocannabinoid modulator,26,27 
dose-dependently reduced apnea frequency.14 Furthermore, 
pretreatment with dronabinol completely blocked the apnea 
exacerbation produced by intraperitoneal serotonin.14
The present findings extend those of our previous pilot study, 
expanding the treatment duration from 3 to 6 weeks, adding 
multiple additional outcome measures and employing a fully 
blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel groups randomized design.

Cannabinoid Therapy of Apnea—Carley et al.
In the present study, the mean change in AHI for participants 
treated with 10 mg/day dronabinol was −12.9 in comparison 
to the Placebo group, with a Cohen’s d effect size of 0.80. This 
is in line with the findings of the pilot study, which demon-
strated a mean treatment effect on AHI of −11.3 with a Cohen’s 
d effect size of 0.56 for eight participants receiving 1 week of 
dronabinol at a dose of 10 mg/day. Collectively, these results 
suggest that dronabinol may meaningfully affect breathing con-
trol in OSA, at least in individuals with mild or moderate dis-
ease severity. These findings further argue that the impact of 
dronabinol on AHI is durable, at least for 6 weeks. This is an 
important observation because the endocannabinoid system is 
thought to play important roles in synaptic plasticity,28,29 which 
could cause dronabinol effects to change over time. Sukys-
Claudino et al. reported an average decrease in AHI of 13.9 
(effect size = 0.23) following 1 month of treatment by 10 mg/
day donepezil, suggesting that cholinergic signaling may be an 
important aspect of breathing control in people with OSA.30 In 
contrast, a single 10 mg dose of donepezil yielded no change in 
AHI.31 It is not possible from the present study to determine to 
what extent effects of dronabinol on sleep disordered breathing 
may be mediated by changes in cholinergic neurotransmission.
Most people with OSA experience a significant number of dis-
ordered breathing events during both NREM and REM sleep. 
Thus, for any therapeutic intervention to be generally effective, 
it should be able to control disordered breathing throughout all 
stages of sleep. Here, we observed significant dronabinol-related 
decreases of disordered breathing events during both NREM 
and REM sleep. This is in contrast to our previous pilot study 
in which REM AHI was not decreased by dronabinol at doses 
between 2.5 and 10 mg/day.15 This discrepancy may reflect the 
smaller scale and/or shorter treatment duration of the pilot study 
in comparison to the present PACE trial. Consistent with this 
possibility, in the present study, the magnitude of the 10 mg/day 
dronabinol effect on REM AHI was only −3.6 with an effect size 
of 0.10 after 2 weeks of treatment, increasingly significantly to 
−11.9 with an effect size of 0.34 after 4 weeks of treatment.
The only statistically significant treatment-related change in 
sleep architecture associated with dronabinol treatment was a 
slight shift toward increased REM sleep percentage (Table 6). 
However, the mean baseline sleep efficiency for participants 
randomized to receive 10 mg/kg dronabinol was 83%, which is 
considered in the normal range for the laboratory environment; 
a nonsignificant improvement to 88% was observed, suggest-
ing a possible ceiling effect. Arousal index did not decrease, 
but many disordered breathing events are not associated with 
EEG-observable arousal. Furthermore, scoring guidelines for 
EEG arousals place duration constraints on detection of arous-
als and on the duration of preceding sleep necessary for arousal 
detection.19 These constraints may collectively contribute to the 
observation that the frequency of arousals was reduced less than 
the frequency of apneas and hypopneas in the present study. 
Percentages of slow-wave sleep were normal at baseline for all 
treatment groups, making it unsurprising that these percentages 
did not change significantly with treatment.
OSA is recognized as a multifactorial disorder, and increas-
ing attention has been paid to defining various OSA phenotypes 
based on the expectation that such phenotypes may respond dif-
ferently to various treatment interventions (for a recent review, 
see Ref.32). From this perspective, it is unlikely that any drug 
treatment could be fully effective in all people with OSA. Here, 
despite clinically meaningful and statistically significant effects 
of dronabinol in reducing AHI and increasing daytime alert-
ness, we observed considerable interparticipant variability in 
the magnitude of these effects. Although the study size was too 
small to make any firm characterization of “responders,” we 
note that participants with predominantly REM-related apnea 
appeared to exhibit the greatest treatment responses, as did 
younger and non-white individuals.
Limitations
To the best of our knowledge, the PACE clinical trial is the larg-
est and lengthiest randomized controlled trial of any putative pri-
mary drug treatment for OSA. Despite this fact, the study may 
remain underpowered to detect simultaneous clinically mean-
ingful effects in multiple endpoints. Despite randomizing only 
21 to 27 participants per treatment group, we did in fact detect 
significant differences between Placebo and 10 mg/day dronab-
inol treatments for changes in AHI and ESS, but the observed 
effect sizes for these responses were greater than or equal to the 
estimate used for the power calculation. Considering the change 
with treatment in MWT scores, we observed a slight improve-
ment in mean sleep latency for participants receiving 10 mg/day 
dronabinol and a reduction in sleep latency (greater sleepiness) 
for those receiving Placebo. However, the observed effect size 
for this difference was only 0.31 (Cohen’s d). Thus, based on the 
powering of the PACE study, it is possible that dronabinol may 
provide a small improvement in objective alertness measured by 
the MWT which can only be revealed by larger future studies.
Another study limitation arises from the fact that only a single 
night of in-laboratory polysomnography was employed to assess 
the baseline severity of OSA in each participant. Although the 
“first-night effect” may substantially be the quantity and quality 
of sleep, this effect may have been minimized in the present 
study participants for at least two reasons: (1) all of our partici-
pants were sleepy at baseline (ESS score of 8–19) and (2) most 
of our participants had previously undergone clinical polysom-
nography. Nonetheless, significant night-to-night variability of 
AHI has been reported. Although this random variability would 
lead to AHI measurement imprecision, based on the study 
design, this imprecision was most probably evenly distributed 
among all groups and did not contribute meaningfully to the 
observed average treatment effects.
In view of the numerous inclusion/exclusion criteria, there 
are also limitations to the generalizability of findings from 
the PACE trial. Considering the effect size on AHI, dronab-
inol might prove to be most appropriate for individuals with 
mild-to-moderate OSA, but individuals with mild disorder 
were excluded from the present study. The present PACE trial 
included only participants with daytime sleepiness. Although 
there was no correlation between baseline ESS score and treat-
ment response assessed by change in AHI (p = .38), it remains 
unknown how patients without significant daytime sleepiness 
might respond to dronabinol. Additionally, individuals with 
OSA are often taking other CNS active drugs which could have 
impact on the efficacy of dronabinol, and these were excluded 
from the present study. Identifying the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of dronabinol in the broader clinical population of

individuals with OSA will require larger future studies with 
fewer exclusion criteria.
Another effect of failing to fully achieve randomization tar-
gets is the fact that the group sizes were not fully balanced. This 
fact may have contributed to the slight differences in age as well 
as baseline scores for the ESS and MWT. We do not believe that 
these differences materially affected the analysis or interpreta-
tion of findings, however, because introducing age as well as 
baseline values of ESS and MWT into the linear mixed models 
for efficacy analyses did not change the findings.
Another potential limitation is the fact that participants rand-
omized to Placebo treatment experienced a worsening of their 
OSA during participation in the protocol. It is not immediately 
obvious why this should occur, and we note that AHI did not 
exhibit any significant treatment-related increase after adjust-
ment for participant age, gender, race, ethnicity, and base-
line AHI in the models. All participants exhibited moderate or 
severe OSA upon randomization, with AHI between 15 and 
50. Although fully documented clinical histories were not gen-
erally available, it is probably that all of these participants had 
developed OSA months or years prior to enrollment. It would 
therefore not be expected that the natural progression of their 
disease over a period of 6 weeks would account for the observed 
increases in AHI among participants in the Placebo treatment 
group. Nor did clinically significant progression of comorbid 
medical conditions probably contribute to the observed increase 
in AHI, given that participants were medically stable upon ran-
domization, and were closely monitored and evaluated by a 
physician every 2 weeks during their participation. AHI often is 
higher during supine than nonsupine sleep. If participants rand-
omized to placebo treatment slept mostly in nonsupine positions 
during baseline evaluation but supine during subsequent evalua-
tions, this may have contributed to the observed increase in AHI 
over time on treatment. Conversely, if participants randomized 
to receive 10 mg/day dronabinol spent less time in supine sleep 
during treatment than at baseline, it may have contributed to the 
observed decrease in AHI. However, such positional effects do 
not account for our observations, because the minutes spent in 
supine sleep did not differ over time in any treatment group nor 
between treatment groups at any time point (Table 6). Moreover, 
the treatment effect of dronabinol specific to supine sleep was 
similar to the overall effect on AHI (Table 5).
In our view—and this would apply to participants randomized 
to any of the treatment groups—the mostly likely contributing 
factor to worsening OSA during the treatment period is the 
fact that potential participants were allowed to discontinue 
use of noninvasive treatments for OSA in order to participate. 
Participants were asked to verify that they had not used any 
treatment for their OSA within 1 month prior to randomization; 
it was not possible to objectively confirm this attestation.
Little is known regarding the long-term time course of OSA 
following withdrawal of noninvasive treatment. There is good 
evidence regarding the immediate or short-term impact of 
PAP withdrawal. Kribbs et al. noted that even a single night 
of PAP withdrawal caused AHI to increase significantly, but 
AHI remained at only 66% of the pretreatment baseline level.33 
This finding was replicated by Phillips et al. who observed an 
increase in AHI to 59% of baseline level after 1 night of PAP 
withdrawal34 and a further increase to ~80% of baseline level 
after 7 days of withdrawal.34,35 Kohler et al. demonstrated an 
increased AHI to 75% of baseline levels after 2-weeks of PAP 
withdrawal in people with moderate-to-severe OSA.36 Thus, 
according to available evidence, AHI does not return to pre-
treatment level within 2 weeks of PAP withdrawal. We are una-
ware of any studies documenting the time course of the return 
of AHI to pretreatment level (or higher) beyond 2 weeks of PAP 
withdrawal. Still, it is physiologically plausible that full return 
to pretreatment AHI may take many weeks or even months after 
PAP withdrawal. We speculate that such an extended time course 
may reflect immediate exacerbation of AHI due to the acute loss 
of airway splinting by the positive airway pressure, followed by 
a much slower worsening due to return of upper airway edema 
consequent to the recurrence of airway traumatizing disordered 
breathing events during sleep. Indeed, Corda et al. showed that 
pharyngeal dimensions continued to increase between 1 week 
and 6 months after institution of PAP therapy in people with 
severe OSA, suggesting that this reflects ongoing reduction in 
soft tissue edema.37 If the converse is true, then withdrawal of 
PAP treatment may result in an initial acute increase in AHI fol-
lowed by a slower recurrence of upper airway tissue edema and 
concomitant increase in AHI over a period of weeks to months. 
Collectively, these findings provide a basis to expect that some 
participants randomized into the PACE study would demon-
strate progressively increasing AHI during their participation 
over a period of 4–10 weeks after PAP withdrawal. This effect 
would then be directly observable among those participants ran-
domized to receive Placebo treatment.
CONCLUSION
This fully blinded, parallel groups, randomized placebo-con-
trolled trial demonstrates that dronabinol is safe and well toler-
ated in participants with moderate-to-severe OSA. Dronabinol 
dose-dependently reduced AHI and improved self-reported 
but not objective sleepiness in comparison to Placebo over 6 
weeks of oral administration. Dronabinol treatment may be a 
viable alternative or adjunctive treatment in selected people 
with OSA. Confirming these observations and defining the phe-
notypic characteristics of the most appropriate candidates for 
dronabinol therapy will depend on larger future trials.
