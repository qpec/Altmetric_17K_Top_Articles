 Can we make cannabis safer? 
Amir Englund, Tom P Freeman, Robin M Murray, Philip McGuire 
 
A changing cannabis climate 
The cannabis landscape is rapidly changing. Following the Single Convention on Narcotic 
Drugs in 1961, possession, distribution and use were criminalised and cannabis-related 
arrests increased significantly in Europe and North America, particularly among younger and 
ethnic minority populations 1.  In subsequent decades cannabis use has waxed and waned in 
different countries, but there has been an overall trend towards greater use in most parts of 
the world 2. This may be because prohibitive measures (scheduling substances or law 
enforcement) having little or no effect on use, abuse or substance related harms, as 
suggested by a recent systematic review 3. In the UK, the demand for treatment for 
cannabis-related problems increased by 56% in adults and 51% in those under 18 between 
the years 2005-06 and 2013-14 (Public Health England, 2014; 2015). Increased treatment-
seeking for cannabis use problems has also been evident in the US 5, and in Europe, 
cannabis has become the primary illicit drug responsible for first-time entry to drug 
treatment, although in some countries this is mainly due to referrals from the criminal 
justice system 6.  
Certain US states along with Uruguay have recently decided to allow cannabis to be sold for 
recreational purposes 7. Canada has recently proposed to legalise recreational use and 
several European countries have already lessened or dropped their criminal sanctions on 
cannabis possession and use 8.  While it is likely that such moves will decrease the cost of 
crime associated with cannabis use, the effect they will have on cannabis consumption and 
the prevalence of cannabis associated harms is unclear.  
In any event, moves toward legalization of medicinal or recreational cannabis are unlikely to 
decrease the number of people who use cannabis. However, they could facilitate measures 
to reduce population levels of harm – for example, by regulating cannabis potency and 
promoting safer (e.g. non-tobacco) routes of administration 9. It is therefore incumbent on 
 those concerned about cannabis-related harms to consider other ways in which the use of 
cannabis might be made safer. 
Cannabis is becoming more potent 
Cannabis Sativa L. contains at least 120 different compounds known as cannabinoids which 
are specific to the cannabis plant with more than 600 other compounds such as terpenoids 
and flavonoids 10,11. The most abundant of the cannabinoids are delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) which the plant produces in different 
ratios from the precursor cannabigerol (CBG), based on genes that code for certain enzymes 
(THCA-synthase and CBDA-synthase) 12. Hence, increased THC content in cannabis will be at 
the cost of CBD content. Furthermore, preventing pollination of the female plant leads to a 
much more potent product as the plant converts the plants energy to producing more 
cannabinoids rather than seeds 13. This type of cannabis is referred to as sinsemilla which 
means “without seed” in Spanish, but is commonly termed ‘skunk’ in the UK.  
Over the past 4 decades cannabis potency (its percentage of THC) has on average doubled 
worldwide 14 and CBD levels remaining low or absent in most cannabis preparations 15–18. 
Systematic cross-breeding of cannabis plants by black-market growers has yielded a market 
dominance of high-THC plants. By 2008, roughly 80% of cannabis sold on the UK black 
market was high-potency cannabis 16,  an increase from 55% in 2004-2005 15 and only 15% in 
1999-2002 19. In the US, a recent report found that the increased THC levels in cannabis over 
the last two decades was due to a shift towards high-potency (sinsemilla) as opposed to 
regularly (outdoor) grown cannabis 18. Cannabis resin can be a more potent form of 
cannabis and has been found to reach potencies of over 60% THC (per weight) in the 
Netherlands 17, while in the UK resin (aka. hash) has low potency with equal quantities of 
THC (4%) and CBD (4%) 15. More recently, new extraction techniques are being used to 
produce extremely high-potency concentrates (e.g. Butane Hash Oil) up to 75% THC 20. Even 
more concerning are synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. “Spice”) which typically act as full 
cannabinoid receptor agonists (THC is a partial agonist) and have been linked to severe 
adverse reactions including death 21. 
 
  
The significance of CBD 
The main possible adverse effects associated with cannabis use are dependence, cognitive 
and educational impairment and psychosis 22. Crucially, evidence suggests that the incidence 
of adverse consequences of cannabis use is associated with the amount of THC and CBD it 
contains. Encouragingly, it appears that increasing the CBD dose does not influence the 
pleasurable effects of THC. A recent study found that CBD given orally up to 800mg did not 
influence the pleasurable, reinforcing or intoxicating effects of a smoked cannabis cigarette 
(~4.4mg THC) 23. Two studies of inhaled cannabis vapour, with combinations including 8mg 
THC, 8mg THC + 10mg CBD and 8mg THC + 16mg CBD, found no differences in ratings of 
‘stoned’ 24,25. Lastly, a study where participants smoked their own cannabis found no 
difference in ‘stoned’ ratings when comparing low to high CBD:THC ratio strains of cannabis 
26. Although research to date has found no impact of CBD on the pleasurable effects of THC, 
more research is warranted to confirm this. 
Dependence 
Approximately one in eleven people who try cannabis will become dependent in their 
lifetime 27, although this risk is almost doubled if use starts in adolescence 28 and between 
25-50% among daily users 29. However, not all varieties of cannabis have the same liability 
towards dependence. An online survey study of over 2514 cannabis users found that high-
potency (high THC, low CBD) cannabis use was associated with a greater severity of cannabis 
dependence along with self-reported memory problems and paranoia, compared with use 
of lower potency cannabis 30. However, high-potency cannabis was rated as the preferred 
type and the type producing the best “high”. This is potentially important, as interventions 
aiming at switching users to a less potent variety may fail if the alternative lacks the 
pleasurable effects of high-potency cannabis.  
A few case reports have found that CBD can reduce the symptoms associated with 
withdrawal from cannabis 31,32, and two studies have found Sativex (CBD:THC ratio 1:1) to 
do the same 33,34 although it is not clear whether these effects were attributable to CBD, 
THC, or their  interactive effects. Lastly, in an attentional bias task, cannabis containing 
 higher levels of CBD was found to reverse the heightened salience of cannabis and food 
cues compared to cannabis without CBD 26. Therefore, varieties of cannabis with greater 
CBD content may reduce the likelihood of users developing dependence, whilst preserving 
the effects that users seek from cannabis. 
Psychosis 
High potency cannabis also carries a higher risk of psychosis as well as an earlier onset of the 
illness than low THC forms 35,36. A recent case-control study of patients with first episode of 
psychosis found that daily use of high-THC, low CBD cannabis was associated with a 5-fold 
increase in the odds of psychosis but found no such increase among users of low potency 
hash (resin) 37.  
In a Dutch population study of 1,877 participants, those who used cannabis higher in CBD 
had experienced fewer lifetime psychotic-like experiences compared to those who 
preferred varieties with less CBD 38. Some neuroimaging studies have also suggested that  
the MRI correlates of cannabis use may vary with exposure to CBD. One study found that 
regular use of high-potency cannabis was associated with alterations in the corpus callosum, 
an effect that was absent in hash users 39. Two other MRI studies have reported that 
cannabis users had smaller hippocampal volumes than non-users, but that this was not 
evident in cannabis users with hair samples that were positive for CBD 40,41. However, the 
extent to which cannabis use is associated with neuroanatomical changes remains 
controversial: studies that have matched participants on alcohol use, or have accounted for 
heritable and genetic risk, have failed to find an association between cannabis use and brain 
structure 42–44. 
Cannabis use is particularly harmful for patients already suffering from a psychotic illness. A 
recent meta-analysis found that patients who continue to use cannabis are more likely to 
relapse than their non-using counterparts 45. Moreover, continued use of high potency 
cannabis appears to be more harmful to patients with psychosis than use of cannabis with 
lower THC and a relatively high proportion of CBD 46. Sadly, clinical interventions to reduce 
cannabis use in patients with psychosis have been largely unsuccessful 47. A recent study in 
patients with a first episode of psychosis found that patients experience both the positive 
and negative effect of cannabis more intensely compared to healthy controls 48. This may 
 explain their unwillingness to stop using in spite of the negative effect the drug has on them 
and the failure of interventions in this population. Another potential factor is that reducing 
substance use usually depend on the subject having motivation and insight, both of which 
are impaired in patients with psychotic disorders 49. 
Cognition and intelligence 
There has been considerable debate regarding whether the use of cannabis may have 
lasting negative effects on memory functioning, intelligence and other aspects of cognition 
in the normal population 22. A recent study across three large samples found that cannabis 
use before the age of 17 was related to lower rates of high-school completion and degree 
attainment 50. Similarly, a 1-year follow-up study of 1155 adolescents found that weekly 
cannabis use was related to poorer performance in GCSE Maths and English at age 16 (albeit 
less than tobacco), after controlling for confounders 51. However, a large twin study found 
that early school leaving was explained by shared environmental risk factors which increases 
the likelihood for both cannabis use and early school leaving 52. These findings suggest that 
although there is a link between cannabis use and poorer educational outcomes, these 
effects may be explained by other factors. 
As for general intelligence, a 38-year follow-up study of 874 individuals found that those 
who had been dependent on cannabis for up to 20 years had experienced a drop in IQ of an 
average of 6 points 53. However, this study was limited in terms of controlling for confounds 
and a relatively small number of the total study population in the affected group. Two 
recent large scale follow-up studies have found that cannabis use is not associated with 
reduced IQ when controlling for additional confounders and genetic factors 54,55. These 
latter studies only followed participants up to the ages of 15 and 20 years and do not 
exclude the possibility that IQ might be affected if cannabis use and/or dependence is 
maintained for longer.  
Although there remains a debate on whether or not cannabis use leads to long term 
cognitive impairments or educational problems following abstinence, it is however clear 
that ongoing regular cannabis use impairs cognition. A recent meta-analysis found that 
cannabis users perform significantly worse on memory tasks than non-users, with the 
greatest impairments being in prospective memory, visual recognition, immediate and 
 delayed recall 56. The authors reported that regular use (defined as using between 4 to 20 
times/month) or more was related to worse performance while no effect was seen in light 
users (4 times/month or less). However, no significant difference is seen in users compared 
to controls following 4 weeks of abstinence 57. This is in line with PET imaging studies 
showing that downregulation of CB1 receptor densities can be reversed within 4 weeks of 
abstinence or earlier 58,59. 
Insights from cannabinoid experiments 
While being fundamental to understand the population impact of a behaviour or exposure, 
epidemiological studies come with some clear limitations. When exploring different 
outcomes between cannabis users and non-users, one can never be certain that the 
observed effects (e.g. impaired cognition) are due to use itself or confounding variables. 
Hence, experimental studies such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are highly 
informative as the same person gets exposed to both experimental conditions or has a 50% 
chance of ending up in either condition. Unlike epidemiology, RCTs allow us to infer 
causality but with the caveat that it only allows conclusions relating to the acute effects of 
the drug and not from long-term exposure. 
Experimental studies in healthy volunteers have shown that administration of high-dose 
THC can induce a range of psychological changes including transient psychotic symptoms 60–
62. They have also consistently found impairments in memory functioning in a dose response 
manner 60,63. However, studies that have combined THC with CBD have found very different 
results.  Co-administration of CBD significantly reduces THC-induced time estimation errors 
and psychological reactions 64 while a subsequent study found 1mg/kg CBD significantly 
reduced the anxiogenic effects of 0.5mg/kg THC in healthy volunteers 65. In a recent study of 
140 cannabis users, those who tested positive for both THC and CBD in hair-samples 
experienced significantly fewer psychotic-like effects compared to those testing positive for 
THC only 66. These results were later replicated in a study of recreational cannabis users 67 
The same group later administered inhaled THC (8mg) and CBD (16mg) to volunteers and 
found that CBD protected against the detrimental effects of THC on emotional processing 24. 
Furthermore, there is evidence that CBD reverses THCs illusory effects on depth perception 
68.  
 There is also evidence that CBD may reverse the negative impact of THC on cognitive 
performance. A naturalistic study of 134 cannabis users smoking their own cannabis found 
that participants using cannabis with higher CBD levels displayed no impairment on 
measures of immediate and delayed prose recall compared to when sober. By contrast, 
performance on these tasks was significantly impaired among those who used cannabis with 
equivalent THC but no CBD 69. The same group explored memory functioning in 120 users 
while analysing hair-samples for presence of CBD. Participants who tested positive for CBD 
displayed significantly better performance 67. 
In our own research we found that pre-treatment with 600mg oral CBD before the 
administration of 1.5mg intravenous THC significantly inhibited paranoia, the occurrence of 
psychotic symptom and impairments to delayed recall in 48 healthy volunteers 70. These 
effects were not attributable to changes in THC plasma levels in the CBD group. Rather, they 
appear to reflect opposite effects of THC and CBD on the brain regions that mediate 
psychotic and anxiety symptoms, and support cognitive processes like memory, emotional 
processing and response inhibition 71,72.  
Collectively, the available experimental evidence suggests that CBD, to a yet unknown 
extent, can mitigate the harmful effects of cannabis. 
Making cannabis safer 
It is vital, especially now that cannabis is becoming increasingly liberalised, that we explore 
alternative and innovative ways in which we can reduce and mitigate cannabis related 
harms. 
Firstly, there should be more focus on the co-use of tobacco and cannabis and the additive 
harm this poses, especially since cannabis is frequently used together with tobacco, 
especially in Europe 73. The use of other routes of administration such as smoke-free 
vaporisers have the potential of reducing the harmful effects the smoke poses to the user as 
well as reducing tobacco consumption 74. This may be particularly important as tobacco 
increases the addictive potential of cannabis 75–77. Furthermore, tobacco use may be an 
independent risk factor for psychosis 78, as well as modifying the risk from cannabis use 79. 
Studies of the impact of cannabis use on cognition have also found the relationship 
 weakened after controlling for use of tobacco 51,54,80. However, controlled experimental 
studies on the interaction between cannabis and tobacco are currently lacking 81. Hence, it 
is vital that future studies address tobacco when evaluating the harms of cannabis.  
Secondly, we need to better understand the harms posed by cannabis varieties with 
different THC potencies. Extremely potent cannabis concentrates (e.g. Butane Hash Oil) 
have gained popularity in the United States, where THC content is not currently regulated 82.   
Policies proposed by both Uruguay and the Netherlands of a 15% THC-cap could be 
beneficial, but are not yet based on a scientific understanding of harms posed by potencies 
above this limit 83. Alternative approaches include taxation based on THC content, although 
further research is needed their impact (including use of more harmful, synthetic 
cannabinoids). Only very recently have studies differentiated between different types of 
cannabis based on THC content 30,37–39, and most of these studies do not involve measures 
of THC and CBD content, but  proxy measures of potency, such as analysis of police seizures 
or coffee shop cannabis, and a reliance on self-report measures. Although self-report 
measures are associated with THC and CBD content, these associations are modest and are 
weaker among infrequent users 84,85. Future longitudinal studies may choose to collect 
cannabis cigarettes (joints) from their participants over the course of the study and collect 
information as to how often they would smoke such a cigarette. This will allow researchers 
to calculate a cumulative dose exposure of cannabinoids as well as tobacco – resulting in a 
far more accurate estimate of harm. This information could contribute to a cannabis use 
guideline, such as we currently have for alcohol.  
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, more knowledge is needed regarding the ratio 
between THC and CBD which reduces harm. As reviewed above, the available evidence 
suggests that CBD protects against many of the harms associated with THC; what is not 
known is the relative dose of CBD that is required to offset the negative effects of a given 
dose of THC. Experimental studies to date have been unable to establish this. Some have 
relied on the presence/absence of CBD in hair samples of participants 66,67. Others have 
given CBD orally while administering inhaled or intravenous THC 23,70. Cannabinoids are 
absorbed very differently orally as opposed to inhaled/intravenous (and result in differential 
metabolite profiles) and hence this does not allow an extrapolation of relative CBD:THC 
ratio 86. Future experimental studies should therefore explore various CBD:THC ratios, 
 administered using the same route of administration, and using standardised measures of 
cognitive performance, psychopathology and liability for addiction. Once a “safer” CBD:THC 
ratio has been found, this may potentially be used as a harm-reduction strategy,  where 
users (some also with a psychotic illness) experiencing negative effects from use of ‘skunk’-
type cannabis can be encouraged to switch to the less harmful one. Encouragingly, studies 
to date have not found CBD to influence the rewarding or pleasurable effects of THC 23–25. 
This is crucial as any attempt to reduce the harms of cannabis would likely be ineffective if it 
also reduced the rewarding effects of cannabis.  
Conclusion 
In a rapidly changing political climate surrounding cannabis, the demand for effectively 
reducing cannabis related harms has never been greater, and more research (both 
experimental and observational) is urgently needed to inform policy decisions. Reducing the 
THC content of cannabis, smoke-free alternatives (vaporisers), and concurrent use of 
tobacco, may be effective harm reduction measures. However, increasing the content CBD 
may be especially promising as it can offset several harms of cannabis without 
compromising its rewarding effects.
