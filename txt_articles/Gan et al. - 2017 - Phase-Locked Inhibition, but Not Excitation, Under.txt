SUMMARY
Sharp wave-ripple (SWR) oscillations play a key
role in memory consolidation during non-rapid eye
movement sleep, immobility, and consummatory
behavior. However, whether temporally modulated
synaptic excitation or inhibition underlies the ripples
is controversial. To address this question, we per-
formed simultaneous recordings of excitatory and
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs)
and local field potentials (LFPs) in the CA1 region of
awake mice in vivo. During SWRs, inhibition domi-
nated over excitation, with a peak conductance ratio
of 4.1 ± 0.5. Furthermore, the amplitude of SWR-
associated IPSCs was positively correlated with
SWR magnitude, whereas that of EPSCs was not.
Finally, phase analysis indicated that IPSCs were
phase-locked to individual ripple cycles, whereas
EPSCs were uniformly distributed in phase space.
Optogenetic inhibition indicated that PV+ interneu-
rons provided a major contribution to SWR-associ-
ated IPSCs. Thus, phasic inhibition, but not excita-
tion, shapes SWR oscillations in the hippocampal
CA1 region in vivo.
INTRODUCTION
Sharp wave-ripple (SWR) oscillations in the hippocampal CA1
region play a key role in memory consolidation during non-rapid
eye movement sleep, immobility, and consummatory behavior
(Buzsa
´ ki et al., 1992; Ylinen et al., 1995; Girardeau et al., 2009;
Jadhav et al., 2012; reviewed by Buzsa
´ ki, 2015). Despite their
important network function, the underlying synaptic mecha-
nisms remain unclear. Several mechanisms of ripple generation
have been proposed, including phasic excitation from the CA3
region (Maier et al., 2011), phasic inhibition from GABAergic
interneurons (English et al., 2014), and gap junction coupling
between pyramidal neurons (Draguhn et al., 1998). Divergent
results may derive from technical limitations of the experimental
approaches
used.

recording in vivo (Ylinen et al., 1995; Stark et al., 2014) can be
applied to networks in awake, behaving animals, but does not
allow accurate dissection of dendritic excitation and perisomatic
inhibition, which will produce similar sink-source patterns. Intra-
cellular analysis allows precise analysis of synaptic potentials,
currents, and spiking, but is largely restricted to in vitro prepara-
tions (Ha
´ jos et al., 2013; Schlingloff et al., 2014), or to the analysis
of synaptic potentials in vivo with limited temporal resolution (En-
glish et al., 2014; Hulse et al., 2016). Understanding the synaptic
mechanisms of SWR generation requires recording of synaptic
currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo in awake animals un-
der voltage-clamp conditions, where excitation and inhibition
can be precisely dissected (Borg-Graham et al., 1998).
RESULTS
To probe the synaptic mechanisms of SWR oscillations, we per-
formed simultaneous recordings of excitatory and inhibitory syn-
aptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) and LFPs in the CA1 region of
awake mice in vivo (Figure 1). Animals were head-fixed, but fully
awake, showing behaviors of grooming, whisking, and moving.
We first tested whether functional characteristics of SWRs
measured near the pyramidal cell layer under our experimental
conditions were identical to those in awake, freely moving ani-
mals (Ylinen et al., 1995; Figures 1A–1C). On average, SWRs
occurred with a mean frequency of 0.15 ± 0.02 Hz (694
events in 17 mice) and had a mean duration of 69.4 ± 4.3 ms.
Individual ripple cycles were generated at a mean frequency of
154.0 ± 1.6 Hz, and the average number of ripples per sharp
wave was 10.8 ± 0.7. These properties of SWRs were very similar
to those reported previously in awake, behaving rodents (Ylinen
et al., 1995; reviewed by Buzsa
´ ki, 2015).
Next, we investigated the postsynaptic currents during SWR
oscillations in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the voltage-clamp
configuration (Figures 1D–1F). To obtain adequate resolution,
several efforts were made to optimize voltage-clamp conditions
and to rigorously assess possible errors. First, we minimized se-
ries resistance (Rs), which on average was 17 ± 1 MU in our

 dataset (range, 10–27 MU; Margrie et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2006,
2009). Additionally, we used a cesium-based internal solution to
enhance steady-state voltage control in distal dendrites (Wil-
liams and Mitchell, 2008). Second, we performed experimental
tests for adequate voltage-clamp conditions. Measured sponta-
neous synaptic events showed a fast time course (Figure S1,
available online), and extrapolation toward the limit of small Rs
revealed even faster synaptic kinetics (Figure S2). Kinetic param-
eters and amplitude were only weakly correlated. Both results
were consistent with adequate clamp conditions (Hestrin et al.,
1990; Figure S2). Finally, we examined the extent of voltage-
clamp errors for EPSCs and IPSCs in detailed cable models
based on full reconstruction of in vivo-recorded CA1 pyramidal
neurons (Major et al., 1994; Figures S3–S5). For proximal synap-
ses, errors in peak amplitude, rise time, and decay time constant
of somatically recorded EPSCs and IPSCs due to cable filtering
were less than a factor of two (Figure S3), and corresponding
postsynaptic voltage errors were <10 mV (Figure S4). Distributed
pipette capacitance did not introduce additional errors (Fig-
ure S5). In conclusion, voltage-clamp errors were unavoidable,
but appeared to be within an acceptable range under our exper-
imental conditions.
Finally, we dissected EPSCs and IPSCs during SWRs by alter-
natingly setting the holding potential to either �70 mV (i.e., near
the reversal potential of GABAA receptors; Figure S6) or +10 mV
(i.e., near the reversal potential of AMPA- and NMDA-type gluta-
mate receptors; Borg-Graham et al., 1998). Simultaneous
recording of either EPSCs or IPSCs and the LFP revealed that
the frequency of both excitatory and inhibitory events increased
during SWRs (Figures 1D–1F). However, the generation of IPSCs
(Figure 1E) appeared to be more tightly correlated to the SWRs
than the generation of EPSCs (Figure 1D).

 To quantitatively analyze the contribution of excitation and in-
hibition to the generation of ripples, we performed SWR-trig-
gered averaging of EPSCs and IPSCs (Figure 2). Synaptic cur-
rents were aligned to the maximal positive ripple deflection in
the band pass-filtered LFP, averaged, and converted into synap-
tic conductances using the values of the driving force. SWR-
triggered averaging revealed that the peak amplitude of the
inhibitory conductance was markedly larger than that of the
excitatory conductance (Figure 2A). On average, the SWR-asso-
ciated peak conductance was 1.8 ± 0.4 nS for excitation and
6.0 ± 0.8 nS for inhibition (17 cells; p < 0.0001; Figures 2A and
2B), corresponding to an inhibition-to-excitation conductance
ratio of 4.1 ± 0.5. In comparison to excitation, inhibition showed
a faster rise (20%–80% rise time, 64.7 ± 5.9 ms for excitation and
42.5 ± 4.8 ms for inhibition; p = 0.0021; Figures 2A and 2B), but a
slower decay (decay time constant, 47.6 ± 4.6 ms for excitation
and 98.3 ± 12.1 ms for inhibition; p < 0.0001; Figures 2A and 2B).
Furthermore, inhibition peaked at a slightly later time (time differ-
ence, 7.3 ± 1.9 ms; p = 0.0005). Thus, synaptic inhibition, rather
than excitation (Maier et al., 2011), dominated during the gener-
ation of SWRs. Furthermore, excitation and inhibition showed
different temporal profiles.
Previous studies revealed that the amplitude of SWRs varies
from event to event by over an order of magnitude (Csicsvari
et al., 2000). If either excitation or inhibition was responsible for
ripple generation, we would expect that the relevant conduc-
tance would positively correlate with the ripple amplitude. To
test this hypothesis, we plotted the peak amplitude of excitatory
and inhibitory conductance in CA1 pyramidal neurons during in-
dividual SWRs against ripple amplitude (Figures 2C and 2D). For
the excitatory conductance, peak conductance and ripple ampli-
tude were not significantly correlated (linear correlation analysis,

EPSG peak amplitude and SWR peak amplitude (C) and the highly significant positive correlation between IPSG peak amplitude and SWR peak amplitude (D).

 Pearson’s r = �0.08; 238 events; p = 0.24; Figure 2C). In contrast,
for the inhibitory conductance, peak conductance and ripple
amplitude exhibited a strong positive correlation (Pearson’s r =
0.40; 185 events; p < 0.0001; Figure 2D). Thus, the magnitude
of inhibition, but not that of excitation, was correlated with the
amplitude of individual SWRs. Furthermore, excitation and inhi-
bition were not strictly balanced during SWRs (Hulse et al., 2016).
To determine whether EPSCs and IPSCs were phase-locked
to individual ripple cycles, we performed interleaved phase anal-
ysis for both EPSCs and IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig-
ure 3). EPSC onset times were detected as minima of the first de-
rivative of the membrane current at –70 mV, whereas IPSC onset
times were determined as maxima of the first derivative
at +10 mV (see Experimental Procedures; 3,566 and 3,180
events total for 25% largest derivative extrema; 17 cells; Figures
3A and 3B). Simulations using cable models based on cell recon-
structions
suggested that adequate
event
detection was
achieved under these conditions (Figure S7). After computing
the Hilbert transform of the band pass-filtered simultaneously re-
corded LFP signal (100–250 Hz; English et al., 2014), the onset
times of EPSCs and IPSCs were individually assigned corre-
sponding phase values, with 0� corresponding to the peak of a
ripple. Whereas EPSCs were uniformly distributed (p = 0.90 for
10% largest derivative extrema; Rayleigh test; Figure 3C, left),
IPSCs were significantly clustered in the late ascending phase
of ripple cycles (p = 0.0007 for 10% largest derivative extrema;
Rayleigh test; mean phase angle, �62.9� ± 49.6�, equivalent to
297.1�; Figure 3C, right). This conclusion was corroborated by
reverse analysis using EPSC- or IPSC-triggered averaging of
the LFP (Figure 3D). Synaptic event-triggered LFP averages

 were weakly rhythmically modulated for EPSC onsets (Figure 3D,
left), but strongly modulated for IPSC onsets (Figure 3D, right).
The peak-to-trough amplitude of the triggered LFP average
was significantly larger for IPSCs than for EPSCs (p < 0.0001
and 0.0038). Thus, phasic inhibition, but not excitation, was
phase-locked to individual cycles of ripple oscillations.
As PV+ interneurons strongly fire during SWRs (Lapray et al.,
2012; Varga et al., 2012; see Ha
´ jos et al., 2013; Schlingloff
et al., 2014), they are possible candidates for the generation of
the SWR-associated inhibitory conductance. To test this hy-
pothesis, we examined the effects of optogenetic inhibition of
PV+ interneurons (Figure 4). The inhibitory opsin Archaerhodop-
sin T (ArchT) was selectively expressed in PV+ interneurons in the
CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 4A). Five-second laser
pulses were alternated with 11 s off periods, and properties of
SWRs and associated inhibitory postsynaptic conductance

 were compared between on and off periods (Figure 4B). Optoge-
netic inhibition of PV+ interneurons did not change the inci-
dence of SWRs, but significantly reduced SWR duration (from
89.3 ± 8.5 ms to 81.0 ± 8.1 ms; 8 mice; p = 0.008; Figure 4B, right
top). Furthermore, light pulses did not change the ripple fre-
quency, but decreased the number of ripple cycles per SWR
(from 12.1 ± 1.0 to 10.9 ± 1.0; p = 0.008; Figure 4B, right center).
Finally, optogenetic inhibition of PV+ interneurons markedly
reduced the peak amplitude of the SWR-associated inhib-
itory conductance (from 9.5 ± 1.9 nS to 5.6 ± 1.2 nS; 7 cells;
p = 0.016) and reduced its half-duration (Figure 4B, right bottom).
In conclusion, PV+ interneurons make a major contribution to
the inhibitory conductance during SWRs. Furthermore, they con-
trol the duration of SWRs and the number of ripples in SWR
complexes.
If PV+ interneurons are primarily responsible for SWR genera-
tion, optogenetic inhibition of these interneurons might result in a
disruption of phase locking of IPSCs. To test this hypothesis, we
performed phase analysis and IPSC-triggered LFP averaging
before and after optogenetic inhibition after adeno-associated
virus-mediated expression of ArchT (Figures 4C and 4D). In the
absence of light, IPSCs were phase-locked to the ascending
phase of the ripple cycle (Figure 4C, left), similar to the results
in uninfected control animals (Figure 3C, right). In contrast, in
the presence of light, the phase preference was perturbed (Fig-
ure 4C, right). Furthermore, the peak-to-trough amplitude of
IPSC-triggered LFP averages was markedly reduced (Figure 4D).
Thus, PV+ interneurons provide a major contribution to phase-
locked IPSCs during individual ripple cycles.
DISCUSSION
The present paper provides a quantitative analysis of postsyn-
aptic conductances during SWRs in hippocampal CA1 pyrami-
dal neurons in awake, behaving mice in vivo. Our results indicate
that during SWRs, (1) inhibition dominates over excitation; (2)
phasic inhibition, but not excitation, is positively correlated
with SWR amplitude; (3) phasic inhibition, but not excitation, is
phase-locked to individual ripple cycles; and (4) PV+ interneu-
rons provide a major contribution to the SWR-associated inhib-
itory conductance. Our findings directly reveal the current
generator underlying SWRs. This was possible because our ex-
periments provided information about both phase and location
of the underlying conductance. The onset of the inhibitory
conductance occurred at a phase of ��60�, corresponding to
the ascending phase of a ripple. Furthermore, the conductance
was likely to be perisomatic because it was mediated, to a large
extent, by PV+ interneurons (Hu et al., 2014). Thus, the inhibitory
conductance represents a perisomatic current source, resulting
in a positive deflection in the LFP near the pyramidal cell layer.
Furthermore, our results shed light on the function of the
rhythm generator. They suggest a model in which SWRs are
generated by a combination of tonic excitation from CA3 and
phasic inhibition within CA1. In contrast, our results are inconsis-
tent with models in which phasic excitation is relayed from CA3
(Maier et al., 2011; see Nakashiba et al., 2009; Middleton and
McHugh, 2016). Furthermore, they are incompatible with a major
contribution of gap junctions (Draguhn et al., 1998). Whether
ripple generation involves feedback inhibition, mutual inhibition,
or both remains to be determined (Stark et al., 2014). The tempo-
ral sequence of events, with action potentials in CA1 pyramidal
neurons at the ripple trough (Csicsvari et al., 1999), PV+ inter-
neuron firing in the early ascending phase (Lapray et al., 2012;
Varga et al., 2012), and onset of inhibitory conductance in the
late ascending phase of the ripples (this paper), would be consis-
tent with a feedback mechanism (Stark et al., 2014). On the other
hand, one might expect that GABAergic interneurons receive
tonic excitation during SWRs, similar to that in CA1 pyramidal
neurons. This could activate mutual inhibition circuits, indepen-
dent of feedback innervation.
Finally, our findings have implications for temporal coding of
information in the hippocampal CA1 region. Importantly, they
explain why CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo fire at the ripple
trough (Csicsvari et al., 1999). In a ripple model based on phasic
inhibition, the descending phase of the ripple coincides with the
decay of the inhibitory conductance. Pyramidal cells will fire at a
point where inhibition has become minimal, which is near the
trough in the LFP. In this scenario, fast decay of the inhibitory
conductance in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo (Figure S1) will
ensure temporally precise action potential generation in these
neurons (Carter and Regehr, 2002). Precise spike timing, in
turn, may be critically important for the preplay or replay of tem-
poral activity sequences in cell assemblies (Skaggs and
McNaughton, 1996) and for the consolidation of memory via
spike timing-dependent plasticity in downstream neocortical
target cells.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
In vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons and
simultaneous LFP recordings were performed in head-fixed, fully awake
mice. All experiments were carried out in strict accordance with institutional,
national, and European guidelines for animal experimentation. Protocols
were approved by the Bundesministerium f€
ur Wissenschaft und Forschung
of Austria (BMWF-66.018/0008-II/3b/2010, BMWFW-66.018/0007-WF/II/3b/
2014). PV+ interneurons were optogenetically manipulated using adeno-asso-
ciated virus. EPSCs and IPSCs were detected using template- or derivative-
based detection methods. Simulations were performed on detailed cable
models of biocytin-filled CA1 pyramidal neurons. For details, see Supple-
mental Information.
