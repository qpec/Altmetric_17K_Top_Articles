Objective To assess whether the multitherapy antenatal 
education ‘CTLB’ (Complementary Therapies for Labour 
and Birth) Study programme leads to net cost savings.
Design Cost analysis of the CTLB Study, using analysis of 
outcomes and hospital funding data.
Methods We take a payer perspective and use Australian 
Refined Diagnosis-Related Group (AR-DRG) cost data to 
estimate the potential savings per woman to the payer 
(government or private insurer). We consider scenarios in 
which the intervention cost is either borne by the woman 
or by the payer. Savings are computed as the difference in 
total cost between the control group and the study group.
results If the cost of the intervention is not borne by the 
payer, the average saving to the payer was calculated 
to be $A808 per woman. If the payer covers the cost of 
the programme, this figure reduces to $A659 since the 
average cost of delivering the programme was $A149 
per woman. All these findings are significant at the 95% 
confidence level. Significantly more women in the study 
group experienced a normal vaginal birth, and significantly 
fewer women in the study group experienced a caesarean 
section. The main cost saving resulted from the reduced 
rate of caesarean section in the study group.
Conclusion The CTLB antenatal education programme 
leads to significant savings to payers that come from 
reduced use of hospital resources. Depending on which 
perspective is considered, and who is responsible for 
covering the cost of the programme, the net savings vary 
from $A659 to $A808 per woman. Compared with the 
average cost of birth in the control group, we conclude that 
the programme could lead to a reduction in birth-related 
healthcare costs of approximately 9%.

IntrODuCtIOn  
There has been a rise in rates of intervention 
during labour and birth in most countries,1 2 
and intervention rates in Australia are well 
above the Organisation for Economic Coop-
eration and Development averages.3 Epidural 
rates in New South Wales hospitals have 
shown a rise over the past decade. In 2012, 
the state average for epidural block (EDB) 
use was 46.5%, with broad variation within the 
state, ranging from 15% to 82.7% depending 
on region and hospital.4 5 The high use of 
EDB for pain relief in labour has been iden-
tified as a contributing factor in rising rates 
of augmentation, assisted vaginal births and 
caesarean section (CS).6–10 
Childbirth education has also seen a shift 
away from birth preparation11 12 to a curric-
ulum broadly centred on overall parent 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This study is the first to demonstrate the cost 
savings that could accrue to payers from an 
effective antenatal education programme to reduce 
intervention rates in labour and birth.
 
► From the perspective of health economics, the use 
of Australian refined diagnosis-related group (AR-
DRG) codes, or similar international code, provides 
a relatively simple way to conduct cost analyses for 
particular interventions, enabling informed choices 
about the added value of a proposed intervention.
 
► The study examines the financial impact of reducing 
caesarean section (CS) for first-time mothers, and 
is timely given the global emphasis on reducing 
CS rates and the budgetary constraints faced by 
maternity providers in many settings.
 
► Limitations of this study include that the analysis is 
likely to be an underestimate of the actual amount 
of medical resources saved, as the current AR-DRG 
system does not capture the additional costs of 
procedures such as the provision of analgaesia and 
anaesthesia, which were significantly less prevalent 
in the study group.
 
► AR-DRG are limited, especially in the area of 
obstetrics, where we were unable to use the codes 
to quantify the cost savings related to the reduced 
rate of epidural block (primary outcome measure of 
the randomised controlled trial), and other common 
labour interventions, as they are all collapsed under 
the ‘normal vaginal birth’ code. The one-off costs 
of setting up were also not able to be included, and 
should be considered prior to implementation.

education.13 Findings from a systematic review on child-
birth education indicated that antenatal education for 
childbirth or parenthood has a role in increasing feelings 
of self-confidence and agency, but they demonstrated 
little impact on reducing interventions and associated 
morbidity in labour.14 15 Additionally, the Cochrane 
Systematic Reviews of individual complementary thera-
pies have shown little impact on the use of epidural anal-
gaesia and birth outcomes.16–19 This is with the exception 
of acupuncture which showed a reduction in overall 
pharmacological pain relief, and specifically epidural 
analgesia in two clinical trials,20 21 when compared with 
placebo control or standard care, and a reduction in 
instrumental vaginal birth when compared with standard 
care.19
Australian data suggest that complementary medi-
cine (CM) use is popular,22–24 and that 74.4% of women 
used some form of CM during pregnancy and 66.7% of 
these women also used non-pharmacological pain relief 
in labour.25 Building on this information, the Comple-
mentary Therapies for Labour and Birth (CTLB) Study 
was set up as an of an antenatal education programme of 
complementary therapies plus usual care, compared with 
usual care alone, for nulliparous women.26 We included 
several different therapies that had some evidence of 
effect for pain relief,17 27–30 giving women, and their birth 
partners, the opportunity to choose from a variety of 
options during the course of their labour, as every woman 
and labour is different and the requirements throughout 
labour are changeable. Some therapies fitted more natu-
rally with different women’s attitudes, beliefs and phys-
ical characteristics. The study demonstrated a significant 
decrease in the use of epidural analgaesia and in other 
interventions during labour and birth for women in the 
study group compared with the control group. The study 
showed no particular statistical association of any one 
therapy with the outcome of epidural analgaesia, and 
women used an average of three to four different thera-
pies throughout their labour. It was hypothesised that the 
effect was produced from an overall synergistic effect of 
the programme and the provision of choice and educa-
tion for women and partners.
Previous research has shown the increased costs 
associated with different modes of birth,31–33 and the 
cascade of interventions associated with epidural use 
has been costed according to birth outcomes.34 Addi-
tionally, research using cost-effectiveness analysis has 
demonstrated equivalence of costs using interna-
tional cost data for grouped outcomes associated with 
expectant management compared with immediate birth 
for the PPROMT Trial (Preterm Premature Rupture of 
Membranes close to Term).35 However, there is as yet 
no standard method of assessing the cost-effectiveness 
of a multitherapy programme that potentially affects 
multiple linked outcomes, as was the case in the CTLB 
study.
MethODs
The CTLB Study was a multicentre randomised controlled 
trial (RCT), where nulliparous women with a singleton, 
low-risk pregnancy between 24+0 and 34+6 weeks’ gesta-
tion were randomly allocated to receive a 2-day antenatal 
education course plus usual care, or to usual care alone. 
Those allocated to receive the CTLB antenatal education 
course participated in a weekend workshop that focused 
on complementary therapy techniques for non-pharma-
cological pain relief methods for labour and birth and 
education about the physiology of normal labour and 
birth. Women were recruited to the trial via three sites 
at two hospitals in Sydney, Australia. The methods of the 
CTLB study, and the clinical and qualitative outcomes 
have been described in detail previously in Levett et al.26 36 
The primary outcome for the original RCT was epidural 
use for pain relief. Secondary outcomes included mode 
of birth, onset of labour, interventions during labour, 
pharmacological analgaesia use, any complications 
during labour or birth for the mother, any complications 
for the baby and admission to any special care units. In 
this paper, we focus on the analysis of costs, comparing 
costs in the study group with costs in the control group.
For the cost analysis, in each arm of the study the 
participants were assigned a single outcome for labour 
and birth, which was based on the highest level of inter-
vention received during labour and birth. Each outcome 
was categorised according to the Australian Refined 
Diagnosis-Related Group (AR-DRG) codes, which groups 
together hospital admissions of the same clinical type 
that use similar amounts of hospital resources. This 
categorisation is a crucial step since hospitals are reim-
bursed the same amount for all admissions in the same 
AR-DRG group, although some small adjustments are 
usually made. Therefore, we costed each admission in 
the study by the average cost of admission in the corre-
sponding AR-DRG. Each year, the Australian government 
publishes data regarding the average cost of admission for 
each AR-DRG. For this paper, we used the latest release, 
‘Round 18’, for the financial year 2013–2014.37
This costing method was chosen because it correctly 
represents the medical cost incurred by the payer and 
because it could be used to make cost predictions to 
other comparable international systems with DRG-based 
payments. The rationale for this perspective is presented 
in the next section, together with a more detailed descrip-
tion of how the cost analysis was performed.
There are six relevant, mutually exclusive, AR-DRG 
categories that can be used to label the mother in-hos-
pital stay for this study: O60C, O60B, O60A, O01C, 
O01B and O01A (table 1). However, none of the admis-
sions in the study belonged to O01A or O60A, which 
denote births with catastrophic complications and major 
morbidity, which are extremely rare, such as embolism 
and severe complications of pre-eclampsia , such as 
Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet 
count (HELLP) syndrome. While the algorithm to clas-
sify each birth in one of those codes is complex, generally

speaking the codes O60C (O01C) and O60B (O01B) 
refer to vaginal (or caesarean) births without complica-
tions and with non-catastrophic complications, respec-
tively. In cases of neonatal complications, where the 
neonate may need additional care, such as an admission 
to special care nursery or the neonatal intensive care unit, 
there are also AR-DRGs associated. For the births in this 
study, we only had information stating yes or no to any 
admission. Therefore, we applied only one AR-DRG of 
this category corresponding to the least complicated cate-
gory of babies requiring observation for less than 4 hours, 
P68D. A more detailed clinical description of meaning 
of the four AR-DRGs for the mother’s stay and the P68D 
AR-DRG is presented in table 1 together with the corre-
sponding average cost of admission. To summarise, each 
birth is associated with only one of the AR-DRGs from the 
‘O’ category corresponding to the highest level of inter-
vention experienced during the birth, and may or may 
not be associated with the P68D AR-DRG.
Cost analysis
The key element of any cost analysis is the specification of 
which costs are included and for whom they accrue. The 
combination of these characteristics of the study defines 
the economic perspective taken. For example, if we were 
to take the payer perspective, we would only include 
the actual cost to payer (in this case the DRG payment) 
and possibly the cost of the programme, depending on 
whether we think this cost will be covered by the payer 
or the individuals. If we took the provider perspective, 
we would include as cost the actual amount of resources 
used by the hospital, minus the payment received by the 
payer, and again possibly the cost of the programme. 
The broadest perspective is the societal one in which it 
is irrelevant whom the costs accrue to and all healthcare 
costs are included, as well as non-healthcare costs (such as 
transportation or lost productivity) and intangible costs 
(such as pain and suffering). These three perspectives 
have been summarised in table 2.
Since this study intends to inform health policy, it would 
be ideal to adopt a societal perspective. The largest cost 
component in this perspective is the medical resource use. 
We were not able to directly measure the resource use for 
each birth since that would have required a much closer 
collaboration with the hospital financial department 
and a degree of complexity that was simply not possible 
within the limited funding and scope of this pilot project. 
This limitation could be partially overcome by noticing 
that we only need to compare the average resource use 
in the intervention and control arms, and therefore the 
DRG costing method we have adopted, which is based on 
average costs, should provide a sufficiently close approxi-
mation of the actual resource use.
The next key cost to include in the societal perspective 
is the programme cost, and this poses no problem since 
it has been measured, as discussed in the section below.

However, as shown in table 2, in order to take a societal 
perspective, we would have also to include a number of 
costs that we have not been able to measure. For example, 
we would need to know how much the participants (and 
a birth partner, if they attended) spent in transporta-
tion, whether participation in the programme took time 
away from productive or leisure time, and whether addi-
tional costs were incurred in order to participate to the 
programme (eg, baby sitter, substitute caretaker). Given 
the ‘pilot’ nature of this study, the collection of these 
variables was simply out of scope. Therefore, we can only 
provide an approximated version of the societal perspec-
tive that only includes an approximation of the hospital 
resource use and the cost of the intervention, while it 
misses some of the costs incurred while participating in 
the programme.
However, if we adopt the payer perspective, we then 
have good estimates of the costs involved. In fact, the 
DRG-based approach correctly captures the payments of 
payers to hospitals, and we can consider two scenarios: 
one in which the cost of the programme is shouldered by 
the participants, and therefore not included in the anal-
ysis, and one in which it is included because it accrues to 
the payer. Therefore, the following analysis is set in the 
payer perspective. The savings in the payer perspective 
are most likely to provide an upper bound for those in 
the societal perspective since their calculation does not 
include additional costs associated with the interven-
tion, such as transportation or lost productivity. In the 
following sections, we describe in details the calculations 
of the medical and intervention components of the costs.
Medical cost
We make the key assumption that the cost of an admis-
sion to the payer is well represented by the published 
average AR-DRG cost (see table 1). There may be correc-
tions applied to the published figures that account for 
special circumstances, such as very long stays, but they 
tend to be rare and unlikely to play an important role in 
this analysis. All the births in the study can be assigned 
one of eight possible combinations of AR-DRGs (four ‘O’ 
AR-DRGs and possibly the P68D AR-DRG), and for the 
purposes of this paper, we refer to each of the combina-
tions as an AR-DRG class. The medical cost of an admis-
sion in an AR-DRG class is simply the sum of the average 
cost of the ‘O’ AR-DRG and the average cost of the P68D 
AR-DRG, if present, as shown in table 3. The medical cost 
per birth, in each arm, is the total medical cost divided by 
the total number of women in that arm. The total medical 
cost is equal to the sum of the medical costs over all the 
AR-DRG classes, which are computed by multiplying the 
number of women in each class by the average cost of 
birth for that class. The medical cost per woman is then 
obtained dividing total cost by number of women in the 
corresponding arm. In formulas:
 
Ctreat
medical =

Ntreat

In this formula, α runs over the eight AR-DRG classes, 
ntreat
α
 is the number of women in the treatment arm in 
each AR-DRG class α, Cα is the average cost of admission 
in AR-DRG α (shown in table 3) and Ntreat is the total 
number of women in the treatment arm. Similar defini-
tions hold for the control arm.
Programme cost
The programme is delivered by an educator to groups of 
six to eight participants, with each bringing at least one 
person to be a birth partner (referred to as the ‘couple’), 
and it takes place over the course of 2 days of 7.5 hours 
each. Using an average number of participants equal 
to seven couples and a labour cost of $A35 per hour 
for the educator, the labour cost per couple is equal to 
$A35×7.5×2/7 = $A75. If one uses a more experienced 
educator, at an hourly rate of $A70 rather than $A35, the 
labour cost would rise to $A150. For the purposes of this 
paper, we simply take the average of these two numbers, 
$A112, and use $A75 and $A150 as lower and upper 
bounds in the sensitivity analysis. If the programme were 
administered to more (less) people, these costs would be 
lower (higher). However, the programme was designed to 
work for this group size, and it does not necessarily scale 
to a larger and smaller group. Therefore, we have not 
performed sensitivity analysis on the number of women 
attending a session.
The intervention also includes a small component 
of capital cost. In fact, each couple also receives a DVD 
($A12), a booklet ($A2) and is provided with light refresh-
ments ($A15 over 2 days). We acknowledge that one may 
want to offer a more generous refreshment, valued at 
double that amount. Therefore, we estimate the refresh-
ment cost by taking the rounded average between the two 
numbers, that is, $A23, with a lower bound of $A15 and 
an upper bound of $A30 for the purpose of the sensitivity 
analysis. This leads us to estimate the capital cost at $A12 
+ $A2 + $A23 = $A37, with lower and upper bounds of 
$A29 and $A44, respectively.
We make the assumption that the programme is deliv-
ered in the hospital, and that the hospital always has 
spare capacity of one room for six to eight couples and 
an educator, and therefore do not include the cost of

securing the space. This is an important assumption that 
takes advantage of the fact that the RCT was performed 
in a setting where the cost of space was ‘sunk’ (unless 
we want to include costs such as lighting/electricity that 
would be minimal). However, cost of space would be 
substantial if the programme were to be administered in 
a private setting, where a room had to be rented, or if the 
programme were scaled at a level that the hospital stops 
having spare capacity.
Therefore, the cost of the intervention in the setting of 
the current study was approximately $A112+$A37=$A149 
per woman, with a lower bound of $A104 and upper 
bound of $A194. A summary of the programme costs is 
shown in table 4.
Who bears this cost and whether it should be included 
in the analysis depends on how one envisions this 
programme implemented and paid for. A possible 
scenario is one in which the cost of the programme is 
borne by the women participating, who would be paying 
for it out-of-pocket. Alternatively, depending on insur-
ance arrangements, the payer might also be bearing the 
cost. In order to help readers find the scenarios they are 
most interested in, we will report the results as follows:
 
► We will report results in which the programme cost is 
met by the women;
 
► We will report the results in which there is no 
programme cost.
net savings
The net savings to payers per woman delivered by the 
intervention are simply the difference between the 
medical cost in the control arm and the sum of medical 
plus programme cost in the treatment arm.
 
S = Ccontrol
medical − Ctreat
medical − Cinter 
Our hypothesis for this study is that S is positive and 
statistically different from 0. We also consider the savings 
that would accrue to payers if the cost of the programme 
were borne by the woman. In this case, we do not include 
the cost of the intervention in the formula above and 
limit the analysis to the medical savings.
statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed in R (V.3.3.2) and 
focused on the net savings variable S. We account for 
two sources of variation in the measurement of S: the 
stochastic nature of birth outcomes, which drives varia-
tion in the hospital cost term Ccontrol
medical − Ctreat
medical, and 
the uncertainty in the cost of the intervention.
In order to model variation in medical costs, we used 
the plain bootstrap method38 (R package ‘boot’) applied 
to the difference in medical costs between the study and 
control group, drawing a number of bootstrap samples 
equal to 500 000. Performing ‘smooth’ bootstrap, that is, 
adding a small amount of random noise to the data, did 
not lead to significant changes in the results. In order to 
model uncertainty in programme cost, we drew 500 000 
samples from the uniform distribution for the labour 
and capital components of the programme costs, using 
the lower and upper bounds described above. As a result, 
we obtained 500 000 possible realisations of net savings 
that reflect both uncertainty in birth outcomes and in 
programme costs. The distribution of these 500 000 
figures is used in the next section to estimate the average 
net savings and the related CI. As a sensitivity test, we 
also performed a more traditional analysis using t-tests 
and reached the same conclusions of the bootstrap simu-
lation method. The advantage of the bootstrap is that it 
allows visualisation of the distribution of the results and 
provides additional insights, such as the probability of 
experiencing any positive saving.
results
There are eight possible outcomes for the births in 
the study, corresponding to the four AR-DRGs for the 
mother, which may or may not be associated with a 
neonatal AR-DRG. Before showing the results for all 
eight outcomes, we show in table 5 an aggregate view 
that makes it clear why the study group had smaller costs 
than the control group. We divide all births according to 
whether a CS was performed or not. This corresponds to

using the first three letters/digits of the AR-DRG for the 
mother’s admission: O60 (no CS) or O01 (CS).
The key difference between the study and the control 
group is that the study group had a much lower rate of 
CS (18.2%) than in the control group (32.5%) (table 5). 
Since CS births in this study cost approximately $A4200 
more than births without CS, it follows that the average 
cost of birth in the study group was $A808 less than in 
the control group, with a 95% CI of $A163 to $A1457. 
Therefore, if the cost of the intervention is borne by the 
woman, the payer saves an expected amount equal to 
$A808 per woman.
If the payer covers the programme cost of $A149 per 
woman, then the savings to the payer reduce to $A659 per 
woman, with a CI of $A12 to $A1311.
Figure 1 shows the simulated distributions of the 
savings and costs per birth, with the red vertical lines 
showing the CI at 95% and the blue lines showing the 
CI at 90%. The left side shows the net savings including 
the programme cost, while the right side only shows the 
medical savings.
We have reported the entire distributions of savings to 
payers because they provide information that goes beyond 
the usual mean and CI and provide a better picture of 
the financial risk borne by the payers. In the following 
section, we consider the case in which payers cover the 
programme cost, and therefore we refer to the distribu-
tion shown in the left panel of figure 1. We consider four 
simple questions and provide the corresponding answers:
Q1:What is the probability that a payer experiences positive 
savings?
A1: It is the area of the distribution to the right of 0, 
which is equal to 97.7%.
Q2:Conditional on the payer experiencing positive savings, 
what is the expected value of those savings?
A2: It is $A677, computed as the expected value of the 
distribution truncated to the right of 0.
Q3:What is the probability that a payer experiences a loss 
(negative savings)?
A3: It is the area of the distribution to the left of 0, 
which is equal to 2.3%.
Q4: Conditional on the payer experiencing a loss, what is the 
expected value of the loss?
A4: It is $A122, computed as the expected value of the 
distribution truncated to the left of 0.
We can summarise these findings by saying that payers 
have a high probability (97.7%) of experiencing posi-
tive savings (averaging at $A677) and a small probability 
(2.3%) of experiencing a loss (averaging at $A122). We 
will come back to these figures in the context of sensitivity 
analysis.
The full distribution of outcomes and costs across all 
the eight possible outcomes is shown in table 6. A graph-
ical representation is provided in figure 2, which shows 
the proportion of births, for study and control group, in 
the eight cost categories.
In figure 2, the cost categories are sorted in increasing 
order from left to right. The figure shows that the effect 
of the intervention was to shift some births from the more 
expensive categories to the less costly ones since there is a 
predominance of births in the intervention group (in blue) 
on the left side of the figure (the less costly outcomes).

locations may imply different programme costs than the 
ones reported here. If additional programme costs are 
incurred, payers may have less of an incentive to adopt 
the programme, and therefore it seems important to 
explore the implications of higher-than-anticipated 
programme costs. An increase in programme costs of 
ΔC dollars per woman reduces the expected savings 
per woman by ΔC and alters the distribution of savings, 
decreasing the probability of any positive savings and 
increasing the probability of experiencing a loss. In 
the previous section, we reported information about 
the financial risk faced by payers by answering four 
questions. Here, we study how the answers to ques-
tions 1 to 4 are affected by an increase in programme 
costs. The results are shown in table 7 below.
The first line of the table simply reports the base-
line case of the previous section. The following lines 
show scenarios of increasing programme costs. The 
additional costs were chosen in such a way that the 
probability of experiencing positive savings decreases 
smoothly from 97.7% to 90%. The table shows that 
if actual programme costs are $A115 more than the 
anticipated $A149 (a 77% increase), there is still a very 
high probability (95%) of experiencing large positive 
savings ($A580). Even if additional programme costs 
were as high as $A185 (a 124% increase), the proba-
bility of observing positive savings is still 92.5%, and 
the savings are still over $A500.
Interestingly, as the programme costs grow from 0 to 
$A235 and the probability of experiencing loss grow 
from 2.3% to 10%, the expected loss, if realised, would 
only grow from $A122 to $A155. Stated differently, the 
expected loss, if experienced, is quite insensitive to 
increases in programme costs since for every additional 
dollar in programme cost, the potential loss only grows 
by 14 cents.
This analysis sheds some insights on how the results 
would look from a societal perspective. We have shown 
in an earlier section that, to the extent that DRG 
payments adequately capture the use of healthcare

resources, the societal perspective differs from the 
payer perspective because it should include addi-
tional societal costs. Table 7 above was developed to 
test additional programme costs, but it is also valid in 
the scenario in which programme costs are fixed at 
their baseline values and additional societal costs are 
included. Therefore, the table shows that if the sum 
of additional direct, indirect and intangible costs were 
somewhere between $A100 and $A200, there is still a 
high probability that society as a whole would benefit 
a non-negligible amount from the adoption of this 
programme.
DIsCussIOn
This is the first study to demonstrate the cost savings that 
could accrue to payers from an effective antenatal educa-
tion intervention using multiple therapies to reduce the 
use of routine clinical and pharmacological interven-
tions in labour. The mean medical savings per episode 
of $A808, calculated to be more than $A97 million for 
the 120 000 nulliparous births in Australia annually, are 
substantial and are likely to be an underestimate of the 
actual amount of medical resources saved. In fact, the 
current AR-DRG system does not capture the additional 
costs of procedures such as the provision of analgaesia 
and anaesthesia, which were less prevalent in the study 
group. Most of the medical savings in the model come 
from the reduction in the rate of uncomplicated CS in 
the women allocated to the antenatal programme. This 
was almost half the rate for those in the control group 
(14.7% vs 28.9%). Given the global emphasis on reducing 
CS rates39 40 and the budgetary constraints faced by mater-
nity providers in many settings, the potential benefits of 
this intervention may be significant from both a clinical 
and an economic perspective.
Implementation costs for the CTLB intervention 
are minimal as antenatal education classes are already 
offered to women (and their partners) as part of stan-
dard care in Australian hospitals that women pay for 
separately (usually between $A100 and $A300 depending 
on hospital and region). We have estimated costs of 
running the 2-day course to be $A149 per woman, based 
on an average midwife rate of $A52 per hour and a small 
capital cost that includes DVDs and light refreshments 
(the actual midwife rate will be dependent on the level 
and experience of the midwife delivering the class). This 
compares very favourably when set against the medical 
savings of $A808 per episode identified in this study.
From a health economics’ perspective, the use of 
AR-DRG codes provides a relatively simple way to 
conduct cost analyses for particular interventions. This 
would enable commissioners and healthcare managers 
to make informed choices about the added value of a 
proposed intervention. Although the AR-DRG coding 
system is unique to Australia, DRG payment systems 
are widespread around the world and the model of 
assigning codes to represent specific, defined care 
packages is widely used. For example, The Health-
care Resource Group system employed in England 
and Wales incorporates similar codes to those used 
in Australia (UK Government, 2016). This has been 
demonstrated in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the 
Self-hypnosis for intrapartum pain (SHIP) Trial, an 
antenatal education programme of 'self-hypnosis for 
intrapartum pain' management in nulliparous women, 
conducted in the UK.41 The analysis was conducted 
from the perspective of the National Health Service 
(NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSSRU), where 
resource use and unit costs were obtained from the 
NHS and PSSRU databases. These costs were applied 
as an average cost per woman derived from overall unit 
costs. Where national coding systems are analogous, it 
may be feasible to compare intercountry, cost data for 
a given intervention, such as in the cost analysis of the 
PPROMT Trial.35
AR-DRG have the limitation of being a blunt instru-
ment, especially in the area of obstetrics, and while they 
may reflect accurately the payer costs, they may not be 
as easily used to understand resource usage. In our case, 
for example, we were unable to use AR-DRG to quantify 
the cost savings related to the reduced rate of EDB. In 
fact, labour induction, labour augmentation, epidural 
analgaesia, episiotomy and minor perineal trauma are all 
included under code 060C (NVB uncomplicated), inde-
pendently of whether the associated resources were used 
or not.

Our analysis did not take into account the costs of 
setting up the programme, including training and 
insuring the staff who deliver it, or venue hire and staff 
transport. However, some of these costs are one-off, and 
therefore would become insignificant in a wider roll-out, 
while others really depend on how the programme is 
implemented and would require a careful analysis prior 
to implementation.
COnClusIOn
We have previously shown26 that the antenatal CTLB 
programme significantly reduces epidural use and CS in 
women assigned to the study group, as well as reducing a 
range of other clinical interventions that have important 
adverse consequences if overused in healthy women and 
babies. In this paper, we have shown that in addition to 
medical benefits, the CTLB programme is also associated 
with significant cost saving, largely related to a reduc-
tion in CS rates in the intervention group. This will be of 
interest to healthcare commissioners and providers.
The net savings to payers brought by the antenatal 
programme, not including programme costs, were esti-
mated at $A808 per woman. This figure drops to $A659 
when programme costs are included. Despite the rela-
tively small size of the sample, the evidence is strong: 
computing the area to the right of the number zero in 
the simulated distributions of figure 1, we estimated that 
the probability of observing any positive savings, even if 
programme costs were included, is 97.7%.
