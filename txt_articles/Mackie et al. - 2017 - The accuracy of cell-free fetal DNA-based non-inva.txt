Background Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) non-invasive prenatal
testing (NIPT) is rapidly expanding, and is being introduced at
varying rates depending on country and condition.
Objectives Determine accuracy of cffDNA-based NIPT for all
conditions. Evaluate influence of other factors on test
performance.
Search strategy Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library,
from 1997 to April 2015.
Selection criteria Cohort studies reporting cffDNA-based NIPT
performance in singleton pregnancies.
Data collection and analysis Bivariate or univariate meta-analysis
and subgroup analysis performed to explore influence of test type
and population risk.
Main results A total of 117 studies were included that analysed 18
conditions. Bivariate meta-analysis demonstrated sensitivities and
specificities, respectively, for: fetal sex, 0.989 (95% CI 0.980–
0.994) and 0.996 (95% CI 0.989–0.998), 11 179 tests; rhesus D,
0.993 (95% CI 0.982–0.997) and 0.984 (95% CI 0.964–0.993),
10 290 tests; trisomy 21, 0.994 (95% CI 0.983–0.998) and 0.999
(95% CI 0.999–1.000), 148 344 tests; trisomy 18, 0.977 (95% CI
0.952–0.989) and 0.999 (95% CI 0.998–1.000), 146 940 tests;
monosomy X, 0.929 (95% CI 0.741–0.984) and 0.999 (95% CI
0.995–0.999), 6712 tests. Trisomy 13 was analysed by univariate
meta-analysis, with a summary sensitivity of 0.906 (95% CI
0.823–0.958) and specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.999–0.100), from
134 691 tests. False and inconclusive results were poorly reported
across all conditions. Although the test type affected both
sensitivity and specificity, there was no evidence that population
risk had any effect.
Conclusion Performance of cffDNA-based NIPT is affected by
condition under investigation. For fetal sex and rhesus D status,
NIPT can be considered diagnostic. For trisomy 21, 18, and 13,
the lower sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence, combined
with the biological influence of confined placental mosaicism,
designates it a screening test. These factors must be considered
when counselling patients and assessing the cost of introduction
into routine care.
Keywords Cell-free fetal DNA, diagnostic accuracy, non-invasive
prenatal testing.
Tweetable abstract cffDNA NIPT accuracy high, can be diagnostic
for fetal sex and rhesus D, but only screening test in aneuploidy.

Introduction
Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) uses cell-free fetal
DNA (cffDNA) that is present in maternal plasma, and is
believed to originate from the trophoblast. It was first
detected by Lo et al. in 1997, and was used to indicate the
presence of the Y chromosome in order to diagnose fetal
sex.1 NIPT can now be used to test for aneuploidy, and
single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s
disease, or thanatophoric dysplasia.2–6 It has the advantage

Systematic review
 of being non-invasive, avoiding the 0.5–1.0% risk of mis-
carriage associated with amniocentesis/chorionic villus sam-
pling,7 and allows for timely therapeutic intervention in
conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).8
cffDNA is cleared from plasma (in a matter of hours) fol-
lowing delivery, thereby ensuring individuality for each
pregnancy.9 Non-invasive prenatal testing also has health
economic implications, eliminating the need to give all
women testing rhesus D-negative anti–D immunoglobulin
prophylaxis.
NIPT is being introduced into routine antenatal care
across the world at differing rates, largely influenced by
technological advances facilitated by the commercial sector.
Current guidance in North America and from the Interna-
tional Society for Prenatal Diagnosis advises a positive
NIPT for aneuploidy to be confirmed by invasive test-
ing,10–12 because of the low risk of a false-positive result
secondary to confined placental mosaicism (CPM). Incon-
clusive results occur in up to 8.1%,10 with a repeat sample
being successful in up to 80% of participants.13
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating
test accuracy have been published.14–18 These have several
limitations, however: (i) they evaluate individual conditions
(e.g. fetal sex, rhesus D status, or aneuploidy), thus not
allowing comparison; (ii) they have a high risk of bias, as
they include case–control studies; (iii) they use inferior sta-
tistical techniques for meta-analysis; and (iv) they include
studies with a significant risk of verification bias, as not all
participants undertake a reference test (e.g. karyotype). The
aim of our article was to produce the most comprehensive
systematic review and meta-analysis of NIPT, and in order
to reduce bias we only included cohort studies,19 we per-
formed
bivariate
meta-analysis
where
possible,
and
included all indications for antenatal use, so as to enable a
more uniform comparison for the use of NIPT in clinical
practice. We also aimed to assess aspects of test accuracy
that might influence how cffDNA is implemented in the
clinical pathway: e.g. the effect of technique on accuracy
and evaluation of false-positive, false-negative, and incon-
clusive results.
Methods
This review was performed according to recommended
methods, and used a protocol that was designed and regis-
tered a priori (PROSPERO CRD42014007174).20–23
Identification of studies
The Medline, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and
Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant
articles by FLM. Grey literature and reference lists were
hand-searched. The search terms used were ‘noninvasive’,
‘non-invasive’, ‘non invasive’, ‘prenatal diagnosis’, ‘cell free
fetal DNA’, and ‘cell-free fetal DNA’. The full search strat-
egy is available in Appendix S1. The date of publication
was limited from 1997 to 13 April 2015. There was no lim-
itation on language.
Study selection
Study selection was performed in duplicate (FLM and
RKM), involving screening of titles and abstracts, then
reviewing the full manuscripts of selected articles. Disagree-
ments in selection were resolved by MDK. Articles were
included based on the following criteria.
Population
Women with a singleton pregnancy, any gestation. Popula-
tions could include women of varying risk, with women
defined as being at high risk attending for testing because
of pre-existing risk factors: a personal or family history of
the condition being tested for; deemed high-risk on routine
biochemical screening; abnormal ultrasound scan; and/or
older maternal age. Women were considered to be at low
risk if they had none of the above risk factors.
Test
Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on cffDNA in
maternal blood, irrespective of condition being examined.
Reference standard
Studies must have compared all of the cffDNA results with
either karyotype results or birth outcome (either blood
sample or phenotype), as appropriate, in all participants.
Study design
Cohort studies.
Exclusion criteria
Pre-implantation testing, fetal cell testing, case–control
studies, case series with fewer than five participants.
Data extraction
Data were extracted in duplicate on the relevant 2 9 2
tables comparing the non-invasive test with the reference
test used for definitive diagnosis. Data were also extracted
on factors that may affect test accuracy: participant charac-
teristics (e.g. obstetric history) and test characteristics [e.g.
cut-offs used and test technique [e.g. polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), massive parallel sequencing (MPS), mass
spectrometry].
Information
regarding
false
results
and
inconclusive results was obtained.
When a study used similar laboratory protocols on the
same blood samples (e.g. different number of replicates
performed), only the best results were included. When a
study used different laboratory protocols on different blood
samples, but the same type of test technique, these samples
33

Cell-free fetal DNA-based NIPT in singleton pregnancies
 were grouped together for analysis. If a study subdivided
samples based on population characteristics (e.g. high risk
versus low risk for a condition, or first trimester versus sec-
ond trimester versus third trimester), these were grouped
together for the summary statistics and analysed as a sub-
group, where appropriate.
Quality assessment
The
quality
of
the
studies
was
assessed
using
the
QUADAS–2 tool.24
Data synthesis
For each study the 2 9 2 data were used to calculate sensi-
tivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals. Hetero-
geneity was explored by assessing the distribution of results
in the Forest plots and Hierarchical summary receiver
operating characteristic curves (HSROCs). Summary mea-
sures, including sensitivities, specificities, diagnostic odds
ratios, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, along
with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated using a
bivariate logistic regression model with an unstructured
correlation. This model allows for the correlation between
sensitivity and specificity from the same study, and for the
sensitivities and specificities to have different random
effects.25 Meta-analysis was performed when there were
more than five studies per condition using STATA 13 (Sta-
taCorp. 2012, College Station, Texas; for more detail, see
Appendix S2). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression was
planned a priori to assess effects of study-level covariates
on test accuracy, namely: population characteristics (level
of risk for condition where appropriate, i.e. not performed
in fetal sex or rhesus D); test technique (e.g. PCR or MPS)
and quality aspects according to QUADAS–2. We used
subgroup analyses (as opposed to meta-regression) to assess
the influence of all categorical covariates due to model con-
vergence difficulties.26
Results
The search revealed 4433 studies for inclusion. After
reviewing the full article, 117 studies1,27–143 were eligible,
reporting on 18 different conditions and 472 935 tests (Fig-
ure S1). The study characteristics are outlined in Table S1.
We were able to produce summary results using the fully
unstructured
bivariate
model
for
fetal
sex,
rhesus D,
trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and monosomy X (Table S2). For
trisomy 13, despite a sufficient number of studies (n = 15),
there was no heterogeneity in specificities across studies so
the bivariate model, which takes into account the correla-
tion between the sensitivities and specificities, failed to con-
verge, and consequently we fitted a univariate model.
Because of this, these results are less methodologically
robust. The HSROCs are presented in Figure S2, and the
results
from
our
subgroup
analyses
are
presented
in
Table S2.
In five studies (n = 394 130 tests) there was differential
verification of results, in that some participants had their
result confirmed by karyotype and others by pheno-
type.35,91,93,114,133 These five studies all assessed fetal aneu-
ploidy and used NIPT as a screening test in a low-risk
population. A sensitivity analysis removing these five stud-
ies demonstrated no significant effect on the summary
results, thus these studies are included in all analyses and
Forest plots.
The following 12 conditions had insufficient studies for
meta-analysis: rhesus C, rhesus E, 47XXX, 47XXY, 47XYY,
trisomy 16, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, deletion-dupli-
cation syndromes, sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia, human
platelet antigen 1a, and KEL 1. The Forest plots of these 12
conditions are presented in Figure S3.
Methodological quality of included studies
This was assessed according to the Quality Assessment tool
for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS–2),24 and the
results are presented in Figure S4 and further described in
Appendix S3.
False results and inconclusive results
Reporting of causes and implications of false-positive, false-
negative, and inconclusive results was poor, and varied
across all conditions (Table S3). The included studies
reported an inconclusive result rate of 0.32–5.30%. This
issue was further compounded by a myriad of varying
quality control (QC) standards, with some studies exclud-
ing samples that failed their QC, and others implementing
no QC steps and therefore reporting some results as false
negatives that other studies would have excluded from the
analysis. Some studies investigated the reasons for their
false and inconclusive results and reported these clearly,
accounting for all samples. Other studies reported incon-
clusive results as false negatives or did not report them at
all. We describe these results in more detail for each of the
conditions investigated.
Results from bivariate meta-analysis
Fetal sex
Sixty studies (11 179 tests) evaluated fetal sex and are rep-
resented in the Forest plot in Figure 1. Bivariate meta-
analysis produced a summary sensitivity of 0.989 (95% CI
0.980–0.994) and specificity of 0.996 (95% CI 0.989–0.998),
a positive likelihood ratio of 255 (95% CI 89–729) and
negative likelihood ratio of 0.011 (95% CI 0.006–0.019).
Other summary measures are presented in Table S2.
No significant effect on sensitivity was found with test
technique; however, there was a difference in specificity

Cell-free fetal DNA-based NIPT in singleton pregnancies

1.000) performing better than conventional PCR (0.939;
95% CI 0.872–0.972). For fetal sex, 11/60 studies reported
inconclusive results, and of these, five studies documented
an explanation (in order of frequency): assay failure; no
reason given; insufficient number of markers present from
pre-specified cut-off; and low fetal fraction. The most com-
mon reasons given by the authors of the studies for the
false results were: no reason given; low fetal fraction
(although cffDNA not quantified); low fetal fraction con-
firmed by authors quantifying cffDNA; possible contamina-
tion/DNA degradation/vanishing twin/test failure, although
not confirmed; and previous male pregnancy, although this
reason has since been disproven as cffDNA is cleared from
the maternal circulation in a matter of hours after deliv-
ery.9
Rhesus D
Thirty studies (10 290 tests) evaluated fetal rhesus D status
and are represented in Figure 2. Bivariate meta-analysis
produced a summary sensitivity of 0.993 (95% CI 0.982–
0.997) and specificity of 0.984 (95% CI 0.964–0.993) a
positive likelihood ratio of 61 (95% CI 22–167), and a
negative likelihood ratio of 0.007 (95% CI 0.003–0.186).
There was a significant difference between test techniques
with real-time quantitative PCR sensitivity: 0.997 (95% CI
0.987–0.999), demonstrating a higher sensitivity than con-
ventional PCR (0.924; 95% CI 0.832–0.968), although it
was not possible to assess whether there were any differ-
ences in studies that used mass spectrometry (because of
issues with convergence, despite a sufficient number of
studies, as detailed in the Discussion), and no difference
in specificity was seen (Table S2). For rhesus D, 13/30
studies reported inconclusive results. Of these, 10 studies
documented an explanation (in order of frequency): no
reason given; RHD gene variant; insufficient number of
markers present from pre-specified cut-off; test failure; or
low fetal fraction. The most common reasons given for
false results were: presumed low fetal fraction (although
not quantified by authors); no reason given; presumed
RHD gene variant (although not confirmed); confirmed
RHD gene variant; test failure; possible contamination/

Trisomy 21
Thirty-one studies (148 344 tests) assessed trisomy 21 and
are represented in Figure 3a. Bivariate meta-analysis pro-
duced a summary sensitivity of 0.994 (95% CI 0.983–0.998)
and specificity of 0.999 (95% CI 0.999–1.000), and a positive
likelihood ratio of 1720 (95% CI 1111–2662) and a negative
likelihood ratio of 0.006 (95% CI 0.002–0.017). Test tech-
nique and population risk had no significant effect. For tri-
somy 21, 14/31 studies reported inconclusive results. Of
these, seven studies documented an explanation (in order of
frequency): assay failure; confirmed low fetal fraction; no rea-
son given; presumed low fetal fraction/inadequate sequencing
depth. The most common reasons given for false results were:
confirmed low fetal fraction; confirmed mosaicism; no rea-
son given; test failure; maternal copy number variant (CNV).
Trisomy 18
Twenty-four studies (146 940 tests) assessed trisomy 18
and are represented in Figure 3b. Bivariate meta-analysis
produced
a
summary
sensitivity
of
0.977
(95% CI
0.952–0.989) and specificity of 0.999 (95% CI 0.998–
1.00), and a positive likelihood ratio of 1569 (95% CI
810–3149)
and
negative
likelihood
ratio
of
0.023
(95% CI 0.011–0.048). Neither test technique nor popu-
lation risk had a significant effect. For trisomy 18, 12/
24 studies reported inconclusive results. Of these, seven
studies documented an explanation (in order of fre-
quency): low fetal fraction; test failure; no reason given;
mosaicism. The most common reasons given for false
results were: confirmed low fetal fraction; confirmed
mosaicism; presumed low fetal fraction/human error;
maternal CNV; no reason given.
Monosomy X
Eight studies (6712 tests) assessed monosomy X and are
represented in Figure 3c. Bivariate meta-analysis produced
a summary sensitivity of 0.929 (95% CI 0.741–0.984) and
specificity of 0.999 (95% CI 0.995–0.999), and a positive
likelihood ratio of 1337 (95% CI 213–8407) and negative
likelihood ratio of 0.071 (95% CI 0.017–0.292). There was
no significant difference with test technique. It was not
possible to assess the effect of population risk, as there
were insufficient low-risk studies. For monosomy X, five of

 eight studies reported inconclusive results. Of these, three
studies documented an explanation (in order of frequency):
low fetal fraction; presumed human error; and no reason
given. The most common reasons given for false results
were: mosaicism and no reason given.
The five aneuploidy studies that evaluated an unselected
obstetric population reported inconclusive results, with
rates of 0.29–5.10%, and provided the same reasons for
their false and inconclusive results as with the high-risk
aneuploidy populations.
Trisomy 13: univariate meta-analysis
Sixteen studies, which equates to 134 691 tests, examined
trisomy 13 (Figure 3d). There was a summary sensitivity of
0.906
(95% CI
0.823–0.958)
and
specificity
of
1.00
(95% CI 0.999–1.00). The positive likelihood ratio was
453 (95% CI 26–7864) and negative likelihood ratio was
0.188 (95% CI 0.080–0.44039), with a diagnostic odds ratio
of 2788 (95% CI 285–27252). For trisomy 13, six of 16
studies reported inconclusive results. Of these, four studies
documented an explanation for inconclusive results: low
fetal fraction; different fragmentation rate; contamination;
assay failure; and human error. The only reason given for
false results was confirmed low fetal fraction.

Clinical application for NIPT for trisomy 21
screening
Using published data from the National Down Syndrome
Cytogenetic Register (NDSCR) 2012 annual report, we have
calculated the estimated outcomes (livebirth rate, invasive
test rate, euploid pregnancy loss rate, and undiagnosed ane-
uploidy livebirth rate) from the current standard combined
first-trimester trisomy 21 screening and from a pathway
with NIPT as both contingent (i.e. NIPT offered to women
with a positive screening after first-trimester combined
screening) and first-line screening for a population of
100 000 women using crude rates (Table S4).144 We use
the prevalence reported by NDSCR (trisomy 21, 2.2 per
1000 women; trisomy 18, 0.64 per 1000; trisomy 13, 0.26
per 1000).1 This assumes that standards for the first-trime-
ster combined screening are ‘achievable’, as described by
Fetal Anomaly Screening Programme (FASP) guidance (i.e.
for trisomy 21 a detection rate of 85% for a screen-positive
rate of 2%.145 For NIPT the summary measures are those
from our meta-analysis. For the contingent screening
model the cut-off for high risk is 1 : 1000 from first-trime-
ster combined screening, with a detection rate of 96% and
false-positive rate of 12%.146 This model assumes that all
women accept screening when offered, as it is not yet
possible to determine what the uptake of NIPT would be if
offered as a first-line test. It also assumes that all women
are required to have an invasive test for karyotyping after a
screen-positive result from combined or NIPT prior to
considering termination of pregnancy, thus the invasive test
rates will be higher than in a real-life population. It
assumes
a
0.5%
pregnancy
loss
rate
from
invasive
testing.146
These data demonstrate the influence of disease preva-
lence on test performance. If we compare combined screen-
ing with a 1 : 150 cut-off (i.e. current UK National Health
Service practice) with NIPT as a first-line test, we can
reduce the invasive test rate from 2000 to 319 per 100 000
women, the euploid pregnancy loss rate from 9 to 1 per
100 000, and the undiagnosed trisomy 21 live birth rate
from 32 to 1 per 100 000. If NIPT was used as a contin-
gent screening test for a 1 : 1000 combined screening cut-
off (i.e. as a second test following a positive combined
screening result at a 1 : 1000 cut-off), then these figures
are reduced even further compared with combined screen-
ing using a 1 : 150 cut-off: from 2000 to 222 per 100 000
women invasive test rate; from nine to zero euploid preg-
nancy loss rate, although there is less of a reduction in the
undiagnosed trisomy 21 live birth rate, from 32 to 10 per
100 000. If NIPT was used as a contingent screening test
for a 1 : 150 combined screening cut-off, then these figures
are: 2000 per 100 000 women invasive test rate; 0 euploid
pregnancy loss; and an undiagnosed trisomy 21 live birth
rate of 34 per 100 000. A two-stage contingent screening
pathway with a 1 : 1000 cut-off when compared with NIPT
as a first-line test affords a reduction in false-positive
results (12 versus 100 per 100 000 women) that are found
at the time of NIPT, as the prevalence of disease in the
population now undergoing NIPT is much higher. This is
at the expense of a ten-fold increase in undiagnosed aneu-
ploidy live births (one versus ten per 100 000 women)
because of the increased number of false negatives at the
first stage of screening that do not undergo NIPT. A cut-
off of 1 : 150 at the first stage for the combined test com-
pared with a 1 : 150 cut-off for NIPT as a contingent
screening test has little effect on the number of false nega-
tives (33 versus 34); however, the invasive test rate is
reduced (2000 versus 188 per 100 000 women).
Discussion
Main findings
Our results demonstrate that for fetal sex and rhesus D sta-
tus, cffDNA-based NIPT has a high sensitivity and speci-
ficity. For the aneuploidies trisomy 21, and in particular
trisomy 18
and
trisomy 13,
we
have
demonstrated
improved accuracy from other recent systematic reviews,
likely
to
be
linked
with
technological
developments.

results were poorly reported across all conditions.
Strengths and limitations
This
review
was
performed
according
to
a
rigorous
methodology, with efforts made to reduce bias in partici-
pant selection and clinical applicability by excluding case–
control studies, performing bivariate meta-analysis and
meta-regression analysis, and assessing the impact of differ-
ential verification (i.e. different reference standards). Bivari-
ate meta-analysis is the recommended approach for the
meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies. This is
because a conventional univariate analysis makes assump-
tions that are known not to be tenable (that the sensitivity
and specificity from the same study are independent); how-
ever, the bivariate meta-analysis model is a technically diffi-
cult model to fit, and it is well known that these models
might not converge when there are a small number of
studies, or when there are zero cells (i.e. sensitivity or
specificity close to 100).26 We observed no indication that
other model fits were unstable, and so have no reason to
be concerned about the statistical validity of the other
results. Our review also evaluates more conditions than
previously. In addition, our article has been able to assess
the impact of test technique and population risk. We were
unable to evaluate the number of samples that failed QC
measures, as this was reported in varying degrees. When
considering the implementation of a new test, information
regarding failed tests and inconclusive results is vital.147,148
We investigated the reasons for false-positive and false-
negative results within and across studies, and attempted to
summarise these. This was again hampered by poor report-
ing, with a common reason cited of low fetal fraction, which
is difficult to measure accurately and thus has led to varia-
tions in approach between studies. It is especially important
to consider this further, as low fetal fraction has been shown
to be associated with trisomy 18 and triploidies.
A limitation of this work is that it was not possible to
account for the many subtle differences in laboratory tech-
niques, such as comparing the different combinations of
genetic markers used for each condition, or the myriad of
adjustments made to bioinformatics algorithms, as these
were so varied. This is where the results from the large
studies in screening populations are especially important,
as there is QC across laboratories and standardisation of
techniques.35,91,93,114,133 In the process of publishing this
review the search was re-run from April 2015 to Septem-
ber 2015, in view of the rapid progression in this area. This
yielded 78 new citations, of which 11 additional papers
would be eligible for inclusion, with 10 191 women in
total.3,149–158 These studies examine fetal sex (n = 436
women),
rhesus D
status
(n = 2965),
trisomy 21
(n = 6661), trisomy 18 (n = 6701), trisomy 13 (n = 6495),
and monosomy X (n = 40), which equate to a small pro-
portion of additional tests, compared with the studies that
we have already analysed. There is also now one study that
investigates thanatophoric dysplasia (n = 108), although
this cannot be included in a meta-analysis as it is the only
study to look at this condition thus far. As the search was
under a year old when the publication was accepted, we
have not included these 11 studies in our results. We are
confident that if these studies were included they would
not impact on our results and conclusions.
Interpretation
It is recognised that there are fewer studies in our meta-
analyses for trisomy 13 and monosomy X, compared with
a previous large meta-analysis,14 this is the result of exclud-
ing case–control studies and limiting studies to singleton
births. This has led to us reporting higher summary sensi-
tivities and specificities than existing analyses, demonstrat-
ing how NIPT is advancing, and supporting the belief that
NIPT will be used as the first-line screening test in the
future. Our clinical application model has highlighted the
importance of the low prevalence of disease on the positive
predictive value and false-positive rate in the case of aneu-
ploidies. Although positive and negative predictive values
are useful indicators of test accuracy, as they take into
account disease prevalence,159 we have not presented these
values within this article because of variation in disease
prevalence among the study populations included.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates that there is a sufficient body of evi-
dence for the accuracy and reproducibility of cffDNA-based
NIPT to allow its introduction into routine clinical practice
within the UK; however, its role is yet to be decided.
Implications for clinical practice
The findings of this analysis support the use of NIPT as a
diagnostic test for fetal sex and rhesus status because of the
nature of these conditions and the populations being
tested. For assessment of aneuploidy the test must be con-
sidered a ‘screening test’, despite high accuracy, because of
the low prevalence of disease and influence of biological
factors such as CPM. We are aware that the National
Screening Committee (NSC) is currently reviewing all evi-
dence for aneuploidy, and is likely to recommend NIPT as
a contingency screening test in the UK (Dr Pranav Pandya,
pers. commun., 2015). For trisomy 21 screening this will
ensure access to an accurate, non-invasive test, and will
ensure equity for many more women (i.e. the test threshold
40

 has less of an impact on offering invasive testing, and the
test can be offered throughout gestation not just in a small
first-trimester window), although this must be balanced
with consideration of the important ethical repercussions
that need to be addressed (i.e. a test that can assess for
multiple conditions and those with a milder phenotype,
and also test for conditions within the mother, e.g. sex-
chromosome anomaly or cancers).160 There are also coun-
selling implications as access to a non-invasive, highly
accurate test still needs careful consideration by parents.
Implications for future research
The authors recommend that the same rigorous assessment
of evidence and accuracy performed here be applied to
studies with multiple pregnancies once the evidence base is
sufficient.
The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-
funded RAPID study that has used NIPT in an NHS setting
for women in whom combined testing gave a risk of
≥1 : 1000 will soon be published. This study aims to: assess
the uptake of NIPT, and whether if the addition of NIPT
to the trisomy 21 pathway affects the uptake of trisomy 21
screening and invasive testing; provide a detailed health
economic evaluation using a tool developed in conjunction
with the UK NSC; find optimal ways to deliver education
to women and healthcare professionals; and calculate the
sensitivity and specificity of NIPT for aneuploidy when
performed in an NHS regional genetics laboratory. The
results from our review indicate the latter (accuracy results
from an NHS regional genetics laboratory) will be an
important outcome, as it will remove the influence of
results from the commercial sector and poor reporting.
This will allow for improved QC, enable the continued
assessment on a national basis, and ensure that the cost of
NIPT will improve further. Similarly, the conditions for
which NIPT will be used are likely to increase: 11 studies
that examined single-gene mutations and microdeletions
could not be included in our meta-analysis because they
included fewer than five participants. Even whilst writing
this review larger studies are being reported on these con-
ditions.161
Any
economic
evaluation
of
this
first-line
screening with NIPT would also need to include maintain-
ing access to a high-quality first-trimester ultrasound scan,
including nuchal translucency (NT) assessment, to allow
dating, viability, multiple pregnancy, structural anomaly,
and adnexal assessment, and importantly the assessment of
the risk of cardiac anomalies and increased pregnancy loss
associated with raised NT.
