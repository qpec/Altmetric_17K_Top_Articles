Purpose
Obesity after a diagnosis of specific cancers has been associated with worse prognosis. We ex-
amined the trend in obesity prevalence among cancer survivors in the United States in the past two
decades and compared trends with those of adults without a history of cancer.
Patients and Methods
This was a population-based nationally representative sample of 538,969 noninstitutionalized US
adults 18 to 85 years old with and without a history of cancer who participated in annual cross-
sectional National Health Interview Surveys from 1997 to 2014. Obesity was defined as body mass
index $ 30 kg/m2 for non-Asians and body mass index $ 27.5 kg/m2 for Asians.
Results
Among 32,447 cancer survivors identified, the most common cancer diagnoses were breast
(n = 6,948), prostate (n = 3,984), and colorectal (n = 2,546). From 1997 to 2014, the prevalence of
obesity increased from 22.4% to 31.7% in cancer survivors and from 20.9% to 29.5% in adults
without a history of cancer (P for trend , .001, both groups). Over this period, the estimated rate of
annual increase in obesity prevalence was higher in women and men with a history of cancer
compared with those without a history of cancer (all P for interaction , .001). The estimated rate of
annual increase in obesity prevalence was 3.1% in female and 3.7% in male colorectal cancer
survivors, 3.0% in breast cancer survivors, and 2.1% in prostate cancer survivors (all P , .001). In
subgroup analyses, populations with the highest rates of increasing obesity burden were colorectal
cancer survivors, breast cancer survivors, and non-Hispanic blacks.
Conclusion
From 1997 to 2014, obesity increased more rapidly among adult cancer survivors compared with the
general population. Colorectal and breast cancer survivors and non-Hispanic blacks were identified
as being at the highest risk for obesity.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a major public health issue associated
with increased morbidity and mortality in the
United States and globally.1-3 According to the
most recent US obesity trends analysis, the preva-
lence of obesity escalated from 1980 to 2000 and
continued to increase among non-Hispanic black
and Mexican-Americanwomen from 1999 to 2010.4
By 2030, the continued increase in obesity in the
United States and the United Kingdom is projected
to cause an additional 6 to 8.5 million new diagnoses
of diabetes and 5.7 to 7.3 million new diagnoses of
heart disease and stroke, and a loss of 26 to 55
million quality-adjusted life-years.5
Obesity has also been associated with cancer
incidence, progression, and survival, especially in
hormonally and metabolically driven cancers such
as breast and colorectal cancer.6-9 The projected
increases in population-based obesity rates likely
pose additional health hazards for cancer survivors.
For example, recent studies suggest that weight at
the time of breast cancer diagnosis and weight gain
after diagnosis are both associated with higher
cancer mortality and all-cause mortality.10-12
Although patients with cancer and cancer survi-
vors are subject to similar energy-balance–related
causes of weight gain as is the general population of
the United States, they are also at risk for increased
weight gain caused by specific cancer treatments,
including chemotherapy, steroid medications, and

 hormonal therapy.13,14 Several national organizations recommend
weight control for cancer survivors,15,16 and a recent ASCO position
statement encouraged oncology care providers to address weight
management among their patients.9 Whether US cancer sur-
vivors have experienced different rates of changes in obesity
burden compared with adults without a history of cancer has
not been evaluated. Large population-based studies are needed
to evaluate whether a distinct obesity pattern and trajectory
exist in cancer survivors.
To better inform future research on obesity and cancer sur-
vival and to inform the planning and implementation of weight-
loss interventions in cancer survivors,17 we compared trends from
1997 to 2014 in obesity prevalence in US adults with and without
a history of cancer. We hypothesized that the prevalence of obesity
would increase over time among adults both with and without
a history of cancer, and that the amount of annual increase would
be greater in adults with a history of cancer. To identify populations
of cancer survivors at the highest risk for obesity, we examined
trends in obesity prevalence among cancer survivors by cancer
type, age, race/ethnicity, and time since diagnosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Participants
The analysis used data from adult participants 18 to 85 years of age in
the annual 1997 to 2014 waves of the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS). The NHIS is an ongoing cross-sectional survey of the health
status, health care access, and behaviors of the US civilian non-
institutionalized population conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics. Details on the NHIS sample design are published else-
where.18 Briefly, each year, the NHIS uses multistage probability sam-
pling to select 428 primary sampling units from approximately 1,900
geographically defined primary sampling units covering the 50 states and
the District of Columbia. Approximately 41,000 households and 107,000
individuals are selected each year. The NHIS has used two sets of
questionnaires since 1997: (1) a set of basic health and demographic
items (ie, the Core questionnaire) for all individuals living in a house
and (2) one or more sets of questions on current health topics (ie, the
Supplements) for one adult and one child, each randomly selected from
each house. The Cancer Screening questionnaire has been included as
a supplement every year since 1997. The NHIS annual response rate is
approximately 80%. In this analysis, we used data from adults who
responded to both the Core questionnaire and the Cancer Screening
supplement. All NHIS activities undergo human subject oversight, and
participants provide informed consent.
Cancer History
Interviewers asked participants if a physician or other health pro-
fessional had ever informed them that they had cancer, and if the answer was
yes, in what year the cancer diagnosis occurred. Cancer survivors included
individuals who reported a cancer diagnosis at any age and excluded those
who reported only nonmelanoma skin cancers.
Obesity
Self-reported height and weight were used to compute body
mass index (BMI, kg/m2). BMI was categorized as underweight
(BMI , 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to , 25 kg/m2),
overweight (BMI, 25 to , 30 kg/m2), class I obesity (BMI, 30 to
, 35 kg/m2), and class II/III obesity (BMI $ 35 kg/m2).19 For Asians,
the WHO Asian cut points were applied for underweight (BMI
, 23 kg/m2), overweight (BMI, 23 to , 27.5 kg/m2), and obese (class
I, BMI $ 27.5 kg/m2 and class II/III, BMI $ 32.5 kg/m2) participants.20 In
analyses of obesity prevalence, we dichotomized BMI as nonobese and obese
(BMI , 30 kg/m2 v $ 30 kg/m2 for non-Asians; BMI , 27.5 kg/m2 v
$ 27.5 kg/m2 for Asians).
Demographic and Behavioral Information
Participants provided self-reported information on age, sex, race/
ethnicity, education, employment, family income, health insurance coverage,
nation of birth, current smoking behavior, current alcohol use, physical
activity, and noncancer chronic conditions.
Statistical Analyses
NHIS-constructed survey weights were applied to account for the
NHIS complex stratified sampling methods and to make estimates rep-
resentative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized adult population.18 To
compare population characteristics over time, survey participants were
grouped into six consecutive 3-year samples (1997 to 1999, 2000 to 2002,
2003 to 2005, 2006 to 2008, 2009 to 2011, and 2012 to 2014). In descriptive
analyses for each sample, Pearson’s x2 tests were used to compare demographic
and health characteristics of cancer survivors and cancer-free participants;
a Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparisons.21 To
examine the differences in obesity prevalence between cancer survivors and
cancer-free participants, the age-standardized prevalence of obesity was
calculated for each sample using the 2000 US population for appropriate
comparisons between the survey years.22 Cochrane-Armitage trend tests
were used to determine whether demographic and health characteristics of
the population changed over time for each group. Changes from the first to
the last survey were compared between the two groups using Z-tests. To
visually illustrate changes in obesity prevalence over time, we calculated the
age-standardized prevalence of obesity for each survey year by sex and
cancer status and displayed the results as smoothed lines using locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing.23 The same method was used to display the
prevalence of adults with one or more chronic condition(s) by cancer and
BMI category.
Individual-level data on obesity status were aggregated by survey year,
sex, age group, and cancer status, accounting for survey weights. These data
included the estimated number of obese and nonobese adults by survey
year, sex, age group, and cancer status. The aggregate data were used to
analyze the prevalence of obesity over time, and the unit of analysis was the
count of obese and nonobese individuals in the population for each year-
sex-age-cancer group. Poisson regression was used to estimate the rate ratio
because the distribution of the primary outcome (ie, the number of obese
individuals in a specific population) is a discrete frequency distribution
that counts the number of events occurring in a fixed period of time. We
estimated the relative increase in obesity prevalence per year using Poisson
regression adjusting for age, and fit models separately by sex and cancer
type. We tested the interaction between year and cancer status to test for
differential annual increases in obesity prevalence between all cancer
survivors compared with participants without a history of cancer. We
also separately tested the interaction between year and cancer status for
survivors of each of the most common cancers, including colorectal, breast,
and prostate cancer. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age group, race/
ethnicity, and length of cancer survivorship.
All tests of significance were two tailed, with a = .05. Analyses were
performed using R (version 3.2.4; https://cran.r-project.org/). All analyses
used the R survey package24,25 to apply the complex survey design.

Greenlee et al
 Table 1 by NHIS participation time period and cancer history
status. Over the 18-year period, the proportion of US adults with
a history of cancer increased steadily (5.1% between 1997 and
1999, 5.3% between 2000 and 2002, 5.5% between 2003 and 2005,
5.6% between 2006 and 2008, 6.2% between 2009 and 2011, and
6.2% between 2012 and 2014). In almost all periods, compared
with adults without a history of cancer, cancer survivors were more
likely to be female, non-Hispanic white, have been born in the
United States, have higher education attainment, not currently
employed, have lower incomes, have health insurance, be a heavy
smoker, a light-to-moderate drinker, and have more than one
chronic condition (all P values , .001).
Obesity Trends
The prevalence of obesity consistently increased from 22.4%
in 1997 to 31.7% in 2014 in cancer survivors and from 20.9% to
29.5%, respectively, in adults without a history of cancer (P for
trend , .001 for both groups; Fig 1; Table 1). Meanwhile, there was
a decreasing prevalence of normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to , 25 kg/m2)
and underweight (BMI , 18.5 kg/m2) individuals and no consistent
change in overweight individuals in adults with and without a history
of cancer (Fig 1; Table 1). Across the time periods, changes in obesity
prevalence were similar in women (21.2% to 35.0% in cancer
survivors v 19.2% to 29.4% in adults without a history of cancer)
and men (17.0% to 34.9% in cancer survivors v 19.1% to 29.2%
in adults without a history of cancer). Of particular note, among
women, across all time periods, the prevalence of class I obesity was
consistently higher in cancer survivors compared with women
without a history of cancer (13.6% to 21.0% in female cancer
survivors v 12.2% to 16.6% in women without a history of
cancer), and the differences grew larger over time (Fig 1).
Over the study period, the prevalence of obesity was estimated
to increase by 2.9% and 2.8% each year for women and men,
respectively, with a history of cancer, and by 2.3% and 2.4%,
respectively, for women and men without a history of cancer
(Table 2; Fig 2). The annual increase in the rate of obesity was
significantly greater in women and men with a history of cancer
compared with those without a history of cancer (all P for in-
teraction , .001). The elevated annual increase in rates of obesity
was even higher in colorectal (3.1% in women and 3.7% in men)
and breast (3.0%) cancer survivors compared with adults without
a history of cancer but was lower in prostate (2.1%) cancer sur-
vivors (all P for interaction , .001).
Subgroup Analyses of Obesity Trends by Age, Race/
Ethnicity, and Years Since Diagnosis, by Cancer Type
The prevalence of obesity among the most common cancers
(colorectal, breast, and prostate) was examined by age, race/
ethnicity, and years since diagnosis (Table 3). The prevalence of
obesity grew more rapidly in nearly every subgroup of colorectal
and breast cancer survivors compared with the corresponding
groups of adults without a history of cancer (all P for interaction
, .001). Among colorectal cancer survivors, women 18 to 44 years
of age, non-Hispanic blacks, and those 2 to 9 years from diagnosis
had the highest increasing rates of obesity. Among female breast
cancer survivors, women 18 to 44 years of age, non-Hispanic whites,
and those # 1 year from diagnosis were the groups with the highest
increasing rates of obesity (all P for interaction , .001). The patterns
were different among men. Among male colorectal cancer survivors,
the increasing rates of obesity were highest among men 65 to
85 years of age, non-Hispanic blacks, and those $ 10 years from
diagnosis. Among prostate cancer survivors, men 18 to 44 years of
age, non-Hispanic whites, and those 2 to 9 years from diagnosis had
the highest increasing rates of obesity (all P for interaction , .001).
Trends in Chronic Conditions
The percentages of adults with one or more noncancer chronic
condition(s) increased over time independent of BMI and
cancer history (Appendix Fig A1, online only). Within each BMI
category, cancer survivors are systematically more likely to have
one or more noncancer chronic condition(s) compared with adults
without a history of cancer.
DISCUSSION
In a large, population-based, nationally representative sample, we
observed a consistently increasing burden of obesity from 1997 to
2014 in US adults with and without a history of cancer. Across this
time period, cancer survivors had a significantly faster increase in
obesity prevalence compared with adults without a history of
cancer. The faster increase in obesity prevalence was more pro-
nounced in women, in breast and colorectal cancer survivors, and
in non-Hispanic blacks. Our findings suggest that the trajectory of
the US obesity burden will continue to increase, which will result in
an increased burden of obesity in the general population and thus
increase the number of obesity-related cancers, and also result in
an increased burden of obesity among cancer survivors, including
those cancers in which obesity is associated with poorer cancer
outcomes.
On the basis of current trajectories, we identified population
characteristics of cancer survivors at the highest risk of obesity,
which are important patient populations in which oncology care
providers should focus weight management efforts. In female
colorectal cancer survivors, those who are young and non-Hispanic
black and have been diagnosed within 2 to 9 years have the highest
increasing rates of obesity. Similarly, among female breast cancer
survivors, those who are young, were diagnosed within the past
year, and are non-Hispanic white have the highest increasing
obesity rate. Among male colorectal cancer survivors, the highest
increases in obesity are among older men, non-Hispanic blacks,
and those $ 10 years from diagnosis. In contrast, prostate cancer
survivors with the highest increases in obesity burden are younger,
non-Hispanic whites 2 to 9 years from diagnosis. Previous studies
of weight change in prostate cancer showed similar patterns, which
found younger age at diagnosis and lower baseline BMI to be
predictors of weight gain after diagnosis.28,29 However, increased
BMI was most likely to occur in the first year of therapy for prostate
cancer survivors.30
Given that breast and colorectal cancer are the two cancers
most closely linked to obesity, our findings can be partially
explained by the growing population of patients with breast and
colorectal cancer in whom obesity may have been in the causal
pathway for disease.31-33 However, we have identified additional

aPearson’s x2 test results between adults with and without cancer within each period were statistically significant (all P , .001 after Bonferroni correction) for sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment, income,
insurance, nativity, current smoking, and current drinking.
bTrend test for proportions over time showed statistically significant trends in all sample characteristics (all P , .001 after Bonferroni correction). Z-tests were used to compare changes in characteristics between
populations with and without cancer for the first (1997-1999) and last (2012-2014) periods; there were statistically significant differences for all characteristics (all P , .001 after Bonferroni correction), expect for the
proportion of employed adults.
cThe projected size of populations with and without cancer were estimated using National Health Interview Survey complex survey design and cancer survey weights.
dIndividuals’ total incomes in the previous year, including hourly wages, salaries, tips, and commissions.
eHealth insurance included self-reported Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, insurance offered at workplace, military health care/Veterans Affairs insurance, Medi-Gap, and Indian Health Service insurance.
fSmoking: current smoking was defined as self-reported smoking at the time of interview, heavy smoking was defined as smoking every day, and light-moderate smoking was defined as currently smoking less than every day.
gAlcohol use: current alcohol use was defined as having at least 12 drinks of any type of alcoholic beverage in the past year, heavy drinking was defined as having at least 1 day with five or more drinks during the past
year, and light-moderate drinking was defined as any current alcohol use that was less than heavy drinking.
hPhysical activity: adults classified as partaking in regular leisure-time activity reported at least three sessions per week of vigorous leisure-time physical activity lasting at least 20 minutes in duration or at least five sessions
per week of light/moderate physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes in duration.26

 populations of cancer survivors at risk of obesity in whom the
effects of obesity are not as well understood. In addition, it is
important to consider obesity among cancer survivors not only in
relation to cancer outcomes, but also in relation to other comorbid
conditions. Although the association between increased BMI and
recurrence and survival is not fully understood, it is well estab-
lished that obesity can influence other medical conditions such as
diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia,
which may affect overall survival.1,2 In addition, specific chemo-
therapy agents have cardiac adverse effects that can be com-
pounded by higher BMI.34 Among breast and prostate cancer
survivors, the majority will die as a result of cardiovascular disease
and not cancer.35,36 Studies of breast, colon, and prostate cancer
showed that comorbid conditions increase 5-year all-cause and
cancer-specific mortality.37,38 Therefore, it is important to consider
obesity among cancer survivors not only in relation to cancer
outcomes, but also in relation to other comorbid diseases.
A major strength of this study is that it was based on a large
and nationally representative sample, making our results gener-
alizable to the US adult population. Our estimates of prevalent
cancer cases were similar to estimates of the National Cancer
Institute’s SEER program. Using the NHIS data, we estimated that
there were 14,250,194 cancer survivors in 2012 and 14,673,007 in
2013. In comparison, SEER reported that there were an estimated
13,776,251 cancer survivors in 2012,39 and the National Cancer
Institute estimated that there were 14,483,830 cancer survivors in
2014.40 Our estimates were slightly higher than the SEER estimates
of total prevalent cases, likely because our sample came from the
noninstitutionalized population in the US, who may have been
healthier than institutionalized individuals. Another strength of the
study is that the ascertainment of cancer history was uniform and
consistent across geographic regions and survey years, which
helped reduce ascertainment bias. From this population-based
sample of US adults, we were able to identify a large number of
cancer survivors of different ages and race/ethnicities and at dif-
ferent stages of cancer survivorship, allowing for statistically robust
comparisons in each subgroup of survivors. Nevertheless, our
results do have limitations. First, the secular trends in obesity
prevalence were observed using cross-sectional data over time;
therefore, the observed faster increase in cancer survivors would be
overestimated if leaner cancer survivors are at greater risk of
mortality. Conversely, weight loss associated with heavy smoking41
and cachexia42 in cancer survivors may have biased our estimates
toward the null. Second, the NHIS uses respondents’ self-reported

in US adults with and without a history of a cancer
diagnosis. Survey-weighted and age-standardized preva-
lence of five BMI categories were estimated for men and
women with and without a history of cancer at each
survey year. BMI was categorized according to National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines as un-
derweight (BMI , 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI,
18.5 to , 25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI, 25 to , 30 kg/m2),
class I obesity (BMI, 30 to , 35 kg/m2), and class II/III
obesity (BMI $ 35 kg/m2). For Asians, the WHO Asian cut
points were applied for underweight (BMI , 23 kg/m2),
overweight (BMI, 23 to , 27.5 kg/m2), and obesity (class
I, BMI $ 27.5 kg/m2 and class II/III, BMI $ 32.5 kg/m2).

 height and weight to calculate BMI, which may introduce in-
formation bias because obesity awareness has changed over time. It
has been shown that self-reported weight and height data un-
derestimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity.4,43 Our
estimate of obesity prevalence in 2013 (29.6%) was comparable
with findings from another self-reported national survey, the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which reported the
obesity prevalence for US adults 18 years of age and older as 28.9%
in 2013.44 However, estimates of obesity prevalence from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which uses
clinical measurements of height and weight, were slightly higher.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey results
from 2011 to 2012 reported a 34.9% obesity prevalence for adults
20 years of age and older,45 as compared with the 29.6% estimate
reported here. Third, because of the ecologic nature of this study,
our findings may have limited inference on individual level obesity
risk. Fourth, income may not be a good measure of socioeconomic
status because it may reflect retirement income for older pop-
ulations. Therefore, we examined additional socioeconomic fac-
tors, including education, employment, and health insurance
coverage. Finally, we were unable to assess factors contributing to
obesity because we lacked data on cancer stage, cancer treatment
received, and detailed lifestyle behaviors, all of which can affect
weight and cancer survival.

Fig 2. Trends in obesity prevalence in US adults from 1997 to 2014, by sex, cancer history and race/ethnicity. (A) Obesity trends by sex and cancer history. Obesity
(defined as body mass index $ 30 kg/m2) prevalence was estimated for men and women with a history of any cancer, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers, and those
without a history of cancer. Separate Poisson regression models were fit for each group to estimate the annual increase rates in obesity prevalence during this period. Each
line represents the trend of predicted obesity prevalence over the specific period. Tests of differential increased rates showed that the increased rates were significantly
higher among female cancer survivors compared with women without a history of cancer, and significantly higher among survivors of all cancer and colorectal cancer in
men (all P for interaction , .001). (B) Obesity trends by race/ethnicity. Subgroup analyses by sex and race/ethnicity were conducted for all cancer survivors. The difference
in increased rates of obesity prevalence was greater in non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics.

 Our findings suggest that obesity is a growing public health
burden for cancer survivors, which requires attention. Although it is
well known that unfavorable lifestyle factors may contribute to the
overall increase in obesity, future research should identify and act on
modifiable risk factors that may be responsible for the steeper
obesity trends in cancer survivors. Moreover, we have identified
subgroups of cancer survivors who may be at the greatest risk of
obesity and who may benefit from effective, targeted interventions
