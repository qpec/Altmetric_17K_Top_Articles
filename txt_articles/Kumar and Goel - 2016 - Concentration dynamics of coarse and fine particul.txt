 Concentration dynamics of coarse and fine
particulate matter at and around signalised traffic
intersections†
Prashant Kumar*ab and Anju Goela
The understanding of rapidly evolving concentrations of particulate matter (PMC) at signalised traffic
intersections (TIs) is limited, but it is important for accurate exposure assessment. We performed “mobile”
and “fixed-site” monitoring of size-resolved PMCs in the 0.25–34 mm range at TIs. On-road mobile
measurements were made inside a car under five different ventilation settings on a 6 km long round
route, passing through 10 different TIs. Fixed-site measurements were conducted at two types (3- and
4-way) of TIs. The aims were to assess the effects of different ventilation settings on in-vehicle PMCs and
their comparison during delay conditions at the TIs with those experienced by pedestrians while crossing
these TIs. We also estimated the zone of influence (ZoI) for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 under different driving
conditions and fitted the probability distribution functions to fixed-site data to understand the
concentration and exposure dynamics of coarse and fine particles around the studied (3- and 4-way) TIs.
The fine particles (PM2.5) showed a strong positive exponential correlation with the air exchange rates
under different ventilation settings compared with coarse particles (PM2.5–10) showing an opposite trend.
This suggested that the ventilation system of the car was relatively more efficient in removing coarse
particles from the incoming outside air. On-road median PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 during delays at the TIs
were �40%, 16% and 17% higher, respectively, compared with free-flow conditions on the rest of the
route. About 7% of the average commuting time spent during delay conditions over all the runs at the TIs
corresponded to 10, 7 and 8% of the total respiratory deposition dose (RDD) for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1,
respectively. The maximum length of the ZoI for PM2.5 and PM1 was highest at the 4-way TI and the
maximum length of the ZoI for PM10 was highest at the 3-way TI. The on-road average RDD rate of PM10
inside the cabin when windows were fully open was up to �7-times that for pedestrians at the TIs.
Environmental impact
Signalised traffic intersections (TIs) are pollution hotspots that contribute disproportionately higher to overall commuting exposure. Studies characterising the
exposure to coarse and ne particulate matter (PM) at such hotspots are yet limited. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of in-cabin exposure to ne
and coarse PM under ve different ventilation settings and compares in-cabin exposure at TIs with pedestrian exposure. The ndings of this work advance our
understanding of the zone of high PM pollution around TIs and assist in making an informed choice on ventilation settings of cars to limit exposure at such
pollution hotspots.

Introduction
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed outdoor air
pollution among the top ten health risks faced by human beings,
which causes seven million premature deaths every year.1
Epidemiological studies have provided real-world evidence of
associations between concentrations of airborne particulate
matter (PM) and adverse health outcomes such as respiratory
and cardiovascular diseases.2 In the year 2013, about 61% and
87% of the urban population in the European Union (EU) was
exposed to PM10 (#10 mm) and PM2.5 (#2.5 mm) concentrations
exceeding the daily limit imposed by the WHO for outdoor air
pollution.3 This study also linked PM2.5 exposure to 403 000
premature deaths in 2012 in the EU.3 Signalised traffic inter-
sections (TIs) are known as pollution hotspots but studies
focusing on understanding the concentration dynamics of
coarse (PM2.5–10) and ne (PM2.5) particles at and around such
TIs are yet limited and therefore taken as the focus of this study.

 Travelling time has increased over the years in the UK and
elsewhere,4 indicating a growing need for accurate exposure
assessment during daily commuting. For example, the UK
population spent about an hour each day in vehicles during
commuting in 2013; the average trip time during the year 2013
increased by 16% from 20.4 min in 1995/1997.4 Our recent
study5 has shown that in some cases as low as 2% of the
commuting time spent at TIs could contribute as high as 25% of
the total commuting exposure to particle number concentra-
tions (PNCs). A similar contribution of exposure during
commuting can be expected for particle mass concentrations
(PMCs) but is currently unavailable.
As summarised in Table 1, a number of commuting exposure
assessment studies have become available in recent years but
similar studies focusing at TIs are still limited. Furthermore,
there is a certain longitudinal distance along the road legs from
the centre of a TI that experiences increased levels of exhaust
emissions due to interruptions in vehicle speed at the traffic
signals. In our previous work,6 we dened this affected longitu-
dinal length of the road as the zone of inuence (ZoI) of a TI. The
pollutant concentration in this zone can be many times higher
compared with the rest of the route. For instance, Kim et al.7
observed that the ZoI of a 4-way TI for oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
extends from �200 to 200 m from the centre of the TI under stop-
and-go driving conditions. They found that about 200 to 1000
ppb of additional NOx was observed within the ZoI compared
with the rest of the route length. Goel and Kumar6 found the
length of the ZoI to be �11 to 134 m from the centre of a 4-way TI
during multiple-stopping driving conditions. Studies assessing
the ZoI for PM are currently unavailable, and hence the ZoI is
estimated in this work for PM10 (#10 mm), PM2.5 (#2.5 mm) and
PM1 (#1 mm) under diverse driving conditions at TIs.
Some studies have focused on in-vehicle exposure (Table 1)
and xed-site measurements of PM (Table 2) but studies
covering diverse ventilation settings are yet limited. In this
work, we have compared pedestrian exposure with in-vehicle
exposure
under
ve
different
ventilation
settings.
Such
comparisons are important for understanding human exposure
at these pollution hotspots and identify the driving and venti-
lation conditions that are favourable to reduce the exposure of
in-vehicle occupants and passers-by at TIs.
Fitting of the probability distribution function (pdf) to
pollutant
concentration
data
allows
the
assessment
of
frequency ranges of concentrations experienced by urban
dwellers,8 besides assisting in evaluation of policies and emis-
sion intervention measures.9–11 A number of past studies have
tted the pdf to air pollution data and details about these
studies can be seen elsewhere.12,13 However, there are hardly any
studies that have attempted to t the pdf to different PM types
at TIs, which is one of the aims of this study.
The distinctive features that aim to ll the existing research
gaps of this work are as follows. Firstly, as opposed to previous
studies14–19 that have analysed the effect of ventilation settings
and
traffic
conditions
on
in-cabin
PMCs
at
individual
commuting routes, this study has assessed the effect of venti-
lation settings and driving conditions on in-cabin PMCs at
pollution hotspots such as TIs. Secondly, this is the rst time

 the ZoI of four different types of TIs under varying driving
conditions (stop-and-go as well as multiple-stopping) is esti-
mated for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. Thirdly, a comparison of
human exposure at (i.e. in-vehicle) and around (i.e. pedestrian)
the TIs is presented to understand the dynamics of exposure at
these hotspots. Finally, this is the rst time the pdf is tted to
PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 data at TIs. Such a tting is important in
assessing the frequency and variability in PMC exposure at TIs.
In summary, this work addresses various poorly understood
questions: (i) what is the effect of different ventilation settings
on in-vehicle PMCs on the overall route?, (ii) how do the
concentration and exposure levels vary during congested traffic
conditions at TIs compared with free-ow traffic conditions on
the rest of the route?, (iii) how does the length of the zone of
inuence (ZoI) vary at different types of TIs under stop-and-go
driving conditions?, (iv) what is the distribution of different PM
types (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1), and (v) how does exposure to
different PM types differ at (i.e. on-road or inside the vehicle)
and around (i.e. pedestrian) TIs?

Materials and methods
2.1
Site description
As a part of a comprehensive experimental programme,5,6,12 we
carried out “mobile” and “xed-site” monitoring of size-
resolved PMC in the 0.25–34 mm range in Guildford, Surrey.
Guildford is a typical UK town that has 137 580 inhabitants.20
Most of its traffic eet, involving buses and trucks, run on diesel
fuel. Around 32% of the passenger cars run on diesel while all
the new cars coming on-road from 1 September 2015 comply
with Euro 6 standards. The roads in the town usually experience
congestion due to traffic during morning and evening peak
hours. The car ownership in Guildford Borough is greater than
the national level, with each household, on average, possessing
about 1.5 cars compared with 1.16 cars nationally.21
The mobile measurements were performed inside a car on
a 6 km long round route that passed through 10 different TIs
(Fig. 1a). As described in our previous work,6 based on the
number of roads intersecting at these TIs and built-up area
around a TI, these TIs were divided into four categories: (i) 4-way
TI with no built-up area (TI4w-nb), (ii) 4-way TI with a built-up
area (TI4w-wb), (iii) 3-way TI with no built-up area (TI3w-nb), and
(iv) 3-way TI with a built-up area (TI3w-wb). Here, TIs with a built-
up area were assumed to be those TIs that were located in
a street canyon with continuous rows of buildings on both sides
with an aspect ratio of 0.8 to 0.9. TIs with no built-up area were
the TIs that were surrounded by residential or commercial
buildings but these buildings with height from 6 to 12 m were
placed far apart. Out of ten TIs, four (TI1, TI2, TI4 and TI6) were
TI4w-nb, three (TI3, TI7 and TI9) were TI3w-nb, one (TI10) was
TI4w-wb and the rest were TI3w-wb. The average daily traffic ow
on different roads intersecting at these TIs was obtained from
the DoT.22 The total traffic volume at a TI was estimated by
summing the traffic ow on each of the roads intersecting at
a TI. TI8 and TI7 cater to the highest traffic ow of 160 824 veh
per day while it was lowest (9846 veh per day) at TI3. Further
description of the routes and the TIs can be seen elsewhere.5,6

 Fixed-site measurements were conducted at two different
types (4- and 3-way) of TIs. The three-way TI is located in the city
centre of Guildford and has three intersecting roads (legs 1, 2
and 3; Fig. 1c). The sampling location was around 4 m away
from leg 2 in front of St. Savior's church. This TI has a signal
cycle (i.e. total time of red, yellow and green lights) of around
83 s with the length of red light varying from 31 to 68 s on
different legs of the TI. The four-way TI is located in a suburban
area of Guildford and has 4 intersecting roads (i.e. legs 1, 2, 3
and 4; Fig. 1d). The sampling location was around 3 m away
from leg 4 (Fig. 1d). This TI has a signal cycle of around 116 s;
the length of the red light varied from 51 to 82 s on different legs
of the TI. Further details on both these TIs can be seen in the
study by Goel and Kumar.12 The average daily traffic ow on
different roads intersecting at both of these TIs was obtained
from 5 minute manual traffic count every hour. The total traffic
volume at a TI was estimated by summing the traffic ow on
each of the roads intersecting at the TI (ESI Table S1†).
2.2
Instrumentation
Mobile measurements were conducted in a diesel-fuelled car
(Ford Fiesta; 2002 registration; 1400 cc). The experimental car
was equipped with a front disc brake and a rear drum brake
system. The ventilation system was equipped with a roughly 8
month old pleated paper lter. There were three non-smoking
occupants in the car, including the driver, during the measure-
ments. The experimental car was equipped with lter-tted
ventilation and heating systems. A GRIMM spectrometer (model
1.107E) was deployed on the back seat of the car to measure
PMD in the 0.25-34 mm size range at a sampling rate of 6 s. The
instrument uses the optical scattering technique to classify the
particles in 32 size channels. To ensure the quality of the
collected data, rst the instrument was calibrated in a three-step
process by the manufacturer prior to on-site measurements.
Secondly, we carried out on-site calibration by weighing (mg) the
polytetrauoroethylene (PTFE) lters that collected particle
mass during the on-site measurements and compared these
masses with the data of PM mass produced by the instrument.23
The results of this comparison showed about 6% difference
between the PMC estimated based on mass collected on a lter
and the PMC given by the instrument and were therefore
considered reliable. This instrument was successfully deployed
in our previous studies during mobile23 and indoor measure-
ments,24,25 where further details of its working principle, detec-
tion efficiencies and quality control of the data can be found.
The position and speed of the vehicle were continuously recor-
ded every second using a Global Positioning System (GPS; Gar-
min Oregon 350). A Panasonic HC-V500 camera was positioned
on the dashboard of the car to take traffic videos at the time of
measurements.
Timestamps
of
all
the
instruments
were
matched in the beginning of the experiment to maintain the
same starting time for collected data.
The same instrumentation set-up and sampling rate were
used to collect the PMD data during the xed-site measure-
ments at both the TIs. Traffic ow videos at the TIs were
continuously recorded for the entire monitoring period using
the Panasonic HC-V500 camera. As in the case of mobile
measurements,
timestamps
of
all
the
instruments
were
matched in the beginning of each experiment.
2.3
Data collection
2.3.1
Mobile measurements. Measurements were con-
ducted during morning and evening peak hours of March to
April 2014. Travel was made in the north (N)–south (S) direction
during morning peak hours and in the S–N direction during the
evening hours with the intention of following the most
agglomerated lanes. As described in Table 3,5 the ve different
ventilation settings were used in order to assess their effect on
in-cabin PMCs. Out of the total 74 runs, 43 runs were made
during morning hours and the rest during the evening hours.
The run time during morning and evening hours was almost
similar (i.e. 16 � 4 and 17 � 4 min during morning and evening
hours, respectively).
The air exchange rate (AER) of the experimental car was esti-
mated for different settings (Table 3), using the methodology
described in the study by Goel and Kumar.5 The method uses

 decay rates of measured concentrations of carbon dioxide as
a tracer gas. Each of the ve ventilation settings was tested at least
for 4 hours, except Set1, for which 8 hours of measurements were
collected. The meteorological data during the measurements were
collected from a weather station located at Heathrow airport.26 The
meteorological data of this station have also been used by other
studies carried out in Guildford.5 During the measurement period,
temperature and relative humidity inside the cabin were found to
be 16 � 3 �C and 51 � 10%, respectively. The wind rose diagrams
for the periods of sampling are shown in Fig. 1b. These diagrams
classied the wind direction into 8 different categories: northwest
(NW;
292.5–337.5�),
north
(N;
337.5–22.5�),
northeast
(NE; 22.5–67.5�), east (E; 67.5–112.5�), southeast (SE; 112.5–157.5�),
south (S; 157.5–202.5�), southwest (SW; 202.5–247.5�) and west (W;
247.5–292.5�). By using the average wind speed and considering
moderate incoming solar radiation during the measurements,
atmospheric conditions were categorised as Pasquill stability class
B during the measurements.27
2.3.2
Fixed-site
measurements.
Two
different
sets
of
measurements were conducted at the studied 3- and 4-way TIs.
As described in Table 4, each of the two sets of measurements
included monitoring at: (i) the corners of the TIs (i.e. �1.5 m
above the road level close to the breathing zone; these
measurements are referred to as “xed-site” measurements), (ii)
at ve different points (i.e. at 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 m) away from
the centre of TIs for the assessment of “horizontal decay
proles”. A total of 75 600 data points of size-resolved PMDs
were collected at a frequency of 6 s during a total of 126 h of
xed-site measurements at both the TIs. A total of 10 800 data
points of size-resolved PMDs were obtained during 18 h of
measurements for horizontal proles at a sampling frequency
of 6 s at both the legs of the 4-way TI. To acquire a representative
data set at each sampling point, the samples were taken for
11 min in an hour at each sampling point, by manually repo-
sitioning the location of the instrument.
Fig. 1e and f show the wind rose diagram for the measure-
ments at both the TIs. The hourly meteorological data (i.e. wind
speed, wind direction, temperature and relative humidity)
during all the measurements were obtained from the nearest
meteorological station (i.e. the Royal Horticulture Society's
garden in Wisley). The average wind speed, ambient tempera-
ture and relative humidity during the measurements were
3.0 � 1.3 m s�1, 9.0 � 4.8 �C and 52.6 � 14.6% at the 4-way TI,
respectively. The corresponding values at the 3-way TI were
3.5 � 1.9 m s�1, 5.3 � 2.7 �C and 63.5 � 7.9%, respectively. The
atmospheric condition is classied as Pasquill stability class B
at both the TIs.
2.4
Estimation of local background PMCs
The background concentration changes from location to loca-
tion depending on the sources and dispersion conditions, as
shown by the various background concentration maps by
DEFRA.28 Following the approach used in our previous work,6
we estimated local background PMCs for each run during the
mobile measurements by taking the 5th percentile value of 30 s
rolling average of the 6 s concentration time series.29 This
methodology was adopted to smooth the data and to exclude
the impact of micro-scale variations on traffic emitted PM. The
estimated values of background PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 under
each of the ve ventilation settings are provided in ESI Table
S2.†
For xed-site measurements, local background PMCs were
derived by using two different approaches. For the 4-way TI, we
rst monitored PMCs at an upwind background location. Given
the identical meteorological conditions during the background
and on-site measurements, the background measurements
were assumed to be representative of the background PMCs for
the 4-way TI on 28 April 2015. Comparison of our measured
background and the estimated background using the on-site
data indicated that the total background PMCs were equal to
the 5th percentile of 6 s average PMC measured at the 4-way TI.
Following this observation and the approach, the background
PMCs were estimated for the rest of the days at the 4-way TI as
well as at the 3-way TI. A similar approach has been used by
previous studies to deduce local background levels.6,29 Average
background PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations were found to
be 22 � 21, 16 � 15 and 13 � 15 mg m�3 at the 3-way TI,
respectively. The corresponding values at the 4-way TI were
16 � 10, 11 � 6 and 8 � 6 mg m�3, respectively. Our estimated
background values compare well with the urban background
studies elsewhere. For example, the estimates of DEFRA30
suggest urban background PM2.5 concentration in the southern
UK to be about 17 mg m�3 during the winter season.
2.5
Estimation of delay periods, ZoI, RDD rate and tting of
pdf at TIs
Delay at a TI is the time lost by commuters due to signal and
traffic conditions.5 There are different types of delays at TIs,
serving different purposes. Control delay is a sum of three types
of delays (acceleration, stop and deceleration); this is usually
measured to analyse the effect of control such as traffic signal.31
Following the approach used in our previous work,5 velocity–
time plots were drawn for identifying the locations where
deceleration and acceleration occurred in the vicinity of a TI

 calculating the corresponding delays (ESI Fig. S1a†). A delay
event occurs at a TI under two types of driving conditions
(i.e. stop-and-go and multiple stopping). There are always delay
conditions at one leg of the TI (where the signal light is red) and
simultaneously free-ow conditions on another leg (where the
signal light is green). Due to simultaneous occurrence of
different driving conditions at different legs of the TIs, it was
not possible to segregate the data for delay events from the
xed-site measurements and, therefore, the waiting time at a TI
when the signal is red is referred to as delay conditions here-
aer in the text.
The ZoI represents the length of a road around a TI that is
affected by higher particle mass emissions as compared to the
rest of the route where free-ow driving conditions persist. The
ZoI is estimated based on the intersecting points of driving
speed versus distance, and PMCs versus distance, proles at a TI.
The example demonstrating the method to estimate the ZoI is
shown in ESI Fig. S2.† For estimating the ZoI, PMC data for
�200 m distance from the centre of each of the TIs were
extracted. This preliminary distance was chosen based on our
prior eld experience.6 We observed that the effects of traffic
lights on emissions die back to normal during free-ow traffic
conditions by the end of about 200 m in each direction on the
chosen route.6 The ZoI was then estimated for delay conditions
at the TIs.
The RDD rate for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 is estimated by using
eqn (1):
Deposited doses (in thoracic, tracheobronchial, alveolar regions)
of PM fractions ¼ (VT � f) � DFi � PMi
(1)
where VT is the tidal volume, f is the frequency of breathing, DFi
and PMi are the deposition fraction and PMC of particle size i in
mm. We used VT as 800 cm3 per breath and f as 0.35 for men
during light exercise conditions.32 DFi is estimated for the mass
median diameter (dp) of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 based on eqn (2),

diameters for different PM fractions. The average DF for
different ventilation settings in mobile measurements and at
two types of TIs during xed-site measurements is presented in
ESI Table S3.†
At both the TIs, the statistical pdf was tted to a total of 18
combinations, i.e. two monitoring locations � three different
times (6 s, 15 min and 1 h) averages � three PM types (PM10,
PM2.5 and PM1). A total of 61 different statistical pdfs were
tested on each of the 18 combinations and goodness of t
parameters were estimated by using the Anderson–Darling
(A–D) method.13 Based on a thorough visual inspection of the
pdf plots and histograms and the goodness-of-t test criteria, all
the 61 distributions were ranked and the “best t” distribution
was selected for each of the 18 combinations. In order to
identify the type of distribution that could t the majority of the
time averaged series of PMCs, a “common” distribution among
the top ten ranked distributions was chosen.

Results and discussion
The size of particles is an important parameter to determine
their sources and behaviour in the respiratory system. There-
fore, measured PMCs have been divided into three sizes
(PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) for discussion. The overall framework of
the results presented in this section is presented in ESI Fig. S4.†
3.1
On-road PMCs
As discussed in Section 2.3, on-road PMCs were measured
inside the cabin with windows fully open (i.e. Set1). Since
contribution to coarse (PM2.5–10) and ne (PM2.5) particles
comes from different sources, we discussed the obtained PMCs
in these two different fractions (Fig. 2a). Coarse particles are
usually dominated by the non-exhaust sources such as road
abrasion, brake and tyre wear while ne particles are mainly
due to fuel combustion in engines.33 The on-road concentration
of coarse particles during the evening runs (33 � 9 mg m�3) was
found to be about twice that during morning runs (16 � 4 mg
m�3); no such differences were observed for ne particles
(Fig. 2a). This can be explained due to higher fugitive dust
emissions during the evening.34 These higher fugitive dust
emissions can be expected during the evening hours compared
with those during the morning hours due to a higher surface
temperature of the road and a lower surface moisture content.
The fraction of coarse particles, aer subtracting the back-
ground, during the morning (69 � 6%) and evening (77 � 5%)
hours dominated the total PMCs. These observations suggest
that on-road coarse particles are principally affected by non-
exhaust emissions during different hours in a day.
For comparison with the literature, we have estimated
average on-road PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations that were
found to be 44, 21 and 14 mg m�3, respectively (ESI Table S4†). A
study by Chan et al.35 was located for comparison where they
measured PM10 (140 mg m�3) and PM2.5 (106 mg m�3) concen-
trations inside a car in Guangzhou (China) with the windows
fully open, using a TSI Dustrak 8520 model. The average PM10
and PM2.5 concentrations reported by Chan et al.35 were about
3- and 5-times higher than those observed in our study,
respectively. Previous studies have reported about 1.8-times
higher concentrations of PM2.5 by using the TSI instrument
compared with the GRIMM, contributing to some of the
observed differences.36 The remaining differences can possibly
be explained by 3.5- and 4.5-times higher background PM10
(97 � 26 mg m�3) and PM2.5 (72 � 190 mg m�3) concentrations in

 Chinese cities37 compared with those estimated in our case
(i.e. 28 � 6 and 16 � 2 mg m�3 of PM10, and PM2.5, respectively).
3.2
In-cabin PMC
Fig. 2b–d show the run-wise average of coarse and ne parti-
cles for in-cabin PMCs under four different ventilation settings
(Set2–Set5). Contrary to Set1, the concentration of coarse
particles under Set2 (which represents heating at 50% and fan
at 25% on) during morning runs was found to be twice that
during evening runs (12 � 4 mg m�3). No such variations were
observed between the morning and evening runs for coarse or
ne particles under the rest of the settings (Fig. 2b–d). The
fraction of coarse particles constituted most of the PMCs
under Set2 (57%), Set4 (76%) and Set5 (69%), except Set3 where
ne particles dominated the PMC with the contribution of
�53% (ESI Table S4†). The higher fraction of ne particles
under Set3 could be due to higher AER since the inltration of
outside air with exhaust particles is expected to increase with
the increase in AER.38 This observation is substantiated by
a strong positive exponential correlation (R2 ¼ 0.95) between
AER and the fraction of ne particles for all settings as
opposed to a negative exponential correlation (R2 ¼ 0.95) with
coarse particles (ESI Fig. S5†). This positive correlation
between AER and ne particles also suggests that the lters of
the ventilation system are more efficient in removing coarse
particles, compared with ne particles, from the incoming
outside air.
The average in-cabin PM10 concentration was 31 � 8, 23 � 7,
38 � 12 and 45 � 14 mg m�3 under Set2, Set3, Set4 and Set5,
respectively (ESI Table S4†). PM10 under Set2 was within a factor
of 2 of those reported by Int Panis et al.14 for Brussels (Belgium)
and Geiss et al.17 for Ispra (Italy). This was presumably due to
the effect of traffic volume (98 753 veh per day) in our study that
was 1.9-times that reported by Int Panis et al.14 with about 38%
less vehicle speed than that in our case (21 km h�1). No such
data on traffic volume and driving speed were available for
comparison with the work of Geiss et al.17 Our PM10 under Set5
(windows closed, fan and heating off; 45 � 14 mg m�3)
compared well with that measured (43 � 23 mg m�3) by Gulliver
and Briggs18 in Northampton, UK (Table 1). This similarity can
be expected given that both these studies were carried out in
a typical UK town during the winter season and the route
selected in both the studies was heavily trafficked with frequent
queuing and congestion.
The average PM10 aer subtracting the background was
found to be highest under Set5 and lowest under Set3 (ESI Table
S4†). The possible explanation for this could be different AERs
under these settings. A strong negative linear correlation
(R2 z 0.94) between AER and PM10 under different ventilation
settings suggests that there will be a decrease in dilution (and
hence an increase in PM10) with the decrease in AER. Interest-
ingly, the relationship between AER and PM10 concentration is
opposite to what is usually observed between AER and airborne
nanoparticles5 that is represented by PNCs.39,40 This indicates
that coarse particles and nanoparticles behave differently under
different ventilation settings.
As for ne particles, average in-cabin PM2.5 was found to be
13 � 5, 12 � 4, 9 � 3 and 14 � 7 mg m�3 under Set2, Set3, Set4 and

 Set5, respectively (ESI Table S4†). The PM2.5 concentration
under Set2 was within a factor of 2 of those reported by Wei-
chenthal et al.15 in Toronto (6.6 mg m�3) and Montreal
(13.6 mg m�3), Canada, and Geiss et al.17 in Ispra (13.6 mg m�3),
Italy. The PM2.5 concentration under Set5 (14 � 7 mg m�3) was
identical to that measured (16 � 16 mg m�3) by Gulliver and
Briggs18 in Northampton, UK (Table 1). The average PM2.5 aer
subtracting the background was highest under Set2 and Set3
and lowest under Set4 (ESI Table S4†). The highest PM2.5 under
Set2 and Set3 can be explained by greater intake of outside air
due to high AER under these settings as compared to Set4.
Average in-cabin PM1 was found to be 9 � 4, 11 � 4, 5 � 2, and 9
� 5 mg m�3 under Set2, Set3, Set4 and Set5, respectively (ESI Table
S4†). Contrary to PM10, a strong positive linear correlation
(R2 ¼ 0.58) was observed between AER and average PM1 under
different ventilation settings. This indicates that penetration of
exhaust particles inside the cabin decreases with a decrease in AER,
resulting in decreasing in-cabin PM1. Comparison of our results
suggests that PM1 for Set2 is well within the range of those reported
by Geiss et al.17 (i.e. 0.8–82.9 mg m�3) in Ispra (Italy). Likewise, PM1
under Set5 compares well with that measured by Gulliver and
Briggs18 (i.e. 7 � 10 mg m�3) in Northampton, UK (Table 1).

 3.3
Spatial variations in PMCs
Fig. 3a–c show the spatially averaged plots of 6 s averaged PM10,
PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations on the studied route using the
data collected for Set1 (i.e. windows fully open, representing on-
road PMCs). Consistently higher PM10 was observed near the
TIs (Fig. 3a–c), mainly due to relatively higher non-exhaust
emissions due to break and tyre wear41 at the TIs compared with
free-ow conditions. Likewise, relatively higher exhaust emis-
sions are expected at the TIs, contributing to increased PM2.5
and PM1 levels, because of larger fuel consumption in con-
gested traffic conditions compared with free ow traffic condi-
tions on the rest of the route.5
To further assess the effect of congested conditions at TIs on
PMCs, the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were segre-
gated for delay and non-delay conditions at all the TIs on the
studied route using the approach explained in Section 2.5
(Fig. 3d). Median PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 during the delay period
at the TIs were found to be 57, 23 and 15 mg m�3, respectively;
these were 40%, 16% and 17% higher than the corresponding
values on the rest of the route with free-ow traffic conditions.
In addition to traffic driving conditions, geometries and the
built-up area around TIs also affect the dispersion of PM emissions
and hence the PMCs. To analyse the effect of geometries and the
built-up area around the TI on PM fractions, we further divided our
TIs into the following 4 categories based on the surrounding built-
up area: TI4w-nb, TI3w-nb, TI4w-wb and TI3w-wb. The results are sum-
marised in Table 5 and the average PM is shown in Fig. 3e–h.
Median PM10 was found to be 59, 60, 59 and 58 mg m�3, PM2.5
as 22, 24, 27 and 26 mg m�3 and PM1 as 15, 14, 20 and 18 mg m�3
at TI4w-nb, TI3w-nb, TI4w-wb, and TI3w-wb, respectively (Table 5).
Interestingly, the median PM10 was almost approximately similar
at all four categories of TIs (Table 5), indicating that the built-up
environment has very little effect due to its relatively larger
setting velocity. This was not the case for the median PM2.5 and
PM1, which were highest at TI4w-wb where the traffic volume was
also largest compared with other TIs with a built-up area
(i.e. 93 340, 85 335, 108 554, 107 784 veh per day at TI4w-nb, TI3w-nb,
TI4w-wb and TI3w-wb, respectively). Moreover, accumulation of
ne PMCs at the TIs with built-up area is expected to be higher
due to limited dilution than the TIs with no built-up area.42
The above discussions show that delay conditions at TIs can
result in 40%, 16% and 17% higher PM10, PM2.5 and PM1,
respectively, compared with those on the rest of the route with
free-ow conditions. The effect of built-up area around a TI on
PM10 was almost non-existent. Conversely, an increase of about
10% and 30% in median PM2.5 and PM1 was found at TIs with
a built-up area compared with TIs with no built-up area.
3.4
ZoI at the TIs under different driving conditions
Delay conditions affect the certain length of the road around
a TI, which is referred to as ZoI.6 The longitudinal distance,
representing the ZoI at the TIs, is estimated using the method
explained in Section 2.5. The ZoI is expected to vary for different
fractions of PM due to their distinct sources.33 This section
discusses the extent of the ZoI for three different fractions of
PM (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) at four different categories of TIs
(TI4w-nb, TI4w-wb, TI3w-nb and TI3w-wb) for delay events during
stop-and-go and multiple-stopping driving conditions, which
occur frequently at the TIs. Each of the studied 10 TIs was
divided into the above-mentioned four categories of TIs and
then the ZoI at each of the 10 TIs during each individual run was
derived (ESI Tables S5–S10†). These runs were then divided into
stop-and-go and multiple stopping driving conditions. A
summary of ZoI ranges (i.e. maximum, minimum, median and
average) for stop-and-go and multiple stopping driving condi-
tions is presented in Table 6 and ESI Table S11,† respectively.
Comparison of different ranges of ZoI suggests that the
maximum length of the ZoI was found to be up to 1.5, 1.6 and
1.7-times the median length for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively,
under both driving conditions at all the TIs. The median length
was within �5% of the average length of the ZoI for all fractions of
PM (Table 6 and ESI Table S11†). Given that the maximum and
median values are most relevant for both the driving conditions;
these are chosen for the subsequent discussions.

 There are some common features between both the driving
conditions. For example, the maximum length of the ZoI for
PM2.5 and PM1 was highest at TI4w-nb under both the driving
conditions. Irrespective of the PM type, a negative linear
correlation has been observed between the maximum length of
the ZoI and average acceleration (i.e. R2 ¼ 0.35, 0.50 and 0.50 for
PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively, under stop-and-go driving
conditions; the corresponding values for multiple stopping are
R2 ¼ 0.59, 0.86 and 0.98). These observations suggest that
irrespective of the driving condition, the maximum length of
the ZoI depends on acceleration.
Apart from some commonalities (discussed above), distinct
features of the ZoI were also observed under both the driving
conditions. For example, both maximum and median lengths of
the ZoI were largest for PM10 at TI3w-nb under stop-and-go
driving conditions. On the other hand, corresponding lengths
for PM10 were highest at TI3w-wb under multiple stopping
driving conditions. Similarly, the median length of the ZoI
during stop-and-go driving conditions was highest for PM2.5
and PM1 at TI3w-wb and TI4w-nb, respectively (Table 6) while the
corresponding ZoIs for PM2.5 and PM1 were highest at TI3w-nb
(ESI Table S11†) during multiple stopping conditions. Under
stop-and-go driving conditions, a positive linear correlation was
observed between the median length of the ZoI and the average
driving speed for PM2.5 (R2 ¼ 0.35) and PM1 (R2 ¼ 0.95) while
a negative linear correlation was observed between the median
length of the ZoI and the average deceleration for PM2.5
(R2 ¼ 0.24) and PM1 (R2 ¼ 0.68) during multiple stopping
driving conditions. No such correlation was seen for PM10
under both the driving conditions.
The above discussions clearly show that the ZoI exists within
the vicinity of a TI and the length of a ZoI is dissimilar for
different fractions of PM at different types of TIs. For stop-and-
go driving conditions, the ZoI depends on the average acceler-
ation and driving speed of traffic while it depends on the
average acceleration and deceleration of traffic under multiple
stopping driving conditions.
3.5
Fixed-site measurements at the 3- and 4-way TIs
The diurnal proles of three different types of PM (i.e. PM10,
PM2.5 and PM1) at 3- and 4-way TIs are shown in Fig. 4a. At both
the TIs, the diurnal proles of PM2.5 and PM1 show the morning
and evening peaks of traffic volume, indicating that both PM2.5
and PM1 are directly inuenced by road traffic. The diurnal
prole of PM10 also showed an additional aernoon peak that
can be explained by fugitive dust emissions that are likely to be
highest around mid-aernoon when the surface temperature
was maximum, the surface moisture content was minimum,
and the mean wind speed was highest due to thermally induced
air movement.43
The percentage fraction of ne and coarse particles was
almost similar at the 3- and 4-way TIs (Fig. 4b), indicating
common exhaust and non-exhaust sources at both the TIs. The
average PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 at the 3-way TI were 39 � 24,
24 � 20 and 20 � 20 mg m�3, respectively, with the corre-
sponding values at the 4-way TI being 32 � 20, 19 � 11 and 15 �
10 mg m�3 (Table 7). On comparison, it was found that the PM10
at both 3- and 4-way TIs was within a factor of 2 of those re-
ported in published literature (Table 2), except for the report by
He et al.44 who found over 3-times higher PM10 than those found
at the studied 4-way TI. This can be explained by 3.5-times
higher average background PM10 in the work of He et al.44
compared with our background PM10 levels (ESI Table S2†).
Similarly, the PM2.5 reported at both the TIs was within �20% of
those reported in the literature (Table 2).

Probability distribution tting to PMCs during xed-site
measurements
Frequency histograms showing the range of PMCs and their
corresponding likelihood (i.e. frequency of occurrence) are
potentially more representative of exposure at TIs as compared
to average or median PMCs.11,45 Based on the frequency histo-
grams, hourly averaged PM10 at the 3- and 4-way TIs for 99% of
the total sampling duration was found to be #84 and 104 mg
m�3, respectively. The corresponding hourly averaged values for
PM2.5 were #62 and 51 mg m�3 and for PM1 as #59 and 48 mg
m�3, respectively.
ESI Fig. S6† shows frequency histograms that are used to
assess the frequency of violation of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1
concentrations against the corresponding PMCs during free-
ow (i.e. 41, 20 and 12 mg m�3 for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1,
respectively; Section 3.2). The hourly averaged PM10 at the
3- and 4-way TIs was found to exceed the average on-road
(in-vehicle with windows fully open) free-ow PM10 concentra-
tion for 41% and 24% of the total time, respectively. The hourly
averaged PM2.5 exceeded the corresponding free-ow concen-
trations for 35% and 34% of the total time at the 3- and 4-way
TIs, respectively. The hourly averaged PM1 was found to exceed
the average on-road PM1 during free ow traffic conditions for
35% and 40% of the total time at the 3- and 4-way TIs,
respectively.
The types of pdf vary for different time averages (Section 2.5).
Therefore, distribution was tted to 1 s, 15 min and 1 h averaged
total PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations at the 3- and 4-way TIs
in order to assess the effect of time averages on the pdf t. The
summary of these outcomes is presented in Table 8, which
shows the “best” and the “common” t distributions of the
PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 for three different averaging periods.

 Irrespective of PM type, inverse Gaussian is found to be the
“common” t at the 3-way TI while it is the Gamma distribution
that is a “common” t for the 4-way TI. Inverse Gaussian was
found to be the best t for 15 min averaged PM10, PM2.5 and PM1
at the 3-way TI and 6 s averaged PM2.5 and PM1 data at the 4-way
TI. The best t distribution describes the pdf of specic time
averaged PMC data well while common t distribution is the
type of distribution that could t the majority of the time aver-
aged series of PMCs adequately. This knowledge about statistical
distributions that t well to PMC data at different types of TIs
can be important for assessing the frequency of violation of air
quality standards and designing mitigation strategies.
3.7
Horizontal decay of PM along the road length at the TI
To analyse the horizontal variation in the PMCs, measurements
were carried out at ve different distances from the centre of the
TI on two different legs (3 and 4) of the 4-way TI (Fig. 4c and d).
All three types of PMCs (with R2 ¼ 0.71, 0.90 and 0.90 for PM10,
PM2.5 and PM1, respectively) were found to decay logarithmi-
cally with increasing distance from the centre of a TI at leg 3
while no such decays were observed at leg 4 of the studied TI
(Fig. 4c and d). The decay proles of PMCs are different from
those observed for airborne nanoparticles at this TI where an
exponential decay (R2 ¼ 0.68–0.71) was observed with increasing
distance from the centre of the TI at both the legs of the studied
TI.12 The differences in decay proles of different PM types and
nanoparticles can be explained by their origin. For example,
PM10 emissions mainly come from resuspension of dust and
tyre wear (Section 3.3) while nanoparticles and PM1 are from
exhaust emissions.48–50
3.8
Exposure assessment
3.8.1
On-road and pedestrian exposure at the TIs. The RDD
rate during Set1 (i.e. windows fully open) is considered as
a representative of on-road RDD rate and xed-site measure-
ments at the TIs as pedestrian exposure. The average on-road
RDD rate of PM10 (80 mg h�1), PM2.5 (7 mg h�1) and PM1
(3 mg h�1) during the delay period at TIs was found to be about
55%, 5% and 17% higher than those during the rest of the run
periods (Fig. 5a–c). Short-term exposure to PM10 under delay
conditions at TIs can contribute to a reasonable proportion of
commuting exposure. For instance, the average percentage of
time spent under delay conditions over all the runs at TIs was
about 7% of the total commuting time, but this contributed to
10, 7 and 8% of the total RDD during this run for PM10, PM2.5
and PM1, respectively (ESI Table S12†).
Pedestrian exposure was estimated using the xed-site
measurements around the TIs (Section 3.5). Median RDD rates
of PM10 were found to be 13 and 11 mg h�1 at 3- and 4-way TIs,
respectively. The corresponding values for PM2.5 were 5 and 6 mg

 h�1 at 3- and 4-way TIs, and for PM1 as 3 and 5 mg h�1 at 3- and
4-way TIs, respectively (Fig. 5a–c). These RDD rates for different
PM types at 3- and 4-way TIs are close to each other. However,
signicant differences can be seen when the exposure data for
delay and non-delay periods are segregated. For example, the
on-road RDD rate of PM10 during delay conditions was 6.2- and
7.3-times higher than those for a pedestrian at 3- and 4-way TIs,
respectively. The corresponding ratios for PM2.5 decreased 1.4-
and 1.2-times at 3- and 4-way TIs, respectively (Fig. 5a–c). These
observations suggest a disproportional increase in coarse and
ne particles during the delay conditions, with a much higher
increase in the coarse fraction.
3.8.2
In-cabin exposure during mobile measurements.
Fig. 6 shows the in-cabin RDD rates under four different
ventilation settings during delay conditions (as dened in
Section 2.5) at the TIs. Set3 (i.e. windows closed and fan fully on)
showed the lowest median in-cabin RDD rate of PM10 and PM2.5
while the lowest RDD rate of PM1 was found during Set5 (i.e.
windows closed, heating and fan switched off; Fig. 6a–c). This
can be explained on the basis of the relationship between AER
and RDD rates of different ventilation settings. For example, the
average RDD rate during the delay period at TIs was found to
decrease exponentially (R2 ¼ 0.96) for PM10 and logarithmically
(R2 ¼ 0.98) for PM2.5 with increasing AER values (ESI Fig. S7a
and b†). Conversely, the average RDD rate of PM1 was found to
increase logarithmically (R2 ¼ 0.62) with increasing AER values
(ESI Fig. S7c†).
The above discussion suggests that Set3 is the best setting,
resulting in 54 and 68% decrease in in-cabin PM10 and PM2.5,
respectively, compared with on-road RDD rate during delay
conditions at TIs (Fig. 6). Likewise, Set5 emerged as the best
setting for PM1, resulting in 76% reduction in in-cabin PM1
during delay conditions at TIs compared with the correspond-
ing values of on-road RDD rates (Fig. 6d). In case a most optimal
setting needs to be selected to reduce in-cabin exposure to all
three PM fractions, Set5 may be considered since it results in
maximum reduction in the in-cabin RDD rate of PM1 and �42%
and 59% reduction in the in-cabin RDD rates of PM10 and PM2.5,
respectively. Of course, the choice of optimal setting could
change to Set3 if the highest reduction in PM10 or PM2.5 is
considered as a primary choice.

Summary, conclusion and future
research
We carried out “mobile” and “xed-site” measurements for size-
resolved PMCs in the 0.25–34 mm size range in a typical UK town
Guildford, Surrey. The mobile measurements were carried out
on a 6 km long round route at 10 TIs. Fixed-site monitoring was
carried out at two different types (i.e. 3- and 4-way) of TIs. The
aims were to (i) assess the effects of ve different ventilation
settings on in-cabin PMCs on the overall route and during delay
conditions at the TIs; (ii) estimate the ZoI of PM10, PM2.5 and
PM1 during stop-and-go and multiple stopping driving condi-
tions at the TIs; (iii) estimate in-cabin exposure to PM types and
compare with pedestrian exposure at TIs, and (iv) understand
the range of exposure doses to which people get exposed most

 frequently at different types of TIs. The pdfs were tted to xed-
site data of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 using a statistical distribution
tting tool (Easyt). Based on the ranking of the tted distri-
butions, the “best” and most “common” pdfs were identied at
both the 3- and 4-way TIs.
The following conclusions are drawn:
� The in-cabin concentration of coarse and ne particles was
affected differently by the AER. Contrary to ne particles,
concentrations of coarse particles (PM2.5–10) decreased with an
increase in AER.
� Median PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations during delay
periods at TIs were up to 40, 16 and 17% higher than those
during free-ow conditions, indicating that TIs become hot-
spots of PMCs during delay conditions.
� The built-up area around the TIs did not show much
impact on median PM10 concentration as opposed to median
PM2.5 and PM1 that were highest at TI4w-wb due to the relatively
high traffic volume and surrounding built-up area limiting the
dispersion.
� Our results showed the existence of a ZoI within the vicinity
of a TI and that the length of a ZoI depends on the type of TI,
fraction of PM, and traffic driving conditions. For stop-and-go
driving conditions, the ZoI was found to depend on the average
acceleration and driving speed of traffic.
� Based on the tting of the pdf to the PM data at the xed-
site, the hourly averaged PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations
over the entire xed-site measurements at the 3-way TI were
found to exceed their corresponding values during free-ow
traffic conditions from mobile measurements for 41%, 34% and
35% of the total monitoring duration, respectively. The corre-
sponding exceedances at the 4-way TI were 24%, 35% and 40%,
respectively. It indicates that the frequency of exceedance
increases with a decrease in the size of the particles.
� On an average, only about 7% of the commuting time spent
under delay conditions at TIs over all the runs was found to
contribute 10, 7 and 8% of the total commuting exposure to
PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively. This indicates that TIs
become hotspots of PM during delay conditions. Exposure to
on-road PM10 under delay conditions at the TIs was 6.2- and
7.3-times higher than that for a pedestrian at 3- and 4-way TIs,
respectively. The corresponding ratios for PM2.5 were 1.4 and
1.2 at 3- and 4-way TIs, respectively.
� Set5 (i.e. windows closed, fan and heating switched off)
under delay conditions was found to be the optimal ventilation
setting for in-cabin exposure at the TIs, leading to the highest
reduction in the in-cabin RDD rate of PM1 (76%) and signicant
reduction in the in-cabin RDD rate of PM10 (42%) and PM2.5
(59%) with respect to the on-road RDD rate (Set1).
This study presents hitherto missing information related to
the effect of different ventilation settings and driving conditions
on the PMCs and associated exposure at and around the TIs. In
this study, we carried out mobile measurements on a single
vehicle, further measurements to understand the effect of age,
cabin space and lter types of different cars on in-cabin PMC
exposure are recommended. Further xed-site measurements
around TIs with varying built-up area would also be valuable to
advance the understanding of the extent of exposure around TIs.
