Previous research shows that generalized trust, the belief that most people can be trusted, is conducive to
people's health. However, only recently have longitudinal studies suggested an additional reciprocal
pathway from health back to trust. Drawing on a diverse body of literature that shows how egalitarian
social policy contributes to the promotion of generalized trust, we hypothesize that this other ‘reverse’
pathway could be sensitive to health insurance context. Drawing on nationally representative US panel
data from the General Social Survey, we examine whether the Affordable Care Act of 2010 could have had
influence on the deteriorating impact of worsening self-rated health (SRH) on generalized trust. Firstly,
using two-wave panel data (2008e2010, N ¼ 1403) and employing random effects regression models, we
show that a lack of health insurance coverage negatively determines generalized trust in the United
States. However, this association is attenuated when additionally controlling for (perceived) income
inequality. Secondly, utilizing data from two separate three-wave panel studies from the US General Social
Survey (2006e10; N ¼ 1652; 2010e2014; N ¼ 1187), we employ fixed-effects linear regression analyses
to control for unobserved heterogeneity from time-invariant factors. We demonstrate that worsening
SRH was a stronger predictor for a decrease in generalized trust prior (2006e2010) to the imple-
mentation of the Affordable Care Act. Further, the negative effect of fair/poor SRH seen in the 2006e2010
data becomes attenuated in the 2010e2014 panel data. We thus find evidence for a substantial weak-
ening of the previously established negative impact of decreasing SRH on generalized trust, coinciding
with the most significant US healthcare reforms in decades. Social policy and healthcare policy impli-
cations are discussed.

1. Introduction
On 23rd March 2010, Barack Obama as the United States (US)
President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (ACA). The enactment of the ACA represented a massive para-
digm shift in North American healthcare policy (Jacobs and
Skocpol, 2010), shifting from a strongly commodified system
(Caplan, 1989) towards a more egalitarian healthcare system. The
overarching aims of the ACA were to expand healthcare coverage,
to lower healthcare costs, and to make health insurance companies
more accountable (Medicaid.gov, 2017). Recent research shows that
it was young adults up to 26 years, minorities, and low-income
earners that benefitted most from the ACA in terms of improved
self-rated health (SRH) and greater access to affordable healthcare
(Sommers et al., 2013, 2015). By 2014 e the year coinciding with the
last observations of our panel data studies e at least an additional
20 million people had gained healthcare coverage (Blumenthal and
Collins, 2014).
Inspired by a recent US longitudinal study based on Los Angeles
data pre-ACA (McKay and Timmermans, 2017), which showed that
high community-levels of “uninsurance” undermined social cohe-
sion, our study pays attention to a key social capital dimension with
established public health implications, namely generalized trust
(Jen et al., 2010; Kawachi et al., 1999; Moore and Kawachi, 2017;
Nyqvist et al., 2008; Subramanian et al., 2002). Generalized trust
is the belief that most people, even strangers, can be trusted. It is
frequently considered an important e if not even the most impor-
tant (Rothstein and Stolle, 2008) e part of social capital because it
facilitates cooperation between strangers, making it an invaluable
solution for major collective action dilemmas (Berkman and

(R€

against pandemics (R€
onnerstrand, 2016). Of major interest to us is
that one key experience associated with fluctuations in individual
trust is a change in individual health status (Giordano et al., 2012).
More specifically, we deal with the question how changes in peo-
ple's SRH are associated with changes in individual generalized
trust (Giordano et al., 2012; Giordano and Lindstr€
om, 2016) and
whether the enactment of the ACA could influence the US health-
trust nexus.
Since the seminal study by Kawachi et al. (1999), the past two
decades have seen vast amounts of empirical evidence demon-
strating positive associations between SRH and generalized trust
(Gilbert et al., 2013; Murayama et al., 2012). Applying a diverse
range of methods and data, most studies have implicitly assumed a
causal pathway from generalized trust to health (e.g. Giordano
et al., 2012; Snelgrove et al., 2009). However, scholars have only
recently begun to question the (simplistic) unidirectional model of
causation (Ljunge, 2014; Oshio, 2016; Rocco et al., 2014). Most
recently in a temporality study employing multi-wave data from
the British Household Panel Study, Giordano and Lindstr€
om (2016)
provided empirical evidence for a complex circular relationship
between generalized trust and SRH over time, i.e. a causal path
from generalized trust to SRH and a ‘reverse’ path leading from SRH
to generalized trust. They further suggested that this circular
health/trust relationship appears more complex than the mutually
reinforcing feedback loop previously postulated by Rocco et al.
(2014), with those individuals with poor SRH having the greatest
propensity not to trust later. This ‘reverse’ path from health to trust
is the focus of this study.
Since the use of three-wave panel data, as employed in this
study, restricts the possibilities to disentangle the causal order of
two attitudinal variables (Vaisey and Miles, 2017), we refrain from
re-addressing the causality question. Assuming the existence of the
established positive path from generalized trust to health (Ljunge,
2014; Rocco, 2014), we focus exclusively on the ‘reverse’ path
from health to generalized trust, which can be interpreted twofold:
i) Improving SRH leads to an increase in trust; and ii) Worsening
SRH leads to a decrease in trust. The latter shall be studied here.
There is a broad scholarly consensus that destroying generalized
trust is much easier than creating it (Levi, 1998), hence our interest
in the potentially deteriorating impact of worsening health on
trust.
We argue that poor health translates into a decrease in trust
only under certain circumstances. Following Seligman (1997) and
Uslaner (2002), generalized trust is rooted in optimism and a
sense of control (see also Ross, 2011), factors that are primarily
shaped during the ‘impressionable years’ of childhood and
adolescence. Put differently: Generalized trust tends to be rela-
tively resistant to changes during adulthood. Consequently, only
life-events of significant impact, e.g. falling seriously ill or
becoming unemployed (e.g. Laurence, 2015), could have the po-
tential to turn adults from ‘trusters’ into ‘distrusters’. We further
argue that the negative impact of worsening health on generalized
trust could be buffered by social policy. Egalitarian social policy
measures may, for example, be targeted to provide greater access
to appropriate medical support, fair sick pay, maternity/paternity
leave, and opportunities for increased participation in society
(Starfield and Birn, 2007). Such elements are already common-
place in most Western industrialized countries (Olafsdottir and
Beckfield, 2011), and their presence may contribute to attenu-
ating the ‘reverse’ pathway association between poor health and
lower trust in these contexts.
Previous research shows that universal welfare states, as rep-
resented for example by the Nordic countries, create egalitarian
contexts that foster generalized trust (e.g. Rothstein and Stolle,
2008). People living in liberal welfare states such as the US are,
conversely, less likely to trust others (Coburn, 2000; Rostila, 2013).
We argue that the ACA constitutes an egalitarian milestone in US
healthcare history, with the potential to mitigate the deteriorating
impact of worsening health on generalized trust. More precisely,
we assume that universal healthcare systems may potentially
buffer any spillover effects from poor health into other domains of
life, such as labor force participation, family well-being, political
participation and social life. Contexts where the welfare state
adopts egalitarian healthcare provision to cushion any downward
spirals caused by deteriorating health should promote more opti-
mism and sense of control e and therefore generalized trust e than
contexts characterized by a marketization of healthcare. Before the
healthcare reform of 2010, large parts of the population remained
either under- or uninsured, despite the three-fold increase in
healthcare costs over the two decades pre-ACA (Moses et al., 2013).
The healthcare reform of 2010, unfortunately, failed to realize truly
universal healthcare coverage (see also B�
eland et al., 2016), possibly
due to the Supreme Court decision in June 2012 allowing optional
Medicaid expansion for states (Rosenbaum and Westmoreland,
2012). As a result, an estimated 28 million Americans remained
uninsured three years after its enactment (Kantarjian, 2016).
Nevertheless, the ACA was a ‘game changer’ in that it dramatically
increased the number of US residents eligible for healthcare in-
surance schemes.
While the US has suffered from a substantial and steady decline
in generalized trust since the early 1970s (Fukuyama, 1999;
Putnam, 2000; Twenge et al., 2014; Uslaner, 2002), empirical evi-
dence regarding possible interventions how to stop or even reverse
this negative trend is scarce. We seek to address this literature gap
by re-visiting the US health-trust nexus and investigating whether
associations between poor SRH and low generalized trust in the US
have been affected by the 2010 healthcare reforms. Observing such
a period-effect would further support the claim that by buffering
the adverse effects of worsening health on generalized trust,
increasing access to affordable healthcare positively contributes to
community well-being and social cohesion beyond health effects
alone (McKay and Timmermans, 2017; Sohn and Timmermans,
2017). Importantly, we assume that it is less any direct experience
of ‘Obamacare’ that should matter for mitigating the effect of
worsening health on generalized trust but rather the optimism
stemming from the prospect of an upcoming, more egalitarian
healthcare system designed to benefit previously marginalized
groups.
We hypothesize that the negative impact of worsening health
conditions on generalized trust was stronger pre-ACA than post-
ACA. By employing longitudinal survey data from two different
three-wave panel studies of the US General Social Survey, we:
i) Analyze whether individual health insurance coverage im-
pacts generalized trust,
ii) Investigate if the health-trust relationship in the US holds
using a three-wave panel design;
iii) Examine whether the negative impact of fair/poor SRH on
generalized trust was stronger pre-than post-healthcare
reform
iv) Test whether any effects regarding the impact of SRH on trust
are stratified by age, distinguishing between those that were
immediately affected by the ACA (18e25 year olds) vs. those
aged 26þ (affected by the ACA from 1 January 2014)

 2. Data and methods
2.1. Data
Our data come from the biennially conducted US General Social
Survey (GSS), which is the most widely used survey for studying
attitudinal trends in the United States since 1972 (Smith et al.,
2015).
The
target
population
includes
English
and
Spanish
speaking persons (18 yearsþ) living in non-institutional arrange-
ments within the US. Samples are full-probability samples and in-
terviews
were conducted face-to-face.
Data are anonymous,
publicly available and free to download. Total response rates (for
baseline years) ranged from 69% (2014) to 71% (2012); panel
attrition ranged from 17 to 24% per wave. Beginning in 2006, each
new round of the GSS also started a new four-year/three-wave
panel study. We employed two different GSS three-wave panel
studies for our purposes: the first started in 2006 with re-
interviews in 2008 and 2010; the second started in 2010, with
repeated measures in 2012 and 2014. One panel study covered the
four-year period immediately before the enactment of the ACA, the
other being fielded amidst the initial years of the healthcare reform.
We briefly illustrate the four-year/three-wave panel design of
the GSS by explaining sample procedures for the first ever GSS
panel study (base year: 2006). In 2008, a random selection
(N ¼ 2023) from the previous 2006 GSS study (N ¼ 4510) was
drawn. Of those 2023 respondents, 1536 (response rate: 76%) took
part in the follow-up study. Only those that took part in the second
interview (2008) had the possibility to take part in a third and last
re-interview in 2010. In the last wave, the response rate was 83%
(N ¼ 1276). The same panel design was adopted in panel study 2
(2010e14). Table A1 (online appendix) summarizes the original
sample sizes and the panel response rates of the two GSS panel
studies that we employed. After listwise deletion of cases with
missing values on continuous control measures our sample sizes
were N2008-2010 ¼ 1403; N2006-2010 ¼ 1652; and N2010-2014 ¼ 1187.
2.2. Dependent variable
Generalized trust was measured using a three-item scale
(Glanville et al., 2013) that refers to the following questions: i)
“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted
or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?” (TRUST); ii)
“Would you say that most of the time, people try to be helpful, or
that they are mostly just looking out for themselves?” (HELPFUL);
and, iii) “Do you think that most people would try to take advantage
of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?” (FAIR).
Respondents could answer indicating either a pro-trust position
(for example ‘most people can be trusted’), a distrust position (for
example, ‘can't be too careful’) or indifference (‘other/it depends’).
We followed standard practice and merged those that were un-
decided (‘it depends’) with those clearly stating a tendency toward
distrust (Uslaner, 2002). Each item was coded so that ‘1’ indicated a
pro-trust attitude (can trust, helpful, fair) and ‘0’ reflected distrust
(can't be too careful, look out for themselves, take advantage of
you). Previous research shows that this three-item scale reliably
and consistently measures generalized trust (Glanville and Paxton,
2007; Paxton, 1999). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.68 in our
samples in both panels. The three-item trust scale reflects the grand
mean of those three items, ranging from 0 (lowest possible trust) to
1 (highest possible trust). There were almost no missing values (1%)
among the three separate trust items that make up for the
2010e2014 trust scale. However, in about 23% of the occasions (649
out of 2837) in the 2006e2010 panel study, the trust score only
relied on TRUST whilst FAIR and HELPFUL had missing values.
However, TRUST is one of the most widely used and tested single-
item attitudinal measures (Uslaner, 2012), and it is highly corre-
lated (r ¼ 0.83) with the three-item scale.
2.3. Covariates
2.3.1. Self-rated health (SRH)
SRH is considered a valid predictor of morbidity and all-cause
mortality (Idler and Benyamini, 1997; Lopez, 2004; Schnittker and
Bacak, 2014), even after adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity,
marital status and BMI (Dowd and Zajacova, 2007). SRH has been
shown to be the most reliable tool for the prediction of health in
longitudinal study design (DeSalvo et al., 2006). SRH also picks up
aspects of individuals’ psychological health, namely perceived
stress levels (Mackenbach et al., 2002; Toivanen, 2011), making it a
robust subjective indicator of overall health status.
The two GSS panel studies (2006e10 and 2010e14) employed
slightly differing SRH measures, i) a four-point SRH measure
(“Would you say your own health, in general, is excellent, good, fair,
or
poor?”)
(Bowling,
2005;
Olafsdottir,
2007;
Warren
and
Hernandez, 2007); and ii) the global five-point SRH measure
(“Would you say your own health, in general, is excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor?”). Since its onset, the GSS had featured the
four-point SRH measure, only recently running the five-point SRH
measure alongside it. Previous GSS survey experiments showed
marginal distribution differences between ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ SRH re-
sponses when comparing these two items (Smith, 2005). We fol-
lowed standard practice (see e.g Carl and Billari, 2014; Giordano
et al., 2012) and dichotomized SRH, distinguishing between
excellent/good SRH (plus ‘very good’ in the five-point version) on
the one hand (0), and fair/poor SRH (1) on the other. This allowed us
to merge the four- and five-point SRH measures into one single
dichotomous SRH measure. Given the very high correlation be-
tween the two SRH measures (0.93 in 2006e10 and 0.92 in
2010e2014), this seemed justified, and it allowed us to keep a
sufficiently large sample size (N > 1000) in the 2010e2014 panel
study. By summarizing the information on self-assessed health this
way, we also performed inter-item cross-validation, allowing us to
disregard cases where deviations between the two SRH measures
were found (n ¼ 100 in 2006e2010; n ¼ 136 in 2010e2014).
2.3.2. Control variables
Descriptive overviews about our control variables and their
question wording can be found in Table A2, Table A3 and Table A4
(all in the online appendix). Analyses involved both random effects
(RE) and fixed-effects (FE) regression models (see later). Since the
former do not automatically control for time-constant variables, we
used gender, race, and age as covariates in our RE models. Race has
repeatedly been identified as a crucial determinant of generalized
trust in the US (e.g. Wilkes, 2011). Similarly, striking differences in
trust are observed among different US birth cohorts, with genera-
tional replacement being argued as one main reason for the steady
decline in US trust (Clark and Eisenstein, 2013). A recent twin-study
established substantial and significant associations between edu-
cation and generalized trust (Oskarsson et al., 2017). We thus
distinguished respondents with a bachelor/graduate university
degree from those having a minor or no degree. Previous research
(Mewes, 2014) argued that workplaces provide ideal breeding
grounds for generalized trust, because they create contexts where
people from diverse backgrounds cooperate. Moreover, Laurence
(2015) showed in a longitudinal study from the UK, that job
displacement was associated with a subsequent decrease in
generalized trust. We, therefore, controlled for labor force status,
distinguishing i) respondents in fulltime employment (reference
group) from those in part-time work, unemployment, retirement,
education, and other non-specified activities. Glanville et al. (2013)
J. Mewes, G.N. Giordano / Social Science & Medicine 190 (2017) 48e56
50
 found that social connections significantly determined changes in
generalized trust. Due to an insufficient number of observations
regarding connectivity in the 2010e2014 data, we employed
marital status as a proxy variable (see also Lindstr€
om, 2012). Since
religiosity is found to positively determine generalized trust (e.g.
Schultz et al., 2008), we also monitored people's frequency of
attending religious meetings. Fear of crime is assumed to decrease
people's trust in others (Uslaner, 2012: 128f.) and was operation-
alized by being afraid of walking at night in the respondent's
neighborhood. As Putnam (2000: 205) found a positive relationship
between small communities and trust, we included a measure for
community size. Since Southerners tend to be less trusting than
people living in other US regions (Wilkes, 2011: 1608), we also
controlled for US region (the GSS recognizes nine different regions),
utilizing ‘South Atlantic’ (comprising the following states: Dela-
ware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, District of Columbia) as the reference
category.
Interestingly, measures of income inequality such as income and
perceived material living conditions were absent among the list of
controls in the previously mentioned two-wave panel study by
Glanville et al. (2013). A recent longitudinal study based on UK and
US panel data showed that changes in income predict changes in
generalized trust (Brandt et al., 2015). Therefore, we controlled for
logged family income in constant US Dollars (base year: 1986)
having adjusted for household size (Hout, 2004; OECD, 2013).
Acknowledging that the 2007e08 financial crisis might have
influenced the relationship between income and trust, we also
included two subjective income inequality measures: 1.) Satisfaction
with family income and 2.) Perceived economic standing.
Employing FE regression models for panel data (see later), we
fully controlled for time-invariant confounders in these analysis.
Therefore, gender and race were dropped from our list of controls.
We refrained from controlling for change in US region in our FE
model, due to the short time span of this study. Fear of crime had too
many missing values in the 2010e2014 panel and was also drop-
ped. Age was omitted because it perfectly correlates with time.
3. Method
Data preparation and analyses were conducted using STATA 14.2
SE (Statacorp, 2015). The first wave of the 2006e2010 panel study
did not contain data on individual health insurance coverage, nor
did any of the 2010e2014 panel data. Therefore, we utilized two-
wave GSS panel data from 2008/2010 to model whether lack of
health insurance coverage is statistically associated with low levels
of generalized trust (descriptives regarding our categorical and
continuous measures can be found in the online appendix, see
Table A2 and Table A3, respectively). Since few respondents dis-
played change regarding health insurance coverage between 2008
and 2010 (pre-ACA), we chose an RE approach (Singer and Willett,
2003) with observations (level 1) nested in respondents (level 2).
Each individual (N ¼ 1403) could have up to two observations
(No ¼ 2211). Robust standard errors were used to account for
clustering of error terms within respondents.
Subsequently, we made full use of the three-wave panel data
from the 2006e2010 and 2010e2014 studies. In these analyses, we
sought to answer whether the negative effect of fair/poor SRH on
generalized trust pre-ACA (2006e2010) was mitigated post-ACA
(2010e2014). We conducted Hausman tests (Hausman,1978) to see
whether the structure of our data justified employing random ef-
fects models, however both panels’ (2006e2010; 2010e2014) tests
were significant (p < 0.001), so we chose to estimate fixed-effects
(FE) models (see e.g. Allison, 2009; Oshio, 2016) instead. The key
advantage of FE models is that they, per design, control for
heterogeneity caused by any (unobserved) time-constant variables
(Gormley and Matsa, 2014). Concentrating on variation within in-
dividuals over time, FE regression allowed us to treat respondents
as their own controls (Allison, 2009). The foundational FE regres-
sion model adopted here reads the following:
Trustit ¼ ai þ mt þ bХit þ εit
Trustit denoted the value of trust for unit i at time t. Our FE
model allowed both for unit-specific ðaiÞ and period-specific ðmtÞ
fixed effects. Again, we used robust standard errors to account for
clustering of error terms within respondents.
4. Findings
Investigating the impact of lack of health insurance on gener-
alized trust using two-wave panel data from 2008 to 2010 (see
Table A2, online appendix, for a descriptive overview about our
measures), respondents reporting health insurance coverage were
significantly more trusting (95%CI ¼ 0.482e0.521) than those
without (95%CI ¼ 0.330e0.402). Generalized trust was significantly
higher among respondents with good SRH (95%CI ¼ 0.482e0.526)
than among those reporting poor SRH (95%CI ¼ 0.303e0.376).
Table 1 summarizes our RE analyses findings.
Including all controls except for material living conditions, lack
of health insurance coverage exerted a statistically significant
(p < 0.05) negative impact on generalized trust (Model 1, Table 1).
After adding family income, satisfaction with family income, and
perceived financial standing (either separately or all together, as in
Table 1, Model 2), the negative correlation between lack of health
insurance coverage and generalized trust was attenuated. This
supports the hypothesis that, pre-ACA, the mechanism behind the
negative relationship between lack of health insurance coverage
and generalized trust among US residents was income inequality
(R€
ozer and Volker, 2016).
Subsequently, we employed three-wave panel data from before
(2006e2010) and after (2010e2014) the enactment of the ACA to
investigate changes in the trust-health nexus. Tables A3 and A4 in
the online appendix provide a descriptive overview over our
measures. We exclusively focused on variation within respondents
in these FE regression models. Any evidence for the hypothesis that
the ACA re-configured the US trust-health nexus thus needs to be
interpreted with caution, as our data only give indirect support. The
results from FE models based on panel data from 2006 to 2010 and
2010e2014 are summarized in Table 2.
We observe that pre-ACA, poor SRH had a statistically significant
and substantial negative impact on generalized trust. However, this
association became attenuated in terms of statistical significance
and effect size, post-ACA (2010e2014). Fig. 1 plots the marginal
impact of poor SRH on generalized trust, whilst holding the control
variables constant at their respective means.
Finally, we tested whether the observed change in the effect of
worsening health on generalized trust mainly occurred among
young adults (an immediate key feature of the ACA in 2010 was that
children could remain on their parents’ health insurance plans until
they turned 26), or whether this was something more generaliz-
able. We thus extended our models depicted in Table 2 by i) a
dummy variable indicating whether respondents were aged 25 or
younger by the time of interview (1 ¼ yes/0 ¼ no), and ii) by an
interaction between said dummy variable and fair/poor SRH (see
Table A6, online appendix for interaction term models/results). We
further calculated the predicted margins for the latter interaction,
whilst holding constant all other controls at their means (Table 3).
Focusing on the group of respondents who reported worsening
health conditions, the largest change in trust occurred among those
J. Mewes, G.N. Giordano / Social Science & Medicine 190 (2017) 48e56
51
 aged 18e25, with an average increase in trust of 0.132 from pre-
(2006e2010) to post-ACA (2010e2014), compared to 0.061 among
those aged 26 years or more. However, confidence intervals are
very imprecise, probably due to the small number of occasions
where respondents were aged 18e25 (no ¼ 207 in 2006e2010;
no ¼ 158 in 2010/2014). We are, therefore, not convinced that these
results are generalizable.
5. Discussion
The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the
timeframe of this study (2006e2014) provided a unique opportu-
nity to investigate whether a change from a strongly commodified
system of medical and healthcare (Caplan, 1989) to a more uni-
versal system could weaken the negative impact of poor health on
generalized trust (Glanville et al., 2013). Under the ACA, healthcare
provision in the US changed from being a “privilege” to a (social)
“right” (Rak and Coffin, 2013). We hypothesized that this massive
paradigm shift in policy affected the US trust-health relationship.
As a first step of analysis, we demonstrated that lack of health in-
surance coverage negatively determined generalized trust (RE
models). Secondly, using FE models and three-wave panel data
from pre- and post-ACA, we found that after the healthcare reform
of 2010, the significant and substantial association between poor
SRH and low trust seen 2006e2010 became attenuated. Further
analyses revealed that this change rather occurred among the
general population than among groups that particularly benefitted
from the ACA. While our analysis can by no means confirm that the
ACA was the sole cause of the mitigating impact of poor health on
generalized trust, we have presented empirical evidence for a
period-effect coinciding with one of the most significant US
healthcare reforms to date.
5.1. Strengths and weaknesses
This study employed panel data from the GSS, the single most
widely used survey for studying attitudinal trends in the United
States, over a timeframe during which the ACA was passed. We

Data source: 2008/2010 waves of the 2006e2010 panel study of the US General Social Survey (sample size: 2211 occasions nested in 1403 respondents).

 incorporated a three-wave panel study design to investigate change
within individuals over time (Vaisey and Miles, 2017).
We utilized a three-item scale for measuring generalized trust,
which, according to a recent methodological contribution by
Lundmark et al. (2016), is preferable over the single-item standard
trust measure (Uslaner, 2012) wherever possible. A potential caveat
here is that the three-item trust scale was solely based on the
single-item standard trust question in about 23% of cases in the
2006e2010 panel study.
Even though we used the same 2006/2008 data as Glanville
et al. (2013), there are several important differences. Firstly, we
employed three waves of panel data not two (something that is
considered crucial for studying actual change, see Singer and
Willett, 2003: 10); secondly, we drew further data from a subse-
quent GSS panel study (2010e14); thirdly, SRH was only considered
a confounding variable in their study. Fourthly, we cross-validated
our SRH measures by combining information from the four- and
five-point SRH items. Finally, we controlled for material living
conditions, which were absent as measures in their study.
Though we acknowledged the circular relationship between
generalized trust and SRH, (Giordano and Lindstr€
om, 2016), we
focused specifically on the ‘reverse’ path from SRH to trust. That our
findings support a period-effect regarding the trust-health nexus
should not be considered proof that generalized trust is uncon-
ducive to health. Past studies demonstrating a positive impact of
trust on SRH used, for example, data from panel surveys with much
larger sample sizes and employed data from studies that followed
individuals over much longer periods of time (Giordano et al.,
2012).
Unobserved time-varying confounders could have affected our
FE results; for example, the financial crisis of 2007e08 occurred
during 2006e2010 data collection. This event has been associated
with poorer health outcomes and lower trust across the United
Kingdom (Lindstr€
om and Giordano, 2016); however, the same
study showed that these population-level effects were short-lived.
We would have liked to validate our findings based on external
data; unfortunately, no alternative to the latest GSS panel study is
currently available.
Subsequent studies need to investigate whether the attenuation
of the US health-trust nexus post-ACA was a general phenomenon,
or whether it mostly occurred among previously marginalized
groups. While we, in an auxiliary model, tested the interaction
between being under 26 (yes or no) and SRH, the insufficient
sample size led to estimates that were, applied in a FE framework,
too imprecise to meaningfully interpret them.
6. Conclusion
A substantial and steady decline in generalized trust in the US
has been reported since the early 1970s (Fukuyama, 1999; Paxton,
1999; Putnam, 1995; Twenge et al., 2014; Uslaner, 2002; Wilkes,
2011). From an international perspective, this erosion of general-
ized trust is quite unique and scholars argue that it might be due to
the distinct lack of universal social policy programs characterizing
US politics (Rothstein and Stolle, 2008; Rothstein and Uslaner,
2005). While previous research into the mechanisms linking egal-
itarian welfare states with high levels of generalized trust mainly
focused on reduction in income inequality (Rothstein and Uslaner,
2005; R€
ozer and Volker, 2016; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2010), we
investigated whether the shift to a more universal system of
healthcare e the ACA e coincided with a weakening of the negative
impact of poor SRH on generalized trust. Results shown here offer
support for the hypothesis that comprehensive healthcare provi-
sion could be an important first step in halting the decline of
generalized trust in the US.
Interestingly, the ACA is still considered a ‘mixed bag’ by the US

 public (Corman and Levin, 2016; James and Van Ryzin, 2016). Public
support for ‘Obamacare’ seems to be heavily structured along the
lines of race (Morone, 2016) and political partisanship (Kriner,
2014; McCabe, 2016). However, given the importance of general-
ized trust for solving major collective action dilemmas, the ACA
may have a much broader positive impact on the US than its
original ‘healthcare’ remit (McKay and Timmermans, 2017; Sohn
and Timmermans, 2017). With the 2016 Republican election vic-
tory, it will be interesting to see if the ACA will be retained in its
current form, or whether US health insurance schemes will be re-
commodified. Finally, future studies need to investigate the sus-
tainability of the impact of the ACA on the health-trust nexus. Will
it last, or will US citizens eventually ‘revert to form’, where poor
health coincides with a lack of trust in others once again?
