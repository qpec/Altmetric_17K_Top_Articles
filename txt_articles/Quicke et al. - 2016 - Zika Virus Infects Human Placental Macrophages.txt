SUMMARY
The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil has
been directly linked to increased cases of micro-
cephaly in newborns. Current evidence indicates
that ZIKV is transmitted vertically from mother to
fetus. However, the mechanism of intrauterine trans-
mission and the cell types involved remain unknown.
We demonstrate that the contemporary ZIKV strain
PRVABC59 (PR 2015) infects and replicates in pri-
mary human placental macrophages, called Hofba-
uer cells, and to a lesser extent in cytotrophoblasts,
isolated from villous tissue of full-term placentae.
Viral replication coincides with induction of type I
interferon (IFN), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
antiviral gene expression, but with minimal cell
death. Our results suggest a mechanism for intra-
uterine transmission in which ZIKV gains access to
the fetal compartment by directly infecting placental
cells and disrupting the placental barrier.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that
has rapidly spread to over 30 countries in the Americas and
causes illness with symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, and
conjunctivitis (Lazear and Diamond, 2016; Petersen et al.,
2016). ZIKV is transmitted through several routes, including
mosquito bites, sexual contact, and blood transfusion (Lazear
and Diamond, 2016). Most notably, ZIKV can be vertically
transmitted from an infected mother to the developing fetus
in utero, resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes that include
fetal brain abnormalities and microcephaly, a condition char-
acterized by a reduction in head circumference that is often
associated with delayed or arrested brain development (Ras-
mussen et al., 2016). The mechanism by which ZIKV crosses
the placenta to establish infection in the developing fetus is
not well understood. Recent studies have identified ZIKV
RNA in amniotic fluid and fetal and newborn brain tissue (Cal-
vet et al., 2016; Driggers et al., 2016; Martines et al., 2016),
and ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies have been detected in
newborn cerebrospinal fluid (Cordeiro et al., 2016). Addition-
ally, ZIKV antigen was found in the chronic villi of a human
placenta from a mother who gave birth to an infant with micro-
cephaly, and ZIKV RNA has been isolated from placental tis-
sue of mice infected with ZIKV (Miner et al., 2016; Martines
et al., 2016). Finally, a recent study detected ZIKV antigen in
placental tissue from a mother diagnosed with ZIKV disease
(Noronha et al., 2016). In particular, ZIKV antigen was detected
in placental macrophages and histiocytes in the intervillous
space.
Vertical transmission of ZIKV from an infected mother to
the developing fetus in utero reflects tropism for placental cells.
This organ is a target for a number of viruses by direct and
contiguous infection of the cell layers, virion passage through
a breach, or cell-associated transport. Examples include
rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HIV-1, hepatitis
B and C virus, and parvovirus B19 (Koi et al., 2001). The
placenta is characterized by contact between the maternal
blood and fetal chorionic villi. Each villus is lined by tropho-
blasts, which encase the fetal blood supply and placental
macrophages (Hofbauer cells [HCs]). Several studies have
confirmed HCs are targets of viral infection in vivo (Lewis
et al., 1990) and in vitro (Johnson and Chakraborty, 2012). In
contrast, syncytiotrophoblasts (differentiated cytotrophoblasts
[CTBs]) have been shown to be resistant to infection by a
wide range of viruses (Delorme-Axford et al., 2013). A recent
study showed that syncytiotrophoblasts also appear to be resis-
tant to infection by phylogenetically related, historic ZIKV strains
at early times following infection (24 and 48 hr post-infection
[hpi]) (Bayer et al., 2016).
Here we demonstrate that primary human HCs, and to a
lesser extent CTBs, are permissive to productive infection by
a contemporary strain of ZIKV, closely related to the strains
currently circulating in Brazil. Upon infection, HCs are modestly
activated and produce IFN-a and other pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines. Analysis of antiviral gene expression shows upregulation
of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR)
transcription as well as downstream antiviral effector genes,
indicating that ZIKV induces an antiviral response in HCs and
CTBs. Our results suggest that ZIKV gains access to the fetal
compartment by infecting and proliferating in the cells of the
placenta.

 RESULTS
HCs and CTBs Are Permissive to Productive ZIKV
Infection
To determine whether human placental cells are permissive to
ZIKV infection, we isolated primary HCs and CTBs from villous
tissue of full-term placentae and infected them with ZIKV
(MOI 1). In this study, we used a low cell-culture-passaged and
sequence-verified ZIKV strain, PRVABC59 (PR 2015), isolated
from the sera of an infected patient in Puerto Rico in December
2015. This strain is closely related to the epidemic strains circu-
lating in the Americas that have been linked to in utero ZIKV
infection (Faria et al., 2016). Through multiple virologic assays,
we demonstrate that HCs, and to a lesser extent CTBs, are
permissive to productive ZIKV infection (Figure 1). Following
infection of HCs, we performed a focus forming assay (FFA) on
Vero cells and observed a steady decline in viral titers from
3 hpi through 24 hpi that was immediately followed by log phase
virus growth through 72 hpi (Figure 1A). Notably, we observed
donor-to-donor variation in viral kinetics and magnitude among
HCs isolated from five donors. For donor 2, we detected an
approximately 35-fold increase in virus in the supernatant
between 3 and 48 hpi. In contrast, donor 5 showed about a
2.5-fold increase in virus in the supernatant between 48 and

 96 hpi. We confirmed infection of HCs with viral qRT-PCR (Fig-
ure 1B) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Figures 1C–1E).
In HCs, viral RNA was substantially increased in all donors by
48 or 72 hpi, reflecting an increase in virus release into the super-
natant (Figure 1A). Furthermore, we detected viral envelope (E)
protein, which localized to distinct, perinuclear regions within in-
fected HCs (Figures 1C and 1D). This pattern may be indicative of
viral localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or ER-asso-
ciated vesicles, a staining pattern consistent with virus assembly
(Welsch et al., 2009). Finally, we observed between 4.9% and
7.2% infected cells by immunofluorescence staining using a
pan-flavivirus antibody (Figure 1E).
In contrast, we observed minimal viral replication in CTBs
at early times post-infection (3–72 hpi; Figure S1A, available
online). Of note, we found evidence of productive infection at
96 hpi, with all three donors exhibiting approximately 5-fold in-
crease in viral load between 72 and 96 hpi, suggesting that
CTBs may support productive virus infection, albeit at lower
levels compared to HCs. We observed concurrent increases in
viral RNA in all three donors between 72 and 96 hpi as well (Fig-
ure S1B). Most notably, we detected persistent viral RNA in
CTBs at all time points through 72 hpi, further suggesting ZIKV
infects and replicates in CTBs with delayed kinetics. Collectively,
these findings demonstrate that HCs are permissive to ZIKV
infection and represent a key target cell of ZIKV infection within
the placenta.
To assess ZIKV replication in HCs at the single-cell level, flow
cytometry was utilized to detect intracellular expression of viral E
protein. Consistent with peak production of viral RNA and infec-
tious virus (Figure 1), we detected 0.8%–6.8% and 0.4%–3.0%
infected HCs at 48 and 72 hpi, respectively (Figure 2A). Minimal
background staining was observed in donor- and time-matched
uninfected cells and in ZIKV-infected cells stained with an IgG
isotype control (Figure S2B). Consistent with our FFA findings,
HCs isolated from donor 2 were the most permissive to infec-
tion, with an average of 5.6% and 2.3% infected cells at
48 and 72 hpi, respectively. This is consistent with infected
cell counts observed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig-
ure 1E). In contrast to recent studies with neuronal progenitor
cells (Garcez et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016), we did not observe
a significant loss of viability during ZIKV infection through 96 hpi
(Figure S2C), suggesting that these cells may be more resistant
to virus-induced cell death or that ZIKV (PR 2015) is a less cyto-
pathic virus in HCs.
Of note, percent infectivity and infectious virus production did
not necessarily correspond to viral RNA levels (Figures 1 and 2A).
Specifically, while donors 1 and 2 had a 6-fold difference in
cellular infectivity at 48 hpi and a consistent 1-log-fold difference
in infectious virus release between 24 and 96 hpi, both had
similar viral RNA levels present at 48 and 72 hpi. Differences
in infection between donor 1 and 2 may be explained by an
enhanced rate of genome replication within HCs from donor 2,
noted by an early increase in viral RNA at 24 hpi in donor 2,
but not donor 1 (Figure 1). Overall, we observed variable levels
of viral RNA at 24 and 48 hpi, despite similar levels of viral RNA
at early (3 hpi) and late (48 and 72 hpi) time points, further sup-
porting differential rates of genome replication between donors.
Indeed, while donors 1, 3, and 4 had similar production of infec-
tious virus at all time points assessed, notable differences in viral
RNA levels were observed at 48 hpi between these donors (Fig-
ure 1). Furthermore, while donor 5 showed minimal production
of infectious virus, we observed comparable RNA levels to the
more permissive donors, further highlighting discordance be-
tween genome replication and release of infectious virus.
Together, these results suggest that different donors may have
the capacity to differentially regulate ZIKV replication and may
be restricting replication at different stages of the viral life cycle.
ZIKV Infection Induces Modest Activation of HCs
Next, to determine if ZIKV-infected HCs are poised to interact
with T cells, we measured cell surface expression of the co-stim-
ulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and MHC II. In ZIKV-infected
HCs from all three donors, we observed minimal upregulation
of both CD80 and CD86 as compared to time-matched, mock-
infected cells between 48 and 72 hpi (Figures 2B and 2C).
Consistent with enhanced virus replication, ZIKV infection of
HCs from donor 2 led to upregulation of both CD80 and CD86
by 72 hpi. Additionally, significant upregulation of MHC II was
only observed with donor 2 between 48 and 72 hpi (Figure 2D).
Overall, there appears to be donor-to-donor variability in terms
of upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules; however, enhanced
virus replication led to greater activation of HCs. These data
suggest that ZIKV infection has the potential to program HCs
for antigen presentation and T cell priming.
Type I IFN and Pro-inflammatory Cytokines Are
Produced in Response to ZIKV Infection
When cells are infected with virus, pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) within the cell recognize the viral genetic material and
trigger a potent innate immune response to control viral replica-
tion and spread. Upon binding viral RNA, PRRs initiate signaling
cascades that result in the production of type I interferons (IFNs)
and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of antiviral
effector genes that serve to limit virus replication. In order to
further assess the immunostimulatory potential of HCs, we
measured pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in su-
pernatants from infected cells by multiplex bead array. Following
ZIKV infection, we observed increased IFNa secretion, but not
IFNb or IFNl1 (IL-29; Figure 3; Table S1). We also found
increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and
chemokines MCP-1, involved in monocyte infiltration, and
IP-10, involved in recruitment of activated effector T cells.
Though these cytokines were induced in all five donors, there
were individual differences in the magnitude of production.
Donor 2, which had the highest viral load at 48 and 72 hpi (Fig-
ure 1A), tended to exhibit the highest overall levels of IFN-a,
IL-6, MCP-1, and IP-10; however, donor 2 was not consistently
the lead producer of cytokines over mock-infected controls. Of
note, donor 5, which had the lowest viral load at 48 and 72 hpi,
did not consistently show the lowest levels of cytokines, but
did exhibit reduced induction over mock-infected controls at
72 hpi. No discernable patterns could be confidently drawn
with CXCL-8, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, or IL-1RA. In contrast to HCs,
we observed limited induction of type I IFN, IL-6, and IP-10,
and no detectable type III IFN in CTBs at the time points
assessed (Figure S3A; Table S2). Donor 1, while slightly less
permissive to viral infection and replication (Figure S1), did
not have correspondingly lower levels of cytokine production
Cell Host & Microbe 20, 83–90, July 13, 2016
85
 compared to donors 2 and 3. We did observe, however, that
donor 1 tended to have reduced production of cytokines over
mock-infected control cells at 72 hpi. These findings demon-
strate that HCs are capable of initiating an inflammatory
response to ZIKV infection.
ZIKV Infection Provokes an Antiviral Immune Response
in HCs and CTBs
To evaluate the antiviral potential of HCs and CTBs, we exam-
ined the expression of several antiviral effector genes. We
observed increased expression of IFNA transcripts as early as
24 hpi in HCs (Figure 4A), concordant with increased IFNa secre-
tion (Figure 3). While we did not observe IFNb secretion, we de-
tected an increase in IFNB1 transcripts over time-matched mock
cells as early as 24 hpi (Figure 4A), suggesting possible discor-
dance between transcript levels and translation/secretion of
IFNb (Schulz et al., 2010). In contrast, both IFNA and IFNB1
were induced at low levels in CTBs (Figure S3B). We next
measured expression of the RLRs, a family of PRRs known to
recognize flavivirus RNA and induce production of type I IFNs
and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Daffis et al., 2009; Loo et al.,
2008; Suthar et al., 2010, 2013). Expression of DDX58 (RIG-I),
IFIH1 (MDA5), and DHX58 (LGP2) transcripts is induced above
time-matched, mock-infected HCs across all donors by 72 hpi
and remains highly expressed through 96 hpi (Figure 4B). RLR
expression corresponds to kinetics of virus replication, suggest-
ing that RLRs are induced in response to ZIKV infection of HCs.
In CTBs, RLR transcription is modestly induced, and both IFIH1

 and DHX58 return to near basal levels by 96 hpi, though DDX58
expression remains slightly elevated through 96 hpi (Figure S3B).
We also evaluated expression of several antiviral genes pro-
duced downstream of the RLR and type I IFN signaling axes
and found that RSAD2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and OAS1 were all
induced by 72 hpi in HCs and remained elevated through
96 hpi (Figure 4C). In CTBs, these genes were modestly induced
through 72 hpi (Figure S3B), likely corresponding to the low level
of viral replication during this time period (Figure 1). By 96 hpi, a
time point at which we observed productive virus replication,
these cells also initiate an antiviral immune response. Impor-
tantly, we observed low levels of IFNA and ISG expression in
mock-infected HCs and CTBs, likely induced by the cell isolation
procedure, which may limit the percent of infected cells we see in
our in vitro system. Taken together, these results show that both
HCs and CTBs respond to ZIKV infection through initiation of
antiviral signaling pathways.
The kinetics of the antiviral response are complex and vari-
able, and we observed donor-to-donor variation in induction of
antiviral gene expression. Of note, HCs from donor 2, which ex-
hibited the highest viral loads, and donor 5, which exhibited the
lowest viral loads, induced similar levels of antiviral effector
genes by 96 hpi, although genes in donor 2 were induced at a
faster rate (Figure 4). This may reflect the higher rate of replica-
tion and viral output by HCs from this donor (Figure 1). There is
likely a multifactorial rationale for why viral load does not corre-
late with antiviral gene expression that likely encompasses dif-
ferences in individual genetics and the antagonistic capabilities
of the virus.
DISCUSSION
The present data demonstrate that primary HCs and CTBs iso-
lated from full-term placentae are permissive to productive
ZIKV infection by a contemporary strain currently circulating in
the Americas. We also found that HCs respond to infection by
triggering antiviral defense programs in the absence of overt
cell death. In this limited study of five donors, we observed indi-
vidual variability in kinetics and magnitude of virus replication,
Figure 3. ZIKV Infection of HCs Induces
Type I IFN and Inflammatory Cytokines
HCs from five donors were infected with ZIKV (PR
2015) at an MOI of 1, or mock infected. Cytokine
levels in the supernatants were determined by
multiplex bead array. All values are represented in

inflammation, and antiviral gene expres-
sion, likely reflecting differences in indi-
vidual genetics (Querec et al., 2009;
Thio, 2008). Though unlikely given the
low number of cell passages PR 2015
has undergone, it is possible that minor
cell culture adaptations or quasi-species
may also be playing a role in donor-to-
donor variability. These observations suggest that donors may
have the capacity to restrict ZIKV at different stages of the viral
replication cycle. This may also relate to observed differences
in intrauterine transmission efficiency, where more susceptible
HCs from a pregnant mother may support higher levels of virus
replication and subsequent spread to the developing fetal ner-
vous system. Additionally, it will be important in future studies
to characterize when HCs and CTBs are most susceptible to
ZIKV infection (i.e., first, second, or third trimester). Recent
projections from the CDC based on data from Brazil indicate
that virus infection during the first trimester or early in the sec-
ond trimester of pregnancy is temporally associated with the
observed increase in infants born with microcephaly (Reefhuis
et al., 2016).
A recent study reported that primary syncytiotrophoblasts iso-
lated from full-term placentae are resistant to ZIKV infection
through a potential mechanism involving type III IFN-mediated
antiviral immunity (Bayer et al., 2016). Similarly, in CTBs we
observed a lack of productive virus replication through 48 hpi;
however, we did observe persistent viral RNA through 72 hpi.
By 96 hpi, we observed low-level virus replication as well as in-
duction of antiviral effector genes, suggesting that ZIKV infects
and persists in CTBs but is efficiently controlled at early times
post-infection. Additionally, while Bayer et al. were able to iden-
tify IFN-l (type III IFN) in the supernatant of uninfected syncytio-
trophoblasts, we did not detect the presence of IFN-l in the
supernatants of ZIKV-infected HCs or CTBs. The discordance
between these two studies may be attributed to differences in
time points assessed and viral isolates used in each study
(FSS13025 and MR766 as compared to PR 2015).
What are the possible mechanisms by which ZIKV crosses the
placental barrier and infects HCs? One explanation is that ZIKV
may initially infect trophoblasts and productively replicate and
disseminate locally within the placenta to involve HCs, which
then support more efficient ZIKV replication than CTBs. An alter-
native hypothesis is that non-neutralizing, cross-reactive anti-
bodies bind ZIKV and traffic across the placenta, through a
neonatal Fc-receptor-mediated mechanism, to infect placental
macrophages. ZIKV crossing the placenta and replication

 in/release from HCs likely result in viral dissemination through the
cord blood with subsequent infection of neural progenitor cells.
At this time, it is uncertain whether maternal macrophages are in-
fected or play a role in allowing ZIKV to cross the placental bar-
rier. However, a recent report has directly identified the presence
of viral antigen through immunohistochemistry in the placenta
from a mother with an infant who developed ZIKV-related fetal
anomalies (Martines et al., 2016). Of note, ZIKV antigen was de-
tected within the chorionic villi and not in the maternal decidua.
Based on these findings, it does not appear that decidual mac-
rophages are key players in ZIKV transmission at the placenta.
HCs are likely programmed to limit inflammation following vi-
rus infection, a mechanism that is consistent with the immune-
tolerant environment of the placenta and which would support
higher infection of HCs compared to maternal macrophages.
An alternative hypothesis is that the relative paucity of effector
cells in the placenta that would otherwise readily kill infected
macrophages (e.g., CD8+ T cells) contributes to a permissive
environment for ZIKV infection and replication in HCs. Alto-
gether, our data support the notion that HCs represent a key
target cell within the placenta. These findings stress the impor-
tance of developing antiviral therapies directed against ZIKV
replication within placental cells as a means to reduce vertical
transmission in the mother-infant dyad and the incidence of
adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
Human Placenta
Term (>37 weeks gestation) placentae from HIV-1 seronegative and hepatitis
B-uninfected women (>18 years of age) were obtained immediately following
elective cesarean section without labor from Grady Memorial and Emory
Midtown Hospitals. Approval of the study was granted from the Emory Univer-
sity Institutional Review Board (IRB 00021715) and the Grady Research Over-
sight Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from donors before
collection, and samples were de-identified prior to handling by laboratory
personnel.
Isolation of Primary Placental Cells
HCs and CTBs were dissected from membrane-free villous placenta, as pre-
viously described (Johnson and Chakraborty, 2012). HCs were isolated and
purified by positive selection with anti-CD14 magnetic beads per the manufac-
turer’s instructions. The purity of the HC population was assessed by CD14
staining and was, on average, greater than 97% (Figure S2A). CTBs were
isolated and purified by negative selection with magnetic beads (Miltenyi
Biotech). The purity of the CTB population was assessed by cytokeratin-7
staining and was, on average, greater than 97% (Chiuppesi et al., 2015).
HCs were maintained in complete RPMI medium and CTBs were maintained
in complete DMEM medium. A detailed protocol can be found in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Viruses and Infections
ZIKV (PR 2015) was isolated in 2015 from the serum of a patient who traveled
to Puerto Rico, and it was passaged three times in Vero cells. PRVABC59 was
obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and passaged
twice in Vero cells cultured in MEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Op-
tima, Atlanta Biologics) to generate working viral stocks. Viral stocks were
titered by plaque assay on Vero cells and stored in MEM with 20% FBS.
Vero cells (ATCC) were maintained in complete DMEM medium (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). HCs or CTBs were allowed to rest for �24 hr before
infecting with ZIKV (PR 2015) at an MOI of 1 for 1 hr at 37�C. Virus was washed
off, and cells were resuspended in fresh complete media and incubated at
37�C for 3–96 hr. MOI of 1 was based on results of plaque assays as well as
a recent paper where dendritic cells (DCs) (a similar cell type to macrophages)
were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 1 (Hamel et al., 2015). All work with infec-
tious ZIKV was performed in an approved BSL-3 facility.
qRT-PCR
Total RNA was purified from mock- or ZIKV-infected HCs or CTBs (2 3 105
cells per condition) using the ZR-96 Quick-RNA Kit (Zymo Research) per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Purified RNA was reverse transcribed using the
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) using
random hexamers. For quantitation of viral RNA and analysis of host gene
expression, qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) per the manufacturer’s instructions. For quantitation

directed against the amplified ZIKV E gene region. Host gene expression
was performed using SYBR green with appropriate primer sets (Supplemental

Flow Cytometry
The following mouse anti-human antibodies were purchased from BioLegend
or Becton Dickinson: CD14 (M5E2), CD80 (2D10), CD86 (IT2.2), and
HLA-DR (G46-6). Unconjugated 4G2 monoclonal antibody was kindly pro-
vided by Jens Wrammert and subsequently conjugated with APC (Novus
Lightning-Link). In total, 2 3 105 HCs or CTBs were used per condition.
Cells were stained for surface markers and permeabilized to stain for ZIKV
E protein. A detailed protocol can be found in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Multiplex Bead Array
Cytokine analysis was performed on supernatants from mock- or ZIKV-in-
fected HCs or CTBs (2 3 105 cells per condition) using a human cytokine
25-plex panel (ThermoScientific) and a custom two-plex panel with human
IFNb and IFNl1 (eBioscience) per the manufacturer’s instructions, and read
on a Luminex 100 Analyzer.
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was dependent on the number of donors. HCs were isolated from
five donors and CTBs were isolated from three of these donors. Experiments
with HCs were repeated twice (three donors in the first experiment and two do-
nors in the second). Experiments with CTBs were repeated once (three donors
in one experiment). All statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 6,
with significance assessed by Mann-Whitney U test with p < 0.05. Infectivity as
assessed by 4G2 staining utilized a one-tailed test. Cell activation as assessed
by surface staining utilized a two-tailed test.
