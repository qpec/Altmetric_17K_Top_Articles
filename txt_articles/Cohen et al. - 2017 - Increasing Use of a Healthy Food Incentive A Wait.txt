Introduction: Diet-related disease is disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities
where fruit and vegetable consumption is far below guidelines. To address financial barriers, Double
Up Food Bucks (DUFB)—a statewide healthy food incentive—matches Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) funds spent at farmers markets. However, incentive use is limited. This
study examined the impact of a brief waiting room–based intervention about DUFB on program
utilization and produce consumption.
Study design: Longitudinal, repeated measures, quasi-experimental trial.
Setting/participants: SNAP-enrolled adults at a health center in a low-income, racially and
ethnically diverse area of Southeast Michigan.
Intervention: Participants received a brief explanation of DUFB, written program materials, a map
highlighting market locations and hours, and an initial $10 market voucher. DUFB use and produce
consumption were measured through four surveys over 5 months (August 2014–January 2015).
Main outcome measures: Outcome measures included DUFB use and fruit and vegetable
consumption (analyses conducted in 2015–2016).
Results: A total of 302 eligible adults were identified, and 177 (59%) enrolled. One hundred twenty-
seven (72%) completed all surveys. At baseline, 57% of participants reported shopping at a farmers
market within the last year; 18% had previously used DUFB. By the end of the DUFB season,
participants were significantly more likely to report DUFB use than at baseline (AOR¼19.2, 95%
CI¼10.3, 35.5, po0.001), with 69% of participants reporting use of DUFB at least once, and 34%
reporting use of DUFB three or more times. Adjusted fruit and vegetable consumption increased
from baseline by 0.65 servings/day (95% CI¼0.37, 0.93, po0.001) at 3 months, and remained 0.62
servings/day (95% CI¼0.32, 0.92, po0.001) higher than baseline 2 months post-DUFB season.
Conclusions: A brief clinic-based intervention was associated with a nearly fourfold increase in
uptake of a SNAP incentive program, as well as clinically and statistically significant increases in
produce consumption. Results suggested sustained behavior change even once the financial incentive
was no longer available. Providing information about healthy food incentives is a low-cost, easily
implemented intervention that may increase produce consumption among low-income patients.

 INTRODUCTION
D
iet-related diseases, including diabetes, heart
disease, hypertension, and obesity, are among
the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in
the U.S.1,2 This disease burden is disproportionately
concentrated in low-income communities where access
to healthy food is limited, and fruit and vegetable (FV)
consumption is far below national dietary guidelines.3–5
The high cost of produce relative to calorie-dense,
nutrient-poor foods represents a significant barrier to
more healthful eating in low-income communities.6–9
In addition to federal programs such as the Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly
the Food Stamp Program), public and private organ-
izations
have
developed
initiatives
to
address
affordability-related
barriers
to
healthy
eating.10–13
One
particularly
promising
approach
provides
produce-specific financial incentives by matching SNAP
funds spent at farmers markets and other participating
venues. A growing body of literature suggests that
SNAP incentive programs facilitate increased produce
purchase and consumption.14–17
One such SNAP incentive program is Double Up Food
Bucks (DUFB). Launched in 2009, DUFB is currently
accepted at more than 140 farmers markets/farm stands
and 22 grocery stores throughout Michigan. When a
customer uses SNAP benefits on any SNAP-eligible
purchases at a participating farmers market between June
1 and October 31, they receive a 1:1 incentive match, up to
$20 per visit, in DUFB that can be redeemed for locally
grown produce.18 During 2015, participating Michigan
markets reported $1,561,577 in combined SNAP sales
($861,308) and distributed DUFB ($700,269)a (E Trum-
bull, Fair Food Network, personal communication, 2016).
The first statewide SNAP incentive program implemented
with uniform design and central administration, the
DUFB model has now expanded to 19 states.18
Many SNAP-enrolled families, however, do not take
advantage of SNAP incentive programs such as DUFB, in
part owing to lack of program awareness and under-
standing.14,19,20 Little is known about how best to
increase program uptake. Health centers serving low-
income communities could be effective venues for out-
reach to eligible families. Prior studies have examined
health center efforts to screen for food insecurity and
provide referrals to community resources,21–25 as well as
the impact of establishing a health center–affiliated
farmers market on produce consumption among low-
income diabetics.26 However, there are no published
studies examining health center–based initiatives to
increase
uptake
of
SNAP
incentive
programs,
or
longer-term impacts of SNAP incentive programs on
overall dietary patterns.
To address these knowledge gaps, a longitudinal,
repeated-measures, quasi-experimental trial was con-
ducted evaluating a brief waiting room–based informa-
tional intervention promoting DUFB in a primary care
clinic serving a low-income community in Southeast
Michigan. It was hypothesized that a significant propor-
tion of the health center population would be SNAP
enrolled, and that baseline rates of DUFB utilization would
be low. It was further hypothesized that the intervention
would increase program use and produce consumption.
Specifically, the authors examined (1) self-reported rates of
DUFB use among SNAP-enrolled households and (2) self-
reported rates of FV consumption. All data were collected
at baseline, over the final 3 months of the DUFB market
season (August–October 2014), and 2 months following
the conclusion of the DUFB season.
METHODS
Study Sample
Recruitment for the study took place in the waiting room of an
academic outpatient family medicine and pediatrics practice
serving a low-income, racially and ethnically diverse community
in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Adults aged Z18 years, currently SNAP
enrolled, English or Spanish speaking, and self-identified as a
primary food shopper for their household were eligible for
participation. Eligibility was assessed through a baseline paper
survey distributed to all adults present in the waiting room. Those
who met eligibility criteria were invited to participate in the
longitudinal study. Participants unable to complete a telephone
survey in English or Spanish or to provide a working telephone
number were excluded. All participants provided verbal informed
consent for the initial eligibility screening survey. Eligible adults
who agreed to participate in the longitudinal study provided
written informed consent to receive three telephone surveys over a
5-month period. This study was approved by the University of
Michigan Medical School IRB.
Recruitment took place during August 2014, which was 2
months into the DUFB season, to better assess a baseline rate of
program use given standard program outreach. It was hypothe-
sized that by August, participants would have had ample oppor-
tunity to learn about and use DUFB prior to enrollment, but would
still have a full 3 months of potential DUFB use following the
intervention.
Eligibility screening surveys were primarily self-administered,
but research staff were available to assist participants preferring
verbal administration. Research staff distributed surveys daily for 4
weeks in staggered 6-hour time blocks. To capture as diverse a
sample as possible, recruitment blocks included morning, after-
noon, and evening clinic hours.
Several strategies were used to minimize loss to follow-up.
Strategies included (1) requesting multiple modes of contact,
including a second phone number, address, and e-mail; (2) use
aOf these transactions, $68,341 in SNAP and $57,999 in DUFB were
from eight farmers markets in Washtenaw County, all of which are 1–25
miles from the health center where the intervention was delivered.

 of the same research assistant and outgoing phone number for
each survey call; and (3) offering incentives for survey completion.
In the waiting room, study staff provided participants a brief
verbal explanation of DUFB including program eligibility require-
ments, where and how to use the program, and rules and
limitations. Participants were given print copies of branded DUFB
promotional materials, a map of eight local farmers markets
specifying locations and hours,b a list of frequently asked questions
about DUFB (Appendix, available online), and a one-time $10
voucher redeemable for FV to use at their first farmers market visit
as an additional financial incentive. Vouchers were not eligible for
DUFB match.
Follow-up semi-structured telephone surveys were conducted at
1.5 months; 3 months (end of the DUFB season); and 5 months
(2 months post–DUFB season), ending in January 2015. All study
participants received a $10 Visa gift card for each completed
telephone survey. Participants completing all surveys were entered
into a raffle for a $50 gift card.
Measures
The primary outcome measure was use of DUFB. Baseline rates of
DUFB use (ever) were assessed in the initial screening survey and
verbally confirmed at the time of enrollment. Self-reported DUFB
use (yes/no) and frequency within the prior month was assessed at
the 1.5- and 3-month follow-ups. At 5 months, a summary
question was asked assessing DUFB use and frequency over the
entire DUFB season. For those participants missing data for the
5-month summary question, missing values were replaced with
reported DUFB use (yes/no) at 1.5 and 3 months, if available.
Participants’ FV intake was also examined at baseline, 1.5
months, 3 months, and 5 months, with a validated two-item FV
instrument assessing the number of servings of fruits and of
vegetables usually consumed each day.27,28
Baseline measures included participant sociodemographic char-
acteristics, self-health assessment, food security status, federal food
assistance received, and self and others in household with diet-
related disease (Table 1).
Statistical Analysis
A goal was set of recruiting 150 participants for the longitudinal
portion of the study. Sample size was calculated to detect at least a
15% pre/post change in rates of DUFB use (0.9 power, α¼0.05),
with oversampling to accommodate 25% attrition at each survey
wave. Although the study was not prospectively powered to detect
a clinically meaningful change in FV consumption—defined as 0.5
servings/day, as this is both clinically significant and consistent
with other studies14,26,28—the final sample was larger than
anticipated, thereby improving power to detect change in this
outcome.
Standard descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables.
Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests were used to
assess differences in continuous and categorical characteristics,
respectively, between study participants and non-participants.
Multivariable clustered logistic regression models were used to
estimate DUFB use (dependent variable), with a two-level factor
time (baseline, 5 months) as the primary independent variable.
Clustering within subject was accounted for via a generalized
estimating equations approach. A Poisson regression model was
used to estimate predicted mean number of times participants who
were DUFB naïve at baseline used DUFB by the end of the season,
assuming a mean value for all covariates. A multivariable linear
mixed model was used to estimate FV consumption (dependent
variable), with a four-level categorical variable denoting time
(baseline and three follow-up waves) as the primary factor.
A random subject intercept was used to account for clustering
within individual participants. Models employed all-case analyses,
and were analyzed unadjusted as well as adjusted for the baseline
covariates: FV consumption, farmers market use within the last
year, DUFB use, gender, age, race/ethnicity, children aged o18
years in the household, at least one person in the household with
diet-related disease, and employment status. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted for each model using complete-case analyses and
were not found to substantively differ from models using all-case
analyses.
Interaction analyses were conducted (by including a multi-
plicative term in the linear mixed model) to assess if the
association between receipt of the intervention and change in FV
consumption was modified by baseline FV consumption. Finally,
multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the
association between change from baseline FV consumption at 3
and 5 months and the number of times participants reported using
DUFB, controlling for baseline DUFB use. Stata, version 13.1, was
used for all analyses, which were conducted in 2015–2016.
RESULTS
Of 702 adults, 673 (96%) who received baseline surveys
completed them, and almost half reported current SNAP
enrollment. Of the 302 SNAP-enrolled participants, 177
(59%) enrolled in the study (Figure 1). One hundred
forty-nine (84%) completed at least three surveys, and
127 (72%) completed all four surveys.
Participants largely identified as African American/
black (60%); female (85%); and having an annual house-
hold income o$15,000 (69%). Mean baseline FV con-
sumption was 3.63 (SD¼1.78) servings/day, consistent
with reported rates for similar low-income popula-
tions.27,28 Almost half of participants reported at least
one household member with hypertension (41%) and/or
obesity (45%), and one quarter reported at least one
household member with diabetes (Table 1). Differences
between eligible adults who enrolled versus those who
did not enroll are noted in Table 1.
At baseline, 56% of participants reported shopping at a
farmers market within the last year, consistent with
baseline rates of farmers market use in several other
low-income communities.20,26,29 Only 18% of study
participants,
however,
reported
prior
DUFB
use
(Table 1). By the end of the DUFB season, participants
were significantly more likely to report DUFB use than at
baseline in both unadjusted (OR¼9.2, 95% CI¼6.1, 13.8)
and adjusted (AOR¼19.2, 95% CI¼10.3, 35.5, po0.001)

 models (Appendix Table 1, available online), with 69% of
participants reporting use of DUFB at least once and 34%
reporting use of DUFB three or more times. Among the
82% of participants reporting no prior DUFB use at
baseline, 61% reported using DUFB at least once by the
end of the season, and 27% reported using DUFB three or
more times, with an adjusted predicted mean of 1.7 visits
by the end of the season (95% CI¼1.5, 2.0, po0.001).
Breakdown of DUFB use by follow-up period is pre-
sented in Appendix Table 2 (available online).
In the unadjusted model, FV consumption in the study
sample increased from baseline by 0.66 servings/day
(95% CI¼0.38, 0.93, po0.001) at 3 months and
remained increased at 5 months (0.63 servings/day
higher than baseline, 95% CI¼0.34, 0.92, po0.001).
After adjusting for covariates, FV consumption remained
increased at 3 and 5 months (0.65 servings/day, 95%
CI¼0.37, 0.93, po0.001 and 0.62 servings/day, 95%
CI¼0.32,
0.92,
po0.001,
respectively)
(Figure
2,
Appendix Table 3, available online).
There was a significant interaction between change in
FV consumption and baseline consumption (po0.001).
Participants with baseline FV consumption of 0–3
servings/day had a 0.89 servings/day increase at 1.5
months (95% CI¼0.56, 1.21, po0.001); 1.33 servings/
day
increase
at
3
months (95%
CI¼0.964,
1.70,
po0.001); and 1.25 servings/day increase at 5 months
(95% CI¼0.86, 1.63). Among those participants with a
baseline FV consumption of Z4 servings/day, there was
a 0.48 serving/day decrease in consumption at 1.5
months (95% CI¼ –0.84, –0.12, p¼0.010); but no
significant change at 3 or 5 months (Appendix Table 4,
available online).
Self-reported frequency of DUFB use over the course of
the study was also significantly associated with change from
baseline FV consumption over time (p¼0.002). Among
participants who used DUFB three or more times, FV
consumption increased by 1.04 servings/day from baseline
at 3 months (95% CI¼0.52, 1.55, po0.001) and remained
elevated at 5 months (1.16 servings/day above baseline, 95%
CI¼0.62, 1.69, po0.001). There were similar increases at 3
months among those participants reporting DUFB use one
to two times, although the magnitude of increase diminished
at 5 months. FV consumption was unchanged among
participants who did not use DUFB (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
A brief waiting room intervention in an urban primary
care center was associated with an almost fourfold
increase in reported use of DUFB over a 3-month
period. In addition, the intervention was associated
with a statistically and clinically significant increase of
approximately two-thirds of a serving/day of FVs. A
dose–response
relationship
was
observed
between
produce consumption and frequency of DUFB use,
although there appeared to be a ceiling effect with the
greatest increases in consumption among those with
lowest
(0–3
servings/day)
baseline
consumption.

 Increased consumption across the study population was
largely maintained 2 months after the DUFB season
ended, suggesting sustained behavior change even when
the financial incentive was no longer available.
This study builds on prior studies in several ways. Most
prior studies have examined the impact of SNAP incentive
use among individuals already shopping at a farmers
market.15,16,30 However, these individuals may not be
representative of the broader SNAP-enrolled population.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Healthy Incentive Pilot
Study is the only prior investigation of an incentive program
in a broad SNAP-enrolled population. In this study, a
random subsample of 7,500 SNAP households in one county
of Massachusetts received a $0.30 incentive for every dollar of
SNAP benefits spent on targeted FVs at participating
retailers.14 Although the study presented here was much
smaller in scale, in contrast to the Healthy Incentive Pilot, it
assessed the impact of an intervention on use of an existing
SNAP incentive program, rather than evaluating a newly
created program.
The intervention presented here was associated with
increases in FV consumption similar to those found in
the Healthy Incentive Pilot and other behavioral inter-
ventions targeting increased FV consumption.14,31,32
This study also had higher retention rates compared
with several prior longitudinal incentive interven-
tions,30,33–35 which may augment generalizability and
help mitigate potential selection bias.
The authors believe the intervention was likely suc-
cessful for several reasons. First, situating the interven-
tion
in
a
health
center
framed
information
and
messaging about the program in a health-oriented
setting. Second, this approach may have conveyed
implicit endorsement of the incentive program by the
health center and providers. Finally, by recruiting par-
ticipants and delivering the intervention in the clinic
waiting room, the intervention was able to capitalize on a
time when patients and family members were typically
unengaged and available for interaction with study staff.
Providing brief waiting room information to eligible
adults about healthy food incentive programs is a low-
cost, easily implemented intervention that may increase
produce purchase and consumption for a substantial
portion of patients. There are currently incentive pro-
grams in at least 40 states and the District of Colum-
bia.18,36 With $31.5 million in federal funding awarded in
2015 for the expansion and evaluation of SNAP incentive
programs through the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant Program, and
$100 million in funding committed by Fiscal Year 2018,37
there are now plans for incentive programs in almost
every state.18,36 With this geographic spread, interven-
tions to increase incentive use will become only more
relevant.
Given recent renewed recognition of the importance
of identifying and addressing food insecurity and other
material hardship among low-income patients, several
professional societies and national guidelines have
called for the incorporation of food insecurity screening
into clinical care.38–40 Several recent studies have
described promising clinical–community partnerships
to address food insecurity.21,23–25 Interventions such
as the one presented here that educate and connect
eligible low-income patients to existing resources can
serve as a valuable component of clinic to community
integration.
Several areas for future research include exploration of
the mechanisms through which the intervention was
associated with increased DUFB use, and the relative
importance of each of the constituent parts (e.g., infor-
mation, $10 voucher, clinic-based setting). A better
understanding of how specific aspects of the intervention
may have facilitated increased consumption can help
focus future clinic-based initiatives. Additionally, more
rigorous evaluation incorporating a comparison group is
merited to confirm reproducibility of results. Research is
also warranted to better understand barriers to SNAP
incentive use and how communities can best address
these barriers in order to maximize program impact.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the study took
place at a single health center, potentially limiting
generalizability. The health center does, however, serve

 a low-income, racially and ethnically diverse population,
and indicators measured such as baseline FV consump-
tion were consistent with rates reported in the literature
for similarly diverse low-income communities. Second,
although a strength of the study was the ability to collect
descriptive data on both participants and eligible non-
participants, findings may be susceptible to selection bias
because those more familiar with or interested in going to
farmers markets or using DUFB may have been more
likely to participate in the study. Relative to non-
participants, participants were also more likely to be
poorer, slightly older, more food insecure, and report a
higher rate of diet-related disease.
Third, absent a control group, a causal relationship
cannot be established between the intervention and
either use of DUFB or increases in produce consumption.
There may have been confounding factors influencing
DUFB use that could not be measured, and those
participants who used DUFB may have been predisposed
to increase their FV consumption for reasons other than
the intervention. Increases in FV consumption may also
have been influenced by purchases made at non-farmers
market venues. Although baseline rates of DUFB (18%)
were measured at the height of the farmers market
season, it is possible that some participants would have
used the program even without the intervention. Con-
versely, because there were only 3 months remaining in
the DUFB season at the time of recruitment, the potential
season-long impact of the intervention may have been
underestimated. There may have also been a seasonal
component to participants’ increased FV consumption,
although increases in reported consumption were main-
tained at the January follow-up. Additionally, in analyses
examining consumption by frequency of DUFB use,
there was no change in consumption over time among
DUFB non-users, indicating that consumption was not
simply higher for all participants during periods when
more FVs were in season.
Fourth, measures of DUFB and FV consumption were
based on self-report, which may limit the validity and
reliability of results, and is subject to recall bias. However,
the study employed repeated measures using an instru-
ment for FV consumption validated in a low-income
population.27,28 Furthermore, as the study used repeated
measures, the findings should be robust to within-person
changes.
Finally, use of follow-up phone calls over 5 months to
ascertain information on DUFB use and produce con-
sumption may have prompted some participants to
increase the behaviors being studied. Additionally,
reported increases in DUFB use may have been affected
by learned response or social acceptability bias. To the
extent there was a “Hawthorne effect,” this intervention
might have been less effective if not paired with recurring
assessments.
CONCLUSIONS
A brief waiting room–based intervention was associated
with increased use of a SNAP incentive program and
participant FV consumption over a 5-month period. This
study highlights opportunities for clinics to support
healthy behavior change by promoting linkages with
relevant community resources. If taken to scale, bridging
historical silos between clinical care and community-
based social services may pay dividends in improved
population health.
