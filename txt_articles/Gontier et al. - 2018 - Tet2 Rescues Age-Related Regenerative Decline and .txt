SUMMARY
Restoring adult stem cell function provides an
exciting approach for rejuvenating the aging brain.
However, molecular mechanisms mediating neuro-
genic rejuvenation remain elusive. Here we report
that the enzyme ten eleven translocation methylcy-
tosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), which catalyzes the
production
of
5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC),
rescues age-related decline in adult neurogenesis
and enhances cognition in mice. We detected a
decrease in Tet2 expression and 5hmC levels in
the aged hippocampus associated with adult neu-
rogenesis. Mimicking an aged condition in young
adults
by
abrogating
Tet2
expression
within
the hippocampal neurogenic niche, or adult neural
stem cells, decreased neurogenesis and impaired
learning and memory. In a heterochronic parabiosis
rejuvenation
model,
hippocampal
Tet2
expres-
sion was restored. Overexpressing Tet2 in the hip-
pocampal
neurogenic
niche
of
mature
adults
increased 5hmC associated with neurogenic pro-
cesses, offset the precipitous age-related decline
in neurogenesis, and enhanced learning and mem-
ory. Our data identify Tet2 as a key molecular medi-
ator of neurogenic rejuvenation.
INTRODUCTION
During aging, the number of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs),
and subsequently neurogenesis, precipitously declines in the
subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus
(Fan et al., 2017). Mounting evidence in animal models indicates
the potential for rejuvenation of regenerative and cognitive func-
tions in the aging brain through interventions, such as hetero-
chronic parabiosis (which exposes aged animals to young blood)
(Fan et al., 2017; Katsimpardi et al., 2014; Villeda et al., 2011).
However, the ability to utilize this neurogenic potential is predi-
cated on identifying molecular targets that reverse the effects
of aging in the brain.
Recent studies have begun to link changes in the functions of
epigenetic mediators, such as those necessary for covalent
DNA modifications, to age-related regenerative decline (Beer-
man and Rossi, 2015; Brunet and Rando, 2017). Interestingly
ten eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2),
which catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is emerging as a potential
epigenetic regulator of aging (Burgess, 2015). Human genetic
studies identified an increased frequency of somatic TET2
mutations with age that are associated with elevated risk for
aging-associated disorders, such as cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and stroke (Burgess, 2015; Jaiswal et al., 2014; Na-
darajah et al., 2015). Notwithstanding, the involvement of
Tet2 in mediating the aging process in the adult brain has yet
to be investigated. While Tet proteins and 5hmC are highly ex-
pressed in the brain (Hahn et al., 2013; Kriaucionis and Heintz,
2009; Szulwach et al., 2011), with Tet1 and Tet3 implicated in
proper brain function (Kaas et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Rudenko
et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013), the role of Tet2 remains rela-
tively unexplored.
Here we demonstrate that Tet2 offsets age-related neurogenic
decline and enhances cognition in the hippocampus of adult
mice. We detect an age-dependent decrease in the levels of
Tet2 and 5hmC in the aging hippocampus coincident with
decreased adult neurogenesis. Mimicking an age-related loss
of Tet2 in the adult neurogenic niche of the hippocampus, or
adult NPCs, impairs regenerative capacity and associated
hippocampal-dependent
learning
and
memory
processes.
Conversely, increasing Tet2 in the hippocampus of mature ani-
mals increases 5hmC associated with neurogenic processes, re-
stores adult neurogenesis to youthful levels, and enhances
cognitive function. These findings indicate that Tet2-mediated
hydroxymethylation regulates age-related regenerative decline
in the aging hippocampus, with functional implications for neuro-
genic rejuvenation.

 RESULTS
Tet2 and 5hmC Levels Decrease in the Aged
Hippocampus and Are Associated with Neurogenic
Processes
We characterized changes in the levels of Tet2 mRNA in the hip-
pocampus and cortex of normal young and aged animals by
qPCR, and we detected an age-related decrease in Tet2 expres-
sion within the aged hippocampus (Figures 1A and 1B). We
examined changes in hippocampal 5hmC and 5mC levels by
slot blot and immunohistochemical analysis, and we observed
an age-related decrease in 5hmC (Figures 1C and 1D), but not
5mC (Figures S1A and S1B). To gain mechanistic insight into
which genomic loci were affected by these changes, we per-
formed antibody-based 5hmC immunoprecipitation combined
with deep sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) in the young and aged hip-
pocampus (Figures 1E and 1F; Figures S1C–S1H). We charac-
terized
differentially
5-hydroxymethylated
regions
(DhMRs)
(Feng et al., 2012), and we identified 345 DhMRs lost, while de-
tecting none gained, with age (Figure 1E; Table S1). Lost DhMRs
were enriched in intragenic regions, in the aged compared to
young hippocampus (Figure 1E), and we observed DhMR-asso-
ciated genes were involved in neurogenic processes by gene
ontology analysis (Figure 1F).
To further investigate the relationship between age-related
changes in Tet2 expression and adult neurogenesis, we
compared the temporal kinetics of decreased adult neurogen-
esis and Tet2 expression with age (Figures 1G–1I; Figure S1I).
Adult neurogenesis and Tet2 expression were quantified in
contralateral hippocampi of the same animals by immunohisto-
chemical analysis and qPCR, respectively. We observed a
precipitous decline in adult neurogenesis by 6 months of age
in mature adults (Figures 1H and 1I; Figure S1I) that was
paralleled by a sharp decrease in Tet2 expression (Figure 1G;
Figure S1I). Altogether, these data raise the possibility that
decreased Tet2 and 5hmC levels in the aging hippocampus
are
associated
with
age-related
impairments
in
adult
neurogenesis.
Reducing Tet2 in the Young Adult Hippocampus Impairs
Neurogenesis
We next asked whether mimicking an age-related decline in Tet2
within the young adult hippocampus would impair neurogenesis.
We first abrogated Tet2 expression in the young adult hippocam-
pus utilizing an in vivo viral-mediated RNAi approach (Figure 2A).
Young adult animals were stereotaxically injected with high-titer
lentivirus
(LV)
encoding
Tet2
or
scramble
control
small
hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences into the DG of contralateral
hippocampi, and Tet2 abrogation was confirmed in vivo (Figures
S2A–S2C). No changes in Tet1 or Tet3 were detected (Fig-
ure S2D). Subsequently, we analyzed NPC function and matura-
tion in an independent cohort of young adult animals by immuno-
histochemical analysis. Abrogation of Tet2 in the DG resulted
in a significant decrease in the number of Sox2/GFAP-
positive NPCs, Doublecortin (Dcx)-positive newly born neurons,
Bromodeoxyuridne (BrdU)-positive cells, and BrdU/NeuN-posi-
tive mature differentiated neurons compared with the control
contralateral DG (Figure 2B).
To gain mechanistic insight at a cellular level, we generated
Tet2floxf/lox mice carrying an inducible NestinCre-ERT2 gene, in
which Tet2 is excised specifically in adult NPCs (Tet2�/�) upon
tamoxifen administration (Figure 2C; Figure S2E). We examined
changes in neurogenesis in young adult Tet2�/� and littermate
control (Tet2floxf/lox) mice by immunohistochemical analysis.
The absence of Tet2 expression in adult NPCs resulted in a selec-
tive decrease in the number of Dcx-positive newly born neurons,
BrdU-positive cells, and BrdU/NeuN-positive mature differenti-
ated neurons in Tet2�/� mice compared to Tet2flox/flox controls,
without altering the number of Nestin-positive NPCs (Figure 2D).
This decrease in newly born and mature neurons is consistent
withincreasedlevelsof5hmCuponneuronaldifferentiationinvivo
(Figure S2F). Collectively, our in vivo RNAi and genetic data sug-
gest an involvement of Tet2 in regulating adult neurogenesis at
both the levels of the neurogenic niche and adult NPCs.
Reducing Tet2 in the Young Adult Hippocampus Impairs
Cognitive Function
To investigate whether decreased Tet2 in the young adult DG, or
loss of Tet2 in adult NPCs, impaired cognitive processes, hippo-
campal-dependent learning and memory were assessed using
radial arm water maze (RAWM) and contextual fear-conditioning
paradigms (Figure 3A). To test the effect of decreased Tet2 in
the adult DG, young adult animals were given bilateral stereotaxic
injections into the hippocampi of high-titer LV encoding Tet2
shRNA or scramble control sequences (Figure 3B). To test the ef-
fect of selective loss of Tet2 in adult NPCs, we utilized young adult
NPC Tet2�/� and littermate control Tet2flox/flox mice (Figure 3E). All
mice showed similar learning capacity during the training phase of
the RAWM (Figures 3D and 3G). Abrogation of Tet2 in the adult DG
resulted in significantly more errors in locating the target platform
during both short-term (Figure 3D;Figure S3B) andlong-term(Fig-
ure 3D; Figure S3C) learning and memory testing compared to
control conditions. Interestingly, selective loss of Tet2 in adult
NPCs resulted in impairments only during long-term learning
and memory testing compared to control mice (Figure 3G; Figures
S3E and S3F). During fear conditioning training, mice exhibited no
differences in baseline freezing time (Figures S3A and S3D). How-
ever, both abrogation of Tet2 in the adult DG and loss of Tet2 in
adult NPCs resulted in decreased freezing time during contextual
(Figures 3C and 3F), but not cued (Figures S3A and S3D), memory
testing. These data demonstrate that decreased Tet2 in the adult
neurogenic niche, oradult NPCs,impairs long-termhippocampal-
dependent spatial learning and memory and associative fear
memory acquisition.
Decreased Tet2 in the Aged Hippocampus Is Reversed in
a Heterochronic Parabiosis Model of Brain Rejuvenation
Thus far, at a cellular level, our findings indicate that mimicking
an age-related decline in Tet2 impairs adult neurogenesis. How-
ever, it remains an open question whether restoring Tet2 in the
adult
brain
can
rescue
age-related
regenerative
decline.
Using a model of heterochronic parabiosis, we and others
have demonstrated that rejuvenation of adult neurogenesis is
possible in the aged brain (Katsimpardi et al., 2014; Villeda
et al., 2011). To gain insight into the potential involvement of
Tet2 in neurogenic rejuvenation, we measured mRNA levels of
Cell Reports 22, 1974–1981, February 20, 2018
1975
 Tet2 in the aged hippocampus after heterochronic parabiosis.
We detected an increase of Tet2 in heterochronic parabionts
after exposure to young blood compared to age-matched
isochronic parabionts exposed to old blood (Figure 4A). No
changes in Tet1 or Tet3 were observed (Figure S7A). These
data implicate Tet2 in conditions of brain rejuvenation.
Restoring Tet2 in the Mature Adult Hippocampus
Rescues Age-Related Regenerative Decline
To investigate whether restoring Tet2 in the adult hippocampal
neurogenic
niche
could
counteract
age-related
regener-
ative decline, we utilized an in vivo viral-mediated overexpres-
sion approach. Aging analysis demonstrated a concomitant

 age-related decrease in adult neurogenesis and Tet2 expression
in mature adult animals at 6 months of age (Figures 1G–1I).
Correspondingly, mature adult animals at this age were stereo-
taxically injected with high-titer LV encoding Tet2 or control
into the DG of contralateral hippocampi, and Tet2 overexpres-
sion was confirmed in vivo (Figure 4B; Figure S4B). No changes
in Tet1 or Tet3 were detected (Figure S4C).
We performed hMeDIP-seq in the mature adult hippocampi
following viral-mediated Tet2 overexpression (Figures 4C–4E;
Figures S4D–S4H), and we found 558 DhMRs gained and 110
lost after Tet2 overexpression (Figure 4D; Table S2). We
observed gained DhMRs enriched in intragenic regions (Fig-
ure 4D), and we identified associated neurogenic processes by
gene ontology analysis (Figure 4E). We compared genes whose
DhMRs were lost during aging with those gained by Tet2 overex-
pression, and we detected 39 overlapping genes (Table S3), of
which 10 are involved in neurogenesis (Figure 4F).
Next, we examined whether restoring Tet2 was sufficient to
rescue age-related decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis
by immunohistochemical analysis. We observed that increasing
Tet2 in the mature adult DG resulted in a significant enhance-
ment in the number of Sox2/GFAP-positive NPCs, Dcx-positive
newly born neurons, BrdU-positive cells, and BrdU/NeuN-posi-
tive mature differentiated neurons in the DG compared with the
control contralateral DG (Figure 4G). Excitingly, levels of adult
neurogenesis achieved in the mature adult hippocampus by
increased Tet2 mirrored levels normally observed in the young
adult hippocampus (Figure 4G). We overexpressed Tet2 in the
DG of young adult animals at 3 months of age, and we detected
no changes in adult neurogenesis (Figure S4J). Our data indicate
an age-dependent role for Tet2 in regulating regenerative decline
in the aging brain.
Restoring Tet2 in the Mature Adult Hippocampus
Enhances Cognitive Function
We next investigated the functional consequence of increasing
Tet2 in the mature adult DG on cognition. Hippocampal-depen-
dent learning and memory were assessed using RAWM and
contextual fear-conditioning paradigms. Mature adult animals
were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer LV encod-
ing Tet2 or control into the DG of the hippocampus (Figure 4H;
Figures S4K and S4L). All mice showed similar learning capacity
during the training phase of the RAWM (Figure 4J), and no

6 days and euthanized 30 days later. Neurogenesis was analyzed by immu-

 differences were detected in locating the target platform during
short-term (Figure 4J; Figure S4N) and long-term (Figure 4J; Fig-
ure S4N) learning and memory testing. During fear conditioning
training, mice exhibited no differences in baseline freezing time
(Figure S4M). However, increased Tet2 expression in the mature
adult DG resulted in increased freezing time during contextual
(Figure 4I), but not cued (Figure S4M), memory testing. These
data indicate that restoring Tet2 in the mature adult neuro-
genic niche is sufficient to enhance associative fear memory
acquisition.
DISCUSSION
Cumulatively, our data indicate that age-related loss of Tet2
leads to decreased adult neurogenesis, with functional implica-
tions for cognitive impairment. Our in vivo RNAi and genetic
data dissect the involvement of Tet2 in regulating adult neuro-
genesis at the level of the neurogenic niche and adult NPCs,
pointing to complementary cell-autonomous and non-autono-
mous roles for Tet2 in regulating NPC function versus neuronal
differentiation
processes.
Moreover,
we
demonstrate
that
increasing Tet2 in the hippocampus is sufficient to rescue the
precipitous age-related regenerative decline observed in the
mature adult brain and enhance associated cognitive processes.
Ultimately, our data suggest that restoring Tet2 in the aging brain
can promote rejuvenation.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that constitutive whole-
body loss of Tet2 yields opposing effects on neurogenic pro-
cesses, resulting in increased adult NPC proliferation but
decreased neuronal differentiation (Li et al., 2017). In contrast,
our data indicate that decreasing Tet2 expression acutely in
the adult neurogenic niche impairs all stages of hippocampal
neurogenesis, while loss of Tet2 in adult NPCs impairs
neuronal differentiation processes. These data point to differ-
ential regulation of distinct stages of neurogenesis by Tet2
that arise from the loss of Tet2 at the level of the whole organ-
ism, neurogenic niche, and adult NSC during development
versus adult ages. In the context of aging, our data implicate
decreased Tet2 in the aging hippocampus with age-related
regenerative decline.
While a causal link between age-related decreased neuro-
genesis and cognitive decline remains obfuscated (Drapeau
et al., 2003; Merrill et al., 2003; Seib et al., 2013; Smith et al.,

 2015), decreasing Tet2 within the young adult hippocampus, or
loss of Tet2 in adult NPCs, resulted in cognitive impairments.
Interestingly, impairments in short-term spatial learning and
memory that are not typically associated with changes in adult
neurogenesis were observed after Tet2 abrogation in the adult
hippocampus, but not in adult NPCs, beginning to delineate
complementary roles for Tet2 in regulating neurogenesis-
dependent versus -independent cognitive functions. Collec-
tively, our behavioral data identify a unique role for Tet2 in
cognitive function distinct from other Tet family members,
with previous studies implicating Tet1 and Tet3 in memory
extinction but finding no role in long-term memory acquisition
(Kaas et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Rudenko et al., 2013; Zhang
et al., 2013).
Outside of the brain, aging-associated regenerative decline is
also attributed to age-related dysfunction in tissue-specific adult
stem cells throughout the body. Therefore, improving adult stem
cell function provides an exciting approach for broadly rejuve-
nating regenerative capacity (Fan et al., 2017; Beerman and
Rossi, 2015; Brunet and Rando, 2017). Mounting evidence indi-
cates that interventions eliciting neurogenic rejuvenation (Kat-
simpardi et al., 2014; Villeda et al., 2011) concomitantly promote
rejuvenation in peripheral tissues (Baht et al., 2015; Conboy
et al., 2005; Sinha et al., 2014). Thus, our data raise the exciting
possibility that rejuvenation of regenerative capacity could be
promoted across tissues by targeting epigenetic regulators
associated with the aging process. Moreover, the activities of
several chromatin regulators are regulated by metabolites,
notably Tet enzymes by vitamin C (Blaschke et al., 2013; Cim-
mino et al., 2017), raising the possibility that non-invasive
metabolic interventions may further contribute to promoting
epigenetic-mediated rejuvenation.

(F) Venn diagram representing the overlap of genes paired with DhMRs from those lost during aging (3 months over 18 months) and those gained from Tet2
overexpression (OE over control). From the overlap, genes associated with neurogenesis using gene ontology are shown, and mRNA expression in hippocampal
lysates was measured by qPCR (n = 5 per group; t test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).
(G) Neurogenesis was analyzed by immunostaining and confocal microscopy in mature adult (6-month-old) animals after LV administration. As a reference, young
adult (3-month-old) mice were given unilateral STX injections of control LV. All mice were administered BrdU by intraperitoneal injections for 6 days and
euthanized 30 days later. Representative field and quantification of GFAP/Sox2-positive, Dcx-positive, BrdU-positive, and NeuN/BrdU-positive cells are shown
(n = 5 per group; scale bar, 100 mm; t test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).
(H) Schematic of experimental paradigm and cognitive testing timeline. Mature adult (6-month-old) wild-type mice were given bilateral stereotaxic (STX) injections
of lentivirus (LV) encoding Tet2 or control LV into the dentate gyrus (DG).
(I) Associative fear memory was assessed using contextual fear conditioning. Quantification of percentage freezing 24 hr after training is shown (n = 12–15 per
group; t test, ***p < 0.001).
(J) Hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory was assessed using RAWM. Quantification of the number of entry errors during RAWM training and
testing is shown (n = 6–9 per group; repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc correction).
Data are represented as mean ± SEM. See also Figure S4.
