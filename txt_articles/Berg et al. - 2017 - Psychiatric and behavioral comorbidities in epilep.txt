SUMMARY
Psychiatric and behavioral disorders are important aspects of epilepsy and have
received increasing attention in the last several years. The literature upon which
most of the field relies contains some biases that must be carefully examined and
resolved in future studies. First, in the pediatric epilepsy literature, many reports
find that children with epilepsy have high levels of behavioral and psychiatric dis-
orders when compared to appropriate controls. Most of these studies rely on par-
ent-proxy completed instruments to assess these behavioral endpoints. Parents’
reports are not objective but reflect parents’ reactions and emotions. Increasing
evidence suggests inherent biases in proxy reports and highlights the need to
assess children directly. Second, periictal phenomena may be mischaracterized as
underlying mood disorders. Third, many studies report elevated levels of psychi-
atric morbidity before and after the diagnosis of epilepsy, suggesting an inherent
relation between the two types of disorders. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures,
while widely recognized as posing a diagnostic dilemma in the clinic, may account
for some of these research findings. Diagnostic errors between epilepsy and psy-
chogenic nonepileptic seizures need careful consideration when evaluating studies
demonstrating associations between psychiatric disorders and epilepsy or poorer
seizure control in association with psychiatric disorders in people who have epi-
lepsy. Mental health concerns are important for everyone. An accurate, undis-
torted understanding of the relation between mental health disorders and epilepsy
is essential to ensure appropriate therapy and to avoid unnecessary and poten-
tially harmful treatments and common misconceptions.
KEY WORDS: Diagnostic errors, Mood disorders, Proxy report, Psychogenic

The interest in and awareness of various behavioral
and psychiatric difficulties in association with epilepsy
has waxed and waned over the last 150 years. Gowers
(1881) recognized that the cognitive and behavior disor-
ders are common interictally and result from combina-
tions
of
the
underlying
disorder,
medications,
and
seizures. In the 1930s, Lennox commented that “Many
persons subject to ordinary grand mal or petit mal
seizures also have disturbances in mood or behavior . . .
which
may
only
be
a
result
of
difficult
circum-
stances . . ..”1 Livingston echoed this 30 year later: “The
most serious hazard of an epileptic disorder is frequently
not the seizures, but the associated emotional disturbances
which are prone to develop in a youngster as a result of
mismanagement by his family, by his classmates and
friends and by society.”2 Although clinicians such as Gas-
taut (1955) and Geschwind (1975) recognized biologic
factors contributing to a diverse set of psychiatric disor-
ders and behavioral changes, the difficulties associated
with epilepsy, however, were still largely attributed to
factors outside the patient.

CRITICAL REVIEW AND INVITED COMMENTARY
 The Bidirectional Hypothesis
Beginning around 2000, studies started to raise other
explanations. Specifically, investigators began reporting that
psychiatric disorders and behavioral problems were already
present at or near the time when people were first diagnosed
with epilepsy, and suggested that these disorders predated
the onset of seizures.3–7 Other studies demonstrated higher
rates of psychiatric diagnoses both before and after the diag-
nosis of epilepsy.8–10 This has been termed the “bidirec-
tional”
association
between
epilepsy
and
psychiatric
comorbidity,11,12 and was recently employed in reference to
autism spectrum and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-
ders.13 In all, the repeated findings that psychiatric diagnoses
and behavioral problems predated the onset of epilepsy sug-
gested that the psychiatric and behavioral disorders were not
simply caused by reactions to epilepsy and its consequences
but might, in some patients, actually be related to expression
of the same underlying pathophysiology that is involved in
the seizures (epilepsy) themselves. Much research has since
been devoted to demonstrating this association in different
populations. The notion of psychiatric and behavioral disor-
ders as part of the spectrum of the expression of epilepsy has
become generally accepted.12,14–18
In theory, a disorder or associated dysregulation that
drives a brain to have seizures could also affect other
aspects of brain function including behavior and mood.19
This is because some epilepsies implicate common net-
works involved in the expression and regulation of mood.
For instance, frontotemporal dysfunction has been impli-
cated in mood and anxiety disorders,20,21 including suicide-
related behavior and posttraumatic stress disorder.22,23 It is
likely that seizure foci in frontal or temporal regions as well
as white matter changes affecting functions in or between
those regions could disrupt those pathways. The epilepsies,
however, are a diverse set of disorders, and studies should
reflect the different specific diseases that are grouped
together as epilepsy.
A Critical Look at the
Bidirectional Hypothesis
A more nuanced approach to the now-accepted relation-
ship between epilepsy and its psychiatric “comorbidities” is
required in light of at least three considerations: (1) the
source of information and specifically the reliance on par-
ent-proxy reports when making behavioral assessments,
especially in children; (2) the occurrence in some patients of
periictal mood and anxiety symptoms, which can compli-
cate the assessment of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms
and disorders; and (3) the role of psychogenic nonepileptic
seizures (PNES) and misdiagnosis of epilepsy in general in
muddying the data.
Reliance on proxy reports
In children, parent-proxy reports are often used to
assess behavior and make inferences about psychiatric
disorders.4,5,24–26 These studies all tend to demonstrate a
greater burden of such disorders or symptoms of these
disorders in children with epilepsy compared to sib-
ling,4,25 cousin,6,26 or other types of controls.5,27,28 Austin
et al. used the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a well-
known and well-respected instrument for assessing current
behavioral problems. Although this instrument is not diag-
nostic and reflects only recent behavior, it is convenient
to use and useful for tracking behavior over time. The
CBCL reports total, internalizing, and externalizing prob-
lem scores. Internalizing problems are mood disorders
(anxiety and depression predominantly). Externalizing dis-
orders reflect disruptive behaviors (aggression and rule-
breaking behaviors). The study reported that parents rated
their case children as having higher levels of internalizing
disorders relative to control siblings.4 Externalizing disor-
ders were not elevated in the cases relative to sibling con-
trols, however. Almane reported substantial differences
between children with epilepsy and cousin controls on
every CBCL scale, with all findings indicating greater
behavioral problems and poorer social competence in the
case children.26 The Dutch group followed a small cohort
of children with epilepsy and a group of controls, and
documented higher (worse) behavioral problem scores in
children with epilepsy than in controls. For individual
children, however, the scores varied substantially from
one time point to another.
Mood disorders in children
Assessment of mood disorders in children through par-
ent-proxy report is complicated by many factors. First,
mood disorders may aggregate in families. To the extent
that they do, children whose parents have mood disorders
may be at heightened risk of mood disorders them-
selves.29,30 Being at risk, however, is not the same as having
a mood disorder. In an analysis of cross-informant compar-
isons, proxy reports by depressed mothers of their children’s
Key Points
• Biases in the current literature must be addressed to
provide an accurate understanding of epilepsy-beha-
vioral disorder associations
• Parent-proxy report of children’s behavior is biased by
parental perceptions and reactions to illness
• Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures misdiagnosed as
epilepsy may induce errors in the assessment of psy-
chiatric disorders and epilepsy
• Periictal phenomenon can be misinterpreted as under-
lying mood disorders
• These errors can lead to undertreatment and overtreat-
ment and misconceptions that may cause further prob-
lems for individuals with epilepsy

 psychopathology were higher than ratings of the same chil-
dren performed by teachers and therapists who evaluated
the children. This phenomenon of maternal depression
being associated with worse parent-proxy reports of child
behavior,
is
termed
the
“depression
distortion
hypothesis.”31
Second, even in the absence of psychopathology, parental
reports may be influenced by factors other than the child
him or herself. Canadian investigators found that, in chil-
dren with newly diagnosed epilepsy, parental stress trans-
lated into more negative parent-proxy assessment of the
child’s quality of life.32 Although this is not the same as
behavior, this study still demonstrates how proxy assess-
ments are contaminated by factors that can systematically
distort assessments of subjective outcomes.
Proxy vs. self-report
Recently, Eom compared case–control differences in
behavior based on parent-proxy report and self-report in
young people with epilepsy and healthy sibling controls.33
Like other reports that utilized parent-proxy measures, cases
(younger than18 years) had substantially higher levels of
behavioral problems than controls across all parent-reported
CBCL scales. When adjustment was made for a measure of
parental emotional impact (impact associated with the child
him or herself), the case–control differences reported by the
parents all but disappeared. Furthermore, when cases and
controls were compared based on self-reported measures
either as older adolescents or as young adults, there was no
evidence of greater behavioral burden in the epilepsy versus
control group. The study strongly suggested that parental
emotional factors seeped into the parental assessment of
children’s behavior and differentially affected assessments
of cases and sibling controls. Parental stress and other fac-
tors may explain the substantial differences seen in the
impact of epilepsy on children based on child self-report
versus parent proxy report for quality of life34,35 and felt
stigma.36
Related to the above, the child psychiatry literature, in
general, reveals considerable differences between child
self-report and parent-proxy reports of behavior,37–43 Criti-
cal to interpreting parental reports in children with and with-
out a disorder such as epilepsy are the systematic biases in
parental report that have been documented. In general (non-
clinical) samples, parents are not especially sensitive to
internalizing (mood) symptoms and disorders reported by
children themselves,41 thus reports for “control” children
would be expected to underestimate levels of mood (inter-
nalizing) problems. In addition, in clinical studies of chil-
dren with epilepsy, family factors and parent reactions have
a large impact on the parents’ assessments of their
children.32,44,45 This likely leads to higher levels of parent-
reported mood and related problems in children with
epilepsy. These systematic biases (underascertainment in
controls and overascertainment in cases) may be influencing
our understanding of psychiatric-behavioral problems asso-
ciated with childhood epilepsy.
Child-self report is an important perspective to obtain,
yet, in the field of epilepsy, few studies have gathered
information directly from children.6,28 Two studies in
school-aged children used the Kiddie Schedule for Affec-
tive Disorders (K-SADS) and found a strong association
between epilepsy and mood disorders. In the first instance,
a subsequent extension of the study reported only on the
parent-proxy
assessments
of
children
(based
on
the
CBCL).26 It is unclear how the children themselves
responded or how their responses correlate with their par-
ents’ assessments. In the second study, children had incom-
pletely controlled seizures (all had to have one or more
seizures in the past year, and >90% were on therapy) and
long-standing epilepsy (average duration 4.7 years). Con-
trols were screened for neurologic, psychiatric, hearing,
and language disorders and excluded if they had symptoms
of these disorders. Thus the control group was constructed
such that children with the disorders of interest were lar-
gely excluded. Consequently, neither study provides strong
evidence for a higher level than expected of mood disor-
ders in children with epilepsy.
Baldin compared levels of lifetime and current mood
disorders and history of suicidal ideations and attempts in
young adult cases prospectively followed since the onset of
epilepsy in childhood and compared their responses to
those of their sibling controls as well as to a population-
based sample of controls.46 The self-reported Diagnostic
Interview Schedule (DIS) was used for these purposes. No
evidence of increased current or lifetime psychiatric diffi-
culties was found in cases compared to either control
group. The subjects were studied approximately 15 years
after the onset of epilepsy, and most were seizure-free and
off medication at the time of assessment. If there were a
comorbid association between childhood epilepsy and
mood disorders, one would expect at the very least to see a
higher prevalence of lifetime disorders, but that was not
the case.
In all, these findings indicate that caution must be
exercised when drawing conclusions about behavioral and
psychiatric problems in children with epilepsy based on
parent-proxy reports.
Periictal psychiatric symptoms
Preictal and postictal behavioral changes occur in many
patients with temporal lobe and other forms of epilepsy.
Affective auras (e.g., anxiety, fear, pleasure) occur in
10–15% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy47; the
mechanisms underlying these episodic symptoms remain
poorly understood. Preictal changes may result from envi-
ronmental (e.g., sleep deprivation, missed medication, alco-
hol) or physiologic (e.g., premenstrual) factors that increase
seizure
susceptibility.
Alternatively,
these
behavioral
changes could result from neurochemical (e.g., altered

Psychiatric and Behavioral Comorbidities
 neurotransmitter)
or
neurophysiologic
changes
(e.g.,
hormonal fluctuations, progressive alteration of seizure
threshold, active inhibition, postictal depression or disinhi-
bition).48 Limited evidence from patients with motor sei-
zures demonstrates cortical excitability changes within the
seizure-onset zone during the 24 h before (increased) and
24 h after (decreased) a seizure.49 The implications in terms
of impact on the functions subserved by these regions is
unclear; however, the findings suggest a neurophysiologic
basis for periictal changes that could affect other regions of
the brain involved in seizures.
Before a seizure
Premonitory symptoms, defined as occurring at least
30 min before a seizure, were reported by 29% of patients
with focal epilepsy50 and occur less frequently among
patients with generalized epilepsies.51 The premonitory
symptoms were continuous and lasted up to 3 days. The
most
frequently
reported
symptoms
were
irritability,
depression, headache, “funny feeling,” and confusion.
Another study identified insidious-onset prodromal symp-
toms in 39% of patients; behavioral, mood, and cognitive
changes were most frequent. However, when selected
patients with stereotypic prodromal symptoms used a per-
sonal digital device to report these symptoms, there was no
relation between prodromal symptom and seizure occur-
rence.52 This finding emphasizes the limits of self- or
proxy-report for symptoms that occur around the time of
seizures, since (1) a common human bias is finding causal
patterns in chance occurrences,53 and (2) memory is often
impaired periictally, thereby limiting the validity of self-
reports.
After a seizure
Diverse cognitive and
behavioral symptoms
occur
postictally, with dysphoric symptoms occurring within
24–72 h after seizures in >50% of patients.54 Postictal
psychosis may affect up to 2–6% of people with some
epilepsies,55 often following a cluster of dyscognitive or
tonic–clonic seizures. Unlike other postictal behavioral
symptoms that typically resolve within hours or days,
postictal psychosis can last up to 3 months (mean dura-
tion, 9–10 days).56 The few studies that examined postictal
mood used symptom checklists.54,57 Although reporting
several mood and anxiety related symptoms postictally
does not meet clinical criteria for a mood or anxiety disor-
der, patients with a history of depressive or anxiety disor-
ders were associated with worse postictal symptoms.54
These studies are conducted in the setting of the epilepsy
monitoring unit (EMU), where patients are participating in
presurgical workup. People with seizures emerging from
temporal lobe regions and neighboring structures were
significantly more likely to describe postictal dysphoric
symptoms than people with seizures limited to the
temporal lobe (39.1 vs. 6.8%).57
Limitations of common measurement scales
Most psychometric scales, including structured psychi-
atric assessments, do not distinguish between episodic,
ictally related phenomena and an ongoing, underlying mood
disorder. This may confound assessments of psychiatric
comorbidities, especially when behavioral symptoms fluc-
tuate, data on seizure frequency and severity are incomplete,
and antiepileptic and psychotropic medication regimens are
in flux. The mechanisms, frequency, and treatment of peri-
ictal behavioral studies remain ripe for study.58
Misdiagnosis of nonepileptic seizures and events
In adults, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) have
risen in prominence as a nexus between psychiatry and
epileptology.59–64 PNES present tremendous diagnostic
challenges65 but even greater therapeutic challenges.66 A
comprehensive evaluation—including video-EEG and psy-
chiatric assessment—is generally reserved for patients who,
consistent with current recommendations,67–69 have already
failed to respond to two or more trials of medications. Well-
documented observations from the EMU need to be incor-
porated into our thinking about epilepsy and psychiatric
comorbidities. Five to 33% of patients referred and evalu-
ated for refractory epilepsy and surgical evaluation do not
have epilepsy but instead have PNES, a conversion disor-
der.59,70 Such disorders are a means of coping with severe
trauma and generally do not occur in complete isolation
from other psychiatric symptoms. Among >800 EMU-eval-
uated patients from the Portland, OR, VA Medical Center,
one fourth of the patients evaluated for epilepsy were found
to
have
PNES
without
epilepsy.
In
addition,
other
nonepileptic events were diagnosed in 3% of civilians and
12% of veterans. The EMU evaluation confirmed the diag-
nosis of epilepsy without PNES in only 40% of civilians and
18% of veterans.62 Furthermore, in veterans, a group with a
high prevalence of combat-related head trauma and at very
high risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), PNES
misdiagnosed as epilepsy were recognized in many patients
whose epilepsy had been attributed to mild traumatic brain
injury.71 The association is seen in the civilian population as
well.72 Such findings raise further questions about reports
of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a risk factor for epi-
lepsy.73
PNES are not reserved for adults; they also occur in chil-
dren. Although PNES are uncommon in the preschool years,
they begin to appear in older children, and their frequency
increases with age.74 As in adults with PNES, PTSD is a com-
mon finding, although in adolescents, it is often secondary to
sexual or physical abuse.75 A history of multiple psychiatric
diagnoses, particularly internalizing disorders, is also associ-
ated with an increased risk of PNES in children.60,76
PTSD, suicidality, and PNES
Suicidal tendencies (ideation or attempt) have been
linked to the risk of developing epilepsy, and the risk of
Epilepsia, 58(7):1123–1130, 2017

A. T. Berg et al.
 suicidal behavior, including completed suicide, is higher in
adults with epilepsy.10,77 Psychiatric disorders, particularly
depression and PTSD, are a substantial risk factor for suici-
dality by themselves. They are also risk factors for
PNES.60,78,79 A heightened risk of suicidality has not been
specifically reported in children with epilepsy. Studying
suicidality in children and adolescents is complicated by the
fact that the symptoms of suicidality (expressed wishes to
die or of plans to take one’s life) are often indications of
poor frustration tolerance or attention-seeking behavior.
Although they should never be ignored and require careful
clinical assessment, they are often nonspecific and do not
reliably identify children who are truly suicidal. A full
understanding of any association between epilepsy and sui-
cidality must first take these complexities into account.
Impact on epidemiologic studies
Accurate diagnosis of PNES has important implications
for interpreting large population surveys. For example, the
Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey contains ques-
tions such as “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other
health professional that you had seizures?” as a means of
identifying people in the population who have epilepsy.80
Resulting data are likely contaminated by a proportion of
people who endorse such questions but who have a psychi-
atric disorder that has been mislabeled as epilepsy.
Although people with PNES (with or without co-occurring
epilepsy) express cluster B personality traits,81 are more
likely to have mood and anxiety disorders, and are more
likely to express dissociative symptoms,82 there is no char-
acteristic psychological profile that is sufficiently sensitive
or
specific
to
distinguish
people
with
PNES
from
epilepsy.83–85 Therefore, even validating such questions
against the medical record diagnoses may not correct the
problem, as errors are often repeated within the records and
misdiagnosis can persist for years. It is unclear how such
errors are ultimately corrected in the administrative records
that many researchers depend on. To the extent that patients
with PNES are labeled as having epilepsy, this may both
increase the prevalence of epilepsy and the prevalence of
drug-resistant epilepsy in the population, as well as enrich
the census of people with “epilepsy” who have psychiatric
disorders. Furthermore, PNES may, in a proportion of indi-
viduals, coexist with epileptic seizures. If the two different
events are not recognized and distinguished, this may fur-
ther complicate the assessment of therapeutic success and
failures.62,86 Such diagnostic errors cannot usually be
definitively corrected without a video-monitoring evalua-
tion in which a stereotypical episode is recorded. Judging
from the results reported from EMUs, these individuals may
represent a substantial proportion of the patients in the pop-
ulation with “uncontrolled” “epilepsy.” Any epidemiologic
or administrative records-based study reporting an associa-
tion between epilepsy and psychiatric disorders must be
interpreted in light of these concerns.
The literature on the relationship between presurgical
psychiatric disorders and postsurgical seizure outcomes
may also be contaminated by misdiagnosed PNES. For
example, one report found that patients with psychiatric dis-
orders prior to surgery may be less likely to experience
remission after surgery.87 PNES, however, may be a new
postsurgical finding, particularly in individuals with a
presurgical history of psychiatric disorders.88
Recent trends in the evaluation and referral for epilepsy
surgery may partly reflect the frequency of PNES. There
has been an increase in the numbers of patients evaluated
for surgery following the publication of the American Acad-
emy of Neurology (AAN) Practice Parameter.69,89–91 The
number of surgeries, however, did not rise proportionately.
These studies demonstrate the decrease in surgeries for
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and increase in surgeries for
extratemporal and nonlesional cases. They also demonstrate
a larger proportion of patients overall being referred for
evaluation but not having surgery. Given the large propor-
tion of PNES caught during EMU admission,59,62 one con-
tributing factor may be that PNES patients who had been
misdiagnosed as having refractory epilepsy have been more
firmly encouraged to have a comprehensive evaluation.
Once accurately diagnosed, such patients would not then go
on to have surgery.
Impact on bidirectionality hypothesis
Diagnostic errors that lead patients with PNES to be mis-
diagnosed as having epilepsy need careful consideration
when evaluating studies purportedly demonstrating bi-
directionality between psychiatric disorders and epilepsy or
reporting poorer seizure control in association with psychi-
atric disorders. Such data suggest that, in some patients, the
psychiatric manifestations prior to seizure onset may in fact
represent a neuropsychiatric prodrome phase to the epilepsy
or the epilepsy a neurologic prodrome phase to the psychi-
atric disorders. If so, this could mean that implicated psychi-
atric disorders and epilepsy share some aspects of their
underlying pathophysiology. Although this could have
tremendous implications for treatment and prevention, the
errors of misdiagnosis of PNES, which affect a sizable pro-
portion of adults with uncontrolled epilepsy, must first be
addressed. This concept is distinct from auras or immediate
postictal phenomena that manifest as psychic or mood dis-
ruption only circa a seizure.
Implications
Mental health disorders and epilepsy are closely related
with overlapping risk factors and etiologies. We need
greater precision in articulating and testing hypotheses as
well as in developing policies and practice.
Investigations into the associations between epilepsy and
various psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities and conse-
quences must become more sophisticated to reflect the
Epilepsia, 58(7):1123–1130, 2017

1127
Psychiatric and Behavioral Comorbidities
 complexities of epilepsy diagnosis, the ictal manifestations
of epilepsy, and how information is acquired. Perhaps one
of the most striking lessons in the literature so far is that
there are diagnosis and treatment gaps that occur even while
we think excellent care is being provided. Overdiagnosis of
epilepsy occurs in individuals with autism92 and intellectual
disability.93 In both instances, the error results in unneces-
sary treatment with medications that can potentially cause
or exacerbate behavioral or cognitive problems. Our discus-
sion highlights the same concern in relation to psychiatric
disorders, particularly PNES. Such patients tend to receive
the wrong diagnosis (epilepsy), are treated for a disorder
they do not have (sometimes for years), and do not receive
the treatment they need for a conversion disorder that they
actually do have, therapies for which, particularly cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) are appropriate but only if the nat-
ure of the events is correctly diagnosed.94 The magnitude of
this problem is evident in the results from the monitoring
unit studies.59,62,95 These data argue strenuously for the
inclusion of psychiatric services and routine evaluation in
many (perhaps most) patients presenting with new-onset
seizures. These findings also emphasize the need to be
aware of the psychiatric history when assessing presumed
treatment failure of seizure medications to control the
events. Correcting these diagnostic errors could potentially
alter the current estimates of the number of people in the
population with epilepsy and the proportion of patients with
epilepsy who have refractory seizures.
For children, there is also much to learn. The US Preven-
tive Services Task Force recommends depression screening
for adolescents 12–18,96 and such recommendations of
course apply equally to young people with epilepsy. In the
setting of a diagnosis of epilepsy in a child, current evidence
suggests that there may be an important role for educational
interventions and perhaps counseling directed not just to the
child but to the parents, or even the entire family. Children
live with and are affected by the way they are viewed by
their parents and the expectations that their parents have for
them. Addressing apprehensions and correcting the miscon-
ceptions of parents early may help optimize outcomes for
children later.
Finally, as so exquisitely described by Lennox and, later,
Livingston, there are ample situational factors that must
surely have a negative impact on the individual with epi-
lepsy. The loss of control and autonomy, the need to take
medications, the embarrassment or awkwardness occa-
sioned by a seizure, the stigmatizing misconceptions, and,
sometimes, the cruelty with which those who are different
are treated, even in our post-ADA (Americans with Disabil-
ities Act) society—these cannot be ignored. These are larger
issues beyond the diagnosis and medical encounter; they
require a public health framework to address.97
Mental health is a key consideration for everyone. For
people with epilepsy, there are many reasons to infer that
mental
health
and
related
concerns
may
be
more
common than in people who do not have epilepsy. We
should never deny or ignore problems that are truly
there. Understanding their nature and origins, however, is
essential to addressing and resolving difficulties effec-
tively. It is essential that we not set up an expectation of
limitations, barriers, and ultimately failure that may not
exist. A full and accurate understanding of the extent and
nature of the relation between epilepsy and behavioral-
psychiatric problems is essential.
