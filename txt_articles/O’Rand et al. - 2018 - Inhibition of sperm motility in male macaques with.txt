Abstract
Men have two practical choices for contraception; the condom which has a high typical use
failure rate or vasectomy. New male hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives are under
development that target either the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) or the delivery of
sperm. One particular target is the sperm protein EPPIN, which is present on the surface of
human spermatozoa. EP055 is a small organic compound that targets EPPIN on the surface
of sperm and inhibits motility. EP055 was tested in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) males
to determine its plasma half-life after intravenous (i.v.) infusion of a single dose and for bind-
ing to its target tissues. Our initial study demonstrated a plasma half-life for EP055 of 10.6
minutes. In a second study examination of macaque testis, epididymis, and plasma after i.v.
infusion of a single dose of compound EP055 (63.25 mg/kg) demonstrated that EP055 was
detected in testis and epididymis two hours and six hours post-infusion. We initiated a trial in
rhesus (Macaca mulatta) males to assess the availability of EP055 in semen and its effect
on sperm motility as a measure of the drug’s efficacy. Four macaques were infused with a
low dose (75–80 mg/kg) followed by a recovery period and a subsequent high dose (125–
130 mg/kg) of EP055. After high dose administration, sperm motility fell to approximately
20% of pretreatment levels within 6 hours post-infusion; no normal motility was observed at
30 hours post-infusion. Recovery of sperm motility was obvious by 78 hours post-infusion;
with full recovery in all animals by 18 days post-infusion. EP055 has the potential to be a
male contraceptive that would provide a reversible, short-lived pharmacological alternative.

Men have two practical choices for contraception; the condom which has a high typical use

of the National Institutes of Health under Award
Number P51OD011092. The content is solely the
 target either the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) or the delivery of sperm, through
physical blockage [5,6] or loss of function [3].
One particular target of interest is the sperm surface protein EPPIN, whose function is
three-fold; namely as a bactericide [7], an inhibitor of PSA enzyme activity [prostate specific
antigen, a serine protease) [8] and a protein that binds the seminal plasma protein semenogelin
(SEMG1)[9]. The binding of EPPIN by anti-EPPIN antibodies (a-EAb) or SEMG1 causes a
loss of sperm function manifested as a loss of forward or progressive motility [10–12]. In a nor-
mal fertilization scenario, ejaculated sperm coated with SEMG1 undergo a temporary loss of
forward motility that is regained after removal of SEMG1 by PSA. Failure to remove SEMG1
due to a lack of PSA activity results in seminal hyper-viscosity and infertility [13–16]. Anti-
EPPIN antibodies bound to sperm substitute for SEMG1 and result in reversible infertility
[12].
Accordingly, sperm surface EPPIN is a reasonable non-hormonal contraceptive target that
warrants further study. Because an anti-EPPIN immuno-contraceptive is not considered a via-
ble commercial option [3], other approaches have been explored, including the search for
small organic compounds to substitute for SEMG1 or a-EAb, both of which have overlapping
binding sites on the C-terminal domain of EPPIN. In order to optimize our lead compounds
for binding to the C-terminal domain of EPPIN, we first characterized SEMG1’s binding to
EPPIN and defined the minimal sequence necessary to inhibit human sperm motility [3,17].
We expect the EPPIN amino acid residues that interact with SEMG1 to be the critical ones to
which our lead compound will bind in order to inhibit sperm motility. The functional conse-
quence of either SEMG1 or a-EAb binding to sperm is a decrease in sperm internal pH and a
decrease in internal Ca2+ levels [18]. Therefore, we have searched for small organic com-
pounds that would substitute for SEMG1 or a-EAb and cause a loss of sperm function. Here
we report the effects of one of our lead compounds in vivo, examining its presence in semen of
male macaques and its effects on sperm motility.
Results
During the course of developing new lead compounds that bind the protein EPPIN on the sur-
face of human spermatozoa and inhibit motility, we assayed numerous small organic com-
pounds that had multiple substitutions on a 1, 3, 5 triazine ring structure using AlphaScreen
assays [3,17]. EP012, derived from the parent compound of this triazine ring group (S1 Fig),
binds to the C-terminal domain of EPPIN as previously described for the SEMG1 peptide E2Q
[17]. As shown in an AlphaScreen assay of a-EAb binding to EPPIN (Fig 1A), EP012 inhibits
a-EAb from binding EPPIN with an IC50 of 55.4 μM +/-1.1 (n = 4). In a CASA (Computer
Assisted Sperm Analysis) assay of human sperm (Fig 1B), EP012 inhibited sperm motility with
an average relative motility index (RMI) IC50 of 33.4 μM +/-1.6 (n = 4 donors). Our prelimi-
nary testing in rats indicated a plasma half-life of less than 4 minutes.
Therefore, in an effort to improve the plasma half-life and solubility of EP012, derivatives of
EP012, EP054 and EP055, were designed (S1 Fig). EP054 was completely hydrolyzed in plasma
to EP055. Consequently, EP055 was used in further testing. As shown in an AlphaScreen assay
of a-EAb binding to EPPIN (Fig 1A), EP055 inhibits a-EAb from binding EPPIN with an IC50
of 1121 μM +/-1.1 (n = 4). In a CASA assay using human sperm (Fig 1B), EP055 inhibited
sperm motility with an average RMI IC50 of 199.5 μM+/-1.3 (n = 4 donors). The IC50 values
for EP055 were not as low as EP012 values. However, the increased solubility and plasma half-
life allowed in vivo testing of the compound.
EP055 was tested in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) males to determine its plasma half-
life after intravenous (i.v.) infusion of a single dose and for binding to its target tissues. EPPIN,

 the target for EP055 binding, is an androgen dependent protein normally present only in the
testis, epididymis and on spermatozoa [19]. Our initial study demonstrated a plasma half-life
for EP055 of 10.6 minutes (Fig 2A). In a second study examination of macaque testis, epididy-
mis, and plasma after i.v. infusion of a single dose of compound EP055 (63.25 mg/kg) demon-
strated that EP055 was detected in testis and epididymis two hours and six hours post-infusion
with significantly (p < 0.05) more EP055 (ug/mg of tissue) in the epididymis after 2 hours but
not after 6 hours (Fig 2B). The ratio of EP055 present in the epididymis compared to the testis
did not change significantly after 6 hours (Fig 2B). Because of a 1.78 weight differential

 between testis and epididymis (testis = 1.69 gm; epididymis = 0.95 gm) the total amounts of
EP055 in each tissue were not significantly different at 2 and 6 hours (Fig 2C). To confirm the
half-life, we calculated the initial plasma concentration and extrapolated the data to estimate
that EP055 would have had a plasma half-life (t1/2) of 11.9 minutes in the target tissue experi-
ment. This was consistent with our initial result (Fig 2A).
As a result of these initial studies indicating the long-term retention of EP055 in the target
tissues, we initiated a trial in rhesus (Macaca mulatta) males trained to provide semen samples
without anesthesia to assess the availability of EP055 in semen and its effect on sperm motility.
Four macaques were infused with a low dose (75–80 mg/kg) of EP055 followed by a recovery
period of two weeks followed by a subsequent infusion of a high dose (125–130 mg/kg). EP055
was detected in plasma at 6–8 hours post-infusion and barely detectable at 28–30 hours post-
infusion (Table 1; Fig 3A and 3B). In contrast, semen levels of EP055 were detectable up to 78
hours post-infusion (Table 1; Fig 3C and 3D).

 Semen samples were collected approximately at 6, 30, and 78 hours post-infusion following
the low and high dose treatments and weekly thereafter until complete recovery of normal
motility (defined as >78%, F3+F4, see S1 Table). Samples of spermatozoa were examined to
determine motility 30 minutes after semen collection to allow for clot liquefaction. As shown
in Fig 4A, after low dose administration, normal sperm motility fell below 32% by 30 hours
post-infusion, which is considered to be sub-fertile in humans [20]. Sperm motility in animal
number 25854 was only slightly affected by the low dose treatment even though the levels of
EP055 measured in the semen were not significantly different from the other three males (S2
Fig). However, sperm motility remained low in three out of four animals until at least 78 hours
post-infusion; although not significantly different from untreated. Individual data for each ani-
mal are shown in S2 Fig. As shown in Fig 4B, after high dose administration, sperm motility
fell significantly in all the animals to approximately 20% within 6 hours post-infusion; no nor-
mal motility was observed at 30 hours post-infusion. Recovery of sperm motility was obvious
by 78 hours post-infusion, with significant full recovery in all animals by 18 days post-infusion.

 Sperm motility correlated with semen levels of EP055 following both the low (Fig 4A) and
high (Fig 4B) dose infusion; with the exception of #25854 after a low dose infusion, (S2 Fig).
Semen levels of EP055 increased significantly within 6 hours post-infusion relative to pre-
treatment levels following both doses. In animals receiving the low dose, EP055 was still evi-
dent in semen at 30 and 78 hrs post-infusion, albeit at lower levels but not significantly differ-
ent relative to 6 hours. Following high dose treatment, semen EP055 levels increased
significantly relative to baseline and remained elevated between 6 and 30 hr. EP055 levels then
declined, but were still evident in semen collected 78 hours post-infusion and barely detectable
by 17 days (Table 1). The sperm motility data set for individual macaque males is given in S1
Table. Sperm motility post-infusion showed severe sperm clumping (Fig 4C) and many indi-
vidual sperm with either no motility or with no progressive motility (Fig 4C). Normal motility
was recovered after either low or high dose treatment and was indistinguishable from motility
in control ejaculates (Fig 4D). Typical examples of the sperm motility after high dose treatment
(Fig 4C) and the normal motility after recovery (Fig 4D) can be seen in the Supplemental vid-
eos. Monitoring of macaque blood and organ function during and after drug administration
gave no indications of any side effects or health warning signs (S2 Table).
Discussion
In searching for new non-hormonal male contraceptives, we assayed numerous small organic
compounds that had multiple substitutions on a 1, 3, 5 triazine ring structure. One of these,
EP055, which inhibited a-EAb from binding to EPPIN, inhibited human sperm motility, had a
plasma half-life of 10–12 minutes, and was found to remain in the testis and epididymis for at
least six hours (Fig 2). EP055 was subsequently tested in male macaques for its presence in
semen and its effect on sperm motility in the ejaculates. As expected, the plasma levels of
EP055 were barely detectable at 30 hours post-infusion (Table 1). However, our data demon-
strate that infusion of EP055 resulted in the drug being retained in semen for up to 78 hours;
effectively giving a potential contraceptive window of 24–48 hours following administration of
the drug. The μM levels of EP055 measured in the semen (>300 μM; Table 1) at 6 and 30
hours after high-dose infusion far exceed the IC50 levels measured in human sperm CASA
assays (199.5 μM). Human sperm CASA assays utilize spermatozoa from liquefied semen that
have been separated from seminal plasma and washed through a gradient which changes the
sperm surface environment as compared to epididymal sperm. The incubation time for
human sperm in the CASA assay with a test compound is 1–2 hours. In vivo spermatozoa in
the epididymis in the present macaque studies, which have never been exposed to seminal
plasma, were exposed to EP055 for long periods of time that may have provided higher EP055
binding per spermatozoon. Our results indicate that higher affinity levels of drug binding to
EPPIN in in vitro assays were not necessary for effective contraception.
Although low dose infusion of EP055 resulted in three out of four animals with marked loss
of sperm motility, the lack of a motility response after 6 hours in animal number 25854 may
indicate variations in drug metabolism or target availability. Most likely some level of target
saturation on the sperm surface is necessary for the inhibition of progressive motility. High
dose infusion of EP055 resulted in an inhibition of sperm motility in every animal, demon-
strating a potentially strong contraceptive effect. Although three weeks was sufficient for the
percent motility to return to normal, we did note after completion of the data analysis that
more than 3 weeks was necessary for the velocity to recover completely.
All of the macaques remained healthy throughout the course of treatment and none of the
parameters measured (S2 Table) showed clinically significant changes. However we did note
that ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and glucose levels rose during treatment. Although the

 ALT values were within the normal range for rhesus macaques (18.9–94.2 U/l) the increase
most likely indicates that the drug is processed in the liver or impacts liver function in some
way. The glucose levels also increased, which often is the case during excitement, and under
our experimental protocol, blood was drawn immediately after ejaculation and juice rewards.
Excitement, as in the case of glucose, can affect both neutrophils and lymphocytes in what is
called “physiologic neutrophilia” [21]. This is a shift in the cells found in the bloodstream ver-
sus cells in the tissues. Neutrophil numbers are within the reference range (2.4–9.6 x 103/
mm3), and slightly above the high end of the reference range after the high dose at 6 hrs; how-
ever it was not considered a clinical concern. Overall, EP055 had no long- term effects on any
of the animals.
Men have only two practical choices for contraception; the condom which has a high typical
use failure rate or vasectomy which is not readily reversible [1]. Our results demonstrate that
the sperm surface protein EPPIN is a reasonable non-hormonal contraceptive target. Although
EP055 has not yet been tested in a human contraceptive trial, our data indicate that it has a
strong potential to be a male contraceptive that would provide a reversible, short-lived phar-
macological alternative to condoms or vasectomy.
Materials and methods
Reagents
Chemicals were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) unless noted. EP
buffer: 21 mM HEPES, 94.6 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.7
mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 22 mM sodium lactate, 0.7 mM sodium pyru-
vate. The final pH was adjusted to 7.30 just before use and supplemented with 0.4% BSA.
Buffer was made fresh weekly, stored at 4˚C and warmed before use. Phosphate buffered saline
(PBS): 120 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 10 mM phosphate, pH = 7.6. Modified M16 was pur-
chased from EMD Millipore (catalog number MR-016-D, Billerica, MA). EP012, EP054 and
EP055 were synthesized by CiVentiChem (Research Triangle Park, NC). HEPES-buffered Tyr-
ode’s albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP-HEPES) medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albu-
min was made as described originally [22]. Concentrated stocks (100–600 mM) of EP012,
EP054 and EP055 were made in DMSO and stored at -20˚C between uses. Stocks were warmed
to room temperature before use and made fresh every 4 weeks; freeze-thaw cycles were limited
to 3–4. Aqueous dilutions of DMSO stocks were diluted into buffer within 2 hours of use. Pan-
toprazole sodium salt was provided by Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Can-
ada). A working solution of pantoprazole sodium salt (3ng/mL in acetonitrile) was used as the
internal standard spiking solution for LC-MS/MS analysis.
AlphaScreen assay of a-EAb binding to EPPIN
The AlphaScreen1 assay was carried as previously described [3]. Briefly, recombinant histi-
dine-tagged recombinant EPPIN was pre-incubated with Ni-NTA chelate donor beads (cata-
log number AS101, Perkin Elmer, Waltham MA) and anti-Eppin 007 antibody [11,23] was
pre-incubated with Protein A acceptor beads (catalog number 6760136, Perkin Elmer, Wal-
tham MA) for 30 minutes. Equal volumes of donor and acceptor bead mixtures were pipetted
into white opaque 384-well microplates (OptiPlate-384; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) in a final
volume of 30 μL. Plates were covered with top seal and transferred to a Synergy 2 Multiplat-
form automated plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT). After shaking for 2 min, plates were read
with an excitation 680/30 filter, an emission 570/100 filter and data acquired using Gen5 soft-
ware (Biotek). Each set of samples was pipetted in 4 replicates. The final concentration of assay
components was 58 nM EPPIN, 2 nM anti-Eppin 007 antibody, 5 μg/ml donor beads and

 10 μg/ml acceptor beads in 0.1M Tris pH = 8, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween-
20. Negative controls were performed under the same conditions in the absence of EPPIN or
antibody and in the presence of beads only. A specific signal for each time point was calculated
by subtracting the background signal (obtained in the absence of EPPIN) from its respective
total signal. Anti-EPPIN 007 antibody binds to the SEMG1 binding site on the C-terminus of
Eppin [11]. Non-specific interactions of compound with assay components were measured at
the same time with the IgG detection kit (0.5 mM biotinylated rabbit IgG) to generate the bead
interaction: 10 μg/ml donor and acceptor beads. (catalog number 6760617C, Perkin Elmer).
Preparation of human spermatozoa and analysis of human sperm motility
Human semen samples were obtained from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital, Chapel Hill, NC. The Institutional Review
Board determined that studies with these samples did not constitute human subjects research
as defined under U.S. federal regulations [45 CFR 46.102 (d or f) and 21 CFR 56.102(c) (e) (l)]
and the need for informed consent was waived. Semen samples were allowed to liquefy for 30
minutes and subjected to standard semen analysis to determine acceptability before freezing.
All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen, and de-identified by the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital, Chapel Hill, NC before fur-
ther processing. A density gradient (Isolate catalog number 99264, Irving Scientific, Irving CA,
or SpermCare catalog number 2221 and 2222, InvitroCare Inc., Frederick MD) was used to
prepare spermatozoa for further analysis [18]. At least 3 independent experiments were done
per assay, each using a single donor.
Computer assisted sperm analysis.
Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) was con-
ducted as previously described [17]. Briefly sperm were washed after the density gradient with
EP buffer-0.4% BSA and resuspended in modified M16 for compound treatments. Sperm were
diluted to 5 x 106/mL in 12x75 mm glass tubes with the appropriate treatment and incubated
at 37˚C in 5% CO2. For CASA analysis, sperm were loaded onto slides (CellVison 4 chamber
(20 μM), catalog number CV-1020-4CV, Fertility Technology Resources, Murphy NC) and
warmed to 37˚C before analysis. Units for CASA parameters are as follows: VAP (average path
velocity), VSL (straight line velocity), and VCL (curvilinear velocity) = μm/sec (microns/sec);
ALH (lateral head amplitude) = μm; BCF (beat cross-frequency) = Hz. The relative mobility
index (RMI) is a measure of the effect of compound on sperm and is calculated as the VSL x %
normal motility and normalized to the appropriate DMSO control.
Statistical analysis
Sample size and power analysis was performed (https://www.dssresearch.com/
KnowledgeCenter/toolkitcalculators) to determine the minimum number of males necessary to
determine whether a given dose of the compound inhibits sperm motility relative to that in
untreated males (baseline data). For the primary outcomes listed above, a one-tailed test was used
(either the compound will be inhibitory or have no effect) because it is unlikely that the compound
will increase sperm motility. Based on prior experience with assessing sperm motility, the percent-
age of motile sperm varies among males, and can range from 0% to 95% depending upon the
treatment. In normal males, motility ranges between 80–95%. Since the percentage motility post-
treatment with this new compound is unknown, and since the motility can vary over time post-
treatment, with a minimum of 4 males per group serving as their own controls for baseline sperm
data, we have a power of 0.80 at α = 0.05 to detect a difference in percentage sperm motility and
to derive statistically relevant data from the first study using this compound in nonhuman pri-
mate males.

 Graphing and statistical analysis was done using Prism version 6.07 Software (www.
graphpad.com, La Jolla, CA). Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. and (n) indicates the
number of experiments. EC50 values were calculated from the best fit non-linear regression on
transformed x = log(x) and normalized data. Half-life was calculated using the best-fit values
for One-phase decay non-linear regression. One-way ANOVA was done with a Sidak post-test
to correct for multiple comparisons (Fig 2). Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis was done
with a Dunn post-test to correct for multiple comparisons (Fig 4). Statistical significance is
indicated by � or # using p < 0.05.
Ethical approval
The studies were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. All protocols were approved by ONPRC’s Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee. The ONPRC protocol number is IP00000046 (1036: Contracep-
tive testing for semen availability in male monkeys).
Animals, semen collection and semen analysis
The general care and housing of rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was provided by
the Division of Comparative Medicine, Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC)
as previously described [24,25]. Animals were pair-caged in a temperature-controlled (22˚C)
light-regulated (12L:12D) room and fed monkey chow twice a day, water ad libitum and fresh
fruit or vegetables daily. Environmental enrichment in the form of toys, food puzzles, or other
manipulanda were provided continuously by the Behavioral Science Unit at ONPRC, and
changed weekly. All housing, feeding and environmental enrichment follow regulations
required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfare Act, the
Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, and outlined in the National Research Council, Institute
for Laboratory Animal Resources, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
The physical and behavioral condition of animals are monitored daily at ONPRC. Addi-
tional monitoring by Division of Comparative Medicine and/or clinical veterinary staff was
provided immediately, at 1 hr, 2 hr and 6 hr post-administration of the contraceptive com-
pound, and daily for up to 30 days after the final drug injection. Criteria used to assess animal
health and welfare include: stool and urine quality and quantity, appetite and attitude (bright
and alert, quiet, lethargic), pain (not eating, not moving, hunched over, lethargy/disinterest),
vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, dehydration (unkempt coat, lack of urine production), and signs
of wounds of injury. In addition, the ONPRC Standardized Pain Scoring system is used post-
surgically to monitor an animal’s progress and improvement over time. Major criteria include
animal appearance, posture, activity (including stool and urine production), vocalization and
atypical behaviors.
Animals assigned for semen collection were evaluated on the basis of ease of restraint, num-
ber of attempts required to obtain a sample, and a qualitative judgment regarding the animal’s
tolerance of the procedure. If an animal proved uncooperative or a sample was not obtained
after attempts on three separate occasions, it was rejected from the program. Remaining candi-
dates were then accepted or rejected on the basis of a qualitative analysis of their sperm sam-
ples. Only monkeys with sperm numbers greater than 100 million per ejaculate and with more
than 70% motile cells with normal morphology were acceptable.
Four, adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; mean age of 7.8 years of age, range
7–10 years; mean body weight of 10.1 kg, range 8.1–13. 6 kg) successfully underwent pole and
collar training and were acclimated for temporary chair restraint to provide semen samples via
penile electroejaculation as per standard operating procedures in the Division of Comparative

 Medicine at ONPRC [25]. The pole and collar system provides a method of restraining awake
monkeys for procedures that are safe for both animals and staff. Males were acclimated to
wearing a titanium collar for one week, after which poles were attached to the collar to allow
transfer of non-anesthetized animals to a nonhuman primate restraint chair for semen collec-
tion. Pole and collar training with subsequent training for chair restraint is done in stages
using a positive reinforcement system that typically takes 6 weeks, but the training interval
depends upon the individual animal. The duration of chair restraint at the times of semen col-
lection was 30 minutes or less. Positive reinforcement in the form of fruit, vegetables, cereal or
liquids was also administered during semen collections.
Semen was collected by direct penile stimulation with a P-T Electronics Model 303 PTE
110 Volt AC stimulator equipped with electrocardiogram pad electrodes (10–35 V, 20 ms
duration, 18 pulses/sec) as previously described [25]. Semen was collected weekly for 3 weeks
to establish baseline parameters for each male. Samples were inspected visually to determine
sperm motility and suitability for the study. Sperm motility data from male 28106 presented in
S1 Table is representative of pre-treatment samples. Immediately after collection, the seminal
plug was separated from the liquefied fraction, placed into a cryovial, flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80C until evaluation for drug levels. Spermatozoa were prepared by
centrifugation (7 min, 200 g) of the liquid portion of the ejaculate and resuspending the sperm
pellet in TALP-HEPES medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin at 37˚C. An aliquot
was taken to determine concentration using a hemocytometer, percent motility and forward
progression as previously described [25,26]. Baseline semen samples were collected from each
male twice during the week prior to treatment. Semen was collected from each male 6–8 hr,
28–30 hr, and 78 hr post-infusion of low dose EP055 (75–80 mg/kg body weight) intrave-
nously. After a one-week recovery period, a baseline semen sample was obtained, and the fol-
lowing week semen samples were collected as described above after an intravenous infusion of
high dose EP055 (125–130 mg/kg).
Animals were returned to the ONPRC colony after the experiments were completed.
