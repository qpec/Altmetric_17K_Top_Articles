Abstract
Importance—ADHD is now recognized to occur in adulthood and is associated with a range of 
negative outcomes. However, less is known about the prospective course of ADHD into adulthood, 
the risk factors for its persistence past childhood, and the possibility of its emergence in young 
adulthood in non-clinical populations.
Objective—To investigate childhood risk factors and young adult functioning of individuals with 
persistent, remitted and late-onset ADHD.
Design, Setting and Participants—The study sample is the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) 
Longitudinal Twin Study, a UK nationally-representative birth cohort of 2,232 twins born in 
England and Wales in 1994–1995.
Main Outcome Measures—ADHD diagnoses were assessed in childhood at ages 5, 7, 10, and 
12 and in young adulthood at age 18. Childhood predictors included pre/perinatal factors, child 
clinical characteristics and aspects of the family environment. Age-18 outcomes included ADHD 
symptoms and associated impairment, overall functioning and other mental health disorders.

 Results—Among individuals with childhood ADHD (n=247), 21.1% met diagnostic criteria for 
the disorder at age 18. Persistence was associated with higher levels of symptoms and lower IQ in 
childhood. Persistent individuals had more functional impairment and higher rates of other mental 
health disorders at age 18 compared to those who remitted. Among individuals with adult ADHD 
(n=162), 67.9% did not meet criteria for ADHD at any assessment at or prior to age 12. In 
childhood, individuals with late-onset ADHD showed fewer behavior problems and higher IQ 
compared to the persistent group; at age 18, they showed comparable ADHD symptoms and 
impairment and similarly elevated rates of mental health disorders compared to the persistent 
group.
Conclusion and Relevance—In this general population cohort, the persistence of ADHD was 
largely driven by childhood ADHD severity and poorer neuropsychological functioning. 
Additionally, we identified heterogeneity in the adult ADHD population such that this group 
consisted of a large late-onset ADHD group with no childhood diagnosis and minimal 
neuropsychological impairment, and a smaller group with persistent ADHD and associated 
neuropsychological impairment. Our findings call into question the conceptualization of adult 
ADHD as a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder.
Introduction
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly recognized to occur in 
adulthood,1–3 and has been associated with several negative outcomes, including depression 
and substance abuse,1 lower educational attainment,4 unemployment,1,5 and excess 
mortality.6 To date, adult ADHD has been conceptualized as a continuation of childhood 
ADHD. However, recent findings have suggested that for some, ADHD may not arise until 
adolescence or adulthood and may be associated with different risk factors and outcomes 
than childhood ADHD.7 In the current study, we take a prospective, developmental approach 
to clarifying the origins and correlates of adult ADHD in a UK general population cohort.
While ADHD was originally described as childhood-limited,8,9 prospective follow-up 
studies of clinic-referred children with ADHD indicate that approximately 15% will 
continue to meet diagnostic criteria, and 65% will continue to have impairing ADHD 
symptoms as young adults.10 These studies have identified childhood risk factors associated 
with a more persistent course, including higher levels of symptoms, comorbid oppositional-
defiant disorder (ODD), lower IQ, and family socioeconomic disadvantage.11–15 However, 
the vast majority of follow-up studies of children with ADHD have been conducted with 
clinical samples, which may not represent the overall ADHD population.16 Additionally, 
individuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria in childhood are generally not included in 
studies following children with ADHD, resulting in a limited understanding of the potential 
emergence of the disorder in later life.
Our investigation aims to characterize adult ADHD by examining the persistence of the 
disorder from childhood to age 18, and its possible emergence in young adulthood. First, we 
examined childhood predictors of persistent ADHD, including pre/perinatal, clinical, and 
family environmental factors. Second, we assessed whether some individuals who did not 
have an ADHD diagnosis in childhood developed the disorder by age 18, and described

 childhood risk factors among these individuals. Third, we investigated the functioning of 
persistent and late-onset ADHD groups at age 18 to understand how these groups differ or 
resemble one another in young adulthood.
Methods
Study cohort
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, 
which tracks the development of a birth cohort of 2,232 British children. The sample was 
drawn from a larger birth register of twins born in England and Wales in 1994–95.17 Full 
details about the sample are reported elsewhere.18 The E-Risk sample was constructed in 
1999–2000, when 1,116 families (93% of those eligible) with same-sex 5-year-old twins 
participated in home-visit assessments. This sample comprised 55% monozygotic and 45% 
dizygotic twin pairs; sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male). Families were 
recruited to represent the UK population with newborns in the 1990s, on the basis of 
residential location throughout England and Wales and mother’s age. Teenaged mothers with 
twins were over-selected to replace high-risk families who were selectively lost to the 
register through non-response. Older mothers having twins via assisted reproduction were 
under-selected to avoid an excess of well-educated older mothers. At follow up, the study 
sample represented the full range of socioeconomic conditions in the UK.19
Follow-up home visits were conducted when the children were aged 7 (98% participation), 
10 (96%), 12 (96%), and 18 years (93%). With parents’ permission, questionnaires were 
mailed to the children’s teachers, who returned questionnaires for 94% of children at age 5, 
93% of those followed up at age 7, 90.1% at age 10, and 83% at age 12. A total of 2,066 
participants took part in assessments at age 18. There were no differences between those 
who did and did not take part at age 18 in socioeconomic status when the cohort was 
initially defined, or age 5 IQ, internalizing or externalizing problems.20 Home visits at ages 
5, 7, 10, and 12 years included assessments with participants and their mother; home visit at 
age 18 included interviews only with participants. Each twin was assessed by a different 
interviewer, and was asked to identify individuals to act as co-informants; 99.3% of 
participants at age 18 had complete co-informant data. The Joint South London and 
Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee approved each phase of 
the study. Parents gave informed consent and twins gave assent between 5–12 years and then 
informed consent at age 18.
Childhood ADHD diagnosis
We ascertained ADHD diagnosis on the basis of mother and teacher reports of 18 symptoms 
of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity according to DSM-IV criteria.21–23 Participants 
had to have six or more symptoms reported by mothers or teachers in the past 6 months, and 
the other informant must have endorsed at least two symptoms. For the current study, we 
considered participants to have a diagnosis of childhood ADHD if they met criteria at age 5, 
7, 10 or 12. Participants who had ADHD information on at least two of the four childhood 
assessments and did not to meet diagnostic criteria at any available assessments were 
classified as not having the disorder in childhood. Two children whose symptoms fell below

 threshold for diagnosis but were taking ADHD medication were included in the ADHD 
group. In total, 247 participants (12.1%) met criteria for ADHD in childhood. A previous 
study in this cohort identified a heritability of ADHD symptoms at age 5 of 74%.23
Adult ADHD diagnosis
We ascertained ADHD diagnosis at age 18 based on private structured interviews with 
participants regarding 18 symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity according 
to DSM-5 criteria.7 Symptoms were reported for the preceding 12 months. Consistent with 
DSM-5 criteria for ADHD in adulthood, participants had to endorse five or more inattentive 
and/or five or more hyperactivity–impulsivity symptoms to be diagnosed. We also required 
that symptoms interfered with individual’s “life at home, or with family and friends” and 
“life at school or work” as rated 3 or higher on a scale from “1=mild interference” to 
“5=severe”, thereby meeting criteria for impairment and pervasiveness. The DSM-5 
requirement of symptom onset prior to age 12 was met if parents or teachers reported 2 or 
more ADHD symptoms at ages 5, 7, 10 or 12. Of the 2,066 participants interviewed at age 
18, 2,061 had information on adult ADHD. Analyses were restricted to 2,040 individuals 
with information on ADHD in childhood and adulthood. Of these, 153 participants met 
criteria for adult ADHD based on symptoms and impairment. At age 18, 13 individuals were 
taking ADHD medication, of whom 9 did not otherwise meet criteria, but were included in 
the adult ADHD group for a total of 162 (7.9%) participants with ADHD at age 18. We 
fitted an ACE model and identified a heritability estimate of ADHD symptoms of 35% (95% 
CI: 25–41%).
Persistent, remitted, and late-onset ADHD groups
Among individuals who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD in childhood or adulthood, we 
identified three mutually exclusive groups (Figure 1): individuals with persistent ADHD 
who met diagnostic criteria both in childhood and at age 18 (n=52, 2.5% of the total 
sample); individuals with remitted ADHD who met diagnostic criteria in childhood but not 
at age 18 (n=195, 9.6%); and individuals with late-onset ADHD who did not meet 
diagnostic criteria in childhood but did at age 18 (n=110, 5.4%). A total of 1,683 (82.5%) 
participants did not meet criteria for ADHD in childhood or adulthood.
Statistical analyses
First, we compared ADHD groups on pre/perinatal, childhood clinical and family factors; 
we compared individuals with childhood and adult ADHD, in turn, to the reference group 
who never met criteria, using logistic regressions. To understand childhood predictors of 
ADHD persistence to age 18, we compared individuals who persisted to those who remitted 
by age 18. Second, to characterize childhood features of the late-onset group, we compared 
persistent individuals to those with late-onset ADHD. Third, we examined functional 
outcomes at age 18 among these groups. To understand the impact of remission, we 
compared the persistent and remitted groups on age-18 correlates. We also compared 
persistent and late-onset groups on these factors to understand whether the presence of 
ADHD in childhood influenced age-18 functioning. Table 1 lists the measures used to 
describe childhood risk factors and age-18 correlates of ADHD. Analyses were corrected for

Results
Predictors of childhood and adult ADHD
Participants who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD in childhood and those who met 
diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adulthood both differed from controls on pre/perinatal 
factors, clinical features and family environment (Table 2). As these two ADHD groups 
were not mutually exclusive, similar correlates are unsurprising. However, the gender 
distribution differed between ADHD groups: males were overrepresented in the childhood 
ADHD group, while the gender ratio was nearly equal in the adult ADHD group.
Childhood characteristics of persistent versus remitted ADHD
Among individuals who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD in childhood, 21.1% still had the 
disorder by age 18. Few childhood characteristics distinguished individuals with persistent 
and remitted ADHD (Table 2): persistent individuals had more symptoms across childhood 
and lower performance IQ compared to those who remitted. Overall, characteristics of the 
family environment did not distinguish individuals who persisted from those who remitted, 
except that families of persistent individuals had comparatively higher maternal warmth and 
less maternal depression.
Childhood characteristics of late-onset versus persistent ADHD
Among individuals with adult ADHD, 67.9% had late-onset ADHD. Comparing mutually 
exclusive groups of individuals with persistent and late-onset ADHD, late-onset individuals 
were less likely to be male and, controlling for gender, had fewer childhood behavioral 
problems and less cognitive impairment than persistent individuals (Table 2). Pre/perinatal 
factors and characteristics of the family environment did not differ between these groups.
Young adult functioning of persistent versus remitted ADHD
At age 18, co-informants rated individuals with persistent ADHD as having more symptoms 
compared to remitted individuals, and interviewers rated them as less conscientious, diligent 
and persevering than remitted peers (Table 3). While persistent individuals had lower IQ and 
life satisfaction than remitted individuals, these differences were marginally significant. 
Persistent individuals had elevated rates of generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder 
and marijuana dependence compared those who remitted. However, compared to controls, 
individuals with remitted ADHD had more self-rated ADHD symptoms and impairment at 
home and with friends, more ADHD symptoms as rated by co-informant, lower life 
satisfaction and job preparedness, and higher rates of major depression and conduct disorder.
Young adult functioning of late-onset versus persistent ADHD
Individuals with late-onset ADHD differed from the persistent group on few variables at age 
18 (Table 3). Co-informants rated symptoms as lower for the late-onset than the persistent 
group, and interviewers rated them as more conscientious, diligent and persevering. Age-18

 IQ was higher in the late-onset than the persistent group. However, persistent and late-onset 
ADHD groups were similar on levels of ADHD symptoms and functional impairment, life 
satisfaction, job preparedness, and rates of being in formal education. Late-onset and 
persistent ADHD individuals were also similar on age-18 psychiatric comorbidity: both had 
elevated rates of generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, and marijuana dependence. 
Late-onset individuals had significantly elevated alcohol dependence compared to those who 
persisted.
Discussion
Our study was uniquely suited to investigate the persistence and emergence of adult ADHD, 
given its prospective follow-up of a general population sample of children with and without 
ADHD from early childhood to young adulthood. We found that ADHD persistence was 
largely driven by severity of the childhood disorder and associated neuropsychological 
impairment. Additionally, our results suggest that adult ADHD is more complex than a 
straightforward continuation of the childhood disorder, with 70% of individuals with adult 
ADHD never having a diagnosis in childhood.
Persistence driven by childhood ADHD severity
While we examined a wide range of risk factors, we found persistence to be predominantly 
accounted for by severity of childhood ADHD symptoms. That childhood ADHD severity 
was related to persistence is consistent with several,11,25 but not all,12,26 prospective studies 
in clinical samples. We also found that lower IQ, especially performance IQ, was associated 
with persistence. However, after adjusting for number of childhood ADHD symptoms, IQ 
was no longer significant, suggesting that its effect on persistence may be due to the co-
occurrence of lower IQ with more ADHD symptoms. While most pre-/perinatal and family 
environment factors were associated with the incidence of ADHD in childhood, overall they 
were not associated with its persistence into adulthood.
Most children with ADHD will remit by age 18 but impairment remains
The majority of individuals with ADHD in childhood no longer met criteria at age 18; 
however, while remitted individuals showed better functioning than those with persistent 
ADHD, they remained impaired. Relatively few childhood factors predicted remission. 
Recent findings point to a large genetic influence on the course of ADHD symptoms across 
development,27 such that remission may be related to a genetic predisposition for more 
transient symptoms.
Additionally, it could be that concurrent lifestyle factors are more important for determining 
adult ADHD. Individuals with ADHD often do not exhibit symptoms when engaged in tasks 
they find rewarding.28 As children with ADHD get older, they are given more opportunities 
to shape their lives and pursue interests they find engaging. In this way, young adults in 
milieus adapted to their ADHD at age 18 may be more likely to consider themselves in 
remission, independent of earlier life differences.
ADHD was more likely to remit among individuals whose mothers had depression and 
showed less warmth. Possibly some children exhibit symptoms in response to poor family

 environments, but once these individuals move away from home, symptoms abate. Other 
aspects of the environment were not more compromised in the remitted group, suggesting 
that if this association is causative, it may be specific to pathways related to maternal-child 
bonding.
What is late-onset ADHD?
The high proportion of individuals with late-onset ADHD calls into question the 
conceptualization of the disorder as a neurodevelopmental condition originating in 
childhood. Recent studies suggest the possibility of ADHD emergence after childhood: 
findings from the Dunedin Study found that 90% of the individuals with adult ADHD at age 
38 did not met diagnostic criteria for the disorder in childhood.7 We found that already by 
age 18 late-onset individuals constitute a large proportion of adult ADHD. This is consistent 
with recent studies that identified individuals for whom ADHD symptoms increased in 
adolescence and adulthood.27,29
However, many questions remain as to the nature of late-onset ADHD and its relationship to 
ADHD as currently conceptualized. One explanation could be that these individuals have an 
underlying liability for ADHD, but that the disorder was not yet apparent in childhood. For 
some individuals, childhood symptoms may be compensated for by supportive family 
environments or highly developed cognitive skills. In such cases, symptoms may not become 
impairing until youths face the increased challenges of later, more intellectually demanding 
schooling.28
A second possibility is that late-onset individuals do not have ADHD at age 18, but rather a 
different disorder presenting with similar symptoms. We found that late-onset individuals 
exhibit elevated rates of anxiety, depression, marijuana dependence and alcohol dependence. 
To investigate whether the late-onset group is entirely accounted for by ADHD-like 
symptoms from other disorders, we excluded individuals with diagnoses of anxiety, 
depression, marijuana, and alcohol dependence. We found that the remaining 33.6% (n=37) 
of the late-onset group still presented with full ADHD criteria, indicating that these 
disorders do not entirely explain the presence of late-onset ADHD.
A third explanation is that late-onset ADHD is a distinct disorder. In childhood, the late-
onset group shows important differences from the persistent group, including less 
neuropsychological impairment. We also found that the heritability of adult ADHD was 
lower than for childhood ADHD. Furthermore, late-onset ADHD was equally common 
among males and females, while childhood ADHD is more frequent in boys. As women and 
girls are understudied in ADHD research,30 this gender-specific finding warrants further 
research. Given that the current conceptualization of ADHD is of a highly genetic 
neurodevelopmental disorder originating in childhood, the absence of these distinctive 
features in the late-onset group is suggestive of differing etiologies.
Limitations
First, our use of self-reports at age 18 is a limitation. However, adult self-reports have been 
found to be valid;31 also our co-informants rated the persistent group as having more 
symptoms than the remitted group, corroborating self-reports. We also found childhood risk

 factors for persistence were similar when age-18 symptoms were reported by co-informants 
(Appendix 1).
Second, it is both a limitation and a strength that our criteria for adult ADHD were restricted 
to those with at least two childhood symptoms. This could be viewed as a limitation, as the 
late-onset group, by definition, has young adult onset of the ADHD syndrome rather than 
symptoms. It is also a strength, as our adult ADHD group meets DSM-5 criteria, which 
stipulate symptom onset before age 12. Our requirement of at least 2 symptoms in childhood 
does not identify a group with subthreshold ADHD in childhood; exhibiting at least 2 
symptoms in childhood was quite normative, as 80% of our study population falls into this 
category.
Third, the sample comprised twins, so results may not generalize to singletons. However, our 
rate of persistence of 21.1% is slightly higher than found in a meta-analysis;10 given the 
young age of our cohort, this is not unexpected. Our prevalence of childhood ADHD of 12% 
was higher than the 3.4–11% estimated previously,32,33 possibly because we are capturing 
more cases by assessing ADHD at four ages across childhood.
Conclusions and implications
Due to the prospective, longitudinal design of the E-Risk study, we were able to identify 
heterogeneity in the adult ADHD population. Our findings highlight the importance of 
taking a developmental approach to understanding ADHD. A significant proportion of those 
presenting clinically with ADHD symptoms in adulthood may not have met criteria for the 
disorder in childhood. While many questions remain as to the nature of late-onset ADHD, 
we found this group showed significant levels of ADHD symptoms and impairment, as well 
as poor functioning and high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Therefore, the absence of a 
clear childhood diagnosis of ADHD should not preclude adults with ADHD from receiving 
clinical attention. Whether individuals with late-onset versus childhood-onset ADHD 
respond differently to treatment is an open question, and further research is required to better 
understand the etiology, course and optimal treatment of late-onset ADHD.

 At a Glance
•
The purpose of this study was to investigate childhood risk factors and young 
adult functioning of individuals with persistent, remitted and late-onset 
ADHD.
•
In a general population cohort with prospective follow-up, the rate of 
persistence of ADHD from childhood to age 18 was 21.1%.
•
Persistence of ADHD was largely driven by severity of ADHD and associated 
poorer neuropsychological functioning in childhood.
•
Of the population of individuals with ADHD at age 18, 67.9% did not meet 
criteria for ADHD in childhood; these late-onset ADHD individuals were as 
impaired as individuals with persistent ADHD at age 18.
•
The large proportion of the adult ADHD population with no childhood 
ADHD diagnosis calls into question the conceptualization of adult ADHD as 
a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder.
