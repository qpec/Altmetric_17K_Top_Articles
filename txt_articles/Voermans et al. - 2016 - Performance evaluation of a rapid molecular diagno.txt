Background:
 Clinical
 signs
 and  symptoms
 of  different
 airway
 pathogens
 are  generally
 indistinguish-
able,
 making
 laboratory
 tests
 essential
 for  clinical  decisions
 regarding
 isolation
 and  antiviral
 therapy.
Immunochromatographic
 tests  (ICT)
 and direct  immunofluorescence
 assays
 (DFA)  have
 lower  sensitiv-
ities
 and  specificities
 than
 molecular
 assays,
 but  have  the  advantage
 of quick  turnaround
 times  and
ease-of-use.
Objective:
 To  evaluate
 the  performance
 of a rapid  molecular
 assay,  ARIES
 FluA/B
 &  RSV,
 using  laboratory
developed
 RT-PCR  assays  (LDA),  ICT  (BinaxNOW)
 and
 DFA.
Methods:
 Analytical
 and  clinical
 performance
 were
 evaluated
 in
 a retrospective
 study  arm (stored
 res-
piratory
 samples
 obtained
 between
 2006–2015)
 and  a prospective
 study  arm  (unselected
 fresh  clinical
samples
 obtained
 between
 December
 2015  and  March
 2016
 tested  in  parallel
 with  LDAs).
Results:
 Genotype
 inclusivity
 and  analytical
 specificity
 was  100%.
 However,
 ARIES  was
 0.5  log, 1–2logs  and
2.5logs
 less  sensitive
 for  fluA,  RSV  and  fluB  respectively,
 compared
 to LDA.  In
 total,  447  clinical
 samples
were
 included,  of  which
 15.4%  tested  positive
 for  fluA,  9.2%  for  fluB  and  26.0%
 for  RSV,  in both
 LDA and
ARIES.
 ARIES  clinical  sensitivity
 compared
 to  LDA  was  98.6%  (fluA),  93.3%  (fluB)
 and  95.1% (RSV).  Clinical
specificity
 was  100%
 for all  targets.
 ARIES  detected
 10.6%
 (4  fluA,  8 fluB,  11  RSV)  and  26.9%  (7
 fluA,
 3  fluB,
22
 RSV)
 more  samples
 compared
 to DFA  and  ICT,  all  confirmed
 by  LDA.
Conclusion:
 Although
 analytically
 ARIES  is less  sensitive
 than  LDA,  the  clinical
 performance
 of  the
 assay
in
 our  tertiary
 care  setting
 was  comparable,
 and  significantly
 better  than  that  of  the  established
 rapid
assays.

 Background
Rapid
 and
 accurate
 detection
 of
 influenza
 A
 (fluA)
 and
 B
 (fluB)
viruses
 and
 respiratory
 syncytial
 virus
 (RSV)
 is
 important
 for
 clin-
ical
 patient
 management
 and
 infection
 control
 purposes.
 Rapid
laboratory
 diagnostics
 may
 result
 in
 less
 antibiotic
 prescription
 and
more
 frequent
 use
 of
 antivirals
 [1–3].
 Molecular
 assays
 are
 consid-
ered
 to
 be
 the
 standard
 for
 the
 detection
 of
 respiratory
 viruses,
but
 may
 be
 relatively
 time
 consuming
 and
 need
 qualified
 molecu-
lar
 laboratory
 personnel
 to
 execute
 and
 for
 result
 interpretation.

3.2.
 Analytical
 performance
 evaluation
Genotype
 inclusivity
 was
 assessed
 using
 a
 reference
 panel,
including
 16
 avian
 (H1-H16)
 and
 33
 human
 fluA
 strains
 (H1N1,
H1N1p2009,
 H3N2,
 H5N1,
 H7N7,
 H2N2),
 reflecting
 viruses
 circu-
lating
 between
 1968
 and
 2014,
 3
 fluB
 strains
 (2
 Yamagata
 and
1
 Victoria)
 and
 2
 RSV
 (A/B)
 strains.
 Avian
 and
 highly
 pathogenic
fluA
 strains
 were
 inactivated
 using
 MagNaPureLC
 lysisbuffer
 (200ul
sample
 +
 300ul
 lysisbuffer)
 (Roche,
 Almere,
 the
 Netherlands)
 before
running
 in
 the
 ARIES.
 Analytical
 specificity
 was
 assessed
 using
 high
titred
 virusstocks
 (median
 Ct-value

 Repeatability
 was
 assessed
 using
 replicates
 of
 a

 Results
 were
 compared
to
 an
 ISO15189:2012
 validated
 laboratory
 developed
 automated
real-time
 RT-PCR
 assays
 using
 Aurora
 FLOW
 (Roche,
 Almere,
 the
Netherlands)
 (LDA)
 (Supplementary
 materials).

 Clinical
 performance
 evaluation
Clinical
 performance
 was
 evaluated
 both
 retrospectively,
 for
inclusion
 of
 known
 positive
 fluA/B/RSV
 samples,
 and
 prospectively
for
 inclusion
 of
 fresh
 respiratory
 tracts
 samples
 and
 head-to-head
comparison
 with
 the
 routinely
 used
 LDA.
For
 retrospective
 evaluation
 stored
 (−80 ◦C)
 pre-treated
 respi-
ratory
 tract
 samples
 from
 January
 2006–July
 2015
 were
 selected;
from
 each
 year
 4
 positive
 samples
 per
 species
 (fluA,
 fluB,
 RSVA
 and
RSVB)
 to
 include
 genotypic
 variances
 and
 different
 sample
 types.
Prospective
 evaluation
 was
 performed
 on
 unselected
 fresh
 respira-
tory
 tract
 samples
 from
 patients
 presented
 to
 our
 hospital
 between
December
 2015–March
 2016.
For
 retrospective
 evaluation,
 ARIES
 results
 were
 compared
to
 historical
 LDA,
 DFA
 and
 ICT
 results
 retrieved
 from
 the
 LIMS
database.
 The
 historical
 LDA
 results
 were
 obtained
 using
 primers
and
 probes
 identical
 to
 those
 described
 above;
 sample
 pre-
treatment,
 isolation
 and
 real-time
 PCR
 however,
 were
 performed
as
 previously
 described
 [6]
 (Supplementary
 methods).
Both
 retrospective
 and
 prospective
 discrepant
 samples
 were
confirmed
 by
 repeating
 both
 ARIES
 and
 LDA
 by
 using
 Aurora
 FLOW,
as
 described
 above.
 Results
 after
 discrepancy
 testing
 were
 used
 for
further
 analysis.
DFA
 was
 performed
 as
 previously
 described
 [7]
 and
 ICT
 was
performed
 using
 BinaxNOW® Influenza
 A
 and
 B
 and
 BinaxNOW®
RSV
 (Alere
 health,
 Tilburg
 The
 Netherlands)
 as
 described
 by
 the
manufacturer.
This
 study
 was
 approved
 by
 the
 Medical
 Ethical
 Committee
 of
the
 Erasmus
 MC  (MEC-2015-475).
3.4.
 Statistical
 analysis
Statistical
 analysis
 was
 performed
 using
 IBM
 SPSS
 v21
 (Table
 2)
and
 Deming
 regression
 and
 Mann-Whitney
 test
 for
 non-parametric
non
 paired
 data
 was
 performed
 using
 GraphPad
 Prism
 v5.00
 for
Windows.
 95%
 Confidence
 intervals
 were
 calculated
 using
 the
 Wil-
son
 method,
 Epitools
 (http://epitools.ausvet.com.au).

 Results
4.1.
 Analytical
 performance
 of
 ARIES
To
 determine
 whether
 external
 lysis
 could
 be
 used
 in
 the
 ARIES
system,
 6
 human
 influenza
 A
 virus
 strains
 were
 tested
 with
 and
without
 external
 lysis,
 resulting
 in
 comparable
 Ct-values
 (median
�Ct
 =
 1.1,
 range
 0.6–2.2),
 taking
 dilution
 factor
 into
 account.
 All
54
 avian
 and
 human
 fluA,
 fluB,
 RSVA
 and
 RSVB
 strains
 tested
 for
genotype
 inclusivity
 were
 detected
 by
 the
 ARIES.
 No
 false
 positive
reactions
 with
 non-fluA/fluB/RSV
 virusstocks
 were
 detected.
Analytical
 sensitivity
 testing
 showed
 comparable
 results
 to
 LDA
(≤0.5
 log)
 for
 fluA,
 but
 1
 log,
 2
 logs
 and
 2.5
 logs
 less
 sensitive
 for
RSVA,
 RSVB
 and
 fluB,
 respectively.
 To
 determine
 the
 repeatability,
%CV
 was
 calculated
 of
 37
 replicates
 of
 a
 positive
 process
 control
(PPC)
 containing
 each
 fluA,
 fluB
 and
 RSVA/B
 viruses,
 resulting
 in
a%CV
 of
 2.7–3.6%.
 The
 concentration
 of
 fluB
 (LDA
 Ct-value
 26.4)
 in
the
 PPC
 was
 close
 to
 the
 ARIES
 limit
 of
 detection
 and
 tested
 positive
32
 out
 of
 37
 (86.5%),
 fluA
 (LDA
 Ct-value
 27.5)
 and
 RSV
 (LDA
 Ct-value
RSVA
 25.1,
 RSVB
 26.4)
 tested
 positive
 in
 all
 replicates.
 T-
 and
 F-test
showed
 no
 significant
 difference
 (<0.05)
 of
 the
 data
 retrieved
 in
three
 subsequent
 months,
 implying
 PPC
 can
 be
 tested
 only
 once
 a
month.
4.2.
 Clinical
 performance
 of
 ARIES
In
 total
 447
 clinical
 respiratory
 tract
 samples
 were
 included,
 of
which
 162
 belonged
 to
 the
 retrospective
 study
 arm,
 specifically
 133
nasal
 washings,
 14
 throat
 swabs,
 6
 bronchial
 alveolar
 lavages
 (BAL),
9
 sputa
 and
 1
 nose
 swab,
 of
 which
 23.5%
 were
 positive
 for
 fluA
 (9.9%
H1N1p09,
 1.2%
 H1N1,
 11.7%
 H3N2
 and
 0.6%
 H1N1
 +
 H3N2)
 19.8%
 for
fluB
 (8.6%
 Victoria,
 10.5%
 Yamagata,1
 sample
 (0.6%)
 non-typeable)
and
 50.6%
 for
 RSV
 (26.5%
 RSVA
 and
 24.1%
 RSVB).
 Additionally,
 285
prospective
 samples
 were
 included
 (55
 nasal
 washings),
 170
 throat
swabs,
 41
 BAL,
 15
 sputa,
 2
 nose
 swabs,
 1
 mouth
 swab
 and
 1
 pleural
fluid
 of
 which
 10.8%
 was
 positive
 for
 fluA
 (all
 H1N1p09
 strains),
3.5%
 for
 fluB
 (all
 Victoria
 strains)
 and
 11.9%
 for
 RSV
 (5.6%
 RSVA
 and
6.3%
 RSVB).
The
 447
 clinical
 samples
 were
 collected
 from
 406
 patients
(Table
 1).
 In
 total
 for
 both
 study
 arms
 15.4%,
 9.2%
 and
 26%
 of
 the
samples
 were
 positive
 for
 fluA,
 fluB
 and
 RSV
 (13.2%
 RSVA
 and
12.8%
 RSVB),
 respectively
 for
 both
 LDA
 and
 ARIES.
 Confirmed
 dis-
crepant
 results
 were
 found
 in
 10
 samples:
 1
 fluA
 (LDA
 Ct-value
36.0,
 H1N1p09
 strain),
 3
 fluB
 (LDA
 Ct-values
 32.5–33.9,
 all
 Victoria
strains)
 and
 6
 RSVA
 (LDA
 Ct-values
 29.3–34.5).
 In
 6
 (all
 nasal
 wash-
ings)
 of
 these
 10
 discrepant
 samples
 two
 viruses
 were
 detected
using
 LDA
 (Table
 1),
 having
 a
 common
 result
 in
 ARIES:
 the
 viral
RNA
 with
 the
 highest
 concentration
 (LDA
 Ct-values
 15.8–23.7)
 was
detected,
 the
 viral
 RNA
 with
 the
 lowest
 concentration
 (LDA
 Ct-
values
 31.5–34.5)
 was
 not
 detected.
 LDA
 was
 also
 not
 confirmed
by
 DFA
 or
 ICT
 for
 these
 samples,
 although
 1
 nasal
 washing
 (RSVA
LDA
 Ct-value
 29.3)
 was
 propagated
 by
 virus
 culture.
 One
 positive
LDA
 result
 (throat
 swab,
 fluA
 LDA
 Ct-value
 36.0)
 was
 confirmed
by
 a
 sample
 from
 the
 same
 patient,
 drawn
 earlier
 in
 the
 infection,
which
 tested
 positive
 in
 both
 ARIES
 and
 LDA.

 Conclusions
In
 this
 study
 we
 evaluated
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 ARIES
 Flu
A/B
 and
 RSV
 assay,
 a
 molecular
 diagnostic
 rapid
 test
 and
 com-
pared
 it
 to
 LDA
 and
 two
 established,
 non-molecular
 rapid
 assays.
The
 analytical
 performance,
 containing
 genotype
 inclusivity,
 speci-
ficity,
 linearity
 and
 repeatability
 showed
 comparable
 results
 to
 the
LDA
 assays.
 The
 analytical
 sensitivity
 of
 fluA
 is
 also
 comparable
 to
that
 of
 the
 LDA,
 though
 the
 fluB
 and
 RSV
 assays
 were
 up
 to
 2.5
 logs
less
 sensitive.
However,
 though
 probe-less
 real-time
 PCRs
 are
 generally
considered
 as
 less
 specific,
 the
 increased
 specify
 due
 to
 the
isoguanine/5-methylisocytosine
 chemistry
 used
 in
 ARIES
 results
 in
a
 clinical
 sensitivity
 which
 exceeds
 that
 of
 ICT
 and
 DFA,
 and
 is
 com-
parable
 to
 that
 of
 the
 LDA
 in
 the
 present
 study.
 ARIES
 was
 not
 able
to
 detect
 10
 samples
 (2.2%)
 containing
 high
 LDA
 Ct-values
 (LDA
Ct-value
 28.8–36.0).
 Though,
 these
 Ct-values
 are
 expected
 to
 be
undetectable
 in
 the
 ARIES
 as
 interpolated
 from
 the
 detectable
 range
measured
 in
 the
 analytical
 sensitivity
 experiment
 (data
 not
 shown).
Whereas
 the
 number
 of
 samples,
 which
 could
 not
 be
 detected
 by
DFA
 and
 ICT
 was
 much
 higher
 and
 contained
 significantly
 lower
Ct-values
 (Fig.
 1).
 6
 of
 the
 10
 samples
 missed
 by
 the
 ARIES
 sys-
tem
 were
 double
 infections;
 in
 all
 6
 cases
 ARIES
 only
 detected
 the
viruses
 with
 the
 lower
 LDA
 Ct-value
 (Table
 1).
The
 ARIES
 fluA/B/RSV
 assay
 was
 officially
 FDA-approved
 for
nasopharyngeal
 swabs.
 However,
 the
 most
 common
 respiratory
tract
 sample
 types
 in
 our
 routine
 diagnostic
 setting
 are
 throat
 swabs
in
 universal
 transport
 medium
 (adults)
 and
 nasal
 washings
 (chil-
dren).
 Hence,
 these
 latter
 sample
 types
 and
 sputa
 and
 BALs
 were
included
 in
 this
 study.
 Nasal
 washings,
 BAL
 and
 sputa
 were
 pre-
treated
 as
 part
 of
 routine
 work-up
 for
 the
 retrospective
 study
 arm
prior
 to
 testing
 on
 the
 ARIES
 system,
 resulting
 in
 these
 cases
 in
 suc-
cessful
 runs.
 In
 the
 prospective
 study
 on
 the
 contrary,
 these
 sample
types
 were
 tested
 untreated
 and
 10
 of
 285
 cassettes
 failed,
 probably
due
 to
 viscosity
 of
 the
 samples
 as
 the
 internal
 specimen
 control
 was
either
 negative
 or
 out
 of
 range.
 One
 may
 argue
 if
 viscosity/human
cells
 of
 these
 fresh
 (untreated)
 samples
 may
 have
 been
 the
 cause
for
 6
 samples
 (1.3%)
 of
 the
 prospective
 study
 arm
 to
 initially
 test
(false)
 positive
 without
 LDA
 or
 DFA
 confirmation.
 These
 samples
were
 either
 fluA
 (n
 =
 3),
 fluB
 (n
 =
 1)
 or
 RSV
 (n
 =
 2)
 positive
 by
 ARIES
only
 and
 had
 high
 ARIES
 Ct-values
 ranging
 from
 38.1
 to
 40.1.
 On
the
 other
 hand,
 26
 (11.5%)
 of
 the
 LDA
 confirmed
 ARIES
 (true)
 posi-
tive
 samples
 also
 had
 ARIES
 Ct-values
 of
 >38.
 If
 we  compared
 these
Ct-values
 to
 those
 of
 the
 LDA
 assays,
 the
 range
 varied
 between
LDA
 Ct-value
 25.7–34.8
 for
 RSV,
 Ct-value
 24.7–29.7
 for
 fluB
 and
Ct-value
 30.4-32.3
 for
 fluA.
 Therefore,
 high
 ARIES
 Ct-values
 should
be
 considered
 as
 positive.
All
 LDA
 assays
 are
 routinely
 performed
 on
 pre-treated
 samples
[6].
 During
 this
 pre-treatment
 cells
 are
 removed
 from
 the
 fresh
sample
 and
 the
 supernatant
 is
 diluted
 ∼10
 times.
 Since
 the
 ARIES
analytical
 sensitivity
 for
 fluA
 is
 comparable
 to
 LDA,
 it
 is
 possible
 that
the
 3
 ARIES+/LDA-
 fluA
 samples
 were
 missed
 by
 the
 LDA
 due
 to
 pre-
treatment.
 This
 scenario
 is
 less
 likely
 for
 the
 7
 RSV
 or
 fluB,
 since
 the
ARIES
 analytical
 sensitivity
 was
 1–2.5
 log
 less
 sensitive
 than
 LDA.
Indeed,
 ARIES
 false
 positivity
 cannot
 be
 ruled
 out
 in
 these
 cases.
All
 failed
 cassettes
 and
 “false-positive”
 non-throat
 swab
 samples
were
 pre-treated
 and
 repeated
 in
 both
 ARIES
 and
 LDA.
 No
 failing
cassettes
 or
 false
 positivity
 was
 observed
 hereafter.
 Throat
 swabs
were
 repeated
 untreated
 in
 both
 assays
 and
 positivity
 could
 not
 be
confirmed.
 Therefore,
 we
 recommend
 to
 dilute
 viscous
 nasal
 wash-
ings,
 sputa
 and
 BAL
 sample
 types
 prior
 to
 running
 on
 the
 ARIES
system,
 so
 failure
 of
 cassettes
 by
 inhibition
 as
 well
 as
 possible
 false
positivity
 can
 be
 avoided,
 which
 may
 positively
 affect
 the
 specificity
of
 the
 ARIES.
The
 BinaxNow
 influenza
 and
 RSV
 (ICT)
 assays
 are
 commonly
used
 and
 many
 clinical
 studies
 have
 addressed
 sensitivity
 and
specificity
 before,
 showing
 a
 lot
 of
 variation.
 [8–20]
 The
 pub-
lished
 sensitivity
 varied
 between
 a
 modest
 59%–83%
 for
 influenza
A
 virus,
 72%–90%
 for
 RSV
 and
 a
 poor
 sensitivity
 for
 influenza
 B
virus
 (33%–69%).
 The
 ICT
 sensitivity
 observed
 in
 our
 study
 confirms
these
 findings.
 Others
 suggest
 to
 confirm
 ICT
 or
 DFA
 rapid
 tests
 with
techniques
 like
 RT-PCR
 or
 virus
 culture
 to
 conduct
 proper
 results
[8,10,11,14,15,20],
 due
 to
 low
 sensitivities.
 We  suggest
 that
 confir-
matory
 testing
 for
 fluA,
 fluB
 or
 RSV
 may
 no
 longer
 be
 needed
 when
using
 ARIES,
 because
 of
 the
 superior
 sensitivity
 to
 antigen
 rapid
tests.
 Testing
 for
 other
 viral
 or
 bacterial
 respiratory
 pathogens
 may
be
 of
 higher
 clinical
 importance.
In
 terms
 of
 ease-of-use,
 is
 ARIES
 equal
 to
 systems
 like
 GeneXprt
(Cepheid)
 or
 other
 molecular
 rapid
 test
 platforms,
 however
 most
platforms
 have
 runtimes
 of
 <
 1
 h,
 where
 ARIES’
 runtimes
 are
 up
 to
2
 h.
 Nevertheless,
 other
 platforms
 do
 not
 have
 the
 possibility
 to
 run
in-house
 developed
 real-time
 assays,
 which
 generic
 ARIES
 cassettes
do
 allow
 the
 user
 to
 develop.
In
 conclusion,
 the
 ARIES
 assay
 is
 a
 rapid
 molecular
 based
 assay
for
 detection
 of
 influenza
 A
 virus,
 influenza
 B
 virus
 and
 RSV.
 The
platform
 showed
 a
 high
 clinical
 specificity
 and
 sensitivity,
 which
 is
comparable
 to
 LDA
 and
 better
 than
 those
 of
 established
 rapid
 assays
such
 as
 DFA
 and
 ICT.
 Other
 respiratory
 tract
 samples
 than
 throat
swabs
 can
 be
 run
 on
 the
 ARIES,
 but
 pre-dilution
 is
 recommended
to
 gain
 more
 reliable
 results.
