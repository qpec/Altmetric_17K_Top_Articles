Background: Together with access, acceptance of vaccines affects human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine
coverage, yet little is known about media’s role. Our aim was to determine whether measures of informa-
tion exposure derived from Twitter could be used to explain differences in coverage in the United States.
Methods: We conducted an analysis of exposure to information about HPV vaccines on Twitter, derived
from 273.8 million exposures to 258,418 tweets posted between 1 October 2013 and 30 October 2015.
Tweets were classified by topic using machine learning methods. Proportional exposure to each topic
was used to construct multivariable models for predicting state-level HPV vaccine coverage, and
compared to multivariable models constructed using socioeconomic factors: poverty, education, and
insurance. Outcome measures included correlations between coverage and the individual topics
and socioeconomic factors; and differences in the predictive performance of the multivariable models.
Results: Topics corresponding to media controversies were most closely correlated with coverage (both
positively and negatively); education and insurance were highest among socioeconomic indicators.
Measures of information exposure explained 68% of the variance in one dose 2015 HPV vaccine coverage
in females (males: 63%). In comparison, models based on socioeconomic factors explained 42% of the
variance in females (males: 40%).
Conclusions: Measures of information exposure derived from Twitter explained differences in coverage
that were not explained by socioeconomic factors. Vaccine coverage was lower in states where safety
concerns, misinformation, and conspiracies made up higher proportions of exposures, suggesting that
negative representations of vaccines in the media may reflect or influence vaccine acceptance.

1. Introduction
There is a growing recognition that news and social media chan-
nels can be exploited to shape individual views through evidence
and misinformation. While the value of news and social media as a
population intervention to positively influence health behaviors
has been examined [1,2], the impact that socially-shaped misinfor-
mation has on decision-making and health outcomes is an emerging
concern. We explored a healthcare decision that appears susceptible
to influence of news and social media—the choice of administering
the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to an adolescent.
For vaccines generally, rates of coverage are influenced by the
policies and practices that make it easier or harder to access
vaccines, as well as the representation of their safety and efficacy
in public discourse that may affect acceptance. Socioeconomic
indicators related to education, poverty, and insurance are associ-
ated with levels of immunization across countries [3,4], and these
are likely to reflect differences in both access and acceptance. In
countries where access to healthcare is a less important barrier,
socioeconomic factors tend to display weaker correlations with
immunization levels, while attitudes and beliefs play an increas-
ingly important role [5]. This phenomenon is described as an
emerging inverse relationship [6], and suggests the need to address
vaccine hesitancy in public health practice [7,8]. Until now, our
understanding of the relationship between the representation of
vaccines in news media and acceptance has come from hypotheses
generated by surveys and manual forms of media tracking [9,10].

 HPV vaccines were first available in 2006, and are used to pre-
vent the infections that can cause cervical cancers, as well as can-
cers of the anus, vagina, penis, and throat [11–13]. Surveys and
registries have been used to estimate HPV vaccine coverage by
location [14,15], but are resource intensive [16]. Around one third
of females in developed countries aged 10–20 have received a full
course of the vaccine [17], but there is substantial variation
between and within countries, especially in the United States
(US) [18,19]. Variation in both the intention to vaccinate and
receipt of HPV vaccines has been linked to socioeconomic factors
including income, education, race and ethnicity, and interactions
with the health system [20–23].
The relationships between the representation of HPV vaccines
in public discourse, vaccine acceptance, and observed vaccine cov-
erage are complicated. Describing the reasons why HPV vaccina-
tion has fallen short of targets, the 2012 US President’s Cancer
Panel report recognized that acceptance of the HPV vaccine is
affected by the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of parents and
healthcare providers [24]. Differences in exposure to information
that is critical or noncritical of HPV vaccines may influence the atti-
tudes and beliefs of the target populations, their parents, and
health professionals [25]. The representation of HPV vaccine infor-
mation in news and social media varies by source [26–29], and
there is limited evidence to suggest that acceptance of HPV vacci-
nes may be influenced by critical news media [30,31].
To better understand how the representation of HPV vaccines
in media may influence or reflect vaccine behaviors, we asked
whether populations that were disproportionately exposed to evi-
dence, advocacy, misinformation, safety concerns, or conspiracies
had higher or lower rates of HPV vaccine coverage. We chose to
use Twitter to measure population-level differences in informa-
tion exposure because it is the largest accessible source of
information about the news and social media people read or
see, and has been previously used to explain differences in health
outcomes. Our aim was to determine whether state level differ-
ences in exposure to information on Twitter about HPV vaccines
were associated with state level differences in HPV vaccine cover-
age in the US.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Study data
State level coverages of HPV vaccines were extracted from the
National Immunization Surveys undertaken by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, which included 10,084 females and
10,743 males aged 13–17 in 2014 [18], and 10,508 females and
11,367 males aged 13–17 in 2015 [19]. Measures of poverty status,
racial and ethnic composition, insurance coverage, and education
levels were used as proxies for state level differences in health
and socioeconomic status. These data were extracted from 2014
census produced by the US Census Bureau [32], for 50 states and
the District of Columbia.
Twitter is a social media platform in which users post short
messages (tweets) that may include images, videos, links to other
tweets, or links to other webpages. Tweets are visible to users
who follow them. We collected tweets in the period between 1
October 2013 and 30 October 2015, using the Twitter application
programming interface (API) to repeatedly search for tweets that
included keywords related to HPV vaccines (‘‘Gardasil”, ‘‘Cervarix”,
‘‘hpv + vaccin⁄”, ‘‘cervical + vaccin⁄”). Shortly after the first time a
new user posted a tweet meeting the search criteria, lists of follow-
ers were collected, as well as the profile information for each of
those followers. This information included self-described location
or geographical coordinates. Further details are provided in the
Supplementary Material (Section 1.1).
2.2. Location inference
The locations of Twitter users were inferred user profile infor-
mation. In Twitter, accurate location information can be found in
only a small proportion of tweets that have coordinates stored in

 the metadata of the tweet—known as geo-tags—approximately one
percent of tweets [33]. As an alternative, around half of users
describe a home location in a free text section of their user profile
designed for that purpose. Nominatim, a gazetteer used to resolve
locations from text, was used to extract the likely location of users
from their user profiles (Supplementary Material, Section 1.3).
2.3. Topic modeling
Topic modeling is a common method for grouping documents
that are semantically similar based on word level differences
[34], and the approach has been used for applications in social
media and public health [35]. The approach is a clustering method
that takes the number of topics as a parameter, and produces a
model that can be used to assign each tweet to a single topic. More
details of the method and previous implementations of topic
modeling using social media data for public health applications
are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section 1.2).
Each tweet was assigned to one of 31 topics. Topic exposures for
each state were estimated by counting the proportion of potential
exposures in that state that came from the tweets from that topic,
producing a value between 0 and 1 for each of the 51 by 31 state-
topic combinations.
2.4. Multivariable model construction and evaluation
Following a similar approach to that of Eichstaedt et al. [36]
multivariable models of vaccine coverage were constructed using
combinations of predictors from the set of topic exposures and
the census-derived socioeconomic factors. The socioeconomic fac-
tors from the US Census Bureau data included the proportions of
people in each state who were African American; Hispanic of any

 race; living below poverty levels; had high school or bachelor-
degree education; or had health insurance.
Elastic net regression was used to select and weight variables in
the models in an attempt to produce robust and parsimonious
models [37]. Fivefold cross-validation was used to measure perfor-
mance in out-of-sample data to avoid bias due to over-fitting and
the final models were constructed by averaging the coefficients
across the five rounds (Supplementary Material Section 1.4). The
outcome measures for the performance of the models were the r-
squared values and the correlation coefficients (Pearson’s r) pro-
duced by comparing the logit-transformed values for HPV vaccine
coverage from the National Immunization Surveys with the values
predicted by the models. In total there were 20 models constructed
across 4 series (males and females; in 2014 and 2015) of 5
combinations of predictors (insurance/poverty predictors, educa-
tion predictors, all socioeconomic and health predictors, only
Twitter-based predictors, all predictors), each using 50 or 51 units
of analysis (one observation was unavailable in one survey). Per-
formance was reported by the r-squared values, the correlation
coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals, and the numbers
of predictors used in the models.
3. Results
3.1. Distribution of topic exposures within the US
A total of 258,418 tweets about HPV vaccines were identified by
repeated searches using the Twitter API. The total number of public
Twitter users (globally) that may have been exposed to one or
more of these tweets was 109.2 million. From this cohort, 31.4%
(34.3 million) were identified within the US and 30.0% (32.8 mil-
lion) could be localized at the state level (Supplementary Material,
Section 2.1).
From
a
global
total
of
1.33
billion
exposures
to
HPV
vaccine tweets, 291.8 million potential exposures were associated
with the 34.3 million users located in the US, of which 93.8%
(273.8 million) could be localized to the state level, and 75.3%
(219.7 million) were associated with users localized to the county
level (Fig. 1). Total exposure counts ranged from 389,982 in
Wyoming to 41.3 million in California. The ratio of exposures to
population (also from the US Census Bureau) was highest for the
District of Columbia, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
Nevada, and Colorado (Supplementary Material Section 2.2).
The topics varied between generally positive topics describing
new evidence or advocating for the use of HPV vaccines; mixed
topics debating mainstream news media stories; and negative
topics
describing
safety
concerns,
conspiracies,
and
politics
(Fig. 2). A mainstream news media story related to a television pro-
gram had the strongest overall negative correlations with coverage
in females and males, and its highest proportional exposures were
found in states with lower coverage (Fig. 3). Generally positive
topics (describing evidence or advocating for the use of the vac-
cine) tended to reach much larger audiences than topics related
to safety concerns or conspiracies (Fig. 4). A newspaper story that
was retracted and replaced with evidence-based responses had the
strongest overall positive correlations with coverage in males, and
its highest proportional exposures were found in states with higher
coverage (Fig. 5).
3.2. Associations with HPV vaccine coverage
The percentage of the population without a Bachelor level
education, high school education, and health insurance were most
closely correlated with the proportions of females and males aged
13–17 in each state who had received at least one dose of HPV vac-
cine. No other socioeconomic factors were found to be significantly
correlated with coverage. Among the topic exposure factors, the
topics that exhibited consistently high correlations with HPV vac-
cine coverage across both males and females were related to main-
stream news media events and issues, safety concerns, and
conspiracies. Positive topics (reporting evidence and advocacy)
had weaker correlations with coverage.
Fig. 3. The state level proportional topic exposures for Topic 9 (the Katie Couric controversy). Topic 9 exposures made up between 3.79% (Rhode Island) and 11.1% (Arkansas)
of exposures in each state and exhibited a strong negative correlation with HPV vaccine coverage.

United States. Vaccine (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.060
 Models constructed using only socioeconomic factors explained
40% and 42% of the variance in initiation (at least one dose) for
females and males, respectively, while models constructed using
only topic exposure factors explained 63% and 68% of the variance
in initiation (Table 1).
The differences between models that used socioeconomic fac-
tors and models that used topic exposure factors was more pro-
nounced for initiation compared to completion (Fig. 6). When
modeling initiation, the topic exposure models were able to
explain an additional 25% of the variance in coverage compared
to the models based on socioeconomic factors, for both females
and males (Table 1). The increases for models of completion was
lower; 17% and 12% in females and males, respectively.
When the socioeconomic factors and the topic exposure factors
were combined, they marginally improved models in comparison
to those that used topic exposure alone (Fig. 6). Models that com-
bined socioeconomic factors and topic exposure factors explained
±1% of the variance in coverage compared to the models that only
used topic exposure factors (Table 1).
4. Discussion
The results showed a strong correlation between HPV vaccine
coverage and exposure to certain topics on Twitter, often negative
topics that expressed concerns about safety or related to conspira-
cies. While socioeconomic and health factors are expected to cap-
ture differences in access to healthcare, proxies for information
diets derived from social media data account for more of the vari-
ance in coverage, and thus appear to capture acceptance in a way
that socioeconomic factors do not. The results also showed that
HPV vaccine coverage is most closely correlated with topics that
were covered in mainstream news media, suggesting a relationship
between the quality of information in broader public discourse and
vaccine acceptance.
Other studies that have measured differences in the rates of cov-
erage across populations have found that coverage varies by race
and ethnicity, income, education, and interactions with the health
system [20–22]. Our results were consistent with these studies in
relation to insurance, education, and poverty–correlations were

 identified between HPV vaccine coverage reported in the National
Immunization Survey in 2014 and 2015, and education, income,
and insurance data from US Census in 2014. The results were not
aligned with these studies in relation to race or ethnicity—we found
no significant correlations between HPV vaccine coverage reported
in the National Immunization Survey in 2014 and 2015 and the pro-
portions of Black and African American people or the proportion of
Hispanic people of any race from the US Census. However, because
our models were state level aggregates and previous studies were
conducted within individual states and considered patient-level
receipts of the HPV vaccine, the results are not directly comparable.
A previous study used Twitter data to predict county-level heart
disease mortality by sampling and counting tweets without search-
ing for terms related to the application domain [36]. Rather than
counting the number of tweets in a topic, we examined exposure
by collecting data about Twitter followers, and only used tweets
that were directly relevant to HPV vaccines. While the results are
not directly comparable, both studies identified correlations that

of Columbia) of exposures in each state and exhibited a strong positive correlation with HPV vaccine coverage.

Please cite this article in press as: Dunn AG et al. Mapping information exposure on social media to explain differences in HPV vaccine coverage in the
United States. Vaccine (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.060
 matched expectations and prior evidence—topics related to nega-
tive emotions like anger and stress were positively associated with
heart disease mortality; and here topics related to harms, side
effects, and conspiracies were negatively associated with HPV vac-
cine coverage.
Our methods may be used to generate further hypotheses about
why people who choose not to vaccinate tend to be geographically
clustered [10,38–40]. While opinions are known to cluster within
communities through homophily and contagion, there has been lit-
tle research previously to examine how the effect of external influ-
ences such as news and social media may be localized by
community and location. The results also help reveal the limits
and biases implicit in sampling information exposure via social
media and suggest that even without accounting for sampling
biases, proxies for information diets derived from Twitter data
may be used as a signal of health behaviors that are otherwise dif-
ficult or costly to measure.
Routine systems that monitor exposure to relevant topics could
be constructed to identify locations where misinformation or low-
quality evidence is over-represented in the news media, and guide
public health interventions to amplify high-quality evidence and
guide social media interventions [2]. More precise identification
of the safety concerns, misinformation, and conspiracies that are
important to a segment of the public could provide a basis from
which to construct targeted and cost-effective news and social
media based interventions.
4.1. Limitations
Twitter users may not be representative of the general popula-
tion and some Twitter users represent entities other than individ-
uals, including organizations and non-human users. However, the
relationship is measured between the representation of evidence
and misinformation in the public domain and vaccination cover-
age,
rather
than
an
individual-level
prediction
of
vaccine
decision-making by population. Second, the method also relied
on self-reported locations from Twitter users, which captures
around half of the users that may have been exposed to evidence
and misinformation. This is a standard approach but it could be
improved through location and demographic inference methods
(see Supplementary Material). Third, the study did not consider
temporal patterns in exposure to topics corresponding with
changes in coverage between 2014 and 2015, which limits the abil-
ity to conclude about whether changes in information exposure
were lagging or leading indicators of decision-making in the popu-
lation. Fourth, recommendations for two dose models were intro-
duced in 2016 and we considered survey data for one dose and
three doses in 2014 and 2015, relating those to initiation and com-
pletion. Future epidemiological analyses would need to consider
these changes. Finally, socioeconomic factors were selected based
on a literature review of the evidence about observed differences
in recipients of vaccines but there may be other measurable socioe-
conomic and health factors correlated with HPV vaccine coverage
that were not included in the analysis.

 5. Conclusions
Measures of exposure to HPV related tweets explained more of
the variance in state level HPV vaccine coverage than was
explained by socioeconomic factors. Our study suggests that in
states where negative opinions about HPV vaccines are popular-
ized by mainstream media, the coverage is often lower than would
be expected by socioeconomic differences alone. These differences
suggest that news media may reflect, amplify, or influence vaccine
acceptance, and that measures of information exposure derived
from Twitter may be a surrogate indicators for localized differences
in acceptance.
