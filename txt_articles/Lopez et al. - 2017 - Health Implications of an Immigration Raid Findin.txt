Abstract
Immigration raids exemplify the reach of
immigration law enforcement into the lives of Latino
community members, yet little research characterizes the
health effects of these raids. We examined the health
implications of an immigration raid that resulted in multiple
arrests and deportations and occurred midway through a
community survey of a Latino population. We used linear
regression following principal axis factoring to examine the
influence of raid timing on immigration enforcement stress
and self-rated health. We controlled for age, sex, relation-
ship status, years in the county in which the raid occurred,
children in the home, and nativity. 325 participants com-
pleted the survey before the raid and 151 after. Completing
the survey after the raid was associated with higher levels of
immigration enforcement stress and lower self-rated health
scores. Findings indicate the negative impact of immigra-
tion raids on Latino communities. Immigration discussions
should include holistic assessments of health.

 immigration
status
disclosure—which
could
lead
to
deportation—decreases health care and social service uti-
lization [2, 4–7]. Local police collaboration with federal
immigration law enforcement exacerbates distrust between
local law enforcement and community members, decreas-
ing the likelihood that undocumented immigrants will
report crimes, even if they are the victims [8–10]. Constant
surveillance and scrutiny of immigration status transforms
public space into an area of heightened risk, and undocu-
mented immigrants become less likely to walk their chil-
dren to school, visit parks or the grocery store, and
participate in a range of sociocultural activities [11–14].
Taken together, a growing body of research illustrates the
direct and indirect effects of immigration law enforcement
and policy on the health of undocumented immigrants and
the communities in which they live.
Quasi-experimental studies have considered shifts in
health-related behaviors after immigration policy change.
Findings suggest that policies requiring individuals to
provide evidence of immigration status limit access to
resources, whether or not individuals are undocumented.
For example, after the passage of the Alabama Taxpayer
and Citizen Protection Act, which required proof of citi-
zenship to receive public benefits, Latinas were less likely
to utilize county health services. This included services
exempt from residency requirements, such as treatment for
STIs [15, 16]. Similarly, following the passage of Arizona
Senate Bill 1070 (SB 1070), which gave police the power
to detain individuals who could not verify citizenship,
Mexican-origin adolescent mothers were less likely to use
public assistance or take their infants to receive medical
care [17]. SB 1070 also increased fear of immigration
enforcement,
restricted
neighborhood
mobility,
and
decreased trust in law enforcement, with impacts on health
[11].
These quasi-experimental studies present strong evi-
dence of the immediate repercussions of immigration pol-
icy on health. However, a focus on state level policies in
states with omnibus anti-immigrant legislation omits the
daily immigration enforcement events that are ubiquitous
in mixed status immigrant communities [18] but are not
often covered by mainstream media. Immigration home
raids, in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) agents enter a residence to detain undocumented
immigrants, represent extreme examples of immigration
law enforcement with emerging evidence of their influence
on health [19–21]. A typical home raid occurs in the pre-
dawn hours when occupants are sleeping. Agents, often
with guns drawn and wearing body armor, surround the
house, pound on doors, and enter the home after receiving
consent, though reports of consent differ [22]. Other indi-
viduals suspected of being undocumented may be taken as
‘‘collateral’’ arrests, a process rooted in racial profiling
[23]. These arrests frequently include witnesses, often
children [10, 14, 19, 20, 22, 24–30]. Despite the effects of
these raids on health however, they have received scant
attention in the health literature, often mentioned as one of
many aspects of increased immigration enforcement [11].
The current study addresses this gap in the literature by
building upon the quasi-experimental designs of previous
public health work to investigate the influence of an
immigration raid on the health of a Latino/a (henceforth:
Latino) community in the Midwestern US. We consider the
effects of an immigration raid on a de facto mixed-use
property, in which multiple individuals were arrested and
deported. Three months before the raid, we began data
collection for the Encuesta Buenos Vecinos (EBV; ‘‘Good
Neighbors Survey’’) to investigate the social determinants
of health among Latinos in the county. The survey data
thus provide a unique opportunity for a natural experiment
in which we investigate the effects of a federal/local
immigration raid on health in a state that has not passed
omnibus anti-immigrant policy (Michigan). Understanding
these effects may better prepare health professionals to
respond to crises and mitigate the damage to health that
occurs following immigration enforcement.
Methods
Washtenaw County, MI, has a population of over 12,000
Latinos [31] (about 3.5 % of the population), yet Latinos
are frequently underrepresented in county-level data [32].
To gain a more accurate depiction of the health of the
Washtenaw County Latino population, collaborators at the
University of Michigan, Washtenaw County Public Health
Department, and Casa Latina, a community-based organi-
zation engaged with the local Latino community, designed
and implemented the EBV. Community partners were
involved in the creation and review of the EBV instrument,
and feedback following the pilot phase was used to shape
survey implementation. The University of Michigan’s
Institutional Review Board approved the research.
The EBV queried a range of topics, including health-
related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors; access
to health care; sources of health information; family and
child health; and social and neighborhood conditions [32].
Although the study was not designed to capture the effects
of immigration raids specifically, it did aim to address
issues of concern related to immigration and immigration
law enforcement.
The survey was conducted in Spanish or English, online
or face-to-face, by trained members of the local Latino
community. Inclusion criteria included being 18 years of
age or older, identifying as ‘‘Hispanic or Latino/a,’’ and
living in Washtenaw County. A total of 487 Latinos

 participated in the survey from September 2013 to January
2014. An immigration raid occurred about halfway through
the data collection period, resulting in 325 participants who
completed the survey before and 151 who completed the
survey after the raid.
The Raid
On the evening of November 7, 2013, a joint task force
composed of agents from ICE and the County Sheriff’s
Department conducted an immigration raid on a two-story
warehouse unit not zoned for residential use that was
converted into a mechanic shop on the first floor and living
quarters on the second floor. The Sherriff’s Department
utilized a special weapons and tactics (SWAT) unit
because of the belief that firearms and drugs may be pre-
sent in the facility. The mechanic shop was well known to
and utilized by many local residents up to the day of the
raid.
Several members of a local immigration advocacy
organization,
the
Washtenaw
Interfaith
Coalition
for
Immigrant Rights (WICIR [19]), were notified by members
of the community of the raid, which was preceded by
ongoing arrests of Latinos throughout the day, and arrived
on the scene to witness events and support the individuals
present. By multiple accounts, including testimony of those
in the facility when the raid occurred, WICIR volunteers
present
immediately
after
the
raid,
and
information
obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request,
three women, four children under the age of five, and
multiple men were in the facility when it was raided.
Agents pushed in a door, breaking the lock, and ordered the
women to the floor at gunpoint while two were holding
infants in their arms. Multiple men were detained and later
deported. Three days later, approximately 40 community
members, including the women involved in the raid and
multiple authors of the current study, attended a commu-
nity gathering at a local church. The women described their
treatment by officers and their fears of the psychological
repercussions that witnessing the raid could have on their
children. Community members and advocates agreed to re-
engage the Sheriff’s office in order to discuss how to
rebuild trust between the community and local police.
Measures
Independent variable: Raid timing
We created an inde-
pendent variable (raid timing) based on whether partici-
pants completed the EBV before or after the day of the raid
(0 = before, 1 = after). The EBV includes data from 487
completed surveys. We excluded five participants whose
surveys were completed on the day of the raid and six
participants whose completion date was unknown. The
analyses
represent
476 individuals,
325 participating
before the raid and 151 afterward.
Immigration enforcement stress and self-rated health
(SRH)
We utilized three survey measures originally
intended to capture day-to-day stress related to immigra-
tion enforcement: ‘‘My legal status has limited my contact
with family and friends,’’ ‘‘I will be reported to immigra-
tion if I go to a social service agency,’’ and ‘‘I fear the
consequences of deportation.’’ The first two items were
adapted from the acculturative stress scale of the 2012
National Latino and Asian American Study [33], and the
third was created by the EBV team. Participants responded
to each item on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree). Thus, higher scores (more agreement)
represent a stronger negative influence of immigration
enforcement on participants’ day-to-day lives.
Secondly, we utilize a measure of self-rated health to
which participants responded on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5
(excellent). SRH has been shown to be strongly and consis-
tently associated with mortality [34], with even stronger
associations in recent decades [35]. Conceptually, SRH is
proposed to capture a state of ‘‘the human body and mind’’ (p.
307) that takes into consideration physiological sensations,
comparison groups, and health behaviors. More pertinent to
the current study, research has considered how SRH is linked
to social capital (such as trust among neighbors or norms of
reciprocity) [36], with lower SRH scores related to less social
capital. Associations between SRH and mortality have been
found in Latino subsamples, though the relationships appear
to be moderated by acculturation [37] and language [38].
Demographics
We use standard demographic variables
including sex (0 = female), age in years (continuous), and
relationship status (0 = not in a relationship) as well as
variables that assess language ability (English communication
skills, language spoken with friends, and language spoken
with family) and nativity (0 = born outside of the US). Lastly,
we include two variables that assess participant ties to the
community where the raid occurred, including years in
Washtenaw County and presence of children in the home (0 =
no). Immigration status was not directly assessed because of
concerns for the vulnerability of survey participants.
Analysis
Pairwise correlation was used to examine the relationships
among the three immigration enforcement stress measures,
SRH, sex, nativity, the presence of children in the home,
and raid timing. We utilized two linear regression models
with (1) the intensity of immigration enforcement stress,
and (2) self-rated health as outcome variables. To create
the outcome variable for the first model, we used principle
704
J Immigrant Minority Health (2017) 19:702–708
123
 axis factoring of the three immigration enforcement stress
measures to create a single factor that captures the intensity
of immigration enforcement on participants’ day-to-day
lives. We control for age, sex, relationship status, years in
Washtenaw County, children in the home, and nativity.
Results
Table 1 presents characteristics for the sample in full and
stratified by raid timing. Fully 57.4 % of participants were
female
and
the
mean
age
was
36.6 years
(SD = 13.7 years). The mean length of US residence was
15.3 years (SD = 10.9 years) and of county residence was
9.1 years (SD = 7.6 years). The mean self-rated health
score was 3.6 (SD = 1.1), or between ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘very
good.’’ Participants were more likely to speak Spanish than
English with friends and with family. Over half of partic-
ipants had children under the age of 18 in their homes. The
majority of the sample (84.3 %) was born outside of the
US, mostly in Mexico (36.8 %) or Central America
(24.4 %) (not shown). While the recruitment strategy did
not change, there were differences in the study sample
before and after that raid. Those who completed the survey
after the raid were younger by about 5.5 years and were
less likely to be foreign-born (Table 1). Nonparametric
tests showed that participants who completed the survey
after the raid were also more likely to participate on-line
(vs. hard copy), Z = 4.29, p \ 0.001, and in English (vs.
Spanish), Z = 2.01, p = 0.045.
Pairwise correlation analysis
Immigration enforcement
stress measures correlated strongly, and were significantly
higher after the raid, for those born abroad and for those
with children in the home (Table 2).
Multivariate models
Principle axis factoring of the three
immigration enforcement stress measures resulted in one
factor with an Eigenvalue of 2.1, with each item having a
factor loading greater than 0.8. We consider this factor to be a
measure of the intensity of immigration enforcement stress.
Linear regression of this factor while controlling for age, sex,
relationship status, years in the county, children in the home,
and nativity indicated that raid timing was significantly
associated with immigration enforcement stress such that
those who completed the survey after the raid reported higher
levels of immigration enforcement stress (Table 3: model 1).
Having children in the home and being born outside of the
US were associated with higher levels of immigrant
enforcement stress. The second model indicated that raid
timing was also significantly associated with self-rated
health. That is, completing the survey after the raid was
associated with a 0.4 unit decline in SRH (Table 3: model 2).
Discussion
The current natural experiment demonstrates the impact of
an immigration raid on the health of a Latino community in
the Midwestern US. Results show that participants who
completed the EBV survey after the raid reported higher
levels of immigration enforcement stress and lower SRH
scores, despite a lower percentage of foreign-born partici-
pants completing the survey after the raid. Our analyses
present strong evidence of the negative influence of
immigration raids both directly and indirectly on the lives
and health of Latinos in the communities in which raids
occur.
Previous studies noted that deportation fear is related to
psychological and emotional distress and lower SRH scores
[1, 2]. Although we did not explicate the mechanism by
which a raid could influence SRH, we found that partici-
pants who completed the survey after the raid reported
feeling less free to interact with their social networks, less
able to use government services, and increasingly fearful of
the consequences of deportation (Table 2). Thus, we sug-
gest that participants would be correspondingly less likely
to move about and engage with their communities,
reflecting a reduction in social capital [36] that may be
related to lower SRH scores. Future research is needed to
investigate this mechanism.
Immigration raids, acute events that may have imme-
diate effects on communities, occur within populations
who experience an inequitable need for support services
and may thus exacerbate health inequities. We recommend
that health researchers broaden our conversations about
immigration enforcement and its health implications. It is
critical that researchers continue to investigate the direct
effects of immigration enforcement on the individuals who
experience it—such as the depression, anxiety, and trauma
engendered by one’s arrest, deportation, or witness to a
raid. However, we must also consider how enforcement
actions tear at the fabric of US society, alienating immi-
grant and US born Latinos alike by discouraging them from
integration and the utilization of services to which they are
entitled.
Lastly, our results indicate that having children in the
home and being born outside of the US were associated
with higher levels of immigration enforcement stress.
Maintaining a healthy community requires access to pre-
ventative health services, yet fear of accessing these ser-
vices
may
increase
in
the
wake
of
immigration
enforcement actions. Members of the community who may
already be marginalized and vulnerable—foreign-born
women with children in the home—may be less likely to
seek out these services following immigration raids. Thus,
community health advocates need to work diligently to

 ensure separation between immigration enforcement and
social service provisioning.
Limitations
Though this study has a number of strengths, including the
natural experiment design and community-based data col-
lection, there are limitations. First, this study is cross-
sectional, and thus we are unable to discern if differences
in item scores before versus after the raid are the result of
within-individual
differences.
However,
quantitative
research on immigration raids is extremely challenging—if
not impossible—to conduct longitudinally due in part to
the purposefully unpredictable nature of these raids. The
novel approach used in this study speaks to the importance
of
community-based
collaborations
that
encourage

 awareness of community events and existing community
data. Secondly, it is not known how well these results gen-
eralize to other raids. Although many facets of this raid
resemble those reported nationwide [22], including the
presence of numerous heavily armored officers who yelled
commands and pointed weapons at individuals who were
not the targets of the raid, there are differences. Most
notably was the use of a SWAT unit who entered the facility
without gaining consent, as is required in ICE raids. Also,
the building in which the raid occurred was not zoned for
residence, but families inhabited it nonetheless. Typical
immigration home raids likely occur at traditional homes in
residential neighborhoods. However, given the intensity and
violence of immigration raids, we argue that the detrimental
effects on community and individual health are likely to be
similar despite differing environmental circumstances.
Third, we are unable to discern if results are attributable to
other events occurring around the same time. However, the
advocacy group responding to the raid also staffs an ‘‘urgent
responder’’ phone that assists members of the community
with immigration related emergencies, and no other calls for
events of this magnitude were recorded during this period.
We note that immigration reform was heavily discussed in
the media at the time, and it is possible that a particular story
was salient around the month of the raid. For example, many
individuals were possibly aware that the US House of Rep-
resentatives would be voting on bills that included legislative
changes that could affect their or their families’ immigration
statuses or increase border militarization. For this reason and
others, future research using quantitative and qualitative data
is needed to investigate to what extent raids are distin-
guishable from other immigration law enforcement activi-
ties, events, or media discussions.
Conclusion
This raid was an extreme example of an immigration law
enforcement effort that was unpredictable to the com-
munity in which it occurred, incorporated overt milita-
rized displays of power, and included an invasion of
personal space. Results show that completing the com-
munity survey after the raid was associated with higher
levels of immigration enforcement stress and lower self-
rated health scores. Although novel to the literature, due
to the overt violence and trauma of these raids, the results
are perhaps not surprising. As immigration policy con-
tinues to be a topic of national debate, we must include in
these conversations a holistic assessment of the social cost
of enforcement policies, including how they may exac-
erbate existing health inequities among marginalized
populations.
