Health Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of Brief Clinician 
Tobacco Counseling for Youth and Adults
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE To help clinicians and care systems determine the priority for tobacco 
counseling in busy clinic schedules, we assessed the lifetime health and economic 
value of annually counseling youth to discourage smoking initiation and of annu-
ally counseling adults to encourage cessation.
METHODS We conducted a microsimulation analysis to estimate the health 
impact and cost effectiveness of both types of tobacco counseling in a US birth 
cohort of 4,000,000. The model used for the analysis was constructed from 
nationally representative data sets and structured literature reviews.
RESULTS Compared with no tobacco counseling, the model predicts that annual 
counseling for youth would reduce the average prevalence of smoking cigarettes 
during adult years by 2.0 percentage points, whereas annual counseling for 
adults will reduce prevalence by 3.8 percentage points. Youth counseling would 
prevent 42,686 smoking-attributable fatalities and increase quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) by 756,601 over the lifetime of the cohort. Adult counseling would 
prevent 69,901 smoking-attributable fatalities and increase QALYs by 1,044,392. 
Youth and adult counseling would yield net savings of $225 and $580 per per-
son, respectively. If annual tobacco counseling was provided to the cohort during 
both youth and adult years, then adult smoking prevalence would be 5.5 per-
centage points lower compared with no counseling, and there would be 105,917 
fewer smoking-attributable fatalities over their lifetimes. Only one-third of the 
potential health and economic benefits of counseling are being realized at cur-
rent counseling rates.
CONCLUSIONS Brief tobacco counseling provides substantial health benefits while 
producing cost savings. Both youth and adult intervention are high-priority uses 
of limited clinician time.

INTRODUCTION
A
dult smoking prevalence fell 2 percentage points from 17% in 2014 
to 15.3% in 2015 (age adjusted).1 Yet 42 million adults continue to 
smoke,2 and in 2015, 1.6 million middle- and high-school students 
self-reported smoking tobacco in the last 30 days.3 A 2014 Surgeon Gen-
eral’s report summarizing 50 years of progress in the fight against smoking 
noted that smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the 
United States and that the direct medical costs of smoking are about $175 
billion per year.2
In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reaffirmed 
its long-standing, evidence-based recommendation that clinicians ask 
adults about tobacco use, provide advice to stop, and offer smoking cessa-
tion medications.4 In adults, brief, one-time counseling alone may increase 
cessation rates by 2 percentage points, and by 5 to 16 percentage points 
when adults use smoking cessation medications.4,5
On the other hand, counseling youth to prevent initiation might yield 
even greater benefits than counseling adults to quit. Former smokers 
remain at some risk for smoking-attributable disease; therefore, primary

prevention of tobacco use through youth counsel-
ing may yield greater benefits long-term. Evidence 
supporting clinical interventions to prevent youth 
initiation has lagged behind that for adult cessation 
counseling. In 2003, a USPSTF review concluded 
there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or 
against routine screening to prevent smoking initia-
tion by youth.6 In 2013 new evidence7 resulted in a 
USPSTF recommendation that primary care clinicians 
provide education or brief counseling to prevent initia-
tion of tobacco use in school-aged children and ado-
lescents.8 Such counseling reduces youth initiation by 
2 percentage points.7,8
Although counseling and smoking cessation 
medications are effective, the impact of repeatedly 
offering counseling and assistance has not been evalu-
ated in controlled studies. Health benefits and cost 
reductions are likely to start years after counseling for 
adults and decades after counseling for youth. Hence, 
no direct health benefits have been observed in stud-
ies. Even though the long-term health and economic 
impact of repeated cessation counseling for adults has 
been assessed in simulation models,9,10 the impact of 
counseling youth to discourage initiation of cigarette 
smoking has not; neither has the combined lifetime 
impact of counseling youth that was followed up by 
encouraging cessation among those who still become 
adult smokers.
Assessing the complete benefits and costs of 
tobacco cessation counseling is essential to determine 
its priority among competing demands on clinic time. 
Tobacco counseling competes with treatment of acute 
symptoms, management of multiple chronic diseases, 
and other preventive services, as well as suggestions 
to integrate clinical practice with community health 
organizations and to coordinate with community 
health workers to address patients’ social determi-
nants of health.11-20 Yarnall and colleagues estimated 
that a physician with a panel of 2,500 patients would 
need 7.4 hours per day to deliver evidence-based 
preventive services21 and as many as 10.6 hours to 
provide disease management for chronic conditions.22 
Though Altschuler et al estimated that a physician 
could care for a panel of 2,000 patients with the 
maximum feasible delegation of preventive services 
and chronic disease care to other primary care team 
members,23 that level of delegation may be a long 
time coming.
To help clinicians and care systems better under-
stand tobacco counseling’s priority among the com-
peting demands on physician time, we simulated the 
long-term value of providing brief, annual tobacco 
intervention during both youth and adult years over 
the lifetimes of a US birth cohort.
METHODS
We simulated scenarios with and without the brief 
tobacco interventions recommended by the USPSTF 
for youth and adults using the HealthPartners Institute 
ModelHealth: Tobacco microsimulation model, which 
was constructed in TreeAge Pro 2014 R2.0 (TreeAge 
Software, Inc) to evaluate the impact of clinic- and 
community-based interventions to reduce cigarette 
smoking. The analysis follows the methodology chosen 
by the National Commission on Prevention Priorities 
(NCPP) for the accompanying ranking of clinical pre-
ventive services (Prevention Priorities).24 Prevention 
Priorities is based on 2 metrics: clinical preventable 
burden and cost-effectiveness. Clinical preventable 
burden measures the health impact of offering a clini-
cal service to 100% of the target population in undis-
counted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. 
Cost-effectiveness is measured as discounted net costs 
per discounted QALY gained when net costs are posi-
tive; it is measured as costs saved per person in a birth 
cohort when net costs are negative. Here we report 
clinical preventable burden and cost-effectiveness 
along with smoking-attributable disease events, fatali-
ties, and medical costs prevented.
For constancy across services assessed for the 
accompanying ranking of clinical preventive services,24 
all costs were adjusted to year 2012 US dollars, and 
costs and QALYs were discounted to present value at 
3% per year in calculating cost-effectiveness.25 QALYs 
are not discounted in the calculation of clinical pre-
ventable burden.
Intervention Scenarios
For Prevention Priorities,24 we separately estimated 
annual youth counseling and annual adult counseling 
intervention scenarios and compared them with no 
provision of counseling for the corresponding age-
group. In keeping with the evidence, youth counsel-
ing is limited to the impact on preventing initiation. 
Adult counseling is focused on encouraging cessation 
through the 5As (ask about tobacco use, advise to quit, 
assess willingness to quit, assist with quit, and arrange 
follow-up),26 including smoking cessation medications. 
We describe how these intervention scenarios were 
implemented in the model.
For context, we assessed a third scenario of youth 
and adult counseling, which reflects the complete 
impact of first counseling youth to prevent initiation 
and subsequently counseling those who become adult 
smokers to quit. We compare this scenario with the 
counterfactual no-counseling scenario to estimate the 
combined impact of youth and adult counseling com-
pared with providing no counseling. We also compared 
this combined service with a current delivery rate

scenario to estimate the potential impact of increasing 
delivery of lifelong counseling.
Microsimulation
We conducted ModelHealth: Tobacco simulations 
that began with a cohort of children aged 8 years 
representative of the US population in terms of sex 
and race-ethnicity. When the cohort reaches age 25 
years during the simulation, lifetime education level is 
assigned according to the educational attainment of 
today’s adults aged 25 years. ModelHealth: Tobacco 
is described in detail with all model parameters in 
the Supplemental Appendix, available at http://www.
annfammed.org/content/15/1/37/suppl/DC1. The model 
simulates the lifetime impact of cigarette smoking on 
health and economic outcomes. Simulated individuals 
begin as never smokers at age 8 years. Multivariate risk 
equations based on the Youth Behavior Risk Survey27 
and the National Health Interview Survey28 determine 
the probability that they will become smokers each 
year, and if they do, the probability that they will 
become former smokers in subsequent years.
The incidence of smoking-attributable disease 
events was derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiol-
ogy, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National 
Cancer Institute,29 the National Hospital Discharge 
Survey,30 and compressed mortality files.31 Total dis-
ease events by smoking status are derived by apply-
ing sex-specific smoking-attributable relative risks 
for 10 cancers, 6 cardiovascular disease categories, 
and 3 respiratory diseases obtained from Smoking-
Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economic Costs 
(SAMMEC), an online resource maintained by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for esti-
mating the burden of cigarette smoking.32 Additional 
detail on the calculation of QALYs, including event 
rates, event duration, and health utilities, are provided 
in the Supplemental Appendix.
We estimated medical costs by smoking status in 
linked Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 
and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data33 
according to the method of Levy and Newhouse.34 
MEPS and other claims data, however, show that 
former smokers have higher health care expenditures 
than current smokers, perhaps because quits are fre-
quently triggered by symptoms of smoking-related 
disease.35-40 Hence, estimates derived from claims data 
overstate the costs of former smokers who quit with 
counseling before the onset of smoking-attributable 
disease. We therefore estimated the costs of former 
smokers with an exponential function (described in 
the Supplemental Appendix) that defines the differ-
ence in risk between current and former smokers in 
relation to time since quit.
Effectiveness in Counseling Scenarios
To obtain an estimate of effectiveness for youth coun-
seling, we reviewed studies identified in the USPSTF 
systematic review.7 We excluded 3 studies41-43 because 
their measures of youth smoking were inconsistent 
with those in the simulation model. We excluded 
another study44 because the tobacco intervention was 
just 1 aspect of an intensive intervention that targeted 
a range of substance abuse and sexual health behav-
iors. Among the remaining 6 studies,45-50 the average 
relative risk for initiation among youth who received 
counseling was 0.80 compared with no- or minimal-
intervention control groups.
In the simulation, smoking is reduced through 
increased receipt of brief counseling and cessation 
medications. ModelHealth: Tobacco assigns smokers 
to 1 of 6 quit strategies: no assistance, brief counseling 
alone, over-the-counter nicotine-replacement therapy, 
prescription nicotine-replacement therapy with brief 
counseling, bupropion with brief counseling, or vareni-
cline with brief counseling. With brief cessation coun-
seling provided to all smokers, the 51% of smokers who 
would have tried to quit without clinician advice are 
reassigned to 1 of the other 5 quit strategies in propor-
tion to the uptake of that strategy in the current US 
population.51 The success of quitting with counseling 
and medication was determined by the relative risk of 
cessation compared with no assistance. We obtained 
the relative risk of cessation when using nicotine-
replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline com-
pared with placebo (relative risk [RR] = 1.60, 1.69, and 
2.27, respectively) from a network meta-analysis.52 The 
effectiveness of brief counseling alone was based on the 
median relative risk (RR = 1.32) of cessation compared 
with no intervention among 13 studies in our previous 
review and 1 additional study published since then.9,53
No Counseling (Counterfactual) Scenarios
Constructing counterfactual scenarios of an environ-
ment without counseling required careful consider-
ation. Available data suggest that the frequency of 
anti-initiation counseling for youth is very low. Most 
nationally representative frequencies of clinician coun-
seling for youth are based on the National Hospital 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) and the 
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), 
for which providing any information about tobacco 
counted as counseling, and encouraging abstinence was 
not distinguished from encouraging cessation.54 Based 
on these surveys, Rand et al reported that tobacco use 
was discussed in 13.3% of well visits and 8.5% of acute 
illness visits for patients aged 11 to 21 years from 1997 
to 2000.55 Based on NAMCS, Jamal et al reported that 
screening for tobacco use occurred in 70% of office vis-

its for patients aged 11 to 21 years during 2004 to 2010, 
but assistance for cessation was provided in only 20% of 
smokers’ visits.54 Because nationally representative esti-
mates of counseling to prevent initiation are not avail-
able, and the limited data on youth counseling indicate 
it is uncommon, we assumed that current youth smok-
ing patterns approximate no counseling, and we used 
the current delivery scenario as the counterfactual to 
represent no youth counseling. Counseling to encour-
age adult cessation is common.51,56,57 We therefore cre-
ated a no-cessation counseling scenario for adults by 
assigning all smokers to the no-assistance quit strategy.
Counseling and Medication Costs
The costs of annual counseling used in the analysis 
were $35 for youth and $26 for adults, including the 
cost of patient or parent time. We applied costs con-
sistently across preventive services in the ranking.24 
Youth counseling costs reflect 1 minute of brief anti-
tobacco use message from a physician and 20 minutes 
with a health educator, based on averages among the 
6 studies represented in the effectiveness estimate.45-50 
We added $5 per patient for printed educational mate-
rials or computerized information. We simplified the 
implementation of adult counseling costs in the model 
by assigning all patients 3 minutes of clinician time 
for assessing tobacco use and counseling. Nonsmokers 
(more than 80% of visits) will require much less time, 
and smokers interested in quitting with a smoking ces-
sation medication and willing to arrange follow-up will 
require more. Although the average time should fall 
with decreased smoking prevalence, this effect is not 
accounted for in the simulation.
We valued physician time as the portion of a 
15-minute office visit (1/15th for youth and 3/15th for 
adults) using the average of Medicare reimbursement 
and 75% of the median private sector charge.58 Health 
educator time is valued using the average hourly earn-
ings for Bureau of Labor Statistics occupation code 
21-1091,59 plus an additional 50% for employee benefits 
and overhead. Finally, following the reference case 
methods of the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health 
and Medicine,25 we include patient time for adults and 
parent time to accompany youth. For patient or parent 
time, we assume a visit takes 2 hours including travel, 
but we attribute only a portion to tobacco counseling, 
based on the number of minutes of a 15-minute visit 
spent on tobacco counseling. Patient time was valued 
using average hourly earnings of $31 per hour in 2012.60
The costs of over-the-counter nicotine-replacement 
therapy ($190), prescription nicotine-replacement ther-
apy ($790), bupropion ($181), and varenicline ($826) 
were determined from a convenience sample of online 
prices for the recommended 90-day treatment (www.
cvs.com, www.drugs.com, www.goodrx.com, www.
walmart.com, www.target.com). Over-the-counter 
nicotine-replacement therapy was priced as the aver-
age of patches and gum and assumed an equal mix of 
generic and brand use. We assumed 95% of bupropion 
use was generic and 5% was branded Zyban because 
of the large difference in price. Prescription nicotine-
replacement therapy (Niotrol inhaler) and varenicline 
(Chantix) were priced at their respective brands, 
because no generics are available. In the model, those 
with an unsuccessful quit attempt faced a portion of 
these costs, which varied randomly to reflect different 
quit attempt durations.
Sensitivity Analysis
In Prevention Priorities, estimates of clinical prevent-
able burden and cost-effectiveness are based upon 
a variety of sources ranging from literature-based 
estimates to detailed microsimulations.24 We planned 
sensitivity analysis to produce ranges of estimates that 
can be compared across preventive services regard-
less of the source of the clinical preventable burden 
and cost-effectiveness estimates. We first conducted 
single-variable sensitivity analysis. A single variable 
may encompass aggregates, such as changes to all 
quality-of-life weights at 1 time in the same direction. 
Then, we estimated a plausible range of upper and 
lower values for clinical preventable burden and cost-
effectiveness by combining the 2 to 3 most influential 
variables (depending on use of aggregates).
RESULTS
The model predicted that counseling youth will result 
in an additional 756,601 QALYs over the lifetime 
of a birth cohort of 4,000,000 people,61 with net 
discounted cost-savings of $225 per person. Adult 
counseling will produce 1,044,392 QALYs, with net 
savings of $580 per person (Table 1). Before discount-
ing, the costs of counseling youth aged 9 to18 years is 
similar to the combined costs of cessation counseling 
and smoking cessation medications for adult smokers 
(not shown), but discounting to present value results in 
adult counseling costs being substantially lower.
The combined youth and adult counseling scenario 
produced less benefit than the sum of its parts because 
youth counseling reduces the number of adult smokers 
who could benefit from cessation counseling (Table 2). 
The marginal analyses indicated that only about one-
half of the benefit of adult counseling and one-third 
of the benefit of adult and youth counseling combined 
would be realized if current counseling rates continue.
The 4 panels in Figure 1 illustrate the lifetime pat-
terns that underlie these results. Figure 1 shows the

41
prevalence of current smoking over the cohort’s life-
time under each scenario. The model predicts smoking 
prevalence will peak at 20.7% at age 25 years without 
counseling. At current rates of cessation counseling, 
peak smoking prevalence reduces to 18.5%. If coun-
seling against initiation were provided to all youth, 
prevalence would peak at 15.5%. If cessation counsel-
ing were provided to all adults, 
prevalence would peak at 16.8%. 
If counseling to reduce initia-
tion were provided during youth 
and followed up with cessation 
counseling for smokers during 
adulthood, the predicted peak 
prevalence would be only 13.7%. 
Averaged over all adult years, 
prevalence would be 2.0, 3.8, and 
5.5 percentage points lower with 
youth-only counseling, adult-
only counseling, and combined 
youth and adult counseling, 
respectively.
Consistent with the inputs 
from SAMMEC, the model does 
not assign smoking-attributable 
disease or medical costs before 
age 35 years. Figure 1 shows how, 
under this assumption, prevent-
ing early smoking-attributable 
fatalities increases late-age 
fatalities. Lifetime smoking-
attributable fatalities of the birth 
cohort, however, are still reduced by counseling, and 
QALYs gained remain positive at all ages (Figure 1) 
because more individuals are alive at all ages. Figure 
1 illustrates how the initial youth counseling costs 
are eventually offset by reduced smoking-attributable 
expenditures. Adult counseling and medication costs 
are incurred later and are spread more evenly through

than youth counseling costs.
Single-variable sensitivity analyses are shown in Fig-

tiveness, counseling costs, and smoking-attributable 
medical costs results in the clinical preventable burden

a When net costs are negative, cost-effectiveness is expressed as net cost per person. When net costs are positive, cost-effectiveness is expressed as net cost per QALY.
b Net costs are expressed as per person; therefore, changes in utility values do impact the estimate of cost-savings. 
c Disease risks and smoking costs are determined by smoking status independently from each other in the model. Changes to the risk of illness therefore do not impact 
cost-effectiveness.

expenditures on cessation medications in both the baseline and intervention scenarios. As result, the impact of changing baseline cessation probabilities on cost-
effectiveness is nonlinear.

(base case = 757,000). Simultaneously changing coun-
seling effectiveness, counseling costs, and smoking-
attributable medical costs results in a cost-effectiveness 
range from $1,285 saved per person to a net cost of 
$12,195/QALY saved (base case = $225 saved per per-
son). In multiple-variable sensitivity analysis for adult 
counseling, simultaneously changing baseline youth 
initiation and medication effectiveness results in clinical 
preventable burden ranging from 519,000 to 1,694,000 
QALYs saved (base case = 1,096,000). Simultaneously 
changing smoking-attributable costs, baseline youth 
initiation, and medication effectiveness results in cost-
effectiveness ranging from $210 to $1,676 saved per 
person (base case = $580 saved).
DISCUSSION
This article presents updated analysis of repeated coun-
seling for adult cessation and the first analysis of the 
value of youth counseling in the context of a relative 
ranking. The results suggest that counseling youth not 
to start smoking and counseling adults to quit should 
be a high-priority use of clinician time. In Prevention 
Priorities, both receive the highest possible scores for 
both clinical preventable burden and cost-effectiveness 
and the highest total score.24 Only 6 services were cost 
saving. The clinical preventable burden of some com-
mon preventive services was considerably lower, includ-
ing cervical cancer screening (268,000 QALYs saved), 
breast cancer screening (164,000), influenza immuniza-
tions (132,000), and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular 
pertussis vaccination for adolescents and adults (6,000).
We did not find that primary prevention (youth 
counseling) was more valuable than secondary preven-
tion (adult counseling). Both are clearly of high value. 
Youth counseling is less effective at reducing initiation 
than adult counseling and medication are at increasing 
cessation; youth counseling is provided to all persons, 
whereas adult counseling is targeted to smokers; and 
on average, youth counseling costs are not as heavily 
discounted to present value in the cost-effectiveness 
calculation.
Our results are consistent with the literature, 
though few economic analyses of counseling assess 
annual counseling and include reductions in smoking-
attributable medical expenditures. Using a compara-
tively simple compartmental model, we previously 
found adult tobacco counseling to be a top-ranking 
service but with greater cost savings ($842 per person 
in 2012 US dollars) and a higher clinically preventable 
burden (2,473,000 QALYs saved).9 The microsimula-
tion more accurately models the counterfactual of 
no counseling, leading to a lower clinical preventable 
burden and savings estimates. Feenstra et al estimated 
repeated brief interventions in the Dutch health care 
system.62 They found various low-intensity interven-
tions for adults to be cost-effective but not cost saving. 
Eddy et al assessed brief intervention repeated over 
10 years. They conservatively assumed each succes-
sive quit attempt had a lower success probability and 
included only the benefits of reducing cardiovascular 
disease, but they still found that intervention would 
cost only $3,000 per QALY.10
To our knowledge, we report the first estimates of 
the health impact and cost-effectiveness of both youth 
counseling alone and the combined impact of youth 
and adult counseling. Wang and Michael estimated that 
a hypothetical 1% reduction in youth smoking preva-
lence would produce 99,000 additional QALYs and 
save $1.2 billion over the lifetime of a cohort of stu-
dents in 7th to 12th grades.63 Youth interventions based 
in the in community, such as school-based tobacco 
education, appear to be very cost-effective.64-67
Although consistent with the literature, our mod-
eled estimates have meaningful limitations. First, 
the harms of secondhand smoke and deaths from 
smoking-caused residential fires are excluded. Second, 
the most recent Surgeon General’s report identified 
additional risks of tobacco use not yet incorporated 
into our model: diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, 
age-related macular degeneration, liver cancer, infant 
deaths, and failure of cancer treatment.2
We also did not account for electronic cigarettes 
because we had scarce data on their impact. Electronic 
cigarettes were the most frequently used tobacco 
product cited by middle- and high-school students in 
2015.3 Excluding electronic cigarettes assumes that any 
health harms from their increased use is exactly offset 
by any benefit of reduced cigarette use. Neither did we 
assess whether pregnancy increases the probability of 
a sustained quit with or without clinician counseling, 
or the impact of restricted use of cessation medications 
during pregnancy.
Perhaps most importantly, the literature does 
not indicate whether the effectiveness of counseling 
remains constant. We assumed no change in effective-
ness relative to no assistance, as repeated messages 
reinforce each other and aging smokers traverse stages 
of readiness to change. Our neutral assumption may 
overstate or understate the impact of repeated counsel-
ing. Also because of a lack of data, we assumed the use 
of smoking cessation medication among those newly 
counseled is the same as among those currently making 
quit attempts. If instead we assume no additional use of 
cessation medications, then both clinical preventable 
burden and cost savings of adult counseling would be 
nearly 50% lower, and its Prevention Priorities total 
score would be reduced by 1 point. These uncertain-

ties could be best addressed in long-term prospective 
studies of repeated counseling with careful recording 
of cessation medication use.
Despite limited precision, the results indicate 
that tobacco cessation counseling should be a high-
priority use of clinic resources. Systems improve-
ments may improve cessation counseling through 
standardized assessment forms,68 electronic health 
record prompts,69,70 and provider feedback.71-73 In a 
comprehensive approach to implementing counseling 
guidelines with systems changes, Katz et al combined 
provider feedback, registering tobacco use as a vital 
sign, offering free nicotine-replacement therapy and 
proactive counseling.74 Observed continuous absti-
nence at 6 months in intervention sites was nearly 3 
times higher than in control sites (10.9% vs 3.8%).
Perceived low effectiveness of counseling may fos-
ter the impression that tobacco use is better addressed 
by community-based interventions. In an informal 
comparison, Bao et al found cessation advice to adults 
as provided in usual care and community-based inter-
ventions, such as tobacco taxes and clean indoor air 
laws, to have similar impact.75 Likewise, the 2.0% aver-
age reduction in smoking prevalence we estimated to 
occur when increasing smoking cessation counseling to 
all adult smokers from current levels is similar to that 
produced by community-based interventions assessed 
using the same simulation model for the Community 
Health Advisor.76 Moreover, it seems likely (though 
unproven) that the 2 strategies have synergistic effects, 
magnifying that of either alone.
Estimated cost savings from counseling suggest 
that meaningful investments in clinic systems to 
improve population health through tobacco cessation 
counseling are possible without increasing long-term 
health care costs. Of course, with the investments 
being borne by clinics in the short term and the sav-
ings accruing to various insurers years later, we can-
not rely on the financial incentives from savings to 
make those investments happen. Payment systems that 
align financial incentives with the value of care system 
investments are necessary to realize the full poten-
tial of clinical tobacco cessation counseling. In the 
meantime, clinicians who wish to ensure their limited 
time with patients is well spent can be confident that 
evidence-based tobacco counseling can produce more 
meaningful improvements in population health with 
good stewardship of health care system resources than 
almost any other preventive service.
