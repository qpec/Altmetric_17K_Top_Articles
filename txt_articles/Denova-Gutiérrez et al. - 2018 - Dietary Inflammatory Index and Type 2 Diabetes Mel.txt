Abstract: Diet and inflammation are both associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the
present study, we aimed to assess the relation between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and
the presence of T2DM in Mexican adults participating in the Diabetes Mellitus Survey administered
in Mexico City (DMS-MC). The study involved 1174 subjects (48.5% men) between 20–69 years of
age. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was employed to evaluate dietary
intake and to compute DII. The DII is based on scientific evidence about the association between
dietary compounds and six established inflammatory biomarkers. Multivariate logistic regression
models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of DII
in relation to T2DM. Our results suggest that subjects in the highest quintile of the DII had higher
odds of T2DM (OR = 3.02; 95% CI: 1.39, 6.58; p = 0.005) compared to subjects in the lowest quintile
of DII scores. Assessing possible effect modification, an association with T2DM was evident when
comparing DII quintile 5 to quintile 1 for participants aged ≥ 55 years (OR = 9.77; 95% CI: 3.78, 25.50;
p = 0.001). These results suggest that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with significantly higher
odds of T2DM among adult Mexicans.

1. Introduction
Low-grade, systemic inflammation, which provides the substrate for many chronic diseases,
is characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [1]. Chronic systemic inflammation has been linked to non-communicable
diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [2]. Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) has become a serious public health problem, affecting 382 million people in 2013 [3] and had
led to a loss of approximately 64 million disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2015 [4]. Currently,

80% of people with T2DM live in low-income and middle-income countries [5]. In Mexico, T2DM
prevalence has reached 14.7% of the population and two million DALYs lost in 2013 [5,6].
Recent evidence indicates that risk factors can induce chronic inflammation, which are also related
with T2DM such as adiposity [7], a sedentary lifestyle [8], and diet [9]. In the past several decades,
certain individual dietary factors have been widely investigated regarding their association with
diabetes risk and inflammation, including high intake of saturated fatty acids, sugar-sweetened
beverages, and starchy food, combined with low consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole
grains [10]. More recently, alternative approaches have been used in order to capture the complicated
nutrient interactions and cumulative effects in the food matrix [11]. Based on evidence linking diet with
inflammation and chronic conditions such as T2DM, we used a literature-derived, population-based
dietary inflammatory index (DII) [12] to evaluate the potential inflammatory properties of diet. The DII
has been validated with different inflammatory biomarkers [13,14]. Furthermore, it has been associated
with components of metabolic syndrome [15], as well as a variety of chronic disease outcomes [16,17].
To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet explored the relation between the DII and T2DM
in a Mexican population. Thus, we aimed to explore the association between DII and the prevalence of
T2DM in adults participating in the Diabetes Mellitus Survey in Mexico City 2015 (DMS-MC 2015).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
The present analysis was conducted with data from the DMS-MC 2015, a cross-sectional
probabilistic population-based survey, designed and implemented by our group at the National
Institute of Public Health (INSP by its Spanish acronym), representative of adults aged 20–69 years
living in Mexico City. The DMS-MC 2015 sample was randomly stratified into clusters according to city
district. In the first stage, 16 primary sampling units were selected and by means of a probabilistic and
systematic sampling, six secondary sampling units were designated. Then, six houses per secondary
sampling unit were included. Finally, per household, we evaluated up to two adults between
20–69 years of age. Fasting venous blood samples were collected in a subsample of participants
randomly selected based on estimations of the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 [18].
For the present analysis, we excluded participants with >10% blank items on their food frequency
questionnaires, and who did not consume between 600 kcal and 5500 kcal daily (n = 10), determined
with the standard deviation method suggested by Rosner [19]. Additionally, we excluded participants
with incomplete biomarkers data or with missing information on other important covariates (n = 142).
Finally, we excluded those subjects with more than 12 months past their T2DM diagnosis date (n = 90).
A total of 1174 individuals were included in our final sample.
This study was managed according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. The Research,
Ethics and Biosecurity Committee at INSP reviewed and approved the study protocol (No. 1658) and
informed consent forms (No. B04). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.
2.2. Dietary Assessment
To assess dietary intake, a previously validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire
(SFFQ) [20] was used. The instrument describes the consumption of 140 foods over the past seven
days prior to the interview. For each food, a commonly used portion size was specified on the
SFFQ. Frequency of food consumption was characterized by set categories ranging from never to
six. First, frequency was expressed as times per day, but then was converted into portion size per
day. To compute the energy (kcal/day) and daily nutrient intake, we multiplied the frequency of
consumption of each food by the estimated nutrient content with a comprehensive database of food
contents, compiled by the INSP [21]. The SFFQ was administered by interviewers and were collected
by personnel trained using standardized data collection and entry procedures.

2.3. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) Assessment
SFFQ-derived dietary data was used to calculate DII scores for each participant. A complete
description of the DII is available elsewhere [12]. Briefly, the body of literature on DII consists
of all qualifying publications between 1950 and 2010 reporting one or more associations between
dietary components and the following inflammatory markers: IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α
and C-reactive protein [12].
A total of 45 different food parameters were identified as being
related to the six inflammatory biomarkers in the literature review. Each was assigned a “food
parameter-specific inflammatory effect score” through a process of counting the number of studies
reporting a pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and no inflammatory effect on one or more of the six
inflammatory markers, and weighing the scores by study design and size of the literature for each
food parameter/inflammatory marker relation. In previous analyses, the DII was positively correlated
with circulating level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) [13,22].
To calculate DII scores for the participants of this study, the dietary data was first linked to
the world database that provided estimates of a mean intake and standard deviation for each food
parameter [12]. These then became the multipliers to express an individual’s exposure relative to
the “standard global mean” as a z-score. This was achieved by subtracting the “standard global
mean” from the amount reported and dividing this value by the standard deviation. Since data was
skewed to the right (a common occurrence with dietary data), we converted this value into a centered
percentile score. The centered percentile score from every individual was multiplied by the food
parameter-specific inflammatory effect score in order to obtain a food parameter-specific DII score for
an individual. All of the food parameter-specific DII scores were then summed to create the overall
DII score for every participant in the study [12]. DII scores for individuals in the DMS-MC 2015 were
calculated using the 27 food items and nutrients (out of the 45 possible items) for which we had intake
data available from the SFFQ: carbohydrate, protein, fat, alcohol, fiber, cholesterol, saturated fatty
acids, mono-unsaturated fatty acids, poly-unsaturated fatty acids, omega 3 fat, omega 6 fat, trans fat,
niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C,
vitamin E, folic acid, beta carotene, garlic, and onion. Since the DII was calculated per 1000 calories
of food consumed we used the energy-standardized version of the world database to control for the
effect of total energy intake.
2.4. Biomarkers Assessment
A fasting venous blood sample (fasting time was ≥8 h) from an antecubital vein was collected
from each participant. Serum aliquots were stored in cryovials and transported to a laboratory,
where the aliquots were stored at −70 ◦C until they were used for analysis.
Plasma triglycerides were measured with a colorimetric method following enzymatic hydrolysis
performed with the lipase technique. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c),
and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) were measured using the colorimetric method
following enzymatic assay.
Additionally, plasma glucose was measured with the enzymatic
colorimetric methods by using glucose oxidize. Finally, the proportion of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
was determined using the immunocolorimetric method [23].
2.5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Definition
For the present study, subjects who declared to have a previous T2DM physician-diagnosis
independent of their survey glucose concentration were called “previously diagnosed”. Of these,
respondents who were diagnosed with T2DM less than 11 months prior to administration of the
SFFQ, had fasting glucose concentrations ≥126 mg/dL (at the moment of the survey) and poor
glycemic control (HbA1c (%) ≥ 6.5) [24]. These subjects were considered participants with T2DM.
Furthermore, subjects whose glucose concentration in the fasting blood sample taken during the survey
was ≥ 126 mg/dL and had levels of (HbA1c (%) ≥ 6.5) were defined as displaying fasting glucose
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 385
4 of 15
and/or HbA1c values consistent with T2DM diagnostic criteria and were also defined as participants
with T2DM.
2.6. Anthropometric and Blood Pressure Assessment
Participants’ height and weight were measured by trained personal using standardized
procedures. Height was measured by using a conventional stadiometer (SECA 213, Medical Measuring
Systems and Scales, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 cm and body weight was measured with
a previously calibrated electronic (SECA 874, Medical Measuring Systems and Scales, Hamburg,
Germany) scale with a precision of 0.1 kg. Body mass index (BMI = weight (kg)/height (m2)) was
calculated based on measured weight and height. We defined overweight/obesity as BMI ≥25 kg/m2.
Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the high point of the iliac crest at the end of
normal expiration, with a measuring tape, which was placed below any clothing, directly touching the
participant’s skin. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of ≥90 cm in men and
≥80 cm in women [25].
Subjects’ blood pressure was measured twice by a trained personal using an automatic medical
grade monitor (OMROM HEM-907, OMROM Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico). The first measurement
was taken after five minutes of rest, while participants were sitting with the dominant arm supported
at heart level. The second measurement was taken in the same way, five minutes after the first.
2.7. Physical Activity Assessment
Physical activity was evaluated with a previously used and validated [26] short version of the
international physical activity questionnaire (s-IPAQ). The questionnaire includes 9 items that assesses
time spent performing moderate-intense physical activity for at least 10 min for each activity over seven
days. The s-IPAQ data was analyzed in agreement with IPAQ protocol [27], as follows: first, physical
activity interval duration gathered in hours was converted into minutes; second, data which was
described as a weekly frequency was transformed into an average daily time; and third, subjects whose
responses were “do not know”, or “refused”, or had “missing data” for time duration or frequency
were removed from the present analysis. Based on the reported time spent performing moderate to
intense physical activity, participants were classified as inactive (<150 min/week), physically active
(150–299 min/week), or highly active (≥300 min/week) according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) physical activity guidelines [28].
2.8. Socioeconomic Status and Education Assessment
Socioeconomic status (SES) was constructed by combining eight variables that assessed
household characteristics, goods, and available services including: construction materials of the
floor, ceiling, and walls; household goods (stove, microwave, washing machine, refrigerator and
boiler); and electrical goods (television, computer, radio and telephone). The index was divided into
tertiles and used as a proxy for low, medium, and high SES. Education level was stratified into three
groups according to the highest level of education obtained: primary or less, secondary/high school,
and/or higher education.
2.9. Other Participant Characteristics
Participants completed two self-administered questionnaires (home and individual level) and
delivered detailed information regarding their demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, education,
marital status), self-perception of body weight, past medical history, current medication use, lifestyle
information (e.g., diet, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, etc.), depression
symptoms, sleep quantity, and information on reproductive history (for females).

2.10. Statistical Analysis
We conducted descriptive analyses of the main characteristics of interest to assess adherence
to model assumptions. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences
for general characteristics across quintiles of DII, while, chi-square tests were used to evaluate the
distribution of qualitative variables across DII quintiles. To evaluate the magnitude of the association
between specific DII and diabetes, we estimated multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) 95% CI using
logistic regression models. In all multivariate models, the first quintile of the DII score was considered
the reference. The Mantel–Haenszel extension chi-square test was used to assess the overall trend of
OR across increasing quintile of DII scores.
Additionally, to assess possible effect modification, we conducted a stratified analysis by age
groups (<55 years vs. ≥55 years), sex, BMI (<25.0 kg/m2 vs. ≥25.0 kg/m2), and physical activity
(inactive vs. active or highly active). We tested the significance using a likelihood ratio test by
comparing a model with the main effects of each intake and the stratified variable and the reduced
model interaction terms with only the main effects.
All p-values presented are two-tailed, p < 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were
performed using STATA software (College Station, StataCorp LP, TX, USA), version 13.0.
3. Results
Participants’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 1174 subjects (48.5% men)
between 20–69 years were included in the present analysis. The overall prevalence of T2DM was 13.6%;
of these, 10.1% were previously diagnosed individuals, whereas 3.5% were individuals with glucose
and/or HbA1c values consistent with T2DM definition at the time of the survey. The mean age among
participants with T2DM was 52.3 years. Subjects with T2DM had a significantly higher prevalence of
obesity, abdominal obesity, had lower levels of physical activity and intake of cereal fiber, and also,
as expected, levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycated hemoglobin were all significantly
higher in participants with T2DM.

According to DII score quintiles, subjects with the most pro-inflammatory diet were significantly
older, less educated, had lower SES, smoked less, had a higher prevalence of obesity, abdominal obesity,
and T2DM (Table 2). The most pro-inflammatory diet was characterized by a higher consumption
of carbohydrates (56.1%; (95% CI: 54.3, 57.8) vs. 53.8% (52.6, 55.1)), red meat and processed meat
(78.3 g/day (66.3, 90.2) vs. 40.1 g/day (33.7, 46.5)), refined cereals (173.9 g/day (147.1, 200.6) vs.
109.2 g/day (96.0, 122.5)), and soft drinks (401.7 mL/day (343.3, 460.1) vs. 69.5 mL/day (51.6, 87.4))
compared to the most anti-inflammatory diet. All of these differences were statistically significant. Also,
significantly decreasing trends were observed for the anti-inflammatory nutrients: fiber, vitamin C,
vitamin D, and magnesium (Table 3).
After adjusting for age and sex, the odds of having T2DM, across all DII score quintiles were
1.00, 1.63, 1.80, 1.84, and 2.29 (95% CI: 1.11, 4.75; p = 0.01). Finally, after additional adjustment for
co-variables, we observed that subjects with the most pro-inflammatory diet had approximately three
times greater odds of having T2DM (OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.39, 6.58; p = 0.005), compared to individuals in
the lowest DII quintile (Table 4).
Additionally, a sensitivity analysis included individuals with glucose and/or HbA1c values
consistent with T2DM definition at the time of the survey. In this case, we observed that subjects with
the most pro-inflammatory diet had greater odds of having T2DM (OR = 3.56; 95% CI: 1.13, 9.11) (data
not shown).
In addition, we evaluated the effect-modifying role of age; we observed a greater association with
T2DM contrasting DII extreme quintiles (Q5 vs. Q1) for participants aged ≥ 55 years (OR = 9.77; 95%
CI: 3.78, 25.50; p = 0.001) (Figure 1).

4. Discussion
In the Mexico City Diabetes Mellitus Survey, we observed that participants in the DII
score highest quintile, representing the most pro-inflammatory diet, had higher odds of T2DM
(independent of other diabetes risk factors) compared with participants in the DII score lowest
quintile (maximum anti-inflammatory potential). When we stratified by age (<55 years vs. ≥55 years),
we observed positive associations between DII and T2DM, with larger magnitude of association among
participants ≥55 years of age.
In the present study, we used a previously derived and validated DII score [13] to appraise the
capacity of a pro-inflammatory diet on T2DM. The DII scores computed from a Mexican population
included 27 food parameters, ranged from −5.49 to +4.12 with a mean of −0.68. This result is
consistent with prior publications conducted in Italy, France, and Spain [16,17,29,30]. For example,
Ramallal and colleagues at the University of Navarra cohort study reported a DII score ranging from
−5.14 to +3.97 [30].
We also evaluated associations between food groups and nutrient intake and the DII, and found
that subjects in the highest DII quintile (most pro-inflammatory diet) consumed more red and processed
meat, eggs, refined cereals, and soft drinks, and had a lower intakes of vegetables, fruits, fish,
and seafood. Similar to these results, the “PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea” (PREDIMED) study
found that consumption of vegetables and fruit was less frequent among men and women in the
highest DII quintile [29].
Regarding nutrient intake, we observed that subjects with the most pro-inflammatory diet
had lower intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, magnesium, and some vitamins. Similar
to our results, the PREDIMED study found that subjects in the highest DII quintile consumed fewer
polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and fiber. Moreover, other studies using the dietary pattern
or dietary score approach, have observed an inverse association between healthy diets or patterns
(mainly characterized by fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fiber) and inflammation and T2DM,
as well as a positive association with Western patterns or unhealthy diet scores [9,10,30,31].
In the present analysis, we studied the association between DII and T2DM. We observed that
subjects in the highest DII quintile had approximately three times greater odds of T2DM compared
with subjects in the lowest DII quintile. The findings in our analysis agree with prior studies that
evaluate the relation between diet and T2DM. For example, in the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis
Cohort study, including subjects with a diet high in red meat, low-fiber cereals, fried potatoes, eggs,
cheese, and low in wine had approximately 4.5 times greater risk of T2DM comparing extreme
quartiles of the dietary pattern [31]. Similar results were observed in the Nurses’ Health Study [32],
where a pattern higher in sugar-sweetened soft drinks, refined grains, and processed meat but low in
vegetables was associated with an increased risk of T2DM (OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.99, 4.79; compared to
diet characterized by lower consumption of these dietary components). On the other hand, multiple
prospective studies have reported an inverse association between the adherence to Mediterranean
diet (with anti-inflammatory effects) [33] and the risk of T2DM [34]. Furthermore, a recent study [35]
that evaluated the relation between DII and the risk of prediabetes found that subjects in the highest
DII tertile had higher odds of prediabetes (OR = 18.88; 95% CI: 7.02, 50.82) compared to those who
consumed a more anti-inflammatory diet. Additionally, most of the highly consumed food groups in
the most pro-inflammatory DII quintile (red and processed meat, refined cereals, and soft drinks) have
been associated with T2DM and with inflammatory markers [10]. For example, soft drinks have been
linked to T2DM and inflammatory biomarkers due to their significant contribution to the glycemic
load [36]. Whereas, low intakes of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in the highest DII quintile
have been related with reduced diabetes risk, probably mediated by a reduction of CRP, and certain
interleukins, and by an improvement in the endothelial function [37].
Other results in the present study indicate that a pro-inflammatory effect of diet on T2DM
could be particularly unfavorable among older (≥55 years) or inactive individuals (<150 min/week).
Although not statistically significant, there was a suggestion of an interaction between DII and
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 385
12 of 15
overweight/obesity in relation to T2DM. Despite the lack of significance, this result could be
biologically important. Similar results were obtained in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. In this
study, the stratified analysis suggests that, among men, the risk for T2DM increased with higher
consumption of fat and meat patterns among overweight (Hazard ratio = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.23, 1.81)
and obese (HR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.12) individuals [38]. In women, similar results were observed,
although these results were not statistically significant. In our case, this finding should be interpreted
with caution; it is difficult to determine, with our study design, the role of BMI in the causal sequence
(i.e., whether it is a confounder or an effect modifier). The relation between DII and T2DM remained
strong after adjustment for BMI, indicating that the DII may be associated with diabetes in all
individuals, but especially among obese subjects.
The connection between DII and T2DM could be explained through the effect of a pro-inflammatory
diet on insulin resistance that has been linked to the inflammatory process [39]. In this sense, prior
studies suggest a positive relationship between markers of chronic inflammation, including CRP, IL-1β,
IL-6, and TNF-α, and insulin resistance [39]. Furthermore, it has been established that insulin resistance
increases levels of these adhesion molecules in diabetic and nondiabetics individuals [40]. On the other
hand, the functional effects of food or food groups and nutrients like meat, processed meat, refined
cereals, and soft drinks, which corresponded with high DII scores in our study, have been also shown
to influence systemic inflammation [32].
Strengths of our study include: (1) the random stratified cluster design of the DMS-MC; (2) the use
of previously validated questionnaires; (3) the inclusion of many potential demographic, behavioral,
and other factors as potential effect modifiers or confounders in the multivariate analysis; and (4)
the use of a validated DII score specially constructed to assess the inflammatory potential of any
diet [12,13]. As reported in other studies [17,29], the DII can be adapted for use in different populations
including the Mexican population providing results that can be compared to those from studies based
in diverse populations in many parts of the world.
Some potential weaknesses of our study need to be highlighted. Because of its cross-sectional
design, this study cannot infer causality. Therefore, these results need to be further investigated in
future longitudinal studies. Although the SFFQ used in this study had been previously validated [20],
other possible limitations are related to information bias. In this regard, it is important to note that
dietary factors used to calculate the DII were evaluated from a single measurement of SFFQ, which is
subject to random error that would tend to underestimate the true association between DII and T2DM
in our study. As observed in previous studies [29], some dietary components such as saffron, thyme,
turmeric, and others were not available to compute the DII in the present analysis; however, as they
are not habitually consumed in large quantities or common in Mexican diet, they may not have
an important impact on the DII score. Another probable weakness could be related to the T2DM
definition; nevertheless, we provided appropriate allowance for the prevalent ascertainment in the
present analysis. In other words, prevalent cases of T2DM (previously diagnosed) were included only
if they were recently diagnosed (less than 11 months), had fasting glucose concentrations ≥126 mg/dL,
and had poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 6.5) at the time of the survey. Additionally, we conducted
a sensitivity analysis including only subjects diagnosed at the time of the survey and we observed
similar results (OR = 3.56; 95% CI: 1.13, 9.11). We adjusted for many potentially confounding factors,
however, residual confounding due to measurement error, mainly in assessing some self-reported
lifestyle variables or due to insufficient control in statistical models, might have produced some degree
of bias in our results. However, it is improbable that such a bias would explain the consistently robust
association observed between DII and T2DM.
5. Conclusions
Our data suggest that a higher DII score (revealing a more pro-inflammatory diet) was associated
with increased odds of T2DM compared with DII scores in the lowest quintile of the DII (indicative of
an anti-inflammatory diet) among participants from the DMS-MC. In addition, we observed that
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 385
13 of 15
the magnitude of the association appeared to be more pronounced among overweight/obesity
subjects, older individuals, and those with low levels of physical activity. Further longitudinal
investigations evaluating this relationship are needed to determine causality. Finally, the DII may be
an important tool to characterize the diet of the Mexican population and further explore associations
with non-communicable diseases.
