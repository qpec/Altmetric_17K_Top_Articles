Health Among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
Transgender Adolescents and Young Adults

Objectives. To examine the effects of the cumulative victimization experienced by
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youths on mental disorders.
Methods. We recruited 248 participants from the Chicago, Illinois, area in 7 waves of
data collected over 4 years, beginning in 2007 (83.1% retention rate). Mean age at
enrollment was 18.7 years, and 54.7% were Black. We measured depression and
posttraumatic stress disorder using structured psychiatric interviews.
Results. Latent class analyses of victimization over time identified a 4-class solution.
Class 1 (65.4%) had low, decreasing victimization. Class 2 (10.3%) had moderate, in-
creasing victimization. Class 3 (5.1%) had high, steady victimization. Class 4 (19.2%) had
high, decreasing victimization. Controlling for baseline diagnoses and birth sex, lesbian,
gay, bisexual, and transgender youths in classes 2 and 3 were at higher risk for depression
than were those in class 1; youths in classes 2, 3, and 4 were at elevated risk for
posttraumatic stress disorder.
Conclusions. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youths with steadily high or in-
creasing levels of victimization from adolescence to early adulthood are at higher risk for
depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:527–533.

esbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
(LGBT) people experience greater
mental health problems, such as depression,
anxiety, suicide attempts,1,2 and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),3 as well as
physical health disparities (e.g., cardiovascular
disease4), than do heterosexual and cisgender
individuals (cisgender refers to those who are
not transgender, i.e., their gender identity
matches what is typically socially ascribed to
those with their sex assigned at birth). Re-
search with nationally representative samples
has revealed greater odds of psychological
distress among sexual minority youths than
among heterosexuals.1,5,6 Additionally,
community-based samples of LGBT youths
have shown that as many as 30% may ex-
perience psychological distress at clinically
significant levels—including symptoms of
somatization, depression, and anxiety.7,8
LGBT youths experience greater stressors
from childhood into early adulthood, such
as child abuse and unstable housing, that
exacerbate mental health problems, such as
depression and anxiety,1,9,10 and they face
a host of minority stressors specific to their
sexual and gender minority identities.
In the minority stress model,11,12 both
proximal and distal stressors, such as in-
ternalized homophobia, stigma conscious-
ness, identity concealment, and experiencing
heterosexism and victimization, are mecha-
nisms that explain the higher rates of mental
health problems in sexual minorities, and
similar mechanisms have been hypothesized
for transgender individuals.13 One of the most
consistent predictors of mental health issues
for LGBT individuals is experiencing
discrimination, harassment, and victimiza-
tion, which LGBT youths experience
disproportionately compared with
heterosexual14–18 and cisgender youths.19 For
example, a study with a community-based
sample of LGBT youths found that 94% had
experienced some form of sexual orientation–
based victimization.20 In addition, victimi-
zation has been associated with greater psy-
chological distress (including symptoms of
somatization and anxiety),20 depression,21
substance use,22 suicide attempts,23,24 and
PTSD.25
As adults, LGBT individuals continue to
report high rates of sexual orientation–based
or gender identity–based discrimination,
harassment, and victimization.26–30 In addi-
tion, longitudinal investigations have shown
that LGB individuals experience greater
victimization and stressful life events than do
heterosexuals over time.31,32 Even so, lon-
gitudinal studies with large national samples
do not regularly measure sexual orientation–
based victimization and instead measure
victimization more generally. The accumu-
lation of these sexual orientation–specific
stressors and repeated marginalization can
exacerbate mental health problems, although
more longitudinal research in this area with
LGBT samples is needed. In addition, re-
search may reveal predictors of LGBT in-
dividuals who are the most at risk for
continued longstanding victimization, which
could elucidate subgroups to target in in-
tervention and prevention efforts to decrease
mental health problems.

 From a life course perspective, marginal-
ized groups may be at greater risk for mental
and physical health problems later in life
because of the accumulation of stressors over
time instead of isolated and discrete events.33
In addition, individuals may experience
“stress proliferation,” which is the production
of new stressors that result from previous
stressful life events and in turn exacerbate
mental health problems and decrease an in-
dividual’s ability to cope.33,34 Similarly, stress
sensitization theory highlights that repeated
experiences of stressors impair the stress re-
sponse system,34 which also can affect in-
dividuals on a biological level. For example,
repeated exposure to stress can exacerbate
allostatic load35 and disrupt cortisol levels.36,37
Much of the research applying these theories
has been conducted with racial minorities and
individuals from lower socioeconomic sta-
tuses, and even though both LGBT youths
and adults report high levels of victimization,
longitudinal research in this area is very
limited.
Although there is a dearth of research on
cumulative patterns of sexual orientation–
based victimization for LGBT youths, re-
search shows that, overall, LGB youths
experience more victimization than do
heterosexuals.31,32 In addition, some research
with heterosexuals has examined trajectories
of victimization more generally. For example,
a 4-year study of adolescents found 4 tra-
jectories that characterized victimization
patterns.38 They found that most participants
(80%) had low levels of victimization across
the study but that others had moderate vic-
timization levels that declined progressively
(16%), high victimization that quickly de-
clined (2.2%), and low levels of victimization
that increased (2.0%).
Although this study did not examine how
these trajectories related to mental health—
and in fact very few studies have examined
cumulative victimization and mental health—
a study with a heterosexual sample found that
as victimization and experiences of adversity
increase across the lifetime, levels of de-
pression also increase.39 In addition, in-
dividuals with multiple forms of victimization
have been shown to have higher levels of
trauma symptoms.40 Because of the greater
risk of victimization in LGBT individuals
compared with heterosexuals starting as early
as adolescence,18 research is needed that
examineshowtrajectoriesofsexualorientation–
based victimization across development
influence the risk for mental health problems
for LGBT people.
Although LGBT people experience high
levels of victimization, we do not know how
patterns of victimization change over time,
nor do we know how those trajectories of
victimization affect psychiatric disorders.
Therefore, we sought to (1) further validate
a measure of victimization using item re-
sponse theory (IRT) analyses, (2) identify
trajectories of victimization in LGBT youths
transitioning from adolescence to emerging
adulthood, and (3) determine how these
trajectories relate to depression and PTSD,
using structured clinical interviews. As psy-
chiatric disorders also were measured at the
baseline assessment, we had the substantial
advantage of being able to estimate victimi-
zation pattern effects across development on
the emergence of psychiatric disorders over
the course of our study (i.e., controlling for
disorders at baseline).
METHODS
Participants were 248 LGBT youths from
an ongoing longitudinal study, Project Q2.
Previous publications provide detailed in-
formation about study recruitment and in-
clusion criteria.7,41,42 In brief, we used
incentivized peer recruitment, whereby we
compensated participants $10 for each peer
they recruited for the study, to recruit the
sample. We recruited initial participants
(“seeds”) from the Chicago, Illinois, area
through e-mail advertisements, cards, and
flyers posted in spaces serving large numbers
of LGBT youths. Previous studies have found
no differences in mental health on the basis of
recruitment source.7 To be eligible for par-
ticipation, individuals needed to identify as
LGBT or report same-sex attractions.
Of the initial sample, 234 participants (53%
female) met the age requirement (aged 16–20
years) at baseline—which we determined
using identification-based age verification at
later waves—and were included in study
analyses. Of those participants we excluded
from the analytic sample, 6 were younger
than 16 years at baseline and 8 were older than
20 years. Data collection began in April 2007
and participants completed their seventh
wave of data 4 years after their baseline visit.
We collected data every 6 months, with the
exception of the sixth wave, which occurred
1.5 years from the fifth wave. Retention was
high at all follow-ups (77.0%–89.9%), and
206 participants from the age-verified sample
(83.1%) werestill active at the seventh wave of
data collection.43
Measures
LGBT victimization. We administered
a frequently used 10-item measure44–46 of
LGBT-specific victimization. Participants
used a 4-point scale (range = 0 [never] to 3
[‡ 3 times]) to identify the frequency with
which they experienced verbal and physical
threats or assault in the past 6 months because
they “are, or were thought to be, gay, lesbian,
bisexual, or transgender.” For psychometric
analyses, we dichotomized the response cat-
egories (0 = never, 1 = at least 1 time) because
of low endorsement for victimization expe-
riences that occurred more than once.47 The
internal reliability of this measure was high
at each time point (all a > 0.76; average
a = 0.84).
Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.
We conducted developmentally appropriate,
computer-guided, and interviewer-
administered structured psychiatric in-
terviews at baseline and the seventh wave of
data collection to assess mental health di-
agnoses in the past year. We administered the
Computerized Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule for Children, version IV (C-DISC-IV48)
at baseline and the Computerized Diagnostic
Interview Schedule, version IV (C-DIS-IV49)
at the 48-month follow-up. The C-DISC
and C-DIS are widely used structured clinical
interviews for psychiatric diagnoses in ado-
lescents and young adults.50 We employed
extensive training of lay interviewers along
with ongoing fidelity supervision from
a clinical psychologist.50 We used diagnoses
from the major depressive disorder (MDD)
and PTSD modules for these analyses.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted latent class growth analyses
(LCGA) to identify classes characterized by
distinct victimization trajectories. This type of
analysis allowed us to examine growth factor
variations (i.e., both intercept and linear
slopes of the trajectories) across classes

 (e.g., high vs low intercepts with increasing vs
decreasing trajectories). We conducted de-
scriptive analyses to evaluate demographic
differences across the LCGA classes. We in-
cluded latent classes in logistic regression ana-
lyses as predictors of PTSD and MDD at the
48-month follow-up. We also included base-
line diagnoses of PTSD and MDD as predictors
in the model to estimate the unique effect
of observed victimization trajectories after
adjusting for preexisting mental disorders.
At each step in the analysis, we evaluated
model(comparativefitindex,rootmeansquare
error of approximation, Bayesian information
criteria, entropy) and item metrics (parameter
estimates, difficulty and discrimination values)
to detect ill-fitting items and identify the best
fitting model. We ran logistic regressions in
SPSS version 21 (IBM, Somers, NY), and we
performed LCGA analyses with Mplus version
7.11 (Muthen & Muthen, Los Angeles, CA).
The classic (e.g., frequencies, correlations,
factor analyses) and modern (i.e., IRT) psy-
chometric analyses that we conducted on the
victimization items are available in Appendix A
(available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics of the sample
at baseline and the 48-month follow-up are
presented in Table 1. Logistic regression
analyses indicated that birth sex (i.e., sex
assigned at birth, not gender identity) was the
only demographic characteristic to predict
attrition at the 48-month follow-up; al-
though retention was very high overall, fe-
males were significantly more likely to
participate in this interview than were males
(odds ratio [OR] = 2.01; 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 1.12, 4.51; P < .05).
Psychometric Analyses
Results from the psychometric analyses
conducted on the victimization items are
available as Appendix B (available as a sup-
plement to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org). On the basis of fre-
quencies (Table A, available as a supplement
to the online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org), reliabilities, and correlations,
item 7 was removed from the measure. Factor
analyses supported a unidimensional victim-
ization measure.
The IRT analysis indicated that the scale
score was more reliable for individuals who
experienced moderate to high victimization
(Figure A, available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org), which was not surprising con-
sidering that the purpose of the measure
is to assess victimization rather than
microagressions.
Latent Class Growth Analyses
Victimization trajectories. Results from the
LCGA are available in Appendix B. We used
model fit parameters (Table B, available as
a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org), theoretical
justification, and class interpretability to arrive
at a 4-class solution with linear slopes.
Figure 1 presents the victimization tra-
jectories for the 4 latent classes. Class 1 (low,
decreasing victimization; 65.4% of the sam-
ple) included youths who reported moderate
initial levels of victimization (i.e., intercept)
and had a significantly declining victimization
trajectory (slope; b = –0.07; 95% CI = –0.10,
–0.04; P < .01). Class 2 (moderate, increasing
victimization; 10.3% of the sample) was
composed of youths who reported moderate
initial levels of victimization and

 demonstrated a significantly increasing vic-
timization trajectory (b = 0.27; 95%
CI = 0.09, 0.44; P < .01). Class 3 (high, steady
victimization; 5.1% of the sample) contained
youths who reported high initial levels of
victimization and demonstrated no significant
change in their victimization trajectory over
time b = –0.01; 95% CI = –0.14, 0.12;
P = .87). Class 4 (high, decreasing victimi-

youths who reported high initial levels of
victimization and showed a significantly
declining victimization trajectory (b= –0.38;
95% CI= –0.48, –0.29; P < .01).
Latent class characteristics. We examined
differences in key demographic variables
(race/ethnicity, age, birth sex) across the la-
tent classes of victimization trajectories. Be-
cause of sample size limitations, we made
racial/ethnicity comparisons between par-
ticipants who identified as Black (54.7%) and
the remainder of the sample. Differences by
race and age were not significant. We found
that the latent classes differed by birth sex, (c2
(3, n = 234) = 11.57; P < .01). There were
a higher proportion of females (vs males) in
class 1 (low, declining) and lower proportions
in the remaining classes.
Mental Health Outcomes
We conducted logistic regressions to
analyze differences in MDD and PTSD di-
agnoses across the 4 victimization trajectory
groups, with the low victimization group (low
intercept, declining slope) serving as the ref-
erentgroup(Tables2and3).Weincludedbirth
sex, age, and baseline diagnoses in each model.
We also examined the impact of race but did
not find it to be a significant covariate; because
results did not change with the inclusion of the
variable, we removed race from the final
model. The latent victimization classes proved
tobeasignificantpredictorofMDDandPTSD
even when including previous, corresponding
diagnoses from baseline.
LGBT youths in class 2 (moderate, in-
creasing; OR = 5.54; 95% CI = 1.94, 15.82;
P < .001) and class 3 (high, steady victimiza-
tion; OR = 4.23; 95% CI = 1.15, 15.48;
P < .05) were at higher risk for a depression
diagnosis at the 48-month follow-up than
were youths in the normative, low
victimization group. Similarly, we found
youths in class 2 (moderate, increasing;
OR = 9.37; 95% CI = 2.76, 31.88; P < .001)
and class 3 (high, steady victimization;
OR = 8.66; 95% CI = 1.93, 39.00; P < .01) to
be at higher risk for a PTSD diagnosis than
were youths in the normative, low victimi-
zation group. Unlike for MDD, youths in
class 4 also were at elevated risk for PTSD
(high, decreasing victimization; OR = 4.19;
95% CI = 1.39, 12.63; P < .01).
DISCUSSION
Mental health disparities in minority
groups have been associated with the accu-
mulation and proliferation of stress across the
lifetime, particularly in research with racial/
ethnic minorities and individuals with lower
socioeconomic status.33,34 Although research
on the accumulation of sexual orientation–
based victimization in the lives of LGBT
individuals has thus far been lacking, cross-
sectional data have shown that LGBT in-
dividuals experience greater discrimination,
harassment, and victimization than do het-
erosexuals and cisgender individuals.14,16,51 In
response to these minority stressors, LGBT
individuals experience more mental health
problems than do heterosexual and cisgender
individuals.11,12,20–24,51 We examined how
different patterns of accumulated victimiza-
tion during the developmental transition
from adolescence to emerging adulthood
predicted such psychiatric outcomes.
For most youths in this study (84.6%),
experiences of victimization decreased from
baseline to the 4-year follow-up. Youths at
baseline were mostly in high school, and
transitioning out of high school may have
resulted in less exposure to peer victimization
because, as adults, participants had more
agency in choosing settings and peers to
affiliate with. As this sample aged, they
also were likely better able to access
LGBT-affirmative resources. Although
comparisons to other studies on victimization
trajectories for LGBT samples are not avail-
able, 2 longitudinal studies have shown de-
clines on average across development.52,53
Trajectory analyses with heterosexuals have
shown that the majority either had low levels
of victimization longitudinally or moderate
levels that decreased over time, with few
participants experiencing high or increasing

 rates of victimization.38 In our sample of
LGBT youths, 10.3% experienced significant
increases in victimization, and 5.1% main-
tained high levels across development.
In addition, our sample revealed similar
rates of victimization at baseline to other
LGBT-specific cross-sectional studies that
have used a similar scale.20,54
After controlling for baseline diagnoses,
age, and sex, class membership was a signifi-
cant predictor of MDD and PTSD diagnoses.
The control for baseline diagnoses was
important because it allowed us to make
stronger inferences about the effects of cu-
mulative victimization across the period of
our longitudinal study. Youths who experi-
enced moderate levels of victimization that
increased or who consistently experienced
high levels of victimization were at greater risk
for MDD and PTSD than were youths who
experienced low levels of victimization.
Furthermore, youths who had high initial
levels of victimization that declined over time
were still at elevated risk for PTSD. These
findings corroborate previous research with
the minority stress model, showing that vic-
timization places LGBT youths at risk for
mental illness.20–24,51 In addition, our results
highlight that it is not only isolated experi-
ences of victimization that affect mental
health (which has been the focus of much
previous research) but instead the accumu-
lation of these stressors that exacerbates
mental health problems.
Youths who had high levels of victimi-
zation that decreased over time did not differ
from youths who had low levels of victimi-
zation in regard to depression, but they were
significantly more likely to meet criteria for
PTSD. This could be because of the lasting
effects of traumatic events on PTSD com-
pared with depression. Research with na-
tionally representative population samples has
demonstrated that PTSD can be long lasting,
and whereas most people (92%) will remit in
their lifetime, the median number of years
until remission was 14.55 In addition, en-
during traumatic events in childhood and
interpersonal violence significantly prolonged
the time to remission,55 both of which could
have lengthened the time our participants met
criteria for PTSD even though their levels
of victimization were decreasing. Compara-
tively, a meta-analysis of studies on untrea-
ted depression showed that 53% of cases
remitted within 12 months, with children
and adolescents being more likely to remit
than were adults.56 It is possible that youths
who met depression criteria earlier in life

Strengths and Limitations
Our study had several strengths, including 7
waves of data collection over the course of 48
months, making this the longest published
longitudinal study specifically targeting an
LGBT youth sample. Although there have
been other longitudinal studies with
population-based samples that included LGBT
participants, they often did not measure sexual
orientation–specific minority stressors as we
did in this study. Although LGBT-specific
studies, such as ours, are not derived from
probability samples, we were able to more
specifically measure the types of victimization
participants experienced. Also, this was one of
the first studies to examine the cumulative
impact of LGBT victimization using LCGA to
classify individuals into victimization trajectory
groups. In addition, we used structured clinical
interviews to evaluate participants for Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th ed.57 diagnoses instead of relying on self-
report measures, which can have low positive
predictive value in LGBT youth samples.7
Also, our use of IRT analyses with the vic-
timization measure improved on the more
typical use of Likert-type scales or frequencies
becauseittookintoaccountthe“difficulty,”or
severity, of the victimization.
Limitations of the study included that this
was a nonprobability sample recruited from
a geographically limited area, which limits our
ability to generalize to the national population
of LGBT youths. In addition, multiple forms
of victimization may exacerbate psychologi-
cal distress, such as trauma symptoms40;
however, we did not measure other forms of
victimization (e.g., racially motivated vic-
timization). We also did not measure other
childhood adverse events, such as child abuse,
which are known to influence later mental
health.58 Finally, 95% CIs from some effects
were large because of the sample size and
variable frequencies; therefore, replication of
these effects in larger samples would be
advantageous.
Conclusions
Overall, future research on trajectories of
victimization may benefit from measuring
how the accumulation of multiple forms of
victimization and negative childhood events
may influence mental health, as well as how
LGBT youths may be resilient in the face of
cumulative stressors. Although the lives of
LGBT youths are heavily influenced by
heterosexism and marginalization,59 youths
vary in the degree to which these experiences
accumulate across their lifetimes. As our re-
sults show, those trajectories of victimization
have significant implications for mental
health. Through identifying these trajecto-
ries, as well as the determinants and outcomes
of these lived experiences, researchers can
identify key factors in the paths to positive
development and ways to decrease the ele-
vated mental health problems experienced by
LGBT people.
