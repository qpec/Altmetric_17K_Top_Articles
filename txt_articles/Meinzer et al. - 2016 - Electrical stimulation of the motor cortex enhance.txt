Transcranial direct current stimulation has shown promise to improve recovery in patients with post-stroke aphasia, but previous
studies have only assessed stimulation effects on impairment parameters, and evidence for long-term maintenance of transcranial
direct current stimulation effects from randomized, controlled trials is lacking. Moreover, due to the variability of lesions and
functional language network reorganization after stroke, recent studies have used advanced functional imaging or current model-
ling to determine optimal stimulation sites in individual patients. However, such approaches are expensive, time consuming and
may not be feasible outside of specialized research centres, which complicates incorporation of transcranial direct current stimu-
lation in day-to-day clinical practice. Stimulation of an ancillary system that is functionally connected to the residual language
network, namely the primary motor system, would be more easily applicable, but effectiveness of such an approach has not been
explored systematically. We conducted a randomized, parallel group, sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial and 26 patients
with chronic aphasia received a highly intensive naming therapy over 2 weeks (8 days, 2 � 1.5 h/day). Concurrently, anodal-
transcranial direct current stimulation was administered to the left primary motor cortex twice daily at the beginning of each
training session. Naming ability for trained items (n = 60 pictures that could not be named during repeated baseline assessments),
transfer to untrained items (n = 284 pictures) and generalization to everyday communication were assessed immediately post-
intervention and 6 months later. Naming ability for trained items was significantly improved immediately after the end of the
intervention in both the anodal (Cohen’s d = 3.67) and sham-transcranial direct current stimulation groups (d = 2.10), with a trend
for larger gains in the anodal-transcranial direct current stimulation group (d = 0.71). Treatment effects for trained items were
significantly better maintained in the anodal-transcranial direct current stimulation group 6 months later (d = 1.19). Transfer to
untrained items was significantly larger in the anodal-transcranial direct current stimulation group after the training (d = 1.49) and
during the 6 month follow-up assessment (d = 3.12). Transfer effects were only maintained in the anodal-transcranial direct current
stimulation group. Functional communication was significantly more improved in the anodal-transcranial direct current stimulation
group at both time points compared to patients treated with sham-transcranial direct current stimulation (d = 0.75–0.99). Our
results provide the first evidence from a randomized, controlled trial that transcranial direct current stimulation can improve both
function and activity-related outcomes in chronic aphasia, with medium to large effect sizes, and that these effects are maintained
over extended periods of time. These effects were achieved with an easy-to-implement and thus clinically feasible motor-cortex
montage that may represent a promising ‘backdoor’ approach to improve language recovery after stroke.

Introduction
More than 15 million people worldwide suffer from stroke
each year (Feigin et al., 2014), of whom approximately one-
third show language impairment (aphasia, Laska et al., 2001;
Dickey et al., 2010). It is estimated that aphasia persists in up
to 40% of these patients for more than 1 year after stroke
(Pedersen et al., 1995; Lazar and Antoniello, 2008). Chronic
language impairments are among the most devastating conse-
quences of stroke by affecting vocational reintegration, social
life and psychological wellbeing on the individual level and by
placing major burdens on the healthcare system (Code and
Herrmann, 2003; Dickey et al., 2010). Intensive and deficit-
oriented treatment can improve aphasia even in the chronic
stage, but treatment effect sizes are often modest (Brady et al.,
2012). Thus, there is a pressing need to explore new strategies
to enhance treatment efficacy in chronic aphasia.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be a
promising tool to achieve this goal (Monti et al., 2013;
Flo
¨el, 2014; de Aguiar et al., 2015). During tDCS, a weak
electrical current is delivered to the scalp using two surface
electrodes to induce a polarity-dependent shift in neuronal
resting
membrane
potential
within
the
targeted
cortical
region, thereby promoting changes in cortical excitability
(Stagg and Nitsche, 2011). Moreover, the after-effects of
tDCS involve induction of synaptic plasticity that mimic
long-term potentiation, which is critical for learning, neuro-
plasticity
and
rehabilitation
(Stagg
and
Nitsche,
2011).
Transcranial DCS has an excellent safety profile and thus far
no serious side effects have been reported even in stroke popu-
lations, while a placebo stimulation condition (‘sham-tDCS’)
allows effective blinding of participants (Fregni et al., 2015).
In the language domain, proof-of-concept studies that
exploited transient effects of single stimulation sessions
have demonstrated that excitatory (‘anodal’) tDCS admin-
istered to perisylvian regions in the left hemisphere can
improve language processing in healthy individuals (for re-
views see Flo
¨el, 2012; Monti et al., 2013). Moreover,
multi-session tDCS has been shown to induce more per-
manent behavioural and neural modulations. For example,
studies in healthy individuals have shown that five to 10
sessions of anodal-tDCS can enhance language, motor and
cognitive learning compared to sham-tDCS with mainten-
ance of effects for up to 12 months (Dockery et al., 2009;
Reis et al., 2009; Cohen Kadosh et al., 2010; Meinzer et
al., 2014a). Thus, anodal-tDCS could be a viable and cost-
effective way to enhance treatment efficacy in aphasia.
However, to date, there is a lack of randomized clinical
trials testing the effectiveness of tDCS to improve both lin-
guistic impairment and functional communication, and the
long-term maintenance of potential beneficial effects in
aphasia (Elsner et al., 2015).
Moreover, the choice of stimulation sites in patients with
post-stroke aphasia is complicated by variable lesion sizes
and locations as well as interindividual differences in func-
tional language network reorganization. Consequently, stu-
dies that employed ‘uniform’ stimulation sites targeting left
hemispheric language regions in aphasia patients resulted in
highly variable stimulation effects (for review see de Aguiar
et al., 2015). Recently, more sophisticated approaches have
emerged that involved pretreatment mapping of spared lan-
guage regions using functional MRI (Baker et al., 2010;
Fridriksson et al., 2011), modelling of current flow on an
individual basis (Dmochowski et al., 2013) and systematic
exploration of optimal montages using behavioural experi-
ments
prior
to
treatment
(Shah-Basak
et
al.,
2015).
However, from a pragmatic point of view, determining
the optimal stimulation on an individual basis is time con-
suming, expensive and may require expertise frequently not
available outside of specialized research settings. This com-
plicates the incorporation of tDCS in day-to-day clinical
practice and underscores the need to explore the effective-
ness of alternative stimulation sites that are easy to admin-
ister and feasible in clinical environments.
Such a stimulation site could feature a functionally con-
nected ancillary system to facilitate processing of the re-
sidual language network, i.e. the primary motor system.
Previous research has suggested a tight link between lin-
guistic functions and activation of the motor (action)
system (Willems and Hagoort, 2007; Pulvermu
¨ller and
Fadiga, 2010). Numerous studies have demonstrated that

 manipulations can facilitate language processing on differ-
ent levels (e.g. semantic processing, lexical retrieval) in
healthy
individuals
(Hadar
et
al.,
1998;
Holle
and
Gunter, 2007; Dick et al., 2009) and patients with aphasia
(Hanlon et al., 1990; Hesse et al., 2007; Meinzer et al.,
2011; Benjamin
et al., 2014; Harnish et al., 2014).
Moreover, two recent studies in healthy individuals demon-
strated that tDCS administered to the primary motor cortex
(M1) can facilitate (anodal-tDCS, Meinzer et al., 2014c) or
impair (inhibitory cathodal-tDCS, Liuzzi et al., 2010) lan-
guage processing. In aphasia, a cross-over, sham-tDCS con-
trolled,
single
case
report
demonstrated
significantly
improved naming ability when anodal-tDCS was adminis-
tered to the left M1 (Datta et al., 2011).
Therefore, evidence from behavioural, brain imaging and
brain stimulation studies suggest that M1 stimulation by
anodal-tDCS may represent a promising and clinically feas-
ible approach to enhance language therapy outcome in
post-stroke aphasia. This hypothesis was tested in the pre-
sent randomized, sham-tDCS controlled, clinical trial that
assessed both short- and long-term outcome of intensive
language training in combination with M1-tDCS on im-
pairment and disability parameters.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
We conducted a randomized, parallel-group, sham-tDCS con-
trolled, double-blind, single centre, clinical trial to investigate
whether anodal-tDCS administered to M1 can improve the
effectiveness of intensive therapy in patients with chronic
post-stroke aphasia and word-finding problems. All patients
received an established naming therapy, either with anodal
or sham-tDCS. The primary outcome variable was treatment
success for specifically trained items. Secondary outcomes com-
prised transfer to untrained items and generalization to every-
day
communication
ability.
All
outcome
measures
were
assessed before and immediately after the end of the interven-
tion and during a 6 month follow-up period. Figure 1 illus-
trates the design of the study. The trial was registered
(clinicaltrials.gov NCT01924702), approved by the ethics
committee
of
the
Charite
´
University
Hospital
(Berlin,
Germany) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of
Helsinki.

Patient sample
Our study group consisted of 26 right-handed, native German
speakers with chronic aphasia (412 months post-stroke) and
impaired naming ability due to a single infarction or haemor-
rhage in the left hemisphere. Aphasia type and severity was
determined using the standardized Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT,
Huber et al., 1983). None of the subjects presented with oral
apraxia, as indicated by a score of 5 2 errors during 10 imi-
tation tasks involving the lips, cheeks and tongue (Go
¨tze and
Zenz, 2005). Apraxia of speech was assessed using the
Hierarchic Wordlists (Liephold et al., 2003). Seven patients
(anodal-tDCS: n = 3, sham-tDCS: n = 4) had mild apraxia
of speech, characterized by minor impairment of rhythm, stress
or intonation. Co-morbid motor impairment (hemiparesis/
hemiplegia of the right arm and leg) was present in 14 patients
(n = 7 in each stimulation group, see Table 1).
Patients with contraindications for tDCS (e.g. cardiac pace-
maker, history of seizures), a history of alcohol or drug abuse,
other severe neurological, psychiatric or medical conditions
were excluded (n = 1 due to cerebral glioma, n = 1 due to
history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, n = 1
due to severe neuropathic pain). Patients on antidepressant or
antipsychotic medication were excluded as such medication
may interfere with tDCS effects (Stagg and Nitsche, 2011).
Of 89 patients that were screened, 26 were eligible and par-
ticipated in the study between August 2013 and May 2015
at the Charite
´ University Hospital, Berlin, Germany. Four pa-
tients were not available for the follow-up assessment due
to reasons unrelated to the study (n = 2/stimulation group;
Fig. 2). After providing written informed consent, patients
were randomly assigned to the stimulation groups, with strati-
fication factor ‘naming impairment severity’ (i.e. mean naming
performance on repeated baseline assessments, see below). For
stratification, a list with 26 cells was created (n = 13/stimula-
tion conditions) and consecutive patients were randomly as-
signed to open cells or matched pairwise until all cells were
filled. The resulting stimulation groups were matched for
naming impairment severity, sex, time since stroke and educa-
tion. Table 1 details clinical and demographic characteristics of
the sample. At the time of the study, none of the participants
received drugs other than lipid- or blood pressure lowering,
anti-platelet and thyroid hormone replacement medication,
which remained unchanged during participation. All patients
scored

normal
ranges
on
the
Beck
Depression
Inventory. Figure 3 illustrates the lesions in the two stimula-
tion groups. Lesions were drawn on high-resolution T1-
weighted MRI acquired prior to the treatment (n

 patients, one patient from each group could not be scanned
due to claustrophobia), normalized and rendered on a stand-
ard brain template as an overlay plot. Lesion sizes were com-
parable in both groups [t(22) = 1.34, P = 0.19, Table 1].
While some patients had lesions affecting parts of M1, the
hand motor cortex and underlying white matter tracts were
spared in all patients.
Selection of treatment items
Naming ability was evaluated during two baseline assessments
using a standardized battery of pictures (n = 344, Menke et
al., 2009; Meinzer et al., 2010; Flo
¨el et al., 2011). The pictures
were presented in random order on a laptop computer split
into eight sets with short breaks in between. Pictures were
presented for 3 s followed by a blank screen (up to 27 s)
and patients were asked to name each picture as accurately
as possible. Responses were recorded and subsequently ana-
lysed based on the first valid response (Dell et al., 1997). Sixty
pictures that could not be named correctly during both assess-
ments were selected for each patient and trained during ther-
apy
(trained
items).
Those
items
only
comprised
non-
responses, unrelated semantic errors, phonologically unrelated
errors and neologisms. Minor articulatory errors due to mild
apraxia of speech that was present in some of the patients
were not scored as errors during any of the assessments. The
remaining 284 pictures (which included correct responses,
omissions, semantic and phonemic paraphasias and other ut-
terances) remained untrained (untrained items) and served to
assess transfer effects (Table 1 details baseline naming per-
formance for individual patients).
Treatment
Participants
underwent
an
established
computer-assisted
naming treatment that followed the method of ‘vanishing
cues’ (Abel et al., 2005) and was administered over 2 weeks
(4 days/week, 2 � 1.5 h/day). This procedure has previously
been shown to be highly effective to improve naming ability in
chronic patients with aphasia (Menke et al., 2009; Meinzer et
al., 2010; Flo
¨el et al., 2011). It is based on an associative
learning procedure that aims at strengthening associations be-
tween target words (object pictures) and auditory and graph-
emic cues by using a shaping approach. Across five difficulty

 levels, cues were gradually reduced depending on improved
naming ability. Initially, all patients were presented with pic-
tures in combination with its spoken and written word form
and patients were asked to repeat the name (Level 1). This was
repeated until the patient scored 480% correct responses. At
the second and third levels, the picture was only cued with the
first two phonemes and graphemes or the first phonemes and
graphemes, respectively. Level 4 minimized cueing to the first
grapheme. No cues were provided at Level 5. The 80% correct
criterion applied for progression to the next level. Whenever
performance was 580% correct (Levels 2–5), a training block
of Level 1 was interspersed to provide patients with the com-
plete visual and auditory target word forms. The treatment
was supervised by an experienced speech therapist, who was
blind to the stimulation conditions and who scored each pa-
tient’s responses as correct or incorrect (the first valid response
was scored, minor articulatory difficulties were not scored as
errors).
Transcranial direct current
stimulation
Transcranial DCS was administered using a battery driven
stimulator (DC-Stimulator Plus�, NeuroConn). Stimulation dur-
ation and intensity complied with current safety recommenda-
tions (Fregni et al., 2015). The anode (5 � 7 cm2) was placed
over the left M1 representation of the hand as in our previous
studies (C3 of the 10–20 EEG system) (Lindenberg et al., 2013;
Meinzer et al., 2014c). Figure 4 details the placement and orien-
tation of the anode on a standard brain and on an individual
MRI. The cathode (10 � 10cm2) was positioned over the right
supraorbital region. The large size of this reference electrode
renders the stimulation over this area functionally ineffective.
Twenty minutes of anodal-tDCS (1 mA) were administered at
the beginning of each of the two daily treatment sessions. The
current was ramped up and down for 10 s at the beginning and
end of each stimulation session. During sham-tDCS, the current
was ramped up and remained at 1 mA only for 30 s before
ramping down, which does not affect neural functions, but as-
sures effective blinding of participants due to the initial tingling
sensation on the scalp (Gandiga et al., 2006).

 Outcome measures
All outcome measures were assessed immediately before and
after the end of the intervention and after 6 months. Assessors
were blind to the stimulation conditions. Dependent variables
were the mean change of naming ability for trained items (pri-
mary outcome) and untrained items (secondary outcome) from
baseline to both endpoints (immediate post-test, 6 months
follow-up). Within-therapy effects were probed by confronta-
tion naming of trained items (without cues) after each treat-
ment day (Days 1–8). Other secondary endpoints comprised
ratings of the quality of everyday communication that were
assessed by the German versions of two questionnaires that
have
demonstrated
reliability
and
validity
to
assess
the
impact of treatment on everyday communication ability in
aphasia, i.e. the Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI,
Lomas
et
al.,
1989)
and
the
Partner
Communication
Questionnaire (PCQ, Blomert, 1993). Ratings were completed
by the patients’ primary reference person (e.g. partner or other
family member). The CETI assesses the quality of everyday
communication relative to the patients’ premorbid status on
a scale from 1–10 (1 = much worse, 10 = same as before

 stroke) for 16 items. In the PCQ, partners rate current verbal
communication abilities in 46 situations (scale 0–5, 0 = not
possible, 5 = possible).
Statistical analyses
Given that effects of M1-tDCS in aphasia have not been tested,
the sample size calculation was based on our previous cross-
over study in healthy older adults that showed beneficial ef-
fects of this montage on word retrieval (Meinzer et al., 2014c).
This showed that 26 participants were required (� 5 0.05,
two-sided power 80%, including 15% dropout rate). Linear
mixed effect models were calculated separately for all outcome
measures (primary: trained items, secondary: untrained items,
CETI, PCQ). Models included all time points (pre, post,
follow-up) with Time and Stimulation as fixed effects; patients
were included as random factor. As baseline AAT scores of the
repeating subtest of the AAT were different in the two stimu-
lation groups (Table 1), this variable was included as covariate
in the analyses. Significant effects were followed up by post
hoc paired and unpaired t-tests as appropriate. Pearson correl-
ation assessed whether changes in naming ability (trained
items, untrained items) were associated with ratings of im-
proved everyday communication ability (CETI, PCQ). Effect
sizes were calculated for significant results (Cohen’s d).
Results
All patients believed that they had received anodal-tDCS
when questioned after the end of the 2-week treatment
period. The stimulation was tolerated well. Only mild sen-
sations (e.g. itching, tingling, slight burning feeling) during
the initial ramping up were reported.
Within treatment effects
Naming performance for trained items, as assessed immedi-
ately after the end of each treatment day, improved across
the 2-week training period [Time F(7,168) = 24.3, P 5
0.001; mean = 34.5, standard error (SE) = 3.4, confidence
interval (CI) = 27.4–41.6, d = 2.79] with comparable gains
in the two groups [Stimulation F(1,23) = 1.4, P = 0.2; inter-
action Time � Stimulation F(7,168) = 0.9, P = 0.5].
Trained items
Across the three assessments (pre, post, follow-up), there
were significant main effects for Time [F(2,45.3) = 102.1,
P 5 0.0001] and Stimulation [F(1,22.9) = 6.7, P = 0.017]
and
a
significant
interaction
of
Time
�
Stimulation
[F(2,45.5) = 5.9, P = 0.005] for trained items. Post hoc
paired t-tests showed that both treatment groups performed
above baseline immediately after the training [t(25) = 10.4,
P 5 0.0001] and during the 6-month follow-up assessment
[t(21) = 7.7, P 5 0.001]. The immediate treatment effect
tended to be larger in the group that had received anodal-
tDCS [post–pre t(24) = 1.8, P = 0.08] and gains were
significantly better maintained in this group during the
follow-up assessment [follow-up–pre t(20) = 2.8, P =
0.01].
This
was
explained
by
a
steeper
decrease
of
naming scores 6 months after the training in the sham-
tDCS group [follow-up–post t(20) = 3.9, P = 0.0008; see
Fig. 5A and Table 2 for details of effects and effect sizes].
Transfer to untrained items
For untrained items, there were significant effects for Time
[F(2,44)=38.43, P 50.001] and Time
�
Stimulation
[F(2,44)=18.1, P 5 0.0001]. Baseline performance was
comparable in both stimulation groups [t(24) = 0.94, P
= 0.93]. Generalization of treatment effects to untrained
items were found in both groups immediately after the
training [paired t-test post–pre t(25) = 5.8, P 5 0.0001],
but this effect was significantly larger in the anodal-tDCS
group [post–pre: t(24) = 3.8, P = 0.0009]. Treatment gains

up-pre t(20) = 7.3, P 5 0.0001], and only in this group,

Everyday communication
The primary reference person of each patient rated commu-
nicative effectiveness higher than at baseline immediately
after the training and at the follow-up assessment in both
stimulation groups and for both rating scales [CETI: Time

addition, there was a significant interaction of Time �
Stimulation in the CETI, that was explained by significantly
higher ratings for patients in the anodal-tDCS group imme-
diately after the end of the treatment [post–pre t(24) = 2.2,
P = 0.037, follow-up–pre, t(20) = 2.0, P = 0.055]. PCQ
ratings were higher in the anodal-tDCS group during the
follow-up [post–pre t(24) = 1.9, P = 0.06; follow-up–pre
t(20) = 2.3, P = 0.03; Fig. 6A and B, and Table 2].
Correlation between objective and
subjective measures of language
ability
Improvement of trained items was not correlated with rat-
ings of everyday communication ability immediately after
the treatment or 6 months later (all r = 0.09–37, P = 0.1–
0.6). However, the degree of improvement for untrained
items was positively correlated with ratings of improved
everyday communication immediately after the end of the
treatment (CETI r = 43, P = 0.024) and during the follow-
up (CETI r = 0.43, P = 0.043; PCQ r = 0.55, P = 0.008).
Discussion
This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated for
the first time the combined effects of tDCS and intensive
aphasia therapy on both impairment measures and func-
tional communication in post-stroke aphasia and also ad-
dressed the long-term maintenance of tDCS effects. The
main results of this trial are: (i) immediately after the end
of the intervention, naming ability for trained material was
significantly improved in both active (Cohen’s d = 3.67)
and sham-tDCS groups (d = 2.10), with numerically larger
gains in the anodal-tDCS group (d = 0.71). These large
treatment
gains
were
maintained
in
both
stimulation
groups during the 6-month follow-up assessment, which
underscores
the
effectiveness
of
the
intervention.
However, the maintenance of treatment effects was super-
ior in the anodal-tDCS group, accumulating in a large
between-group effect size 6 months later (d = 1.19); (ii) im-
portantly, we also observed significant transfer effects to
untrained material in both stimulation groups, which
were significantly larger in the anodal-tDCS group immedi-
ately after the end of the intervention (d = 1.49) and even
more pronounced at the 6-month follow-up assessment
(d = 3.12). Transfer effects were only maintained in the
group that had received anodal-tDCS; and (iii) we also
demonstrated that anodal-tDCS resulted in enhanced gen-
eralization to measures of everyday communication ability
that were confirmed during both the short-term and long-
term follow-up assessments (d = 0.75–0.99). This finding
corroborates the functional relevance of the observed im-
provement on impairment measures, which was also re-
flected
by
the
positive
correlation
between
improved
functional communication and performance on untrained

 materials in the short- and long-term. Thus, our study pro-
vides the first evidence from a randomized, controlled trial
that anodal-tDCS can induce gains in both function and
activity-related outcomes in post-stroke aphasia and that
these effects are maintained over extended periods of
time. Importantly, these effects were achieved with a
M1-tDCS montage that can be easily implemented into
standard
clinical
settings
and
may
represent
a
novel
‘backdoor’ approach to improve language recovery after
stroke.
Long-term effects of transcranial
DCS
Studies in healthy individuals have demonstrated beneficial
effects of repeated tDCS sessions on motor and cognitive
learning
that
were
maintained
for
up
to
12
months
(Dockery et al., 2009; Reis et al., 2009; Cohen Kadosh et
al., 2010; Meinzer et al., 2014a). Unlike single tDCS session
effects that are mediated by transient neural modulations
(Stagg and Nitsche, 2011), repeated stimulation sessions ad-
ministered concurrently with training are thought to act via
mechanisms similar to long-term potentiation, which is crit-
ical for neuroplasticity and memory consolidation (Reis et
al., 2009, 2015; Fritsch et al., 2010). However, while an
increasing number of studies demonstrated that tDCS can
enhance
immediate
treatment
outcome
in
aphasia
(de
Aguiar et al., 2015), only few studies addressed whether
these effects are maintained over time, using relatively
short follow-up periods of 1–4 weeks (Fridriksson et al.,
2011; Flo
¨el et al., 2011; Fiori et al., 2011; Marangolo et
al., 2013). To date, only one study assessed maintenance of
tDCS effects over several months (Vestito et al., 2014). In
this study, three patients with chronic aphasia received 10
days of naming therapy with either anodal- or sham-tDCS
administered to left frontal regions. Here, anodal-tDCS
induced superior immediate treatment effects that were
maintained for up to 4 months. In-line with those previous
studies, the present randomized, controlled trial confirmed
that beneficial training effects are maintained for at least 6
months. Importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that
repeated tDCS sessions not only resulted in enhanced long-
term improvement for specifically trained materials but also
in enhanced maintenance of transfer effects to untrained
materials and measures of functional communication.
The majority of previous tDCS studies in aphasia only
assessed stimulation effects after the end of the training
when acute stimulation effects had ceased (de Aguiar et
al., 2015). In the present study, we also assessed perform-
ance for trained items immediately after each training day.
Interestingly, there were no significant differences between
the stimulation groups with regard to naming ability across
the training period and significant between-group stimula-
tion effects only emerged during the follow-up assessments.
Our findings are thus in line with data from animal models
(Fritsch et al., 2010) and healthy individuals (Reis et al.,
2009, 2015) suggesting that multisession tDCS improves
memory consolidation by impacting on plasticity-related
protein synthesis, which is thought to be enhanced by con-
current application of tDCS during training.
Importantly, the timing of effects in our study differed
compared to previous studies in healthy young individuals,
where significant stimulation effects were found already
during the training phase and ‘forgetting-rates’ during the
follow-up periods were similar in active versus sham-tDCS
groups (Dockery et al., 2009; Reis et al., 2009, 2015;
Cohen Kadosh et al., 2010; Meinzer et al., 2014a). This
may in part be related to the advanced age of our patient
group (on average 60 years of age) and recent research
emphasized that tDCS effects may be stronger during
follow-up periods in older versus younger participants
(Flo
¨el et al., 2012; Park et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2015).
Indeed, long-term effects of tDCS 6 months after the end
of the intervention were larger than the immediate post-
training
effects
for
all
outcome
measures.
Moreover,

 enhanced maintenance of training effects in the anodal-
tDCS group were driven mainly by larger performance
decrements in the sham-group. Importantly, none of the
previous studies in healthy individuals addressed long-
term maintenance of transfer effects to untrained materials.
In the present study, we were able to demonstrate that
these were only maintained in the anodal-tDCS group 6
months after the end of the treatment. Thus, the profound
effects of tDCS on consolidation of treatment effects in the
present study further emphasize the potential of tDCS to
aid recovery from aphasia after stroke or other neuro-
logical conditions.
M1-transcranial DCS to enhance
aphasia recovery
Unlike previous tDCS studies in aphasia that targeted
domain-specific language regions (Monti et al., 2013; de
Aguiar et al., 2015), beneficial effects of tDCS were achieved
by stimulating the primary motor system that is functionally
connected
with
the
language
network
(Willems
and
Hagoort, 2007; Pulvermu
¨ller and Fadiga, 2010). From a
pragmatic point of view, M1-tDCS is easy to administer
and cost and labour-efficient because it does not require
identification of residual language regions on an individual
basis by means of pretreatment functional imaging. Thus,
the present study provides evidence for the effectiveness of
an alternative stimulation site that can easily be implemented
in clinical practice. From a theoretical perspective, recent
research has emphasized a critical role of ancillary or
domain general networks in language recovery after stroke
(for review see Geranmayeh et al., 2014). For example, upre-
gulation of the frontoparietal salience network predicted lan-
guage performance in patients with post-stroke aphasia
(Brownsett et al., 2014). With regard to language-motor
system interactions, numerous studies have demonstrated
that pre-activation of the motor system can facilitate lan-
guage processing in healthy individuals (Hadar et al.,
1998; Holle and Gunter, 2007; Dick et al., 2009) and in
aphasia (Hanlon et al., 1990; Hesse et al., 2007; Benjamin et
al., 2014; Harnish et al., 2014). Neuroanatomically, cortical
motor regions are functionally connected and mutually inter-
act with frontotemporal regions during language processing
(Pobric
and
Hamilton,
2006;
Eickhoff
et
al.,
2009;
Pulvermu
¨ller and Fadiga, 2010). However, it needs to be
acknowledged that M1-tDCS effects are not localized per
se and stimulation effects may be determined by the brain
regions engaged by a given task (i.e. in our study, a larger
language-motor network). For example, previous studies that
combined
functional
imaging
with
(intrascanner)
tDCS
demonstrated specific modulation of activity in task-relevant
brain regions at the stimulation site (Holland et al., 2011;
Meinzer et al., 2012; Ulm et al., 2015) but have also been
shown to extend to functionally connected distant brain re-
gions (Keeser et al., 2011; Lindenberg et al., 2013; Meinzer
et al., 2012, 2013, 2015; Stagg et al., 2013). Thus, it is
unlikely that the observed positive stimulation effects in
our study can only be explained by direct modulation of
the targeted (hand) motor cortex or other regions under-
neath the active electrode. A more plausible explanation is
that M1-tDCS also impacted on functionally connected task-
relevant pre-motor and frontal regions (Antal et al., 2011;
Lindenberg et al., 2013) implicated in language production.
Direct evidence for such an assumption has recently been
provided in healthy older adults (Meinzer et al., 2014c). In
this study, M1-tDCS was administered during a word-retrie-
val task and simultaneous functional MRI. Performance was
improved during anodal-versus sham-tDCS, and functional
MRI showed that this was mediated by modulation of task-
related activity in bilateral prefrontal language regions. Thus,
a tentative explanation for the positive effects observed in
the present study could be that M1-tDCS facilitated process-
ing in spared language regions, thereby providing ‘better
working conditions’ for regions engaged during therapy.
This hypothesis needs to be tested using functional ima-
ging techniques in future studies in aphasia. Moreover,
while the above studies also suggest that the positive be-
havioural results of our study cannot simply be explained
by an unspecific excitation of the entire brain, it needs to
be acknowledged that stimulation of other spared nodes
of a common language-motor network (e.g. premotor
cortex) may also be effective to enhance language treat-
ment outcome in aphasia.
This study provided the first evidence that M1-tDCS can
induce long-lasting improvement of language function and
communication after stroke, however, these findings need
to be confirmed in larger, multicentre trials and in routine
clinical settings. While this was beyond the scope of our
study, our trial provides the basis for such an endeavour in
the future. Future studies should also assure blinding of the
treating clinicians, which was not implemented in the pre-
sent study mainly for safety reasons. However, given that
the computerized treatment only required minimal involve-
ment of the therapist and that assessors were fully blinded
to the stimulation conditions, we believe that this did not
substantially affect the outcome of the present study. In
addition, we chose to target impaired word retrieval
because effective treatment approaches for naming impair-
ment are available (Menke et al., 2009; Meinzer et al.,
2010; Flo
¨el et al., 2011) and word production impairment
is
the
most
frequent
symptom
in
acute
(Lazar
and
Antoniello, 2008) and chronic aphasia (Klebic et al.,
2011). However, future studies could explore whether
M1-tDCS
can also
improve
other
aphasic
symptoms.
Nonetheless, the relevance of improving naming impair-
ment for aphasia recovery is demonstrated by concomitant
improvement of functional communication using reliable
and valid proxy measures of functional communication
(Lomas et al., 1989; Blomert, 1993). In the future, this
could be complemented by analysis of connected speech
samples, to provide additional evidence generalization of
treatment effects.

 Conclusion
This randomized, sham-tDCS controlled trial demonstrated
for the first time that multi-session tDCS can induce long-
lasting improvement of treatment outcome for trained and
untrained materials as well as functional communication.
Importantly, these add-on effects were achieved with an
easy to administer and therefore clinically feasible M1-
tDCS montage, thereby providing a novel ‘backdoor’ ap-
proach to enhance language recovery after stroke.
