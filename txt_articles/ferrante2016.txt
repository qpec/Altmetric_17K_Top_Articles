ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative appraisal of the effects on clinical outcomes of radial
access for coronary interventions in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
BACKGROUND Randomized trials investigating radial versus femoral access for percutaneous coronary interventions
have provided conflicting evidence. No comprehensive quantitative appraisal of the risks and benefits of each approach is
available across the whole spectrum of patients with stable or unstable CAD.
METHODS The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were
searched for randomized trials comparing radial versus femoral access for coronary interventions. Data were pooled by
meta-analysis using a fixed-effects or a random-effects model, as appropriate. Pre-specified subgroup analyses according
to clinical presentation, in terms of stable CAD, non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, or ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction were performed.
RESULTS Twenty-four studies enrolling 22,843 participants were included. Compared with femoral access, radial access
was associated with a significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
0.59 to 0.87; p ¼ 0.001, number needed to treat to benefit [NNTB] ¼ 160), major adverse cardiovascular events
(OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.94; p ¼ 0.002; NNTB ¼ 99), major bleeding (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.65; p < 0.001;
NNTB ¼ 103), and major vascular complications (OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.35; p < 0.001; NNTB ¼ 117). The rates of
myocardial infarction or stroke were similar in the 2 groups. Effects of radial access were consistent across the whole
spectrum of patients with CAD for all appraised endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS Compared with femoral access, radial access reduces mortality and MACE and improves safety,
with reductions in major bleeding and vascular complications across the whole spectrum of patients with CAD.

n patients with stable or unstable clin-
ical presentation undergoing coronary
angiography followed by percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI), a substantial
proportion of major bleeding occurs at the
vascular access site (1,2). Bleeding is associ-
ated with poor clinical outcomes at short-
and long-term follow-up (3,4).
The use of radial access, as an alternative
to femoral access, for coronary interventions
reduces access-site bleeding because of the
easily compressible and superficial anatomy
of this artery and improves patient comfort,
with
early
mobility
after
procedures
(5).
However, radial access may have a longer
learning curve to develop technical skills,
thus requiring higher procedure volumes to
achieve
and
maintain
proficiency
(5).
In
addition, large multicenter studies investi-
gating the value of the radial compared with the
femoral approach have focused on patients with
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and have come to
different
conclusions
with
regard
to
ischemic,
bleeding, and combined outcomes. Nevertheless, the
adoption of radial access has undergone a rapid in-
crease (6). This may be driven partly by evidence from
earlier trials showing that radial access may reduce
bleeding and has the potential to improve clinical
outcomes (7,8). In the modern era, the superiority of
radial access over femoral access may be attenuated
because of smaller arterial sheaths and targeted
anticoagulant agents that reduce bleeding risk.
The aim of this study was to provide a comprehen-
sive and quantitative assessment of evidence from
early on as well as contemporary randomized trials
appraising the effects of radial access compared with
femoral access for coronary interventions in patients
across the whole spectrum of ischemic heart disease.
METHODS
DATA SOURCES AND SEARCH STRATEGY. A meta-
analysis of randomized trials was performed accord-
ing to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 guidelines (9). Two
reviewers (G.F., M.V.) independently identified the
relevant studies by an electronic search of the MED-
LINE,
Embase,
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases
(from inception to January 2016). The
following
search terms and key words were used: “radial,”
“transradial,” “femoral,” “transfemoral,” and “ran-
domized controlled trial.” No language, publication
date, or publication status restrictions were imposed.
Conference
proceedings
(from
2010
through
December 2015) of the American Heart Association,
the American College of Cardiology, Transcatheter
Cardiovascular Therapeutics, and the European So-
ciety of Cardiology were also searched through elec-
tronic or hand searching. All suitable unpublished
completed registered studies were considered for
inclusion. We checked the reference lists of identified
reports, recent editorials, and related reviews.
STUDY SELECTION. Two reviewers (G.F., M.V.) inde-
pendently assessed trial eligibility on the basis of titles,
abstracts, full-text reports, and further information
from investigators as needed.
Discrepancies in study selection were resolved by
consensus.
Eligible
trials
had
to
satisfy
the
following
pre-specified
criteria:
1)
randomized
design
that
compared radial versus femoral access for coronary
intervention; and 2) inclusion of patients undergoing
coronary angiography followed by PCI in at least 50%
of cases. In contrast, studies were excluded if they
assessed the comparison of radial versus femoral
access in patients undergoing coronary diagnostic
procedures
only
and/or
PCI,
following
coronary
angiography, was performed in <50% cases.
DATA
EXTRACTION
AND
QUALITY
ASSESSMENT. Two
reviewers (G.F., M.V.) independently extracted data
(baseline
characteristics,
definition
of
outcomes,
numbers
of
events)
using
a
standardized
data
abstraction form. For 1 study (10), additional infor-
mation regarding data on clinical events was provided
on request by the principal investigator (S.V.R.).
Two reviewers (G.F., M.V.) independently and sys-
tematically
assessed
the
studies’
methodological
quality using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool from the
Cochrane
handbook
for
randomized
trials,
thus
following the approach that identifies selection, per-
formance, attrition, detection, reporting bias, and
other sources of bias for each study and classifies each
of these as low, unclear, or high by analyzing the
following 7 domains: random sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding of participants and of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, se-
lective outcome reporting, and “other issues” (11). A
risk for bias summary reporting each risk-for-bias item
for each included study was reported (11). Disagree-
ments were resolved by consensus of the 2 reviewers.
DATA SYNTHESIS AND DATA ANALYSIS. Outcome mea-
sures. There were 2 primary endpoints: all-cause
mortality and major bleeding. Secondary efficacy
and safety outcomes were myocardial infarction,
stroke, the composite of major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE), and major vascular complications.

 The composite of net adverse clinical events (NACE)
(i.e., MACE and major bleeding) was also assessed,
although
this
endpoint
was
available
only
in
a
subgroup
of
studies
enrolling
patients
with
non–ST-segment elevation (NSTE) ACS or ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Endpoints
were attributed according to definition and timing
used in each study. The definition of MACE consisted
of the composite of death, stroke, and myocardial
infarction in most studies. Major bleeding was defined
according to the scales used in each study (12,13).
Major vascular complications were adjudicated ac-
cording to the study definition or as hematoma >5 cm
or pseudoaneurysm if not reported in each study.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. The odds ratios (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the endpoints were
calculated from the available data. Trial-specific ORs
were combined with the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-ef-
fects model or with the DerSimonian and Laird
random-effects model if heterogeneity was statisti-
cally significant or I2 >25% (14).
The number of patients needed to treat for an
additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the num-
ber needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome
were calculated from weighted estimates of pooled
ORs from the random-effects meta-analytic model,
using the macro “metannt,” as 1/(projected control
group event rate � projected treatment group event
rate). The corresponding 95% CI was calculated by
using the 95% CI of the effect size applied to the
control group event rate.
We also calculated trial-specific absolute risk dif-
ferences with 95% CIs for each endpoint, which were
combined using a fixed-effects or a random-effects
model, as appropriate, and reported the number of
events avoided or caused per 1,000 patients treated
with the 95% CI.
The presence of heterogeneity among studies was
evaluated with the Cochran Q chi-square test, with
p # 0.10 considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance,
estimating
the
between-studies
variance
tau-square, and using the I2 test to evaluate incon-
sistency (15). The I2 statistic is derived from the Q
statistic ([Q � df/Q] � 100) and describes the per-
centage of total variation across studies that is due to
heterogeneity; values of 25%, 50%, and 75% corre-
spond to low, moderate, and high heterogeneity,
respectively (15).
The presence of publication bias was investigated
by using the Harbord test and by visual estimation
with the use of contour-enhanced funnel plots (16,17).
The interpretation and meaning of contour-enhanced
funnel
plots
have
been
reported
elsewhere
(17).
Briefly,
contour-enhanced
funnel
plots
make
it
possible to determine whether the presence of any
observed asymmetry could be related to publication
bias or to factors other than publication bias, on the
basis of which areas within the graph studies that
seem to be “missing” (to eliminate the asymmetry)
would be plotted (17).
As sensitivity analysis, we used a Bayesian method
developed for random-effects meta-analysis on the
log OR scale, reporting OR with 95% credible in-
tervals. We implemented this model in a fully prob-
abilistic
(Bayesian)
approach, which will
provide
posterior probability distributions given the model
and the data but requires that prior distributions be

 defined for all parameters in the statistical model. For
the control groups of each study, we set vague priors
on the log of the odds of the event risk using normal
distributions centered at zero with variance of 1,000.
We conducted the analyses using weakly informa-
tive prior distributions with a half-normal distribu-
tion with a mean of 0.5 and a 95% confidence
interval from 0.02 to 1.4 for tau. We also calculated
the minimum Bayes factor using the formula re-
ported by Goodman (18), where the z score was
derived using the Bayesian estimates of the popu-
lation effect “d” and its standard error, and reported
the strength of evidence of treatment effect on
the basis of the minimum Bayes factor as “weak,”
“moderate,” “moderate to strong,” or “strong to very
strong.”
Subgroup analysis. The impact of radial access on
clinical outcomes was assessed across pre-specified
subgroups defined by the type of clinical syndrome
(i.e., stable coronary artery disease, NSTE ACS, and
STEMI). With respect to the endpoints of myocardial
infarction and stroke, 2 patient subgroups only were
considered (i.e., stable coronary artery disease and
ACS), with no distinction between NSTE ACS and
STEMI, because of the lack of separate data.
Furthermore, the effect of radial PCI expertise on
clinical outcomes was assessed in a pre-specified
subgroup analysis including those studies reporting
separate outcome data according to high or low radial
PCI volume or percentage of radial PCIs performed,
according to the definition used in each study. An
interaction test was used to assess the statistical sig-
nificance of the difference between summary esti-
mates of 2 subgroups as previously recommended,
with no adjustment for multiple 2-by-2 comparisons
(19). All analyses were conducted according to the
intention-to-treat principle.
The statistical level of significance was 2-tailed
p < 0.05. Stata version 11.2 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas), Review Manager version 5.1 (Copen-
hagen, Denmark: Cochrane Collaboration), and Win-
BUGS version 1.4.3 were used for statistical analyses.

 significant heterogeneity was found for the endpoints
of all-cause death, MACE, and NACE, (Online Table 2).
Therefore, trial-specific ORs were combined using the
random-effects method for these endpoints, while
the fixed-effects model was used for the remaining
endpoints.
PUBLICATION BIAS AND ASYMMETRY. No evidence
for publication bias was detected by the Harbord test
for all endpoints, except for major bleeding (Online
Table 3). Contour-enhanced funnel plots for all end-
points are reported in Online Figures 2 to 8. Evidence
for asymmetry was found for the endpoints of major
bleeding, major vascular complications, and NACE
(Online Figures 3, 7, and 8). Smaller asymmetry was
also noted for all-cause death (Online Figure 2). Vi-
sual assessment of these plots indicated that the
observed
asymmetry
for
major
bleeding,
major
vascular complications, and NACE was likely to be
due to both publication bias on the basis of statistical
significance and other factors. Potential factors could
be the heterogeneity in the definitions of major
bleeding and major vascular complications across
studies, as well as the incomplete reporting of the
NACE endpoint in several studies enrolling patients
with STEMI.
OUTCOMES. In the overall population, radial access,
compared with femoral access, was associated with a
lower risk for all-cause mortality (OR: 0.71; 95% CI:
0.59 to 0.87; p ¼ 0.001; NNTB ¼ 160) and MACE (OR:
0.84; 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.94; p ¼ 0.002; NNTB ¼ 99)
(Table 2, Figures 2 and 3, Online Table 4). Rates of
myocardial infarction and stroke did not differ be-
tween the 2 groups (Table 2, Figures 4 and 5). The
radial approach was also associated with fewer major
bleeding events (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.65;
p < 0.001; NNTB ¼ 103) and major vascular compli-
cations (OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.35; p < 0.001;
NNTB ¼ 117) (Table 2, Figures 6 and 7, Online Table 4,

 Among patients with ACS, radial access, compared
with femoral access, was associated with fewer NACE
(OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0. 91; p ¼ 0.004; NNTB ¼ 48)
(Table 2, Online Figure 9, Online Table 4).
Similar results with respect to the comparison of
radial versus femoral access on clinical outcomes
were obtained by random-effects Bayesian meta-
analysis (Table 3). The strength of evidence for these
findings varied depending on endpoints, being strong
to very strong for major bleeding and major vascular
complications,
moderate
to
strong
for
all-cause
death, and moderate for MACE and NACE.
SUBGROUP ANALYSES. Table 4 reports the results of
subgroup analyses according to the clinical syn-
drome. The effect of the radial approach on all
appraised clinical endpoints was consistent across the
subgroups of stable coronary artery disease, NSTE
ACS, and STEMI (Figures 2 to 7, Table 4). However, a
quantitative interaction indicating greater benefit of
radial
access
on
major
bleeding
among
patients
with stable coronary syndrome than with NSTE ACS
(p for interaction ¼ 0.01) or STEMI (p for interaction ¼
0.06) was observed (Figure 6, Table 3). Trends toward
higher benefit of radial access on NACE were noted in
patients with STEMI compared with NSTE ACS (p for
interaction ¼ 0.06) (Online Figure 9, Table 4).
In a pre-specified subgroup pooled analysis of the
RIVAL and MATRIX studies (20,21), radial access,
compared with femoral access, was associated with
better clinical outcomes among centers with high
radial expertise, but not among centers with low
radial expertise (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
The main findings of this meta-analysis including
22,843 patients across the whole spectrum of patients
with CAD undergoing coronary angiography followed
by PCI, if indicated, are as follows: 1) the use of radial
compared with femoral access is associated with a
significant 29% relative risk reduction in all-cause
mortality
and
a
16%
relative
risk
reduction
in

 MACE; 2) the use of radial access is associated with a
lower risk for major bleeding and major vascular
complications that is reduced by 47% and 77%,
respectively; and 3) the rates of myocardial infarction
and stroke after transradial intervention are compa-
rable with those of femoral access.
Bayesian
analysis
confirmed
these
findings,
showing that the level of evidence for a beneficial
effect of radial access was strong to very strong for
the endpoint of major bleeding and major vascular
complications,
moderate
to
strong
for
all-cause
death, and moderate for MACE.
Pre-specified subgroup analyses found that the
beneficial effects of radial access on clinical outcomes
are largely consistent across stable or unstable pre-
sentation as well as type of ACS. Importantly, the
benefits of radial approach were realized at centers
that had high levels of radial expertise, which likely
performed transradial procedures routinely.
These findings support the use of radial access as
the default approach for coronary angiography fol-
lowed by PCI in the whole spectrum of patients with
CAD undergoing invasive management and strongly
support a change in the “femoral first” paradigm to a
“radial first” approach.
The
potential
benefits
of
the
radial
approach
compared with femoral access have been suggested
by multiple individual studies and meta-analyses
over the course of the past 20 years. However, the
radial approach has also been challenged as being the
more technically demanding procedure and as such
requires longer procedure time, greater radiation
(44), and a steep learning curve (45,46). Ball et al. (45)
reported an inverse relationship between PCI failure
and
operator
volume
for
transradial
procedures
showing that a case volume of at least 50 PCIs is
required to achieve proficiency similar to that of op-
erators performing >300 cases. A large nationally

 representative study in the United States suggested
that the learning curve may be even shorter with
procedural metrics plateauing at 30 to 50 cases (47).
This meta-analysis provides evidence supporting
the
implementation
and
development
of
such
training programs for radial access across different
settings. Indeed, at the starting level of training (i.e.,
among patients with stable coronary syndromes, this
meta-analysis shows that radial access, compared
with femoral access, improves safety by significantly
reducing major bleeding and major vascular compli-
cations). Of note, the magnitude of these reductions
(i.e., 76% and 85% risk reductions, respectively) is
numerically sounder than that observed in the overall
population or among patients with ACS. Furthermore,
no evidence for interaction between this patient
subgroup and radial access with respect to the end-
points of mortality or MACE was observed, thus
indicating a consistent beneficial effect of radial
access in this subgroup. Therefore, these advantages
should be considered valid reasons to promote pro-
ficiency of interventional cardiologists in the radial
approach as soon as possible during the learning
curve.
Importantly,
this
meta-analysis
provides
the
largest body of evidence on randomized comparisons
between radial and femoral access in the subgroup of
patients with NSTE ACS. A pooled analysis of 3 ran-
domized studies enrolling only patients with NSTE
ACS, RIVAL (21), MATRIX (20), and SAFE-PCI (10),
was performed with data provided by the trial in-
vestigators (10). Before this analysis was done, data
on patients with NSTE ACS was available from the
large-scale RIVAL trial only (21). This trial enrolled
nearly 7,000 patients with NSTE ACS or STEMI and
reported a lack of significant differences in mortality
or MACE rates between patients randomized to radial
or femoral access in the entire study population.
However, a significant interaction between the clin-
ical syndrome (i.e., STEMI vs. NSTE ACS) and the

 randomized treatment on ischemic endpoints was
reported, with radial access being associated with
significant reductions in mortality and MACE among
patients with STEMI, whereas no such benefit was
observed in patients with NSTE ACS (43). In the
recently published large-scale MATRIX trial (20),
which enrolled >8,000 patients with NSTE ACS or
STEMI, radial access was associated with a significant
28% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality and
a 15% relative risk reduction for MACE, although this
effect did not meet the pre-specified alpha level of
2.5%. In the SAFE-PCI trial (10)—the first U.S.-based,
multicenter, prospective, randomized trial, enrolling
1,787 female patients with stable coronary syndromes
or ACS—radial access was associated with a significant
68%
risk
reduction
in
the
primary
endpoint
of
bleeding and vascular complications. Yet focusing on
patients who underwent PCI after index coronary
angiography, no formal advantage was noted for
radial over femoral access. This may be explained by
the limited sample size, as a signal for interaction was
noted between patients undergoing PCI and those
undergoing diagnostic catheterization only.
This pooled analysis, comprising 9,876 patients
with NSTE ACS, shows that radial access improves
safety
and
efficacy,
with
reductions
in
major
bleeding, mortality, and MACE, consistent with the
results observed in the main analysis. Furthermore, a
significant reduction
of
the
NACE
endpoint
was
observed favoring radial access.
Nevertheless, most studies included in this meta-
analysis enrolled patients with STEMI. In the STEMI-
RADIAL (ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated
by Radial or Femoral Approach) trial (41), no mortality
or MACE reduction with radial access was observed
among 707 patients with STEMI undergoing primary
PCI, while significant reductions in major bleeding
and severe access site complications were reported.

study
(40),
which
enrolled 1,001 patients with STEMI, radial access was
associated with a significant reduction in mortality,
MACE, and bleeding. In the subgroup of patients with
STEMI in the RIVAL study, radial access was associ-
ated
with
significant reduction
in
mortality
and
MACE, but not in major bleeding (43).
Several studies have reported a strong association
between
post-procedural
bleeding
and
vascular
complications and subsequent mortality (3,48–50).
Blood transfusions have also been associated with
increased mortality in patients undergoing PCI (48) or
with ACS (51). Furthermore, bleeding has been linked
to increased risk for ischemic events (49,50). Hem-
orrhagic and ischemic PCI-related risks are higher in
patients with STEMI (52). The finding of a significant
risk
reduction
in
all-cause
mortality
and
major
bleeding in this meta-analysis, in particular among
patients with STEMI, reinforces the potential causal
the link between bleeding and mortality. Plausible
explanations for the beneficial effects of radial access
on mortality reduction are therefore the reduction
in major vascular complications, major bleeding,
and avoidance of subsequent blood transfusions. In
addition, the effect of antithrombotic therapies such
as higher dose of heparin and proportion of patients
on glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and a lower use
of bivalirudin used in previous STEMI trials might
have contributed to enhance the bleeding-sparing
effect of radial access compared with femoral ac-
cess (53). However, no evidence for possible treat-
ment heterogeneity was previously observed with
respect to mortality or MACE regarding the use
of bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin with or
without glycoprotein inhibitors in the large MATRIX
trial.
In contrast, in the RIVAL study, an interaction be-
tween treatment effect and radial PCI volume was
observed, indicating that radial access could be bene-
ficial compared with femoral access at high-volume
centers for radial procedures (54). In the MATRIX
study the proportion of PCI undertaken transradially
emerged as a potential effect modifier for both copri-
mary endpoints of MACE and NACE and for overall
mortality (20). Our pre-specified subgroup pooled
analysis of these 2 trials shows that radial access im-
proves clinical outcomes at centers with high radial PCI
volumes. These findings suggest the importance of
developing training programs to improve the efficacy
of radial access in coronary interventions.
A well-conducted single randomized trial has the
advantage of including a more homogeneous patient
population and assessing well-defined hypotheses,
but it may suffer from type II error in detecting sig-
nificant differences between treatment arms, leading

findings,

 provide sufficient evidence that may help clinical
decision making in areas of uncertainty.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. Our study had important limi-
tations. With respect to the endpoint of NACE, which
was assessed in the subgroup of studies enrolling
patients with ACS, the detection of significant het-
erogeneity and bias may reduce the strength of this
analysis. The presence of significant heterogeneity
for the endpoints of all-cause death and of MACE in
the subgroup of patients with NSTE ACS is another
limitation. In general, despite lack of statistically
significant heterogeneity, studies differed with re-
gard to the enrolled patient population, trial design,
primary endpoints, endpoint definition, and length of
follow-up. Bleeding complications were classified
according to different scales across studies. Despite
the lack of statistically significant publication bias as
assessed
by
the
Harbord
test,
contour-enhanced
funnel plots showed the presence of some asymme-
try, partially related to publication bias, for some
endpoints. Furthermore, systematic assessment of
bias found the existence of high risk for bias for most
studies, in particular those enrolling patients with
stable ischemic syndromes, which had smaller sample
size and were published earlier.
Although
this
meta-analysis
provides
evidence
supporting
the
superiority
of
radial
approach,
compared with the femoral approach, differences in
absolute event rates between groups were small for
several endpoints, leading to a number needed to
treat to benefit or harm greater than 100.
Finally, caution
is needed when
dealing with
interaction tests for the assessment of differences
between subgroups. Indeed, interaction tests may be
affected by type II error, so we cannot definitively
rule out the existence of smaller than anticipated
differences in treatment effect among subgroups.
However, these tests may also carry the risk for type I
error when performing multiple 2-by-2 comparisons
between subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS
This meta-analysis of randomized studies provides
comprehensive findings about the clinical effects
of
radial
compared
with
femoral
access
among
patients undergoing coronary interventions. There
was strong to very strong evidence that radial access,
compared with femoral access, improves safety, with
reductions in major bleeding and major vascular
complications;
moderate
to
strong
evidence
that
radial access is associated with reduction in all-cause
death; and moderate evidence that radial access re-
duces MACE. These findings support the use of radial
access as the default approach for patients undergo-
ing coronary interventions.

PERSPECTIVES
WHAT IS KNOWN? Compared with femoral
access, radial access reduces access-site bleeding
and allows early patient mobilization. Bleeding
is associated with worse short- and long-term
clinical outcomes, in particular among patients
with ACS.
WHAT IS NEW? In patients across the whole
spectrum of coronary heart disease, radial access
improves clinical outcomes compared with femoral
access, as it reduces all-cause mortality and
MACE. Radial access also improves safety, with
reductions in major bleeding and major vascular
complications.
WHAT IS NEXT? The mechanisms by which radial
access is associated with reduced all-cause mortality
compared with femoral access, specifically whether
this involves a reduction in the risk for major bleeding,
require additional studies.
