Identification of novel activity against Borrelia burgdorferi
persisters using an FDA approved drug library
Jie Feng1, Ting Wang1, Wanliang Shi1, Shuo Zhang1, David Sullivan1, Paul G Auwaerter2 and Ying Zhang1
Although antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease is effective in the majority of cases, especially during the early phase of the disease, a
minority of patients suffer from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). It is unclear what mechanisms drive this problem, and
although slow or ineffective killing of Borrelia burgdorferi has been suggested as an explanation, there is a lack of evidence that viable
organisms are present in PTLDS. Although not a clinical surrogate, insight may be gained by examining stationary-phase in vitro
Borrelia burgdorferi persisters that survive treatment with the antibiotics doxycycline and amoxicillin. To identify drug candidates that
can eliminate B. burgdorferi persisters more effectively, we screened an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library
consisting of 1524 compounds against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi by using a newly developed high throughput SYBR Green I/
propidium iodide (PI) assay. We identified 165 agents approved for use in other disease conditions that had more activity than
doxycycline and amoxicillin against B. burgdorferi persisters. The top 27 drug candidates from the 165 hits were confirmed to have
higher anti-persister activity than the current frontline antibiotics. Among the top 27 confirmed drug candidates from the 165 hits,
daptomycin, clofazimine, carbomycin, sulfa drugs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole), and certain cephalosporins (e.g. cefoperazone) had the
highest anti-persister activity. In addition, some drug candidates, such as daptomycin and clofazimine (which had the highest activity
against non-growing persisters), had relatively poor activity or a high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against growing B.
burgdorferi. Our findings may have implications for the development of a more effective treatment for Lyme disease and for the relief of
long-term symptoms that afflict some Lyme disease patients.

INTRODUCTION
Lyme disease is a multisystem disease that is caused by Borrelia burg-
dorferi sensu stricto in North America. The infection is transmitted to
humans by tick vectors that normally feed upon rodents, reptiles, birds
and deer.1 In 2012, Lyme disease was the most common vector-borne
infection in the United States, with 22 014 confirmed and 8817 prob-
able cases, although many cases are unreported to US state health
departments.2
Antibiotic treatment is effective in the majority of Lyme disease cases.
However, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), approxi-
mately 10%–20% of patients treated for Lyme disease with the recom-
mended 2–4 week antibiotic therapy still have lingering symptoms of
fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches.3 In some cases, these symptoms
can continue for 6 months or more after the initial diagnosis and treat-
ment, a condition that is referred to as ‘‘post-treatment Lyme disease
syndrome’’ (PTLDS). The actual numbers of PTLDS cases is
unknown, but recruitment of these patients for clinical trials has been
difficult.4–6 A greater percentage of patients experience symptoms that
slowly resolve during the first few months after therapy.7 Why symp-
toms such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and subjective neurocog-
nitive dysfunction slowly resolve or remain in certain patients is
unclear. Considerations may include persisting immunological res-
ponses that may be independent of continued infection or possibly
driven by the continued presence of antigenic debris,8 as well as per-
sisting organisms. The question of whether B. burgdorferi may persist
in some patients after antibiotic therapy and further evade host
immune clearance has been raised by some researchers, but the idea
is controversial.9–10
Although animals do not experience symptoms that might be
judged to be PTLDS, in various animal models (mice, dogs and rhesus
macaque monkeys), antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, ceftriaxone
or tigecycline has not fully eradicated B. burgdorferi, as determined by
methods including xenodiagnosis, although viable organisms have not
been able to be cultured in conventional culture media.11–14 Others
have raised concerns about such findings, including the use of high
concentration inocula and the use of stationary-phase organisms for
infection, insufficient antibiotic dosing and other methodological
issues, including concerns that rodents are a natural reservoir of
B. burgdorferi and that studies of persistence would not approximate
human infections.15–16 Although a number of prospective, rando-
mized clinical studies have demonstrated no significant beneficial
effect of additional antibiotic therapy with conventionally employed
antibiotic monotherapy and no evidence of the continued presence of
B. burgdorferi in patients with long-term symptoms,6,17 other trials
have reported improved fatigue symptoms after prolonged intraven-
ous ceftriaxone treatment.18 Intriguingly, a recent study in humans

 demonstrated the recovery of B. burgdorferi DNA by xenodiagnoses in
a patient with PTLDS despite antibiotic treatment.19 In addition, a
recent mouse study observed a resurgence of B. burgdorferi DNA after
12 months treatment with Lyme antibiotics, and the RNA transcrip-
tion of multiple B. burgdorferi genes was detected in mouse tissues
despite a non-culturable state.13
Findings that suggest the continued presence of B. burgdorferi in
some form indicate that current Lyme disease treatment may not
sufficiently eliminate B. burgdorferi persisters or that the immune
system fails to clear persisting organisms or bacterial debris, which
may be the underlying cause for those who suffer from unresolved
Lyme disease symptoms. These factors may also be responsible for
antibiotic-refractory arthritis, as suggested in a murine model in
which spirochetal antigens appeared to persist around cartilage.8 To
date, there is no effective antibiotic treatment or preventative strategy
for those who suffer from persistent symptoms after contracting Lyme
disease.
Some experimental studies have observed at least three morphologic
forms of persistent B. burgdorferi: spirochete, spheroplast (or L-form),
and cystic or round-body forms.10,20–21 There have been reports of
spheroplast or cystic forms in humans, but it is unclear whether such
morphologic variants exist with any frequency in vivo, and no study
has yet evaluated a link with clinical disease or determined the effect of
antibiotic treatment in humans.22 These morphological variants have
altered antibiotic susceptibilities.23 Frontline drugs such as doxycycline
and amoxicillin kill the replicating spirochetal form of B. burgdorferi
quite effectively, but they exhibit little activity against non-replicating
persisters that are enriched in the stationary phase or in biofilm-like
aggregates of B. burgdorferi.23 Although some antibiotics have been
tested for their activity against B. burgdorferi, the full spectrum of
antibiotic susceptibility for B. burgdorferi has not been determined.24
In addition, there has been no study to systematically identify or assess
drugs targeting B. burgdorferi persisters.
Because Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs
have relatively clear safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in patients,
a study examining whether existing drugs effectively eliminate Borrelia
burgdorferi may lead to quicker implementation than the development
of novel compounds. We recently developed a new SYBR Green I/
propidium iodide (PI) assay for rapid viability assessment of B. burg-
dorferi in a 96-well plate format that is superior to the current com-
mercially available LIVE/DEAD BacLight viability assay (Feng et al.,
unpublished data). Using this new assay, we screened an FDA-approved
drug library on stationary-phase B. burgdorferi persisters and identified
a number of interesting drug candidates that have excellent activity
against in vitro B. burgdorferi persisters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strain, media and culture
Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 (ATCC 35210) was obtained from the
American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). B. burgdorferi
was cultured in BSK-H medium (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.,
Mumbai, India) with 6% rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA). All culture media were filter-sterilized using a 0.2 mm
filter. Cultures were incubated in sterile 50 mL closed conical tubes
(BD Biosciences, CA, USA) at 33 6
C without antibiotics. After 6–7
days, the B. burgdorferi reached stationary phase in the culture system
(Figure 1A). Then, 7-day-old stationary-phase B. burgdorferi cul-
tures were transferred to 96-well tissue culture microplates for drug
screening.
Microscopy techniques
Specimens were examined using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope
equipped with differential interference contrast and epifluorescent
illumination and recorded with a SPOT slider color camera. Cell
proliferation assays were performed by direct counting using a
bacterial counting chamber (Hausser Scientific Partnership, PA,
USA) and differential interference contrast microscopy. To assay
the viability of B. burgdorferi, the SYBR Green I/PI assay or
LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability assay was performed. The
ratio of live (green) and dead (red) B. burgdorferi was calculated by
counting these cells using a bacterial counting chamber and epi-
fluorescence microscopy.
Antibiotics and the FDA drug library
Antibiotics, including doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, clofa-
zimine, and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), were purchased from Sigma
and dissolved in appropriate solvents25 to form stock solutions. All
antibiotic stocks were filter-sterilized using a 0.2 mm filter.
The FDA-approved drugs were assembled according to the Johns
Hopkins Clinical Compound Library (JHCCL) version 1.3.26 The FDA
drug library was prepared as 10 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulf-
oxide and was arrayed in a total of 24 96-well plates, leaving the first
and last columns in each plate for controls. Each drug solution in these
master plates was diluted with phosphate buffer solution to produce
500 mM pre-diluted plates. The first and last columns in each pre-
diluted plate included a blank control, doxycycline control, and amo-
xicillin control. The pre-diluted drug plates were sealed and stored at
2206
C.
Screening of FDA-approved drug library in the B. burgdorferi
stationary-phase persister model
In our preliminary studies, we determined that stationary-phase
B. burgdorferi were refractory to killing by the frontline drugs, doxy-
cycline or amoxicillin (Figure 2) and could thus serve as a persister
model for drug screens. To qualitatively determine the effect of FDA-
approved drugs on B. burgdorferi persisters, each compound (10 mL)
from the pre-diluted stock was added to 7-day-old B. burgdorferi sta-
tionary-phase culture in the screening plate. The final volume per well
was adjusted to 100 mL to achieve a final drug library concentration of
50 mM in the drug screen. The plates were sealed and placed in a 336
C
incubator for 7 days.
To assay live and dead cells in the screening plates, a SYBR Green I/PI
assay was used as described in our previous study (Feng et al., unpub-
lished data). Briefly, SYBR Green I (10 0003stock, Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA) (10 mL) was mixed with 30 mL propidium iodide
(20 mM, Sigma) into 1.0 mL of sterilized distilled water. Staining mix-
ture (10 mL) was added to each well and mixed thoroughly. The plates
were incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. With the
excitation wavelength set at 485 nm, the fluorescence intensities at
535 nm (green emission) and 635 nm (red emission) were measured
for each well of the screening plate using an HTS 7000 plus Bio Assay
Reader (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Meanwhile, B. burg-
dorferi suspensions (live and 70% isopropyl alcohol killed) at five differ-
ent proportions of live: dead cells (0:10, 2:8, 5:5, 8:2, 10:0) were mixed
and added to the wells of the 96-well plate. Then, SYBR Green I/PI
reagent was added to each of the five samples, and the green/red fluor-
escence ratios for each proportion of live/dead B. burgdorferi were mea-
sured using the HTS 7000 plus as above. Using least-square fitting
analysis, the regression equation and regression curve of the relationship
between percentage of live bacteria and green/red fluorescence ratios

 were obtained. The regression equation was used to calculate the per-
centage of live cells in each well of the screening plate. Based on the green
fluorescence to red fluorescence ratio, we determined that the SYBR
Green I/PI assay is superior to all other assays for measuring the viability
of B. burgdorferi in terms of reliability, sensitivity, and speed. The BSK-H
medium, which produced a high background for the BacLight viability
assay, did not affect the SYBR Green I/PI assay, and the viability of B.
burgdorferi cultures could be directly measured using a microtiter plate
reader. Thus, the SYBR Green I/PI assay provides a convenient and more
sensitive assay for evaluating the antibiotic susceptibility of B. burgdorferi
than other currently used viability assays, such as the LIVE/DEAD
BacLight method, and it can be used for high-throughput screening of
new drugs. Some effective candidates were further confirmed by epi-
fluorescence microscope counting.
Minimum inhibitory concentration determination
The standard microdilution method was used to determine the anti-
biotic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) that would inhibit
visible growth of B. burgdorferi after a 72 h incubation period.23,27–28

diluted antibiotic (10 mL) was added to the culture. All experiments
were run in triplicate. The 96-well plate was sealed and placed in an
incubator at 336
C for 5 days. Cell proliferation was assessed using the
SYBR Green I/PI assay and a bacterial counting chamber after the
incubation.
RESULTS
Morphology of B. burgdorferi during different growth phases
B. burgdorferi was grown in BSK-H medium for up to 11 days, and cell
numbers were determined by microscopy at various time points
(Figure 1A). Based on the cell number increase, 2–5-day cultures were
considered log-phase cultures, whereas 6–11-day cultures were con-
sidered stationary phase because B. burgdorferi growth reached its peak
(53107 spirochetes/mL) after 5–6 days, and the cell density remained
relatively constant from 6–11 days of incubation (Figure 1A). Multiple
morphological forms of B. burgdorferi, i.e., a spirochetal form, round
bodies (cysts), and biofilms, have been observed and have different
antibiotic susceptibilities.20,23 We observed that B. burgdorferi cultures
were primarily in the spirochetal form during the log phase (Figure 1B,
left panel), but variant forms such as coccoid or round-body forms
and micro-colonies were significantly more abundant in stationary-
phase cultures (Figure 1B, right panel).
Stationary-phase B. burgdorferi bacteria are tolerant to antibiotics
and are used as a persister model for drug screens
Previous studies and clinical experiences have demonstrated that high
doses of doxycycline and amoxicillin used for Lyme disease treatment
exhibit bactericidal activity against B. burgdorferi.24 These antibiotics
do not kill the cystic or round-body forms of B. burgdorferi, but
metronidazole does have activity against the cystic form of B. burg-
dorferi.29 Here, we tested the efficacy of commonly used drugs (dox-
ycycline, amoxicillin and metronidazole) against log phase and
stationary-phase B. burgdorferi and evaluated their susceptibility using
the SYBR Green I/PI assay, as described in the MATERIALS AND
METHODS section. The results demonstrated that the current anti-
biotics, doxycycline and amoxicillin, were highly active against log-
phase B. burgdorferi but had little activity against stationary-phase
B. burgdorferi (Figure 2). Metronidazole had some activity against
log-phase B. burgdorferi but had little activity against stationary-phase
B. burgdorferi (Figure 2). These findings suggest that the current anti-
biotics used to treat Lyme disease would have little or no activity on
B. burgdorferi persisters, if existing, in vivo. Thus, we chose the
B. burgdorferi stationary-phase culture at 7 days as a persister model
to screen for drugs targeting B. burgdorferi persisters as described below.
FDA drug library screen to identify drugs that are effective against
dormant B. burgdorferi persisters
In our previous study, we observed that the number of green and red
fluorescent organisms counted by microscopy correlated well with the
number obtained by the SYBR Green I/PI plate assay, which can be
used as a high-throughput screening method for rapid viability assess-
ment of B. burgdorferi (Feng et al., unpublished data). To identify
drugs that have activity against B. burgdorferi persisters, we used sta-
tionary-phase B. burgdorferi as a persistence model (see above section)
to screen an FDA-approved drug library. The currently used Lyme
disease treatment antibiotics, doxycycline and amoxicillin, were
included in each plate as control drugs. Consistent with the above
results (Figure 2), doxycycline and amoxicillin had poor activity
against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi persisters, and wells treated
with each of these two antibiotics contained 75% and 76% viable
stationary cells, respectively, compared with 93% viable cells in the
drug-free control (Table 1). Of the 1524 drugs in the FDA-approved
drug library tested, 165 had higher activity against B. burgdorferi per-
sisters than doxycycline and amoxicillin.
Based on the results of the primary screen, we selected some active
candidates for rescreening using the SYBR Green I/PI assay and micro-
scope counting. Microscope counting further validated the effective
drug candidates identified using the SYBR Green I/PI assay with good
overall agreement, as the largest difference was less than 20%. From
the rescreens and confirmation by microscopy, we were able to con-
firm the 27 top active hits that had a significant difference in anti-
persister activity over the current Lyme disease antibiotic amoxicillin
(P,0.05) (Table 1). The top 27 hits remained the same when doxycy-
cline was used as a control drug for comparison.
We identified several FDA-approved drugs that had good activity
against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi. The anti-persister activities of
some drugs were significantly higher than the frontline antibiotics,
doxycycline and amoxicillin (Table 1). For example, daptomycin, clo-
fazimine, carbomycin and some cephalosporin antibiotics (such as
cefoperazone, cephalothin, cefotiam and cefuroxime) had among
the highest activities against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi persisters.
Antimalarial antibiotics(amodiaquine and quinine), aminoglycoside
streptomycin, bismuth, tetracycline, and sulfa drugs also had relatively
high activity against B. burgdorferi persisters (Table 1). We also
included the currently used Lyme disease treatment antibiotics for
comparison with the new active hits. It is interesting to note that
cephalosporin antibiotics, ceftriaxone and cefuroxime, and tigecycline
had some activity against persisters, but their anti-persister activities
were not as strong as cefoperazone, daptomycin, clofazimine or car-
bomycin (Table 1). Doxycycline, amoxicillin, penicillin G, macrolide
antibiotics, azithromycin and clarithromycin had relatively poor
activity against B. burgdorferi persisters (Table 1).
Although most drugs did not affect the SYBR Green I/PI assay, some
colored compounds caused interference in the SYBR Green I/PI assay.
For example, pyrvinium pamoate and doxorubicin were identified by
the SYBR Green I/PI assay as having activity, but microscopic count-
ing proved otherwise. We found that these red compounds contrib-
uted to the background, causing false positive results. Thus, validation
by other methods, such as microscopic counting, is necessary to con-
firm the SYBR Green I/PI data.
Relationship between MIC values and anti-persister activity
Antibiotics that have good activity against growing bacteria (a low
MIC) may not have good activity against non-replicating persisters,
and vice versa.30 However, some antibiotics, such as the new tuber-
culosis drug candidates TMC207 and PA-824, have good activity for
growing bacteria and non-growing persisters.31 Thus, we sought to
determine the MICs of some antibiotics with good anti-persister acti-
vity against B. burgdorferi using the new SYBR Green I/PI assay and
microscope counting. The results obtained by the two methods had
good overall concordance. The MIC values (Table 2) of doxycycline,
amoxicillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole were in agreement with
previous studies,23,24 and these antibiotics had low activity against B.
burgdorferi persisters. We also observed that the macrolide carbomy-
cin, cephalosporins, cefoperazone and cefotiam, and sulfamethoxa-
zole, were highly active against log-phase replicating B. burgdorferi,
having low MICs (Table 2) in addition to having good activity for
stationary-phase B. burgdorferi persisters. Conversely, daptomycin
and clofazimine were less potent against replicating B. burgdorferi,

Emerging Microbes and Infections
 having relatively high MICs, 12.5–25 mg/mL and 6.25 mg/mL, respect-
ively, but had excellent anti-persister activity (Table 2, Figures 3D and
3G). With the exception of clofazimine and metronidazole, the Cmax
values of the drug candidates were generally higher than the MIC
values (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
The current antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease, doxycycline and
amoxicillin, have little or no activity against B. burgdorferi persisters in
vitro (Table 1, Figure 3). There has been significant interest in iden-
tifying drugs that target persisters in general,32 and B. burgdorferi
persisters in particular.20 However, because of the technical challenge
of the current B. burgdorferi culture system, it has not been possible to
apply the high throughput methodology that has been used to identify
antibiotics active against persisters of other bacteria to B. burgdorferi.
We have recently developed a rapid and convenient SYBR Green I/PI

 viability assay amenable to high-throughput screening to identify new
drugs targeting B. burgdorferi persisters (Feng et al., unpublished
data). Using this rapid method, we screened the FDA approved drug
library for activity against non-replicating persisters of B. burgdorferi
and identified a number of interesting drug candidates that have
excellent anti-persister activity (Table 1). These include daptomycin,
clofazimine, carbomycin, certain cephalosporins, and some sulfa
drugs. Most of the candidate drugs are used for treatment of infections
other than Lyme disease and would represent a novel use of old drugs
for anti-persister activity.
Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that has been used in the
treatment of severe infections caused by antibiotic resistant gram-
positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Daptomycin
can disrupt bacterial cell membrane function, including insertion into
the membrane, creating pores that allow cells to leak ions, which
results in rapid membrane depolarization, loss of membrane potential
and bacterial cell death.33 We determined that daptomycin had the
highest activity against B. burgdorferi persisters among all the active
hits (Table 1, Figure 3D) but had a high MIC (12.5–25 mg/mL) against
log-phase organisms (Table 2). The B. burgdorferi stationary-phase
cells treated by daptomycin had almost all red fluorescence as spiro-
chetes (Figure 3D). This result indicated the daptomycin could simi-
larly disrupt the cell membrane of B. burgdorferi, causing PI dye to
permeate the cell, leading to cell death. Microscope examination
revealed spirochetal shaped remnants after daptomycin treatment
(Figure 3A), suggesting that the cells were dead and did not change
form to coccoid shape, which occurred following cefoperazone and
tetracycline treatment (Figures 3E and 3I).
Macrolides and ketolides have been studied in vitro for activity
against B. burgdorferi.24 Here, we observed that carbomycin (Table 1,
Figure 3G), a 16-membered macrolide, had higher bactericidal activity
against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi than the classic macrolides
such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin. The MIC
data (Table 2) demonstrated that carbomycin was also effective against
multiplying B. burgdorferi. Macrolides that can penetrate B. burgdor-
feri cells may have greater activity than penicillin or ceftriaxone.
Carbomycin may be a candidate for further investigation to enhance
monotherapy treatment of Lyme disease.
b-Lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cefuroxime are com-
monly used in the treatment of Lyme disease in clinical settings.24 b-
Lactams induce the round-body form of B. burgdorferi by disrupting
the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of cell walls.20,34 Microscopic
examination determined that the round-body forms were the majority
of cells in cefoperazone treated stationary-phase B. burgdorferi cultures
(Figure 3E). According to the MICs measured by previous studies and
in our experiments, all b-lactams had good activity against replicating
B. burgdorferi, but the effects of the b-lactam antibiotics differed
greatly on stationary-phase cells. Cefoperazone (a third generation
cephalosporin) appears to be the best b-lactam antibiotic against sta-
tionary-phase B. burgdorferi, followed by some second generation
cephalosporins such as cefotiam (Figure 3H), cefmetazole and cefoni-
cid. Consistent with previous studies,24 we also observed that first
generation cephalosporins had very limited activity against station-
ary-phase B. burgdorferi. It is likely that the side chain linked to the
b-lactam ring in the cephalosporin may be responsible for the pref-
erential activity of certain cephalosporins against B. burgdorferi pers-
isters. Future structure activity relationship studies are needed to
confirm this possibility.
Doxycycline is used clinically as a frontline drug for treating Lyme
disease. Doxycycline has low MIC values24 and good activity on mul-
tiplying B. burgdorferi. Interestingly, we observed that tetracycline had
higher activity against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi persisters than
doxycycline (Table 1). This result is consistent with a previous study,

 which determined that tetracycline is more active than doxycycline
in a minimum bactericidal concentration test.35 Consistent with this
finding, we observed that most cells in the stationary-phase B. burgdor-
feri cultures treated with tetracycline had round-body forms
(Figure 3I), in contrast to stationary-phase B. burgdorferi cultures
treated with doxycycline, which remained in spirochetal form
(Figure 3B). B. burgdorferi can form different morphological shapes
in the stationary phase or under adverse conditions, and tetracycline
may be ineffective against some cell morphologies, such as round
bodies (cysts).23
Clofazimine was originally developed for the treatment of tuber-
culosis and currently is commonly used for the treatment of leprosy.36
Additionally, with the increasing drug-resistant TB problem, it has
been used for the treatment of MDR-TB.37 Clofazimine is thought
to act through different mechanisms on mycobacteria, including
membrane destabilization, the production of reactive oxygen species
and the inhibition of membrane energy production.37 Here, we
observed that clofazimine was highly active against stationary-phase
B. burgdorferi persisters (Figure 3F), although the MIC of clofazimine
was relatively high (6.25 mg/mL). The preferential activity of clofazi-
mine against B. burgdorferi persisters may be due to its high lipophi-
licity and its effects on the membrane. It is of interest to note that
clofazimine is known to accumulate in host tissues,37 and this property
may allow clofazimine to accumulate to high concentrations and act
preferentially against B. burgdorferi persisters if they occur in human
tissues. Future studies are needed to test this possibility.
Amphotericin B is a powerful antifungal drug that targets sterols in
fungal cell membranes, forming a transmembrane channel that leads
to ion leakage.38 Because sterol mainly exists in the membranes of
eukaryotes, amphotericin B is not a good agent to control prokaryotes.
Because B. burgdorferi is one of the rare prokaryotes that possesses
cholesterol and cholesterol glycolipids in its membranes,39 it is not
surprising that amphotericin B had some activity against stationary-
phase B. burgdorferi persisters (Table 1). Its activity was comparable to
colistin, but it was less active than daptomycin (Table 1).
Amphotericin B may also target the sterol lipid rafts in the membrane
of B. burgdorferi.
In addition, some sulfa drugs such as sulfameter and sulfisoxazole were
observed to be effective against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi, while
sulfamethoxazole exhibited low MIC values (f0.2 mg/mL). These effec-
tive antibiotics may be evaluated as candidates for further drug combina-
tion studies in animal models and potentially for clinical investigations.
The problem of persistent B. burgdorferi infection has been difficult
to study for several reasons, including difficulty culturing the persisting
organisms after antibiotic treatment; inability of the current antibiotics,
doxycycline and amoxicillin, to kill the persister organisms, as demon-
strated in various animal models; and a lack of antibiotics that are
effective against B. burgdorferi persisters. While concern remains whether
PTLDS is due to persisting organisms, identification of antibiotics that
have activity against B. burgdorferi persisters we feel should prompt
testing of some antibiotic combinations that could impact either per-
sisters if they exist or presence of antigenic debris, and by whatever
mechanisms, study whether such an approach may lead to improved
clinical outcomes in Lyme disease including Lyme arthritis or patients
with PTLDS.
In summary, this study represents the first high throughput screen
against B. burgdorferi in vitro persisters and identified a number of inter-
esting FDA-approved drugs that have excellent anti-persister activity.
Further studies are needed to evaluate these drug candidates in animal
models of B. burgdorferi persistence and determine whether they can
break the persistence phenomenon the current Lyme disease antibiotics
failed to eliminate. Although the question of B. burgdorferi persistence in
humans has been raised, there is no high-quality evidence to support this
concept or the idea that additional antibiotic therapy is helpful for
patients for PTLDS. Whether earlier resolution of B. burgdorferi infec-
tion, either alone or in combination with current Lyme disease anti-
biotics, will decrease long term symptoms of fatigue or PTLDS is
unknown and will require further study.
