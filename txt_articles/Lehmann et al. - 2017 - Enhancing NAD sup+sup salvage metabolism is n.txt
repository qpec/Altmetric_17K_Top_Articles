PINK1 model of Parkinson’s disease

ABSTRACT
Familial forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) caused by mutations
in
PINK1
are
linked
to
mitochondrial
impairment.
Defective
mitochondria are also found in Drosophila models of PD with pink1
mutations.
The
co-enzyme
nicotinamide
adenine
dinucleotide
(NAD+) is essential for both generating energy in mitochondria and
nuclear DNA repair through NAD+-consuming poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerases (PARPs). We found alterations in NAD+ salvage
metabolism in Drosophila pink1 mutants and showed that a diet
supplemented with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide rescued
mitochondrial defects and protected neurons from degeneration.
Additionally, a mutation of Parp improved mitochondrial function and
was neuroprotective in the pink1 mutants. We conclude that
enhancing the availability of NAD+ by either the use of a diet
supplemented with NAD+ precursors or the inhibition of NAD+-
dependent
enzymes,
such
as
PARPs,
which
compete
with
mitochondria
for
NAD+,
is
a
viable
approach
to
preventing
neurotoxicity associated with mitochondrial defects.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative
disorder characterised by the specific loss of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain. Most cases of PD
are sporadic, but 5–10% of cases are inherited through PD-related
genes (Bonifati, 2007; Gasser, 2009). Mitochondria have a crucial
role in supplying energy to the brain, and their deterioration has long
been associated with neurodegenerative states such as PD (reviewed
in de Castro et al., 2010). Mitochondrial health is maintained by
quality control (QC) mechanisms, such as the selective degradation
of defective organelles by mitophagy, a form of autophagy.
Mitophagy involves accumulation of the kinase PINK1 in the
outer mitochondrial membrane of defective mitochondria, where it
cooperates with the E3 ligase Parkin and FBXO7, an E3 ligase
adaptor, to promote their autophagic degradation (reviewed in
Celardo et al., 2014). Mutations in PINK1, PARKIN and FBXO7
have been identified in families with autosomal recessive early-
onset PD (Di Fonzo et al., 2009; Kitada et al., 1998; Valente et al.,
2004). This suggests that defects in mitophagy might have a
causative role in PD. Defects in mitophagy caused by mutations
in Pink1 lead to disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics and
alterations in the redox state of the complex I substrate nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) (Gandhi et al., 2009; Tufi et al.,
2014). NAD+ also acts as co-enzyme for poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerases
(PARPs),
which
are
major
NAD+-consuming
enzymes involved in nuclear DNA repair of healthy cells.
PARP over-activation has been associated with dopaminergic
neuron toxicity and atrophy (Kim et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013), as
well as disruption of the mitochondrial ultrastructure (Virág and
Szabó, 2002). In models of mitochondrial dysfunction associated
with the loss of Parkin or FBXO7 function, it has been recently
reported that decreasing the activity of PARPs, or increasing the
bioavailability of NAD+ through dietary supplementation, can
improve mitochondrial function and prevent neurodegeneration
(Delgado-Camprubi et al., 2016; Lehmann et al., 2016).
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful animal model
for studying the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD. It is also an
excellent
in
vivo
system
to
test
potentially
neuroprotective
compounds (reviewed in Lu and Vogel, 2009). Drosophila pink1
mutants
show
mitochondrial
dysfunction,
resulting
in
the
degeneration of muscle tissues, which causes a defective (crushed)
thorax phenotype (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). They also
show a selective, age-dependent loss of the protocerebral posterior
lateral 1 cluster of dopaminergic neurons (Park et al., 2006).
Here, we describe that pink1 mutant flies have decreased levels of
NAD+ metabolites. We demonstrated that a diet supplemented with
an NAD+ precursor vitamin, nicotinamide (NAM), and the genetic
suppression of Parp, a NAD+-consuming enzyme, improves
mitochondrial function and prevents neurodegeneration in pink1
mutant flies.
RESULTS
An NAD+-supplemented diet suppresses both mitochondrial
defects and neurodegeneration in pink1 mutant flies
NAD+ metabolism plays a crucial role in PD pathogenesis in a
number of PD-associated disease models that present with
mitochondrial defects (Delgado-Camprubi et al., 2016; Lehmann
et al., 2016). We have previously found low NAD+ levels in parkin
mutants (Lehmann et al., 2016), a downstream effector of pink1
(Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006). To determine whether the loss
of pink1 directly affects NAD+ metabolism, we analysed the levels
of NAD+ metabolites in pink1 mutants by global metabolic
profiling. We detected significant reductions in the level of
NAD+, as well as the NAD+ salvage metabolite nicotinamide
ribonucleotide (NMN) and NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside
(NR) (Fig. 1A). In the pink1 mutants, NAD+ levels were decreased,
we therefore assessed whether enhancing the NAD+ salvage
synthesis using NAM could prevent the mitochondrial defects in
these mutants. Degeneration of the indirect flight muscle in pink1
mutants is associated with the fragmentation of the mitochondrial

 cristae in these tissues (Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006; Tufi
et al., 2014). We also detected mitochondrial cristae fragmentation
in the neuropiles of the adult brains of pink1 mutants (Fig. 1B).
Maintenance of the pink1 mutants on a diet supplemented with
NAM
resulted
in
reduced
numbers
of
mitochondria
with
fragmented cristae (Fig. 1B,C). In addition, maintaining pink1
mutants in an NAM-supplemented diet also reduced the number of
flies with a defective thorax (Fig. 2A,B) and prevented the loss of
dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 2C-E). Together these results indicate
that dietary supplementation with the NAD+ precursor NAM
improves mitochondrial function and is neuroprotective in pink1
mutants.
Mutation of Parp rescues mitochondrial dysfunction of pink1
mutants
Depletion of cellular NAD+ levels has been linked to enhanced
oxidative stress, which causes activation of the NAD+-consuming
PARP enzymes (Virág et al., 1998). We have previously shown
that Drosophila parkin mutants have increased levels of the
oxidative stress markers methionine sulfoxide and homocysteine,
a marker of oxidative stress and a metabolite that generates
reactive oxygen species upon auto-oxidation, respectively (Lehmann
et al., 2016).
Metabolic profiling performed in this study revealed increased
levels of these same oxidative markers, as well as of methionine
(Fig. 3A), and increased protein PARylation (a post-translational
protein modification carried out by PARPs using NAD+ as a
substrate) in the pink1 mutants (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we assessed
whether the depletion of NAD+ observed in the pink1 mutants was
associated with the enhanced activity of PARP. To address this, we
examined whether a loss-of-function mutation in the Parp gene in
ParpCH1/+ flies (Ong et al., 2013; Tulin et al., 2002; Zhang and
Spradling, 1994) could reverse the mitochondrial impairment of
pink1 mutants. We demonstrated that the Parp gene mutation
attenuated the enhanced protein PARylation in the pink1 mutants
(Fig. 3B), indicating that this mutation decreased the overall PARP
activity. Next, we examined whether the Parp mutation could
improve the mitochondrial health of the pink1 mutants. We

 demonstrated that the Parp mutation suppressed the loss of Δψm
(Fig. 3C) and restored complex I-mediated respiration in the pink1
mutants (Fig. 3D). In addition, Parp mutation also reduced the
defects in mitochondrial morphology in the adult brains of the pink1
mutants (Fig. 3E,F). Taken together, these results indicate that
reduction in the activity of an NAD+-consuming enzyme, such as
Parp, results in improved mitochondrial function in pink1 mutants.
Parp mutation is neuroprotective in pink1 mutant flies
Next, we examined the effect of the Parp mutation on the
neurodegenerative phenotypes of the pink1 mutants by comparing
the phenotype of the pink1 flies to that of pink1, ParpCH1/+ double
mutants. We determined that the mutation of Parp was sufficient to
reduce the thoracic indentation (Fig. 4A) and to improve the
locomotive defects (Fig. 4B) of the pink1 mutants. Moreover,
Parp mutation increased the lifespan of the pink1 mutants (Fig. 4C).
In addition, it rescued the loss of the PPL1 clusters of dopaminergic
neurons in the pink1 mutants (Fig. 4D,E). Collectively, these results
indicate that the Parp gene mutation suppresses mitochondrial
dysfunction and is neuroprotective in pink1 mutants.
DISCUSSION
Disruption of mitochondrial function is a key hallmark of PD
(reviewed in Lehmann and Martins, 2013). Cells such as neurons
have several QC systems in place, which act at the molecular,
organellar and cellular levels to respond to mitochondrial defects
(reviewed in de Castro et al., 2010). Defects in Pink1 and its
downstream effectors, Parkin or Fbxo7, compromise mitophagy, a
mechanism of organellar QC. Loss-of-function mutations in any of
these three genes cause familial PD and result in the accumulation of
defective mitochondria, leading to cellular toxicity, partly through
the generation of toxic ROS. Pink1 is the key initiator of mitophagy,

 and its impairment affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and alters
the redox state of the complex I substrate NAD+. Here, we have
demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of NAM, a form of
vitamin B3, and of the genetic suppression of Parp, an NAD+-
consuming enzyme, in pink1 mutant flies. Other studies using fly
models have also shown that vitamin-based dietary interventions
suppress mitochondrial dysfunction and block neurodegeneration in
vivo (Lehmann et al., 2016; Tufi et al., 2014; Vos et al., 2012). In
addition, a high level of dietary niacin, another form of vitamin B3,
has also been reported to confer a reduced risk of developing PD
(Fall et al., 1999; Hellenbrand et al., 1996). Altogether, these studies
have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of a vitamin-enriched
diet in a genetic animal model of PD associated with mitochondrial
dysfunction. However, based on the available body of evidence, we
reason that although vitamin interventions might delay or prevent
neurodegeneration in diseases associated with mitochondrial
defects, such as PD, they cannot be considered potential ‘cures’
because they cannot reverse the loss of specific populations of
neurons that are absent at the time of diagnosis.
We observed the upregulation of markers of oxidative stress in
the pink1 mutants. Oxidative damage of DNA molecules activates
PARP enzymes and plays an important role in PD (Zuo and
Motherwell, 2013). The enhanced activation of PARPs in this
context can result in depletion of the cellular stores of metabolites
required for mitochondrial function, such as NAD+ and ATP, the
cellular energy currency, thereby decreasing the availability of these
metabolites for other essential cellular processes.
Studies of the human PARP-1 gene have identified several
polymorphisms linked to susceptibility to various diseases (Kato
et al., 2000; Pascual et al., 2003). For example, the active-site
polymorphism T2444C has been reported to decrease PARP-1
activity by approximately 40% (Wang et al., 2007). The data
presented here, along with those of two other recent reports
(Delgado-Camprubi et al., 2016; Lehmann et al., 2016), indicate
that the inhibition of PARPs could be a viable strategy to protect
neurons from the neurotoxic consequences of mutations in genes
encoding mitophagy components, such as PINK1, PARKIN and
FBXO7. Therefore, it would be interesting to examine whether PD
patients carrying mutations in these genes, as well as potential loss-
of-function polymorphisms in PARPs, display less severe disease
symptoms and have a higher life expectancy.
We conclude that a potential therapeutic approach aimed at
increasing the NAD+ level by using vitamin precursors or
inhibiting PARP activity could be useful for the treatment of
several mitochondrial dysfunction-associated forms of PD. As
PARP inhibitors are already in use in clinical studies of cancer and
in stroke treatment, this work expands the application of this
potential therapeutic agent to treatment of a disease that, thus far,
has no cure.

 Metabolic profiling
Global metabolic profiles were obtained from 3-day-old flies using the
Metabolon Platform (Metabolon Inc., NC, USA) as previously described
(Tufi et al., 2014). Essentially, each sample consisted of eight biological
replicates (100 flies per replicate). The sample preparation process was
carried out using an automated MicroLab STAR® system (Hamilton
Robotics, Reno, NV, USA). For sample extraction, an 80% (v/v) methanol:
water solution was used. Samples were then prepared for the appropriate
analysis (either LC/MS or GC/MS). Compounds above the detection
threshold were identified by comparison to library entries of purified
standards or recurrent unknown entities present in Metabolon’s proprietary
LIMS system. Identification of known chemical entities was based on
comparison to metabolomic library entries of purified standards.
Dietary supplements
NAM-supplemented diets were prepared as previously described (Lehmann
et al., 2016). Briefly, NAM was incorporated into the fly food at a final
concentration of 5 mM. Crosses were set up on normal food, and transferred
to NAM-containing food after two days. Larvae were treated with NAM
throughout development. Adult flies were maintained on NAM-containing
food throughout their lifespan, and they were transferred to vials with fresh
food every two to three days.
Microscopy-based assessment of mitochondrial function
Measurement of Δψm in brains of 3-day-old flies was performed using
tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM) as previously described (Tufi et al., 2014).
Briefly, fly brains were loaded with 40 nM TMRM in loading buffer (10 mM
HEPES, pH 7.35, 156 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM
KH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM glucose) for 40 min at room temperature,
and the dye was present during the experiment. In this experiment, TMRM
was used in the redistribution mode to assess Δψm, and therefore, a reduction
in TMRM fluorescence represents mitochondrial depolarisation. Confocal
images were obtained using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope equipped with a
40x oil immersion objective. Illumination intensity was kept to a minimum (at
0.1-0.2% of laser output) to avoid phototoxicity, and the pinhole was set to
give an optical slice of 2 µm. Fluorescence was quantified by exciting TMRM
using the 565 nm laser and measured above 580 nm. Z-stacks of 5 fields of
300 μm2 each per brain were acquired, and the mean maximal fluorescence
intensity was measured for each group.
Defective thorax analysis
Visual assessment of thoracic indentations (defective thorax) was performed
essentially as a binary assay, as previously described (Lehmann et al., 2016).
First, we determined whether each fly had a defective thorax, and second, we
used the chi-square test to determine whether the degree (percentage) of the
crushed thorax phenotypes in the populations under analysis is significantly
different.
Analysis of dopaminergic neurons
Brains from 20-day-old flies were dissected and stained using anti-tyrosine
hydroxylase (Immunostar, WI, USA) as previously described (Whitworth
et al., 2005). The brain samples were placed in PBS+0.1% Triton in a
coverslip clamp chamber (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc., NY, USA),
positioned using a harp-like apparatus made of platinum wire and nylon
string and imaged by confocal microscopy. Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive
PPL1 cluster neurons were counted per brain hemisphere. Data acquired for
the assessment of each genotype were obtained as a single experimental
dataset before statistical analysis.
Protein extraction and western blotting
Protein extracts from whole flies were prepared by grinding the flies in lysis
buffer [100 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM
EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml
antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin] as previously described
(Lehmann et al., 2016). The suspensions were cleared by centrifugation at
21,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants
were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). All supernatants were mixed
with 4× LDS loading buffer. For SDS-PAGE, equivalent amounts of proteins
were resolved on 4-12% NuPAGE Precast Gels (Invitrogen, MA, USA) and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, MA, USA) for
incubation with α-PAR or to PVDF membranes (Millipore, MA, USA) for
incubation with α-Tubulin. The membranes were blocked with TBS (0.15 M
NaCl and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) dried non-fat milk
for 1 h at room temperature and were then probed with the indicated primary
antibody, followed by incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody. Antibody complexes were visualised using Pierce’s
enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL). The levels of total PAR were
calculated asratiotothetotal protein load, which wasvisualisedbystainingthe
membrane with Ponceau S [0.1% Ponceau S (w/v), 5% acetic acid (w/v)], and
performing densitometry analysis with ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.
gov/ij/; provided in the public domain by the National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA).
Antibodies
The primary antibodies employed in this study included Tyrosine
Hydroxylase (1:50, Immunostar, WI, USA), PAR (1:500, Trevigen, MD,
USA, 4335-MC) and α-Tubulin (1:5000, Sigma, T6074).
Respirometry
Mitochondrial respiration in 3-day-old flies was assayed at 37°C by high-
resolution respirometry as previously described (Costa et al., 2013).
OROBOROS
Oxygraph
DatLab
software
package
(OROBOROS,
Innsbruck, Austria) was used for data acquisition (2-s time intervals) and
analysis, including calculation of the time derivative of the oxygen
concentration and signal deconvolution dependent on the response time of
the oxygen sensor, with correction for instrumental background oxygen
flux. Respiration was assessed by homogenising two flies using a pestle in
MiR05 respiration buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KH2PO4, 110 mM
sucrose, 20 mM taurine, 60 mM K-lactobionate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM
MgCl2, and 1g/l fatty acid-free BSA). Coupled state 3 respiration for
complex I was assayed in MiR05 respiration buffer in the presence of 2 mM
malate, 10 mM glutamate and 5 mM ADP.
Climbing assay
Climbing assays were performed as previously described (Greene et al.,
2003) using a counter-current apparatus equipped with six chambers. A total
of 15 to 20 male 3-day-old flies were placed into the first chamber, tapped to
the bottom, and then given 20 s to climb a distance of 10 cm. The flies that
successfully climbed 10 cm or beyond within 20 s were then shifted to a new
chamber, and both sets of flies were given another opportunity to climb the
10-cm distance. This procedure was repeated a total of five times. After five
trials, the number of flies in each chamber was counted. A video
demonstrating this technique can be found at https://youtu.be/vmR6s_
WAXgc. The climbing index was measured using a weighted average
approach with the following formula:
ð0 � n0Þ þ ð1 � n1Þ þ ð2 � n2Þ þ ð3 � n3Þ þ ð4 � n4Þ þ ð5 � n5Þ
5 � SUM(n0 : n5Þ
:
In this formula, n0 corresponds to the number of flies that failed the first
trial, and n1 through n5 are the numbers of flies that successfully passed
each successive trial. At least 100 flies were used for each genotype tested.
Lifespan analysis
Lifespan analysis was conducted as previously described (Lehmann et al.,
2016). Briefly, groups of 15 newly enclosed males of each genotype were
placed into separate vials with food and maintained at 25°C. The flies were
transferred to vials containing fresh food every two to three days, and the
number of dead flies was recorded. The data are presented as Kaplan–Meier
survival distributions, and significance was determined by the log-rank test.
Electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), adult fly brains were fixed
overnight in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2%

 paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% Tween-20. Then, the
samples were post-fixed for 1 h at room temperature in a solution containing
1% osmium tetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide. After fixation, the
samples were stained en bloc with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight at
room temperature; then, they were dehydrated via a series of ethanol washes
and embedded in TAAB epoxy resin (TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd.,
Aldermaston, UK). Semi-thin sections were stained with Toluidine Blue,
and areas of the sections were selected for ultramicrotomy. Ultrathin
sections were stained with lead citrate and imaged using a MegaView 3
digital camera and iTEM software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions
GmbH, Münster, Germany) with a Jeol 100-CXII electron microscope (Jeol
UK Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK). Data acquired in the assessments of
both the genetic and pharmacological rescue of the pink1 mutants were
obtained as a single experimental dataset before statistical analysis.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 6 (www.graphpad.com). The data are presented as the
mean value, and the error bar indicates±s.d. or ±s.e.m. (as indicated). The
number of biological replicates per experimental variable (n) is indicated in
either the respective figure or figure legend. Parametric tests were used
(performed using data obtained from pilot experiments) after confirming
that the variables under analysis displayed a Gaussian distribution using the
D’Agostino-Pearson test (computed using GraphPad Prism 6). Significance
is indicated as ****P<0.0001, ***P<0.001, **P<0.01, and *P<0.05. For
statistical analysis of metabolites in the flies, pairwise comparisons were
performed using Welch’s t-test. The q-value provides an estimate of the false
discovery rate (FDR), according to Storey and Tibshirani (2003). The
investigators gathering quantitative data on the biological samples were not
blinded to the sample identities at the time of analysis. No specific
randomisation strategies were employed when the biological replicates were
assigned to the treatment groups.
Digital image processing
Western blot images were acquired as uncompressed, bitmapped digital
images (TIFF format). The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop
CS5, employing established scientific imaging workflows (Wexler, 2008).
