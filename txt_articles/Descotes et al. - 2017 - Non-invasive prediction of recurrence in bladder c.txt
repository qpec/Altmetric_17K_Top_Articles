Background: Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is characterised by a high risk of recurrence. Patient monitoring is currently based
on iterative cystoscopy and on urine cytology with low sensitivity in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Telomerase
reverse transcriptase (TERT) is frequently reactivated in UBC by promoter mutations.
Methods: We studied whether detection of TERT mutation in urine could be a predictor of UBC recurrence and compared this to
cytology/cystoscopy for patient follow-up. A total of 348 patients treated by transurethral bladder resection for UBC were included
together with 167 control patients.
Results: Overall sensitivity was 80.5% and specificity 89.8%, and was not greatly impacted by inflammation or infection. TERT
remaining positive after initial surgery was associated with residual carcinoma in situ. TERT in urine was a reliable and dynamic
predictor of recurrence in NMIBC (Po0.0001). In univariate analysis, TERT positive-status after initial surgery increased risk of
recurrence by 5.34-fold (P ¼ 0.0004). TERT positive-status was still associated with recurrence in the subset of patients with
negative cystoscopy (P ¼ 0.034).
Conclusions: TERT mutations in urine might be helpful for early detection of recurrence in UBC, especially in NMIBC.
Diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting an urothelial
bladder cancer (UBC) is a major challenge for clinicians. Prognosis
for UBC is tightly correlated to stage and grade; the two main
entities depend on infiltration of the muscle layer and are non-
muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive
bladder cancer (MIBC). The association of urine cytology and
cystoscopy is the current gold standard to detect recurrence and
monitor UBC. The main advantage of urine cytology is that it is
non-invasive, cheap, and easy to perform. Its high specificity
(90–98%) makes cytology an interesting test to monitor high-grade
tumours, with sensitivity up to 90% in pTis (Grossman et al, 2007;
Geavlete et al, 2012). Unfortunately, overall sensitivity to detect
tumour cells ranges from 22 to 62% (Koss et al, 1985; Piaton et al,
2004; Bassi et al, 2005) making it unsuitable for low-grade lesions
(Fontaniere et al, 2001). Although the current gold standard is
cystoscopy and cytology, it is subjective and may vary with the
experience of the observers (Miremami and Kyprianou, 2014). This
is particularly a problem in some conditions (elderly patients or

 those with neurogenic bladder with a chronic urinary infection,
inflammatory bladder etc.). Therefore objective biological markers
are required. To date, several urinary biomarkers have been
described, some of them being more sensitive than urine cytology.
However, they are lacking specificity, especially in the conditions
cited above (Raitanen et al, 2001; Raitanen and FinnBladder
Group, 2008; Rosser et al, 2014; Chou et al, 2015).
TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) is an essential safe-
guard of genomic integrity, responsible for telomere maintenance.
In aging or damaged cells, TERT activity is physiologically shut
down leading to shortened telomeres and induction of a form of
cell death called senescence. Escaping senescence is a hallmark of
cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) and nearly all tumours
develop genetic or epigenetic strategies to avoid elimination by
increasing TERT activity (Schmidt and Cech, 2015). Two recurrent
somatic mutations (C228T and C250T) have been identified in the
TERT promoter in melanoma (Horn et al, 2013; Huang et al, 2013)
as well as in various other tumours including bladder cancers
(Killela et al, 2013; Wu et al, 2014). TERT promoter mutations
have previously been described at high frequencies across stages in
malignant bladder tumours, but the prognostic value in urine is
unclear (Allory et al, 2014; Ward et al, 2016).
In this context, we evaluated, in a large prospective cohort, the
use of non-invasive detection of TERT promoter mutations in
urine as a predictive marker of recurrences and compared this to
cytology and cystoscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. Eighty-three patients from the Urology department of
Lyon Sud university hospital (Lyon, France) presenting UBC
irrespective of histological stage, were initially enrolled in a
previous study (PHRC2006 - no. 27–46) between 2000 and 2008
(Descotes et al, 2014). The cohort was then prospectively increased
up to 348 patients in 2014 (Table 1). Informed consent was
obtained from patients to use their specimens for research
purposes, as required by the French Committee for the Protection
of Human Subjects. This study complies with the latest version of
the Declaration of Helsinki and general guidelines for good clinical
practice. Treatments (intravesical BCG or mitomycin) and follow-
up were based on European Association of Urology (EAU)
guidelines. For each patient an initial urine sample was obtained
at the time of tumour resection by cystoscopy (transurethral
bladder resection, (TUBR)). Subsequent urine samples were
collected during follow-up consultations. No extra samples of
urines were collected for this study, because analyses were
performed on residual materials obtained for cytology. During
follow-up
some
patients
presented
a
recurrence
based
on
cystoscopy. For 50 of them, recurrence was not confirmed by
pathologists on surgical material obtained by TUBR. We further
referred to these cases as ‘non-tumour’ pathology post-TUBR.
To assess specificity, 167 patients without UBC were also
included as controls (Table 2): 89 from healthy individuals or from
patients consulting for low urinary tract symptoms or urinary
incontinence
(excluding
patients
reporting
macroscopic
and
microscopic haematuria), 17 neurogenic bladder, 10 infectious
urines, and 42 patients diagnosed with any other type of cancer
(prostate, kidney, intestine, etc.). Of note, patients presenting with
macroscopic and microscopic haematuria were excluded from this
control cohort because it might be linked to an undiagnosed UBC.
Cytology. Urine samples were fixed with a Carbowax solution of
20% polyethylene glycol 1500 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in
50%
ethanol
and
treated
as
previously
described
(Collin-
Chavagnac et al, 2010). Urothelial cells were considered high-
grade when they displayed an increased nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C)
ratio, hyperchromatism, and markedly irregular nuclear borders or
prominent nucleoli, and low-grade when they formed papillary
fronds, had an increased N/C ratio, and a slightly irregular nuclear
shape, or showed numerous elongated cells with slight nuclear
abnormalities, as previously described (Layfield et al, 2004). We
categorised cytological results as positive or negative for high-grade
urothelial tumour cells. Urine classified as high-grade or AUC-H
were considered positive (Piaton et al, 2014), whereas normal,
inflammatory, reactive, and degenerative urothelial findings were
considered negative.
Histopathology. Tumour
stage
and
histological
grade
were
assessed according to the International Union Against Cancer–
tumour, node, metastases system and the 2004 World Health
Organization classification (Sauter, 2004). Histopathology served
as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis.
Molecular testing. A 25-ml sample of fresh urine was centrifuged
at 800 g for 10 min and the cell pellet (urine sediment) was rinsed

urine sediment using Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit QIAamp
according

(Qiagen,

then sequenced according to the Sanger method.
Statistical
analysis. Quantitative
variables
were
compared
between groups using Mann-Whitney test and categorical variables
using the w2-test or Fisher’s exact test. Survival analyses were
performed in the population of patients with positive TERT
mutation at the time of TUBR. Analysis was restricted to
superficial UBC stages, excluding pTis stage. Absence of recurrence
was defined as no event with a minimum follow-up of 6 months.
Median follow-up was 11.3 months (range: (1.3–117)). The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate recurrence-free
survival (RFS), and curves were compared using the Log-rank
test. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using
Cox proportional hazard model with 95% confidence intervals
(CI). All tests were set at the significance level of Po0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics
software (release 19).
RESULTS
Recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations in urine from
UBC patients. Urine from 348 patients was collected at the time
of initial TURB and tested for TERT promoter mutations. This
cohort included 275 NMIBC (pTa or pT1), 61 MIBC (4pT1), and
12 carcinoma in situ (CIS). The overall TERT mutation rate was
80.5% (280 out of 348). TERT positivity in urine was stage-
independent; sensitivity was 79.4 in pTa and 77.6% in pT1
NMIBC, increasing to 85.2 in MIBC (4pT1) and 91.7% in pTis.
There was a higher frequency of TERT mutations among high-
grade tumours than among low-grade ones (P ¼ 0.0193); sensitivity
in low-grade lesions was 74.3% (Table 1). Among TERT promoter
hotspot mutations, C228T was the most prevalent (235 out of 280,
83.9%), followed by C250T (35 out of 280). There were also rarer
substitutions in some patients (C228A and CC242TT), and in two
patients concomitant mutations of both C228T and C250T.
Comparison of TERT mutations to cytology for the detection of
UBC. TERT positivity was not significantly correlated with urine
cytology classification (Table 1). Regardless of tumour stage,
sensitivity of TERT mutations (280 out of 348, 80.5%) was
significantly higher than urine cytology (117 out of 348, 33.6%)
(w2-test Po0.0001). The overall sensitivity to detect UBC was for
stratification of NMIBC in three groups (low-grade pTa, high-
grade pTa/pTis and pT1) showed a sensitivity of cytology of 5.5%,
43.3%, and 50%, respectively whereas sensitivity of TERT remained
high whatever the group (74.3%, 92.5%, and 77.6%, respectively;
Figure 1). Of note, sensitivity of TERT in MIBC (4pT1) was not
significantly different from cytology (P ¼ 0.0515).
Specificity of TERT mutation detection in urine. To assess the
specificity of this test we included 167 ‘non-UBC’ patients
including 125 with benign bladder lesion or healthy individuals,
and 42 with other cancers (Table 2). Specificity was 92.0% (115 out
of 125) in those with benign bladder lesion or healthy individuals,
and 83.3% in cancer patients (35 out of 42). Among those with
infectious or inflammatory urines (neurogenic bladder), only one
presented a TERT mutation (specificity 96.3%, 26 out of 27). As
prostate cancer could have been associated with TERT mutation,
we also studied a group of patients with prostate cancer and
without known UBC. In this group, specificity of TERT mutations
was 87.9% (29 out of 33).
Detection of residual CIS after TUBR. Analysis of follow-up
urines from the 348 patients found that in some cases TERT
remained positive after TUBR whereas histopathology on the
surgical specimen was negative for UBC, which could point to the
presence of residual CIS. To test this hypothesis we analysed the
association between TERT status and presence of pTis lesions
detected during follow-up in patients with ‘non-tumour’ pathology
post-TUBR (n ¼ 50; Table 3). Among the 13 patients with
recurrence of a confirmed CIS within 6 months after initial TUBR,
10 (76.9%) had follow-up urine (1 month post-surgery) that
remained positive for TERT mutation, whereas among the 35 who
did not have recurrence, 35.1% remained positive. TERT mutation
was significantly associated with 6-month recurrence of pTis
(P ¼ 0.0214).
Prediction of recurrence in NMIBC by TERT in urine. Patients
presenting with NMIBC are known to be at risk of recurrence with
more invasive tumours. We therefore evaluated whether TERT in
urine could detect such recurrence, by analysing the association of
TERT status with RFS in 100 patients with a minimum follow-up
of 6 months and initially presenting a NMIBC without pTis
(because it is known to increase risk of recurrence). Presence of
TERT promoter mutation in urine was strongly associated with
recurrence in these NMIBC patients (Figure 2A, Po0.0001).
Results of univariate RFS analysis showed that TERT mutation was
associated with a risk of recurrence that increased 5.34-fold in the
NMIBC subset (95% CI 2.11–13.55; P ¼ 0.0004). This association

 did not persist in multivariate analysis when associated with
cystoscopy in the Cox regression model (HR 1.72, 95% CI 0.61–
4.81 P ¼ 0.3015). However when patients were stratified on
cystoscopy status, TERT mutation positivity was still significantly
associated with recurrence (Figure 2C, P ¼ 0.034) in the negative
cystoscopy subset (46 out of 100 patients), despite only a few
numbers of events (5 out of 6 were TERT mutated). TERT
mutation did not provide additional information in terms of RFS
in the positive cystoscopy subset (n ¼ 54; Figure 2B, P ¼ 0.9728).
Dynamic follow-up of NMIBC patients using TERT. We also
observed that presence of TERT mutations in urine was a dynamic
marker of recurrence. A frequent scenario is exemplified by the
case presented in Figure 3. This patient was initially treated by
TUBR for a NMIBC classified as low-grade pTa. He presented a
C250T mutation that became negative in the follow-up urines.
Seven years later, TERT became positive again, associated with
cystoscopic signs of recurrence. A tumour classified as high-grade
pTa was resected. Since this second surgery (three years follow-up)
urines have remained negative for TERT mutation and the patient
has not experienced recurrence. Of note, urine cytology remained
negative throughout progression of the disease, including initial
tumour and recurrence.
DISCUSSION
Results of this large cohort study demonstrate that detecting TERT
promoter mutations in urine is a non-invasive and sensitive way to
detect UBC lesions, even of low-grade, where cytology is not
sensitive enough. TERT may help to detect recurrence earlier and
to better adapt follow-up frequency and treatment. We further
showed that TERT remained positive after TUBR was significantly
associated with residual CIS, which is difficult to detect by standard
cystoscopy. This could explain why TERT remained a predictor of
recurrence even in the negative cystoscopy group. Therefore TERT
testing could help to better identify the group of patients for whom
to consider hexaminolevulinate fluorescence cystoscopy.
However, around 20% of patients did not show positive TERT
in urine after initial TUBR and remained negative during follow-
up. Because TERT is known to be reactivated by mechanisms other
than mutations of its promoter, it may be of interest to study TERT
expression and activity in these non-mutated patients (Hurst et al,
2014). Importantly we also found that detection of TERT mutation
remained highly specific in inflammatory or infectious urines
where previously described urinary biomarkers are known to give
false-positive results (Raitanen et al, 2001; Chou et al, 2015). This is
an important issue since this type of urine is frequent in non-UBC
patients.
Furthermore,
TERT
could
also
help
clinicians
to
distinguish
recurrence
from
inflammatory
scar
in
case
of
suspicious cystoscopy.
The study does have some limitations. The main one being the
single-centre design that could introduce some positive bias in
analysing the performance of this marker.
A prospective study, investigating combination of TERT with
FGFR3 and OTX1 as diagnostic urinary markers during follow-up
of patients with primary NMIBC, recently confirmed the interest of
this panel in patients with negative cystoscopy (Beukers et al,
2017). It would be important to define the negative predictive value
of TERT mutation as a single marker in case of suspicious
cystoscopy (inflammatory lesions, scar post BCG therapy, etc.),
and its positive predictive value in case of negative cystoscopy and
cytology.
CONCLUSIONS
Detection of TERT promoter mutations in urine is a reliable non-
invasive prognostic marker for recurrence in UBC, especially in
NMIBC where cytology does have some limitations.
