Key points
r A classic unresolved issue in human integrative physiology involves the role of exercise intensity,
duration and volume in regulating skeletal muscle adaptations to training.
r We employed counterweighted single-leg cycling as a unique within-subject model to
investigate the role of exercise intensity in promoting training-induced increases in skeletal
muscle mitochondrial content.
r Six sessions of high-intensity interval training performed over 2 weeks elicited greater
increases in citrate synthase maximal activity and mitochondrial respiration compared to
moderate-intensity continuous training matched for total work and session duration.
r These data suggest that exercise intensity, and/or the pattern of contraction, is an important
determinant of exercise-induced skeletal muscle remodelling in humans.
Abstract We employed counterweighted single-leg cycling as a unique model to investigate the
role of exercise intensity in human skeletal muscle remodelling. Ten young active men performed
unilateral graded-exercise tests to measure single-leg ˙
VO2,peak and peak power (Wpeak). Each
leg was randomly assigned to complete six sessions of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
[4 × (5 min at 65% Wpeak and 2.5 min at 20% Wpeak)] or moderate-intensity continuous
training (MICT) (30 min at 50% Wpeak), which were performed 10 min apart on each day, in an
alternating order. The work performed per session was matched for MICT (143 ± 8.4 kJ) and
HIIT (144 ± 8.5 kJ, P > 0.05). Post-training, citrate synthase (CS) maximal activity (10.2 ± 0.8 vs.
8.4 ± 0.9 mmol kg protein−1 min−1) and mass-specific [pmol O2•(s•mg wet weight)−1] oxidative
phosphorylation capacities (complex I: 23.4 ± 3.2 vs. 17.1 ± 2.8; complexes I and II: 58.2 ± 7.5 vs.
42.2 ± 5.3) were greater in HIIT relative to MICT (interaction effects, P < 0.05); however,
mitochondrial function [i.e. pmol O2•(s•CS maximal activity)−1] measured under various
conditions was unaffected by training (P > 0.05). In whole muscle, the protein content of
COXIV (24%), NDUFA9 (11%) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) (16%) increased similarly across groups
(training effects, P < 0.05). Cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) and NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase subunit A9 (NDUFA9) were more abundant in type I than type II fibres
(P < 0.05) but training did not increase the content of COXIV, NDUFA9 or MFN2 in either

fibre type (P > 0.05). Single-leg ˙
VO2,peak was also unaffected by training (P > 0.05). In summary,
single-leg cycling performed in an interval compared to a continuous manner elicited superior
mitochondrial adaptations in human skeletal muscle despite equal total work.

Introduction
Skeletal muscle mitochondrial content impacts fuel use
and endurance capacity (Holloszy and Coyle, 1984), as
well as aspects of metabolic health and ageing (Joseph
et al. 2012; Goodpaster, 2013). Mitochondrial content
increases after aerobic-based exercise training (Holloszy,
1967; Morgan et al. 1971) and is markedly greater
in the skeletal muscle of endurance-trained compared
to untrained individuals (Hoppeler et al. 1973; Jacobs
and Lundby, 2013). Short-term training programmes,
involving moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise and
performed in a continuous or intermittent manner,
rapidly increase mitochondrial content in untrained
humans (Saltin et al. 1976; MacDougall et al. 1998;
Talanian et al. 2006; Burgomaster et al. 2008). Relatively
few studies have compared work-matched programmes
that differ in exercise intensity, and the precise role of
exercise intensity in mediating mitochondrial adaptations
to training in humans is equivocal (Bishop et al. 2014).
Exercise intensity mediates many acute responses to
aerobic exercise, with higher intensities typically inducing
greaterneuromuscularfatigue(TheurelandLepers,2008),
greater type II muscle fibre recruitment (Kristensen
et al. 2015) and augmenting the activation of molecular
pathways linked to mitochondrial biogenesis (Egan et al.
2010; Di Donato et al. 2014; Kristensen et al. 2015).
Skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise training may
therefore be linked to relative work intensity, although
surprisingly few data are available to directly address this
hypothesis. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and
sprint interval training (SIT) elicit adaptations similar to
moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) despite
lower total work (Gibala et al. 2006; Burgomaster
et al. 2008); however, the few studies that have
compared MICT, HIIT and/or SIT protocols matched
for total work have yielded inconsistent findings, with
higher exercise intensities eliciting greater adaptations
in some comparisons (Daussin et al. 2008a; Granata
et al. 2016) but not others (Henriksson and Reitman,
1976; Saltin et al. 1976; Granata et al. 2016). Most
training studies have exclusively examined adaptations in
whole muscle; however, training-induced mitochondrial
adaptationsmightoccurinafibretype-dependentmanner
(Henriksson and Reitman, 1976). For example, relative
to continuous exercise, the greater AMP-kinase activity
induced by a single bout of interval exercise was also fibre
type-dependent (Kristensen et al. 2015) and, in response
to 6 weeks of MICT, type II fibres demonstrated greater
increases in mitochondrial volume than type I fibres
(Howald et al. 1985). Furthermore, most of the previous
studies have progressively increased the duration and/or
intensity of the exercise training, complicating any inter-
pretation of the results. Accordingly, an examination of the
short-term effect of aerobic exercise intensity on human
skeletal muscle mitochondrial content is warranted.
Single-leg cycling permits the comparison of training
adaptations to two different exercise training protocols
within the same subject, controlling for individual
variability in training responsiveness and increasing
statistical power. The addition of a counterweight to the
contralateral pedal assists with the upstroke phase of
the revolution, making the perceptual ‘feel’ of counter-
weighted single-leg cycling similar to double-legged
cycling (Burns et al. 2014; Bini et al. 2015). There is
no evidence to suggest that mitochondrial adaptations
to single-leg cycling transfer to the non-exercising leg,
meaning that the contralateral limb can be trained in
a different manner or serve as a non-exercise control
(Saltin et al. 1976; Henriksson, 1977). Furthermore, the
adaptations induced by single-leg cycling are potentially
greater than those induced by double-legged cycling, as a
result of increased relative workloads (Abbiss et al. 2011).
The present study aimed to compare mitochondrial
adaptations in human skeletal muscle following six
sessions of HIIT or MICT, matched for total work and
session duration. The legs of subjects were randomly
assigned to one of the two training interventions and
exercised separately but consecutively on six training
sessions over a 2 week period. Resting skeletal muscle

needle biopsies were collected from each leg before and
aftertrainingtomeasuremitochondrialcontent.Wehypo-
thesized that HIIT would elicit greater mitochondrial
adaptations than MICT as a result of the cumulative effect
of greater metabolic stress induced over the course of the
training sessions.
Methods
Participants and ethical approval
Ten healthy young men were recruited for the study
(age 23 ± 1 years; body mass index 25 ± 1 kg m–2).
All subjects were habitually active but not specifically
training for any sport. The subjects completed a Physical
Activity Readiness Questionnaire and provided their
written informed consent prior to their participation. The
Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved the
protocol, and the study conformed with the Declaration of
Helsinki (2013).
Pre-training procedures
Subjects initially performed a standard (double-legged)
ramp test to exhaustion on an electronically-braked
cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport, version 2.0; Lode,
Groningen, The Netherlands) to determine whole-body
peak oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2,peak) and peak power output
(Wpeak). Following a 1 min warm-up at 50 W, workload
was increased 1 W every 2 s until the subject reached
volitional exhaustion or cadence decreased below 60 rpm.
Expired gases were analysed using an online gas collection
system (Moxus modular oxygen uptake system; AEI
Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and the ˙
VO2,peak was
determined from the greatest 30 s average of ˙
VO2,peak. The
˙
VO2,peak and Wpeak of subjects were 46 ± 2 mL kg−1 min−1
and 302 ± 14 W, respectively.
At least 48 h following the double-legged ramp test, sub-
jects were familiarized with a single-leg cycling technique
modelled after previous work (Abbiss et al. 2011; Burns
et al. 2014). Briefly, one crank on an electronically-braked
cycle ergometer (Velotron; RacerMate, Seattle, WA, USA)
was fitted with a custom-machined pedal that held
an 11.4 kg counterweight. Subjects pedalled using one
leg, with the non-exercising leg resting on a stationary
platform. The counterweight assisted with the upstroke
phase of the revolution, eliminating the need to pull up
on the pedal. Using this set-up, subjects performed an
incrementalexercisetesttovolitionalexhaustionwitheach
leg. The single-leg tests were similar to the double-legged
tests, except the rate at which the workload increased was
reduced by half (i.e. 1 W every 4 s). The left leg was tested
10 min after the right leg, given previous data showing that
fatigue does not transfer to the non-exercising leg (Elmer
et al. 2012). The ˙
VO2,peak (2.5 ± 0.2 vs. 2.6 ± 0.2 l min−1,
P = 0.26) and power output (151 ± 9 W vs. 155 ± 9 W,
P = 0.28) were similar for the left and right legs.
Pre-training, single-leg ˙
VO2,peak (average of both legs) was
73 ± 1.0 % of the double-legged value. On a separate
day, each leg completed a brief familiarization session that
involved half of the total work to be performed during the
main training sessions. The goal of familiarization was to
determine whether the prescribed workload was tolerable
(see Training Intervention).
At least 3 days after the final baseline testing session,
resting muscle needle biopsies were collected from the
vastus lateralis of the left and right legs of each subject.
Subjects refrained from exercise, alcohol and food for
a minimum of 48, 24 and 10 h, respectively, and sub-
jects recorded a 24 h diet log before the first biopsy to
repeat this diet for the post-training biopsy. Samples were
collected under local anaesthesia (1% xylocaine) using a
Bergstr¨
om needle modified for suction, as described pre-
viously (Tarnopolsky et al. 2011). Muscle biopsies were
immediately sectioned, with one piece placed in ice-cold
buffer for the measurement of mitochondrial respiration
and the remaining pieces frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at –80°C until analysis.
Training intervention
All training was performed on the same cycle ergometer
adapted for single-leg cycling as that used for baseline
testing. Using an allocation concealment procedure, each
leg was randomly assigned to complete six sessions of
work- and duration-matched HIIT or MICT over 2 weeks
(essentially every second day). Training began 3–4 days
after the muscle biopsy procedures.
Exercise prescriptions were based on the average Wpeak
obtained during the two single-leg tests. Legs in the
HIIT group performed four 5 min bouts of cycling at
65% average Wpeak, each followed by a 2.5 min recovery
period at 20% of average Wpeak. Legs in the MICT group
performed 30 min of cycling at 50% Wpeak to match the
total work [total work (kJ) = average power (W) × time
(s)/1000] of the HIIT group. For two subjects who could
not complete the prescribed HIIT protocol, the loads were
reduced to 60% and 15% of average Wpeak for HIIT and
45% of average Wpeak for MICT. All training sessions
were preceded by a 5 min warm-up at 25 W. Subjects
were instructed to cycle at the same cadence (�80 rpm)
throughout each session. The legs of each subject were
trained consecutively on the same day, following a 10 min
rest period, with the order alternating each day. Training
intensities were held constant for the entire study.
To determine acute responses to each protocol, heart
rate was measured continuously (Polar Electro, Kempele,
Finland) and ratings of perceived exertion and dyspnoea
were measured periodically (Borg Category-Ratio Scale,
0–10). Heart rate data were averaged for the entire
session and for each of the 5 min intervals (or the

corresponding period of the MICT protocol), whereas
subjective ratings of exertion and dyspnoea were recorded
followingeachinterval(orthecorrespondingperiodofthe
MICT protocol). Blood lactate was measured via finger
prick during the final 2 min of the first session of each
training programme only (Lactate Plus; Nova Biomedical,
Mississauga, ON, Canada).
Post-training procedures
A resting muscle needle biopsy was obtained from each
leg 72 h after the final training session to avoid potential
acute effects of exercise (Leek et al. 2001). The single-leg
incremental tests to exhaustion were repeated 72 h later,
as described above.
Muscle analysis
Citrate synthase (CS) maximal activity. One piece of
muscle was homogenized for the determination of CS
maximal activity. Briefly, �25 mg of muscle was homo-
genized in 20 volumes of buffer (70 mM sucrose, 220 mM
mannitol, 10 mM Hepes and 1 mM EGTA, supplemented
with protease inhibitors; Complete Mini R
�; Roche Applied
Science, Laval, PQ, Canada) using Lysing Matrix D tubes
(MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and the FastPrep-24
Tissue and Cell Homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). Enzyme
activity was determined by measuring the formation of
the thionitrobenzoate anion at a wavelength of 412 nm
using a spectrophotometer (Cary Bio-300; Varion, Inc.,
Palo Alto, CA, USA), as previously described (Carter et al.
2001). CS maximal activity was expressed relative to total
protein measured with a BCA Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA).
Mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized muscle fibres.
Mitochondrial respiration was simultaneously measured
in permeabilized muscle from the left and right legs of
subjects using the two chambers of an Oxygraph-2K
respirometer
(Oroboros,
Innsbruck,
Austria).
The
protocol is based on the general protocol described by
Pesta and Gnaiger (2011). After being sectioned from the
biopsy sample, �10 mg of muscle tissue was immediately
placed in ice-cold biopsy preservation solution (BIOPS)
(10 mM Ca-EGTA buffer, 0.1 μM free calcium, 20 mM
imidazole, 20 mM taurine, 50 mM K-MES, 0.5 mM
DTT, 6.56 mM MgCl2, 5.77 mM ATP and 15 mM
phosphocreatine, pH 7.1). Within 1 h of the biopsy
procedure, bundles of muscle fibres were suspended in
an aliquot of BIOPS and mechanically separated under
a microscope using jeweler’s forceps. Samples were then
transferred to BIOPS containing saponin (50 μg ml−1)
and incubated on a rocker at 4°C for 30 min to
permeabilize muscle fibres. Samples were then transferred
to ice-cold mitochondrial respiration medium (MiR05;
0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2•6H20, 60 mM K-lactobionate,
20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM Hepes, 110 mM
sucrose and 1 g l−1 bovine serum albumin, pH 7.1) and
washed on arocker at4°Cfor 15min.Finally,samples were
blotted dry with filter paper, and a piece of muscle, with a
wet weight of between 1.5 and 2 mg (1.8 ± 0.2 mg), was
addedtothechamberoftherespirometer,whichcontained
2mlofMiR05with blebbistatintoinhibitcontractions.All
measurements were performed at 37°C and at an oxygen
concentration between 100 and 200 nmol ml−1.
A substrate uncoupler inhibitor titration protocol
was used to examine mitochondrial respiration in
permeabilized fibres. First, malate (2 mM) and glutamate
(10 mM) were added consecutively in the absence of
ADP to measure leak respiration. ADP (5 mM) was
added to measure oxidative phosphorylation (oxidative
phosphorylation capacity; P) through complex I (PCI)
followed by succinate (10 mM) to measure oxidative
phosphorylationthroughcomplexesIandII(PCI&CII).The
electron transfer system capacity (E) was assessed through
the serial addition of 1 μl aliquots (in steps of 0.5 μM) of
the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)
phenyl-hydrazone. The addition of rotenone (0.5 μM), an
inhibitor of complex I, allowed for the measurement of
ECII. Cytochrome c (10 μM) was then added to ensure the
functional integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane
and, finally, anti-mycin A (2.5 μM), which is an inhibitor
of complex III, was added to measure the residual oxygen
consumption that remains when electron flow through
complexes I, II, and III is inhibited.
For analysis of mitochondrial respiration, oxygen flux
(JO2) was calculated from the derivative of the oxygen
concentration of the chamber, using DatLab 4.1.08
(Oroboros) and expressed as mass-specific JO2 (pmol
O2•[s•mgwetweight]−1).Allvalueswerecorrectedbysub-

training can increase JO2 independent of mitochondrial
content, JO2 was normalized to CS activity (pmol
O2•[s•CS]−1) to yield mitochondria-specific JO2 (Jacobs
and Lundby, 2013; Jacobs et al. 2013). Data are reported
for PCI, PCI&CII and E.
Whole muscle western blotting. Frozen pieces of whole
muscle (12 ± 5.0 mg) were cut into 10 μm sections
at –20°C, placed in loading buffer, vortexed, incubated
at room temperature for 1 h and frozen at –80°C until
analysis. All samples were run on 4–15% Criterion TGX
Stain-Free protein gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) at
200 V for 45 min. A protein ladder (Fermentas PageRuler
Prestained Ladder, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) and a calibration curve (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16 μl)
(Fig. 1) of pooled whole muscle homogenates were run
on every gel. The total protein loaded was visualized using
ultraviolet (UV) activation of the gel and analysed with

Image Lab 5.2.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins
were then wet-transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 V for
30 min in circulating 4°C transfer buffer (25 mM Tris,
192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS and 20% methanol, pH 8.3).
Proper transfer was visualized with UV activation of
the gel and membrane post-transfer (StainFree Imager;
Bio-Rad). Membranes were treated with Miser solution
(Pierce) and placed in blocking buffer (5% skim milk
in Tris-buffered saline-Tween; TBST) for 2 h at room
temperature.AfterrinsinginTBST,sectionsofmembranes
were placed in solutions of primary antibodies (see below)
and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature and
overnight at 4°C on rockers. After washing in blocking
buffer, membranes were incubated in goat anti-mouse IgG
HRP secondary antibody (PIE31430; dilution 1:20 000
in blocking buffer; ThermoFisher Scientific) or goat
anti-rabbit IgG HRP (PIE31460; dilution 1:60 000 in
blocking buffer; ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 h at room
temperature. Following a final wash in TBST, membranes
were exposed to Supersignal West Femto (Pierce), imaged
(ChemiDoc MP; Bio-Rad) and analysed (ImageLab,
version 5.2.1; Bio-Rad). When required, membranes were
washed in TBST for 1 h (but were not stripped) before
being re-probed with another primary antibody. The
abundance of proteins of interest were normalized to total
protein for analysis, using the calibration curve from each
gel (Mollica et al. 2009).
All primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA
in PBS with 0.025% Tween (PBST). The proteins
of interest were cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV
(COXIV) (rabbit polyclonal IgG; dilution 1:1000; 4844,
lot no. 0003; Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9
(NDUFA9; rabbit polyclonal IgG; dilution 1:1000; as
described previously; Stroud et al. 2013) and mitofusin
2 (MFN2; rabbit polyclonal IgG; dilution 1:500; verified
with MFN2-knockout tissue in our laboratory). Professor
Michael Ryan (Monash University, Australia) kindly
provided the latter two antibodies. Representative blots
are shown in Fig. 1.
Single-fibre collection and western blotting. Muscle
samples (21 ± 6.5 mg) were freeze-dried for 48 h to
permit the collection of segments of individual muscle
fibres, as described by Murphy (2011). Briefly, freeze-dried
pieces of muscle (4.2 ± 1.5 mg) were brought to room
temperature and segments of individual fibres were
removed using jeweller’s forceps under a microscope.
Each segment was added to a tube containing 10 μl of
loading buffer, vortexed, incubated at room temperature
for 1 h, and frozen at –80°C until analysis. Between
24 and 78 (31 ± 12) fibres were collected from each
sample.
Dot blotting was performed to determine the fibre
type of each muscle fibre segment. Briefly, polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane was activated with 95% ethanol
and equilibrated in transfer buffer, and then 1 μl
of each sample was applied to the wet membrane
and allowed to dry. The dry membrane was then
reactivated with 95% ethanol, equilibrated in transfer
buffer, washed in TBST for 5 min, and then placed
in blocking buffer for 5 min. The presence of myosin
heavy chain type II a (MHCIIa; mouse monoclonal IgG,
clone A4.74, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank
[DSHB]; dilution 1:200 in 1% BSA/PBST) protein was
determined using a western blotting procedure similar to
that described above (beginning after the Miser solution
step). After analysis, MHCIIa antibodies were removed
from the membrane with stripping buffer (Pierce) prior
to incubation in antibodies for myosin heavy chain
type I (MHCI; mouse monoclonal IgM, clone A4.840,
DSHBl dilution 1:200 in 1%BSA/PBST). For each sample,
unambiguous type I (7.0 ± 2.9) and type II (9.0 ± 5.2)
muscle fibre segments were pooled prior to electro-
phoresis, which followed the same protocol as that
used for whole muscle samples. The presence/absence

COXIV, MFN2 and NDUFA9 were determined for each
pooledsamplefollowingtheprotocolalreadydescribedfor
whole muscle samples. Representative blots are shown in
Fig. 1.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SE unless otherwise
stated. CS maximal activity, JO2, whole muscle protein
content, pooled type I and type II muscle fibre content,
˙
VO2,peak and Wpeak were measured using a two-way,
within-subject ANOVA, with group (HIIT and MICT)
and time (pre- and post-training) as the two factors.
To examine the possibility of fibre-type differences in
protein content (Albers et al. 2015; Christensen et al.
2015), pre-training pooled type I and type II muscle fibres,
averaged across HIIT and MICT, were compared with
paired t tests. Variables measured during each training
session (heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion
and dyspnoea) were averaged across the six sessions
and analysed using a two-way, within-subject ANOVA,
with group and bout (1, 2, 3, 4) as the within-subject
factors. Other data (blood lactate concentrations, cadence,
total work) were compared across groups with paired
Student’s t tests. Post hoc testing (Holm–Sidak test) was
performed only when statistically significant interactions
were detected with ANOVA. P � 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All data analyses were performed
with Prism, version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA).
Results
Exercise data and cardiorespiratory response
to training
Mean power was 98 ± 6 and 31 ± 2 W, respectively, during
the work and recovery periods in HIIT, and 75 ± 5 W
during MICT. The total work performed each session,
including warm up, was similar in HIIT and MICT
(143 ± 8.4 vs. 144 ± 8.5 kJ; P = 0.44), although pedal
cadence was slightly higher in MICT compared to HIIT
(79 ± 1 vs. 77 ± 1 rpm; P = 0.02). Heart rate and ratings
of perceived exertion and dyspnoea increased during the
sessions and were greater during HIIT compared to MICT
(Table 1). Blood lactate was also higher for HIIT compared
to MICT (8.0 ± 0.8 vs. 5.5 ± 0.7 mM; P < 0.001).
Withtraining,single-legWpeak increasedfrom150±9.3
to 163 ± 10.0 W in the HIIT group and from 155 ± 8.4 to
163 ± 8.3 W in the MICT group (P = 0.003, main effect
of training), although the change was similar between
groups (P = 0.08, interaction effect). Training did not

Mitochondrial-specific JO2 was unaffected by training or

Single-fibre protein content
Pre-training, type I muscle fibres had greater abundances

the two fibre types had similar abundances of MFN2

or MFN2 (P = 0.21; P = 0.51) protein content in type
I or type II muscle fibres, and there were no significant

Discussion
The major novel finding of the present study was
that interval compared to continuous single-leg cycling,
matched for total work and session duration, elicited
greater increases in mitochondrial content in human
skeletal muscle. These data suggest an important role
for exercise intensity, and/or the pattern of contraction,
in determining skeletal muscle adaptations to aerobic
exercise training. Building on recent work (Abbiss et al.
2011; Vincent et al. 2015) and analogous to single-limb
training studies that have examined skeletal muscle
responses to resistance training (Chesley et al. 1992;
Burd et al. 2012; Mitchell et al. 2012), the present study
demonstrates the utility of single-leg cycling as a model
to investigate adaptations to different exercise training
protocols within the same subject.

training adaptations. Whole muscle COXIV protein
content, CS maximal activity and mass-specific JO2
in permeabilized muscle fibres are associated with
mitochondrial volume density (Larsen et al. 2012) and
represent a hierarchical assessment of mitochondrial
content (i.e. protein content, enzyme activity, organelle
function, respectively). In the present study, 2 weeks of
HIIT induced greater increases in CS maximal activity
and mass-specific JO2 (PCI and PCI&CII) relative to MICT,
whereas the training-induced increase in whole muscle
COXIV protein content was similar between groups. Of
note, CS maximal activity and mass-specific JO2 are more
strongly related to mitochondrial volume density than is
ETS complex 4 protein content (Larsen et al. 2012). These
results agreed with our hypothesis, which was based on
higher exercise intensities augmenting the acute activation
of processes related to mitochondrial biogenesis relative
to lower intensities, when work is matched (Egan et al.
2010; Di Donato et al. 2014; Kristensen et al. 2015).
The divergent adaptations elicited by HIIT and MICT in
the present study probably reflect acute differences in the
activationofpathwaysthatregulatemitochondrialcontent
that compound with training (Coffey and Hawley, 2007;
Perry et al. 2010). Blood lactate concentration, heart rate,
and ratings of perceived exertion and dyspnoea were also
greater with HIIT relative to MICT, suggesting that HIIT
provided a greater metabolic stress despite the equivalent
total work performed.
The present study is the first to use a single-leg cycling
model to compare HIIT and MICT. Our within-subject,
parallel-group design provided adequate statistical power
to demonstrate that HIIT induced significantly greater
increases in multiple markers of mitochondrial content
relative to MICT. To our knowledge, three other
studies have compared mitochondrial adaptations to
work-matched HIIT and MICT in humans. Using a
cross-over design, Daussin et al. (2008a) demonstrated
that an 8 week HIIT intervention, involving four to seven
1 min intervals (90% Wpeak) per session, elicited a greater
increase in mass-specific JO2 (PCI) relative to a MICT
protocol that involved cycling at �60% Wpeak. By contrast,
Granata et al. (2016) recently reported that mitochondrial
content(CSmaximalactivity,mass-specificJO2 andCOXII
protein content) was unchanged after 4 weeks of MICT or
HIIT. The observation that their HIIT protocol, which
involved four to seven 4 min intervals (�80–90% Wpeak)
per session, did not elicit a training effect is contrary to
the present data, as well as previous studies of short-term
HIIT (Talanian et al. 2006; Little et al. 2010; Jacobs et al.
2013; Cochran et al. 2015a). Finally, Henriksson and
Reitman (1976) reported similar increases in succinate
dehydrogenase activity following 8 weeks of HIIT (+27%)

small (n = 4 and n = 5, respectively) and comparisons
were made between subjects. The present findings and the
results reported by Daussin et al. (2008a), which each used
a within-subject design, suggest that intensity, and/or the
pattern of contraction (see further discussion below), are
important determinants of mitochondrial adaptations to
short-term exercise training.
The ETS proteins, COXIV and NDUFA9, were chosen
to assess mitochondrial content (Larsen et al. 2012),
whereas MFN2 was chosen to assess mitochondrial fusion
(Yan et al. 2012). Although exercise is known to increase
mitochondrial content, less is known about its effects on
mitochondrialdynamics(Perryetal.2010;Yanetal.2012).
The content of these proteins increased in response to
training at the whole muscle level, suggesting increased

mitochondrial content and potentially greater rates of
mitochondrial fusion. Because we only measured MFN2,
more data are needed to understand the effects of
exercise and exercise intensity on aspects of mitochondrial
dynamics.
We hypothesized that exercise-induced adaptations in
type II muscle fibres would be greater in response to HIIT
relative to MICT as a result of greater skeletal muscle
activation/fatigue (Theurel and Lepers, 2008; Kristensen
et al. 2015); however, the effect of training appeared to
be depressed in pooled fibres: the response of COXIV
protein content in type I and type II muscle fibres
followed the same pattern as the whole muscle data,
except with smaller (non-significant) mean differences
between groups. We have shown that pooling as few as
four muscle fibres is sufficient to obtain a representative
sample of the muscle (Christiansen D, MacInnis MJ,
Zacharewicz E, Frankish BP & Murphy RM; unpublished
data), which suggests that inter-fibre variation in protein
content was probably not responsible for the absence
of a training effect. Both COXIV and NDUFA9 were
more abundant in type I compared to type II muscle
fibres, reflecting the well known fibre-type difference
in mitochondrial content of the human vastus lateralis
muscle fibres (Howald et al. 1985) and agreeing with pre-
vious studies of mitochondrial protein content measured
in pooled individual fibres (Albers et al. 2015; Christensen
et al. 2015). MFN2 was expressed similarly in type I
and type II fibres. Although we were able to identify
fibre type-specific differences in protein content, it is
possible that more muscle fibres would need to be
pooled to detect the effect of training, which was smaller
than the observed fibre type differences for COXIV and
NDUFA9.

The present study assessed mitochondrial adaptations
to a relatively short training period. Mitochondrial
content is known to increase rapidly and plateau with
aerobic-based exercise training. For example, increases in
mitochondrial adaptations to exercise stabilized after three
tosevensessionsofHIIT(Perry etal.2010)orMICT(Egan
et al. 2013). The six sessions of exercise used in the pre-
sent study (at least with respect to HIIT) were sufficient
to elicit relatively large increases in CS maximal activity
(39%), various states of mass-specific JO2 (12–22%) and
COXIV protein content (24%) that were comparable to
previous 2 week studies of HIIT (Hood et al. 2011; Jacobs
et al. 2013; Cochran et al. 2015a).
An important attribute of the present study was
that training intensity and duration were not altered
during the experiment. Green et al. (2012) reported
similar metabolic adaptations to short-term training for
30 or 60 min day−1 when exercising at 60% ˙
VO2,peak;
however,Greenetal.(2013)alsodemonstratedaugmented
metabolic adaptations in response to longer training
sessions when the exercise intensity was higher (i.e. 70%
and 86% of ˙
VO2,peak). This pair of studies suggests that
exercise duration does affect skeletal muscle remodelling,
although this effect is intensity-dependent. Such findings
are in agreement with an early study in rats (Fitts et al.
1975); however, there is also evidence that increasing the
exercise duration does not affect mitochondrial content
in humans (Rosenkilde et al. 2015) or rats (Dudley
et al. 1982). Ultimately, given that the effect of exercise
duration is potentially intensity-dependent, altering the
duration of training sessions during an experiment
might hinder the comparisons of different exercise
intensities.
In support of the role of exercise intensity in mediating
human skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise (Gibala
et al. 2012), SIT typically elicits similar (Saltin et al. 1976;
Gibala et al. 2006; Burgomaster et al. 2008) or greater
(Granata et al. 2016) skeletal muscle adaptations relative
to MICT, even when less work is performed (Gibala et al.
2006; Burgomaster et al. 2008; Granata et al. 2016). In
one of the few work-matched comparison of SIT and
MICT (Saltin et al. 1976), the progression in the training
stimuli could explain the discordant results: the intensity
of MICT, which was relatively high to begin with (i.e. 75%
of ˙
VO2,max), was increased as necessary to maintain target
heart rate, whereas it appears that the duration of the SIT
protocol was increased to match total work because the
intensity began at 150% of ˙
VO2,peak, and it is difficult to
increase the intensity of ‘all-out’ exercise (Cochran et al.
2015b).
The available data are unclear regarding the potential
for exercise training to increase mitochondrial function
(i.e. mitochondria-specific JO2). Mitochondrial content
(Hoppeler et al. 1973; Jacobs and Lundby, 2013) and
mitochondrial-specific JO2 (Daussin et al. 2008b; Jacobs
and Lundby, 2013) are greater in the muscle of aerobically
trained individuals relative to less trained individuals,
suggesting that training might increase mitochondrial
content and function (Bishop et al. 2014). Although
short-term aerobic exercise training has been shown to
increasemitochondrialfunction(Starrittetal.1999),most
studies do not support this result (Wibom et al. 1992;
Tonkonogi et al. 2000; Jacobs et al. 2013). In the pre-
sent study, mitochondrial-specific JO2 was unaffected by
training, which is in agreement with these latter studies. A
recent comparison of HIIT and MICT also demonstrated
no effect of training on mitochondrial function (Granata
et al. 2016). In that same study, mitochondrial-specific JO2
increased in the SIT group; however, the non-significant
increase in CS maximal activity (to which mass-specific
JO2 was normalized) was lower than the changes reported
in previous SIT studies (Burgomaster et al. 2006; Little
et al. 2010; Cochran et al. 2015b). Mass-specific JO2 values
(PCI, PCI&CII and E) normalized to COXIV or NDUFA9
proteincontent(i.e.alternativemeasuresofmitochondrial
function) were also unaffected by training (data not
reported).
The aim of the present study was to compare work- and
duration-matched aerobic exercise training programmes
differing in intensity, necessitating an interval format
for the high-intensity exercise protocol. Thus, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the interval style of exercise per
se is partly responsible for the divergent mitochondrial
adaptations observed between HIIT and MICT. An
acute session of moderate-intensity exercise performed
in a series of 30 intervals of 1 min in duration was
demonstratedtoelicitgreateracutemolecularresponsesin
skeletal muscle compared to 30 min of continuous exercise
performed at the same intensity (Combes et al. 2015);
however, it is unclear whether these acute differences
would be apparent with fewer intervals, as in the pre-
sent study, or translate to divergent chronic adaptations.
We hypothesize that the augmented response observed
following HIIT compared to MICT is a result of
greater cellular stress incurred by exercising at a higher
intensity. In general, higher intensities of exercise use
more glycogen, produce more lactate and augment the
Cr:PCr and AMP:ATP ratios compared to lower intensities
of exercise (Gollnick et al. 1974; Vøllestad et al. 1985;
Howlett et al. 1998; Egan et al. 2010; Kristensen et al.
2015). Downstream of these metabolic differences, the
activity of AMPK (Wojtaszewski et al. 2000; Kristensen
et al. 2015), an energy-sensing molecule that regulates
mitochondrial biogenesis, and other signalling pathways
related to mitochondrial content, including the expression
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
coactivator 1α (Egan et al. 2010), is also greater at higher
intensities of exercise. In the present study, blood lactate
was greater following HIIT compared to MICT; however,
we did not assess any acute skeletal muscle responses,

preventing conclusions on the metabolic basis of the
observed differences in response to 2 weeks of HIIT and
MICT.
Short-term HIIT generally increases ˙
VO2,peak (Talanian
et al. 2006; Perry et al. 2008; Jacobs et al. 2013);
however, the six sessions of single-leg cycling HIIT in
the present study were insufficient to increase single-leg
˙
VO2,peak. This finding is potentially a result of the
relatively lower cardiorespiratory stimulus associated with
single-leg cycling; however, ˙
VO2,peak has been increased
with longer periods of single-leg cycling training (Saltin
et al. 1976; Rud et al. 2012). The reduced cardio-
respiratory demand allows single-leg cycling to be used as
a training stimulus for patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (Dolmage and Goldstein, 2006;
Dolmage, 2008), as well as trained cyclists (Abbiss et al.
2011). For the latter group, 3 weeks of single-leg cycling
HIIT augmented mitochondrial adaptations relative to
double-legged cycling HIIT, probably as a result of the
greater relative intensity (Abbiss et al. 2011). That the
oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle increased markedly
in the present study (at least with HIIT), whereas the
single-leg ˙
VO2,peak was unchanged, supports the concept
of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity exceeding, and
thus not restricting, aerobic capacity (Boushel et al. 2011).
Unilateral exercise training is frequently used to
investigate skeletal muscle remodelling in response to
resistance exercise (Chesley et al. 1992; Burd et al. 2012;
Mitchell et al. 2012), although comparisons of aerobic
exercise training protocols typically use between-subject
designs (Gibala et al. 2006; Burgomaster et al. 2008;
Granata et al. 2016). Unlike cross-over designs (Daussin
et al. 2008a), single-leg cycling permits within-subject
designs that have a parallel-group design, minimizing
the influence of individual differences and confounding
factors at the same time as also eliminating the need for
washout periods. If a between-subject design had been
usedinthepresentstudy,amuchlargernumberofsubjects
would have been needed to detect statistically differences
in markers of mitochondrial content (i.e. �70 subjects for
CS maximal activity).
In
conclusion,
this
experiment
compared
two
short-term, exercise-training protocols that were matched
for work and session duration. The main finding was
that interval compared to continuous single-leg cycling
elicited superior mitochondrial adaptations in human
skeletal muscle, as indicated by higher CS maximal activity
and mass-specific JO2 (PCI and PCI&CII) after training.
By contrast, mitochondrial function was unaffected by
either training protocol, suggesting that the observed
adaptations reflect an increase in mitochondrial content
with short-term training. The present data suggest that
exercise intensity, and/or the pattern of contraction, is
an important determinant of exercise-induced skeletal
muscle remodelling in humans.
