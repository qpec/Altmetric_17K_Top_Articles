relevant, low levels of BPA exposure during development led to advanced hatching time, increased
numbers of GnRH3 neurons in both terminal nerve and hypothalamus, increased expression of repro-

isphenol A (BPA), a well-known endocrine disrupting
chemical, is a constituent of plastic polycarbonate and
epoxy resins, which are widely used to produce plastic
food and beverage containers, paints, adhesives, drinking
water pipe linings, dental sealants, and household paper
products. To meet these manufacturing needs, 2.7 billion
kilograms of BPA were produced worldwide in 2008 and
5.5 billion kilograms were projected to be produced in the
United States and Europe by 2015 (1, 2). The total release
of BPA to the environment was about 2.5 million kilo-
grams in 2007, with direct release of 13 772 kilograms to
water (3). According to studies from the United States,
China, Japan, Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain,
BPA levels in river water were 8 �g/L or less but reached
as high as 21 �g/L (4). Also, studies have determined that
BPA can be measured in human serum, urine, umbilical
cord blood, amniotic fluid, and placental tissue (5–7). Se-
rum concentrations of BPA were found to covary with sex
steroid hormone levels in humans, suggesting that BPA
could have an effect on human reproductive function, spe-
cifically by altering circulating steroid hormones (8, 9). As
a consequence of its ubiquitous existence in the environ-
ment, wide detection in human biological samples, and
extensive application in our daily lives, BPA has raised

 considerable public health concerns (10). As a result, some
regulatory agencies, such as the European Commission
(11), the US Food and Drug Administration (12), and
Health Canada (13), have banned the use of BPA during
recent years in baby bottles. Given these restrictions and
societal pressure, manufacturers seeking BPA alternatives
have turned to alternative chemicals to produce BPA-free
products (14).
Bisphenol S (BPS) is one of the BPA-alternative chem-
icals, and its production is increasing annually (15). Based
on previous studies, BPS was considered a safer alternative
toBPAbecauseofitssignificantlylowerestrogenicactivity
and excellent stability against high temperature and resis-
tance to sunlight (16–18). BPS has been detected in sedi-
ment samples (19), canned foodstuffs (20), thermal paper
receipts (14), and human urine (21). Recent work in ze-
brafish reported potential effects of BPS on endocrine and
reproductive functions. Ji et al (22) showed that exposure
to low levels of BPS could affect the feedback regulatory
circuits of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis and
impair offspring development. Additional work suggests
that developmental exposure to environmentally relevant
concentrations of BPS advances hypothalamic neurogen-
esis in embryonic zebrafish (23) and has adverse effects on
different parts of the endocrine system in adult zebrafish
(24).
GnRH, a decapeptide hormone synthesized in the hy-
pothalamus, is critical for normal vertebrate reproductive
function by stimulating the release of FSH and LH from
theanteriorpituitary,whichinturnregulategonadalfunc-
tions (25). Moreover, the neuropeptide kisspeptin (Kiss)
and its receptor GPR54 (now known as Kiss receptor
[Kissr]) have been shown to play important roles in reg-
ulating GnRH neuron biology in mammals (26, 27). Thus,
BPA and other endocrine disrupting chemicals could po-
tentially alter the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis, in
part, by affecting the GnRH and/or Kiss systems. Previous
studies have shown that BPA elicits weak estrogenic ac-
tivity, alters release of GnRH and Kiss and interferes with
neuroendocrine function. Specifically, acute BPA expo-
sure at the level of 10 nM was found to suppress both
GnRH and Kiss hypothalamic release in female rhesus
monkeys (28). Furthermore, treatment of male rats with
an environmentally relevant dose of BPA from birth until
50 and 90 days increased the numbers of anteroventral
periventricular Kiss neurons and GnRH-immunoreactive
cells (29). Similar to mammals, zebrafish express multiple
forms of GnRH, including GnRH2 and GnRH3 (but not
GnRH1). In zebrafish, GnRH3 is considered to be the
hypophysiotropic form of GnRH based on the localiza-
tion of GnRH3 neurons in the hypothalamus/preoptic
area and high density of GnRH3 nerve terminals in the
anterior pituitary (30). Zebrafish has become an impor-
tant animal model for understanding the molecular and
cellular regulation of GnRH neuron development and
physiology (30, 31). However, relatively few studies have
explored the potential neuroendocrine impact of environ-
mentallyrelevantlevelsofBPAandBPAanalogsinaquatic
animals, including zebrafish. The present study takes ad-
vantage of using a unique transgenic zebrafish model sys-
tem in which GnRH3 neurons are genetically tagged with
a bright variant of green fluorescent protein. This allows
us to visualize GnRH3 morphological changes in the in-
tact brain during early embryonic development (32).
BPA has a relatively weak estrogenic potency compared
with natural estradiol (E2) based on its binding affinity
and activating capacity on estrogen receptors (ERs) (33).
ERs are expressed in developing hypothalamic cells and
participate in the regulation of the neuroendocrine re-
sponse (34). Thus, xenoestrogens like BPA and BPS may
target neuroendocrine systems and modulate their neuro-
secretory competence by acting as weak ER agonists (35).
For the purposes of the present study using zebrafish as a
model system, it is notable that BPA has been shown to
activate ERs in several teleost species (36–38).
BPA is also thought to exert its effects via thyroid hor-
mone receptor (THR) and the aromatase (AROM) path-
ways because it induces strong brain-specific overexpres-
sion of thyroid receptors and aromatase (39, 40). The
objective of the present study is to determine the impact of
BPA and BPS on the reproductive neuroendocrine system
during development and to reveal possible cellular path-
ways mediating those effects. We investigated the effects
of a range of BPA concentrations on embryo survival,
hatching rate, and GnRH3 neuron numbers in the termi-
nal nerve (TN) and hypothalamus (HYPO) as well as the
expression of reproductive-neuroendocrine related genes
including kisspeptins 1 and 2 (kiss1 and kiss2), kiss1r,
kiss2r, gnrh3, synaptic vesicle protein-2 (sv2), lh�, fsh�,
er�, and er� during embryonic and early larval develop-
ment. In addition, we investigated the potential roles of
ERs,THRs,andAROMinmediatingtheeffectsofBPAon
the reproductive neuroendocrine system. We also studied
whether BPS, a replacement for BPA that is thought to be
safer, caused alterations in normal development of the
reproductive neuroendocrine system in a similar manner
as BPA. The present study adds critical evidence to a small
body of work indicating that exposure to BPS is not nec-
essarily benign.

 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain stock
solutions of 10 g/L each and stored at 4°C. Fresh stock solutions
were made every week. The final working solutions of BPA and
BPS contained no more than 0.005% DMSO. Unless otherwise
noted, all chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animals
We used a transgenic zebrafish in which the GnRH3 pro-
moter drives the expression of a bright variant of green fluores-
cent protein (Emerald green fluorescent protein or EMD) to eas-
ily identify GnRH3 neurons starting from early embryonic
development (32). This was important for the confocal experi-
ments described below; for consistency, we used these transgenic
fish in all experiments. Brass GnRH3-EMD transgenic zebrafish
were maintained in flow-through aquarium systems on a 14-
hour light, 10-hour dark photoperiod at 28°C � 0.5°C. The fish
were fed with flake food and live brine shrimp (Artemia nauplii)
twice daily. Fertilized eggs were collected within 1 hour after
adult spawning. The embryos were kept in a 28°C incubator and
held in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2,
0.3 mM MgSO4). Test solutions (composition described below)
were made in E3 medium. Both control and test solutions were
replaced completely every 12 hours. Zebrafish have no identified
sex chromosomes and cannot be sexed until gonad differentia-
tion occurs (between 35–45 d after fertilization). All of the ex-
periments were performed in embryos and larvae that have not
yet sexually differentiated. All procedures were carried out in
accordance with and approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of California, Los Angeles.
Experimental design
Zebrafish embryos (2 h post fertilization [hpf]) from three to
five male/female mating pairs were randomly distributed in petri
dishes (100 embryos per dish) just prior to exposure to test so-
lutions (50 mL). The embryos were exposed to BPA at concen-
trations of 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 �g/L in E3 medium starting
at 2 hpf until either 25 or 120 hpf. Hatching rate, an important
index for evaluation of embryonic development, defined as the
percentage of hatched embryos to all survived ones, was re-
corded at 48 hpf and 55 hpf. Survival rate, defined as the per-
centage of embryos that survived under all treatment conditions,
was recorded every 24 hours for 120 hours.
The forebrain populations of GnRH3 neurons were analyzed
by confocal microscopy during early embryogenesis at 25 hpf
(n � 14 embryos per treatment group), and neuroendocrine-
related gene expression was measured at both 25 hpf and 120 hpf
(20 embryos per treatment group; n � 6 replicate experiments).
Later experiments compared the effects of BPA and BPS using the
outcome from the previous study. Embryos were exposed to 100
�g/L BPA and 100 �g/L BPS for 25 hpf. This is the dose of BPA
that had consistent effects on GnRH3 neuron number and re-
productive-related gene expression (Figure 1, B, C, and D). As
with the previous study, forebrain populations of GnRH3 neu-
rons were analyzed by confocal microscopy (n � 14 embryos per
treatment group) and neuroendocrine-related gene expression
was measured (20 embryos per treatment group; n � 6 replicate
experiments).
The final set of experiments explored potential signal trans-
duction pathways, including ERs, THRs, and AROM that con-
verts androgen to estrogen, which might mediate the actions of
BPA and BPS on neuroendocrine-related gene expression. Em-
bryos (50 embryos per treatment group; n � 6 replicate exper-
iments)wereexposedfor120hoursto100�g/LBPAor100�g/L
BPS and in the presence or absence of the ER antagonist ICI
182780 (ICI; 1 �M), the THR antagonist amiodarone hydro-
chloride (AMIO; 1 �M), or the AROM inhibitor fadrozole hy-
drochloride (FAD; 1 �M). The concentrations of these antago-
nists/inhibitors are according to previous work in zebrafish by
Kinch et al (23). ICI can have partial agonist and antagonist
actions depending on the system studied. In zebrafish, it has been
shown to act as an antagonist of all three ERs: esr1, esr2a, and
esr2b (41). If any of these inhibitors block the actions of BPA or
BPS,itwouldsuggestwhichcellularpathwaysmediatetheeffects
of these endocrine-disrupting chemicals on expression of the re-
productive-neuroendocrine related genes investigated.
Measurement of BPA in test solutions
The test solutions were collected after a 12-hour exposure to
zebrafish embryos and filtered through 0.45-�m membrane fil-
ters (Anpel). The exposure concentrations of BPA were deter-
mined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity liquid chromato-
graph equipped with a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (3 � 100
mm, 2.7 �m) and an Agilent 6460 triple-quadrupole mass spec-
trometer. Sample injection volume was 5 �L and the flow rate
was 0.4 mL/min. The mobile phases started with 5% methanol
and 95% water. The gradient was increased to 90% methanol at
0.75 minutes and then held for 4 minutes. The tandem mass
spectrometry parameters are as follows: capillary voltage of
2500 V, nebulizing pressure of 35.0 psi, sheath gas temperature
at 350°C, sheath gas flow at 6 L/min. The mass spectrometer was
operated with the following ion transition: BPA (227.23212.2).
The detection limit of the assay was 2.30 ng/L. Because BPS has
been shown to be more stable than BPA (16), we did not measure
its potential degradation.
Confocal microscopy
Transgenic embryos (25 hpf) expressing the GnRH3-EMD
gene were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) over-
night at 4°C for morphological analysis of GnRH3-EMD neu-
rons. Fixed embryos were mounted in 0.8% agarose in the ven-
tral-side up position to best observe both TN and HYPO
populations of GnRH3 neurons. Images were taken and ana-
lyzed under an upright Olympus confocal microscope using a
water immersion 40� objective lens and Fluoview software
(Olympus America Inc). An Argon laser (488 nm) with an emis-
sion barrier filter of 510 nm was used to detect EMD fluores-
cence. Optical sections were made at an interval of 1 �m along
the z-axis. Following image analysis, the number of GnRH3-
EMD neurons in TN and HYPO were analyzed blind to the
treatments.
RNA isolation, reverse transcriptase, and
quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the homogenates of 20 ze-
brafish larvae from each sample pool using the Quick-RNA
miniprep kit (Zymo Research), following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed from
1000 ng of total RNA in a final volume of 20 �L using the

tative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR master
mix kit (Life Technologies) and Mx3000P qPCR system (Agilent
Technologies).Thereactionmixtureconsistedof1�LcDNA,10
�L 2� qPCR mixture, and the appropriate forward and reverse
primers to a final volume of 20 �L. Quantitative PCR conditions
were set as follows: 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles
of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. The fluorescent
signals were measured at the annealing/extension step. Melting
curve analyses were performed to validate the specificity of PCR
amplicons. Ribosomal protein L13A (rpl13a) was used as an
internal reference gene for each tested sample according to pre-
vious study (42). A cycle threshold-based relative quantification
with efficiency correction normalizing to rpl13a was calculated
using the 2-��Ct method. For each tested gene, RT-qPCRs were
performed in duplicate on three sets of samples. The primers
specific for target genes and the rpl13a are listed in Table 1. We
followed the convention of gene and protein nomenclature
guidelines for fish as described in Genetics and Molecular Biol-
ogy (43).
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean � SEM. In all experiments, inter-
group differences were assessed by using a one-way ANOVA,
followed by either Dunnett’s or Duncan’s tests, depending on the
experimental design. For all the tested parameters, there was no
significant difference between a blank control group (no DMSO)
andthevehiclecontrolgroup(withDMSO),andthus,thevehicle
control was set as the control group for the statistical analysis
that followed. The level for statistical significance was set at P �
.05, indicated by an asterisk in the figures. The correlations be-
tween measured parameters were analyzed according to Pear-
son’s test and the level for statistical significance was set at P �
.05, indicated by an asterisk in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.
Statistical analyses used SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA).
Results
Exposure concentrations of BPA
There is concern that BPA might degrade during the
courseoftreatment.ToconfirmtheconcentrationsofBPA
during treatment, BPA levels in exposure solutions were
measured using LC-MS/MS. Measured exposure concen-
trations deviated less than 15% from the nominal con-
centrations of BPA (Table 2). BPA levels were undetect-
able in the control solution. These results indicate that

 BPA did not degrade to an appreciable level under the
conditions of these experiments.
Hatching and survival rates
The normal time of hatching of zebrafish embryos oc-
curs between 2 and 3 days after fertilization. We measured
the hatching rate of each group at 48 and 55 hpf. Com-
parisons were made between controls and the different
doses of BPA at each of the two time points. We observed
a significantly higher hatching rates at both time points in
embryos upon exposure to environmentally relevant con-
centrations of 1 and 10 �g/L BPA, compared with the
controls (ANOVA, P � .001; Dunnett’s test, P � .05)
(Figure 1A). Higher concentrations of BPA had no effect
on hatching rates compared with controls. At 72 hpf, all
the embryos in the control group had hatched. After ex-
posure for 120 hours, there was no significant difference
in survival rate among embryos treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10,
100, and 1000 �g/L BPA (data not shown). The results
indicate that exposure to low levels of BPA significantly
advanced the time of hatching without impacting embryo
survival.
Effects of BPA on GnRH3 neuron numbers in TN
and HYPO
We investigated the effects of BPA on the development
of GnRH3 neurons by analyzing the number of GnRH3
neurons in the forebrain of embryos. As shown in Figure
1, B and C, the numbers of GnRH3 neurons in TN and
HYPO were increased after BPA exposure. Specifically,
100 �g/L BPA increased TN-GnRH3 neuron numbers
(ANOVA, P � .003; Dunnett’s test, P � .05), and both 10
and 100 �g/L increased HYPO-GnRH3 neuron numbers
as compared with controls (ANOVA, P � .004; Dunnett’s
test, P � .05) at 25 hpf (Figure 1C).
Effects of BPA on expression of reproductive
neuroendocrine-related genes
The effects of BPA treatment (100 �g/L) on the expres-
sion levels of several reproductive neuroendocrine-related
genes were analyzed at 25 and 120 hpf to determine the
potential impact of BPA on the early developing hypo-
thalamo-anterior pituitary axis. Figure 1D shows relative
levels of kiss1, kiss1r, gnrh3, lh�, fsh�, and sv2 mRNAs.
With the exception of fsh� and sv2, all of the other mR-
NAsshowedasignificantincreaseinresponseto10and/or
100 �g/L BPA treatment at 25 hpf. We included sv2 anal-
ysis because of our earlier work showing that this marker
for synaptic transmission is expressed on GnRH3 neurons
during embryonic development (44). Interestingly, the
highest concentration of BPA (1000 �g/L) had no effect on
expression levels any of the mRNAs at 25 hpf (Figure 1D).
A similar pattern of gene expression responses was seen at
Table 2.

(ANOVA, P � .001; Dunnett’s test, P � .05) mRNAs now
showing significant increases in expression in response to
BPA. In contrast to 25 hpf, treatment with the highest dose
of BPA (1000 �g/L) at 120 hpf increased the expression of
kiss1, kiss1r, gnrh3, lh�, fsh�, and sv2. Unlike kiss1 and
kiss1r, kiss2 and kiss2r expression showed no significant
changeinresponsetoanyconcentrationofBPAateithertime

neuron numbers in TN and HYPO as well as expression
levels of reproductive neuroendocrine-related genes at 25
and 120 hpf were analyzed according to Pearson’s test (SPSS
18.0) (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Our analyses indicated
a statistically significant relationship of most tested param-
etersatboth25and120hpf.Notably,weobservedthatkiss1
and gnrh3 mRNA levels at 120 hpf significantly correlated
with expression levels of all other neuroendocrine-related
genes (P � .05). Together all these results suggest Kiss1 is the
primary regulator of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis in ze-
brafish under normal conditions.

ToevaluatetheimpactofBPSexposureonthezebrafish

and sv2 gene expression (Supplemen-
tal Figure 1). Furthermore, 100 �g/L
BPA showed similar effects on repro-
ductive neuroendocrine-related gene
expression in Figure 2 as in the earlier
experiments shown in Figure 1D, pro-
viding a strong measure of reproduc-
ibility and validation of the results.

 neuroendocrine system, we first analyzed the effects of
these endocrine-disrupting chemicals on ER-� (er�) and
ER-� (er�) gene expression. The mRNA levels of er� were
significantly increased in response to BPA at 25 (ANOVA,
P � .001; Dunnett’s test, P � .05) and 120 hpf (ANOVA,
P � .003; Dunnett’s test, P � .05), whereas there was no
effect on er� (Figure 3, A–C). As with BPA, treatment with
BPS significantly increased the expression of er� but not
er�at25hpf(Figure3C).ThesedatasuggestthatER�,but
not ER�, mediates the effects of BPA and BPS on the re-
productive neuroendocrine system of zebrafish. Figure 3
shows that treatment with the ER antagonist ICI signifi-
cantly inhibited the increase of kiss1 (Figure 3D), gnrh3
(Figure 3F), and er� (Figure 3I) gene expression in re-
sponse to 120 hours of treatment of BPA (Duncan’s test,
P � .05). ICI did not significantly inhibit the stimulatory
actions of BPS (also 120 h of treatment) on the expression
of kiss1r (Figure 3E), lh� (Figure 3G), and er� (Figure 3I).
However, ICI did significantly inhibit the stimulatory ac-
tion of BPS on expression of gnrh3 (Figure 3F) and fsh�
(Figure 3H).
Roles of the THR and AROM B
pathways in mediating effects
of BPA and BPS on reproductive
neuroendocrine-related gene
expression
We also investigated two other
components of endocrine systems
that are known to ultimately impact
reproductive functions that are mod-
ulated by BPA: the THR and AROM
pathways (39, 45–47). We used the
THR antagonist AMIO and the
AROM inhibitor FAD to determine
whether THR and AROM mediate
the effects of BPA and/or BPS on re-
productive neuroendocrine gene ex-
pression (Figure 4). The survival rate
of zebrafish embryos was not signif-
icantly altered in response to the
treatments at 120 hpf (data not
shown). AMIO significantly attenu-
ated the stimulatory actions of BPA
on gene expression of kiss1r (Figure
4B), gnrh3 (Figure 4C), and lh� (Fig-
ure 4D) (ANOVA, P � .001; Dun-
can’s test, P � .05). Similarly, AMIO
significantly attenuated the stimula-
tory actions of BPS gene expression
of kiss1r (Figure 4B) and lh� (Figure
4D) but not the other reproductive
neuroendocrine-related genes. These findings suggest that
THRs partly mediate the stimulatory actions of BPA and
BPS on the reproductive neuroendocrine system.
AROM is the key enzyme for local estradiol synthesis
from androgen substrate, and is expressed in hypotha-
lamicprogenitorcells(18).Figure4showsthattheAROM
inhibitor FAD significantly attenuated the stimulatory ac-
tions of BPA on gene expression of kiss1 (Figure 4A),
gnrh3 (Figure 4C), lh� (Figure 4D), and er� (Figure 4F)
(ANOVA, P � .001; Duncan’s test, P � .05). Similarly,
FAD attenuated the stimulatory actions of BPS on gene
expression of kiss1r (Figure 4B), gnrh3 (Figure 4C), lh�
(Figure 4D), and er� (Figure 4F). These results suggest that
AROM enzymatic activity is partly required for mediating
the stimulatory actions of BPA and BPS. Together the out-
comes from this study provide strong evidence that ER�,
THRs, and AROM pathways are all involved in mediating
the effects of BPA and BPS on the reproductive neuroen-
docrine system. The outcomes from pharmacological ex-
periments shown in Figures 3 and 4 are summarized in
Table 3. As shown in Table 3, treatment with ICI, AMIO,
and FAD significantly inhibited the stimulatory effects of

Discussion
Using zebrafish as a model for investigating the impact of
endocrine disrupting chemicals on vertebrate embryonic
development, we show that ecologically relevant levels of
BPA and BPS alter many aspects of
the
reproductive
neuroendocrine
system. In response to BPA, hatching
time was accelerated. This is very
similar to what was seen in an earlier
study in embryonic medaka fish
(45). Together these results suggest
that exposure to low levels of BPA
may have a broad implication on em-
bryonic development in teleosts. It
was suggested by Herman-Giddens
(48) that increased exposure to ex-
ogenous hormones was included as
one of many potential factors that
could advance the timing of puberty.
Moreover, continued exposure to
BPA beyond the early developmental
stage might have an ecological im-
pact on the health and sustainability
of fish populations (49). In addition,
GnRH3 neuron numbers in TN and
HYPO were significantly increased
at 25 hpf in response to BPA. This
could be due to either BPA having a
broad effect on embryonic and/or
central nervous system development as suggested by the
accelerated rate of hatching or having specific effects on
development of certain aspects of the reproductive axis.
Given that BPA (and BPS) enhanced expression of some,
but not all, of the genes investigated suggests that there is
at least some selectivity of these endocrine disruptors’ ac-
tions on embryonic development.
The expression of reproductive-neuroendocrine re-
lated genes such as kiss1, kiss1r, gnrh3, and lh� was sig-
nificantly increased at both 25 and 120 hpf, whereas sv2
and fsh� were increased only at 120 hpf. Moreover, the
alterations of most tested parameters were significantly
correlated at both 25 and 120 hpf, indicating a coordi-
nated modulation process in the early development of ze-
brafish that is sensitive to both dose and duration of vary-
ing doses and durations of BPA exposure. Consistent with
our present observations, Qin et al (50) have shown that
exposure to 15 �g/L BPA increased gnrh3 and gnrhr1a in
the brains of adult rare minnow. Vosges et al (51) reported
that 17�-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a xenoestrogenic endo-
crine disrupting chemical, at concentrations as low as 0.1
nM disrupts the ontogeny of the GnRH system by induc-
ing a dose-dependent increase in the number of GnRH3
neurons during zebrafish development. Also, some repro-
duction-related genes have been found to be up-regulated
in response to EE2 in female Coho salmon (52) and in
fathead minnow’s early-life stages (53). These findings are

 similar to the observations in our study showing the effects
of BPA and BPS on GnRH3 neuron number and the ex-
pression levels of reproductive neuroendocrine-related
genes during early zebrafish development. The earlier
studies support our findings that BPA and BPS are acting,
at least in part, through an ER-activated pathway.
Our results revealed that BPA had significant effects on
hatching rate and early development of the reproductive
neuroendocrine system at concentrations as low as 10
�g/L. Environmental concentrations of BPA are known to
cause alterations to the reproductive systems in a variety
of aquatic vertebrate species. For example, BPA at 2.28
and 22.8 �g/L had sex-altering effects on the amphibian
Xenopus laevis (54), whereas BPA at 15 �g/L induced
gnrh3 and gnrhr1a expression in adult rare minnow (50).
In the present study, we found a shift in the sensitivity of
reproductive neuroendocrine-related genes as a function
of age of the embryo/larvae. During early embryogenesis
at 25 hpf, 10 and 100 �g/L of BPA were most effective in
up-regulating gene expression but not at a higher dose of
1000 �g/L. This finding is consistent with previous work
showing that nonlinear dose responses are commonly ob-
served for hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals
(55). Notably, at 120 hpf, 1000 �g/L was now effective in
up-regulating gene expression. We interpret these findings
to indicate that the effects of BPA on the expression of
reproductive neuroendocrine-related genes depend on the
duration of exposure and stage of development. This sup-
ports earlier work showing that BPA can have very dif-
ferent effects on development based on the time point of
exposure (56).
Our results revealed that BPA and BPS up-regulated the
expression of the Kiss1/Kiss1r system, which is widely re-
garded as an upstream regulator of GnRH neurons, in-
cluding in fish (57). Furthermore, there was a very high
correlation in the present study between kiss1 and gnrh3
levels (correlation coefficient of 0.8) in response to BPA.
As such, it is possible that endocrine disrupting chemicals’
effects on GnRH neuron number and gnrh mRNA levels
in the present study could have been mediated through
activation of the Kiss1/Kiss1r system. Notably, neither
BPA nor BPS altered the expression of kiss2. Recent work
from our laboratory showed that treatment with Kiss1,
but not Kiss2, increased the number of TN and HYPO
GnRH3 neurons during zebrafish embryogenesis as well
as synaptic contacts on TN-GnRH3 neurons (44). To-
gether these findings lend support to the hypothesis that
Kiss1 is the primary regulator of the hypothalamo-pitu-
itary axis in zebrafish under normal conditions. However,
recent work in zebrafish using a gene knockout strategy
showed that expression of kiss1, kiss2, kiss1r, and kiss2r
are not required for reproductive functions (58). This sug-
gests that in zebrafish, the Kiss/Kissr systems modulate
reproductive functions but are not essential like they are in
mammals.
Our results revealed that BPA and BPS affected not only
the GnRH3/Kiss1 systems but also lh�, fsh�, and sv2 gene
expression,
which
significantly
correlated
with
the
changes of kiss1, kiss1r, and gnrh3. FSH and LH, two
distinct gonadotropins, form an integral part of the hy-
pothalamo-pituitary-gonad axis and are key players in
vertebrate gonadal functions. FSH and LH have been
shown to regulate gonad development and reproduction
in a similar manner across different species of teleost fishes
(59, 60). Earlier work in the hermaphroditic fish Kryp-
tolebias marmoratus, showed that BPA exposure in-
creased fsh� and lh� mRNA levels in brain/pituitary. This
is similar to the findings in the present study, in which BPA
significantly increased expression of fsh� and lh� during
development,suggestingthepotentialforBPAexposureto
ultimately impact gonadal development and reproduction
in fish. SV2 is a component of all vertebrate synapses,
including zebrafish, and is important for the efficacy of
synaptic communication (61). Therefore, the increase in
sv2 expression after BPA exposure for 120 hpf could result
in abnormal synaptic transmission.
BPS, considered an important substitute for BPA in in-
dustrial applications, is increasingly used for the produc-
tion of epoxy resins and paper products and as an anti-
corrosive agent in epoxy glues and a reagent in polymer
reactions (14, 62). It has been considered a safer alterna-
tive to BPA for the production of BPA-free products. Ear-
lier work showed that at concentrations as high as 0.1–1
mM (concentrations unlikely to be leached from BPS con-
taining products), BPS showed only slight estrogenic ac-
tivity in a 4-hour, recombinant, two-hybrid yeast test sys-
tem (16, 17). In related work, Chen et al (18) showed that
40 �M BPS had 15-fold lower genomic estrogenic activity
than BPA. Notably, our results showed that both BPA and
BPS are acting through multiple cellular pathways (includ-
ing THR), not limited to an estrogenic pathway. Consis-
tent with our results, Kinch et al (23) showed that low-
dose BPS (1.5 �g/L) resulted in 240% increase in neuronal
birth (neurogenesis) within the hypothalamus, in a similar
manner as with exposure to BPA. Also, observations by Ji
et al (22) showed that exposure of zebrafish to low level
BPS (from 0.5–50 �g/L) could affect the feedback-regu-
latory circuits of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis
and impair the development of offspring. Therefore, BPA-
free plastic products are not necessarily safer than prod-
ucts containing BPA.

 ER� (63, 64). Our results showed that both BPA and BPS
increased expression of er� but not er�. This is consistent
with recent work showing that BPA increased expression
of er� but not er� in macrophages of red carp (38). In the
present study, treatment with the ER antagonist ICI sig-
nificantly inhibited the increase of reproductive neuroen-
docrine-related gene expression in response to 120 hours
treatment with BPA and BPS. Together these findings sug-
gest that both BPA and BPS are acting, at least in part,
through an ER�-mediated pathway. This is supported by
work in mammals showing that ER signaling plays a piv-
otal role in reproductive neuroendocrine responses to BPA
exposure (65, 66).
There is evidence that in addition to affecting ER path-
ways, BPA also influences THR (67) and AROM path-
ways (68). Thyroid hormone of maternal origin has been
shown to regulate gene expression during early develop-
ment of the fetal brain, affecting proteins involved in fate
specification (69). In zebrafish, thyroid hormones play an
important role in development during the embryonic to
larval transitory phase (70). Zoeller and coworkers (67,
71) suggested that BPA acts as a TH antagonist in the
developing rat brain and mediates the negative feedback
effect of TH on the pituitary gland. Also, earlier work in
medaka fish demonstrated that BPA-induced acceleration
of embryonic development and hatching time were
blocked by the THR antagonist AMIO, suggesting an im-
portant role of the THR pathway in mediating the effects
of BPA on development (46). This finding is consistent
with our observations in developing zebrafish that AMIO
significantly attenuated the stimulatory actions of BPA
and BPS on reproductive neuroendocrine-related gene ex-
pression. The present findings reveal that THRs partly
mediate the stimulatory actions of BPA and BPS on the
reproductive neuroendocrine system.
Cytochrome P450 aromatase is central to estrogen syn-
thesis, catalyzing the final, rate-limiting step in the con-
version of androgens to estrogens. Previous work showed
that brain AROM is activated in response to exposure to
estrogenic chemicals including E2, EE2, and BPA in the
adult male zebrafish (72). In embryonic zebrafish, Kinch
et al (23) showed that low-dose (1.5 �g/L) BPA and BPS
exposure induced precocious hypothalamic neurogenesis
that was mediated by AROM signaling. Moreover, our
present results showed that the AROM inhibitor FAD sig-
nificantly attenuated the stimulatory actions of BPA and
BPS on reproductive neuroendocrine-related gene expres-
sion. This outcome revealed that AROM enzymatic ac-
tivity is also partly required for mediating the stimulatory
actions of BPA and BPS on the reproductive neuroendo-
crine system.
In mammal and teleost fish models, the functional in-
teraction between ER-, THR-, and AROM-activated
pathways can serve as an important regulatory link in the
endocrine systems (73, 74). It is well known that E2 up-
regulates AROM gene expression and that these effects
can be blocked by an ER antagonist, suggesting that ERs
are involved in the E2-dependent induction of aromatase
activity (40, 75, 76). In addition, the present results show
that expression levels of er� were significantly increased
by BPA and BPS exposure, and these effects were signifi-
cantly attenuated by the AROM inhibitor FAD, suggest-
ing that the interaction between ER and AROM signaling
pathways was bidirectional in zebrafish in response to
endocrine-disrupting chemicals. However, we have not
observed a similar interaction between the ER and THR
signaling pathways. The present study provides founda-
tional information using a unique model system for inves-
tigating mechanisms by which endocrine disrupting chem-
icals interfere with early-life development. Moreover, this
is the first study to describe the impact of low-level BPA
and BPS exposure on the Kiss/Kissr system during embry-
onic development in any species. It also provides impor-
tant supporting evidence that BPS is not necessarily a safer
alternative to BPA, as suggested by earlier studies focusing
solely on its estrogenic activities.
