Abstract
Motor skills can be maintained for decades, but the biological basis of this memory persistence 
remains largely unknown. The zebra finch, for example, sings a highly stereotyped song that is 
stable for years, but it is not known whether the precise neural patterns underlying song are stable 
or shift from day to day. Here, we demonstrate that the population of projection neurons coding for 
song in the pre-motor nucleus HVC change from day to day. The most dramatic shifts occur over 
intervals of sleep. In contrast to the transient participation of excitatory neurons, ensemble 
measurements dominated by inhibition persist unchanged even after damage to downstream motor 
nerves. These observations offer a principle of motor stability: spatio-temporal patterns of 
inhibition can maintain a stable scaffold for motor dynamics while the population of principle 
neurons that directly drive behavior shift from one day to the next.

 Introduction
Questions about coding stability at the single neuron level have been notoriously difficult to 
address given the challenge of stably recording from single neurons using implanted 
electrodes. In the hippocampus, earlier methods tracking tens of cells emphasized stable 
neural tuning over a timescale of a week 1,2, whereas recent studies tracking thousands of 
cells using new optical techniques 3,4 revealed that 75–85% of the cells change their tuning 
properties within the same timeframe 5. In whisker motor cortex, individual neurons in mice 
trained on an object detection task were unstable, but the relationship between ensemble 
measurements and behavior remained stable 6. These studies support the view that for stable 
behaviors, individual neurons involved can show substantial drift in their tuning properties.
For motor systems, the stability of neural tuning is not necessarily expected– the 
convergence of vast numbers of neurons in motor cortex to relatively few muscles 7 suggests 
that a given muscular activation pattern could be produced by many patterns of neural 
activity 8. In parallel, single neurons in motor cortex are observed to switch tuning properties 
in a task-dependent manner 9. In the case of the zebra finch, the precise timing and acoustic 
structure of song is preserved for years 10,11. Since the zebra finch sings a single song over 
the course of his lifetime, the question of neural coding stability is particularly well-defined. 
In the pre-motor nucleus that drives song, HVC (used as a proper name), three primary 
classes of neurons can be found: inhibitory interneurons, basal-ganglia projecting neurons 
(HVC_X), and motor projecting neurons (HVC_RA). A third projection neuron type 
HVC_AV sparsely populates the nucleus, but its activity has not yet been described in 
singing birds 12. In HVC, each neuron type that has been observed produces a highly 
stereotyped pattern of action potentials, and these patterns are stable over the time intervals 
that they have been recorded: minutes to hours 13,14. For inhibitory interneurons, the pattern 
is dense, with spikes occurring throughout song 14,15. In contrast, excitatory projection 
neurons that communicate with downstream targets fire “ultra sparsely” 13.
During song production, HVC_X neurons and inhibitory interneurons exhibit cell-type 
specific phase-locking to the local field potential (LFP) at 30 Hz. HVC_X cells fire in the 
peak of the LFP and interneurons in the trough 16. Intracellular recordings in vitro and in 
vivo suggest that HVC_RA neurons also fire in gaps of inhibition 17. Moreover, both the 
LFP and projection neuron activity are clustered over a 100 µm length-scale. The phase 
locking relationship between excitatory and inhibitory neurons is only observed with 
multiple neuron recordings in the same small volume– phase shifts across HVC preclude a 
global rhythmic relationship among cell types 18. Taken together, these observations indicate 
that spatially coherent mesoscopic patterns of inhibition underlie HVC dynamics, where 
synchronous gaps in local interneuron population activity control projection neuron timing.
The recent evidence in support of locally organized ensemble activity in HVC allows us to 
raise the following question: What explains the persistence of the song motor pattern, single 
neuron stability, or stability of ensemble dynamics? A recent experiment suggests that HVC 
ensemble dynamics measured through multi-unit activity 19 are resilient to circuit 
perturbations 20. Here we extend the observation of HVC ensemble dynamics using new

 electrophysiological 15 and imaging methods (Fig. 1) to address the stability of excitatory 
projection neurons.
Results
Song is supported by stable mesoscopic dynamics
Local field potentials (LFPs) can reflect the synchronous activity of neural ensembles over a 
length-scale of approximately 100 µm 21 (though see 22). We recorded LFPs in the zebra 
finch pre-motor nucleus HVC using both commercial and previously-described custom 
carbon fiber electrode arrays 15,16 (see Methods). The phase of the 30 Hz LFP is coherent 
with the spiking of HVC interneurons and projection neurons (Fig. 2a–f) 16; we found this 
local phase was precisely conserved over long timescales (Fig. 2g). For most of our implants 
we were able to record the LFP for up to 30 days, and we found that over this timescale the 
30 Hz phase exhibited a drift of less than 0.25 radians or approximately 15 degrees (modal 
change of .244 radians over 30 days, .232–.254, 95% bootstrap confidence interval, 
Supplementary Figure 1a). This stability in LFP phase indicates that ensemble activity, 
reflecting a combination of local spiking and presynaptic inputs, does not undergo a major 
reconfiguration.
Multi-unit ensembles and single inhibitory neurons are stable
The LFP is thought to reflect ensemble activity from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons 
over a length-scale of approximately 100 µms 16, similarly, multi-unit recordings can reflect 
the aggregate activity of tens of nearby neurons within a local volume. To monitor the 
stability of multi-unit activity, we implanted bare carbon fibers with a length matched to the 
full depth of HVC (see Methods). Fig. 2h reveals a multi-unit raster with detailed temporal 
structure in the pattern of firing and silence, with an average precision of 4.587 ms (4.348–
4.843 ms, 95% bootstrap confidence interval, see Methods) consistent with the stereotyped 
neural activity reported previously in HVC 13,23. The neural patterns shown in Fig. 2h 
represent finely timed bursts of activity in an unknown number of cells (the number of 
simultaneously active cells recorded per electrode was more than could be separated by 
spike-sorting). However, spike-field measurements indicate that, as for single inhibitory 
neurons, the multi-unit signal is phase-locked to the trough of the 30 Hz component of the 
LFP. This suggests that the multi-unit signals are dominated by inhibitory interneurons (Fig. 
2c,f) 16. Enhanced representation of inhibitory cell activity in multi-unit signals is to be 
expected since projection neurons fire “ultra-sparsely” 13 and contribute many fewer spikes 
to a multi-unit signal than do interneurons. The suggestion drawn from multi-unit signals 
that patterns of inhibition are stable in HVC (Fig. 2h–j) was directly confirmed in long-term 
single unit recordings from n=6 inhibitory neurons from single unit recordings (3 are shown 
in Fig. 2k). As revealed in Fig. 2k, inhibitory neuron firing patterns were remarkably stable, 
even over a time-scale of months. In addition to the stability of the 30 Hz LFP phase, this 
result indicates that ensemble inhibitory activity is highly stable.
We next asked if the stability of this multi-unit activity depended on sensory feedback. 
Previous work has shown that the statistical distribution of post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) in 
HVC projection neurons is invariant to altered auditory feedback induced through a

 tracheosyringeal (TS) nerve cut 24, but over long timescales, the song of the adult zebra 
finch is known to be maintained through an auditory-feedback dependent process 25,26. We 
anticipated that the rate of drift in the ensemble pattern could increase with perturbations to 
auditory feedback. Following baseline recording, we severed the ipsilateral TS nerve that 
relays motor commands to the birds’ vocal organ (n=5 birds, see Methods). As in previous 
work 24,27, this loss of muscular control results in acoustic distortions of song (Fig. 3a–d, see 
Supplementary Figure 2 for all examples), degrading the learned sensory-motor 
correspondence between vocal commands and auditory feedback. Following this, we 
monitored the song and HVC multi-unit firing patterns for a period of approximately one 
month. Over this time interval, song did not recover, and the multi-unit spike patterns in the 
pre-motor nucleus HVC remained stable (Fig. 3e–f). In all birds subject to the TS cut, shifts 
in the firing pattern occur at the same rate as for baseline recordings (p>.05 for all birds, 
one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, see Methods). We conclude from this that the ensemble 
pattern in HVC is robust to changes in auditory feedback that result from unilateral TS nerve 
removal. Here the song is altered, but the detailed ensemble firing patterns persist in HVC as 
though no change had occurred. This observation is synergistic with a recent study showing 
resilience of the HVC ensemble pattern after neural circuit perturbations 20.
Individual projection neurons are unstable over days
Our electrophysiology methods were typically unable to track individual excitatory 
projection cells over time-scales longer than a single day, perhaps due to limitations of 
recording from smaller cells 15. To provide information about the stability of excitatory 
cells, we turned to optical imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators (Fig. 4a, 
Supplementary Figure 3, see Methods) 16,28 using a virus that labels excitatory projection 
neurons in HVC but does not label inhibitory neurons (see Methods). Imaging during 
singing was accomplished through the use of miniature head-mounted microscopes 3 using 
both a commercial head-mounted microscope (Inscopix, n=1 bird), and a custom 3D–printed 
microscope (n=3 birds) designed to promote freedom of movement in singing birds (Fig. 4 
and Supplementary Figure 4, see Methods). The custom microscope provided the first 
measurements of calcium activity during undirected singing–the solo practice song of the 
zebra finch. Projection neuron calcium activity patterns were sparse and time-locked to 
singing (Fig. 4a). The timing of most projection neurons was stable over several days (Fig. 
5a,b), however, across days, the probability that a given cell fires during singing can change 
dramatically (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Figure 5). Across an interval of days, cells both drop 
out and newly appear in the song pattern (Fig. 5b,c, and Supplementary Figure 6–8). Stable 
and unstable ROIs can be found next to each other (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Figure 6,7).
One class of projection neuron (HVC_X) can produce more than one time-locked burst of 
action potentials during singing. For cells with multiple timing peaks, amplitude or 
probability of activation could change independently for each peak. This was observed both 
in calcium imaging and in electrophysiological recordings, where we have witnessed the 
‘fade-in’ of a second burst time in a projection neuron recorded with a carbon fiber electrode 
over the course of a day (Fig. 5d).

 For the imaging data, we performed analysis on two ROI sets: one analysis included all 
ROIs found on any day of imaging (ROIspresent some days). The second included only ROIs 
unambiguously present on all days of imaging (ROIspresent all days). By the fifth day of 
imaging, across all ROIs recorded, a large number of ROIs showed statistically significant 
changes in their mean song-aligned activity (p<.01 permutation test, 15/39 ROIs for bird 1, 
27/38 for bird 2, 26/76 for bird 3 and 26/81 for bird 4, ROIspresent some days; 11/18, 14/16, 
11/22, 5/21, ROIspresent all days).
The shift in projection neuron activity across multiple days contrasts with our 
electrophysiological recordings, which typically revealed stability of projection firing 
patterns over the course of hours within a single day 13,15,29 (Fig. 6a,b). This contrast 
motivated us to examine whether the shift in projection neuron activity occurred over 
intervals of sleep (Fig 6c–f). We found a much stronger shift in song-aligned projection 
neuron calcium traces after a night of sleep than over the course of a single day (Fig. 6c, 
Supplementary Figure 6, ROIspresent some days p=2.0e-40, z=−13.26, ROIspresent all days 
p=1.6e-14, −7.59, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Next, we checked if drift could be 
accounted for by time elapsed. First, we analyzed whether calcium activity decreased in 
consistency across the day, and, surprisingly found the opposite to be true: consistency 
increased over the course of each day (Fig. 6e, ROIspresent some days r=.14 p=6.1e-9, 
ROIspresent all days r=.18, p=9.7e-7, see Methods). We also found that song-aligned calcium 
activity became more similar to the previous day’s average over the course of the day (Fig. 
6f, ROIspresent some days r=.12, p=5.6e-3, ROIspresent all days r=.25 p=4.3e-9, Spearman rank 
correlation). Thus, calcium traces in single cells change both their mean pattern and variance 
overnight, and then return toward the previous day’s average as the day progresses, while at 
the same time becoming more stereotyped. Given these observations, the drift in calcium 
activity is not simply a function of time elapsed. Rather, these results suggest that sleep 
actively destabilizes the representation of song in pre-motor nucleus HVC.
The microstructure of song changes overnight and increases in consistency throughout 
the day
The finding that projection neuron activity is unstable across days prompted us to examine 
the microstructure of song behavior using a highly-sensitive time-frequency analysis method 
developed for analysis of sparse signals, such as zebra finch song (see Methods). The 
persistence of zebra finch song structure has been documented over timescales of years 10,11 
and as demonstrated in Fig. 1, over the period of a year, the song appears to be remarkably 
stable (Fig. 1A); however, the micro-structure of song is not precisely the same, even in this 
example. High resolution investigation of the microstructure reveals small but significant 
shifts over the interval of a week, and these changes occur primarily over periods of sleep 
(p=9.8e-4 w=55, one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test n=10 similarity scores for n=10 birds, 
Supplementary Figure 9, see Methods). Moreover, similar to the drift in calcium activity, we 
found that song consistency also increases over the course of the day (Fig. 6d, r=.28, 
p=6.6e-8, Spearman rank correlation, see Methods).

 Discussion
This study suggests motor skills encoded in the brain, like many structural features of the 
human body, undergo renewal at the cellular level. Skin maintains its shape despite the 
turnover of cells 30, and the intestinal surface has constant turnover but maintains its 
function 31. For the stable song of the zebra finch, instability of the neural program 
qualitatively matches the microscopic day-to day changes in song, but the song changes 
observed over intervals of sleep are small, while the pattern of neuronal participation 
changes more dramatically. What explains the persistence of the song motor pattern in spite 
of the unstable projection neurons underlying song?
A key finding is that on a mesoscopic scale, the pre-motor nucleus HVC is stable. Over the 
length scales recorded in LFPs and multi-unit recordings (approximately 100 microns), the 
neural basis of song is largely unchanged over a timescale of weeks to years. In contrast, 
individual projection neurons drift–not primarily in the timing of their activity, as much as in 
the burst probability and participation in the song pattern. One potential factor contributing 
to ensemble stability in HVC is the spatial correlation observed in the firing patterns of 
excitatory cells. Nearby excitatory neurons in HVC fire at similar times, and the length-scale 
of this correlation is roughly 100 microns 16. If individual projection neurons fade out of the 
ensemble, nearby projection neurons could be serving redundant roles.
A second related factor contributing to ensemble stability is the role of temporally patterned 
inhibition in HVC. In contrast to the instability of excitatory neuron coding, we have 
observed that inhibitory interneuron firing patterns are stable for weeks or months–for as 
long as it was technically possible to track the firing patterns of the cells. At the simplest 
level, excitatory neurons are postulated to be driven by a relatively sparse number of strong 
synapses, leading to the sparsity of their firing patterns 29,32 In contrast, many inhibitory 
interneurons in HVC have large dendritic arbors and are thought to be driven by a large 
number of presynaptic partners 33. The prediction from HVC connectivity is that changes in 
a small number of synapses could alter the excitatory neuron firing patterns dramatically, but 
influence the inhibitory interneurons very little. In light of this numerical argument, and the 
observed stability of single inhibitory neurons, HVC ensemble patterns could be stabilized if 
interneurons have a strong local influence over projection neuron activity. Indeed, this 
appears to be the case. The firing times of the excitatory projection neurons coincide with 
stereotyped pauses in local inhibition 17,34, and HVC_X excitatory neurons and inhibitory 
interneurons fire in opposite phases of the 30Hz LFP 16. The observations are true on the 
micro-scale, and due to phase shifts across the extent of HVC the rhythmic alternation is not 
observed globally 18. Local blockade of inhibition releases the sparse firing cells from 
inhibition and they begin to fire at multiple times in song 17. Building on these observations, 
a recent modeling study suggested that inhibitory interneuron dynamics can increase the 
robustness of HVC dynamics to added noise 35. These models can be made more precise in 
future experiments as additional cell-type specific information is measured. The relative 
stability of different classes of HVC excitatory neurons (HVC_RA, HVC_X and HVC_Av) 
remain to be examined since our methods could not distinguish among the three cell types. 
In the songbird, stable patterned inhibition may be an important force in maintaining the 
dynamical pattern of song in spite of underlying drift in the projection neurons. For

 mammals, similar principles may apply. Aspects of the song cortico-thalamic loop resemble 
features of mammalian motor cortex, including an important 30 Hz rhythm 16,36,37 and 
spatial correlations in neuron firing patterns over 100 µm length scales 38–40. In mammalian 
motor cortex, it will be interesting to track drift in excitatory versus inhibitory neuron 
populations to see if patterned inhibition may provide a stabilizing force in motor skill 
persistence.
Finally, we address the importance of sleep in the rearrangement of the song code in HVC. 
The change in the song motor pattern occurs primarily over intervals of sleep, and we have 
shown that adult song behavior also undergoes microscopic shifts in sleep. Our results may 
be related to a previous observation: as juveniles learn to sing, their songs progress through a 
day of practice 41, but degrade slightly over intervals of sleep 42. The depth of this overnight 
“backsliding” is positively correlated with the eventual success of song learning–indicating 
that nighttime song rearrangements are important for learning. In addition, if song-aligned 
HVC activity is disrupted through lesioning Nif, an area upstream of HVC, the pattern 
recovers primarily overnight 20.
The present study provides a possible neural mechanism for these sleep effects, raising the 
possibility that new patterns of activity “invented” over intervals of sleep provide important 
raw material for song learning and maintenance. Francis Crick proposed that noisy 
reactivation of neural circuits in sleep weakens the strongest pathways in the brain, 
promoting adaptive plasticity 43. It is thought that in sleep, songbirds reactivate their song 
patterns in the motor region RA in a noisy or incomplete manner 44 and it is possible that 
this spontaneous activity drives the overnight shift in HVC excitatory neurons observed here. 
Future studies can track the firing patterns of excitatory neurons in HVC while silencing or 
over stimulating spontaneous activity in sleep, directly testing the hypothesis that noisy 
replay of song in sleep promotes adaptive plasticity of the song motor program. It also 
remains to be seen whether the overnight shift in HVC is random, or guided by vocal errors. 
Random shifts in the population could increase robustness of HVC dynamics by enforcing 
redundant representations of song. In contrast, shifts in the population that are influenced by 
vocal performance errors could be an active part of song learning and maintenance.
Methods
Subjects
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
Boston University (protocol numbers 14-028 and 14-029). Electrophysiology data were 
collected from n=27 adult male zebra finches (>120 DPH), and imaging data were collected 
from n=4 adult male zebra finches. Birds were individually housed for the entire duration of 
the experiment and kept on a 14 h light-dark cycle. The birds were not used in any other 
experiments.
Splaying microfiber electrodes
We used a previously-described minimally invasive carbon fiber electrode array 15 in 
addition to commercially available arrays (TDT, Neuronexus) to chronically monitor both

 single units and LFPs. Extracellular voltages were amplified and digitized at either 25 or 30 
Khz using the Intan acquisition system (RHA2000 and RHD2000).
Microfiber electrodes for multi-unit recordings
Bare (i.e. uncoated) microthread electrodes were prepared by extracting 5 and 11 µm 
diameter fibers from commercially available spools of carbon fiber (grade XAS, HTA, T300 
or P25). Once extracted, sizing and other impurities were removed by heating fibers as 
previously described 15. The bare fibers were then attached to coated silver wire using a 
conductive silver paint (842-20G, MG Chemicals). Signals were sent from a custom 
headstage to a differential amplifier (AM Systems 1700, gain of 1000, low cut-off 300 Hz, 
high cut-off 5 kHz), and digitized with a National Instruments Acquisition board (PCIE 
6323, 40 kHz sampling rate).
Tracheosyringeal nerve cut
The right TS nerve was removed using previously described methods 27. Briefly, birds were 
anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and maintained at 1–2% for the course of the surgery. 
Feathers were removed from the neck, and an incision was made over the trachea. The nerve 
was dissected from the surrounding tissue and the nerve was pulled from its roots on the 
syrinx, extracting a minimum of 1 cm of nerve length.
Calcium imaging
To image calcium activity in HVC projection neurons during singing, we employed head-
mounted fluorescence microscopes–both commercial and custom built. This method 
provides long-term recordings of calcium signals in HVC 16, and enables studies of motor 
stability and adaptive plasticity at the single neuron level. For viral delivery, we use the 
genetically encoded calcium indicators GCaMP6s (2 birds) and GCaMP6f (2 birds) 
delivered by lentiviruses 16,45.
For 1 bird, we used a commercial microscope (Inscopix) to gather female-directed singing 
over 5 day periods. However, these microscopes could not be used with a rotary commutator 
and were too heavy to evoke reliable undirected or solo song. Motivated by these challenges, 
we developed a light-weight (1.7g), commutable, 3D printed single-photon fluorescent 
microscope that simultaneously records audio and video Fig. 4, Supplementary Figure 4 
(n=3 birds). These microscopes enabled recording of hundreds of songs per day (all birds 
sang at least 500 songs on at least one day of recording), and all songs were recorded from 
birds longitudinally in their home cage, without requiring adjustment or removal of the 
microscope during the imaging period. Birds were imaged for less than 20 minutes total on 
each imaging day, and LED activation and video acquisition were triggered on song using 
previous described methods. All analysis was restricted to a particular bout in song, either 
the first (1 bird) or the second (3 birds). Recordings were taken from 3 weeks to 3 months 
post-injection.
Microscope design
The custom microscope is similar to a previously described design 3 (Fig. 4, Supplementary 
Figure 4). A blue LED produces excitation light (470nm peak, LUXEON Rebel). A drum

 lens collects the LED emission, which passes through a 4 mm × 4 mm excitation filter, 
deflects off a dichroic mirror and enters the imaging pathway via a 0.25 pitch gradient 
refractive index (GRIN) objective lens. Fluorescence from the sample returns through the 
objective, the dichroic, an emission filter and an achromatic doublet lens that focuses the 
image onto an analog CMOS sensor with 640 × 480 pixels mounted on a PCB that also 
integrates a microphone. The frame rate of the camera is 30 Hz, and the field of view is 
approximately 800 µm × 600 µm. The housing is made of 3D printed material (Formlabs, 
Black resin). A total of 5 electrical wires run out from the camera—one wire each for 
camera power, ground, audio, NTSC analog video, and LED power. These wires run through 
a custom flex-PCB interconnect (Rigiflex) up to a custom-built active commutator, based on 
previously described designs 46. The NTSC video signal and analog audio are digitized 
through a USB frame-grabber. Custom software written in the Swift programming language 
running on the Mac OS X operating system (version 10.10) leverages native AVFoundation 
frameworks to communicate with the USB frame-grabber and capture the synchronized 
audio-video stream. Video and audio are written to disk in MPEG-4 container files with 
video encoded at full resolution using either H.264 or lossless MJPEG Open DML codecs 
and audio encoded using the AAC codec with a 48 kHz sampling rate. In addition, the 
software communicates with a microcontroller via a USB-to-serial connection to manipulate 
LED intensity, and samples a trigger signal from a DSP performing song detection (TDT 
RX8), in order to selectively record during singing.
Virus Information
Addgene plasmids # 40753 (pGP-CMV-GCaMP6s) and # 40755 (pGP-CMV-GCaMP6f) 
(gift of the Douglas Kim Laboratory) were transformed into E.Coli bacteria by heat shock, 
and sequenced. The GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f fragments were PCR amplified with the 
addition of NotI/BamH1 to the 5' and 3' ends respectively. GCaMP6s was cloned into the 
pHAGE-CMV-eGFP vector to form pHAGE-CMV-GCaMP6s. The RSV promoter sequence 
was ordered from IDT as a gblock with the addition of SpeI/NotI to the 5' and 3' ends 
respectively and was cloned into pHAGE-CMV-GCaMP6s and pHAGE-CMV-eGFP to form 
pHAGE-RSV-GCaMP6s and pHAGE-RSV-eGFP. GCaMP6f was then cloned into pHAGE-
RSV-GCaMP6s to form pHAGE-RSV-GCaMP6f. The viruses were packaged in HEK 293T 
cells and titered on FG293 cells, with titers ranging between 1.2–2.3 × 10^10 infectious 
particles/mL. Plasmid maps and sequences of all lentiviral vectors employed can be

The tropism of our virus for excitatory neurons was evaluated by counterstaining using 
known markers of inhibitory neurons, specifically Anti-Parvalbumin (Abcam Ab11427), 
Anti-Caretinin (SWANT 7697), and Anti-Calbindin (SWANT CB-300). All observable 
GCaMP6 labeled dendrites contained spines, consistent with the morphology of HVC_RA 
and HVC_X projection neurons. Out of 1000 counted neurons, only 1 was double-labeled 
with inhibitory markers. Confocal imaging of GFP-positive cells revealed that in all cases 
where dendrites were visible they contained spines, consistent with the known morphology 
of HVCRA and HVCX projection neurons. The morphology of all GFP-positive cells was

 consistent with previous descriptions of projection neurons in HVC, but not consistent with 
either glial cells or inhibitory neurons. Our histology also revealed dense axon arbors in 
nucleus RA, and Area X, indicating that a significant number of HVCRA and HVCX neurons 
were labelled (Supplementary Figure 3). The combined weight of these observations 
suggests that lenti-RSV overwhelmingly labels projection neurons in HVC. However, it 
remains unclear if the excitatory neuron tropism results from the RSV promoter, or if it is a 
general tropism of the lentivirus construct itself, or a combination of both.
Data Analysis
Song alignments—Songs were aligned using the Euclidean distance in spectral features 
between the data and a template song in a sliding window. Local minima in the Euclidean 
distance were considered candidates hits, which were then plotted in 2 dimensions for the 
user to perform a cluster cut. No time warping was applied to any data. These methods have 
been described in more detail previously 47.
Spectral density images—To plot the variability of multiple song renditions in time and 
frequency we used the spectral density image, which has been described previously 16,48. A 
sparse binary time-frequency representation was generated using auditory contours 49,50. 
These time-frequency binary images were combined by averaging across all renditions. In 
the resulting image, the value at each pixel is the probability that a time-frequency contour 
passes through it.
Acoustic change post-nerve cut—To analyze the change in song post-TS nerve cut, 
we computed amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), Wiener entropy, 
amplitude envelope, pitch and pitch goodness using Sound Analysis Pro for MATLAB 51. 
We then computed the average or variance of each feature across the entire song and 
compared the last day of singing pre-cut with the first day of singing post-cut.
Acoustic change overnight—To quantify changes in song microstructure we used the 
similarity score derived from the spectral density image, which has been described 
previously 48. For 5 consecutive days of singing from n=10 birds, we divided each day’s 
worth of singing in half by trial number. To compute the change in song microstructure 
across the day, we computed the similarity scores between trials from the first half of the day 
and the spectral density image from the second half of the day. Then, to analyze the 
overnight change we computed similarity scores between trials from the first half of each 
day and the spectral density image from the previous evening. Finally the scores were 
averaged for each day prior to statistical comparison. Next, to estimate the change in song 
consistency over the course of the day (Fig. 6d), we computed the spectral density image for 
each hour’s worth of singing. Then, similarity scores were calculated for each trial and the 
corresponding spectral density image. Values were averaged in 1 hour time bins. Trends 
were estimated by taking the Spearman rank correlation between similarity score and the 
time of day.
Local field potentials and single units—Local field potentials (LFPs) were analyzed 
as described previously 16. Extracellular voltage traces were median filtered (1 ms window)

 to remove spikes and then lowpass filtered with 400 Hz corner frequency (4th order 
Butterworth filter) and downsampled to 1 kHz. Finally, the LFP was filtered with a 25–35 
Hz bandpass (8th order Elliptic filter for Fig. 1; 53 tap Kaiser window FIR filter, 20 dB 
stopband attenuation, .05 ripple for all analysis to minimize the impulse response). To 
compute the change in phase angle, we used the angle of the Hilbert-transformed 
narrowband LFP.
Single interneurons were analyzed as described previously 16. Extracellular voltage traces 
were band-pass filtered from 600-11 kHz (12th order Elliptic filter, .2 dB passband ripple, 
40 dB stopband attenuation) and sorted using standard offline spike sorting techniques 52,53.
Multi-unit electrophysiology—First, threshold crossings were taken from extracellular 
traces digitized at 40 kHz using a threshold of 2.5 robust standard deviations 54. Threshold 
crossing were then converted into firing rates on a single-trial basis by convolving with a 
Gaussian kernel (5 ms sigma). Alternatively, the root-mean-square (RMS) of the voltage 
signal was calculated in a 5 ms sliding window (box car). To estimate the stability of multi-
unit activity, we averaged either the song-aligned firing rate or RMS across all trials in a 
given day. Then, the Pearson correlation coefficient was computed between the averages 
from either the first day of recording (or the last day pre-TS cut) and each subsequent day 
(Fig. 2i–j). To compare the drift post-TS cut to the baseline condition, correlation values 
were binned in a 16 day sliding window (5 day overlap, the result was insensitive to binning 
parameters, data not shown), and a bootstrap test was performed between the binned pre- 
and post-nerve cut correlation values (Fig. 3e–f). That is, binned post-nerve cut values were 
compared with 1,000 bootstrap estimates of the corresponding pre-nerve cut correlation 
values. Exact p-values were (from smallest to largest, both spikes and RMS), p=.075, .11, .
22, .42, .58, .74, all others p=1.
Calcium imaging—Time plots used in Fig. 5a were created by averaging all song-aligned 
calcium imaging movies for a bird within a single day. The resulting ‘average' movie was 
smoothed with a 15 µm gaussian filter, and each pixel was then colored by its center of mass 
in time. To create presence or absence images used in Fig. 5c, Maximum projection images 
were created for all song-aligned calcium imaging movies, and the average pixel intensity of 
these maximum projections was taken for each day of imaging. Each day is mapped to the 
red, green, or blue. For Supplementary Figure 7c, each maximum projection image is 
divided by a smoothed version of the same image, using a 100 µm pixel disk filter, to 
normalize across bright and dim ROIs.
Region Of Interest (ROI) based analysis was performed as described previously 16. In brief, 
raw imaging data was motion corrected using a previously published algorithm 55. ROIs 
were manually selected and pixels were averaged for each frame within each ROI. ROI 
traces were converted to ΔF/F_0 by estimating F_0 as the 12th percentile in an 800 ms 
sliding window. Drift was assessed by computing the Pearson correlation between trial-
averaged calcium traces for each ROI at all possible lags. Correlation values from the same 
lag (e.g. between Day 1 and 2, Day 2 and 3) were averaged for each ROI (a similar 
procedure was used for the multi-unit data comparison in Fig. 6b). To account for any 
uncertainty in the alignments due to the 30 Hz sampling rate of the camera, we then

 computed the maximum Pearson correlation in a 100 ms window. Drift was then quantified 
using a randomization permutation test with a p=.01 threshold. Specifically, we compared 
the correlations observed at each lag (1–4 days) with correlations from the same data with 
the group (i.e. day) labels scrambled. P-values were determined by estimating the 
probability that the observed correlation was greater than or equal to the correlation values 
from over 10,000 randomizations. We also repeated this analysis using the timing of peak 
ΔF/F_0 on each day (not shown). Specifically, for each ROI the time of peak trial-averaged 
ΔF/F_0 was computed on each day, and the peak times were compared between each day of 
imaging and the first. For each cell, if the peak timing changed by more than 100 ms or there 
were no peaks greater than .5% ΔF/F_0, the cell was considered unstable.
In order to compare within-day to overnight changes in correlations, we split the data on 
each day in halves by trial number. The within-day correlations were measured by 
computing the correlations between trial-averages using the first and second half of trials 
from a given day. The overnight correlations were measured by computing the correlations 
between trial-averages from the second half of one day with the first half of the subsequent 
day. The within-day and overnight correlations were averaged across days for each ROI, and 
subsequently a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the two groups of correlation 
values. For visualization (Fig. 6c) the two populations were Z-scored using a bootstrap.
To test for significant interactions between time of day and the consistency of calcium 
activity, we first computed the amplitude of peak ΔF/F_0 across the entire song for each ROI 
(this controlled for any change in song duration across the day). Next, we computed the 
standard deviation of the peak ΔF/F_0 in 1 hour bins and computed the Spearman rank 
correlation between these values and time of day. To account for changes in peak ΔF/F_0 
due to photobleaching, we computed the partial rank correlation between the time of day and 
standard deviation of the peak ΔF/F_0 after accounting for the correlation between time of 
day and mean of the peak ΔF/F_0 (again using 1 hour bins). Then, to analyze the similarity 
of calcium activity to the previous day’s average, we peak-normalized the ΔF/F_0 values for 
each trial through dividing by the median peak ΔF/F_0 determined using the 5 nearest trials 
(with respect to time of day). Then, we estimated the similarity between each trial and the 
previous day’s average using the peak Pearson correlation coefficient (also over a 100 ms 
window). Finally, we computed the Spearman rank correlation between these similarity 
values and time of day.
Controls for stability of the imaging plane and photobleaching—Across days, 
ROIs were manually inspected and adjusted to insure that the center of mass for each ROI 
was at the center of the ROI mask, and that the mask did not overlap with neighboring cells. 
Masks that were moved more than the diameter of the mask at any point of the longitudinal 
study were excluded from analysis. To ensure that our results were not impacted by the 
stability of the imaging plane, we then checked to see if there were any differences in the 
spatial profile of stable and unstable ROIs. More precisely, we computed the ΔF/F_0-
weighted centroid within each ROI for each day. Then, we took the Euclidean distance 
between the ΔF/F_0-weighted centroids for each ROI across adjacent days of imaging. 
Lastly, the distances for unstable and stable ROIs (determined using the permutation test 
described above) were compared on each day of imaging (e.g. the same ROI imaged on 4

 days there would be 3 distances measured from day to day) and we found no significant 
effect (ROIspresent some days p=.17 z=.97 n=164 and n=620 comparisons made for stable and 
unstable, respectively, ROIspresent all days p=.99 z=−4.86 n=84 and n=180 comparisons for 
stable and unstable, respectively; one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This indicates that 
micro-motion of cells in the imaging plane does not correlate with their shift in firing 
patterns. Moreover, to control for any effects of bleaching in our time of day analysis we 
repeated the analysis of calcium activity consistency using the Spearman rank partial 
correlation accounting for correlation between time of day and average peak ΔF/F_0. A 
significant effect was still observed (ROIspresent some days r=.12 p=7.8e-7 n=1769, 
ROIspresent all days r=.17 p=2.8e-6, n=708).
Statistical analysis—No formal methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, the 
sample sizes used here are similar to those used in the field. No randomization of 
experimental sessions was performed, and no blinding to experiment condition was 
performed during the analysis. All statistical comparisons were performed using non-
parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum, Wilcoxon signed-rank, bootstrap, or randomization 
tests). Where appropriate, we controlled for multiple comparisons using the Holm-
Bonferroni step-down procedure.

 Figure 5. Projection neurons drift over a five day imaging session
A, Images colored by the timing of max pixel intensity, for two birds, across 5 (top, 
commercial microscope) and 4 (bottom, custom microscope) day intervals (imaging 
performed in n=4 birds). B, Trial-averaged activity from all song related neurons from one 
animal. Keeping the same sorting and amplitude color scale, the ROIs are plotted for 5 
consecutive days. C, For the same animals shown in A, cells active on three consecutive 
days are combined in a single image where color now indicates neuron participation rather 
than timing. (red=day 1, blue=day 2, and green=day 3). Cells with persistent activity on all 3 
days appear white in this representation (see Supplementary Figure 5). Cells that change 
amplitude or change firing probability appear colored. D. Electrophysiological recording of 
a projection neuron reveals a new song-locked burst that emerges over the course of a day. 
Blue triangles indicate trials plotted at the bottom of the figure.

 Figure 6. Projection neuron activity preferentially changes over periods of sleep
A, Average correlation across all ROIs across different lags for each bird. Shaded region 
indicates 99% bootstrap confidence interval (ROIspresent some days). B, Top, All correlations 
up to a lag of 4 days for multi-unit activity (n=20 birds, one sample per bird) and projection 
neuron activity (ROIspresent some days, p=2.7e-6, z=4.70, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, 
n=234 ROIs from n=4 birds). Highlighted in red are cells that participate unambiguously 
across the entire time series (ROIspresent all days,, p=9.8e-4, z=3.30 one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-
sum test, n=77 ROIs from n=4 birds). Bottom, Cumulative density functions (CDF) of the 
data shown above: multiunit data in gray, projection neurons seen across all days in red, and 
seen clearly on any day are blue. C, The shift in correlation occurs primarily overnight (***, 
ROIspresent some days p=2.0e-40, z=−13.26, ROIspresent all days p=1.6e-14, z=−7.59, Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test; shown are data from ROIspresent all days). D, Song consistency increases 
over the course of the day (r=.28, p=6.6e-8, Spearman rank correlation, n=372 values from 
n=10 birds, see Methods). E. Consistency in the timing of peak ΔF/F_0 (measured over the 
whole song) increases with time of day (ROIspresent some days r=.14 p=6.1e-9 n=1769 values, 
ROIspresent all days r=.18 p=9.7e-7 n=708 values, Spearman rank correlation, see Methods; 
shown are data from ROIspresent all days). F. The trial by trial correlation between calcium 
activity and the previous day’s average also increases with time of day (ROIspresent some days

 r=.12 p=5.6e-3 n=529 values, ROIspresent all days r=.25 p=4.3e-9 540 values, Spearman rank 
correlation; shown are data from ROIspresent all days). All time of day measurements in E and 
F use only data our custom microscopes detailed in Fig. 4 (n=3 birds, n=153, 
ROIspresent some days, n=56 ROIspresent all days). For all linear regressions shown (red lines in 
D–F), shading indicates 99% confidence interval of the fitted values,
