Background: Although the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on mortality are well 
established, these effects may vary based on contextual factors such as race and place. 
Using 25-year follow-up data of a nationally representative sample of adults in the U.S., 
this study had two aims: (1) to explore separate, additive, and multiplicative effects of 
race and place (urbanity) on mortality and (2) to test the effects of education and income 
on all-cause mortality based on race and place.
Methods: The Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) Study followed Whites and Blacks 
25 years and older from 1986 until 2011. The focal predictors were baseline SES (edu-
cation and income) collected in 1986. The main outcome was time until death due to all 
causes from 1986 until 2011. Age, gender, behaviors (smoking and exercise), and health 
(chronic medical conditions, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms) at baseline 
were potential confounders. A series of survey Cox proportional hazard models were 
used to test protective effects of education and income on mortality based on race and 
urbanity.
results: Race and place had separate but not additive or multiplicative effects on 
mortality. Higher education and income were protective against all-cause mortality in the 
pooled sample. Race and urbanity significantly interacted with baseline education but 
not income on all-cause mortality, suggesting that the protective effect of education but 
not income depend on race and place. While the protective effect of education were fully 
explained by baseline health status, the effect of income remained significant beyond 
health.
conclusion: In the U.S., the health return associated with education depends on race 
and place. This finding suggests that populations differently benefit from SES resources, 
particularly education. Differential effect of education on employment and health care 
may explain the different protective effect of education based on race and place. Findings 
support the “diminishing returns” hypothesis for Blacks.

The protective effects of socioeconomic status (SES; e.g., educa-
tion and income) on health are consistently shown (1). Mirowsky 
and Ross described the effect of SES on health as “enduring, con-
sistent, and growing” (2). State-of-the-art longitudinal studies, 
such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (3), Americans’ 
Changing Lives (ACL) Study (4), Panel Study of Income Dynamics 
(5), British Cohort Study (BCS) (6), the British Whitehall Study 
(7), French GAZEL cohort (7), and Survey of Health, Aging and 
Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (8), have all shown that higher 
levels of education and income are associated with lower levels 
of morbidity (4) and mortality (9). Higher education and income 
enable individuals to avoid risks and minimize negative conse-
quences as they occur (10, 11).
In the U.S., the education system and job market are both seg-
regated by race, place, and social class (12, 13). As a result, even if 
they not drop out of school, Blacks do not have the same chance 
of receiving high-quality education (14, 15) or high-paying jobs 
(16, 17) as Whites. Thus, instead of having similar health effects 
across race, place, and social class (18), education and income 
may have differential protective effects across sub-populations 
(19, 20). If the school system is less resourced where Blacks live, 
the same education degree may have smaller effects on human 
capital for Blacks compared to Whites (14, 15). In addition, race 
also alters the effect of educational credentials on health through 
labor market advantages for Whites (21). However, it is still 
unknown if health gains associated with education and income 
depend on race and place (22–24).
Our knowledge of the effect of place on health is mostly 
limited only to the direct effect (25, 26). Research has shown 
that place influences health beyond individual-level factors (27) 
by conferring additional risk beyond individual SES status (28). 
Sastry argues that although SES partly explains why place (rural 
versus urban) causes disparities in health, interactions between 
SES and place also exist (29). As the neighborhood effects lit-
erature has mostly focused on the main effect of place on health 
(30), a question yet to be answered is whether place also alters the 
effects of SES resources on health. We still do not know whether 
protective effects of SES on health depend on place (31, 32). 
This research conceptualizes place as a moderator (33), which 
requires testing statistical interaction between place and social 
class (28). Very few studies have tested if the effects of race and 
place on disparities are independent, additive, sub-additive, or 
synergistic (34, 35).
This study investigated separate, additive, and multiplicative 
effects of race, place, and SES (education and income) on mortal-
ity. We were particularly interested in the moderating effects of 
race and place on the protective effects of baseline education and 
income (in 1986) on all-cause mortality during a 25-year follow-
up in the U.S. We had three specific hypotheses: first, race and 
place would have separate, additive, and multiplicative effects on 
mortality. Second, the effects of education and income on mortal-
ity would be weaker for Blacks compared to Whites. Third, we 
expect urbanity to modify the effect of education and income on 
all-cause mortality. To provide generalizable results to the U.S., 
we used a nationally representative sample of American adults.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
The ACL is a 25-year cohort study conducted from 1986 to 
2011. The ACL study is the oldest ongoing longitudinal study 
with a nationally representative sample. The aim of the study is 
to investigate the role of a broad range of social, environmental, 
psychological, and behavioral factors (along with medical care) 
in health changes with age over the life course. The study began 
in 1986 with a national face-to-face survey of 3,617 adults ages 25 
and up in the continental U.S. (36–41).
Participants
The ACL has enrolled a nationally representative sample of 
non-institutionalized U.S. adults (n = 3,617) aged 25 and older 
in 1986 (household response rate = 70%, individual response 
rate = 68%). Both individuals over 60 years of age and Blacks were 
oversampled (36–41). (Analytical sample = 3,361, composed of 
2,205 Whites and 1,156 Blacks).
Process
Although four follow-up interviews were conducted with 
respondents, our analysis is restricted to baseline data and survival 
follow-up, neither of which depended on successful follow-up of 
respondents to the survey.
Measures
Demographic and SES characteristics were obtained from wave 1 
interviews. Demographic covariates included gender (0 = male, 
1 = female), race (0 = White, 1 = Black), and age in years (a 
continuous variable).
race
Participant’s race was defined based on self-reported race and 
ethnicity, collected at baseline in 1986 with several survey items. 
Respondents gave an open-ended response to the question, “In 
addition to being American, what do you think of as your ethnic 
background or origins?” Respondents were then asked a multiple-
choice question, “Are you white, black, American Indian, Asian, 
or another race?” and allowed to answer with multiple categories. 
Those who responded with more than one non-white group were 
asked to identify which “best described” their race. The survey 
also assessed the state or foreign country in which the respond-
ent, respondent’s mother, and respondent’s father were born, and 
the respondent’s father’s last name. Finally, participants were 
asked “Are you of Spanish or Hispanic descent, that is, Mexican, 
Mexican–American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Other 
Spanish?” Responses from the above questions were used to con-
struct race categories of “Non-Hispanic White,” “Non-Hispanic 
Black,” “Non-Hispanic Native American,” “Non-Hispanic Asian,” 
and “Hispanic.” This study’s analysis only included Non-Hispanic 
White and Non-Hispanic Black respondents (38–41).
Urbanity
We collected information on urbanity at an individual level. We 
defined urbanity as a three-level categorical variable. Multiple 
items were used to define urbanity in this study. Categories 
included (1) inner cities (urban areas), defined as the centers (large

or small) of cities, which are classified as metropolitan statistical 
areas greater than or equal to 50,000 people; (2) suburban areas, 
defined as suburbs to large or small central cities, and (3) rural 
areas, defined as other adjacent and outlying areas. Our urban-
ity measure is comparable with the Rural-Urban Continuum 
Codes, developed by the USDA Economic Research Service 
(42). This system distinguishes metropolitan (metro) counties by 
the population size of their metro area, and non-metropolitan 
(non-metro) counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to 
a metro area or areas (42). These categories have major implica-
tions for capturing access to health-care services (43).
education
Education, measured in 1986 as years of completed education, 
was the first SES predictor of interest. Due to low frequency of 
tertiary education among Blacks in 1986, we operationalized 
education in two ways: a continuous measure, reflecting years 
of education, and a three-level categorical variable (<12 years, 
12 years, and >12 years). Other studies have operationalized 
education similarly (44–47).
income
We measured baseline income (respondent and spouse total 
income) in 1986 as our second SES predictor of interest.
chronic Medical conditions
Number of chronic medical conditions (CMC) was measured 
using self-report data at baseline (1986). All participants were 
asked whether a health-care provider had ever told them they 
had any of the following seven focal conditions: hypertension, 
diabetes, chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke, cancer, 
and arthritis. A sum score was calculated, ranging from 0 to 7. 
A detailed description on the measurement of CMC is provided 
elsewhere in House and colleagues (37).
self-rated health
Respondents were asked to rate their self-rated health (SRH) as 
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. The literature has treated 
the SRH in three distinct ways, namely as a dichotomous variable, 
a nominal variable, and a continuous score (48–51). We treated 
SRH as a dichotomous variable. We collapsed it into two catego-
ries (fair/poor vs. excellent/very good/good), a cutoff point that 
is common in the literature (38).
Depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms were measured with an 11-item version of 
the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-
D) (52). CES-D items measure the extent to which respondents 
felt depressed, happy, lonely, sad, that everything was an effort, 
that their sleep was restless, that people were unfriendly, that they 
did not feel like eating, that people dislike them, that they could 
not get going, and that they enjoyed life. Positively worded items 
were reverse coded. This abbreviated CES-D scale has shown 
acceptable reliability and a similar factor structure compared to 
the original version (53–55). Possible item responses were scored 
1 (never or hardly ever) to 3 (most of the time). We used an aver-
age score of depressive symptoms, conceptualized as a continu-
ous measure with a potential range from 1 to 3. Higher scores 
indicated greater severity of depressive symptoms (39–41).
exercise
A physical activity index was derived from answers to survey 
questions regarding engagement in exercise, active sports, gar-
dening/yard work, household chores, and walking. Higher scores 
on this index were indicative of more exercise frequency (36, 56).
smoking
Information was collected on self-reported history of smoking. 
We used a dichotomous variable (current smoker = 1, never or 
ex-smoker = 0).
all-cause Mortality
The main outcome variables were mortality from all causes, 
internal causes, and external causes. Information on all deaths 
from mid-1986 through 2011 was obtained through the National 
Death Index (NDI), death certificates, and also from inform-
ants. In most cases, time and cause of death were verified with 
death certificates. The handful of cases where death could not be 
verified with death certificates were reviewed carefully, and actual 
death was certain in all cases. Only in these cases, lacking death 
certificates was the date of death ascertained from the informants 
or the NDI report (39–41, 57, 58).
statistical analysis
Due to the complex sample design used in the ACL, Stata 13.0 
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for data analy-
sis. Application of baseline weights provides rates and results 
that are generalizable to the US population in 1986. Taylor series 
linearization was used for estimation of SEs.
We estimated seven Cox proportional hazard models to 
determine the effects of education and income on mortality. 
Baseline SES (education and income) collected in 1986 was the 
focal predictor, time to death through 2011 from all causes was 
the main outcome, and age, gender, and health (CMC, SRH, 
and depressive symptoms) were confounders. Hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals are reported. A HR of <1 
indicates a protective effect of the independent variable on the 
outcome. Because we consider multiple outcomes, we set p < 0.01 
as the level of statistical significance. For comparability, all main 
effects and interaction terms were left in models if they were not 
significant.
Model 1 estimated age- and gender-adjusted effect of race. 
Model 2 tested age- and gender-adjusted effects of place. Model 3 
estimated additive (combined) effects of race and place. Model 4 
also controlled for SES, to test if education and income explain 
the effect of race and place on mortality. Model 5 also controls for 
health, in addition to SES. Models 3–5 also included interactions 
between race and place to test multiplicative effects of race and 
place. Model 6 and Model 7 included interaction terms between 
race and place with education and income. While Model 6 did 
not include health status, Model 7 controlled for baseline health.

resUlTs
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the analytic sample 
overall and by race. While there were no race differences in age 
or gender (p > 0.05 for both comparisons), average education 
(12.69 years for Whites and 11.37 years for Blacks, p < 0.001) 
and income (USD 5,570 for Whites and USD 4,250 for Blacks, 
p < 0.001) were lower for Blacks than Whites. Mortality was 
higher among Blacks (39.41%) compared to Whites (35.66%) 
(p < 0.05).
Table 2 reports results of five Cox proportional hazard models 
in the pooled sample. Model 1 reports the age- and gender-adjusted 
effect of race. Based on this model, race had a significant age- and 
gender-adjusted effect on mortality (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.25–
1.62). Model 2 reports age- and gender-adjusted effects of place. 
Based on Model 2, place also had a separate effect on mortality 
risk. Based on this model, compared to residing in the inner city, 
living in suburban areas (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.70–1.03) was 
marginally associated with lower mortality risk, while residence 
in rural areas (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65–0.98) was significantly 
associated with lower mortality risk. Model 3 reports the additive 
effects of race and place. Based on this model, the effect of place 
on mortality did not remain above and beyond race (p > 0.05 for 
both living in suburban and rural areas). Model 4 also controls 
for SES and shows that education and income explain the effect 
of race on mortality. In this model, education (HR = 0.80, 95% 
CI = 0.71–0.91) and income (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.89–0.94) 
were protective against mortality. Model 5 also controls for health, 
as well as SES. Based on this model, the effect of education on 
mortality is explained by health (p > 0.05). However, the effect 
of income on mortality stays in the model (HR = 0.94, 95% 
CI = 0.91–0.97). Based on Models 3–5, race and place did not 
have multiplicative effects, as interaction terms between race and 
urbanity were non-significant (p > 0.05 for all interactions terms).
Table 3 also shows two models (Model 6 and Model 7) that 
included interaction terms between race, place, education, and 
income. While Model 6 did not include health status, Model 7 
also controlled for baseline health. Based on Model 6, race moder-
ated the effect of education but not income on mortality. In this 
model, we found a significant interaction term between race and 
education (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.50–0.99). This model also 
showed a marginally significant interaction between place and 
education (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.48–1.04). In Model 7, which 
also controlled for health, the interaction term between race and 
education stayed significant (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50–0.98), 
but the interaction between place and education was explained 
by baseline health status (p > 0.05).
DiscUssiOn
Our study suggests that, in the U.S., the protective effects of 
education but not income on all-cause mortality is moderated 
by race and place. Our findings support the diminishing returns 
hypothesis for Blacks. Based on this hypothesis, as education lev-
els increase, Blacks do not gain as much improvement in health 
as Whites (59–61). This hypothesis also suggests that disparity 
between Blacks and Whites is largest at the highest but not lowest 
SES levels (59). While the effect of race on health varies among 
low versus high SES levels, health effect of SES also depends on 
race (59, 62).
Previous research has suggested that protective effects of SES 
indicators against mortality are not necessarily uniform across 
sub-populations (1, 19, 20, 22, 63). This is possibly because educa-
tion does not similarly improve life circumstances and does not 
similarly reduce exposure to risk and protective factors across 
various social groups (64). We argue that differential access to 
job and health care as well as differential pay based on race and 
place may explain differential survival benefits associated with 
education based on group membership.
Multiple previous studies have shown Black–White differ-
ences in the effect of SES indicators on health. A previous study 
showed a larger protective effect of education against mortality 
due to all causes as well as internal causes for Whites compared 
to Blacks1. In the National Longitudinal Mortality Study from 
1979 to 1998, among non-Hispanic Blacks, there were step 
reductions in mortality at 12 and 16 years of education, with 
constant slopes between the steps. For Whites, each additional 
year of education had a stronger effect on decreasing mortal-
ity, but only among those with at least a high school diploma. 
Whites also showed a step reduction in mortality at 12 years of 
education (65). In another study on mortality data in the 1960s, 
education was linked to a lower risk of mortality for Whites but 
not Blacks (66). Everett and colleagues used the U.S. National 
Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality sample and showed 
that race, gender, and cohort modified the effect of education on 
mortality, documenting significant changes across birth cohorts

in the associations between education and mortality for White 
women and White men, but no such changes across cohorts of 
Black men (67). In a study by Hayward, Hummer, and Sasson, 
Whites showed an effect of education on mortality, but there was 
almost no association for Blacks in that period (66). Backlund 
and colleagues found that, for Blacks, there were step reductions 
in mortality at 12 and 16 years of education, with constant slopes 
between the steps. For Whites, each additional year of education 
had a stronger effect on decreasing mortality for those with a 
high school diploma (65). It has been also shown that education 
differently predicts behaviors (68) as well as CMC among Blacks 
and Whites (69, 70).
The magnitude of the health gain associated with educational 
attainment is conditional on the availability of other resources 
that can be gained or purchased by the income that such educa-
tion generates. Availability of social resources (19, 20, 71), as well 
as purchase power associated with higher SES (67, 70, 72–76), 
are shaped by race, place, SES, and their intersections. SES does 
not independently affect health (in a vacuum), and its impact 
is specific to the context (9, 24, 71–73, 77–81). As Marmot has 
mentioned, it is not just important how many resources people 
have, but also what they can buy with those resources (82).
In line with our findings that the protective effect of educa-
tion on mortality depends on place, Stafford and Marmot found 
that the effect of living in a deprived area was more marked for 
poorer individuals. The study used individual-level data from the 
Whitehall II study covering health, SES, and perceived status and 
census data on neighborhood deprivation. Authors concluded 
that living in a deprived neighborhood may have the most nega-
tive health effects on poorer individuals, possibly because poor 
individuals are more dependent on collective resources in the 
neighborhood (83). Proper and colleagues also found significant 
interactions between neighborhood SES and level of educational 
attainment in the contribution of total and vigorous occupational 
physical activity to total physical activity. Authors concluded that 
neighborhood SES functions as a moderator in the relationship 
between individual SES and occupational physical activity (84). 
Another study showed that death rates among people of low SES 
were highest in high SES neighborhoods, lower in moderate SES 
neighborhoods, and lowest in low SES neighborhoods. The study 
showed that differences were not merely due to individual-level 
risk factors (28).
In the U.S., place strongly influences employment opportuni-
ties, and race impacts employer choices as well as preferences and 
practices of the labor market (16, 17, 85). Structural inequalities 
due to race and place are well documented in the U.S. labor 
market (86). Racial wage inequality (87) and occupational seg-
regation based on race and place (16, 88, 89) are a well-explained

phenomenon in sociology and economics literature. Different 
earnings of Blacks and Whites, particularly for individuals with 
the highest levels of education, are indicative of inequalities in 
how education translates to income and subsequently income to 
health (90). A Black man with a master’s degree in 2006 earned 
$27,000 less than a White man with the same education. On top of 
individual income, due to lower chance of marriage, being Black 
significantly reduces household income and wealth (91). Even 
with the same employment opportunity, pay for an equal job is 
lower for Blacks than for Whites, a phenomenon called Black–
White pay gaps (92). Similar effects can be attributed to place, 
which shapes job opportunities through residential segregation 
as well as job proximity (93). In addition, Blacks attend lower 
quality schools, which cause a differential effect of education on 
employment opportunities (94). All these factors explain the 
differential health gain due to education and income based on 
race and place.
Race, place, and other SES indicators may alter the health gains 
associated with education (22). As explained by David Williams, 
the effects of race and SES are not additive but multiplicative (72). 
That being said, health disparities are the product of complex 
and non-linear interactions between race, place, and SES factors, 
such as education (72). Our findings that race and place interact 
with education but not income suggest that, although race and 
place alter the health gains associated with education, income is 
universally protective, regardless of the context.
The results should be interpreted in the light of at least four 
limitations. First, education and income are both subject to 
change over time; however, we only measured their baseline 
status. Although this is likely a minor issue for education, income 
tends to change more over time. Second, our education measure is 
not on educational credentials but years of education completed. 
These two limitations cause measurement bias and may have 
impacted our magnitude of the association between education, 
income, and mortality. Third, our sample size was not equal based 
on race and place. As a result, statistical power may differ across 
groups. Fourth, due to the different distribution of education 
based on race and place, we could not use multiple education 
cut-offs and, thus, only used high school graduation. Despite the 
above limitations, this study extended the literature by showing 
that race and place alter long-term effects of education but not 
income on mortality in a nationally representative cohort.
To conclude, the protective effects of education but not 
income on mortality in the U.S. depend on race and place (i.e., 
urbanity). The lower health gain of educational attainment for 
Blacks compared to Whites is possibly due to structural racism, 
which even blocks gains associated with education for Blacks. 
Future research should explore mechanisms by which race and 
place alter the effects of health return associated with education 
in the U.S.
