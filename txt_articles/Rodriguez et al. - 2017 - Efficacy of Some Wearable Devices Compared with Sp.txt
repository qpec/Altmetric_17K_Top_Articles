Abstract
The current Zika health crisis in the Americas has created an intense interest in mosquito control methods and
products. Mosquito vectors of Zika are of the genus Aedes, mainly the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. L.
The use of repellents to alter mosquito host seeking behavior is an effective method for the prevention of
mosquito-borne diseases. A large number of different spray-on repellents and wearable repellent devices are
commercially available. The efficacies of many repellents are unknown. This study focuses on the efficacy of
eleven different repellents in reducing the number of Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes attracted to human bait.
We performed attraction-inhibition assays using a taxis cage in a wind tunnel setting. One person was placed
upwind of the taxis cage and the mosquito movement towards or away from the person was recorded. The per-
son was treated with various spray-on repellents or equipped with different mosquito repellent devices. We
found that the spray-on repellents containing N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide and p-menthane-3,8-diol had the
highest efficacy in repelling mosquitoes compared to repellents with other ingredients. From the five wearable
devices that we tested, only the one that releases Metofluthrin significantly reduced the numbers of attracted
mosquitoes. The citronella candle had no effect. We conclude that many of the products that we tested that
were marketed as repellents do not reduce mosquito attraction to humans.

Aedes aegypti is the principal vector for Zika, chikungunya, yellow
fever, and dengue, worldwide and responsible for historic and ongo-
ing outbreaks of these arboviral diseases (Gubler 2004). The geo-
graphical distribution of Ae. aegypti has expanded significantly over
the last two decades (Jansen and Beebe 2010). This species can be
found in many regions across the world, including the Americas.
This species has successfully established populations across the
United States southern border (Jansen and Beebe 2010, Joy et al.
2012). Zika virus is the latest of these arboviruses to invade the
Americas (Fauci and Morens 2016). It has established itself in Brazil
and spread explosively from there (Saiz et al. 2016). In June of
2016, the first autochthonous transmission within the United States
was reported from Miami Dade County in Florida. Zika infection
causes mild symptoms in about 18% of the infected patients, but
has been linked to debilitating developmental defects in infants
(Mlakar et al. 2016, Rubin et al. 2016).
The impending threat of Zika outbreaks in North America has
created a massive public interest in mosquito control products and
there are thousands of products currently commercially available. A
search on www.amazon.com using the keywords “mosquito repel-
lent” gained 13,333 hits on 16 August 2016. Putative repellents and
mosquito control devices are presented to the consumer in several
different ways including: spray-on repellents in pressurized spray
bottles or diffusers, creams, repellent or insecticide-treated clothing,
area repellents like candles and live plants that are rich in essential
oils. There is also an abundance of wearable devices that are avail-
able, including: bracelets, sonic devices, clothing, and skin patches
(Debboun and Strickman 2013).
There have been several studies that have shown an association
between the use of personal protection products and a reduction in
mosquito bites and disease incidence (Debboun and Strickman
2013). For example, permethrin-treated military clothing has shown

 to be effective in significantly reducing mosquito bites in the covered
regions (Schreck and Kline 1989). Application of the repellent
DEET to ankles and feet of the population in an African village sig-
nificantly reduced the incidence of malaria (Durrheim and Govere
2002). Repellent soaps that contain DEET and permethrin have
been shown to successfully reduce malaria infections (Kroeger et al.
1997, Kroeger et. al., 1999). Permethrin treated clothing has also
been shown to reduce malaria incidence (Rowland et al. 1999). A
double blind study concluded that the use of oil of lemon eucalyptus
as repellent helps preventing malaria infections (Hill et al. 2007,
Maia and Moore 2011).
The efficacy of different spray-on repellents on various species of
mosquitoes has been tested in numerous studies (Fradin and Day
2002). We have shown in a previous study using a Y-tube olfactom-
eter that the spray-on repellents DEET and oil of lemon eucalyptus
(active ingredient p-menthane-3,8-diol [PMD]) are effective in repel-
ling Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Rodriguez et al. 2015). The
transdermal Vitamin B1 patch did not show any significant reduc-
tion in attraction as compared to the control. Other wearable de-
vices such as OFF! Clip-on (Johnson & Son, Inc., Racine, WI) and
Terminix ALLCLEAR Sidekick (Universal Pest Solutions, LLC,
Dallas, TX) have been tested and shown to reduce biting pressure in
both Aedes and Culex mosquitoes (Revay et al. 2013). As a general
trend, we could confirm that repellents based on essential oils often
have shorter repellency effects compared with DEET and PMD-
based products (Patel et al. 2012, Rodriguez et al. 2015).
The World Health Organization has several suggestions for test-
ing spatial repellents (WHO 2013).These tests can be conducted in
several environments including: the laboratory, semi-field tests, and
field studies. Some common laboratory tests to determine attraction
and inhibition include: in vitro blood feeding systems like the arm-
in-a-cage test, alternative choice systems like the Y-tube, olfactome-
ter, tests or a taxis cage. Taxis cages can be used in both a lab setting
and in field work (Lorenz et al. 2013).
In this study, we used a taxis cage inside a wind tunnel to evalu-
ate the changes in overall attraction of Ae. aegypti to a human sub-
ject using various repellent products. We tested five spray-on
repellents, five wearable devices, and one candle.
Materials and Methods
Mosquito Culture
Ae. aegypti ROCK strain were attained from the Malaria Research
and Reference Reagent Resource Center (ATCC 2015). Mosquito
rearing procedures described in (Marquardt 2004), were followed
using an artificial blood feeding system. Approximately 500 mos-
quito larvae were reared per 33 � 38 cm plastic developing pan
filled with �2 liters of deionized water. The pans with larvae were
incubated in an insect chamber at 27�C and given dry cat food pel-
lets ad libitum. Pupae were collected in cups and placed into a
BugDorm-1 Insect Rearing Cage (30 � 30 � 30 cm, BugDorm Store,
Taichung, Taiwan). The cage was placed in an insectary that was
maintained at 27�C and 80% humidity. The photoperiod within the
insectary was 14:10 (L:D) h. The adult mosquitoes were given access
to 20% sucrose solution, ad libitum.
Approximately 24 h prior to the experiment, the mosquitoes
were placed outside the insectary to acclimatize to room tempera-
ture and low humidity that exists at the wind tunnel facility. In addi-
tion, the mosquitoes were sugar-starved for 24 h prior to the
experiment, but given deionized water to maintain hydration. The
mosquitoes were not anesthetized prior to the tests. In preliminary
tests, we found that anesthetizing mosquitoes with temperature or
CO2 alters their behavior for several hours. The female Ae. aegypti
mosquitoes used in this experiment were between 1.5 and 2 weeks
old. Mosquitoes were only used one time and then discarded after
each test.
Institutional Review Board Approval
The New Mexico State University Institutional Review Board
approved this study. Title: “Efficacy of different insect repellents”,
study no. 11505A.
Repellents
Repellent devices and sprays were predominantly acquired through
Amazon, some were purchased locally in Las Cruces, NM. Table 1
illustrates all of the details provided by each label, including: active
ingredients, type of repellent, manufacturer, estimated protection
time. The repellents were presented the following way: The sonic
device was attached to the chest of the bait person; for the bracelets,
one was attached to each wrist of the test person; the OFF! Clip-on
device was attached at the leg of the test person; the aerosol sprays
were sprayed on a person for 15 s each side (�5 ml was applied to
each side of the body); the pump sprays were applied 25 sprays per
side (�5 ml were applied to each side of the body); the citronella
candle was placed downwind next to the test person.
Taxis Cage
The taxis cage used in this study is a custom-built alternative choice
system that was built similarly to models in (Lorenz et al. 2013)
with modifications (Fig. 1A). It consists of three interconnected
chambers. The middle chamber is separated from the outer cham-
bers with a funnel made from mosquito screen with an opening of
5 cm diameter in the middle. Access between the cages can be
opened or closed with a Plexiglas barrier that can be moved via a
pulley system. This system allows the segregation of chambers,
which allows for an analysis on the proportion of mosquitoes that
move towards an attractant in a given amount of time.
Wind Tunnel
The experiment was done in the NMSU low-speed wind tunnel
(Fig. 1B). This open return wind tunnel has a test section dimension
of 1.2 m(W) � 1.2 m(H) � 14.6 m(L). Flow is induced with a fan
installed downstream the test section. Flow speed can be continu-
ously set from 0 to 35 m/s. The intake of the wind tunnel is 4 � 4 m
to ensure the turbulence intensity in the test section is <1%. For all
experiments a constant air current of 2 m/s was maintained.
Mosquito Attractants
All experiments were performed using two volunteers that served as
attractants. The volunteers were instructed to not bathe or use per-
sonal hygiene products <15 h prior to the experiment.
Attraction-Inhibition Assays
For the mosquito attraction-inhibition testing, the taxis cage was
placed on a roller board inside the wind tunnel (Fig. 1A). Figure 1C
illustrates the overall experimental design. Approximately 50–125
female mosquitoes were aspirated into a collection vial and immedi-
ately placed in the middle chamber of the taxis cage. The mosquitoes
were allowed to acclimate for 2 min prior to each evaluation. The
subject was sealed in the wind tunnel 1 or 3 m upwind of the taxis
cage. The trap doors of the taxis cage were then opened and the

 mosquitoes were allowed to roam for 15 min. After 15 min, the trap
doors were closed and the mosquitoes were counted based on their
location within the taxis cage. Before every repellent evaluation,
control tests were executed to determine overall attraction the mos-
quitoes had to the volunteers on this particular day. If a minimum
threshold of an 80% attraction rate to the volunteer was not
achieved for the control experiments, the experiments were resched-
uled to another day. The sprays and devices were put on the volun-
teer immediately before the 15-min test. The positive control
consisted of a volunteer without repellents. A negative control was
performed to determine the movement of the mosquitoes without a
volunteer stimulus. The total number of mosquitoes that flew
towards the attractant was used to calculate the total attraction of
mosquitoes after a 15-min period.
Product efficacy was tested at two different distances between
the volunteer and the taxis cage setup, 1 and 3 m. These distances
were arbitrarily chosen in order to detect delusion and homogeniza-
tion effects of the active ingredients released by the devices or sprays
tested.
Two volunteers were used as attractants in this study. Each vol-
unteer was prescreened in preliminary tests to have a >80% attrac-
tion rate in our positive control setup. Each volunteer was tested
twice with each treatment/time point for a total of four replicates.
Each volunteer was subjected to only one treatment each day.
Statistical Methods
To evaluate the efficacy of each repellent, one-way analysis of var-
iance was used. The independent variable was the rank-transformed
ratio of the number of mosquitoes that were moved toward the
attractant versus the total number of mosquitoes in the test.
Results
Controls
Both positive and negative controls were performed to determine
the overall movement of mosquitoes. The negative control consisted
of the taxis cage without the volunteer present. The overall attrac-
tant rate for the negative control at 1 and 3 m were 17.43 6 1.72%
and 13.18 6 2.97%, respectively (Table 2 and 3). The positive con-
trol consisted of the taxis cage with a volunteer less any repellents.
At a distance of 1 and 3 m, the positive control attractant rates were
88.82 6 1.36% and 91.25 6 1.24%, respectively.

 Attraction-Inhibition at a 1-m Distance
Table 1 shows the results of the attraction-inhibition assays performed
at a 1 m distance (�3.3 ft.). From the five wearable devices tested in
this study, only the Off! Clip-on device resulted in a significant
decrease in the number of mosquitoes that moved towards the volun-
teer. The products containing 30% PMD (Oil of lemon eucalyptus) or
98% DEET produced equally strong reductions in attraction. The cit-
ronella candle did not significantly reduce mosquito attraction.
Attraction-Inhibition at a 3-m Distance
We then tested one device and three sprays that had been successful
in the previous experiment at a distance of 3 m. The results of the
experiments when the human attractant was placed 3 m (�9.8 ft)
upwind of the taxis cage are shown in Table 3. With the exception
of the DEET product, the attraction rates increased in all tests.
Supplementary Material 1 [online only] shows the statistical dif-
ferences between all treatments at 1 and 3 m.
Discussion
Adult mosquitoes use their sense of olfaction to locate hosts
(Takken 1991, Zwiebel and Takken, 2004, Galizia and Rossler
2010). Specific chemical cues and odorants produced by the verte-
brate host’s skin or the bacterial community living on it as well as
CO2 and other chemicals exhaled while breathing trigger host-
seeking behavior over longer or shorter ranges (Zwiebel and Takken
2004, Galizia and Rossler 2010). The majority of insect repellents
function by reducing overall attraction of the blood-seeking female
mosquito to the human host.
The recurrent outbreaks of arboviruses like dengue, chikungu-
nya, and lately Zika in Americas has created a large market for a
variety of mosquito repellent and control products (Ioos et al. 2014,
Karwowski et al. 2016). However, it has become apparent that not
all repellents and/or repellent devices actually reduce mosquito
attraction and that in many cases the claims made by the vendors of
these products are exaggerated or simply false (Fradin and Day
2002; Fuss et al. 2007, 2013; Hill et al. 2007; Fuss and Ray 2009;
Rodriguez et al. 2015).

 Wind tunnels have been used to study insect olfactory orienta-
tion behavior towards pheromones, hosts, or other cues (Visser
1976, Miller and Roelofs 1978, Elzen et al. 1986, Tumlinson
et al. 1989). Mosquito host location has been studied using wind
tunnel setups (Gillies 1980, Eiras and Jepson 1991) as well as the
effects of insecticides (Mount et al. 1976). The mosquito taxis
cage/wind tunnel assay we developed for this series of experi-
ments measures the variation in attraction of female mosquitoes
to a host and can be used to test this variation at different distan-
ces. In our opinion, this setup resembles a natural setting better
than the standard “arm-in-cage” test or olfactometers. It is also
superior to field testing because using the wind tunnel allows
standardizing the air flow from the bait person towards the cage
and allows the constant movement of odors and CO2 plumes
from the bait person towards and through the taxis cage. This
setup creates a strong attraction to properly prepared Ae. aegypti
females. On average about 90% of all mosquitoes in our tests
ended up moving towards the bait within 15 min, which is much
higher and faster than the averages measured in a comparable
study with a similar setup with a tunnel minus regulated air flow
(Lorenz et al. 2013).
The
Personal Sonic
Mosquito Repeller (PIC Corporation,
Linden, NJ) we tested had no effect on the overall mosquito attrac-
tion to the human subject. This confirms the results of a previous
study that tested similar devices and found that mosquitoes are
unperturbed by them (Foster and Lutes 1985) as well as a field study
that did not find any significant effect on mosquito landings when
using a sonic device (Revay et al. 2013). Interestingly, one study
reported an increase in Ae. aegypti biting activity when such devices
were switched on (Andrade and Cabrini 2010). We are not aware of
any scientific study showing that mosquitoes can be repelled by
sound waves and therefore we consider these devices as the modern
equivalent of snake oil.
None of the bracelets we tested caused any significant reduction
in mosquito attraction. Although the active ingredients in some bra-
celets may be mosquito repellents, we hypothesize that the concen-
trations that are emitted by all of the bracelets that we tested were
too low to have an effect. Based on our results, we conclude that
these bracelets in general do not offer adequate protection from
mosquito bites.
The only wearable device that reduced mosquito attraction rates
was the OFF! Clip-on Metofluthrin nebulizer. Mosquito attraction
rates were reduced close to that of the negative control. OFF! Clip-
on killed 100% of the mosquitoes in each replicate. In field tests,
this device has been shown to reduce the number of bites that test
persons experienced from Ae. albopictus and Aedes taeniorhynchus
mosquitoes by 70 and 79%, respectively (Xue et al. 2012). Another
field study found similar results (Revay et al. 2013). From all devices
we tested, OFF! Clip-on was the only wearable device that had an
effect in our study.
The results of our study show clearly that DEET and PMD are
very effective mosquito repellents when used in sufficient concentra-
tion, while the other active ingredients had lower efficacy. This find-
ing confirms the findings of several other studies that found DEET
and PMD the most effective and longest lasting mosquito repellents
currently available (Fradin and Day 2002, Carroll and Loye 2006).
The Kids Herbal Armor product, which contains a mixture of essen-
tial oils as active ingredients, performed equally well as a 40%
DEET solution and better than a 10% picaridin solution.
The citronella candle combined with a human subject attracted
slightly more mosquitoes that the human bait person alone;
however, this difference was not statistically significant. We found
no indication that such candles repel Ae. aegypti females.
By moving the taxis cage away from the human subject, we
anticipated to better mix and homogenize attractants released by the
test person with the various repellents we tested. Since the wind tun-
nel is a closed system we don’t expect a large dilution effect between
the two distances we tested. Interestingly, there was an increase in
attraction with all products with the exception of the 98% DEET
solution. We hypothesize that the repellent properties seem to dissi-
pate more with better mixing of these products with the attractants
released by the test person.
We have developed a novel testing setup for mosquito repellents
using a taxis cage within a wind tunnel. This setup allows the control
of a critical variable—wind speed—that cannot be controlled in a field
setting or in many other semi-field test setups. This setup allowed us to
collect highly significant data on the effects of various repellents. Due
to the high reproducibility of our test results, we can detect even
minute repellency effects that cannot be detected in other setups.
We found that a sonic device, three bracelets, and a citronella
candle had no repellency effect on Ae. aegypti females in our test
setup. Also, we found that all the spray-on repellents that we tested
had a repellency effect. It is important to note that even though we
found repellents in our study with significant reductions in attrac-
tion as compared to the control, some of the attraction rates are
rather high. For optimal protection, a consumer should select the
products that have the most significant reduction in attraction. At a
time where vector-borne diseases like Zika is a real threat, the most
egregious danger to the consumer is the false comfort that some
repellents give them protection against Ae. aegypti when they
actually offer none. Even if a product offers a slight reduction in
attraction as compared to the control, there is still a high probability
of mosquito–human interaction; especially in areas with higher pop-
ulations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.
It has to be noted that the series of experiments that we performed
focused on the efficacy of wearable devices and spray-on repellents
against Ae. aegypti females. Further studies are necessary to explore
the efficacy of these interventions on repelling other mosquito species.
