Abstract
Purpose—Adolescent smokers are at increased risk for polydrug use, which is associated with 
more consequences than use of a single drug. Here we classified subgroups of polydrug use among 
urban adolescent cigarette-smokers; described the sociodemographic, smoking, and depression 
correlates; and identified three-year outcomes associated with subgroup membership.
Methods—Adolescent cigarette smokers (N = 176; Mage = 16.1; 35% male; 27% white) 
completed surveys assessing drug use, smoking characteristics, demographics, and depressive 
symptoms at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 months follow-up.
Results—Almost all participants (96%) reported using, on average, two (SD = 0.97) substances 
(including other tobacco products) in addition to cigarettes. Latent class analysis revealed two 
distinct classes of polydrug users. “Limited Range Use” (84%) class members reported current use 
of other tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana, as did “Extended Range Use” class members (16%) who 
also reported current use of “harder drugs” (i.e., cocaine/crack, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and 
misused prescriptions). The classes did not differ on demographics or baseline likelihood of 
marijuana (χ2 = 0.25; p <0.62) or alcohol use (χ2 = 3.3; p <0.07). At baseline, a larger proportion 
of Extended Range Use class members reported both smoking the entire cigarette and symptoms 
of clinical depression. Extended Range Use class membership at baseline predicted higher mean 
depression scores at 24 and 36 months.
Conclusion—Adolescent cigarette-smokers who reported extended range use (18%) also 
reported symptoms of clinical depression at baseline and follow-up. These findings indicate a need 
for early monitoring of depression symptoms and prevention and cessation interventions targeting 
this high-risk group.

1. Introduction
Adolescent cigarette smokers are more likely than their nonsmoking peers to drink alcohol 
and use other drugs, (Chang, Sherritt, & Knight, 2005) and they are more likely to report 
polydrug use (concurrently using two or more substances) (Chen, Unger, Palmer, et al., 
2002; Kandel & Kandel, 2014). Polydrug use in adolescence is common; for example, 41% 
of U.S. 10th graders (μage = 16) reported concurrent use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana 
in 2010 (Conway, Vullo, Nichter, et al., 2013). Polydrug use is associated with worse health 
and social outcomes (Fallu, Brière, & Janosz, 2014; Kelly, Evans-Whipp, Smith, et al., 
2015) compared to single-substance use, including cognitive deficits (Hanson, Medina, 
Padula, et al., 2011) and substance-related legal, relational, and work problems in young 
adulthood (Griffin, Bang, & Botvin, 2010). Moreover, adolescent smokers and polydrug 
users are more likely to report symptoms of depression. Early onset depression is promoted 
by early onset polydrug use, (Felton, Kofler, Lopez, et al., 2015) and is independently 
associated with negative health outcomes (Maslowsky, Schulenberg, O’Malley, et al., 2014).
Negative outcomes from adolescent polydrug use are exacerbated by smoking, which is 
independently associated with increased risk for lifetime nicotine dependence (US 
Department of Health and Human Services, 2012) and substance use disorders, including 
alcohol dependence, in early adulthood (Brook, Brook, Zhang, Cohen, & Whiteman, 2002). 
Use of a single substance (e.g., alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs) anytime during 
childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood predicts major depressive disorder at age 
27, (Brook et al., 2002) and both current and lifetime nicotine dependence are associated 
with persistent depressive symptoms (Hu, Davies, & Kandel, 2006). Each of these outcomes 
is linked to enduring physical, social, and mental health problems, the consequences of 
which are more severe for adolescents who initiate early (Fallu et al., 2014; Taylor, Malone, 
Ianoco, et al., 2002). Hence, it is important to identify dominant patterns of polydrug use 
among adolescent smokers to best inform prevention and cessation interventions in this 
high-risk population.
Typically, studies of polydrug use among adolescents employ variable-centered analysis 
rather than characterizing actual use patterns or risk profiles of individuals. Use patterns and 
risk profiles can be effectively investigated using latent class analysis (LCA), a statistical 
method that identifies subgroups that cannot be directly observed (i.e., “latent”). A recent 
systematic review of studies that identified latent classes of adolescent polydrug use 
(Tomczyk, Isensee, & Hanewinkel, 2016) concluded LCA delivers “solid information” on 
polydrug use during adolescence. Additionally, subgroups that had a higher probability of 
current or more frequent smoking were associated with more intense patterns of drug use 
(including alcohol), (Tomczyk, Hanewinkel, & Isensee, 2015) poorer health, higher levels of 
psychological distress, and risky sexual behavior including a greater number of sexual 
partners (Bohnert, Walton, Resko, et al., 2014; Connell, Gilreath, & Hansen, 2009). LCA

 has also been employed successfully to identify subgroups based on patterns of precursors to 
adolescent substance use relapse (Ramo, Prince, Roesch, et al., 2012) and to model 
adolescent high-risk behavioral outcomes (i.e., cigarette use, marijuana use, violent 
behavior, and delinquent behavior) associated with alcohol use initiation patterns (Komro, 
Tobler, Maldonado-Molina, et al., 2010). Our study is unique in that all participants were 
smokers and most reported households with high maternal educational attainment, which is 
typically associated with lower levels of smoking and drug use (Caldwell, 1994).
We used LCA in data collected from a cohort of urban adolescent smokers and sought to 
classify underlying subgroups of polydrug use and describe smoking and sociodemographic 
correlates of class membership. We then compared classes on drug use prevalence, smoking, 
and depression outcomes at 12, 24, and 36 months follow-up. We hypothesized that distinct 
classes of polydrug use would emerge and that classes characterized by use of a wider 
variety of substances would be associated with heavier cigarette smoking patterns (greater 
quantity and frequency of smoking, greater nicotine dependence, fewer quit attempts, lower 
self-efficacy for quitting or reducing smoking), and more extensive depression 
symptomatology at baseline and all follow-up time points.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Data for this study were derived from a 36 month prospective cohort study conducted at 
University of California San Francisco (UCSF). The study was designed to examine the 
influence of nicotine metabolism rate on smoking trajectory among adolescents. Data 
collection for this study ended in May 2015 and detailed methods have been published 
elsewhere (Rubinstein, Shiffman, Moscicki, et al., 2013). Briefly, 202 adolescent cigarette 
smokers from the San Francisco Bay Area were recruited between December 2009 and June 
2012. Trained study personnel screened interested adolescents (e.g., those who responded to 
study fliers or online advertisements or who were referred by a current study participant) 
over the telephone. Inclusion criteria included age 13–17 years, smoking 1–5 cigarettes per 
day (cpd), and living in or near San Francisco, California.
Of the 202 adolescents enrolled 26 were found to be nonsmokers or to have quit smoking 
prior to enrollment and were excluded from the analyses, resulting in a final sample size of 
N = 176 for this study. Thirty-four participants were also found to smoke >5 cpd, and were 
included in the analyses. Adolescents who were invited to participate provided their written 
assent and the informed consent of one parent before taking part in the study. The UCSF 
Institutional Review Board approved the study procedures.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Demographics—Participants self-reported age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
2.2.2. Socioeconomic status—Maternal educational attainment (high school graduate 
or less; some college to college graduate; graduate/professional degree; don’t know/does not 
apply) was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status.

 2.2.3. Drug use—Participants reported past three-month use of cigar, pipe, chewing 
tobacco, snuff, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine/crack, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and 
other drugs (with write-in space to specify which “other” drugs). For each drug category, six 
response choices were dichotomized into “current use” (frequency of more than once a 
month) and “no current use” (frequency of less than or equal to once a month).
2.2.4. Cigarette smoking characteristics—Participants reported days smoked in the 
past 30 and amount of each cigarette usually smoked. Nicotine dependence was assessed 
using the modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (mFTQ), which has been validated 
for use in adolescent smokers (Prokhorov, De Moor, Pallonen, et al., 2000). The mFTQ is 
scored continuously from 0 to 9 (0–2: no dependence; 3–5: moderate dependence; 6–9: high 
dependence). Self-efficacy to quit or reduce cigarette smoking was assessed with two items: 
“If you decided to quit smoking completely, how sure are you that you would be able to do 
it?” and “If you wanted to cut down now, how sure are you that you would be able to do it?” 
(Scored from 1 “not at all” to 4 “very.”)
2.2.5. Depression—Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for 
Epidemiological Studies-Depression, Revised scale (CESD-R), which has been found to be 
an accurate and valid measure of depression using algorithmic classification methods (Van 
Dam & Earleywine, 2011) scored continuously (from 0 to 60). A score of at least 16 
indicates the existence of clinically significant depression symptoms (Haroz, Ybarra, & 
Eaton, 2014).
2.3. Data analyses
Analyses were conducted in three stages. First, baseline frequencies of reported current drug 
use (including tobacco products other than cigarettes) were examined. Disparate frequencies 
across the 11 drug categories necessitated the creation of a smaller number of meaningful 
categories. Cigar (n = 67); pipe (n = 17); chewing tobacco (n = 4); and snuff (n = 3) were 
combined to create “other tobacco.” Cocaine/crack (n = 3), methamphetamine (n = 0), 
ecstasy (n = 18), heroin (n = 0), and other drugs (n = 17) were combined to create “harder 
drugs,” named for meaningfulness and easy identification. This resulted in four categories: 
1) other tobacco, 2) alcohol, 3) marijuana, and 4) harder drugs.
Second, changes in use status (i.e., into use and out of use) for each of the four drug 
categories from one time to the next (i.e., from baseline to 12 months, from 12 to 24 months, 
and from 24 to 36 months) were examined. Significant change was tested for by McNemar’s 
test for correlated proportions and revealed little change. Based on these results no further 
modeling of change was conducted.
Third, LCA was used to identify latent classes of adolescent polydrug use based on current 
use (yes/no) at baseline of the above four categories using MPlus version 7.31 (Muthén & 
Muthén, 2012). Latent class analysis fits finite mixture models to data to detect latent 
clusters of observations (i.e., “classes”). Given K classes, LCA estimates the probability of 
each observation belonging to each class (“conditional response probabilities”) and class 
assignment for each observation is based on the highest conditional response probability.

 LCA model fit was evaluated using the Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio (LMR) test; 
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Raftery, 1995); and Akaike’s information criterion 
(AIC) (Akaike, 1992). A statistically significant LMR p-value indicates improvement in fit 
with the inclusion of one more class. Low BIC and AIC values indicate a better model fit, 
and as such, the model with the lowest AIC and BIC is generally preferred. We also 
considered the entropy value (0–1) to assess the clarity of the classification of individuals 
into classes; values closer to 1 are desirable (Muthén & Muthén, 2012). Finally, we 
considered the average posterior probabilities (values from 0 to 1), which provide a class-
specific measure of how well class membership within the sample was predicted by the 
indicators; values >0.70 indicate adequate class assignment accuracy and good separation 
(Nagin & Odgers, 2010).
Baseline correlates and outcomes hypothesized to be associated with class membership at 
12, 24, and 36 months follow-up were compared. Pearson’s chi-squared (or Fisher’s exact 
where appropriate) tests were used to identify differences in proportions and mean scores 
were compared using the t-statistic (Muthén, 2004). Since our investigation was largely 
exploratory, all differences were considered significant by a 2-tailed test for independent 
samples at the level of p <0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics of sample
Demographics, cigarette smoking characteristics, drug use frequencies, and CESD-R scores 
are presented in Table 1. While 98% (n = 170) of participants reported current use of at least 
one drug in addition to cigarettes and 68% (n = 120) reported current use of 2–4 drugs, just 
7% (n = 13) reported using solely another tobacco product in addition to cigarettes. Specific 
“other” drug(s) used were: psilocybin (mushrooms; n = 7), misused prescription painkillers 
(n = 6), nitrous oxide (n = 3), LSD (n = 2), amphetamines (n = 1), hash (n = 1), and “triple 
c’s” (Corcidin cough & cold; main psychoactive ingredient dextromethorphan; n = 1). Over 
one-third of participants had mFTQ scores indicating [moderate (31.3%; n = 55) and high 
(5%; n = 8)] nicotine dependence and 42% of the sample (n = 74) had CESD-R scores 
indicating depression.
3.2. Changes in use status over time
Overall, the proportion of participants reporting current use in any drug category was stable 
over the course of the study period (3 years). The only significant change occurred from 
baseline to 12 months when out of N = 148, 39% changed other tobacco use-status; 30% 
went from no current use to current use while 9% changed from current use to no current 
use; this difference in proportion was statistically significant (McNemar’s (S) = 16.86 p 
<0.0001). Given the lack of observed change, no further modeling of change was conducted.
3.3. Latent class analysis model selection
The AIC, BIC, and LMR p-value suggested a two-class model fit the data slightly better than 
a one-class model (Table 2). The entropy value of 0.81, while lower than that for the three-
class solution, indicated acceptable classification quality. The average individual posterior

 probabilities for being assigned to a specific latent class indicated clear separation into two 
classes (0.954 for class 1 and 1.0 for class 2). Given high classification quality and large 
difference in proportion of other drug use across categories, the two-class solution was 
favored.
3.4. Descriptions of latent classes
Fig. 1 shows the percent of participants who reported current use of other tobacco, alcohol, 
marijuana, and harder drugs at baseline and 12-, 24-, and 36-months follow-up, by class. 
Class 1 was more representative of the entire cohort and was thus labeled Limited Range 
Use (n = 147; 84%). The second class was labeled Extended Range Use (n = 29; 16%) since 
all members reported using harder drugs in addition to other tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana 
at baseline.
3.5. Baseline characteristics of latent classes
There were no differences between Extended Range Use and Limited Range Use class 
members in age (t(174) = 0.718; p = 0.47), gender (χ2(1, N = 176) = 1.59, p = 0.21), race/
ethnicity ([df = 3, N = 176], Fisher’s exact p = 0.45), maternal educational attainment ([df = 
3, N = 174], p = 0.62), or likelihood of marijuana use ([df = 1, N = 176], p = 0.35; Table 1). 
A larger proportion of Extended Range Use class members reported smoking the entire 
cigarette (χ2(1, N = 175) = 5.17, p = 0.023), while both groups had mean mFTQ scores 
indicative of mild nicotine dependence (t(174) = 1.30; p = 0.20), and reported similar, 
moderate perceived self-efficacy to quit (t(149) = 0.52; p = 0.96) or reduce (t(149) = 0.20; p 
= 0.84) smoking. Extended Range Use members, on average, reported current use of a 
greater number of drugs (t(174) = 9.33; p <0.001) and had higher mean CESD-R scores 
(t(164) = 2.12; p = 0.035) than members of the Limited Range Use class.
3.6. Outcomes at 12-, 24-, and 36-months
There were no between-group differences in cigarette smoking characteristics or nicotine 
dependence. The proportion of participants in each class reporting harder drug use 
converged over the study period. The proportion of the Extended Range Use class who 
reported using harder drugs fell at 12 (17.69% from 100% to 42.31%) and 24 months 
(20.57% from 42.31% to 21.74%) while the proportion of Limited Range Use class grew 
(from 0% to 12.5% to 13.76%). The proportion of both classes that reported harder drug use 
at 36 month follow up was smaller than at all three preceding time points for the Extended 
Range Use class (16.67%) and smaller than at 12- and 24 months for the Limited Range Use 
class (7.32%). (Fig. 1) Higher mean depression scores were predicted by Extended Range 
Use class membership compared to Limited Range Use class membership at 12 (17.64 
± 10.72 vs. 15.82 ± 9.49; p = 0.40), 24 (20.68 ± 13.02 vs. 14.31 ± 10.09; p = 0.04) and 36 
(19.20 ± 11.48 vs. 13.98 ± 10.04; p = 0.02) months.
4. Discussion
There were two dominant patterns of polydrug use in this sample of urban adolescent 
smokers, differentiated by early use of harder drugs. Importantly, in the three years after the 
classes were identified using baseline polydrug use patterns, patterns converged with harder

 drug use reported by members of both classes; still each year, a larger proportion of 
Extended Range Use class members were depressed. These findings suggest a need for early 
substance use prevention interventions and tobacco cessation programming among urban 
adolescent smokers. Efforts should include depression screening to identify adolescents who 
may be at higher risk for early initiation of polydrug use and experimentation with harder 
drugs.
Our hypothesis that classes characterized by use of a greater number and variety of drugs 
would be associated with cigarette smoking characteristics indicative of heavier smoking 
was not confirmed. Classes did not differ in quantity or frequency of smoking nor in level of 
reported nicotine dependence, suggesting that “lighter” patterns of smoking (e.g., nondaily, 
≤5 cpd) and lower levels of nicotine dependence in adolescence can be as much a risk for 
polydrug use as heavier, more severe patterns of smoking. These findings provide support 
for the idea that light and nondaily smoking are normal smoking patterns among young 
people (Schane, Glantz, & Ling, 2009) and point to a need for addressing these lighter 
patterns with the same fervor as heavier patterns.
That the patterns of current polydrug use and light smoking, together with low levels of 
nicotine dependence were maintained among virtually all of these urban adolescent smokers 
runs contrary to the literature that reports a positive and causal association between drug use 
and smoking in adolescents (Piasecki, Trela, Hedeker, et al., 2014) and young adults 
(Krukowski, Solomon, & Naud, 2005). Instead, our results comport with reports suggesting 
persistent use patterns of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs may begin in 
adolescence. Regular polydrug use with adolescent onset put youth at risk for lifelong and 
disordered use (as well as psychiatric disorders) (Brook et al., 2002) and our finding of 
sustained co-use of multiple drugs and cigarettes serves to underscore the need for early 
prevention and cessation interventions among urban adolescent smokers.
Overall prevalence of symptoms indicative of clinical depression was high in this sample 
ranging from a low of 37% at 36 month-follow up and a high of 49% at 12 months (42% at 
baseline and 40% at 24 months). This is higher than past year major depressive disorder in 
the National Comorbidity Survey (7.5%) (Avenevoli, Swendsen, He, et al., 2015). That 96% 
of this sample reported using drugs could help explain this disparity given higher odds of 
major depressive disorder among those with substance use disorder (3.42 for girls, 2.44 for 
boys) (Avenevoli et al., 2015). Further, older adolescents and girls are at higher risk of 
depression (Felton et al., 2015; Avenevoli et al., 2015). This sample was 65% female and 
aged 16 at baseline (with participants being followed through age ≈19), suggesting high risk 
for depression.
That a two class model fit our data best, and that nearly all participants (96%) reported 
polydrug use, runs contrary to a 2016 systematic review of studies using LCA to identify 
classes of adolescent polysubstance use by Tomczyk et al. that reported 74% of included 
studies found three to four classes and that polysubstance use subgroups were the smallest 
(Tomczyk et al., 2016). This sample of adolescent smokers also had a slightly higher 
prevalence of current alcohol (68%) and marijuana (76%) use when compared to findings 
from the 2014 SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health (58% and 52%, 
McKelvey et al.

 respectively) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 
2015). These differences could be due partly to our sample being comprised of urban-
dwelling adolescents who were largely referred by one another and likely engage in similar 
risk behaviors (i.e., polydrug use). The relative lack of differences in demographic, smoking, 
and drug use characteristics between the classes is likely due to overall sample homogeneity, 
which is typical of other groups of high risk adolescents in ethnically diverse urban areas 
who are connected by proximity and shared behaviors.
Classes were clearly differentiated by early use of harder drugs and greater depression 
symptoms that persisted for three years in the Extended Range Use group. Members of this 
group may be at risk for worse health outcomes, pointing to a need for drug use prevention 
and smoking cessation interventions as early as middle school in this vulnerable group. 
Given the strong and reciprocal relationship between depressive symptoms and polydrug use 
in adolescence, (Maslowsky et al., 2014) it is possible some Extended Range Use class 
members may exhibit independent substance use and clinical depression, while others are 
experimenting with both harder and a larger variety of drugs to cope with negative emotions 
(McConnell, Memetovic, & Richardson, 2014). Over half of Extended Range Use class 
members reported CESD-R scores over the cutoff for clinical depression at each time point 
and the lack of significant between-class difference at 12 months owes to more Limited 
Range Use class members reporting higher CESD-R scores. As these adolescents approach 
young adulthood, it is not surprising that the difference in proportion reporting current use of 
harder drugs narrows since “emerging adulthood” (age 18–25) is a time of marked increase 
in experimentation with drugs (Arnett, 2000). Further, the convergence of the probability of 
reporting current use of harder drugs may also indicate that early use of harder drugs is not 
necessarily tied to long term use and not all adolescents using hard drugs at young ages are 
candidates for substance use disorder treatment. Given high rates of depression, mental 
health treatment may be more appropriate. Finally, it is possible that depressive symptoms 
endorsed at baseline among Extended Range Use class members were treated, lessening the 
need for harder drugs to cope with negative emotions.
5. Limitations
First, LCA assigns individuals to the class to which they are most likely to belong based on 
their response pattern (i.e., responses to current drug use (y/n)); however, individuals often 
have a non-zero probability of assignment to other classes. Here, though, all members of 
class 2 (Extended Range Use) had a probability of zero for assignment to class 1. Still, 
caution must be used in generalizing about patterns of adolescent polydrug use from this 
study, as not all adolescent smokers will fall perfectly into one of the two classes identified 
here. Second, our sample size (N = 176) was smaller than the size of 500 traditionally 
recommended by some for LCA (Finch & Bronk, 2011); however, more recent research has 
shown that sample size >70 is sufficient (Wurpts & Geiser, 2014). Finally, this we conducted 
secondary analysis of data so findings were somewhat limited insofar as our frequency 
measure for drugs is not directly comparable to commonly used adolescent tobacco-use 
frequency (i.e., past 30 day use) and depression was the sole psychosocial variable that was 
measured. Future studies should include measures of important psychosocial correlates of

 adolescent drug use such as externalizing behavior and sensation seeking (Patrick & 
Schulenberg, 2014).
6. Implications and contribution
The high prevalence of, and persistence of polydrug use over three years among urban 
adolescent smokers highlights the need for early cessation and prevention intervention 
efforts that target tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs of abuse. These efforts should 
take into account that even adolescents who report only light or intermittent smoking may be 
using multiple drugs and that both patterns of light smoking and polydrug use can be 
chronic. Most adolescent smokers are primarily using alcohol and marijuana, but our 
findings reveal early use of harder drugs in a smaller subgroup as well, which could reflect 
early experimentation or attempts to self-medicate for depression. Urban adolescents should 
also be screened regularly, perhaps during the annual school registration process, for 
depression. Since depressive symptoms could be a precursor to more problematic drug use, 
identifying and counseling depressed adolescents could prevent progression to use of harder 
drugs or a greater number of drugs, or both. Cessation and prevention interventions should 
be implemented early, before smokers progress to polydrug use or smoking and polydrug 
use behaviors become ingrained, or both (Schane et al., 2009; Huh, Huang, Liao, et al., 
2013).

 HIGHLIGHTS
•
96% of urban adolescent smokers (N = 169) from San Francisco reported 
polydrug use.
•
Adolescents reporting only light/intermittent smoking may be using multiple 
drugs.
•
18% (n = 29) reported early use (age ≤16) of harder drugs and depressive 
symptoms.
•
Depressive symptoms could precede more problematic drug use.
•
Early prevention/cessation intervention including depression screening is 
called for.
