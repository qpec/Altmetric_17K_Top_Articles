Background and Purpose—EmboTrap is a novel stent retriever designed to achieve rapid and substantial flow restoration in 
acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-vessel occlusions. Here, we evaluated EmboTrap’s safety and efficacy compared 
with established stent retrievers.
Methods—ARISE II (Analysis of Revascularization in Ischemic Stroke With EmboTrap) was a single-arm, prospective, 
multicenter study, comparing the EmboTrap device to a composite performance goal criterion derived using a 
Bayesian meta-analysis from the pivotal SWIFT (Solitaire device) and TREVO 2 (Trevo device) trials. Patients at 
11 US and 8 European sites were eligible for inclusion if they had large-vessel occlusions and moderate-to-severe 
neurological deficits within 8 hours of symptom onset. The primary efficacy end point was achievement of modified 
Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) reperfusion scores of ≥2b within 3 EmboTrap passes as adjudicated by 
the core laboratory. The primary safety end point was a composite of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and 
serious adverse device effects. Secondary end points included functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2) 
and all-cause mortality at 90 days.
Results—Between October 2015 and February 2017, 227 patients were enrolled and treated with the EmboTrap device. The 
primary efficacy end point (mTICI ≥2b within 3 passes) was achieved in 80.2% (95% confidence interval, 74%–85% 
versus 56% performance goal criterion; P value, <0.0001), and mTICI 2c/3 was 65%. After all interventions, mTICI 2c/3 
was achieved in 76%, and mTICI ≥2b was 92.5%. The rate of first pass (mTICI ≥2b following a single pass) was 51.5%. 
The primary safety end point composite rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or serious adverse device effects 
was 5.3%. Functional independence and all-cause mortality at 90 days were 67% and 9%, respectively.
Conclusions—The EmboTrap stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy device demonstrated high rates of substantial 
reperfusion and functional independence in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-vessel occlusions.

R
ecent landmark acute ischemic stroke (AIS) trials have 
demonstrated the clinical benefit and superior reperfu-
sion efficacy of endovascular therapy using stent-retriever 
thrombectomy devices.1–4 Presently, these devices are now 
considered the standard of care for treatment of AIS second-
ary to large-vessel occlusion.5 In a pooled, individual partici-
pant data meta-analyses of these trials, the rate of successful 
reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral 
Ischemia [mTICI] ≥2b6) was 71%, whereas the rate of final 
complete reperfusion (mTICI, 3) was only 33%.7,8 However, 
given the ≈30% rate of failed reperfusion and only one third 
of patients achieving final complete reperfusion after all inter-
ventions, further advances in mechanical thrombectomy are 
warranted. Moreover, opportunities exist to increase the rate 
of near-complete reperfusion (mTICI, ≥2c) from a single pass 
(eg, first-pass [FP] success), which has been shown to improve 
patient outcomes (90-day functional independence rates of 
61.3% versus 35.3% in non-FP success).9
The EmboTrap reperfusion device (Neuravi/Cerenovus) is 
a dual-layer stent retriever, engineered with articulating petals, 
and a distal capture zone for effectively trapping, retaining, and 
removing various clot types to restore blood flow in patients 
with AIS secondary to large-vessel occlusion (Figure 1A).10 
It is designed for use in cerebral circulations with promising 
results from the first in-person clinical experience.11
ARISE II (Analysis of Revascularization in Ischemic Stroke 
With EmboTrap) was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, 
prospective clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of the EmboTrap device in patients with AIS compared 
with a performance goal (PG) established using adjudicated 
efficacy rates for the FDA-approved predicate stent-retriever 
devices, Solitaire (Medtronic) and Trevo (Stryker).12,13
Methods
Study Design
The data that support the findings of this study are available from the 
corresponding author on reasonable request and with approval from 
the ARISE II investigators. The primary ARISE II study hypothesis 
was the superiority of the EmboTrap device successful reperfusion 
performance in the treated population within 3 attempts as compared 
with a composite PG criterion derived using Bayesian meta-analysis 
of the pivotal SWIFT (SOLITAIRE™ FR With the Intention for 
Thrombectomy) and TREVO 2 trials (Randomized Trial Evaluating 
Performance of the Trevo Retriever Versus the Merci Retriever in 
Acute Ischemic Stroke). The study was overseen by an executive 
committee, composed of academic investigators and statisticians, 
an independent clinical events committee, and an independent data 
and safety monitoring board. The data and safety monitoring board 
consisted of 2 stroke neurologists and 3 neurointerventionalists, who 
did not enroll patients, and a biostatistician. The data and safety 
monitoring board acted in an expert advisory capacity and moni-
tored subject safety and the conduct of the study. The clinical events 
committee adjudicated all safety end points, including hemorrhages, 
dissections/perforations, and serious neurological adverse events. 
The sponsor, Neuravi, was responsible for logistical operations, data 
management, and monitoring of the trial. The study protocol was 
approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at 
each participating site.
Population and Participating Centers
Enrollment occurred at 11 US and 8 European centers. Study centers 
were required to have participated in similar regulated studies within 
the past 12 months. All patients or their legally authorized represen-
tative provided written informed consent before enrollment. Patients 
aged 18 to 85 years were eligible for the study if they had AIS with 
moderate-to-severe neurological deficits, angiographically proven 
occlusion (mTICI, 0–1) in the internal carotid, middle cerebral (M1 
or M2 segment), basilar, or vertebral artery, and could undergo endo-
vascular therapy (at least 1 EmboTrap deployment) within 8 hours of 
symptom onset. Key inclusion criteria included prestroke modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤1, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke 
Scale (NIHSS) score ≥8 and ≤25, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT 
Score (ASPECTS) ≥6 or core infarct volume <50 mL on magnetic 
resonance imaging or computed tomography-based imaging (for ante-
rior circulation strokes), and treatment with intravenous tPA (tissue-
type plasminogen activator; if eligible within 3 hours of stroke onset). 
Key exclusion criteria included stenosis or any occlusion in a proximal 
vessel requiring treatment or preventing access to the thrombus (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement). Results are presented on the 
treated population who were consented and enrolled after diagnostic 
angiography and received intervention with the EmboTrap.
Procedures
Arterial access and use of anesthesia was performed according to 
the standard practices of the study center. A baseline angiogram was 
obtained before device deployment to assess angiographic inclusion/
exclusion criteria. Patients undergoing angiography but not meeting 
study criteria were followed up for 72 hours after the procedure.
The EmboTrap was used in accordance with instructions for use 
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). A minimum of 1 
deployment of the EmboTrap was required within 8 hours of symp-
tom onset. Up to 3 passes of the EmboTrap were allowed to achieve 
successful reperfusion (mTICI, ≥2b). After the third attempt, res-
cue therapy could be used at the discretion of the operator. Rescue 
therapy was defined as the use of another mechanical thrombec-
tomy device, mechanical pump aspiration, intracranial stenting, or 
initiation of intra-arterial tPA during the procedure. The primary 
efficacy end point angiogram was captured before the start of any 
rescue treatment and following the 3 device passes or at the end of 
the procedure (if <3 passes). If rescue therapy was used before 3 
passes, the case was counted as a failure to achieve primary efficacy 
end point. Follow-up assessments were performed at 24 hours, 7 
days, and 90 days. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
imaging was obtained 24 hours post-procedure to assess for any 
hemorrhage. Both NIHSS and mRS scores were obtained at the 7- 
and 90-day visits.
Outcomes
Primary Efficacy End Point
The degree of reperfusion was assessed by central readers using 
the mTICI scale with the addition of the 2c score.6,14 The primary 
efficacy end point was successful reperfusion, defined as achieving 
mTICI ≥2b in the target vessel within 3 passes of the EmboTrap 
device without the use of rescue therapy. Two experienced neuroin-
terventionalist readers from the independent core laboratory adjudi-
cated the angiograms and assessed the mTICI scores. If the 2 readers 
assigned a different score, a third experienced reader would adju-
dicate. The core laboratory scores were used for determination of 
primary efficacy end point.
Primary Safety End Point
The primary safety end point was a composite of symptomatic intra-
cerebral hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours (−8/+12 hours) post-
procedure, together with any serious adverse device effects (excluding 
those already counted in sICH). sICH was defined as any extravascu-
lar blood in the brain or within the cranium associated with clinical 
deterioration, as defined by a worsening NIHSS score of ≥4 points, 
or that led to death and was identified as the predominant cause of 
the neurological deterioration adjudicated by an independent clinical 
event committee.15 All computed tomographic/magnetic resonance 
images were assessed by the independent core laboratory to detect

and evaluate the occurrence of hemorrhages. All hemorrhages and 
serious adverse device effects reported in the study were reviewed 
and adjudicated by the clinical events committee.
Secondary End Points
Prespecified secondary end points included (1) functional indepen-
dence, defined as a mRS score of 0 to 2 at 90 days; (2) procedure 
time, defined as time from puncture to achievement of mTICI ≥2b 
or, if not obtained, to the final angiogram; (3) time to treat, defined as 
time from first baseline angiogram to achievement of mTICI ≥2b or, 
if not obtained, to the final angiogram; (4) embolization in a previ-
ously uninvolved territory on angiogram; (5) sICH; (6) procedure-
related mortality rate at 7 days and all-cause mortality at 90 days; 
(7) rate of serious adverse device effect; and (8) rate of neurological 
deterioration by ≥4 points on NIHSS adjudicated by an independent 
clinical event committee.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to investigate the performance of 
the EmboTrap device (PEmboTrap) against a PG for efficacy 
(PGefficacy=0.56) derived from a Bayesian hierarchical random 
effects meta-analysis of reperfusion efficacy rates of approved 
predicate devices’ core laboratory adjudicated performances as 
reported in the literature. The meta-analysis resulted in an average 
rate of 64% to which a margin of analysis of 8% was applied, hence 
a PG for efficacy of 56%. The test of effectiveness was based on a

An evaluable sample size of 176 provided 90% power to dem-
onstrate superiority to PG (PGefficacy) of 0.56, based on a 1-sided 
exact test for a binomial proportion at the 0.025 significance level 
and assuming that the proportion of adjudicated successes with 
the EmboTrap device is 0.68. The primary safety end point was 
evaluated descriptively, with an unadjusted 95% confidence inter-
val (CI). Descriptive statistics were used for demographics, base-
line characteristics, procedural information, and clinical outcomes 
(efficacy and safety). All CIs for binary variables are Clopper–
Pearson Exact binomial CIs, and those for continuous variables 
are based on a normal distribution assumption for the parameter 
of interest. Analysis was performed using SAS V9.4, R, SPSS, 
Minitab, and Stata.
Results
Between October 2015 and February 2017, 228 patients 
were enrolled in the study, and 227 subsequently under-
went treatment with the EmboTrap. Figure 1B outlines the 
screening, enrollment, and treatment of the ARISE II-treated 
population.
The baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean 
age was 68±13 years, 45.8% were men, and the mean baseline 
NIHSS was 15.8±5. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) 
baseline ASPECT score was 10 (9–10). Anterior circulation 
occlusion was encountered in 96% of patients, the most com-
mon location being the middle cerebral artery, M1 (55.5%) 
and M2 (25.1%), followed by internal carotid artery occlu-
sion (15.4%). Over half of the patients (52.9%) received intra-
venous tPA. A balloon guide catheter was used in 73.6% of 
patients.
Key time metrics are presented in Figure 2A. The median 
time from symptom onset/last known well to puncture was 
214 (IQR, 155–266) minutes and door-to-puncture was 60 
(IQR, 36–93) minutes.
Primary Efficacy End Points 
and Reperfusion Results
The EmboTrap achieved the primary efficacy end point of 
successful reperfusion (mTICI ≥2b within 3 passes and with-
out use of rescue therapy) in 182 of 227 (80.2%; 95% CI, 
74%–85%) and demonstrated superiority to the preset PG cri-
terion of 56% for efficacy (P value, <0.0001; Table 2). Three 
patients treated with rescue therapy before 3 EmboTrap passes 
were counted as failure.
The rate of mTICI ≥2c reperfusion within 3 EmboTrap 
passes was 64.8%. The full distribution of reperfusion out-
comes is shown in Figure 2B. FP effect (mTICI ≥2c after a 
single pass) was seen in 91 of 227 (40.1%) and modified FP 
effect (mTICI ≥2b after a single pass) was seen in 117 of 227 
(51.5%) patients.
Rescue therapy was used in 44 of 227 (19.4%) patients, 
including use of intra-arterial thrombolysis, other thrombec-
tomy devices, and pump aspiration (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Final angiographic reperfusion rates after all interven-
tions were 92.5% mTICI ≥2b, 75.8% mTICI ≥2c, and 52.0% 
mTICI 3.
Primary Safety End Points
The primary safety composite end point rate of sICH post-
procedure or serious adverse device effects was 5.3% (95% 
CI, 3%–9%; Table 3). All events were sICH.
Secondary End Points
Secondary outcomes are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Functional 
independence (mRS, 0–2) at 90 days was achieved in 67.3% 
(146/217; 95% CI, 61%–73%). The full distribution of disabil-
ity levels at 90 days is shown in Figure 2C. Neurological dete-
rioration by ≥4 NIHSS points at 24 hours occurred in 4.5% 
(95% CI, 2%–9%). Procedure-related mortality rate at day 7 
was 0% and all-cause mortality at day 90 was 9% (95% CI, 
6%–14%). The median time to treat (interval from baseline 
angiogram to final post-EmboTrap angiogram) was 24 min-
utes (IQR, 13–46), whereas the procedure time was 36 min-
utes (IQR, 24–61; Figure 2A). The rate of embolization into 
new territory on angiography was 6.6%. All adverse events are 
listed in Table III in the online-only Data Supplement.
Discussion
In this prospective, multicenter trial, the EmboTrap achieved 
high rates of reperfusion among patients with AIS with large-
vessel occlusion, with substantial reperfusion achieved in 8 
of every 10 patients with the EmboTrap alone and after addi-
tional interventions, achieved in >9 of every 10 patients. The 
successful reperfusion rate exceeded the threshold required to 
demonstrate superiority when compared with the study set PG 
criterion derived from reperfusion rates achieved by the predi-
cate Trevo and Solitaire retriever devices in their regulatory 
registration trials.13,15
In the present trial, the enrolled patients were largely similar 
to those in the comparator studies (Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement)13,15 A slightly higher proportion of ARISE II 
patients had M2 occlusions. Compared with proximal occlu-
sions, M2 occlusions may differ in their response to endo-
vascular intervention. A lower clot burden may increase the 
likelihood of reperfusion success in M2 occlusions, but their 
more distal location, smaller size, and accessibility can dimin-
ish the likelihood of reperfusion success.16 However, the higher 
M2 rate in ARISE II did not affect the comparison with the 
prior trials because the reperfusion rate for M2 occlusions was 
not higher than those for occlusions in the other target vessels.
ARISE II patients were also treated earlier than in the com-
parator trials, reflecting the evolution of systems of care and 
quality programs focused on shortening door-to-puncture 
times.17 Because early reperfusion success is associated with 
reduced infarct volumes and decreased global disability,17 the 
faster treatment times likely contributed to the improved clini-
cal outcomes in ARISE II.
The TREVO and Solitaire devices have been evaluated in 
numerous subsequent trials and prospective registries, some 
reporting higher rates of reperfusion than what was initially 
achieved in TREVO 2 and SWIFT studies.18,19 Although direct 
comparisons between the ARISE II results and many of the 
recent prospective trials are not possible, because of differ-
ing enrollment criteria and angiographic end points, the suc-
cessful reperfusion rates and clinical outcomes in our study

compare favorably with those in the more recent prospec-
tive studies of other mechanical thrombectomy devices. The 
SEER and HERMES individual patient data pooled analyses 
reported final mTICI ≥2b rates of 71.1% and 71%, respec-
tively, whereas the current study reported rates of 80% (within 
3 EmboTrap passes) and 92.5% at the end of the procedure.7,8

When considering these randomized efficacy trials individu-
ally, the final reperfusion success rate of ARISE II was similar 
to the SWIFT PRIME trial,3 which yielded one of the highest 
rates of final mTICI ≥2b at 88% (Tables IV through VI in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
The EmboTrap also showed favorable performance on 
several measures indicating faster or more complete reperfu-
sion, beyond successful reperfusion (mTICI, ≥2b). ARISE II 
evaluated the FP6 reperfusion measures, indicating immediate 
achievement of reperfusion on a single device pass, (the first trial 
to have the FP measures adjudicated by the core laboratory). FP 
successful reperfusion (mTICI, ≥2b) was achieved in 50% and 
FP excellent reperfusion (TICI, ≥2c) in 4 of every 10 patients. 
The ARISE II FP rates compared favorably to the self-reported 
angiographic outcome data of 25% excellent reperfusion in the 
Solitaire and Trevo device retrospective registries.6,18 EmboTrap 
also showed high rates of TICI ≥2c in 64.8% of patients within 
3 passes compared with 56.6% achieving final TICI ≥2c in 
the stent-retriever arm of the ASTER trial (Contact Aspiration 
Versus Stent Retriever for Successful Revascularization).20
Faster and more complete resolution of ischemia has been 
associated with improved outcomes.17 The favorable reperfu-
sion performance in ARISE II, along with other factors, such 
as patient selection, good ASPECT score, and speed of treat-
ment, may potentially have contributed to the high rate of 
good long-term clinical outcomes. In the present study, two 
thirds of patients were functionally independent (mRS, 0–2) 
and one half were disability free (mRS, 0–1) at 3 months, 
which compared favorably with previous studies (Table V in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
The promising angiographic results in ARISE II may be

flow channel, and the dense mesh distal end structure aims 
at reducing distal embolization. Other potential contributing 
factors may include increased operator experience with stent 
retrievers since their approval, the higher proportion of M2 
and lower proportion of internal carotid artery target occlu-
sions,21 lower clinical severity (median NIHSS, 16 versus 18 
in SWIFT and 19 in TREVO 2), inclusion of small core infarct 
volume,22 earlier time from stroke onset to treatment, use of 
balloon guide catheters,23 and differences between the study 
populations in unmeasured variables.
The safety of the EmboTrap device in the current study was 
within the range of recent stent-retriever trials. Although the 
definition of sICH differed between trials, the 5% rate of sICH 
in ARISE II was comparable with 2% and 4% sICH rates in 
SWIFT and TREVO 2 trials,13,15 respectively (Table VII in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The all-cause mortality rate at 
90 days was 9%, which is remarkably low for patients pre-
senting with severe neurological deficits (median NIHSS, 16) 
and compared favorably to SWIFT and TREVO 2 at 17% and 
33%, respectively.13,15 These safety results support an accept-
able benefit–risk profile for the device.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. The study was a single-arm 
trial against an objective PG criterion derived from prior studies 
of other devices, rather than a randomized trial with an internal 
control group. This design limits precision in concluding how 
well the EmboTrap performs compared with any particular sin-
gle comparator device. The clinical outcome evaluators and cen-
tral imaging adjudicators were not blinded to device use, but the 
requirement for certified clinical raters and use of a central core 
laboratory with readings by at least 2 independent raters were 
designed to mitigate any resulting bias. Similarly, clot length and 
density, which has been associated with reperfusion success and 
clinical outcome in several studies, was not captured.24
Conclusions
This prospective, multicenter study of a novel stent retriever 
designed specifically to address a broader range of clot types 
demonstrated that the EmboTrap device alone achieved suc-
cessful reperfusion in 8 of 10 patients and was superior to the 
preset performance criteria derived from predicate thrombec-
tomy device trials. In addition, substantial reperfusion was 
achieved on a single pass in one half of patients, and, after
