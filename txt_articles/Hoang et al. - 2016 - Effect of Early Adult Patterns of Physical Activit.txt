IMPORTANCE Sedentary behaviors and physical inactivity are not only increasing worldwide
but also are critical risk factors for adverse health outcomes. Yet, few studies have examined
the effects of sedentary behavior on cognition or the long-term role of either behavior in early
to middle adulthood.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between 25-year patterns of television viewing and
physical activity and midlife cognition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective study of 3247 adults (black and white races;
aged 18-30 years) enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) Study (March 25, 1985, to August 31, 2011). Data analysis was performed June 1,
2014, through April 15, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We assessed television viewing and physical activity at
repeated visits (ï¿½3 assessments) over 25 years using a validated questionnaire. A 25-year
pattern of high television viewing was defined as watching TV above the upper baseline
quartile (>3 hours/d) for more than two-thirds of the visits, and a 25-year pattern of low
physical activity was defined as activity levels below the lower, sex-specific baseline quartile
for more than two-thirds of the of the visits. We evaluated cognitive function at year 25 using
the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Stroop test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning
Test.
RESULTS At baseline, the mean (SD) age of the 3247 study participants was 25.1 (3.6) years,
1836 (56.5%) were female, 1771 (54.5%) were white, and 3015 (92.9%) had completed at
least high school. Compared with participants with low television viewing, those with high
television viewing during 25 years (353 of 3247 [10.9%]) were more likely to have poor
cognitive performance (<1 SD below the race-specific mean) on the DSST and Stroop test,
with findings reported as adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): DSST, 1.64 (1.21-2.23) and Stroop test,
1.56 (1.13-2.14), but not the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, adjusted for age, race, sex,
educational level, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and hypertension. Low physical
activity during 25 years in 528 of 3247 participants (16.3%) was significantly associated with
poor performance on the DSST, 1.47 (1.14-1.90). Compared with participants with low
television viewing and high physical activity, the odds of poor performance were almost 2
times higher for adults with both high television viewing and low physical activity in 107 of
3247 (3.3%) (DSST, 1.95 [1.19-3.22], and Stroop test, 2.20 [1.36-3.56]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE High television viewing and low physical activity in early
adulthood were associated with worse midlife executive function and processing speed. This
is one of the first studies to demonstrate that these risk behaviors may be critical targets for
prevention of cognitive aging even before middle age.

I
ncreasing observational evidence and results from ran-
domized clinical trials provide support for the beneficial
effects of physical activity on cognitive function.1-3 How-
ever, global surveillance data suggest that overall levels of
physical activity are declining,4 and the percentage of adoles-
cents meeting recommended guidelines for physical activity
is low, with even more failing to maintain these levels in
adulthood.5,6 Over the life course, levels of physical activity
tend to peak in childhood with large declines occurring dur-
ing early adulthood in conjunction with major life transi-
tions, such as entrance into the workforce and parenthood.6-9
Although early adulthood is a critical period for establishing
life-long physical activity habits,10 few studies have investi-
gated the association between physical activity in early adult-
hood and cognitive function later in life.11-13
Coupled with the increasing prevalence of sedentary or
screen-based activities, such as watching television, these
trends are of particular concern for upcoming generations of
young people.14,15 In middle-aged and older adults, low lev-
els of physical activity and high sedentary behavior are asso-
ciated with cognitive impairment and dementia,16-18 but the
long-term risks associated with these lifestyle behaviors
require further investigation. In particular, the longitudinal
association of television viewing with cognitive function is
not well defined. Understanding the effects of these modifi-
able risk factors across the life course could be crucial for
the development of effective population-based strategies
for optimal cognitive aging.
The objective of this study was to examine the associa-
tion between long-term patterns of physical activity and
television viewing time during young adulthood with cogni-
tive function in midlife. We hypothesized that patterns of
low physical activity and high television viewing time will
be associated with worse cognitive impairment at midlife.
Methods
Study Population
Young adults (aged 18-30 years) were recruited from popula-
tion-based samples of 4 US cities (Birmingham, Alabama; Chi-
cago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, Califor-
nia) and enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in
Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. The study was conducted from
March 25,1985, to August 31, 2011. Between 1985 and 1986, the
baseline examination (year 0) was completed for 5115 partici-
pants. Follow-up examinations were completed every 2 to 5
yearsover25years:1987-1988(year2),1990-1991(year5),1992-
1993 (year 7), 1995-1996 (year 10), 2000-2001 (year 15), 2005-
2006 (year 20), and 2010-2011 (year 25). Study protocols were
reviewed by institutional review boards at each study site as
wellastheCARDIAcoordinatingcenterattheUniversityofAla-
bama, Birmingham, and at the University of California, San
Francisco. At each examination, participants provided writ-
teninformedconsent.Participantsreceivedreimbursementfor
travel and parking and nominal compensation for participa-
tion in the in-person examinations (only). Further details of
study recruitment and design are available elsewhere.19,20
Of the 5115 participants, 3499 completed the year 25 visit.
To assess long-term patterns of physical activity and televi-
sion viewing time, we included participants with at least 3
assessments of physical activity, 3 assessments of television
viewing time, and a cognitive assessment at year 25. The final
analytic cohort included 3247 participants. Participants not in-
cluded in the analytic cohort had a lower educational level and
were more likely to be black, male, and smokers and have dia-
betes mellitus (P < .05).
Physical Activity
At baseline and each follow-up visit, the Physical Activity His-
tory Questionnaire, which provides a reliable measure of ha-
bitual physical activity,21,22 was used to assess participation
in 13 types of vigorous-intensity (running or jogging; racquet
sports; bicycling; swimming; exercise or dance class; job lift-
ing,carrying,ordigging;shovelingorliftingduringleisure;and
strenuous sports) and moderate-intensity (nonstrenuous
sports, walking and hiking, golfing and bowling, home exer-
cises or calisthenics, and home maintenance or gardening)
physical activities in the past 12 months. Based on the dura-
tion of participation (2-5 hours/week) and intensity level (3-8
metabolic equivalents) of each activity, a total activity score
was calculated as measured in exercise units. Further details
on the questionnaire and scoring have been published.22-24
Previous CARDIA analysis24 indicated that a cut point of 250
exercise units has 97.1% specificity and 70.4% sensitivity for
meetingrecommendedguidelinesof150minutesofmoderate-
intensity activity per week. A long-term pattern of low physi-
cal activity over 25 years was defined as reporting levels
below the bottom, sex-specific quartile (males, 280 exercise
units, and females, 148 exercise units) of baseline physical ac-
tivity levels for more than two-thirds of the visits. Partici-
pants not meeting these criteria were categorized as having
long-termpatternsofmoderatetohighphysicalactivity.Along-
term pattern of very low physical activity over 25 years was
definedasreportingactivitylevelsoflessthan50exerciseunits
for more than two-thirds of the visits.
Television Viewing Time
At years 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, participants were asked the av-
erage number of hours per day spent watching television in
thepast12months.Along-termpatternofhightelevisionview-
ing time over 25 years was defined as reporting activity levels
within the top quartile of the year 5 (baseline) visit (>3 hours/
day) for more than two-thirds of the visits. All other partici-
pants were categorized as having a low to moderate pattern
of television viewing time.
Physical Activity and Television Viewing Time
Based on patterns of physical activity and television viewing
time, a categorical variable was created to examine the com-
bined effects of both behaviors. Participants were catego-
rized into 3 groups: (1) most active (reference), including mod-
erate to high physical activity and low to moderate television
viewing time; (2) intermediate, including moderate to high
physicalactivityandhightelevisionviewingtimeorlowphysi-
cal activity and low to moderate television viewing time; and

vision viewing time.
Cognitive Function Assessment
Atyear25,trainedinterviewersadministeredabatteryof3cog-
nitive tests: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), which
assesses processing speed and executive function (higher
scores indicating better cognitive function)25; the Stroop test,
which assesses executive function (an interference score was
calculated with lower scores indicating better function)26,27;
and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), which as-
sesses verbal memory (the delayed score was used with higher
scores indicating better function).28,29 We defined low cogni-
tive performance as a race-specific score that was 1 SD worse
than the mean.
Covariates
We assessed baseline demographic characteristics, cigarette
smoking,andalcoholuseusingself-reports.Atbaseline,height
and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared.Hypertensionatbaselinewasdefinedassystolicblood
pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of
90 mm Hg or higher, or receiving antihypertensive medica-
tion.Diabetesmellitusatbaselinewasdefinedasfastingplasma
glucose levels of 126 mg/dL or higher (to convert to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) or use of diabetes medi-
cations. Isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting techniques
were used to determine the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) phe-
notype from year 7 blood samples.30,31
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared by patterns of physi-
cal activity and television viewing using unpaired, 2-tailed t
tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Ï2 tests as appropriate. We used
logistic regression to determine the association between pat-
terns of physical activity, television viewing, and a combina-
tion of the 2 during young adulthood with poor cognitive per-
formance in middle age. Multivariable models were adjusted
for age, race, sex, educational level, smoking, BMI, and hy-
pertension.Inaddition,weassessedinteractionswithrace,sex,
obesity, and ApoE4 phenotype, as well as between physical ac-
tivity and television viewing. We also evaluated associations
between patterns of activity and cognitive performance in lin-
ear models. The level of significance was set at P < .05. SAS,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for all analyses. Data
analysis was performed June 1, 2014, through April 15, 2015.
Results
At baseline (year 0), the mean (SD) age of the CARDIA partici-
pants was 25.1 (3.6) years, 1836 (56.5%) were female, 1771
(54.5%) were white, and 3015 (92.9%) had completed at least
high school. A total of 528 (16.3%) participants met the crite-
ria for a long-term pattern of low physical activity and were
more likely to be black (314 [59.5%]) compared with those re-
porting moderate to high physical activity (1162 [42.7%];
P < .001). Participants with low physical activity were more
likely to have hypertension (25 [4.7%]; P < .001) and had a
slightlylowereducationallevel(mean[SD],13.7[2.2];P < .001)
and drank less alcohol (10.7 [21.8]; P = .001) (Table 1).
Compared with participants with moderate to high long-
term patterns of physical activity, those with low physical ac-
tivity were more likely to have poor cognitive performance at
midlifeontheDSST(low,21.6%vsmoderatetohigh,14.5%;odds
ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.28-2.04) and Stroop test (low, 16.2%
vs moderate to high, 12.3%; OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.78) but not
on the RAVLT (low, 22.1% vs moderate to high, 19.5%; OR, 1.17;
95% CI, 0.93-1.47) (Table 2). After adjusting for age, race, sex,
educational level, smoking, alcohol use, BMI, and hyperten-
sion, the association between low physical activity and poor
cognitive performance remained significant for the DSST
(OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.90). The results of linear models were
consistent with cognitive impairment models.
In a sensitivity analysis, we further adjusted for ApoE4,
which did not significantly alter the results. In addition, there
were no significant interactions with race, sex, obesity, or
ApoE4 for the association between physical activity patterns
and poor cognitive performance (P > .05 for all). We also in-
vestigated patterns of very low or almost no physical activity.
Only 53 of the participants (1.6%) reported very low patterns
of physical activity, and after multivariable adjustment (re-
ported as OR [95% CI]), associations with the DSST (2.43 [1.23-

When physical activity patterns and television viewing
time were combined, 2473 participants (76.2%) reported the
most active patterns of moderate to high physical activity and
low to moderate television viewing, 667 individuals (20.5%)
reported intermediate patterns with low physical activity and
low to moderate television viewing or moderate to high
physical activity and high television viewing time, and 107
participants (3.3%) reported the least active patterns of low
physical activity and high television viewing time. In
adjusted models (results reported as OR [95% CI]), partici-
pants with the least active patterns of physical activity and
television viewing were more likely to have poor cognitive
performance on both the DSST and Stroop test (DSST, 1.95
[1.19-3.22]; Stroop test, 2.20 [1.36-3.56]) (Figure) compared
with those who reported the most active patterns. The asso-
ciation with the RAVLT was elevated but not significant (1.39
[0.87-2.22]). Participants reporting intermediate patterns
also had elevated odds of poor cognitive performance on the
DSST (1.57 [1.23-2.00]).

physical activity and high television viewing time) were the
most likely to have poor cognitive function.
Previous longitudinal investigations of physical activity in
midlife and late life support our findings.13,32,33 These earlier
studies indicated that low physical activity levels are associ-
ated with poor cognitive performance and cognitive decline
inolderadults.ResultsfromtheslightlyolderBritish1946birth
cohort34 suggest that greater leisure time physical activity in
adults during their mid-30s contributes to less cognitive de-
cline during middle age (43-53 years). A few other studies11,12
have also investigated the effects of physical activity partici-
pation at earlier ages, but these relied on retrospective mea-
sures. In one investigation,11 regular early life physical activ-
ity was associated with better information processing speed
in men but not women; in the second study,12 older women
who reported more physical activity during adolescence were
also less likely to develop cognitive impairment based on a
global test of cognition. Similar results were reported in a small
retrospective study35 of postmenopausal women in whom
long-term, moderate physical activity beginning in early
adulthood was associated with better cognitive function in late
life. In CARDIA,13 change in cardiorespiratory fitness in young
adulthood was also associated with psychomotor speed at
midlife, and a more recent prospective study36 examined the
association between leisure time physical activity through-
out life and midlife cognitive function. Although the mea-
sure of leisure time activity was not standardized and pat-
terns of activity over time were not assessed, the study found
that participation in leisure time physical activity (defined as
participationinsportsasachildoradolescentandregularsport
or exercise as an adult) for 4 or more days each week was as-
sociated with better memory and executive function com-
pared with no leisure time physical activity.
Studies of physical activity and cognitive function among
adolescentsandyoungadultshavefocusedmainlyontheacute
benefits for cognitive function.37 In small trials38-40 that have
been limited to short time periods, physical activity among
young adults improved visuospatial memory, executive func-
tion, and processing speed. In cross-sectional, observational
studies,41-43 regular physical activity was also associated with
better cognitive function in young adults, but the long-term
effects of physical activity on cognitive function during this
life stage are unclear.37
Physical activity during young adulthood may preserve
cognitive function and contribute to cognitive reserve by in-
creasing neurogenesis as well as synaptic plasticity, particu-
larly in regions associated with executive function and pro-
cessing speed, but physical activity may also affect other risk
factors for cognitive impairment, including cardiovascular risk
factors, inflammatory factors, and depressive symptoms.44,45
Observational studies46-49 in middle and late age have also re-
ported correlations between physical activity and higher mea-
sures of total brain and gray matter volume as well as lower
Î²-amyloid levels in the brain. Although some studies50 have
reported differences in the association of physical activity
with Alzheimer disease risk and amyloid deposition by
ApoE4 status, we did not find an interaction between physi-
cal activity patterns and ApoE4 phenotype. It is possible
that physical activity affects cognition through nonâApoE4-
associated pathways, or there may be differences in this
association by age.
To our knowledge, this study is also one of the first to re-
portanadverseassociationbetweenincreasedtelevisionview-
ingtimeinearlyadulthoodandmidlifecognitiveperformance.
Increasing evidence suggests that sedentary behavior, such as
television viewing, is associated with cardiovascular disease,
obesity, and mortality in adults,51,52 and television viewing in
young adulthood has also been associated with worse cardio-
metabolic risk factors in middle age.53 In addition, television
viewing in middle-aged and older adults has been identified as
a risk factor for cognitive impairment,54-56 but the content and
degree of cognitive engagement may be an important aspect of
this behavior to consider.18,57
Theeffectsoftelevisionwatchingoncognitivefunctionmay
involveseveralcomplexpathways.Physiologicstudies58-60sug-
gest that sedentary behaviors, such as television viewing, ad-
versely affect metabolic function by increasing blood pressure
as well as lipid and glucose levels. Television viewing may also
be associated with different cognitive and social patterns, de-
pression,andpoordietarypatterns.61-63Theassociationofphysi-
calactivityandsedentarybehaviorswithcognitivefunctionmay
also be bidirectional,64 and reverse causation could contribute
to the observed associations.65 Even though we did not per-
form baseline cognitive testing, given the young age of the par-
ticipants at study enrollment and the fact that they remained
in the study for 25 years, it is unlikely that they had clinically
significant cognitive deficits.
The CARDIA Study is a well-characterized, large, diverse
cohort with follow-up data on measures of physical activity
from more than 20 years. It is one of the first studies to exam-
ine the longitudinal association between physical activity and
sedentary behaviors and cognitive function in a younger
cohort with carefully repeated measures. However, there are
a few limitations to consider. Although the retention of

Models were adjusted for age, race, sex, educational level, smoking, alcohol use,
body mass index, and hypertension. The most active (reference) group had a
long-term pattern of moderate to high physical activity and low to moderate
television viewing time; the intermediate group had a long-term pattern of
moderate to high physical activity and high television viewing time or long-term
pattern of low physical activity and low to moderate television viewing time;
and the least active group had a long-term pattern of low physical activity and
high television viewing time. DSST indicates Digit Symbol Substitution Test;

CARDIA participants was high over the 25 years of the study,
it is possible that there was some selection bias owing to loss
tofollow-up.Bothphysicalactivityandtelevisionviewingwere
self-reported. In addition, we were limited to examining the
effects of television viewing and were unable to consider cog-
nitively stimulating sedentary activities, such as video games.
Although we assessed the domains of executive function, pro-
cessing speed, and verbal memory, not all cognitive domains
were evaluated.
The findings in this study suggest the need for additional
investigation in several areas. In particular, early adulthood
maybeacriticalperiodtopromotephysicalactivityforhealthy
cognitiveaging,especiallyasphysicalactivitylevelsduringthis
life stage track with activity levels in later life.10,66 More re-
search is also needed to understand the association between
screen-based sedentary behaviors and cognitive function, es-
pecially clarification of the mechanisms of this association, ex-
ploration of the full range of sedentary behaviors, and pos-
sible effects independent of physical activity. Regarding
population-based health, the effect of sedentary behavior may
be especially consequential because the use of screen-based
technologies for work and leisure has increased in the past sev-
eral decades.4,14
Conclusions
Our results indicate that the lifestyle behaviors in early adult-
hood that were evaluated in this study could have an effect on
the risk of cognitive impairment in midlife and support a po-
tential role for both physical activity and sedentary behavior
as modifiable risk factors for prevention. Individuals with both
low physical activity and high sedentary behavior may repre-
sent a critical target group.
