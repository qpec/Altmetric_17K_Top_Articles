 of the intermediate T-T− after the first C–C bond
breakage, T− after the second C–C cleavage, and
the final product of repaired base T. The various
dissections are shown in Fig. 3, D, F, and H, and
fig. S4. Thus, we obtained the ultrafast electron
hopping of FET3 in 6, 11, and 15 ps and the
electron return after repair in 437, 2890, and
819 ps for AnPL, DmPL, and AtPL, respectively.
Knowing the total QYs (Fig. 1C), we can also
derive the second C–C cleavage in 87, 48, and 36
ps and the futile back electron transfer BET2 in
1138, 149, and 527 ps, respectively, for three PLs
(table S1).
To recapitulate, we have identified 10 elemen-
tary steps in the repair reaction by DNA photo-
lyase, including 7 ET steps, and measured their
time scales in real time (table S1). Consequently,
we can calculate the QY of each step that con-
tributes to the total QY (table S2). In Fig. 4, A and
B, we show the two resolved photocycles for class
I AnPL and class II AtPL, respectively, with the
corresponding reaction times of each step. For
class I PL (Fig. 4A), the two systems we studied,
AnPL and EcPL, show a dominant tunneling
pathway with the highest QYs (table S2). For
class II PL (Fig. 4B), the two systems studied
here, DmPL and AtPL, adopt mainly a two-step
hopping route, also with good repair efficiency.
For other PLs [class III CcPL and ssDNA-specific
AtPL (AtCRY3)], both tunneling and hopping
channels are operative (table S1). These detailed
dynamics and time scales for seven ET reactions
involved in repair can be used to derive micro-
scopic pictures of various reorganization ener-
gies; their relevant reduction potentials; and,
thus, reaction driving forces (table S3) (21, 24, 25).
We did not observe clear evidence for the possible
flickering resonance for the initial electron bi-
furcation, as proposed recently in a theoretical
study (26).
Figure 4C shows the repair QYs along the
evolutionary path from the microbial class I to
the eukaryotic class II PLs, with initial electron
bifurcation into the tunneling route FET2 and
the hopping path FET1 and their resulting QYs
(QY2 and QY1). Clearly, the tunneling route in
class I leads to a higher repair QY. With the
decrease in the rates of tunneling, the hopping
channel comes to dominate in class II PLs. Con-
sequently, class II PLs can never reach the class I
repair QY because the electron path at Ade−
also bifurcates into the repair channel to the
CPD and the futile path back to the original
ground state, both of which share similar hop-
ping rates. The conserved active-site configura-
tion and the folded flavin structure that occur
as a result of evolution in the entire photolyase-
cryptochrome superfamily (11–15, 27–30) are essen-
tial to ensure a unified electron-transfer mechanism
through electron path bifurcation into two oper-
ative routes for all CPD photolyases.

INFLUENZA
Role for migratory wild birds
in the global spread of avian
influenza H5N8
The Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses*†
Avian influenza viruses affect both poultry production and public health. A subtype H5N8 (clade
2.3.4.4) virus, following an outbreak in poultry in South Korea in January 2014, rapidly spread
worldwide in 2014–2015. Our analysis of H5N8 viral sequences, epidemiological investigations,
waterfowl migration, and poultry trade showed that long-distance migratory birds can play
a major role in the global spread of avian influenza viruses. Further, we found that the
hemagglutinin of clade 2.3.4.4 virus was remarkably promiscuous, creating reassortants
with multiple neuraminidase subtypes. Improving our understanding of the circumpolar
circulation of avian influenza viruses in migratory waterfowl will help to provide early warning
of threats from avian influenza to poultry, and potentially human, health.
I
n 2014, highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) virus of the subtype H5N8 caused
disease outbreaks in poultry in Asia, Europe,
and North America (1–3). Avian influenza
viruses are a threat both to global poultry
production and to public health; they have the
potential to cause severe disease in people and
to adapt to transmit efficiently in human pop-
ulations (4). This was the first time since 2005
that a single subtype of HPAI virus had spread
over such a large geographical area and the first
time that a Eurasian HPAI virus had spread to
North America. The rapid global spread of HPAI
H5N8 virus outbreaks raised the question of the
routes by which the virus had been transmitted.
The segment encoding for the hemagglutinin
(HA) surface protein of the HPAI H5N8 viruses is
a descendant of the HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Goose/
Guangdong/1/1996), first detected in China in
1996 (5). Since then, HPAI H5N1 viruses have
become endemic in poultry populations in sev-
eral countries. The H5 viruses have developed
new characteristics by mutation and by reassort-
ment with other avian influenza (AI) viruses, both
in poultry and in wild birds. In 2005–2006, HPAI
H5N1 spread from Asia to Europe, the Middle
East, and Africa during the course of a few months.
Although virus spread traditionally had been

 attributed to transport of infected poultry, in-
fectedpoultryproducts,orHPAI-virus–contaminated
materials, several observations in the 2005–2006
epidemic suggested that wild birds also might
have carried the virus to previously unaffected
areas (6).
A HPAI H5N8 virus with genes from viruses of
the influenza A (H5N1) A/Goose/Guangdong/1/
1996 lineage was first detected in birds at live
bird markets in China in 2010 (1). This HPAI
H5N8 virus was a reassortant virus with the HA
gene segment from HPAI H5N1 virus and other
gene segments from multiple other AI viruses
circulating in eastern China (1) and is now cat-
egorized as HPAI H5 virus clade 2.3.4.4 (7). This
clade is unusually promiscuous and has been
found in combination with six different neuramin-
idase (NA) segments, and multiple H5Nx viruses
may be circulating at the same time and in the
same region (8, 9). The propensity of HPAI H5
virus clade 2.3.4.4 to form novel subtypes capable
of rapid, global spread is a major concern.
HPAI H5N8 virus caused a large avian in-
fluenza outbreak in poultry in South Korea in
the winter of 2013–2014 and subsequently spread
to Japan, North America, and Europe, causing
outbreaks there between autumn 2014 and spring
2015 (table S1). However, it is not clear by which
routes HPAI H5N8 virus spread so rapidly around
the world. Although there have been reports on
parts of these outbreaks (1, 2, 10) and speculation
on possible routes of transmission (3), no com-
prehensive global analysis has yet been performed.
The goal of this study was to analyze the
available genetic, epidemiological, and ornitho-
logical data for evidence of the relative contribu-
tions from poultry trade and from wild bird
movements (3, 6) for the global spread of clade
2.3.4.4 during 2014–2015. For this purpose, we
performed phylogeographic analysis of HPAI
H5N8 viruses detected in wild birds and poultry
from this global outbreak. In addition, we ana-
lyzed migration patterns of wild birds found in-
fected with HPAI H5N8 virus, epidemiological
investigations of HPAI H5N8 virus outbreaks,
and poultry-trade records from countries where
HPAI H5N8 virus was reported (11).
Initial phylogenetic analysis was performed
using HA sequences from HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4
viruses of poultry and wild birds from around
the world between 2004 and 2015, including sub-
types H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N5, H5N6, and
H5N8. From 2004 to 2012, clade 2.3.4.4 viruses
were circulating predominantly in Eastern Asia
(China), with some transmission to Southeastern
Asia (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). During this period, trans-
mission involving domestic anseriformes (ducks
and geese) appears to dominate, although some
contribution from domestic galliformes (chick-
ens and turkeys) and short-distance migratory
wild birds (e.g., mallard ducks) is also evident
(Fig. 1). Unlike H5 segments from other clades,
which are mostly found as H5N1, the HPAI H5
segment of the clade 2.3.4.4 viruses reassorts
frequently, acquiring NA segments from cocir-
culating low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)
subtypes, including N5 (from 2006 to 2010), N2
(from 2008 to 2012), N8 (from 2010), and, more
recently, N6 (from 2013) (8). To indicate the host
species and regions in which the reassortments are
thought to have occurred, a reassortment measure
was calculated using the number of branches in
the posterior set of phylogenetic trees for which
the NA subtype changed while the host species
and region traits remained the same (normalized
by branch lengths). This measure suggests that
most of the observed reassortants were gen-
erated in domestic anseriformes (fig. S2), and
particularly domestic anseriformes in Eastern
Asia (China) within the time period 2004 to
2012 (fig. S3).
The time to the most recent common ancestor
(TMRCA) for the HA segment of all clade 2.3.4.4
HPAIH5N8 sequences wasestimatedas June 2010
[95% highest posterior density (HPD), January
to October 2010]; the TMRCA for the correspond-
ing NA segments was similar (September 2010;
95% HPD, April to December 2010). Clade 2.3.4.4
HA H5N8 sequences were found in two sub-
clades (Fig. 1). The smaller and earlier subclade
(a in Fig. 1) contained the first sequenced 2.3.4.4
HPAI H5N8 virus [A/Duck/Jiangsu/k1203/2010
(H5N8)]. The larger and more recent subclade
(b in Fig. 1) contained sequences from outbreaks
in South Korea and other countries included in
this study and caused multiple HPAI outbreaks
in 2014 and 2015 globally. The TMRCA of subclade
b was September 2013 for both HA (95% HPD,
July to November 2013) and NA (95% HPD, May
to November 2013). Consistent with earlier findings
(1, 10), the phylogeny indicates that HPAI H5N8
was introduced into South Korea by long-distance
migrant wild birds that acquired it from the pool
of HPAI H5 viruses circulating in domestic an-
seriformes in Eastern Asia (China), although we
formally cannot exclude the possibility that
HPAI H5 viruses were circulating in unsampled
locations (Fig. 1).
Distinct, well-supported clades were identified
in South Korea, likely originating in the trans-
mission of HPAI H5N8 viruses from long-distance
migrants to other wild and domestic birds (10).
Oneclade(cinFig. 1)wasancestraltotheEuropean
outbreak and another (d in Fig. 1) was ancestral
to the North American outbreak. Again, we cannot
exclude the possibility that viruses from these
subclades were present in unsampled locations.
More detailed phylogenetic analyses, using only
clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 HA sequences with location
coordinates (11), showed that the virus spread
along two main long-distance migration routes:
one from the east Asia coast/Korean peninsula,
north to the Arctic coast of the Eurasian con-
tinent, then west to Europe; and the other north
from the Korean peninsula, then east across the
Bering Strait, and south along the northwest
coast of the North American continent to Canada
and the United States (Fig. 2 and movie S1). The
reconstruction did not indicate any spread be-
tween Europe and North America. The TMRCA
for European HA segments was August 2014 (95%
HPD, July to October 2014), and September to
October2014(95%HPD,AugusttoNovember2014)
for the North American HA segments (table S2,
a and b). Similar results were found from anal-
ysis of the NA segments (table S2, c and d). There
were also four separate introductions into Japan,
the first estimated around February 2014 (ances-
tral date of single virus A/Chicken/Kumamoto/
1-7/2014), and then three more, all with TMRCAs
in October and November 2014. The sequences
from one Japanese introduction were most closely
related to sequences from Taiwan and those from

 another introduction to the Russian (A/Wigeon/
Sakha/1/2014) and European sequences.
The phylogenetic data were also used to infer
the ancestral host categories of the most recent
common ancestor of the European and North
American outbreak sequences, thus providing
evidence for which host type had introduced
the viruses into those areas (Fig. 3, figs. S4 and
S5, and table S2). The most likely ancestral host
category for the North American outbreak for
both HA and NA segments was long-distance
migrants (HA, 66%; NA, 84%). A similar result
was obtained for Europe (HA, 66%; NA, 70%).
Several wild bird species with known HPAI
H5N8 sequences were long-distance migrants
at different stages of their migratory cycle, de-
pending on time and place found (table S3): Five
of the nine species found in South Korea in winter
2013–2014 were long-distance migrants at their
wintering sites or on spring migration. Both in
North America and Europe, two of the four species
found in winter 2014–2015 were long-distance
migrants at their wintering sites or on autumn
migration (11)(tables S4 and S5 and fig. S6).
The April 2014 HPAI H5N8 virus outbreak in
Japan had different characteristics from the later
outbreaks in North America and Europe. The
Japan outbreak was the only one that was con-
temporaneous with the outbreak in South Korea,
and no wild birds were found positive for HPAI
H5N8 virus in Japan during that outbreak.
Qualitative analysis of data from outbreak in-
vestigations on affected poultry farms in North
America, Europe, and Japan (11) (table S6) showed
that the likelihood of virus introduction via con-
taminated water, feed, and poultry was negligible
(Germany). Furthermore, no links between the out-
breaks in one country and those in other countries
could be attributed to personnel contacts or

 trade of live animals, feed, or products of ani-
mal origin (Germany, Netherlands, United King-
dom, and Hungary). Many affected poultry farms
were located in areas where wild waterfowl are
abundant (Germany, Netherlands, United King-
dom, Italy, and Canada). Direct contact with in-
fected wild birds (United States) or indirect
contact with materials (e.g., bedding material,
boots, and wheels of vehicles) contaminated with
wild-bird feces was considered the most likely
route of introduction into poultry holdings (United
States, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom,
and Italy). In some outbreaks, the source of in-
fection was unknown or inconclusive (Japan and
Hungary).
We reviewed data from the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(12) for 2011 to 2013 on export and import of live
domestic ducks and chickens of affected coun-
tries to estimate the risk of spread of HPAI virus
from South Korea to other countries via the in-
ternational poultry trade (table S7). Data on the
export of live poultry from North Korea and
Mongolia, also in East Asia, were not available
from FAO. Although all countries (Japan, Canada,
United States, Germany, Netherlands, United
Kingdom, Italy, and Hungary) where HPAI H5N8
virus emerged between November 2014 and
February 2015 imported live chickens and live
domestic ducks in 2013, South Korea reported
the export of a low number of live chickens and
no export of live domestic ducks, although un-
reported cross-border trade cannot be excluded.
Nevertheless, based on these data, it seems un-
likely that international trade in live poultry
played a major role in the long-distance spread
of South Korean clade HPAI H5N8 virus in
2014–2015.
Our analysis, using four different sources of
data, indicates that the main routes of large-scale
geographical spread of HPAI H5N8 virus were
most probably via long-distance flights of infected
migratory wild birds, first in spring 2014 from
South Korea or other unsampled locations in the
region to northern breeding grounds and then
in autumn 2014 from these breeding grounds
along migration routes to wintering sites in North
America and Europe.
Recognition of a likely role of wild birds in the
spread of HPAI reinforces the need to improve
biosecurity on poultry farms and to exclude wild
birds from the immediate vicinity of poultry farms.
Culling wild birds and draining or disinfecting
wetlands would not be effective because these
viruses disseminate on rapid time scales over
very large distances, making reactive interven-
tions of this kind impractical and ineffective, as
well as contravening commitments made by sig-
natory countries to the Convention on Migratory
Species and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.
The potential role of wild birds in the circum-
polar circulation of influenza viruses does point to
the need to increase our knowledge about the
connectedness at the vast circumpolar (sub)arctic
breeding areas between migratory waterfowl pop-
ulations originating from different wintering areas.
Surveillance of waterfowl at the crossroads of mi-
gratory flyways to wintering areas in Europe, Asia,
and North America would inform epidemiological
risk analysis and provide early warning of spe-
cific HPAI threats to poultry, and potentially
human, health.

POLITICAL SCIENCE
How economic, humanitarian, and
religious concerns shape European
attitudes toward asylum seekers
Kirk Bansak,1,2* Jens Hainmueller,1,2,3*† Dominik Hangartner2,4*
What types of asylum seekers are Europeans willing to accept? We conducted a conjoint
experiment asking 18,000 eligible voters in 15 European countries to evaluate 180,000 profiles
of asylum seekers that randomly varied on nine attributes. Asylum seekers who have higher
employability, have more consistent asylum testimonies and severe vulnerabilities, and are
Christian rather than Muslim received the greatest public support.These results suggest that
public preferences over asylum seekers are shaped by sociotropic evaluations of their potential
economic contributions, humanitarian concerns about the deservingness of their claims,
and anti-Muslim bias.These preferences are similar across respondents of different ages,
education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across the surveyed countries.This
public consensus on what types of asylum seekers to accept has important implications for
theory and policy.
E
uropecurrently facesthe largest refugee crisis
since the Second World War. In 2015, Europe
received ~1.3 million new asylum claims (1),
and many more people are expected to flee to
Europe as conflicts in the Middle East and
other regions linger on. The number of migrants
trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea
who have been reported missing or dead totaled
3771 in 2015 alone (2), and this number is likely to
be higher in 2016 as asylum seekers embark on
new and even more dangerous routes to Europe
after the implementation of the refugee deal be-
tween the European Union and Turkey (3).
As more and more people flee war-torn countries
and persecution, refugee-receiving democracies
must confront a fundamental challenge: how to
honorinternational commitments—including treaties
like the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention—
to process asylum claims and provide shelter to
accepted refugees, while at the same time devel-
oping asylum policies that are supported by do-
mestic voters.
There is considerable heterogeneity in the ex-
posure of European countries to the asylum crisis
(Fig. 1). Whereas some countries, like Germany
and Sweden, process a large number of asylum
applications per capita, others, like the United
Kingdom and Czech Republic, share a compar-
atively small responsibility. Yet the migrant crisis
has been so severe that it has resulted in political
conflict and social tensions widely across Europe,
including extreme right-wing parties mobilizing
citizens around asylum issues (4), frequent arson
attacks on asylum centers (5), and the partial
closing of Schengen borders.
As the crisis threatens national solidarity, the
social contract, and continental unity, European
policy-makers face increasing public pressure
to find policy solutions. Although public pref-
erences may not always directly translate into pol-
icies, a sizable political science literature hasshown
that, in democratic countries, particularly salient
and high-profile public policies often respond
markedly to public opinion (6–8). In the context
of this study, a case in point is the recent “Brexit”
referendum in the United Kingdom in which the
public voted for the United Kingdom to exit the
European Union, a decision that has been attri-
buted to rising anti-immigrant backlash in the
United Kingdom (9). And whereas public opin-
ion is a crucial factor, a key problem for both
academic scholars and policy-makers alike is a
lack of knowledge as to why some native-born
citizens oppose and others support the welcom-
ing of particular asylum seekers.
A large literature has examined public attitudes
toward immigrants (10), ethnic minorities (11),
and Muslims (12, 13) in general, but far fewer
studies have looked at attitudes toward asylum
seekers (14–21). The latter studies have provided
important insights into the correlates of anti–
asylum seeker sentiment, but either they are limited
to particular countries or they rely on observational
data from standard survey questions that ask about
asylum seekers in general and do not use exper-
iments to differentiate between different types of
asylum seekers (22). Furthermore, they have most-
ly been conducted before the current asylum crisis.
There still exists very little systematic and experi-
mental evidence to inform the heated ongoing
political debates over asylum policies with the
voice of European voters. In particular, we lack a
comprehensive assessment that captures which
particular types of asylum seekers the European
public is willing to accept given the current crisis.
To provide such an assessment, we designed a
conjoint experiment and embedded it in a large-
scale online public opinion survey that we fielded
in 15 European countries (23). We used entropy
balancing (24) to reweight our sample data to
match the demographic margins from the pop-
ulations of each country. Details about the sam-
ple, design, and statistical analysis can be found in
the supplementary materials (SM) (25). All analy-
ses, except otherwise noted, were prespecified in
a preregistered analysis plan made available at
the Political Science Registered Studies Dataverse
(http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YUNKUL).
Conjoint experiments ask subjects to evaluate
hypothetical profiles with multiple, randomly va-
ried attributes and are widely used in marketing
and, increasingly, in other social science fields to
measure preferences and the relative importance
