Abstract
BACKGROUND—Blinatumomab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody construct that enables CD3-
positive T cells to recognize and eliminate CD19-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
blasts, was approved for use in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL on the 
basis of single-group trials that showed efficacy and manageable toxic effects.
METHODS—In this multi-institutional phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with heavily 
pretreated B-cell precursor ALL, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either blinatumomab or standard-of-care 
chemotherapy. The primary end point was overall survival.
RESULTS—Of the 405 patients who were randomly assigned to receive blinatumomab (271 
patients) or chemotherapy (134 patients), 376 patients received at least one dose. Overall survival 
was significantly longer in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group. The median 
overall survival was 7.7 months in the blinatumomab group and 4.0 months in the chemotherapy 
group (hazard ratio for death with blinatumomab vs. chemotherapy, 0.71; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.55 to 0.93; P = 0.01). Remission rates within 12 weeks after treatment initiation were 
significantly higher in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group, both with respect 
to complete remission with full hematologic recovery (34% vs. 16%, P<0.001) and with respect to 
complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery (44% vs. 25%, 
P<0.001). Treatment with blinatumomab resulted in a higher rate of event-free survival than that 
with chemotherapy (6-month estimates, 31% vs. 12%; hazard ratio for an event of relapse after 
achieving a complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery, or death, 
0.55; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.71; P<0.001), as well as a longer median duration of remission (7.3 vs. 4.6 
months). A total of 24% of the patients in each treatment group underwent allogeneic stem-cell

 transplantation. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 87% of the patients in the 
blinatumomab group and in 92% of the patients in the chemotherapy group.
CONCLUSIONS—Treatment with blinatumomab resulted in significantly longer overall survival 
than chemotherapy among adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. 
(Funded by Amgen; TOWER ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02013167.)
The Prognosis for Adults with Newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has 
improved over the past three decades. With the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens, 
complete remission rates are 85 to 90% and long-term survival rates are 30 to 50%.1–4 Still, 
most adults with B-cell precursor ALL will have a relapse and will die from complications 
of resistant disease or associated treatment. Among adults with relapsed or refractory ALL, 
remission rates are 18 to 44% with the use of standard salvage chemotherapy, but the 
duration of remission is typically short.5–10 A major goal in this population is to induce 
remission with sufficient duration to prepare for stem-cell transplantation.11 The median 
overall survival among patients with relapsed or refractory ALL ranges from 2 to 6 months, 
and 3-to-5-year survival rates are less than 10%.7–10,12 More effective treatment is needed 
for relapsed and refractory ALL in adults.
The B-lineage surface antigen CD-19 is expressed on the surface of more than 90% of B-cell 
precursor ALL blasts.13 Blinatumomab (Blincyto, Amgen) is a bispecific T-cell engager 
antibody construct. Blinatumomab binds simultaneously to CD3-positive cytotoxic T cells 
and to CD19-positive B cells, which allows the patient’s endogenous T cells to recognize 
and eliminate CD19-positive ALL blasts.14–16
Single-group trials have shown the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in the treatment of 
heavily pretreated Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–negative relapsed or refractory B-cell 
precursor ALL.17,18 In a pivotal, multicenter, single-group, phase 2 trial of blinatumomab, 
the rate of complete remission with complete or partial hematologic recovery was 43%, and 
the median overall survival was 6.1 months.18 We report here the results of a multinational, 
randomized, phase 3 trial that compared blinatumomab with standard chemotherapy in the 
treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.
METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN
In this prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial, investigators at 101 centers in 21 countries 
enrolled adults (18 years of age or older) with Ph-negative B-cell precursor ALL in any of 
the following stages: refractory to primary induction therapy or to salvage with intensive 
combination chemotherapy, first relapse with the first remission lasting less than 12 months, 
second or greater relapse, or relapse at any time after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. 
Additional eligibility criteria included more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow and an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less (on a 5-point scale, 
with higher numbers indicating greater disability). Key exclusion criteria were other active 
cancers, a clinically relevant pathologic condition of the central nervous system, isolated 
extramedullary disease, autoimmune disease, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of 
grade 2 or higher or active chronic GVHD, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation within 12

 weeks before randomization, autologous stem-cell transplantation within 6 weeks before 
randomization, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks before randomization, use of 
immunotherapy within 4 weeks before randomization, or ongoing use of investigational 
treatment.
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
All patients provided written informed consent. The trial was designed by Amgen in 
collaboration with the trial investigators. The trial protocol (including the statistical analysis 
plan), which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the 
investigational review board or independent ethics committee at each trial center. The first 
two authors and the last author prepared the first draft of the manuscript, with assistance 
from professional medical writers who were funded by Amgen. All the authors contributed 
revisions and had access to the data. All the authors vouch for the integrity and completeness 
of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Two authors who are employees of 
Amgen conducted the statistical analyses and contributed to the manuscript. An independent 
data and safety monitoring committee consisting of two clinicians and one biostatistician 
met regularly to review safety and efficacy data, which were provided by an independent 
statistician.
TREATMENTS
Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, with the use of an interactive voice-
response system to receive open-label treatment with either blinatumomab or standard 
chemotherapy (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). 
Randomization was stratified according to age (<35 vs. ≥35 years), previous salvage therapy 
(yes vs. no), and previous allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (yes vs. no). Patients in each 
treatment group were to receive up to two cycles of induction therapy; in addition, in each 
group, patients in morphologic remission (≤5% bone marrow blasts) were to receive up to 
three cycles of consolidation therapy, and patients in continued morphologic remission were 
to receive up to 12 months of maintenance therapy.
Induction and consolidation treatments with blinatumomab were administered in 6-week 
cycles; in each cycle, patients received treatment for 4 weeks (9 μg per day during week 1 of 
induction cycle 1 and 28 μg per day thereafter, by continuous infusion) and no treatment for 
2 weeks. Maintenance treatment with blinatumomab was given as a 4-week continuous 
infusion every 12 weeks. Patients in the blinatumomab group who had high tumor load 
during screening were to receive dexamethasone before the start of treatment to prevent the 
cytokine release syndrome (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). All patients in the 
blinatumomab group were to receive dexamethasone before their dose of blinatumomab to 
prevent infusion reactions (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and were to receive 
intrathecal prophylaxis for central nervous system disease according to institutional or 
national guidelines. Interruption or discontinuation of the dose of blinatumomab was 
required if neurologic events or other selected adverse events occurred (further details are 
provided in the Dose Modification section in the Supplementary Appendix); dose 
adjustment was permitted for patients receiving standard chemotherapy but was not required 
for specific events. Patients in the chemotherapy group received the investigator’s choice of

 one of the following four regimens: fludarabine, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with or without anthracycline; a high-dose cytosine 
arabinoside–based regimen; a high-dose methotrexate-based regimen; or a clofarabine-based 
regimen (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Protocol-specified therapy could be 
discontinued at any time after the first treatment cycle and the patient could subsequently 
undergo stem-cell transplantation if the investigator determined that such actions were in the 
patient’s best interest.
ASSESSMENTS
Complete remission was defined as 5% or less bone marrow blasts and no evidence of 
disease and was further characterized according to the extent of recovery of peripheral blood 
counts as follows: complete remission with full recovery (platelet count of >100,000 per 
microliter and absolute neutrophil count of >1000 per microliter), complete remission with 
partial recovery (platelet count of >50,000 per microliter and absolute neutrophil count of 
>500 per microliter), or complete remission with incomplete recovery (platelet count of 
>100,000 per microliter or absolute neutrophil count of >1000 per microliter). Minimal 
residual disease was assessed at one central laboratory for trial centers in the United States 
and Canada (64 patients) with the use of multicolor flow cytometry and at another central 
laboratory for other trial centers (341 patients) with the use of real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction of clonal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements 
with an assay sensitivity of at least 0.0001.19,20 Lumbar puncture was performed during 
each cycle to evaluate leukemic involvement of the central nervous system. Adverse events 
were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Serious adverse events included events that were 
fatal or life-threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in disability or 
incapacity, or resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect or were other medically 
important serious events such as an overdose. Adverse events of interest were identified by a 
steering committee.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary end point was overall survival, which was defined as the time from 
randomization to death from any cause. Key secondary end points included achievement of 
complete remission with full hematologic recovery within 12 weeks after initiation of 
treatment; achievement of complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic 
recovery within 12 weeks after initiation of treatment; and event-free survival (defined as the 
time from randomization until relapse after achieving a complete remission with full, partial, 
or incomplete hematologic recovery, or death). Other secondary end points included the 
duration of complete remission, minimal residual disease remission (defined as a minimal 
residual disease level below 0.0001), the rate of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, and 
adverse event rates. Final results for key secondary end points were to be tested in a 
hierarchical manner if the results of the primary end point were found to be significant. We 
calculated that an enrollment target of 400 patients and a total of approximately 330 deaths 
would give the trial approximately 85% power to detect a hazard ratio for death of 0.70 in 
the blinatumomab group as compared with chemotherapy at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05; 
this calculation was based on an assumed median overall survival of 4.2 months in the

 chemotherapy group8,9 and a 10% dropout rate. Two interim analyses were planned to assess 
a survival benefit when 50% and 75% of the planned deaths for the final analysis had been 
observed. The O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundary at the time of each interim analysis was 
calculated with the use of a Lan–DeMets alpha-spending function.21,22
Efficacy analyses included all patients who underwent randomization (intention-to-treat 
population). Safety analyses and efficacy sensitivity analyses included all patients who 
received at least one dose of trial treatment (as-treated population). Time-to-event estimates 
were calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, and treatment groups were 
compared by means of two-sided stratified log-rank tests. The treatment effect was 
expressed as a hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval, which was estimated with the 
use of a stratified Cox regression model. Remission rates were compared with the use of a 
stratified two-sided Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.
RESULTS
TRIAL POPULATION AND TREATMENT
Patients were enrolled from January 2014 through September 2015. After 75% of the total 
number of planned deaths for the final analysis had occurred, the independent data and 
safety monitoring committee recommended that the trial be stopped early because of benefit 
observed with blinatumomab therapy. The data cutoff date was January 4, 2016. Of the 405 
patients who underwent randomization, 376 received open-label trial treatment (267 of 271 
patients [99%] received blinatumomab and 109 of 134 patients [81%] received standard 
chemotherapy); less than 1% of the 271 patients in the blinatumomab group and 16% of the 
134 patients in the chemotherapy group withdrew consent before receiving treatment (Fig. 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 22 patients (8%) in the blinatumomab group 
and no patients in the chemotherapy group were continuing trial treatment at the time of the 
analysis. The chemotherapy regimen was fludarabine, high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with or without anthracycline for 49 patients (45%); a 
high-dose cytosine arabinoside–based regimen for 19 patients (17%); a high-dose 
methotrexate-based regimen for 22 patients (20%); and a clofarabine-based regimen for 19 
patients (17%). The two treatment groups had similar demographic and disease 
characteristics at baseline when all patients who underwent randomization were assessed 
(Table 1) as well when patients who did not receive the trial treatment were excluded (Table 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The median number of treatment cycles was 2 (range, 1 to 9) in the blinatumomab group and 
1 (range, 1 to 4) in the chemotherapy group. Consolidation therapy with trial treatment was 
administered to 32% of treated patients in the blinatumomab group and to 3% of treated 
patients in the chemotherapy group.
OVERALL SURVIVAL
For this prespecified interim analysis, 251 deaths were recorded. Overall survival was 
significantly longer in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group. The median 
overall survival was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6 to 9.6) in the

 blinatumomab group versus 4.0 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.3) in the chemotherapy group 
(hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.93; P = 0.01, which crossed the prespecified 
stopping boundary) (Fig. 1A), with a median duration of follow-up of 11.7 and 11.8 months, 
respectively. Overall survival curves for the blinatumomab and chemotherapy groups 
separated within 3 months and converged again between 15 and 18 months. Similar results 
were seen after exclusion of the data from patients who did not receive trial treatment (Fig. 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). When data were censored at the time of allogeneic 
stem-cell transplantation, the median overall survival was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.8) in 
the blinatumomab group and 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.9) in the chemotherapy group 
(hazard ratio for death, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.88; P = 0.004) (Fig. 1B). The 
transplantation-censored overall survival curves for the blinatumomab and chemotherapy 
groups separated within 3 months and did not converge again. Estimated survival at 6 
months among all patients who underwent randomization was 54% in the blinatumomab 
group and 39% in the chemotherapy group. The treatment benefit with respect to overall 
survival was generally consistent across key subgroups (Fig. 2A).
REMISSION RATES
Remission rates within 12 weeks after treatment initiation were significantly higher in the 
blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group with respect to complete remission 
with full hematologic recovery (CR, 34% vs. 16%; P<0.001) and with respect to complete 
remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery (CR, CRh, or CRi, 44% vs. 
25%; P<0.001) (Table 2). Remission rates consistently favored blinatumomab over 
chemotherapy across key subgroups (Fig. 2B). Among the patients who had complete 
remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery, 76% of the patients in the 
blinatumomab group and 48% in the chemotherapy group achieved a negative status (i.e., 
remission) for minimal residual disease (treatment difference, 28 percentage points; 95% CI, 
9 to 47).
EVENT-FREE SURVIVAL AND DURATION OF REMISSION
Among the patients who had complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete 
hematologic recovery, the median duration of remission was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.8 to 9.9) 
in the blinatumomab group and 4.6 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 19.0) in the chemotherapy 
group. For the key secondary efficacy end point of event-free survival, 6-month estimates 
were 31% in the blinatumomab and 12% in the chemotherapy group, and the hazard ratio for 
a relapse after achieving a complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic 
recovery, or death, was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.71; P<0.001) (Fig. 1C).
ALLOGENEIC STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION
A total of 24% of the patients in the blinatumomab group and 24% of the patients in the 
chemotherapy group underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, including 14% and 9% 
of patients, respectively, who achieved remission without the use of another treatment; 3% 
and 4% of patients who achieved remission with the use of an intervening anticancer 
therapy; 1% of patients in each group who had a relapse after having achieved complete 
remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery; and 6% and 10% of 
patients who did not achieve complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete

 hematologic recovery. Among the patients who achieved complete remission with full, 
partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery and who underwent allogeneic stem-cell 
transplantation, 10 of 38 patients (26%) in the blinatumomab group and 3 of 12 patients 
(25%) in the chemotherapy group died during a median follow-up period of 206 and 279 
days, respectively.
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse events were reported in 99% of the patients in each treatment group (Table 3, and 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Serious adverse events were reported in 62% of 
the patients in the blinatumomab group and in 45% in the chemotherapy group (Table 3, and 
Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). After adjustment for treatment exposure, the 
event rate for serious adverse events was 349.4 per 100 patient-years in the blinatumomab 
group and 641.9 per 100 patient-years in the chemotherapy group. Fatal adverse events were 
reported in 19% of the patients in the blinatumomab group and in 17% of the patients in the 
chemotherapy group (Table 3). Fatal adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the 
patients in either treatment group were sepsis (eight patients [3%] in the blinatumomab 
group and four patients [4%] in the chemotherapy group), septic shock (six patients [2%] 
and no patients, respectively), multiorgan failure (three patients [1%] and no patients), 
respiratory failure (one patient [<1%] and two patients [2%]), and bacteremia (no patients 
and two patients [2%]). Investigators considered fatal adverse events to be related to 
treatment with blinatumomab or chemotherapy in eight patients (3%) and eight patients 
(7%), respectively.
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 87% of the patients in the 
blinatumomab group and in 92% of the patients in the chemotherapy group (Table 3). The 
incidence of grade 3 or higher events of interest that were categorized as neutropenia or 
infection was lower with blinatumomab than with chemotherapy; in contrast, neurologic 
events of grade 3 or higher occurred at a similar rate in the two groups (Table 3, and Table 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rates of treatment discontinuation due to any 
adverse event were 12% in the blinatumomab group and 8% in the chemotherapy group, 
including 4% and 1%, respectively, due to a neurologic event and 1% and 0% due to the 
cytokine release syndrome. In the blinatumomab group, treatment interruptions were 
required, as specified in the protocol, for 32% of patients overall, including 7% for 
infections, 6% for neurologic events, 5% for the cytokine release syndrome, 3% for infusion 
reactions, and 3% for neutropenia. In the chemotherapy group, treatment interruptions were 
not required by the protocol but were reported in 6% of patients. In the blinatumomab group, 
events of interest in the category of the cytokine release syndrome were reported as serious 
adverse events in 4% of the patients and as events of grade 3 or higher in 5% of the patients.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized phase 3 trial involving adults with Ph-negative relapsed or refractory B-
cell precursor ALL, blinatumomab resulted in significantly longer overall survival than 
standard chemotherapy; the risk of death was 29% lower and the median duration of survival 
was 3.7 months longer in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group. Rates of

 complete remission with full hematologic recovery and complete remission with full, partial, 
or incomplete hematologic recovery were significantly higher with blinatumomab therapy 
than with chemotherapy, and the median duration of remission was longer. Adverse events 
that occurred in the blinatumomab group were consistent with those reported in previous 
trials. In single-group trials of blinatumomab,17,18 neurologic events and the cytokine 
release syndrome were identified as two adverse events of interest. In the current controlled 
trial, blinatumomab was associated with lower incidences of myelosuppression and 
associated complications than chemotherapy and was associated with higher incidences of 
serious adverse events, including neurologic events, the cytokine release syndrome, 
administration-site conditions, and procedural complications (Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). After adjustment for differences in treatment exposure between the two groups, 
the event rate for serious adverse events was lower overall in the blinatumomab group than 
in the chemotherapy group. Rates of neurologic events of grade 3 or higher were similar in 
the two groups. The cytokine release syndrome was reported in the blinatumomab group but 
usually did not require discontinuation of blinatumomab treatment. On the basis of efficacy 
and safety results from the planned interim analysis, the independent data and safety 
monitoring committee recommended that the trial be stopped early because of the overall 
survival benefit observed with blinatumomab as compared with chemotherapy. In an 
analysis of patient-reported outcomes in this trial that was reported separately,23 health-
related quality of life, patient function, and symptoms associated with blinatumomab as 
compared with chemotherapy were examined. In that analysis, the global health status and 
quality-of-life score improved in the blinatumomab group and worsened in the 
chemotherapy group, with a hazard ratio for deterioration in a time-to-event analysis of 0.67 
(95% CI, 0.52 to 0.87). Hazard ratios for other quality-of-life outcomes ranged from 0.59 to 
0.80 in favor of blinatumomab, with upper boundaries of the 95% confidence intervals that 
were less than 1.0 across all subscales and single items except for insomnia (95% CI, 0.62 to 
1.02).
Several surface antigens are expressed on B-cell precursor ALL blasts, which allows for the 
use of targeted therapies.24–26 CD20 is expressed on B-cell precursor leukemic cells in up to 
50% of patients.13,27 Rituximab, an unconjugated CD20 monoclonal antibody, had minimal 
efficacy in the treatment of B-cell precursor ALL, but its addition to intensive chemotherapy 
was associated with longer survival in both Burkitt’s leukemia and CD20-positive B-cell 
precursor ALL than was intensive chemotherapy alone.28–32 CD22 is expressed in more than 
90% of patients with B-cell ALL. Among patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, 
treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin (a CD22 monoclonal antibody conjugated to 
calicheamicin) resulted in higher rates of complete remission and higher rates of negative 
minimal residual disease than the rates seen with chemotherapy.33–35 Overall survival, a 
primary end point of the trial, was not significantly longer with inotuzumab than with 
chemotherapy at the prespecified boundary of P = 0.0208. Treatment with chimeric antigen 
receptor T cells that target CD19 was associated with complete remission rates of 70 to 90% 
and durable remissions in single-center trials involving patients who had minimal residual 
disease or overt relapse.36–38 Combinations of targeted therapies have not been investigated.
This trial of blinatumomab versus chemotherapy differs in several ways from a recently 
reported trial of inotuzumab versus chemotherapy in relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor

 ALL.35 The median overall survival was 7.7 months in the experimental group in both trials, 
but when similar chemotherapy regimens were administered, the median survival was 4.0 
months in the current trial and 6.7 months in the inotuzumab trial, which suggests that the 
patient population in this trial had more aggressive disease than the population in the 
inotuzumab trial. Indeed, one in four patients in our trial received blinatumomab as third or 
later salvage therapy, whereas such patients were excluded from participation in the 
inotuzumab trial. No patient in the blinatumomab trial and 43% of inotuzumab-treated 
patients had a late first relapse (≥12 months after initial remission). Patients with high 
peripheral blasts (>10,000 per microliter) at baseline were permitted to receive 
blinatumomab in this trial but could not receive inotuzumab in the other trial. The 
percentage of patients who had undergone previous allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was 
35% in this trial and 16% for inotuzumab-treated patients. The inotuzumab trial included 
patients with Ph-positive ALL, whereas this trial did not. Collectively, these differences 
suggest that patients were at greater risk of death and complications in this trial than in the 
inotuzumab trial. Thus, the efficacy results for blinatumomab and inotuzumab should not be 
compared across trials. However, both trials highlight the potential for directed therapies for 
patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL to reduce the need for prolonged, 
intensive chemotherapy.
Patients in the blinatumomab group who achieved complete remission with full, partial, or 
incomplete hematologic recovery had a higher incidence of response with respect to minimal 
residual disease than did patients in the chemotherapy group, which highlighted the depth 
and quality of remissions achieved with blinatumomab. Although minimal residual disease 
status during a patient’s first complete remission has emerged as the most important 
prognostic factor in the initial treatment of ALL in children and adults,39,40 its value as a 
prognostic factor in relapsed or refractory ALL is less well established. In this trial, the use 
of two central laboratories with different methods for assessing minimal residual disease 
may have introduced a variable that could limit interpretation of the trial. Nevertheless, the 
introduction of targeted immunotherapy for patients who remain positive for minimal 
residual disease during their first complete remission may improve the prognosis of such 
patients.
In summary, this large, randomized trial of single-agent immunotherapy with blinatumomab 
shows a significant survival benefit as compared with chemotherapy in adults with Ph-
negative relapsed or refractory ALL. Blinatumomab resulted in significantly higher rates of 
hematologic remission and longer survival than chemotherapy. Given the previous exposure 
of these patients to myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive treatments, the activity of an 
immune-based therapy such as blinatumomab, which depends on functioning T cells for its 
activity, provides encouragement that responses may be further enhanced and made durable 
with additional immune activation strategies.

 Figure 1. Efficacy End Points
Panel A shows the probability of overall survival in the two groups. Overall survival was 
calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause. The median duration of 
follow-up for overall survival was 11.7 months in the blinatumomab group and 11.8 months 
in the chemotherapy group. Panel B shows the probability of overall survival in the two 
groups (also calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause) when data 
were censored at the time of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. The median duration of 
follow-up for this analysis of overall survival was 7.0 months in the blinatumomab group

 and 6.0 months in the chemotherapy group. Panel C shows the probability of event-free 
survival, which was calculated as the time from randomization until relapse after complete 
remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery, or death; patients who did 
not achieve a complete re-mission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery 
were assigned an event-free duration of 1 day. The median duration of follow-up for event-
free survival was 7.8 months in the blinatumomab group and 10.2 months in the 
chemotherapy group. All three analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population. 
P values were determined by means of stratified log-rank tests.

 Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses
Panel A shows the results of an analysis of overall survival in prespecified subgroups of the 
intention-to-treat population that were defined according to baseline characteristics. Overall 
survival was calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Panel B 
shows the results of an analysis of remission rates in prespecified subgroups of the intention-
to-treat population that were defined according to baseline characteristics. The remission 
rate was defined as the percentage of patients who had complete hematologic remission with 
full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery by week 12. For both analyses, bone 
marrow blast data were from the central laboratory, if available; otherwise, data from the 
local laboratory were used. Central and local baseline results for bone marrow blasts were 
missing for one patient in the blinatumomab group.

*Data are summarized for all patients who underwent randomization (intention-to-treat population). Complete remission was defined as 5% or less bone marrow blasts and no evidence of disease and was 
further characterized according to the extent of recovery of peripheral blood counts as follows: complete remission with full recovery (platelet count of >100,000 per microliter and absolute neutrophil count 
of >1000 per microliter), complete remission with partial recovery (platelet count of >50,000 per microliter and absolute neutrophil count of >500 per microliter), or complete remission with incomplete 
recovery (platelet count of >100,000 per microliter or absolute neutrophil count of >1000 per microliter).
†Rates were compared with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, with adjustment for the following stratification factors: age (<35 vs. ≥35 years), previous salvage therapy (yes vs. no), and previous 
allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (yes vs. no).
