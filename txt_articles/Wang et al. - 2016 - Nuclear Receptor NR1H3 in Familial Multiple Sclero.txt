SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease
characterized by myelin loss and neuronal dysfunc-
tion. Despite the aggregation observed in some fam-
ilies, pathogenic mutations have remained elusive. In
this study, we describe the identification of NR1H3
p.Arg415Gln in seven MS patients from two multi-
incident families presenting severe and progressive
disease, with an average age at onset of 34 years.
Additionally, association analysis of common vari-
ants in NR1H3 identified rs2279238 conferring a
1.35-fold increased risk of developing progressive
MS. The p.Arg415Gln position is highly conserved
in orthologs and paralogs, and disrupts NR1H3
heterodimerization and transcriptional activation of
target genes. Protein expression analysis revealed
that mutant NR1H3 (LXRA) alters gene expression
profiles, suggesting a disruption in transcriptional
regulation as one of the mechanisms underlying MS
pathogenesis. Our study indicates that pharmaco-
logical activation of LXRA or its targets may lead to
effective treatments for the highly debilitating and
currently untreatable progressive phase of MS.
INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating
and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS. Immune-mediated
destruction of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes is consid-
ered the primary pathology in MS (Meffre et al., 2015). However,
axonal pathology and neuronal loss are responsible for the onset
of the progressive phase of the disease and neurological
dysfunction (Dutta and Trapp, 2007). MS affects over two million
people worldwide and is more than twice as prevalent in females
as males. At disease onset, the majority of patients present re-
lapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), which is characterized by sudden
onset of clinical symptoms followed by partial or complete
recovery/remission. In contrast, patients suffering from primary
progressive MS (PPMS) have an accumulation of irreversible
neurological symptoms from clinical onset (Weinshenker et al.,
1989).
MS was originally considered an autoimmune disease trig-
gered by exposure to environmental agents; however, family
and twin studies have clearly demonstrated the existence of a
genetic component implicated in the disease (Fagnani et al.,
2015; Sadovnick, 1993). Some genetic risk factors, primarily
related to the immune system, have already been identified
through association studies (Beecham et al., 2013). However,
associated variants have a minor effect on overall disease risk
and cannot account for the clustering of biological relatives
with MS in families.
The identification of genes and mutations responsible for
Mendelian forms of disease provides mechanistic insight into
disease ontology and spurs the generation of physiologically
relevant cellular and animal models, and the development of
novel therapeutics to better treat and halt disease progression.
To identify pathogenic mutations for MS, we applied exome
sequencing analysis to a multi-incident family (MS1) consisting
of 11 individuals over three generations, with DNA available
for nine family members, including five diagnosed with MS (Fig-
ure 1). In addition, we analyzed the functional consequences of
the identified variant and its implication in the mechanism of MS
pathogenesis.
RESULTS
Identification of NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln in MS Patients
Exome sequencing analysis on MS1 III-1 and III-3 (Figure 1)
identified 48,333 and 47,681 variants, respectively. Of those,
37 missense substitutions with a minor allele frequency (MAF)
below 1% in public and proprietary databases of variants
were found in both patients (Table S1, available online). Sanger
sequencing of amplicons containing these variants in 185 con-
trols and all nine MS1 family members for whom DNA was
available resulted in the exclusion of 33 variants. These vari-
ants did not segregate with disease (n = 27) or were identified
at a frequency over 1% in healthy controls (n = 6). The

 remaining four variants were genotyped in a case-control
series consisting of 2,053 MS patients and 799 unrelated
healthy controls; three variants (rs34326043, rs146468598,
and rs138130331) were identified at similar frequency in
patients and controls and were excluded from further analysis
(Table S1). Only one variant, rs61731956 (GenBank: NM_
005693.3; c.1244G>A, p.Arg415Gln) in nuclear receptor sub-
family 1, group H, member 3 (NR1H3), was not identified in
controls but was found in one additional proband from an un-
related family (MS2; Figure 1). Segregation analysis in MS2
identified the NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln mutation in one additional
family member diagnosed with MS, one unaffected sibling,
and two obligate carriers of unknown affection status. Haplo-
type analysis of NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln using an Illumina MEGA
array and microsatellite markers spanning 3.3 Mb between
D11S1385 and D11S1326 confirmed a common haplotype
in both families (Table S2), indicating that they are likely to
descend from a common ancestor in whom the mutation
originated. To ensure that additional mutations in this shared
haplotype
were
not
overlooked,
exons
with
fewer
than
five exome sequencing reads were analyzed by Sanger
sequencing. SNP array data within this haplotype were used
to exclude copy-number variants as potential disease cause.
Despite the relatively small size of these two pedigrees, link-
age analysis resulted in a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD)
score of 2.20 (q = 0) for NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln, thus highlighting
the co-segregation of this mutation with disease and suggesting
this genomic region as the disease locus for these families. Path-
ogenicity is also supported by a high level of conservation in
orthologs and paralogs resulting in a genomic evolutionary rate
profiling (GERP) score of 5.13 (Figure 2). Additionally, a gluta-
mine substitution is predicted deleterious on protein structure
and function (SIFT = 0.00; Polyphen-2 = 1.00). Despite the link-
age, conservation, and in silico predictions, the presence of
seemingly unaffected obligate carriers and one male sibling at
age 55 indicates that the penetrance of the mutation is incom-
plete, and additional genetic or environmental factors may be
required for the onset of MS.
Clinical Phenotype
Age at onset of disease for MS1 NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln carriers
ranges between 25 and 48 years, with an average age of
34.6 ± 10.1 years (SD) (Table S3). Detailed clinical information
was available for three family members (II-2, III-1, and III-2; Fig-
ure 1). Clinical course at the onset of disease for II-2 and III-1 was
consistent with PPMS. Although III-2 was initially diagnosed with
RRMS, her disease became progressive within 3 years of clinical
onset. The disease progression and severity for NR1H3 mutation
carriers is quite acute. II-2 presented an expanded disability sta-
tus scale (EDSS) score of 7 after 6 years and was deceased at
age 76, 28 years after the onset of clinical symptoms. III-1 was
paraplegic 16 years after onset with an EDSS score of 8 and
died at age 44. The EDSS score for III-2 was 5.5 two years after
the onset of disease, and 6.5 at year four. Detailed clinical infor-
mation was also available for MS2 III-1. The clinical phenotype
was similar to that of MS patients from MS1, as she was diag-
nosed with PPMS at age 30. Her EDSS was 5.5 at age 42
(12 years after onset). Clinical evaluations for seemingly healthy
mutation carriers were not available; therefore, we cannot
exclude the possibility that these family members developed
MS at a later age or present a forme fruste not clinically ascribed
to MS, such as radiologically isolated syndrome (Okuda et al.,
2009).
Genetic Analysis of NR1H3
To
assess
whether
additional
pathogenic
mutations
in
NR1H3 exist, we sequenced all coding exons in 836 probands
diagnosed with PPMS or from multi-incident families. This
analysis identified three previously reported silent changes
(rs2279238,
p.Ser99Ser;
rs145536921,
p.Gly137Gly;
and
rs141865811,
p.Pro276Pro)
and
two
missense
variants
(rs778927489, p.Pro199His; and rs149895806, p.Ser440Cys)
in three probands. Segregation analyses of p.Pro199His and
p.Ser440Cys do not support a role in disease for either variant
(Figure S1).
To evaluate whether common variants in NR1H3 influence
disease risk, we genotyped five tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in an
MS case-control series consisting of 2,053 MS patients and
799 healthy controls. None of the variants analyzed were found
to significantly associate with disease risk after correction for
multiple testing (p > 0.01; Table 1). Since the clinical pheno-
type identified in MS1 and MS2 was consistent with pro-
gressive MS, we performed stratified association analysis by
clinical course. Detailed clinical information was available for
1,687 patients, with the majority presenting a clinical pheno-
type consistent with RRMS (74.9%) at the onset of disease;
the remainder were diagnosed with PPMS (25.1%). Analysis
of RRMS patients failed to identify an association with
NR1H3 tSNPs. However, a significant association between
rs2279238 and PPMS was observed (p = 0.004), with carriers
of the minor allele presenting a 1.35-fold increased likelihood
of developing progressive MS (Table 1). Albeit not statistically
significant, a trend toward association in PPMS patients
was also observed for rs11039149 (p = 0.060, odds ratio

(p = 0.020, OR = 1.59).
Dimerization Analysis and Transcriptional Regulation of
NR1H3 Target Genes
NR1H3 encodes liver X receptor alpha (LXRA), which forms obli-
gate heterodimer complexes with retinoid X receptors (RXRs)
(Edwards et al., 2002). The p.Arg415Gln mutation identified in
MS families is located on the surface of the heterodimerization
interface on the ligand binding domain (LBD) (Figure 3A). The
importance of this residue on the dimerization process with RXR
alpha (RXRA) was previously shown with an artificial p.Arg415Ala
mutant, which resulted in a complete loss of function (Shul-
man et al., 2004). In addition, this position is homologous to
p.Arg391Cys/Ser mutations in vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Figure 2),
which have been shown to cause vitamin D-resistant rickets by
destabilizing the dimerization with RXRA (Nguyen et al., 2006;
Whitfield et al., 1996). To evaluate whether the LXRA p.Arg415Gln
mutation has a similar detrimental effect on the dimerization with
RXRA, we performed binding assays with wild-type and mutant
LXRA. Pull-down studies corroborated the interaction between
RXRA and wild-type LXRA; however, heterodimerization between
RXRA and LXRA p.Arg415Gln was not detected (Figure 3B). Even

after the addition of LXRA (T0901317)
orRXRA (LG268)syntheticagonists,which
strengthen the interaction between wild-
type LXRA and RXRA, dimerization with
mutant LXRA was not observed (Figures
3B and S2). RXRA-LXRA heterodimers
bind to LXR response elements (LXREs)
regulating
gene
expression
(Lefebvre
et al., 2010). Luciferase reporter assays
indicate that deficient dimer formation re-
sults in the dysregulation of transcriptional
activation of LXR target genes (Figure 3C).
Under basal conditions, LXRE-containing
reporterplasmidsdid notshow differences
in
transcriptional
activation
between
constructs (ANOVA, p = 0.33, F2,9 = 1.26);
however, the activation of LXRA with
T0901317 led to a 3.1-fold increased
expression for wild-type LXRA (ANOVA,
p = 0.01, F2,9 = 7.82; Fisher’s, p = 0.004),
whereas a non-significant increase was
observed for LXRA p.Arg415Gln (Fisher’s, p = 0.30), indicating
that the mutation identified in LXRA results in a loss of function
and impaired transcriptional regulation (Figure 3C). To assess
the effect of p.Arg415Gln mutation on the expressions of endog-
enous LXRA target genes, wild-type and mutant LXRA were intro-
duced into neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. ATP-binding cassette,
sub-family A, member 1 (ABCA1), a well-established LXRA target
(Ghisletti et al., 2007), displayed �3.3-fold increased expression
in cells transfected with wild-type LXRA compared to vector or
p.Arg415Gln LXRA (Figure S3). Interestingly, ABCA1 expression
was comparable in cells transfected with vector, wild-type, or
mutant LXRA after the addition of T0901317, suggesting that
endogenous LXRA or liver X receptor beta (LXRB) is sufficient to
fully induce ABCA1 expression.
In addition to its role in transcriptional activation, LXRA also acts
as a negative regulator of gene expression in a SUMOylation-
dependent mechanism (Ghisletti et al., 2007). To assess whether
LXRA p.Arg415Gln disrupts transrepression, nitric oxide synthase
2 (NOS2) was quantified in microglial BV2 cells treated with lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS). Under basal conditions, both wild-type
and mutant LXRA transfections resulted in a similar reduction in
NOS2 compared to control (Figure S3). Similarly, no differences
in SUMOylation were observed between wild-type and mutant
950

 LXRA (Figure S4). The addition of T0901317 was shown to
enhance transrepression of NOS2, even in cells transfected with
empty vector, thus suggesting that the endogenous LXRA or
LXRB is sufficient to abolish NOS2 gene expression. Taken
together, these data indicate that the transrepression mechanism
of LXRA is likely unaffected by the p.Arg415Gln mutation.
DISCUSSION
The application of exome sequencing analysis in a family pre-
senting a Mendelian form of MS has led to the identification of
a pathogenic mutation in NR1H3. The p.Arg415Gln substitution
was identified in seven MS patients from two unrelated families
sharing a common disease haplotype (Table S2). The clinical
phenotype observed in these patients is consistent with an un-
usual form of MS with a relapsing-remitting onset that rapidly be-
comes progressive or PPMS. Although the mutation was not
observed in our healthy controls, it has been described in 21 in-
dividuals from the ExAC database (MAF = 0.0002), as well as
three obligate carriers and an unaffected biological family mem-
ber from this study, thus suggesting that additional genetic,
epigenetic, or environmental factors may be necessary to
develop disease. Therefore, these families appear to have a
highly susceptible NR1H3 genetic background for MS, but an
initial damage may be necessary to trigger the onset of disease.
This incomplete penetrance is not unexpected for a highly het-
erogeneous and multifactorial disease such as MS.
NR1H3, also known as LXRA, together with LXRB forms a sub-
family of nuclear receptors that control transcriptional regulation
of genes involved in lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and innate
immunity (Joseph et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002). The basic
structure of these nuclear receptors consists of two activation
domains (AF1 and AF2), a DNA binding domain, and an LBD
responsible for dimerization (Edwards et al., 2002). The LXRA
p.Arg415Gln mutation identified in MS families is located in
a highly conserved amino acid of its LBD, which is not only
conserved through speciation, but also present in the LBD of
RXRs and LXRA nuclear receptor paralogs engaging in physical
and functional interactions with RXRs (Figure 2) (Lefebvre et al.,
2010). The crystal structure of RXRA-bound LXRA has been
resolved (PDB: 2ACL) (Jaye et al., 2005), and the introduction
of the p.Arg415Gln mutation using PyMol highlights the impor-
tance of this positively charged residue, which is located in the
center of this heterodimeric complex and directly opposed to
the homologous arginine on RXRs (Figure 3). Although LXRA
and LXRB share significant homology (62.4% identity, 78.5%
similar), analysis of LXRA knockout mice indicates that LXRB
cannot compensate for its loss (Peet et al., 1998). The activation
of LXRs is dependent on the entry of naturally occurring oxyster-
ols, reactive molecules generated from the oxidation of choles-
terol, into the ligand-binding pocket of the LBD and dimerization
with RXR. This activated complex binds to cis-regulatory LXRE
and regulates the expression of genes that control transport,
catabolism, and elimination of cholesterol (Wang et al., 2002).
Cholesterol is an essential component of the CNS structure
and function, and plays a key role in signal transduction, synap-
togenesis, and neurotransmitter release (van de Kraats et al.,
2014). Cholesterol synthesis and transport in oligodendrocytes

 is essential for optimal myelination and remyelination, and defec-
tive homeostasis has been implicated in several neurological dis-
eases, including MS (Chalmin et al., 2015; Leoni and Caccia,
2011).
Neuropathological
examination
of
LXRA-LXRB
double
knockout mice has shown several brain abnormalities, including
axonal atrophy, neuronal loss, astrogliosis, and lipid accumula-
tion (Wang et al., 2002). These animals also present a significantly
increased expression of myelin protein zero (MPZ) and peripheral
myelin protein-22 (PMP22) transcripts but a decrease in myelin
proteins, resulting in thinner and disorganized myelin sheaths
as well as deficient remyelination (Makoukji et al., 2011; Meffre
et al., 2015). The study of Schwann cell lines has shown that
the downregulation of peripheral myelin genes is mediated by
LXRs and oxysterols, and suggests that the LXR pathway has
a critical role in myelination by repressing the basal activity of
myelin genes and regulating cholesterol levels in peripheral
nerves (Makoukji et al., 2011; Shackleford et al., 2013).

LXRs and their ligands are also impor-
tant negative regulators of inflammatory
gene expression and the innate immune
response. LXRs regulate inflammation by
inhibiting the expression of inflammatory
mediators including interleukin-6, nitric
oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase 2
(Bensinger et al., 2008; Joseph et al.,
2003). Mechanistically, the anti-inflam-
matory effects of LXRs have been attrib-
uted to the inhibition of nuclear factor
kappa-B and STAT1-mediated signaling
pathways via transrepression (Glass and
Saijo, 2010; Li et al., 2011). LXRA-defi-
cient mice have been shown to be more susceptible to bacterial
infection due to accelerated macrophage apoptosis and a
reduced immune response (Joseph et al., 2004). In MS patients,
foamy macrophages and microglia containing myelin are abun-
dant in active lesions, and this internalized myelin has been sug-
gested as an LXR-RXR selective agonist that activates LXRs and
suppresses the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Bogie
et al., 2012). Although our results indicate that the p.Arg415Gln
mutation identified in MS patients does not have an effect in
LXRA-dependent transrepression (Figure S3), decreased auto-
activation of NR1H3, one of the primary targets of LXRA
(Pehkonen et al., 2012), may lead to an indirect reduction in
transrepression. To further elucidate LXRA p.Arg415Gln biolog-
ical outcomes and to discriminate between direct and indirect

We hypothesize that at the outset of disease, damage to
myelin sheaths in NR1H3 mutation carriers may produce an

 intensified inflammatory response due to the inability of the
innate immune system to suppress the expression of pro-inflam-
matory mediators. In addition, these patients may present
impaired remyelination of damaged axons due to the dysregula-
tion of peripheral myelin genes, resulting in chronic demyelin-
ation, neuronal loss, and progressive disease. This hypothesis
is supported by studies in experimental autoimmune encephalo-
myelitis, which have shown that mice treated with LXR agonists
have reduced clinical symptoms, cellular inflammation, and
demyelination, whereas LXR deficiency results in exacerbated
disease (Cui et al., 2011; Hindinger et al., 2006).
Pathogenic mutations in NR1H3 appear to be rare and are
unlikely to account for disease in more than one in a thousand
MS patients. However, the significant association between a
common NR1H3 variant in patients with PPMS (Table 1) and
the decreased mRNA expression observed in MS patients
(Liu et al., 2005) suggests that the LXRA signaling pathway is
not only important for Mendelian forms of MS, but also a large
portion of patients without a positive family history. Although ge-
netic and functional evidence supports a role for NR1H3 in the
pathogenesis of MS, it should be noted that exome sequencing
technologies do not efficiently sequence all target regions and
cannot identify copy-number variants. In addition, a change in
functional readout from a mutated protein does not ensure a
pathogenic outcome. Therefore, replication of our findings and
evaluation of NR1H3 variants in additional cohorts are warranted
to confirm a role in the onset of MS.
Despite the rarity of pathogenic mutations, they provide a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the
onset of MS and its clinical course. They are also instrumental
for the generation of physiologically relevant cellular and animal
models in which to study the disease pathways and develop and
assess therapeutic options. The central role of LXRs in the regula-
tion of cholesterol homeostasis has already triggered a growing
interest in LXR synthetic agonists for the treatment of atheroscle-
rosis, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative
diseases, among others (Xu et al., 2013). Although the therapeutic
use of these agonists has been hampered by serious adverse
effects,agonistswithmorefinitebiologicaleffectsareunderdevel-
opment (Temml et al., 2014). The implementation of cell-specific
drug delivery and release systems, and targeting the biological
pathwaysdisruptedspecificallyinNR1H3patients,mayovercome
some of these adverse effects and pave the way for new MS treat-
ments. The implication of the LXRA signaling pathway in MS, and
the p.Arg415Gln mutation, has now opened novel therapeutic
avenues for the currently untreatable progressive phase of the dis-
ease. Novel medications based on NR1H3 models are expected
to provide symptomatic relief and halt disease progression by
reducingthe inflammatory responseand promoting remyelination.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Participants
Multi-incident families and a case-control series consisting of 2,053 MS pa-
tients and 799 unrelated healthy control subjects from Canada were included
in this study. All samples were collected through the longitudinal Canadian
Collaborative Project on the Genetic Susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis
(CCPGSMS) (Sadovnick et al., 1998; Traboulsee et al., 2014). The ethical
review board at the University of British Columbia approved the study, and
all participants provided informed consent.
Genetic Analysis
We performed exome sequencing in two patients using Ion AmpliSeq exome
kits and an ion proton sequencer. Sanger sequencing was used to genotype
amplicons containing exome variants of interest and NR1H3-coding exons.
Variants segregating with disease and tSNPs were genotyped in MS patients
and controls using TaqMan probes. Statistical association was determined
using Fisher’s exact test, with p < 0.01 considered significant after Bonferroni
correction. The disease haplotype was resolved using an Illumina MEGA array
and microsatellite markers between D11S1385 and D11S1326.
Functional Analysis
HEK293 cells were co-transfected with RXRA and wild-type or mutant LXRA
(kindly donated by Dr. Makoto Makishima), and treated overnight with
T0901317 when indicated. Cell lysates and precipitates were immunoblotted
with FLAG or Myc antibodies. Luciferase reporter assays were used to evaluate
transcriptional activation by wild-type and mutant LXRA. Cells were co-trans-
fected with reporter plasmid containing an LXRE or an empty control plasmid
lacking LXRE (pGL-pl) (Cai et al., 2008), and wild-type LXRA, mutant LXRA, or
empty vector. The dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed, and the
luciferase activity was measured to reflect the effect on transcription activation.
Protein expression analysis for ABCA1 and NOS2 was performed in SH-SY5Y
cells following transfection with vector, wild-type LXRA, or p.Arg415Gln LXRA
in the presence or absence of LXRA agonist T0901317.
Detailed patient demographics and comprehensive methodology are pro-
vided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
