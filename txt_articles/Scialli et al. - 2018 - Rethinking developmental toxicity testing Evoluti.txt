Background: Current developmental toxicity testing adheres largely to protocols
suggested in 1966 involving the administration of test compound to pregnant labora-
tory animals. After more than 50 years of embryo-fetal development testing, are we
ready to consider a different approach to human developmental toxicity testing?
Methods: A workshop was held under the auspices of the Developmental and
Reproductive Toxicology Technical Committee of the ILSI Health and Environmen-
tal Sciences Institute to consider how we might design developmental toxicity testing
if we started over with 21st century knowledge and techniques (revolution). We first
consider what changes to the current protocols might be recommended to make them
more predictive for human risk (evolution).
Results: The evolutionary approach includes modifications of existing protocols and
can include humanized models, disease models, more accurate assessment and testing
of metabolites, and informed approaches to dose selection. The revolution could start

 with hypothesis-driven testing where we take what we know about a compound or
close analog and answer specific questions using targeted experimental techniques
rather than a one-protocol-fits-all approach. Central to the idea of hypothesis-driven
testing is the concept that testing can be done at the level of mode of action. It might
be feasible to identify a small number of key events at a molecular or cellular level
that predict an adverse outcome and for which testing could be performed in vitro or
in silico or, rarely, using limited in vivo models. Techniques for evaluating these key
events exist today or are in development.
Discussion: Opportunities exist for refining and then replacing current developmental
toxicity testing protocols using techniques that have already been developed or are
within reach.

INTRODUCTION
In 1966, Edwin I. Goldenthal, Chief of the Drug Review
Branch at the US Food and Drug Administration, wrote a let-
ter to pharmaceutical companies about methods of evaluating
drugs for adverse reproductive effects. The letter started,
“During the past several years following the thalidomide epi-
sode, we have been recommending a study designed to deter-
mine the potential of drugs for producing adverse effects on
the reproductive process.” Attached to this letter were guide-
lines that outlined the three-segment protocol with which we
are now familiar. Goldenthal ended his letter with the state-
ment, “It must be realized that even these improved guide-
lines reflect merely the “state of the art” at the present time,
and undoubtedly further modifications will be needed in the
future as additional knowledge in this area is developed.”
Goldenthal understood that testing was intended to predict
human hazard and was not an end in itself.
In the more than 50 years since this letter was written,
additional knowledge has been developed, but the three-
segment study designs have remained, although there have
been some modifications in them introduced over the years
(International Conference on Harmonisation, 2005), and they
have been used for evaluation of nonpharmaceutical as well as
pharmaceutical chemicals. At present, testing is conducted in
one or two laboratory species using intact animals given the
test article by gavage, inhalation, dermally, or by subcutaneous
or intravenous injection, depending on the anticipated route of
human exposure and/or information about the kinetics of the
compound. An in vivo protocol commonly used to test for pre-
natal developmental toxicity (OECD, 2001) assesses malfor-
mations, structural variations, resorptions, and fetal growth in
litters of pregnant rats or rabbits exposed to a test compound
during the period of organogenesis. A vehicle-control and at
least three dose levels of the compounds are used, the highest
of which produces some minimal adult toxicity and the lowest
of which is a low-order multiple of the anticipated human
exposure level. Evaluation of pregnancy outcome often
involves removal of fetuses about one day prior to delivery
and evaluation of external, soft tissue, and skeletal alterations.
In other protocols, males and females are dosed prior to mating
and conceptuses evaluated after implantation, or pregnant ani-
mals are dosed and young are delivered and raised by their
mothers or by foster mothers with testing of offspring viability
and functional characteristics.
We wondered how we might design protocols for devel-
opmental testing of drugs and other chemicals if we were to
start over, using 21st century methodology to approach ques-
tions about the possible effects of xenobiotics on human
development. Would we end up with the same study design
involving the dosing of pregnant laboratory animals and
evaluation of embryos, fetuses, and pups, or might we adopt
a different approach?
Under the auspices of the Developmental and Reproduc-
tive Toxicology Technical Committee of the International
Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Health and Environmental Sci-
ences Institute (HESI), we held a workshop in April, 2017 at
which this question was explored. Conclusions of the work-
shop were presented at the 57th annual meeting of the Tera-
tology Society in June, 2017. We here summarize the
workshop presentations and discussions. Although the discus-
sions were directed primarily at developmental toxicity test-
ing, application of novel ideas to reproductive toxicity testing
can also be considered. We divided the ideas generated in the
workshop into those representing an evolution of existing
protocols to improve the predictive value of current whole-
animal test methods and those representing a revolutionary
approach starting from an animal-free testing design. The
lines between evolution and revolution can be blurred, and
we noted considerable overlap in some areas of discussion.

EVOLUTION
The revolution we discuss below is underway but not ready
to replace our original thinking. Whole-animal testing will be
important in developmental toxicity assessment for some
time to come. Are there ways we can improve the predictiv-
ity
of
whole-animal
testing
for
human
health
risk
assessment?
2.1
|
Humanized models
Insofar as we are using rodents and rabbits and sometimes
other species to support human risk assessment, can we
make our laboratory animal models more like human beings?
Humanized models include animals in which genes have
been edited, knocked out, or knocked in to make the genetic
substrate of the model more human-like while avoiding ethi-
cal concerns of human fetal tissue research. RNAs that mod-
ify translation of protein also can make an animal model
more human. Humanized models include the testing of surro-
gate molecules that more closely produce in the test species
the effects anticipated from the use of the molecule of inter-
est in human patients. For example, an antibody intended to
bind and inactivate a human cellular receptor might have no
activity on the analogous receptor in a mouse. A mouse in
which that receptor has been knocked out might be a suitable
model of the activity of the pharmaceutical candidate or,
alternatively, an antibody against the mouse receptor might
be useful to explore potential developmental effects of a dif-
ferent antibody against the human receptor (Enright et al.,
2011).
Challenges of using a humanized model include:
� Time and cost of developing the model;
� Use of a compound in testing that is not the compound
intended for marketing;
� Possible increase in use of animals due to the need to com-
plete standard embryo-fetal developmental studies in addi-
tion to studies using the humanized model;
� Lack of historical control data in an animal model that has
been altered;
� Lack of information on off-target toxicity;
� Alterations in the viability or health of genetically altered
animals;
� Lack of regulatory guidance when testing nonpharmaceuti-
cal chemicals.
The time and cost of developing a model continues to go
down. CrispR/Cas technology has shortened the time and
brought the cost to within reach of most academic laborato-
ries, but the characterization of altered animals, which has
never
been
straightforward,
has
only
become
more
complicated. Apparent inactivation of a gene in a knock-out
or otherwise altered animal model might lead to compensa-
tory mechanisms coming online. There may be differences
between the complete inhibition of a protein associated with
a knock-out and the partial inhibition associated with antici-
pated human therapy. Differences in gene activity between
heterozygotes and homozygotes will require determination of
which model is more appropriate for the expected therapeutic
scenario.
2.2

Disease models
Most pharmaceutical products are used in the treatment of
human disease. The testing of these compounds in healthy
animals may produce developmental toxicity that is irrele-
vant to the assessment of risk for pregnant women with a dis-
ease under treatment. A drug intended to restore normal
physiology in a disease may produce altered physiology in
healthy pregnant animals. An example is an antidiabetic drug
used to make blood glucose concentrations normal in a dia-
betic woman that might cause hypoglycemia, with conse-
quent developmental toxicity, when given to a healthy
pregnant animal (e.g., Hofmann, Horstmann, & Stamm-
berger, 2002). Other pharmaceutical products that might
restore normalcy in diseased women but produce toxicity in
normal animals include nutrients, hormones, vasoconstric-
tors, neurotransmitters, and immune modulators.
Healthy animals may not predict developmental effects
associated with disease. For example, obesity may enhance
susceptibility to developmental toxicity, and the use of nor-
mal weight animals to model obese women may fail to iden-
tify this enhanced susceptibility. Healthy animals may not
express the target for a pharmaceutical product. Examples of
missing targets include microorganisms in infection and
abnormal proteins in Alzheimer or Parkinson diseases (Bar-
row et al., 2017).
The use of animal models of disease in testing for repro-
ductive or developmental toxicity has not been addressed in
the literature in a systematic manner. It may be useful to con-
sider animal models used for discovery studies as subjects
for safety studies, but there are potential problems with the
use of diseased animals for these studies:
� Inducing the disease may introduce confounding factors.
For example, use of hyperglycemic animals for studies of
antidiabetic drugs requires the use of genetically hypergly-
cemic animals that have not been well characterized or the
use of chemicals that destroy pancreatic islet cells (e.g.,
streptozotocin).
� Increased use of animals may arise from the need to test
the drug in healthy models as well as disease models.
� Lack of a historical control database for diseased animals.
842 |
SCIALLI ET AL.
 � Diseased animals may not reproduce normally or at all.
There is unpublished experience in industry with models of
particular human diseases for which there has been abundant
product development. It would be useful to gather these
experiences in a published forum for consideration by scien-
tists in industry, academia, and government. The develop-
ment of historical control databases for diseased animals
(e.g., diabetic rats) would be useful.
2.3

Metabolites
The ability to accurately characterize metabolites of test com-
pounds in humans and experimental animals is an important
part of safety testing. However, pharmacokinetic data for
pregnant women is almost always missing for pharmaceuti-
cal products, and human toxicokinetic data are usually miss-
ing for nonpharmaceutical chemicals. Moreover, testing of
metabolites in pregnant experimental animals is usually con-
ducted at high dose levels, which may not reflect human
kinetics. This problem has been addressed to some extent by
read-across assessments (discussed more fully in section 3.1,
below) using data for structurally similar chemicals or the
development of mouse models with humanized livers, either
using whole liver or replacement of Phase I and II enzymes.
Not all compounds are metabolized by the liver, and use of
nonliver cell lines may improve the identification of addi-
tional metabolites.

Dose-response assessment
Dose setting, including the levels, frequency, and interval of
exposure, have a huge impact on dose response assessment.
Current developmental toxicity study designs are conducted
without attention to critical windows of development; there-
fore, the impact of exposure is considered to be uniform
across the entirety of development. There are cases when
suboptimal dose timing can miss a critical window and give
a false negative result; for example, use of a single bolus
dose of a chemical with rapid metabolism could preclude
exposure over the critical window. However, a number of
data types, including clinical studies (pharmaceuticals) or
human exposure studies (chemicals), in silico information,
and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (or toxicokinetic/
toxicodynamic) data, can be used to inform the optimal time
or critical windows of exposure, which in turn can be incor-
porated into dose setting.
Another aspect of dose setting is dose level selection,
which is typically based on adult systemic toxicity studies or
on a limit dose. However, dose range-finding data in the
appropriate population (e.g., pregnant dams or offspring) is
critical to establishing dose levels for developmental toxicity
studies. Further, dose range finding should approximate the
10% effect level for toxicity and should not include doses
that lead to excessive maternal toxicity (reviewed in Beyer
et al., 2011). In some regulatory systems, an upper level for
testing of 1000 mg/kg/day is used for nonpharmaceutical
chemicals, given the low likelihood that a human dose would
approach this level. Data-driven dose setting involving better
understanding of toxicokinetic properties provides a biologi-
cal basis for dose setting that often will give a lowered upper
limit dose for a given compound without a loss of confidence
in the safety of the testing strategy (Saghir et al., 2012).
Current guidelines for dose spacing typically recommend
three doses plus an untreated control. Dose-response model-
ing based on a small number of doses that may not include
the point of departure (POD) will not provide adequate infor-
mation to either determine the shape of the dose-response
curve or identify the POD (Bercu, Morinello, Sehner, Shipp,
& Weideman, 2016). The use of benchmark dose modeling
is preferable to the NOAEL/LOAEL approach, but does not
completely alleviate the dose spacing issue if dose levels are
not near the POD. The approach to dose selection when test-
ing mixtures presents further challenges; in some instances, a
real-world mixture may have set ratios (e.g., crude oil mix-
ture formulations), while, in other cases, a mixture could
exist in an infinite variety of dose combinations (e.g., phthal-
ate ester mixtures) in the environment.
Considering enhancements as part of the evolution of the
existing testing paradigm, dose setting should be designed based
on the available data and hypothesis-testing rather than simply
relying on the use of standard practices. In the ideal, dose setting
should be based on the internal dose and not the administered
dose and incorporate critical window information for the chemi-
cal or a mechanistically similar chemical. Dose-response meth-
ods should be used that allow for nonlinear curves (e.g.,
nonmonotonic dose response curves; Chevillotte et al., 2017)
because these have been observed for some chemicals with
developmental toxicity and for syndromes of mechanistically
related endpoints (e.g., the phthalate syndrome; US EPA, 2013).
In an animal-free testing approach, discussed in the next
section, a dose-response issue with the use of human cell
assays is that while animal to human extrapolation will be
removed, in vitro to in vivo data extrapolation will be intro-
duced. Other challenges will be building pathway-based
information that considers the impacts of nonchemical stres-
sors, multiple modes of action for a single chemical and
cumulative risk assessment for multiple, mechanistically
related compounds, and for complex mixtures. Dose-related
recommendations
for
the
coming
animal-free
testing
approaches include development of:
� a knowledgebase to predict dose response in whole tradi-
tional animal assays from genomics and other pathway-
level data, currently being performed in the pharmaceutical
sector;

 � methods for determining internal dose information in
animal-free assessments; and

Hypothesis-driven testing
The current testing environment uses the same models, often
pregnant rabbits, rats, and/or mice exposed to a test compound
during all or most of gestation with evaluation of fetuses just
prior to anticipated delivery, regardless of the compound being
evaluated. Yet, prior to developmental toxicity testing, there
may be substantial information available about the compound
or closely related analogs that could allow us to change the
study design to optimize the chance of predicting human
developmental toxicity potential. Hypothesis-driven testing is
the use of existing information about a chemical to generate
hypotheses that could be tested using customized models and
protocols. Modifications could be as straightforward as adjust-
ing the dosing regimen so that the internal dosimetry of the
chemical is more similar to human pharmacokinetics or choos-
ing a model that is pharmacodynamically more similar to
humans. Alternatively, modified testing could entail an entirely
different approach that does not involve Segment 2 (embryofe-
tal toxicity testing)-like protocols.
In the drug discovery and development process, much is
known about the activity of a compound. The developer usu-
ally knows the molecular target of the compound and possible
secondary targets, either identified by high-throughput recep-
tor binding/enzyme activity panels or inferred from in vivo
safety pharmacology protocols or other toxicology protocols
conducted prior to developmental testing. These data are gen-
erally not available for nonpharmaceutical chemicals, which
(except for pesticides) are not designed to have specific bio-
logical activity, but there is still information available to shed
light on the possible toxicity of a chemical including its relat-
edness to previously tested chemicals based on two or three-
dimensional structure, physical chemical properties, or with
relatively easily generated data on gene expression in a panel
of cell types or high-throughput screening. This kind of infor-
mation can be used to formulate and evaluate hypotheses
about the toxicity of a new, related chemical.
In most cases, the hypotheses will involve testing for the
mode(s) of action (the critical biological responses, usually
occurring at a molecular or subcellular level, that underlie an
adverse effect) of the chemical, which will of necessity
involve different test methods than the Segment 2 protocol.
The Segment 2 protocol, along with every other in vivo test-
ing protocol developed in the mid-20th century, has adverse
outcomes as the read-out. These adverse outcomes are the
end result of a series of pathogenic events that begin with
external exposure and compound-specific distribution in the
organism, followed by the interaction of an exogenous chem-
ical with an endogenous molecular target. While we are still
a long way from understanding all of the steps in these path-
ogenic (or adverse outcome) pathways, a considerable
amount is known about mode of action at the molecular and
cellular level, and there are methods available to test modes
of action.
There are several approaches for the prediction of possi-
ble molecular initiating events based on structure-activity
relationships (Wu et al., 2013), high throughput screening
(Judson et al., 2016; Kavlock et al., 2012), or toxicogenom-
ics (De Abrew et al., 2016). Information about key events
that result from the molecular initiating event may be less
certain, and questions about possible key events will be the
subjects of testable hypotheses. These hypotheses might be
tested in whole-animal models, but human cells or tissues
might offer less expensive and potentially more relevant
models for the questions at hand. Once the key events and
their quantitative (dose-response) relationships have been
characterized, prediction of the adverse outcome may be
straightforward based on experience with other compounds
operating through the same key events.
The use of analogs for predicting toxicity can be facili-
tated by large databases that are searchable by chemical
structure. There are databases with toxicology-relevant infor-
mation on hundreds of thousands of chemicals (e.g., EPA
ACToR database), including more than 23,000 entries for
developmental and reproductive toxicity data. Although con-
sideration of analogs has been used as part of read-across
(discussed below) for many years, read-across has been used
for the purpose of filling data gaps, and not as a prospective
exercise in hypothesis generation and test optimization.
A key component in the development of hypothesis-driven
testing is the understanding that there are a finite number of
modes of action involved in developmental toxicity. We do
not yet know all possible modes of action or the number of
pathways that could be involved, but we believe that these
pathways are knowable. There are, for example, a limited
number of ways in which retinoic acid signaling can be dis-
rupted, and developmental toxicity that is dependent on this
signaling could be predicted with targeted testing as discussed
below (Tonk, Pennings, & Piersma, 2015). Moreover, toxicity
pathways are likely interconnected as part of the physiological
network in the body, which should allow for selection and
monitoring of a finite number of key events sufficient for
establishing the overall toxicological profile of a chemical. We
will return to these networks in the next section.
Common modes of action can be inferred in some cases
from gene expression. For example, estrogen receptor ago-
nism can be predicted from gene expression and other studies
in vitro (Browne, Judson, Casey, Kleinstreuer, & Thomas,
2015; Daston & Naciff, 2010). Decisions can be made about
844 |
SCIALLI ET AL.
 a compound with suspected estrogen-mediated toxicity with-
out whole-animal testing, at least with regard to modes of
action for which estrogen receptor agonism is a key event and
with regard to potency/efficacy considerations. Confidence in
testing of steps in a mode of action will require that the full
range of possible modes of action has been considered; data
supporting this approach are increasingly available.
Questions remain about the relationship between expo-
sure level and response, particularly when the underlying
information about a chemical is based on toxicity data using
compounds other than the chemical of interest. Decisions
about acceptable levels of exposure will need to incorporate
an understanding about similarities and differences in toxico-
kinetics and disposition in target organs between the com-
pounds, and uncertainty factors will continue to be necessary
in decision-making about acceptable exposure levels. The
selection of uncertainty factors may be influenced by the
source of data, for example, in vivo, in vitro, in silico, or a
combination of sources.
Hypothesis-based testing in the pharmaceutical industry
considers the pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical use of
the drug in designing a testing strategy. Considerations
include both the effect of intended pharmacology and off-
target effects on embryo-fetal and post-natal development.
The intended clinical use informs exposure questions such as
whether therapy requires constant engagement with the tar-
get, for example by a dermal drug that needs to be present
24 hr/day or an antibiotic that needs to maintain a minimum
systemic concentration.
Figure 1 shows a case example illustrating the pharmaco-
kinetic profile of a potential therapeutic agent being devel-
oped
for
a
dermatological
indication
(Stanislaus
D,
unpublished). Because systemic exposure is necessary to
understand the hazard potential for a developing embryo, the
compound was given subcutaneously to rabbits twice/day and
four times/day. The same dose spread over 24 hr/day pro-
duced developmental toxicity that was not evident when
exposure was present for only half the day. Due to the unex-
pected developmental toxicity, further investigation of the tar-
get was conducted and it was found that microdeletions of the
chromosomal segments that contained this target produced
craniofacial malformations in humans. Adapting a standard
developmental toxicity study to test a hypothesis about the
kinetic requirements for toxicity allowed better understanding
of the hazard potential, leading to better decision making.
Nonpharmaceutical chemicals differ from pharmaceutical
products in that biological activity in humans is unintended
and physical performance or activity against insects, fungi,
or rodents is the primary focus for most of these compounds.
Physical hazards (flammability, explosive limits), low vapor
concentrations, and solubility can be challenges in toxicity
testing. Poorly characterized mixtures or complex reaction
products may show variability, and it may not be easy to
show that a material tested for toxicity in the lab is identical
to the marketed product (Daston et al., 2015).
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) supports read-
across, a procedure in which gaps in toxicology knowledge
about a compound may be filled using data from related com-
pounds based on biotransformation to common compounds
or similar properties of the related compounds (ECHA, 2017).
Read-across may reduce the need to test a compound in whole
animals, provided there are adequate data on a sufficiently
similar compound or series of compounds. Read-across can
be similar to the use of Quantitative Structure-Activity Rela-
tionships (QSAR) in inferring activity of a compound from
structural similarity to another compound or series of com-
pounds for which data are available.
The need for additional testing to characterize endpoint
specific hazards also can be assessed based on estimated
human exposures being below a threshold of toxicological
concern (TTC; van Ravenzwaay, 2011, 2012, 2017; Kroes
et al., 2004). The TTC method empirically derived a distribu-
tion of effect levels for maternal and developmental toxicity
for a large number of tested chemicals. Application of a
safety factor to the 5th percentile effect level gives an expo-
sure level below which adverse effects are unlikely for any
compound, tested or not. A related TTC scheme used struc-
tural chemical alerts to set TTCs for reproductive and devel-
opmental toxicity (Laufersweiler et al., 2012). Compounds
with low alerts had a TTC value of 131 lg/kg bw/day, and
those with high alerts had a TTC value of 3.1 mg/kg bw/day.
Using this method, estimated human exposures below these
levels would not require testing in whole animals.
In some regulatory systems, an upper level for testing of
1000 mg/kg/day is used for nonpharmaceutical chemicals,
given the low likelihood that a human dose would approach
this level. Hypothesis-driven testing involving kinetics could
explore the question of whether this limit dose could be low-
ered for a given compound without a loss of confidence in
the safety of the testing strategy (Saghir et al., 2012).

 Complex substances or mixtures can be grouped using
known toxicological characteristics of tested chemicals
within the mixtures or results from testing similar chemicals/
mixtures. A collection of compounds or mixtures represent-
ing worst-case scenarios could be developed to stand for
related materials that are predicted to have lower toxicity
potential. For example, a mixture of aliphatic compounds
with varying chain lengths could be represented by data for a
single compound within the mixture that is believed to have
the greatest toxicity potential (McKee, Nicolich, Roy, White,
& Daughtrey, 2014).

Toxicological pathway networks
Although a standard approach to considering adverse out-
come pathways assumes a linear, unidirectional scheme such
as shown in Figure 2, biological systems are more likely to
be complex, and adverse outcome pathways are intercon-
nected in multiple ways and directions (Browne, Noyes,
Casey, & Dix, 2017; Wittewehr et al., 2017; Figure 3). If we
envision all possible interconnected pathways involved in
development, we would get a very busy diagram. It is likely,
although that along the pathways leading to an outcome, cer-
tain steps would be particularly important, like rate-limiting
steps in a complex series of biochemical reactions. Figure 4
gives an example of how such a network might be displayed
with six key events, identified as stars, representing impor-
tant steps mediating toxicity. The development of advanced
computational methods and experimental models is required
for analyzing and integrating data generated for this purpose,
although it might not be necessary to know all the steps in
the complex pathways leading to development. Instead, it
might be sufficient to be able to test for the ability of a chem-
ical exposure to disrupt any of the six key steps. In this way,
a battery of six tests in an alternative model, perhaps in vitro
or in silico, would predict potential developmental effects of
a chemical, at least with respect to the outcomes shown. The
predictivity of testing a limited number of key steps would
need to be empirically verified.
The role of retinoic acid in embryo development gives
rise to an example of a network of adverse outcome path-
ways (Tonk et al., 2015). Retinoic acid is involved in cortical
neurogenesis, mediated by Wnt3a and in progenitor cell pro-
liferation, mediated by Fgf8. Neural tube patterning and axial

 pattern are mediated by additional families of genes. Excess
retinoic acid can be associated with heart defects, cleft palate,
anencephaly,
caudal
regression,
craniofacial,
and
limb
defects,
mediated
by
down-regulation
of
Dhrs3
and
Cyp26a1, 26b1, and 26c1. Insufficient retinoic acid has been
associated with craniofacial, cardiac, and limb malformations
associated with down-regulation of Rdh10 and Raldh2.
These relationships can be mapped as in Figure 4, giving a
multistep, interconnected network of processes that can be
evaluated in experimental systems that do not necessarily
involve intact mammalian organisms.
We have not arrived at a place where we can perform
testing of all developmental pathways at this level of detail,
but we are getting an idea of what that place will look like.
Table 1 is a list of the steps that will be necessary before we
are ready to reliably model human developmental toxicity
without the use or with only limited use of whole-animal
models.

In vitro and in silico approaches for
predictive toxicology
Predicting human developmental risk could in theory be
based entirely on the testing of human cells or tissues or
the in silico manipulation of models of human develop-
ment. Such a strategy was generally envisioned by the
National Research Council in the 2007 report, Toxicity
Testing in the 21st Century (National Research Council,
2007), and in the intervening decade, we have come much
closer than expected to making such testing a practical
reality.
The development of predictive models uses a large
amount of data such as has been developed by the Tox-
CastTM and Tox21 efforts (US EPA, 2017a,b). ToxCastTM
has evaluated more than 1000 chemicals using multiple
assays, and Tox21 includes data on many more chemicals
using fewer assays. The results of high throughput assays of
biochemical activities of hundreds of ToxCastTM chemicals
have been published, and the data are publically available
(Knudsen et al., 2011; Judson et al., 2016; Richard et al.,
2016;
https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-dash-
board). The evaluation of developmental pathways for a sub-
set of these chemicals has been performed using ToxCast
data and alternative models including zebrafish embryos and
human embryonic stem cells, providing an estimate of
concentration-related toxicity of these compounds in human
developmental systems (Kleinstreuer et al., 2011; Palmer
et al., 2013; Sipes et al., 2011).
Organotypic culture models under development will give
rise to modeling that is more physiological than can be
achieved with conventional monolayer cell culture. Organo-
typic models represent a three-dimensional framework of the
embryo and can be used for human cell-based recapitulation

 of key morphoregulatory pathways culminating in controlled
tissue fusion events, heterotypic signaling, epithelial–mesen-
chymal transition, vascularization, and biomechanical forces
(Knight, Sha, & Ashton, 2015; Knudsen, Klieforth, & Slik-
ker, 2017). Such models may supplant mammalian animal
studies focused on apical endpoints in favor of functional or
mechanistic outcomes in engineered micro-tissues and micro-
physiological systems that inform processes around some of
the stars in Figure 4.
Experimental models that reduce a complex biological
system to simpler assays have the benefit of facilitating quan-
titative evaluation of cellular and molecular responses to
chemical perturbation but at the drawback of eliminating the
cellular interactions and spatial dynamics that make an
embryo complex in the first place. When modeling develop-
mental processes and the toxicity that disrupts them, we need
to rebuild this complexity. Using computational methods, we
can rebuild the complexity cell-by-cell and interaction-by-
interaction. CompuCell3D, funded by NIH and EPA (http://
www.compucell3d.org/), is an open-source modeling envi-
ronment in which cells interact stochastically using rules
governing individual cell behaviors. Using this platform, a
computer model of somite development has been explored
with and without the traditional clock-and-wavefront mecha-
nism (Dias, de Almeida, Belmonte, Glazier, & Stern, 2014;
Hester, Belmonte, Gens, Clendenon, & Glazier, 2011). Other
embryological events that have been similarly modeled in
dynamical computer simulations including urethral fusion
during sexual diversification of the genital tubercle (Leung,
Hutson, Seifert, Spencer, & Knudsen, 2016) and fusion of
the secondary palatal processes (Hutson, Leung, Baker,
Spencer, & Knudsen, 2017). Manipulation of these dynamic
computer models can simulate exposures that interfere with
development; for example, the effects of perturbing the
androgen-dependent growth of the genital tubercle (Leung
et al., 2016) or the TGF/EGF switch that controls fusion of
palatal shelves (Hutson et al., 2017) can be used to predict
critical effects of chemical exposures.
An ultimate goal of integrative computational modeling
efforts is a predictive virtual embryo (Figure 5), a computer
system that will represent our understanding of embryogenesis
and permit the investigation of the singular or combinatorial
effects of perturbing components of human development
(Knudsen et al., 2017; https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/
virtual-tissue-models-predicting-how-chemicals-impact-devel-
opment). Challenges will include identifying all relevant sys-
tems that need to be modeled (for example, utero-placental
physiology) and identifying methods of determining the revers-
ibility of modeled adverse effects.
Using the results of modeling in regulatory implementa-
tion will require consideration of diversity at the genetic, cel-
lular,
and
organism
level.
Best-practice
and
global
harmonization guidelines will be important, and acceptance
by regulatory scientists will be important (Zaunbrecher et al.,
2017). The transition from a system that relies on whole-
animal testing to a system that is largely independent of
whole-animal testing will need to be carefully managed. The
expectation of perfection can mean that the revolution will
fail, and we need to decide how we will know that the model
is good enough to approximate reality.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Workshop participants were successful at identifying con-
cerns about and limitations of the existing protocols used in
reproductive and developmental toxicity testing. The consen-
sus was that the evolutionary means to reduce the concerns
and minimize the limitations, such as the use of humanized
models or disease models, were temporary measures that
would not be entirely satisfactory. A revolutionary transition
to the use of human cells, tissue, or computer simulations of
human development was generally seen as inevitable, but
careful development and validation of new methods of risk
assessment would require time and resources to increase con-
fidence in the ability to replace whole mammal studies and
improve human risk assessment. There was general opti-
mism, however, that we would be successful in replacing the
automatic use of whole animals with scientifically justified
and thoughtful developmental toxicity testing strategies, per-
haps in our own lifetimes, but that the revolution might be
based on incremental, evolutionary change rather than on a
cataclysmic retooling of the procedures we use.
