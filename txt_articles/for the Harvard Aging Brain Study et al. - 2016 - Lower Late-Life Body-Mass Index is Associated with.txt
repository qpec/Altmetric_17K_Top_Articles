Abstract
Background—Lower body-mass index (BMI) in late life has been associated with an increased 
risk of dementia, and weight loss has been associated with more rapid decline in Alzheimer 
disease (AD) dementia.
Objective—To explore the association between BMI and cortical amyloid burden in clinically 
normal (CN) elderly at risk for AD dementia.
Methods—Cross-sectional analyses were completed using baseline data from the Harvard Aging 
Brain Study, consisting of 280 community-dwelling CN older adults aged 62–90. Assessments 
included medical histories and physical exam, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission 
tomography (PET) amyloid imaging, and apolipoprotein E ɛ4 (APOE4) genotyping. For the 
primary analysis, a general linear regression model was used to evaluate the association of BMI 
with PiB retention. Covariates included age, sex, years of education, and APOE4 carrier status. 
Secondary analyses were performed for BMI subdivisions (normal, overweight, obese), APOE4 
carriers, and BMI × APOE4 interaction.

 Results—In the primary analysis, greater PiB retention was associated with lower BMI (β=
−0.14, p=0.02). In the secondary analyses, APOE4 carrier status (β=−0.27, p=0.02) and normal 
BMI (β=−0.25, p=0.01), as opposed to overweight or obese BMI, were associated with greater PiB 
retention. The BMI × APOE4 interaction was also significant (β=−0.14, p=0.04).
Conclusions—This finding offers new insight into the role of BMI at the preclinical stage of 
AD, wherein lower BMI late in life is associated with greater cortical amyloid burden. Future 
studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism behind this association, especially in those with 
lower BMI who are APOE4 carriers.

Introduction
An obesity paradox [1] exists in Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia. Midlife obesity can 
increase the risk of late-life dementia [2, 3], but lower late-life body-mass index (BMI) is 
also related to worse AD outcomes. Higher late-life BMI is associated with decreased risk of 
dementia [4, 5], better cognition [6], slower progression of AD [7], and decreased mortality 
[8].
Weight loss over the clinical course of AD has been shown in several large cohort studies 
[9–13]. Early reports focused on those only in the dementia phase of AD, but later studies 
have explored earlier stages of the disease [7]. Patients with AD enter the dementia phase at 
a lower weight, and this weight loss increases mortality [13].
A 2007 study has suggested that weight loss for all causes of dementia may start 10–20 
years prior to diagnosis [11]. Autopsy studies have reported that AD pathology has been 
associated with low body weight [14, 15]. An inverse relationship was reported by in studies 
using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for BMI and AD 
biomarkers, including cortical amyloid as measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron 
emission tomography (PiB-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta and tau 
markers [16–18]. Apolipoprotein ɛ4 (APOE4) may also be associated with weight loss in 
AD [19, 20].
In recent years, the concept of preclinical AD has been gaining traction leading to the first 
proposed research criteria for preclinical AD [21]. Based on these criteria, elderly 
individuals who are cognitively normal and have elevated amyloid as visualized by amyloid 
PET or measured in the CSF are hypothesized to be in the preclinical stage of AD. Using 
that definition, multiple recent studies have demonstrated greater rate of cognitive decline 
over time in cognitively normal individuals with elevated amyloid at baseline, especially in 
the presence of an APOE4 allele or proxies of neurodegeneration, when compared to 
individuals without elevated amyloid [22–25].
In the current study, we explored the relationship between BMI and cortical amyloid burden 
visualized by PiB-PET in clinically normal (CN) elderly participating in the Harvard Aging

 Brain Study (HABS), which leverages multi-modality imaging biomarkers and extensive 
clinical assessments in older adults at risk for preclinical AD. We aimed to investigate 
whether the obesity paradox is already evident in the preclinical phase of AD. Specifically, 
we hypothesized that in CN elderly, lower BMI will be associated with greater cortical 
amyloid burden, supporting the late-life component of the obesity paradox described above; 
this association will also be evident in the group of individuals with elevated amyloid burden 
above a specific threshold, consistent with the presence of preclinical AD; and this 
association will be modified by the presence of APOE4, such that APOE4 carriers with 
lower BMI will have greater amyloid burden.
Methods
Participants
Baseline data from 280 participants in HABS, a longitudinal observational study of normal 
cognitive aging and preclinical AD at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) were 
included in this study. Inclusion criteria for HABS were as follows: English-speaking, 
community dwelling, age 62–90, good general medical health as determined by a study 
physician after extensive review of medical history, and normal cognition based on a 
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [26] global score of 0, education-adjusted Mini-Mental 
State Exam (MMSE) [27] score of 27–30, and normal education-adjusted memory 
performance on the Logical Memory delayed paragraph recall of the Wechsler Memory 
Scale-Revised [28]. All participants underwent informed consent approved by the Partners 
Human Research Committee prior to undergoing study procedures.
The baseline visit involved a comprehensive review of participants’ medical, neurological, 
and psychiatric health to confirm their status as clinically normal. A survey of the medical 
history, a general physical and neurological exam performed by a study physician, vital 
signs, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging studies were completed for each participant. 
Exclusion criteria included serious and unstable medical, neurological, or psychiatric illness, 
substance use, history of traumatic brain injury, extensive cerebrovascular disease visualized 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale score of ≥ 
4. However, participants with stable, treated vascular risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, and diabetes, or cardiovascular disease were not excluded.
Body-Mass Index data
Each participant had their height measured in inches and weight measured in pounds. These 
values were then converted to metric units in order to calculate BMI, which is kilograms 
divided by meters squared. The study used the standard formula for calculating BMI as 
outlined by the National Institute of Health (NIH) [29]. BMI subdivisions for secondary 
analysis were also taken from NIH guidelines for application to participants’ baseline data. 
They were characterized as follows: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal (BMI 18.5–24.9), 
overweight (25–29.9), and obese (BMI > 30). Analyses using weight only and BMI-squared 
were also performed, and results were nearly identical to those using BMI (data not shown).

 APOE data
APOE4 genotyping was performed for each participant, and APOE4 carrier status was 
determined by having at least one APOE4 allele.
PET data
PiB has been used in the past decade to quantify fibrillar cortical amyloid burden. 
Participants underwent PiB-PET imaging at baseline at the MGH PET facility. C11-PiB 
synthesis and imaging, using a Siemens/CTI ECAT EXACT HR+ PET scanner (3D mode; 
63 image planes; 15.2 cm axial field of view; 5.6 mm transaxial resolution and 2.4 mm slice 
interval; 39 frames: 8 × 15 s,4 × 60 s,27 × 120 s), were performed as previously reported 
[30,[31,[32,[33]. Briefly, 8.5 to 15 mCi of C11-PiB was injected intravenously as a bolus 
with dynamic acquisition occurring for 60 min immediately after. PET data were 
reconstructed and attenuation corrected. PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) using the 
Logan graphical analysis technique (cerebellar grey reference) was calculated for an 
aggregate of cortical regions that typically have elevated PiB retention in AD dementia, 
including frontal, lateral parietal and temporal, and retrosplenial cortices. PiB retention was 
used as a continuous variable and was positively skewed. Therefore, higher PiB values may 
have given more weight to the analyses proposed. Log transformation improved the 
skewness, but results were essentially the same (data not shown).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 22. We employed general 
linear regression models incorporating BMI and PiB retention. The primary model evaluated 
the association between BMI (predictor of interest) and PiB retention (dependent variable) 
after adjusting for covariates. PiB was chosen as the dependent variable for ease of 
interpretation of BMI among standard controls for PiB.
Three secondary models were evaluated: 1) the association of continuous measures of BMI 
and PiB within BMI categories (normal, overweight, obese), 2) the association of continuous 
BMI and PiB within groups defined by APOE4 carrier status, and 3) the association of 
continuous BMI and PiB including an interaction term for BMI and APOE4 status.
Demographic covariates included age, sex, and years of education. All analyses were also 
adjusted for APOE4 carrier status, except for secondary model 2 in which groups were 
divided based on APOE4 carrier status.
Results
Baseline characteristics
All 280 subjects were clinically normal at baseline by CDR, MMSE, and logical memory 
score (see Table 1). They were on average college-educated, 59% female, and 73.7 ± 6.2 
years old. Twenty-nine percent were APOE4 carriers. Subjects were roughly average for the 
American population in terms of prevalence for hypertension (59%) and statin use (43%), 
but had less diabetes mellitus type 2 (9%) and active smoking (4%). BMI was normally

 distributed, with a mean of 26.9 (range 16.3–40.7). Mean cortical PiB retention was 1.17 
(range 0.95–1.82).
BMI subdivisions
Two-thirds of the sample was overweight or obese (Table 1). Only 2.5% (n=7) were 
underweight. These underweight participants were excluded from further BMI subdivision 
analyses given lack of power. The BMI distribution revealed 31.8% were normal weight, 
41.4% were overweight, and 24.3% were obese. APOE4 carrier status was nearly identical 
in all BMI subdivisions, about 30%. There was no significant difference in other baseline 
characteristics between BMI subdivisions except for age (overweight participants were older 
than normal participants who were older than obese participants, p=0.001).
Primary analysis
Lower BMI scores were associated with greater PiB retention (β=−0.14, p=0.02, model 
R2=0.19) in the linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, years of education, and 
APOE4 carrier status (see Figure 1). APOE4 carrier status was also significant in the model 
(β=0.38, p<0.001), with APOE4 carriers having greater PiB retention compared to non-
carriers as expected. None of the demographic covariates were significant. When PiB 
retention was dichotomized into positive (DVR≥1.2) and negative (DVR<1.2), BMI was still 
significant in the model, but more so in the PiB-positive group (β=−0.32, p=0.009, model 
R2=0.15).
Secondary analyses
Model 1 with BMI subdivisions revealed that the negative association (lower BMI scores 
associated with greater PiB retention) remained significant only in the normal BMI 
subdivision model (β=−0.25, p=0.01). Those in the overweight category (β=−0.15, p=0.08) 
and obese category (β=−0.10, p=0.47) did not have a significant relationship between BMI 
and PiB retention (see Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3).
Model 2 with APOE4 carrier status revealed that the BMI-PiB relationship is only 
significant in those who are APOE4 carriers (β=−0.27, p=0.02). The relationship in APOE4 
non-carriers was not significant (β=−0.07, p=0.33) (see Table 2 and Figure 4).
Model 3 added a BMI × APOE4 interaction term to the primary model in order to evaluate if 
the interaction is stronger than the main effect of BMI alone. This interaction term was 
significant (β=−0.14, p=0.04), whereas BMI alone was not (β=−0.05, p=0.45). As expected, 
APOE4 remained significant in the model (β=−0.38, p<0.001) (see Table 2).
Other secondary models were explored, including those divided by sex and PiB-positivity, 
but they were either not significant, as it was for the model divided by sex, or did not shed 
further insight into the BMI-PiB association (revealing similar results to those reported 
above).

 Discussion
We found that lower baseline late-life BMI was associated with greater PiB retention, a well-
established biomarker for cortical amyloid deposition and increased risk for future 
development of AD dementia. Our cross-sectional analyses included only CN elderly and 
support the result found in the study using the ADNI database, which analyzed CN, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD dementia participants [18]. Notably, our CN 
sample was about twice as large as the largest ADNI CN sample used in a study employing 
CSF measures of amyloid-beta [16], and despite having fewer participants with elevated 
amyloid burden in our sample due to not including participants with MCI and mild AD 
dementia, we were able to find an association with BMI. When divided into BMI categories, 
the association was only significant at lower (normal) BMI levels, as opposed to higher BMI 
levels (overweight and obese) in late-life, again consistent with the ADNI results. The 
relationship between BMI and PiB retention was also seen for those who are APOE4 
carriers, and the significant interaction of BMI with APOE4 in predicting PiB retention 
suggests another possible route for APOE4 to affect amyloid levels in the brain. These 
analyses support the obesity paradox that has been observed across different studies where 
mid-life higher BMI increases risk of dementia, while late-life lower BMI increases risk of 
dementia [1]. In the current study, the presence of high amyloid burden in cognitively 
normal elderly, which is consistent with the presence of preclinical AD, is the marker of 
increased dementia risk, and we are able to relate that directly to BMI. Furthermore, these 
findings demonstrate that BMI can be independently associated with amyloid status and has 
the potential to generate further hypotheses of biomarker dynamics in AD pathophysiology.
Change in BMI may reflect the presence of other alterations connected to preclinical AD. 
First, olfactory dysfunction [34] commonly occurs in those who eventually develop AD 
dementia. The connection between olfactory tracts and lower BMI likely centers around the 
medial temporal lobe, specifically the entorhinal cortex. This pathway warrants future 
analysis. We recently reported that among CN participants in the HABS cohort, which was 
used in the current analyses, in those with elevated cortical amyloid, there was an 
association between reduced entorhinal cortex thickness and worse odor identification [35].
Second, several studies have connected the syndrome of frailty to AD pathophysiology [36–
38]. Frailty is a well-established phenomenon in geriatric medicine wherein certain physical 
markers, such as lower BMI, slowed gait speed, and loss of grip strength, are independently 
related to poorer medical outcomes. In our sample, all subjects were found to be cognitively 
normal. As we follow these individuals over time we may determine if examining late-life 
BMI alone, eventually predicts who will develop frailty and possibly symptoms of AD.
Third, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in the entire spectrum of AD, including the 
preclinical stage [39, 40]. Those with lower BMI and higher amyloid burden may have been 
suffering from depressive symptoms prior to the onset of cognitive decline. Evaluating the 
effects of syndromal, and even subsyndromal psychiatric symptoms, in the preclinical phase 
may help further unravel this association between BMI and amyloid.

 Ultimately, exploring the relationship between BMI and amyloid burden could enhance 
ongoing AD clinical trials and future clinical care [21]. As a potential marker of disease, 
BMI may fit well into the current research scheme of preclinical AD as a way to quantify 
risk of progressing to later stages of AD. Combining multiple variables, including BMI, may 
help researchers to develop an AD risk score similar to those currently used in 
cardiovascular medicine. Bridging APOE4 with BMI may generate more hypotheses about 
AD pathophysiology [41].
The strengths of this study are the number of clinically normal adults who had amyloid 
burden measured by PiB PET, as well as the secondary analyses that evaluated APOE4 
effect and its interaction with BMI. HABS has been one of a handful of large studies 
successfully enrolling participants who were all clinically normal at baseline and 
characterizing them with multiple AD biomarkers to track longitudinal change. Future 
studies of BMI will be able to leverage this baseline data, as well as harmonize with other 
datasets that have been similarly structured. From the literature, we had hypothesized that 
APOE4 may play a role outside of its effect on amyloid, which led to this analysis with 
BMI.
It is important to note that our study had several limitations. All participants were eligible 
for enrolling into the study only if they were medically stable and did not have extensive 
cerebrovascular disease, which may have introduced a selection bias. However, the 
frequency of vascular risk factors in our participants was mostly comparable to that of the 
general population. The assessment of the combined effect of such multiple vascular risk 
factors on AD biomarkers is beyond the scope of the current study and will be the focus of 
future analyses. It is also reassuring that the inverse relationship between late-life BMI and 
PiB was also found in ADNI, a well-validated multi-center cohort.
Second, adiposity can be measured in many ways, and BMI is only one method [42–44]. 
Though BMI has been the most conventional way to measure adiposity, some researchers 
have begun to evaluate lean body mass and waist-to-hip ratio in connection to AD or other 
dementia syndromes. The goal in those studies has been to try to unravel some of the 
discrepancies between BMI levels in predicting future dementia. We agree that adiposity 
changes as one gets older, and future research may help to ascertain a more accurate 
measurement of adiposity.
Third, we have only begun to analyze BMI with AD biomarkers. Though PiB retention was 
used in this study, BMI may also have an association with other biomarkers, such as CSF 
Amyloid-beta, total tau, phospho-tau, in vivo tau PET imaging, as well as other PET and 
MRI measures. Analyzing whether lower late-life BMI scores predict greater tau burden in 
the neocortex may support the hypothesis that BMI and tau are associated. Assessment of 
the strength of the relationships between BMI, amyloid, and tau would also help to isolate 
the pathology in question.
Fourth, due to the known significant association between APOE4 carrier status and amyloid 
burden in CN elderly, there is a concern that these markers of AD are measuring the same 
thing. As expected, in our sample there was a strong association between APOE4 and PiB

 retention (p<0.0001). However, APOE4 explained only 15% of the variance of PiB 
retention. Therefore, although these two measures are clearly associated, they do have 
independent effects on individuals at risk for AD and it is statistically appropriate to include 
them in same model as we did in our attempts to determine the association with BMI.
Finally, the timing of change in BMI can be further analyzed by looking at participants in 
each of the preclinical stages of AD: stage 1 consists of presence of elevated amyloid only; 
stage 2 consists of elevated amyloid and evidence of neurodegeneration; and stage 3 consists 
of elevated amyloid, neurodegeneration, and subtle cognitive decline not significant enough 
to meet criteria for MCI [21]. One hypothesis is that BMI drops significantly in stage 3 
where minimal symptoms are present rather than stage 2, thus adding another phenotype that 
can be tracked in the clinical setting and incorporated into clinical trials. We currently do not 
have information about when participants’ weight started declining. This is a critical piece of 
information that likely explains much of the association we reported. Therefore, longitudinal 
follow-up focused on change in BMI, AD biomarkers, and cognitive function will more 
decisively confirm or refute the current cross-sectional results.
In summary, lower baseline late-life BMI was found to be associated with greater cortical 
amyloid burden in the HABS cohort of clinically normal older individuals, and this 
relationship was modified by APOE4 carrier status. Future longitudinal studies can further 
assess the association of BMI levels with amyloid, as well as other AD biomarkers.

Secondary analysis - BMI and PiB retention (DVR) association within BMI subdivisions. 
The scatter plot reflects raw values for ease of interpretation. Underweight (blue) subjects 
are reflected here at the far left, but linear extrapolation is not shown due to the low number 
of participants. Participants with normal BMI are green. Participants with overweight BMI 
are red. Participants with obese BMI are purple. BMI (body-mass index), DVR (distribution 
volume ratio), PiB (Pittsburgh Compound B).
