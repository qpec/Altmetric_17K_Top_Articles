Abstract
Nutrition has profound effects on ageing and lifespan. Caloric restriction is the major nutritional intervention that historically
has been shown to influence lifespan and/or healthspan in many animal models. Studies have suggested that a reduction in
protein intake can also increase lifespan, albeit not as dramatically as caloric restriction. More recent research based on nutri-
tional geometry has attempted to define the effects of nutrition on ageing over a broad landscape of dietary macronutrients
and energy content. Such studies in insects and mice indicate that animals with ad libitum access to low-protein, high-carbohy-
drate diets have longest lifespans. Remarkably, the optimum content and ratio of dietary protein to carbohydrates for ageing in
experimental animals are almost identical to those in the traditional diets of the long-lived people on the island of Okinawa.
Keywords: older people, caloric restriction, protein restriction, low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets, Okinawa, ageing biology
An established dietary mantra is that older people need to eat
more protein, even if they are not malnourished. The
primary focus of such advice is sarcopenia, although other
health benefits have been suggested including preventing
obesity and osteoporosis, and improving wound healing and
recovery from illness. This is based on the observation that
dietary protein can drive anabolic responses in the muscle,
and that these responses are impaired in older people [1–4].
These recommendations appear to be at odds with basic
research in animals and observational studies in humans
showing that low-protein or low-protein, high-carbohydrate
(LPHC) diets delay ageing and increase lifespan [5–7]. The
lifespan-extending effects of these types of diets are consist-
ent with current understanding of cellular mechanisms that
link nutrition with ageing biology.
The longest living people are the residents of the
Japanese island of Okinawa, who have as many as five times
more centenarians than other developed nations [8]. There
are many factors that contribute to their exceptional longev-
ity including mild caloric restriction, food quality, genes and
physical activity. The energy from their diets was derived
from 9% protein and 85% carbohydrates [9] (Figure 1).
These Okinawan values for dietary protein and the protein
to carbohydrate ratio (1:10) are very low and remarkably
similar to those that have been found to optimise lifespan in
recent animal studies of ageing [7].
The first experimental study of nutrition and ageing is
often attributed to McCay et al. [10] who in 1935 showed that
reduced access to food led to markedly increased lifespan.
This dietary intervention is called ‘caloric restriction’ and is
considered to be a robust and reproducible intervention for
delaying ageing and increasing lifespan [5, 11]. The McCay
publication set the scene for many subsequent animal studies
of ageing biology where the focus has been on reducing
food, macronutrients or other nutrients to delay ageing. This
type of approach is the opposite to much medical research

 which has tended to focus on the effects of supplementing
nutrients on health outcomes in older people. In most
caloric restriction studies, access to food is reduced by 10–
50% of ad libitum intake. The increase in maximum and/or
median lifespan with caloric restriction has been reported
across taxa from yeast, worms, flies, mice, rats and dogs; with
health and/or lifespan benefits reported in primates includ-
ing humans [5]. Although caloric restriction is not sustainable
for most people, there are a dedicated few worldwide who
have been practising long-term caloric restriction (some as
long as 15 years or longer) and who have subsequently shown
remarkably reduced risk for atherosclerotic disease, as well as
other improved risk factors for healthy ageing and longevity
[12], albeit with adverse effects such as reduced bone mineral
density [13]. Moreover, there is ongoing research underway
that is studying the effects of caloric restriction on biomarkers
of healthy ageing and longevity in humans [14]. Preliminary
results indicate that many of the benefits seen in animal
models, particularly in terms of reduced cardiometabolic risk
factors, are also seen in humans [15].
There have been major advances in the understanding of
the nutrient-sensing cellular pathways that link diet and
ageing (Figure 2). The key nutrient-sensing pathways include
those regulated by sirtuins (SIRT1), mechanistic target of
rapamycin (mTOR), 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) and insulin/insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1)/Growth Hormone (GH) [16]. Decreased
activity of mTOR and insulin/IGF-1/GH or increased activ-
ity of AMPK and sirtuins have beneficial effects on cellular
processes involved with ageing such as mitochondrial bio-
genesis, autophagy, cellular metabolism, oxidative stress,
genome maintenance and protein synthesis. These four path-
ways are thought to have evolved to allow organisms to
survive periods of food shortages by transferring resources
from reproduction to survival and cellular maintenance [17].
The ageing benefit of caloric restriction is the long-term side
effect of an active, programmed response to food shortages,
rather than simply a reduction in harms caused by nutrient
excess—although such excesses engender health costs in
their own right. Genetic, dietary or pharmacological manipu-
lation of nutrient-sensing pathways alters the rate of ageing in
animal models and their response to caloric restriction [18].
While modulation of these pathways provides a clear
mechanism linking caloric restriction to lifespan extension,
other factors may also contribute including periodic hunger,
altered gut microbiome, avoidance of captivity-related obesity,
altered circadian rhythm and reduced intake of individual
macronutrients. Although reduced intake of fat or carbohy-
drate has not been reported to contribute to the beneficial
effects of caloric restriction, there is evidence that some of the
benefits of caloric restriction are mediated by reduced protein
intake, and that protein restriction as a standalone intervention
can extend lifespan [6].
One of most influential early studies compared caloric re-
striction with 40% protein restriction in ad libitum-fed rats. The
caloric restricted rats lived 75% longer than controls, while the
protein restricted rats only had an increase in lifespan of 15%
[19]. There have been many other animal studies, and overall,
protein restriction has been concluded to contribute to some
of the benefits of caloric restriction. For example, 16 out of 18
rat and mice studies showed that protein restriction increased
maximum lifespan and in these positive studies lifespan was
increased by an average of 20%. It was concluded that protein
restriction contributes to about half of the life extension of
caloric restriction [20]. A recent meta-analysis of 145 animal
studies of caloric restriction found that the proportion of
protein intake was more important for life extension than any
reduction of calories [21].
In humans, a systematic review of 64 interventional and
observational studies did not find any conclusive evidence for
a link between protein intake and mortality, but did find sug-
gestive evidence that diets that are both high in protein and
low in carbohydrates are associated with increased mortality
[22]. In a widely reported and recent study of NHANES data,
high-protein diets (>20%) were associated with increased mor-
tality and cancer in subjects <65 years, but reduced risks over
65 years [23]. The risk seemed to be conferred by animal-
based protein and circulating IGF-1 levels. The evidence in

 humans is mixed with a suggestion that lower protein diets, at
least until old age, are linked with lower mortality.
On first appearances, it would seem straightforward to
measure health and ageing outcomes in animals and humans
on low-protein diets, which is at odds with the conflicting
results of many studies and reviews. However, nutrition is
complex and measuring the impact of individual components
of the diet does not take into account interactions between
nutrients or its impact on appetite and food intake [24]. The
health outcomes of a low-protein diet will depend upon
whether the protein is replaced by fat or carbohydrates.
Furthermore, protein is a major driver of food intake, whereby
low-protein diets generally increase food intake, while high-
protein diets reduce food intake (‘protein leverage’ [25]).
Therefore, any evaluation of the effects of dietary protein on
ageing needs to take into account the amounts and interactions
between all three macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates,
fat) and to carefully measure food intake, especially in ad
libitum-fed animals [26]. Recently, a type of nutritional geometry
called the Geometric Framework was developed to evaluate the
relationship between diet and outcomes such as lifespan across
broad landscape of macronutrient and energy intakes [24, 27].
In these experiments, animals are ad libitum-fed one of numer-
ous (typically 20–30) diets varying in protein, carbohydrate (and
fat in mammals) and energy content over a lifetime. The
methods and analyses are more complicated than traditional
one-nutrient-at-a-time manipulations, but necessary to disentan-
gle the effects of each macronutrient, energy intake and their
interactions on phenotypic outcomes including ageing.
Initially, this method was applied to study ageing in fruit
flies and showed that LPHC diets were associated with the
longest lifespan while total calorie intake under ad libitum
feeding conditions (i.e. without restricting food availability,
but rather manipulating caloric density of the food by dilu-
tion) had no impact on lifespan once individual macronutri-
ents were taken into account [28] (Figure 3). Following this
approach, we studied 858 ad libitum-fed mice on 25 diets dif-
fering in macronutrients and energy and found that, as with
the fruit fly, a LPHC diet was associated with the longest life-
span and the best late-life health as assessed by cardiometa-
bolic health and immune function [30, 31]. However,
low-protein, high-fat (soya bean oil) diets were associated
with poorer outcomes, emphasising the importance of
reporting all the macronutrients and their interactions—a
low-protein diet may have positive or negative outcomes de-
pending upon the macronutrient that replaces it and presum-
ably also the type and quality of the macronutrients’ sources.
In a recent review, we reported nine different studies, mostly
in insects, using nutritional geometry to study lifespan. These
studies confirmed that LPHC diets in ad libitum-fed animals are
associated with the longest lifespans. This conclusion was sup-
ported by many other indirect studies in animals and some
studies in humans [7]. The optimum protein to carbohydrate
ratio for lifespan across the different species is consistently
�1:10 or less, with �10% or a little less of total calories
coming from protein, i.e. remarkably similar to the Okinawan
ratio. Values of 5% of total energy as protein are associated with
loss of lean muscle mass and failure to thrive in mice when ac-
companied with low-energy density, suggesting that this is
below the viable dietary limit to maintain health. In humans, it
is notable that the Okinawans have among the lowest reported
values for dietary per cent protein in human populations with
an adequate food supply—at the other extreme, values in the
habitual diet of human populations do not exceed 25%, and
typically lie close to 15%, with the proportions of non-protein
energy coming from fats and carbohydrates varying substantial-
ly between populations [32, 33]. Animal data are paralleled by
the few human studies that have reported the protein to carbo-
hydrate ratio. In their meta-analysis, Pedersen et al. [22] reviewed
the effects of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets (HPLC),
which would be expected to be deleterious on the basis of the
animal studies. From five observational studies, they found a
suggestive relationship between increased all-cause mortality
and long-term HPLC diets. Two studies showed an increase in
type 2 diabetes mellitus and one an increase in cardiovascular
disease with HPLC diets. Where reported, animal-based protein
and diets had the worst effects, while plant-based proteins and
diets nullified or reversed the trends.
These animal and human studies seem to indicate that re-
ducing the amount and proportion of dietary protein can
delay ageing, and that dietary protein needs to be replaced by
healthy carbohydrates but not fat. The mechanisms linking
low-protein and LPHC diets with ageing are beginning to be
unravelled, and current results indicate that low-protein or
LPHC diets can act via some of the same pathways as caloric
restriction. In their study of NHANES data, Levine et al. [23]
found that IGF-1 mediated the relationship between diet,
mortality and cancer, and this was able to be replicated in a
mouse model. In mice, we found that mTOR activation was
decreased in LPHC diets in association with reduced circulat-
ing levels of branched chain amino acids [29]. Branched
chain amino acids are potent activators of mTOR, and this
result provided a simple mechanism linking low-protein

of dietary protein to carbohydrate associated with the longest

the longest lifespan (red) occurred with low-protein, high-

ciated with high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets.

 intake, low-circulating branched chain amino acids and inacti-
vation of mTOR. Intriguingly, the regulation of mTOR was
not only influenced by branched chain amino acids, but also
by the interaction between glucose and branched chain
amino acids, providing a clue as to why the ratio of dietary
carbohydrates and protein influences ageing. It is of note that
elevated branched chain amino acids are a marker of diabetes
mellitus in humans [34],but on the other hand, supplementa-
tion with branched chain amino acids has been reported to
increase lifespan in mice [35] and nematode worms [36], pre-
sumably despite activation of mTOR.
Improved nutrition is a major cause of increased human
lifespan in the last two centuries [37, 38], while poor diet is
the main risk factor for death and disability in present times
in developed nations [39]. There are converging results in
many studies that indicate that the reduction of access to
and/or intake of calories and/or protein delays ageing. This
is presumably because such deficiencies activate nutrient-
sensing pathways that have evolved to increase resilience in
times of famine and food shortage. Ad libitum access to food
that is low in protein and high in carbohydrates also increases
lifespan, and the optimum ratio of dietary protein to carbo-
hydrate—in a range of animals—matches the ratio that we
see in the traditional Okinawan diet. We have limited our
review to the effects of the total macronutrient and calorie
content of diet and have not focussed upon the type of
macronutrients nor other important nutritional factors. For
example, the health effects of low-quality versus high-quality
carbohydrates or animal- versus plant-based proteins are well
recognised: we are certainly not proposing that a high-
carbohydrate diet comes in the form of added simple sugars
or highly processed foods, which are major contributors to
excess energy intakes in modern dietary patterns. It is note-
worthy that the main source of carbohydrate in the tradition-
al Okinawan diet was the anti-oxidant-rich, nutrient-dense
sweet potato that was low in both calories and glycaemic load
[40], while other dietary factors may also be contributing to
their longevity [41]. Our conclusions that reducing the
amount and/or proportion of protein in the diet delays
ageing has broader societal significance given concerns about
the deleterious effects of production of animal protein for
food on climate change [42, 43] and the potential influence
of the commercial food industry on nutrition and health re-
search, publications and policy [44].
Key points
• Caloric restriction and protein restriction prolong life in
many animal models.
• Low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets maximise lifespan in
ad libitum-fed animals.
• The optimum ratio of protein to carbohydrates for ageing
in animals is nearly identical to the traditional Okinawan
diet.
