Abstract
Natural products found in Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as kratom, represent diverse 
scaffolds (indole, indolenine, and spiro pseudoindoxyl) with opioid activity, providing 
opportunities to better understand opioid pharmacology. Herein, we report the pharmacology and 
SAR studies both in vitro and in vivo of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (3), an oxidative 
rearrangement product of the corynanthe alkaloid mitragynine. 3 and its corresponding 
corynantheidine analogs show promise as potent analgesics with a mechanism of action that 
includes mu opioid receptor agonism/delta opioid receptor antagonism. In vitro, 3 and its analogs 
were potent agonists in [35S]GTPγS assays at the mu opioid receptor but failed to recruit β-
arrestin-2, which is associated with opioid side effects. Additionally, 3 developed analgesic 
tolerance more slowly than morphine, showed limited physical dependence, respiratory 
depression, constipation, and displayed no reward or aversion in CPP/CPA assays, suggesting that 
analogs might represent a promising new generation of novel pain relievers.

 INTRODUCTION
Opioids, including morphine, are clinically used for the treatment of moderate to severe 
chronic pain. However, despite their proven efficacy, mu opioid receptor agonists have 
problematic side effects such as tolerance, physical dependence, and substance abuse.1 
Agonists selective for other opioid receptors produce analgesia, but with their own 
liabilities.2–4 The ultimate goal of opioid-related drug development has been to design and 
synthesize potent antinociceptive agents that are devoid of adverse side effects. Many 
approaches have been taken over the years, starting with the development of partial agonists 
or mixed agonist/antagonists.5–9 A more recent approach takes advantage of biased agonism, 
in which distinct downstream signaling pathways are activated by different agonists working 
through the same receptor.10,11 It has been proposed that ligands biased against recruiting β-
arrestin-2, or showing preference for activating specific G-protein-mediated signal 
transduction pathways, will demonstrate diminished side effects.12,13 Oliceridine 
(TRV130)14,15 is an example of a mu opioid receptor-biased agonist which has recently 
entered phase-III clinical trials, showing separation between antinociception and some 
opioid-related side effects. 6′-Guanidinonaltrindole (6′-GNTI),16 22-thiocyanatosalvinorin 
A (RB-64),17 and two new classes of kappa opioid ligands from the Aube group have also 
recently been reported in the opioid literature as biased kappa opioid receptor agonists.18,19
Natural products have provided many lead compounds leading to the design of new 
pharmaceuticals. Natural products and their derivatives account for approximately 50% of 
approved drugs.20 Morphine, the most commonly employed opioid, and thebaine, the 
structure on which the vast majority of semisynthetic opiates is based, are natural alkaloids 
found in the poppy plant, Papaver somniferum. While opioid chemistry has traditionally 
been dominated by thebaine-derived alkaloids isolated from poppy, there are a growing 
number of opioid natural products derived from structures other than the traditional 
morphinan scaffold and thus structurally not closely related to morphine. These include 
analogs of salvinorin A21–23 such as herkinorin24 and thiocyanatosalvinorin A,17 which have 
been developed as mu and kappa opioid receptor-biased agonists, respectively, while some 
peptide analogs such as cyclo[Phe-D-Pro-Phe-Trp] (CJ-15,208)25 are being developed as 
analgesics and medications against cocaine abuse (Figure 1). Mitragynine (indole core) (1) 
and its congeners isolated from the Southeast Asian plant Mitragyna speciosa, commonly 
known as kratom, are monoterpene indole alkaloids structurally not closely related to 
morphine.26 In addition to its traditional use, kratom has become a quickly emerging 
substance of abuse. It is currently legal in many parts of the world, and kratom leaves are 
available for purchase over the Internet. Case studies of fatalities resulting from overdose 
have been published, although the risk posed by mitragynine remains uncertain, given that 
simultaneous use or contamination with other substances (including opioids) that may have

 been involved in the reported deaths.27–30 Both mitragynine (1) and its naturally occurring 
oxidation product, 7-OH mitragynine (indolenine core) (2), are opioid antinociceptive agents 
that have been examined both in vitro and in vivo.31–39 Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (3), a 
rearrangement product of 2 with a spiro-pseudoindoxyl core, was first isolated in 1974 by 
Zarembo et al. as a microbial metabolite of 1 by the fungus Helminthosporum sp.40 
Yamamoto et al. reported that it acted nonselectively on mu- and delta opioid receptors, 
while its kappa opioid receptor affinity was negligible.41 In later publications by Takayama 
et al., the in vivo supraspinal analgesic properties of 3 were briefly discussed.39
In this work, we report the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology and structure–activity 
relationships (SAR) of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (3). We demonstrate for the first time that 
3 and its C-9 substituted derivatives, corynantheidine pseudoindoxyls, are systemically 
active mixed mu opioid receptor agonist/delta opioid receptor antagonist compounds in vitro 
and produce potent antinociception in vivo. Characterization of 3 demonstrated an opioid-
mediated analgesia devoid of any place-conditioning effects and a side effect profile far 
superior to clinically used mu opioid-based antinociceptive agents.
RESULTS
Chemistry
1 was extracted from dry kratom powder using a modified protocol reported by Ponglux et 
al.42 Compounds 2 and 3 were synthesized from 1 as shown in Scheme 1.39,43 To better 
understand the pharmacology of this template, SAR studies were carried out by modifying 
the C-9 and N-1 (indole nitrogen) positions. Six analogs with various substituents in the C-9 
positions and 2 analogs at N-1 were synthesized. C-9-substituted corynantheidine 
pseudoindoxyl derivatives were synthesized starting from 2. To gain access to the C-9 
position on the pseudoindoxyl scaffold, 2 was converted to 9-hydroxycorynantheidine 
pseudoindoxyl (4) using AlCl3 and ethanethiol in DCM. This intermediate was converted to 
its triflate (5) using triflic anhydride and pyridine, which was subsequently used as the 
precursor for further reactions.
The pseudoindoxyl of corynantheidine (6) was synthesized using palladium-catalyzed 
removal of the triflate ester by formic acid. The synthesis of the nitrile 7 was accomplished 
in a palladium-catalyzed reaction of 5 with Zn(CN)2. Compounds 8 and 9 were obtained via 
Suzuki coupling reactions of 5 and the appropriate boronic acids. 3 was alkylated in the N-1 
position with benzyl bromide and iodomethane to synthesize 11 and 12, respectively.
In vitro Pharmacology
Initial investigations used in vitro radioligand binding assays with cell lines stably 
expressing murine opioid receptors (Figure 2, Table 1). Mitragynine (1) showed poor affinity 
at all opioid receptors, whereas 7-hydroxymitragynine (2) showed moderate affinity at the 
mu opioid receptor clone MOR-1, 5-fold higher than 1 and was considerably more potent at 
the expressed delta opioid receptor clone DOR-1 than 1.44 Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (3) 
displayed the highest overall binding affinity for MOR-1 and DOR-1 (Ki 0.8 nM and 3 nM, 
respectively) while also showing a moderate affinity for KOR-1. These data suggest that

 conversion of the indole to indolenine ring to the spiro-pseudoindoxyl core dramatically 
increases affinity for opioid receptors. The binding affinities of 3 at MOR-1 and DOR-1 
were comparable to the prototypic mu ligands morphine and DAMGO and delta ligands 
DPDPE and NTI. Alkyl substitution at the N-1 position of the template (compounds 11, 12) 
eliminated opioid affinity, suggesting that the unsubstituted indole NH is important for 
receptor binding. Substitutions at C-9, however, yielded potent derivatives. All six C-9-
modified compounds (4, 6–10) maintained the high affinity at both MOR-1and DOR-1 sites 
as observed with 3 previously. 2 and 3 were also screened across a panel of other nonopioid 
drug targets using the PDSP screening facility at NIMH.45 2 exhibited no affinity 
appreciable affinity at these receptors (Ki > 10 μM). 3 had poor affinity at α2A adrenergic 
receptor, α2C adrenergic receptor, and 5HT7 (Table S1).
In [35S]GTPγS functional assays using opioid transfected cell lines, 1 was a partial agonist 
with moderate potency at MOR-1 and a weak antagonist at both DOR-1 and KOR-1 (Table 
2). 2 was a partial agonist at MOR-1, 4-fold more potent than 1, and a weak KOR-1 and 
DOR-1 antagonist.44 Analog 3 was a potent full agonist at MOR-1 and an antagonist at both 
DOR-1 and KOR-1. Most C-9-modified derivatives (4, 6, 7, and 9) were MOR-1 agonists 
and DOR-1 antagonists in functional assays with the exception of compound 8, which was a 
dual MOR-1/DOR-1 agonist (Table 2).
Both DAMGO and endomorphin-2 effectively recruited β-arrestin-2 in CHO cells 
expressing MOR-1, as measured with the DiscoveRx PathHunter assay. In contrast, 
compounds 1–4 and 6–9 failed to recruit β-arrestin-2 at concentrations as high as 10 μM 
(Figure 3A). Both 2 and 3 reduced DAMGO-induced β-arrestin-2 stimulation in these cells 
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3B)44 consistent with their respective binding 
affinities at the receptor. Thus, 3 and its analogs potently stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding 
without stimulating β-arrestin-2 recruitment. However, their antagonism of DAMGO 
stimulation of β-arrestin-2 recruitment revealed that they could still bind to both G-protein 
and arrestin functional receptor configurations.
Antinociception
The antinociceptive effect of mitragynine and its derivatives was evaluated in vivo in mice 
using the radiant heat tail flick assay (Table 1). After subcutaneous administration, 1 
produced antinociception with an ED50 (and 95% CI) value of 166 mg/kg (101, 283), 66-
fold less active than morphine. On the other hand, 2 was about 5-fold more potent than 
morphine and 350-fold more potent than 1 (Figure S1), similar to literature values.32–34 
Compound 3 was 1.5-fold more potent than morphine after intracerebroventricular 
administration (icv, Figures 4A and S2) and 3-fold more potent following subcutaneous (sc, 
Figures 4B and S4A and S4B) administration. Compound 3 has a shorter duration of 
antinociceptive effect than morphine with a peak effect at 15 min (Figure S3). Compound 3 
proved equally active in CD1, C57BL/6, and 129Sv6 strains of mice subcutaneously (Figure 
S5). Furthermore, 3 also was active orally, with an ED50 (95% CI) value of 7.5 (4.3–13) 
mg/kg (Figure 4C). The C-9 derivatives (4 and 6–10) also produced antinociception 
following systemic administration, with ED50 values comparable to 3 (Table 1). Compound 
3 was also active in the hot plate assay of antinociception, with an ED50 (95% CI) value of

 0.99 (0.75–1.3) mg/kg (Figures 4D and S4C), comparable to morphine (ED50 = 1.7 (1.3, 
2.4) mg/kg) (Figure S4D).
Opioid Receptor Antagonism
Based on the high affinity and favorable mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist profile in vitro, 
we examined the activity of compound 3 in greater detail. Naloxone and the mu-selective 
antagonist β-FNA effectively reversed 3-induced antinociception, whereas the delta-selective 
antagonist NTI and the kappa antagonist norBNI did not. Yohimbine, an α2 antagonist, had 
no effect on the antinociception of 3 (Figure 5A).
To examine the selectivity of antinociception further, we used an antisense 
oligodeoxynucleotide mapping paradigm. The activity of the oligodeoxynucleotide antisense 
probes for MOR-1, KOR-1, and DOR-1 has been established previously.46–48 Targeting 
exon 1 of MOR-1, the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide lowered the analgesic actions of 
morphine, reproducing earlier studies (Figure S6).46 Similarly, the responses of 3 were 
lowered (Figure 5B). The specificity of the response was established by the inactivity of the 
control mismatch. Similarly, downregulation of exon 3 of DOR-148 and exon 2 of KOR-149 
with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides attenuated antinociception produced by the prototypic 
delta agonist DPDPE and the prototypic kappa agonist U50,488H, in accordance with 
previous studies (Figure S6). However, these oligodeoxynucleotides targeting kappa and 
delta receptors did not alter the antinociception of 3 (Figure 5B).
The mu opioid receptor Oprm1 creates an array of splice variants through alternative 
splicing with patterns conserved from rodents to humans.50,51 The major sets of variants are 
full-length 7 transmembrane domain (7TM) variants associated with exon 1 (E1). A second 
set of variants of truncated six transmembrane domain splice variants (6TM) is generated by 
an alternative promoter associated with exon 11 (E11) of the Oprm1 gene.52,53 MOR-1 KO 
mice were used to establish the contributions of 7TM E1-MOR-1 and 6TM E11-MOR-1 
variants to 3 antinociception.
Two different types of MOR-1 KO mice were utilized: exon 11 (E11) MOR-1 KO mice, 
which lack the 6TM E11splice variants of MOR-1 but retain expression of 7TM E1 splice 
variants of MOR-1, and total mu opioid receptor knockout in which both exons 1 and 11 
were disrupted (E1/E11) to eliminate all 7TM and 6TM mu opioid receptor variants of the 
Oprm1 gene. Morphine antinociception has previously been demonstrated to be independent 
of the E11-associated 6TM splice variants of MOR-1, maintaining full analgesic activity in 
the E11 KO,54 but its antinociception was completely eliminated in E1/E11 MOR-1 KO 
mice,55 suggesting 7TM E1-MOR-1 variant as the primary mechanism of analgesic action. 
Compound 3 showed similar antinociceptive responses as morphine. Compound 3 
antinociception was similar in wild-type (ED50 = 0.83 mg/kg (0.37–1.9)) and exon 11 KO 
C57/BL6 mice (ED50 = 1.4 mg/kg (0.34–5.8)) in a tail flick assay (Figure 5D). However, 
antinociception of compound 3 was eliminated in E1/E11 MOR-1 KO mice (ED50 > 30 mg/
kg), indicating a mu opioid receptor mechanism.55 Taken together with the antisense results, 
these in vivo findings indicate that 3 analgesia is mediated by 7TM E1-MOR-1 receptors.

 Side Effect Profile
We next evaluated 3 in mouse models of antinociceptive tolerance, dependence, respiratory 
depression, and inhibition of GI transit (Figure 6). Mice developed antinociceptive tolerance 
to morphine after twice daily administration for 5 days (5 mg/kg/injection, sc). In contrast, 
antinociceptive tolerance to 3 developed far more slowly, with twice daily administration of 
3 (at an equianalgesic dose as morphine) requiring 29 days instead of 5 days (Figure 6A). 
After 5 days, the morphine ED50 value was shifted 6-fold to 12.1 (7.6–19.4) mg/kg from 2.0 
(1.2–3.3) mg/kg. In contrast, after 5 days, the ED50 value for 3 was shifted <2-fold to 1.1 
(0.66–2.0) mg/kg. After 29 days, the ED50 value for 3 was shifted 6-fold (4.5 mg/kg (2.7–
7.7) mg/kg) (Figure S7). An independent sample t test was used to test for the group 
difference between 3 and morphine on day 5. The mean difference of 53.97%MPE between 
the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p-value <0.0001) at the 5% level of 
significance. This difference is likely to range between 42.27 and 65.67% MPE as measured 
by a 95% confidence interval. To highlight 3’s ability to sustain antinociception over 
repeated dosing, the composite areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated using the 
trapezoidal rule on the mean response across 1–29 days for the 3 group and 1–5 days for the 
morphine group, respectively. The AUC for the morphine group was 205.9, while for the 3 
group it was 6-fold larger, 1239.
Time action studies revealed that 3 has a shorter duration of action than morphine (Figure 
S3). Since the shorter duration of action of 3 led to a decreased drug exposure, we also 
examined tolerance in a different dosing paradigm in which 3 was given four times per day 
to provide similar drug exposures for morphine and 3. In this paradigm, 3 failed to show a 
significant decreased effect over 5 days, whether examined at a fixed dose over the 5 days 
(Figure S8A) or dose–response curves at day 5 (Figure S8B). After 5 days, the ED50 value 
for 3 was shifted from 0.69 (0.46, 1.0) to 1.6 (0.97–2.6) mg/kg (Figure S8C), a shift similar 
to that observed when 3 was given twice a day (ED50 = 1.1 (0.66–2.0)) on day 5 (Figure S7).
Physical dependence was assessed in mice treated repeatedly with 3 at twice its ED50 dose 
(1.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 5, 22, or 29 days by administration of the opioid antagonist 
naloxone. Mice showed only minimal signs of withdrawal following administration of 
naloxone with 12 ± 4.1, 13 ± 4.4, and 14 ± 6.0 jumps on average, respectively (Figure 6B). 
These values were not significantly different from saline but differed significantly from mice 
treated with morphine for 5 days, which showed 77 ± 7.2 jumps (Figure 6B). In summary, 
compound 3 demonstrated limited antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence in 
comparison with morphine following chronic administration.
Differences in effect between 3 and morphine extended to other opioid effects. Mu selective 
agonists inhibit gastrointestinal transit, a major component of constipation. At a dose twice 
its analgesic ED50 value (5 mg/kg, sc), morphine almost totally eliminated transit (Figure 
6C). An equianalgesic dose of 3 (1.5 mg/kg, sc) also lowered gastrointestinal transit, but not 
nearly as much as morphine. The effect on GI transit plateaued, with a greater dose (4 
mg/kg, sc) also showing no further inhibition (Figure 6C).
Morphine dose-dependently reduced the respiratory rate in mice, with a decrease of 
approximately 30% by a dose twice its analgesic ED50 value (5 mg/kg, sc) by approximately

 50% after a higher dose corresponding to 4-fold its analgesic ED50 value. In contrast, 3 
showed no respiratory depression at ∼2× its antinociceptive ED50 dose in C57BL/6 mice 
(1.2 mg/kg, sc). Although a higher dose (3 mg/kg, sc), transiently lowered the respiratory 
rate by approximately 15%, this was still significantly less than morphine (Figure 6D).
Compound 3 also failed to show either rewarding or aversive behavior in a conditioned place 
preference paradigm. In this study, morphine produced significant conditioned place 
preference (CPP; F(4180) = 5.62, p = 0.003; two-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc 
test) and U50,488H produced conditioned place aversion (CPA), but 3 demonstrated neither 
preference or aversive behavior at doses 2-fold or 5-fold its analgesic ED50 value (n.s.; 
Tukey HSD post hoc test; Figure 6E). Overall, these results demonstrate that 3 produces 
potent opioid receptor-mediated antinociception both centrally and systemically, yet shows a 
separation of antinociception from some classic opioid side effects such as antinociceptive 
tolerance, dependence, and conditioned place preference. Furthermore, 3 shows a lower 
propensity to cause respiratory depression and constipation compared with the canonical 
opioid, morphine.
Modeling
In silico docking studies were carried out to unravel potential differences in receptor 
interactions of 1–3. The results of in silico prediction of inhibitory constants are listed in 
Table 3 for all three mitragynine compounds and the opioid receptors. In general, ligands of 
the lowest energy complexes were located in the binding pocket observed in the crystal 
structures. Inhibitory constants (Ki) calculated for the lowest energy complexes follow the 
trend observed in the experiments, but the range of values is much more narrow compared to 
experimental data, suggesting much lower selectivity of both the ligands and the receptors. 
The lowest energy complexes, which are considered to reflect specific binding between 1–3, 
and the receptors are shown in Figures 7 and S14. These in silico Ki values reproduce 
experimental data with much higher accuracy compared to the ones calculated for the lowest 
energy complexes in the first pass, where all nonspecific hits were included (for explanation, 
see the Experimental Section). Receptor side chains in contact with the bound 1–3 are also 
depicted in Figure 7 and listed in Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Although initially described in the scientific literature as early as 1974, very little was 
known about the pharmacology of 3 prior to this study. Its chemical structure suggested it as 
an excellent starting point for semisynthetic diversification. Thus, we subjected 3 to detailed 
pharmacological analysis. In opioid receptor-transfected CHO cell lines, 3 had a high 
affinity for MOR-1 and DOR-1 sites with a moderate affinity at KOR-1. After subcutaneous 
administration, 3 was a potent antinociceptive agent in two thermal pain models: radiant heat 
tail flick and hot plate. It was also active in the mouse tail flick assay when administered 
supraspinally and orally. We established the agonist selectivity of 3 through pharmacological 
and genetic approaches, demonstrating that its antinociception was mediated by mu opioid 
receptors and not kappa, delta, and/or α2 adrenergic receptors. Mu antagonists attenuate the 
antinociception, but it was insensitive to kappa and delta antagonists. Clonidine, an α2

 agonist, is a potent analgesic used for the treatment of various pain conditions.56 Yohimbine, 
an α2 antagonist, did not affect the antinociception of 3, therefore, its antinociception is 
likely not related to adrenergic pathways. The nonreversal of analgesia also rules out a role 
of α2A and α2C adrenergic receptors in mediating analgesia of 3, although the drug had 
some affinity for these receptors in our initial screening. Antisense downregulation of E1-
MOR-1 variants attenuated antinociception, while downregulation of DOR-1 and KOR-1 
failed to modify 3 antinociception. In mice lacking E11-MOR-1 variants (E11 MOR-1 KO 
mice) compound 3, like morphine, still exhibited antinociception comparable to wild-type 
mice, while in mice lacking all mu opioid receptor splice variants (E1/E11 MOR-1 KO 
mice), 3 antinociception was completely eliminated. The results from antisense and KO 
mice experiments implicate traditional 7TM mu opioid receptor aka E1-MOR-1 variants in 3 
antinociception.
Of interest, 3 signaling failed to recruit β-arrestin-2 alone and antagonized both DAMGO-
induced β-arrestin-2 recruitment and stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding. To the best of our 
knowledge, 3 is the first example of a mixed activity mu opioid agonist/delta antagonist 
ligand which does not recruit β-arrestin-2. Prior evidence in the literature suggests that 
failure to recruit β-arrestin-2 and delta antagonism may both be successful in separating 
antinociception from unwanted side effects. Consistent with this, 3 displayed a robust 
antinociceptive effect in mice and without conditioned place preference or aversion. Two 
different dosing paradigms (two and four times per day) revealed the slow development of 
tolerance and a marked decrease in jumping following challenge with naloxone, which is 
characteristic of physical dependence. Furthermore, 3 showed no respiratory depression at 
twice its analgesic ED50 dose and far less constipation than morphine.
A number of mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist ligands have been reported in the literature. 
DIPP-NH2[Ψ],57 5″-(4-chlorophenyl)-6,7-didehydro-4,5α-epoxy-3-hydroxy-17-
methylpyrido[2′,3′:6,7]morphinan (SoRi20411),5 and 14-alkoxy pyridomorphinans58 are 
potent delta antagonists and mu agonists which produce analgesia with reduced tolerance 
when given supraspinally. It must be noted that a majority of these studies monitored the 
development of tolerance through the accepted practice of administering the ED80 
antinociceptive dose of the test drug twice daily for 5–7 days. The current study tested this 
approach even more rigorously, yet still found significant reductions in antinociceptive 
tolerance following administration of 3 for 29 days. DIPP-NH2[Ψ] also shows no physical 
dependence in treated mice. 4a,9-Dihydroxy-7a-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methyl-2,3,4,4a,5,6-
hexahydro-1H-4,12-methanobenzofuro[3,2-e]isoquinolin-7(7aH)-one (UMB425)59 and the 
cyclic peptide analog of KSK103 (C-terminal Ser(β-Glc)NH2)6 and ([Dmt1]DALDA → 
CH2CH2NH ← TICP-[Ψ]), which connects Dmt1-DALDA (mu agonist) with the delta 
antagonist TICP[Ψ] through a spacer, also show reduced acute antinociceptive tolerance 
compared to morphine when given systemically.60 Administration of delta antagonists or 
induced downregulation of delta opioid receptors has been reported to prevent morphine 
tolerance without sacrificing analgesic potency.61,62 Genetic disruption of the opioid system 
led to similar observations. In DOR-1 antisense knockdown mouse models, tolerance and 
acute dependence to morphine were eliminated,63 while DOR-1 knockout animals did not 
develop antinociceptive tolerance to morphine.64 The role of delta opioid receptors in

 blocking mu opioid-mediated CPP is still unclear.65 CPP is retained unchanged or abolished 
depending on assay conditions in DOR-1 KO mice, while morphine reportedly was more 
rewarding in a study with β-arrestin-2 KO mice.66 Additional study of this phenomenon 
should be possible as additional novel ligands with suitable MOR agonist/DOR antagonist 
activity profiles such as 3 become available.
Although GPCRs are mostly studied in relation to their ability to activate G-proteins, these 
transmembrane receptors are capable of recruiting β-arrestins to initiate separate cellular 
signal transduction pathways.67 β-Arrestin-2 activation has been implicated in the 
mechanism of receptor desensitization and the occurrence of deleterious side effects.68 
Similarly to G-protein signaling, β-arrestin-2 activation is ligand and receptor dependent. 
Different ligands are able to stabilize GPCRs in a variety of conformations, resulting in the 
differential activation (bias) of G-protein and β-arrestin-2-mediated signaling pathways. 
Therefore, ligands interacting with the receptor do not simply have a linear effect on efficacy 
but also affect the functional quality of the downstream pathways.69 Biased signaling of 
opioid receptors has been studied in detail by Bohn and co-workers. Compared with wild-
type mice, morphine displayed enhanced antinociception and significantly attenuated 
respiratory depression and inhibition of GI transit in β-arrestin-2 KO mice.70–72 These 
results suggest that a fully G-protein-biased opioid ligand that does not activate β-arrestin-2 
signaling may be able to separate antinociception from some opioid adverse effects. An 
important example of G-protein-biased opioids is oliceridine, a synthetic mu agonist 
currently in clinical trials as an alternative to morphine and fentanyl for the treatment of 
chronic pain. Oliceridine is a potent analgesic that causes less respiratory depression and 
constipation than morphine at equianalgesic doses in humans.15
Taken together, these previous observations may explain why 3 is able to separate 
antinociception from typical opioid side effects resulting in low risk of developing tolerance 
while showing limited physical dependence, respiratory depression, and inhibition of GI 
transit. However, the relative contributions of its mu agonist/delta antagonist activity and its 
inability to recruit β-arrestin-2 to this advantageous pharmacological profile are not clear.
In order to investigate the SAR of the mitragynine pseudoindoxyl scaffold, semisynthetic 
analogs were made starting from 1 (C-9 analogs) and 3 (N-1 analogs). Receptor affinities 
were not significantly affected by modifications at the C-9 position, although 9-O-
acetylation slightly lowered mu and delta affinities. Compounds 4 and 6–9 retained high, 
subnanomolar affinity at cells expressing MOR-1 with little change in affinity in DOR-1 
cells. None of the derivatives stimulated β-arrestin-2 activation. According to previous 
literature reports, C-9 modifications of mitragynine altered the efficacy at mu receptors. 
Replacing the C-9 methoxy group with H yields corynantheidine, a mu antagonist, whereas 
C-9 O-demethylation yields 9-OH corynantheidine, a partial agonist in in vitro assays.39,73 
According to our studies, the SAR of the C-9-modified pseudoindoxyl scaffold is quite 
distinct. Various substituents can be tolerated at this position, maintaining full mu agonism. 
Neither C-9 O-demethylation (4) nor the removal of the methoxy group (6) affected the 
efficacies at mu as 4 and 6 were mu full agonists. However, the activity at delta receptors is 
differentially affected by varying substituents. Compounds 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 retained delta 
antagonism, while the 9-phenyl analog, 8, was a delta agonist. 8 was a dual mu–delta agonist

 with similar intrinsic activity and potency at both receptors. Substitution and the 
introduction of bulky groups at N-1 (the indoxyl nitrogen) were not tolerated. Both the N-
benzyl (11) and N-methyl (12) derivatives showed diminished affinities at all three opioid 
receptors compared to 3. In vivo, the C-9 analogs were active after systemic administration. 
The 9-OH derivative (4) was more potent than 3. Removal of the methoxy group (6) 
increased analgesic potency. The analgesic potencies of the corresponding C-9 mitragynine 
analogs (corynantheidine and 9-OH corynantheidine) are not reported in the literature. These 
results, in addition to the in vitro data, suggest that the SAR of compounds of the 
pseudoindoxyl scaffold differs from that of the natural Mitragyna alkaloids. Substitution of 
the C-9 methoxy group with –CN, phenyl, and furan-3-yl groups afforded products (7–9, 
respectively) roughly equipotent to 3. Acetylation of 4 had a slightly negative impact on the 
analgesic potency (10).
In comparison to the mu opioid receptor-bound morphinans,74–76 in silico modeling 
suggests the mitragynine derivatives (1–3) are likely to have a different binding pose. The 
salt bridge between Asp147 and the tertiary amine of the ligand and the participation of the 
phenolic OH in a water molecule-assisted hydrogen-bonded polar network of Tyr148, Lis233, 
and His297 were described as the main, conserved interactions between morphinan ligands 
and the binding pocket.77 The presence of a salt bridge between Asp147 and the tertiary 
amine of 1 and its derivatives was a filtering criterion of docking results, therefore, it is 
present in the docked complexes of all three mitragynine compounds. The β-methoxy 
acrylate moiety in the mitragynine compounds docked in the mu receptor pocket occupied 
the same space as the phenol moiety of the morphinan scaffold in the crystallographic 
structures.75,77
The main difference between the mu receptor-bound 1, 2, and 3 is that the oxidation 
products (2 and 3) seem to participate in the polar network formed between Tyr148, Lys233, 
and His297 by contributing their methoxy (C-9) and methyl ester groups and replacing 
hydrogen-bond assisting water molecules observed in the crystal structure of the agonist-
bound mu receptor (Table 3).76 On the other hand, the beta-methoxy methyl acrylate moiety 
of 1 forms polar interactions with Gln124 and Tyr128 and does not take part in the 
aforementioned polar network (Figure S9 and Table 3). In addition to the salt bridge 
between Asp147 in the mu receptor crystal and the tertiary amine, it seems that there is a 
hydrogen bond present, formed with the 7-OH group of 2 (Figure S10). There is no 
significant difference in the relative orientation between the receptor-bound 2 and 3 (Figure 
S11). Differences in the calculated binding free energies and Ki values are most likely to 
emerge from the type and number of receptor contacts formed by these two compounds in 
those particularly similar docked orientations. Such differences in interactions are possibly 
due to the different heterocyclic scaffolds of 2 and 3. Compared to its derivatives, 1 adopts a 
different orientation when bound to the delta receptor and forms fewer contacts with the 
residues constituting the binding pocket, resulting in a loss of affinity for this receptor. 
Admittedly, the relative orientation and the number and type of contacts formed between 2 
and 3 with the delta receptor and the calculated in silico Ki values are highly similar, 
rendering it difficult to give an accurate explanation for the 1 order of magnitude difference 
in the experimentally determined binding affinities. A key difference between the two bound

 geometries is that the beta-methoxy methyl acrylate moiety of 2 is positioned in a 
hydrophobic environment of Ile277, Leu300, and Ile304, (Figure S12 and Table 3), while in 
the case of 3, this group is projected into a more hydrophilic part of the binding pocket lined 
with Asn131, Trp274, and His278 (Figure S13). Furthermore, the 7-OH group of 2 was found 
to interact with Asp128 (Figure S12) similarly to that observed when docked to the mu 
(Figure S10). In addition, the 9-methoxy group of 2 formed contact with the phenolic OH of 
Tyr129. In the delta-bound 3 complex, both the 9-methoxy and the carbonyl groups of the 
pseudoindoxyl moiety were calculated to be in favorable position for hydrogen-bonding with 
Tyr129 (Figures 7 and S13).
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we report for the first time the detailed in vitro and in vivo studies on 
mitragynine pseudoindoxyl. Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl is a mu agonist/delta antagonist 
opioid with a signaling bias for G-protein-mediated signaling pathways in vitro and which 
produced potent antinociception in vivo. Perhaps owing to its mixed mu agonism/delta 
antagonism activity, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl may avoid some of the major problems of 
opioid therapy, as we observed no reward or aversion and diminished antinociceptive 
tolerance, physical dependence, respiratory depression, and GI transit inhibition in mouse 
models. Upon chemical modification of this scaffold, key SAR features distinct from the 
mitragynine template were revealed. Among analogs modified at the C-9 position, 
compounds with differential efficacies within in vitro functional assays and improved in vivo 
potencies were identified. Docking studies to opioid receptors revealed the characteristic 
binding modes of mitragynine-type derivatives. It is hoped that these studies will contribute 
to improved understanding of the mechanism of action of compounds related to mitragynine, 
while holding the promise to provide novel antinociceptive drug candidates based on the 
mitragynine/corynantheidine pseudoindoxyl template that separates antinociception from the 
potential for abuse and other side effects due to their unique pharmacological properties. 
Observations reported in this paper and past studies on opioid ligands suggest a dual 
mechanism (mu agonism/delta antagonism coupled with β-arrestin2-nonrecruitment) which 
may account for the separation of side effects from antinociception seen with this template. 
The potential contributions from each of these two mechanisms will be explored in future 
studies on this template.

 Mice
Male CD1 mice (20–32 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, and C57BL/6J 
mice (20–32 g each) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Exon-11 
KO79 and Exon-1/Exon-11 KO mice55 were bred in our laboratory. All mice used 
throughout the manuscript were opioid naïve. All mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark 
cycle with Purina rodent chow and water available ad libitum and housed in groups of five 
until testing. All animal studies were preapproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committees of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or University of Florida, in 
accordance with the 2002 National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals.
Radioligand Competition Binding Assays
[125I]IBNtxA binding was carried out in membranes prepared from Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells stably expressing murine clones MOR-1, DOR-1, and KOR-1, as previously 
described.7–9,80 Binding was performed at 25 °C for 90 min. Binding in MOR-1/CHO was 
carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer with 5 mM MgSO4 and 20 μg/mL protein, 
while binding in KOR-1/CHO and DOR-1/CHO was carried out in 50 mM potassium 
phosphate pH = 7.0 buffer and 40 μg/mL protein. After the incubation, the reaction was 
filtered through glass-fiber filters (Whatman Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and washed 
three times with 3 mL of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, on a semiautomatic cell 
harvester. Nonspecific binding was defined by the addition of levallorphan (8 μM) to 
matching samples and was subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. Ki values 
were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). Protein 
concentrations were determined using the Lowry method with BSA as the standard.81
[35S]GTPγS Functional Assay
[35S]GTPγS binding was performed on membranes prepared from transfected cells stably 
expressing opioid receptors in the presence and absence of the indicated compound for 60 
min at 30 °C in the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 
and 10 mM NaCl) containing 0.05 nM [35S]GTPγS; 2 μg/mL each leupeptin, pepstatin, 
aprotinin, and bestatin; and 30 μM GDP, as previously described.82 After the incubation, the 
reaction was filtered through glass fiber filters (Whatman Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) 
and washed three times with 3 mL of ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) on a 
semiautomatic cell harvester. Filters were transferred into vials with 3 mL of Liquiscint 
(National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and the radioactivity in vials was determined by 
scintillation spectroscopy in a Tri-Carb 2900TR counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical 
Sciences). Basal binding was determined in the presence of GDP and the absence of drug. 
Data were normalized to 1000 nM DAMGO, DPDPE, and U50,488 for MOR-1, DOR-1, 
and KOR-1 binding, respectively. EC50, IC50, and %Emax values were calculated by 
nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA).
β-arrestin-2 Recruitment Assay
β-arrestin-2 recruitment was determined using the PathHunter enzyme complementation 
assay (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA) using modified MOR-1 expressed in CHO cells

 (DiscoveRx). Cells were plated at a density of 2500 cells/well in a 384-well plate as 
described in the manufacturer’s protocol. The following day, cells were treated with the 
indicated compound for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with PathHunter detection 
reagents for 60 min. Chemiluminescence was measured with an Infinite M1000 Pro plate 
reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). For the antagonist dose–response assay, the cells 
were incubated with the antagonist for 30 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of agonist. 
Following antagonist treatment, the cells were treated with 10 μM DAMGO for 90 min at 
37 °C, and chemiluminescence was detected using the PathHunter detection reagents.
Antinociception
Tail flick antinociception was determined using the radiant heat tail flick technique using an 
Ugo Basile model 37360 instrument as previously described.8,9 The intensity was set to 
achieve a baseline between 2 and 3 s. Baseline latencies were determined before 
experimental treatments for all mice. Tail flick antinociception was assessed quantally as a 
doubling or greater of the baseline latency, with a maximal 10 s latency to minimize damage 
to the tail. Data were analyzed as percent maximal effect, %MPE, and was calculated 
according to the formula: % MPE [(observed latency − baseline latency)/(maximal latency − 
baseline latency)] × 100. Compounds were injected subcutaneously (sc) or 
intracerebroventricularly (icv), and antinociception was assessed 15 min later at the peak 
effect. Intracerebroventricular dosing (icv) was carried out as previously described.83 
Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. A small incision was made, and 
synthetic opiate analog (2 ul/mouse) was injected using a 10 μL Hamilton syringe fitted to a 
27 gauge needle. Injections were made into the right lateral ventricle at the following 
coordinates: 2 mm caudal to bregma, 2 mm lateral to sagittal suture, and 2 mm in depth. 
Mice were tested for antinociception 15 min post injection. For oral (po) studies, mice were 
fasted for 18 h with access to water before administering the drug by oral gavage. For the 
antagonism studies, β-FNA (40 mg/kg, sc) and norbinaltorphimine (norBNI, 10 mg/kg, sc) 
were administered 24 h before 3. Naltrindole (NTI, 0.5 mg/kg, sc) was administered 15 min 
before 3. Antinociception also was assessed using the hot plate test.54 The hot plate (Ugo 
Basile 35100) consisted of a metal surface (55 °C) with a transparent plexiglass cylinder to 
contain the mouse. The latency to lick a hind paw or shake/flutter when the mouse was 
placed on the hot plate was measured, with a maximal latency of 30 s to avoid tissue 
damage. Baseline latencies were taken for each mouse prior to any drug administration. 
Mice were tested for analgesia with cumulative subcutaneous doses of the drug until the 
mouse can withstand the maximal latency. Once the mouse reached the maximal latency, the 
mouse was no longer given higher doses. In vivo experiments were evaluated using 
GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA as described above.
Antisense Assays
Antisense (AN) and mismatch (MIS) oligodeoxynucleotides were designed based on the 
published sequences of the mouse mu opioid receptor gene (Oprm1), delta opioid receptor 
gene (Oprd1), and kappa opioid receptor gene (Oprk1) (Table 3). These probes have been 
previously described and validated.49,84–86 Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide injection: 
Groups of mice received the stated antisense by icv administration (5–10 μg) or mismatch 
(5–10 μg) oligodeoxynucleotide icv under light isoflurane anesthesia on days 1, 3 and 5, as

 previously described.85 Tail flick antinociception was tested on day 6. Control groups 
received no injection prior to testing. On test day, mice received 3 (1.5 mg/kg, sc), morphine 
(0.75 μg, icv), DPDPE (10 μg, icv), or U50,488H (5 mg/kg, sc). All experiments were 
performed 3× with similar results observed with each determination.
Respiratory Depression Assessment
Respiratory rate was assessed in awake, freely moving, adult male C57BL/6 mice with the 
MouseOx pulse oximeter system (Starr Life Sciences) as described previously.79 Each 
animal was habituated to the device for 30 min and then tested. A 5 s average breath rate 
was assessed at 5 min intervals. A baseline for each animal was obtained over a 25 min 
period before drug injection, and testing began at 15 min postinjection and continued for a 
period of 35 min. Groups of mice (n = 5) were treated sc with either morphine (5 or 10 
mg/kg) or 3 (1.2 or 3 mg/kg). Groups were compared with repeated-measures ANOVA 
followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test.
GI Transit
Gastrointestinal transit was determined as previously described.87 Animals received the 
indicated drug followed by a charcoal meal (2.5% gum tragacanth in 10% activated charcoal 
in water) by gavage. Animals were sacrificed 30 min later, and the distance traveled by 
charcoal was measured. Significance was determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s 
multiple-comparison test.
Conditioned Place Preference/Aversion
Mice were conditioned with a counterbalanced place conditioning paradigm using similar 
timing as detailed previously.8 The amount of time subjects spent in each of three 
compartments was measured over a 30 min testing period. Prior to place conditioning, the 
animals (n = 95) did not demonstrate significant differences in their time spent exploring the 
left (543 ± 13 s) vs right (571 ± 12 s) compartments (p = 0.15; Student’s t-test), resulting in 
a combined preconditioning response of −0.1 ± 19 s. During each of the next 2 days, mice 
were administered vehicle (0.9% saline) and consistently confined in a randomly assigned 
outer compartment for 40 min, half of each group in the right chamber, half in the left 
chamber. Four h later, mice were administered morphine (10 mg/kg, ip), U50,488H (30 
mg/kg, ip), cocaine (10 mg/kg, ip), or 3 (1.3 or 3.2 mg/kg, ip) and confined to the opposite 
compartment for 40 min. Conditioned place preference data are presented as the difference 
in time spent in drug- and vehicle-associated chambers and were analyzed via repeated 
measures two-way ANOVA with the difference in time spent on the treatment- vs vehicle-
associated side as the dependent measure and conditioning status as the between groups 
factor. Where appropriate, Tukey’s HSD or Sidak’s multiple comparison post hoc tests were 
used to assess group differences. Effects were considered significant when p < 0.05. All 
effects are expressed as mean ± SEM.
In Silico Docking
Full sequence target structures of the human mu opioid and delta opioid receptors for 
docking studies were built and used as described elsewhere,9 using crystal structures of the

 homologous murine opioid receptors74,75 as templates (PDB codes: 4DKL and 4EJ4, 
respectively. The X-ray structure of the human kappa receptor (PDB code: 4DJH)88 was 
used as docking target after missing side chains were added. Dockings were performed with 
the Autodock 4.2 software. Side chains in contact with the bound ligands observed in the 
crystal complexes of the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were kept flexible as well as 
all ligand torsions. Mitragynine and its natural derivatives were docked using the 
Lamarckian genetic algorithm in an 80 × 80 × 80 Å grid volume with 0.375 Å spacing. This 
docking volume is large enough to cover the whole receptor region accessible from the 
extracellular side (Figure S14). In this sense, blind docking studies were performed, and 
1000 dockings were done for all compounds and receptor models. The resultant ligand–
receptor complexes were clustered and ranked according to the corresponding binding free 
energies, which were also used to calculate inhibitory constants according to the following 
equation: ΔG = RTln Ki.

′-hexahydro-2′H-spiro[indoline-2,1′-indolizine]-7′-yl)-3-methoxyacrylate (N-
Benzyl Mitragynine Pseudoindoxyl, 11)—Compound 3 was dissolved in dry 
acetonitrile (0.5 mL), and NaH (6 mg, 10 equiv) was added. The resulting suspension was 
stirred at rt for 30 min, during which its color turned red. Benzyl bromide (7.2 uL, 2.5 equiv) 
was added, and the mixture stirred for 2 h at rt. The red color disappeared promptly after the 
addition of benzyl bromide. After the reaction time, the mixture was carefully poured into 
cold water (20 mL) and extracted with DCM (30 mL). The organic layer was rinsed with 
brine (5 mL), separated, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The 
residue was redissolved in DCM and purified using flash column chromatography (gradient: 
0–5% MeOH in DCM) to yield: 7.8 mg (64%) of 11 as a bright yellow amorphous solid. IR

β-arrestin-2 recruitment and antagonism of β-arrestin-2 recruitment. (A) β-arrestin-2 
recruitment: β-arrestin-2 recruitment was determined using the DiscoveRx PathHunter 
enzyme complementation assay using modified MOR-1 in CHO cells. Compounds were 
found to be completely G-protein biased. (B) Antagonism of β-arrestin-2 recruitment: The 
same cells were incubated with the antagonist (2, 3) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to the addition 
of agonist (10 μM DAMGO) at MOR-1. Compounds 2 and 3 were able to antagonize β-
arrestin-2 recruitment by DAMGO. IC50 values: 2: 725 ± 292 nM; 3: 34 ± 2 nM.

Antinociception of compound 3 upon intracerebroventricular, subcutaneous, and oral 
administration. (A) Dose–response curves of antinociception of 3 and morphine given 
supraspinally in CD1 mice. Two independent determinations of the cumulative dose–
response curves were performed on groups of mice (n = 5) for antinociception in the tail 
flick assay with 3 intracerebroventricularly. Animals were tested 15 min later at peak effect 
to generate the analgesic dose–response curve. Each point represents mean ± SEM for 10 
mice. ED50 values (and 95% CI) were 0.38 (0.18- 0.81) μg for 3. (B) Dose–response curves 
of antinociception of 3 given subcutaneously in CD1 mice. Three independent 
determinations of the cumulative dose–response curves were performed on groups of mice 
(n = 10) for antinociception in the tail flick assay, 30 mice in total. ED50 (and 95% CI) = 
0.76 (0.56–0.83) mg/kg. (C) Time course of tail flick antinociception of 3 given orally in 
CD1 male mice. Groups of mice (n = 10) were given different doses of 3 orally by gavage 
and tested for analgesic response at the indicated time points. ED50 (and 95% CI) = 7.5 
(4.3–13) mg/kg. (D) Hot plate. Groups of CD1 mice (n = 10) were assessed for 
antinociception of 3 at peak effect in two independent experiments (n = 20 total) in a 
cumulative dose–response paradigm. Analgesia was determined using a 55 °C hot plate, 
where the latency to respond with a hind paw lick or shake/flutter, whichever came first, was 
recorded. ED50 (and 95% CI) = 0.99 mg/kg (0.75–1.3).

 Figure 5. 
Pharmacological and genetic reversal of antinociception of 3. (A) Reversal of 
antinociception by selective antagonists. Groups of CD1 mice (n = 10) received 3 (1.5 
mg/kg sc) and the indicated antagonist. β-Funaltrexamine (β-FNA; 40 mg/kg sc) and 
norbinaltorphimine (norBNI; 10 mg/kg sc) were administered 24 h before agonist testing. 
Naltrindole (NTI; 0.5 mg/kg sc), naloxone (1 mg/kg), and yohimbine (10 mg/kg) were 
administered 15 min before 3. All antinociception testing was performed 15 min after the 
administration of 3. Similar results were observed in two independent replications. 3 
antinociception is insensitive to NTI, norBNI, and yohimbine, whereas antinociception is 
antagonized by β-FNA and naloxone (two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc 
comparisons test, p < 0.05). All values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. (B) Antisense 
oligodeoxynucleotide injection: Groups of mice (n = 15) received the stated antisense (5–10 
μg) or mismatch (5–10 μg) oligodeoxynucleotide icv under light isoflurane anesthesia on 
days 1, 3, and 5. Tail flick antinociception was tested on day 6. Control groups received no 
injection prior to testing. On test day, mice received 3 (1.5 mg/kg, sc). All experiments were 
performed 3 times with similar results observed with each determination. Analgesic 
response of 3 was only affected in mu receptor downregulated mice (MOR-1 AN) (one-way 
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons test). *Significantly different from 
control (p < 0.05). Data for agonist controls are shown in the Figure S6 and sequences of 
AN and MIS oligos are shown in Table 4. (C) Antinociception of 3 in wild-type, exon 11 
KO, and exon 1/exon 11 double KO C57 mice. Two independent determinations of the 
cumulative dose–response curves were performed on groups of mice (n = 5) for 
antinociception in the tail flick assay with 3 given subcutaneously. Compound 3 displayed 
similar antinociceptive effects in wild-type (ED50 = 0.83 mg/kg (0.37–1.9)) and exon 11 KO 
mice (ED50 = 1.4 mg/kg (0.34–5.8)), however, no antinociception was observed in exon 1/
exon 11 double KO mice, suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of 3 is mediated by the 
E1MOR-1 variants.

Side effect studies with compound 3. (A) Antinociceptive tolerance: Mice were dosed 2× 
daily with 2× antinociceptive ED50 with either morphine or 3 until they showed complete 
analgesic tolerance. 3 showed very slow onset of tolerance compared with morphine. 
*Significantly different from morphine (p < 0.05). The experiment was replicated at least 
twice with similar results. (B) Physical dependence: Groups of mice were dosed 2× daily 
with 2× antinociceptive ED50 with morphine or 3. Separate groups of mice were used for the 
5, 22, and 29 day treatment with 3 and the animals within each group were sacrificed 
following the experiment with naloxone. Animals were challenged with naloxone (1 mg/kg) 
on day 5 of the morphine group, and days 5, 22, and 29 of the 3 groups. Number of jumps 
was counted over a 15 min period postinjection. The response of mice treated with 3 on

 either day was not significantly greater than that of mice treated with saline. *Significantly 
different from saline. (One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, p 
< 0.05). (C) Gastrointestinal transit. Groups of mice (n = 10) received saline, morphine (5 
mg/kg), or 3 (1.5 and 4 mg/kg) before receiving an oral dose of 0.2 mL of charcoal meal by 
gavage. Animals were sacrificed 30 min later, and the distance traveled by charcoal was 
measured. 3 lowered transit significantly compared with saline (P < 0.05) but less than 
morphine at both doses (P < 0.05) as determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-
comparison test. The inhibition of gastrointestinal transit seems to plateau even at doses ∼5× 
higher than the antinociceptive ED50. (D) Respiratory rate. Animals were randomly assigned 
to receive saline (n = 5), 3 (1.2 and 3 mg/kg, sc, n = 5 at each dose) or morphine (5 and 10 
mg/kg, n = 5 at each dose). While morphine caused respiratory depression at both 2× and 5× 
antinociceptive ED50 dose (5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively), 3 did not depress respiratory rate 
at ∼2× antinociceptive ED50 dose (1.2 mg/kg) and was not significantly different from saline 
at any time point, whereas morphine (5 mg/kg) decreased respiratory depression in 
comparison with 3 (p < 0.05) as determined by repeated-measures ANOVA followed by 
Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. However, at ∼5× antinociceptive ED50 dose (3 mg/kg), 3 
showed signs of respiratory depression albeit significantly less than the equianalgesic dose 
of morphine (10 mg/kg) at any given time point (repeated measures ANOVA followed by 
Tukey’s multiple-comparison test). (E) Conditioned place preference and aversion. 
Compound 3 alone did not produce conditioned place preference or aversion. After 
determination of initial preconditioning preferences, mice were place conditioned daily for 2 
days with morphine (10 mg/kg/d, ip), U50,488 (30 mg/kg/d, ip), cocaine (10 mg/kg/d, ip), or 
3 (1.3 mg/kg/d, ip and 3.2 mg/kg/d, ip). Mean difference in time spent on the drug-paired 
side ± SEM is presented (n = 17–21). * Significantly different from matching 
preconditioning preference (p < 0.05); + significantly different from cocaine, morphine, and 
U50,488 preference (two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Sidak’s post hoc test).

DAMGO (MOR-1), DPDPE (DOR-1), or U50,488H (KOR-1) at 1000 nM. To determine the antagonist properties of a compound, membranes were incubated with 100 nM of the appropriate agonist in the 
presence of varying concentrations of the compound
bCompound 8 is an agonist at DOR-1. Results are presented as nM ± SEM from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. “–” Denotes not determined or not applicable.
