Summary
Background: Butyrate, propionate and acetate are short chain fatty acids (SCFA),
important for maintaining a healthy colon and are considered as protective in col-
orectal carcinogenesis. However, they may also regulate immune responses and the
composition of the intestinal microbiota. Consequently, their importance in a variety
of chronic inflammatory diseases is emerging.
Aims: To review the physiology and metabolism of SCFA in humans, cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which SCFA may act in health and disease, and
approaches for therapeutic delivery of SCFA.
Methods: A PubMed literature search was conducted for clinical and pre-clinical
studies using search terms: ‘dietary fibre’, short-chain fatty acids’, ‘acetate’, ‘propi-
onate’, ‘butyrate’, ‘inflammation’, ‘immune’, ‘gastrointestinal’, ‘metabolism’.
Results: A wide range of pre-clinical evidence supports roles for SCFA as modula-
tors of not only colonic function, but also multiple inflammatory and metabolic pro-
cesses. SCFA are implicated in many autoimmune, allergic and metabolic diseases.
However, translating effects of SCFA from animal studies to human disease is lim-
ited by physiological and dietary differences and by the challenge of delivering suffi-
cient amounts of SCFA to the target sites that include the colon and the systemic
circulation. Development of novel targeted approaches for colonic delivery, com-
bined with postbiotic supplementation, may represent desirable strategies to achieve
adequate targeted SCFA delivery.
Conclusions: There is a large array of potential disease-modulating effects of SCFA.
Adequate targeted delivery to the sites of action is the main limitation of such appli-
cation. The ongoing development and evaluation of novel delivery techniques offer
potential for translating promise to therapeutic benefit.

INTRODUCTION
Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) comprise of 1-6 carbon based anions
produced during bacterial fermentation, of which, acetate (C2), pro-
pionate (C3) and butyrate (C4) are most abundantly produced. SCFA
are produced naturally within the colon by fermentation of carbohy-
drates, both dietary and endogenous, and protein that are accessible
to the microbiota. Fermentation is a process that has also been
exploited by humans for thousands of years in the production of
foods and beverages, which consequently, contain SCFA.
Epidemiological
evidence
suggests
there
is
an
association
between dietary fibre consumption and reduced risk of developing
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and colon cancer.1-3 SCFA may play
a role in conferring such effects by directly affecting cell activity and
function. A strong body of research, mostly in animal models demon-
strates that SCFA affect outcomes of health and disease. However,
this is yet to be conclusively translated in a clinical setting. The aims
of this review are: (1) to provide an overview of the putative mecha-
nisms by which SCFA can modulate human health and disease; (2) to
highlight the spectrum of diseases that have been linked to SCFA;
and (3) to discuss aspects of SCFA physiology and metabolism in the
context of utilising SCFA for therapeutic use.

METHODS
A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Scopus
and Google Scholar databases using combinations of search terms:
‘short-chain fatty acids’, ‘acetate’, ‘propionate’, ‘butyrate’, ‘dietary
fibre’, ‘inflammation’, ‘immune’, ‘metabolism’, ‘fermentation’, ‘gastroin-
testinal’, ‘colon’, ‘Inflammatory bowel disease’, ‘colitis’, ‘autoimmune’,
‘allergy’. Both clinical and pre-clinical studies were included for the
purposes of this explanatory review. Papers that were not in English
or did not have a full-text were excluded from the review.

SOURCES OF SCFA
Short chain fatty acids can be either ingested in the diet or produced
via metabolic processes within body tissues during fasting condi-
tions, after consumption of alcohol, and within the bowel lumen.4,5
By far the major source of SCFA in the colon is bacterial fermenta-
tion of carbohydrates, which can be endogenous or dietary in origin.
The essential role of the microbiota in generating SCFA has been
highlighted in studies of germ-free mice, in which very low levels of
SCFA are produced compared to those in conventional mice, reflect-
ing the relatively small amount of SCFA obtained directly from
dietary sources and endogenous, non-microbial production.6 Addi-
tionally, protein can also be utilised as a substrate for SCFA
production
by
the
gut
microbiota
during
dissimilatory
amino
acid metabolism, producing branched-chain fatty acids such as iso-
butyrate and iso-valerate.7 Dietary carbohydrates that reach the
colonic
lumen,
usually
referred
to
as
dietary
fibre,
are
the
quantitatively most important substrate for saccharolytic bacteria in
the colon and the consumption of fermentable fibres increases colo-
nic production of SCFA.8

SCFA production in vivo by fermentation of
dietary fibres
There are many definitions of “dietary fibre”. Many countries, includ-
ing Australia, Japan and those within the EU accept dietary fibre as
carbohydrates with a degree of polymerisation greater than 2 that
fail to be hydrolysed or absorbed in the small intestine, as outlined
by Codex Alimentarius Alinorm.9 This definition is yet to be fully
accepted in the USA, whereby dietary fibre is defined as non-digesti-
ble carbohydrates and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.
Irrespective of variations of definition, fibre is a crude term that rep-
resents a diverse group of non-digestible carbohydrates with varying
structural and functional properties that include ability to hold water
(solubility), to be metabolised to SCFA by intestinal microbiota (fer-
mentation), to selectively stimulate the growth of health-promoting
bacteria (prebiotic effect) and to bind and modulate other events
such as the inhibition of emulsifier-induced bacterial translocation
(post-biotic effect).10,11 Therefore, it is important to consider that
not all subtypes of dietary fibre contribute to the SCFA pool and not
all putative fibre-associated modulation of colonic health occurs via
SCFA. For example, non-fermentable plant fibres such as cellulose
cannot be utilised by the human gut microbiota, but increase faecal
bulking, which stimulates peristalsis and hence reduces transit time
through the colon.12 This effect presumably underlies its value for
treating constipation and contributes to reducing the tumour load in
rodent models of colorectal cancer.13,14
Fermentable fibres vary in the rapidity by which they are fer-
mented12 and in the SCFA profiles resulting. Factors that modulate
or influence these characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The deliv-
ery of SCFA to different regions of the colon also varies, and this
has been of interest due to the rapid uptake of SCFA by epithelium
and the subsequent local effects of such uptake. For example, the
preventive effect of SCFA on colorectal carcinogenesis via the ade-
noma-carcinoma sequence in a rat model was clearly related to pro-
motion of distal colonic fermentation rather than fermentation
per se.14 Most data available on regional SCFA production profiles
have been generated from animal studies and have been extrapo-
lated to humans, where observations are largely restricted to studies
of faeces and blood. Interpretation of the findings in faeces, for
example, is limited as such measurements are unlikely to capture the
dynamic processes of fermentation and absorption that occur more
proximally along the colon. Information about concentrations of
SCFA along the colon have relied on data from sudden death vic-
tims, which indicated that SCFA concentrations are highest in the
proximal colon, means values being 69, 25 and 25 mmol/L for acet-
ate, propionate and butyrate, respectively.35 These high concentra-
tions of SCFA are reflected by the low luminal pH in the ascending
colon, which contrasts higher pH and lower SCFA concentrations in
the faeces.36,37 The use of an ingestible pH-sensing device that
16 |
GILL ET AL.
 sends information in real-time via telemetry has the potential to
more accurately characterise this process, although there are other
molecules that also influence pH such as lactate and succinate.38
Production of a compact and robust bio-electrolytic sensor for real-
time measurement of colonic SCFA production is desirable, with pro-
totype sensors in development.39
There are two major factors that influence the regional produc-
tion of SCFA:
1. The type of fibre: Slowly fermentable fibres may shift SCFA pro-
duction from more rapidly fermented fibres from only the proxi-
mal colon towards the distal colon. Consumption of wheat bran
with a relatively rapidly fermented resistant starch increased
SCFA concentrations in the distal colon of pigs and rats com-
pared to those fed only resistant starch.40,41 Healthy humans
were able to increase faecal concentrations of SCFA, especially
butyrate, by addition of wheat bran to resistant starch that failed
to alter faecal SCFA alone. This observation is considered strong
evidence that fermentation had been shifted distally as in the
animal studies.37
2. Gut transit time: Changing the rate of transit along the colon will
alter the time for fermentation and, hypothetically alter SCFA
absorption in the proximal colon. For example, faecal butyrate
concentrations increase with more rapid colonic transit without a
change in dietary fibre intake in humans.42 Drugs that slow or
hasten colonic transit, such as loperamide and cisapride, respec-
tively, alter SCFA production.43 However, SCFA themselves have
been reported to alter transit time in rodent models by acting on
colonic smooth muscle tissue, releasing polypeptide YY (PYY).44
This may occur via direct engagement of GPR43 (FFAR2) on colo-
nic L-enteroendocrine cells.45 A rise in post-prandial PYY has
been observed in humans given SCFA, both via colonic enemas
and through consumption of propionated-inulin.46,47 Colonic infu-
sion of PYY also led to a shortening in transit time, highlighting a
dynamic relationship between SCFA production, PYY and gut
transit time.48

Endogenous metabolic processes that
generate SCFA
There are a few pathways for genesis of SCFA endogenously. First,
fat oxidation, predominantly during starvation-associated ketosis
leads to the production of acetate, propionate and butyrate.49 Long-
chain fatty acids and pyruvate may be converted to acetyl-CoA,
which is then broken down to acetate through the actions of acetyl-
CoA hydrolase. Animal studies have found that acetyl-CoA hydrolase
is expressed in all tissues, with highest activity found in liver and
muscle.49 Secondly, acetate may also be produced in the liver on
exposure to ethanol through the actions of alcohol dehydrogenase
and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Plasma acetate flux has been reported
to increase 2.5 times in healthy males who consumed 24 g of radio-
labelled ethanol, resulting in a rapid increase to serum concentra-
tions.5 Serum acetate concentrations in healthy males and females
may rise to approximately 500 lmol/L, 75 min after a 0.5 g/kg dose

 of alcohol.50 Thirdly, propionate may be produced endogenously
from branched-chain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids via pro-
pionyl-CoA.51
The contribution of metabolically derived to plasma levels of
SCFA varies according to the setting. In healthy humans, fatty acid
oxidation and ketosis may contribute to a 60 lmol/L increase in
plasma acetate levels in those fasting for three consecutive days, but
this was not seen in those who underwent a 12-h overnight fast.52
The contribution of metabolic processes to plasma SCFA levels is
not thought to be significant in those living a normal lifestyle. For
propionate and butyrate, utilisation in the tissues readily accounts
for any metabolic contribution.51,53 Thus, plasma concentrations are
generally <10 lmol/L and butyrate <5 lmol/L.53 Variation in plasma
SCFA levels observed in healthy volunteers over the course of a day
is most likely due to changes in the rate of colonic fermentation
according to its exposure to dietary cabohydrates.53 However, there
are two exceptions. First, diabetic individuals have elevated fasting
plasma SCFA levels close to double that of healthy controls, a reflec-
tion of increased metabolic production from fatty acid oxidation and
ketosis due to poor glycaemic control.54 Secondly, the plasma acet-
ate response to ethanol can be considerable as outlined above.

SCFA intake via food
The fermentation process has been utilised for millennia by humans
in the production of various fermented foods and drinks. Unlike that
carried out by the gut microbiota, this process of fermentation must
be tightly controlled to ensure the final product is free from patho-
genic bacteria and potentially toxic metabolites. Due to the odorous
properties of SCFA, their concentrations are routinely quantified dur-
ing quality control processes within the food and beverage industry.
However, limited published information exists regarding SCFA quan-
tities in foods.55
Within the dairy industry, predominately lactic acid producing
bacteria are selected for starter cultures responsible for fermenta-
tion.56 Commonly selected cultures in commercial products include
Bifidobacterium lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus aci-
dophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaris.57 These bacteria utilise the Emb-
den-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway, fermenting hydrolysed sugars to
pyruvate and lactate.56 These products may be further broken down
to acetic acid during glycolysis in carbon restrictive environments.
Acetic acid producing bacteria from the Acetobacter and Gluconobac-
ter genera are found in starter cultures used to create traditional fer-
mented products such as vinegar and kombucha.58,59 Consequently,
these products will or are likely to have higher levels of acetic acid
than other fermented foods. The addition of the fungus, Penicillium
roqueforti to starter cultures of soft cheeses further enhances SCFA
production from lipolysis, resulting in production of other SCFAs
such as propionate and butyrate.60 This occurs predominately during
the ripening process of blue cheeses.
Bacterial starter cultures chosen for fermentation are highly sen-
sitive to environmental factors. Oxygen levels, temperature and pH
must
be
tightly
controlled
to
create
optimal
conditions.61,62
Hydrolysed lipids are a key substrate for SCFA production and thus,
the concentration at which they are present in the fermentation
mixture will determine the capacity of SCFA production. Addition
of lipase to starter cultures is utilised in cheese manufacturing in
order to improve SCFA production for enhanced flavour.63 Further-
more, fibres such as inulin may also improve viability of bacterial
cultures and has been reported to increase SCFA production in
yoghurt.64

PHARMACOKINETICS OF SCFA
Within the colon, approximately 60% of SCFA diffuse from the
lumen through the epithelium to the lamina propria with the remain-
ing portion taken up directly by epithelial cells.65 Epithelial uptake
can be by diffusion of unionised SCFA, or receptor-mediated via by
both hydrogen- (MCT-1) and sodium-coupled (SMCT-1) transporters,
the latter of which has a higher affinity for SCFA.66-68 Receptor-
mediated uptake is a dynamic process that is sensitive to both physi-
ological and microbial factors in the colonic environment. While
expression of these transporters on the apical membrane of colonic
epithelial cells is constitutive, it is also regulated by factors in the
local environment. Butyrate has been shown to induce transcrip-
tional modulation of MCT-1 on colonic epithelial cells within 30 min
of exposure, resulting in increased abundance on the apical mem-
brane.69 This effect is also seen in mice fed pectin. Bile acids may
competitively
inhibit
both
SMCT-1
and
MCT-1,
although
less
potently in the latter.70 Furthermore, microbiota may have both pos-
itive and negative effects on butyrate uptake. For example, entero-
pathogenic Escherichia coli induces endocytosis of MCT-1, whilst this
phenomenon is attenuated in the presence of Lactobacilli acidophilus,
stimulating MCT-1 function.71
Short chain fatty acids delivered to the lamina propria enters the
blood vessels and are taken via the portal vein to the liver where
the vast majority is metabolised on first pass; only acetate is detect-
able at physiologically significant concentrations in the peripheral
blood.72 It has been estimated that 36% of colonic-derived acetate
becomes systemically available, in contrast to only 9% of propionate
and 2% of butyrate.73 In healthy subjects, fasting levels of acetate in
peripheral blood have been reported to rise from a mean of 54 to
169 lmol/L, 6-8 h after consumption of a 24-h high resistant starch
diet, although this rise of >100 lmol/L has not been achieved
through the use of inulin, guar gum or XOS fibre supplements.74-77
Circulating concentrations of SCFA levels are likely to be tightly con-
trolled by energy levels within the body, as SCFA are known sub-
strates for the production of glucose, fatty acids and ketone bodies,
outlined in Figure 1.31 Intravenously delivered acetate is rapidly
metabolised, creating a temporary increase in plasma levels that is
cleared within an hour.78 In studies using radiolabelled SCFA,
endogenous turnover of acetate is much lower in humans than in
smaller animals such as dogs and rats, reflecting differences in the
production and utilisation of acetate within cells and tissues of these
animals. Such endogenous variation highlights a major limitation to

 extrapolation of peripheral effects of SCFA in animal models of
human disease to the human situation.4

Molecular and metabolic interactions of SCFA
SCFA can modulate cellular activity both extra- and intracellularly.
1. Extracellular activity via SCFA-specific G-protein coupled receptors
(GPRs): GPR41 (also known as free fatty acid receptor 3 [FFAR3]),
GPR43 (FFAR2) and GPR109a (PUMA-G) are activated by ionised
SCFA and signal downstream to the nucleus.79,80 SCFA-specific
GPRs are expressed at a functional level on the surface of a wide
range of cells that include gut epithelial cells, adipocytes, enteroen-
docrine L-cells, innate immune cells, and neurons of the automatic
and somatic sensory ganglia.81,82 In transfected cell lines, human
GPR43 may be activated by acetate and propionate at an effective
half-maximal concentration (EC50) of approximately 50-200 lmol/
L, depending on the expression system and cell line used.79,83 Propi-
onate can activate GPR41 with an EC50 of 10 lmol/L.83 Given that
these concentrations may be found in the circulation, it is plausible
that GPR43 and 41 are biologically active systemically. GPR109a is
selective for butyrate but is relatively less potent, requiring a con-
centration closer to 1 mmol/L, a concentration only found in the
lumen of the terminal ileum and along the length of the colon.35,84
2. Intracellular inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs): These
enzymes are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expres-
sion.85 While HDACs are a family of enzymes constitutively
expressed within all cells, SCFA appear to inhibit only type 1 and
type 2 HDAC.86 The mechanism of action for such inhibition has
yet to be fully elucidated, but it has been proposed that a pair of
butyrate molecules could sit in the hydrophobic binding cleft of
the active site.87 Butyrate is the most potent HDAC inhibitor
(HDACi), with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10-
100 lmol/L in human cell lines.85 Propionate and, to a lesser
extent acetate, also have inhibitory properties at a concentrations
of 100-1000 lmol/L.88
3. Intracellular energy supply for colonic epithelium: Beta-oxidation of
butyrate specifically is the preferred energy source for colonic
epithelial cells (see below).
4. Substrates for the Krebs cycle: The main site of SCFA metabolism
via the Kreb’s cycle is within hepatocytes of the liver, where pro-
pionate is a major substrate for gluconeogenesis, and butyrate
for lipogenesis.31 Furthermore, cholesterol can be synthesized
from acetate and butyrate. Alterations in cellular energy levels as
a direct consequence of these metabolic changes will also influ-
ence cell behaviour.89
5. Induction of apoptosis: At higher concentrations, butyrate and
other SCFA induce apoptosis of cells. Extracellular concentrations
that have this action in vitro are in the range of 2-10 mmol/L; a
concentration of 8 mmol/L induced apoptosis in normal colonic
crypt cells.90,91 Only surface colonic epithelial cells will be
exposed to such concentrations under physiological conditions,
and such an action probably plays an important role in epithelial
cell kinetics. This effect, however, may hypothetically occur in
crypt cells when very high luminal concentrations are achieved;
this might at least partly underlie the increased colonic epithelial
permeability,
heightened
translocation
of
Salmonella
and
increased mucus secretion induced by high doses of rapidly fer-
mentable substrates in rat and humans (to a lesser extent).92-94
Furthermore, high doses of dietary uncooked potato starch that
achieved high SCFA luminal concentrations were associated with
induced epithelial injury and promoted carcinogenesis.92,95,96

and butyrate may be converted to the central metabolite, acetyl-CoA. Consequently, these SCFA can be utilized to form lipids and ketone
bodies. SCFA may also enter the citric acid cycle and become utilized for glucose production via gluconeogenesis. (3) Acetate may also pass
through into the peripheral circulation and can be detected in peripheral blood

 Given the range of molecular and metabolic interactions charac-
terised for SCFA, it remains unclear how or why SCFA show pref-
erence for HDAC inhibition or GPR activation within different cell
types, before being metabolised. The kinetics between GPR and
SCFA transporters on the surface of cells, and what potential fac-
tors regulate interaction with cognate SCFA also remains unknown.
Variation in SCFA concentration at different sites of the body, in
SCFA transporter expression (for example, expression of SMCT-1 is
almost exclusively limited to brush border of colonic epithelial cells,
while MCT-1 is expressed by almost all tissues97,98) and in the con-
centration required to elicit an effect via GPR/HDAC, results in a
scenario where SCFA-mediated effects are extremely tissue spe-
cific. Regardless, the aforementioned mechanisms have been heavily
implicated in health and disease, both within the colon and at
peripheral sites.

SCFA IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
5.1
|
Maintenance of the colonic epithelium
It is well-established that SCFA play a critical role in colonic health,
particularly in maintenance of the epithelial lining. Their plentiful
presence is critical for the turnover and differentiation of colonic
epithelial cells. Very low luminal SCFA exposure to the colonic
epithelium is associated with mucosal hypoplasia, reduced epithelial
proliferation and differentiation of the epithelium, and mucosal
atrophy in experimental animals and humans when luminal sub-
strates are reduced via parenteral nutrition, elemental diet or diver-
sion of the faecal stream.99-101 In animal models, consumption of a
diet high in resistant starch induces changes in metabolic gene
expression towards glucose and fatty acid metabolism within the
colonic epithelial cells, likely through increased uptake of SCFA.102
There is also evidence that high concentrations might have toxic
effects on the epithelium in rats (as discussed above), just as SCFA
do on cell lines in vitro.103 Thus, colonic epithelium starved or
swamped with SCFA have impaired structure and function. How-
ever, whether differences in SCFA delivery to the epithelium within
the physiological range have specific modulating effects on epithe-
lial homeostasis, such as affecting epithelial turnover and differenti-
ation or barrier function, has not been convincingly demonstrated
in humans and animals. This is despite multiple actions of butyrate
particularly in many cellular processes. Some of these included
modulation of specific enzyme systems such as urokinase, reduction
in paracellular permeability or promotion of epithelial cell restitution
after injury in the Caco-2 model of colonic epithelium,104-106 stimu-
lation of mucus production in another cell line, which in turn
prevented epithelial adherence of pathogenic bacteria,107 HDAC1-
mediated promotion of expression of structural proteins responsible
for
maintaining
tight
junctions,108,109
and
increased
epithelial
biosynthesis of retinoic acid, an important mediator of immune
homeostasis in the gut.110 All of these phenomena are consistent
with a positive effect of butyrate in epithelial turnover and barrier
function.

Anti-tumour effects
Butyrate has been extensively studied for its anti-tumour effects in
both human colonic carcinoma cell lines and in animal models.14,111
Its topical delivery to the colonic epithelium reduced early tumouri-
genic effects (aberrant crypt formation) in the rat azoxymethane
model.112 To date, however, the development of butyrate as a
chemotherapeutic agent has not progressed beyond phase I stud-
ies.113 A major limitation has been delivering butyrate to the correct
location at sufficient concentrations. It needs to be delivered topi-
cally. If the rectum is used as the portal of entry, it needs to be
given frequently, since twice daily enemas failed to specifically
reduce aberrant crypt formation in rats, but five times daily did.112
The use of oral preparations of butyrate itself failed to deliver it to
the distal colon. Fibre combinations can enhance distal colonic deliv-
ery, but such combinations have not shown consistent benefits in
human intervention studies. Modified forms of resistant starch com-
posed of butyrate molecules esterfied to the sugar backbone can
increase butyrate delivery to the distal colon and have anti-tumouri-
genic effects in rats, but the effects of this strategy in humans have
not yet been clearly reported.114
The complexity of butyrate’s effects is compounded by confusion
over the “butyrate paradox” by which this SCFA has seemingly both
pro-tumour and anti-tumour properties.115 The effects of butyrate
have been shown to be altered by the degree of differentiation of
the cell.116 Migration of intestinal epithelial crypt cells to the surface
epithelium is increased in the presence of SCFA, therefore promot-
ing epithelial cell proliferation.117 It has been suggested that butyrate
may confer its anti-tumour effect via inhibition of HDACs that con-
trol gene expression within the cell. Indeed, the butyrate paradox is
likely to be a result of the complex role of SCFA in regulating cellular
metabolism and epigenetics, seen in the Warburg effect.118 Cells in
a cancerous state primarily undergo anaerobic glycolysis. This causes
butyrate to accumulate within the cell to a concentration whereby it
may inhibit HDAC, resulting in increased expression of apoptotic
genes. Conversely, healthy cells metabolise butyrate whilst undergo-
ing oxidative phosphorylation. Within this metabolic pathway it is
converted to acetyl-CoA, a co-factor that promotes expression of
cell proliferation genes.119 This may drive polyp formation in vivo. In
the
adenomatous
polyposis
coli

homolog
2
(MHS2)�/� mouse model of colorectal cancer, butyrate acted as an
oncometabolite driving polyp formation, when administered as a
colonic enema at concentrations between 50 lM and 0.5 mM.120
However, engagement of butyrate-specific GPR109a on colonic
epithelial cells may also confer protection from cancer by upregulat-
ing tumour suppressor genes Slc5a8, Msh2 and Msh3.121

 inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-17, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12 and
TNF-a by colonic epithelial cells.115,122-125 This may be through acti-
vation of the MEK-ERK and p38 MAPK intracellular signalling path-
ways by SCFA engaging GPR41 and GPR43 on the surface of
colonic epithelial cells.123 Murine models have implicated both a
pro- and anti-inflammatory role for SCFA dependent effects on the
colonic epithelium, ultimately reflecting the complex nature of home-
ostasis within the gut.123,126 This may also involve SCFA-dependent
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via GPR43 and GPR109a,
promoting production of IL-18.127 Indirect effects of butyrate on
inflammation via the maintenance of a healthy colonic epithelial bar-
rier as outlined above are also of likely importance.

Effects of SCFA on immune cells
As illustrated in Figure 2, SCFA may directly affect immune cells, not
only via long-recognised direct inhibitory effects on cell division, but
also via modulation of cell signalling, epigenetic regulation and meta-
bolism, the molecular mechanisms of which have now also been
described.128,129 These could occur during the innate response by
affecting macrophages and granulocytes, as well as antigen presenta-
tion by dendritic cells, and also during adaptive immune responses
by affecting T and B cell function.

Effects on innate immune cells
Butyrate regulates many subsets of innate cells of the mucosal
immune system via inhibition of NF-KB nuclear translocation and
HDAC.88,130 First, CD11b+CD11c� intestinal macrophages downreg-
ulate production of inflammatory IL-6 and IL-12 in response to buty-
rate.131 Secondly, polarisation of macrophages to the alternative M2
phenotype in the presence of IL-4 may be enhanced, attenuating
DSS-induced inflammation in a murine colitis model.132 Thirdly,
butyrate down-regulates genes involved in activation of lamina pro-
pria-residing CD103+ dendritic cells, thus giving them a tolerance-
promoting phenotype.133 In addition, engagement of GPR109a by
butyrate on this dendritic cell subset appears to control the activity
of
the
tolerogenic
retinoic
acid-producing
enzyme,
RALDH.134
Indeed, co-culture of CD4+ helper (Th) cells with SCFA-treated den-
dritic cells drives the conversion of T cells towards a Foxp3+ regula-
tory T (Treg) cell phenotype. Conversely, SCFA-treated GPR109�/�
dendritic cells fail to induce Treg formation and, instead promote the
inflammatory Th17 phenotype.121,133
Neutrophils in vitro chemotactically respond to acetate at con-
centrations typically found in human peripheral blood. However, it is
not known if this could modulate neutrophil function in the periph-
ery, as the presence of such a concentration gradient has not been
characterised in vivo.135 Indeed, neutrophils exposed to SCFA appear
to downregulate expression of the inflammatory receptors C5aR and
CXCR2 via a GPR43-dependent mechanism.140 Furthermore, buty-
rate decreases neutrophilic expression of the inflammatory mediators
TNF-a and nitric oxide.136 It is important to consider that, in the
context of infection, SCFA could potentially exert unfavourable
effects on the host by inhibiting pro-inflammatory activity. Addition
of SCFA to the site of subcutaneous infection in mice was found to
impair phagocytosis by neutrophils recruited to the site of infection
and was also associated with increases in bacterial load.137 During
colonic Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice, however, provision of
acetate enhances IL-6-dependent recruitment of neutrophils to sites
of infection.123 Taken together, these observations highlight that
SCFA may modulate neutrophilic activity. The extent to which this is
pro- or anti-inflammatory is likely to be dependent on the immuno-
logical milieu within the site of action.

Effects regulatory T cells
Direct effects of SCFA on Treg cells has been of interest as deficien-
cies in these cells have been implicated in both mucosal and sys-
temic immune disease.138,139 Indeed, transfer into germ-free mice of
a group of SCFA-producing strains of Clostridia isolated from the
human intestinal microbiota promoted the generation of protective
colonic Treg cells.140 Mice given 150 mmol/L SCFA in the drinking
water have increased colonic T cell expression of Foxp3, the lineage
specification factor of Treg cells.141 The mechanism through which
this occurs remains unclear. Initial murine studies reported that this
Foxp3 induction was dependent on engagement of GPR43 by SCFA,
both individually and in combination.141 However, as T and B cells
do not express functional levels of this receptor, SCFA-mediated
HDAC inhibition has been implicated.88 Within Treg cells, the
HDAC9
isoform
has
been
proposed
to
directly
contribute
to
increased transcription of Foxp3.142 As a consequence, increased
acetylation of signalling protein S6 Kinase (S6K) within the mTOR
pathway may also increase cellular metabolism, contributing to
enhanced suppressive function.88,143
Although SCFA increase expression of the colonic homing recep-
tor, GPR15 on Treg cells,144 they also appear to boost peripheral
Treg numbers in murine models.133 This effect is yet to be studied
in humans, but the ratio of Treg:Th17 cells increases in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated in vitro with SCFA.145
Numerous studies have highlighted similar anti-inflammatory changes
to peripheral blood mononuclear cells.146-149 As reported concentra-
tions of SCFA used in these in vitro studies are upwards of 50-fold
greater than physiological concentration in the peripheral blood,35 it
is unlikely that such effects could be validly translated to the same
situation in vivo. SCFA may also confer anti-inflammatory effects on
immune cells in the dermis, a site where SCFA-producing commensal
bacteria are present. Topical application of butyrate induced the for-
mation of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the skin of mice and was also associ-
ated with reduced swelling in a model of contact hypersensitivity.150

Effects on B cells and antibody production
Increased appreciation for effects of SCFAs on B cells is also emerg-
ing. Increased delivery of acetate to the colon via acetylated-
starches resulted in a tolerogenic B cell phenotype in non-obese
diabetic (NOD) mice; with splenic B cells from these mice found to

 have reduced expression of MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules
CD80 and CD86.151 SCFA may both indirectly and directly enhance
IgA and IgG antibody responses. GPR43 engagement by SCFA on
dendritic cells upregulates retinoic acid production, which in turn has
been found to induce IgA production by B cells.152 SCFA have also
been reported to directly activate the mTOR pathway in B cells,
leading to, increased glucose uptake, glycolytic activity and terminal
differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.153 Such observa-
tions highlight an important role for SCFA in regulating B cell func-
tion via metabolic changes within the cell.

SCFA in immune disorders
Short chain fatty acids have now been implicated in a wide spectrum
of inflammatory diseases shown in Table 2. Although the majority of
studies show the association of SCFA with protection from develop-
ment of disease, the opposite may occur. Thus, provision of SCFA in
the drinking water caused levels of SCFA to accumulate in the renal
tissue, resulting in severe T-cell mediated inflammation.154 Further-
more, the potency of each SCFA varies across disease models and
has resulted in a varying array of proposed mechanisms put forward.
For example, the protective effect of SCFA in asthma models has
been reported to occur via propionate-mediated effects on dendritic
cell development and subsequent antigen-presenting function in the
house-dust mite model, but also via acetate-mediated promotion of
protective

model.142,155 Collectively, these studies lack supportive data in
humans, in whom many studies have been unable to provide an ade-
quate dose of fermentable fibre or have failed to examine the puta-
tive mechanisms put forward by animal studies.156,157 There is a
need for increased collaboration between immunologists, nutrition
scientists and dietitians to ensure studies are correctly designed to
translate into clinical findings.

Metabolic effects
Short chain fatty acids can be used for de novo synthesis of glucose
and lipids, providing a rationale for studying a potential role for
SCFA in modulating energy homeostasis and metabolism.31 Multiple
metabolic effects of SCFA have been reported and these include the
following:
1. Control of obesity: Epidemiological evidence suggests a protective
role for fibre in the development of obesity.161 If causal, SCFA
may be involved. SCFA activation of GPR43 in white adipose tis-
sue decreases fatty acid uptake, supressing fat accumulation.162
Furthermore, GPR43 activation on brown adipocytes promotes
mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing the capacity of the cell to
utilize energy for thermogenesis.163 Although these effects are
difficult to observe in vivo, a distal colonic infusion of acetate
was shown to increase fasting fat oxidation in overweight
men.164 Control of energy intake may also be mediated by SCFA.
GPR41 activation by propionate stimulates production of the
satiety hormone leptin by adipocytes.165 In contrast, enhanced
SCFA delivery might promote obesity. Comparative studies of
faecal microbiota have highlighted that obese and overweight
individuals have different bacterial profiles and faecal concentra-
tions of SCFA, particularly propionate, are increased in the
obese.166 However, as no assessment of the diets of the subjects
studied was made, the results cannot be interpreted in terms of
enhanced capacity to harvest energy in the form of increased
SCFA production, as was deduced from microbiota studies in lean
and obese mice.167
2. Control of glucose homeostasis: A role for SCFA in maintaining
glucose homeostasis has also been documented; consumption
of an arabinoxylan-rich diet increases plasma SCFA and improve
glucose tolerance in type II diabetics.168,169 Mechanistically,
SCFA can directly stimulate GPR43 on colonic enteroendocrine
cells to produce glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, improving glu-
cose homeostasis during feeding.170 Propionate has also been
reported to elicit a similar effect on ileal cells by activating a
GLP-1 dependent neuronal network via GPR43, highlighting
that direct consumption of SCFA may also improve glucose tol-
erance.171 Studies in Gpr43�/� mice have also implicated a role
for direct stimulation of GPR43 in promoting pancreatic b-cell
proliferation.172 However, SCFA were not observed to stimulate
this pathway. Propionate may also signal via a GPR41-mediated
gut-brain pathway to increase intestinal gluconeogenesis, shown
to
be
associated
with
improved
glucose
homeostasis
and
decreased weight gain in mice.173 To confuse the issue, Perry
et al have proposed that increased colonic acetate production
could
promote
increased
glucose
stimulated
b-cell
insulin
release via the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to insu-
lin resistance.174
3. Appetite regulation: GPR41 activation by propionate stimulates
production of the satiety hormone, leptin, by adipocytes.165 Inu-
lin challenge, purported to specifically increase colonic propi-
onate production, was reported to be associated with reduced
desire for high energy foods and led to decreased energy intake
in healthy men.175 However, inulin has multiple effects, includ-
ing intestinal distension with its potential for inducing abdomi-
nal symptoms and elevating production of other SCFA. Given
that acetate can cross the blood-brain barrier,176 SCFA may act
as signalling molecules in a bi-directional gut-brain pathway
responsible for control of energy homeostasis. Indeed, acetate
has also been reported to have a role in modulating central
appetite regulation in humans.78 Murine studies have elucidated
that this may be via inhibition of neuronal circuits within the
brain that control release of the PYY in the gut.177 Moreover,
GPR41 has been found to be expressed on sympathetic ganglia
of humans.178 Taken together, these observations suggest that
SCFA may regulate neuronal pathways that control feeding
behaviours.
4. Cardiovascular effects: SCFA may also play a role in regulating
blood pressure. Provision of acetate in the drinking water
reduces cardiac hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic blood pressure

 in deoxycorticosterone acetate-treated mice.179 Although the
mechanism behind such observations are not fully elucidated,
GPR41 is expressed on the surface of murine endothelial cells,
potentially implicating a role for propionate in regulating blood
pressure.180

UTILISING SCFA AS A THERAPEUTIC
FOR INFLAMMATORY DISEASE
Human randomised control trials are needed to confirm the wide
range of therapeutic and protective effects of SCFA reported in
animal studies. However, these animal studies do not directly
translate into human intervention studies owing to the huge quan-
tities of dietary fibre used. Daily fibre intake by a mouse on a
murine high fibre diet has been estimated to be equivalent to
274 g/day for a human, approximately 9.7 times that of the rec-
ommended intake of 30 g/day.127 Such doses in humans would
neither be possible or tolerated. Therefore, alternative approaches
are needed to obtain adequate levels of SCFA in the colon and
peripheral tissues in humans. Several delivery methods can be
applied as shown in Figure 3.
6.1
|
Delivery by a pro-drug approach
Tributyrin, a butyrate prodrug, may increase serum butyrate to a
median level of 52 lmol/L with an oral dose of 200 mg/kg given
three times daily.181 However, clinical use of tributyrin has been lim-
ited by large intra-individual variation in serum butyrate and the
impractical number of capsules required. Incorporation of tributyrin
in microcapsules made from the 8-membered sugar ring molecule, ɣ-
cyclodextrin appears to protect the compound from release in the
upper gastrointestinal tract.182 This reduces the unpleasant sensory
characteristics of tributyrin and promotes delivery to the small intes-
tine and colon. There are as yet no reports of its application in a
clinical trial.
6.2

Fermentable fibre
Highly fermentable fibres, such as inulin and guar gum can produce
a significant rise in plasma SCFA levels within 6 h when consumed
as a 20-30 g supplement.76,77 Furthermore, longer term consumption
in studies ranging from days to weeks, of a similar dose of resistant
starch increases faecal levels of total SCFA and butyrate.24,183,184
These fibre doses are reported as tolerable within study cohorts but

 gastrointestinal symptoms, are generally increased, making it unlikely
that regular consumption of such doses would be tolerated amongst
all members of the general public.
Combining these fibres with slowly fermentable wheat bran may
promote the generation of SCFA along the entire length of the
colon.37 Of particular interest has been high amylose maize starch
(HAMS), a source of type 2 resistant starch that is commercially
available and can provide high levels of resistant starch after cooking
and freezing.185 Consumption of breads and baked goods containing
HAMS increased faecal SCFA output in human subjects with hyper-
triglyceridaemia.186 Arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS), another
type of highly fermentable fibre produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of
arabinoxylan, can be produced in bread by the addition of xylanase
into the dough prior to baking.187 Consumption of a 140 g serving
of white bread containing 18 g of added AXOS increased peripheral
serum levels of acetate, butyrate and total SCFA in young adults and
was also observed to improve overnight glucose tolerance.169 A
major limitation of utilising a dietary approach to delivering SCFA in
the colon is the variable nature of SCFA production seen in response
to consumption of fermentable fibre, as discussed earlier.24 Further-
more, encouraging the general public to consume an adequate dose
of fermentable fibre that will achieve sufficient boosting of SCFA
production has been challenging.188 This has highlighted a need for
more targeted approaches that are compatible with a wider variety
of gut microbiota profiles.

Chemically modified resistant starch
Esterfication of SCFAs to resistant starch protects them from release
and absorption in the small intestine. Such chemical modification
combines
both
postbiotic
and
dietary
approaches,
generating
efficient and preferential delivery of each SCFA to the colon when
compared to unmodified resistant starch.189 Thus, consumption of
these starches produces a significant increase in SCFA levels in
stoma digesta from Ileostomy patients and faeces from healthy con-
trols.190,191 Moreover, consumption of 40 g of butyrylated starch
per day protected healthy controls from the development of colonic
tumourigenic adducts induced by concurrent consumption of a
300 g/day high red meat diet.192 These starches confer significant
protection against autoimmune T1 diabetes in NOD mice.151 Esterifi-
cation of propionate to inulin has also been reported, with the syn-
thetic process proposed as a more efficient alternative to using
starch, with 10 g of propionated inulin estimated to deliver the
equivalent amount of propionate to the colon as 90 g of non-starch
polysaccharide.46,193 This dose has also been observed to increase
post-prandial plasma PYY and GLP-1, with long-term ingestion
reducing weight gain in obese individuals.46 These studies highlight
therapeutic effects achieved through targeted and efficient delivery
of SCFA to the colon, representing a potentially desirable approach
for use in future randomised control trials.
There are potential short-comings of these approaches. Practi-
cal aspects such as taste and smell may be an issue, despite being
reported as tolerable when consumed as a drink in healthy sub-
jects.156 Whether they can be incorporated into food without
imparting
unpleasant
taste needs
also to be addressed. Their
safety has received limited attention. As discussed above, SCFA
may be toxic at very high luminal concentrations in the colonic
lumen. The presence of SCFA in defined gut microbiota growth
medium inhibits the growth of key Bacteroidetes species of the
human gut microbiota.194 Furthermore, the lowering of the luminal
pH is associated with inhibited metabolic activity of luminal bacte-
ria, which potentially may have deleterious effects on other func-
tions
of
the
microbiota.27
However,
little
is
known
of
what
luminal concentrations of SCFA and of what pH profiles are
achieved by these compounds. On the other hand, inhibition of
fermentation will lead to more starch being available for fermenta-
tion in the distal colon, which could result in reduced protein fer-
mentation.7 Clearly, more studies are needed to determine the
physiological and microbiological effects of such modified carbohy-
drate use.

Direct “postbiotic” delivery of SCFA
Direct delivery of SCFA in the gut without the need for fermenta-
tion has been explored as a “postbiotic” treatment for disease.195
There has been particular focus in IBDs and colitis, whereby
impaired
SCFA-epithelial
interaction
may
contribute
to
disease
pathology.196 A number of open-label and RCTs trialling postbiotic
butyrate and SCFAs within IBD and colitis patients have been con-
ducted, the results of which are summarised in Table 3. Treatment
with SCFA enemas appeared to improve histological and endoscopy
disease scores in an initial open label study in diversion colitis
patients.197 This effect was less clear in randomised placebo-con-
trolled clinical trials in larger cohorts of patients with active distal

 ulcerative colitis and diversion colitis, with SCFA enemas not improv-
ing clinical indices of disease when compared to placebo.198-201
Although enemas improved clinical indices of disease when com-
pared to pre-treatment, a higher than expected response to placebo
occurred in many trials. Saline enemas, the usual placebo control, do
alter rectal epithelial proliferative kinetics in healthy subjects202 and
when infused twice daily into the distal colon of rats treated with
azoxymethane, reduced the development of aberrant crypts compared
with no-infusion controls.112 Furthermore, variation in concentration
and frequency of the enemas provided in these studies have likely
contributed to mixed results seen. For example, butyrate infusion into
the distal colon of rats had no specific effect over saline infusions on
aberrant crypt formation when given twice a day, but have a signifi-
cant effect when delivered five times per day.112 Hence, positive bio-
logical effects of saline (control) enemas reduce the power of
detecting specific effects and twice-daily use may well be insufficient
as a therapy. In other words, clinical efficacy of enemas are likely to be
impractical to achieve as an extended period of contact between SCFA
and mucosa may be required for therapeutic effects. This has damp-
ened enthusiasm for the enema approach, despite recent studies high-
lighting that they may reduce inflammation by inducing changes to
expression of mucosal genes involved in cytokine expression and
metabolism of reactive oxidative species.203,204
Slow-release preparation of oral butyrate, utilising pH-dependent
release mechanisms, is an alternative approach to colonic enema that
had benefits in patients with diverticulosis and Crohn’s disease in
pilot studies.205,206 However, this approach has not been further
developed and requires testing in larger placebo-controlled RCTs.
Food containing SCFA is another potential way of delivering
SCFA to the systemic circulation. SCFA ingested orally in solution
are rapidly absorbed into the circulation and have been reported to
cause a transient increase in blood acetate levels.211 Furthermore,
they are likely to be adsorbed by epithelial surfaces in the oesopha-
gus, stomach and intestine. Consumption of vinegars, which are nat-
urally high in acetic acid, is anecdotally believed to promote health
benefits.212 In small human studies, vinegar consumption reduces
post-prandial insulin and glucose fluctuations in healthy and insulin
resistant subjects.213,214 Long-term consumption of fermented foods
such as yoghurt has been associated with a reduction in symptoms
of allergy.215,216 Indeed, murine splenocytes incubated with Lacto-
bacilli from traditional Korean kimchi decreased production of IL-4, a
mediator of Th2 hypersensitivity reactions, highlighting a potential
immunomodulatory mechanism.217 Given that these foods are likely
to contain SCFA, further studies are warranted to elucidate a possi-
ble role for “postbiotic” SCFA in this mechanism.

Promotion of endogenous SCFA
Utilising endogenous metabolic processes that produce SCFA to attain
health benefits is an intriguing possibility. Low-level alcohol consump-
tion, that creates a transient increase in plasma acetate levels, is asso-
ciated with a lower risk of heart disease and diabetes.218 Pownall et al
proposed that protective effects of alcohol may be mediated by acet-
ate acting via GPR43 on adipocytes, inhibiting lipolysis and decreasing
plasma triglyceride levels.219 Long-term fasting that promotes ketoge-
nesis and increases circulating SCFA is associated with reduced

to that of butyrate and inhibits NLP3-inflammasome mediated inflam-

whether increasing endogenous SCFA is causally associated with
reducing disease before utilising such a strategy.

CONCLUSIONS
A wide range of pre-clinical evidence supports a role for SCFA as
a modulator of colonic and overall health. However, fundamental
differences between animal and human physiology dictate caution
in extrapolating animal effects to human diseases and create a
need to conduct clinical trials to validate these effects in humans.
A major issue relates to differences in the dose of SCFA that can
be delivered to the target, whether it be, for example, the distal
colon
or
systemic
circulation.
Additional
factors
might
include
inter-individual variability in microbiota and metabolism. Major limi-
tations in progress have included inability to measure SCFA pro-
duction in vivo other than in peripheral sites of faeces or blood.
However, emerging technologies may provide insight into this
dynamic
process.
Furthermore,
development
of
novel
targeted
approaches for colonic SCFA delivery represents a desirable strat-
egy that might achieve more consistent and reliable dosing. These
may also be combined with dietary supplementation of SCFA to
maximise delivery. With these emerging technologies at hand, this
gives enormous potential for SCFA to finally be translated thera-
peutically in a wide range of intestinal, metabolic and inflammatory
diseases.
