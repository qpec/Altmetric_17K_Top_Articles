T
he implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) improves 
survival in populations at high risk for sudden death.1–3 
While potentially life-saving, ICD shocks, both appropriate 
and inappropriate, can also increase long-term morbidity and 
mortality.4,5 Trials of device programming to reduce shocks 
have been shown to improve survival.6,7
See Editorial by Borne and Peterson
However, there is limited information on healthcare utili-
zation (HCU) associated with ICD shocks and whether inap-
propriate and appropriate shocks have differences in type, 
intensity, or cost of care. Moreover, detailed knowledge of 
utilization following an appropriate versus inappropriate 
shock may elucidate downstream patterns of care and poten-
tial mediators of the differences in patient survival following 
shocks. We therefore evaluated HCU and expenditures after 
inappropriate and appropriate shock events by linking ICD 
remote monitoring data to healthcare administrative data.
Methods
Study Design and Data Sources
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with ICDs from 
national (United States) implant registration and remote monitoring 
data linked to healthcare claims. Cohort structure and patient selec-
tion are detailed in Figure 1. Data, stripped of personal identifiers of 
name, date of birth, medical record number, and social security, were 
first obtained from the Medtronic Data Warehousing and Analytics 
Service (DWAS; Medtronic plc, Mounds View, MN). DWAS is a de-
vice implant record data set containing patient demographics (age, 
sex, 3-digit zip codes for patient location, and implant site location), 
implant date, device information (device type, model, and leads), 
Background—In patients with implantable cardioverter–defibrillators, healthcare utilization (HCU) and expenditures 
related to shocks have not been quantified.
Methods and Results—We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with implantable cardioverter–defibrillators 
identified from commercial and Medicare supplemental claims databases linked to adjudicated shock events from remote 
monitoring data. A shock event was defined as ≥1 spontaneous shocks delivered by an implanted device. Shock-related 
HCU was ascertained from inpatient and outpatient claims within 7 days following a shock event. Shock events were 
adjudicated and classified as inappropriate or appropriate, and HCU and expenditures, stratified by shock type, were 
quantified. Of 10 266 linked patients, 963 (9.4%) patients (61.3±13.6 years; 81% male) had 1885 shock events (56% 
appropriate, 38% inappropriate, and 6% indeterminate). Of these events, 867 (46%) had shock-related HCU (14% inpatient 
and 32% outpatient). After shocks, inpatient cardiovascular procedures were common, including echocardiography 
(59%), electrophysiology study or ablation (34%), stress testing (16%), and lead revision (11%). Cardiac catheterization 
was common (71% and 51%), but percutaneous coronary intervention was low (6.5% and 5.0%) after appropriate and 
inappropriate shocks. Expenditures related to appropriate and inappropriate shocks were not significantly different.
Conclusions—After implantable cardioverter–defibrillator shock, related HCU was common, with 1 in 3 shock events 
followed by outpatient HCU and 1 in 7 followed by hospitalization. Use of invasive cardiovascular procedures was 
substantial, even after inappropriate shocks, which comprised 38% of all shocks. Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator 
shocks seem to trigger a cascade of health care. Strategies to reduce shocks could result in cost savings.  (Circ Cardiovasc

and records from remote monitoring transmissions, including pro-
grammed device settings, arrhythmia detection and classification, 
electrocardiograms for episodes detected as ventricular tachycardia/
ventricular fibrillation, and delivered therapies.
We identified patients in DWAS with ICDs and cardiac resyn-
chronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices implanted be-
tween January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. To minimize survival 
and other biases that could be associated with generator replacement 
or lead or device upgrades (eg, ICD to CRT-D), the cohort was re-
stricted to patients receiving de novo devices.
Next, patients with ICD and CRT-D implants were identified in 
the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters 
Database and MarketScan Medicare Supplemental and Coordination 
of Benefits Database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI). 
These data sources contain nationally representative, deidentified 
medical, and pharmacy claims data on the inpatient, outpatient, and 
prescription drug experience of over 45 million enrolled employees, 
dependents, and retirees annually who are covered under a variety 
of fee-for-service and managed care health plans.8 Patients in the 
MarketScan database were identified based on the presence of proce-
dure codes for ICD or CRT-D implant (International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes 
37.94 and 00.51 or Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 
33249 and 33225) between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. 
Follow-up data for these patients were available through December 
31, 2011.
Linking Patient Data
A deterministic matching algorithm was used to link patients who had 
data in both DWAS and MarketScan. The linked patients therefore 
represent individuals who have a device manufactured by Medtronic 
and who have commercial or Medicare supplemental insurance cov-
erage through a health plan that contributes to the MarketScan data-
bases. We followed a strict matching algorithm on 6 of 6 criteria with 
1-to-1 matching: implant date, device type (ICD or CRT-D), patient 
sex, patient age, patient location (3-digit zip code), and implant pro-
cedure location (3-digit zip code). All variables used in the linkage 
were HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996) compliant. In other words, no identifiable protected health 
information (PHI) was used in the linkage. Patients who matched 
to multiple devices or devices matching to multiple patients were 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Randomized trials have shown that the ICD can 
improve survival, but ICD shocks are also associated 
with increased morbidity and mortality.
• The HCU and expenditures following ICD shocks 
have not been quantified.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• In patients with ICDs, 46% of shock events had 
shock-related HCU.
• After shocks, inpatient cardiovascular procedures 
were common, and expenditures were not sig-
nificantly different following inappropriate versus 
appropriate shocks.
• ICD shocks seem to trigger a cascade of health care, 
and strategies to reduce shocks could result in cost 
savings.

excluded. This technique is similar to previous studies linking pa-
tients from registry data sets to insurance claims.9,10 For comorbidity 
ascertainment, we further required continuous medical and drug ben-
efit coverage for the 3-month period before the implant date.
From this matched data set, patients with evidence of at least 1 
shock event were identified from DWAS data. Shock events were de-
fined as 24-hour periods in which ≥1 shocks were delivered by the 
implanted device. Patients with shock events occurring during a con-
comitant inpatient stay, defined as a shock event occurring ≥1 days 
after the admission date but on or before the discharge date, were 
excluded. We also excluded nonspontaneous shocks such as for defi-
brillation threshold testing. Baseline characteristics were ascertained 
for each patient from claims within 3 months before the implant date 
via outpatient and inpatient diagnosis codes (Appendix Table I in the 
Data Supplement).
Shock Event Adjudication
All shock episodes electrograms were adjudicated to determine 
whether they were appropriate or not. Appropriate shocks were de-
fined as those delivered for true ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ven-
tricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation), and inappropriate shocks 
were defined as those delivered for any other type of detected rhythm 
(atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, T-wave oversensing, 
or noise). We used a sequential method of adjudication. First, for all 
shocks, we used a proprietary Medtronic electrogram classification 
algorithm that was developed against physician adjudication from 
1255 shocks in 346 patients in the OMNI observational registry.11 
In validation, the algorithm resulted in a 2% relative increase in in-
appropriate shock classification compared with physician adjudica-
tion (Patel et al, unpublished data [poster presented at Heart Rhythm 
Society Scientific Sessions], 2011). Seventy percent of shock epi-
sodes were classified by the proprietary episode classification algo-
rithm, and the remaining 30% were manually reviewed by at least 2 
Medtronic technical experts (scientists and engineers). In the event 
the manual review by the technical experts resulted in disagreement, 
one author (S.Z.), a board certified and practicing clinical cardiac 
electrophysiologist, performed the final adjudication. Shock episodes 
with insufficient electrocardiogram (ECG) data for adjudication or 
for which technical experts could not agree were considered inde-
terminate. Physician adjudication was performed for 6% of all shock 
episodes and 19% of manual reviewed episodes.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were shock-related HCU and expenditures. 
Shock-related diagnoses were defined as ICD-9-CM codes for car-
diac dysrhythmia, syncope, dizziness, palpitations, tachycardia, or 
mechanical complication of cardiac device, based on a prespecified 
analysis plan by the investigators (Appendix Table II in the Data 
Supplement). The rationale was to conservatively only consider hos-
pitalizations that would likely be directly and proximately related to 
arrhythmia triggering the shock or to the shock itself, rather than any 
number of cardiac or noncardiac causes that might or might not have 
been potentially related to a shock. For example, we did not include 
heart failure or myocardial infarction diagnoses in our shock-related 
definition. Because the majority of patients with ICDs have reduced 
systolic function, it would not be possible to know whether a hospi-
talization coded with a diagnosis of heart failure was necessarily a 
result of the shock, or if it was coded because no other reasons for the 
shock were documented. Therefore, inclusion of heart failure could 
overestimate the attribution of post shock care to being shock related.
Shock-related HCU was defined via shock-related diagnoses re-
ported as the primary diagnosis of any inpatient hospitalization or 
shock-related diagnoses reported as any diagnosis for outpatient 
service(s) that occurred during the postshock period, defined as the 
shorter of the 7-day period following the date of shock or the time to a 
subsequent shock. We selected a 7-day window based on clinical face 
validity. Because we used shock data extracted from remote monitor-
ing records, it is possible for there to have been a delay in patients 
seeking HCU after receiving a shock because of delays across the care 
pathway from remote data transmission to clinician interpretation and 
recommendation of seeking medical care. Outpatient services includ-
ed office visits, emergency room care, and emergency medical trans-
port that did not result in a subsequent inpatient stay. Inpatient and 
outpatient procedures were ascertained using ICD-9-CM and CPT 
codes (Appendix Table III in the Data Supplement).
Healthcare expenditures for shock-related HCU were based on 
adjudicated claims from the postshock period, including insurer and 
health plan payments and patient cost sharing in the form of copay-
ment, deductible, and coinsurance. Expenditures for services provid-
ed under capitated arrangements were estimated by using payment 
proxies that were computed from paid claims at the procedure level 
within the MarketScan databases.8 Healthcare expenditures were in-
flated to 2011 dollars based on the Medical Care Consumer Price 
Index. For this analysis, the unit of analysis was the shock event (de-
fined as a day [24 hours] with ≥1 shocks), and an individual patient 
could contribute multiple events. All reimbursement claims are fully 
adjudicated in the cost data set. Therefore, we included encounters 
with $0 claims because they do not represent missing data but rath-
er claims of a covered visit with no actual associated expenditures. 
Outliers were not discarded for the same reason.
Statistical Analysis
Shock-related expenditures among those with shock-related HCU are 
reported, and t tests were used to compare hospital length of stay and 
expenditures between appropriate and inappropriate shock events. 
Predictors of expenditures were determined using a multivariable gen-
eralized linear model on the log expenditure scale with generalized 
estimating equations to account for multiple shocks per individual. 
This allowed estimation of a cost ratio for each covariate in the model 
which included patient characteristics at baseline (including age, sex, 
primary insurer, health plan type, comorbidities, and medication use), 
device type, the number of days from the ICD implant to the shock 
event, the number of shocks in the shock event, patient preshock ex-
penditures (both cardiac and noncardiac), and for those with multiple 
shocks, the shock event number and the proportion of previous shocks 
for which the patient sought treatment. These covariates were included 
because they were either statistically significant in univariate models 
or they were deemed clinically significant for inclusion by the study 
team. Preshock expenditures were included in the model because past 
HCU sought by a patient can predict future HCU and expenditures. 
To be as conservative as possible, we included both preshock cardiac 
and noncardiac expenditures to try and attribute, as closely as pos-
sible, current expenditures with the shock-related HCU, as opposed to 
the patient being a high utilizer in general. EXP(β) was used to con-
vert the regression coefficients into the ratios of the geometric means. 
Analyses were conducted using SAS (Cary, NC). Physician investiga-
tors did not directly perform the analysis and could not retain access 
to the linked data set. M.P.T. worked directly with the data analysts 
and reviewed the raw data output of all models and statistical code. 
The study was a retrospective analysis of data recorded in such a man-
ner that the subjects cannot be identified, and thus the research was 
exempt from institutional review board (IRB) review under 45 CFR 
46.101(b)(4).
Results
Patient Characteristics
Of 186 394 patients in the DWAS data set, 10 266 patients were 
successfully linked to patients in the MarketScan databases 
(Figure 1). Among these, there were 1529 (14.9%) with at least 
1 shock event. After excluding patients without continuous pre-
implant enrollment (n=532) and those with shock events dur-
ing a hospitalization stay (n=34), there were 963 linked patients 
with 1885 shock events. Baseline characteristics are shown in 
Table 1. Patients with shock events (aged 61.3±13.7 years) were 
predominantly male (81%), and 41% had Medicare supplemen-
tal coverage. There were high rates of preimplant ischemic heart 
disease or previous myocardial infarction (60%), ventricular

arrhythmias (41%), and atrial arrhythmias (37%). In this cohort, 
23% had single chamber, 49% had dual chamber, and 28% 
had cardiac resynchronization ICDs. Most patients had only 
appropriate shocks (43%) or only inappropriate shocks (42%), 
whereas 12% had both types.
Shock-Related HCU
Of the 1885 shock events, 259 (13.7%) were followed by 
inpatient HCU, and 608 (32.2%) were followed by outpatient 
HCU only, whereas 1018 (54.0%) had no shock-related HCU. 
Figure 2 shows the distribution of shock-related HCU (inpa-
tient, outpatient, and none) stratified by shock type (appro-
priate, inappropriate, and indeterminate). These distributions 
were similar across shock types.
The most frequently reported procedures (primary or sec-
ondary procedures) during shock-related inpatient HCU were 
ECG (85.3%), chest x-ray (75.7%), cardiac catheterization 
(75.7%), echocardiogram (58.7%), and electrophysiology 
study/ablation (33.6%; Table 2). Compared with appropri-
ate shock events, utilization of cardiovascular procedures 
after inappropriate shock events was generally reduced, but 
still substantial, and included catheterization (51.3% versus 
79.4%), echocardiography (51.3% versus 60.6%). However, 
lead or device revision (28.8% versus 5.2%) was more com-
mon after inappropriate shock events. Despite substantial 
use of catheterization in both groups, percutaneous coronary 
intervention was performed in only 6.5% of appropriate shock 
events and 5.0% of inappropriate shock events. The most fre-
quently reported primary procedures after all shock events 
with related inpatient HCU were cardiac catheterization 
(12.7% after any shock events and 12.9% after appropriate 
shock events) and lead or device revision (11.3% after inap-
propriate shock events).
Length of stay was slightly longer following appropriate 
than inappropriate shock events, 3.6±3.2 days versus 2.8±2.2 
days (P=0.02; Table 3). Inpatient HCU was most commonly 
associated with Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Groups 
(MS-DRG) related to cardiac arrhythmias or conduction dis-
orders or to circulatory disorders with cardiac catheterization 
(excluding acute myocardial infarction [MI]), with and with-
out complicating comorbidities (Appendix Table IV in the 
Data Supplement).
In the outpatient setting, the most common procedures 
included device interrogations (76.1%), ECG (73.4%), 
and chest x-ray (40.7%). About 61.4% of outpatient shock-
related HCU included ambulance transportation, and 45.6% 
included an emergency room visit. Among outpatient-only

shock-related HCU, 56.9% of visits were due to appropri-
ate shock events, and procedures were similar between shock 
types (Table 4).
Expenditures for Shock-Related HCU
Table 5 shows aggregate expenditure data stratified by inpatient 
versus outpatient-only and by shock type. Across all shock 
events, mean and median expenditures were $5887±$19 836 
and $901±$6106, respectively. The mean and median expen-
ditures for HCU following appropriate shock events were 
$5592±$13 831 and $940±$6021, respectively, whereas for 
inappropriate shock events, they were similar at $4470±$5283 
and $681±$5283 (P=0.11). Across all shock events, expendi-
tures for patients with inpatient HCU were substantially higher 
than for patients with only outpatient HCU (inpatient: mean 
$15 756±$33 178, median $8561±$8648 versus outpatient: 
mean $1300±$4706, median $304±$1010). Expenditures 
were similar for inappropriate compared with appropriate 
shocks in the inpatient and outpatient settings (Table 5).
In the multivariable analysis of patients with inpatient and 
outpatient shock-related HCU, the number of shocks during 
the event was associated with higher expenditures (inpatient 
ratio, 1.018; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.008–1.028; and 
outpatient ratio, 1.037; 95% CI, 1.003–1.072; Table 6). There 
was no significant association of device type (inpatient CRT-D

related expenditures. All covariates are detailed in Table 6.
Discussion
Using novel matching of ICD registration and remote monitor-
ing data to healthcare claims, we found that almost one half of 
the shock events were associated with HCU, and 1 in 7 shock 
events was followed by inpatient HCU. Use of cardiovascular 
procedures, including cardiac catheterization, echocardiogra-
phy, electrophysiology study or ablation, and lead or device 
revision, was common, even following inappropriate shock 
events. Expenditures were similar for appropriate and inap-
propriate shock events. These data indicate: (1) substantial 
HCU is triggered by a device shock, regardless of the underly-
ing cause of shock and (2) substantial utilization of cardiovas-
cular procedures that may not improve outcomes, such as the 
high observed rate of cardiac catheterization but relatively low 
observed rate of percutaneous coronary intervention.
The findings from this study have several implications. 
From a methodology standpoint, we demonstrate that link-
ing across multiple deidentified data sets is feasible and can 
enable health services and outcomes research that otherwise 
would not be possible. To our knowledge, this is the first 
published study to link HCU and expenditure data with indi-
vidual arrhythmia event data collected via remote monitor-
ing. Although there is an increasing interest to link big data 
across a variety of sources,12 the balance between data access 
and privacy remains an active area of discussion and policy 
development.13 Although all of our data sources were stripped 
of protected identifiers before data manipulation or linkage, 
our analysis demonstrates that one could effectively reiden-
tify data through linkage, even if protected identifiers were not 
used in the linkage process. Therefore, protection of human 
subjects and their data remains paramount.
This study also shows that both appropriate and inap-
propriate shocks initiate a cascade of HCU that frequently 
includes invasive procedures, many with uncertain effects 
on patient outcomes. Two recent trials have demonstrated 
that an ICD programming strategy of high-rate cutoff with 
extended detection can improve survival,6 reduce inappropri-
ate therapies,6,14 and reduce the risk of hospitalization.14 In 
this study, it was found that cardiac catheterization was per-
formed in 75% of all shock-related hospitalizations (includ-
ing 51% after inappropriate shock event hospitalizations), yet 
percutaneous coronary intervention was uncommon (6.6% in 
all and 5.1% in inappropriate shock event hospitalizations). 
Electrophysiology studies and cardiac ablation were also 
common. These invasive procedures, along with the associ-
ated risks of significant near-term and long-term complica-
tions, could have untoward effects on survival in patients who 
experience a shock event. As a result, it could be the HCU 
following a shock event, rather than the shock event itself, that 
has the greatest impact on survival. Further study is needed to 
better understand the role of healthcare interventions (includ-
ing changes to drug therapy) in mediating survival rates,

high-rate, extended detection strategy or use improved algo-
rithms to reduce ICD shocks.
Lead or device revision procedures were performed in 
29% of inappropriate shock-related hospitalizations. This 
suggests a potentially high proportion of lead sequelae or 
complications (such as lead fracture) as a cause of inap-
propriate shock. It is of note that this analysis included data 
from 2008 to 2010, which was after the recall of the Sprint 
Fidelis defibrillation lead (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, 
MN) that had been shown to be related to a higher likelihood 
of lead fracture.

Finally, the quantification of HCU and expenditures dem-
onstrates alignment of cost reduction with the clinical ben-
efits for reducing shocks. In our analysis, 9.4% of patients 
experienced ≥1 shock events, which is similar to a previously 
reported 1-year shock incidence rate in a primary prevention 
cohort.15 Although there was wide variation in expenditures, 
there were relatively small absolute differences in median 
expenditures between appropriate and inappropriate shock 
events. Recent evidence suggests that strategic programming 
of devices can reduce the 1-year incidence of all-cause shocks 
to <10%,14 and arrhythmia discrimination algorithms in mod-
ern ICDs further minimize the risk of inappropriate shocks.12 
In context, our findings underscore the opportunity to improve 
both the clinical care and the economic burden associated 
with shocks through the implementation of shock reduction 
strategies.
Our study has several limitations associated with the 
use of retrospective anonymized data. First, results may 
be affected by confounding factors that are not readily 
available from the data sources used, such as health status 
beyond what can be represented by diagnoses of comor-
bid conditions, including ejection fraction and New York 
Heart Failure classification, patient behaviors and lifestyle, 
additional medical or pharmaceutical interventions, or the 
indication for the ICD (eg, primary versus secondary pre-
vention). Second, the population included in this study may 
not be a representative of all patients, such as those who 
are uninsured, have ICDs from a different manufacturer, or 
do not use remote monitoring (which was required in our 
analysis to ascertain shock events). Because remote moni-
toring itself has been associated with decreased HCU, our 
study may underestimate utilization and costs.16,17 Third, our 
data come from linked remote monitoring data from devices 
of a single vendor (Medtronic) linked to commercial claims 
(rather than Medicare), and our cohort seems to be slightly 
younger than observational studies from the ICD Registry.18 
Fourth, HCU was defined as shock related only if the pri-
mary diagnosis was related to arrhythmias, ICD complica-
tions, or relevant symptoms within the prespecified 7-day 
window. As our goal was to conservatively consider HCU 
that have a high likelihood of being arrhythmia or device 
related, we did not consider HCU for other causes, such as 
heart failure or myocardial infarction, if these primary ICD-
9-CM codes were not part of the encounter. As a result, this 
could underestimate HCU and expenditures, especially if 
HCU occurred after the 7-day window. For example, inclu-
sion of heart failure HCU in the absence of the prespecified 
shock-related diagnoses would have added 8% to 9% more 
HCU episodes. Because of the potential for over attribution 
of heart failure to the shock-related event, we chose to be 
more conservative with our estimates of shock-related care. 
However, once care was identified as shock related, then 
all expenditures for that HCU were included. These may 
include costs associated with conditions discovered during 
the visits which were not specifically shock related. The 
cumulative costing could therefore potentially overestimate 
the attributable risk of shock reduction on overall healthcare 
expenditures.
Conclusions
In patients with Medtronic ICDs and remote monitoring that 
were linked to commercial claims data, we found 14.9% of 
patients experienced at least 1 shock event, and 46% were 
associated with any HCU and 14% with inpatient care. HCU 
and expenditures, including use of invasive cardiovascular 
procedures, were substantial, even after inappropriate shock 
events. Strategies to reduce the incidence of ICD shocks may 
result in significant reductions in HCU and expenditures. Fur-
ther investigation is warranted to determine the impact on sur-
vival of these procedures after appropriate and inappropriate 
shocks.
