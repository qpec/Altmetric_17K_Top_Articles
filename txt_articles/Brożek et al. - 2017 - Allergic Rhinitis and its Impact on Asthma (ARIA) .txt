 Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) affects 10% to 40% of the
population. It reduces quality of life and school and work
performance and is a frequent reason for office visits in general
practice. Medical costs are large, but avoidable costs associated
with lost work productivity are even larger than those incurred
by asthma. New evidence has accumulated since the last revision
of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)
guidelines in 2010, prompting its update.
Objective: We sought to provide a targeted update of the ARIA
guidelines.

 Methods: The ARIA guideline panel identified new clinical
questions and selected questions requiring an update. We
performed systematic reviews of health effects and the evidence
about patients’ values and preferences and resource
requirements (up to June 2016). We followed the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) evidence-to-decision frameworks to develop
recommendations.
Results: The 2016 revision of the ARIA guidelines provides both
updated and new recommendations about the pharmacologic
treatment of AR. Specifically, it addresses the relative merits of
using oral H1-antihistamines, intranasal H1-antihistamines,
intranasal corticosteroids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists
either alone or in combination. The ARIA guideline panel
provides specific recommendations for the choice of treatment
and the rationale for the choice and discusses specific
considerations that clinicians and patients might want to review
to choose the management most appropriate for an individual
patient.
Conclusions: Appropriate treatment of AR might improve
patients’ quality of life and school and work productivity. ARIA
recommendations support patients, their caregivers, and health
care providers in choosing the optimal treatment. (J Allergy
Clin Immunol 2017;140:950-8.)
Key words: Allergic rhinitis, practice guideline
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is among the most common diseases
globally and usually persists throughout life.1 The prevalence of
self-reported AR has been estimated to be approximately 2% to
25% in children2 and 1% to greater than 40% in adults.1,3 The
prevalence of confirmed AR in adults in Europe ranged from
17% to 28.5%. Recent studies show that the prevalence of AR
has increased in particular in countries with initial low prevalence
(for a discussion of prevalence of AR, see section 5.1-5.2 in
Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma [ARIA] 2008 Up-
date1). Classical symptoms of AR are nasal itching, sneezing, rhi-
norrhea, and nasal congestion. Ocular symptoms are also
frequent; allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is associated with itching
and redness of the eyes and tearing. Other symptoms include itch-
ing of the palate, postnasal drip, and cough.
AR is also frequently associated with asthma, which is found in
15% to 38% of patients with AR,4,5 and nasal symptoms are pre-
sent in 6% to 85% patients with asthma.6-9 In addition, AR is a
risk factor for asthma,4,9 and uncontrolled moderate-to-severe
AR affects asthma control.10,11
Compared with other medical conditions, AR might not appear
to be serious because it is not associated with severe morbidity
and mortality. However, the burden and costs are substantial.12
AR reduces the quality of life of many patients, impairing sleep
quality and cognitive function and causing irritability and fatigue.
AR is associated with decreased school and work performance,
especially during the peak pollen season.1 AR is a frequent reason
for general practice office visits. Annual direct medical costs of
AR are substantial, but indirect costs associated with lost work
productivity are greater than those incurred by asthma.13-15
Appropriate treatment of AR improves symptoms, quality of
life, and work and school performance.
Clinical practice guidelines for AR management were devel-
oped over the past 20 years16 and have improved the care of
patients with AR.17 However, transparent reporting of guidelines
to facilitate understanding and acceptance are needed. The ARIA
initiative was initiated during a World Health Organization work-
shop in 199918 and updated in 2008.1 The ARIA 2010 revision
was the first evidence-based guideline in allergy to follow the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and
Evaluation (GRADE) approach19 with no influence of for-profit
organizations and an explicit declaration and management of po-
tential competing interests of panel members.20 It summarized the
potential benefits and harms underlying the recommendations, as
well as assumptions around values and preferences that influ-
enced the strength and direction of the recommendations. In
2014, the ARIA revision was found to rank first in the rigor of
development and quality of reporting of guidelines about the
management of AR,16 although recent guidelines published later
were not considered.21
CLINICAL QUESTIONS
Since the last revision of the ARIA guidelines in 2010,20 new
treatments have become available, and new evidence has accumu-
lated about selected other treatments. By using a modified Delphi
process, the ARIA guideline panel selected new questions that
required answering with recommendations or the existing recom-
mendations that required an updated review of the evidence and
potentially updating the recommendations themselves. Therefore
this revision of the ARIA guidelines is limited in scope and ad-
dresses 6 questions about the treatment of AR:
1. Should a combination of oral H1-antihistamine and intra-
nasal corticosteroid versus intranasal corticosteroid alone
be used for treatment of AR?
2. Should a combination of intranasal H1-antihistamine and
intranasal corticosteroid versus intranasal corticosteroid
alone be used for treatment of AR?
3. Should a combination of an intranasal H1-antihistamine
and an intranasal corticosteroid versus intranasal H1-anti-
histamine alone be used for treatment of AR?
4. Should a leukotriene receptor antagonist versus an oral H1-
antihistamine be used for treatment of AR?
5. Should an intranasal H1-antihistamine versus an intranasal
corticosteroid be used for treatment of AR?
6. Should an intranasal H1-antihistamine versus an oral H1-
antihistamine be used for treatment of AR?
The target audience of these guidelines is primary care
clinicians, school nurses, pharmacists, specialists in allergy and
clinical immunology, general internists managing patients with
AR, and pediatricians. Ear-nose-throat specialists, other health

 care professionals, and health care policy makers can also benefit
from these guidelines.
CLASSIFICATION OF AR
The classification of AR was revised by ARIA in 2001. A major
change was the introduction of the terms ‘‘intermittent’’ and
‘‘persistent.’’18 Before then, AR was classified, based on the time
and type of exposure and symptoms, into seasonal allergic rhinitis
(SAR; most often caused by outdoor allergens, such as pollens or
molds), perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR; most frequently,
although not necessarily, caused by indoor allergens such as
house dust mites, molds, cockroaches, and animal dander), and
occupational allergic rhinitis.22,23 With very few exceptions, pub-
lished studies refer to SAR and PAR and enroll patients based on
the offending allergen (pollen, house dust mites, or both), and we
retained the terms SAR and PAR to enable the interpretation of
published evidence.
The recommendations in the ARIA 2016 update apply directly
to patients with moderate-to-severe AR. They might be less
applicable to treatment of patients with mild AR who frequently
do not seek medical help and manage their symptoms themselves
with medications available other the counter.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHILDREN
Almost all studies used to answer the questions in this update of
the ARIA guidelines included exclusively adult patients. How-
ever, careful extrapolation to the pediatric population can be
attempted. One can assume that the relative effects of treatment of
AR are likely similar among adults and children, but adverse
effects might be more or less frequent, and their perception and
importance might be different (eg, bitter taste). Values and
preferences for specific outcomes and treatments can also vary
between adults and children.
METHODOLOGY
The full description of methods used to develop recommenda-
tions in these guidelines is described in the Methods section of the
full version of the guideline document (see Online Repository
item E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org). Here we describe briefly the methodology to facilitate the
interpretation of the guidelines.
Questions and outcomes of interest
The scope and questions for this update of the ARIA guidelines
were identified by the ARIA guideline panel members. The
guideline panel deemed the following outcomes to be important
to patients: nasal and ocular symptoms, quality of life, work/
school performance, and adverse effects. As for the previous
revision of the ARIA guidelines, we did not formally assess the
relative importance of each outcome of interest (ie, which
outcomes are more and which are less important) but rather
adopted the rating agreed upon by the guideline panel according
to the structured discussion.24 In general, combined nasal symp-
toms, ocular symptoms, quality of life, work/school performance,
and serious adverse effects were considered critical to the deci-
sion, and individual symptoms, a composite outcome of any
adverse effects and adverse effects that were not serious or did
not lead to discontinuation of treatment, were considered impor-
tant but not critical (see evidence profiles in Online Repository
item E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org).
Evidence review and development of clinical
recommendations
For each question, the methodology group performed a full
systematic review of the literature to identify and summarize
evidence about the effects of interventions on the outcomes of
interest. We also searched systematically for information about
patients’ values and preferences and resource use (cost). We
systematically searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane
CENTRAL electronic databases. Titles and abstracts and subse-
quently full-text articles were screened in duplicate to assess
eligibility according to prespecified criteria. Panel members were
contacted to confirm completeness of the body of evidence and
suggest additional articles that might have been missed in
electronic searches.
To obtain the estimates of effects on each outcome of interest,
we performed meta-analyses using the Cochrane Collaboration
Review Manager Software, version 5.3.5.25 We prepared evi-
dence summaries (see Online Repository item E2) for each ques-
tion according to the GRADE approach19 by using the
GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool online application
(www.gradepro.org).
When continuous outcomes (eg, symptom scores or quality of
life) are measured by using different scales, the results can only be
combined in meta-analysis by using the standardized mean
difference (SMD), which is expressed in SD units.26 Results ex-
pressed as an SMD are challenging to interpret. To facilitate un-
derstanding, we used interpretation of the effect size according
to Cohen conventional criteria27: an SMD of around 0.2 is consid-
ered a small effect, an SMD of around 0.5 is considered a moder-
ate effect, and an SMD of around 0.8 or higher is considered a
large effect. We used this interpretation throughout this document
when we referred to effects of interventions as small, moderate, or
large.
We assessed the risk of bias at the outcome level by using the
Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool.28 Subsequently, we as-
sessed the certainty of the body of evidence (ie, confidence in the
estimated effects, which is also known as ‘‘quality of the evi-
dence’’) for each of the outcomes of interest according to the
GRADE approach29 based on the following criteria: risk of
bias, precision, consistency and magnitude of the estimates of ef-
fects, directness of the evidence, risk of publication bias, presence
of a dose-effect relationship, and assessment of the effect of resid-
ual opposing confounding. Certainty of the evidence was catego-
rized into 4 levels: high, moderate, low, and very low.
For each question, we summarized all information in evidence-
to-decision (EtD) frameworks (see Online Repository item E2)
that included concise description of desirable and undesirable
health effects, certainty of the evidence about those effects, evi-
dence and assumptions about patients’ values and preferences,
required resources and cost-effectiveness, potential influence on
health equity, acceptability of the intervention to various stake-

 EtDs for all questions were reviewed by the ARIA guideline
panel members, who provided feedback by means of electronic
communication and during a face-to-face meeting of Integrated
Care Pathways for Airway Diseases (AIRWAYS ICPs)31,32 and
Frailty European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy
Ageing Reference Sites in Lisbon, Portugal on July 1, 2015.33
All comments were addressed, and the frameworks were modi-
fied accordingly. Modified EtD frameworks that included judg-
ments about the research evidence, additional considerations of
ARIA panel members, and draft recommendations were sent to
all ARIA panel members for review and approval or disapproval
and comments by using the online SurveyMonkey software
(www.surveymonkey.com). We recorded and addressed all
agreements/disagreements,
comments,
and
suggestions
for
changes. We present the final EtD frameworks in Online
Repository item E2.
Recommendations
and
their
strength
were
decided
by
consensus. The ARIA guideline panel agreed on the final wording
of recommendations and remarks with further qualifications for
each recommendation. The final document, including the recom-
mendations, was reviewed and approved by all members of the
guideline panel.
According to the GRADE approach, the recommendations can
be either ‘‘strong’’ or ‘‘conditional’’ depending on the guideline
panel’s confidence that following the recommendation would
bring more good than harm to patients. The wording of
recommendations reflects their strength, and one can use the
terms ‘‘we recommend’’ for strong recommendations and ‘‘we
suggest’’ for conditional recommendations. Box 1 provides sug-
gested interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations.
Recommendations
We present all recommendations in Table I. We provide the
rationale for the recommendations and the consideration of all
factors that influenced the recommendations: effects on all
important health outcomes, certainty of the available evidence,
values and preferences, acceptability by stakeholders, require-
ments for resources, feasibility, and any issues of health equity
in the unabridged guideline document in Online Repository
item E1. Detailed summaries of the evidence supporting
each recommendation and the guideline panel judgements are
shown in Online Repository item E2.
How to use these guidelines
The ARIA guidelines about treatment of AR are not intended to
impose a standard of care for individual countries. They provide
the basis for rational informed decisions for patients, parents,
clinicians, and other health care professionals. Clinicians,
patients, third-party payers, institutional review committees,
other stakeholders, or the courts should not view these recom-
mendations as dictates. Recommendations provide guidance for
typical patients; no recommendation can take into account all of
the often-compelling unique individual circumstances. Thus, no
one charged with evaluating health care professionals’ actions
should apply the recommendations from these guidelines by rote
or in a blanket fashion.
Statements regarding the underlying values and preferences, as
well as qualifying remarks accompanying each recommendation,
should never be omitted when quoting or translating recommen-
dations from these guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS
Evidence-based guidelines are at the cornerstone of inte-
grated care pathways (ICPs),31,32 structured multidisciplinary
care plans that promote translation of guideline recommenda-
tions into local protocols and their subsequent application in
clinical practice. Usually, several guidelines are available
providing advice about the management of the same condi-
tion.16 It is important to wisely choose appropriate guidelines
for local adaptation and creation of ICPs because most of
them have limitations because of either the development of
the guideline itself or the available research evidence and its
interpretation. The most common limitations of guidelines in
AR are narrowness in scope (addressing only a small selection
of important questions about the management of a given
condition), suboptimal rigor of development and reporting,
and inadequate representation of the views of patients and their
caregivers.16 We acknowledge that for the ARIA 2016 update,
we have not reviewed all recommendations from the ARIA
2010 guidelines. However, we updated only 3 recommendations
suggested by the ARIA panel members as requiring the
update,
and
we
addressed
3
new
questions.
We
also
acknowledge that the ARIA guideline panel included allergists,
ear-nose-throat
specialists,
pulmonologists,
general
practi-
tioners, and pediatricians but did not include other health care
professionals, pharmacists, and patients themselves. However,
for the ARIA 2016 update, we systematically searched and
reviewed the published evidence about the patients’ values
and preferences regarding the outcomes and treatments for
AR that to certain degree helped to overcome this limitation.
We summarized the results in the section about the assumed
Box 1. Strength of recommendation
Strong recommendation
For patients: Most patients in this situation would want the
recommended course of action, and only a small proportion
would not.
For clinicians: Most patients should receive the intervention.
Adherence to a strong recommendation could be used as a
quality criterion or performance indicator. Formal decision
aids are not likely to be needed to help patients make deci-
sions consistent with their values and preferences.
For health care policy makers: The recommendation can be
adopted as a policy or performance measure in most
situations.
Conditional recommendation
For patients: The majority of patients in this situation would
want the suggested course of action, but many would not.
For clinicians: Recognize that different choices will be appro-
priate for individual patients and that you must help each pa-
tient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or
her values and preferences. Decision aids might be useful in
helping patients to make decisions consistent with their
values and preferences.
For health care policy makers: Policy making will require sub-
stantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.
Documentation of appropriate (eg, shared) decision-making
processes can serve as a performance measure.

 TABLE I. Recommendations
Recommendation
Assumed values and preferences
Explanations and other considerations
Question 1: Should a combination of an oral H1-antihistamine (OAH) and intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) vs INCS alone be used for treatment of AR?
Recommendation 1A: In patients with SAR, we
suggest either a combination of an INCS with
an OAH or an INCS alone (conditional
recommendation | low certainty of evidence).
Recommendation 1B: In patients with PAR, we
suggest an INCS alone rather than a combi-
nation of an INCS with an OAH (conditional
recommendation | very low certainty of
evidence).
ARIA guideline panel acknowledged that the
choice of treatment would depend mostly on
patient preferences and local availability and
cost of treatment. Panel members assumed that
in the majority of situations, potential net
benefit would not justify spending additional
resources.
—
This is a conditional recommendation, and thus
different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. In settings in which the
additional cost of an OAH is not large and/or
patients’ values and preferences differ from
those assumed by guideline panel members, a
combination therapy might be a reasonable
choice, especially in patients whose symptoms
are not well controlled with an INCS alone,
those with pronounced ocular symptoms, or
those commencing treatment because of likely
faster onset of treatment effects.
This recommendation concerns regular use of
newer and less sedative OAHs and INCSs in
patients with SAR. For older OAHs with more
sedative effects, the balance of desirable and
undesirable effects may be different.
Currently available evidence suggests that there is
no additional benefit from a combination
therapy compared with INCS alone, and there
might be additional undesirable effects. This
recommendation is conditional because of
sparse information and thus very low certainty
of the estimated effects.
Question 2: Should a combination of an intranasal H1-antihistamine (INAH) and INCS vs an INCS alone be used for treatment of AR?
Recommendation 2A: In patients with SAR, we
suggest either a combination of an INCS with
an INAH or an INCS alone (conditional
recommendation | moderate certainty of ev-
idence).
Recommendation 2B: In patients with PAR, we
suggest either a combination of an INCS with
an INAH or an INCS alone (conditional
recommendation | very low certainty of
evidence).
The panel members acknowledged that the choice
of treatment will mostly depend on patient
preferences and local availability and cost of
treatment. At initiation of treatment
(approximately the first 2 weeks), a
combination of an INCS with an INAH might
act faster than an INCS alone and thus might be
preferred by some patients.
The panel members acknowledged that the choice
of treatment will mostly depend on patient
preferences and local availability and cost of
treatment.
This is a conditional recommendation, and thus
different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. In settings in which the
additional cost of combination therapy is not
large and/or patients value potential benefits
more than any increased risk of adverse effects,
a combination therapy might be a reasonable
choice.
This is a conditional recommendation because of
the very low certainty of the evidence. At the
initiation of treatment (approximately the first
2 weeks), combination of an INCS with an
INAH might act faster than an INCS alone and
thus might be preferred by some patients.
Question 3: Should a combination of an INAH and INCS vs an INAH alone be used for treatment of AR?
Recommendation 3A: In patients with SAR, we
suggest a combination of an INCS with an
INAH rather than an INAH alone (condi-
tional recommendation | low certainty of
evidence).
This recommendation places higher value on
additional reduction of symptoms and improved
quality of life with a combination therapy
compared with an INAH alone. It places a lower
value on avoiding additional cost (expenditure
of resources).
This is a conditional recommendation, and thus
different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. In settings in which the
additional cost of a combination therapy is
large, an alternative choice (ie, and INAH
alone) might be equally reasonable. One panel
member thought that the recommendation
should be conditional for either the intervention
or comparison.
Question 4: Should a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) vs an OAH be used for treatment of AR?
Recommendation 4A: In patients with SAR, we
suggest either an LTRA or an OAH (condi-
tional recommendation | moderate certainty
of evidence).
Panel members acknowledged that the choice of
an LTRA or OAH will mostly depend on patient
preferences and local availability and cost of
specific medications. In many settings an OAH
might still be more cost-effective, but this will
largely depend on availability of generic LTRAs
and the local cost of various newer-generation
OAHs and LTRAs.
Some patients with AR who have concomitant
asthma, especially exercise-induced and/or
aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, might
benefit from an LTRA more than from an OAH.
However, this recommendation applies to
treatment of AR but not to treatment of asthma.
Patients with asthma who have concomitant AR
should receive an appropriate treatment according
to the guidelines for the treatment of asthma.

 values and preferences in the full text of the ARIA 2016 update
(see Online Repository item E1) and in the relevant sections of
EtD tables (see Online Repository item E2).
The available evidence has important limitations: (1) selective
measurement and reporting of outcomes (eg, few studies properly
measure and report quality of life, which is the most important
outcome in patients with AR), (2) selection of patients for clinical
trials that might not represent appropriately the patients seen in
primary care,34 and (3) not distinguishing between patients with
different age or severity of symptoms (lack of proper stratifica-
tion),35 thus limiting the applicability and generalizability of
the research findings. Given these limitations, clinical practice
guidelines, especially those with international audience, should
emphasize rigorous systematic review of the health effects and
explicit and detailed description of the assumed values and
preferences and considerations of cost, feasibility, acceptability,
and health equity issues because it is currently following the
GRADE EtD frameworks.36-38 Such detailed, explicit, and trans-
parent reporting of guidelines facilitates local adaptation of rec-
ommendations and their translation into ICPs. Systematic and
transparent summaries of the evidence clearly identifying gaps
in available research evidence are needed to direct the research
agenda and to avoid unnecessary expenditure of resources for
further clinical research when it is not necessary.39
Implementation of guidelines in different settings and coun-
tries depends on the availability of health interventions (eg,
medical tests, medications, and equipment), availability of
resources, and cultural differences, among others. Thus local
adaptation of recommendations can be required, and ICPs need to
be developed at the national, regional, or local level. However,

Recommendation
Assumed values and preferences
Explanations and other considerations
Recommendation 4B: In patients with PAR, we
suggest an OAH rather than a LTRA (condi-
tional recommendation | low certainty of
evidence).
This recommendation places a higher value on
possibly larger improvement of symptoms and
quality of life with an OAH compared with an
LTRA. It places a lower value on possible
increased risk of somnolence.
This is a conditional recommendation, and thus
different choices will be appropriate for different
patientsbasedontheirpreferencesfor reduction of
symptoms vs avoiding the risk of adverse effects.
This might be more important for patients with
PAR than those with SAR because they might use
those medications for longer periods of time.
Some patients with AR and concomitant asthma,
especially exercise-induced and/or aspirin-
exacerbated respiratory disease, might benefit
from anLTRA more thanfromanOAH. However,
this recommendation applies to treatment of AR
but not to treatment of asthma. Patients with
asthma who have concomitant AR should receive
an appropriate treatment according to the
guidelines for the treatment of asthma.
Question 5: Should an INAH vs an INCS be used for treatment of AR?
Recommendation 5A: In patients with SAR, we
suggest an INCS rather than an INAH (con-
ditional recommendation | moderate certainty
of evidence).
Recommendation 5B: In patients with PAR, we
suggest an INCS rather than an INAH (con-
ditional recommendation | low certainty of
evidence).
This recommendation places a higher value on
likely small but greater reduction of symptoms
and improvement of quality of life with an
INCS compared with an INAH and a lower
value on avoiding larger cost of treatment with
an INCS in many jurisdictions.
This recommendation places a higher value on
probably greater reduction of nasal symptoms
with an INCS compared with an INAH,
although the overall difference is likely small. It
places a lower value on avoiding larger cost of
treatment with an INCS in many jurisdictions.
This is a conditional recommendation, and thus
different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. Clinicians must help each
patient to arrive at a decision consistent with her
or his values and preferences, considering local
availability and costs.

 they should always be based on systematically reviewed evidence
of desirable and undesirable consequences. The ARIA 2016
revision will be used to develop the ICPs proposed by the
European
Innovation
Partnership
on
Active
and
Healthy
Ageing31,32,40 by using MASK (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel
Network).
ARIA
is
developing
a
novel
implementation
strategy using mobile technology41,42 and a clinical decision
support system41 that is deployed in 21 countries.43 The ARIA
2016 revision will be embedded in the clinical decision support
system for real-time patient stratification by using mobile
technology.
Most of the recommendations are based on low- or very low-
certainty evidence, mainly because of the imprecision of the
estimated effects due to few patients being studied. For those
questions, there is a need for more well-designed and executed
randomized controlled trials that would measure and properly
report all important outcomes.
Clinical implications: The 2016 revision of the ARIA guidelines
offers updated advice for clinicians and patients about the most
commonly used treatments for AR.
