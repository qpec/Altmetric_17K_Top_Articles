he number of adult patients with hypertension was esti-
mated at 972 million in 2000.1 This number is projected to 
increase by 60%, bringing a total number of hypertensives to 
1.56 billion in 2025.1 Antihypertensive medications have been 
the mainstay of cardiovascular care during the past few decades. 
They are effective in lowering blood pressure (BP), preventing 
target organ damage, overt cardiovascular disease, and reduc-
ing mortality. Despite the documented effectiveness of antihy-
pertensive treatment, targets of BP are achieved only in 40% to 
50% of patients with hypertension,2,3 and high BP is the leading 
single risk factor for health loss and premature death globally, 
exceeding the burden of disease attributable to smoking and 
excessive weight.1 Nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment 
is increasingly recognized as a main contributor to suboptimal 
BP control at the population level, high prevalence of resis-
tant hypertension, and high financial burden for healthcare.4–13 
One of the major obstacles in management of nonadherence 
to antihypertensive treatment has been the lack of direct, suf-
ficiently sensitive, and reproducible methods of its detection 
in clinical practice.14–16 We and others have recently developed 
an objective high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS)–based assay to screen 
Abstract—Nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment is a critical contributor to suboptimal blood pressure control. 
There are limited and heterogeneous data on the risk factors for nonadherence because few studies used objective-direct 
diagnostic methods. We used high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of urine and serum to 
detect nonadherence and explored its association with the main demographic- and therapy-related factors in 1348 patients 
with hypertension from 2 European countries. The rates of nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment were 41.6% and 
31.5% in the UK and Czech populations, respectively. Nonadherence was inversely related to age and male sex. Each 
increase in the number of antihypertensive medications led to 85% and 77% increase in nonadherence (P<0.001) in the 
UK and Czech populations, respectively. The odds of nonadherence to diuretics were the highest among 5 classes of 
antihypertensive medications (P≤0.005 in both populations). The predictive model for nonadherence, including age, 
sex, diuretics, and the number of prescribed antihypertensives, showed area under the curves of 0.758 and 0.710 in the 
UK and Czech populations, respectively. The area under the curves for the UK model tested on the Czech data and for 
the Czech model tested on UK data were calculated at 0.708 and 0.756, respectively. We demonstrate that the number 
and class of prescribed antihypertensives are modifiable risk factors for biochemically confirmed nonadherence to blood 
pressure–lowering therapy. Further development of discriminatory models incorporating these parameters might prove 
clinically useful in assessment of nonadherence in countries where biochemical analysis is unavailable.  (Hypertension.

for nonadherence to most commonly prescribed antihyper-
tensive medications using an analysis of spot urine or blood 
sample.6,7,17–19 Biochemically confirmed nonadherence to anti-
hypertensive treatment shows a tight correlation with the mag-
nitude of BP elevation7 and remains the most common reason 
for pseudoresistant hypertension.12 In the absence of HPLC-MS/
MS–based urine analysis, it is difficult to confirm the nonadher-
ence to antihypertensive treatment.15,16,20,21 Patient-, treatment-, 
physician-, and healthcare-specific barriers are known to prevent 
regular administration of medications and are recognized risk 
factors of therapeutic nonadherence.22 Of those, therapy-related 
factors (such as the number and choice of antihypertensive med-
ication) are easiest to quantify, monitor, and modify. However, to 
date, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the potential 
effects of the number of prescribed antihypertensives and classes 
of BP-lowering medications on the risk of objectively measured 
biochemical nonadherence. Mindful of potential practical appli-
cations of such studies, we examined the associations between 
both the burden and choice of BP-lowering therapy in the largest 
to date analysis of ≈1400 patients whose urine/serum samples 
were examined by HPLC-MS/MS in 2 European countries.
Methods
Populations
A total of 676 UK patients with hypertension were included in this 
project. This population consisted of patients whose spot urine sam-
ples were received for screening of nonadherence to antihyperten-
sive treatment from 15 British centers by the University Hospitals of 
Leicester between 2011 and 2014. The main criterion for screening 
and the inclusion in this analysis was suspected therapeutic nonadher-
ence by a referring clinician.
We included 672 patients recruited between 2010 and 2016 in 
Hypertension Unit of the Third Department of Medicine, General 
University Hospital in Prague (Czech Republic) for replication 
purposes. Serum samples from all these patients were screened for 
nonadherence to antihypertensive therapy because of difficulty to 
manage hypertension/suboptimal BP control. Of those, 475 attended 
the outpatient service, and 197 were admitted to hospital.
Apart from age, sex, and the details of prescribed antihypertensive 
treatment, no other clinical information was collected for the purpose 
of this analysis.
In both centers, the patients were informed about the purpose of 
urine/blood analysis (screening for nonadherence to antihypertensive 
medications) by the clinical staff. This information was provided 
on the day of the sample collection. In the University Hospitals of 
Leicester, the patients provided a verbal consent for the urine analy-
sis, and the data were collected as a part of the approved clinical au-
dit (no: 7235). All Czech patients provided written consent for use 
of their anonymized laboratory and clinical data for the purpose of 
retrospective analysis. The study was granted institutional approval 
by General University Hospital (VFN/004704). All results of HPLC-
MS/MS–based analyses were collected as a part of routine clinical 
service, and data were retrieved from the existing clinical files and 
electronic systems.
Biochemistry
All urine (UK cohort) or serum (Czech cohort) samples were exam-
ined in single centers—the Department of Metabolic Medicine and 
Chemical Pathology, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, 
Leicester (UK patients), or the Toxicological Laboratory of the 
Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, General University 
Hospital, Charles University, Prague (Czech patients).
The biochemical analysis of UK samples was conducted 
on an Agilent Technologies 1290 series High Pressure Liquid 
Chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent Technologies 6460 Triple 
Quadrople Mass Spectrometer fitted with a Jetstream electrospray 
ionization source, as previously reported.7
In the Czech Republic center, serum concentrations of amlodipine, 
verapamil, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, doxazosin, losartan, 
telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, perindoprilate, ramiprilate, urapi-
dil, rilmenidine, canrenoate (metabolite of spironolactone), and fu-
rosemide were measured as reported previously.17,23–25 In outpatients, 
the sample was taken on the first visit to the outpatient department; 
in inpatients, the sample was taken on the day of admission to hos-
pital. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent 
Technologies 1200 Rapid Resolution Liquid Chromatography con-
sisting of a degasser, binary pump, autosampler, and thermostatted 
column compartment. The mass spectrometry analysis was per-
formed using an MDS Sciex3200 Q-trap triple quadrupole/linear ion 
trap mass spectrometer with a Turbo Ion Spray source.
Any deviation from prescribed antihypertensive treatment (absence 
of at least 1 prescribed BP-lowering medications/their metabolites 
in body fluids on biochemical analysis) was defined as nonadher-
ence to antihypertensive treatment. Partial/total nonadherence was 
further identified as incomplete presence/complete absence of pre-
scribed antihypertensive medications in urine/serum on this analysis, 
respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics of both populations are 
shown as means (SDs), medians (interquartile ranges), and counts 
(percentages).
Medication class–specific nonadherence was examined after cat-
egorizing antihypertensives into 5 classes (A, angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, and 
renin inhibitors; B, β-blockers; C, calcium channel blockers; D, di-
uretics; and E, other antihypertensive medications). Population-level 
average effects were derived from generalized estimating equations 
(geeR package) 26,27 taking into account the correlated nature of obser-
vations across the above 5 medication classes. The response variable 
was a binary indicator of medication class–specific nonadherence de-
fined as absence of at least 1 medication from the associated class in 
the HPLC-MS/MS–based test results. The models were adjusted for 
age, sex, and total number of antihypertensive medications prescribed.
Prediction models for the overall nonadherence, defined as nonad-
herence to at least 1 medication of any class, were built using logistic 
regression with logit link function adjusting for age, sex, number of 
prescribed antihypertensive medications, and a binary variable indi-
cating whether a patient was given diuretics (D). The discriminatory 
power of the models was evaluated using area under the curve.
The generalizability of the models, that is, their ability to predict 
outcomes using unseen/new data, was evaluated by measuring each 
population’s model’s area under the curve on the data of the other. 
The goodness-of-fit was examined using Stukel test. The percentage 
of variation in the outcome explained by independent variables was 
expressed by Nagelkerke pseudo R2. 
Sensitivity analyses stratified on the source for referral (inpa-
tient and outpatient) were conducted on the data from the Czech 
population.
Results
Basic Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
The demographic characteristics of 1348 patients with hyper-
tension stratified by population are presented in Table 1.
Nonadherence to Antihypertensive Treatment Is 
Common in United Kingdom and Czech Republic
In 676 UK patients with hypertension whose urine sample 
underwent HPLC-MS/MS analysis, the rates of any, partial, 
and total nonadherence were 41.6%, 27.1%, and 14.5%, 
respectively (Table 1). Of 2562 medications prescribed to 676 
British patients, 815 (31.8%) were not detected in urine on 
HPLC-MS/MS analysis.

The prevalence of any, partial, and total nonadherence was 
31.5%, 19.5%, and 12.1%, respectively, among 672 patients 
recruited in the Czech Republic (Table 1). The overall percent-
age of prescribed antihypertensive medications undetected 
on HPLC-MS/MS–based serum analysis was 24.1% in this 
population.
Age and Sex Are Associated With Nonadherence to 
Antihypertensive Treatment
Women were more commonly nonadherent to antihyperten-
sive treatment in both populations—the odds of the overall 
nonadherence were ≈65% and 55% higher in women than in 
men in the UK and Czech patients, respectively (Table 2). Age 
showed an inverse association with nonadherence to antihy-
pertensive treatment—every 10-year increase in age was asso-
ciated with just >30% reduction in the odds of nonadherence 
in the UK and the Czech populations (Table 2).
Number of Prescribed Antihypertensive 
Medications Is a Strong Risk Factor for 
Nonadherence to Antihypertensive Treatment
Our analysis of UK patients showed that the risk of nonad-
herence increases with the number of prescribed BP-lowering 
medications (Figure 1). Although nonadherence among those 
who were prescribed only 1 antihypertensive was minimal, the 
majority (79.3%) of UK patients prescribed ≥6 BP-lowering 
medications were nonadherent to antihypertensive treatment 
(Figure 1). This association was independent of age, sex, as 
well as the class of prescribed antihypertensive medications 
(Tables 2 and 3). We replicated these findings in the Czech 
population—the number of prescribed antihypertensive medi-
cations showed a strong association with the risk of nonadher-
ence to treatment even after adjusting for basic demographics 
and the classes of prescribed antihypertensives (Figure 1; 
Tables 2–3). On average, every increase in the number of 
prescribed antihypertensive medications was associated with 
85% and 77% increase in the odds of the nonadherence in the 
UK and Czech populations, respectively (Table 2).
Diuretics Are Associated With the Highest Odds 
of Biochemical Nonadherence Among 5 Classes of 
Antihypertensive Medications
Antihypertensive medications acting on the renin–angiotensin 
system (A) were the most commonly prescribed class of anti-
hypertensive medications in the UK population and were used 
as the reference for comparisons with other classes in both

population samples (Table 2). After adjustment for age, sex, 
and the number of prescribed medications, the odds of non-
adherence to diuretics were the highest among 5 classes of 
antihypertensive medications, ≈1.8- and 1.6-fold higher than 
the reference category (A) in the UK and Czech populations, 
respectively (Table 3).
Prediction of the Overall Nonadherence to 
Antihypertensive Treatment Based on 4 Basic 
Clinical Parameters
Based on the 4 parameters (age, sex, number of prescribed 
antihypertensives, and prescribed diuretics) associated with 
nonadherence, we built its predictive models in both popula-
tions. We fitted discrimination models in each population as 
a discovery cohort and then tested the performance of these 
models in the other data set (replication; Table 4). The area 
under the curves on the data used for model fitting were 0.758 
and 0.710 for the UK and Czech data, respectively, both 
consistent with fair discriminatory power (Table 4). Similar 
levels of area under the curve were observed when the UK 
model was tested on the Czech data (0.708) and vice versa 
for the Czech model (0.756; Table 4). The goodness-of-fit 
tests using Stuckel test did not reveal any model misspecifi-
cation (Table 4). The amount of variation in the overall non-
adherence explained by the independent variables, measured 
by Nagelkerke pseudo R2, was 27% and 16% in the UK and 
Czech models, respectively (Table 4). The probabilities of the 
overall nonadherence derived from these models are shown 
in Figure 2. For example, the probability of nonadherence in 
middle-aged women (aged, 35–55 years) on >6 antihyperten-
sive medications was >75% in both populations.
Sensitivity Analysis
The outpatient/inpatient indicator in the prediction model for 
the Czech Republic data had P value of 0.054. Its inclusion in 
the model had no effect on the odds ratio estimates for age and 
sex and reduced only slightly the odds ratio for the total num-
ber of prescribed medications from 1.77 (1.47–2.12) to 1.72 
(1.43–2.07). The indicator variable for whether patients were 
prescribed diuretics or not was kept in the model to enable 
comparison with the UK model. For the same reason—con-
sistent comparison with the UK model—the outpatient/inpa-
tient variable was dropped from the medication class–specific 
model for the Czech Republic data because it was not a sig-
nificant predictor of nonadherence (P=0.450).
Discussion
This study has provided several important insights into the 
nonadherence to antihypertensive medications and the man-
agement of hypertension. First, our data reveal a widespread 
prevalence of nonadherence, irrespective of the region/coun-
try of recruitment. Second, we show that both the number and 
the class of prescribed antihypertensives are strong indepen-
dent risk factors for biochemically confirmed nonadherence 
to antihypertensive treatment. The similarity in the direction 
and the magnitude of association between nonadherence to 
antihypertensive medications and both predictors across 2 
different health systems in 2 countries and by analysis of 2 
different biological fluids make our results extremely robust. 
Finally, we show that diagnostic models based on 4 cost free 
and easy to collect clinical parameters show a fair discrimi-
nation between adherence and nonadherence to treatment in 
patients with hypertension.

 Gupta et al  Nonadherence to Antihypertensive Treatment  1117
The correlation between the count of antihyperten-
sive medications and the increased risk of nonadherence 
was assessed in previous studies.14,28,29 Some investigations 
(mostly relying on indirect measures of adherence) proposed 
neutral30 or even positive31 effect of the number of prescrip-
tions on the concordance with therapy. To this end, the consis-
tency of almost 2-fold increase in odds of directly confirmed 
nonadherence with each additional prescribed medication in 2 
independent populations demonstrated here provides a strong 
line of evidence for polypharmacy as a potential risk factor for 
nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment. Because of the 
retrospective nature of our analysis, we are unable to assign 
directional causality to this association. Although it seems 
intuitive that the higher number of medications might increase 
the susceptibility to nonadherence, we should acknowledge 
that concealed nonadherence could also stimulate overpre-
scribing (leading to the increasing number of antihyperten-
sives). Future prospective clinical studies are warranted to 
provide clarity into the sequence and mechanisms of the dem-
onstrated associations. Nevertheless, the relationship between 
the number of prescribed antihypertensives and the nonad-
herence is an extremely important finding with direct impli-
cations for treatment escalations in difficult to treat patients 
with hypertension. Given the increase in nonadherence with 
every additional prescribed antihypertensive medication, 
the strategy of using more fixed dose combinations may be 
effective, as demonstrated before in patients with hyperten-
sion.28 However, because partial deviation from the prescribed

Czech Republic populations (gray, females; black, males).

antihypertensive treatment is the most common type of nonad-
herence, one should consider that on fixed dose combinations, 
some partially nonadherent patients might end up missing 
more prescribed medications than on individual antihyperten-
sives. Further prospective studies using HPLC-MS/MS–based 
urine analyses will be necessary to confirm directly whether 
fixed dose combinations of antihypertensive medications can 
reduce the overall burden of nonadherence in hypertensive 
population.
The highest risk for nonadherence to diuretics is in keep-
ing with previously published meta-analysis.32 Well-known 
side effects of diuretics directly affecting the quality of 
life may probably explain the highest risk of nonadherence 
(driven by low persistence) for this class of BP-lowering 
medications. However, we should also acknowledge that 
diuretics are often added to antihypertensive treatment later 
than other BP-lowering drugs, such as calcium channel 
antagonists or blockers of renin–angiotensin system. Thus, 
the increase in nonadherence to diuretics when compared 
with the usual first line antihypertensive therapies could be 
potentiated by the relationship between the existing burden 
of prescribed medications and deviation from the antihyper-
tensive therapy.
The mechanisms underlying the strong relationship 
between sex and biochemically confirmed nonadherence to 
antihypertensive medications in both populations are less 
clear. Previous studies showed either no association between 
sex with adherence33 or that females are more susceptible to 
nonadherence than males.34 Although our data seem consis-
tent with the previously demonstrated female disadvantage in 
nonadherence, in the absence of information on sex distribu-
tion of patients attending each referring center (from where 
the population samples were derived), we cannot fully exclude 
a potential contribution of sex referral bias to the detected 
association. This will require further confirmation in well-
designed prospective studies.
The published evidence for the association between non-
adherence and age is also inconsistent. Nonadherence to anti-
hypertensive treatment was reported to correlate with younger 
age35,36 and older age34 and was not associated with age at 
all.29,33 This inconsistency in associations between the non-
adherence and basic demographics is likely to arise from the 
subjective or semiobjective measures used to assess nonadher-
ence in the previous studies (ie, self-reported measures and 
retrospective pharmacy database reviews).4,14,15,37 We speculate 
that younger patients are more reluctant to accept the regu-
lar administration of medication for a chronic and generally 
asymptomatic condition, in particular, if the therapy regime 
interferes with work/daily routine. What also transpires from 
interviews with some of our nonadherent patients is a percep-
tion that regular administration of medications heralds the 
“end of youth.” This self-belief may have a negative impact 
on  adherence to antihypertensive treatment.
The fair discriminatory power of our prediction algo-
rithms across both cohorts suggests that the number/classes of 
antihypertensive medications together with age and sex might 
be a helpful template for further development of tools to esti-
mate the risk of nonadherence in centers where HPLC-MS/
MS is unlikely to become available. We accept that the 
simple predictive algorithms demonstrated in this study are 
not yet ready for immediate introduction to clinical practice. 
However, their fair power to discriminate between adherence 
and nonadherence based on only 4 cost free and easy to collect 
clinical parameters should provide an impetus for their further 
advancement in future studies. These investigations should 
pave the way to develop tools that could (at least to some 
extent) substitute subjective and often insensitive methods of 
assessing adherence in healthcare systems with limited finan-
cial resources. Indeed, we should appreciate that HPLC-MS/
MS–based analysis (because of the costs of the test and related 
infrastructure) is unlikely to become available in many devel-
oping countries. This is recognized in the medical literature 
including the recent conclusions by the Lancet Commission 
on hypertension.38 The rates of nonadherence to antihyperten-
sive therapy in those countries are not lower than in the west-
ernized societies. Therefore, we argue that inexpensive (or in 
fact cost free) predictive tools developed based on objective 
and direct methods of assessing nonadherence have a poten-
tial to equip clinicians practicing in such countries with more 
sensitive methods of estimating the risk of nonadherence than 
clinical impression.
Our analysis has several strengths. It is the largest to 
date study into the risk factors of nonadherence defined by 
a robust, direct, and objective method of its detection. We 
also demonstrate a unique replication for each of the iden-
tified associations between nonadherence and the examined 
parameters by using 2 separate populations. However, we are 
aware of some limitations of our study. First, our data col-
lection was based on retrospective analysis of clinical files 
and as such is not immune from a potential bias because of 
selection and incomplete information. Second, the rates of 
nonadherence reported here are probably higher than those in 
the general hypertensive population given the selection crite-
ria (patients with hypertension with suspected nonadherence 
and those with suboptimal BP control). Indeed, the magni-
tude of BP elevation shows a strong positive association with 
the risk of nonadherence.7 Furthermore, patients selected 
for HPLC-MS/MS screening specifically based on subop-
timal BP control exhibit much higher prevalence of nonad-
herence than those in whom the suspicion of nonadherence 
or suboptimal BP control was not the exclusive reason for 
screening.7 Finally, we accept the biochemical limitations of 
our method of diagnosing nonadherence to antihypertensive 
treatment. For example, HPLC-MS/MS–based urine analy-
sis is not immune to detection of toothbrush adherence.39 
This means that patients activating their adherence before 
the clinical appointments (similar to the behavior of patients 
brushing teeth before seeing a dentist) might be classified as 
biochemically adherent despite being therapeutically nonper-
sistent. Furthermore, a majority of antihypertensive medica-
tions retain their presence in bodily fluids long after the last 
pill had been ingested (because of their long half-lives). That 
means that for several medications (ie, indapamide—4 half-
lives: 60 hours),40 intermittent adherence/nonadherence might 
go undetected. Because of these limitations, we suspect that 
our method probably underestimates the genuine burden of 
nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment. A combination 
of electronic monitoring with direct biochemical HPLC-MS/

MS–based analysis should provide better measures of defin-
ing nonadherence in such patients.
Perspectives
Biochemical assessment of nonadherence to antihyperten-
sive medications is a useful diagnostic test in management of 
patients with hypertension, in particular those with suboptimal 
BP control. A wider use of this test may prevent many unnec-
essary investigations and treatment escalations. We anticipate 
that the simple changes in antihypertensive treatment (such 
as a reduction in the number of prescribed medications or 
single pill combinations) inspired by the results of this test 
will improve adherence and translate into better BP control in 
many nonadherent patients with hypertension.

What Is New?
• Biochemically confirmed nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment 
is inversely related to age and male sex. The risk of nonadherence in-
creases by >75% with every increase in the number of prescribed anti-
hypertensives. Biochemical nonadherence to diuretics is higher than to 
other classes of antihypertensive medications.
What Is Relevant?
• Biochemical analysis of urine/serum is a useful diagnostic strategy in 
screening for nonadherence to antihypertensive medications.
• The number and the choice of prescribed blood pressure–lowering medi-
cations should always be considered in management of nonadherence to 
antihypertensive treatment.
Summary
Nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment is common, in par-
ticular in patients on multiple blood pressure–lowering medications 
and diuretics.
