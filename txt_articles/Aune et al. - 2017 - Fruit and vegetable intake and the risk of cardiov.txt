Abstract
Background: Questions remain about the strength and shape of the dose-response rela-
tionship between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer
and mortality, and the effects of specific types of fruit and vegetables. We conducted a
systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these associations.
Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched up to 29 September 2016. Prospective
studies of fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-
cause mortality were included. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a ran-
dom effects model, and the mortality burden globally was estimated; 95 studies (142
publications) were included.
Results: For fruits and vegetables combined, the summary RR per 200g/day was 0.92 [95%
confidence interval (CI): 0.90–0.94, I2¼ 0%, n¼ 15] for coronary heart disease, 0.84 (95% CI:
0.76–0.92, I2¼ 73%, n ¼ 10) for stroke, 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90–0.95, I2¼ 31%, n¼ 13) for cardiovas-
cular disease, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–0.99, I2¼ 49%, n¼ 12) for total cancer and 0.90 (95% CI:
0.87–0.93, I2¼ 83%, n ¼ 15) for all-cause mortality. Similar associations were observed for
fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in risk were observed up to 800 g/day for all
outcomes except cancer (600 g/day). Inverse associations were observed between the intake

and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow
vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk. An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million
premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake
below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed associations are causal.
Conclusions: Fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with reduced risk of cardiovas-
cular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality. These results support public health recom-
mendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake for the prevention of cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and premature mortality.

Introduction
A high intake of fruit and vegetables is one of the corner-
stones of a healthy diet and has been recommended to the
general public to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases
and cancer, which are the two most common causes of pre-
mature death worldwide and which accounted collectively
for 25.5 million deaths in 2013.1 These recommendations
have to a large degree been based on findings from epi-
demiological studies which have shown inverse associations
between high fruit and vegetable intake and risk of certain
cancers,2 coronary heart disease3and stroke.4 However, the
question of what is the optimal level of fruit and vegetable
intake to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and premature
death is still unanswered. This is reflected by the fact that
recommendations for dietary intake vary globally. For ex-
ample, current recommendations for fruit and vegetable in-
take range from at least 400 g/day by the World Cancer
Research Fund, the WHO, and in England, to 500 g/day in
Sweden, to 600 g/day in Denmark, 650–750 g/day in
Norway, and 640–800 g/day in the USA (Table 5.2, page
60 in the report).5
Data regarding fruit and vegetable intake and cancer
risk are less clear-cut today2 than a decade or two ago.6 A
modest association between fruit and vegetable intake or
specific subtypes of fruits and vegetables and total cancer
risk cannot yet be excluded,7 but the available studies have
been inconsistent.7–21 Some studies reported inverse associ-
ations,7,8,11–13,17, 21 whereas other studies found no clear
association;9,10,14–16,18–20 however, some of these may
have had statistical power too low to detect a modest asso-
ciation.9,10,14 Cohort studies have been more consistent in
finding an inverse association between fruit and vegetable
intake and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke11,22,23
than for cancer, and this has also been shown in meta-ana-
lyses3,4 as well as in several additional studies that have
been published since these meta-analyses.16,19,23–29 In add-
ition, several10,18,27,30–33 but not all34–40 cohort studies
have found inverse associations between fruit and vege-
table intake and all-cause mortality but again, some of
these studies may have had statistical power too low to de-
tect an association.34–36,38
Key Messages
• Although a high fruit and vegetable intake has been recommended for prevention of cardiovascular disease and
some cancers, questions remain with regard to the amounts and types of fruits and vegetables that are most strongly
associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer or all-cause mortality and with regard to the
burden of disease and mortality that may be attributed to a low fruit and vegetable intake.
• In this meta-analysis of 95 studies (142 publications), reductions in risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mor-
tality were observed up to an intake of 800 g/day of fruit and vegetables combined, whereas for total cancer no fur-
ther reductions in risk were observed above 600 g/day.
• Inverse associations were observed between intake of apples/pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables/salads and
cruciferous vegetables and cardiovascular disease and mortality, and between green-yellow vegetables and crucifer-
ous vegetables and total cancer risk.
• An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable in-
take below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed associations are causal.

 However, the question of what is an optimal intake of
fruit and vegetables remains unclear because the shape of
the dose-response relationship between fruit and vegetable
intake and incidence or mortality from cardiovascular dis-
ease and total cancer as well as the association with all-
cause mortality has not been well defined. Although a recent
meta-analysis found a reduced risk of all-cause mortality
and cardiovascular disease mortality, but not cancer mortal-
ity, with greater fruit and vegetable intake,41 the review
missed or excluded a large number of publications on all-
cause mortality11,18,30,33–38,42–52 and included only studies
of cardiovascular disease mortality and cancer mortality,
not of disease incidence. Further, at least 16 additional co-
hort
studies
(17
publications)
have
since
been
pub-
lished.29,53–68 Thus questions remain with regard to the
strength and shape of the dose-response relationship be-
tween fruit and vegetable intake and chronic disease risk
and mortality, and whether fruit and vegetables also reduce
the risk of incident cardiovascular disease or cancer. In add-
ition, it is not clear whether specific types of fruits and vege-
tables are particularly beneficial with regard to reducing
chronic disease risk and mortality, since previous reviews
have not analysed fruit and vegetable subtypes.3,4,41
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
published prospective studies relating fruit and vegetable
consumption to risk of incidence or mortality from coron-
ary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular disease, and
total cancer, and to all-cause mortality, and we specifically
aimed to clarify the strength and shape of the dose-
response relationship for these associations and whether
specific types of fruit and vegetables were associated with
risk. Last, we calculated the attributable fractions of all-
cause and cause-specific mortality globally and by region
under the assumption that the observed associations are
causal.
Methods
Search strategy and inclusion criteria
We searched the PubMed and Embase databases from their
inception (1966 and 1947, respectively) up to 19 July
2016, and the search was later updated to 29 September
2016. Details of the search terms used for the PubMed
search are shown in Supplementary Table 1 (available at
IJE online) and a similar search was conducted in Embase.
Prospective studies of fruit and vegetable intake and risk of
incidence or mortality from coronary heart disease (total
coronary heart disease or major coronary event, nonfatal
myocardial infarction (MI), any MI, fatal MI, incident is-
chaemic heart disease, fatal ischaemic heart disease, acute
coronary syndrome), stroke (total stroke, ischaemic, haem-
orrhagic, intracerebral and subarachnoidal haemorrhage),
total cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease and
stroke combined), and total cancer and all-cause mortality
were included if they reported adjusted estimates of the
relative risk (RR) (including odds ratios and hazard ratios)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs); and for the dose-
response analyses, a quantitative measure of the intake for
at least three categories of fruit and vegetable intake had to
be
available.
The
excluded
studies
are
listed
in
Supplementary Table 2, available at IJE online.
Data extraction
Results and study characteristics were extracted into tables
and included: name of first author, publication year, coun-
try or region, the name of the study, follow-up period,
sample size and number of cases or deaths, type of out-
come, gender, age, type of fruit and vegetables, amount or
frequency of intake, RRs and 95% CIs and variables ad-
justed for in the analysis. We followed standard criteria for
reporting meta-analyses.69 The data extraction was con-
ducted by D.A., and was checked for accuracy by L.T.F.
and N.K.
Statistical methods
We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) of incidence or
mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardio-
vascular disease, and total cancer, and of all-cause mortal-
ity for the highest vs the lowest level and per 200 g/day of
fruits, vegetables and total fruit and vegetable intake using
the random-effects model by DerSimonian and Laird70
which takes into account both within- and between-study
variation (heterogeneity). For specific types of fruits and
vegetables we calculated summary RRs using 100 g/day as
the increment. The average of the natural logarithm of the
RRs was estimated and the RR from each study was
weighted by the method of DerSimonian and Laird.70 The
primary analysis of coronary heart disease, stroke, cardio-
vascular disease and total cancer included studies that re-
ported on both incidence and mortality from these
outcomes, but subgroup analyses were conducted separ-
ately for incidence and mortality. For studies that provided
results stratified by gender, smoking status, or other sub-
groups, but not overall, the relative risks were pooled using
a fixed-effects model before inclusion in the meta-analysis.
One exception is a study which published separately on
White37 and Black30 subjects in two different publications
and which had different durations of follow-up in the two
publications, and in this case both results were included
without combining the subgroups. For two studies we
recalculated
the
confidence
intervals
from
99%
to
95%.43,60

 We conducted linear dose-response analyses using the
method by Greenland and Longnecker71 to calculate RRs
and 95% CIs from the natural logarithm of the risk esti-
mates across categories of intake. For each category of fruit
and vegetable intake we used the mean or median if re-
ported, and the midpoint of the upper and lower bound
was estimated for the remaining studies. When extreme
categories were open-ended we used the width of the adja-
cent interval to calculate an upper or lower cut-off value.
Consistent with previous meta-analyses, we used 80 g as a
serving size for fruit and vegetable intake.72,73 For specific
fruit and vegetable types we used serving sizes as provided
in a pooled analysis of cohort studies,74 but for some sub-
types of fruits and vegetables which were not reported on
in this publication we used 80 g as a serving size as well.
We contacted the authors of six studies16,56,61,64,75,76
for information regarding the quantities of consump-
tion for subtypes of fruits and vegetables or for more
details of data which were only briefly described in
the text, and all replied and provided supplementary
information.16,56,61,64,75,76
A potential nonlinear dose-response relationship be-
tween fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular dis-
ease, cancer and mortality risks was assessed using
restricted cubic splines with three knots at 10%, 50% and
90% percentiles of the distribution, which was combined
using multivariate meta-analysis.77,78 We conducted a sen-
sitivity analysis using fractional polynomial models for the
nonlinear analysis as well,79 and we determined the best-
fitting
second-order
fractional
polynomial
regression
model, which was defined as the one with the lowest
deviance.
Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using Q
and I2 statistics.80 To explore potential heterogeneity we
conducted subgroup analyses by study characteristics.
Small-study effects such as publication bias were assessed
using Egger’s test81 and by inspection of the funnel plots.
When Egger’s test indicated bias, we tested whether this
affected the results by excluding studies with a low
number of cases or by excluding obvious outlying studies
based
on
inspection
of
the
funnel
plots.
We
also
conducted sensitivity analyses excluding each study at a
time from each analysis to clarify if the results were ro-
bust. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-
Ottawa scale which awards 0–9 stars based on the selec-
tion, comparability and outcome assessment.82 We con-
sidered
studies
with
scores
of
0–3,
4–6
and
7–9
to represent low, medium and high quality studies,
respectively. Stata version 13.0 software (StataCorp, TX,
USA) was used for the analyses.
Attributable fractions
We calculated the fraction of deaths attributable world-
wide due to low fruit and vegetable intake, assuming a
causal relationship, using the relative risks from the nonlin-
ear dose-response analysis. The prevalence of low fruit and
vegetable intake was calculated based on data from the
World Health Survey which provided estimates of fruit
and vegetable intake from 26 national population-based
surveys covering 14 geographical regions.83,84 We used
data on mortality from the Global Burden of Disease Study
2013.1 Because all the epidemiological studies included in
this meta-analysis have been conducted in mainly adult
populations, we excluded the number of deaths occurring
before 15 years age as well as the intake levels for subjects
< 15 years. The preventable proportion of deaths and cause-
specific deaths attributable to a low fruit and vegetable intake
was calculated using the formula proposed by Miettinen.85
Further information about these calculations is provided in
the Supplementary Methods, available at IJE online.

 studies were from Europe, 26 were from the USA, 20 from
Asia and five from Australia. Five publications reported re-
sults from two studies that were combined.15,54,124,134,140
Throughout the text the total number of studies and publi-
cations are reported, but the number included in each high
vs low analysis and dose-response analysis may differ
slightly because some studies only reported dichotomous
results or results on a continuous scale. The number of
studies, cases, participants and the references for the stud-
ies included in each high vs low and dose-response analysis
are provided in Table 1. The number of cases or deaths
ranged between 17 742 and 43 336 for coronary heart dis-
ease, 10 560 and 46 951 for stroke, 20 329 and 81 807 for
cardiovascular disease, 52 872 and 112 370 for total can-
cer and 71 160 and 94 235 for all-cause mortality (Table
1). The number of participants in each analysis ranged
from 226 910 to 2 123 415 (any outcome) (Table 1).

of fruit and vegetables combined, fruits alone and vege-
tables alone and coronary heart disease, respectively. The
summary RR per 200 g/day was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90–0.94,
I2¼ 0%) for fruits and vegetables (Figure 2a, b, Table 1;
Supplementary Figure 1), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86–0.94,

vegetables
(Figure
2e,
2f,
Table
1;
Supplementary
Figure 3). There was no evidence of a nonlinear association
for fruits and vegetables, Pnonlinearity ¼ 0.30, and there was
a 24% reduction in the relative risk at an intake of 800 g/
day (Figure 2b; Supplementary Table 8). Nonlinear associ-
ations
were
observed
for
fruits,
Pnonlinearity < 0.0001
(Figure 2d, Supplementary Table 9), and vegetables,
Pnonlinearity < 0.0001 (Figure 2f, Supplementary Table 9),
with most of the reductions in risk observed at the lower
levels of intake, and there was a 21% reduction in relative
risk up to 750–800 g/day for fruits and a 30% reduction in
the relative risk up to 550–600 g/day for vegetables.
Of specific types of fruit and vegetables9,10,11,28,34,36,
56,60,62,64,89,91,92,94,96,97,100,102,105,106,140–148,163,164 apples/
pears, citrus fruits, fruit juices, green leafy vegetables, beta-
carotene-rich fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruits
and vegetables showed inverse associations with coronary
heart disease in the high vs low analysis, and in addition
tomatoes were inversely associated with coronary heart dis-
ease in the dose-response analysis (Table 2; Supplementary

(95% CI: 0.79–0.96, I2¼ 63%) for vegetables (Figure 3e, f,

(Figure 3b; Supplementary Table 10), Pnonlinearity < 0.0001
(Figure 3d; Supplementary Table 11), Pnonlinearity < 0.0001
(Figure 3f; Supplementary Table 11), with stronger reduc-
tions in risk at lower levels of intake. There was a 33% re-
duction in the relative risk at intakes of 800 g/day of fruits
and vegetables, 20% reduction in the relative risk at 200–
350 g/day of fruits and 28% reduction in the relative risk

mates)108,109, eight studies (seven publications, seven risk
estimates)19,25–27,63,109,113 and six studies (five publica-
tions, five risk estimates)19,25,27,63,113 were included in the
analyses of fruits and vegetables combined, fruits, and
vegetables, and haemorrhagic stroke, respectively. The
summary RR per 200 g/day was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78–0.99,
I2¼ 0%)
for
fruits
and
vegetables
combined
(Supplementary Figure 16, Supplementary Table 29), 0.66
(95% CI: 0.50–0.86, I2¼ 57%) for fruits (Supplementary
Figures 17–19, Supplementary Tables 13, 29), and 0.76
(95%
CI:
0.55–1.06,
I2¼ 42%)
for
vegetables
(Supplementary Figures 20–22, Supplementary Tables 13,
29).
Of specific types of fruit and vegetables,11,26,56,60,62,64,109,
112,119,141–144,146,148–150,164 high intakes of apples/pears, cit-
rus fruits, fruit juice, green leafy vegetables and pickled vege-
tables were inversely associated with total stroke risk,
whereas intake of grapes was also inversely associated with
total
stroke
in
the
dose-response
analysis
(Table
3,
Supplementary Tables 21–22, Supplementary Figures 77–
109). For ischaemic stroke26,109–111,121,146,150,162,164 there
was evidence that intake of citrus fruits, citrus fruit juices,
green leafy vegetables, and vitamin C-rich fruits and vege-
tables were inversely associated with risk, but none of the as-
sociations with haemorrhagic stroke26,109,146,150,164 were
significant (Table 3; Supplementary Table 23, Supplementary
Figures 110–140).
Cardiovascular disease
Seventeen studies (16 publications),15,16,18,31,39,42,53,56,58,64,75,
86–88,98,125
25
studies
(23
publications)11,15,16,19,24,27,53–
56,58,60–64,75,76,88,98,124,125,127 and 22 studies (19 publica-
tions)15,16,19,24,27,53–56,58,62,64,75,76,88,98,124,125,127
were
included in the analysis of fruit and vegetables, fruits, and
vegetables, and cardiovascular disease, respectively. The sum-
mary RR was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90–0.95, I2¼ 31%) for fruits
and vegetables (Figure 4a, b, Table 1; Supplementary Figure
23),
0.87
(95%
CI:
0.82–0.92,
I2¼ 79%)
for
fruits
(Figure 4c, d, Table 1; Supplementary Figure 24), and 0.90
(95% CI: 0.87–0.93, I2¼ 12%) for vegetables (Figure 4e, 4f,
Table 1, Supplementary Figure 25). There was evidence of
nonlinearity, Pnonlinearity< 0.0001, for fruits and vegetables
(Figure
4b;
Supplementary
Table
14),
and
fruits,
Pnonlinearity< 0.0001, (Figure 4d; Supplementary Table 15),
and
for
vegetables,
Pnonlinearity¼ 0.04
(Figure
4f;
Supplementary Table 15), with steeper inverse associations at
lower levels of intake, although for vegetables the association
was approximately linear. There were 28%, 27% and 28%
reductions in relative risk at intakes of 800 g/day for fruits
and vegetables and fruits, and 600 g/day of vegetables,
respectively.
Of specific types of fruits and vegetables11,15,16,19,56,60–
62,64,75,87,123,124,129,141,142,144,146,148,151,152,154,159,164
there
was evidence that high vs low intake of apples/pears, citrus
fruits, carrots and noncruciferous vegetables were inversely
associated, and tinned fruits were positively associated with
cardiovascular disease risk, and in the nonlinear dose-
response analysis there was evidence that cruciferous vege-
tables, green leafy vegetables, and tomatoes were inversely
associated with risk, although few studies were included in
these analyses (Table 4; Supplementary Tables 24 and 25,
Supplementary Figures 141–178).
Total cancer
Fourteen studies (13 publications),7,8,13,15,16,18,20,42,53,56,
59,87,128 25 studies (22 publications),7–11,13–17,19–21,53,54,
56,57,59,61,65,114,128 and 19 studies (17 publications),7–9,
13,15–17,19–21,53,54,56,57,59,65,128 were included in the ana-
lysis of fruit and vegetables, fruits, and vegetables, and
total cancer, respectively. The summary RR was 0.97
(95% CI: 0.95–0.99, I2¼ 49%) for fruits and vegetables
combined
(Figure
5a,
b,
Table
1;
Supplementary
Figure 26), 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.99, I2¼ 52%) for
fruits (Figure 5c, d, Table 1; Supplementary Figure 27) and
0.96
(95%
CI:
0.93–0.99,
I2¼ 55%)
for
vegetables
(Figure 5e, f, Table 1; Supplementary Figure 28). There
was evidence of nonlinearity for fruits and vegetables,
Pnonlinearity ¼ 0.02 (Figure 5b; Supplementary Table 16),
fruits,
Pnonlinearity ¼ 0.02
(Figure
5d;
Supplementary
Table 17), and vegetables, Pnonlinearity ¼ 0.03 (Figure 5f;
Supplementary Table 17), with most of the reductions in
risk at lower levels of intake. There were 14%, 8% and
12% reductions in the relative risk for intakes of 550–
600 g/day for fruits and vegetables, fruits, and vegetables,
respectively, but there was little evidence of further reduc-
tions in risk with higher intakes.

types
of
fruits
and
vegetables8–12,14–

 35,38,40,45–47,51–58,62,66,68,75,98,131–133,136,137,139 were included
in the analysis of fruits and vegetables, fruits, and vegetables,
and all-cause mortality, respectively. The summary RR was
0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–0.93, I2¼ 83%) for fruits and vegetables
(Figure 6a, b, Table 1; Supplementary Figure 29), 0.85 (95%
CI: 0.80–0.91, I2¼ 90%) for fruits (Figure 6c, d, Table 1;
Supplementary Figure 30), and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82–0.92,
I2¼ 82%)
for
vegetables
(Figure
6e,
f,
Table
1;
Supplementary Figure 31). There was evidence of nonlinear-
ity for fruits and vegetables, Pnonlinearity < 0.0001 (Figure 6b;
Supplementary
Table
18),
fruits,
Pnonlinearity < 0.0001
(Figure 6d; Supplementary Table 18), and vegetables,
Pnonlinearity < 0.0001 (Figure 6f; Supplementary Table 18), re-
spectively, with stronger reductions in risk at lower levels of
intake. There were 31%, 19% and 25% reductions in the
relative risk with intakes of 800g/day for fruits and vege-
tables combined, and at 600 g/day for fruits, and for vege-
tables, respectively.
Of specific types of fruits and vegetables,9,11,19,30,34,37,
38,43,44,53,54,56,61,62,67,68,75,87,105,133,138,143,159
there
was
evidence that high vs low intake of apples/pears, berries,
citrus fruits, fruit juice, cooked vegetables, cruciferous
vegetables, potatoes and green leafy vegetables/salads were
inversely associated with all-cause mortality and tinned
fruits were positively associated with all-cause mortality;
whereas in the dose-response analysis fruit juice, crucifer-
ous vegetables and green leafy vegetables/salads were sig-
nificantly associated with reduced risk and tinned fruits
were
associated
with
increased
risk
(Table
6;
Supplementary Table 27, Supplementary Figures 210–
242).
Publication bias, subgroup and sensitivity
analyses
There was evidence of publication bias in some of the
analyses for coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascu-
lar
disease
and
all-cause
mortality
(Table
1;
Supplementary Figures 243–248, available at IJE online).
However, excluding studies with < 150 or < 200 cases
or outlying studies attenuated Egger’s test in several of
the analyses, but did not materially affect the strength of
the associations. In the analyses of vegetables and all-
cause mortality, exclusion of two outlying studies ex-
plained the asymmetry in the funnel plots but none of
these exclusions materially altered the summary esti-
mates. The results persisted in sensitivity analyses exclud-
ing
one
study
at
a
time
from
each
analysis
(Supplementary Figures 249–263, available at IJE online).
We also repeated the nonlinear dose-response analyses
using fractional polynomial models and in general found

 similar risk estimates compared with the restricted cubic
spline models, although the confidence intervals were
wider and there was more indication of nonlinearity (re-
sults not shown).
In subgroup analyses stratified by duration of follow-
up, outcome type (incidence vs mortality), outcome sub-
type (MI vs. total CHD, or ischemic vs hemorrhagic),
sex, geographical location, number of cases, study qual-
ity and adjustment for confounding factors, the findings
persisted across most subgroups and there was little evi-
dence
of
heterogeneity
between
most
subgroups
(Supplementary Tables 28–32, available at IJE online).
The study quality was in general high as the vast majority
of
studies
were
in
the
group
with
7–9
stars
(Supplementary Tables 28–32). The mean (median) study
quality scores of the studies included in the dose-response
analysis were 8.0 (8.0), 7.5 (8.0), 7.7 (8.0) for fruits and
vegetables, fruits, and vegetables and coronary heart dis-
ease, respectively. The respective means (medians) were
7.9 (8.0), 7.7 (8.0), and 7.7 (8.0) for stroke, 7.8 (8.0), 7.7
(8.0), 7.8 (8.0) for cardiovascular disease, 7.9 (8.0), 8.0
(8.0), and 8.1 (8.0) for total cancer, and 7.7 (8.0), 7.1 (7.
0), and 7.5 (8.0) for all-cause mortality. There was sug-
gestion of heterogeneity when studies of vegetables and
coronary heart disease were stratified by adjustment for
physical activity, with weaker (but still significant) associ-
ations
among
studies
with
such
adjustment,
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.003, compared to studies without such
adjustment. In the analysis of fruits and vegetables and
cardiovascular disease there was a weaker association
among studies with adjustment for body mass index
(BMI) than among studies without such adustment,
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.03, and in the analysis of vegetables and
cardiovascular disease there was a stronger association
among studies with mortality as the outcome com-
pared with studies with incidence as the outcome,
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.03 (Supplementary Table 30). In the
analysis of fruits and total cancer and all-cause mor-
tality there was heterogeneity (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.03 and
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.02, respectively) by adjustment for en-
ergy intake, with weaker (but still significant) associ-
ations in studies with such adjustment compared to
studies without such adjustment (Supplementary Tables
31, 32). In the analysis of fruits and vegetables and
all-cause
mortality
there
was
a
weaker
association
among the
studies that
adjusted
for red and pro-
cessed meat intake compared to studies with such
adjustment, Pheterogeneity < 0.0001, and in the analysis
of
vegetables
and
all-cause
mortality
there
was
a
stronger association among the studies without adjust-
ment for smoking than among studies with such adjust-
ment, Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.003 (Supplementary Table 32).

 Estimation of the fraction of deaths preventable
by increasing fruit and vegetable intake
Under the assumption that the observed associations are
causal we estimated that the number of premature deaths
attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 800 g/
day in 2013 was 1 340 000 for coronary heart disease,
2 680 000 for stroke, 2 270 000 for cardiovascular disease,
660 000 for cancer and 7 800 000 for all-cause mortality
(Table 7). We repeated these calculations using 500 g/day
as a reference category and arrived at 710 000 coronary
heart disease deaths, 1 470 000 stroke deaths, 1 260 000
cardiovascular disease deaths, 560 000 cancer deaths and
5 400 000 all-cause deaths (Table 7) (The combined num-
ber of deaths potentially preventable from coronary heart
disease and stroke was larger than for cardiovascular dis-
ease probably because the studies included in each analysis
were not the same and because there was a stronger associ-
ation for stroke mortality than for coronary heart disease
and cardiovascular disease mortality). The number of
deaths attributable to a low fruit and vegetable intake for
each country is provided in Supplementary Table 33. In a
sensitivity analysis, we only counted the cause-specific
deaths [from coronary heart disease, stroke and total can-
cer] for sub-Saharan Africa, and arrived at 5 240 000 and
7 630 000 premature deaths globally for an intake of 500
and 800 g/day, respectively.
Discussion
There was a 8–16% reduction in the RR of coronary heart
disease, 13–18% reduction in the RR of stroke, 8–13% re-
duction in the RR of cardiovascular disease, 3–4% reduc-
tion in the RR of total cancer and 10–15% reduction in
the RR of all-cause mortality for each 200 g/day increment
in intake of fruit, vegetables, and fruit and vegetables com-
bined. In the nonlinear models, there were 16%, 28%,
22%, 13% and 27% reductions in the RR of coronary
heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer
and all-cause mortality, respectively, for an intake of 500 g
of fruits and vegetables per day vs 0–40 g/day, whereas an
intake of 800 g/day was associated with 24%, 33%, 28%,
14% and 31% reductions in the RR, respectively. Globally
an estimated 710 000 coronary heart disease deaths, 1.47
million stroke deaths, 560 000 cancer deaths and 5.4 mil-
lion premature deaths were attributable to a fruit and vege-
table intake below 500 g/day in 2013, and this increased to
1.34 million coronary heart disease deaths, 2.68 million
stroke deaths, 660 000 cancer deaths and 7.8 million
deaths from all causes when using 800 g/day as the optimal
intake. Alternatively, using total cardiovascular disease in-
stead of coronary heart disease and stroke mortality, an
estimated 1.25 and 2.26 million cardiovascular disease
deaths were attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake
below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively.
There was evidence of nonlinearity in all analyses of
fruits and vegetables combined, apart from one, and in
most of the analyses the reduction in risk was steeper at
the lower than at the higher range of fruit and vegetable in-
take. For fruits and vegetables combined the lowest risk
was observed at an intake of 550–600 g/day (7–7.5 serv-
ings/day) for total cancer, with little evidence of further re-
ductions in risk with higher intakes, whereas for coronary
heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease and all-
cause mortality the lowest risk was observed at 800 g/day
(10 servings/day), which was at the high end of the range
of intake across studies. Fruit and vegetable intake was
only weakly associated with overall cancer risk, particu-
larly cancer incidence, which is consistent with the change
in the assessment of the evidence for several individual can-
cers as well;2 however, specific fruits and vegetables may
be more strongly related to specific cancers. We found that
several individual types of fruits and vegetables were in-
versely associated with coronary heart disease, stroke or
cardiovascular disease (apples/pears, citrus fruits, crucifer-
ous vegetables, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes and beta-
carotene-rich and vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables),
total cancer (cruciferous vegetables and green-yellow vege-
tables) and all-cause mortality (apples/pears, berries, citrus
fruits, cooked vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, potatoes,
and green leafy vegetables/salads). In contrast, intake of
tinned fruits was associated with increased risk of cardio-
vascular disease and all-cause mortality. However, because
of the low number of studies on fruit and vegetable sub-
types, the potential for selective reporting and publication
of subtypes that are significantly associated with risk, as
well as confounding from other types of fruits and vege-
tables, further studies are needed.
Our meta-analysis is in general consistent with previous
meta-analyses of fruit and vegetable intake and coronary
heart disease,3 stroke4 and mortality,41 but includes a much
larger number of studies, more detailed dose-response, sub-
group and sensitivity analyses, results for subtypes of fruit
and vegetables and estimations of the burden of mortality
due to a low fruit and vegetable intake as well. In compari-
son with the most recent meta-analysis on mortality which
included less than half the studies in the present analysis, we
found a slightly stronger association between fruit and vege-
table intake and all-cause mortality with reductions in risk
observed up to 800 g/day (or ten servings per day), although

 the reduction in risk was steepest up to 400g/day, whereas
the previous meta-analysis found no further benefit above
five servings per day (400g/day).41 In addition, we found
significant inverse associations with overall cancer risk,
which is consistent with data for some individual cancer
sites,2,72,73,165–167 but in contrast to the previous meta-anal-
ysis which may have had limited power to detect a weak
association.41 An interesting finding in the present meta-
analysis is that fruit and vegetable intake was as strongly
related to overall mortality as it was related to cardiovascu-
lar disease, but only modestly associated with cancer. One
explanation may be that the studies included in each ana-
lysis do not fully overlap. In addition, it is possible that fruit
and vegetable intake may be strongly associated with
reduced incidence or mortality from other causes including
respiratory, infectious, digestive, and inflammatory dis-
eases,168–175 and recently in the EPIC- study inverse associ-
ations were also observed for all other causes of death for
vegetables, and unknown causes of death for fruits.169
However, the available evidence for all these outcomes is
very limited. Finally, fruit and vegetable intake may reduce
the severity of disease and progression to death. Further
studies are needed to clarify the association between fruit
and vegetable intake and specific causes of death other than
cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Fruit and vegetables contain of a myriad of nutrients and
phytochemicals, including fibre, vitamin C, carotenoids,
antioxidants, potassium, flavonoids and other unidentified
compounds which are likely to act synergistically through
several biological mechanisms to reduce risk of chronic dis-
eases and premature mortality.176 Dietary fibre and fruit
and vegetable intakes have been shown to reduce cholesterol
levels, blood pressure, inflammation and platelet aggrega-
tion, and to improve vascular and immune function,177–180
and recent meta-analyses showed inverse associations be-
tween
fibre
intake
and
cardiovascular
disease.181,182
Antioxidants in fruit and vegetables may neutralize reactive
oxygen species and reduce DNA damage,178 glucosinolates
in cruciferous vegetables induce detoxifying enzymes183 and
intake of fruits, vegetables and fibre may modulate steroid
hormone concentrations and hormone metabolism178 and
may have a beneficial effect on gut microbiota.177 In add-
ition, fruit and vegetable intake has been inversely associ-
ated with risk of developing overweight or obesity and with
weight gain184–186 although data are not entirely consist-
ent;187 however, the associations observed in these analyses
appear to be independent of adiposity. A high fruit and
vegetable intake may also reduce chronic disease risk indir-
ectly, by displacement of unhealthy foods high in saturated
fat, transfat, glycaemic load and sodium; however, most of
the associations persisted in subgroups of studies that ad-
justed for dietary fat or meat intake.
Our analysis has several limitations. Combining studies
from different populations increases the sample size and stat-
istical power, but also results in heterogeneity because of dif-
ferences in the characteristics of the study populations.
Heterogeneity was low in the analyses of coronary heart dis-
ease, moderate to high for stroke, cardiovascular disease and
total cancer and high for all-cause mortality. The heterogen-
eity appeared to be driven by differences in the size of the as-
sociation more than by variation in the presence or absence
of an association, as most of the studies found inverse associ-
ations. Some heterogeneity is expected as the studies varied
by the age groups included, duration of follow-up, geograph-
ical location, sample sizes, detail of the dietary assessment
method, and factors adjusted for in the analyses. There are
also likely to be large differences between populations in the
types, amounts and preparation methods of fruits and vege-
tables consumed, as well as differences in the stability of the
intakes over time and differences in the incidence of specific
cancers and specific causes of death that contribute to total
cancer and all-cause mortality. However, when we con-
ducted subgroup analyses to investigate sources of the het-
erogeneity,
we
found
in
general
little
evidence
of
heterogeneity between most subgroups. In the few subgroup
analyses where the test for heterogeneity was significant
there were often relatively few studies in one of the sub-
groups, and chance can not be excluded as an explanation.
Fruit and vegetable intake is often associated with other
lifestyle factors such as lower prevalence of smoking, less
overweight and obesity, higher physical activity and lower
intakes of alcohol and red and processed meat, which
could have confounded the observed associations. Many
studies adjusted for these and other confounding factors,
and we found little evidence that the results varied substan-
tially whether or not adjustment for most of these con-
founders was done. It is possible that persons with a high
fruit and vegetable intake may be more likely to undergo
screening or have better access to or compliance with treat-
ment, and this could lead to an improved survival and bias
the results for mortality. There was little heterogeneity
when studies were stratified by whether the outcome was
incidence or mortality of cardiovascular disease or total
cancer, although in a few analyses risk estimates were
slightly stronger for mortality; however, power may have
been low to detect a difference because of a moderate num-
ber of studies in each subgroup. The possibility of residual
confounding by imprecisely measured, unknown or un-
measured confounders cannot be entirely excluded.
Measurement error in the assessment of fruit and vege-
table intake and changes in fruit and vegetable intake during
follow-up may have influenced the results, but to date only
the EPIC study23,75 and the China Kadoorie Cohort Study63
have assessed the impact of measurement errors and

 regression dilution bias due to changes in intake during
follow-up on these outcomes. The HR for all-cause mortality
was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96–0.98) per 200g/day of fruit and
vegetable intake without correction for measurement error
compared with 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91–0.96) with correction
for measurement error,75 and the corresponding HRs for is-
chaemic heart disease mortality (per 80 g/day) were 0.97
(95% CI: 0.95–0.99) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91–0.99),23 re-
spectively, in the EPIC study. In the China Kadoorie Cohort
Study the HR of cardiovascular death with one daily portion
of fresh fruit intake was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72–0.83) before
and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.56–0.72) after correction for regression
dilution. This suggests that both measurement error and re-
gression dilution bias may have attenuated the observed risk
estimates. We can also not entirely exclude the possibility
that the weaker dose-response curve at higher compared
with lower intakes could partly be due to measurement
errors in the assessment of fruit and vegetable intake.
Although not all studies had the same range of fruit and
vegetable intake, there was a wide range of fruit and vege-
table intake across most studies and thus the nonlinearity is
not likely to be due to single studies with a more extreme
range than others. Another limitation of the current analysis
is that there were no prospective cohort data from some re-
gions of the world including Africa, West Asia, South and
Latin America, and we cannot exclude the possibility that
the associations may differ by region or ethnicity. However,
we did not find significant heterogeneity in the association
between fruits and vegetables and the outcomes considered
by region for the geographical locations for which data were
available (North America, Europe, Australia and Asia). Two
studies on fruit and vegetable intake and all-cause mortality
in African Americans showed mixed results, with one report-
ing an inverse association,30 and a second study reporting no
clear association.139 An analysis from the Latin American
countries in the INTERHEART study suggested a similar as-
sociation between fruit and vegetable intake and coronary
heart disease188 as in the overall study.189
Last, the appropriateness of the estimates of the number
of deaths attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below
500 or 800 g/day is dependent on the validity of several as-
sumptions that were made including that of: (i) a causal re-
lationship between fruit and vegetable intake and these
outcomes; (ii) lack of confounding; and (iii) that the results
can be generalized across populations. The observed asso-
ciations appear to meet several of Bradford-Hill’s criteria
for causation including consistency of findings in different
people and regions (by sex and geographical region), tem-
porality, some evidence of a biological gradient, plausibil-
ity, coherence between epidemiological and laboratory
findings and experimental evidence (on intermediate risk
markers).190
However,
although
the
strength
of
the
association is moderate across the range of fruit and vege-
table intake with a 31% reduction in the relative risk of
all-cause mortality comparing an intake of 800 g/day with
no intake, weak or moderate associations should not be
dismissed as non-causal.190 In addition, the criteria of spe-
cificity is less important because many risk factors are
causes of multiple diseases, and this is likely to be the case
for a low fruit and vegetable intake. As already mentioned,
the association between fruit and vegetable intake and car-
diovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality per-
sisted in many subgroup analyses when stratified by
adjustment for confounding factors. Thus although we
cannot entirely rule out the possibility that residual con-
founding could partly explain the associations, it seems
less likely that it could entirely explain the observed associ-
ations. Confounding might exaggerate the observed associ-
ations but measurement errors would most likely tend to
attenuate the observed associations. Because the distribu-
tions of causes of death differ substantially in sub-Saharan
Africa compared with other regions, the results from exist-
ing cohort studies on all-cause mortality may not be gener-
alizable to this region. The calculations for this region
were done conservatively and we also conducted sensitivity
analyses only counting the cause-specific deaths (coronary
heart disease, stroke and cancer) from sub-Saharan Africa,
but this did not substantially alter the number of deaths
globally that were attributable to an inadequate fruit and
vegetable intake (which was reduced from 5.4 to 5.2 mil-
lion for an intake below 500 g/day and from 7.8 to 7.6 mil-
lion for an intake below 800 g/d). Nevertheless, we cannot
exclude the possibility that these estimates might change
when additional data from other geographical locations
and on specific causes of death become available.
As a meta-analysis of published literature, the analysis
may have been affected by small-study effects such as pub-
lication bias. There was indication of small-study bias in
several of the analyses, and we may therefore have slightly
overestimated some of the associations. However, we
found that exclusion of studies with a smaller number
cases or deaths or exclusion of outlying studies attenuated
the tests for publication bias, but in most cases did not sub-
stantially alter the summary estimates.
Strengths of this analysis include the wide search terms
used, the large number of studies included from various
geographical locations and the large number of cases and
deaths (up to 43 000 coronary heart disease cases, 47 000
stroke cases, 81 000 cardiovascular disease cases, 112 000
cancer cases and >71 000–94 000 deaths among up to 2.1
million participants) which provided increased statistical
power to detect significant associations, the robustness of
the findings in comprehensive subgroup and sensitivity
analyses, the high study quality of the included studies and

 the detailed dose-response analyses which allowed us to
clarify the strength and shape of the dose-response rela-
tionship between fruit and vegetable intake and these out-
comes. In addition, similar associations were observed
when analyses were stratified by geographical regions
which have different underlying patterns of diet and other
confounding factors, suggesting that unknown confound-
ers are not likely to entirely explain the associations
observed. Our meta-analysis provides further support for
public health recommendations, interventions, and policies
to promote a high fruit and vegetable intake to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and premature mor-
tality. Improving the availability and affordability of fruits
and vegetables, particularly in low- and middle-income
countries, might be important for increasing fruit and vege-
table intake globally.191 Any further studies should try to
further define the dose-response relationship at more ex-
treme levels of intake and report more detailed results for
subtypes of fruits and vegetables in relation to these out-
comes. Further studies in other geographical locations and
of other less common causes of death, and incorporating
biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake, are also urgently
needed. This will allow us to conduct updated and more
refined estimations of the mortality burden due to an inad-
equate fruit and vegetable intake worldwide in the future.
In conclusion, we found an inverse association between
intake of fruits, vegetables, and fruit and vegetables com-
bined, and the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, cardio-
vascular disease, total cancer and all-cause mortality. In
most of the analyses the reductions in risk were steeper at the
lower range of intake. For total cancer the lowest risk was
observed at an intake of 600g/day (7.5 servings/day),
whereas for coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular
disease and all-cause mortality the lowest risk was observed
at 800 g/day (10 servings/day), a level of intake that is
double the five servings per day (400 g/day) currently
recommended by the World Cancer Research Fund, the
WHO, and in England.5 In 2013, an estimated 1 340 000
coronary heart disease deaths, 2 680 000 stroke deaths, 660
000 cancer deaths and 7.8 million premature deaths were
attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 800 g/day
globally. A change in the diet towards a higher intake of fruit
and vegetables and other plant foods could also have other
important health168–175,192,193 as well as environmental
benefits.194 Our meta-analysis provides further support for
public health recommendations and interventions to increase
fruit and vegetable intake for prevention of cardiovascular
disease, cancer and premature mortality.
