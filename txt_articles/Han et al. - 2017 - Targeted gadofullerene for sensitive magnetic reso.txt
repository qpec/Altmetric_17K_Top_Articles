Molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers is critical for non-invasive accurate cancer detection
and risk-stratification in precision healthcare. A peptide-targeted tri-gadolinium nitride
metallofullerene,
ZD2-Gd3N@C80,
is
synthesised
for
sensitive
molecular
magnetic
resonance imaging of extradomain-B fibronectin in aggressive tumours. ZD2-Gd3N@C80 has
superior r1 and r2 relaxivities of 223.8 and 344.7 mM−1 s−1 (1.5 T), respectively. It generates
prominent contrast enhancement in aggressive MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer in
mice at a low dose (1.7 µmol kg−1, 1 T), but not in oestrogen receptor-positive MCF-7
tumours. Strong tumour contrast enhancement is consistently observed in other triple
negative breast cancer models, but not in low-risk slow-growing tumours. The dose of
the contrast agent for effective molecular MRI is only slightly higher than that of ZD2-Cy5.5
(0.5 µmol kg−1) in fluorescence imaging. These results demonstrate that high-sensitivity
molecular magnetic resonance imaging with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 may provide accurate
detection and risk-stratification of high-risk tumours for precision healthcare of breast cancer.

recision medicine requires accurate detection and char-
acterisation of tumours for tailoring personalised therapies
to improve healthcare of cancer patients. Non-invasive
sensitive imaging of tumour markers is essential for accurate
cancer detection and characterisation of tumour aggressiveness1.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful clinical imaging
modality that provides high-resolution three-dimensional images
of soft tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) molecular imaging or
molecular MRI of cancer biomarkers can facilitate non-invasive
cancer detection and characterisation, image-guided interventions
and
therapeutic
efficacy
assessment
in
cancer
precision
medicine2, 3. High spatial resolution of MRI allows early detection
of tumours as small as a few hundred cells, a few hundred
microns in size4. Paramagnetic materials, including stable Gd(III)
chelates and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, are
often used as contrast agents to increase T1 and T2 relaxation
rates of water protons in the tissues of interest and to produce
contrast enhancement for diagnostic imaging5, 6. Despite the
continuous efforts in developing novel MRI contrast agents, there
is a serious lack of safe and effective-targeted contrast agents for
high-sensitivity molecular MRI in clinical practice.
MR signal enhancement is determined by the extent of increase
in the water-proton relaxation rate, which is proportional to both
the concentration and relaxivity of the contrast agents. Currently,
the design of targeted MRI contrast agents mostly focuses on
increasing their local concentration around the molecular targets,
e.g. using nanoparticles with high payloads of paramagnetic
materials7. Various nanosized-targeted contrast agents, including
superparamagnetic iron oxide, Gd(III) and Mn(II)-containing
nanoparticles8–10, have shown promise in MR molecular imaging.
However, because of their low relaxivity, a relatively large dose is
required to produce detectable signal enhancement. High dose of
nanoparticle contrast agents may cause unintended side effects
due to their slow excretion and accumulation in normal tissues11,
12. Recently, a new strategy of targeting abundant biomarkers in
the tumour microenvironment using small peptide conjugates of
clinical Gd(III)-based MRI contrast agents has been developed4.
Although this approach facilitates faster excretion of the targeted
contrast agents in molecular MRI13, a relatively high dose of these
agents is still required to generate detectable signal enhancement.
Thus, the design and development of better contrast agents
with high relaxivities is essential to significantly improve the
sensitivity of molecular MRI and to reduce the local concentra-
tion and dose of the contrast agents, which will minimise
potential dose-dependent toxic side effects. Recently, gadofuller-
enes have emerged as a novel class of paramagnetic materials with

 superior relaxivities, suitable for the design of targeted MRI
contrast agents for sensitive molecular MRI14–17. For example,
hydroxylated tri-gadolinium nitride metallofullerene Gd3N@C80
possesses an r1 relaxivity that is ~20 times that of conventional
Gd-based contrast agents (GBCAs)5, 18. In addition, Gd(III) ions
are encapsulated in the fullerene cage, preventing the release of
toxic free Gd(III) ions into the body19. The small size (ca. 1 nm)
of gadofullerenes also allows for complete clearance from the
body via renal filtration. Therefore, targeted gadofullerenes are
promising targeted MRI contrast agents that can address the
limitations and toxicity of the existing MRI contrast agents for
safe and sensitive molecular MRI in clinical practice.
Extradomain-B fibronectin (EDB-FN) is a marker for epithe-
lial-to-mesenchymal
transition
(EMT), a
biological process
associated with tumour invasion, metastasis and drug resis-
tance20–23. EDB-FN is highly expressed in the extracellular matrix
of many types of aggressive human cancers24, 25. Clinical evidence
shows that EDB-FN overexpression is associated with poor
prognosis of a variety of cancers26–28. Thus, it is a promising
target for cancer detection and characterisation with molecular
MRI. We have identified a small peptide ZD2 (Cys-Thr-Val-Arg-
Thr-Ser-Ala-Asp) for specific targeting to EDB-FN24. We have
shown that Gd(HP-DO3A) modified with linear ZD2 peptide
(Thr-Val-Arg-Thr-Ser-Ala-Asp) can be used to characterise
prostate cancer aggressiveness in MRI29.
In this work, we synthesise a high-relaxivity-targeted contrast
agent by conjugating a small peptide ZD2 to hydroxylated
Gd3N@C80, ZD2-Gd3N@C80, for sensitive molecular MRI of
breast cancer. The targeted contrast agent has a superior T1
relaxivity, about 20 times higher than the conventional Gd-based
MRI contrast agents. The effectiveness of the agent for sensitive
detection of aggressive tumours and risk-stratification is tested
in multiple aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and
low-risk breast cancer models in mice. MRI with the targeted
contrast agent at significantly reduced doses produces strong
signal enhancement in aggressive TNBC tumours, not in slow-
growing low-risk breast tumours. The targeted contrast agent
ZD2-Gd3N@C80 is effective for sensitive molecular MRI for the
detection and risk-stratification of aggressive breast cancer.
Results
Gd3N@C80 was first oxidised with succinic acid peroxide
and NaOH to introduce carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the
fullerene cage surface (Fig. 1)30. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric
analysis of the hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 suggested an estimated
structure of Gd3N@C80(OH)18(CH2CH2COOH)6. Some of the
carboxyl groups in the hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 were then
converted into amines, followed by reaction with maleimido-
opfp, yielding maleimido-Gd3N@C80 for conjugation with thiol-
bearing ZD2 peptide (Fig. 1). An excess of ZD2 peptide was used
to conjugate to maleimido-Gd3N@C80. The N–H and C–N peaks
in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Fig. 2a)
indicated successful conjugation of the ZD2 peptide. The
structure
was
also
characterised
with
MALDI-TOF
mass
spectrometry, indicating approximately one ZD2 peptide was
conjugated to each Gd3N@C80.
The peptide-targeted tri-gadolinium nitride metallofullerene
ZD2-Gd3N@C80 showed complete water solubility (Fig. 2a),
which is essential for further clinical development. The r1 and r2
relaxivities of hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 and ZD2-Gd3@NC80
were determined at 1.5 Tesla. The hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 had
r1 and r2 relaxivities of 57.1 and 98.5 mM−1 s−1 per Gd ion(III),
respectively (Fig. 2b). ZD2-Gd3@NC80 had superior r1 and r2
relaxivities of 223.8 and 344.7 mM−1 s−1 per molecule or 74.6 and
114.9 mM−1 s−1 per Gd(III) ion (Fig. 2c), respectively. The
increased relaxivities of ZD2-Gd3@NC80 may be attributed to
slower tumbling rate and increased rotational correlation time of

 the targeted agent due to the increased size after peptide
conjugation. The r1 relaxivity of ZD2-Gd3@NC80 is almost
20 times that of clinical Gd(III)-based contrast agents, including
Gd-DTPA and Gd(HP-DO3A)5. The high r1 relaxivity of
the hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 is attributed to strong magnetisa-
tion of the hydroxyl protons on the cage by the encapsulated Gd
(III) ions and rapid exchange rate of the protons with water
protons in the surrounding bulk. This superior relaxivity is
critical to improving the sensitivity of contrast enhanced MRI,
especially T1-weighted MRI, for molecular imaging at low doses
on most clinical scanners with relatively low magnetic field
strengths (1.5 and 3 Tesla). At 7 Tesla, the r1 relaxivities of
hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 and ZD2-Gd3N@C80 were 24.68 and
24.78 mM−1 s−1 per Gd(III) ion, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 1). It appears that the slower tumbling rate and increased
rotational correlation time of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 had less effect
on improving the relaxivities at the high magnetic field strength.

average
diameter
of
2.8 nm,
as
determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2d)
and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. 2e), which is smaller
than the renal filtration threshold. This small size is necessary
for rapid extravasation, target binding for effective molecular
MRI and the elimination of the unbound agent from systemic
circulation via renal filtration.

 EDB-FN expression was determined in three TNBC cell lines
(MDA-MB-231, Hs578T and BT549) and three oestrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75-1
and
T47D)
using
quantitative
real-time
polymerase
chain
reaction (qRT-PCR). The mRNA levels of EDB-FN in all
the TNBC lines were significantly higher than those in the
ER-positive cell lines (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Western
blot analysis also revealed abundant expression of EDB-FN in
MDA-MB-231 tumours and negligible expression in MCF-7
tumours (Fig. 3b). In matrigel-based three-dimensional (3D)
culture, MDA-MB-231 cells were able to form large spherical
structures, indicating the aggressive nature of the TNBC cells
(Fig. 3c). In contrast, MCF-7 cells formed smaller cell clusters
with limited matrigel invasion, suggesting the low invasiveness of
the cells (Fig. 3c). The MDA-MB-231 spheres incubated with
ZD2-Cy5.5 showed strong fluorescence intensity under confocal
microscopy, indicating high expression of EDB-FN protein
and strong binding of the peptide probe in these spheres.
In comparison, MCF-7 cells showed lower ZD2-Cy5.5 binding
and weaker fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3c).
To further validate the in vivo targeting specificity of the ZD2
peptide, ZD2-Cy5.5 was intravenously injected at a dose of
0.5 µmol kg−1 into the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 tumour-bear-
ing mice. Figure 3d shows the fluorescence images of ZD-Cy5.5 in
the tumours and other major organs at 3 h after injection.
Fluorescence intensity was greater in the MDA-MB-231 tumours
than the MCF-7 tumours and normal tissues and organs.
Relatively high fluorescence signal intensity was seen in the
liver and kidneys, because the probe is mainly excreted via
these organs. EDB-FN expression and ZD2-Cy5.5 binding in
the two tumour models were also verified by correlating
immunofluorescence staining of EDB-FN and Cy5.5 fluorescence
imaging (Fig. 3e). MDA-MB-231 tumour sections were rich in
EDB-FN expression and showed strong Cy5.5 fluorescence,
whereas little EDB-FN expression and ZD2-Cy5.5 binding were
seen in the MCF-7 tumour sections. Microscopically, the
aggressive MDA-MB-231 TNBC tumour sections displayed a
higher cell density than the ER-positive MCF-7 tumours (Fig. 3f).
Taken
together,
these
results
validate
the
strong
positive
correlation of EDB-FN expression with tumour aggressiveness
and the specific binding of ZD2 peptide to the highly abundant
EDB-FN in the MDA-MB-231 tumours.
We next tested whether molecular MRI with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 at
1 Tesla could detect the aggressive MDA-MB-231 tumours and
differentiate the aggressive TNBC tumours from MCF-7 tumours in
animal models. MR image acquisition was performed with mice
bearing MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 tumour xenografts before
and after intravenous injection of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 at a dose of
1.67 µmol kg−1 or 5 µmol-Gd/kg, which is 20 times less than
the standard dose of conventional clinical contrast agents, such as
Gd-DTPA and Gd(HP-DO3A)31. Significant signal enhancement
was observed in the MDA-MB-231 tumours for at least 30 min after
the injection, while little enhancement was observed in the MCF-7
tumours or both tumours injected with non-targeted hydroxylated

Co-injection
of
1.67 µmol kg−1
of
ZD2-Gd3N@C80 with 25 µmol kg−1 of ZD2 peptide significantly
reduced the signal enhancement in MDA-MB-231 tumours due to
competitive binding to the target. Quantitative analysis revealed that
ZD2-Gd3N@C80 produced 39 to 45% increase of contrast-to-noise
ratio (CNR) in the MDA-MB-231 tumours (Fig. 4b). The smaller
size of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 facilitates rapid tumour extravasation,
target binding, and clearance from circulation, and enables
rapid sensitive detection of aggressive TNBC with high CNR.
No significant difference was observed in signal enhancement in
the normal tissues before and after contrast injection in all
the tested groups, except for the excretory organs: kidneys
and bladder (Supplementary Fig. 3). Increased signal intensity in
the bladder indicates the excretion of unbound ZD2-Gd3N@C80
via renal filtration.
The systemic retention of both ZD2-Gd3N@C80 and hydro-
xylated Gd3N@C80 was determined at 1 week post-injection using
ICP-OES. The amount of Gd(III) in the body was near the detec-
tion limit of the ICP-OES. Both the agents had <0.5% of the
injected dose remaining in the tissues and organs at 1 week post-
injection (Fig. 4c). The potential release of the free Gd(III) ions was
also tested by in vitro transmetallation assay with human serum. No
transmetallation of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 (<0.12%) was observed
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Studies show that fullerene cages are highly
stable and the metal ions are stably enclosed in these cages18, 30.
Metallofullerene cages have been reported to even withstand
exposure to β-radiation18. The residual endogenous metal ions seen
in our study could be the result of the weak complexation of the
peptide with the endogenous metal ions. Consistent with previous
reports19, 32, the entrapment of the toxic Gd(III) ions in the full-
erene cage prevents their systemic release and tissue interaction,
which is critical for the safety of the Gd(III)-based contrast agents
in consideration of clinical translation. These results suggest that
ZD2-Gd3N@C80 has the potential to overcome the reported toxic
side effects of the existing GBCAs, caused by the release and
retention of free Gd(III) ions in the body.
The potential of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 for differentiating breast
cancer aggressiveness was further assessed in mice bearing ZR-75-1,
Hs578T, T47D and BT549 breast cancer xenografts. The ER-posi-
tive ZR-75-1 and T47D xenografts showed a very slow rate of
growth and relatively smaller tumour sizes as compared with the
Hs578T and BT549 TNBC tumours. At 7 T, injection of 20 µmol
Gd/kg ZD2-Gd3N@C80 produced greater signal enhancement and
significantly higher CNR increase in the fast-growing Hs578T and
BT549 tumours than in the slow-growing ZR-75-1 and T47D
tumours (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that ZD2-Gd3N@C80
is an effective high-relaxivity-targeted contrast agent that can
improve the sensitivity of molecular MRI for the detection and
characterisation of aggressive breast tumours.
This study has demonstrated that the peptide-targeted gado-
fullerene with superior relaxivities can significantly improve the
sensitivity of molecular MRI in detection and characterisation of
aggressive breast cancer. We have shown that the superior relax-
ivity of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 markedly improved the sensitivity of MR
imaging of the oncoprotein EDB-FN in aggressive breast cancer.
MRI with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 produces robust signal enhancement
in aggressive MDA-MB-231 TNBC tumours at a much lower dose
(1.67 µmol kg−1) at 1 Tesla, a sensitivity comparable with that of
fluorescence imaging of ZD2-Cy5.5 (0.5 µmol kg−1) in Fig. 3. The
targeted contrast agent also produced strong enhancement in two
other TNBC tumour models, not in slow-growing low-risk
tumours at a high-field strength (7 Tesla) and reduced dose. These
results have demonstrated the ability of the novel-targeted con-
trast agent for differentiating the fast-growing aggressive TNBC
tumours from the slow-growing, non-metastatic and ER-positive
breast cancers. Our work pioneers effective non-invasive differ-
entiation between breast tumours of different aggressiveness using
contrast enhanced MRI. EDB-FN is also highly expressed in other
types of aggressive tumours, including prostate cancer24, head and
neck cancer33 and ovarian cancer34. Therefore, molecular MRI
with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 can potentially be used for accurate
detection and characterisation of a broad spectrum of aggressive
cancers with high sensitivity and superior resolution. The low
dose, rapid renal clearance and absence of potential release of free
Gd(III) ions of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 are advantageous safety features
for improving the safety profile of GBCAs in clinical use. Clinical
translation of molecular MRI with ZD2-Gd3N@C80 has the
potential to overcome the limitations of current imaging tech-
nologies and to significantly improve the accuracy of early
detection and characterisation of high-risk breast cancer for pre-

 peptide synthesis were purchased from Anaspec (Fremont, CA, USA).
N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was purchased from MP Biomedicals, LLS
(Solon, OH, USA. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM) and
piperidine were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Gd3N@C80 was purchased from SES Research (Houston, TX, USA). Maleimide-
opfp (pentafluorophenyl 3-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)propanoate)
was synthesised according to a reported protocol13.
Oxidation of Gd3N@C80. At 0 °C, succinic anhydride (1.5 g, 15 mmol) was added
dropwise to hydrogen peroxide and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The
product was washed with pure water and filtered, followed by lyophilisation for
further use. Succinic acid acyl peroxide (8.0 mg, 5 equiv) was added to Gd3N@C80
(10 mg) in 10 mL o-dichlorobenzene. The resultant solution was de-aerated by
flashing with nitrogen and heated at 84 °C for 48 h. Additional succinic acid acyl
peroxide (8 mg each time) was added at an interval of 12 h during the reaction.
A brown sludge precipitated from the solution at the end of the reaction. Then,
20 mL 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution was added to extract the water-soluble
product. The top aqueous layer was deep brown and the bottom layer was
colourless. The top layer was concentrated, adjusted to pH of 3–4 and purified with
a PD10 column, and lyophilised to yield Gd3N@C80(OH)18(CH2CH2COOH)6 (2)
(yield, 74%). MALDI-TOF (m/z, [M+Na]+): 2221(obsd); 2212 (calc).
Synthesis of ZD2-Gd3N@C80. Gd3N@C80(OH)18(CH2CH2COOH)6 (6 mg)
and mono-Fmoc ethylenediamine (5 equiv) were dissolved in DMF, and then
HBTU (5 equiv) and DIPEA (5 equiv) were added. The reaction was stirred at
room temperature for 2 h. Piperidine/DMF (20%, v/v) was used to remove the
protecting group of Fmoc. Afterwards, the product was precipitated in cold ether to
obtain Gd3N@C80(OH)18(CH2CH2COOH)x(NH2)y (3) of brown colour. (yield,
63%). Gd3N@C80(OH)18(CH2CH2COOH)x(NH2)y (3 mg) was dissolved in DMF
(5 mL) and excess maleimido-opfp (20 mg) was added. The reaction continued
for 30 min before precipitating in cold ether to give maleimido-containing
hydroxylated Gd3N@C80. ZD2-Cys peptide (sequence: Cys-Thr-Val-Arg-Thr-Ser-
Ala-Asp) was synthesised in solid phase using standard Fmoc-chemistry. Excess
ZD2-Cys and Gd3N@C80(OH)18(CH2CH2COOH)x(MAL)y were dissolved in pure
water and stirred for 30 min. Then the solution was concentrated and purified with
PD10 column. The final product ZD2-Gd3N@C80 was collected and lyophilised
(yield, 82%). MALDI-TOF ([M+2Na+2K+H]+: m/z = 3927 (obsd); 3922 [estimated
for Gd3N@C80(OH)18(COOH)2(MAL)4-Cys-ZD2].
Synthesis of ZD2-Cy5.5. ZD2 peptide (sequence: Thr-Val-Arg-Thr-Ser-Ala-Asp)
was synthesised in solid phase using standard Fmoc-chemistry. After Fmoc
removal with 10% piperidine, Fmoc-9-amino-4,7-dioxanonanoic acid (ChemPep,
Inc., Wellington, FL, USA) was added to the peptide sequence. After Fmoc removal
with 10% piperidine, the resin was washed with DMF/DCM and air-dried, and
10 mg of the dried resin was swelled in DCM for 1 h, followed by reaction with
3 mg Cy5.5-NHS ester (Lumiprobe Corporation, Hallandale Beach, FL, USA) in
presence of 5 μL DIPEA. Reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature.
Excess Cy5.5-NHS ester was removed by filtration and washing with DMF/DCM
10 mL three times. Peptides were cleaved off resin using TIPS, and precipitated in
cold ether. The products were separated from ether by centrifugation at 4000×g.
The final product was characterised by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry ([M+1]+:
m/z = 1473.76 (obsd); 1472.78 (calc.)). The product was lyophilised and
reconstituted in 500 μL PBS. The concentration of the solution was characterised
by measuring absorbance at 650 nm.
FTIR and relaxivity measurement. Infrared spectrum of ZD2-Gd3N@C80 was
performed using the Cary 630 FTIR Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). Lyophilised hydroxylated Gd3N@C80 or ZD2-Gd3N@C80 was
reconstituted to a serial dilution in water. The solutions were pipetted in NMR
tubes (500 μL in each tube), and placed in a relaxometer (Bruker) at 1.5 Tesla. For
relaxivity measurement at 7 Tesla, NMR tubes containing contrast agent solutions
were bundled and placed in a mouse coil in a horizontal 7 Tesla Bruker scanner
(Bruker Biospin Co., Billerica, MA). T1 maps of the solutions were acquired using a
previously reported method29. T1 and T2 values of each solution were measured.
The r1 and r2 relaxivities of the contrast agent were calculated as the slope of the
plot of 1/T1 and 1/T2 relaxation rates against the concentrations.
Cell culture. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and T47D were
acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).
MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% penicillin/
streptomycin (pen/strep). Hs578T, BT549 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in
Eagle’ Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 0.01 mg mL−1
human recombinant insulin, 10% FBS and 5% pen/strep. ZR-75-1 and T47D were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% pen/strep.
Three-dimensional culture of cells was achieved by an ‘on-top’ matrigel method
reported previously35. Briefly, on a glass-bottom plate a thick layer of matrigel was
coated, followed by plating MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells on top of the matrigel.
Once 3D sphere or clusters formed, ZD2-Cy5.5 was added to the medium to the
final concentration of 250 nM. Binding of ZD2-Cy5.5 to the 3D spheres was
evaluated using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) after culturing for 1 h.
RT-PCR. RNA was harvested from cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat. #
74134, Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany) and reverse transcription was carried out with
the miScript II RT Kit (Cat. # 218161, Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany), according to
manufacturer’s protocols. qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Cat. # 4309155, Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the
Eppendorf RealPlex Thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA). Cycle
threshold (Ct) values were evaluated by the RealPlex 2.2 software system
(Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA). Expression levels of human EDB-FN were
analysed in triplicate by the 2−ΔΔCt method and normalised to the expression levels
of β-actin. Significance was found when P ≤ 0.05. Primers were obtained from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and sequences are as follows: human EDB-FN
forward: 5ʹ-CCTGGAGTACAATGTCAGTG-3ʹ, human EDB-FN reverse:
5ʹ-GGTGGAGCCCAGGTGACA-3ʹ, human β-actin forward: 5ʹ-GTTGTCGAC-
GACGAGCG-3ʹ, human β-actin reverse: 5ʹ-AGCACAGAGCCTCGCCTTT-3ʹ.
Animal tumour models. Female athymic nude mice were purchased from the Case
Comprehensive Cancer Center and housed in the Case Center Imaging Research.
All animal experiments were carried out according to a protocol approved by the
IACUC of Case Western Reserve University. To initiate tumour xenografts, cells
cultured in 150 mm dishes were trypsinised and centrifuged. Cell pellets from each
dish were suspended in 100 μL PBS and reconstituted with Corning Matrigel
Matrix High Concentration (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) to a concentration of
2 × 107 cells per mL on ice. The suspended cells in 100 μL matrigel solution were
injected subcutaneously in the flank of mice (4–6 weeks) using a 19-gauge needle.
After injection, a plug in flank was formed due to matrigel gelling. Tumours were
allowed to grow for at least a month before imaging. To prepare mice bearing
Hs578T on the right flank and ZR-75-1 on the left flank or BT549 on the right
flank and T47D on the left flank), ZR-75-1 and T47D cell inoculations were
performed at 4 weeks prior to Hs578T and BT549 inoculations. MRI were
performed at 5 weeks after inoculating Hs578T and BT549 cells.
Western blot. The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 tumours were collected and
homogenised in 200–500 μL T-PER buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supple-
mented with the protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and PMSF
(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) (Sigma-Aldrich). Centrifugation at 10,000×g for
10 min at 4 °C was used to remove insoluble components. Protein concentrations
were quantified by BCA assay (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins of 25 μg were
loaded for SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The anti-EDB-FN antibody
(ab154210, BC-1, Abcam, Hercules, CA) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse
secondary antibody (ab97264, Abcam) were used. The fluorescein-conjugated
anti-β-actin antibody was used for visualisation of β-actin. The Typhoon trio
scanner (GE healthcare) was used for visualisation of EDB-FN and β-actin bands
using the channel for fluorescein.
Fluorescence imaging. To determine the distribution of ZD2-Cy5.5 in the major
organs and tumours, 10 nmol ZD2-Cy5.5 was injected in tumour-bearing mice
through the tail vein. At 3 h after injection, mice were killed. Tumours and organs
were collected and imaged with CSi Maestro imaging system (Woburn, MA, USA)
using the deep red filter sets (exposure time: 1000 ms).
Histological analysis. Tumours were embedded in Optimum Cutting Tempera-
ture Compound (OCT) and kept froze in −80 °C. Tumour tissues sectioned at the
thickness of 5 µm were then fixed and permeabilised with cold acetone. BSA (1%)
in PBS was used to block the tissue at room temperature for 1 h. Mouse anti-EDB-
FN antibody, BC-1 (ab154210, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), diluted with 1%
BSA (1:500) was applied to the tissue and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.
After extensive washing, AlexFluor594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody
(1:500) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) was applied and incubated with the tissue
for 1 h. Tissue sections were then counterstained with Prolong Gold antifade
mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal laser scanning microscopy
(FV1000, Olympus, Japan) was used to acquire the fluorescence images of the
tissues. H&E staining of the tissue was performed at the tissue resource core of
Case Western Reserve University. H&E staining images were acquired using the
Virtual slide microscope VS120 (Olympus).
MR imaging. MR images of the mice bearing MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 tumour
xenografts were acquired on an Aspect M3 small animal MRI scanner (1 Tesla).
Mice were placed on a holder with the temperature maintained at 37°C, with
isoflurane/oxygen mixture supplied to the mice through a nose cone. A thin
catheter filled with PBS was connected to the tail vein of the mice. After mice were
placed in the coil, a pilot scan was performed to adjust mice to the proper
location in the coil. An axial T1-weighted sequence (TR = 500 ms; TE = 9 ms;
flip angle = 90°; field of view (FOV) = 3 cm × 3 cm; matrix size = 128 × 128 × 8;

 slice thickness = 2 mm; interslice distance = 1 mm) was then used to acquire the
images of the tumours before and 10 min, 20 min and 30 min after contrast
injection. Images were exported into DICOM data, which were then processed
and analysed using Matlab (Natick, MA, USA). The CNR ratio of tumours in
the images was calculated as the difference between tumour mean intensity
minus muscle mean intensity, divided by the noise. Three-dimensional images of
mice were acquired using a gradient echo T1-weighted sequence with the following
parameters: TR = 17 ms; TE = 6 ms; flip angle = 15°; FOV = 3.5 cm × 8 cm;
matrix size = 128 × 512 × 16; slice thickness = 1.5 mm. Analysis of the change in
signal intensity in muscle, heart, liver, kidney and bladder was performed using
Matlab. MRI at 7 Tesla was performed on a horizontal Bruker scanner. T1-weighted
spin-echo sequence with the following parameters was used: FOV: 3 cm;
slice thickness: 1.2 mm; interslice distance: 1.2 mm; TR: 500 ms, TE: 8.1 ms;
flip angle: 90°; average: 2; matrix size: 128 × 128. The images were similarly
analysed as described above.
Biodistribution. The mice injected with the contrast agents were sacrificed 1 week
post-injection. Tissue samples were collected, weighed and digested by 1 mL
ultrapure nitric acid (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 7 days. The digested
sample (0.5 mL) was diluted to 5 mL with ultrapure water (Milli-Q, EMD
Millipore). The solution was centrifuged and filtered using a 0.45 µm filter and
the concentration of Gd(III) ions was determined using inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a 730-ES ICP-OES system
(Agilent Technologies). Samples were measured at three different wavelengths for
Gd at 336.224, 342.246 and 358.496 nm and the results were averaged across
wavelengths. Intensities were evaluated by ICP Expert II v. 2.0.2 software and
were related to the concentration by a calibration curve. A standard calibration
curve was developed from a blank and seven standards from a stock solution of
1000 ppm Gd in 3% nitric acid (Ricca Chemical Company, Arlington, TX, USA)
and diluted with 2% nitric acid.
In vitro transmetallation assay. We performed in vitro transmetallation
assay according to the protocol reported previously29. Briefly, ZD2-Gd3N@C80
(0.02 mM Gd/mL) was incubated with human serum for 2 h. According to previous
reports36, 37, transmetallation of Gd with Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ bound in serum
proteins occurs rapidly and 2 h is sufficient to study the equilibrium of transme-
tallation. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm and 25°C for 150 min
using CF-10 centrifugal filters (molecular weight cutoff 10 kDa). Metal ions in both
the upper reservoir and the filtrates were quantified by ICP-OES. Transmetallation
with Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ bound in serum proteins resulted in increase in free
Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ in the filtrates. The degree of transmetallation of
ZD2-Gd3N@C80 with Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ ions in serum was evaluated using the
percentage of Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ca2+ ions filtered through the membrane, calculated
as Transmetallation (%) = (concentration of ions in the filtrates)/(total ion
concentrations before filtration) × 100. Human serum was used a control.
Statistical analysis. All the experiments were performed in triplicates unless
stated otherwise. No estimation of sample sizes was performed. No randomisation
or blinding was used in animal studies. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m.
Analysis of differences between two groups was performed using Student’s t-test
assuming equal variance, and the difference was considered significant if P < 0.05.
