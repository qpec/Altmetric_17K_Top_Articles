STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal age at a daughter’s birth predict her subsequent probability of lifelong childlessness?
SUMMARY ANSWER: In this study population, women born to older mothers were more likely to be childless.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although maternal age at childbearing is increasing in many countries, there is limited evidence on
whether being born to older parents may influence offspring fertility.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE AND DURATION: This analysis included 43 135 women from the US-based Sister Study, a cohort study of
50 884 sisters of women with breast cancer recruited between 2003 and 2009.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants had no breast cancer at baseline. Women were included in the
analytic sample if they were born between 1930 and 1964 and were at least 44 years old at enrolment. Median age when reproductive his-
tory was last ascertained was 63.8 years. We estimated relative risks (RR) and 95% CI of lifelong childlessness as a function of maternal age
at birth, using multivariable log-binomial models, including total number of siblings, birth order, socioeconomic indicators of the family of ori-
gin, race and birth cohort. We examined the association in different subgroups and in a sibling-matched analysis including 802 sister pairs
discordant for childlessness.
MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: Compared with women born to 20–24-year-old mothers, those born to mothers aged
25–29, 30–34 and ≥35 years were more likely to be childless [RR (95% CI): 1.21 (1.14–1.29), 1.30 (1.22–1.39) and 1.40 (1.31–1.50),
respectively]. The association was consistent in strata defined by birth cohort, number of siblings, birth order, and participant’s educational
level, as well as within sister pairs. Overall, we found weak evidence for an independent contribution of paternal age at birth to the daughter’s
probability of childlessness.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: All participants had at least one sister, and all information was self-reported. We had no
knowledge of whether childlessness was intentional and found only a modest association between maternal age at birth and self-reported
indicators of infertility. Still, the association with childlessness was highly consistent.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDING: Given the widespread tendency to delay childbearing, evaluating the influence of maternal
age at birth on offspring fertility is a public health priority.

 Introduction
Since the 1970s, maternal age at first birth has been increasing in many
countries, resulting in rising rates of infertility and childlessness
(Schmidt et al., 2012; te Velde et al., 2012; Mathews and Hamilton,
2016; OECD, 2016). As more women conceive for the first time
when oocyte quality is declining, it is important to ascertain whether
being born to an older mother may negatively affect reproductive func-
tion. To date, relatively few studies have examined this question, with
mixed results. Studies of reconstructed families from Europe have sug-
gested that daughters of older mothers have lower fertility (Gillespie
et al., 2013; Smits et al., 2002) and a higher probability of childlessness
(Smits et al., 2002). In a study of Canadian women born in 1850–1899,
time from marriage to first birth was slightly (though not statistically
significantly) longer in daughters of younger and older mothers (Smits
et al., 1999); however, time to first birth was not associated with
maternal age ≥30 in British men and women born in 1958 (Joffe and
Barnes, 2000). In a registry-based Dutch study, individuals whose par-
ents were older when they first had a child were more likely to remain
childless (Steenhof and Liefbroer, 2008); however, only older paternal
age at birth predicted childlessness in a cohort of men and women
from Wisconsin (Fieder and Huber, 2015). Among women attending a
fertility clinic, those born to mothers aged ≥39 had a higher risk of
menstrual disorders (Smits et al., 1997). In a small study of infertile
patients and their fertile siblings, older maternal age predicted infertility
only in men (Tarín et al., 2001).
Although the observed intergenerational continuities in fertility
behaviour appear to be driven by parental transmission of socio-
economic status, education and values (Kolk, 2014; Liefbroer and
Elzinga, 2012), physiologic mechanisms may also play a role. The foetal
and early life environment can exert long-lasting effects on reproduct-
ive function (Ho et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2015; Sominsky et al., 2015;
Zambrano et al., 2014). Global expression profiles in human oocytes
vary with age (Steuerwald et al., 2007), and epigenetic alterations in
oocytes can persist in the next generation (Ge et al., 2015; Qian et al.,
2015). Epigenetic dysregulation may explain the higher risk of neurode-
velopmental disorders (Lee and McGrath, 2015; Sandin et al., 2012)
and childhood cancers (Johnson et al., 2009; Yip et al., 2006) in chil-
dren of older parents (Johnson et al., 2009; Perrin et al., 2010). In
infants, differential DNA methylation by maternal age has been
reported in two studies, although at different loci (Adkins et al., 2011;
Markunas et al., 2016).
In this article, we used data from the Sister Study to examine
whether daughters of older mothers were more likely to be childless,
taking into account several childhood and adult factors known to influ-
ence reproductive behaviour.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The Sister Study is a cohort study of 50 884 women from the US and Puerto
Rico, enroled between 2003 and 2009. Women were eligible to participate
if they were between 35 and 74 years old, had at least one full or half-sister
who had had breast cancer, and had not been diagnosed with breast cancer.
Participants answered an extensive set of questions through computer-
assisted interviews and self-administered questionnaires, including modules
about their family of origin, selected childhood exposures, reproductive
history, and past and current health conditions. Sister study participants are
followed at (approximately) regular intervals, whereupon information on
reproductive history, menopause and health status is updated. By design, all
participants in the study have at least one sister. More details on the study
are provided elsewhere (Sandler et al., in press). Women were eligible for
this analysis if they were at least 44 years old at enrolment (so that virtually
all would have complete reproductive histories), had been born between
1930 and 1964, and had not been adopted (to increase the likelihood that
they could report on their biological mother) (n = 44 792). We additionally
excluded 657 women who had not completed the questionnaire that cap-
tured family information, and 1000 because of missing data on other key
variables (Supplementary Fig. S1). The analytic sample consisted of 43 135
women (96.3% of eligible), including 3389 with at least one other sister in
the dataset. Sisters were matched based on full name and date of birth, per
the information provided by each participant. In some cases, women who
were not sisters may have been matched due to having a common name or
because of the extended algorithms allowing for minor discrepancies in spel-
ling or dates.
Childlessness was defined as not having had a live birth. Maternal age at
the participant’s birth (from now on referred to as maternal age at birth)
was reported in years by 92.4% of women and in 5-year categories by
4.1% (imputed as the mid-point of the category (n = 1748)). For the
remaining 3.5%, maternal age at birth was based on the mother’s year of
birth, estimated from her age at the time of the daughter’s interview (n =
476), or if she had died, from year of death and age at death, as reported
by the daughter (n = 1053).
The Sister Study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB)
of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National
Institutes of Health, and the Copernicus Group; this analysis was approved
by the IRB of McGill University Health Centre.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were carried out with Stata 14.2 (College Station, TX, USA).
We estimated relative risks (RR) and 95% CI using multivariable log-
binomial regression, with a robust variance estimator to account for the
correlation among sisters. We examined maternal age at birth as a cat-
egorical variable (<20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34 and 35+ years) and con-
sidered the following childhood predictors as covariates: total number of
siblings (both full and half siblings, born either before or after the partici-
pant), birth order (first, second or higher), indicators of socioeconomic
status during childhood (highest household education when the participant
was 13 and income level growing up, in categories), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and other), and 5-year birth
cohort. In one model, we included continuous paternal and maternal age
at birth; however, given the results and, especially, the high correlation
between maternal and paternal age (r = 0.79), we further considered
paternal age at birth only in a subanalysis (described in a later section).
After examining maternal age in a model including all women and all covari-
ates, we carried out several subgroup analyses: by birth cohort (1930–1944,
1945–1954 and 1955–1964), number of siblings (1, 2–3 and 4+), and birth
order (1, ≥2) (the latter two restricted to women from full-sibling families).
To evaluate whether our findings may have been confounded by parental
infertility, we performed a subanalysis among third- or later-born daughters of
mothers who had had their first child before age 24 (23 was the median age at
first birth among the participants’ mothers). We then examined the association
in strata defined by highest household education when the participant was 13.
After identifying characteristics that differed between women with and
without children, we evaluated whether maternal age at birth was asso-
ciated with never having legally married (this group does not include
women who reported that they were living as married), having obtained a
postgraduate degree, having unsuccessfully tried to conceive for longer
312

 than 1 year, and having ever taken fertility medications. Based on these
results, we carried out sensitivity analyses to assess whether the associ-
ation between maternal age at birth and childlessness persisted when
excluding women who had never married and when stratifying by the parti-
cipant’s education. We further evaluated whether having an older father,
relative to the mother, independently contributed to the probability of
childlessness (excluding those who had never married). Within each cat-
egory of maternal age, we divided father’s age into two groups, one includ-
ing the lowest 75% and the other including the highest 25%, thereby
generating a 10-level factor variable.
We checked our findings stratifying by daughters’ birth order (i.e. ignoring
brothers) and in two additional subgroups: (i) women who were at least 56
when reproductive history was last updated and had not received a diagnosis
of breast cancer through age 55 and (ii) women who had never married. In
two other models, we adjusted for factors that may have affected reproduct-
ive development: (i) prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and mater-
nal smoking during pregnancy (Palmer et al., 2001; Ye et al., 2010), and (ii)
feeding as an infant (breastfed or not and soy formula or not, with non-
mutually exclusive categories; Jefferson et al., 2012).
For all stratified analyses, which include different sets of covariates, we
show estimates (RR and 95% CI) and predictive marginal probabilities of
childlessness (in %, obtained with the margins command in Stata) only for
maternal age at birth.
Finally, to better account for family factors shared among sisters, we
used conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between
mother’s age at birth and childless in 802 pairs of sisters from full sibling
families, after excluding 24 pairs because of inconsistencies in number of
siblings or mother’s age within pairs.

Maternal age at birth and daughters’ childlessness
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/33/2/311/4685990 by guest on 03 June 2019
 Results
Median age at recruitment in the analysis sample was 56.9 years.
Reproductive history was updated in at least one follow-up interview
for 99.5% of the women; median age at the latest update was 63.8
(interquartile range: 58.2–70.0; 98% were 50 or older). In total, 7656
women (17.8%) had not had a live birth. Table I shows the characteris-
tics of participants by maternal age at birth. Women born to the
youngest mothers were more frequently the firstborn, less frequently
non-Hispanic White, and more likely to be from less educated and
poorer families. Women born to the oldest mothers were rarely the
firstborn, had more siblings, and came from families from both the
lowest and highest educational and income levels.
Table II shows the results of the multivariable model including all
women in the analytic sample. Maternal age at birth was positively
associated with subsequent daughter’s childlessness. Firstborn daugh-
ters and those born in families with higher parental education were
also more likely to not have children, while having more siblings was
associated with a lower likelihood of being childless. There was a
strong birth cohort effect, with the probability of childlessness increas-
ing rapidly across birth years beginning in the 1940s. When maternal
and paternal age at the daughter’s birth were included as linear terms
in a model including the same predictors shown in Table II, the RR for
a 1-year increase was 1.016 (95% CI: 1.010–1.021) for mother’s age
and 1.006 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.010) for father’s age. (Paternal age was
further considered only in a subanalysis.)
Figure 1 shows that the association between maternal age and child-
lessness was consistent across birth cohorts, and in strata based on
number of siblings and birth order. The association persisted after
restricting the analysis to third or higher order daughters born to
mothers who had had their first child before age 24, i.e. in women
whose parents likely had no fertility problems (right panel, last model).
Stratifying by highest household education when the participant was
13 yielded similar findings (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Compared with women who had had at least one child, those who
had none were substantially more likely to have obtained a postgradu-
ate degree (36.8 versus 21.7%), to never have married (22.4 versus
1%), and to self-report as homosexual (5.3 versus 0.3%). They were
also more likely to report having taken fertility medications (9.7 versus
6.4%) and having attempted to conceive for >1 year without success
(17.3 versus 10.4%; however, 8% of women did not take part in the
follow-up interview in which this question was asked, and 5% of those
who participated did not answer the question). More childless women
reported having been (definitely or probably) prenatally exposed to
diethylstilsbestrol (DES) (3.8 versus 2.1%; this information was missing
for 15%). There were no differences in household income in the year
prior to enrolment (Supplementary Table SI).
Having been born to a mother ≥25 years was associated with a high-
er probability of never having married (although the absolute risk was
low) and of having obtained a postgraduate degree (Supplementary
Fig. S3, left). However, older maternal age at the daughter’s birth
was not associated with having unsuccessfully tried to conceive for
longer than 1 year and only weakly with having taken fertility drugs
(Supplementary Fig. S3, right; the latter analysis was restricted to
women born after 1944).
Although being born to an older mother predicted both never hav-
ing married and having achieved a higher education, these factors did
not explain the association between maternal age at birth and daugh-
ter’s childlessness (Fig. 2). Given maternal age, the evidence for an
additional effect of paternal age at birth was weak.
We checked whether the daughter’s birth order (i.e. ignoring broth-
ers) may have affected her reproductive behaviour (as, for example,
youngest daughters may have been more likely to be the ones taking
care of older parents and consequently delay starting a family). The

 association between maternal age at birth ≥35 and childlessness was
attenuated in middle daughters (Fig. 3), who, in general, were less likely
to be childless. Unsurprisingly, middle daughters had overall more sib-
lings (median: 4, 25th and 75th percentiles: 3 and 6) than oldest and
youngest ones (median: 3, 25th and 75th percentiles: 2 and 4 in both
groups). The proportion of women ≥35 who went on to have two or
more children after the participant’s birth was 18.2% among mothers
of middle daughters, versus 13.1 and 2.7% among mothers of oldest
and youngest daughters, respectively.
The final sensitivity analyses are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.
Results were virtually unchanged when we restricted the analysis to
women whose reproductive history was updated at age 56 or later and
had no breast cancer diagnosis through age 55. Maternal age at birth was
associated with childlessness even in women who had never married,
despite the fact that, in this group, 82.3% had no children. Adjusting for
prenatal exposure to DES and maternal smoking, or for having been
breastfed or given soy formula as an infant did not affect the estimates.
Prenatal exposure to DES was associated with a higher probability of
childlessness (RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.49); women who had been
breastfed were slightly more likely to be childless (RR: 1.05, 95: CI:
1.00–1.10). Maternal smoking during pregnancy and having been fed
soy formula were not associated with childlessness (but only 2.6% of
women with non-missing information reported exposure to the latter).
The sibling analysis, based on 802 sister pairs discordant for child-
lessness, suggested that the odds of childlessness increased with
increasing maternal age at birth (P = 0.0013) (Supplementary
Table SII). To check whether this association was driven by siblings
born several years apart (i.e. potentially confounded by birth cohort
effects), we restricted the analysis to pairs born within 5 years of each
other. Although the precision of the estimates diminished consider-
ably, the trend remained (Supplementary Table SIII).
Discussion
In this study, women born to older mothers were substantially more
likely to be childless. The estimated associations were consistent, on

Maternal age at birth and daughters’ childlessness

 the relative scale, across birth cohorts and in strata defined by number
of siblings and birth order, despite differences in the absolute probabil-
ity of childlessness. The association persisted after accounting for not
having married and for education, known predictors of childlessness
(Hayford, 2013), and after controlling for shared family factors.
In mice, older maternal age has been associated with placental mor-
phological abnormalities and delayed offspring development (Lopes
et al., 2009). Pups conceived by older dams and transferred into
younger ones at the blastocyst stage had altered growth and impaired
cardiometabolic health in the postnatal period (Velazquez et al., 2016).
Among mice nurtured by 3-month old foster mothers, hippocampal
gene expression and behaviour differed in those born to 18-month old
mothers, compared with same-age mice born to 3-month old mothers
(Sampino et al., 2017).
Evidence of reduced lifetime reproductive success in offspring of old-
er mothers has been observed in two species of birds (Bouwhuis et al.,
2015; Schroeder et al., 2015). In humans, daughters of older mothers
have been found to have fewer children or a higher probability of
remaining childless in some (Gillespie et al., 2013; Smits et al., 2002;
Steenhof and Liefbroer, 2008) but not all (Fieder and Huber, 2015),
studies.
The mechanisms by which mother’s age at conception and during
pregnancy may physiologically influence the daughter’s reproductive
function are unknown; however, older age is associated with differen-
tial gene expression in oocytes (Steuerwald et al., 2007) and may affect
the offspring epigenome (Adkins et al., 2011; Markunas et al., 2016).
The loci reported as having differential methylation patterns in the first
of these studies (Adkins et al., 2011) have not been further corrobo-
rated, but the negative correlation between maternal age at daughter’s
birth and methylation at four CPG sites of KLHL35 found in the later
study was replicated in two independent populations (including a sub-
sample of women from the Sister Study) (Markunas et al., 2016).
As we found no association between older maternal age at birth and
daughters’ reports of trying to conceive for longer than one year, and
only a weak association with use of fertility drugs, our data provide lim-
ited support for a mechanism acting directly on fecundity. Reproduction
is influenced by social, cultural and biological factors. DNA methylation
can influence behaviour and is reportedly sensitive to early-life

 environmental inputs (Roth, 2013); it is possible that such inputs differ
systematically in daughters of older mothers. The available evidence sug-
gests a genetic influence on fecundity, duration of reproductive life and
behaviours associated with fertility (Bentzen et al., 2013; Hartge, 2009;
Kohler et al., 1999; McCoy et al., 2015). Although higher underlying
fecundity may explain the lower probability of childlessness among mid-
dle daughters born to older mothers, taken together, our results raise
doubts that genetic and socioeconomic factors can entirely explain the
observed association.
The main strengths of this study are the large sample size and the
wealth of information on childhood and adult characteristics of partici-
pants, which enabled us to examine different subgroups with adequate
power. In addition, ~98% of the women in the analytic sample were
50 years or older (and all were at least 44) at the latest follow-up,
allowing us to capture completed reproductive histories. Several lim-
itations should also be noted. We had no information on whether
childlessness was voluntary, and our indicators of clinical infertility
were limited. Participants were mostly White and highly educated;
consequently, the associations may be different in other populations.
All information was self-reported and thus subject to error, particularly
for information from the participants’ childhood, and possibly for
maternal age at birth. Still, differential errors by childlessness seem
unlikely. A proportion of women linked as being sisters in the data
may not have been related, potentially resulting in artificially wider
confidence intervals, as we accounted for clustering in the analysis.
Inclusion of unrelated women in the sibling analysis would also result in
loss of power. However, we included only pairs with consistent
reports of maternal age and number of siblings within pairs, factors
that had not been considered in the algorithms used to match putative
sisters. By design, this study excluded women who had no siblings and
those who had only brothers; furthermore, the fact that all study parti-
cipants had at least one sister (or half-sister) resulted in the sex ratio
of siblings being skewed towards females (1.45:1). Although it has
been suggested that having older siblings of the same sex may be asso-
ciated with lower reproductive fitness (Gillespie et al., 2013; Nitsch
et al., 2013), we saw no evidence of such a phenomenon in this popu-
lation (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In sum, we observed a strong positive correlation between maternal
age at birth and daughter’s childlessness, remarkably consistent across
various subgroups and within sisters. Whether our results are due to

to delay childbearing. If these findings are replicated in other popula-
