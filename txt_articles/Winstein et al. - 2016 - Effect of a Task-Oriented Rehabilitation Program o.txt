Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Clinical trials suggest that higher doses of task-oriented training are superior to 
current clinical practice for patients with stroke with upper extremity motor deficits.
OBJECTIVE—To compare the efficacy of a structured, task-oriented motor training program vs 
usual and customary occupational therapy (UCC) during stroke rehabilitation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Phase 3, pragmatic, single-blind randomized 
trial among 361 participants with moderate motor impairment recruited from 7 US hospitals over 
44 months, treated in the outpatient setting from June 2009 to March 2014.
INTERVENTIONS—Structured, task-oriented upper extremity training (Accelerated Skill 
Acquisition Program[ASAP]; n = 119); dose-equivalent occupational therapy (DEUCC; n = 120); 
or monitoring-only occupational therapy (UCC; n = 122). The DEUCC group was prescribed 30

 one-hour sessions over 10 weeks; the UCC group was only monitored, without specification of 
dose.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was 12-month change in log-
transformed Wolf Motor Function Test time score (WMFT, consisting of a mean of 15 timed arm 
movements and hand dexterity tasks). Secondary outcomes were change in WMFT time score 
(minimal clinically important difference [MCID] = 19 seconds) and proportion of patients 
improving ≥25 points on the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) hand function score (MCID = 17.8 points).
RESULTS—Among the 361 randomized patients (mean age, 60.7 years; 56% men; 42% African 
American; mean time since stroke onset, 46 days), 304 (84%) completed the 12-month primary 
outcome assessment; in intention-to-treat analysis, mean group change scores (log WMFT, 
baseline to 12 months) were, for the ASAP group, 2.2 to 1.4 (difference, 0.82); DEUCC group, 2.0 
to 1.2 (difference, 0.84); and UCC group, 2.1 to 1.4 (difference, 0.75), with no significant 
between-group differences (ASAP vs DEUCC:0.14; 95% CI, −0.05 to 0.33; P = .16; ASAP vs 
UCC: −0.01; 95% CI, −0.22 to 0.21; P = .94; and DEUCC vs UCC: −0.14; 95% CI, −0.32 to 0.05; 
P = .15). Secondary outcomes for the ASAP group were WMFT change score, −8.8 seconds, and 
improved SIS, 73%; DEUCC group, WMFT, −8.1 seconds, and SIS, 72%; and UCC group, 
WMFT, −7.2 seconds, and SIS, 69%, with no significant pairwise between-group differences 
(ASAP vs DEUCC: WMFT, 1.8 seconds; 95% CI, −0.8 to 4.5 seconds; P = .18; improved SIS, 
1%; 95% CI, −12% to 13%; P = .54; ASAP vs UCC: WMFT, −0.6 seconds, 95% CI, −3.8 to 2.6 
seconds; P = .72; improved SIS, 4%; 95% CI, −9% to 16%; P = .48; and DEUCC vs UCC: 
WMFT, −2.1 seconds; 95% CI, −4.5 to 0.3 seconds; P = .08; improved SIS, 3%; 95% CI, −9% to 
15%; P = .22). A total of 168 serious adverse events occurred in 109 participants, resulting in 8 
patients withdrawing from the study.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among patients with motor stroke and primarily 
moderate upper extremity impairment, use of a structured, task-oriented rehabilitation program did 
not significantly improve motor function or recovery beyond either an equivalent or a lower dose 
of UCC upper extremity rehabilitation. These findings do not support superiority of this program 
among patients with motor stroke and primarily moderate upper extremity impairment.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00871715
Clinicians providing care for patients with stroke lack evidence for determining the best type 
and amount of motor therapy during outpatient rehabilitation. Notwithstanding the 
considerable resources devoted to stroke rehabilitation care, a recent Cochrane review of 
interventions for improving upper limb function after stroke concluded that high-quality 
evidence for the superiority of any current routinely practiced intervention is absent, 
including the amount and content of motor training.1
Two large rehabilitation trials performed in the long-term phase of stroke, after initial 
rehabilitation had been completed, suggested that intensive, high-repetition, task-oriented 
training was superior to usual care for improving upper extremity motor outcomes.2,3 With 
rehabilitation training implemented after spontaneous recovery, improvements can be 
attributed more directly to the training. Even though the rehabilitation interventions differed 
in these studies (constraint-induced movement therapy3 and robot-assisted training2), both 
incorporated the same principles of high movement repetitions and structured task-oriented

 practice. Despite this evidence and expert opinion that more practice enhances recovery, 
these findings have not been incorporated into clinical practice when patients with stroke 
actually receive rehabilitation therapy. Typical outpatient treatment sessions last 36 minutes, 
during which patients engage in an average of only 12 purposeful actions within an 
otherwise unstructured treatment session.4
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Comprehensive Arm Rehabilitation Evaluation (ICARE) 
was to test the efficacy of the same task-oriented approaches during the outpatient phase of 
rehabilitation, which typically begins within a month after stroke occurrence. ICARE 
compared 2 different treatment strategies (intensive, high-repetition, task-oriented training 
vs unstructured occupational therapy at 2 different doses: 30 hours vs a lower-dose, 
observation-only control) among patients undergoing outpatient rehabilitation for moderate 
arm motor impairment after stroke.
Methods
Study Oversight and Trial Design
A motor rehabilitation trial precludes double-blinding; participants were aware of their 
group assignment. The protocol and design for this phase 3, parallel, 3-group, single-blind, 
randomized clinical trial are provided in Supplement 1 and were detailed in the ICARE 
methods article.5 Following institutional review board approvals at each site, participants 
provided written informed consent. A data and safety monitoring board and medical monitor 
provided independent oversight. Study biostatisticians with full access to deidentified data 
managed the statistical analyses with consultation from a blinded statistician. The statistical 
analysis plan (Supplement 1) was developed and sample size estimations were performed 
during proposal development and approved by the data and safety monitoring board and the 
sponsor.
Study Population, Screening, and Randomization
Patients with moderate upper extremity motor impairment who demonstrated at least 
minimal initiation of hand and finger extension and who could participate in an intense but 
distributed rehabilitation program were recruited. To preclude severe cognitive and sensory 
impairments, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale subscale scores for neglect and 
sensory impairment were used, thus allowing focus on upper extremity motor recovery. Per 
sponsor mandate, race and ethnicity were self-selected from categories determined in 1997 
by the US Office of Management and Budget.
Participants were recruited from 7 sites, predominantly during inpatient rehabilitation. Early 
in recruitment, the randomization window was amended from 30 to 90 days to 14 to 106 
days after stroke, enabling randomization 16 days earlier and necessitating a 16-day 
extension to retain the stratification midpoint. Full eligibility criteria are provided in eTable 
1 in Supplement 2. An abbreviated list of inclusion criteria includes age older than 21 years; 
ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke meeting World Health Organization criteria6; upper 
extremity hemiparesis; voluntary finger extension; no more than 6 outpatient occupational 
therapy sessions; and absence of traumatic or nonvascular brain injury and subarachnoid or

 primary intraventricular hemorrhage. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment 
groups. Intervention was completed within 16 weeks of randomization. A stratified block 
randomization scheme within sites balanced assignment by motor severity and time from 
stroke onset. The biostatistician performed randomization using hybrid block sizes of 3 or 6, 
depending on anticipated sample size within each site. Once a participant provided informed 
consent and the baseline assessment was completed, the study site requested randomization; 
the data manager confirmed eligibility and the site team leader was notified of the 
assignment.
Treatment Interventions
An overview of the interventions in each treatment group is shown in eTable 2 in 
Supplement 2. The investigational intervention, a structured, task-oriented upper extremity 
motor training program, termed the Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP), is a 
best-practice synthesis implementing neuroscientific evidence regarding motor training 
approaches and schedules. This program is principle based, impairment focused,7 task 
specific,3 intense,4 engaging, collaborative, self-directed,8,9 and patient centered10; it has 
been previously described and feasibility tested.5,8,9,11–14 The ASAP intervention included 
an initial evaluation and 30 one-hour treatment sessions (3 times per week for 10 weeks). A 
constraint or mitt worn on the less affected hand was available but not mandated. Purposeful 
and skilled movement execution was emphasized. Support for patients’ control or autonomy 
was provided by choices of specific tasks to be practiced, collaborative problem solving to 
identify and address movement needs, and encouragement of self-direction in extending 
practice to community contexts.5,8
The monitoring-only usual and customary care (UCC) and dose-equivalent usual and 
customary care (DEUCC) therapy groups received outpatient occupational therapy based on 
usual and customary practice as determined by the therapist(s), local practices, payer 
guidelines, and participant preferences. These groups differed only by the number of 
sessions of outpatient therapy. For the DEUCC group, study-related treatment prescribed 30 
hours of outpatient therapy. Treatment adherence for the dose-equivalent groups was set at 
27 hours or more. The UCC group was only monitored, without specification of dose.
To prevent contamination of treatment across groups, at each site, the DEUCC and UCC 
therapies were delivered by different clinicians situated in separate locations from the 
investigational intervention. The ASAP Manual of Procedures was embargoed during the 
trial5; it included a formal standardization process. All ASAP therapists signed 
nondisclosure agreements.
Outcome Assessment
Participants were assessed at baseline (prerandomization), post-intervention (end of 
therapy), 6 months, and 12 months (end of study) after randomization by clinicians masked 
to treatment assignment and standardized in administration of primary and secondary 
outcome assessments.5 A 12-monthchange in the log-transformed Wolf Motor Function Test 
(WMFT) time score was the primary outcome. The WMFT time score is a mean of 15 
hierarchically arranged timed arm movements and hand dexterity tasks.15–18 If a task could

 not be completed in 2 minutes (ie, 120 seconds), a time score of 121 seconds was assigned. 
A log transformation is used to accommodate for the nonnormality in the raw time score.
Secondary outcomes included the 12-month change in WMFT time score (minimum 
clinically important difference, 19 seconds faster, 16% of the range on the dominant side 
and unknown on the nondominant side19) and improvement in participant- reported Stroke 
Impact Scale (SIS), version 3.0, hand subscale score (percentage with improvement ≥25 
points). Because the SIS hand function range is 0 to 100 points, participants with SIS hand 
function scores of 75 or higher at baseline (n = 15) were excluded from this analysis. The 
minimal detectable change and minimal clinically important difference for the SIS hand 
function subscale are 25.9 points and 17.8 points, respectively.20 The primary end point was 
the end of study (12 months after randomization; mean, 13.5 months after stroke), while end 
of therapy (16 weeks after randomization; mean, approximately 22 weeks after stroke) was a 
secondary end point.
Patients (or their designated representatives or caregivers) were contacted by monthly 
telephone calls to review health status, health care utilization, medications, and adverse 
events. Adverse events were reported regarding 3 independent characteristics: expectedness, 
relation to study, and severity.5
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics and outcomes, attrition, adherence, and adverse events were 
compared across groups. Data distribution assumptions were assessed and data 
transformations made as necessary. All analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat 
principle, comparing outcomes by assigned group. Data were analyzed for patterns of 
missing data; because no pattern was found, Markov chain Monte Carlo imputation was 
used to account for missing data from loss to follow-up or missed evaluations at end of 
study. Complete case analyses were also performed, although there were no differences in 
results, so we report the planned intention-to-treat results with multiple imputation herein. 
Changes from baseline in continuous outcomes were analyzed using analysis-of-covariance 
models adjusting for baseline values and stratification factors (site, severity, time since 
onset). For the primary outcome, a 2-sided P < .05 was used to indicate a difference between 
the ASAP intervention and DEUCC therapy. To adjust for multiple comparisons in 
secondary aims (DEUCC vs UCC and ASAP vs UCC), a 2-sided P < .025 was used. Per the 
protocol, the proportion of participants who improved 25 points or more on the SIS hand 
subscale, that which exceeds a clinically important change20 and would represent at least a 
full category of difficulty improvement (eg, from “very difficult” to “somewhat difficult”), 
was also examined. This outcome was evaluated using logistic regression models.
Analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). In addition to 
data checks before analyses, residuals for the total group and by group were examined to 
ensure that model assumptions were met. Besides means and confidence intervals, effect 
size (Cohen d) was computed to determine the magnitude of effects. This effect size was 
calculated as the between-group difference in outcome variable mean divided by the 
common standard deviation of the outcome variable21; confidence intervals for d were

 estimated as described by computing the 95% confidence intervals for the noncentrality 
distribution from the t test of group differences.22
Sample size calculations were performed during ICARE proposal development to ensure 
sufficient power to detect a difference in log-transformed WMFT at 12 months between the 
ASAP and DEUCC groups at a significance level of .05 and 80% power. Given the 
population being recruited and the relatively short duration of time from stroke occurrence 
to enrollment in ICARE, the primary outcome group differences were expected to be 
between those found in EXCITE3 and VECTORS.23 EXCITE resulted in d = 0.50 for log-
transformed WMFT between the high-functioning and the delayed intervention (control) 
groups and d = 0.63 between the low-functioning and the delayed intervention groups. For 
EXCITE, there was a 26% change in the control group (from baseline to 1 year) for the 
primary outcome. VECTORS resulted in a smaller effect between the high-dose and control 
groups (d = 0.20) for the Action Research Arm Test,24 although the variance of the effect 
was higher for VECTORS (inpatient acute) than EXCITE (outpatient subacute). For 
VECTORS, there was a 77% change in the control group (from baseline to 90 days) for the 
Action Research Arm Test.
For ICARE, the DEUCC group was estimated to demonstrate a proportional recovery of 
approximately 50% on the primary outcome (midway between the 26% in EXCITE and the 
77% in VECTORS); thus, the effect size for power was set at d = 0.42. With this effect, 
using a 2-sided t test with a type I error of .05 and 80% power, at least 90 patients per group 
would need to be evaluable. With an expected attrition rate of 25%, 120 patients per group 
was the planned sample size. The secondary outcome measure was the success rate in the 
SIS hand subscale score, defined as the proportion of patients with a change of 25 points or 
higher out of 100 on the normalized SIS hand at end of study. Given the estimates for SIS 
hand function subscale change from acute (VECTORS, 46% [n = 13]), postacute (Kansas 
City home-based exercise study,25 35% [n = 71]), and subacute (EXCITE, 24% [n = 86]) 
control data, if the DEUCC group success rate was greater than in EXCITE, less than in 
VECTORS, and comparable with that of the Kansas City study, then ICARE was powered 
sufficiently to detect a minimum of 21% difference between groups.
Results
Study Participants and Baseline Characteristics
From June 2009 through February 2013, 11 051 patients were screened. Given the need for 
participants to remain in the trial, the most frequent reason for exclusion at chart screening 
was the clinician’s best judgment about the likelihood of the patient completing the study 
(44%), which included consideration of social instability, inability to travel for study-related 
procedures, and concomitant illness. The second most frequent reason for exclusion was no 
diagnosis of stroke (19.5%). During clinical screening, other exclusions included possible 
dementia (11.4%), upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) motor score too high (11.3%), and 
clinician’s best judgment (10.9%). See Figure 1 for participant flow through the study.
Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics. Mean age of the participants was 60.7 (SD, 
12.5) years; 56% were men and 42% were African American. The 2 largest sites (Atlanta,

 Georgia, and Washington, DC) were urban Stroke Belt hospitals.26 At randomization, the 
mean number of days since stroke was 45.8 (SD, 22.4). Eighty-three percent experienced an 
ischemic stroke without hemorrhagic conversion; 43% affected the left hemisphere; 48% 
affected the right hemisphere; and 7% affected the brain stem. The stroke affected the 
dominant upper extremity in 49% of the sample. Sixty-eight percent of participants 
underwent inpatient rehabilitation and 18% were referred directly from acute care. Fifty-
seven percent were in the less severe (UEFM score ≥36), early-onset (<60 days) stratum, 
with 19% in the next most common stratum of more severe (UEFM score <36), early onset. 
A median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 4 (interquartile range, 2–5) was 
consistent with a study population with primarily motor hemiparesis without substantial 
cognitive or sensory impairment. The overall mean UEFM motor impairment score of 41.6 
(95% CI, 40.7–42.6) for the entire sample was in the moderately severe range of 21 to 50; 
78% were within this range at baseline and 21% were classified with mild impairment (>50). 
The baseline mean WMFT time score was 14.9 (95% CI, 12.9–16.8) seconds. Twenty-nine 
percent of participants had received some outpatient occupational therapy prior to 
randomization, though none received more than 6 hours.
Attrition Rate and Treatment Adherence
A total of 304 patients (84%) completed the 12-month evaluation (87% in the ASAP, 88% 
in the DEUCC, and 79% in the UCC groups; P = .09 for difference in primary end-point 
attrition).
Treatment adherence for the dose-equivalent groups, defined as completion of at least 27 
treatment hours, was comparable across the groups at 79% for the ASAP intervention and 
74% for DEUCC participants. The mean number of treatment visits per week in the ASAP 
group was 2.4 (95% CI, 2.3–2.5) vs 2.1 (95% CI, 2.0–2.2) in the DEUCC group. The mean 
number of hours of treatment received was 28.3 (95% CI, 27.1–29.5) and 26.7 (95% CI, 
25.3–28.1) for the ASAP and DEUCC groups, respectively. In the UCC group, 81%(99/122) 
reported receiving some upper extremity therapy; the mean treatment time per week was 1.7 
hours (95% CI, 1.5–1.9 hours). The UCC group completed a mean of 11.2 (95% CI, 9.5–
12.9) total hours of treatment that varied widely (range, 0–46 hours; see the eFigure in 
Supplement 2 for details). Monitoring of health and adverse events via monthly telephone 
calls was comparable across groups. There was an overall 54% improvement in mean motor 
performance as measured by the WMFT time score, and 71% (215/302) of participants met 
or exceeded a meaningful change in the SIS hand subscale score (≥25 points at the primary 
end point). In 7 (0.8%) of the 898 follow-up evaluation sessions, the assessor was unblinded 
to group assignment.
Primary Outcome
At the end of the study, the mean times for lnWMFT were as follows: for ASAP, 1.4; 
DEUCC, 1.2; and UCC, 1.3 (Table 2 and Figure 2). The differences in lnWMFT change 
between groups at the end of the study (12 months) were small (eTable 3 in Supplement 2): 
for ASAP vs DEUCC, the mean difference was 0.14 (95% CI, −0.05 to 0.33; P = .16); for 
ASAP vs UCC,−0.01 (95% CI, −0.22 to 0.21; P = .94); and for DEUCC vs UCC, −0.14 
(95% CI, −0.32 to 0.05; P = .15); in raw seconds, these differences ranged from 0.5 to 2

 seconds. Associated effect sizes of group pair differences were small. The Cohen d was 0.15 
(95% CI,−0.30 to 0.21) for the primary pairwise comparison of ASAP vs DEUCC; for the 
secondary pairwise comparisons, d = −0.01 (95% CI, −0.26 to 0.24) for DEUCC vs UCC 
and d = −0.10 (95% CI, −0.15 to 0.36) for ASAP vs UCC (see eTable 3 in Supplement 2 for 
end-of-therapy and end-of study pairwise group comparison effect sizes).
Secondary Outcomes
For all participants, the baseline mean WMFT time score was 14.9 (95% CI, 12.9–16.8) 
seconds. At the end of the study, the mean time score had improved to 6.8 (95% CI, 5.3–8.3) 
seconds but was still slower than the age-matched normative mean time of 1.3 seconds,18 
indicating persistent motor impairment. All groups showed comparable improvements in 
WMFT times of 7 to 8 seconds, adjusted for baseline and covariates; by group, WMFT 
mean times improved; ie, for ASAP, 8.8 seconds, for DEUCC, 8.1 seconds, and for UCC, 
7.2 seconds. Between- group changes were not significantly different: for ASAP vs 
DEUCC, the mean difference was 1.81 (95% CI, −0.83 to 4.45) seconds (P = .18); for 
ASAP vs UCC, −0.59 (95% CI, −3.77 to 2.60) seconds (P = .72); and for DEUCC vs UCC, 
−2.12 (95% CI, −4.52 to 0.27) seconds (P = .08).
Hand function improvement of more than 25 points on the SIS subscale at the end of the 
study was 73%(72/99) in the ASAP group, 72% (75/104) in the DEUCC group, and 
69%(68/99) in the UCC group; none of the group pairwise comparisons were significant 
(P>.21) (Table 2). Differences in mean changes were 0.6 (95% CI, −6.4 to 6.5; P = .99) for 
ASAP vs DEUCC, 2.6 (−3.8 to 9.0; P = .42) for ASAP vs UCC, and 2.1 (95% CI, −4.0 to 
8.3; P = .49) for DEUCC vs UCC. Thirty-six percent of participants had less than complete 
recovery (<100 points), despite improvement beyond a clinically meaningful amount (mean, 
36 points; 95% CI, 34–40 points) by the end of the study.
Safety
There were no significant differences across groups in number of serious adverse events 
whether on or off site, expected, or study related, when either treating each event as separate 
or accounting for repeated observations within individuals (all P>.40). There were 168 
serious adverse events involving 109 participants; the most common were hospitalization (n 
= 143; 85% of adverse events; 25% of randomized participants) and recurrent stroke (n = 
42; 25% of adverse events; 9% of randomized participants). Two of the serious events were 
deemed related to the intervention, one from hypertension and the other from a wrist 
fracture.
Discussion
Among participants with primarily moderate upper extremity motor impairment after stroke, 
there were no group differences in upper extremity motor performance at 12 months after 
randomization with a structured, task-oriented motor training program compared with UCC 
occupational therapy during outpatient rehabilitation. Specifically, the structured, task-
oriented motor therapy was not superior to usual outpatient occupational therapy for the 
same number of hours, showing no benefit for an evidence-based, intensive, restorative

 therapy program. In addition, there was no advantage to providing more than twice the mean 
dose (mean, 27 hours) of therapy compared with the average 11 hours received by the 
observation-only group, showing that substantially more therapy time was not associated 
with additional motor restoration. With payer pressures on reducing inpatient rehabilitation, 
outpatient rehabilitation may be of greater importance for patients with stroke. The findings 
from this study provide important new guidance to clinicians who must choose the best 
treatment for patients with stroke. The results suggest that usual and customary community-
based therapy, provided during the typical outpatient rehabilitation time window by licensed 
therapists, improves upper extremity motor function and that more than doubling the dose of 
therapy does not lead to meaningful differences in motor outcomes.
However, these results cannot be assumed to generalize to other outcomes (eg, health-
related quality of life, community participation), other stroke-related impairments such as 
walking,27 other stroke populations, or rehabilitation time points earlier or later following 
stroke than those studied here. Moreover, the lack of difference between dose groups may be 
a measurement artifact. Although the mean dose of therapy for the DEUCC group was more 
than twice that of the UCC group, the latter group had considerable variation in actual dose 
(ie, a range of 0–46 hours). Thus, mean differences may misrepresent the actual differences 
between groups. This variability in the observation-only group was not unexpected and was 
suggested by pretrial survey data (Supplement 1). Post hoc exploratory analysis found no 
systematic relationship between dose of usual therapy and magnitude of change in WMFT 
time scores, similar to results from secondary outcomes of the EXCITE trial,28 even though 
variability in dose across patients was much lower in EXCITE than in ICARE.
The ICARE results support the necessity of well-designed dose-response studies of motor 
training at key clinical time points after stroke, including the periods of inpatient and 
outpatient care and the long-term period beyond a year after stroke. Different physiological 
and psychological responses to rehabilitation training might occur at different times after 
stroke onset,29 raising the possibility that dosing and timing are not independent factors in 
stroke rehabilitation intervention trials. This observation could explain why trials conducted 
early after stroke (eg, AVERT30 and VECTORS23) found undesirable effects of more 
intensive interventions, whereas the EXCITE trial,3 conducted later after stroke, found a 
positive effect. ICARE, timed in between, found no dose effect. This time window 
hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for why the results from ICARE are consistent 
with previous studies of therapy dosing that did not find large dose effects31,32 but also are 
inconsistent with other findings in which a high dose of task-oriented training, as in 
EXCITE, was shown to be more effective compared with the control group when the dose of 
outpatient therapy varied considerably. Future trials in rehabilitation should use designs and 
methods that consider the natural recovery transpiring during the early period after stroke33 
as well as the degree of neurological severity and disability.
The data pertaining to dose of rehabilitation therapy may be important to policy makers and 
may be useful to estimate the cost and expected effect of aftercare in the outpatient setting. 
Future neurorehabilitation trials should include physiological and psychosocial domains and 
use designs that directly test hypothesized mechanisms of action.34 This consideration may

 include choosing primary outcomes that are sensitive to participation and quality of life and 
are consistent with patient-centered aspects of health care reform.35
ICARE has several limitations related to the disadvantages that are typical of pragmatic 
trials of patient-centered treatment decisions. Several consequences resulted from choosing 
an experimental treatment in the context of current practice.
First, spontaneous recovery may have been greater than any treatment effect. Within 6 to 10 
weeks after stroke, time from stroke occurrence is independently associated with 
spontaneous recovery of impairments and activities, explaining 16% to 42% of the observed 
improvements.33 Previous upper extremity stroke rehabilitation trials (ie, EXCITE and VA 
Robotics)2,3 were performed later after stroke occurrence, after the early recovery had 
plateaued and when rehabilitation is typically no longer prescribed.
Second, differences in the dose of rehabilitation therapy in the ICARE trial may have been 
insufficient despite being considerably more than what was reported previously4 and 
consistent with reports of modified schedules of constraint-induced movement therapy that 
were shown to be effective.36–38 A different treatment schedule (for example, the same 
number of hours delivered over a shorter period) might have been more effective. Time on 
task was not measured in this study, and information about the content of usual therapy was 
limited and dependent onsite-specific clinical documentation and procedural billing codes 
(eg, Current Procedural Terminology codes); these choices were necessary for study 
completion.
Third, the use of standard care as a control group in this pragmatic trial imposes limitations, 
particularly when testing a nonpharmacological intervention. Usual outpatient upper 
extremity therapy may have evolved over time to resemble the investigational intervention, 
by following evidence-based guidelines. Continuing education, increased attention to 
practice guidelines,39,40 awareness of the ongoing ICARE trial,41 and site (partner or 
affiliate of nearby academic medical center) may have influenced usual care practices. This 
limitation is inherent to pragmatic trial designs; for ICARE, both usual therapy groups 
represented a relatively high standard of outpatient practice.
Conclusions
Among patients with motor stroke and primarily moderate upper extremity impairment, the 
use of a structured, task-oriented rehabilitation program, compared with an equivalent dose 
of customary occupational therapy or with usual and customary occupational therapy, did 
not significantly improve motor function or recovery after 12 months. These findings do not 
support superiority of this task-oriented rehabilitation program for patients with motor stroke 
and moderate upper extremity impairment.

ASAP indicates Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program; DEUCC, dose-equivalent usual and 
customary care; UCC, monitoring-only usual and customary care. Reasons for exclusion are 
not exclusive. Adherence in the ASAP and DEUCC was defined as 27 hours or more of 
prescribed treatment; there was no adherence data collected for the UCC group. The study 
was designed with an estimated a priori attrition rate of 25%; actual attrition rates by group 
were considerably lower, ranging from 9% to 16% across groups. Attrition rate of 
withdrawal across groups was not statistically significant (P = .24). Evaluable data at 12 
months ranged from 79% to 88%; for intention-to-treat analyses, multiple imputation 
models were used to estimate end-of-study data for primary analyses.

aFor the primary outcome (ASAP vs DEUCC), α = .05; for the secondary outcomes (ASAP vs UCC and DEUCC vs UCC), α = .025. The end of the study was the primary end point and occurred 12 months after randomization. P values for group comparisons of change from 
baseline to end of study were derived from the imputed intention-to-treat model; imputed data are in eTable 3 in Supplement 2.
bBecause of skew in the Wolf Motor Function Test at baseline and end-of-study, both means and medians are reported; median Wolf Motor Function Test scores are presented for descriptive purposes only.
cParticipants whose baseline Stroke Impact Scale score was >75 (n = 15) were excluded from these analyses.
dDenominators for outcome data.
