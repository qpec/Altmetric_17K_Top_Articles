Abstract
Background: Media depictions and laws passed in state legislatures regulating abortion suggest abortion-related
medical emergencies are common. An accurate understanding of abortion-related emergencies is important for
informing policy and practice. We assessed the incidence of abortion-related emergency department (ED) visits in
the United States (U.S.).
Methods: We used a retrospective observational study design using 2009–2013 data from the Nationwide Emergency
Department Sample, a nationally representative sample of U.S. ED visits from 947 to 964 hospitals across the U.S. per year.
All ED visits among women of reproductive age (15–49) were included. We categorized ED visits by abortion relatedness
and treatments received, and assessed whether the visit was for a major incident (defined as requiring blood transfusion,
surgery, or overnight inpatient stay). We estimated the proportion of visits that were abortion-related and described the
characteristics of patients making these visits, the diagnoses and subsequent treatments received by these patients, the
sociodemographic and hospital characteristics associated with the incidents and observation care only (defined as
receiving no treatments), and the rate of major incidents for all abortion patients in the U.S.
Results: Among all ED visits by women aged 15–49 (189,480,685), 0.01% (n = 27,941) were abortion-related. Of these
visits, 51% (95% confidence interval, 95% CI 49.3–51.9%) of the women received observation care only. A total of 20%
(95% CI 19.3–21.3%) of abortion-related ED visits were for major incidents. One-fifth (22%, 95% CI 20.9–23.0%) of abortion-
related visits resulted in admission to the same hospital for abortion-related reasons. Of the visits, 1.4% (n = 390, 95% CI 1.
1–1.7%) were potentially due to attempts at self-induced abortion. In multivariable models, women using Medicaid
(adjusted odds ratio, AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08–1.52) and women with a comorbid condition (AORs 2.47–4.63) had higher
odds of having a major incident than women using private insurance and those without comorbid conditions. During
the study period, 0.11% of all abortions in the U.S. resulted in major incidents as seen in EDs.
Conclusions: Abortion-related ED visits comprise a small proportion of women’s ED visits. Many abortion-related ED visits
may not be indicated or could have been managed at a less costly level of care. Given the low rate of major incidents,
perceptions that abortion is unsafe are not based on evidence.

 Background
Emergency departments (EDs) are key sites of health-care
delivery in the United States (U.S.), with 141.4 million
visits in 2014 alone [1], and 55% of these visits are made
by women. Although abortion-related complications are
rare [2], the surge in legislation aimed at regulating abor-
tion access [3] suggests that complications are common
and that abortion is generally unsafe.
Since 2011, state legislatures across the U.S. have
passed numerous laws that regulate abortion provision,
many requiring abortion providers to obtain local hos-
pital admitting privileges and have transfer agreements
with nearby hospitals [3]. These laws are passed under a
presumption that they are needed to protect women’s
health and safety [4, 5] and that hospitalization as a re-
sult of abortion is an occurrence frequent enough to ne-
cessitate legislation formalizing the relationship between
hospitals, abortion providers, and clinics.
National-level estimates of abortion-related ED visits
do not exist. However, data from one state suggests that
abortion-related ED visits are rare. In a study using data
from California’s Medicaid program, Upadhyay et al.
found that 0.03% of abortions were followed by an im-
mediate ambulance transfer to an ED and 2.6% of abor-
tions were followed by an abortion-related ED visit
within 6 weeks of the abortion [2]. Another study that
examined all medication abortions done by Planned Par-
enthood in 2009 and 2010 found an ED treatment rate
of 0.10%, although medication abortions represented
only about 23% of abortions at the time, and this study
included only those ED visits that involved treatment
[6]. In a study of outcomes of abortion procedures by
family physicians in New York and Philadelphia, 0.3% of
first-trimester medication and aspiration abortion pa-
tients were referred or went to an ED for assessment [7].
There is a paucity of published national data on the inci-
dence and outcomes of ED visits after abortion. In this
study, we examine the frequency of abortion-related ED
visits, the frequency of major abortion-related incidents,
and the characteristics of abortion-related ED visits in the
U.S. using a nationally representative sample of ED visits.
Methods
Study design and data source
We conducted a retrospective observational study of
abortion-related ED visits using data from the Nation-
wide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), a nation-
ally representative sample of ED visits. NEDS is a
database of ED visits from 947 to 964 hospitals across
the U.S. per year. Annually it includes more than 30 mil-
lion unweighted visits, which represent more than 135
million weighted visits. NEDS was developed for the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and is
maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality. Data are available from 2006 onward. For this
study, we utilized the five most recent years of data
available (2009–2013). The study was certified exempt
by the institutional review board of the University of
California, San Francisco.
Unweighted visits are data collected on actual visits,
which are then weighted proportionately to the total
number of ED visits in the country based on the sam-
pling strategy. The NEDS is a stratified single-stage clus-
ter sample of state-level ED data reported to HCUP.
Using the American Hospital Association Annual Survey
of Hospitals as the target universe, the available data are
selected to approximate a 20% stratified sample of all
U.S. hospital-based EDs. More details of the sampling of
hospitals can be found on the HCUP website [8, 9]. The
characteristics used for sample stratification in the
NEDS are U.S. region, urban or rural location, teaching
status, ownership, and trauma level (see Fig. 1 for region
definitions and states contributing data).
The NEDS includes patient-level and hospital-level in-
formation. Each ED visit has patient-level demographic
characteristics including age, sex, primary and secondary
payment source, and zip code-based urbanicity and in-
come quartile. Each ED visit also has clinical characteris-
tics,
including
up
to
15
diagnoses
(International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9] codes),
up to 15 procedures or treatments (Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System [HCPCS] and Current Pro-
cedural Terminology [CPT] codes), injury codes, admis-
sion and discharge status, diagnosis and treatment codes
for inpatient care if admitted to the same hospital, and
total charges. Each visit also has the corresponding hos-
pital code, and hospital characteristics such as region,
trauma level, urban-rural location, and teaching status.
In this dataset, 5 of 13 states in the West, 11 of 12 states
in the Midwest, 8 of 16 states in the South, and 8 of 9
states in the Northeast were represented in the data.
Midwest hospitals were represented the most. The
trauma level of a hospital refers to how well equipped it
is to provide care to patients with traumatic injuries.
Trauma level influences patient composition and was
key to sample stratification in the dataset. Hospital own-
ership was categorized by the data distributor according
to information reported in the American Hospital Asso-
ciation Annual Survey Database. Ownership could be
governmental, private non-profit, or private for-profit.
Hospitals with religious affiliations, including Catholic
hospitals, are included, but are not distinguished as such
and may fall into private for-profit or private non-profit
categories. Federal hospitals (Veterans Affairs and De-
partment of Defense) were not included in the sample.
Patient-level and hospital-level weights were also pro-
vided to generate nationally representative estimates.
HCUP provided weights for the NEDS data and these

 were calculated at the hospital level after sampling by
hospital strata. Patient weights were calculated first by
stratifying the data by hospital characteristics (region,
urbanicity, trauma level, teaching status, and ownership).
Within each of these strata, a weight was generated by
dividing the total number of ED visits in the U.S. in that
year for that stratum (from American Hospital Associ-
ation data) by the number of ED visits for that stratum
in the NEDS data. Weighted data thus represent all ED
visits in the U.S. for a year.
Data preparation
We identified all ED visits that had an ICD-9 diagnosis
code for abortion (ICD-9 diagnosis codes 635, 636, 637,
and 638). We categorized ED visits by abortion related-
ness and treatments received, and assessed whether the
visit
was
for
a
major
or
minor
incident.
Visit
categorization was based on the previously developed
Procedural Abortion Incident Reporting and Surveil-
lance (PAIRS) Framework [10]. Based on procedure
codes, visits that were for observation care, repeat proce-
dures (codes present in the dataset were CPT/HCPCS
procedure codes 59812, 59820, 59821, 59840, 59841,
59851, 59855, and 59856; and ICD-9 procedure codes
6901, 6902, 6909, 6951, 6952, 6959, 734, and 750), blood
transfusions (CPT/HCPCS procedure codes 36430 and
P9021; and ICD-9 procedure codes 9903–9905), and
abortion-related
surgeries
(CPT/HCPCS
procedure
codes 49320, 58662, 58999, 59300, and 59898; and
ICD-9 procedure codes 680, 6831, 6839, 6849, 6851,
6859, 6869, and 7491) were systematically coded without
individual visit review. Where procedure and diagnosis
codes for a visit did not fall into one of these categories,
several authors who are emergency medicine physicians
or students with physician supervision provided an indi-
vidual review of each visit following a modified version
of the PAIRS framework (see Fig. 2). After a joint review
of 100 visits with refinement of the decision rules, the
physicians reviewed the remaining uncategorized visits,
resulting in 1642 reviewed ED visits in total.
For each reviewed visit, the emergency medicine physi-
cians assigned the reason for the patient’s ED visit to one
of five categories: abortion-related, concurrent condition,
pre-existing condition, not abortion-related, or cannot de-
termine. They classified an ED visit as abortion-related
based on the constellation of diagnosis and procedure
codes for that visit. Abortion-related visits included ad-
verse events, such as hemorrhage or infection, and symp-
toms directly related to the procedure, such as abdominal
pain and vomiting. Concurrent conditions were defined as

 conditions that may have been noticed during or exacer-
bated by abortion, but were not directly caused by the
abortion, such as ovarian cysts, vaginitis, urinary tract in-
fection, or anxiety/depression. Pre-existing conditions
were defined as chronic conditions such as hypertension
or diabetes. The data were also categorized with regards
to treatments received for abortion-related complaints.
Categories of treatment included uterine reaspiration
(which involves suction, not an incision, and does not
meet the criteria for surgery), intravenous (IV) and
non-IV medication, repeat abortion, blood transfusion,
surgery, observation care, or other. The medication
category excluded codes for injections or infusion of a
therapeutic substance if no accompanying medication was
listed. The observation care category included women
who had routine testing for their symptoms but did not
receive any medications or other treatments. This in-
cluded women who had IV fluids, blood work, testing for
sexually transmitted infections, and diagnostic imaging
studies, but no treatments. The NEDS dataset also in-
cluded information on whether patients were admitted as
an inpatient to the same hospital, discharged home, trans-
ferred to another facility, or left against medical advice.
Among women who were admitted, the reason for visit

 and treatment information in their chart was used to de-
termine if the admission was likely abortion-related.
Major and minor incidents were systematically coded,
with major incidents defined as those requiring an over-
night inpatient stay, blood transfusion, or surgery. Minor
incidents were defined as all other incidents that in-
volved an abortion-related diagnosis or treatment. All
overnight stays were further reviewed by physicians, and
a group of treatments for an abortion-related diagnosis
that together required the patient to stay overnight
qualified as a major incident. Visits that involved con-
current conditions, pre-existing conditions, or visits that
were not abortion-related were categorized as no inci-
dent. We identified the prevalence of comorbid condi-
tions based on diagnosis codes. These included three key
conditions
hypothesized
to
be
associated
with
abortion-related adverse events: diabetes, hypertension,
and having an overweight/obese body mass index (BMI)
[11–14].
ED visits were additionally categorized as being poten-
tially indicative of a self-induced abortion. The physician
team individually reviewed all abortion-related visits that
had diagnosis codes of illegal abortion, failed attempted
abortion, and certain injury codes (including poisonings
and indications of self-harm). They looked at all of the
diagnosis codes for that case and made a clinical judge-
ment based on the group of codes together and their ED
experience. Visits that were coded as illegal abortions, par-
ticularly those that included injury codes, were more often
considered potentially self-induced. In addition, visits that
included injury codes consistent with self-induction were
categorized as such. Cases which were unlikely to have
been abortion-related were removed.
Statistical analysis
We estimated the number of abortion-related ED visits
annually in the U.S. and the proportion of ED visits
among women of reproductive age (15–49) that were for
abortion-related care. We examined the characteristics
of the sample and compared these to published esti-
mates of the characteristics of abortion patients [15].
We also described outcomes including treatments re-
ceived and discharge status. Based on treatments re-
ceived, ED visits were categorized as being for a major
incident, a minor incident, no incident, or that the inci-
dent type could not be determined. We then built multi-
variable
logistic
regression
models
to
examine
the
factors associated with major incidents and observation
care, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics,
comorbidities, and hospital characteristics with the ED
visit as the unit of analysis. Per the recommendation of
the HCUP, the organization which oversees the NEDS
database, sample weights were not used in the multivari-
able models [16]. We also estimated the proportion of
ED
visits
that
were
potentially
due
to
attempted
self-induced abortion. Because the weighted estimates
are nationally representative, we were also able to use
published national estimates of abortion incidence [17]
to estimate the major incident rate for abortion in the
U.S. during the study period. This assumes that the vast
majority of major incidents go through an ED evaluation
(although we acknowledge that a small percentage do
not). For all analyses, we report weighted results unless
otherwise specified. Where data were missing, a missing
category was retained for all analyses. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at P < 0.05 for all chi-squared tests and ad-
justed odds ratios (AORs). We used STATA 14 for all
analyses.
Results
Among 42,493,214 unweighted visits among women of
reproductive age (15–49) during the study period, 6342
visits had an abortion diagnosis. Among these, 70 visits
were determined to be unrelated to abortion based on
clinician review and 33 visits were duplicates (all vari-
ables were identical other than ID number); these 103
visits were excluded, leaving an analytical sample of
6239 unweighted abortion-related ED visits. We did not
include an additional 101 visits with abortion diagnoses
for women outside the age range of interest (younger
than 15 or older than 49).
The final analytical sample corresponded to 27,941
weighted ED visits for abortion-related reasons among
189,480,685 weighted ED visits among women of reproduct-
ive age. Thus abortion-related ED visits represented 0.01%
of all ED visits among women of reproductive age during
the study period. All subsequent results are weighted.
The average age of the population seeking abortion-related
ED care was 26, and 12.9% of visits were by women
under 20 (Table 1). Women using Medicaid were most
common (45.2% of visits), followed by those using pri-
vate insurance (31.4%), and those who self-paid (17.1%).
The population seeking abortion-related ED care was
overwhelmingly of urban residence (91.0%). Low-income
zip code residences were overrepresented in the sample;
27.5% of women lived in a zip code with the lowest na-
tional income quartile, while 20.5% lived in the highest in-
come quartile. Comorbid conditions including diabetes
(1.5%), hypertension (3.2%), and overweight/obese BMI
(1.8%) were noted in abortion-related ED visits. Hospitals
in the South (35.5%) and West (31.7%) had the largest
number of abortion-related ED visits. Most visits were to
non-trauma or trauma level III hospitals (62.8%) and most
were to hospitals in urban locations (92.3%). Visit num-
bers remained approximately constant throughout the
study period. Average ED costs were $4719, with 8.6% of
ED visits costing $10,000 or more.

 Half of abortion-related visits received observation
care only (50.6%, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 49.3–
51.9%) (Table 2). Nearly a third of visits resulted in a
uterine
reaspiration
or
repeat
abortion
procedure
(32.2%, 95% CI 31.0–33.4%). Medications were used in
16.1% of ED visits (95% CI 15.2–17.1%): IV-medications
in 13.7% of visits and non-IV medications in 7.4% of
visits. The most commonly administered medication was
pain medication (10.4%, 95% CI 9.7–11.2%), followed by
anti-nausea medication (7.4%, 95% CI 6.8–8.1%) and an-
tibiotics (3.2%, 95% CI 2.8–3.7%). A minority of ED
visits involved blood transfusion (5.0%, 95% CI 4.5–

 5.6%), abortion-related surgery (1.0%, 95% CI 0.7–1.2%),
or other treatments (0.3%, 95% CI 0.2–0.5%), and 19.4%
(95% CI 18.5–20.5%) of all abortion-related visits re-
sulted in an overnight inpatient stay at the same hos-
pital. Major incidents, treated with blood transfusion,
surgery, or overnight inpatient stay, accounted for 20.3%
(95% CI 19.3–21.3%) of all visits. Minor incidents
accounted for 36.1% (95% CI 34.9–37.4%) of visits.
Three-quarters (75.1%) of abortion-related ED visits re-
sulted in discharge from the ED. Another 21.2% were ad-
mitted to the same hospital for abortion-related reasons
and 0.8% were admitted for non-abortion-related reasons.
For the remaining 3%, the disposition was unknown or they
were transferred to another medical facility or left against
medical advice. Among all abortion-related ED visits over
the 5 years of data (n = 27,941), 15 ended in the patient’s
death.
Several demographic and hospital factors were signifi-
cantly associated with major incidents in a multivariable
model (Table 3). Women over 30 were more likely than
women aged 20–24 to have major incidents (P < 0.001),
and women using Medicaid (P = 0.004) were more likely
than women with private insurance to have a major inci-
dent. Women who paid out of pocket for the ED visit were
less likely to have a major incident than women with pri-
vate insurance (P = 0.001). The presence of any of the three
examined comorbid conditions was associated with more
than double the odds of a major incident compared to
women without those comorbid conditions (P < 0.01). ED
visits at trauma hospitals were more likely to be for major
incidents than those at non-trauma hospitals (P < 0.001).
ED visits in all regions were significantly more likely to be
for a major incident than those in the Midwest (P < 0.001).
There was a decreasing trend in major incidents over time.
Similar significant relationships were found for factors asso-
ciated with receipt of observation care only, but factors as-
sociated with increased likelihood of major incidents were
associated with a lower likelihood of requiring observation
care only. Two notable exceptions are a significantly higher
likelihood of observation care only in the West compared
to the Midwest (P < 0.001) and the absence of a trend over
time for receipt of observation care only.
We used published rates of the total number of abor-
tions to calculate the percentage of all abortions seen in
an ED that resulted in a major incident. During the
5-year study period, there were an estimated 5,282,500
total abortions in the U.S. [17]. Using this number as the
denominator, we estimate the rate of major incidents
seen in EDs for abortion in the U.S. is 0.11%, or 108 per
100,000 abortions.
We identified 390 ED visits that represented potential
self-induced
abortion
and
accounted
for
1.4%
of
abortion-related ED visits during the study period (95% CI
1.1–1.7%). There were slightly higher rates of potential
self-induced abortion in the South (2.0%) than in the Mid-
west (1.0%), West (1.1%), and Northeast (1.3%) (P = 0.05)
(Table 4). There were no time trends or other factors asso-
ciated with self-induced abortion.
Discussion
We found that abortion-related ED visits comprised
0.01% of ED visits among women aged 15–49. In other

 words, 14 of every 100,000 ED visits among women aged
15–49 were for abortion-related reasons. The majority
(51%) of these were visits involving observation care only.
These data also allowed us to estimate the national
major incident rate after an abortion. The rate of 0.11%
(108 per 100,000) abortion patients is slightly higher
than the rate of 0.05% found in a study of first trimester
abortion patients in California [18], and slightly lower
than the rate of 0.23% found in a study of all abortions
covered by California’s Medicaid program [2]. While not
all abortion-related incidents lead to an ED visit and
thus, are not reflected in this estimate, we believe that
the vast majority of major incidents (those involving a
blood transfusion, surgery, or hospital admission) are
reflected here. Those that would be missed from this
analysis are cases that skip the ED and are directly ad-
mitted to a hospital or an outpatient surgicenter (usually
for scheduled hospitalization) and complications arising
from the small proportion (4%) of abortions done in
hospitals [17] and are then directly admitted. Thus, the
major incident rate may be slightly underestimated.
The major incident rate for abortion (0.1%) is lower
than the published rates for pregnancy (1.4%) [19], as
well as other common procedures such as colonoscopy
(0.2%) [20], wisdom tooth removal (1.0%) [21], and ton-
sillectomy (1.4%) [22]. Abortion care is, thus, safer than
many other unregulated outpatient procedures. Add-
itionally, we found 15 deaths between 2009 and 2013,
which is slightly lower than the total number of
abortion-related deaths reported in 2009–2012, the most
recent years available (n = 24) [23].
Notably, the majority of visits involved observation
care only, which is consistent with a previous study [2].

 Patients experience a range of post-abortion symptoms,
including ongoing uterine cramping and bleeding for up
to 3 weeks after the abortion. Patients may not realize
that this is normal. Some women do not start to bleed
until several days after the abortion, while some stop
bleeding and then start again. Increased cramping and
bleeding could start several days after the abortion. Pa-
tients may not be given ample information about what
to expect or they may have trouble differentiating nor-
mal post-abortion symptoms from signs of a complica-
tion. Patient visits to EDs for non-urgent care have the
potential to be costly to the health system. Such visits
could be due to several reasons and little research has
been done on factors that contribute to patients’ deci-
sions to visit an ED after abortion. EDs offer 24-h access
to care compared to abortion facilities, which have rela-
tively limited hours and may require an appointment
[24]. The long distances that many women across the
U.S. must travel to reach an abortion provider may make
return visits for follow-up too arduous [25, 26]. Indeed,
research found that patients who travel longer distances
to reach an abortion provider are more likely to visit an
ED for follow-up care or to manage subsequent symp-
toms and less likely to return to the original abortion
provider [27]. We note that patients presenting to the
ED were disproportionately of urban residence (91% in
the sample compared to 81% of the U.S. population)
[28]. This is likely explained in that 91% of abortion pa-
tients live in urban areas [29] and 92% of EDs in the
sample were in urban areas, attracting mainly local resi-
dents who may find them convenient geographically.
Post-abortion visits to the ED may also be driven by
stigma, worry, or distrust of abortion providers. A per-
ception that abortion is unsafe [30–32] may lead women
to worry about mild symptoms, such as cramping and
bleeding, even though they are an expected result of
abortion. Such perceptions may stem from abortion por-
trayals in the media and popular culture. A study of
abortion-related storylines in fictional American televi-
sion shows found a major incident rate of 34% [33], over
34,000% greater than the real-life major incident rate of
0.1% found here. The long-term consequences of these
fictional abortions were much more likely to be severe,
including frequent depictions of negative mental health
sequelae, infertility, and even death.
Women using Medicaid had higher odds of major inci-
dents than those not using Medicaid and lower odds of
observation care. In this context, insurance type may be a
proxy for socioeconomic status, as women requiring Me-
dicaid are low income and as a result, face a multitude of
barriers to accessing health care and are known to have
poorer health status, including multiple chronic condi-
tions, than women with private insurance. Women who
were self-pay were less likely to have major incidents and
more likely to receive observation care only, suggesting
that patients without healthcare coverage may not have
been given treatments to reduce patient costs.
We found that the pre-existing chronic conditions that
have previously been suspected to be associated with
major abortion-related incidents were indeed associated
with a significantly higher rate of those incidents in this
sample. While there is limited previous research on the
impact of chronic health conditions on the risk of abor-
tion complications, it is well established that women
with
chronic
conditions
are
more
likely
to
have
pregnancy-related complications [34]. Our findings are
consistent with provider guidance that suggests women
with multiple chronic medical conditions may be at in-
creased risk [35], but conflicting with previous studies
that find that obesity and chronic health conditions con-
fer no increased risk among women having abortions
[11–14]. This increased risk might be explained in that
women who had overnight inpatient stays (one of the cat-
egories of a major incident) were more likely to have their
obesity or other chronic diseases documented in their
charts than those who did not have an overnight stay.
We found some cases of potential self-induced abor-
tions using such means as poisoning or other methods
of self-harm. While self-induced abortions are safe when
appropriate dosages of mifepristone and misoprostol or
misoprostol alone are used, other methods are hazard-
ous, as evidenced by ED visits. Rates were highest in the
South, which is known to have the most barriers to
abortion access, including the fewest providers [17, 26],

 and the most state-level restrictions. States that are hos-
tile
to
abortion
may
see
more
ED
visits
due
to
self-induced abortion than non-hostile states, potentially
due to stigma, protesters, and other barriers to in-clinic
abortion.
This study included a large, nationally representative
sample of ED visits, allowing us to draw national- and
regional-level conclusions about abortion safety. How-
ever, using billing codes to understand the nature of the
ED visit can be imprecise and incomplete. The estimates
produced here may be conservative if patients did not
report
having
had
an
abortion
due
to
fear
of
stigmatization or if relevant diagnosis and procedure
codes were not reported or were systematically misre-
ported. The lack of full clinical data to determine abor-
tion relatedness could cause errors. For example, the
visits in this study could include cases of miscarriage.
Likewise, this study may miss abortion-related incidents
that were inaccurately coded as a miscarriage.
Conclusions
These new findings can inform policy debates regarding
abortion regulation in the U.S. Regulations on abortion
provider or facility relationships to hospitals or EDs
should be considered in light of their relative impact on
improving women’s health. Because abortion-related ED
visits comprise a very small proportion of women’s ED
visits, and the rate of major incidents is very low, regula-
tions on abortion are unlikely to have any impact on
women’s health outcomes. Many abortion-related ED
visits are for observation only and may not be indicated
or could be managed at a less costly level of care. Per-
ceptions that abortion is unsafe are not based on
evidence.
