SUMMARY
Fungal infections are major causes of morbidity and
mortality, especially in immunocompromised indi-
viduals. The innate immune system senses fungal
pathogens through Syk-coupled C-type lectin recep-
tors (CLRs), which signal through the conserved im-
mune adaptor Card9. Although Card9 is essential
for antifungal defense, the mechanisms that couple
CLR-proximal events to Card9 control are not well
defined. Here, we identify Vav proteins as key activa-
tors of the Card9 pathway. Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3
cooperate downstream of Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and
Mincle to engage Card9 for NF-kB control and proin-
flammatory gene transcription. Although Vav family
members show functional redundancy, Vav1/2/3�/�
mice phenocopy Card9�/� animals with extreme
susceptibility to fungi. In this context, Vav3 is the sin-
gle most important Vav in mice, and a polymorphism
in human VAV3 is associated with susceptibility to
candidemia in patients. Our results reveal a molecu-
lar mechanism for CLR-mediated Card9 regulation
that controls innate immunity to fungal infections.
INTRODUCTION
Cells of the innate immune system sense microbial components
or cell damage-associated structures via germline-encoded
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that subsequently signal
for host defense and tissue homeostasis (Takeuchi and Akira,
2010). One important family of signaling PRRs on myeloid cells
are the Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptors (Kerrigan and
Brown, 2011; Sancho and Reis e Sousa, 2012). These PRRs
play a broad role in innate immunity and are particularly impor-
tant for host defense against fungal infections (Ferwerda et al.,
2009; Robinson et al., 2009; Saijo et al., 2007, 2010; Sato
et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2007; Wells et al., 2008), which consti-
tute an increasing health threat because of growing numbers of
patients at risk mainly because of immunosuppressive medical
interventions and AIDS. In the context of antifungal immunity,
the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family member Dectin-1 senses
b-glucans in fungal cell walls (Brown and Gordon, 2001),
whereas Mincle and Dectin-2 detect a-mannose, glycolipids,
and a-mannans, respectively (Sancho and Reis e Sousa,
2012). Agonist binding by Dectin-1 leads to the phosphorylation
of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like
motifs in its cytoplasmic tail by Src family kinases, resulting in
activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Likewise, Dectin-2 and
Mincle also activate Syk, indicating that these CLR signals
engage common effector mechanisms (Mo
´ csai et al., 2010; San-
cho and Reis e Sousa, 2012). The innate immune adaptor protein
Card9 is critical for CLR signaling. It assembles signaling com-
plexes that also contain Bcl10 and Malt1 (Card9-BCl10-Malt1
[CBM] complexes) and that serve as scaffolds for activation of
the canonical nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) pathway (Roth and Ru-
land, 2013). This mechanism activates the inhibitor of kappa B
(IkB) kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates inhibitory
IkBs, leading to their proteasomal degradation and the release
of NF-kB dimers to the nucleus to activate gene transcription
(Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). Malt1 can also function as a

 protease upon CBM complex assembly that cleaves a set of
NF-kB regulators, including RelB, to fine-tune immune gene
expression (Hailfinger et al., 2011; Jaworski et al., 2014). These
Card9 signaling complexes operate downstream of all tested
Syk-coupled CLRs (Roth and Ruland, 2013) and are essential
for innate antifungal immunity. Indeed, Card9-deficient mice
are highly susceptible to infection with Candida (Gross et al.,
2006; Jia et al., 2014), Aspergillus (Jhingran et al., 2012), and
Cryptococcus (Yamamoto et al., 2014) species. Moreover,
loss-of-function mutations in human CARD9 have been identi-
fied as causes of mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections
(Glocker et al., 2009; Pe
´ rez de Diego et al., 2015). Nevertheless,
despite the critical role for CLR-triggered Card9 signaling in
innate immunity and mammalian host defense, the molecular
mechanisms that link CLR ligation to Card9-dependent effector
mechanisms are not well understood.
Here, we used a mass spectrometry-based
proteomic
approach and identified Vav proteins as regulators of Card9
signaling. Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3 cooperate downstream of
Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle to engage Card9 complexes for
NF-kB control and proinflammatory gene transcription. Like
Card9-deficient mice, Vav1/2/3 triple-deficient mice are severely
impaired in inflammatory responses to Candida albicans infec-
tion and host defense against the fungus. Moreover, we report
a human polymorphism in VAV3 that is associated with suscep-
tibility to candidemia. Thus, our results establish Vav proteins as
essential regulators of CLR-mediated Card9 control in innate
antifungal immunity.
RESULTS
Fungal Infection Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of
Vav in Myeloid Cells
To investigate the mechanisms of Syk-coupled CLR signaling, we
stimulated wild-type murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
(BMDCs), comprising conventional DCs and monocyte-derived
macrophages (Helft et al., 2015), for 10 min with zymosan, a yeast
cell wall preparation that is highly enriched in Dectin-1 and Dec-
tin-2 agonists, and subsequently affinity-purified tyrosine-phos-
phorylated proteins for mass spectrometric analysis (Strasser
et al., 2012). Under these conditions, we observed signal-induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 and Vav3, which are cytosolic
signaling scaffolds and guanine nucleotide exchange factors
that can play context-specific roles in immune receptor pathways
(Bustelo, 2014). To validate these findings, we stimulated BMDCs
with C. albicans hyphae andspecifically analyzed Vav1 phosphor-
ylation by western blot analysis. Indeed, Vav1 was tyrosine-phos-
phorylated after C. albicans infection (Figure 1A). These data are in
line with previously published results that demonstrated that stim-
ulation with b-glucan or zymosan triggers tyrosine phosphoryla-
tion of Vav1 also in microglial cells or neutrophils (Li et al., 2011;
Shah et al., 2009). Further analysis with a phosphospecific
antibody raised against the regulatory Tyr174 residue of Vav1
additionally revealed that this specific residue is phosphorylated
uponC.albicansdetection,indicatingVav1activation(Aghazadeh
et al., 2000), but not upon LPS stimulation (Figure 1B).
Recent work has demonstrated that Vav phosphorylation
downstream of different ITAM-containing receptors is mediated
by Src and Syk kinases (Bustelo, 2014). To determine the impor-
tance of the CLR-proximal Src and Syk kinases in Vav phosphor-
ylation, we pretreated BMDCs with the Src inhibitor PP2 or the
Syk inhibitor R406 prior to the addition of C. albicans. Both Src
and Syk inhibition blocked Vav1-Tyr174 phosphorylation in
a dose-dependent manner, whereas pretreatment with PP3, an
inactive analog of PP2, did not affect C. albicans-induced phos-
phorylation of Vav1 at Tyr174 (Figure 1C). Together, these results
indicate that Vav1 is activated in myeloid antigen-presenting
cells specifically after fungal sensing via an Src and Syk ki-
nase-dependent mechanism.
CLR-Mediated Inflammatory Responses Are Critically
Dependent on Vav Proteins
Next, we studied the functional relevance of Vav proteins in
C. albicans-induced inflammatory responses. Because dendritic
cells express Vav2 (Spurrell et al., 2009) in addition to Vav1 and
Vav3, which have partially redundant functions in immune cells
(Fujikawa et al., 2003; Tybulewicz, 2005), we investigated
BMDCs from mice that lack each individual Vav isoform, two
Vav isoforms, or all three Vav family members. Notably, the
lack of any one or all Vav molecules did not impair BMDC differ-
entiation (data not shown; Graham et al., 2007; Spurrell et al.,
2009). However, BMDCs from Vav1/2/3 triple-deficient mice
were severely defective in C. albicans-induced TNF production,
whereas tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion in response to
Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation with LPS or Pam3CSK4
was unaffected in these cells (Figure 2A). Moreover, the produc-
tion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-10 was also defective in BMDCs
from Vav1/2/3�/� mice (Figure 2A). The finding that Vav1, Vav2,
or Vav3 single-deficient or Vav2/3�/� myeloid antigen-present-
ing cells are only partially impaired in C. albicans-induced TNF,
IL-2, and IL-10 generation (Figure 2B) indicates redundancy for
Vav proteins in fungus-induced cytokine responses.
One important inflammatory cytokine for antifungal immunity
is IL-1b (Vonk et al., 2006), the generation of which is controlled
by NF-kB-dependent pro-IL-1b gene transcription followed by
NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated Caspase-1-dependent pro-
IL-1b processing (Gross et al., 2009; Hise et al., 2009). Stimula-
tion of wild-type BMDCs with C. albicans induced the robust
secretion of mature IL-1b into the culture supernatant (Figure 2C).
In contrast, Vav1/2/3-deficient cells were almost completely
defective in Candida-induced IL-1b production (Figure 2C).
This defect was caused by the selective impairment of pro-IL-
1b gene transcription in Vav1/2/3�/� cells (Figure 2D), whereas
the deficiency of Vav proteins did not affect NLRP3 inflamma-
some-dependent Caspase-1 activation (Figure 2E). Together,
these experiments demonstrate that Vav proteins are critical
for cytokine production by myeloid cells following the detection
of whole fungal cells.
Next, we studied the specific requirement of Vav proteins for
Dectin-1-, Dectin-2-, and Mincle-induced cytokine responses
using selective agonists for each individual receptor. Stimulation
of Dectin-1 with curdlan, a purified particulate b-glucan (Lei-
bundGut-Landmann et al., 2007), induced the robust production
of
TNF
in
wild-type
BMDCs,
whereas
Vav1/2/3-deficient
cells failed to produce TNF in response to Dectin-1 triggering
(Figure 2F). Likewise, stimulation of BMDCs with agonistic

 antibodies against Dectin-2 or with trehalose-6,6-dibehenate
(TDB), a synthetic analog of the mycobacterial cord factor treha-
lose 6,60-dimycolate (TDM), which specifically activates Mincle
(Lobato-Pascual et al., 2013; Miyake et al., 2013; Schoenen
et al., 2010), induced TNF in wild-type cells, but this response
was severely impaired in Vav1/2/3-deficient BMDCs (Figure 2F).
Therefore, although Vav single- or double-mutant cells exhibited
a partially impaired cytokine response upon selective Dectin-1,
Dectin-2, or Mincle stimulation (Figure 2G), the Vav family as a
whole is essential for cytokine production after Syk-coupled
CLR ligation in vitro.
Vav Proteins Regulate CLR-Induced Inflammatory
Responses In Vivo and Are Essential for Antifungal
Defense
To investigate the function of Vav proteins in CLR-mediated
inflammatory responses in vivo, we intravenously injected the
Mincle ligand TDM (Ishikawa et al., 2009; Miyake et al., 2013)
into wild-type and Vav1/2/3�/� mice. Consistent with previously
published results (Ishikawa et al., 2009), TDM injection resulted
in the strong systemic production of TNF, IL-1b, and IL-10 in
wild-type mice (Figure 2H). However, these responses were
defective in Vav1/2/3 triple-deficient animals (Figure 2H). Next,
we studied the role of Vav proteins in inflammatory cytokine re-
sponses after fungal infection in vivo. To this end, we intrave-
nously injected wild-type or Vav1/2/3 triple knockout mice with
live C. albicans and measured serum TNF and IL-6 levels after
6 hr. Notably, the production of both inflammatory cytokines
was almost completely abolished in Vav1/2/3�/� mice (Fig-
ure 3A). Subsequently, we studied the importance of individual
Vav proteins in host protection against fungi by infecting wild-
type or Vav single-, double-, or triple-deficient mice with 1 3
105 colony-forming units (CFUs) of C. albicans. Four days later,
we assessed intravital fungal growth in the kidneys, the main

 target organ of the fungus (Brieland et al., 2001). Although
wild-type mice cleared the fungus readily, the kidneys of all
investigated Vav1/2/3�/� mice were enlarged and infiltrated
with macroscopically visible fungal colonies (Figure 3B). Quanti-
tatively, we detected more than 100-fold higher titers of
C. albicans in the kidneys of Vav1/2/3 triple-deficient animals
compared with the wild-type (Figure 3C), and histopathology
confirmed intravital fungal growth (Figure 3D). The fungal bur-
dens in Vav3 single knockout and Vav2/3 double knockout
mice were increased by trend compared with the wild-type,
but a selective loss of Vav1 or Vav2 did not result in higher fungal
titers compared with wild-type mice (Figure 3C). Finally, we stud-
ied the role of Vav signaling in the survival of mice after fungal
infection. In line with the incapacity to control fungal invasion
of the organs, Vav1/2/3-deficient mice died rapidly after injection
of 1 3 105 CFU of C. albicans, whereas the wild-type control an-
imals survived this challenge (Figure 3E). These experiments
reveal that Vav proteins play essential roles in fungus-induced
cytokine production and antifungal immunity in vivo, with Vav3
being the single most important Vav family member for protec-
tion against C. albicans infection.
Vav Proteins Are Regulators of CLR-Induced NF-kB
Activation
The susceptibility of Vav1/2/3 triple-deficient animals and the
failure to induce CLR-mediated cytokine responses are reminis-
cent of the severe phenotype observed in Card9-deficient mice,
suggesting that Vav proteins and Card9 may operate in a com-
mon signaling cascade. Because of the partially overlapping
functions of the three Vav isoforms, we focused subsequent
biochemical studies on Vav1/2/3 triple knockout BMDCs.
Upon C. albicans stimulation, phosphorylation of the tyrosine ki-
nase Syk and of the Dectin-1 signal transducer PLCg2 (Xu et al.,
2009) did not differ between wild-type and Vav1/2/3�/� BMDCs
(Figure 4A), indicating that Vav proteins are not required for
the immediate receptor-proximal events. Moreover, because
Erk1/2, p38, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were similarly
phosphorylated in C. albicans-stimulated wild-type and Vav1/
2/3�/� BMDCs (Figure 4B), we conclude that Vavs are not essen-
tial for the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling after fungal infection. However, activation of protein ki-
nase C d (PKCd), which controls Card9 engagement (Strasser
et al., 2012), was partially impaired in BMDCs lacking all three
Vav isoforms (Figure 4C; Figure S1A). Likewise, PKCd deficiency
partially compromised Vav1 phosphorylation in response to
C. albicans or curdlan stimulation (Figure S1B). Moreover,
although C. albicans or curdlan stimulation of wild-type BMDCs
induces the rapid activation of the IKK complex, as determined
by measuring IKKa/b phosphorylation (Figure 4C; Figures S1A
and S1B), this response is almost completely abolished in the
absence of Vav proteins (Figure 4C; Figure S1A) or PKCd (Fig-
ure S1B; Strasser et al., 2012). Consistent with these findings,
C. albicans-induced nuclear translocation of the transcriptional
active NF-kB subunits p65, c-Rel, and RelB were also severely
defective in Vav1/2/3�/� BMDCs, as they are in Card9-deficient
cells (Figures 4D and 4E; Figures S1C and S1D), demonstrating a
critical role for Vav proteins in CLR-dependent NF-kB control.
As indicated above, the activation of the Card9/Bcl10/Malt1
complex not only regulates IKK activation but also induces
Malt1 proteolytic activity (Jaworski et al., 2014). Consistently,
stimulation of wild-type BMDCs with CLR ligands results in the
rapid proteolytic processing of the Malt1 substrate RelB (Figures
4F and 4G; Figures S1E and S1F; Gewies et al., 2014; Hailfinger
et al., 2011; Jaworski et al., 2014). Curdlan-induced RelB cleav-
age was completely defective in BMDCs from Malt1�/� mice and
from mice with gene-targeted inactivation of the Malt1 paracas-
pase function (Malt1PM/�) (Gewies et al., 2014; Figure 4F; Fig-
ure S1E) and, therefore, can be used as a marker for CBM
complex activation. Likewise, Malt1-mediated RelB cleavage
upon C. albicans stimulation was also defective in Vav1/2/3 triple
knockout cells (Figure 4G; Figure S1F), which, together with
the defective IKK activation in Vav1/2/3�/� BMDCs, indicates
that Vav proteins operate upstream of the Card9/Bcl10/Malt1
signalosome.
Finally, we studied the role of Vav proteins in CLR-induced
gene expression in a global manner. To this end, we performed
high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-
seq]) followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of cur-
dlan-stimulated and untreated BMDCs. In Dectin-1-stimulated
wild-type BMDCs, we detected a significant enrichment of upre-
gulated NF-kB-dependent transcripts compared with Vav1/
2/3�/� cells (Figure 4H), which is consistent with the defective
IKK activation described above. These results further validate
Vav proteins as essential regulators of CLR-mediated NF-kB
control.
A Human Vav3 Polymorphism Is Associated with
Susceptibility to Candidemia
After identifying Vav proteins as integral regulators of the Dec-
tin-1/Card9/NF-kB signaling cascade in murine cells, we were
interested in the potential roles for Vav molecules in human anti-
fungal immunity. Therefore, we investigated whether genetic var-
iations linked to any of the VAV genes correlate with susceptibility
to candidemia in patients by studying a previously described
cohort of candidemia patients and an appropriate control group
(Jaeger et al., 2015). Interestingly, the analysis of SNPs associ-
ated with VAV3 revealed a significant association with candide-
mia, with the significant SNPs distributed across the linkage
(F and G) BMDCs from WT and Vav1/2/3-/- mice (F), or Vav single- or double mutant mice of the indicated genotypes (G) were untreated (�), stimulated with the
Dectin-1 ligand curdlan (10 mg/ml), plate-bound anti-Dectin-2 (12.5 mg/ml) or isotype control antibodies (Isotype), or the Mincle ligand TDB (100 mg/ml). TNF levels
in the cell culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA.
(H) WT and Vav1/2/3�/� mice were injected intravenously with TDM containing oil-in-water emulsions or with the vehicle control (�). 24 hr post-injection, TNF,
IL-1b, and IL-10 levels in sera were determined by CBA.

 disequilibrium (LD) region of the gene. The association does not
extend beyond the LD region, and the strongest association
was with the SNP rs4914950 (Figure 5A). The risk genotype of
the SNP rs4914950TT is increased from 10% (control population)
to 18% (candidemia patients) (Figure 5B).
DISCUSSION
Using a complementary approach of immunology, molecular
biology, and genetic studies, the results presented in this manu-
script define an essential role for Vav proteins in CLR-mediated
inflammatory responses and establish these molecules as
essential signaling platforms that relay proximal events from
Syk-coupled CLRs to the Card9 signaling complex for NF-kB
control and antifungal defense (Dambuza and Brown, 2015;
Osorio and Reis e Sousa, 2011; Roth and Ruland, 2013).
Although individual Vav isoforms can compensate for each
other, their combined absence results in a blockade of CLR-
dependent NF-kB activation similar to Card9 deficiency, with
Vav3 being the most important family member in this pathway
in mice and, presumably, in humans.
When engaged by fungal particles, Syk-coupled CLRs acti-
vate various intracellular signaling pathways that regulate
phagocytosis, microbicidal activities, and gene transcription.
Using C. albicans as a clinically relevant model organism that
is sensed by multiple CLRs and induces CLR signaling (Robin-
son et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2007; Wells et al., 2008), we
observed Vav activation downstream of Syk. In addition, using
defined agonists of Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle, we estab-
lished a general role for Vav proteins in CLR signaling in myeloid
antigen-presenting cells. However, our results that CLR-medi-
ated MAPK activation and inflammasome signaling are not
impaired in Vav1/2/3 triple-deficient BMDCs reveal that Vav pro-
teins only mediate specific CLR effector mechanisms. Recent
studies have indicated the involvement of Vav1 and Vav3 in
Dectin-1-mediated zymosan phagocytosis and reactive oxygen

 species (ROS) production in neutrophils and the recruitment of
Vav1 to phagocytic cups for C. albicans engulfment by macro-
phages (Li et al., 2011; Strijbis et al., 2013). Although these
effector mechanisms are important during innate immune re-
sponses, they are not regulated by the Card9 pathway (Drewniak
et al., 2013; Goodridge et al., 2009; Gross et al., 2006). However,
the Card9 signaling pathway appears to be the central mamma-
lian host defense mechanism against fungi, given that multiple
genetic studies in humans have recently identified that several
Card9 loss-of-function defects are causative for several fungal
diseases, including various types of mucocutaneous candidi-
asis; superficial, extensive, and deep dermatophytosis with Tri-
chophyton spp.; subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis; invasive
Candida infections of the digestive tract and central nervous sys-
tem; Candida endophthalmitis and osteomyelitis; and dissemi-
nated Exophiala disease of the liver, brain, and lung (Grumach
et al., 2015; Pe
´ rez de Diego et al., 2015).
We assessed enzymatic Malt1 paracaspase activity as a direct
functional marker for Card9 complex activity in Vav-deficient
mice. Given that this activity was severely impaired in Vav1/2/3
triple-deficient BMDCs, our results establish Vav molecules as
regulators of the Card9/Bcl10/Malt1 complex. Consistent with
the essential function of a Vav/Card9-mediated mechanism for
CLR-induced NF-kB activation, the NF-kB response is blocked
in Vav1/2/3-deficient mice in response to C. albicans infection
or selective CLR triggering, and Vav1/2/3-deficient animals
exhibit dramatically impaired proinflammatory cytokine produc-
tion in response to C. albicans infection and CLR stimulation
in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose a mechanistic model
in which Syk is engaged by CLRs upon fungal sensing, thereby
triggering the phosphorylation and activation of Vav proteins,
which subsequently activate the Card9 complex for NF-kB con-
trol and antifungal gene transcription.
How Vav proteins are mechanistically coupled to Card9 con-
trol remains to be determined. We previously demonstrated
that Card9 is phosphorylated by PKCd at Thr231 to induce
Card9 effector function. However, the activation of PKCd is
only partially impaired in Vav-deficient BMDCs, whereas IKK
activation is almost completely defective. Similarly, in PKCd-
deficient cells, IKK phosphorylation is abolished, whereas phos-
phorylation of Vav1 is only slightly compromised, suggesting,
together, that Vav and PKCd operate at the same level upstream
of Card9. Because Vav proteins can control cytoskeletal reorga-
nization and serve as scaffolding platforms in other signaling
systems (Acton et al., 2012; Bustelo, 2014; Spurrell et al.,
2009; Tybulewicz, 2005), we speculate that Vav family members
could bring Card9 into the vicinity of key upstream regulators
such as PKCd and potential, still unknown factors to allow
Card9 activation. Moreover, because Vav1/2/3 do not only regu-
late CLR-induced Card9-NF-kB signaling but also control other
cellular responses, such as phagocytosis and ROS production
(Li et al., 2011; Strijbis et al., 2013), the precise molecular inter-
dependence of these mechanisms should be defined in the
future.
In accordance with our molecular model, similar to Card9 defi-
ciency, a complete deficiency in all Vav isoforms results in a
massive susceptibility to C. albicans infection. Likewise, a condi-
tional deficiency of Syk only in dendritic cells also abolishes
innate resistance to acute systemic C. albicans infection (Whit-
ney et al., 2014), and Whitney et al. (2014) elegantly demon-
strated that the early innate cytokine response is required to
orchestrate innate anti-fungal functions, including neutrophil
anti-fungal activity. Nevertheless, in our infection models pre-
sented here, it must be noted that the Vav mutant mice analyzed
were germline Vav-deficient animals and that Vav proteins are
not selectively expressed in Syk and Card9-containing innate
immune cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and neu-
trophils, but are also expressed in lymphocytes, which signal
through Card9-independent mechanisms (Gross et al., 2006;
Hara et al., 2007). Still, the rapid death of Vav1/2/3 triple-defi-
cient mice upon fungal infection indicates that an innate immune
defect is indeed responsible for the observed phenotype. This
hypothesis is also in line with the established roles of Vav1 and
Vav3 in mediating phagocytosis and ROS production in macro-
phages and neutrophils upon fungal sensing (Li et al., 2011; Strij-
bis et al., 2013). Future studies with conditional Vav mutant mice
will further dissect the individual roles of Vav signaling in den-
dritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils as well as in adaptive
immune subsets during complex fungal infection scenarios
in vivo. In addition, in vivo results in individual Vav1-, 2-,
and 3-deficient animals also revealed that, although there is
functional redundancy among the three Vav family members in
infection control, Vav3 is the single most important Vav family
member for antifungal defense in mice. This finding is consistent
with our results in patients who link a polymorphism in the VAV3
gene to susceptibility to Candida infection, suggesting that the
function of Vav molecules is similar to Card9 function conserved
between mice and men.
In addition to fungal components, CLRs also recognize struc-
tures present on mycobacteria (Ishikawa et al., 2009; Lobato-
Pascual et al., 2013; Miyake et al., 2013; Schoenen et al., 2010),
viruses such as dengue virus (Chen et al., 2008), and parasites
such as Schistosoma mansoni (Ritter et al., 2010), as well as
endogenous ligands under sterile inflammatory conditions (Roth
and Ruland, 2013). We therefore believe that our findings have
implications beyond antifungal immunity. Consistent with this hy-
pothesis, Vav1/2/3�/� mice were almost completely impaired in
systemic inflammatory responses upon innate immune stimula-
tion with the mycobacterial pathogen-associated molecular pat-
terns (PAMP) analog TDM, implying that, like Card9 (Dorhoi
et al., 2010), Vav proteins might also be critical for innate anti-
mycobacterial immune responses. In addition, accumulating evi-
dence indicates important rolesforCLR/Card9 signalingin inflam-
matory disorders. Several independent studies have shown an
(F and G) BMDCs from mice of the indicated genotypes were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 30 min and then stimulated with curdlan

 association between Card9 polymorphisms and ulcerative colitis
and Crohn’s disease (Roth and Ruland, 2013), which are sup-
ported by a recent study in mice demonstrating a protective role
for Card9 in intestinal inflammation (Sokol et al., 2013). Deep re-
sequencing of inflammatory bowel disease genome-wide associ-
ation study (GWAS) loci confirmed an association between Card9
and ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (Beaudoin et al., 2013;
Hong etal., 2016).Moreover,additional genome-wideassociation
studies in humans have identified significant associations be-
tween CARD9 and VAV3 gene loci and immunoglobulin A (IgA)
nephropathy (Kiryluk et al., 2014). In conjunction with the results
presented here, these data suggest that the described Vav/
Card9-dependent signaling mechanism could also play a role in
sterile inflammatory diseases.

Figure 5. A VAV3 Polymorphism Is Associated with Increased Susceptibility to Candidemia
(A) Polymorphisms associated with candidemia were investigated in a group of 227 patients with Candida-positive blood cultures and compared with 176
patients from the same clinical wards without infection. SNPs associated with the VAV3 locus revealed a significant association with candidemia, with the
significant SNPs distributed across the LD region of the gene. The VAV3 gene region on chromosome 1 is shown. Using the SNAP server, the SNP of interest
(rs4914950) (biggest orange diamond) was plotted with all annotated polymorphisms in this gene (other diamonds). R2 and recombination rate are indicated on
the left and right y axis, respectively. Diamonds on the same horizontal line as the SNP of interest (biggest orange diamond) are in complete linkage disequilibrium
(R2 = 1) with this SNP and have the same disease association values. Diamonds below this line have a lower LD value with the SNP of interest and, therefore, differ
in the association with the disease. The table below shows the top 15 polymorphisms that are linked to rs4914950.

 Malt1�/� (Ruland et al., 2003), and Malt1PM/- (Gewies et al., 2014) mice were
described previously. Vav double-deficient (Vav2/3�/�) and triple-deficient
(Vav1/2/3�/�) mice were generated by intercrossings of Vav single knockout
animals and were provided by X.R.B. and V.L.T.. All animal work was conduct-
ed in accordance with German federal animal protection laws and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Technical University of
Munich. Animals were used at 8–16 weeks of age.
Cell Culture and Stimulation
BMDCs were derived from bone marrow as described previously (Gross et al.,
2006) and stimulated with curdlan (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries), LPS (ul-
trapure, from Escherichia coli strain K12, InvivoGen), Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen),
Dectin-2 monoclonal antibody (AbD Serotec), Rat IgG2a isotype control (R&D
Systems), TDB (Avanti Polar Lipids), or C. albicans strain SC5314 as indicated.
For tyrosine kinase or proteasome inhibition, the Syk inhibitor R406 (Rigel), the
Src kinase inhibitor PP2 or its inactive analog PP3 (both from Calbiochem),
or MG132 (Sigma) were used. Cell culture reagents were purchased from
Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from HyClone.
Mouse recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was
purchased from PeproTech.
Cytokine Measurement
Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA (BD Biosciences and eBioscience) or
by cytometric bead array (CBA; BD Biosciences) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis
Cell lysates or cell supernatants were subjected to standard immunoblot anal-
ysis techniques as described previously (Strasser et al., 2012). Cytosolic and
nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (Ferch et al., 2007).
For immunoprecipitation experiments, BMDCs were left unstimulated or stim-
ulated with C. albicans as indicated and lysed in an NP-40-containing buffer.
Lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with protein G Sepharose (GE Health-
care 4 Fast Flow) and then incubated with anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies.
Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G Sepharose and sub-
jected to protein immunoblotting as indicated. Quantification of immunoblots
was performed by densitometry using ImageJ software. Densitometry data
were expressed relative to levels of appropriate loading controls and normal-
ized to specific treatment conditions.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed and graphed using Excel (Microsoft Office) and Prism
(GraphPad). For comparison between two groups, two-tailed Student’s t
test was used. Analysis across more than two groups on a single dataset
was performed using one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey-Kramer test. Sur-
vival data were analyzed using the log-rank test. Genotype frequencies be-
tween controls and candidemia patients were compared using the c2 test.
The level of significance was defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
