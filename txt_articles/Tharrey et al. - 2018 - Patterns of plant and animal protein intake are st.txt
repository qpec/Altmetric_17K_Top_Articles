Abstract
Background: Current evidence suggests that plant and animal proteins are intimately
associated with specific large nutrient clusters that may explain part of their complex re-
lation with cardiovascular health. We aimed at evaluating the association between spe-
cific patterns of protein intake with cardiovascular mortality.
Methods: We selected 81 337 men and women from the Adventist Health Study-2. Diet
was assessed between 2002 and 2007, by using a validated food frequency questionnaire.
Dietary patterns based on the participants’ protein consumption were derived by factor
analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard
ratios (HRs) adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary components.
Results: There were 2276 cardiovascular deaths during a mean follow-up time of
9.4 years. The HRs for cardiovascular mortality were 1.61 [98.75% confidence interval
(CI), 1.12 2.32; P-trend < 0.001] for the ‘Meat’ protein factor and 0.60 (98.75% CI, 0.42 0.86;
P-trend < 0.001) for the ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factor (highest vs lowest quintile of factor
scores). No significant associations were found for the ‘Grains’, ‘Processed Foods’ and
‘Legumes, Fruits & Vegetables’ protein factors. Additional adjustments for the partici-
pants’ vegetarian dietary pattern and nutrients related to cardiovascular disease out-
comes did not change the results.
Conclusions: Associations between the ‘Meat’ and ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factors and
cardiovascular outcomes were strong and could not be ascribed to other associated nu-
trients considered to be important for cardiovascular health. Healthy diets can be advo-
cated based on protein sources, preferring low contributions of protein from meat and
higher intakes of plant protein from nuts and seeds.

 Introduction
Recently, the eco-environmental sustainability of a diet
containing high amounts of animal protein has been ques-
tioned, and it is thought that plant as an alternative to ani-
mal proteins will lead to more eco-friendly results.1–4
Numerous observational and interventional studies have
investigated how plant and animal protein may differen-
tially affect CVD risk factors and mortality, given that car-
diovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death
worldwide.5 However, evidence for a beneficial effect of
plant proteins is mixed.6 Limited and inconsistent results
highlight the probable role of confounding by non-protein
dietary components, and possibly also relate to the associ-
ation between dietary protein sources and diet quality.6,7
Dietary proteins are not consumed in isolation but are
embedded in complex food matrices as a part of the overall
diet. In particular, each protein food group provides other
specific non-protein compounds that can also affect cardio-
vascular health.6 Thus, a simple analysis of dietary protein
intake as from plant or animal sources may be too broad,
and greater consideration of specific protein food sources
and the background diet is required to accurately assess as-
sociations with CVD risk factors and mortality.8
Analysis of dietary patterns—using factor analysis—has
proven effective to study the multidimensionality of diet
and to give more insight into the relations between diet
and disease.9–11 This approach uses the correlations be-
tween food and nutrient intakes to derive non-correlated
factors that describe general patterns that might be easier
for the public to interpret and translate into relevant policy
and guidance. Following the same approach, dietary pro-
tein patterns can be identified by analysing the intakes of
protein from a variety of food sources. This approach over-
comes the high correlation between protein groups and can
identify the fundamental characteristics of a healthy pro-
tein pattern. The aim of this study was to examine the as-
sociations
between
patterns
of
protein
intake
and
cardiovascular mortality in the Adventist Health Study-2
(AHS-2) cohort. We hypothesized that the dietary protein
patterns that are identified may differentially affect cardio-
vascular health. We further investigated whether these
associations were influenced by other general characteris-
tics of the diet, including vegetarian dietary patterns and
specific nutrients.
Methods
Study population
The Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) is a population-
based longitudinal study of more than 96 000 Seventh-day
Adventist church men and women living in the USA and
Canada, recruited between 2002 and 2007. The methods
used for the cohort formation and its characteristics have
been described elsewhere.12 The AHS-2 was approved by
the institutional review board of Loma Linda University
and written consent was obtained from all participants at
enrolment. Exclusion criteria for the present analyses were
age < 25 years (n¼ 226); estimated energy intake (not
including write-in items) < 500 kcal/d or > 4500 kcal/d or
improbable response patterns (e.g., identical responses to all
questions on a page or more than 69 missing values in diet-
ary data) (n¼ 5840); body mass index (BMI) < 14kg/m2 or
> 60 kg/m2 (n ¼ 2539); and self-reported history of cardio-
vascular events at baseline (n ¼ 6182) (see flow diagram in
Supplementary Figure 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). After these exclusions, 81 337 participants
remained for analysis.
Mortality data
Deaths through 31 December 2013 were identified by bi-
ennial follow-up of participants and linkage with the
National Death Index. The underlying cause of death was
coded using the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision
(ICD-10). CVD deaths were identified as those starting
with the letter I.
Dietary assessment and covariable data
Usual dietary intake during the previous year was assessed
through the baseline questionnaire using a quantitative
Key Messages
• Plant and animal proteins are heterogeneously associated with CVD mortality.
• Protein-based factor analysis showed that a high contribution of protein from meat increased risk of CVD mortality,
whereas a high contribution of protein from nuts and seeds is protective.
• These associations were not influenced by other characteristics of the diet, such as vegetarian dietary patterns or
nutrients related to CVD outcomes.

 food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Detailed descriptions
of the methods of dietary measurement using the question-
naire and its validation against six 24-h recalls have been
described elsewhere.13,14 Animal protein had de-attenu-
ated correlations of 0.68 and 0.76 in Blacks and Whites,
respectively. Plant protein had de-attenuated correlation of
0.57 in both races. A guided multiple-imputation approach
was used to fill out missing data in the dietary variables.15
Other sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were also as-
sessed by the baseline questionnaire. The vegetarian status
of participants was identified according to their reported
intake of foods of animal origin and classified to five cate-
gories
(vegan,
lacto-ovo-vegetarian,
pesco-vegetarian,
semi-vegetarian, non-vegetarian).16
Identification of animal and plant protein categories
Classification of food items from the FFQ into animal and
plant protein categories is described in Supplementary
Methods 1, available as Supplementary data at IJE online.
Animal protein groups were defined as coming from the
following sources: red meat, processed meat, poultry, sea-
food, milk, yogurt, cheese, animal fats (to capture low
amounts of proteins in cream and butter) and egg prod-
ucts. Plant proteins were defined as coming from: grains,
soya, legumes, peanuts, tree nuts and seeds, potatoes,
fruits, vegetables, other vegetables (e.g. condiments, spices
etc.).17 Protein contents of food items having a single
source of protein were directly assigned to the correspond-
ing protein group. Otherwise, representative recipes were
developed and the amount of protein from each constitu-
ent ingredient was then assigned to the appropriate protein
group. To evaluate the errors originating from the created
recipes, we calculated the difference in the amount of pro-
tein between the original item and that calculated from the
summed protein of the ingredients. We also calculated
total protein intake before and after the breakdown of
foods to their constituents.
Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazard regressions were used in prelim-
inary analyses to determine associations between protein
intake coming from plant or animal sources and the risk of
CVD mortality. Length of follow-up was used as the time
variable, terminated either by death or by censoring. For
these analyses, plant and animal protein were mutually ad-
justed. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were calculated
for 18-g increases of plant or animal protein intake, corres-
ponding to �1/4 of total protein intake. Plant and animal
protein intakes were adjusted for total energy according to
the residual method.18
Protein intake from each of the 18 protein food groups
was expressed as the percentage of total protein intake (%
kcal). Protein dietary patterns were then generated by factor
analyses using the PROC FACTOR procedure in SAS.
Factors were extracted using the principal component
method, and an orthogonal transformation (Varimax rota-
tion) was further applied to achieve a simpler structure with
greater interpretability. To determine the number of factors
to retain, we considered eigenvalues >1,19 a breakpoint in
the Scree test20 and the interpretability of the factors.21 For
each food group, loadings for factors represented the correl-
ation between the food groups and a factor. The protein diet-
ary patterns were labelled according to food groups that
made major contributions to the factor (absolute value of
factor loading >0.20). Factor scores for each protein dietary
pattern were calculated for each subject by summing the per-
centage of protein intake from each food group weighted by
that food group’s factor loading.22 Participants were then
grouped into quintiles of factor scores.
The specific effects of the identified protein factors on
cause-specific CVD mortality [i.e. ischaemic heart disease)
IHD and stroke separately] were identified using Cox pro-
portional hazard regression analyses. Different models of
increasing complexity were tested to investigate the effect of
adjustment for additional potential confounding factors
identified by the analyses and from the existing literature.
Model 1 was adjusted for mean-centred age, sex, race and
energy intake, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, alco-
hol consumption, education, personal income and marital
status. Because the source of dietary protein is also related to
vegetarian dietary patterns,23 the second model was further
adjusted for the traditional five vegetarian-spectrum dietary
categories. In the third and fourth models, we replaced the
vegetarian dietary pattern identifiers with other nutrients
that are often related to CVD outcomes. Model 3 was ad-
justed for saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids,24,25
fibre,26,27 sodium,28,29 vitamin B6, B12, folates30,31 and anti-
oxidants (vitamins A, C, E).32 Model 4 was further adjusted
for fat from meat products (fish excluded)33 and fat from
nuts.34 Differences in the associations between factors and
CVD mortality by age, sex, race and BMI were evaluated by
testing possible interaction terms. The robustness of the a
posteriori approach (using factors) was further checked by
an a priori analysis, based on methods typically used to cre-
ate a priori scores of adherence to a dietary profile.35 Five
scores were created to compare to the five dietary profiles
that are the object of the main a posteriori approach here
conducted. Details can be found in Supplementary Table 4,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online. The Cox pro-
portional hazards assumption was evaluated using tests and
plots based on the Schoenfeld residuals. We tested for pos-
sible nonlinear relationships between protein factors and

 mortality using stepwise restricted cubic spline analysis.36 All
analyses were performed with the SAS statistical software
package V. 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA). A P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
Results
Associations between plant and animal protein
intake and CVD mortality
Among 81 337 participants followed for < 12 years (me-
dian follow up of 9.9 years), 2276 deaths were identified as
due to CVDs. After controlling for several potential con-
founders, an 18-g increase in animal protein intake was
significantly associated with a slightly higher risk of CVD
mortality in models further controlling for the type of vege-
tarian diet or for a set of nutrients related to CVD risk
(Table 1). No significant associations were found with
plant protein intake.
Identification of dietary patterns
The difference between the total protein intake as calcu-
lated after breakdown using recipe ingredients and the ori-
ginal intake was 0.01 6 0.15%. Factor analysis retained
five main protein factors, which explained 47.2% of the
total variance (Table 2). A Scree plot displaying the
eigenvalues is shown in Supplementary Figure 2, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online. As shown in Table 2,
the factor labels—‘Grains’, ‘Processed Foods’, ‘Meat’,
‘Legumes, Fruits & Vegetables’ (‘LFV’) and ‘Nuts &
Seeds’, respectively—were taken directly from foods with
correspondingly heavy weightings. Participants with high
factor scores for the ‘Grains’ protein factor had on average
43.8% of their protein intake coming from grains (see
Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Factor 2 was labelled ‘Processed Foods’,
since it was characterized by high loadings for proteins
from cheese, animal fat, eggs, potatoes and milk, which
came mostly from processed products in our database. The
average percentages of protein intake by food group for
the five protein factors are given in Supplementary
Table 1, available as Supplementary data at IJE online.
Characteristics of population
Baseline characteristics of the study participants across
quintiles of the identified protein factors are given in
Table 3. For instance, subjects in the upper quintile for the
‘Meat’ or ‘Processed Foods’ protein factors tended to have
greater BMIs and to be more physically inactive, and were
more likely to be smokers and current alcohol consumers
(Ps < 0.001) compared with those in the lower quintile,
whereas opposite trends were found for the ‘Grains’,
‘LFV’ and ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factors. The vegetarian
status of participants and intakes of various nutrients
across protein factors are presented in Supplementary
Tables 2 and 3, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online.
Associations between dietary protein factors and
CVD mortality
Table 4 shows HRs of CVD mortality according to quin-
tiles of the identified protein factors. Restricted cubic
spline analyses did not identify evidence of nonlinearity in
any of these associations. Significant age-interactions were
found for the ‘Meat’ and ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factors
and for BMI. After multiple adjustments for lifestyle con-
founders (Model 1), subjects belonging to the fifth quintile
of the ‘Meat’ protein factor had a 61% higher risk of CVD
death compared with those in the first quintile. By con-
trast, participants in the high quintile of ‘Nuts & Seeds’
protein factor had a 40% lower CVD mortality risk. No
significant associations were found for the ‘Grains’,
‘Processed Foods’ and ‘LFV’ protein factors. After add-
itional adjustment on the five vegetarian categories, or for
other nutrients that are related to CVD outcomes, the esti-
mates changed very little (Models 2 and 3). Further

 adjustment on fat from meat products and fat from nuts
somewhat attenuated the associations for the ‘Meat’ fac-
tor, but left the nut protein result unchanged. The analysis
based on the a priori method (using scores) showed good
agreement with the a posteriori approach (using factors;
see Supplementary Table 4, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). The CVD deaths identified in the popu-
lation
consisted
mainly
of
ischaemic
heart
diseases
(37.8%), other forms of heart disease (24.2%) and cere-
brovascular diseases (23.7%). Sensitivity analysis showed
clear trends in the expected directions when investigating
associations between the factors and IHD and stroke sep-
arately, although these were not statistically significant
(data not shown).
Since significant interaction terms were found be-
tween ‘Meat’ and ‘Nuts & Seeds’ factors and age, HRs
across age categories were estimated (Figure 1). Strong
associations between these protein factors and CVD
death were found among young adults aged 25–44 (2-
fold higher risk for the ‘Meat’ protein factor and almost
3-fold lower risk for the ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factor).
However, the strength of these associations decreased
with increasing age and were no longer apparent by age
80 and above.
Discussion
In the present study, a thorough analysis of specific protein
dietary factors, derived by factor analysis, disclosed clearly
contrasting associations of specific animal and plant pro-
tein factors on CVD outcomes. Our results show that high
scores on the ‘Meat’ protein factor are associated with
increased risk of CVD mortality, whereas high scores on
the ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factor are associated with lower
risk. When considering protein intake only divided into
plant and animal sources, we found a weak positive associ-
ation between animal protein intake and CVD mortality
and no association for the plant proteins. These results em-
phasize that general statements about plant or animal pro-
tein may lack specificity, and that greater consideration of
specific protein food sources and patterns is required, as
had been proposed by some authors.6 Specific characteris-
tics and lifestyles of the population, different types of diet-
ary substitution and the background diets have made it
difficult to clearly ascribe benefits to the type and source of
protein and likely contributed to the lack of conclusive evi-
dence relating animal and plant protein consumption to
CVD risk.8,37–40

single food group (e.g. total meat) or energy-based patterns
(e.g. Western diet), and did not explicitly consider protein
content and sources. Here we focused on factor analyses to
find protein variables that in our data were approximately
independent. Without strong a priori hypotheses that
focused on proteins from a particular source, this was use-
ful to further define the protein structure of our data.
In fact these factors clearly weighted heavily on easily rec-
ognized dietary sources. Furthermore, we found similar re-
sults in relation to CVD risk when we compared with an a
priori approach based on scores, which supports the valid-
ity of our approach. Previous studies have also investigated
different dietary patterns that could be interpreted by

 account for the favourable CVD and type 2 diabetes out-
comes associated with this diet.45–47 However, to our
knowledge, protein-based factor analysis is novel and
offers a specific insight into the underlying eating patterns
that combine a variety of protein food sources. Further, it
may offer practical conclusions about the likely value of se-
lecting proteins from different food sources. As each factor
is independent one from the other by construction, the
models avoid the multicollinearity that is found when ana-
lysing protein groups individually. Thus the association of
each factor with CVD mortality is more easily interpret-
able. The interpretation of the factors may still, however,
be limited by the fact that they are associated in a complex
way with vegetarian diets or other nutrients consumed
along with these protein sources (i.e. certain protein types
may act as markers of healthy diets). Nevertheless, after
controlling for the five vegetarian-spectrum dietary catego-
ries and several nutrients (including dietary fatty acids)
thought to be related to CVD outcomes, significant associ-
ations persisted between the protein dietary factors and
CVD mortality. This strengthens the idea that these ana-
lyses have captured unique aspects of protein-based pat-
terns, which are attributable to the protein per se. In
particular, the ‘Nuts & Seeds’ protein factor appeared to
be associated with the quality of the diet even across
different levels of plant-based dietary patterns in this popu-
lation, suggesting that focusing on more specific plant
protein-based diets may improve the ability of dietary rec-
ommendations to prevent CVD.
Based on our findings, its appears that choices of dietary
protein that favour nuts and seeds compared with meat
could be an effective means of reducing the risk of CVD
deaths under causal hypotheses, and could be considered
for future guidance in dietary public health recommenda-
tions. Among potential mechanisms, the amino acid com-
position of specific foods may affect CVD health by their
specific physiological effects. Previous studies have re-
ported an inverse relation of dietary glutamic acid intake
with blood pressure. This is an amino acid predominant in
plant protein.48,49 Nuts also provide a high content of
L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, known to play fun-
damental role in vascular health.50,51 In addition, glycine
may be an important contributor to a direct relationship of
meat products with blood pressure.52
We found that the significant associations between the
protein dietary factors and CVD mortality tended to
weaken with age. Among possible explanations, it is likely
that participants who have reached an advanced age with-
out experiencing any previous cardiovascular events may
possess constitutional advantages, and modifiable CVD

tein factors (P ¼ 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). HRs were estimated at the mean age of each age category. All confidence intervals were calculated
to reflect the 98.75% confidence interval range (following Bonferroni corrections with significance criterion being 0.05/4, i.e. 0.0125 for each quintile).

 risk factors such as diet, then, have proportionately less in-
fluence on CVD health outcomes. It is significant for public
health that the protein factors appear to show very strong
associations with premature CVD risk, as early deaths rep-
resent large losses of productive years of life.
Our study has potential limitations. First, reporting bias
in self-reported dietary assessment and other lifestyle-
related data is inevitable, but as these biases are expected
to be non-differential they would usually bias toward the
null. More importantly, diet was assessed only at baseline
and may have changed over time. Second, missing re-
sponses in the FFQ were filled by multiple imputation.
Nonetheless, multiple imputation does not create bias
under the assumption that errors are missing at random.
This assumption was approximately satisfied here by the
use of guided multiple imputation.15,53 Finally, although
appropriate adjustments for confounding factors were per-
formed, unknown and unmeasured confounders are al-
ways possible. Notably, the contribution of other plant
food components intimately related to protein intake, such
as phytochemicals, may also be relevant.54 Strengths of
this study include the large number of participants and a
relatively long follow-up period allowing the accumulation
of many cardiovascular deaths, and also the diversity of
dietary habits in this population leading to the identifica-
tion of a wide range of protein food sources.
Conclusion
Our study appears to identify heterogeneous associations
of certain plant and animal proteins with CVD risk. Strong
associations were found between CVD outcomes and the
animal protein factor that weighted heavily on meat prod-
ucts, whereas a specific plant protein factor weighting on
nuts and seeds was associated with a lower risk of CVD
mortality. These relationships were mostly apparent before
old age, thus impacting on premature CVD death. This
strengthens the idea that protein sources may be key com-
ponents of diet quality, possibly largely independent of
other confounders, including vegetarian diet categories.
Associations of these dietary protein factors with CVD
death cannot be easily ascribed to their correlations with
other nutrients considered important for cardiovascular
health. Our results suggest that healthy choices can be
advocated based on protein sources, specifically preferring
diets low in meat intake and with a higher intake of plant
proteins from nuts and seeds.
