The integral selectivity characteristic of the blood brain barrier (BBB) limits therapeutic options 
for many neurologic diseases and disorders. Currently, very little is known about the mechanisms 
that govern the dynamic nature of the BBB. Recent reports have focused on the development and 
application of human brain organoids developed from neuro-progenitor cells. While these models 
provide an excellent platform to study the effects of disease and genetic aberrances on brain 
development, they may not model the microvasculature and BBB of the adult human cortex. To date, 
most in vitro BBB models utilize endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. We report a 3D spheroid 
model of the BBB comprising all major cell types, including neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, 
to recapitulate more closely normal human brain tissue. Spheroids show expression of tight junctions, 
adherens junctions, adherens junction-associated proteins and cell specific markers. Functional 
assessment using MPTP, MPP+ and mercury chloride indicate charge selectivity through the barrier. 
Junctional protein distribution was altered under hypoxic conditions. Our spheroid model may have 
potential applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity testing.
Over a million adults are annually diagnosed with brain diseases or disorders in the US alone1. The Alzheimer’s 
Association reported that in 2016, the national cost for dementias was approximately $236 billion2. A major 
contributor to this high treatment cost is the late stage failure of promising drug candidates. Only 8% of central 
nervous system drug candidates that reach initial Phase 1 human safety testing eventually achieve regulatory 
approval due to either toxicity or ineffectiveness3. This estimate does not include the number of initially promis-
ing treatments pursued during pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies3. The shortage of effective therapies and low 
success rate of investigational drugs are in part due to the lack of human equivalent models4. Some current 2D 
systems may not accurately mimic human physiology because they do not possess the three dimensional organi-
zation of tissues, and often consist of cell lines, lacking physiologically relevant ratios of all cell types present in the 
organ5,6. More recently established 3D blood brain barrier (BBB) models have provided an understanding of size 
exclusion, selectivity and many other important aspects such as the expression of efflux and transport of proteins. 
Urich et al. reported the successful assembly of human primary astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells into a 
BBB−
 like model7. Cho et al. went on to characterize the BBB properties of a similar model8.
The formation, maintenance and function of the BBB in the human neurovascular unit (NVU) depend on 
highly specific intercellular interactions within the human brain: specifically, the association between pericytes 
and blood vessels and how they regulate human brain endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration, dif-
ferentiation, and vascular branching9. This signifies direct pericyte-endothelial interactions in the lumen and 
their crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB in the human neurovascular unit10,11. The interaction 
between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and the direct influence of astrocyte on the integrity of the BBB are also 
well documented12–15, There is a significant body of evidence, in both in vitro and in vivo systems, highlighting 
astrocyte interactions with the cerebral endothelium and the ways in which they help determine BBB function,

morphology, and protein expression16–19. Microglia also play a critical role in BBB regulation and modulation 
of tight junction expression. They in turn have complex integrations in brain diseases such as epilepsy, ischemic 
stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders20. Furthermore, neurons are known to induce BBB related enzymes21. 
Therefore, the inclusion of the major human NVU cell types in an in vitro organoid model would be helpful in 
predicting human physiologic conditions.
A natural progression from the currently established BBB models would be to define the effect of chemical 
agents on all the cell types that are critical to the normal function of a human NVU, including the microglia, 
oligodendrocytes and neurons that are adjacent to the BBB, and to further understand the intercellular dynamics 
once molecules cross the barrier. Therefore, the development of a 3D in vitro system that contains all major cell 
types found in adult human brain cortex may provide a platform that can be used to understand the fundamental 
principles at play with the BBB, its function, and also to understand the effects of chemical substances that cross 
the BBB.
Here we report the development of a human neurovascular unit organoid model that contains the six con-
stituent cell types found within the brain cortex: human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), human 
pericytes (HBVP), human astrocytes (HA), human microglia (HM), human oligodendrocytes (HO) and human 
neurons (HN), with endothelial cells enclosing the brain parenchymal cells. Cells derived from induced pluri-
potent stem cell (iPSC) sources (HM, HO, and HN) were utilized in several instances to establish potential 
patient-specific and disease applications. We validated the expression of tight junctions, adherens junctions and 
transport proteins, and showed that this model can be used in toxicity assessment studies for molecules that have 
the potential to cross or open the BBB. Neurotoxicity screening was assessed with the effects of mercury chloride, 
MPTP and MPP+. In addition, a model of the blood brain barrier during clinical ischemia was established show-
ing physiologic responses under hypoxic conditions.
Results
Confirmation of Assembly with Barrier Formation. 
Prior publications have shown the assembly of 
three cell types: primary human astrocytes, human pericytes, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells7. 
To demonstrate the assembly and cellular organization of organoids with four cell types, HBMECs, HPs, HAs, and 
human neuronal cells (HCN-2) were pre-treated with long-term cell labeling dye. The four cell types were placed 
into a mixture containing a ratio of 1:1:5:6, respectively. The cell mixture was placed in a hanging drop culture 
environment. After 96 hrs of culture, assembled organoids were lowered and confocal microscopy images con-
firmed HBMEC and HBVP localization to the periphery of the organoid, with HA localized near the surface, and 
neuronal cells forming the core (Fig. 1A). We evaluated the presence of a BBB in our organoid model by testing 
the expression of BBB tight junction protein ZO-1, which was identified with immunofluorescent labelling and 
confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B).
Figure 1. Assessment of cell localization, tight junction protein expression, and barrier properties in self-
assembled spheroids. Spheroids in (A) show self organisation of endothelial cells and pericytes to the outermost 
sphere whereas the astrocytes and neurons (violet) are encapsulated by the endothelial cells and pericytes.  
(B) Spheroids containing HBMEC, astrocytes, and pericytes were formed through self assembly. Shown is 
ZO-1, a tight junction protein that prevents free paracellular transport of molecules across the vascular-type 
barrier. Dapi (blue) shows nuclear staining. Also shown in the figure are empty pockets where there is no ZO-1, 
this indicates that the HBMECs are likely not completely covering the spheroid. (C) Permeability assessment 
was done through incubating the spheroids containing HBMEC, pericytes and astrocytes with FITC labeled 
IgG. The upper panel represents spheroids with an uncompromised vascular-type barrier (control) and the 
lower panel shows spheroids that were treated with histamine to transiently open the vascular-type barrier.

We characterized the integrity and dynamic properties of the barrier formed in the organoids containing 
HBMEC, HBVP and HA by assessing FITC-labelled IgG permeability across the BBB. IgG permeability was first 
evaluated in untreated organoids. We then assessed IgG permeability in organoids pretreated with histamine. 
Histamine is a chemical agent known to transiently open the BBB22–24. Qualitative analysis through confocal 
microscopy showed higher FITC fluorescence at the core of treated organoids (Fig. 1C) compared to untreated 
organoids (Fig. 1C). This experiment shows that a type of vascular barrier was present. In order to specify BBB 
characteristics, we conducted further experiments using a small molecule as will be discussed below. A small 
amount of IgG was able to be visualized within the three cell-type organoid core in untreated organoids. The 
effects observed here could be attributed to incomplete coverage of endothelial cells.
Six Cell Type Human Cortical Organoid. 
We constructed organoids containing HBMECs, HBVP, HA, 
HM, HO and HN using a single self-assembly method to assess the interaction of all 6 cell types. The organoids 
Figure 2. Six cell-type spheroid Characterization. Live-Dead Staining was conducted on days 5 (A), 7 (B), 10 
(C), and 21 (D) to assess cell viability. Green represents live cells and red indicates dead cells; In each case, 8 
randomly selected spheroids were assed for cell viability. (E) Green florescence for live cells was quantified and 
expressed as a percentage of the total fluorescence (red and green). Immunohistochemistry was conducted on 
spheroids to determine phenotypic protein expression. CD31 expression (F) shows localization of HBMEC 
in self-assembled spheroids. Even though the cells migrate to the outer sphere, the endothelial cells do not 
cover the spheroid. Expression of claudin-5 (G, red) was established through immunofluorescent staining. 
Expression of P-gp in G and Q (an efflux protein responsible for the efflux of xenobiotic substances out of the 
brain tissue) was established in self –assembly and staged self-assembly spheroids, respectively. Self-assembly 
spheroids were stained for ZO-1 (H) and DAPI (blue). Selected area was imaged at higher magnification in 
order to visualize the cell border connections formed by ZO-1 (I). Specific cell markers were used to identify 
normal protein expression in individual cell type incorporated into the spheroid made through a staged self-
assembly: (J) showing CD31 staining signifying that the HBMEC cover the spheroid in a staged self-assembly, 
PDGFR (K) an pericyte marker, GFAP (L) an astrocyte marker, Iba1 (M) a microglial marker, N O4 and MBP 
markers of oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes respectively. MAP2 (O) is a neuronal 
marker. Neuronal spheroids were stained for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (P) to identify the presence of dopaminergic 
neurons. Transmembrane glucose transporter and efflux transporter protein expression and localization were 
established by staining for P-gp (Q) and GLUT1 (R) respectively. All markers were found to have a thorough 
distribution. Images were obtained at 10x magnification. Scale bars are depicted in white. Scale bars, 200 μ

maintained very high cell viability for up to 21 days in vitro (Fig. 2A–E). Cell viability, was uniform in all Z-stacked 
slices utilized in quantitative data presented. There were no apparent differences observed between the core and 
the outer surface as visualized through confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining for the HBMEC marker 
CD31 to identify endothelial cell coverage in these assembled organoids showed that the endothelial cells local-
ized to the outer surface of the organoid (Fig. 2F). We identified the expression of tight junction proteins: ZO-1 
and Claudin-5 (Fig. 2G–I). The endothelial cells, however, did not fully cover the outer surface of the organoids. 
This is shown with sections on organoids not staining for tight junction proteins ZO-1, and claudin-5, and CD31 
(Fig. 2F–H). In order to increase endothelial coverage on the surface of the organoids, we utilized a staging 
method of organoid assembly. HBMVECs and HBVP were added 48 hrs after forming organoids with the 4 cell 
types (HA, HM, HO, and HN), which allowed for a more cohesive coating of the organoid surface. This method 
is henceforth designated as the staged assembly method.
Organoid Characterization. 
Organoids were constructed using the staged assembly method and stained 
positively for cell specific markers, CD 31 for HBMVEC (Fig. 2J), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta 
(PDGFR) for pericytes25 (Fig. 2K), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), marker for astrocytes (Fig. 2L)26, ionized 
calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) for microglia27 (Fig. 2M), myelin basic protein (MBP) and O4 for 
oligodendrocytes28 (Fig. 2N), and MAP2 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) for mature and dopaminergic neurons 
(Fig. 2O and P), respectively. TH staining performed on neuronal spheroids may overstate the proportion of 
TH+ neurons in assembled organoids with all cell types. The proportion of TH+ neurons in organoids contain-
ing all cell types could be inferred from the MAP2 positive cells in 6 cell type organoid showing the presence of 
mature neurons. Together, these cells act in concert to enhance the function of the BBB, thereby maintaining 
brain homeostasis in humans29. Permeability –glycoprotein (P-gp; Fig. 2Q) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1; 
Fig. 2R) are transport proteins that play major roles in the BBB. While, GLUT1 allows for glucose transport across 
the BBB30,31, P-gp prevents exogenous chemical substances from entering the brain parenchyma32. Furthermore, 
junctional complexes, mainly the tight and adherens junction proteins between HBMECs prevent paracellu-
lar diffusion of foreign substances into the brain tissue33–35. Through immunofluorescent staining and confocal 
microscopy, we identified the expression of major tight junction proteins ZO-1 (Fig. 3A) and claudin-5 (Fig. 3B). 
Adherens junction proteins such as VE-cadherin are anchored by associative protein β
-catenin36.
Β
-catenin signaling stabilizes adherens junction proteins and hence promotes BBB maturation. Even though 
β
- catenin retention at the plasma membrane by cadherins reduces the pool of free β
-catenin available for nuclear 
shuttling to promote expression of genes such as claudin-337, GLUT-138, platelet derived growth factor B39, and 
P-gp40,41, it is critical to note that β
-catenin shuttling in the nucleus represses claudin-5 gene expression36. Thus, 
β
-catenin localization at the plasma membrane is crucial for enhancing BBB maturation through VE-cadherin 
stabilization and allowing claudin-5 gene expression. We established that β
-catenin localized at the plasma mem-
brane in the organoids (Fig. 3C) and VE-cadherin was expressed (Fig. 3D).
Hypoxia affects junctional protein distribution. 
One of the primary drivers behind neurologic injury 
in instances of ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury is cell hypoxia42,43. Mark and Davis showed that hypoxia 
induces permeability and changes in the organization of tight junctions using a 2D transwell system44. Here, we 
report for the first time physiologic changes of junctional protein distribution in a multicellular 3D brain microvas-
cular equivalent tissue organoid during pathological insult. In order to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the expres-
sion and distribution of tight junction proteins and adherens associated protein, organoids containing all 6 cell 
types were incubated at 37 °C, 0.1% oxygen and 99.9% nitrogen for 24 hr in an Xvivo System G300C (BioSpherix, 
Redfield, NY, USA). Another group of organoids were cultured at normoxic conditions for comparison. Organoids 
were subsequently fixed and immunostained for claudin-5, ZO-1, β
-catenin, and VE-cadherin. Claudin-5, 
ZO-1, β
-catenin and VE-cadherin localization is normal under normoxic conditions (Fig. 3E,G,I and K); 
 
however, their localization is disrupted under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3F–G). Caludin-5, ZO-1, β
-catenin and 
VE-cadherin fluorescence pixels were quantified using ImageJ (National Institute of Health) and were normalized 
to DAPI fluorescence in each section. ZO-1 and claudin-5 was reduced under hypoxic conditions. The differ-
ences, however, were not signficant compared with normoxic conditions (Fig. 3M). We observed a signficant 
reduction in the relative amount of β
-catenin (P = 0.0012) and VE-cadherin (P = 0.0079) under hypoxic condi-
tions compared with normoxic conditions (Fig. 3M).
BBB charge selectivity assessment by evaluating inorganic mercury toxicity. 
Evaluation of the 
organoid model’s application to neurotoxicity was then undertaken through the assessment of inorganic mercury 
toxicity. Selenium depletion by mercury causes irreversible inhibition of the selenoenzymes that play a critical 
role in restoring Vitamin C, E and other anti-oxidant molecules back to their reduced forms45,46. Vitamin C and 
E are reducing agents and antioxidants that act as cofactors in reactions catalyzed by Cu+-dependent monooxy-
genases and Fe2+-dependent dioxygenases. Mostly, the production of reactive oxygen species is accentuated in 
brain cells because of the high rate of oxygen consumption in the brain47. These high amounts of reactive oxygen 
species inevitably make brain cells vulnerable to oxidative damage. Thus, brain cells heavily depend on the antiox-
idant protection provided by selenoenzymes. Brain cell dysfunction and death during prolonged or high mercury 
exposure is attributed to cellular selenium sequestration by mercury48. Selenium is needed for the biosynthesis 
of critical enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme that prevents and reverses oxidative damage45,46,48. 
Mercury I salts are less toxic than mercury II salts because they are less soluble. Mercury II salts do not cross the 
BBB despite their high solubility48. This makes mercury II salts ideal candidates for validating the charge selectiv-
ity function of the BBB in models.
We constructed organoids containing neuronal cells only (BBB−
), as well as organoids containing all 6 cell 
types (BBB+) using the staged assembly process. Organoids containing only neural cells did not have a BBB,

while those containing all 6 cell types promoted the formation of a functional BBB, due in part to the presence 
of HBMEC, HBVP and HA cells. After completion of staged assembly, organoids were subsequently treated with 
mercury II chloride for 6 days. Mercury toxicity was evaluated by measuring cell viability through the assessment 
of ATP production following the CellTiter Luminescent Cell Viability Assay protocol (Promega, Madison, WI. 
USA). The results showed that BBB−
 organoids have significantly higher cell death (P < 0.0001) compared to 
BBB+ organoids (Fig. 4B), demonstrating the low permeability of mercury ions through the BBB. It is worth 
noting that ATP production significantly increased in BBB+ spheroids treated with mercury II chloride. ATP 
is required by Na-K ATPase to establish the electrochemical gradient which generates the energy for chloride 
transport across the cell membrane49. This secondary active transport may induce cells to produce more ATP. In 
order to demonstrate that higher ATP production in BBB+ treated organoids was due to the presence of the BBB, 
we disrupted the BBB in BBB+ organoids with Histamine. ATP production was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) 
compared to untreated organoids as shown in Fig. 4E.
Neuro-toxicity model. 
A classic murine model of Parkinson’s disease is induced through exogenous admin-
istration of a small molecule (173 daltons) pro-drug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) 
into healthy mice50. Upon crossing the BBB, MPTP, is metabolized into the toxic positively charged 
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by monoamino oxidase B present in glial cells MPP+ selective uptake 
through the dopamine reuptake pump and subsequent inhibition of complex I by MPP+ causes ATP depletion 
in the dopaminergic neuron and results in cell death51–53. MPTP crosses the BBB due to its lipophilic properties; 
however, MPP+ is hydrophilic and does not cross the BBB51,54–56. Thus, MPTP and MPP+ properties can be 
employed to assess charge selectivity at the BBB. In order to establish BBB selectivity, we constructed BBB−
 orga-
noids as well as BBB+ organoids using the staged assembly method. Upon transferring organoids to a long term

culture plate on day 4, both the BBB−
 and BBB+ organoids were treated with MPTP and MPP+ for six days. Cell 
viability or metabolic activity was assessed by measuring the production of ATP as described above. MPTP did 
not cause statistically significant cell death in treated compared with untreated BBB−
 organoids (student t-test, 
P = 0.13), as MPTP is not toxic to neurons (Fig. 4B), but its metabolite MPP+ caused statistically significant 
(student t-test, P < 0.0001) cell death in BBB−
 organoids (C). In contrast, MPTP, caused significant (student 
t-test, P < 0.0001) reduction in ATP production in BBB+ organoids compared with untreated counterparts 
(Fig. 4B), while MPP+ did not cause statistically significant (student t-test, P = 0.73) cell death in treated com-
pared to untreated BBB+ organoids, as its hydrophilic properties prevent its passage through the BBB (Fig. 4C). 
Put together, MPTB caused a reduction of BBB+ organoids compared to BBB−
 organoids because it traverses the 
BBB, while MPP+ did not cause lower ATP production in BBB+ organoids. However, MPP+ significantly 
reduced cell viability in BBB−
 organoids compared to BBB+ organoids. Furthermore, MPP+ also caused signif-
icant (P < 0.0001) reduction in ATP production in BBB+ organoids that were treated with histamine.
Discussion and Conclusions
In vitro BBB models may be critical to the screening and development of novel and robust therapeutics against 
many neurological insults, and valid one to three cell type models have been described5,6,57–59. Additional proper-
ties of the BBB can be elucidated by creating organoids with all the cell types present in the brain cortex, in pro-
portions similar to normal tissue. The organoids can serve as a model for the evaluation of interactions between 
the BBB and adjacent brain tissue, and can provide a platform for understanding the combined capabilities of a 
novel drug to cross the BBB and its effect on microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Such understanding may 
be important in designing potential in vitro models of neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer’s disease, and characterizing potential injury models, such as stroke.

The organoid model containing 4 cell types that self-assemble in a manner in which the endothelial cells coat 
the sphere, and organoids containing 3 cell types that are prepared in a similar method appear to promote the for-
mation of tight junction proteins. The results in organoids containing HBMEC, HA and HBVP show the presence 
of a functional barrier as demonstrated by low FITC-labeled IgG permeability to the core of the organoids. These 
organoids also showed a normal response when exposed to histamine, opening the barrier and allowing IgG to 
cross the barrier. Organoids containing 6 cell types maintained high cell viability for up to 21 days in vitro. This 
may be important in assessing the long-term effect in drug toxicity studies. We also identified expression of P-gp 
and GLUT1. These proteins play an important role to pump out unwanted chemical substances from the brain 
tissue and to transport glucose into the brain tissue, respectively. There are many diseases that are implicated in 
dysfunction and/or other abnormalities in these proteins50,60,61 and our 3D model, which mimics the physiologi-
cal microenvironment, has the potential to be used to evaluate the expression, localization and function of these 
proteins upon genetic manipulations. We also demonstrated the expression of tight junctions, adherens junctions, 
and adherens junction-associated proteins; these have been identified to prevent the free paracellular diffusion of 
substances into the brain parenchyma.
One of the areas that may be important in BBB in vitro models is the ability to apply these designs to model 
adult human disease. Specifically, over 80% of people hospitalized for stroke are adults62. Many current in vitro 
models do not accurately mimic adult human physiology. The use of human primary and iPSC derived cells 
could help narrow the gap towards attaining an ideal model for clinical applications in studies geared towards 
understanding adult human neurologic diseases. Our data show that hypoxia disrupts the localization of tight 
and adherens junction proteins, which indicates that our organoid model may be useful in studying ischemia in 
a physiologically relevant environment.
To evaluate the selectivity of the BBB, we assessed the subsequent effect of mercury ions in the brain paren-
chyma by evaluating cell viability. Hg2+ does not cross the BBB because of its positive charge, which contributes 
to its hydrophilicity. Our data show that Hg2+ that forms when HgCl2 dissolves in media only causes significant 
cell death in neuronal organoids that did not have a BBB compared to organoids that possess a BBB. This indicates 
that the organoid model containing 6 cell type forms a functional BBB that is charge-selective. Similar results 
were observed when we used a small molecule pro-drug MPTP (a lipophilic small molecule), which is toxic when 
enzymatically converted into its metabolite MPP+ in glial cells. MPTP caused cell death or low ATP production 
in BBB+ organoids. However, when we exposed organoids containing 6 cell types directly to the non-BBB per-
meable MPP+, there was no significant cell death.
The improvement reported herein warrants this model as a possible alternative to existing in vitro models. 
Further structural characterization to determine the production and proper deposition of extracellular matrix 
proteins of the BBB is needed. Analysis of effects on individual cell types in the model is also needed to under-
stand cell specific functions which will make the model more applicable to specific applications or the study of 
various neurologic disorders.
Taken together, the multicellular organoid model forms a functional BBB that is charge selective and shows 
relevant responses to physiologic conditional changes. This model may be useful not only in drug discovery for 
novel therapeutics, but also to evaluate the ability of such drug candidates to cross the BBB, and their ensuing 
sequelae such as general cytotoxicity, glial toxicity and neurotoxicity.

Peprotech), Biotin (100 ng/mL, Sigma Aldrich), and cAMP (5 μ
M/mL Sigma Aldrich) and were then cultured in 
(b) differentiation media (for 72 hrs prior to organoid formation) consisting of 50:50 DMEM/F12:neuralbasal 
(Life Technologies), non-essential amino acids (1X Life Technologies), 1x B27 (Life Technologies), L- glutamine 
(2 mM, Life Technologies), Biotin (100 ng/ml, Sigma Aldrich), PDGF-AA (5 ng/mL, Peprotech), BDNF (10 ng/ml,

medium was replaced with neural differentiation-XF medium (Axol Biosciences) and cultured for an addi-
tional 72 hours to allow for neuronal phenotype differentiation prior to organoid formation. Of note, our initial 
self-assembly experiment (Fig. 1A) included the use of HCN-2 human cortical neurons (ATCC, American Type 
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). These were grown under standard growth conditions in media containing 
90% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 4 mM L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 
4.5 g/L glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum.
Organoid Culture. 
HA, HCN-2, HBMEC, and HBVP were harvested using TrypLE select enzyme (1X 
Life Technologies), HM and HO were harvested from culture plates with accutase (Life Technologies) and 
HN were harvested with unlock-XF (Axol Bioscience). To demonstrate self-assembly of organoids containing 
neuronal cells (HCN-2, Fig. 1A), the cell types were initially labeled using Vybrant® Multi-color Cell Labeling 
(Life Technologies). They were then mixed in a ratio of 1:1:5:6 – HBMEC, HBVP, HA, HCN-2, respectively. The 
cells were then cultured using the hanging drop culture method in hanging drop culture plates (InSphero AG, 
Schlieren, Switzerland). The organoids were allowed to form in media containing EGM-2 media (Lonza). The 3 
cell type organoids utilized for initial BBB assessment were cultured in EGM-2 in hanging drop culture plates 
(InSphero). For organoids containing six cell types, 30% HBMEC, 15% HBVP, 15% HA, 5% HM, 15% HO, and 
20% HN were used to make a total of approximately 2000 cells per organoid. Organoids containing HA, HM, HO 
and HN were allowed to form in 50% astrocyte medium without astrocyte growth supplements and 50% neural 
maintenance-XF medium under normal growth conditions for 48 hrs in hanging drop culture plates (InSphero). 
The medium was mixed with heat inactivated FBS (Thermo Fisher) and 10 ng/μ
L rat tail collagen I (Corning). 
HBMEC and HBVP were subsequently added to coat the neural-glial organoid. The organoids were cultured 
under normal growth conditions in 60% neural maintenance-XF medium, 20% astrocyte medium and 20% com-
plete classic medium. The organoids were then allowed to mature further for 48 hr and were dropped into a 96 
well plate for long term use. The organoids used in all experiments were between 6–10 days in vitro unless spec-
ified. Where the single self-assembly method is specified, all cell-types were included in the initial hanging drop 
and allowed to mature for 96 hrs prior to being dropped into a 96 well plate for long-term culture.
Cell Viability. 
Cell viability was evaluated using a Molecular Probe Live-Dead cell imaging system 
(Invitrogen). Human brain organoids were harvested for cell viability analysis at days 4, 5, 7, 10 and 21. Organoids 
were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes in DPBS containing 2 μ
M calcein AM (Invitrogen, green- live 
cells) and 4 μ
M ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen, red - dead cells). After washing once with DPBS, the orga-
noids were then imaged using the Olympus Fluoview Fv10i (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) laser scanning confocal 
microscope. The images obtained were then quantified using ImageJ to determine cell viability percentages.
Immunohistochemistry. 
Organoids were collected into 1.7 ml Eppendorf tubes (Corning Inc). After aspi-
rating the media, the organoids were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences Inc, Warrington, PA) for 15 minutes 
at 4 °C and were washed 3 times with cold PBS. The organoids were permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS 
for 10 minutes at 4 °C and washed 3 times. Organoids were exposed to Protein Block (Dako Group, Troy, MI) for 
1 hr at RT, and organoids incubated at 4 °C overnight in Antibody Diluent (Dako) solution containing primary 
antibodies –anti-O4 (a marker for OPC, 1:200, RD Systems), anti-Myelin Binding Protein (a marker for mature 
oligodendrocytes, 1:250, Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-PDGF-receptor-b [CD140b] (a marker for pericytes, 
1:500, Millipore), anti-GFAP (a marker for astrocytes, 1:500, Millipore), anti-CD31 (a marker for endothelial 
cells, 1:1000, Abcam), anti-Iba1 (a marker for microglia 1:500, Abcam), anti-beta Tubulin (a marker for neu-
rons 1:1000, Abcam), anti-beta Catenin (1:500, Abcam), anti-GLUT1 (1:500, Abcam), anti-VGLUT2 (1:500, 
Abcam), anti-MDR-1 (1:500, Millipore), anti-ZO-1 (1:1000, Millipore), anti-Claudin-5 (1:500, Millipore), and 
anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase (1:300, Millipore). Organoids were subsequently washed 3 times and incubated with 
AF488 Goat anti-Mouse IgG (1:1000, Life Technologies), AF594 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:1000, Life Technologies), 
AF488A Goat anti-Chicken IgG (1:500, Biotium) in Antibody diluent (Dako) overnight at 4 °C. Nuclear staining 
was perfomed by incubating the organoids with DAPI (1:1000) in PBS for 10 minutes. The organoids were washed 
and imaged using the Olympus Fluoview Fv10i (Olympus) laser scanning confocal microscope. At least three 
randomly selected organoids were imaged for each stain.
Hypoxia. 
On day 6, a 96 well plate containing organoids was cultured in media (60% neuronal maintenance 
media, 20% endothelial growth media, and 20% astrocyte growth media) at 37 °C, 0.1%O2, 99.9%N for 24 hr in an 
Xvivo System G300C (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY, USA). 16 randomly selected organoids grown under normoxic 
conditions and 16 randomly selected organoids grown in hypoxic condition were immediately fixed in 4% PFA 
and subsequently prepared for immunofluorescent staining for ZO-1 and beta catenin. This experiment was 
repeated twice.
Assessement of FITC labeled IgG Permeability. 
One group of organoids was incubated in media at nor-
mal growth conditions with FITC Conjugate IgG (1:200, Millipore) for 30 minutes. A control group was treated 
with 4.5 mM Histamine 15 minutes prior to incubating with FITC labeled IgG. The organoids were washed three 
times before imaging with the Olympus Fluoview Fv10i (Olympus) laser scanning confocal microscope. ImageJ 
was used to quantify fluorescent intensity.
Neurotoxicity. 
Organoids were treated with growth media (60% neuronal maintenance media, 20% endothe-
lial growth media, and 20% astrocyte growth media) containing MPTP, MPP+, HgCl2 (10 μ
M, Sigma). The 
control group was cultured in media without drug or compound. Media was replaced with fresh media change 
containing MPTP, MPP+, HgCl2 every 48 hrs for six days. Media was replaced with fresh media containing

histamine and MPP+ or HgCl2 every 48 hrs for experiments in Fig. 4E. Neurotoxicity and glial toxicity was 
assessed by measuring ATP production on day 6.
ATP Production. 
The organoids were transfered to an opaque-walled 96 well plate. Media (100 μ
L) was 
added to wells. CellTiter-Glo Substrate and CellTiter-Glo Buffer (Promega Life Sciences, Madison, Wisconsin) 
were mixed as per manufacturer’s instructions to make the CellTiter-Glo Reagent. The reagent (100 μ
L) was then 
added to 100 μ
L of medium containing organoids. The contents were then mixed well on an orbital shaker to 
induce cell lysis. The luminescent signal was stabilized by incubating the plate at room temperature for 10 min-
utes. Luminescence was measured using a microplate luminometer (Veritas, Mountain View, CA). Background 
luminescence was then subtracted from the samples.
