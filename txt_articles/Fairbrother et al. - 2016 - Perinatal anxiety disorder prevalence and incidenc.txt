Abstract 
Background:  
Anxiety and related disorders (AD) disproportionately affect women, and are the most prevalent of 
all mental health conditions.  The current research represents the first study of maternal postpartum 
AD prevalence in which all of the AD are assessed, and one of few studies of this type in which 
maternal prenatal AD incidence is assessed. 
Methods:  
A Canadian sample of pregnant women (N = 310) was recruited from a defined geographical area 
between November 2007 and November 2010. Participants were first administered postnatal mood 
and anxiety screening measures. Those who scored at or above cutoff on one or more of these 
measures were administered a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety at approximately 
three months postpartum (n = 115). Findings from the diagnostic interview were used to estimate the 
prevalence and incidence of mood and AD in pregnancy, as well as at and during the first three 
months postpartum. Period prevalence and incidence estimates were obtained retrospectively from 
interview data collected postnatally.   
Results:  
The prevalence of AD during pregnancy and the early postpartum period (15.8% and 17.1% 
respectively) exceeded that of depression (3.9% and 4.8% respectively). The prevalence of OCD in 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
2 
our sample exceeded that of OCD among adults aged 18-64. Parity was unrelated to AD prevalence. 
Slightly less than 5% of participants were comorbid for both AD, and depression.  
Limitations:  
This study is limited by a relatively small sample size for a prevalence study, and non-random 
sample selection. As only women who scored above cutoff on one or more screening measures were 
interviewed, prevalence estimates are conservative. Finally, prenatal prevalence estimates are based 
on retrospective report provided postpartum.  
Conclusions:  
This study provides evidence that, as a group, anxiety and related conditions affect a significant 
proportion of postpartum women, and are more prevalent than is postpartum depression.

Introduction 
Anxiety and their related disorders (AD; i.e., anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive 
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder) are the most prevalent of all psychiatric conditions (Kessler 
et al., 2005a), yet in contrast with the ongoing research and health service focus on postpartum 
depression, perinatal AD have received surprisingly little attention (Manassis, Bradley, Goldberg, 
Hood, & Swinson, 1995). Nearly one-third (28.8%) of the adult population will suffer from an AD 
at some time in their life (Kessler et al., 2005a). This is considerably greater than the prevalence of 
mood disorders (20.8%), impulse-control disorders (24.8%) and substance use disorders (14.6%) 
(Kessler et al., 2005a; Manassis et al., 1995). Further, women are approximately 1.5 times more 
likely to suffer from an AD than are men1. The AD frequently result in significant impairment, and 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
3 
are associated with a high level of health care service utilization and indirect health costs (Ahmad, 
Suleiman, & Shougah, 1994; Sutter-dallay, Giaconne-marcesche, Glatigny-dallay, & Verdoux, 
2004). Determining the scope of AD during the perinatal period is critical for well-informed 
planning with respect to prevention, treatment and resource allocation for this group of women and 
their infants.The perinatal AD literature suggests a prenatal prevalence of 9% to 22%, a postpartum 
prevalence of 11% to 21%, and a postpartum incidence of 2.2% to 8.8% (prenatal incidence data are 
not available) (Borri et al., 2008; Giardinelli et al., 2012; Mota, Cox, Enns, Calhoun, & Sareen, 
2008; Reck et al., 2008; Uguz, 2010; Wenzel, Haugen, Jackson, & Brendle, 2005; Wynter, Rowe, & 
Fisher, 2013). However, we are aware of no published reports of postpartum AD 
prevalence/incidence that include all of the following criteria: (a) an assessment of all of the 
principal AD, (b) the use of samples that are either representative or unselected, and (c) the 
administration of assessments based on gold standard methods (i.e., diagnostic interviewing). 
Further, to our knowledge, only two published studies report the prevalence of prenatal AD, and 
meet the above criteria (Giardinelli et al., 2012; Reck et al., 2008). Consequently, published reports 
may not accurately estimate the actual prevalence and incidence of perinatal AD.   
Aims of the Study 
The primary objective of this research is to document the prevalence and incidence of 
maternal AD in the first three months postpartum.  Secondary objectives are to: (a) estimate the 
prevalence/incidence of maternal AD in pregnancy, (b) compare the prevalence of depression to the 
prevalence of AD in pregnancy and the first three months postpartum, (c) estimate the prevalence of 
the specific AD in pregnancy and the first three months postpartum, (d) compare the prevalence and 
incidence of the AD in pregnancy and the first three months postpartum, among nulliparous and 
multiparous women, (e) estimate the prevalence and incidence of OCD in pregnancy and the first 
three months postpartum, and (f) estimate the level of comorbidity of depression and AD in 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder

pregnancy and the first three months postpartum.  
Materials and Methods 
Full study methods have been published in BMC Psychiatry (Fairbrother, Young, Janssen, 
Antony, & Tucker, 2015). Consequently, only those study methods relevant to the current 
publication are presented here.  
Study Design 
We conducted a study of maternal perinatal AD prevalence and incidence.   
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Prospective participants were eligible to participate if they lived in the City of Vancouver, 
British Columbia, Canada (selected geographical boundary of the research) at the time of 
recruitment, were pregnant and spoke English fluently. The target population for the research are all 
English-speaking pregnant women living in the City of Vancouver, British Columbia during the 
recruitment time frame. The City of Vancouver is a precisely-defined geographical region.  
Recruitment  
Pregnant women were recruited via prenatal clinic visits, physician offices and midwifery 
clinics at British Columbia (BC) Women’s Hospital, St Paul’s Hospital and Burnaby Hospital, 
through community outreach at events and through word of mouth. The primary method of 
recruitment was direct-approach (i.e. approaching women as they wait for their appointments). The 
remainder were recruited through the use of posters and pamphlets. Recruitment took place between 
November 9, 2007 and November 12, 2010. 
Ethics 
Ethical approval for the research was granted by the University of British Columbia / 
Children’s and Women’s Health Centre of British Columbia Research Ethics Board (UBC C&W 
REB; CW07-0085/H07-00048). All participants completed the study consent form.

Participants  
Three hundred and forty-seven women participated in the research. Of the 347 women who 
participated, 152 were eligible for interview based on their questionnaire responses (see procedures 
below). Of the 152 potential interview participants, 115 were interviewed. The remaining 37 were 
not interviewed because they declined the interview (n = 7), were unresponsive to our attempts to 
schedule an interview (n = 9), or were not invited due to administrative error (n = 21). The final 
sample comprised 310 participants. 
Sample Size Justification  
A sample size of N = 300 allows us to estimate the period prevalence of perinatal AD from 
birth to three months postpartum with an accuracy of ± 4% (using a 95% confidence interval, and 
assuming an observed period prevalence of 15%). Assuming a prevalence of depression of 7.1% in 
the first 3-months postpartum (Gavin et al., 2005), the difference in period prevalence between 
depression and AD would be statistically significant with N = 300.  
 
Representativeness 
Based on 2003/2004 statistics, approximately 6000 babies are born to Vancouver residents 
each year (British Columbia Perinatal Database Registry, 2005). Of these, 98% of births by 
Vancouver residents take place at BC Women’s Hospital (73%), St Paul’s Hospital (19%), Burnaby 
Hospital (4%), or at home (2%). To improve the likelihood of obtaining a representative sample, 
women were recruited proportionally from each site.  
Procedures 
Screening.  
Women who consented to participate were asked to complete a set of screening 
questionnaires for mood and anxiety (see below), at six to eight weeks postpartum. Those who 
scored at or above predetermined cutoffs on any of the screening measures were invited to 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
6 
participate in a diagnostic interview; women who scored below cutoff on all screening measures 
were not interviewed.  
Interviews.  
A total of 115 women were interviewed. Interviews were conducted at approximately three 
months postpartum. Women were offered the choice of coming to BC Women’s Hospital for their 
interview, or having the interview conducted in their home. The majority (> 90%) elected to have 
the interview conducted in their home. At the time of the diagnostic assessment, women who 
reported symptoms meeting criteria for any mood or AD were provided with appropriate mental 
health referrals.  
Assessment Tools  
Demographic and reproductive measures.  
In the initial questionnaire package demographic questions included age, income, education 
and marital status, as well as reproductive information (e.g., parity). Questions included a mixture of 
multiple choice and open-ended questions.  
Self-report measures.  
At six to eight weeks postpartum (M = 7.0, SD = 3.6) women completed the following 
screening tools used to assess for symptoms of all of the AD and for depression. Scores from these 
measures were used to determine interview eligibility. Measures were selected for their 
psychometric properties and because they possess good sensitivity and specificity (Beck, Epstein, 
Brown, & Steer, 1988; Blanchard, Jones-alexander, Buckley, & Forneris, 1996; Connor et al., 2000; 
Cooper & Murray, 1998; Cox, Holden, & Sagovsky, 1987; Eberhard-gran, Eskild, Tambs, 
Opjordsmoen, & Samuelsen, 2001; Foa et al., 2002; Kleinknecht & Thorndike, 1990; Klorman, 
Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974; Meyer, Miller, Metzger R.L., Borkovec, 1990; Molina 
& Borkovec, 1994; The PTSD Checklist, 1993). All screening tool, with the exception of the 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
7 
Specific Phobia Questionnaire (see below), have been validated in settings similar to our own 
(Chambless, et al., 2011; Connor et al., 2000; Eberhard-gran et al., 2001; Evans, Spiby, & Morrell, 
2015; Foa et al., 2002; McDonald & Calhoun, 2010; Newman, Holmes, Zuellig, Kachin, & Behar, 
2006; Simpson, Glazer M, Michalski, Steiner, & Frey, 2014; Walker, Newman, Dobie, 
Ciechanowski, & Katon, 2002). For most of the anxiety disorders, screening instruments which have 
been validated for use in perinatal populations do not exist. The exceptions to this are the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale described 
below. 
 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Löwe, 
2006).  
The GAD-7 is a seven item self-report measure designed to assess for generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD) (Spitzer, et al., & Löwe, 2006). Items are rated on a zero to three, Likert-type scale. The 
GAD-7 has been found to demonstrate good reliability as well as convergent, criterion, construct, 
factorial and procedural validity (Kertz, Bigda-peyton, & Bjorgvinsson, 2013; Spitzer et al., 2006). 
The GAD-7 is sensitive to change over time (Kertz et al., 2013). The GAD-7 has been validated for 
use in the perinatal period (Simpson et al., 2014). Prior research has found a Cronbach’s alpha of 
0.92 (Spitzer et al., 2006). The Cronbach’s alpha in this study was 0.90. A cut point of 10 was used 
as it has been found to optimize sensitivity and specificity at 89% and 82%, respectively (Spitzer et 
al., 2006). 
The Obsessive Compulsive Inventory – Revised (OCI-R; Foa et al., 2002).  
The OCI-R is an 18-item self-report measure of OCD. Items are scored on a five-point, 
Likert-type scale. The psychometric properties of the OCI-R are excellent (Abramowitz & Deacon, 
2006; Abramowitz, Tolin, & Diefenbach, 2005; Foa et al., 2002; Hajcak, Huppert, Simons, & Foa, 
2004). In previous research, a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.90 has been found for the total scale, and 0.88 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
8 
for the obsessing subscale (Foa et al., 2002). In the current study, we found a Cronbach alpha of 
0.90 for the total scale and 0.84 for the obsessing subscale. When used to screen for OCD, the 
Obsessing subscale shows higher levels of sensitivity and specificity compared with the full OCI-R 
(i.e., 74% and 76% versus 66% and 63%) (Foa et al., 2002). Consequently, we used the OCI-R 
Obsessing subscale, with a cutoff score of four (sensitivity = 74%, specificity = 76%), as our 
measure of obsessive compulsive symptoms.  
Mini Social Phobia Inventory (Connor, Kobak, Churchill, Katzelnick, & Davidson, 2001).  
The Mini-SPIN is a brief, three-item measure derived from the full scale Social Phobia 
Inventory (Connor et al., 2000), and has been found to demonstrate strong internal consistency 
reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity (Weeks, Spokas, & Heimberg, 2007). 
Items are scored on a zero to five, Likert-type scale. Prior research has found a Cronbach’s alpha of 
0.94 (Connor et al., 2000). In the current study, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.94. A cut score of six on 
the Mini-SPIN has been found to represent good sensitivity (89% and 94%) and specificity (90% 
and 64%) (Connor et al., 2001; Weeks et al., 2007).  
Panic Disorder Self-Report (Newman et al., 2006).  
The PDSR is hierarchical questionnaire, modeled following the panic disorder module of the 
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV; Brown, Di nardo, Lehman, & Campbell, 2001). 
The PDSR begins with questions key to a diagnosis of panic disorder. Only if these initial questions 
are answered in the affirmative, are the remaining questions administered. A score of 8.75 has been 
found to optimize sensitivity (89%) and specificity (100%) and was therefore selected for this 
research (Newman et al., 2006). The PDSR has been found to have excellent test-retest reliability, 
and convergent and discriminant validity (Newman et al., 2006).  
Mobility Inventory for Agoraphobia (MI; Chambless, 1985).  
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
9 
The MI is a 27-item, self-report inventory of avoidance behaviours and panic attacks in 
agoraphobia. Items are scored on a one (rarely avoids) to five (always avoids) Likert-type scale, and 
assess agoraphobic avoidance when the person is alone and when accompanied. Test-retest 
reliability ranges from .75 to .90 (Rodriguez, Pagano, & Keller, 2007). In prior research, the 
Cronbach alpha for avoidance accompanied has been 0.95 (0.95 in the current study also), and for 
avoidance alone 0.96 (0.95 in the current study) (Chambless, 1985).  A cutoff of 1.5 or greater based 
on the mean of the alone and the accompanied scores was used, and represents a sensitivity of 78% 
and specificity between 76% and 85%. When using the avoidance alone scale only, sensitivity is 
high (91%), but specificity is low (67%) (Chambless et al., 2011). 
Specific Phobia Questionnaire (Fairbrother & Antony; 2011).  
The SPQ is a 43-item, self-report measure of specific phobias, assessing 43 different fears 
(e.g. dogs, elevators, driving). The SPQ provides both a fear and an interference rating for each fear 
item. Fear and interference items are scored on a zero (none) to four (extreme) Likert-type scale. 
Although not yet published, the measure has been administered to a clinical sample (N > 700), and 
to a student sample of approximately 200. Psychometric analysis of the full SPQ is currently 
underway. The only published report of the SPQ to date pertains to the fear of dogs item 
(Vorstenbosch, Antony, Koerner, & Boivin, 2012). The SPQ fear of dogs item has been found to 
correlate well with the Dog Phobia Questionnaire (r = 0.73 for fear and 0.60 for interference) 
(Vorstenbosch et al., 2012). In the current study we found Cronbach alphas of 0.93 for fear items, 
and 0.95 for avoidance items. We used a cutoff score of six or greater (combined fear and 
interference ratings) on one or more SPQ items.  
PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993).  
The PCL is 17-item self-report measure to assess symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). Items are rated on a one (not at all) to five (extremely) Likert-type scale. The PCL has been 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
10 
found to have good internal consistency, test-retest reliability and convergent validity (Wilkins, 
Lang, & Norman, 2011). The Cronbach alpha for the PCL has been reported at 0.94 (Blanchard et 
al., 1996). In the present study we found a Cronbach alpha of 0.92. We used a cutoff score of 44 to 
maximize sensitivity at 94% and specificity at 86%. A cutoff score of 50 only provides a sensitivity 
of 78% and a specificity of 86% (Blanchard et al., 1996).  
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox et al., 1987).  
The EPDS is a 10-item self-report measure screening tool for postnatal depression. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the EPDS are in acceptable ranges (65% - 100% and 49% - 100%, 
respectively) (Eberhard-gran et al., 2001). In previous research the Cronbach alpha for the EPDS has 
been reported at 0.87 (Cox et al., 1987). In this study, we found a Cronbach alpha of 0.87, and used 
a cut score of 9.5. With one exception (sensitivity = 0.65), the sensitivity of the EPDS at a cut-score 
of 9.5 ranges from 0.90 to 1.0. among nine studies (Eberhard-gran et al., 2001). Higher sensitivity 
relative to specificity is appropriate for a screening instrument. The EPDS is the most widely used 
screening tool for postpartum depression (Jomeen & Martin, 2005). 
Diagnostic instrument.  
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & 
Williams, 1996) is a reliable and valid semi-structured diagnostic interview designed for the 
assessment of a wide range of psychiatric problems. The SCID was used to assess depression and 
the eight primary AD: panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, acute 
stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and generalized 
anxiety disorder. The 6-month duration criterion for generalized anxiety disorder was waived for the 
purposes of the current study.  
Diagnostic assessments took place, on average, at 13-weeks postpartum (M = 13.0, SD = 
5.3), but encompassed the time period from the beginning of the current pregnancy through to the 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
11 
diagnostic assessment (i.e., approximately 13-weeks postpartum), thus providing information about 
prevalence/incidence in pregnancy and in the postpartum. 
Interviews were conducted by PhD students in clinical and counselling psychology degree 
programs. Interviewers were all trained to a strict criterion. Specifically, interviewers were required 
to meet the following criteria in order to be considered ready to interview independently. First, they 
were required to match the principal investigator (PI) on the principal diagnosis, on three successive 
interviews. Second, they were required, on those three interviews to rate the severity of the principal 
diagnosis to within one severity point on either side (higher or lower),of the principal investigator’s 
severity rating. Subsequently, interviewers were supervised by the project PI. Interviews lasted 
approximately one hour in length. Most interviews were recorded to allow for review in cases of 
diagnostic uncertainty, with call-backs made to participants if further clarification was needed.  
Data Analysis  
Prevalence and incidence definitions for the current study.  
Time frame. The time frames for assessing prevalence and incidence estimates were:  
1. Pregnancy: From the beginning of pregnancy to birth. 
2. Postpartum: from birth to the time of the postnatal interview. 
3. Perinatal: from the beginning of the current pregnancy to the time of the postnatal 
interview. Prevalence and incidence were defined as follows:  
Prevalence. Prevalence, for the purpose of this study, is defined as follows:   
1. AD prevalence was defined as the proportion of women who met full diagnostic criteria for 
one or more AD during one of the identified time frames (see above).  
2. Depression prevalence was defined as the proportion of women who met full diagnostic 
criteria for depression during one of the identified time periods (see above).  
Incidence. Incidence, for the purpose of this study, is defined as follows:  
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
12 
1. AD incidence was defined as the proportion of women in the sample who experienced one 
or more AD beginning during one of the identified time frames (see above).  
2. Depression incidence was defined as the proportion of women in the sample who 
experienced a new episode of depression beginning during one of the identified time frames 
(see above).  
Individual AD. The prevalence and incidence of the individual AD follow the definition 
provided for depression.  
Primary objectives. 
1. Postpartum prevalence/incidence of maternal AD: Estimates for the prevalence and 
incidence of maternal anxiety disorders in the first three months postpartum are provided 
along with their 95% confidence intervals.   
Secondary objectives. 
1. Pregnancy prevalence/incidence of maternal AD: Estimates for the prevalence and incidence 
of maternal AD in pregnancy are provided along with their 95% confidence intervals.  
2. Prevalence/incidence for maternal depression: For comparison purposes, we also provide 
95% confidence intervals for the prevalence and incidence of depression in pregnancy and 
the first three months postpartum, based on findings from the diagnostic interviews.  We 
compare our prevalence data for perinatal depression with standard rates for this disorder45. 
3. Individual AD prevalence: Estimates for the prevalence of the specific AD in pregnancy and 
three first three months postpartum are provided along with their 95% confidence intervals. 
4. Parity: Estimates of the prevalence of AD in pregnancy and the first three months 
postpartum, among primiparous compared with multiparous women, are provided along with 
their 95% confidence intervals. 
5. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Estimates of the prevalence and incidence of OCD in 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
13 
pregnancy and the first three months postpartum, along with 95% confidence intervals for 
these estimates, are compared with population-based estimates of the one-year prevalence 
rate of OCD among adult women in the general population.  
6. Comorbidity: Information about the level of comorbidity of depression and AD in pregnancy 
and in the first three months postpartum were obtained from the diagnostic interview and 
presented descriptively with 95% confidence intervals. 
Results 
Participants 
On average, women were 33.9 years old (SD = 6.3), and 27.6 weeks pregnant (SD = 8.6) at 
the time of enrollment. The vast majority were married (80.5%) or living with a romantic partner 
(14.1%). The remainder were single (3.4%), divorced (0.3%) or separated (0.7%). The majority of 
participants are Caucasian (71.8%) or Asian (19.2%). The remainder are First Nations Canadians, 
Hispanic, or Middle Eastern (3.4%) or did not provide data regarding race/ethnicity (5.6%). 
Participants were well educated, with, on average, over five years of post-secondary education (M = 
5.4, SD = 3.0). Three quarters of the sample reported a family income of $60,000.00 or more. Over 
half of all participants (65.8%) were expecting their first child. Most were singleton pregnancies 
(95.3%) and several were twin pregnancies (4.7%). The majority (90.9%) were recruited via direct-
approach recruitment. Fewer than 30 were recruited passively.  
Women who were eligible for interview, and who were interviewed (n = 115), compared 
with the women who were eligible for interview, but who were not interviewed (n = 37), differed 
with respect to age (M = 33.3 and 30.3 respectively, p < 0.01) and family income (M = $75,000 and 
$61,000, respectively, p = 0.03), but not with respect to marital status, education or racial 
background.

Table 1 presents the n and percentages for AD and depression prevalence and incidence in 
pregnancy, the postpartum (i.e., the first three months postpartum), and the full perinatal period (i.e., 
from the beginning of pregnancy until three months postpartum).  
The prevalence of women in our sample who reported symptoms meeting criteria for an AD 
was significantly greater than the prevalence of women in our sample who reported symptoms 
meeting criteria for depression, both in pregnancy (95% CI for the OR = [4.1 < 13.3 < 43.1]) and in 
the postpartum (95% CI for the OR = [3.4 < 8.6 < 21.7]).  However, depression and AD incidence 
rates did not differ significantly (i.e., all three groups of 95% confidence intervals are overlapping). 
Table 2 presents the n and percentages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the 
prevalence of the individual AD in pregnancy and the postpartum. Other than for OCD, incidences 
ranged from “0” to “0.9” and are not included in Table 2, as they are too low to be meaningful.  
OCD onset occurred in pregnancy (the current pregnancy or a prior pregnancy) among 1.0% 
of participants (95% CI: 0.1 < 1.0 < 2.1) and in the postpartum (current or previous) among 2.9% of 
participants (95% CI: 1.0 < 2.9 < 4.8). The difference between pregnancy onset and postpartum 
onset was not statistically significant.  
Parity  
Table 3 presents the N and percentages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the 
prevalence and incidence of AD among primiparous and multiparous women, in pregnancy and the 
postpartum. Although primiparous and multiparous women differ in their likelihood of reporting 
symptoms meeting criteria for AD in pregnancy and/or the postpartum, differences were non-
significant.  
Comorbidity 
In total 13 (4.2%) participants reported symptoms meeting criteria for both an episode of 
major depression and an AD at some point in either pregnancy or the first three months postpartum. 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
15 
Of these, seven (2.3%) met criteria for an AD and depression in both pregnancy and the first three 
months postpartum, two (0.7%) in pregnancy only and four (1.3%) in the postpartum only.  
Discussion 
This is the first published report of both the prevalence and incidence of maternal postpartum 
AD in which a representative sample was studied, and all of the principal AD were assessed using 
gold standard assessment methods (i.e., diagnostic interviews). The results of this study echo those 
of other reports of maternal, perinatal AD prevalence and incidence: namely that maternal perinatal 
AD affect between 9% and 22% of pregnant and postpartum women, a proportion greater than the 
prevalence of postpartum depression.  
In this study, AD were significantly more common than depression, both in pregnancy and 
the postpartum (see Table 3). The prevalence of major depression in our sample was slightly lower 
(6.5%) than that identified in the literature for pregnant and postpartum women (7.1%)45. In this 
research interviewers were trained to carefully distinguish between symptoms representing a normal 
aspect of pregnancy and the early postpartum (e.g., sleep disturbance, fatigue) and bona fide 
psychiatric symptoms. For example, sleep difficulties were only coded as part of depression when 
they extended beyond necessary disruptions to attend to one’s infant. This careful ruling out of non-
psychiatric symptoms of depression may explain the somewhat lower proportion of women in our 
sample whose symptoms met criteria for depression. The value of this finding is in highlighting that, 
relative to how common AD are among pregnant and postpartum women (i.e., significantly more 
common than is depression), they can be considered to be neglected both clinically and 
scientifically.  
Regarding our prevalence estimates for the individual AD, with two notable exceptions 
(OCD and PTSD), ours are consistent with those reported in the literature for AD among adults in 
the general population aged 18-64 years (Kessler, Petukhova, Sampson, Zaslavsky, & Wittchen, 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
16 
2012). Specifically, the proportion of women in our sample who reported symptoms meeting criteria 
for PTSD was very low compared to the one-year prevalence of PTSD in the general population (i.e. 
0.7% versus 3.5%). This is surprising given that (a), given that we would have anticipated a higher 
prevalence of birth-related PTSD, and (b) women are more than twice as likely as men to develop 
PTSD (i.e., the one year prevalence of PTSD among women is greater than 7.0%). Of the women in 
our sample with symptoms meeting PTSD criteria during the perinatal period, none reported that 
their PTSD was due to either the current birth experience or a previous birth experience. It is 
unlikely that our cutoff on the PCL was too high given that we selected a cut score that has been 
found to maximize sensitivity at 94% (Blanchard et al., 1996). A more probable explanation is that 
women with clinically significant PTSD may have either failed to enroll in the research, or dropped 
out postnatally as a result of their PTSD symptoms. Further, given that we would anticipate a 
prevalence of PTSD at approximately 5% (Kessler et al., 2012), it is possible that a sample size of 
310 was insufficient to produce a reliable estimate of PTSD prevalence.  
The one-year prevalence of OCD among adult women has been estimated at 1.6% (Ruscio, 
Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010), whereas, in this study, we found a prevalence of 3.9 across the 
perinatal period (i.e., 12-months; from the beginning of pregnancy to three months postpartum). Our 
prevalence estimates are consistent with those of a recent meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of 
OCD in pregnancy and the postpartum to those of female controls in which the prevalence of OCD 
among pregnant women was estimated at 2.1%, and among postpartum women at 2.4% (Russell, 
Fawcett, & Mazmanian, 2013). Our data provides further support for the notion that the perinatal 
period, in particular the postpartum period, is a time of increased risk for the onset and exacerbation 
of OCD. Larger sample sizes are needed to provide stable and valid estimates of OCD 
prevalence/incidence in pregnancy and the postpartum. The lead author is currently undertaking 
such an investigation.

Implications 
Our findings indicate that AD are common among pregnant and postpartum women, 
significantly more common than is depression. Potentially useful responses to this knowledge 
include: (a) improved education for pregnant women, their partners and care-providers regarding 
AD, (b) the addition of anxiety-specific screening to existing screening for depression, and (d) 
improved access to psychosocial treatments for anxiety. To date, perinatal AD have been, compared 
with depression, neglected. Increased research and clinical attention to these conditions is warranted.  
Limitations and Future Directions 
This study is limited by a relatively small sample size for a prevalence study. Although 
powered to determine the overall prevalence of perinatal AD among pregnant and postpartum 
women, it is not powered to provide precise estimates of the prevalence or incidence of individual 
disorders. Future research may be able to pool findings from multiple prevalence/incidence studies 
in order to better ascertain the prevalence/incidence of specific anxiety and related conditions among 
perinatal women.  
 
Although significant effort was made to recruit a representative sample of pregnant women 
to the study (i.e. recruitment within a well-defined geographical region, and proportional recruitment 
by intended location of birth), ours was nevertheless not a random sample. Data weighting was 
limited to location of birth only, we were unable to collect refusal rate data and some differences in 
demographic characteristics between women who were interviewed and those who were eligible but 
not interviewed existed. The only realistic way to overcome this obstacle is to collaborate with 
research units collecting large-scale random samples (e.g. N ≥ 10,000) such as future iterations of 
the National Comorbidity Survey (Kessler et al., 2012; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & 
Walters, 2005b). For the following reasons, we estimate that selection bias did not significantly 
impact  the study. First, the majority of our study participants were recruited via direct-approach 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
18 
(91%), thereby minimizing the number of participants who were self-selected to the study. . In order 
to minimize biased recruitment, we recruited: (a) on various days of the week, and at various times 
of the day, (b) via both low and high risk obstetrical clinics, and (c) via Midwifery clinics in order to 
ensure a sample of women who had a planned home birth. Finally, we also used  passive recruitment 
strategies to ensure as broad and representative a sample of women as possible. It may be that 
women who sought out the study via our passive approaches (e.g., community posters) are less 
likely to suffer from a mental health condition. Given that there were a total of 28 passive recruits 
(i.e., 8%) we do not believe this had a significant impact on our findings.  
 
The current study likely provides a conservative estimate of the prevalence/incidence of 
perinatal AD. This is due to the fact that only women who scored above the cutoff on one or more of 
the four to six-week postpartum screening measures were subsequently invited to participate in the 
diagnostic interview. It is unlikely, based on this methodology, that any disorder was over-
diagnosed. However, it is possible that a small proportion of all AD were not diagnosed because the 
participant failed to screen above cutoff on the screening tools. In selecting cut-scores for the 
screening measures, sensitivity was valued over specificity. A total of eight measures of mood and 
anxiety symptoms were administered, with scoring above cutoff on any individual measure 
sufficient to lead to inclusion in the interview group. Given this, it is likely that any participant with 
symptoms meeting criteria for one or more mood or anxiety and related disorders would have scored 
above cutoff on at least one of the screening measures. Therefore, although using a two-step process 
(i.e., screening and then interviewing on the basis of the screening results) creates the potential to 
under-estimate the likelihood of an anxiety and related disorder or a mood disorder we doubt that, in 
reality, many cases were missed. Future prevalence/incidence research would benefit from (a) 
endeavouring to administer diagnostic interviews to the full sample, or conversely (b) administering 
the diagnostic interview to a random sample of participants who score below cutoff on all screening 
  
 
Perinatal anxiety disorder 
 
19 
measures in order to control for the possibility of false positives. 
 
Finally, prevalence/incidence estimates in pregnancy are based on retrospective reports by 
participants, provided at the time of the postpartum interview. Consequently, our pregnancy 
prevalence/incidence estimates are less reliable than those in the postpartum. In order to determine if 
the probability of onset or exacerbation of any of the AD is elevated in pregnancy (there is reason to 
believe that this is likely in the case of obsessive compulsive disorder), a prospective design in 
which participants are interviewed both in pregnancy and again in the postpartum is needed (Wenzel 
et al., 2005; Uguz et al., 2007; Zambaldi et al., 2009). Further, although each interviewer was 
carefully trained and closely supervised, an assessment of the reliability of the diagnostic interviews 
would have been an asset.
