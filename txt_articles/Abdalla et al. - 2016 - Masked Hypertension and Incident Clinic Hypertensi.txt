A
mbulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) 
complements clinic BP by obtaining out-of-clinic BP 
measurements, typically during a 24-hour period.1 Many indi-
viduals without elevated clinic BP have elevated BP on ABPM, 
a phenomenon termed masked hypertension.2 Individuals with 
masked hypertension have an increased prevalence of subclini-
cal cardiovascular disease and risk of cardiovascular disease 
events and mortality when compared with individuals with sus-
tained normortension, defined as having nonelevated clinic and 
ambulatory BP.3–8
Masked hypertension may represent an intermediate phe-
notype between sustained normotension, defined as having 
nonelevated clinic and ambulatory BP, and sustained hyper-
tension, defined as having elevated clinic and ambulatory 
BP.9–11 However, there are few data on the risk for incident 
hypertension associated with masked hypertension particularly 
among blacks, a population with a high prevalence of masked 
hypertension4 and also a high risk for incident hypertension.12 
Previous studies have shown that lifestyle modification and 
pharmacological therapy prevent the onset of hypertension.13–17 
If masked hypertension is associated with an increased risk of 
incident hypertension, then these preventive strategies may be 
appropriate for individuals with masked hypertension.
In this study, we examined the associations of masked day-
time, masked night-time, and masked 24-hour hypertension 
with incident clinic hypertension among participants in the 
Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a cohort study composed exclu-
sively of blacks. We also examined the association of mean 
daytime, night-time, and 24-hour BP with incident clinic hyper-
tension. Furthermore, we evaluated whether these associations

Abstract—Masked hypertension, defined as nonelevated clinic blood pressure (BP) and elevated out-of-clinic BP may be 
an intermediary stage in the progression from normotension to hypertension. We examined the associations of out-of-
clinic BP and masked hypertension using ambulatory BP monitoring with incident clinic hypertension in the Jackson 
Heart Study, a prospective cohort of blacks. Analyses included 317 participants with clinic BP <140/90 mm Hg, complete 
ambulatory BP monitoring, who were not taking antihypertensive medication at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Masked daytime 
hypertension was defined as mean daytime blood pressure ≥135/85 mm Hg, masked night-time hypertension as mean 
night-time BP ≥120/70 mm Hg, and masked 24-hour hypertension as mean 24-hour BP ≥130/80 mm Hg. Incident clinic 
hypertension, assessed at study visits in 2005 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012, was defined as the first visit with clinic systolic/
diastolic BP ≥140/90 mm Hg or antihypertensive medication use. During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 
187 (59.0%) incident cases of clinic hypertension. Clinic hypertension developed in 79.2% and 42.2% of participants 
with and without any masked hypertension, 85.7% and 50.4% with and without masked daytime hypertension, 79.9% 
and 43.7% with and without masked night-time hypertension, and 85.7% and 48.2% with and without masked 24-hour 
hypertension, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of incident clinic hypertension 
for any masked hypertension and masked daytime, night-time, and 24-hour hypertension were 2.13 (1.51–3.02), 1.79 
(1.24–2.60), 2.22 (1.58–3.12), and 1.91 (1.32–2.75), respectively. These findings suggest that ambulatory BP monitoring 
can identify blacks at increased risk for developing clinic hypertension.  (Hypertension. 2016;68:220-226. DOI:

Methods
Study Population
The JHS is a population-based prospective cohort study, which was 
designed to evaluate cardiovascular disease risk among blacks.18,19 
The JHS enrolled 5301 noninstitutionalized blacks, aged ≥21 
years, between 2000 and 2004 from the Atherosclerosis Risk in the 
Community site in Jackson, MS, and a representative sample of urban 
and rural Jackson, MS, metropolitan tricounty (Hinds, Madison, and 
Rankin counties) residents, volunteers, randomly selected individuals, 
and secondary family members.20 The current analysis was restricted to 
1148 JHS participants who completed ABPM after the baseline study 
visit (visit 1). Participants who did not meet the International Database 
on ABPM in relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes21 (IDACO) criteria 
for valid ABPM (n=102; described below), or who were missing clinic 
BP or information on antihypertensive medication use at the baseline 
visit (n=63) were excluded. Participants whose incident clinic hyper-
tension status could not be determined, including those who did not 
attend visit 2 (2005–2008) and visit 3 (2009–2012) (n=82) or with 
missing information on BP or antihypertensive medication use at 
both of these visits (n=10) were also excluded as their incident clinic 
hypertension status could not be determined. For the current analysis, 
we further excluded participants with clinic systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 
mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or who were on antihy-
pertensive medication during the baseline visit (n=574), leaving 317 
participants for the current analysis. The JHS was approved by the 
institutional review boards of the University of Mississippi Medical 
Center, Jackson State University, and Tougaloo College. The insti-
tutional review boards at Columbia University and University of 
Alabama at Birmingham approved the use of JHS data for the current 
analysis. All participants provided written informed consent.
Data Collection and Clinical Covariates
Detailed description of data collection, methodology, specimen col-
lection, and specimen processing from the baseline visit (visit 1) 
can be found in the online-only Data Supplement (Methods sec-
tion in the online-only Data Supplement) and have been previously 
described.19,22 Briefly, data were collected at baseline during an in-
home interview, clinic examination, and ABPM. During the clinic 
examination, trained technicians measured height, weight and BP, 
collected blood samples, and conducted 2-dimensional echocardiog-
raphy. Antihypertensive medication use was defined by self-report. 
Clinic BP was measured after standardized procedures as described 
below. Left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) 
were derived according to American Society of Echocardiography 
recommendations.23 Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined 
as LVMI ≥96 g/m2 in females and LVMI ≥116 g/m2 in males. After 
the clinical examination, participants completed ABPM.
Clinic BP Measurement
At each visit, participants rested for at least 5 minutes in an upright 
position with their back and arms supported, feet flat on the floor 
and legs uncrossed before having their BP measured. Trained staff 
conducted 2 BP measurements in the right arm. One minute elapsed 
between the 2 measurements. An appropriate cuff size, determined 
from an arm circumference measurement, was used. The JHS 
Coordinating Center conducted quality control by monitoring digit 
preference for each technician and by comparing mean BP measure-
ments within and between trained technicians. The 2 clinic-measured 
BP measurements were averaged for analysis.
Clinic BP was measured using a random-zero sphygmomanometer 
(Hawksley and Sons Ltd, Lancing, United Kingdom) at visits 1 and 
2 and a semiautomatic oscillometric device (Omron HEM-907XL, 
Omron Healthcare Inc, Lake Forest, IL) at visit 3. Among the 4182 
JHS participants who attended visit 2 and had clinic BP measure-
ment, 2115 were included in a BP comparability substudy for which 
BP was assessed simultaneously, using a Y connector, by random-
zero sphygmomanometer and the Omron HEM-907XL device. As 
described in the Methods section in the online-only Data Supplement, 
the random-zero BP measurements were calibrated to the semiauto-
mated device using robust regression. When available, clinic BP from 
the semiautomated device was used. In the current analysis, the cali-
brated BP measurements were used at visit 1 for the 317 participants 
and at visit 2 for 206 participants who did not have their BP measured 
using the semiautomatic oscillometric device.
Incident clinic hypertension was defined as the first follow-up 
study visit (visits 2 or 3) with clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg, DBP ≥90 
mm Hg, or antihypertensive medication use.
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring
Immediately after the baseline examination, participants were fitted 
with an ABPM device (Spacelabs 90207, Spacelabs, Redmond, WA) on 
their nondominant arm. Ambulatory BP was recorded every 20 minutes. 
After 24 hours, the device was removed, and data were downloaded 
onto a computer and processed with Medifacts International’s Medicom 
software (Rockville, MD). IDACO criteria were used to define whether 
the ABPM measurement was complete. Specifically, participants were 
considered to have a complete ABPM if they had ≥10 daytime (10 am–8 
pm) and ≥5 night-time (12 am–6 am) SBP and DBP measurements.21 
Mean daytime SBP and DBP, mean night-time SBP and DBP, and mean 
24-hour SBP and DBP were calculated by averaging the readings dur-
ing the daytime, night-time, and the entire ABPM period, respectively.
Daytime hypertension was defined as mean daytime SBP ≥135 
mm Hg or mean daytime DBP ≥85 mm Hg, night-time hypertension 
was defined as mean night-time SBP ≥120 mm Hg or mean night-time 
DBP ≥70 mm Hg and 24-hour hypertension was defined as mean SBP 
≥130 mm Hg or mean DBP ≥80 mm Hg based on all available readings. 
Because the current analysis was restricted to participants with nonel-
evated clinic-measured BP (clinic SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg), partici-
pants with daytime, night-time, and 24-hour hypertension had masked 
daytime, masked night-time, and masked 24-hour hypertension, respec-
tively. In addition, participants with masked daytime, night-time, or 24-
hour hypertension were categorized as having any masked hypertension.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline participant characteristics were calculated for the analytic 
sample as mean± SD or percentages. The prevalence of any masked 
hypertension and masked daytime, night-time and 24-hour hyperten-
sion was calculated. The percentage of participants developing hyper-
tension was calculated by quartile of mean daytime, night-time, and 
24-hour SBP. Because we do not know the exact date participants 
developed hypertension, only that it developed between 2 study visits, 
interval-censored Cox regression24 was used to calculate hazard ratios 
for incident hypertension associated with higher quartiles (quartiles 
2, 3, and 4) versus lowest quartile (quartile 1) of mean daytime, night-
time, and separately, 24-hour SBP. Three models with progressive 
adjustment were estimated. Models adjusted for age and sex (model 
1), variables in the Framingham hypertension risk prediction score,25 
including age, sex, body mass index, clinic SBP, parental history of 
hypertension, smoking status, age by clinic DBP interaction (model 
2). A final model included additional adjustment for diabetes melli-
tus, education level less than high school, alcohol consumption, total 
physical activity score, and reduced estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (model 3). The above analyses were repeated for higher quartiles 
(quartiles 2, 3, and 4) versus the lowest quartile (quartile 1) of mean 
daytime, night-time, and 24-hour DBP. Hazard ratios for incident 
hypertension associated with SD higher mean daytime, night-time, 
and 24-hour SBP and DBP were also calculated. The percentage of 
participants developing hypertension was calculated for those with 
and without any masked hypertension, and masked daytime, night-
time, and 24-hour hypertension. Hazard ratios for incident hyperten-
sion associated with any masked hypertension, and masked daytime, 
night-time, and 24-hour hypertension were calculated with adjust-
ment for covariates in 3 models as described above.
Because previous studies have demonstrated that prehypertension 
is associated with a higher risk for incident hypertension compared

with normal clinic BP,26–29 and that an overlap exists between masked 
hypertension and prehypertension,4,30 secondary analyses were per-
formed after stratifying the sample into participants with prehyper-
tension or normal clinic BP at baseline. Prehypertension was defined 
as mean clinic SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg or mean clinic DBP 80 to 
89 mm Hg. Normal clinic BP was defined as mean clinic SBP <120 
mm Hg and mean clinic DBP <80 mm Hg. Analyses were performed 
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata version 
13.1 (Stata Inc, College Station, TX).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The mean±SD age of participants included in the current 
analysis was 54.8±11.1 years and 69.1% were female (Table 
S1). The prevalence of prehypertension was 57.1%. The prev-
alence of masked daytime hypertension, masked night-time 
hypertension, and masked 24-hour hypertension were 22.3%, 
42.3%, and 28.7%, respectively. Overall, 45.4% of partici-
pants had any masked hypertension. Compared with JHS par-
ticipants who were not included in the analyses, those who 
were included were older, more likely to be female, had higher 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, had a higher LVMI, were 
more likely to have LVH, were less likely to be a current 
smoker, and had higher clinic SBP and lower clinic DBP.
Ambulatory BP and Incident Clinic Hypertension
The median time between visit 1 and visit 2 and visit 1 and 
visit 3 was 5.0 and 8.1 years, respectively. During follow-up, 
there were 187 cases (59.0%) of incident clinic hypertension, 
124 cases at visit 2, and an additional 63 cases at visit 3. Of 
the 187 cases of incident hypertension, 44 (23.5%) had inci-
dent hypertension based on having clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg 
or clinic DBP ≥90 mm Hg without taking antihypertensive 
medication and 120 (64.2%) had incident hypertension based 
on taking antihypertensive medication without having either 
clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg or clinic DBP ≥90 mm Hg at a fol-
low-up visit. Finally, 23 (12.3%) had incident hypertension 
based on having clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg or clinic DBP ≥90 
mm Hg at a follow-up visit and were also taking antihyperten-
sive medication.
After adjustment for age and sex, higher quartiles of day-
time, night-time, and 24-hour SBP were associated with an 
increased risk of incident hypertension (model 1, Table 1). 
These associations remained present after further multivari-
able adjustment. Higher quartiles of daytime, night-time, and 
24-hour DBP were also associated with an increased risk 
of incident clinic hypertension before and after multivari-
able adjustment (Table S2). When modeled as continuous 
variables, higher daytime, night-time, and 24-hour SBP and

hypertension (Table S3).
Masked Hypertension and Incident Clinic 
Hypertension
Overall, 79.2% and 42.2% of participants with and without 
any masked hypertension developed incident clinic hyperten-
sion during follow-up (Figure). The proportion of participants 
developing incident clinic hypertension was higher among 
participants with versus without masked daytime hyperten-
sion (85.7% versus 50.4%), masked night-time hypertension 
(79.9% versus 43.7%), and masked 24-hour hypertension 
(85.7% versus 48.2%). After multivariable adjustment, any 
masked hypertension and masked daytime, night-time, and 
24-hour hypertension were each associated with an increased 
risk of incident clinic hypertension (Table 2).
Masked Hypertension and the Risk of Incident 
Clinic Hypertension Stratified by Prehypertension 
Status
Higher daytime, night-time, and 24-hour SBP and DBP were 
each associated with an increased risk of clinic hypertension 
among participants with prehypertension (Table S4). Among 
individuals with normal clinic BP, higher daytime, night-time, 
and 24-hour SBP were associated with an increased risk of 
incident clinic hypertension. Higher night-time and 24-hour 
DBP, but not daytime DBP, were associated with incident 
clinic hypertension in participants with normal clinic BP. 
Also, among participants with prehypertension, any masked 
hypertension, as well as each type of masked hypertension, 
was associated with an increased risk of clinic hypertension 
after multivariable adjustment (Table S5). Among participants 
with normal clinic BP, any masked hypertension and masked 
night-time hypertension were associated with an increased 
risk of incident clinic hypertension. Any masked hypertension 
and incident hypertension occurred among 51.9% (94/181) 
of participants with prehypertension and 14.7% (20/136) 
of participants with normal clinic BP. Among participants 
with prehypertension, 33.7% (61/181) had masked daytime 
hypertension and incident hypertension, 48.1% (87/181) had 
masked night-time hypertension and incident hypertension, 
and 39.2% (71/181) had masked 24-hour hypertension and 
incident hypertension. Among participants with normal clinic 
BP, these estimates were 3.7% (5/136), 14.7% (20/136), and 
5.1% (7/136), respectively.
Discussion
In the current population-based sample of blacks with non-
elevated clinic BP at baseline, higher levels of ambulatory 
BP were associated with an increased risk for incident clinic 
hypertension. In addition, having any masked hyperten-
sion was associated with an increased risk for incident clinic 
hypertension as was each type of masked hypertension. Only 
a few studies, mostly in whites, have examined the association 
between masked hypertension and the development of hyper-
tension.7,31–33 In an outpatient sample of 34 Spanish children 
and adolescents, aged 6 to 18 years, with masked daytime 
hypertension, Lurbe et al31 showed that after a median follow-
up of 37 months there were 3 participants (8.8%) who devel-
oped sustained hypertension. No participants in the control 
group of 200 children and adolescents with sustained normo-
tension progressed to sustained hypertension. In the Pressioni 
Arteriose Monitorate e Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) Study, 
which enrolled a population sample from Monza, Italy,32 
47.1% of participants with masked 24-hour hypertension 
developed sustained hypertension after 10 years of follow-up 
compared with 18.2% of those with sustained normotension. 
Also, in a study of 232 Canadian public insurance employees 
with masked daytime hypertension, sustained hypertension 
was present in 61 (26.3%) participants after 3 years and 81 
(34.9%) participants after 5 years of follow-up.33 In that study, 
the progression from sustained normotension to sustained 
hypertension was not reported.
An important limitation of our study is that ABPM was not 
performed at the follow-up visits. Therefore, this study was 
unable to confirm whether participants categorized as having 
clinic hypertension at follow-up had sustained hypertension 
or white coat hypertension, defined as elevated clinic BP but 
nonelevated ambulatory BP. However, previous studies have 
shown that the progression of masked hypertension to white 
coat hypertension is uncommon. In the PAMELA study,32 
and in a study by Trudel et al,33 only 7.6% and 0.5%, respec-
tively, of participants with masked hypertension at baseline 
had white coat hypertension during follow-up. Therefore, it is 
likely that most of the participants in this study with incident 
clinic hypertension during follow-up had sustained hyperten-
sion. This study was also unable to determine the percentage 
of participants with masked hypertension at baseline who 
continued to have masked hypertension or alternatively had 
sustained normotension at follow-up. In the PAMELA study, 
among participants with masked hypertension at baseline and 
who did not have elevated clinic BP at follow-up, 51.9% and 
48.1% had masked hypertension and sustained normotension, 
respectively, during follow-up.32

In younger adults, clinic BP is, on average, lower than ambu-
latory BP.9,10,34,35 It has been proposed that during the aging pro-
cess, some individuals reach a stage where their ambulatory BP 
exceeds the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension, whereas 
their clinic BP is not yet in the hypertensive range;9,10 many of 
these individuals are likely to have prehypertension. We have 
previously reported that there is a substantial overlap between 
masked hypertension and prehypertension.30 Given that pre-
hypertension is associated with an increased risk of incident 
clinic hypertension compared with normal clinic BP,29 prehy-
pertension may explain the increased risk for clinic hyperten-
sion among individuals with masked hypertension. However, 
in this study, the association between any masked hypertension 
and incident clinic hypertension was independent of clinic BP 
level, and this association was also similar for participants with 
prehypertension and those with normal clinic BP.
In our study, masked night-time hypertension, but not 
masked daytime or masked 24-hour hypertension, was asso-
ciated with incident clinic hypertension among those with 
normal clinic BP. Previous studies have shown that compared 
with whites, blacks have a higher prevalence of night-time 
hypertension.36–38 The underlying mechanisms linking night-
time hypertension to incident clinic hypertension in blacks are 
unknown. Psychosocial stress, sleep apnea as well as biologi-
cal factors such as arterial stiffness, inflammation, endothelial 
dysfunction, and salt sensitivity may be possible mecha-
nisms.39–42 Future studies should examine the factors linking 
masked night-time hypertension to incident clinic hyperten-
sion among blacks.
Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associ-
ated with hypertension, earlier identification of individuals 
at a high risk for developing hypertension is of paramount 
importance. The results of our study suggest that the iden-
tification of masked hypertension among individuals with 
nonelevated clinic BP using ABPM may identify those at 
highest risk for incident clinic hypertension. Previous stud-
ies15,16,26,43,44 have demonstrated that lifestyle modification 
and pharmacological therapy may delay the onset of hyper-
tension among high-risk individuals including those with 
prehypertension. These preventive strategies may prove to 
be most effective for not only the subset of individuals with 
prehypertension who have masked hypertension but also for 
those individuals with normal clinic BP and masked hyper-
tension. Furthermore, in this study, 6.2% of participants had 
LVH at baseline. Diaz et al4 previously demonstrated that 
among JHS participants, masked hypertension was associ-
ated with increased LVMI. Given the increased cardiovas-
cular disease risk associated with LVH,45 individuals with 
masked hypertension and LVH may represent a high-risk 
group that might benefit from antihypertensive medication 
initiation before the development of clinic hypertension. 
Randomized trials are needed to determine whether lifestyle 
modification and pharmacological therapy delay hyperten-
sion onset and reverse cardiovascular end-organ damage 
among individuals with masked hypertension.
There are several strengths of this study. We used data 
from a population-based sample composed entirely of blacks. 
There have been few previous investigations of ABPM among

 Abdalla et al  Masked Hypertension and Incident Hypertension  225
blacks,4,46 and this population has a high risk for masked hyper-
tension4 and incident clinic hypertension.12 Also, given the 
broad data collection in the JHS, we were able to control for 
multiple potential confounders. We were also able to exam-
ine several types of masked hypertension including masked 
daytime, night-time, and 24-hour hypertension, as well as 
determine the risk of incident clinic hypertension stratified by 
prehypertension status. In addition to ABPM not being con-
ducted at a follow-up visit in the JHS, there were also other 
possible limitations. Only a subsample of JHS participants 
had ABPM performed at the baseline visit. Information about 
napping during the daytime period and awakening during the 
night-time period, which may affect estimates of daytime and 
night-time BP, was not collected. In addition, the JHS did not 
conduct home BP monitoring, another out-of-clinic approach 
for measuring BP, which also can be used to determine masked 
hypertension. Some evidence suggests that many individu-
als have masked hypertension on either ABPM or home BP 
monitoring, but not on both.47 Therefore, masked hypertension 
on ABPM versus home BP monitoring may represent differ-
ent out-of-clinic BP phenotypes. We were unable to assess the 
association of masked hypertension on home BP monitoring 
and incident hypertension within the JHS.
Perspectives
Among blacks with nonelevated clinic BP and who were not 
taking antihypertensive medication, masked hypertension was 
associated with an increased risk for the development of clinic 
hypertension. The association between any masked hypertension 
and incident clinic hypertension was present after adjustment for 
clinic BP, and was similar among participants with prehyperten-
sion and normal clinic BP. Also, daytime, night-time, and 24-hour 
masked hypertension was each associated with incident clinic 
hypertension. The results of this study suggest that among black 
adults with nonelevated clinic BP, ABPM can identify those who 
are at increased risk for developing clinic hypertension.

What Is New?
• We examined the associations of masked hypertension and its subtypes 
(masked daytime, night-time, and 24-hour hypertension) with incident 
clinic hypertension among a population-based cohort of blacks.
• We also evaluated whether these associations were independent of clinic 
blood pressure level and consistent for those with prehypertension and 
separately, normal clinic blood pressure.
What Is Relevant?
• It has been hypothesized that masked hypertension represents an inter-
mediate phenotype between normotension and hypertension.
• Few population-based studies have examined the association between 
masked hypertension and incident hypertension, and none have exam-
ined this association in blacks, who have a high prevalence of masked 
hypertension.
Summary
Among a large population-based cohort study of blacks with nonel-
evated clinic blood pressure, participants with any masked hyper-
tension had twice the risk of incident clinic hypertension compared 
with participants without masked hypertension during an 8-year 
follow-up period. Among participants with either prehypertension 
or normal clinic blood pressure, masked hypertension was associ-
ated with increased risk of incident clinic hypertension.
