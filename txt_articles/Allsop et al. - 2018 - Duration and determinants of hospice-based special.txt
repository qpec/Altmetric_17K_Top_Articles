Abstract
Background: Understanding service provision for patients with advanced disease is a research priority, with a need to identify 
barriers that limit widespread integration of palliative care.
Aim: To identify patient and organisational factors that influence the duration of hospice-based palliative care in the United Kingdom 
prior to death.
Design: This is a retrospective cohort study.
Setting/participants: A total of 64 UK hospices providing specialist palliative care inpatient beds and community services extracted 
data for all adult decedents (aged over 17 
 years) with progressive, advanced disease, with a prior referral (e.g. inpatient, community 
teams, and outpatient) who died between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015. Data were requested for factors relating to both 
the patient and hospice site.
Results: Across 42,758 decedents, the median time from referral to death was 48 
 days. Significant differences in referral to death 
days were found for those with cancer (53 
 days) and non-cancer (27 
 days) (p 
 < 
 0.0001). As age increases, the median days from 
referral to death decreases: for those under 50 
 years (78 
 days), 50–74 
 years (59 
 days), and 75 
 years and over (39 
 days) (p 
 = 
 0.0001). 
An adjusted multivariable negative binomial model demonstrated increasing age persisting as a significant predictor of fewer days of 
hospice care, as did being male, having a missing ethnicity classification and having a non-cancer diagnosis (p 
 < 
 0.001).
Conclusion: Despite increasing rhetoric around early referral, patients with advanced disease are receiving referrals to hospice 
specialist palliative care very late in their illness trajectory. Age and diagnosis persist as determinants of duration of hospice specialist 
palliative care before death.

What is already known about the topic?
•
•
The United Kingdom is ranked top of 40 countries for level of integration of palliative care within wider health services 
measured in a 
‘quality of death’ index based on palliative service provision, access to opioids and a national strategic approach.
•
•
Recent recommendations encourage earlier referral to palliative care, with involvement expected within 8 
 weeks of 
diagnosis of advanced disease for patients with cancer.
What this paper adds
•
•
UK hospices continue to offer a ‘last weeks of life’ service to predominantly adult patients with cancer, with more than 
half of all referrals occurring in the last 7 
 weeks of life (median time 48 
 days) and 40% occurring within 30 
 days of death.
•
•
Inequities in access to hospice-based palliative care persist; those with non-cancer conditions and older age groups 
receive a much shorter duration of palliative care prior to death.

Implications for practice, theory or policy
•
•
Despite increasing evidence of the benefits of earlier referral to palliative care, existing evidence suggests that many 
patients are still referred late which limits the benefits on end of life care.
•
•
Hospice-based palliative care requires a radical focus and promotion of integrated service models to respond to and 
better support the projected demand from age-related growth in deaths from chronic illness.
Background
Increasing evidence highlights that palliative care can 
improve symptom control and quality of life, increase satis-
faction with care, and provide better outcomes for families.1 
In particular, early referral can lead to multiple benefits for 
patients and their families. These include, but are not limited 
to, improvement in certain symptoms, improved patient 
quality of life, reduced aggressive care at the end of life, 
reduced hospital length of stay and hospitalisations, and 
improved caregiver burden and better maintenance of car-
egiver quality of life.2 For patients with cancer, there is a 
drive to facilitate earlier referral through integration of pal-
liative care within oncology care.3 Recent recommendations 
from the American Society of Clinical Oncology highlight 
that patients with advanced cancer should receive dedicated 
palliative care services early in the disease course, concur-
rent with active treatment.4 For non-cancer conditions, there 
is evidence of benefits of earlier referral, supporting various 
needs across earlier and later phases in the illness trajec-
tory.5 Understanding approaches to early referral and barri-
ers that limit integration of palliative care is a research 
priority.6 A key starting point is to understand current prac-
tice. Determining timing of referral to palliative care is a 
marker of quality and can inform when patients are access-
ing and potentially benefitting from services.7 At a popula-
tion-level, there are few data to describe duration of 
palliative care involvement, how it differs across diagnoses 
and where increased integration efforts may be required.8 
Internationally, there are limited and widely varied reports 
on duration of palliative care received by patients before 
death, measured as the time between referral to a service 
and death. Where available, figures vary greatly within and 
across countries. Examples of studies reporting median 
times range from 12 to 21  days in Korea,9 United States,10 
and United Kingdom,11 to in excess of 60 to 70  days in 
Canada.12 These studies are based on small sample sizes in 
a limited number of settings. Studies measuring duration of 
palliative care at a regional level include a citywide report in 
Leeds, UK11 (median of 34  days) and a population-level 
observational study in Ontario, Canada (reporting 35 mean 
days of palliative care).8 Within these regions, palliative 
care is typically supporting patients with advanced disease 
in the last month of life.
Although data are lacking at a population level, factors 
affecting access and duration of palliative care have been 
explored at the patient, health professional and health sys-
tem level. Disproportionate access to a greater number of 
days of palliative care prior to death occurs for people with 
malignant disease (when compared to people with non-
cancer conditions), people under 65  years (compared to 
those over 65  years), and white people (when compared to 
Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people).13 Geographical 
variation in access to palliative care also exists.14 In the 
United Kingdom, variation is particularly pronounced, 
with fewer days being received by patients in rural areas.15 
Research on cancer care specifically has explored the role 
of oncologists and their influence on access to palliative 
care. A US study suggested that palliative care referrals 
can be limited by perceptions that palliative care is incom-
patible with cancer therapy, beliefs that the oncologist’s 
role is incompatible with palliative care and ignorance of 
locally available palliative services.16 A UK study explor-
ing reasons for limited referral of non-cancer patients to 
community palliative teams identified perception of the 
palliative care service by other health professionals, the 
existence of different pathways of care for cancer and non-
cancer patients and the lack of understanding of the role of 
other specialist nurses as key influences on referral pat-
terns.17 System-level barriers include lack of resources and 
restrictive eligibility criteria.18
Most cited evidence supporting early referral to pallia-
tive care arises from randomised controlled trials in the 
United States. This research was undertaken to determine 
current timing of referrals to hospice-based specialist pal-
liative care nationally in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, 
the study sought to identify the extent to which previously 
identified factors influence timing of referrals to hospice-
based specialist palliative care in the United Kingdom. 
The development of this first national picture of timing of 
referrals will provide a benchmark against which the pol-
icy rhetoric for earlier referral to palliative care can be 
judged. Internationally, different models of palliative care 
exist, sometimes developed for specific cultural contexts.19 
In the context of the United Kingdom, palliative care is 
provided through both specialist (multidisciplinary team 
of National Health Service (NHS) or hospice staff with the 
requisite qualifications, expertise and experience) and 
generalist (all other health professionals, supported by spe-
cialist teams) services.20 Around 95% of inpatient beds for 
 1324 
Palliative Medicine 32(8)
specialist palliative care are hospice-led (88% are charita-
ble organisations and 12% are NHS units). About 60%–
75% of community palliative care is delivered by hospice 
organisations.13 In order to determine timing of referrals to 
palliative care across the United Kingdom, this study 
focuses on provision of specialist palliative care by hos-
pices, which provide the majority of this level of care in 
the UK context.
Methods
Study aim
The aim of this study is to conduct a national survey on 
factors that influence duration of palliative care, focusing 
on specialist palliative care provision by hospices in the 
United Kingdom.
Study design
This is a retrospective cohort study using data from elec-
tronic clinical record systems held by hospice sites across 
the United Kingdom. We examined routinely collected 
anonymised data on all decedents during 2015. Following 
submission via the Integrated Research Application 
System, ethical approval was obtained from the West 
Midlands – South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee 
(reference: 16/WM/0412) and appropriate management 
and governance clearance was obtained from each site 
prior to participation in the study.
Sampling
The project was undertaken in partnership with Hospice 
UK, a national charity that champions and supports hos-
pice and palliative care providers across the United 
Kingdom. In November 2016, a study invitation email was 
sent to 195 member hospices of Hospice UK (that provide 
specialist adult palliative care). Invitations were sent 
through two email lists: CEO and senior contacts at mem-
ber hospice sites and a list of all hospice nursing directors. 
Subsequent reminder emails were sent to non-responders 
in December 2016 and January 2017. In total, 64 hospice 
sites participated reflecting a 33% response rate.
Data extraction
Following enrolment into the study, sites were asked to 
extract data for all adult decedents (aged over 17  years) 
with progressive, advanced disease with a prior referral to 
hospice care (e.g. inpatient, community teams, and outpa-
tient) who died between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 
2015 (referral to services could have occurred in 2015 or 
any prior year). A Microsoft Excel template was provided 
to participating sites, with a spreadsheet for inserting data 
on eligible patients (date of birth, date of death, sex, eth-
nicity, diagnosis at referral, and date of first hospice refer-
ral on record). Data on source and reason for a referral 
were not captured as these can be multifaceted and there is 
no standardised coding approach for recording these. 
Embedded algorithms in the Microsoft Excel template 
used entered patient data to generated a separate spread-
sheet with age at death and number of days from initial 
referral to death (number of days’ difference between first 
referral and date of death), sex, ethnicity and diagnosis at 
referral. The second spreadsheet was submitted to the 
research team via the University of Leeds Secure Electronic 
Environment for Data (SEED) system which is a secure 
data management infrastructure. Data collection occurred 
between November 2016 and June 2017.
Each participating hospice site was also asked to pro-
vide data on their organisation (total number of unique 
patient referrals received during 2015, number of inpatient 
beds, and staff capacity (reported as whole time equivalent 
(WTE), reflecting actual workload hours contributed by 
staff as an equivalent to the status of a full time worker) for 
palliative care doctors and community nursing teams. 
Clinical expertise and knowledge of hospice-based special-
ist palliative care provision across team members suggested 
that initial contact with hospices would predominantly be 
as outpatients, therefore determining the number of doctors 
and community teams sought to provide insight into poten-
tial reach and responsiveness to referrals. Additional infor-
mation compiled by the research team for each hospice 
included region and Rural–Urban Classification (RUC). 
For classification of region for hospices in England, NHS 
England regional team labels were used, stratifying sites by 
North of England, Midlands and East of England, London 
and South of England. Sites from Wales and Scotland were 
classified at country level. RUC was calculated using 
ArcGIS software (ArcMap 10.3.1) to reference the post-
code of a hospice site against the UK Government 2011 
RUC for Local Enterprise Partnership Areas based on 
Census Output Areas.
Data management and analysis
Data received from hospice sites included a range of elec-
tronic clinical record system vocabularies for patient char-
acteristics of ethnicity and diagnosis. Prior to statistical 
analyses, ethnicity data were aligned with groupings 
applied by the UK Office for National Statistics. Diagnosis 
was mapped against major cancer and non-cancer disease 
types (see Appendix 1 for further details on grouping). 
Decedents were also dichotomised into one of two groups 
based on their diagnosis: cancer or non-cancer.
To investigate the factors associated with the time from 
referral to death, all decedents were categorised into one of 
two groups based on referral-to-death duration. We defined 
late referral occurring within 30  days of death and earlier 
 Allsop et al. 
1325
referral as more than 30  days before death. This was based 
on our recent analysis of routine data which demonstrated 
benefits associated with referral to palliative care at least 4 
 
weeks before death.7 Demographic and clinical variables 
(sex, age, ethnicity and diagnosis) were summarised over-
all and by referral-to-death categories. These data are pre-
sented as number and proportion of decedents. Differences 
in proportion of early versus late referrals across each of 
the demographic and clinical variables were calculated 
using univariable logistic regression models. The referral 
to death days were also summarised overall and for each of 
the demographic and clinical variables. These data are pre-
sented as median days with accompanying interquartile 
range (25 to 75 percentiles) and median absolute deviation 
(MAD). MAD was used as a measure of variance of the 
time between referral and death because it is a measure of 
statistical dispersion that is resistant to outliers. Differences 
in median referral to death days across each of the demo-
graphic and clinical variables were calculated using the 
Kruskal–Wallis test. Descriptive summaries of site-level 
data are presented separately to patient-level data and cat-
egorised by geographical region. These data are presented 
as means and standard deviation reporting average number 
of patient referrals, bed capacity, staff capacity (palliative 
care doctor and community nursing team WTEs) and pro-
portion of rural hospices. Case-mix was also calculated for 
each site to determine the proportion of decedents with 
non-cancer conditions to decedents with cancer conditions 
using the following formula

Negative binomial regression (NBR) models were fit-
ted to the data to quantify the relationship between refer-
ral-to-death time and clinical, demographic and site-level 
factors. NBR models were chosen for this analysis because 
the outcome variable (days between referral and death) 
was over-dispersed count data (i.e. it was highly skewered 
towards zero). NBR models have been used previously to 
examine patterns and timing of referrals to palliative care 
services.21 Factors associated with referral-to-death time 
were estimated in three NBR models: first, demographic 
and clinical factors (model 1); second, site-level factors 
(model 2); finally, demographic, clinical and site factors in 
a fully adjusted model (model 3). Data are presented as 
incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CIs). In each model, the dispersion parameter was 
set to constant and clustering effect of hospice site was 
accounted for by adjusting the standard errors for inter-
group correlation using variance estimator cluster option. 
This assumes that observations are independent across 
clusters (i.e. hospice sites) but not necessarily within clus-
ters and adjusts the standard error (and consequently the 
95% CI) but does not adjust the estimated coefficients. All 
statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 13. 
To account for multiple testing, a two-tailed significance 
level of 0.01 was used for NBR models.
Patient involvement
Patients were involved in setting the research question and 
in the design of the study, no patients were asked for advice 
on interpretation or writing up of results. The results of the 
research have been disseminated to the patient community 
through patient forums.
Results
Across 64 participating sites, data were extracted on a total 
of 42,758 decedents referred to hospice-based palliative 
care who died between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 
2015. A total of 99 cases (0.23%) were excluded from anal-
ysis due to missing sex and/or age data. A further 287 cases 
(0.67%) were excluded due to referral to death days greater 
than 2000  days. There were 42,372 cases (99.1%) available 
for analysis (Figure 1). Across all sites, the number of refer-
rals in 2015 ranged from 171 to 4255.

Patient demographic variables
Table 1 outlines patient-level characteristics across all data, 
alongside comparing characteristics between late and early 
referrals. Across all decedents, the median number of days 
from referral to death was 48  days, and 40% of all referrals 
(n  =  17,122) were made within 30  days of death. Significant 
differences were found across age groups, with fewer days 
between referral and death as age increases. For ethnicity, 
there were significant differences in the duration between 
referral and death, with those classified as ‘missing/not 
recorded’ having the fewest days (30  days) compared with 
‘Black/African/Caribbean/Black British’ having the highest 
(73  days).
Diagnosis
Table 2 outlines median days from referral to death by diagno-
sis. Of cancer types, patients with breast cancer have the long-
est referral-to-death duration (median 81 
 days) and unknown/
other the least (median 40 
 days). For non-cancer conditions, 
patients with neuro-degenerative disease (e.g. motor neurone 
disease) have the longest referral-to-death duration (median 
109 
 days) together with heart failure (median 67 
 days) and 
dementia and stroke the least (median 9 
 days).
When considering timing of referrals to hospice-based 
palliative care, those with cancers of head and neck, upper 
GI, colorectal, male genital and reproductive organs, brain 
and connective tissue had a significantly greater chance of 
receiving an early referral compared to lung cancer cases 
(used as the referent group, with 38% of lung cancer cases 
receiving a late referral).
Diagnoses with significantly greater chance of receiv-
ing a late referral (compared to lung cancer) included liver 
failure, kidney failure, lung disease other than cancer, liver 
cancer, rare cancers and ‘other’ non-malignant diagnoses. 
Decedents with dementia and stroke have an approxi-
mately five times greater chance of receiving a late referral 
compared with decedents with lung cancer.
Service provision across hospice sites
Across the 64 participating sites, all reported providing 
inpatient services. There was variation in further services 
being delivered with 48 (75%) reporting provision of outpa-
tient services, 55 (85.94%) providing day hospice services 
and 47 (73.44%) reporting provision community teams.
Regional variation in duration of hospice-based 
palliative care
As outlined in Table 3, across all sites, the case-mix was 
20.1% non-cancer to 79.9% cancer with variation by 
region of participating sites. Across the hospice sites, there

were significant differences in the ratio of non-cancer to 
cancer decedents: sites in Scotland and Wales had a sig-
nificantly greater proportion of decedents with cancer con-
ditions (to non-cancer patients) compared to sites within 
all regions in England. London had the highest proportion 
of non-cancer decedents.
Median number of days from referral to death varied by 
region, ranging from 56  days in Scotland to 17  days in 
Wales. Within England, there was a marked difference in 
referral to death between hospices in the North of England 
(35  days) compared with hospices in the Midlands (55 
 
days), London (49  days) and South of England (55  days). 
Furthermore, there were also clear differences in the staff-
ing of participating sites. Median WTE of palliative care 
doctors varied from 2.4 (Scotland) to 7.6 (Wales). For 
community teams, median WTE varied from 0 (Scotland) 
to 11 in North of England. However, there were notably 
fewer participating sites in Scotland and Wales which 
needs to be considered in the light of identified regional 
variation.
A multivariable negative binomial model was used to 
explore the association between referral to death days (out-
come variable) and patient-level factors (Table 4, model 
1). Overall, decedents had significantly fewer days of hos-
pice-based palliative care as their age increased. Compared 
to adults aged <50  years, adults aged 50–74  years had 7% 
fewer days of hospice-based palliative care. This relation-
ship was amplified for adults aged 75  years and over who

group’ and 18% lower for those with missing ethnicity 
data. For diagnosis, compared to decedents with cancer 
conditions, the number of days between referral to death 
was 18% lower for decedents with non-cancer conditions 
and 24% lower for those with missing diagnosis.
Model 2 explored the association between referral to 
death days and site-level factors (Table 4). The model 
identified that, compared with decedents from hospices in 
the North of England, the number of days between referral 
and death was 23% higher for decedents from the Midlands 
and East of England and 15% higher for decedents from 
the South of England. All other site-level factors were not 
associated with a difference in referral to death days, with 
the exception of decedents from hospices with 4–5 WTE 
doctors which was associated with an 18% increase in 
referral to death days compared to decedents from hos-
pices with 0–3 WTE doctors.
A final fully adjusted multivariable model (Table 4, 
model 3) indicated that increasing age persisted as a sig-
nificant predictor of fewer referral to death days, as did 
being male, having missing ethnic background and having 
a non-cancer diagnosis. In this model, in contrast to Model 
1, a trend towards increased referral to death time for peo-
ple of Asian and Black backgrounds compared to people 
with White background was observed (although only sig-
nificant for Asian background). As with Model 2, the site-
level factors were not associated with changes in the time 
between referral and death.
Discussion
Main findings
This study presents the first national-level description of 
the duration of UK hospice-based palliative care prior to 
death. We found that over half of all patients were referred 
to hospice-based palliative care less than 7  weeks before 
death, and 40% were referred less than 30  days before 
death. Referrals include those made to hospice beds, day 
hospice services and hospice community teams. This 
national study highlights that, despite increasing rhetoric 
around early referral to palliative care, patients with 
advanced disease continue to receive referrals to hospice-
based palliative care late in their illness trajectory. This 
could be indicative of a missed opportunity to do better for 
patients, their families, and optimise the use of health ser-
vices.22 Furthermore, there are marked differences between 
the duration of hospice-based palliative care for those with 
cancer (around 7  weeks) when compared to patients with 
non-cancer conditions (less than 4  weeks). The latter 
group makes up around a quarter of the case-mix of par-
ticipating hospices, despite accounting for more than two 
thirds of deaths from advanced chronic illness.23 Known 
inequities in the provision of specialist palliative care24 
were also reinforced, with fewer days of palliative care 
persisting with increasing age and being male. In addition, 
there was widespread variation in the types of services 
available across different regions of the United Kingdom, 
including the staffing levels of palliative care medical and 
hospice community nursing teams. While multiple factors 
may be driving differences, these may be a further mani-
festation of variation in commissioning of palliative care 
services across England.25 An initial response to these data 
could be to consider how inequity in timing of referral 
could be addressed and to better understand how appropri-
ate and timely referrals would be reflected in across the 
different diseases and age groups.
The delivery of this study involved the development 
and implementation of an approach to securely capture 
data from multiple hospices sites where a variety of elec-
tronic clinical record systems were in use. This was an 
important development to arise from the study, facilitating 
research participation by UK hospices and creating path-
ways for national hospice-level data initiatives. The 
approach to secure data capture has enabled the first 
nationwide picture to be reported, contrasting with exist-
ing smaller, single-centre reports. Capturing and using 
data in this way highlights the value of routine data use in 
palliative care to support efficient evaluation of care for 
patients and families. The approach adopted in this study 
could be adapted for other international contexts. This 
would enable countries outside the United Kingdom to 
generate comparative data to benchmark timing of refer-
rals to palliative care. These data are important to capture 
and reflect in the context of increasing evidence in support 
of earlier referral to palliative care.
Strengths and weaknesses/limitations of the 
study
Our study has some limitations. The response rate of 33% 
was lower than expected but the sample reflects the diver-
sity of UK hospices based on location, size, staffing data 
and included both charity-funded and NHS-managed sites.26 
The use of routine data limits the extent to which robust 
conclusions can be made about the reported duration and 
variations in hospice-based palliative care delivery, particu-
larly with ethnicity data, where there was a large proportion 
of missing data. From data requested from sites, we only 
received a single diagnosis linked to a referral, missing any 
co-morbid diagnoses. For ethnicity data, we did not assess 
the extent to which submitted data matched the profile of 
ethnicity for the catchment area of hospices, leaving us una-
ble to determine the representativeness of these data. In 
order to balance answering research questions with ease of 
participation for sites, we reduced the extent of data granu-
larity. For referral data, we requested date of referral and did 
not collect contextual information (e.g. reason and source of 
referral). At the patient level, we omitted requests for data 
on known inequity that may be difficult to identify (such as 
 Allsop et al. 
1331
patients identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgen-
der, those with mental health needs, those who are home-
less). Furthermore, we acknowledge that extraction of 
requested data may have biased respondents to those who 
could extract data through adequate information and com-
munications technology infrastructure. From data submitted 
by sites, while such an assumption was not made, we cannot 
indicate the presence, magnitude or quality of interaction 
with a service following referral.
What this study adds
Recent projections of demand for palliative care by 2040 
suggest healthcare systems need to adapt to the age-related 
growth in deaths from chronic illness, with dementia and 
cancer likely to be the main drivers of increased need.27 
Findings from this study suggest there may be a need for 
reorientation of services to both older age groups and non-
cancer conditions; both groups are associated with limited 
duration of hospice-based palliative care prior to death. The 
remit of palliative care has expanded to have relevance for 
any patient at an early stage in the disease process whose 
death can be medically anticipated.28 Such a broad remit, 
when people are living longer with an increased illness bur-
den, suggests that many patients will need primary, second-
ary and specialist palliative care. With increasing calls to 
reduce hospital bed days in the last months of life and to 
support preferences for home death, it is particularly impor-
tant that community-based specialist palliative care can 
consider how provision might match demand.
The findings in this study reflect the UK context, where 
paradoxically palliative care is ranked top of 40 countries 
measured in a ‘quality of death’ index, based on palliative 
service provision, access to opioids and a national strategic 
approach.29 Globally, few countries have similar levels of 
integration of palliative care within wider health services.19 
However, despite an excellent range of charitable and NHS 
palliative services, inequity remains apparent in the United 
Kingdom, particularly for those in older age groups and 
those living with non-cancer conditions. This study con-
firms that these groups are receiving less hospice-based pal-
liative care prior to death. Further research is needed to 
understand whether such late referrals to palliative care are 
reflective of appropriate clinical management by others or 
indicate wider cultural and societal barriers to accessing UK 
hospice care at a more appropriate time in an illness trajec-
tory. This study focused on hospice-based palliative care 
delivered in the United Kingdom. This forms a key compo-
nent of a complex network of providers contributing to pal-
liative care delivery. Barriers to accessing hospice services 
clearly remain, though we cannot determine what these are 
nor where they lie. Solutions to reducing inequity and 
increasing integration will need to include hospices but will 
not be confined to them if change is to occur. Future research 
examining associations with duration of palliative care 
across generalist and hospital-based palliative care delivery 
will help to complete the picture.
