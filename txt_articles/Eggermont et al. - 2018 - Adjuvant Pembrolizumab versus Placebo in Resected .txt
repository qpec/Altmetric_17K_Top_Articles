BACKGROUND
The programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab has been found to prolong 
progression-free and overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma. We con-
ducted a phase 3 double-blind trial to evaluate pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy in 
patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma.
METHODS
Patients with completely resected stage III melanoma were randomly assigned (with 
stratification according to cancer stage and geographic region) to receive 200 mg of 
pembrolizumab (514 patients) or placebo (505 patients) intravenously every 3 weeks for 
a total of 18 doses (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence or unacceptable 
toxic effects occurred. Recurrence-free survival in the overall intention-to-treat popula-
tion and in the subgroup of patients with cancer that was positive for the PD-1 ligand 
(PD-L1) were the primary end points. Safety was also evaluated.
RESULTS
At a median follow-up of 15 months, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly 
longer recurrence-free survival than placebo in the overall intention-to-treat population 
(1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 75.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 71.3 to 78.9] vs. 
61.0% [95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1]; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to 
0.74; P<0.001) and in the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1–positive tumors (1-year rate 
of recurrence-free survival, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9] in the pembrolizumab group and 
62.6% [95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.69; 
P<0.001). Adverse events of grades 3 to 5 that were related to the trial regimen were reported 
in 14.7% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 3.4% of patients in the placebo 
group. There was one treatment-related death due to myositis in the pembrolizumab group.
CONCLUSIONS
As adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage III melanoma, 200 mg of pembrolizumab ad-
ministered every 3 weeks for up to 1 year resulted in significantly longer recurrence-
free survival than placebo, with no new toxic effects identified. (Funded by Merck;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he development of effective adju-
vant therapies for patients with high-risk 
melanoma has been preceded by the re-
cent arrival of active agents to treat metastatic 
melanoma, including ipilimumab (an anti-CTLA4 
antibody), pembrolizumab and nivolumab (both 
monoclonal antibodies against programmed 
death 1 [PD-1]), and combination BRAF and MEK 
inhibition for patients whose tumors harbor a 
BRAF mutation.1-6 Pembrolizumab has been found 
to be associated with longer progression-free 
survival and overall survival in advanced mela-
noma than ipilimumab, regardless of PD-1 ligand 
(PD-L1) expression level and BRAF mutation 
status.5 Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy of 
these drugs as adjuvant therapy for patients with 
resected high-risk melanoma have been under-
taken. In 2015, ipilimumab was approved on the 
basis of a significant advantage over placebo 
with regard to recurrence-free survival in resected 
stage III melanoma, and a similar advantage for 
overall survival was shown in 2016.7,8 In 2017, 
dabrafenib–trametinib and nivolumab were in-
dependently shown to have efficacy in resected 
BRAF-mutant melanoma of stage III and in re-
sected BRAF-mutant and BRAF–wild-type mela-
noma of stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV, respectively.9,10 The 
European Organization for Research and Treat-
ment of Cancer (EORTC) 1325 (KEYNOTE-054) 
trial involved the same high-risk patient popula-
tion with stage III melanoma as the EORTC 
18071 trial of ipilimumab versus placebo, which 
limits its trial population to patients with stage 
IIIA disease who have a high risk of recurrence 
based on tumor load in the sentinel node (diam-
eter, >1 mm, according to the Rotterdam Crite-
ria).11-13 In the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 
EORTC 1325 trial, we compared pembrolizumab 
(200 mg every 3 weeks) with matching placebo 
as adjuvant therapy for patients with resected, 
high-risk stage III melanoma.
Methods
Patients
We enrolled patients who were 18 years of age or 
older and had histologically confirmed cutane-
ous melanoma with metastasis to regional lymph 
nodes. The patients had to have either stage IIIA 
melanoma (patients with stage N1a melanoma 
had to have at least one micrometastasis mea-
suring >1 mm in greatest diameter) or stage IIIB 
or IIIC disease with no in-transit metastases as 
defined by the American Joint Committee on 
Cancer 2009 classification, 7th edition.14 A com-
plete regional lymphadenectomy was required to 
have been performed within 13 weeks before the 
start of treatment. Exclusion criteria included an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status score of more than 1 (scores 
range from 0 to 5, with higher numbers indicat-
ing greater disability), autoimmune disease, uncon-
trolled infections, use of systemic glucocorticoids, 
and previous systemic therapy for melanoma.
A tumor sample from melanoma-positive 
lymph nodes was required to be sent for central 
pathological evaluation of PD-L1 expression. 
Membranous expression of PD-L1 in tumor and 
tumor-associated immune cells was assessed by 
means of a clinical trial immunohistochemistry 
assay (22C3 antibody) and was scored on a scale 
of 0 to 5 that has been developed specifically for 
melanoma (with higher numbers reflecting a 
higher level of PD-L1 expression); a score of 2 or 
higher (i.e., staining on >1% of cells) was con-
sidered to indicate PD-L1 positivity.15
Trial Design
Registration was performed centrally at the 
EORTC headquarters. A central interactive voice-
response system was used for randomization, 
which was based on a minimization technique. 
Randomization was stratified according to stage 
(stage IIIA, stage IIIB, stage IIIC with one to 
three positive nodes, or stage IIIC with four or 
more positive nodes) and geographic region (17 
regions, each formed by 1 to 3 countries). Only 
the local pharmacists were aware of trial-group 
assignments, whereas the clinical investigators, 
patients, and those collecting or analyzing the 
data were not.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive either an intravenous infusion of 200 mg 
of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for 
a total of 18 doses (approximately 1 year [part 1 of 
the trial]) or until disease recurrence, unaccept-
able toxic effects, a major protocol violation, or 
withdrawal of consent occurred (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). The rules regard-
ing the withholding of a dose of pembrolizumab 
or placebo and the management of immune-
related adverse events are detailed in the proto-
col, available at NEJM.org. If a recurrence was

documented, patients were eligible for crossover 
or repeat treatment with pembrolizumab (part 2 
of the trial).
The primary end point was recurrence-free 
survival in the overall intention-to-treat population 
and in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1–
positive tumors. Secondary end points included 
distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, 
safety measures, and measures of health-related 
quality of life.
Assessments
Computed tomography, magnetic resonance im-
aging, or both were performed every 12 weeks 
for the first 2 years, every 6 months through 
year 5, then annually. Recurrence or metastatic 
lesions had to be histologically confirmed when-
ever possible. The first date when recurrence was 
observed was taken into account.
Recurrence-free survival was defined as the 
time from randomization until the date of first 
recurrence (local, regional, or distant metasta-
sis) or death from any cause. For patients with-
out any event, follow-up was censored at the 
latest disease evaluation performed according to 
the trial protocol.
Data on adverse events were collected for 
each treatment course with the use of the Na-
tional Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Immune-
related adverse events were programmatically 
determined from a predefined list of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms, 
which was updated in accordance with each new 
version of MedDRA.
Trial Oversight
The trial protocol was approved by the EORTC 
protocol review committee and independent ethics 
committees. The trial was conducted in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with 
Good Clinical Practice as defined by the Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonisation. All patients 
provided written informed consent.
The trial was sponsored by Merck and was 
designed by the academic authors. Data were 
collected, computerized, and analyzed at the 
EORTC headquarters. All the authors participated 
in the revision and finalization of the manuscript 
and approved submission of the manuscript for 
publication. The authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and for the adher-
ence of the trial to the protocol. No one who is 
not an author contributed to the writing of the 
manuscript.
The EORTC independent data and safety 
monitoring committee assessed the safety data 
twice per year, without formal stopping rules. In 
December 2017, the independent data and safety 
monitoring committee also assessed the first 
analysis of recurrence-free survival, which was 
performed by an independent statistician. On-site 
source-data verification was provided by a clini-
cal research organization.
Statistical Analysis
We planned for the trial to include 900 patients. 
We determined that a total of 409 events (recur-
rences or deaths without recurrences) would be 
required in order to provide 92% power to detect 
a hazard ratio for recurrence or death of 0.70, 
corresponding to a 1-year recurrence-free sur-
vival rate of 58.3% in the placebo group versus 
68.5% in the pembrolizumab group and a 3-year 
recurrence-free survival rate of 35.3% in the pla-
cebo group versus 48.3% in the pembrolizumab 
group, at a one-sided alpha level of 1.4%. If the 
results in the overall intention-to-treat popula-
tion were significant, the treatment comparison 
would be performed in the subgroup of patients 
with PD-L1–positive tumors at a one-sided alpha 
level of 2.5%.16
In July 2017, the positive results of the Check-
Mate 238 trial, in which the effect of adjuvant 
therapy in melanoma with nivolumab or ipilimu-
mab was evaluated, were announced, and they 
were subsequently published in September 2017.10 
The estimated hazard ratio for disease recur-
rence or death in association with nivolumab 
versus ipilimumab was 0.65 (97.56% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.83), on the basis of an 
interim analysis. In August 2017, the EORTC 
1325 protocol was amended to include an inter-
im analysis of recurrence-free survival based on 
the 1019 patients who underwent randomization, 
conducted with the use a Lan–DeMets alpha 
spending function with an O’Brien–Fleming 
boundary.17 At the clinical cutoff date (October 2, 
2017), 351 events (recurrences or deaths) had 
been reported in the intention-to-treat popula-
tion. The interim analysis was performed at a 
one-sided alpha level of 0.8% (two-sided alpha 
level, 1.6%). In December 2017, the independent 
data and safety monitoring committee reviewed

the unblinded results and recommended the re-
porting of the primary end points and safety. 
Because the results were positive in the intention-
to-treat population, the interim analysis of recur-
rence-free survival became the final analysis. To 
preserve the alpha error, a hierarchical testing 
approach will be applied to the two remaining 
efficacy end points — distant metastasis–free 
survival first, and then overall survival (see the 
protocol).
The recurrence-free survival distribution was 
estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, and 
the confidence intervals for the 12- and 18-month 
survival rates were obtained with the Greenwood 
variance formula. Comparisons between the 
trial groups were performed with the use of 
a log-rank test stratified according to disease 
stage at randomization, at a two-sided alpha 
level. A Cox proportional-hazards model strati-
fied according to disease stage as provided at 
randomization was used to estimate the hazard 
ratio and its corresponding confidence interval, 
which was 98.4% (100 minus 1.6) for the total 
patient population and 95% (100 minus [2 times 
2.5]) for the PD-L1–positive subgroup.
For exploratory purposes, we investigated the 
predictive importance of several factors with re-
gard to the differences in recurrence-free sur-
vival. Forest plots were produced, and a test of 
interaction between each variable and the trial 
group in a Cox model was conducted. For these 
subgroup analyses, the hazard ratios were plot-
ted along with their 99% confidence intervals.
The primary analysis of recurrence-free sur-
vival included all the patients who underwent 
randomization, according to the intention-to-
treat principle. The safety profile was assessed 
in the group of patients who started their ran-
domly assigned trial regimen. All analyses were 
performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute), and the power calculations were per-
formed with East software, version 6.4 (Cytel).
Results
Patients and Trial Regimen
From August 2015 through November 2016, a 
total of 1019 patients underwent randomization 
at 123 centers in 23 countries: 514 patients were 
assigned to the pembrolizumab group, and 505 
were assigned to the placebo group. The charac-
teristics of the patients at baseline were similar 
in the two groups (Table 1).
Eight patients did not start the regimen that 
had been randomly assigned (Fig. 1). The median 
number of doses received was 18 (interquartile 
range, 9 to 18) in the pembrolizumab group and 
18 (interquartile range, 8 to 18) in the placebo 
group.
Of the 509 patients who started pembrolizu-
mab, 70 (13.8%) discontinued the regimen owing 
to an adverse event; in 66 patients (13.0%), the 
event was considered by the investigators to be 
drug-related. Among the 502 patients who re-
ceived placebo, 11 (2.2%) discontinued the regi-
men owing to an adverse event; in 8 patients 
(1.6%), the event was considered to be placebo-
related. A total of 109 patients (21.4%) in the 
pembrolizumab group discontinued the regimen 
because of disease recurrence, as compared with 
179 patients (35.7%) in the placebo group. A 
total of 282 patients (55.4%) in the pembrolizu-
mab group and 294 (58.6%) in the placebo group 
completed the 1-year treatment period (Fig. 1). 
The overall median duration of follow-up was 
15.1 months — 14.7 months in the pembrolizu-
mab group and 15.4 months in the placebo group.
Efficacy
Overall Intention-to-Treat Population
In the overall intention-to-treat population, the 
12-month rate of recurrence-free survival was 
75.4% (95% CI, 71.3 to 78.9) in the pembrolizu-
mab group and 61.0% (95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1) in 
the placebo group (Fig. 2A). Recurrence-free 
survival was significantly longer in the pembro-
lizumab group than in the placebo group (haz-
ard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 
0.43 to 0.74; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). The results were 
similar in the per-protocol population (hazard 
ratio for recurrence or death, stratified accord-
ing to stage, 0.56; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to 0.74; 
P<0.001). At 18 months, the rates of recurrence-
free survival in the intention-to-treat population 
were 71.4% (95% CI, 66.8 to 75.4) in the pem-
brolizumab group and 53.2% (95% CI, 47.9 to 
58.2) in the placebo group.
A total of 351 patients had a first recurrence 
of disease or died: 135 in the pembrolizumab 
group and 216 in the placebo group. There were 
78 patients (15.2%) in the pembrolizumab group 
in whom distant metastases developed, alone or 
combined with locoregional recurrences, as com-
pared with 138 patients (27.3%) in the placebo 
group (Fig. 2A). The 18-month cumulative inci-
dence of distant metastasis being the first site of

recurrence was 16.7% and 29.7% respectively 
(hazard ratio, 0.53; 99% CI, 0.37 to 0.76) (Fig. S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Recurrence-free Survival According to Tumor PD-L1 
Expression
In the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1–
positive tumors (melanoma score, ≥2), the 
12-month recurrence-free survival rate was 77.1% 
(95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9) in the pembrolizumab 
group and 62.6% (95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0) in the 
placebo group (Fig. 2B). Recurrence-free survival 
was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab 
group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio 
for recurrence or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to 
0.69; P<0.001). Pembrolizumab was also consis-
tently effective in patients with PD-L1–negative 
tumors (Figs. 2C and 3) and in those with unde-
termined tumor PD-L1 expression (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Recurrence-free Survival According to Other 
Variables
The between-group difference in recurrence-free 
survival was consistently observed across sub-
groups that were based on baseline characteris-
tics (Fig. 3). The benefit from pembrolizumab 
was similar in patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, or 
IIIC disease; the 12-month rate of recurrence-
free survival among patients with stage IIIB or 
IIIC disease in the pembrolizumab group was 
72.2% (95% CI, 67.6 to 76.2). The benefit from 
pembrolizumab was also similar in patients

The intention-to-treat population included all patients who underwent ran-
domization. The safety population included all patients who started the tri-
al regimen to which they had been randomly assigned. The per-protocol 
population included all eligible patients (i.e., those who did not have a ma-
jor violation of eligibility criteria) who started the trial regimen to which 
they had been randomly assigned. In total, 10 patients in the pembrolizum-
ab group (9 of whom started treatment) and 6 patients in the placebo

of Recurrence-free Survival, as Assessed by Local  
Investigators, in the Overall Intention-to-Treat  
Population and According to Tumor Programmed 
Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression.
The log-rank test stratified according to disease stage 
at randomization was used to draw inferences. The es-
timate of the hazard ratio was based on a Cox model 
stratified according to disease stage at randomization. 
In the overall intention-to-treat population, there were 
132 locoregional recurrences (55 in the pembrolizumab 
group and 77 in the placebo group), 183 distant metas-
tases (69 in the pembrolizumab group and 114 in the 
placebo group), 33 concomitant locoregional and dis-
tant metastases (9 in the pembrolizumab group and 
24 in the placebo group), and 3 deaths (2 in the pem-
brolizumab group and 1 in the placebo group). The 
12-month rate of recurrence-free survival was 75.4% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 71.3 to 78.9) in the pem-
brolizumab group and 61.0% (95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1) in 
the placebo group, and the 18-month rate of recurrence-
free survival was 71.4% (95% CI, 66.8 to 75.4) in the 
pembrolizumab group and 53.2% (95% CI, 47.9 to 58.2) 
in the placebo group. Among patients with positive 
PD-L1 tumor expression (melanoma score, 2 to 5),  
the 12-month recurrence-free survival rate was 77.1% 
(95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9) in the pembrolizumab group 
and 62.6% (95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0) in the placebo group. 
Among patients with negative PD-L1 tumor expression 
(melanoma score, 0 or 1), the 12-month recurrence-
free survival rate was 72.2% (95% CI, 58.6 to 82.0) in 
the pembrolizumab group and 52.2% (95% CI, 38.2 to 
64.5) in the placebo group.

Figure 3. Forest Plot of Recurrence-free Survival According to Subgroup.
An unstratified univariate Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratios for the risk of recurrence or death in the pembrolizumab 
group as compared with the placebo group among all the patients. An unstratified Cox model including the trial group, a covariate of in-
terest (e.g., age 18 to <65 vs. ≥65 years) and the interaction term (e.g., age × treatment) was used to perform the interaction test and 
estimate the hazard ratios for the subgroups. P values were yielded by the test of the treatment difference in the overall intention-to-
treat population or by the test of interaction; for each, the Wald test was used. The sizes of the blue boxes are nonlinearly proportional 
to the numbers of events. The green diamond is centered on the overall hazard ratio (dashed line) and covers its 98.4% confidence in-
terval. In the subgroup analyses, 99% confidence intervals (blue lines) are presented. Data on lymph-node and ulceration status were 
not available for 133 patients; data on BRAF mutation status were not available for 65 patients, and the BRAF mutation present differed 
from V600E in 112 patients. P<0.001 in the unadjusted analysis of the overall effect of pembrolizumab versus placebo on recurrence-

ference in recurrence-free survival between the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups (Fig. 3, and 
Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
For instance, the between-group difference was 
similar among men regardless of whether they 
were obese or had a normal body-mass index.
Safety
Adverse events of any grade that were considered 
to be related to the trial regimen occurred in 396 
patients (77.8%) in the pembrolizumab group 
and in 332 patients (66.1%) in the placebo group 
(Table 2). The rates of fatigue or asthenia and of 
diarrhea were similar in the two trial groups. 
Adverse events of grade 3, 4, or 5 that were 
related to the trial regimen occurred in 14.7% of 
patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 
3.4% in the placebo group. There was one pem-
brolizumab-related death due to myositis.
Immune-related adverse events of any grade 
occurred in 190 (37.3%) patients in the pembro-
lizumab group and in 45 (9.0%) patients in the 
placebo group. A higher incidence of endocrine 
disorders occurred in the pembrolizumab group 
than in the placebo group (23.4% in the pembro-
lizumab group and 5.0% in the placebo group); 
the most common endocrine disorders were 
hypothyroidism (14.3% and 2.8%) and hyperthy-
roidism (10.2% and 1.2%), and all cases were of 
grade 1 or 2 except one case of grade 3 hyper-
thyroidism. The incidence of sarcoidosis was low 
(1.4% and 0%), and all cases were of grade 1 or 
2. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 immune-related 
adverse events was also low (7.1% and 0.6%); 
grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events in-
cluded colitis (2.0% and 0.2%), hypophysitis or 
hypopituitarism (0.6% and 0%), and type 1 dia-
betes mellitus (1.0% and 0%). In the pembrolizu-
mab group, a total of 43 grade 3 or 4 immune-
related adverse events occurred in 36 patients 
(7.1%). Among these events, 34 resolved, includ-
ing 21 within 2 months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab.
Discussion
In this randomized, phase 3 trial involving pa-
tients with resected, high-risk stage III melano-
ma, pembrolizumab was associated with a rate 
of recurrence-free survival at 1 year that was 
significantly higher than that with placebo. The 
risk of recurrence or death in the total popula-
tion was 43% lower in the pembrolizumab group 
than in the placebo group; the risk was 46% 
lower in the pembrolizumab group than in the 
placebo group among patients with PD-L1–posi-
tive tumors, with similar results in the subgroup 
with PD-L1–negative tumors. In the overall inten-
tion-to-treat population, the estimated between-
group difference in the 18-month rate of recur-
rence-free survival was 18.2 percentage points 
(71.4% for pembrolizumab vs. 53.2% for placebo). 
These data provide more evidence that drugs 
that are effective in advanced melanoma also 
have effectiveness as adjuvant therapy.18
The EORTC 1325 trial will continue to its 
secondary end points, distant metastasis-free 
survival and overall survival. We recently found 
that the effects of treatment on recurrence-free 
survival correlate very well with the effects on 
overall survival in trials of adjuvant therapy with 
interferon alfa and with ipilimumab in high-risk 
melanoma.19 Therefore, one may reasonably expect 
that the benefit of pembrolizumab for relapse-free 
survival that we have found in our trial will trans-
late into an overall survival benefit, unless effec-
tive post-relapse treatments compensate for the 
initial disadvantage; this is a question that may 
be answered by the crossover design of the trial.
Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy, which in 
this analysis had a rate of grade 3 or higher 
treatment-related adverse events of 14.7%, ap-
pears to be less toxic than ipilimumab (45.9%) 
and similar to nivolumab (14.4%). There was one 
pembrolizumab-related death (0.2%), as com-
pared with none with nivolumab and five (1.1%) 
with ipilimumab in the respective trials of these 
agents as adjuvant therapy.7,8,10 The immune-related 
adverse events that were relatively frequent in 
association with pembrolizumab were hypothy-
roidism (14.3%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2%), 
pneumonitis (3.3%), and sarcoidosis (1.4%), with 
the majority of events being of grade 1 or 2. The 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 immune-related ad-
verse events was low (7.1%), and most events 
resolved within 2 months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab, findings similar to those in ad-
vanced melanoma.20,21
Adjuvant therapy for high-risk melanoma has 
improved, with pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
now available as effective agents, along with the 
combination of dabrafenib and trametinib as an 
additional option for BRAF-mutant melanoma.

The safety analysis included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of trial agent 
(1011 patients). Listed are the adverse events that were reported between the first dose and 30 days after the last dose; 
for all serious adverse events and serious immune-related adverse events, a time limit of 90 days after the last dose 
was used. All adverse events correspond to part 1 of the trial (the 1-year adjuvant-therapy period) and not to part 2  
(in which patients with disease recurrence were eligible to cross over or receive repeat treatment with pembrolizumab). 
The severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.0.
†  
The investigators determined whether adverse events were related to a trial agent. Adverse events and immune-related 
adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of patients or those that were considered to be medically relevant are re-
ported. Patients may have had more than one event.

Adjuvant Pembrolizumab in Resected Stage III Melanoma
take years, the use of interferon alfa may con-
tinue; however, on the basis of the EORTC 18952 
and 18991 trials22-26 and an individual-patient data 
meta-analysis comprising all trials in which 
interferon alfa was compared with observation 
only,27 interferon alfa treatment would be limited 
to patients with stage IIB or III disease with ulcer-
ated melanoma.
Although completion lymph-node dissection 
has been a mandatory component in all adjuvant 
phase 3 trials to date, in light of the results of 
the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial 
(MSLT-II) and the Dermatologic Cooperative On-
cology Group (DeCOG) trial18,28-30 it is no longer 
considered mandatory. Since the hazard ratios 
for recurrence or death among the sentinel node–
positive patients in the nivolumab, pembrolizu-
mab, and dabrafenib–trametinib trials are low, 
adjuvant therapy also seems reasonable in pa-
tients in this group who are not undergoing 
a completion lymph-node dissection; however, 
it must be acknowledged that data from these 
trials do not speak directly to this point.
In conclusion, pembrolizumab as adjuvant 
therapy for patients with resected, high-risk 
stage III melanoma was associated with a sig-
nificantly longer recurrence-free survival than 
placebo and had a safety profile consistent with 
the toxicity spectrum that has already been de-
fined for the drug.
