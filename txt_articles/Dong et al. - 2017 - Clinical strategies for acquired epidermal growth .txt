ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (EGFRm+) occur in 10–35% 
of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR TKIs are standard treatments for NSCLC patients 
harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R point mutations. Despite initial 
benefit, most patients develop drug resistance, posing a challenge to oncologists. The 
secondary T790M point mutation in EGFR exon 20 contributes to approximately 60% 
of resistance cases. Optimum strategies for overcoming acquired EGFR TKI resistance 
are not clearly defined, although current common practice is to switch to platinum-
based chemotherapy following resistance onset. While the second-generation EGFR 
TKIs, including afatinib, dacomitinib, and neratinib, exhibit promising preclinical 
activity against T790M mutants, dose-limiting toxicities in patients have limited 
clinical success. However, third generation EGFR TKIs appear able to overcome this 
mutation. Other treatment options aimed at EGFR TKI resistance include use of an 
EGFR TKI beyond progression, and chemotherapy plus an EGFR TKI. This review 
focuses on improved anticancer agents and therapy options for NSCLC patients with 
acquired EGFR TKI resistance.
INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide, and non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) accounts for 80–85% of all lung cancer cases [1]. 
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations 
(EGFRm+), such as exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R 
point mutations, occur in 10–35% of NSCLCs and confer 
sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
[2, 3]. EGFRm+ NSCLC patients benefit from treatment 
with first-generation EGFR TKIs (reversible, not mutant 
selective), such as erlotinib and gefitinib, which are the 
standard first-line therapy for these patients. However, most 
patients develop drug resistance within approximately one 
year of treatment due to various mechanisms [4, 5]. The 
secondary T790M point mutation in exon 20 contributes 
to approximately 60% of resistance cases. Additionally, 
about 30% of EGFRm+ patients show primary resistance to 
EGFR TKIs, and the factors involved in de novo resistance 
remain unidentified. Although the second-generation EGFR 
TKIs (irreversible, potent, not mutant selective), including 
afatinib, dacomitinib, and neratinib, exhibited promising 
preclinical activity against T790M mutants, dose-limiting 
toxicities in patients inhibited clinical success. Therefore, 
optimum treatments after disease progression resulting 
from acquired EGFR TKI resistance are not clearly 
defined. Switching EGFR TKI resistant patient treatment 
strategies to platinum-based chemotherapy is common 
practice. Fortunately, third-generation EGFR TKIs (mutant 
selective), such as osimertinib, rociletinib, and olmutinib, 
can overcome resistance resulting from T790M mutation 
[6–8]. For example, in 2015, osimertinib was approved 
for T790M-positive patients who had progressed on prior 
systemic therapy. Other treatment options aimed at EGFR 
TKI resistance include use of an EGFR TKI beyond 
progression, and chemotherapy plus an EGFR TKI.

Since drug resistance to EGFR TKIs is a major clinical 
obstacle, and optimum treatment strategies are still elusive, 
this review focuses on anticancer agents and treatment 
options aimed at EGFR TKI resistant cases to better guide 
oncologists making clinical decisions.
MECHANISMS OF ACQUIRED RESISTANCE 
TO EGFR TKIS
Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC 
patients is defined as disease progression after a period 
of clinical benefit, and is categorized into three clinical 
groups: central nervous system sanctuary progressive 
disease (PD); oligo-PD; and systemic PD [9, 10]. The 
mechanisms involved can include secondary mutations 
in EGFR, bypass or alternative pathway activation, and 
histological and phenotypic transformations (Table 1). 
Several acquired-resistance mechanisms and candidates 
could also act as both rational targets and biomarkers. The 
best studied of these is the T790M mutation in exon 20. 
Additionally, MET mutations and amplifications, and 
amplifications of the MET ligand are also potential 
predictive biomarkers for NSCLC patient treatment 
outcomes, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor 
 
(IGF-1R) is a biomarker for TKI resistance [11, 12].
Secondary mutations in EGFR
Secondary EGFR mutation is the most frequent 
mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. The 
secondary point mutation, T790M in exon 20, contributes 
to approximately 60% of drug resistance cases. [4, 5]. With 
the steric hindrance of the bulky methionine sidechain, 
T790M restores the kinase’s adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
affinity back to wild type levels, eventually re-establishing 
ATP as the favored substrate rather than the EGFR TKI 
[13]. Other rare EGFR point mutations resulting in 
resistance include, A761T, T854A, and L747S [14–16].
Bypass or alternative pathway activation
MET signaling activates various pathways, such as 
PI3K/AKT, RAS-RAF-ERK1/2, and STAT3, promoting 
angiogenesis and tumor cell growth, survival, migration, 
invasion, and metastasis [11]. MET amplification, identified 
in 5–10% of resistant tumors, is the main mechanism by 
which EGFR inhibition is bypassed, allowing for drug 
resistance via ERBB3-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT 
downstream signaling [17]. Other bypass mechanisms 
include, PIK3CA mutation, HER2 amplification, BRAF 
(V600E, G469A) mutation, and AXL activation [18–20].
Histological and phenotypic transformation
After an initial response to EGFR TKIs, EGFRm+ 
NSCLC can transform to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [18]. 
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which 
renders cells more migratory and invasive, is also observed 
in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor specimens [21]. EMT may 
be induced and controlled by multiple pathways, including 
Wnt, NFκB, and TGF-β signaling, as well as growth 
factors, such as FGF and EGF. Jakobsen, et al. found that 
erlotinib increased IGF1R activation, restoring PI3K/AKT 
and MAPK signaling, and triggering IGF1R-dependent 
EMT [22]. Alternatively, cancer cells treated with erlotinib 
may benefit from TGF-β signaling, which initiates EMT by 
inhibiting the miR-200 family, upregulating mesenchymal 
transcription factors and thus the EGFR repressor, 
MIG6, and restoring PI3K/AKT signaling. EMT is likely 
important in the development of NSCLC acquired EGFR 
TKI resistance, and influences TKI treatment response. 
EMT status may therefore be useful as a prognostic 
indicator and in treatment strategy decision-making in 
NSCLC.
CLINICAL STRATEGIES FOLLOWING 
EGFR TKI ACQUIRED RESISTANCE IN 
NSCLC
There are currently no standardized clinical 
strategies for NSCLC patients with EGFR TKI 
acquired resistance. Treatment options usually include 
chemotherapy, third generation EGFR TKIs, EGFR TKI 
treatment beyond progression, and chemotherapy plus an 
EGFR TKI (Figure 1).
Chemotherapy
When first-line EGFR TKI acquired resistance 
causes clinical progression, NSCLC patients are commonly 
switched onto platinum-based chemotherapeutics, which 
often provide palliative benefit. Second-line platinum-
based combination therapies led to better overall survival 
(OS) than single agents or erlotinib, following the failure of 
first-line gefitinib treatment [23]. Second-line gemcitabine/
platinum therapy combination treatment resulted in better 
OS in EGFRm+ patients (p = 0.035), but not in those 
with wild-type EGFR (p = 0.785) [23]. Additionally, 
chemotherapy can allow for simultaneous re-challenge 
with a TKI; previously arrested TKI-sensitive cells may 
repopulate more quickly than TKI-resistant cells, and may 
therefore be efficiently inhibited using TKIs [24].
Third-generation EGFR TKIs
EGFRm+ NSCLC patients can benefit from 
treatment with first-generation EGFR TKIs, including 
erlotinib and gefitinib [25, 26]. However, most patients 
develop drug resistance, driven in about 60% of cases 
by the T790M mutation [27, 28]. Second-generation 
EGFR TKIs cannot overcome T790M-mediated drug 
resistance due to nonselective inhibition of wild-type

EGFR [6, 29, 30]. More recently, third-generation EGFR 
TKIs, including osimertinib, rociletinib, and olmutinib, have 
shown efficacy against the T790M mutation while sparing 
wild-type EGFR in vitro (Figure 2) [31, 32]. The third-
generation EGFR TKIs represent a promising approach 
to overcoming T790M-mediated resistance to first- and 
second-generation EGFR TKIs in NCSLC patients.
Osimertinib
Osimertinib (AZD9291; AstraZeneca) exhibits 
200-fold greater selectivity for the T790M/L858R 
EGFR than wild-type EGFR [33]. It has been hailed as a 
‘‘breakthrough” compound with perfect objective response 
rate (ORR) in T790M-positive NSCLC patients who had 
progressed on first-generation EGFR TKIs [34]. Preclinical 
studies confirmed osimertinib antitumor activity and 
reduced activity against wild-type EGFR in cell lines and 
tumor xenograft and transgenic mouse models harboring 
EGFRm+ and EGFR T790M [35]. The osimertinib ORR 
in the phase I clinical trial was 51%. In patients with 
confirmed EGFR T790M (n = 127), osimertinib had an 
ORR of 61% and median progression-free survival (mPFS) 
of 9.6 months, while T790M-negative patients (n = 61) had 
an ORR of 21% and mPFS of 2.8 months. [36] A pooled 
analysis of two phase II studies found that osimertinib ORR 
was 66% in T790M patients. Median duration of remission 
(DOR) was 12.5 months, and mPFS was 11.0 months. At 
12 months, 47.5% of patients were progression-free [37]. 
Osimertinib was approved in the US on November 13, 2015 
for use in patients with metastatic EGFR T790M-positive 
NSCLC who have progressed with EGFR TKI therapy.

Rociletinib
Rociletinib (CO-1686) is another small-molecule, 
irreversibly binding, mutant selective TKI that targets 
commonly mutated forms of EGFR while sparing the 
wild-type protein [38]. In a phase I/II study of rociletinib 
in EGFRm+ NSCLC patients who had progressed during 
EGFR TKI therapy, ORR and mPFS were 59% and 13.1 
months, respectively, in 46 T790M-positive patients, and 
29% and 5.6 months, respectively, in 17 T790M-negative 
patients. Unlike for earlier generation EGFR TKIs, 
treatment side effects, including paronychia, rash, stomatitis, 
and diarrhea, were uncommon in rociletinib-treated patients. 
One patient experienced a grade 1 rash, and grade 1–2 
diarrhea was observed in only 20% of patients [39].
Olmutinib
Like 
osimertinib 
and 
rociletinib, 
olmutinib 
(HM61713) is a third-generation EGFR TKI that selectively 
targets mutant EGFR. In a phase I/II study, olmutinib ORR 
was 58.8% and the disease control rate was 97.1% in 34 
T790M-positive NSCLC patients [40].
Chemotherapy plus EGFR TKI
Patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs may 
benefit from continued EGFR TKI therapy in combination 
with platinum-based chemotherapy. In a randomized, 
phase III, multicenter study, EGFRm+ patients with 
acquired resistance to gefitinib were randomly assigned 
(1:1) to either continued gefitinib treatment combined 
with pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy or placebo plus 
pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy. Ninety-eight (74%) 
patients progressed in the gefitinib plus chemotherapy 
group, and 107 (81%) progressed in the placebo plus 
chemotherapy group (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% CI = 
 
0.65–1.13; p = 0.27). mPFS was 5.4 months in both 
treatment groups (95% CI = 4.5–5.7 with gefitinib and 
4.6–5.5 with placebo). The results demonstrated that 
continuing gefitinib with chemotherapy after disease 
progression with gefitinib did not prolong patient PFS 
[41]. Additionally, continued gefitinib treatment with 
chemotherapy may be detrimental to patient OS, although 
these findings require further study [41].
Combined EGFR signaling pathway blockade
Targeting several levels of EGFR signaling is 
another strategy employed against acquired resistance 
to EGFR TKIs. Afatinib combined with the monoclonal 
anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximabhas, demonstrated robust 
clinical activity and a reasonable safety profile in patients 
with acquired gefitinib or erlotinib resistance, both 
with and without T790M mutations [42]. As previously 
discussed, bypass or alternative pathway activation can 
contribute to acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. Thus, 
treatment strategies that both maintain inhibition of EGFR 
signaling and inhibit bypass signaling may be efficacious 
against resistance. EGFR TKIs combined with the aPI3K 
inhibitor, buparlisib (BKM120), or MET inhibitors, such 
as cabozantinib, tivantinib, or INC280, are presently under 
investigation for use in resistant NSCLC cases [42, 43].
TKIs beyond progression
Discontinuing TKI treatment may lead to a disease 
flare [45]. In cases of isolated progression, such as in 
the central nervous system (CNS), local therapy plus 
targeted therapy may be efficacious in some patients 
 
[46, 47]. In patients with CNS metastasis, controlling brain 
lesions with radiotherapy is important for maintaining 
or improving quality of life and for prolonging survival 
[48]. The phase II, single-arm, open-label ASPIRATION 
(Asian Pacific trial of Tarceva as first-line in EGFR 
mutation) study investigated post-progression continued 
erlotinib therapy in NSCLC patients with activating EGFR 
mutations [49]. In this study, patients received erlotinib 
until progression, after which erlotinib was continued 
if deemed appropriate. Patients who received post-
progression erlotinib therapy had longer PFS, longer time 
from best overall response to progression, fewer new lung 
lesions, and better performance status at progression. The 
ASPIRATION trial showed that in clinically asymptomatic 
patients, maintaining EGFR TKI therapy as long as 
possible is a viable treatment option.

To effectively provide the best treatment options for 
each patient, the mechanisms underlying resistance onset 
must be better understood. Analyses of tumor samples 
from NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance 
could reveal molecular mechanisms of resistance. Thus, 
performing a biopsy at the time of acquired resistance may 
inform treatment decisions [50, 51]. Because procedures 
used to obtain tumor tissues are often invasive, analysis 
of circulating plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is 
released from tumors or circulating tumor cells and can be 
collected noninvasively, could provide tumor cell genetic 
information in many cases [52, 53].
Immunotherapy
Interest in immunotherapies for NSCLC treatment 
continues to grow. Preclinical evidence suggests that 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in EGFRm+ 
NSCLC may be constitutively driven by EGFR signaling. 
Preclinical EGFRm+ lung cancer models treated with PD-L1 
antibodies exhibited reduced tumor growth and increased 
survival [54]. However, clinical data suggest that anti-PD1 
immunotherapy may not be effective in EGFRm+ NSCLC.
CONCLUSIONS
Optimum treatment strategies for NSCLC patients 
with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs are currently 
unclear. This review summarized anticancer agents and 
clinical strategies employed following EGFR TKI acquired 
resistance onset in NSCLC patients, emphasizing therapeutic 
advances with improved outcomes. Current common 
practice is to switch to platinum-based chemotherapy 
following resistance onset. However, third-generation 
EGFR TKIs may overcome T790M-mediated resistance 
to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in NCSLC 
patients. In asymptomatic/oligo-metastic progression cases, 
localized therapies followed by continuation of EGFR TKI 
treatment may be a viable strategy.
