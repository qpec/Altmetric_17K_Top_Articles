Abstract
Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Since 
fatigue was first described as a common feature of PD 20 years ago, little progress has been made 
in understanding its causes or treatment. Importantly, PD patients attending the 2013 World 
Parkinson Congress voted fatigue as the leading symptom in need of further research. In response, 
the Parkinson Disease Foundation and ProjectSpark assembled an international team of experts to 
create recommendations for clinical research to advance this field. The working group identified 
several areas where shared standards would improve research quality and foster progress including 
terminology, diagnostic criteria, and measurement. Terminology needs to (1) clearly distinguish 
fatigue from related phenomena (e.g. sleepiness, apathy, depression); (2) differentiate subjective 
fatigue complaints from objective performance fatigability; and (3) specify domains affected by 
fatigue and causal factors. We propose diagnostic criteria for PD-related fatigue to guide 
participant selection for clinical trials and add rigor to mechanistic studies. Recommendations are 
made for measurement of subjective fatigue complaints, performance fatigability, and 
neurophysiologic changes. We also suggest areas where future research is needed to address 
methodological issues and validate or optimize current practices. Many limitations in current PD-
related fatigue research may be addressed by improving methodological standards, many of which

cancer, multiple sclerosis).
Keywords
Parkinson's disease; fatigue; case definition; clinical research
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 
about 1% of the population over the age of 50.1 Traditionally, research focus has been on the 
motor aspects of the disease, such as tremor, rigidity and akinesia. During the last 2 decades, 
however, attention has shifted to the many non-motor symptoms common in PD, including 
fatigue. Several studies have shown that fatigue is a major problem for approximately half of 
PD patients. It tends to develop early, including in the pre-motor period, and is reported by 
one-third of patients as the single most disabling symptom.2, 3 Fatigue is a leading cause of 
disability claims related to PD and, even in retired individuals, limits the ability to maintain 
hobbies and participate in social activities.4
Despite the enormous impact of fatigue in PD, its pathophysiology remains unknown. 
Studies generally do not find significant associations between disease duration, stage or 
motor symptoms and fatigue suggesting the involvement of nonmotor networks.2 Fatigue is 
often associated with depression,2 but these symptoms frequently occur independently and 
fatigue may persist following successful treatment of depression.5 Fatigue in PD is also 
inconsistently associated with sleep disorders and is dissociable from daytime 
somnolence.6-8 Proposed physiologic mechanisms include increased circulating pro-
inflammatory cytokines, dysfunction in nigrostriatal and extrastriatal dopaminergic 
pathways, involvement of non-dopaminergic (particularly serotonergic) pathways, executive/
prefrontal pathology and involvement of the autonomic nerve system.9-13 While intriguing, 
studies to date are generally limited by small sample sizes, failure to control for potential 
confounding factors and explain only a small portion of the variance in fatigue. Treatment 
options for fatigue in PD are similarly limited. There are very few published reports on the 
treatment of fatigue in PD and a recent systematic review concluded that insufficient 
evidence exists to support the management of fatigue in PD with any pharmacologic or 
nonpharmacologic treatments.14
Thus, there is a clear need for further basic and clinical research on PD-related fatigue. 
Importantly, PD patients attending the 2013 World Parkinson Congress voted fatigue as the 
leading symptom in need of further research. In response, the Parkinson Disease Foundation 
and ProjectSpark assembled an international team of experts to create recommendations for 
clinical research to forward this field. The working group identified several high-priority 
areas where shared standards would improve research quality and foster progress including 
terminology, case definition, and measurement. The goal of this paper is to make 
recommendations regarding terminology, measurement and a working case definition of PD-
related fatigue based on discussions from this working group.

 Working Group Strategy
Prior to meeting, the working group identified topics critical to advancing clinical research 
in PD-related fatigue. At the working group meeting summaries of the available literature 
from PD-related fatigue were presented and gaps identified. The group also reviewed 
research from other medical conditions where methodology or findings may be more 
advanced including cancer-related fatigue, multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. 
In the absence of evidence, we relied on expert opinion based on the clinical and research 
experiences of the group and specifically highlight these areas as in need of additional 
research.
Terminology
Although fatigue is often viewed as a “non-specific symptom” we believe that a more 
scientifically productive viewpoint is to treat fatigue as a complex construct requiring 
precision in terms of phenomenology and terminology. The lead author and his colleagues 
previously published recommendations for a unifying taxonomy for clinical research in 
fatigue in neurological populations which was designed specifically with PD-related fatigue 
in mind.15 The goal of this taxonomy is to facilitate scientific progress by providing shared 
terminology and accurate descriptions of phenomenology. The key aspects of this taxonomy 
are: 1) Distinguishing fatigue from related constructs (e.g. sleepiness); 2) Recognizing that 
subjective fatigue complaints and objective fatigability of performance are dissociable 
phenomena; 3) Utilizing strict criteria to define clinical significance; 4) Specifying what 
performance domains are affected by fatigue (e.g. motor, cognitive); and 5) Identifying 
causal factors by function and neuroanatomic location. We will briefly review these points as 
they relate to clinical research in PD-related fatigue.
One of the challenges of studying fatigue in PD is the high prevalence of potentially 
confounding symptoms including daytime somnolence, apathy, and depression. While these 
symptoms are frequently comorbid with fatigue they are distinct phenomena and are 
dissociable. On a phenomenological level, fatigue is described by PD patients as a lack of 
energy or a need for increased effort needed to attempt daily activities that is distinct from 
sleepiness (they do not feel a need to take a nap), lack of motivation (they want to do 
activities but do not have energy) and depression (they report fatigue may lead to frustration 
but that their mood is not driving fatigue). Epidemiologic studies support this distinction in 
that many PD patients with fatigue do not have depression, apathy or daytime sleepiness and 
regression models suggest that patients with comorbid symptoms (e.g. depression and 
fatigue) may differ from patients with isolated fatigue.2, 16 As these symptoms likely have 
different biological underpinnings and different responses to treatment it is critical that 
clinical studies deal with potential confounds through participant selection criteria (e.g. 
exclusion of patients meeting DSM criteria for active major depression or proposed criteria 
for apathy17) and/or collecting data on confounding symptom severity to allow for more 
complex modeling (e.g. using validated depression18, sleep quality,19 or sleepiness20 scales 
as covariate in regression models).

 Fatigue and fatigability are normal physiologic reactions to prolonged or intense activity. In 
healthy individuals fatigue is predictable, transient, responds to rest and does not interfere 
with daily activities. Fatigue may be clinically significant if it is chronic, unpredictable, 
poorly responsive to rest, out of proportion to activities performed, present at rest or 
interfering with daily activity. Currently there is no consensus for how to define clinically 
significant fatigue in PD. The majority of studies that make this distinction do so by 
choosing a cut-point on a fatigue scale. Below we propose diagnostic criteria inspired by 
DSM-style criteria currently in use for defining cancer-related fatigue and chronic fatigue 
syndrome.21, 22 A related issue is the potential for fatigue in PD to be secondary to other 
causes (e.g. low testosterone, anemia, comorbid medical illness, medications) as opposed to 
PD pathology. Clinical researchers may address this issue through selection criteria (e.g. 
exclusion of patients with heart failure), screening for common causes of fatigue (e.g. 
hypothyroidism, anemia) and a careful history to determine if fatigue onset was associated 
with any specific medical or non-medical events (e.g. starting a beta-blocker medication). Of 
note, while sleepiness is associated with the use of dopamine agonists, there is no evidence 
that dopaminergic medications increase fatigue. In fact, there is preliminary data to suggest 
that PD medications and deep brain stimulation may actually improve fatigue in some 
patients.23-25
A fundamental distinction in this taxonomy is between perceptions of fatigue, often 
described as an increased sense of effort or decreased energy; and performance fatigability, 
an objective decrement in performance induced by continued activity. These symptoms are 
clearly dissociable in PD. Although PD patients demonstrate more rapid fatigability on both 
motor and cognitive tasks, this fatigability does not correlate with subjective fatigue 
complaints.26-28 Other studies have notably shown an increased sense of effort for PD 
patients performing motor tasks compared with healthy controls even when performance is 
similar, suggesting that fatigue complaints may be driven more by altered perception than 
performance limitations.29 Further work associating objective measures with subjective 
complaints is needed to better understand the phenomenology of PD-related fatigue.
Mechanistic studies must be careful in attributing a causal relationship between physiologic 
markers and fatigue. Even in studies monitoring performance fatigability over time 
physiologic changes may reflect: 1) Functional deterioration of systems associated with 
performance30; 2) Engagement of systems associated with perceptions or monitoring of 
effort and fatigue31, 32; 3) Learning or other time-dependent processes not associated with 
fatigue33; or 4) Engagement of compensatory processes to maintain performance.34-39 
Terminology should thus clearly identify the neuroanatomic location and function of 
physiological factors as well as the domains of function affected. While the term “central 
fatigue” has been used to indicate central nervous system causes of fatigue it may also be 
used to refer to subjective fatigue and cognitive fatigability and should thus be used with 
caution.15
Proposed Diagnostic Criteria
There may be advantages to addressing PD-related fatigue as a distinct syndrome including: 
1) Reducing participant heterogeneity in clinical and mechanistic studies; and 2) Providing a

 diagnostic category to facilitate fatigue-related patient disability claims and medication 
coverage.40 Potential downsides would include making the diagnosis of fatigue in PD more 
complex and limiting enrollment in clinical trials. As a motivating example, depression can 
also be viewed as either a symptom or syndrome but the majority of scientific advances in 
neurobiology, genetics and treatment have resulted from studies of syndromes such as major 
depressive disorder.41 In the field of clinical fatigue research, chronic fatigue syndrome 
(CFS) and cancer-related fatigue have moved towards syndromic diagnostic criteria with 
noted benefits regarding quality of clinical research and patient advocacy.21, 22
In advocating for diagnostic criteria to define PD-related fatigue we propose that there are 
distinctive neurobiological features which drive fatigue in this population and may be 
utilized in the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This assumption is 
supported by the observation that PD patients characterize their fatigue associated with PD 
as qualitatively different than normal physiological fatigue.42 Table 1 outlines our proposed 
working case definition of PD-related fatigue. This definition was based on published 
studies of fatigue in PD, our collective clinical experience, and review of the case definitions 
for cancer-related fatigue and CFS.21, 22, 43 Our major goals in creating this definition were 
to: 1) Differentiate persons with clinically significant fatigue from those experiencing 
normal physiological fatigue; and 2) To exclude patients with fatigue from causes other than 
PD. As this case definition is based on indirect evidence and expert opinion, further studies 
will be needed to directly validate these criteria including qualitative, psychometric and 
neurobiological studies. The utility of this case definition should also be evaluated through 
clinical trials applying these criteria for trial inclusion.
Measurement
In line with the fatigue taxonomy described above, we cannot recommend a single global 
fatigue measure. Rather, there is a need to choose relevant fatigue measures based on what 
aspects of fatigue are being studied which in turn depend on the research questions of a 
particular study. Fatigue measures may be categorized into three general domains: 1) 
Measures of perceptions of fatigue and subjective fatigue complaints; 2) Measures of 
performance fatigability; and 3) Physiologic factors associated with fatigue or fatigability.
Measures of Perceptions of Fatigue
In 2010 a Movement Disorders Society (MDS) Task Force published a review of subjective 
fatigue rating scales as well as recommendations for use.44 Here we will briefly summarize 
the most commonly used and highly recommended fatigue rating scales in PD. Some 
authors have suggested that measures of overall activity should be considered in interpreting 
fatigue complaints due to the possibility that some persons may avoid/restrict activities to 
minimize fatigue complaints.45 In addition to the measures of subjective fatigue complaints 
(trait), physiological studies may also consider single item visual analogue scales to measure 
momentary (state) perceptions of fatigue.46
The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)47 is a unidimensional, 9-item fatigue inventory that asks 
patients to rate statements regarding the impact of fatigue on various domains of function on 
Kluger et al.

 a 7-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). It is the most commonly used fatigue 
scale across all conditions and the only scale to receive “recommended” ratings from the 
MDS Task Force for both screening and severity ratings. The Multidimensional Fatigue 
Inventory (MFI)48 is a 20-item scale that asks patients to rate statements regarding feelings 
of effort and capacity on a 7-point Likert scale (“Yes, that is true” to “No, that is not true). 
An advantage of the MFI is that it provides validated subscores for five dimensions of 
fatigue (general, physical, mental, reduced activity and reduced motivation).49 The MFI 
received a “suggested” rating for screening and “recommended” rating for severity. The 
Parkinson Fatigue Scale (PFS)42 is a 16-item scale that asks patients to rate statements 
regarding both the subjective experience and impact of fatigue on a 5-point scale (strongly 
disagree to strongly agree). The PFS originated from statements by PD patients who 
experienced fatigue and received a “recommended” rating for screening and “suggested” 
rating for severity. The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)50 is a 21-item scale that rates 
the impact of fatigue on function using a 5-point scale (never to always) and provides a total 
score in addition to physical, cognitive and psychosocial subscores. While not included in 
the MDS Task Force paper it has been subsequently validated in PD and is recommended for 
use by the Multiple Sclerosis Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines.51 Based on 
performance in clinical trials, the MFIS may also be more responsive to change than some 
other available scales.52
Measures of Performance Fatigability
Objective performance fatigability is typically measured by either a) assessing performance 
at baseline on a task and measuring change in one or more aspects of performance during 
continued performance of that task; or b) assessing performance on a probe task at rest and 
the reassessing performance on these probe tasks after completion of a distinct fatiguing 
task. In the motor domain, fatigability is commonly assessed using motor tasks such as 
finger tapping (looking at rate) or force generation.27 Two force generation protocols are 
commonly used to assess physical fatigability: intermittent submaximal force exercise 
protocol and the continuous maximum force exercise protocol.53 While PD patients 
demonstrate accelerated fatigability on both types of motor tasks and report increased effort, 
no correlations have been found between these measures of fatigability and subjective 
complaints.27, 29
Fatigability may also be induced by cognitive tasks and assessed in the cognitive domain by 
examining changes in response time or accuracy. To date, a single study using a prolonged 
version of the Attention Network Task (ANT) found accelerated cognitive fatigue in PD 
patients versus controls but failed to find a correlation with subjective fatigue complaints.26 
Studies examining fatigability using different tasks or outcome measures may be worth 
pursuing as studies from other neurologic disorders suggest that not all cognitive domains 
are equally associated with fatigue.32 Studies in other populations also suggest that change 
in intraindividual variability of response times may be a more sensitive metric than mean 
response time or accuracy.31, 54

 Measuring Physiologic Factors
Studies of physiologic factors frequently examine subjective fatigue complaints but more 
detailed mechanistic studies also investigate physiologic changes associated with momentary 
perceptions of fatigue or the development of cognitive or motor fatigability.39, 46 
Physiological factors with potential associations with PD-related fatigue include changes in 
cortical excitability, reduced central motor drive, autonomic dysfunction, metabolic function, 
respiratory function and inflammation.9, 13, 27, 55-57
Although CNS factors are hypothesized to play a key role in PD-related fatigue, studies 
utilizing neuroimaging to understand PD-related fatigue are limited. The clinical relationship 
of dopaminergic loss to PD-related fatigue is unclear and most studies do not find a strong 
relationship between severity of motor symptoms and fatigue or dopaminergic therapies. 
However, in the ELLDOPA cohort of untreated early PD patients treatment with levodopa 
was associated with less progression of fatigue over 40 weeks and fatigue improvement was 
reported in one-third of de novo PD patients who subsequently started on dopamine 
replacement therapy in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort.2, 24, 58 
Despite this, [123I]-β-CIT imaging of striatal dopamine transporter uptake did not differ 
between high and low fatigue patients in the ELLDOPA cohort.58 Another study also 
showed no difference in 18F-dopa uptake between 10 fatigued PD subjects and 10 non-
fatigued PD subjects but revealed serotonin transporter binding in the caudate, putamen, 
ventral striatum and thalamus was decreased in fatigued compared to non-fatigued 
patients.11 The role of other neurotransmitter systems (e.g. norepinephrine, acetylcholine 
GABA, glutamate), morphologic changes in grey and white matter, and regional brain 
activity and functional connectivity have yet to be explored in PD-related fatigue but are 
associated with fatigue in other neurologic disorders and should be pursued.39, 59-61
Summary and Directions for Future Research
Table 2 provides a summary of recommendations relevant to the conduct and reporting of 
clinical research on PD-related fatigue. Future studies are needed to substantiate and 
optimize these recommendations, including: 1) Psychometric and qualitative studies for the 
proposed working case definition of PD-related fatigue: 2) Phenomenological and 
epidemiological studies to better understand the underlying construct of PD-related fatigue, 
including possible fatigue subtypes16; 3) Physiologic studies to elicit mechanisms, identify 
therapeutic targets and provide neurobiological validation of PD-related fatigue diagnosis; 
and 4) Clinical trials to validate the therapeutic utility and clinical meaningfulness of 
outcome measures and diagnostic classifications.

Table 1
Proposed Criteria for diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease-related fatigue
Patients must report significantly diminished energy levels, or increased perceptions of effort which are disproportionate to attempted activities 
or general activity level. Symptoms must be present for most of the day, every day or nearly every day during the previous month. In addition, 
patients must have four or more of the symptoms from section A as well as meet criteria in sections B, C, and D.
A. Symptoms
1
Symptoms may be induced by routine activities of daily living.
2
Symptoms may occur with little or no exertion.
3
Symptoms limit the type, intensity or duration of activities performed by the patient.
4
Symptoms are not reliably relieved by rest or may require prolonged periods of rest.
5
Symptoms may be brought on by cognitive tasks or situations requiring sustained attention including social interactions.
6
Patients avoid rigorous activities due to fear of experiencing worsening of symptoms.
7
Mild to moderate exertion may induce a worsening of symptoms lasting hours to days.
8
Symptoms have a predictable diurnal pattern regardless of activities performed (e.g. worsening in the afternoon).
9
Symptoms are unpredictable and may have a sudden onset.
B. The patient experiences clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of function as a result of 
fatigue.
C. There is evidence from the history and physical examination suggesting fatigue is a consequence of PD.
D. The symptoms are not primarily a consequence of comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression), sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep 
apnea) or medical conditions (e.g. anemia, congestive heart failure).

Table 2
Summary of Recommendations for Terminology and Measurement for Clinical Research 
on PD-related Fatigue
1
Studies should define fatigue related terminology or refer to prior publications regarding taxonomy/definitions.
2
Fatigue should be distinguished from related symptoms (e.g. depression, sleepiness, apathy). Depending on the goals of the study 
this may be addressed through exclusion criteria or inclusion of measures of related symptoms for covariates in analyses.
3
Studies should address potential secondary causes of fatigue including other medical conditions (e.g. heart failure), psychiatric 
conditions (e.g. major depressive disorder), and medications (e.g. beta blockers) through subject selection criteria or covariates.
4
Studies should specify how clinically significant fatigue is defined using a case definition or a cut-point on a fatigue scale or other 
fatigue measure.
5
Studies should choose specific fatigue outcome measures based on their research question(s).
6
Studies of physiologic factors associated with fatigue should specify what aspects of fatigue they are associated with and how these 
factors may relate to fatigue (e.g. contributory, compensatory) if known.
