Multimorbidity and Socioeconomic Deprivation  
in Primary Care Consultations
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE The influence of multimorbidity on the clinical encounter is poorly 
understood, especially in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation where bur-
densome multimorbidity is concentrated. The aim of the current study was to 
examine the effect of multimorbidity on general practice consultations, in areas 
of high and low deprivation.
METHODS We conducted secondary analyses of 659 video-recorded routine 
consultations involving 25 general practitioners (GPs) in deprived areas and 22 in 
affluent areas of Scotland. Patients rated the GP’s empathy using the Consultation 
and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure immediately after the consultation. Vid-
eos were analyzed using the Measure of Patient-Centered Communication. Multi-
level, multi-regression analysis identified differences between the groups.
RESULTS In affluent areas, patients with multimorbidity received longer consulta-
tions than patients without multimorbidity (mean 12.8 minutes vs 9.3, respec-
tively; P 
= 
.015), but this was not so in deprived areas (mean 9.9 minutes vs 10.0 
respectively; P 
= 
.774). In affluent areas, patients with multimorbidity perceived 
their GP as more empathic (P 
= 
.009) than patients without multimorbidity; this 
difference was not found in deprived areas (P 
= 
.344). Video analysis showed 
that GPs in affluent areas were more attentive to the disease and illness experi-
ence in patients with multimorbidity (P < .031) compared with patients without 
multimorbidity. This was not the case in deprived areas (P 
= 
.727).
CONCLUSIONS In deprived areas, the greater need of patients with multimor-
bidity is not reflected in the longer consultation length, higher GP patient cen-
teredness, and higher perceived GP empathy found in affluent areas. Action is 
required to redress this mismatch of need and service provision for patients with 
multimorbidity if health inequalities are to be narrowed rather than widened by 
primary care.

INTRODUCTION
M
ultimorbidity—defined as the coexistence of 2 or more long-term 
conditions within an individual—is now the norm rather than the 
exception in high-income countries.1 Although related to aging, 
multimorbidity is also socially patterned, being more common and occur-
ring at a younger age in those of lower socioeconomic status.1,2 People with 
multimorbidity living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation struggle 
to cope with everyday life tasks,3 and have lower quality of life compared 
with more affluent patients with multimorbidity.4 The effect of multimor-
bidity on unplanned hospital admissions is also exacerbated by deprivation, 
including ambulatory care–sensitive conditions which could in principle be 
managed in the community if primary care was working more effectively.5
The clinical encounter lies at the heart of primary care, yet there has 
been surprisingly little research on how multimorbidity influences the 
consultation,6 and how or whether patients with multimorbidity needs 
are met within routine clinical encounters in affluent and deprived areas.7 
Qualitative research shows that GPs working in deprived areas find it

hard to manage patients with multimorbidity.8 This 
is exacerbated by the inverse care law (which states 
that “the availability of good medical care tends to 
vary inversely with the need for it in the population 
served”) which continues to blight health care, even 
in countries such as the United Kingdom with its uni-
versal coverage and national health service (NHS) free 
at the point of care.9-11 Reflecting the inverse care law, 
patients living in areas of high deprivation have poorer 
access to primary care, shorter consultation length, 
less enablement, and doctors who are more stressed 
compared with those working in more affluent areas.12 
Empathic, patient-centered care is a prerequisite for 
patient enablement and improves health outcomes in 
both affluent and deprived areas.13-15
In the present study, we examined the influence of 
multimorbidity on general practice consultations, in 
areas of high and low socioeconomic deprivation. We 
hypothesized that in affluent areas, where workforce 
pressures are less severe,11 the greater needs and com-
plexity of patients with multimorbidity would result 
in longer consultations, and more empathic, patient-
centered care than in less complex patients without 
multimorbidity, but that in deprived areas, due to the 
ongoing inverse care law,11 these effects of multimor-
bidity on the consultation would not be possible.
METHODS
Study Design
This study was a secondary cross-sectional analysis of 
a previous study of 659 consultations in primary care 
settings in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.15 The 
study comprised patient-administered questionnaires 
and videotaping of consultations. The study protocol 
and recruitment procedures have been previously 
reported.15 Ethical approval of the study was obtained 
from the local research ethics committee (approval 
number: REC/06/SO701/43) and informed consent was 
obtained from all participating GPs and patients.
Recruitment of Practices and Patients
The details of the original study protocol and recruit-
ment procedures are already reported in full.15 In 
brief, 20 practices, 47 GPs, and 659 patients (339 with 
multimorbidity) participated (13 practices, 25 GPs, 
356 patients in high-deprivation areas including 207 
patients with multimorbidity; 7 practices, 22 GPs, 303 
patients in low-deprivation areas with 132 patients 
with multimorbidity). Practices were recruited from 
the upper and lower quartile of deprivation (Scottish 
Index of Multiple Deprivation, SIMD 2006)16 in the 
Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, Scot-
land, United Kingdom. The mean deprivation scores 
of the participating practices and patients were com-
parable to those of all practices in the high- and low-
deprivation areas. Consecutive, unselected patients 
(aged >17 years) from the participating practices 
received an information sheet from reception staff 
when they checked in, and a researcher then gained 
informed consent.
Patient Questionnaire at Consultation 
and Follow Up
Before the consultation, patients completed a question-
naire that included questions on their demographics, 
number of problems they wished to discuss, and the 
extent to which their daily activities were limited by 
their conditions.15 Immediately after consultation, 
patients reported their perceptions of the GP’s empa-
thy using the Consultation and Relational Empathy 
(CARE)17 measure.
Consultation Video Rating
Consultation videos were coded for GP behaviors 
with the Measure of Patient-Centered Communication 
(MPCC), as reported previously.15 The MPCC consists 
of 3 components: exploring both the disease and illness 
experience, understanding of the whole person, and 
finding common ground.18
Statistical Analysis
We carried out descriptive unadjusted analysis of the 
patients’ demographic details, health status, and health 
care needs, comparing patients with multimorbidity 
with patients without multimorbidity, in both affluent 
and deprived settings. Differences between patients 
with multimorbidity and patients without multimor-
bidity in both groups were analyzed by the appropri-
ate parametric and nonparametric tests (unpaired t-test 
and Mann-Whitney tests) depending on the distribu-
tion of the variables and data type (continuous or non-
continuous data).
We then compared the key consultation charac-
teristics of interest (consultation length, GP empathy, 
patient-centered care) in patients with multimorbidity 
vs patients without multimorbidity, consulting GPs in 
high or low deprivation areas. In this analysis, we con-
trolled for patients’ age, sex, and clustering effects of 
patients within individual GPs, using multilevel regres-
sion models (SAS version 9.2, SAS Institute) adjusting 
for GP as a random effect with fixed effects for patient 
age and sex. Our rationale was that age and sex could 
both feasibly influence consultation characteristics 
independent of multimorbidity, and the nature of our 
data was that patients were clustered within GPs and 
GPs within practices.15 In our previous analysis of the 
same data set, we found evidence of clustering effects

at the GP level (patients within GPs) but not at prac-
tice level (GPs within practices).15 Thus in the current 
analysis we adjusted for the former but not the latter.
RESULTS
The age, sex, and ethnicity of the participating GPs 
did not differ between the high- and low-deprivation 
areas; patient ethnicity also did not differ significantly 
between groups with over 95% speaking English as 
their first language (results not shown). As expected, 
more patients had multimorbidity (2 or more condi-
tions) in deprived areas (207/356; 58%) compared with 
affluent areas (132/303; 44%) (P <.001). The average 
number of conditions per patient with multimorbidity 
was 3.4 (SD = 1.64) in the deprived compared with 2.9 
(SD = 1.13) in the affluent area (P <.01). This differ-
ence was apparent across age-groups (Figure 1).
Patients with multimorbidity were older, had poorer 
health, were more disabled, consulted more often, and 
wanted to discuss more problems than patients without 
multimorbidity (Table 1). Illness burden (poor general 
health; disability) and demand (frequency of consult-
ing; number of problems to discuss) was significantly 
higher in the patients with multimorbidity in deprived 
areas than in the affluent areas (P <.01).
Characteristics of the Consultations
The effect of multimorbidity on the key consultation 
measures is shown in Table 2. Consultation length was 
37% longer (an average of 3 minutes) in patients with 
multimorbidity compared with those without multi-
morbidity in the affluent areas, whereas consultation 
length did not differ in the deprived areas between 
patients with or without multimorbidity. Patients’ per-
ception of the GPs’ empathy was 
significantly higher in the affluent 
patients with multimorbidity com-
pared with the deprived patients 
with multimorbidity (P <.01) and 
significantly higher in the affluent 
patients with multimorbidity vs 
the affluent patients without mul-
timorbidity (P <.01). In the afflu-
ent areas, video analysis showed 
that the GPs were significantly 
more interested in exploring the 
disease and illness experience 
of patients with multimorbidity, 
compared with patients without 
multimorbidity (component 1 of 
the MPCC; P <.05). This was not 
apparent in the deprived area. 
The other 2 components of the 
MPCC (understanding the whole person and finding 
common ground) and hence overall rating did not dif-
fer significantly between the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION
Summary of Findings
We hypothesized that the greater complexity and 
clinical needs of patients with multimorbidity would 
result in longer consultations and more empathic, 
patient-centered care (compared with patients without 
multimorbidity) in affluent areas, but that these effects

would not be apparent in deprived areas (due to the 
inverse care law). Our findings are entirely consistent 
with this hypothesis. Despite the fact that multimor-
bidity was more common and more burdensome in 
deprived areas, consultations did not differ significantly 
from those of patients without multimorbidity.
Comparison With Published Literature
The higher prevalence and severity of multimorbid-
ity in patients consulting GPs in deprived areas found 
in the present study is in line with our understand-
ing of multimorbidity in Scotland from our previous 
large scale epidemiological research.2 The fact that 
multimorbidity is more common in those of lower 
socioeconomic status has been widely reported now 
in many other countries.1 In terms of the benefits of 
longer consultation length, systematic reviews are 
equivocal but suggest beneficial effects in patients with 
psychosocial problems.19,20 We have previously found 
that even modest increases in consultation length 
improves enablement in patients with complex needs 
in deprived areas,21 and our randomized controlled 
trial of a primary care–based complex intervention 
(CARE Plus) for patients with multimorbidity living in 
deprived areas based on longer consultations showed 
evidence of improvements in quality of life and cost-
effectiveness over a 12-month period.22
The higher empathy and patient centeredness 
regarding disease and illness experience in the affluent 
multimorbid group is also an important finding, since 
GP empathy and patient-centered approaches have 
previously been shown to improve patient enablement 
and health outcomes.13-15 GP empathy and patient 
centeredness are generally lower in deprived areas 
compared with affluent,15,23 and a systematic review has 
recently indicated that this is true generally of doctors 
dealing with patients of low educational status.24
Policy Implications
The findings of the current study need to be under-
stood in the context of the “inverse care law” which 
has existed in the UK NHS for over 40 years.9-12 
Despite the higher levels of unmet need in deprived 
areas, the distribution of funding and of GPs in Scot-
land is flat across deprivation deciles11 resulting in high 
GP stress, shorter consultations, and worse consulta-
tion outcomes in deprived areas.12,15 Tackling this ineq-
uity remains essential if health inequalities are to be 
narrowed rather than widened through the availability 
of effective health care. In Scotland, ambitious policy 
changes are afoot regarding integrated primary care 
and a new GP contract25; it will be important that such 
changes embrace the inverse care law, which research 
has suggested can be changed cost effectively with 
benefit to patients with multimorbidity.22
Strengths and Limitations
A strength of this study was the large sample size of 
video-taped routine consultations with a comprehen-
sive analysis of observed GP communication, plus

sis in which we adjusted for cluster effects from GP 
level cluster, and patient age and sex also add to the 
robustness of the findings. The study was a secondary 
data analysis, however, and the sample size was thus 
not powered on the basis of the present analysis, but 
on the aims of our original work.15
