BACKGROUND
The Amish and Hutterites are U.S. agricultural populations whose lifestyles are remark-
ably similar in many respects but whose farming practices, in particular, are distinct; 
the former follow traditional farming practices whereas the latter use industrialized 
farming practices. The populations also show striking disparities in the prevalence of 
asthma, and little is known about the immune responses underlying these disparities.
METHODS
We studied environmental exposures, genetic ancestry, and immune profiles among 60 
Amish and Hutterite children, measuring levels of allergens and endotoxins and assess-
ing the microbiome composition of indoor dust samples. Whole blood was collected to 
measure serum IgE levels, cytokine responses, and gene expression, and peripheral-
blood leukocytes were phenotyped with flow cytometry. The effects of dust extracts 
obtained from Amish and Hutterite homes on immune and airway responses were 
assessed in a murine model of experimental allergic asthma.
RESULTS
Despite the similar genetic ancestries and lifestyles of Amish and Hutterite children, 
the prevalence of asthma and allergic sensitization was 4 and 6 times as low in the 
Amish, whereas median endotoxin levels in Amish house dust was 6.8 times as high. 
Differences in microbial composition were also observed in dust samples from Amish 
and Hutterite homes. Profound differences in the proportions, phenotypes, and func-
tions of innate immune cells were also found between the two groups of children. In 
a mouse model of experimental allergic asthma, the intranasal instillation of dust ex-
tracts from Amish but not Hutterite homes significantly inhibited airway hyperreactiv-
ity and eosinophilia. These protective effects were abrogated in mice that were deficient 
in MyD88 and Trif, molecules that are critical in innate immune signaling.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of our studies in humans and mice indicate that the Amish environment 
provides protection against asthma by engaging and shaping the innate immune re-
sponse. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)

M
any genetic risk factors have 
been reported to modify susceptibility 
to asthma and allergy,1,2 but the dra-
matic increase in the prevalence of these condi-
tions in westernized countries in the past half-
century suggests that the environment also plays 
a critical role.3 The importance of environmental 
exposures in the development of asthma is most 
exquisitely illustrated by epidemiologic studies 
conducted in Central Europe that show signifi-
cant protection from asthma and allergic disease 
in children raised on traditional dairy farms. In 
particular, children’s contact with farm animals 
and the associated high microbial exposures4,5 
have been related to the reduced risk.6,7 However, 
the effect of these traditional farming environ-
ments on immune responses is not well defined.
To address this gap in knowledge, we de-
signed a study that compares two distinctive 
U.S. farming populations — the Amish of Indi-
ana and the Hutterites of South Dakota — that 
recapitulate the differences in the prevalences of 
asthma and allergy observed in farmers and 
nonfarmers in Europe. These two particular 
groups of farmers originated in Europe — the 
Amish in Switzerland and the Hutterites in 
South Tyrol — during the Protestant Reformation 
and then emigrated to the United States in the 
1700s and 1800s, respectively. Both groups have 
since remained reproductively isolated.8,9 Their 
lifestyles are similar with respect to most of the 
factors known to influence the risk of asthma, 
including large sibship size, high rates of child-
hood vaccination, diets rich in fat, salt, and raw 
milk, low rates of childhood obesity, long dura-
tions of breast-feeding, minimal exposure to 
tobacco smoke and air pollution, and taboos 
against indoor pets. However, whereas the 
Amish practice traditional farming, live on single-
family dairy farms, and use horses for fieldwork 
and transportation, the Hutterites live on large, 
highly industrialized, communal farms. Strik-
ingly, the prevalence of asthma in Amish versus 
Hutterite schoolchildren is 5.2% versus 21.3% 
and the prevalence of allergic sensitization is 
7.2% versus 33.3%, as previously reported.10,11
Methods
Overview
We characterized the immune profiles of Amish 
and Hutterite schoolchildren. Furthermore, we 
used mouse models of asthma to study the effect 
of the environment on airway responses and to 
create a mechanistic framework for the interpre-
tation of our observations in humans.
Study Participants and Study Oversight
In November 2012, we studied 30 Amish children 
7 to 14 years of age who lived in Indiana, and in 
December 2012 we studied 30 Hutterite children 
who lived in South Dakota and were matched with 
the Amish children for sex and for age within 
1 year. (For information on the characteristics of 
the children see Table 1, and the Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Written 
informed consent was obtained from the parents 
and written assent was obtained from the chil-
dren. One parent of each child responded to a 
questionnaire on asthma symptoms and previous 
diagnoses. The study was approved by the insti-
tutional review boards at the University of Chi-
cago and at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis.
Blood-Sample Collection and Analysis
Whole blood was collected in tubes that con-
tained culture medium alone, medium plus 0.1 μg 
per milliliter of lipopolysaccharide, or medium 
plus 0.4 μg per milliliter of anti-CD3 plus 0.33 μg 
per milliliter of anti-CD28 monoclonal antibod-
ies (TruCulture Blood Collection System, Myriad 
RBM). After incubation at 37°C for 30 hours,

Immunity and Asthma in Amish and Hutterite Children
supernatant and cells were frozen for use in 
gene-expression and cytokine studies. Levels of 
26 cytokines were measured with the use of the 
Milliplex Map Human TH17 Magnetic Bead 
Panel (EMD Millipore) or enzyme-linked immuno-
absorbent assay (eBioscience) in the supernatant, 
in accordance with standard protocols. Addi-
tional blood was collected to obtain peripheral-
blood leukocytes for flow cytometry and DNA 
isolation, and serum was collected for IgE stud-
ies (as described in the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Cryopreserved human peripheral-blood leuko-
cytes were incubated for 10 minutes with pooled 
human IgG antibodies (FcX, Biolegend) to block 
nonspecific antibody binding before undergoing 
surface staining with fluorescently conjugated 
antibodies (see Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix) and intracellular staining for FoxP3 
(eBioscience). Flow-cytometry data were acquired 
on an LSRFortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences), 
and acquisition data were analyzed with FlowJo 
software (Tree Star).
Dust Collection and Extract Preparation
Electrostatic dust collectors were placed in one 
bedroom and the living room in each of 10 
Amish and 10 Hutterite homes to collect air-
borne house dust. All 10 Amish homes and 9 of 
10 Hutterite homes housed children who partici-
pated in the study. After 1 month, dust was ana-
lyzed for endotoxin and allergen levels, and ex-
tracts were prepared for studies in mice. In 
addition, a vacuum was used to collect dust from 
the living-room floor in Amish homes and from 
mattresses in Amish and Hutterite homes for 
use in microbiome studies (as described in the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Aqueous extracts of house dust from Amish and 
Hutterite homes were prepared as described in the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Genetic Studies
RNA was extracted from thawed cells with the 
use of AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen). 
RNA underwent complementary DNA synthesis 
and was then hybridized to HumanHT-12 v4 
Expression BeadChip arrays (Illumina). A com-
mon set of 118,789 single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) was genotyped or imputed in the 
60 children in the study (see Fig. S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Mouse Models
We instilled 50 μl of house-dust extract intra-
nasally every 2 to 3 days (for a total of 14 times) 
into 7-week old BALB/c mice (Harlan Laborato-
ries), beginning on day 0. The mice had been 
sensitized intraperitoneally with 20 μg of oval-
bumin (grade V, Sigma) plus alum (Pierce) on 
days 0 and 14 and were challenged intranasally 
with 50 μg of ovalbumin on days 28 and 38. 
Beginning 5 days before day 0, we also instilled 
50 μl of dust extract from Amish homes intra-
nasally every 2 to 3 days (for a total of 14 times) 
in 7-week old, C57BL6 wild-type, MyD88-deficient 
mice12 and in mice deficient in both MyD88 and 
Trif13 (Jackson Laboratories). These mice were 
sensitized intraperitoneally with 20 μg of oval-
bumin plus alum on days 0 and 14 and chal-
lenged intranasally with 75 μg of ovalbumin on 
days 26, 27, and 28.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the use 
of R or Prism software (GraphPad). Differences 
in the distributions of median cytokine levels 
between Amish and Hutterite children were de-
termined with use of a Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test. We used linear regression to identify differ-
entially expressed genes in the Amish and Hut-
terite untreated samples of peripheral-blood 
leukocytes. The methods of Benjamini and Hoch-
berg14 were used to control the false discovery 
rate. For flow cytometric studies and the study 
in mice, differences in cell populations and air-
way resistance were assessed with the use of an 
unpaired Student’s t-test. Additional details on 
sample processing, quality control, and statisti-
cal analysis for all methods described here are 
provided in the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Results
Asthma and Allergic-Sensitization Rates  
and Genetic Ancestry
None of the Amish children and six (20%) of the 
Hutterite children had asthma, rates similar to 
those reported in earlier studies.10,11 Levels of 
total serum IgE and the number of children 
whose levels of IgE against common allergens 
were high (defined as more than 3.5 kUA [allergen-
specific unit] per liter) were lower in the Amish 
group than in the Hutterite group (Table 1, and

Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). No 
statistical differences were observed in levels of 
serum Ig isotypes other than IgE (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
To evaluate whether the differences in the 
prevalence of asthma and of allergic sensitiza-
tion and differences in IgE level could be attrib-
uted to population history, we assessed ancestry 
by conducting principal component analysis and 
compared allele frequencies using genomewide 
SNPs. These studies revealed remarkable genetic 
similarities between the Amish children and the 
Hutterite children, as compared with other Euro-
pean populations15 (Fig. 1A, and Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Exposures to Allergens, Microbes,  
and Microbial Products
Common allergens (from cats, dogs, house-dust 
mites, and cockroaches) were detectable in air-
borne dust from 4 of 10 Amish and 1 of 10 Hut-
terite homes (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In contrast, endotoxin levels were 
measurable in airborne dust from all 20 homes, 
and median levels were strikingly higher (6.8 times 
as high) in Amish homes than in Hutterite homes 
(4399 endotoxin units [EU] per square meter vs. 
648 EU per square meter, P 
<0.001) (Fig. 1B). 
Analysis of a single pooled sample of mattress 
dust from each population revealed different 
profiles of the relative abundance of bacteria at 
the family level (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Composition and Phenotype of Peripheral-
Blood Leukocytes
Peripheral-blood leukocytes from Amish children 
had increased proportions of neutrophils, de-
creased proportions of eosinophils, and similar 
proportions of monocytes as compared with 
samples from Hutterite children (Fig. 2A). Neu-
trophils from Amish children expressed lower 
levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and the 
adhesion molecules CD11b and CD11c than did 
neutrophils from Hutterite children, suggesting 
that these cells may have recently emigrated from 
the bone marrow (Fig. 2B). Although propor-
tions of monocytes were similar in Amish and 
Hutterite children, monocytes from Amish chil-
dren, unlike those from Hutterite children, ex-
hibited a suppressive phenotype characterized 
by lower levels of human leukocyte antigen DR 
(HLA-DR) and higher levels of the inhibitory 
molecule immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 
(ILT3)16,17 (Fig. 2C). In contrast with previous 
studies,18,19 no significant differences in percent-

Immunity and Asthma in Amish and Hutterite Children
Figure 2. Proportions of Peripheral-Blood Leukocytes and Cell-Surface–Marker Phenotypes in Amish and Hutterite Children.
The percentages of total peripheral-blood leukocytes (Panel A) were determined with flow cytometry for neutrophils (defined as 
CD66b+Siglec-8+), eosinophils (defined as CCR3+Siglec-8+), and monocytes (defined as CD14+CD66b−). Box-and-whisker plots show a 
line indicating median value, with the box showing the interquartile range and whiskers showing the 95% confidence interval. Neutro-
phils (Panel B) were characterized according to the surface expression of CXCR4, CD11b, and CD11c (shown here), along with CXCR1 
and CXCR2, expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The expression of the interleukin-8 coreceptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 was not 
significantly different between groups (P = 0.26 and P = 0.91, respectively). Monocytes (Panel C) were characterized for the surface ex-
pression of HLA-DR and immunoglobulin-like transcripts (ILTs), including ILT3 (shown here). There was no significant difference in the 
MFI of inhibitory receptors ILT2 and ILT4 between Amish and Hutterite children (P = 0.69 and P = 0.21, respectively; data not shown), 
whereas the surface expression of ILT5 was increased on Amish monocytes (P = 0.001; data not shown). All P values were calculated with 
the use of an unpaired Student’s t-test. Cell proportions and phenotypes after the exclusion of children with asthma or allergic sensitiza-
tion are shown in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
ages of T regulatory cells (defined as CD3+, 
CD4+, FoxP3+, and CD127−) was observed in 
Amish and Hutterite children (0.056±0.054% vs. 
0.079±0.081% of peripheral-blood leukocytes, 
P 
= 
0.29).
Cytokine Responses to Innate and Adaptive 
Stimulation
Cytokine levels were measured in supernatants 
from peripheral-blood leukocytes that were cul-
tured for 30 hours, with or without innate 
stimuli (lipopolysaccharide) or adaptive stimuli 
(combined anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies). 
Twenty-three cytokines were detectable in the 
supernatants from peripheral-blood leukocytes 
treated with lipopolysaccharide. Median levels of 
each of these 23 cytokines were lower in the 
Amish children than in the Hutterite children, 
and these distributions were significantly differ-
ent (P 
<0.001 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (see 
Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Results were similar after the exclusion of 
children who were known to have asthma or 
allergies (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). In contrast, after adaptive stimulation, the 
overall distributions of median cytokine levels 
were not significantly different in peripheral-
blood leukocytes from Amish and Hutterite 
children (P 
= 
0.08 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test) 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Gene-Expression Profiles
The striking differences in the proportions of 
peripheral-blood leukocytes observed in Amish 
and Hutterite children were reflected in the gene-
expression profiles of these cells (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). At a false discovery 
rate of 1%, 1449 genes were up-regulated in the 
peripheral-blood leukocytes of Amish children 
(blue points in Fig. 3A) as compared with 1360 
genes up-regulated in the cells of Hutterite chil-
dren (red points in Fig. 3A). These differentially 
expressed genes were organized into 15 coexpres-
sion modules with the use of the Whole Genome 
Co-Expression Network Analysis (Table S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). To better understand 
the biologic relationships within each set of genes 
in each module, we used Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (Qiagen) to construct unsupervised net-
works on the basis of prior knowledge of the 
physical and functional connections between the 
molecules encoded by the genes. The most sig-
nificant network (P 
= 
1.0×10−30 by Fisher’s exact 
test) was in a module that contained 43 genes. 
This module was associated with both Amish and 
Hutterite status (P 
= 
7.1×10−9) and was therefore 
also associated with the proportions of neutro-
phils (P 
= 
1.5×10−6) and eosinophils (P 
= 
1.0×10−3). 
Eighteen of the genes in this module were over-
expressed in Amish peripheral-blood leukocytes, 
and all were clustered in a network that had as 
hubs tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon 
regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), two key proteins in the 
innate immune response to microbial stimuli 
(Fig. 3B).
Effects of House-Dust Extracts 
on Experimental Asthma
To create a framework that would help us to 
interpret our observations, which were pointing 
toward a protective role of innate immunity, we 
used a classic ovalbumin mouse model of aller-
gic asthma, comparing the effects of house dust 
obtained from Amish and Hutterite homes by 
administering extracts intranasally to mice over 
the course of 4 to 5 weeks. Eosinophilia was 
observed in bronchoalveolar-lavage samples, and 
airway hyperresponsiveness was exacerbated in 
mice treated with ovalbumin and Hutterite dust 
extracts as compared with mice treated with 
ovalbumin alone, findings that were consistent 
with the absence of protection from asthma 
observed in Hutterite children (Fig. 4A). In con-
trast, inhalation of Amish dust extracts was suf-
ficient to significantly inhibit ovalbumin-induced 
airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilia in the 
bronchoalveolar lavage, and the elevation of se-
rum ovalbumin-specific IgE levels (Fig. 4A, and 
Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). Levels 
of lung T regulatory cells (defined as CD3+, 
CD4+, and FoxP3+) were not increased (Table S11 
in the Supplementary Appendix), and all cyto-
kines measured in bronchoalveolar-lavage sam-
ples, including interleukin-10, were suppressed 
in mice that received Amish dust extracts (Table 
S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). The inhibi-
tory effects of these extracts in wild-type mice 
probably required innate immunity, because 
protection was strongly reduced in mice defi-
cient in MyD88 (Fig. 4C) and completely abro-
gated in mice deficient in both MyD88 and Trif 
(Fig. 4D), two molecules that are critical to the 
development of multiple innate immune-signal-
ing pathways.

Immunity and Asthma in Amish and Hutterite Children
 
Discussion
Our studies in Amish and Hutterite schoolchil-
dren revealed marked differences in the preva-
lence of asthma despite similar genetic ances-
tries and lifestyles. As compared with the 
Hutterites, the Amish, who practice traditional 
farming and are exposed to an environment rich 
in microbes, showed exceedingly low rates of 
asthma and distinct immune profiles that sug-
gest profound effects on innate immunity. Data 
generated in an experimental model of asthma 
support this notion by showing that the protec-
tive effect of the Amish environment requires 
the activation of innate immune signaling.
Analyses of the proportions and gene-expres-
sion profiles of peripheral-blood immune cells in 
Amish and Hutterite children revealed differences 
in the cells and genes involved in innate immune 
responses to microbes. Indeed, neutrophils, eosino-
phils, and monocytes appeared to be major tar-
gets of the distinct environments to which 
Amish and Hutterite children are exposed be-
cause these cell types differed between the two 
groups in terms of their relative abundance, their 
phenotypes, or both. Moreover, the network most 
associated with these differences consisted of 
innate immune genes. Notable among the genes 
that were more highly expressed in the Amish 
children was TNFAIP3, which encodes A20, a 
ubiquitin-editing enzyme that limits the activity 
of multiple inflammatory pathways that depend 
on nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)20 and that has also 
been shown to mediate the protective effects of 
European farm-dust extracts in murine models 
of allergic asthma.21 IRF7, a hub in this network, 
Figure 3. Gene-Expression Profiles in Peripheral-Blood Leukocytes from Amish and Hutterite Children.
In Panel A, a volcano plot shows differences in baseline gene expression in peripheral-blood leukocytes from Amish 
and Hutterite children.The x axis indicates the log2 differences in gene-expression level between groups, with larger 
positive values representing genes with higher expression in the Hutterites relative to the Amish (1360 genes, shown 
in red points) and larger negative values representing genes with higher expression in the Amish relative to the Hut-
terites (1449 genes, shown in blue points). The y axis shows the –log10 of the P values for each gene, with larger values 
indicating greater statistical significance. The solid horizontal line indicates the 1% false discovery rate. Black points 
represent genes from Amish and Hutterite cells for which there was no significant difference in gene expression. 
Differences in gene expression remain after the data for children with asthma or allergic sensitization were excluded 
(Figs. S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Changes in gene expression between the two groups after correct-
ing for differences in cell proportion are shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. In Panel B, a network 
of differentially expressed genes in untreated peripheral-blood leukocytes is shown. Genes shown in blue have in-
creased expression in Amish children, and the gene shown in red has increased expression in Hutterite children. 
The gene shapes indicate the class of each gene’s protein product (spirals denote enzymes, a v-shape denotes cyto-
kines, conjoined circles denote a transcription regulator, hollow upside-down triangles denote kinases, cups denote 
transporters, and circles denote other products). Lines represent different biologic relationships (solid lines indicate 
direct interaction, dashed lines indirect interaction, arrows direction of activation, arrows with a horizontal line direc-
tion of activation and inhibition, and lines without arrows binding only).

Figure 4. Effects of Amish and Hutterite House-Dust Extracts on Airway Responses in Mouse Models of Allergic Asthma.
Panel A shows the effects of the intranasal instillation of 50 μl of Amish or Hutterite dust extract in 7-week-old mice (BALB/c strain) every 2 to 3 days for a total of 14 times begin-
ning at day 0. The mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) intraperitoneally on days 0 and 14 and challenged with ovalbumin intranasally on days 28 and 38. Airway resistance 
(shown as centimeters of water per milliliter per second and stimulated in response to increasing doses of acetylcholine administered intravenously) and bronchoalveolar-lavage 
(BAL) cellularity were measured on day 39 (4 to 6 mice per group). The total amount of Amish and Hutterite dust extract administered over the course of the experiment represent-
ed the total load of airborne dust deposited on electrostatic dust collectors placed in Amish or Hutterite homes for 1 month. Statistical differences in experimental measures were 
assessed with the use of Student’s t-test. Amish house-dust extracts (7.5 mg of dust equivalent in 50 μl) were instilled intranasally every 2 to 3 days for a total of 14 times beginning 
5 days before day 0 into 7-week old wild-type mice (Panel B), mice deficient in MyD88 (Panel C), and mice deficient in MyD88 and Trif (Panel D) (all C57BL6 strains). These mice 
were sensitized intraperitoneally with 20 μg of ovalbumin on days 0 and 14 and were challenged intranasally with 75 μg of ovalbumin on days 26, 27, and 28. Airway resistance 
(shown as an increase from baseline in response to increasing doses of nebulized methacholine) and bronchoalveolar-lavage cellularity were measured on day 30 (12 mice per 
group for wild-type mice and 6 mice per group for those deficient in MyD88 or MyD88 and Trif). Statistical differences in experimental measures were assessed with the use of Stu-
dent’s t-test. I bars represent the standard errors of the data. NS denotes not significant and PBS phosphate-buffered saline.

Immunity and Asthma in Amish and Hutterite Children
regulates type I interferon transcription and is 
therefore essential for innate airway responses 
against viruses22 that are linked to susceptibility 
to asthma.23,24 In turn, TRIM8, the one gene in the 
network that was more highly expressed in the 
Hutterites, acts as a positive regulator of TNF-α– 
and interleukin-1β–induced activation of NF-κB.25 
These findings suggest that in the Amish, intense 
and presumably sustained exposure to microbes 
activates innate pathways that shape and cali-
brate downstream immune responses.
Sustained microbial exposure was also reflect-
ed in the phenotypes of peripheral innate im-
mune cells in the Amish. Repeated microbial 
stimulation can lead to reduced expression of 
HLA-DR on monocytes26,27 and drive immature 
neutrophils from the bone marrow.28-31 Indeed, 
Amish children had immature neutrophils bear-
ing markers suggestive of recent emigration 
from the bone marrow, and they had monocytes 
with reduced expression of HLA-DR and in-
creased expression of ILT3, all of which are sug-
gestive of antiinflammatory function. Proportions 
of T regulatory cells and levels of interleukin-10, 
which typically mediate immune-balancing effects, 
were not increased in the Amish children. How-
ever, qualitative and functional differences in 
regulatory-cell populations remain to be defined.
Innate immunity has evolved to sense the 
environment and transduce signals that cali-
brate adaptive responses to exogenous antigens. 
The proteins MyD88 and Trif are located at the 
convergence of multiple innate signaling path-
ways,32 and deletion of these molecules virtually 
disables innate immune responses, thereby also 
dysregulating adaptive immunity. The fact that 
the loss of protection was more marked in mice 
deficient in both MyD88 and Trif than in mice 
deficient only in MyD88 points to the involve-
ment of multiple innate pathways. The concor-
dance between findings from studies in humans 
and in mice was remarkable: in both studies 
protection was accompanied by lower levels of 
eosinophils, higher levels of neutrophils, general-
ly suppressed cytokine responses, and no increase 
in levels of T regulatory cells or interleukin-10. 
Thus, the finding that these features were largely 
dependent on innate immune pathways in mice 
suggests that innate immune signaling may also 
be the primary target of protection in the Amish 
children, in whom downstream adaptive immune 
responses may also be modulated.
Our study has several limitations. First, we were 
unable to include children younger than 6 years 
of age, we collected samples at a single time 
point, and the numbers of Amish and Hutterite 
children in our study were relatively small. As a 
result, we may have missed important windows 
of immune development or lacked the ability to 
detect early, subtle shifts in cell composition, 
response, or phenotype that are critical for im-
mune maturation. Second, our microbiome as-
sessments were limited, since only pooled dust 
samples from a limited number of homes were 
available for the studies in which we assessed 
bacterial composition. Therefore, we cannot fur-
ther dissect microbial composition and identify 
potentially protective microbes to target. How-
ever, the striking differences found in endotoxin 
levels support the notion that the Amish indoor 
environment is much richer in microbial expo-
sures than the Hutterite environment. Third, the 
strategy used for sampling the Hutterite chil-
dren enriched selection for those with asthma, 
although the prevalence of asthma in our sample 
was similar to that reported in previous popula-
tion-based studies.11 Moreover, the exclusion of 
children with asthma or allergic sensitization 
from our analyses of gene expression, cell com-
position, and immune phenotypes did not affect 
the outcomes.
Our study in a small number of children was 
sufficient to show significant differences in the 
prevalence of asthma and in immune profiles, 
suggesting that very strong environmental fac-
tors must account for these differences. Indeed, 
we showed that there are remarkable genetic 
similarities between Amish and Hutterite chil-
dren. Although we interrogated only common 
variants, other variants that occur at very low 
frequency in these populations are unlikely to 
account for the observed large differences in the 
prevalence of asthma. In the end, the novelty of 
our work lies in the identification of innate im-
munity as the primary target of the protective 
Amish environment, a finding supported by re-
sults obtained in both humans and mice. Con-
versely, our work suggests that susceptibility to 
asthma may be increased when innate immune 
stimulation is weak. A deeper understanding of 
the relevant stimuli and the innate immune path-
ways they engage may ultimately pave the way 
for the development of effective strategies for 
the prevention of asthma.
