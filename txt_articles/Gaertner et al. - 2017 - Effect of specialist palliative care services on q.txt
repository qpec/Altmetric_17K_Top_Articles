ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess the effect of specialist palliative care on 
quality of life and additional outcomes relevant to 
patients in those with advanced illness.
Design
Systematic review with meta-analysis.
Data sOurCes
Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, PsycINFO, and trial registers searched up to July 
2016.
eligibility Criteria fOr seleCting stuDies
Randomised controlled trials with adult inpatients or 
outpatients treated in hospital, hospice, or community 
settings with any advanced illness. Minimum 
requirements for specialist palliative care included the 
multiprofessional team approach. Two reviewers 
independently screened and extracted data, assessed 
the risk of bias (Cochrane risk of bias tool), and 
evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool).
Data synthesis
Primary outcome was quality of life with Hedges’ g as 
standardised mean difference (SMD) and random 
effects model in meta-analysis. In addition, the pooled 
SMDs of the analyses of quality of life were 
re-expressed on the global health/QoL scale (item 29 
and 30, respectively) of the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (0-100, 
high values=good quality of life, minimal clinically 
important difference 8.1).
results
Of 3967 publications, 12 were included (10 randomised 
controlled trials with 2454 patients randomised, of 
whom 72% (n=1766) had cancer). In no trial was 
integration of specialist palliative care triggered 
according to patients’ needs as identified by 
screening. Overall, there was a small effect in favour of 
specialist palliative care (SMD 0.16, 95% confidence 
interval 0.01 to 0.31; QLQ-C30 global health/QoL 4.1, 
0.3 to 8.2; n=1218, six trials). Sensitivity analysis 
showed an SMD of 0.57 (−0.02 to 1.15; global health/
QoL 14.6, −0.5 to 29.4; n=1385, seven trials). The effect 
was marginally larger for patients with cancer (0.20, 
0.01 to 0.38; global health/QoL 5.1, 0.3 to 9.7; n=828, 
five trials) and especially for those who received 
specialist palliative care early (0.33, 0.05 to 0.61, 
global health/QoL 8.5, 1.3 to 15.6; n=388, two trials). 
The results for pain and other secondary outcomes 
were inconclusive. Some methodological problems 
(such as lack of blinding) reduced the strength of the 
evidence.
COnClusiOns
Specialist palliative care was associated with a 
small effect on QoL and might have most 
pronounced effects for patients with cancer who 
received such care early. It could be most effective if 
it is provided early and if it identifies though 
screening those patients with unmet needs.

Introduction
Palliative care is usually provided by physicians and 
other healthcare professional from all disciplines (such 
as family medicine, cardiology, oncology). This is 
known as “general palliative care” and forms the basis 
of excellent palliative care for most patients.1  In addi-
tion, specialist palliative care (specialised or specialty 
palliative care) has grown substantially.2  Moreover, the 
importance of meaningful, effective, and sustainable 
models of specialist palliative care is widely recognised. 
For example, the invited “perspective” on the develop-
ment of such care published by Quill and Abernethy in 
2013 has been cited by over 80 PubMed listed publica-
tions.1  The World Health Organization (WHO), the Euro-
pean Association of Palliative Care (EAPC), and other 
institutions strongly recommend the provision of spe-
cialist palliative care,3 
4  but these recommendations are 
based on the descriptive analyses of available studies.5-7
We reviewed randomised controlled trials that 
 
compared the effect of specialist palliative care versus 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Recommendations from different institutions urge physicians to cooperate closely 
with providers of specialist palliative care and to integrate such care early in the 
course of their patients’ diseases
These recommendations were based on expert opinion or systematic reviews 
(without meta-analysis) that were not conducted according to the highest available 
standards of evidence based medicine
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Integration of specialised palliative care was associated with a small effect on 
quality of life
The effect was most pronounced for patients with cancer and for those who 
received specialised care early
This effect was observed even though all trials also provided specialised palliative 
care to patients who did not have symptoms nor any other needs for palliative care; 
instead, care was initiated according to diagnoses and stage of disease

standard care on the quality of life (QoL; primary out-
come), pain, and other outcomes in patients with 
advanced illness. Here, QoL is understood as health 
related QoL—that is, the patients’ QoL with its physical, 
psychological and social dimensions as affected by the 
disease.8 
9  This concept includes all domains of human 
suffering as in the physical, psychological, social, and 
spiritual domain. The main aim of palliative care is to 
improve QoL by preventing or relieving suffering in all of 
these dimensions.4 With our secondary outcomes we tried 
to capture various aspects of QoL (such as pain, dyspnoea, 
depression, anxiety, spiritual wellbeing, satisfaction with 
care, place of death, social wellbeing, and others).
Methods
This systematic review was registered10  
(www.crd.york.
a c .u k / P RO S P E RO/d i s p l ay _ re co rd . a s p? I D = 
CRD42015020674), conducted according to Cochrane 
standards in cooperation with the German Cochrane 
Centre, and is reported in compliance with the PRISMA 
(preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses) statement.11  Part of the specific meth-
ods for specialist palliative care (for example, definition 
of the intervention, patients, and outcomes) was devel-
oped by a consensus project of two international work-
ing groups.12
inclusion criteria
We included randomised controlled trials and cluster 
randomised controlled trials of specialist palliative care 
compared with standard care (full text articles and 
abstracts, no date or language restrictions) with adult 
(age ≥18) inpatients and outpatients with advanced ill-
ness. We defined advanced illness as malignant and 
non-malignant diseases that lead to a decline in general 
health and eventually to death.13
Zimmermann and colleagues defined specialist palli-
ative care as a “service of health care professionals from 
at least two different professions that provides or coor-
dinates comprehensive care for patients.”7 As palliative 
care aims to improve quality of life, we did not include 
study interventions focusing primarily on only one spe-
cific aspect (for example, symptoms like dyspnoea).
Studies that assessed specialist palliative care in hos-
pitals, hospices, or community settings were eligible as 
well as studies with a minority (<25%) of patients 
treated at home.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was patients’ quality of life. We 
included all tools that covered at least two dimensions 
of quality of life (physical, psychological or social). Sec-
ondary outcomes included symptom burden (pain, 
fatigue, nausea, and dyspnoea), psychosocial variables 
(distress, depression, anxiety, spiritual wellbeing, social 
wellbeing, and satisfaction), survival time, place of 
death, cost of care, and attrition (or completion rate).10
search
We first searched Medline (via Ovid), Embase (via 
DIMDI), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL, via Wiley), and PsycINFO (via EBSCO) in 
October 2015 (table A in appendix) and updated the 
search in July 2016. We used the Cochrane sensitivity 
and precision maximising search strategy14 and parts of 
the BMJ search filter15  to identify randomised controlled 
trials. We also searched palliative care textbooks,16-18 
reference lists of relevant reviews, abstract books, and 
trial registers (www.controlled-trials.com, www. 
clinicaltrials.gov, apps.who.int/trialsearch/). Thirteen 
leading authors of relevant research were contacted to 
identify unpublished data.
Data collection
Two reviewers (JG, WS) independently screened titles 
and abstracts, and disagreements were resolved by dis-
cussion with a third reviewer (GB). Relevant data from 
the included studies were extracted mostly from the 
text or tables (WS, JG). If information was present only 
in figures, we planned to contact authors or extract the 
data with help of a large printout and the use of a ruler 
to measure and subsequently calculate relevant values. 
Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collabora-
tion’s risk of bias tool19  (WS, JG). We used the GRADE 
(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation) system to evaluate the quality of 
evidence (classification in high, moderate, low, 
very low).20 
21
Data analysis
RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analyses and R for addi-
tional analyses.22  All meta-analyses were based on the 
random effects model with the DerSimonian-Laird esti-
mate for variance between studies. For continuous out-
comes, we used mean difference if outcomes were 
measured on the same scale. Otherwise, we calculated 
Hedges’ g as standardised mean difference (SMD: 0.2-
<0.5=small, 0.5-<0.8=moderate, ≥0.8=large effect).23 
 
The pooled SMDs of the quality of life analyses were 
re-expressed on the global health/QoL scale (item 29 
and 30) of the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 (0-100, high val-
ues=good quality of life). We chose 25.6 as the reference 
SD, which is the reference value for patients with recur-
rent/metastatic cancer of different origins.24 The proce-
dure of re-expressing SMDs with familiar instruments is 
described in the Cochrane Handbook (SMD×standard 
deviationreference=value on original scale).19  We chose a 
minimal clinically important difference of 8.1 for the 
global health/QoL scale based on the regression analy-
ses performed by Osoba and colleagues, which indi-
cated a change of 6.9 (breast cancer, n=246) and 10.7 
(small cell lung cancer, n=111) between each category, 
including the typical category of minimal clinically 
important difference “a little better.”25 The weighed 
mean of both slopes results in 8.1, which can be used as 
minimal clinically important difference.
Risk ratios were calculated for dichotomous out-
comes with the Mantel-Haenszel estimate to calculate 
the variance between studies. Dichotomous data were 
converted to Hedges’ g (for the depression compari-
son).23  For survival outcomes, we calculated the

logarithm of hazard ratios and corresponding standard 
errors using methods described in Parmar and col-
leagues26 when they were not reported. All estimates are 
presented with 95% confidence intervals. Significance 
was set at P≤0.05.
We accepted results of cluster randomised controlled 
trials without additional adjustment if trial authors 
considered the design properly in their analysis (such 
as multilevel model).19  Otherwise, we took unit of anal-
ysis issues into account by adjusting for cluster ran-
domised controlled trials according to the Cochrane 
Handbook—that is, using intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient obtained from authors of primary studies or from 
literature.19 Outcomes were analysed at the point of 
measurement of the primary outcome as defined in the 
randomised controlled trials (except for survival and 
place of death).
We evaluated statistical heterogeneity using χ2 test 
and I2 statistic23  (heterogeneity: 0-40%=small, 
30-60%=moderate, 50-90%=substantial, >75%=consid-
erable).20 We investigated clinical heterogeneity by pre-
specified subgroup analyses: cancer versus non-cancer; 
different non-cancer diseases; early versus not early 
specialist palliative care (early defined as: Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group 0-2 or Karnofsky index 
50-100 or 6-24 months estimated survival or initiation of 
specialist palliative care within eight weeks after diag-
nosis of an advanced incurable illness); younger versus 
elderly patients (age <60, 60-70, >70); and inpatients 
versus outpatients.
In sensitivity analyses, we used the Paule-Mandel 
estimate of the variance between studies recently rec-
ommended by Veroniki and colleagues.27  If studies 
reported only change in scores or scores after treatment 
and were included in the same meta-analysis, we eval-
uated potential differences in a sensitivity analysis.19 
Studies with extraordinary large effects in either direc-
tion were critically checked for flaws and evaluated in 
sensitivity analyses.
Patient involvement
We involved no patients in the development of the 
research question or in the selection of study design 
and outcome measures. No patients were involved in 
the conduct of the study. We do not plan to disseminate 
the results to study participants.
Results
We identified 3967 records through the database search 
or other sources (fig 1) and included 10 randomised con-
trolled trials that were published in 12 articles (2454 
patients: 1766 (72%) with cancer). The reasons we 
excluded articles after reading the full text are provided 
in table B in the appendix.
All trials were performed in hospitals and none in 
hospices or community settings (table 1 ). The interven-
tion varied across studies. Social workers and chaplains 
were part of the multiprofessional team in five of the 10 
trials (50%); all 10 studies included a nurse and nine 
studies (90%) included a physician. The control inter-
vention was usually described as “standard” or “usual” 
care. Four studies also provided palliative care in the 
control arm if this was requested by the patients. One 
study used a control group with multidisciplinary sup-
port28  and another provided telephone palliative care. 
The point in time of measurement of the primary out-
come ranged from a few days29-31  to six months.32  In five 
studies the primary outcome was assessed at three 
months (table 1).
All trials provided a “specialist palliative care for all” 
approach; none initiated integration of specialist palli-
ative care according to the individual needs or symp-
toms of patients as identified through screening. There 
were slight sex differences between intervention groups 
and control groups in the two smallest studies (5/10 
(50%) v 7/10 (70%)29 and 37/50 (74%) v 21/40 (52%),32 
respectively, were women). Across all studies, however, 
sex was equally distributed (1271/2454 (52%) were 
women; table C in appendix).
Three of the 10 included studies (30%) were cluster 
randomised controlled trials.32-35  We included two of 
them in meta-analysis as we considered that the adjust-
ment for clustering was appropriate.33 
34
The use of the Paule-Mandel estimator did not 
change any meta-analysis result substantially. We did 
not identify any systematic differences between change 
in scores versus scores after treatment if both were com-
bined in a meta-analysis. The only sensitivity analysis 
presented here evaluates the effect of a study36 that had 
extraordinary small 95% confidence intervals, resulting 
in an unusually large SMD.
risk of bias
In all studies, the risk of bias was low or unclear for 
most items (fig 2 ), but high for a lack of blinding of par-
ticipants and personnel in nine studies (90%). Three 
studies had a high risk for reporting bias because of out-
comes that were reported in the protocol but not in the

37  and because of different information in 
the protocol and the publication (one instead of three 
primary outcomes in the protocol).36  The risk for attri-
tion (withdrawal or dying) at the point in time of mea-
surement of the primary outcome was balanced (see fig 
A in appendix). The risk for attrition was slightly lower 
for standard care in the study by Gade and colleagues.30 
 
Rabow and colleagues analysed only patients who com-
peted all surveys.32  It is conflicting that the authors also 
reported deaths (10 in the specialist palliative care 
group and five in the standard care group) and losses to 
follow-up (five and four, respectively) during the study 
in the patient characteristics table. Seven trials (70%) 
explicitly mentioned that they had used intention to 
treat analysis (table C in appendix). Three explained 
how missing data were handled.34 37 38  Of these three 
studies, two presented only the available data and not 
imputed data as the main result.34  
38
Quality of evidence
We used GRADE to evaluate the quality of evidence of 
each outcome. This was moderate for quality of life and 
low for pain. Both outcomes are patient reported and 
were downgraded because of serious risk of bias from 
the lack of blinding. In addition, pain was downgraded 
because of serious imprecision of the 95% confidence 
interval (that is, wide range and small effects in both 
directions, table 2). The quality of evidence for other 
secondary outcomes is shown in table D in the 
 
appendix.
Primary outcome: quality of life
Eight of the 10 included studies (80%) measured qual-
ity of life. Only two studies used the same questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ-C30), while the six other studies used dif-
ferent assessment tools (table 3 ). The authors used well 
known and validated questionnaires like EORTC QLQ-
C30,24  functional assessment of cancer therapy-general 
(FACT-G)39  and lung (FACT-L),40  trial outcome index 
(TOI),40  functional assessment of chronic illness thera-
py-spiritual wellbeing (FACIT-Sp),41  Minnesota living 
with heart failure (MLHF) questionnaire,42  and less 
known validated questionnaires like the modified city 
of hope patient questionnaire(MCOHPQ)43  and the mul-
tidimensional quality of life scale (MQOLS)44  (table 3).
Three of the eight studies (38%) showed a small signif-
icant effect36-38  and four (50%) a non-significant effect in 
favour of specialist palliative care30-33  regarding the study 
specific assessment tools for quality of life (table 3).
We included seven randomised controlled trials in 
the meta-analysis. Overall, there was a small significant 
effect in favour of specialist palliative care (SMD 0.16, 
95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.31; n=1218, six trials, 
I2=38%, moderate quality of evidence; 95% prediction

*Risk in SPC (and its 95% CI) based on assumed risk in StC and relative effect of intervention (and its 95% CI).
†GRADE Working Group grades of evidence. High: very confident that true effect lies close to that of estimate of effect; moderate: moderately confident in effect estimate (true effect is likely to 
be close to estimate of effect, but there is possibility that it is substantially different); low: limited confidence in effect estimate (true effect could be substantially different from estimate of 
effect); very low: very little confidence in effect estimate (true effect is likely to be substantially different from estimate of effect).
‡QoE downgraded by one level because of serious risk of bias: blinding of participants and personnel is not possible in SPC studies; assessment of subjective outcome.
§QoE downgraded by one level because of serious imprecision: 95% CI has wide range and includes small effects in both directions.

effect on the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health/QoL scale 
was 4.1 (0.3 to 8.2).
In the sensitivity analysis (in which we included a 
study36 with a critically large effect), the effect estimate 
was much larger, though the 95% confidence interval 
also increased substantially because of excessive het-
erogeneity between studies (SMD: 0.57
, 95% confidence 
interval −0.02 to 1.15; n=1385, seven trials, I2=96%; 
fig 4). An effect of 14.6 (−0.5 to 29.4) was observed when 
the SMD was re-expressed on the EORTC QLQ-C30 
global health/QoL scale.
The effect in favour of specialist palliative care was 
marginally higher for patients with cancer (SMD: 0.20, 
95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.38; n=828, five trials; 
fig 5 ) and highest for early care (0.33, 0.05 to 0.61; 
n=388, two trials; fig 6). The re-expressed effects for the 
latter on the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health/QoL scale 
were 5.1 (0.3 to 9.7) and 8.5 (1.3 to 15.6), respectively.
Results of a sensitivity analysis of early versus not 
early specialist palliative care (including the Sidebot-
tom study36) and a subgroup analysis by age are pro-
vided in the appendix (figs B and C).
Pain
Four studies evaluated pain as outcome. Two numerical 
rating scales,32 36  a visual analogue scale,28  and the 
combination of two transformed verbal rating scales 
(range 0-100)34  were used to assess pain (table 3 ). One 
study showed contradictory results and could not be 
included in the meta-analysis because it did not provide 
standard deviations.32  We included three studies28

36 
 
in the meta-analysis after we linearly transformed the 
values of two of them28 
34  to a scale ranging from 0 to 10 
(higher values=more pain) (fig 7). Compared with stan-
dard care alone, the pooled effect for specialist pallia-
tive care showed a small but non-significant effect

three studies, I2=23%). The quality of evidence was low 
and downgraded because of lack of blinding and wide 
95% confidence intervals with effects in both  
directions.
Other outcomes, subgroup analyses, and additional 
information
The results for other secondary outcomes were incon-
clusive. Secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses 
are shown in the appendix (text, tables D-F, and figs 
D-J). Ongoing studies are reported in table G in the

discussion
summary of the findings
Specialist palliative care and its early integration might 
have a small effect on the quality of life of patients with 
cancer and without cancer, based on moderate quality 
of evidence. The effects on quality of life were most 
 
pronounced for patients with cancer and early integra-
tion of specialist palliative care. Notably, the results for 
pain and other secondary outcomes were inconclusive. 
Because of the obvious equivocal nature of the studies 
included in our review, special attention must be paid 
to the meticulous discussion of these findings. For this, 
we have provided detailed descriptions of the studies’ 
characteristics (strengths and weaknesses) along with 
specific considerations concerning methodological 
aspects of the meta-analysis.
what the review adds
This systematic review differs from previous publica-
tions5-7 in several aspects. These include the clear defi-
nition of inclusion criteria, clarity and extent of the 
provided results, a priori specified subgroup analyses 
(such as cancer, early specialist palliative care), and 
interpretability.
We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses 
for key outcomes. In contrast with previous works,5-7

we provide detailed information about effect size, con-
fidence intervals, significance, and a prediction interval 
for the main result. The SMD had to be calculated for 
the quality of life meta-analysis because different tools 
were used by the authors. We provided results on the 
original scales (table 3 ) and as SMD in the meta-analy-
sis. Because understanding of the effect as SMD might 
be not intuitive, we re-expressed the SMD on the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 global health/QoL scale. The confidence inter-
vals of the latter overlapped the minimal clinically 
important difference of 8.1 for all comparisons, indicat-
ing that specialist palliative care might have a clinically 
meaningful effect. Also, of utmost importance is a pre-
cise definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
specialist palliative care interventions, and the discus-
sion of the methodological quality of the trials (see 
below). This could have important implications for the 
conclusions drawn for practice and policy.12
strengths, weaknesses, and characteristics of the 
included studies
As is the case in most research settings of palliative 
care, the included trials differed largely in several 
aspects, such as the population studied, the outcomes 
chosen, the clinical setting, and the duration of the 
study.
The oldest trial, published by Jordhøy and colleagues 
in 2000-01, included only patients with advanced can-
cer.34 35 This cluster randomised controlled trial is the 
only trial that provided specialist palliative care for 
inpatients and outpatients, and the care team relied on 
a comparably large and multiprofessional workforce 
including three physicians, two nurses, social worker, 
priest, nutritionist, and physiotherapist. The team 
scheduled routine follow-up visits with the community 
staff and was available for home visits, visits in nursing 
homes, and visits in the hospital. The primary out-
comes (Jordhøy and colleagues defined multiple pri-
mary outcomes) included quality of life measured on a 
cancer specific questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and 
were assessed after four months, and patients were 
even followed for up to six months. Though it is one of 
the three largest trials (434 patients randomised), only 
around one of three patients completed the trial, mainly 
because of the high mortality in this population with 
advanced cancer (table F in the appendix), which might 
impede intention to treat analysis.
The second oldest trial we included was that of Hanks 
and colleagues31 in 2002. The so called imPaCT study 
was not restricted to patients with cancer, but in 243 of 
the 261 randomised inpatients (93%) cancer was the 
leading disease. The specialist palliative care team con-
sisted of nurses and physicians. Interestingly, in con-
trast with all other studies, all patients in the control 
group also received palliative care, but this was limited 
to telephone advice. Even though, this could have led to 
an underestimation of the true effect of the active inter-
vention. As results were obtained after the first week, it 
did not allow for capturing long term effects of special-
ist palliative care. By week one, data were already 
unavailable for more than one in four patients who was 
initially randomised (10 of these had switched from the 
control to the intervention group). Patients were 
reported as missing because they were too ill, tired, or 
just not available. Though attrition is always an issue in 
clinical research in patients with advanced progressive 
disease, such a high dropout is surprising after just one 
week. We do not know whether this could have led to 
underestimation or overestimation of the true effect of 
the intervention.
In 2004 Rabow and colleagues published results of a 
relatively small cluster randomised controlled trial 
(n=90) studying the effects of specialist palliative care 
on patients with (n=30, 33%) and without cancer who 
were cared for in hospital outpatient clinics.32 The 
results were obtained after six months, so this study 
reported long term effects. The care team consisted of 
many different professions (physicians, nurse, social 
worker, chaplain, pharmacist, psychologist, art thera-
pist, volunteer coordinator) and provided recommenda-
tions on study entry in the middle and the end of the 
trial. Problematically, results were reported with the 
number of randomised patients (50 in the intervention 
group and 40 in the control group), even though consid-
erable dropout was reported after 12 months (table F in 
the appendix). Also problematic, no P values or stan-
dard deviations were reported at six months and are 
unavailable because of death of the author and loss of 
the original data. We could not therefore include this 
trial in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome 
(quality of life).
In 2008, Gade and colleagues published results of the 
biggest trial included in our review.30  As in the study of 
Rabow and colleagues32 this multicentre randomised 
controlled trial included patients with (159/512, 31%) 
and without cancer, but in contrast, included only inpa-
tients. Here, the specialist palliative care team was also 
able to provide care from four professions (physician, 
nurse, social worker, chaplain). Key outcomes were 
obtained two weeks after discharge from the hospital. 
At this time, dropout was 29% (81/280) in the interven-
tion group and 19% (46/237) in the control group, 
mainly because of a larger number of deaths in the 
intervention group. This might impede intention to 
treat analysis but was mainly due to premature death of 
the patients (median survival between 30 and 36 days 
in the two groups). Overall survival (that is, during 
admission to hospital and discharge) did not differ sig-
nificantly.
Temel and colleagues carried out a randomised con-
trolled trial with 151 outpatients with lung cancer who 
received early palliative care provided by a specialist 
team (only two professions: physician and nurse) on a 
regular basis (intervention) or at the request of the 
oncology team (control).38 
45  They also reported signifi-
cant dropout at 12 weeks (17/77 (22%) in the intervention 
group and 27/74 (36%) in the control group), when the 
primary endpoint was assessed. The main analysis of 
the study was based on complete cases. The authors 
stated that “last observation carried forward” was used 
to deal with missing data in a sensitivity analysis and

underestimation of the intervention’s true effect. 
Though this method is widely criticised,46  it could still 
provide a conservative approach in a deteriorating 
 
population.47
The 2010 study by Cheung and colleagues29 differed 
considerably from other included studies. Some of the 
study characteristics not only make it difficult to com-
pare the findings to other studies but are also problem-
atic from the methodological view. In this randomised 
controlled trial, patients in the intensive care unit were 
included if the duty intensivist deemed it appropriate 
that a “do not resuscitate” order be written for the 
patient. In the intervention group, patients were seen by 
a specialist palliative care team (nurse, physician, regis-
trar). Only 20 patients were randomised, and most (16) 
died in hospital. It is unclear how many of them had can-
cer. Quality of life measures were not obtained (we did 
not include this study in meta-analysis of our primary 
outcome), but other outcomes were recorded on death or 
discharge. Despite the small study sample and the short 
duration of the trial (at least two days), data were 
unavailable for 11 of the 20 patients. Still, the authors 
attempted intention to treat analysis without providing 
information about how they dealt with missing data.
In the randomised controlled trial by Wallen and col-
leagues,28 patients with advanced cancer who were 
admitted for surgery were randomised postoperatively 
to be followed by a pain and specialist palliative care 
team (nurse and physician, but other closely associated 
team members on demand including social work, chap-
laincy, reiki, nutrition, etc). The team held a 24 hour 
on-call service and provided monthly follow-up. The 
authors failed to obtain quality of life data, and the defi-
nition of the primary outcome was not clear. The 
authors obtained data at three, six, and 12 months, but 
it is unclear which time they consider most relevant. 
Dropout was around 30% after three months (24/76 
(32%) in intervention group, 23/76 (30%) in control 
group). The author did not mention an imputation 
method for dealing with missing data.
More recently, Zimmermann and colleagues per-
formed an elaborate cluster randomised controlled 
trial, the second largest trial included in this review 
(n=461).33 Patients with cancer received either standard 
care with specialist palliative care consultations as 
requested by the oncology team (control) or regular vis-
its (at least monthly plus on demand) and a 24 hour on 
call service of a professional specialist palliative care 
team (physician and nurse). Patients were followed 
closely; most patients had four or more visits with the 
team. In addition, the team was available for inpatient 
visits if the patients were admitted to hospital. Though 
the dropout rate for completing the FACIT-Sp was high 
(180/461 (39%) after three months), it similar in both 
groups (see also table F in the appendix). Approaches 
for dealing with missing data (last observation carried 
forward, complete case evaluation, and multiple impu-
tations) were described in detail, and results were 
robust.
Sidebottom and colleagues36  published results of a 
recent randomised controlled trial that is quite different 
from the others included in the review. The authors pro-
vided palliative care for patients with heart failure, 
which is a rather neglected issue.48 The study was ade-
quately powered and included 232 inpatients who 
received specialist palliative care if requested by the 
cardiology team (control) or a mandatory initial visit 
with the well equipped team (four professions). If nec-
essary, further appointments were scheduled. Interest-
ingly, overall survival of patients in the intervention 
group was shorter, though this was not significant. 
Dropout was 32% (79/116) in the intervention group and 
24% (28/116) in the control group after three months, 
with 14 and five deaths, respectively. The authors did 
not give information on how they dealt with missing 
data. More bothersome are issues around the assess-
ment of quality of life, which was performed with the 
Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire 
(MLHF). Sensitivity analysis for this trial showed that 
though the treatment effect was modest (mean differ-
ence of 3.06 on MLHF, range-105) the quality of life esti-
mate was extremely large (SMD 3.02) because of small 
variation of values (authors were contacted for verifica-
tion). This extreme treatment effect would have severely 
affected the findings of the meta-analysis and resulted 
in extreme heterogeneity (that is, I2=96%, fig 4). We 
therefore excluded the study from our primary quality 
of life meta-analysis.
Grudzen et al37 published the most current ran-
domised controlled trial that we included. In this elab-
orate adequately powered trial (n=136), the authors 
included patients with cancer but initiated specialist 
palliative care consultation (intervention group) only 
for those patients who were referred to the emergency 
department (control was consultation on request of the 
emergency physicians). After 12 weeks, quality of life of 
patients receiving specialist palliative care was signifi-
cantly and clinically better. Missing data, however, 
were dealt with by carrying forward baseline measures 
to perform intention to treat analysis.
Potential reasons for overestimation and 
underestimation of effects
Lack of blinding in specialist palliative care interven-
tions might have accounted for overestimation of effects 
because of performance and detection bias. In addition, 
we could not include two studies with inconclusive or 
even negative results for specialist palliative care30 
32 in 
the survival analysis and other meta-analyses because 
of inadequate reporting of data (authors were con-
tacted).
Temel and colleagues reported a large number of 
missing values because of early deaths of patients.38 
They observed similar results, however, in a complete 
case analysis and with the “last observation carried for-
ward” approach. They point out that this method might 
lead to underestimation of the true effect, which in this 
study would therefore also apply for the complete case 
analysis.
Additionally, the implementation of a randomised con-
trolled trial by itself leads to increased recognition of the 
specialist palliative care team and palliative care issues in

general.7  This increases referral to specialist palliative 
care and recognition of palliative care needs in the control 
group, though the number of contacts by the palliative 
care team in the control group was usually not reported in 
the included studies. Moreover, some of the included 
studies even provide enhanced palliative care support in 
addition to standard care in the control arm. For example, 
Hanks and colleagues provided palliative care telephone 
consultations for the standard care group.31
implications for practice and policy
“Specialist palliative care for all” versus “as needed”
Our findings might be surprising and even disappoint-
ing for many advocates of palliative care because the 
reported effect sizes are smaller than many have 
expected. Yet, we strongly believe that the most import-
ant reason for the small effect size on quality of life and 
the inconclusive findings for the secondary outcomes 
could be the care approach used in the trials. All trials 
provided a “specialist palliative care for all” approach 
and neglected the potential role of general palliative 
care. As a result, all patients at certain stage of a certain 
disease were referred to specialist palliative care. For 
example, in the study of Temel and colleagues all 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer stage IIIb and 
IV were referred to the intervention, even if they did not 
have major symptoms (such as pain, anxiety, dyspnoea, 
etc) or other distressing conditions such as spiritual or 
social problems.38  Meanwhile, many from the specialty 
of palliative care question the feasibility, practicability, 
and efficiency of this approach.1  Quill and Abernethy 
reported that it is not feasible to refer all patients at the 
palliative stage of their disease to specialist teams.1 
 
Such teams cannot be made available for so many 
patients because of resource allocation issues.1 49 The 
authors also point to the obligation of every physician 
to hold general skills in palliative care. Physicians must 
be capable and willing to deal with basic needs for pal-
liative care but also refer those patients with complex 
needs to specialist palliative care.
We strongly support such an approach (“general pal-
liative care for all plus specialist palliative care as 
needed”). This model recognises the importance of gen-
eral palliative care (and interventions that will 
strengthen palliative care) as well as the necessity to 
provide specialist care to patients for whom general 
palliative care is not enough. Yet, we must emphasise a 
missing link. In our view, this link is routine structured 
screening for needs of all patients for palliative care as 
reported by the patients themselves. Such routine 
screening (for example, for symptom burden) is known 
to increase quality of life in these patients and reduce 
emergency admissions50  and could be a practical trig-
ger to identify those who need specialist palliative 
care.51 It is beyond the scope of this review to recom-
mend a certain tool, but it is obvious that such a ques-
tionnaire (paper and pencil or electronic) must at the 
minimum contain the main symptoms (such as pain, 
anxiety, dyspnoea) reported by patients themselves.
Given the hypothesis, that “specialist palliative care 
as needed” is more effective, this would mean that the 
effects of specialist palliative care reported by the stud-
ies included in our review might have been underesti-
mated because patients without such needs were 
included in the intervention group (potential non-re-
sponders) and, as reported by Zimmermann and col-
leagues,7 the implementation of trials leads to an 
increased recognition of palliative care issues and an 
enhanced use of specialist palliative care in the stan-
dard care group.
Patients with and without cancer
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) rec-
ommends the integration of (specialist) palliative care 
early in the course of the disease.6  Our findings support 
this recommendation (figs 5 and 6 ). The meta-analyses 
for patients with heart failure indicate a large effect on 
quality of life (fig 4 ). Conclusions should be drawn 
carefully, however, because of the methodological 
aspects of the heart failure study36 that were discussed 
above. Future studies are needed to reproduce these 
quality of life findings.
Multiprofessional team
Our definition for specialist palliative care was strict. 
For example, we chose the multiprofessional team 
approach as major prerequisite based on discussions 
with another working group in the specialty.7 12  This 
could be problematic because it excludes excellent ran-
domised controlled trials, such as the trial by Maltoni 
and colleagues52  (increased quality of life) or Bakitas 
and colleagues53  (increased survival). In these and 
other similar trials (table B in the appendix), the pallia-
tive care intervention comprised mainly one profession. 
Interestingly, in the physician led palliative care inter-
vention of Maltoni and colleagues,52  the reported effects 
on quality of life were restricted to physical domains. In 
preparation of the protocol, we had numerous discus-
sions within the working group and also with other 
working groups12  concerning this question. Yet, we 
decided to stick to the definition of Zimmerman and col-
leagues7 because this had so far been the only system-
atic review on specialist palliative care. More important, 
most members of our working groups believed that 
according to the WHO definition and the general under-
standing of palliative care, a multiprofessional team 
should be mandatory, particularly in specialised pallia-
tive care.
limitations and implications for future research
Several limitations of this review must also be noted. 
Some might be avoidable in the future if researchers in 
the specialty would agree on basic recommendations.
Endpoints, statistics, risk of bias
• Quality of life is the main goal of palliative care4 and 
therefore the primary outcome of this review. Surpris-
ingly, not all trials assessed it. We suggest that 
researchers should implement at least one validated 
quality of life measure in future randomised con-
trolled trials (table G in the appendix)

• Because of the different measures of quality of life, 
we had to use the SMD for the meta-analysis of this 
primary outcome. The tools were variable, including 
general tools (EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-G) and disease 
specific (TOI, MLHF) and domain specific (FACIT-Sp) 
tools. As a pragmatic approach, we re-expressed the 
pooled SMDs for the EORTC global health/QoL scale 
and provided a minimal clinically important differ-
ence for the clinical interpretation. Ideally, future 
studies should use a consensus based measure of 
quality of life that assesses as many domains as pos-
sible (physical, psychosocial, spiritual), is validated 
(in many languages), and is change sensitive. Though 
the commonly used FACT-G questionnaire33 37 38 and 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire have been used 
successfully in many trials, they are restricted to 
patients with cancer. The ideal tool would be disease 
independent. It is beyond the scope of this manu-
script to recommend a specific tool
• Risk of bias was high in most studies, relating to mod-
erate quality of the assessable evidence of quality of 
life. The main problem of trials in specialised pallia-
tive care that contributes to this is blinding of person-
nel and participants. This problem is so far unsolved 
and will probably remain a main challenge in assess-
ing complex palliative care and specialised palliative 
care interventions
• Some minor deviations from the registered review 
protocol are reported in table H in the appendix
• Typically, many patients in specialised palliative care 
studies will die before the time point of the primary 
quality of life analysis. As recommended by Shih 
(2002),54 patients dying before the final analysis 
should be included in the analysis by imputing the 
worst value. For patients lost to follow-up for other 
reasons, more advanced methods to impute missing 
values, such as multiple imputation, should be used 
instead of the inferior method of last observation car-
ried forward.
Fundamental challenges for conducting trials in 
palliative care
The scarcity of the evidence we found for our review 
might be surprising, but several fundamental issues 
impede the conduct of interventional trials in the spe-
cialty of palliative care. For example, from the public 
and ethical perspective it might be questionable to pro-
vide a palliative care intervention (here specialised pal-
liative care) only for those patients who are in the 
intervention group, even though palliative care should 
be available for all patients. This refers to the ethical 
principle of equipoise—that is, an intervention that is 
thought to be beneficial should not be withheld from 
patients in the control arm of a trial.55 In the palliative 
care setting, this is a dilemma. One does not want to 
restrict ideal palliative care to those patients who are in 
the intervention group of a clinical trial. Yet, in practice, 
such trials are the only means to provide routine pallia-
tive care for patients in many centres because palliative 
care services are not sufficiently used. One of the main 
reasons is that non-palliative care physicians often 
 
hesitate to refer to palliative care services. Therefore, 
trials are needed to provide the necessary evidence to 
overcome these barriers to referrals.
In addition, specialised palliative care is a complex 
intervention that involves teamwork of different profes-
sions. To develop feasible and effective interventions in 
different settings, a structured approach is required. 
The MRC Framework56 provides concise guidance for 
such a project. Such a complex and time consuming 
process requires resources that many research groups 
around the world cannot rely on. It can be assumed that 
many of them fail somewhere along the way between 
identifying the research question, writing a meaningful 
protocol, and developing a meaningful intervention.
Concerning the scarcity of the available evidence, we 
are optimistic for the future. Currently, many protocols 
for randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of 
specialised palliative care have been registered (table G 
in the appendix). We believe that updates to our review 
will be able to include a larger number of randomised 
controlled trials in a future meta-analysis.
Conclusion
The integration of specialised palliative care was asso-
ciated with a small effect on quality of life, whereas the 
results for pain and other secondary outcomes were 
inconclusive. The effect on quality of life might be more 
pronounced for patients with cancer and for those who 
received specialised palliative care early. This effect was 
observed even though all trials also provided special-
ised palliative care to patients who did not have symp-
toms nor had any other needs for palliative care. 
Instead, it was initiated according to diagnosis and 
stage of disease. Moreover, the true effects of special-
ised palliative care might have been underestimated 
because of various methodological issues. We hypothe-
sise that specialised palliative care could be most effec-
tive if it is provided early and if it identifies patients 
with unmet needs through screening (“care as 
needed”). We hope that the discussion of the impor-
tance of general palliative care and the detailed descrip-
tion of shortcomings of the included studies will 
increase the quality of further clinical research in the 
specialty of palliative care.
