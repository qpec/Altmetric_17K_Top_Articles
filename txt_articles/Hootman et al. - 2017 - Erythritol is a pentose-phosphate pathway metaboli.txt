Metabolomic markers associated with incident central adiposity
gain were investigated in young adults. In a 9-mo prospective
study of university freshmen (n = 264). Blood samples and anthro-
pometry measurements were collected in the first 3 d on campus
and at the end of the year. Plasma from individuals was pooled by
phenotype [incident central adiposity, stable adiposity, baseline
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 5.05%, HbA1c < 4.92%] and assayed using
GC-MS, chromatograms were analyzed using MetaboliteDetector
software, and normalized metabolite levels were compared using
Welch’s t test. Assays were repeated using freshly prepared pools,
and statistically significant metabolites were quantified in a tar-
geted GC-MS approach. Isotope tracer studies were performed to
determine if the potential marker was an endogenous human me-
tabolite in men and in whole blood. Participants with incident
central adiposity gain had statistically significantly higher blood
erythritol [P < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.0435], and the
targeted assay revealed 15-fold [95% confidence interval (CI):
13.27, 16.25] higher blood erythritol compared with participants
with stable adiposity. Participants with baseline HbA1c > 5.05%
had 21-fold (95% CI: 19.84, 21.41) higher blood erythritol compared
with participants with lower HbA1c (P < 0.001, FDR = 0.00016).
Erythritol was shown to be synthesized endogenously from glucose
via the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) in stable isotope-assisted
ex vivo blood incubation experiments and through in vivo conver-
sion of erythritol to erythronate in stable isotope-assisted dried
blood spot experiments. Therefore, endogenous production of
erythritol from glucose may contribute to the association between
erythritol and obesity observed in young adults.

n the fall of 2015, an estimated 3.3 million high-school grad-
uates enrolled in postsecondary education as first-time college
freshmen (1), and the transition to a residential college envi-
ronment is associated with weight gain. About 75% of the pop-
ulation experiences weight gain during this transition (2, 3), but
there have been few efforts to identify biomarkers of risk that
could guide prevention efforts. A study (4) in monozygotic twins
discordant for body mass index (BMI) reported divergence at
about the age of 18 y, corresponding to a time in life when the
environment shifts, and further underscoring the importance of
young adulthood in the lifetime trajectory of adiposity and as a
window of opportunity for prevention (5).
Observational studies of young adults focus on behavioral/envi-
ronmental risk factors for adiposity gain, with few studies reporting
biological markers in relation to either cross-sectional and/or lon-
gitudinal changes in adiposity or body weight. A recent overview of
intervention studies to prevent weight gain in young adults (6)
identified 37 studies; the majority assessed diet, physical activity, and
behaviors, with only 10 studies directly measuring changes in weight,
BMI [weight (kilograms)/height (square meters)] and/or body com-
position, and none of the studies measured biological markers.
Existing prediction or risk scores integrate across the various
domains contributing to weight gain risk, including demographic,
anthropometric, behavioral, psychological, diet-related, and
physical activity (7), but do not incorporate biological markers.
Metabolomics approaches, which measure the final downstream
products of the complex interactions between genetic, environ-
mental, and pharmacological influences, have been used to study
obesity as a phenotype, but few studies have investigated metabo-
lite profiles that are predictive of risk of future weight gain in young
adults who are not currently overweight or obese. A recent study
(8) investigated the metabolic signature associated with adiposity
and adiposity change in participants aged 16–39 y. This study fo-
cused on a prespecified set of 67 metabolites, including lipoproteins,
inflammatory markers, fatty acids, and glycolysis precursors.
Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), lipoprotein-related me-
tabolites, and glycolysis-related metabolites were all positively
Significance
The prevention of weight gain in adulthood is a public health
challenge, particularly given the difficulty of losing weight. Data on
freshmen were collected at the beginning and end of the academic
year, and baseline blood samples were studied to find markers of
incident weight gain. A metabolite, erythritol, was elevated at the
beginning of the year in freshmen who went on to gain weight,
fat, and abdominal fat compared with freshmen with stable
weight. Erythritol is a sugar substitute low-calorie sweetener, and
prior studies claimed no endogenous synthesis. We report a pre-
viously unrecognized metabolism of glucose to erythritol, and
given the association between erythritol and weight gain, research
is needed to understand whether and how this pathway contrib-
utes to weight gain risk.

 associated with change in BMI. Studies in older adults also identi-
fied the BCAA-related signature, and reported higher leucine/
isoleucine and valine in obese compared with nonobese individ-
uals (4, 9–11). Furthermore, experimental research using metab-
olomic profiling identified causal effects of weight gain on multiple
blood metabolites, including elevation of BCAAs, very low-density
lipoprotein (8, 10, 12), triacylglycerol (10), C-reactive protein (8,
10), and insulin-like growth factor (10). However, the role of an-
tecedent metabolomic markers in weight gain and the human adi-
posity phenotype is not established.
We investigated the relation of the metabolome to incident
adiposity gain in young adults over the first year of college. A
nontargeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectropho-
tometry (GC-MS) approach was used to identify novel metabo-
lites associated with incident adiposity gain, and the endogenous
synthesis of a biomarker associated with adiposity gain was in-
vestigated by stable isotope-assisted metabolomics approaches.
Finally, in vivo and ex vivo stable isotope-assisted metabolomics
approaches were used to investigate whether the risk biomarker
originated from the diet and/or through endogenous synthesis.
Methods
Study Sample. The study used data from a recently completed longitudinal
cohort study of college freshmen residing on campus during their freshman year
(2011–2012) at a university in the northeastern United States. Study participants
were selected through stratified random sampling of the incoming freshman
class to recruit equal numbers of males and females and to represent the
characteristics of the full incoming class. Participants were aged 18–19 y, about
50% were female, and about 10.5% were overweight (BMI > 25) at the study
baseline. The study was approved by the Cornell University Institutional Review
Board, and all participants provided informed consent.
Collection of Participant Data. Data were collected during participant study visits
and included anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist and hip
circumferences) using standardized methods and plasma for metabolomics
(nonfasting), which was collected within the participants’ first 3 d on campus and
at the end of the academic year (mean follow-up time = 35 wk, SD = 1.5).
Adiposity, measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic Inc.),
was assessed within the first 2 wk and at the end of the academic year.
Blood was collected into EDTA vacutainers (BD), stored at 4 °C for 30–90 min,
centrifuged at a relative centrifugal force of 1,300 × g for 10 min, divided into
three to four cryovials, and transferred to –80 °C freezers for storage. He-
moglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker of usual glycemia and long-term glycemic
control, was measured in whole blood using the Dimension Xpand Plus In-
tegrated Chemistry System (Siemens).
Phenotypes related to cardiometabolic risk groups were defined as fol-
lows: (i) incident central adiposity gain defined by changes in all three in-
dicators: weight increase > 0.5 kg, DXA truncal adiposity increase > 200 g,
and waist circumference increase > 0.5 cm (n = 66); (ii) stable adiposity de-
fined by minimal changes in the same three markers of adiposity, namely,
body weight, DXA truncal adiposity, and waist circumference (n = 16);
(iii) HbA1c in the top 25% of baseline distribution (HbA1c > 5.05%, or
∼32 nmol/mol; n = 21); and (iv) HbA1c in the bottom 10% of baseline dis-
tribution (HbA1c < 4.92%, or ∼30 nmol/mol; n = 7). Within each phenotype
group, individual participant blood samples were combined to form a pooled
sample for metabolomics analysis, and triplicate aliquots of each pool were
assayed. To investigate dose–response associations, subpools were created and
assayed in triplicate. For the HbA1c groups, subpools were defined by the
median of the distribution of individual values (two subpools for each HbA1c
group). The incident central adiposity gain group was divided into three
subgroups based on the degree of central adiposity gain (the three subpools
are described in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods). Plasma aliquots
were express-shipped on dry ice for metabolomics assays conducted at the
Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg.
Data Collection: Metabolomics. Metabolite extraction and chemical derivati-
zation were followed by GC-MS to yield high-dimensional data that were
analyzed by MetaboliteDetector software (13) and subsequently statistically
evaluated by R (release 3.1.2). All samples were assayed in triplicate to
provide estimates of technical variation. Before statistical analysis, metab-
olite levels were normalized by reference pools (every metabolite level di-
vided by the mean signal of the same metabolite level in a pooled sample of
two measured pools chronologically closest to the measured sample). First, a
nontargeted metabolomics assay of 305 metabolites was conducted. Second,
an optimized assay of 107 metabolites was designed based on the first set of
findings, and starting over with freshly prepared pools, the four original
groups and the subpools were assayed. Signals that persisted were considered
as validated. Third, a targeted and quantitative GC-MS analysis was conducted
on the subset of metabolites of interest, including fructose, leucine, isoleucine,
valine, lactic acid, and erythritol. For this purpose, external standard solution
series were produced containing the metabolites of interest.
Statistical Analysis. In the nontargeted GC-MS analysis, multiple testing was
accounted for by calculating false discovery rate (FDR) Q-values (14); the
threshold of FDR = 0.2 was set a priori for statistical significance. The
metabolome at study baseline in participants with incident central adiposity
gain was compared with the metabolome of participants with stable adi-
posity. The metabolome of participants with higher HbA1c (HbA1c > 5.05%)
at the study baseline was compared with the metabolome of participants
with lower HbA1c (HbA1c < 4.9%). Welch’s t test was used to test for dif-
ferences in the mean metabolites between groups, and the nominal P value
was adjusted for multiple comparisons to yield the FDR. The FDR Q-values
were computed separately for the comparison of the weight groups and for
the comparison of the glycemia groups. Discovery and quantitative assay
results were analyzed using the same statistical methods.
Human and Cell Studies of Erythritol Metabolism.
Blood incubation experiments. To investigate erythritol metabolism in humans,
an ex vivo stable isotope-assisted blood incubation experiment was per-
formed on five healthy male volunteers. Before blood collection, basal
glucose levels were determined with a commercially available glucometer
(Diamond Mini; ForaCare). From each volunteer, 1 mL of whole blood was
collected via finger prick into K2EDTA-coated vacutainers (BD) and aliquoted
in 300-μL portions. Each aliquot was supplemented with a 1 M [U13C]glucose,
[6-13C1]glucose, [1,2-13C2]glucose, or [3,4-13C2]glucose (CLM-1396-1, CLM-
2717-PK, CLM-504, or CLM-6750-MPT-PK; Cambridge Isotopes) solution to
a final total glucose (labeled + unlabeled) concentration of 15 mM. The
volume of the 1 M tracer solution added to the blood depended on the
blood glucose concentration measured before and was adjusted to reach a
final concentration of 15 mM glucose in all samples. After spiking the tracer,
the blood samples were incubated at 37 °C under continuous shaking on an
orbital shaker at a mixing frequency of 600 rpm (ThermoMixer comfort with
thermoblock to cover 1.5-mL reaction vessels, Eppendorf).
Whole-blood samples were collected 5 min before addition of the tracers and
1, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after addition of the tracers. For metabolite extraction,
each sample was extracted in triplicate by mixing 10 μL of whole blood with 90 μL
of ice-cold extraction fluid [8:1 methanol/water mixture (vol/vol)] containing
5 μg/mL pentanedioic-d6 acid (D-5227; C/D/N Isotopes, Inc.) as an internal stan-
dard. After mixing at 1,400 rpm on an orbital shaker (Eppendorf Thermomixer
comfort) for 5 min at 4 °C and subsequent centrifugation at 21.000 × g at 4 °C
for 10 min, 70 μL of supernatant was transferred into a GC glass vial with a
microinsert (5–250 μL) and dried in a refrigerated rotary vacuum evaporator
(Labconco) at −4 °C for 3 h before GC-MS measurement.
Dried blood spot analysis. To evaluate erythritol synthesis from glucose in vivo,
2 g of [U13C]glucose (CLM-1396-MPT; Cambridge Isotopes) was administered
orally to three healthy male donors and dried blood samples were collected
via finger prick at T0 and at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after
ingestion on dried blood spot cards (Whatman protein saver cards, Z699519-
100EA; Sigma–Aldrich). To analyze the impact of erythritol intake on human
glucose metabolism in vivo, 50 g of commercially available erythritol
(Erythrit, Charge: 435FET8B77; Natur Total) was ingested 2 min before the
45-min time point. The dried blood spot cards were allowed to dry at room
temperature for 3 h, transferred to zip-lock foil bags containing a desiccant,
and stored at 4 °C until metabolite extraction.
The exact blood sampling times and blood glucose concentrations after in-
gestion of [U13C]glucose were monitored by an in-house Android application
and glucometers (Diamond Mini; ForaCare). For each card (representing one
time point), dried blood metabolites were extracted in triplicate. For each rep-
licate, two punch-outs with a diameter of 3 mm were added to 80 μL of ice-
cold extraction fluid [8:1 methanol/water mixture (vol/vol)] containing 1 μg/mL
[U13C]ribitol (ALD-062; Omicron Biochemicals, Inc.) as an internal standard,
vortexed at 4 °C for 10 min at 1,400 rpm on an orbital shaker (ThermoMixer
comfort, Eppendorf), and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 16,000 × g; 60 μL of
supernatant was transferred into GC glass vials with a microinsert (5–250 μL)
and dried in a refrigerated vacuum concentrator (Labconco) overnight at −4 °C.
In addition, to analyze whether erythritol is oxidized to erythronate in
vivo, erythritol and erythronate levels were quantified by standard addition.

 Twenty-five microliters of defined standard solutions was pipetted onto each
spot of the dried blood spot cards and extracted in accordance with the
extraction protocol used for dried blood spots.
GC-MS measurements. Automated sample derivatization was performed using a
GERSTEL multipurpose sampler. Dried samples were dissolved in 15 μL of pyridine,
containing 20 mg/mL methoxyamine hydrochloride, at 40 °C for 90 min under
shaking. After adding 15 μL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide
(Macherey-Nagel), samples were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min under continu-
ous shaking.
GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph
coupled to an Agilent 5975C inert XL Mass Selective Detector (both from Agilent
Technologies). A sample volume of 1 μL was injected into a split/splitless inlet in
split mode (10:1) at 270 °C. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a 30-m
DB-35MS (i.d. = 250 μm, film thickness = 0.25 μm) capillary column plus 5-m
DuraGuard capillary in front of the analytical column (Agilent J&W GC Column).
Helium was used as carrier gas with a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL·min−1. The GC
oven temperature was held at 90 °C for 1 min and increased to 320 °C at
15 °C·min−1, and then held at that temperature for 8 min. The total run time for
each sample was 24.333 min. The transfer line temperature was set constantly to
280 °C. The mass selective detector was operating under electron ionization at
70 eV. The MS source was held at 230 °C, and the quadrupole was held at 150 °C.
Full scan mass spectra were acquired from m/z 70 to m/z 800. For precise ab-
solute quantification, GC-MS measurements of the derivatives of interest were
additionally performed in selected ion monitoring mode (SI Appendix,
Supplemental Methods).
Deconvolution of mass spectra, peak picking, integration, and retention
index calibration were performed using MetaboliteDetector software.
Compounds were identified using an in-house mass spectra library. The
following deconvolution settings were applied: peak threshold = 5, minimum
peak height = 5, bins per scan = 10, deconvolution width = five scans, no
baseline adjustment, minimum of 15 peaks per spectrum, and no minimum
required base peak intensity. Retention index calibration was based on a
C10-C40 even n-alkane mixture (68281; Sigma-Aldrich).
Results
Sample Description. In the longitudinal study of 264 freshmen
members of the class of 2015, 65% (n = 172) of participants had data
available at both the beginning and the end of the academic year. In
participants with two data points, 75% gained weight (>0.5 kg) over
the year; on average, the weight gain was a 3.6% increase in body
weight.
There were no participants with a medical history of diabetes,
other cardiometabolic disease, or insulin use. Sixty-six participants
had incident central adiposity gain; these participants increased
4.0 kg (SD = 2.0) in weight, 3.9 cm (SD = 2.0) in waist circum-
ference, and 2.6% (SD = 1.5) in DXA-derived truncal adiposity.
In contrast, 16 participants were stable on the adiposity indicators,
with an average weight change of 0.6 kg (SD = 1.1), waist cir-
cumference change of 0.4 cm (SD = 1.7), and DXA-derived
truncal adiposity change of −0.1% (SD = 0.5).
Given that the sample was young and healthy, the HbA1c levels
were within normal limits (4.0–6.0% for ages ≥ 18 y). Thus, a dis-
tributional approach was used to define two phenotype groups for
comparisons: the top 25% of the baseline HbA1c distribution [n =
21, HbA1c > 5.05%, mean = 5.66% (SD = 0.18)] and the bottom
10% [n = 7, HbA1c < 4.92%, mean = 4.80% (SD = 0.084)].
At study baseline, the phenotype groups were similar in DXA-
derived adiposity indicators and anthropometry measurements
(Table 1). The higher HbA1c group and the group with incident
central adiposity gain weighed slightly more than the other groups at
the baseline. At study baseline, each of the phenotype groups was
near the population median on weight-for-age (range: 45th–52nd
percentile); slightly above the population median on height-for-age
(52nd–60th percentile); and thus, on average, below the population
median on BMI-for-age (38th–48th percentile).
Metabolites Predictive of Incident Central Adiposity Gain Phenotype.
Five metabolites differed between the stable adiposity and incident
central adiposity gain groups at a nominal P < 0.05 (Table 2). The
difference in one metabolite, meso-erythritol (nominal P value =
0.0004, FDR = 0.0435), reached the FDR threshold for statistical
significance, and the concentration of meso-erythritol was 13.4-fold
greater in the baseline pooled blood aliquots from participants with
incident central adiposity gain compared with pooled blood aliquots
from participants who maintained a stable adiposity phenotype. The
differences between the phenotype pools for fructose and an un-
identified metabolite were near the significance threshold after
adjusting for multiple comparisons (both nominal P = 0.006,
FDR = 0.23).
These metabolites, and several other candidate metabolites, were
analyzed further in a targeted GC-MS approach with absolute
quantification of erythritol, fructose, lactic acid, and three BCAAs
(SI Appendix, Table S1). The signal for erythritol was confirmed in a
Table 1.

 targeted GC-MS approach with absolute quantification of erythritol;
the concentration of erythritol was 14.7-fold greater [95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 13.27, 16.25] in incident central adiposity gain
pooled samples compared with pooled samples of participants with
stable adiposity [60.8 (SE = 3.1) vs. 4.1 (SE = 0.0) μmol/L; P <
0.0001]. The concentration of fructose was 2.2-fold greater in the
baseline pooled blood aliquots from participants with incident cen-
tral adiposity gain compared with the stable adiposity group [46.2
(SE = 0.9) vs. 27.8 (SE = 1.6); P = 0.022]. The concentrations of
leucine, isoleucine, and valine were higher in the incident central
adiposity gain phenotype group, but these findings did not reach
statistical significance (P = 0.76, P = 0.64, and P = 0.55, respectively).
Finally, the phenotype of incident central adiposity gain was
refined to investigate dose–response patterns for the metabolites
of interest. The concentration of meso-erythritol varied by ter-
tiles of the central adiposity score (SI Appendix, Fig. S2); the
highest meso-erythritol concentration was in the lowest central
adiposity change subgroup (n = 26), and the pattern indicated
lower meso-erythritol with greater central adiposity change.
There was no difference in the concentration of meso-erythritol
between the stable adiposity phenotype subgroups.
Metabolite Profile Associated with Higher Glycemia Phenotype. The
metabolomic profile between phenotype groups defined by higher
versus lower glycemia was compared using HbA1c concentrations
at the study baseline (Table 2), and nine metabolites had nominal P
values <0.05. The group with higher glycemia had a 22-fold greater
concentration of meso-erythritol (nominal P < 0.0001, FDR =
0.0002) and about half the concentration of fructose (nominal P =
0.0006, FDR = 0.0302) compared with the lower glycemia pheno-
type. Valine and leucine concentration differences reached the
nominal P value threshold, but not the FDR threshold, and iso-
leucine concentration differences were consistent in direction, al-
though not statistically significant (P = 0.0620, FDR = 0. 5346; SI
Appendix, Table S4).
Based on these findings, six metabolites were further analyzed
in a targeted GC-MS approach with absolute quantification of
erythritol, fructose, lactic acid, valine, leucine, and isoleucine.
The meso-erythritol concentration was 20.6-fold greater (95%
CI: 19.84, 21.41) in the higher glycemia group [105.6 (SE = 1.4)
vs. 5.1 (SE = 0.1) μmol/L; P = 0.0024]. Fructose and lactic acid
had significantly lower concentrations in the higher glycemia
group (nominal P = 0.0444 and nominal P = 0.0088, respectively;
SI Appendix, Table S2). The concentrations of the BCAAs were
higher in the higher glycemia group, but findings did not reach
the statistical significance threshold.
In a further analysis of the dose–response, both glycemia
phenotype groups were split at the median and the quantitative
assay was repeated in the four resulting pools (SI Appendix, Fig.
S2). Meso-erythritol concentrations were about the same in the
two halves of the lower glycemia group, but in the higher gly-
cemia subgroup, meso-erythritol was higher in the top 12.5% of
the baseline HbA1c distribution (HbA1c ≥ 5.64%).
Erythritol Is Synthesized from Glucose in Vivo and in Vitro. Given that
erythritol was associated with subsequent gain in central adiposity
gain and with higher HbA1c (measured concurrent with the me-
tabolite), further experiments were conducted to assess whether
erythritol interacted with metabolic pathways, whether it affected
glucose metabolism, and whether there was evidence for endoge-
nous production of erythritol. In vivo stable isotope-assisted dried
blood spot studies in three male volunteers showed evidence that
erythritol is synthesized from glucose in red blood cells after in-
gestion of [U13C]glucose (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). However, due
to low erythritol signals and, consequently, low labeled erythritol
enrichment patterns, this pathway was validated in an ex vivo blood
incubation setup. Erythronate was shown to be produced from
erythritol, and there was no evidence that glucose metabolism was
perturbed after ingestion of 50 g of erythritol. An immediate in-
crease in erythritol blood concentrations was observed, followed by
an increase of erythronate blood concentrations (Fig. 1). Erythritol
was oxidized to erythrose, which was fleeting, and then further
oxidized to erythronate. Overall, although a large portion of con-
sumed erythritol was assumed to be excreted in urine, about 5–10%
was oxidized through the pathway to erythronate.
To analyze if erythritol can be synthesized from glucose by
human metabolism, a stable isotope-based labeling strategy was
used in human blood cells. In case of an endogenous synthesis
capacity of erythritol in human (blood) cells, the production
of isotopically enriched erythritol after supplementation of a
[U13C]glucose tracer was expected. To test this hypothesis,
whole blood was incubated with [U13C]glucose, polar metabo-
lites were sampled after 120 min of incubation, and mass iso-
topomer distributions (MIDs) of erythritol were determined.
A significant increase of fully labeled erythritol was observed
after 120 min compared with the time point before adding the
Table 2.

 [U13C]glucose tracer (−5 min) (Fig. 2). In contrast to these changes,
no significant changes could be observed after incubation with
unlabeled [U12C]glucose. These results highlight that human
metabolism provides all of the biochemical capabilities required
to synthesize endogenous erythritol from glucose.
Erythritol Is Synthesized from Glucose via the Pentose Phosphate
Pathway. The biochemical pathway for the conversion of glucose
into erythritol was investigated. Erythritol is the reduced form of the
monosaccharide erythrose, which, in its phosphorylated form, is an
intermediate of the reductive pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP). For
this reason, it was proposed that glucose is phosphorylated by
hexokinase and then oxidized to gluconate-6-phosphate in the oxi-
dative branch of the PPP. After oxidative decarboxylation by
gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ribulose-5-phosphate is pro-
duced. During this step, the first carbon atom of glucose is lost as
CO2. Further conversions by transketolase and transaldolase in the
reductive part of the PPP eventually produce erythrose-4-phosphate
(E4P) (Fig. 3A). It is well known that these reactions take place in
almost all human cell types, including erythrocytes (15). The next step
is either the reduction of E4P to erythritol-4-phosphate, followed by
the action of a phosphatase to release erythritol, or the removal of
the phosphate first to release erythrose, which is then reduced to
erythritol. To validate this assumption, the labeling experiments were
repeated in whole blood, but with three [13C]glucose tracers labeled
at specific positions (Fig. 3A). In conclusion, these experiments val-
idated that human blood cells convert glucose into erythritol and,
based on the positional labeling experiments, most likely via E4P, and
thus the PPP (Fig. 3B).
Discussion
We conducted a metabolomics study to identify a metabolic
profile predictive of adverse changes in body habitus, specifically
incident gain in central adiposity, which is a phenotype with
known cardiometabolic risk (16, 17). We found consistent dif-
ferences for erythritol and fructose over several analytic steps
that indicated overall positive associations between those me-
tabolites and incident central adiposity gain in young adults. We
also found the concentration of erythritol was higher in the
group with higher glycemia compared with the group with lower
glycemia at study baseline. Conversely, fructose and lactic acid
had lower blood concentrations in the higher glycemia group.

 The concentrations of BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine, and valine)
did not differ between the central adiposity phenotype groups,
but these metabolites had higher concentrations in the higher
glycemia phenotype group. BCAAs reportedly perturb insulin
signaling (18), and experimental feeding of BCAAs, with and
without a concurrent high-fat diet, contributes to insulin re-
sistance in animal models (10).
Overall, the human and cell studies of erythritol support the
heretofore unrecognized metabolism of glucose to erythritol.
These findings are in contrast to previously published studies
that reported erythritol is not metabolized in humans (19). Hiele
et al. (19) showed that ingestion of 25 g of 13C-labeled glucose
and lactitol led to altered human metabolism; in contrast, they
reported that after ingestion of 25 g of 13C-labeled erythritol, no
alterations of the human metabolism could be observed and
erythritol was not further metabolized. We showed that there is
metabolism of erythritol to erythronate.
In the examination of subgroups of the incident central adi-
posity gain group, we compared the concentration of erythritol
across three levels of central adiposity gain, defined by the degree
of change. We observed the greatest concentration of erythritol in
the subgroup with the least degree of central adiposity change.
These data provide some evidence of a stepwise relationship
between erythritol and central adiposity gain; the inverse asso-
ciation may indicate that erythritol is associated with an overall
risk of increase in central adiposity, but not with the magnitude
of central adiposity gain. Replication of this study is needed to
verify the direction and magnitude of this association. Also, fu-
ture research characterizing specific foods or food groups that
contribute to exogenous erythritol exposure, or variation in hu-
man endogenous erythritol synthesis, could improve the under-
standing of erythritol exposure, and lead to a better understanding
of factors contributing to endogenous erythritol concentration,
increased adiposity, or both.
Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that occurs naturally in a variety of
foods (e.g., pear, watermelon), is 60–80% as sweet as sucrose,
and is an approved low-calorie sweetener food additive (20, 21).
US survey data estimate that the typical intake of erythritol is
about 1 g·d−1 (22). Erythritol is a four-carbon polyol, and up to
90% of the ingested quantity is rapidly absorbed through the gut
lumen (19), with the unabsorbed fraction possibly (23) subject to
fermentation by gut microbes (20, 22). Clinical feeding studies of
0.8–1 g of erythritol per kilogram of body weight show that ∼90%
of the dose is excreted (urine) in 24–48 h (20). In animal models,
plasma erythritol levels peak about 30–60 min postingestion,
with 99% disappearance from the plasma within 24 h (24).
Erythritol exists endogenously in human tissues, with plasma
levels of ∼9.8 μmol/L (25), and although a prior study claimed
that endogenous production of erythritol was null (19), we dem-
onstrated that erythritol is endogenously synthesized by human
metabolism in vivo. After ingestion of a [U13C]glucose tracer,
isotopically enriched erythritol was detected in the blood of the
donor. We hypothesized that at least some of the erythritol pro-
duction takes place in blood cells because, after transport by the
enterocytes, these cells are the first that are in contact with the
tracer, and the finding that these primary human blood cells can
synthesize detectable amounts of isotopic labeled erythritol after
incubation with stable isotope tracers supported this hypothesis.
Due to the determined MIDs, erythritol is most probably syn-
thesized from E4P, an intermediate of the PPP.
Although no previous studies are directly comparable to this
study, a few studies of weight gain in young adults include bio-
markers or look for predictive metabolomic profiles. Würtz et al.
(8) investigated 82 prespecified metabolites to understand the
causal effect of BMI and of adiposity change on the metabolome
in a large consortium study of 16- to 39-y-olds. They identified
causal associations of BMI change with changes in lipid-related,
inflammation-related, and BCAA metabolites. Prior research
also found an association of artificial sweeteners with both
metabolic dysfunction (26, 27) and weight gain (28–30), but these
studies were based on consumption and the conclusions are
likely to be affected by both confounding and reverse causality
(persons already gaining weight choose to consume artificially
sweetened beverages to prevent further weight gain). The bi-
ological mechanisms for the association between artificial sweet-
ener and weight gain are proposed to relate to gut microbiota
metabolism (31). Several recent studies of erythritol loading
reported no effect on glucose (32, 33), consistent with our find-
ings. A study in patients with diabetes reported that erythritol and
enrichment of another PPP biomarker (ribose) were increased in
patients with diabetic retinopathy, and suggested that polyol
pathway flux may yield biomarkers of clinical risk in diabetes (34).
We also found that a higher baseline concentration of plasma
fructose was associated with the incident central adiposity gain
phenotype. Fructose is a normal component of the human diet and
is naturally concentrated in sweet fruits, although fructose is also
extracted from beets, cane, and sucrose, and is concentrated as high-
fructose corn syrup for use as a sweetener. The possible causal link
between fructose intake and human weight gain is controversial (35),
and we could not identify any published studies that used metab-
olomics to study the association of fructose with subsequent weight
gain. We also found higher lactic acid concentrations associated with
the incident central adiposity gain phenotype, and this finding may
be driven by the fructose finding, given evidence from isotopic tracer
studies of fructose, which show that approximately one-fourth of
ingested fructose is converted to lactic acid within hours (36).
Previous studies used metabolomic approaches to construct
metabolic “fingerprints” associated with obesity, and repeatedly
show higher concentrations of BCAAs associated with obesity

 (8, 37, 38) across all age ranges and with risk for insulin re-
sistance in adolescents (37). In our study, concentrations of
BCAAs were higher in the higher glycemia phenotype group,
supporting previous studies that implicate BCAAs in long-term
glucose economy. No differences in concentration were found in
the incident central adiposity gain versus stable adiposity phe-
notype groups, suggesting that increased BCAAs in circulation
are not associated with subsequent adiposity gain.
A limitation of this work is the use of pools of plasma for all
comparisons because it is possible that a subset of the individuals
within a pool could drive the overall levels of metabolites measured
in the pool. A pooling approach was adopted because it offered a
cost-effective strategy to investigate the relation between the
metabolome and complex phenotypes in an understudied pop-
ulation. In addition, pooling is advantageous to reduce overall
variation when the biological variation between individual samples
is greater than the technical variation between replicate assays from
the same pool (39). In this study, we had information on technical
variation (pool replicates), but we had no information on biological
variability among individual samples. The FDR-corrected statistical
tests presented herein are not as robust as tests that account for
both biological and technical variation (39). However, the consis-
tency of the erythritol results in both the central adiposity and usual
glycemia comparisons lends strength to the findings, and the cluster
of metabolites has biological plausibility.
This pool-based study delivers two unique results about metab-
olite abundance related to a one-time measurement of glycemia
and longitudinal increase in central adiposity. Although the two
pools within a comparison are mutually exclusive, there is minor
overlap across two of the comparisons (12 of the 66 participants
with central adiposity gain are also in the higher baseline glycemia
group). Strengths of this work include a large sample representative
of university freshmen, longitudinal data to define the phenotype
using both anthropometry and gold-standard DXA methods, and
the use of rigorous protocols for all data collection.
In conclusion, we found a positive association between circulating
levels of erythritol at the study baseline and the incidence of central
adiposity gain in nonobese adults aged 18 y and studied over 9 mo.
Moreover, we demonstrated that erythritol is constitutively synthe-
sized in humans from glucose, most probably via E4P, which is an
intermediate of the PPP. Further research is needed to understand
the meaning of these findings, including the interplay between var-
iation in endogenous erythritol synthesis and exogenous exposure to
erythritol-containing foods. Further research to confirm these find-
ings in a new cohort and to identify metabolic profiles that predict
changes in adiposity in early adulthood present a unique opportunity
to identify novel targets for prevention, which are very important,
given the well-known difficulty of losing weight once it is gained.

Atom transitions within the PPP and erythritol labeling from glucose. (A) Erythritol (Ery) is synthesized from glucose via the PPP from glucose-6-
phosphate (G6P). First, a [1,2-13C2]glucose tracer, which contains stable isotopes at the first two positions, was used. Based on the atom transitions of the
oxidative and reductive PPP, no significant isotopic enrichment in erythritol was expected. Second, a [3,4-13C2]glucose tracer was applied; in this case, the
synthesis of M2 erythritol isotopologs was predicted. Third, a [6-13C1]glucose tracer was applied. (B) First, incubation of human blood cells with [1,2-13C2]glucose did
not produce significant amounts of enriched erythritol. Second, as expected, twofold-labeled (M2) erythritol isotopologs emerged after addition of the [1,2-13C2]
glucose tracer to the blood cells. Third, the expected appearance of onefold-labeled (M1) erythritol isotopologs was observed after the [6-13C1]glucose tracer was
applied. The amounts of [1,2-13C2]glucose (1,2-13C2 Glc) yielding nonlabeled (M0) erythritol, [3,4-13C2]glucose (3,4-13C2 Glc) yielding M2 erythritol, and [6-13C1]glucose
(6-13C1 Glc) yielding M1 erythritol are shown after incubation with the respective tracer for 120 min (**P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 by Student’s t test). F6P, fructose 6-
