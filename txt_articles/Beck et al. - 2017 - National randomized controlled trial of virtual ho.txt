 National randomized controlled trial of
virtual house calls for Parkinson disease
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether providing remote neurologic care into the homes of people with
Parkinson disease (PD) is feasible, beneficial, and valuable.
Methods: In a 1-year randomized controlled trial, we compared usual care to usual care supple-
mented by 4 virtual visits via video conferencing from a remote specialist into patients’ homes.
Primary outcome measures were feasibility, as measured by the proportion who completed at
least one virtual visit and the proportion of virtual visits completed on time; and efficacy, as
measured by the change in the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire–39, a quality of life scale.
Secondary outcomes included quality of care, caregiver burden, and time and travel savings.
Results: A total of 927 individuals indicated interest, 210 were enrolled, and 195 were randomized.
Participants had recently seen a specialist (73%) and were largely college-educated (73%) and white
(96%). Ninety-five (98% of the intervention group) completed at least one virtual visit, and 91% of
388 virtual visits were completed. Quality of life did not improve in those receiving virtual house calls
(0.3 points worse on a 100-point scale; 95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0 to 2.7 points; p 5 0.78) nor
did quality of care or caregiver burden. Each virtual house call saved patients a median of 88 minutes
(95% CI 70–120; p , 0.0001) and 38 miles per visit (95% CI 36–56; p , 0.0001).
Conclusions: Providing remote neurologic care directly into the homes of people with PD was fea-
sible and was neither more nor less efficacious than usual in-person care. Virtual house calls gen-
erated great interest and provided substantial convenience.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02038959.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with PD, virtual
house calls from a neurologist are feasible and do not significantly change quality of life compared
to in-person visits. The study is rated Class III because it was not possible to mask patients to visit
type. Neurology® 2017;89:1152–1161

Telehealth’s promise and prevalence are increasing despite its limited evidence base.1 In 2001, the
Institute of Medicine stated “The Internet has enormous potential to transform health care . Many
of these applications are currently within reach, including remote consultations in the home.”2 The
“virtual house call”3 is now emerging to bring care to patients rather than patients to care.

 While virtual house calls are increasingly
common for episodic conditions,4,5 limited
evidence supports their application to chronic
conditions. A literature review of 141 studies
of telehealth for chronic conditions6 identified
just 16 that evaluated video conferencing
between physician and patient. Only 6—
almost all single-center, short, and small—
evaluated
physicians
video
conferencing
directly into patients’ homes.7
Parkinson disease (PD) is an archetypal
chronic condition that increases in incidence
with age,8 progressively disables those affected,
impairs driving ability,9 burdens caregivers,7
increases health care costs, and benefits from
specialized care.10–13 However, over 40% of
people with PD never receive care from a neu-
rologist. These people are more likely to have
increased morbidity, loss of independence,
and premature mortality.11,12,14
Pilot efforts have suggested that virtual
house calls are feasible, valuable to patients,
and have similar clinical outcomes to in-
person care in PD.15–19 We therefore con-
ducted a national randomized controlled study
of virtual house calls to determine whether this
model of specialty care delivery is feasible,
valuable, and beneficial.
METHODS Trial design. As previously described,7,20 we
conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial investigat-
ing whether providing remote neurologic care into the homes of
people with PD is feasible, beneficial, and valuable (Level III
evidence). We compared usual care provided by local physicians
to usual care augmented by 4 virtual visits from a remote
neurologist. Individuals were randomized 1:1 to either receive
virtual visits from a specialist located at one of 18 sites or
continue their usual care. The study’s biostatistician (C.A.B.)
generated the randomization allocation sequence using R ver-
sion 3.0.2. Randomization was concealed from sites, stratified
by enrolling site, contained a block size of 4, and occurred after
a baseline visit with a blinded rater. After randomization, nei-
ther participants nor site investigators were masked to treatment
assignment.
The study evaluated (1) the feasibility of virtual house calls;
(2) their effect on quality of life; (3) their effect on quality of care;
and (4) their ability to save time, reduce caregiver burden, and
cut travel.20
This study is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02038959).
Study participants. Eligible participants had a clinical diag-
nosis of PD; had a private, Internet-enabled device; and lived
in a state where a site investigator was licensed to practice.
Individuals who were currently hospitalized, had a condition
(e.g., prominent psychosis) that would preclude study partic-
ipation in the judgment of the site investigator, or were cur-
rently enrolled in another telemedicine study were excluded
from the study. Participants’ caregivers were also invited to
participate.
Study procedures. All study activities were conducted
remotely. The National Parkinson Foundation, PatientsLi-
keMe (a patient social networking site), and Michael J. Fox
Foundation’s Fox Trial Finder’s electronic outreach com-
prised the primary recruitment method. The National
Parkinson Foundation also hosted a national helpline for
study-related information.20
Interested individuals were pointed to a 1-page website where
they could reach out to the coordinating center through an online
form. The coordinating center directed these individuals to an
appropriate site. Site coordinators then sent eligible individuals
a consent form and reviewed it with them by phone. Upon enroll-
ing, participants were sent an e-mail link to Health Insurance Por-
tability and Accountability Act–compliant video conferencing
software developed by SBR Health (Cambridge, MA), which
downloads video conferencing software from Vidyo (Hackensack,
NJ) and is hosted by ID Solutions (Indianapolis, IN).20 Partic-
ipants who did not have a web-enabled camera were mailed one
(Creative Labs Live! Cam Chat HD camera; Creative Technol-
ogy, Ltd., Singapore).20 Technological support was provided by
study coordinators by phone.
Intervention. Individuals randomized to the intervention
received up to 4 virtual visits over 12 months from a neurologist.
The patient and physician determined the specific content and
frequency of each visit, but the format generally included a med-
ical history; a PD-specific examination, including assessment of
tremor and gait15; time to address patients’ concerns; and rec-
ommendations. Due to differences in state laws governing the
remote prescription of medication,21 recommendations were
mailed to the patient and his or her usual clinician. Individuals
randomized to the control group had the option to receive one
virtual visit after the study’s conclusion.20
Outcomes. Feasibility, as defined by the proportion of people
who completed at least one virtual visit and the proportion of vir-
tual visits completed as scheduled; and efficacy, as defined by the
12-month change in the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire–39
(PDQ-39), comprised the primary outcomes.20
Quality of care, as quantified by 12-month change in the
Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care, time and travel sav-
ings, and 12-month change in caregiver burden as quantified
by the Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index, comprised the
secondary outcomes.20
Additional secondary outcomes included the 12-month
change in the Movement Disorder Society–sponsored revision
of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale22 score as assessed
by the independent rater. The motor portion (part III) of the scale
was modified to exclude assessments of rigidity and balance,
which cannot be assessed remotely.23 Additional assessments
included changes in the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, the
Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the European Quality of Life
Five Dimension Five Level Scale, and the Patient Global Impres-
sion of Change. Patient and clinician satisfaction, as well as hos-
pitalizations and emergency department visits, were evaluated by
survey after each visit. The relative preference for virtual visits vs
in-person care was assessed after the last virtual visit. Deaths,
breaches of confidentiality, and safety concerns were reported
by study sites to the study’s principal investigator.
Statistical analysis. Primary measures of feasibility were sum-
marized using descriptive statistics. Virtual house calls were
considered feasible if 80% of participants in the intervention

 arm completed at least one visit and if at least 80% of virtual
visits were completed as scheduled. For the primary efficacy
measure, we used an intention-to-treat analysis and fit an
analysis of covariance model with the 12-month change in the
PDQ-39 as the response, treatment group as the factor of
interest, participating specialist as a stratification factor, and
baseline score as a covariate. A t test was performed to compare
the adjusted treatment
group means.7 The interaction
between treatment group and baseline score was also tested for
significance. The robustness of the analysis to model as-
sumptions was assessed using residual diagnostics and reme-
dial measures. Sensitivity of the analysis to the exclusion of
missing data was evaluated by imputing missing data using
Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations.24 Missing indi-
vidual items on the PDQ-39 were imputed based on the
nonmissing items at both baseline and 12 months using pre-
dictive mean matching. Secondary measures of quality of life,
clinical benefit, quality of care, and value to patients and care
partners were analyzed similarly.7 Baseline characteristics were
compared between treatment groups using Fisher exact test
for nominal data and the exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test for
ordinal and continuous data. Measures of value, satisfaction,
and global impression of change were analyzed similarly. All
statistical tests were performed with a 2-sided significance
level of 5%, and no correction was made for multiple
comparisons.
Sample size. A sample size of 200 participants was selected to
ensure adequate power (80%–90%) to detect a modest effect size
on the PDQ-39 (Cohen d of 0.5) using a 2-sided t test at a sig-
nificance level of 5% and allowing for anticipated dropout rate of
up to 20%.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The institutional review boards of the University of
Rochester (coordinating center) and the sites approved the study.
All participants provided written informed consent.

 RESULTS Study population. A total of 11,734 indi-
viduals from all 50 states and 80 countries visited
the study’s website over 6 months of recruitment. A
total of 1,704 (15%) continued to the online interest
form, and 927 (8%) completed it (figure 1).20 Out-
reach efforts through the National Parkinson Foun-
dation reached the most people (n 5 339), followed
by PatientsLikeMe (n 5 204) and Fox Trial Finder
(n 5 132).20 A total of 272 individuals were directed
to enrolling sites, 210 were enrolled, and 195 were
randomized.20 Study participants were mostly white
(96%), college-educated (73%), and on average 66
years old. Fifteen participants withdrew before ran-
domization, primarily due to technical reasons (e.g.,
incompatible computer) and losses to follow-up
(figure 1).20 Participants who withdrew had similar
baseline characteristics to participants who were ran-
domized. Participants were familiar with the Internet
and e-mail (96%) and half had previously conducted
a video call. Baseline access (73% had seen a PD
specialist in the prior year) and satisfaction with care
(83% satisfied or very satisfied) were very high (table 1).
Most participating caregivers were also white
(79%) and college-educated (56%) (table e-1 at
Neurology.org).20
Primary outcome measures. Ninety-five (98%) of the
97 individuals randomized to the intervention arm
completed at least one virtual visit, and 91% of the
388 virtual visits were completed as scheduled.
Excluding one outlier (277 visits) in the intervention
group, the number of visits to the local clinician was
similar between the 2 groups (2.5 in-person visits in
the virtual visit group and 3.0 in-person visits in the
usual care group; p 5 0.14). As shown in table 2, the
change in quality in life as measured by the PDQ-39
did not differ between the 2 groups (0.3 points worse
on a 100-point scale; 95% confidence interval [CI]
22.0 to 2.7 points; p 5 0.78).
Secondary outcomes. Patient assessment of quality of
care improved from baseline by 0.3 points (95% CI
0.1–0.5; p 5 0.01) in those randomized to virtual
visits and 0.3 points (95% CI 0.1–0.4; p 5 0.02) in
those randomized to usual care, and the change did
not differ between the 2 groups. Compared to usual
in-person care, virtual visits saved patients time
(median of 88 minutes per visit [95% CI 70–120;
p , 0.0001]) and travel (median of 38 miles round-trip
per visit [95% CI 36–56; p , 0.0001]). The change
in caregiver burden did not differ between groups
(table 2).
Additional clinical outcomes. The change in clinical
outcomes did not differ between the 2 groups
(table 2). However, as shown in figure e-1, the
patient global impression of change as rated by
the study participants was better in those random-
ized to receive virtual house calls (50% vs 32%

 randomized to the control group reported feeling at
least “a little better”; p 5 0.002). The frequency of
hospital visits or emergency room use did not change.
On average, data were missing for 10% of all par-
ticipants (range 7%–19%) and did not differ by
group. In most cases, missing items were 1–2 re-
sponses to the PDQ-39. Sensitivity analyses assessing
the effect of missing data and deviations from the
underlying model assumptions were consistent with
the analyses presented in table 2.
Patient and physician satisfaction. As shown in figure 2,
97% of patients and 86% of physicians were satisfied
or very satisfied with virtual visits.
Patient preference. At the study’s end, participants pre-
ferred virtual visits with their remote specialist to their
usual in-person PD clinician on all aspects measured
(figure 3). Overall, participants preferred virtual visits
over in-person visits. (55% vs 18%; p , 0.0001).
Safety. No deaths, harm (e.g., privacy breaches), or
safety issues (e.g., falls during remote examination)
were identified during the course of the study.
DISCUSSION As demonstrated in this national
study, providing remote neurologic care to individu-
als with PD directly into their homes is feasible. The
proportion of visits completed (over 90%) is in line
with the proportion of in-person clinic visits com-
pleted in an earlier pilot study16 and on par with, if
not better than, many published studies of no-show
rates for traditional in-person clinic appointments.25
The absence of improvement in quality of life
from the addition of virtual visits in this study could
be due to several factors, including the possibility that
virtual visits with a specialist are insufficient to
improve quality of life. Additional possibilities
include the very high proportion of individuals who
were already receiving care from a PD specialist at

 baseline, the high satisfaction with that care at base-
line, the required reliance (due to state licensing
laws) on local clinicians to implement the special-
ist’s recommendations, and the choice of measure
used (the patients’ global impression of change was
significantly favorable for those receiving virtual
visits).
Beyond the primary efficacy outcome measure,26
the secondary outcomes highlight the care model’s
benefits and are consistent with most of the Institute
of Medicine’s recommendations for improving
care.2 In addition to their likely comparable efficacy
to in-person care, virtual house calls save time—
a median of 88 minutes and an average of 169 mi-
nutes of time per visit. In addition, virtual house
calls are efficient and eliminated approximately
35,000 miles of travel and reduce the need for park-
ing lots, waiting rooms, and clinic space. Virtual
house calls are also safe, with no safety issues arising
during the study, and are patient-centered. The vis-
its provide most patients the care that they prefer,
the convenience that they need, and the comfort
that they value.18
However, like current care12,27 and many clinical
trials,28 study participation was not equitable. Fueled
by online recruitment, the study participants reflected
the digital divide, the differential access to the Inter-
net and related technologies due to social and geo-
graphic
factors.29
While
the
study
enrolled
participants as old as 84 years of age and over half
came from counties with limited access to neurologic
care, study participants were largely white, well-
educated, and more familiar with the Internet than
the general population.30 The study results thus may
not be generalizable to the broader community of
individuals with PD.
Additional limitations included the target popula-
tion, intervention, availability of data, and scope of anal-
ysis. First, this study excluded individuals with PD who
reside in nursing homes, who account for nearly 25% of
all Medicare beneficiaries with PD,13 frequently have
limited access to neurologic care,15 and benefit from
virtual visits. Other underserved populations (e.g., rural)
who have less access to care may stand more to benefit.
Second, the intervention was limited to care from a neu-
rologist, whereas PD, like many chronic conditions,
benefits from multidisciplinary care.31 In addition, while
studies have generally demonstrated that remote and in-
person motor examinations are comparable,15 assessing
gait remotely can be difficult due to the technology,
limited camera view, and absence of trained clinicians.
Third, this study had some missing data, which did not
appear to affect results, and a lower response rate for
some survey questions, which provides the potential for
response bias. For example, nonresponders may have
rated virtual house calls less favorably than responders,
who nonetheless accounted for 70% of responses.
Fourth, this study had limited consideration of
costs. Utilization of emergency rooms and hospital-
izations was low in both groups before and during
the study. One general concern with telehealth is
that it will lead to more physician visits,32 and those
in the intervention group had more total physician
visits than those in the control group. However,
physician visits are inexpensive relative to institu-
tional care, and more frequent visits to a neurologist
for PD are associated with fewer hospitalizations
and lower overall health expenditures.13

 Future efforts can address these study limitations.
Dedicated outreach to underserved populations,
including those with advanced disease and from
underserved demographic groups, especially women,
rural residents, minorities, homebound, or those in
assisted living facilities, will help determine if the re-
sults are more generalizable and whether the benefits
are potentially greater for those with historically less
access to care. Incorporation of multidisciplinary care
to address comorbid conditions (e.g., depression)
could
provide
additional
value
when
remotely
brought into the home or in combination with tradi-
tional clinic appointments and in-person home visits.
Future studies could also include rigorous economic
assessments, perhaps by focusing on individuals with
high current costs or those at risk for hip fractures,
psychosis, or nursing home placement. Such assess-
ments should include the economic benefits to pa-
tients
and
caregivers,
which
are
frequently
discounted.33 Finally, the generalizability of these re-
sults can be assessed through investigations in other
conditions associated with aging (e.g., Alzheimer dis-
ease),11 reduced mobility (e.g., amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis), or limited specialty access (e.g., Duchenne
muscular dystrophy).34
This study also provides guidance to address pol-
icy barriers that prevent broader implementation of
telehealth.1 One large barrier is Medicare’s sparse cov-
erage of telehealth, which in 2015 amounted to less
than 0.01% of its budget.35 Extending Medicare’s
telehealth coverage to the home and to all beneficia-
ries regardless of geography would mirror other fed-
eral (e.g., Veterans’ Administration)36 and private
(e.g., Kaiser Permanente of Northern California)37
payers. Another policy barrier is that patients can only
receive care from physicians licensed in their state.
Interest in this study was immense nationally, and
the primary reason individuals could not participate
was their location in a state where none of the par-
ticipating physicians was licensed. Policies, such as
the Tele-MED Act,38 which would enable any Medi-
care beneficiaries to receive care from any licensed
Medicare provider, or timely and efficient implemen-
tation of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact,39
which would facilitate licensure of physicians in mul-
tiple states, could help address this barrier. Finally,
some states require that any care provided via tele-
health be preceded by in-person care,21 but in this
study almost all participants were seen remotely by
specialists they had never physically met without inci-
dent and with great satisfaction. Where these barriers
are not present, either outside the United States (e.g.,
Canada) or inside the United States (e.g., Veterans’
Administration), telehealth is flourishing.
This study funded by the Patient-Centered Out-
comes Research Institute rigorously evaluates an
important and growing model of care. The remote
delivery of specialty care to individuals with PD
directly in their homes is feasible, and while their
addition did not improve (or hinder) quality of life
in this study, their convenience and comfort warrant
further investigation and implementation. Virtual
house calls address the Institute of Medicine’s vision
for high-quality health care and were found to be
timely, efficient, and patient-centered. Future efforts
must address the digital divide and policy barriers to
ensure that this new care model can address inequi-
ties in access to care.
