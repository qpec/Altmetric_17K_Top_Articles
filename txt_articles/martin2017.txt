Morbid Obesity and Total Knee
Arthroplasty: A Growing Problem
Abstract
Obesity is an epidemic, with approximately 35% of the US population
affected. This rate is unlikely to decline and may increase the demand
for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Data regarding the risks, benefits,
and potential complications of TKA in this patient population are
conflicting. Preoperative considerations are optimization of nutritional
status, safe weight loss strategies, and bariatric surgery.
Intraoperative concerns unique to this population include inadequate
exposure, implant alignment, and durable implant fixation;
postoperative issues include tibial loosening, wound complications,
cardiovascular events, and respiratory complications. A thorough
understanding of the medical and surgical complications associated
with TKA in the obese patient will facilitate research efforts and
improve outcomes.
O
besity is prevalent in the United
States, affecting approximately
35% of the adult population.1 Obe-
sity is generally defined as a body
mass index (BMI) of $30 kg/m2,
although the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) uses three categories:
class I, 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2; class II,
35.0 to 39.9 kg/m2; and class III,
$40.0 kg/m2. Use of BMI versus
percentage of body fat to determine
weight status is controversial.2 Per-
centage of body fat may be a better
representation because it measures
adipose tissue more accurately than
does BMI.
Regardless of the criterion used,
obesity can substantially alter the
results
of
total
knee
arthroplasty
(TKA).3
Obesity
disproportionately
affects knees more than hips, leading
to an unequal increase in the number
of primary TKAs performed relative to
the number of total hip arthroplasties.4
The
demographics
of
patients
undergoing TKA have also changed
drastically over the last few decades.
For example, the average BMI of
patients undergoing the procedure
has increased incrementally during
thattime.5 In addition, a recent study
showed that obese patients required
TKA at a younger age than did
patients of normal weight.6 As a
result of these changes, research on
the obese TKA patient has also
intensified. Most of these studies
have retrospectively identified adverse
outcomes associated with obesity,
with very few prospective studies
pinpointing methods for optimizing
TKA in the obese patient.
Preoperative
Considerations
Medical Comorbidities
Obese patients often have multiple
medical comorbidities, such as dia-
betes mellitus and cardiopulmonary
disease, which can negatively affect
the results of TKA. The Mayo Clinic

independent risk factor in obese

 patients undergoing the procedure.7
Three cohorts of morbidly obese
patients (ie, WHO class III) were
evaluated: patients without diabetes
(n = 1,284), patients with type 2
diabetes who did not require insulin
(n = 530), and patients with type 2
diabetes who required insulin (n =
164). The insulin-dependent cohort
had increased risks of reoperation
(P = 0.005), revision (P = 0.02), and
periprosthetic joint infection (P =
0.03), as well as decreased 10-year
implant
survivorship
(P
=
0.01)
compared
with
the
nondiabetic
cohort.
However,
no
statistically
significant differences were noted in
outcomes between the non–insulin-
dependent type 2 diabetic and non-
diabetic cohorts.
Obesity, diabetes, and metabolic
syndrome (ie, central obesity, hyper-
tension,
glucose
intolerance,
and
hypercholesterolemia) are also closely
related. Patients with metabolic syn-
drome undergoing primary total joint
arthroplasty had a statistically signif-
icant increase in perioperative com-
plications, with an elevated BMI
being the greatest risk factor of the
comorbid features of this syndrome
(P = 0.0028).8
Nutrition
Contrary to perceptions, a large per-
centage of obese patients are mal-
nourished. When evaluating patients
for
malnutrition,
we
commonly
screen
for
the
following
values:
albumin
,3.5
g/dL;
transferrin
,200 mg/dL; and total lymphocyte
count ,1,500/mm3. A recent study
involving
58
obese
patients
(ie,
WHO class III) who were scheduled
to undergo bariatric surgery found
substantial nutritional deficiencies in
vitamin D (92.9%) and iron (36.2%
to 56.9%).9 In addition, 15.6% of
patients
who
underwent
a
pre-
operative evaluation before gastric
bypass surgery were diagnosed as
having hypoalbuminemia.
Nelson et al10 used the National
Surgical Quality Improvement Pro-
gram database to analyze a cohort of
77,785
patients
who
underwent
TKA. They divided the cohort ac-
cording to BMI and preoperative
albumin level. A multivariate analy-
sis determined that morbid obesity
(ie, WHO class III) was not inde-
pendently
associated
with
most
complications.
However,
morbid
obesity was directly associated with
renal insufficiency, superficial surgi-
cal site infection, and sepsis. Inter-
estingly, a low serum albumin level
(ie, ,3.5 mg/dL) was associated with
increased mortality as well as several
other perioperative complications.
Given demonstrated nutritive defi-
ciencies in obese patients, a thorough
preoperative nutritional workup is
advocated to medically optimize their
status before TKA. It appears that
some major complications associated
with obesity are confounded by con-
comitant
nutritional
deficiencies.
Further research is needed to deter-
mine whether preoperative optimi-
zation
of
nutrition
decreases
postoperative morbidity in the obese
population.
Weight Loss
We encourage weight loss in obese
patients (ie, WHO classes II and III)
before TKA. We typically advocate
diet and exercise and, if necessary,
refer patients to an appropriate spe-
cialist to facilitate these goals. How-
ever, data on the outcomes of patients
who have significant weight loss
preceding TKA are limited. One
study examined a patient cohort
undergoing 10,718 TKAs to deter-
mine the effect of meaningful weight
loss (ie, a 5% decrease in body
weight) on surgical site infection
and
postoperative
hospital
read-
mission.11 Approximately 12.4% of
TKA patients had meaningful weight
loss within the year before surgery.
There was no statistically significant
difference in surgical site infection or
readmission rate in the weight loss
cohort. However, the authors were
unable to correlate this finding with
the nutritional status of the patients
in each cohort. This is an important
consideration because patients par-
taking in a hypocaloric diet are most
likely in a catabolic state.12 These
patients may be at risk for poor
wound healing and infection, the
same complications seen in obese
patients.
Bariatric Surgery
Bariatric surgery is often performed
in obese patients to reliably facilitate
weight loss.13 Werner et al14 evalu-
ated three large cohorts 90 days after
TKA:
nonobese
patients
(n
=
66,523), morbidly obese patients (ie,
WHO class III) who did not undergo
bariatric surgery (n = 11,294), and
morbidly obese patients (ie, WHO
class III) who underwent bariatric
surgery before TKA (n = 219). The
authors found reduced rates of both
major
complications
(odds
ratio
[OR], 0.45; P = 0.001) and minor
complications (OR, 0.61; P = 0.01)
in the bariatric cohort compared
with the morbidly obese cohort who
did not undergo bariatric surgery.
It is difficult to infer a direct rela-
tionship between obesity and out-
comes secondary to bariatric surgery
because of the lack of a matched
cohort controlling for many of the
comorbidities. Nevertheless, others
have noted either no difference or
worse outcomes in patients who
underwent bariatric surgery before
TKA.15,16 Martin et al17 identified a
cohort of 91 patients who
had
undergone bariatric surgery before
TKA (mean BMI before bariatric
surgery, 51.1 kg/m2; mean BMI at
the time of TKA, 37.3 kg/m2). This
cohort was then matched with two
groups that did not undergo bariatric
surgery
before
TKA:

 pre-bariatric BMI of 51 kg/m2 before
TKA (1:1 match; n = 91) and a
cohort
matched
to
the
bariatric
cohorts post-bariatric BMI of 37
kg/m2 before TKA (1:2 match; n =
182). The bariatric cohort had a
higher risk of reoperation (hazards
ratio [HR], 2.6; P = 0.02) than did
the high BMI control cohort, and
higher risk of reoperation (HR, 2.4;
P = 0.2) and revision (HR, 2.2; P =
0.04) than did the lower BMI cohort.
One possible explanation for worse
outcomes in bariatric patients under-
going TKA is concomitant malnutri-
tion in this population;9 patients may
remain in a catabolic state for 2 years
following these procedures.18
Intraoperative
Considerations
Exposure
The distribution of increased soft-
tissue mass in obese patients under-
going TKA can be important. Lozano
et al19 measured limb length versus
suprapatellar and infrapatellar limb
girths in a group of TKA candidates
with a BMI $35 kg/m2 (ie, WHO
classes II and III). They observed that
BMI was not associated with tour-
niquet time, whereas a short limb
with increased suprapatellar girth
(ie, a short, stocky limb) increased
tourniquet time and surgical com-
plexity. According to In et al,20
exposure often takes longer in this
patient population, and the patella
can be difficult to subluxate or evert.
In their study, high girth was a sig-
nificant risk factor for inability to
evert the patella; the risk was 27.2
greater when thigh girth was .55 cm.
In contrast, a more recent study
reported no difficulty in everting the
patella in obese patients undergoing
TKA.21 The average surgical time was
approximately 90 minutes in this
cohort. The prolonged surgical time
and a 2% intraoperative complication
rate were most likely the result of
inadequate visualization related to
difficulty obtaining exposure.
We advocate a standard medial par-
apatellar arthrotomy in obese patients.
Minimally invasive approaches may
substantially increase surgical times
and cause injury to the extensor
mechanism, collateral ligaments, or
cutaneous blood supply. Regardless
of
approach,
however,
adequate
visualization is key to decreasing in-
traoperative and postoperative com-
plications in this patient population.
Alignment
Obtaining appropriate alignment can
be challenging in the obese patient
because of adipose tissue obstructing
bony landmarks, limited visualiza-
tion, and decreased flexion secondary
to soft-tissue constraints. For this
reason, some surgeons advocate the
use of computer navigation.22 Kamat
et al22 retrospectively studied 287
TKAs, 133 with computer-assisted
alignment
and
154
with
non-
navigated
alignment.
Approxi-
mately half of the patients were
obese (ie, WHO class I). Alignment
was better and surgical times were
faster in the computer alignment
cohort than in the standard align-
ment cohort.
Awareness
of
the
difficulty
of
identifying bony landmarks and the
potential for malalignment of a TKA
are important when treating this
patient population. Thus, we have a
low threshold for the use of computer
navigation in these patients.
Fixation
Component fixation is a potential
concern when planning TKA in an
obese patient. From a biomechanical
perspective, increasing patient weight
proportionally
raises
the
stress
transmitted to the fixation interface.
In one study, patients with a BMI $35
kg/m2 had increased risk of tibial
component loosening.23 Additional
fixation should
be
considered in
obese patients to potentially decrease
the risk of aseptic tibial loosening.
However, reports are conflicting on
the effects of obesity on implant
survivorship and, more specifically,
aseptic loosening. Cherian et al24
performed a literature review and
identified five TKA studies involving
288 patients with a BMI $30 kg/m2.
No statistically significant increase in
aseptic loosening was found in these
patients
(OR,
2.28;
P
=
0.22),
although the study may have been
underpowered to identify a statisti-
cally significant difference.
We are unaware of any literature
on femoral or patellar component
loosening, but loosening may be a
concern, as well. We believe the use of
stemmed
implants
may
promote
improved fixation and may decrease
stresses on the tibial base plate.
Blood Loss
Hrnack et al25 evaluated a cohort of
patients
with
varying
BMIs
(ie,
WHO classes I2III) undergoing 94
primary
TKAs
to
determine
the
effect on surgical blood loss. They
performed a regression analysis and
were unable to correlate obesity with
increased blood loss. However, sur-
gical time did correlate with the
amount of blood loss. This study
may have been underpowered to
identify a difference in perioperative
blood loss. In addition, evaluation of
perioperative hemoglobin values and
perioperative
fluid
management
would have been beneficial given the
inherent inaccuracies of estimated
intraoperative blood loss. To our
knowledge, no studies on tranexa-
mic acid and blood loss have been
conducted in the obese population.
Anesthesia Considerations
Ventilation can be problematic in
obese patients given their propensity
for
restrictive
lung
disease
from
decreased airway compliance and

 increased incidence of concomitant
sleep apnea. Restrictive lung disease
can lead to a ventilation-perfusion
mismatch and subsequent shunting
of blood. The resulting increase in
PCO2 and decrease in PO2 is known as
Pickwickian syndrome.
A recent study evaluated 26 obese
patientsscheduledtoundergobariatric
surgery.26 Patients were randomly
assigned
to
one
of
three
intra-
operative positions to determine the
effect of each on oxygen saturation:
30� reverse Trendelenburg, supine
horizontal, and 30� back up Fowler
position.
Of
the
three
groups,
patients in the reverse Trendelenburg
position had the lowest change in
oxygen saturation at the time of
intubation as well as the shortest
recovery to baseline oxygen satura-
tion level. Reverse Trendelenburg
positioning can be easily incorpo-
rated into TKA to optimize ventila-
tion in obese patients.
In addition, some anesthesiologists
have advocated the use of peripheral
blocks and/or spinal anesthetics to
avoid many cardiopulmonary and
systemic opioid complications asso-
ciated
with
general
anesthesia.27
These authors noted that although
regional blocks can be more difficult
to perform in obese patients, the
blocks can be optimized with ultra-
sonographic guidance.
Postoperative
Considerations
Body Mass Index
Multiple studies have shown that out-
comes after TKA were worse in obese
patients
than
in
nonobese
patients.3,23,28 As BMI level rises into
morbidly and super-obese categories,
complication rates also climb.29 The
super-obese (ie, BMI .50 kg/m2) had
a statistically significant increase in
both medical (P , 0.0001) and sur-
gical complications (P , 0.0001).
Furthermore, Wagner et al30 recently
evaluated BMI as a continuous vari-
able in a series of 21,361 consecutive
TKAs. BMI was significantly associ-
ated with increased rates of reopera-
tion (P , 0.001) and revision surgery
(P , 0.002). In addition, they found a
statistically significant increase in the
incidence of wound infections (HR,
1.08; P , 0.001) and deep infections
(HR, 1.08; P , 0.001). Of note, the
risk of most complications increased at
a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2 and
continued to increase with rising BMI
level.
Medical Complications
Thromboembolic Events
Obese patients are considered suscep-
tible to thrombosis after TKA. A study
of 32,485 patients undergoing TKAs
examined the impact of obesity (ie,
WHO classes I–III) on deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
embolism (PE).31 The risk of DVT/PE
increased significantly in the obese
population (from 2.0% to 3.3%;
adjusted P , 0.01). Despite this find-
ing, the authors noted that the absolute
risk was low. Another study of more
than 12,000 patients found no statis-
tically significant difference in rates of
asymptomatic DVT (P = 0.9475),
symptomatic DVT (P = 0.4260), and
symptomatic PE (P = 0.9275) in
patients with a BMI $40 kg/m2 versus
those with a lower BMI.32
Studies evaluating anticoagulation
modalities are needed to provide a
definitive recommendation on pre-
venting
DVT/PE
risks.
Although
rates of DVT/PE may be increasing,
adjustments in the anticoagulation
regimen may be unnecessary, given
the low absolute risk. The shift to
spinal and regional blocks by many
physicians over the past decade may
further decrease this risk.
Cardiovascular Events
Obese patients often have comorbid
conditions that increase their risk of
perioperative
complications.33
A
review of Danish registries revealed a
U-shaped distribution of ischemic
stroke, acute myocardial infarction,
and/or cardiovascular death based
on BMI (ie, WHO classes I–III) at
the time of primary total hip or knee
arthroplasty.34 The U-shaped curve
demonstrates
that
patients
with
the highest and lowest BMIs are
increasingly at risk for perioper-
ative cardiovascular complications.
Once again, no direct conclusion
can be drawn from this study; how-
ever, patient status should be properly
optimized preoperatively and care-
fully monitored postoperatively to
avoid cardiovascular complications.
Respiratory Complications
Respiratory complications, including
respiratory tract and lung infections,
are more common in obese patients
than in nonobese patientsundergoing
TKA. In their study, Friedman et al32
categorized patients according to
BMI: 24.3% with a BMI ,25 kg/m2;
39.8% with a BMI from 25 to 29
kg/m2; 32.3% with a BMI from 30 to
39 kg/m2; and 3.6% with a BMI
$40 kg/m2. Patients with a BMI
$40 kg/m2 had a statistically sig-
nificant increase in respiratory tract
and lung infections compared with
the pooled cohort of patients with a
BMI ,40 kg/m2 (P = 0.0391). The
authors did not speculate on the
reason for this finding. It is likely
multifactorial, given that this patient
population has a higher incidence of
medical
comorbidities,
nutritional
deficiencies, and increased immobil-
ity than does the nonobese patient
population.
Surgical Complications
Infection
In a prospective study of 1,214 con-
secutive patients undergoing TKA,
Dowsey and Choong35 noted an
overall infection rate of 1.5% (n =
18). The deep prosthetic infection

 rate in the morbidly obese cohort (ie,
WHO classes I–III) was significantly
greater than the rate in the nonobese
cohort (OR, 8.96; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.59 to 50.63). Several
recent studies have shown similar
results.36,37
Interestingly, not only is obesity
associated with an increased risk of
periprosthetic infection, but two-
staged reimplantation is also more
likely to fail in obese patients treated
for
infection
than
in
nonobese
patients.38 Watts et al38 retrospec-
tively
evaluated
morbidly
obese
patients (ie, BMI $40 kg/m2) who
underwent a two-stage revision for
infection. This cohort was matched
2:1 to a control group of nonobese
patients who underwent a two-stage
revision for infection. The morbidly
obese cohort had statistically signif-
icant increased risks for revision
surgery (32% compared with 11%;
P , 0.01), reinfection (22% com-
pared with 4%; P , 0.01), and re-
operation
(51%
compared
with
16%; P , 0.01). Currently, no study
has evaluated methods for decreas-
ing the infection rates in the obese
population;
however,
the
pre-
operative, intraoperative, and post-
operative modes of medical and
surgical optimization discussed pre-
viously should be employed.
Implant Survivorship
Multiple studies have shown worse
implant survivorship in the obese
TKA population.23,39 As previously
discussed, Abdel et al23 reported that
patients with a BMI $35 kg/m2 had
a significantly increased risk of tibial
loosening (P , 0.05). In addition,
multiple studies have shown a sta-
tistically higher risk of revision for
deep infection.28,38 To date, no study
has specifically evaluated modalities
to
improve
implant
survivorship,
although
stemmed
implants
have
been recommended to prevent aseptic
tibial
loosening.
Methods
for
decreasing the risk of deep infection in
obese patients warrant further inves-
tigation. Eliminating or substantially
decreasing the risk of aseptic and
septic loosening would most likely
increase implant survivorship.
Interestingly, the implant survival
rate is even lower in obese patients
who undergo revision for aseptic
loosening.40 In a recent retrospective
study of patients who underwent
revision TKA for aseptic loosening,
patients with a BMI $40 kg/m2 who
underwent
120
revisions
were
matched 1:1 with nonobese patients
on the basis of sex, age, and date of
surgery.40 The implant survival rate
was significantly lower at 10 years in
the morbidly obese cohort than in
the nonobese cohort (81% versus
93%, respectively; P = 0.02). Obese
patients should be counseled at the
time of primary and revision surgery
that the rate of implant survival is
reduced in their population.
Wound Healing
Wound healing is a common concern
in obese patients undergoing TKA.
Often, there is substantial adipose
tissue between the skin and the
extensor mechanism. Fluid can col-
lect in this space at the time of closure,
which may complicate wound heal-
ing in this population. One study
evaluated 50 primary TKAs per-
formed in 40 obese patients(ie, WHO
class III) and compared the results
with those of 1,768 TKAs in non-
obese patients performed during the
same period by one surgeon.41 The
risk of perioperative complications
was significantly increased in the
obese population (P , 0.00005).
Specifically,
wound
complications
were observed in 22% of knees in the
obese patients compared with 2% of
knees in the comparison group. The
authors recommended altering the
wound closure to limit complica-
tions. In addition, we typically apply
negative-pressure
wound
vacuum
therapy in at-risk areas. Specifically,
attempts should be made to eliminate
dead space between the arthrotomy
and the skin layers. This space allows
fluid to collect, which may place
additional pressure on the skin clo-
sure,
thereby
increasing
wound
complications.
Costs
The previously noted increased com-
plication and revision rates and the
time required to perform a TKA in
obese patients may contribute to
increased healthcare expenditures in
this patient population. At the Mayo
Clinic, Kremers et al42 evaluated
length of stay and direct medical
costs in obese patients undergoing
TKA and reported that costs were
lowest for patients in the normal and
overweight BMI categories; there
was a statistically significant increase
in costs in the obese patient pop-
ulation. For every 5-kg/m2 elevation
in BMI above 30 kg/m2, there was an
increase of approximately $250 to
$300 in hospitalization costs (P ,
0.0001). The increase was closer to
$600 to $650 for revision TKA (P ,
0.0001). An association was seen
with an increase in the length of stay
for obese patients. The expansion in
direct hospitalization costs was likely
multifactorial.
Weight Loss After Total
Knee Arthroplasty
It is commonly believed that TKA will
allow obese patients to be more active
and subsequently experience sub-
stantial postoperative weight loss.
However, most patients who undergo
TKA
do
not
lose
weight
post-
operatively.Astetal43 evaluated 3,893
total hip arthroplasties and 3,036
TKAs over a 2-year postoperative
interval to determine whether patients
had meaningful weight loss, defined as
a 5% change in BMI. Among patients
who underwent TKA, 69% had no
meaningful change in BMI. Higher

 preoperative BMI level, female sex,
and TKA correlated strongly with
weight loss. Another study indicated
that obese patients may be more likely
to maintain or even gain weight after
TKA.44
Summary
Obesity is an epidemic, with a sub-
stantial percentage of the US pop-
ulation
considered
obese
or
overweight. In addition, the average
BMI of patients undergoing TKA has
increased each decade, contributing
to poorer patient outcomes. For this
reason, a comprehensive treatment
plan should be used with this pop-
ulation. To optimize outcomes pre-
operatively,
patients
should
be
screened to determine their nutri-
tional status. Obese patients are often
malnourished and are specifically
prone
to
hypoalbuminemia,
an
independent risk factor for poor
outcomes after TKA. At this time, we
are unable to recommend for or
against preoperative bariatric sur-
gery. However, nutritional labora-
tory tests may improve outcomes in
patients who choose this option.
Intraoperatively, the obese patient
poses several challenges. Because of
excessive soft tissue, exposure may be
problematic. Use of minimally inva-
sive exposures is difficult and may be
associated with increased ligamen-
tous injury and longer surgical time.
Component
placement
is
also
a
challenge in this patient population,
although some authors have shown
improved placement with computer
navigation. Tibial loosening is also
increased
in
obese
patients,
and
stemmed implants should be consid-
ered to improve fixation.
Finally,
postoperative
complica-
tions are a concern in obese patients.
Medically, cardiovascular risks are
nearly doubled in this patient pop-
ulation, and the risk of VTE is high.
Surgically, the risk of periprosthetic
and superficial infections is increased
in obese patients, and implant lon-
gevity is decreased. Of note, most
obese patients who undergo TKA are
unlikely to lose weight and may
actually gain weight postoperatively.
Overall costs of performing TKAs are
also higher in obese patients than in
nonobese patients.
Over the last decade, numerous
studies have demonstrated increased
adverse outcomes after TKA in the
obese population. However, few
studies have examined ways to
optimize and improve these results.
Further research is warranted in this
area.
In
some
centers,
patients
whose BMI exceeds a set limit (ie,
.35 kg/m2) are required to lose
weight before qualifying for TKA.
However, information is limited on
long-term
outcomes
in
subjects
with morbid obesity and advanced
knee arthritis who do not undergo a
TKA. For this reason, it is difficult
to
determine
if
a
weight
limit
should be enforced when evaluat-
ing candidacy for TKA. Neverthe-
less, with the expanding epidemic
of obesity and the known associa-
tion
between
obesity
and
knee
osteoarthritis, the percentage of
TKAs performed in obese patients
is likely to increase.
