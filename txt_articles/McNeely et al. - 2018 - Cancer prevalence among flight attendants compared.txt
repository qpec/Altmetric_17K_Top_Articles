Abstract
Background: Flight attendants are an understudied occupational group, despite undergoing a wide range of
adverse job-related exposures, including to known carcinogens. In our study, we aimed to characterize the
prevalence of cancer diagnoses among U.S. cabin crew relative to the general population.
Methods: In 2014–2015, we surveyed participants of the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study. We compared the
prevalence of their self-reported cancer diagnoses to a contemporaneous cohort in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013–2014) using age-weighted standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs). We
also analyzed associations between job tenure and the prevalence of selected cancers, using logistic regression and
adjusting for potential confounders.
Results: Compared to NHANES participants with a similar socioeconomic status (n = 2729), flight attendants (n = 5366)
had a higher prevalence of every cancer we examined, especially breast cancer, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin
cancer among females. SPR for these conditions were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.24), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.27, 4.06), and 4.09 (95%
CI: 2.70, 6.20), respectively. Job tenure was positively related to non-melanoma skin cancer among females, with
borderline associations for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers among males. Consistent with previous studies,
we observed associations between job tenure and breast cancer among women who had three or more children.
Conclusions: We observed higher rates of specific cancers in flight attendants compared the general population, some
of which were related to job tenure. Our results should be interpreted in light of self-reported health information and a
cross-sectional study design. Future longitudinal studies should evaluate associations between specific exposures and
cancers among cabin crew.

Background
Flight attendants are a highly understudied occupational
cohort that is consistently exposed to several known and
probable carcinogens in the cabin environment [1]. These
include cosmic ionizing radiation at flight altitude, Circa-
dian rhythm disruption due to night shift work, irregular
schedules and frequently crossing time zones, and poor
cabin air quality from a number of sources [2–4]. Many
flight attendants working today were also exposed to high
levels of secondhand tobacco smoke before in-flight
smoking bans were implemented [5]. The long-term
health effects of this mix of occupational exposures,
including with regard to cancers which develop over the
course of many years, have not been well characterized.
Until 2014, flight attendants were excluded from Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Administration protections typic-
ally granted to U.S. workers, and only limited protections
(such as with regard to blood-borne pathogens) were im-
plemented in 2014. Flight attendants’ exposure to ionizing
radiation is still not monitored or regulated in any way,
despite the fact that cabin crew are exposed to the largest
average annual effective dose relative to all other U.S.
radiation workers [6]. Studies regarding cancer risk or
prevalence among flight attendants are relatively sparse and
of varying quality [2]. Results from these studies have been
mixed, but overall point towards associations between in-
flight exposures or job tenure as a flight attendant and

 increased rates of breast and skin cancers, as well as aggre-
gated cancers at all sites [7–11].
To address gaps in the literature, we launched the
Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study (FAHS) in 2007
[12]. In the first wave of our study, we compared cancer
rates of cabin crew relative to the general population,
and evaluated associations between job tenure as a proxy
for occupational exposures and broad groupings of can-
cer types. This study reported elevated rates of female
reproductive cancers among cabin crew, as well as an as-
sociation between job tenure and the prevalence of ag-
gregated skin cancers, but the survey did not query
participants about individual cancer diagnoses [12]. We
have since completed the second wave of the FAHS in
2014–2015, in which we also reported associations be-
tween flight attendant work and the prevalence of cancer
at all sites and aggregated reproductive cancers [1]. We
now aim to characterize the prevalence of a wide range
of specific cancer diagnoses among this occupational
group relative to the U.S. general population and in rela-
tion to job tenure and parity. We hypothesized that we
would observe associations between work as a flight at-
tendant and prevalence of reproductive, melanoma, and
non-melanoma skin cancers.
Methods
Study population
Our participants were enrolled in the second wave of
the FAHS, an ongoing study of flight attendant health
which was established in 2007 and originally enrolled
4011 flight attendants [12]. For the 2014–2015 wave of
the FAHS reported in this manuscript, we recruited both
new
and
returning
flight
attendants
to
participate
through several channels, including a hard copy survey
mailed to the 2007 participants and distributed at airport
terminals between December 2014 and June 2015, and
an online survey launched in December 2014 [1]. We
supplemented our survey reach with in-person recruit-
ment at five large airport hubs in the U.S. Our recruit-
ment campaign also included announcements about the
study from local unions and through social media.
Survey participants were eligible to enter a lottery to win
an iPad or Apple watch over an 18-month period.
Any current or former U.S. flight attendant was
eligible to participate in the FAHS (91% of the partici-
pants in the current study were currently employed as
flight attendants, and 9% were former flight attendants).
While Wave 1 of the FAHS restricted participants to
flight attendants employed by two U.S. airlines, Wave 2
was open to any U.S. flight attendant. Hence, partici-
pants in the current study worked for a wide range of
airlines, flying both domestically and internationally. We
collected
1642 surveys
from
returning
participants,
which represents a 40% response rate from the original
cohort with still-valid addresses. In total, the 2014–2015
FAHS cohort enrolled 5366 U.S. flight attendants with
information on age and gender. These variables were
among the last questions to be asked in the online ques-
tionnaire and are thus indicators of survey completeness.
Our study was approved the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health Institutional Review Board, and all
participants provided their written informed consent.
Survey
Our survey instrument included validated questions
about self-reported health outcomes and symptomology,
work experiences, and personal characteristics [1, 11],
taken from established surveys such as the Job Content
Questionnaire and the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) [13, 14]. We note that
dates of cancer diagnoses were not recorded in the
FAHS questionnaire. Participants were also asked to
provide aviation employment history, including airlines,
primary hubs, and dates of employment and leave.
Comparison to NHANES
We compared the prevalence of cancers reported in the
FAHS to equivalent information collected from a nation-
ally representative sample from the NHANES during the
years 2013–2014 [14]. The NHANES is administered by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and collects demographic, health, dietary, and biomarker
data from approximately 5000 U.S. residents each year.
All cancers had binary answer choices for prevalence
(ever diagnosed: yes/no) in the NHANES questionnaire.
We weighted the NHANES data by their two-year sam-
ple weights, primary sampling units, and strata based on
published analytic guidelines [15]. We restricted respon-
dents to currently employed adults with a family income
to poverty ratio of 1 or greater and at least a high school
education in order to better match the demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics of our study population.
Statistical analyses
We compared the prevalence of self-reported cancers in
the NHANES and FAHS using the Standardized Preva-
lence Ratio (SPR), an indirect method of standardization
which compares observed and expected prevalence given
rates in the reference study population, which in our
case was the NHANES [16]. The SPR was weighted by
age category (18–39, 40–59, and 60+ years) and analyzed
separately by gender. We conducted these analyses for
cancers diagnosed among at least 20 FAHS participants
for a given gender. To further increase the comparability
of the two study populations, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis restricted to non-Hispanic white participants,
who comprised 75% of our cohort and 43% of the
NHANES population. We also conducted a secondary

 analysis evaluating the age-adjusted comparative preva-
lence of cancers for flight attendants exposed to high
levels of historical occupational secondhand smoke prior
to 1988, standardized to the subset of NHANES partici-
pants ages 45 or older. Occupational smoking exposure
was based on reported work histories – those working
as flight attendants prior to 1988 were considered to be
in the highly exposed subgroup.
We analyzed gender-stratified associations between
net job tenure (total time working as a flight attendant
minus any leave) and self-reported cancers using logistic
regression and adjusting for potential confounders: age
(continuous), current and past smoking status (yes/no
for both), current overweight status based on body mass
index (25+ vs. < 25 kg/m2), and educational attainment
(high
school,
some
college/trade
certificate,
college
degree or higher); breast cancer models were further
adjusted for number of live births. Tenure was meant to
serve as a proxy for the duration of occupational
exposures [17]. We also conducted sensitivity analyses
further adjusting multivariate tenure-cancer models for
usual alcohol intake (none, 1–3 servings per month, 1–6
servings per week, 1 or more servings per day), as alco-
hol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer [18]
and may be a risk factor for melanoma and non-
melanoma skin cancers as well [19].
We examined cancer prevalence in relation to total
net tenure as well as tenure prior to age 40 and age 45
(restricted to participants aged over 40 and 45, respectively,
in order to standardize exposure opportunity). For breast
cancer, we evaluated these associations both overall and
stratified by parity (nulliparous, 1–2, 3+). Parity categories
were chosen based on previous studies of breast cancer
among cabin crew [20, 21]. We chose to examine tenure at
younger ages in order to approximate exposures during the
reproductive years for hormone responsive cancers, and be-
cause of evidence that ionizing radiation exposure is most
relevant to cancer risk at earlier ages [22, 23]. Finally, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis restricting SPRs and tenure
analyses to the 91% of our cohort who were currently
employed as flight attendants to better match the NHANES
comparison population. Analyses were completed using
STATA statistical software, version 14 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX).
Results
We report characteristics of both FAHS and NHANES
participants in Additional file 1: Table S1. Wave 2 FAHS
participants presented with a mean age of 52 years (15%
were between ages 18–39, 54% were between ages 40–59,
and 32% were over age 60) and an average net job tenure
of 20 years. Over 80% of our cohort was female, as
expected in this feminized occupation, and 8% reported
being
current
smokers.
Slightly
over
15%
of
our
participants reported ever being diagnosed with any can-
cer. NHANES participants’ ages differed from FAHS par-
ticipants, with 31% between ages 18 and 39, 50% between
ages 40 and 59, and 20% over age 60. Mean number of live
births also differed between the females in the two study
populations (0.8 for FAHS vs. 2.1 for NHANES), despite
NHANES having a higher percentage of women still in
their childbearing years than the FAHS. The NHANES
cohort was 54% female, and 16% reported being current
smokers (Additional file 1: Table S1).
We report SPRs comparing the prevalence of cancer
diagnoses in the FAHS and the NHANES in Table 1. We
report a higher prevalence of every cancer outcome we
examined among cabin crew relative to the general
population, including breast, uterine, cervical, gastro-
intestinal, thyroid, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin
cancers. The SPRs for breast, melanoma and non-
melanoma skin cancers among females were 1.51 (95%
CI: 1.02–2.24), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.27–4.06), and 4.09 (95%
CI: 2.70–6.20), respectively, with slightly higher SPRs
among those with high occupational secondhand smoke
exposure (Additional file 2: Table S2). The SPR for
melanoma
and
non-melanoma
skin
cancers
were
modestly elevated among males overall (SPR = 1.47, 95%
CI: 0.72–3.01, and SPR = 1.11, 95% CI:0.78–1.59, re-
spectively), and were considerably higher (though less
precise) among men exposed to high levels of occupa-
tional secondhand smoke (SPR = 3.80, 95% CI: 1.67–8.65
and SPR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.53–3.87) (Additional file 2:
Table S2). All reported SPRs were similar when restrict-
ing the NHANES and FAHS study populations to non-
Hispanic white participants (data not shown).
We also found associations between each five-year in-
crease in net job tenure as a flight attendant and non-
melanoma skin cancer among females (OR = 1.07, 95% CI:
1.01, 1.13), with borderline associations for melanoma and
non-melanoma skin cancers among males (OR = 1.23,
95% CI: 0.94, 1.61 and OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.38,
respectively) (Table 2). Overall job tenure was not related
to breast cancer, thyroid cancer, or melanoma among
females. Adjusting for alcohol intake as a sensitivity ana-
lysis in our job tenure-cancer prevalence models altered
associations somewhat for non-melanoma skin cancer
among men (OR = 1.10 vs. 1.17) and for breast cancer
(OR = 1.00 vs. 0.99), but not in relation to a 10% change in
estimate criterion for determining confounding; adjusting
for alcohol intake did not affect results for melanoma or
non-melanoma skin cancer among women (data not
shown). Sample size is lower for the tenure analysis than
for the SPR calculations because of missing data regarding
tenure and model covariates; missingness for these vari-
ables is reported in Additional file 1: Table S1. Similarly,
restricting both the tenure analyses and the SPR calcula-
tions

 attendants (91% of the cohort) did not meaningfully alter
the results, nor did restricting any of the tenure analyses
to participants over the age of 40 or 45 (data not shown).
With the possible exception of breast cancer, associations
with most cancers were not meaningfully changed by
restricting the exposure of interest to job tenure prior to
age 40 or 45 (Table 3 for breast cancer; other data not
shown). Finally, we found evidence of a positive associ-
ation between job tenure as a flight attendant and breast
cancer among those with 3 or more children, and associa-
tions were strongest when combining these parity sub-
groups with the job tenure measure prior to age 45. We
also found some evidence of a tenure-breast cancer asso-
ciation among nulliparous flight attendants, though the
associated confidence intervals were less precise and in-
cluded the null. For example, associations between tenure
prior age 45 and breast cancer risk were OR = 1.44 (95%
CI: 0.83, 2.49) among nulliparous women, OR = 0.95 (95%
CI: 0.78, 1.17) among women with 1 or 2 children, and
OR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.81) among women with 3 more
children (Table 3).
Discussion
We have conducted a large and comprehensive study
characterizing cancer rates among U.S. cabin crew rela-
tive to the general U.S. population, which adds to the
relatively sparse literature regarding cabin crew health
and has included profiling a wide range of cancers. Con-
sistent with previous studies reporting on cancer inci-
dence and mortality among flight attendants, we report
a higher prevalence of breast, melanoma and non-
melanoma skin cancers (comprising basal cell and squa-
mous cell carcinomas) among this occupational group
relative to the general population. This is striking given
the low rates of overweight and smoking among flight
attendants in our study population, which we take to be
indicators of general health and healthy behaviors, as
well as being independent risk factors for some cancers
[1, 11]. We also report associations between job tenure
as a flight attendant and several cancer outcomes, con-
sistent with previous U.S. and European studies [7–11],
though we note that our reliance on cancer prevalence
rather than incidence complicates the interpretation of
our findings with regard to the timing of both work ex-
posures and cancer outcomes, and the conflation of can-
cer incidence and survivorship. Nevertheless, our study
extends the sparse literature on this important topic,
confirms previous findings, and is the first study to note
an increase in non-melanoma skin cancer among U.S.
cabin crew (consistent with studies of European cabin
crew and pilots). Our work informs future research di-
rections regarding the health of this understudied group

 of workers and highlights the question of what can be
done to minimize the adverse exposures and cancers
common among cabin crew.
Our finding of a greater prevalence of breast and skin
cancers among flight attendants is consistent with most of
the epidemiologic literature on this topic to date [7–11].
As noted above, our study is the first to show an increase
in non-melanoma skin cancer among U.S. cabin crew
relative to the general population, which replicates find-
ings among European flight attendants and pilots [11, 24].
We also observed that job tenure as a flight attendant was
associated with the prevalence of non-melanoma skin can-
cer, as well as breast cancer (within parity subgroups),
among females. We were also able to conduct SPR ana-
lyses among crew with in-flight secondhand smoke expos-
ure prior to 1988 and found that some associations were
strengthened among this subset of participants. Interpret-
ation of the latter results is somewhat hampered by the
fact that participants’ occupational secondhand exposures
ended by 1998 at the latest, and studies regarding smoking
or secondhand smoking exposures and breast and skin
cancers have reported mixed results [25, 26]. However,
secondhand smoke has been linked to breast and skin
cancers in some studies and is certainly a potential risk
factor for these cancers, and unlike for cardiovascular dis-
ease, smoking-related risk of cancer never falls to baseline,
even years after cessation of the exposure [25, 26].
Our results are also consistent with cabin crews’ occu-
pational exposures to ionizing radiation [2, 6], Circadian
rhythm disruption [3], historical exposures to in-flight
secondhand smoke [5], and ongoing exposures to other
chemical agents [2], most of which are classified as
confirmed or probable carcinogens in humans [27–29].
Ionizing radiation is a known causal factor for non-
melanoma skin cancer and breast cancer [27], whereas
the studies regarding melanoma in relation to ionizing
radiation are more conflicted [30]. It should be noted
that cabin crew have the largest annual ionizing radiation
dose of all U.S. workers (e.g. 3.07 mSv vs. 0.59 mSv for U.S.
Department of Energy workers) [5]. These exposures can
easily exceed guidelines released by the NCRP or the
International Commission on Radiological Protection
[6, 31]. Although we evaluated job tenure prior to age
45 or age 40 in relation to cancer prevalence, in part to
isolate the potential effects of ionizing radiation expos-
ure at younger ages, these restrictions generally did not
meaningfully alter our results. This may be because
ionizing radiation exposure is also important to cancer
risk at older ages, and because it is difficult to disentan-
gle the relevant exposure years in our study population,
which has a median tenure of 19 years of employment
and for which cancer diagnosis date was not recorded.
One possible exception is for breast cancer, for which
associations were somewhat stronger when evaluating
tenure prior age 45 rather than lifetime tenure. These
results, while imprecise and requiring replication in a
study that estimates cosmic ionizing radiation exposure
directly (rather than using tenure as a proxy), may sug-
gest that flight-related exposures are most important to
breast cancer risk when occurring at earlier ages.
We report associations between duration of employ-
ment as a flight attendant and breast cancer risk among
women who had three or more children, with some
evidence of an association among nulliparous women as
well, though the latter association was imprecise. Nulli-
parity is a risk factor for breast cancer, and women who
are parous may be less susceptible to the effects of
carcinogenic exposures on the breast due to breast cell
differentiation occurring after a first pregnancy [32, 33].
Hence, our findings of a somewhat stronger association
between job tenure and breast cancer among nulliparous
women is consistent with the current state of biologic

 and epidemiologic knowledge, though it should be noted
that the few relevant previous studies among cabin crew
did not show increased risk of breast cancer among nul-
liparous relative to parous participants [20, 21, 34]. Our
findings of a stronger association between tenure as a
flight attendant and breast cancer among women with
three or more children is, interestingly, consistent with
two other recent publications on this topic among cabin
crew [20, 21]. The authors of the latter studies, which
evaluated breast cancer in relation to calculated cosmic
radiation exposure and Circadian rhythm disruption,
hypothesized that these unexpected results may be due
to Circadian rhythm changes from shift work and cross-
ing time zones [21], especially since flight attendants
report a much higher rate of sleep disorders and distur-
bances relative to the general population [11, 12] and
these effects may be exacerbated among women with
young children who have greater sleep disruptions from
both their home and work lives [21].
Limitations of our study include its cross-sectional
design, which precludes inferences about causality, as an
observed association may reflect the effect of flight
attendant work on a given condition, or the effect of an
outcome on a factor related to employment as a flight
attendant. Use of structured questionnaires, as in our
study, aims to minimize this bias. We also note a further
limitation that the date of cancer diagnosis was not
recorded in the FAHS questionnaire. Hence, some
reported cancers may have been diagnosed prior to em-
ployment as a flight attendant, and some flight attendant
work (i.e. exposure) may have occurred following a can-
cer diagnosis, making the direction of the potential bias
unclear. These limitations are counteracted in part by
our analyses evaluating job tenure prior to age 40 and
45 years in relation to cancer prevalences, as many can-
cers, including of the skin and breast, occur later in life.
Therefore, this restriction increases the probability that
the exposure of interest occurred prior to the reported
cancer outcome.
Another potential limitation of our study involves the
question of whether a population of flight attendants is
sufficiently comparable to the general U.S. population
with regard to cancer risk factors, and whether differ-
ences in risk factors may introduce bias to the SPRs. For
example, we report substantial differences in racial pro-
file, smoking status, overweight prevalence, and number
of live births between the FAHS and NHANES cohorts,
all of which are related to the risk of various cancers.
We have counteracted this issue in part by restricting
the NHANES comparison group to currently employed
adults with at least a high school degree and above a
certain income to poverty ratio, and by conducting sen-
sitivity analyses restricting to non-Hispanic white partic-
ipants that showed no meaningful differences from our
main results. We also note that the FAHS includes a
substantially smaller percentage of current smokers and
overweight participants than the NHANES population,
which would be expected to decrease the risk of several
cancers, whereas we consistently observed increased
cancer SPRs. At the same time, we should note that
FAHS participants had fewer children than NHANES
participants (which elevates the risk of breast cancer),
though this is in part ameliorated by the fact that we ob-
served associations between tenure as a flight attendant
and breast cancer within parity subgroups. Even with the
above reported sensitivity analyses, we acknowledge that
the potential for residual confounding by cancer risk fac-
tor profile differences between the two study populations
(such as for race and parity) still exists.
In addition, health outcomes in our study and in the
NHANES were based on self-report; validation through
medical records was not possible due to the scope and
cost of this endeavor. Validity of self-reported health out-
comes varies by study population and the outcome of
interest. Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported out-
comes relative to medical records or linkage to disease
registries were found to be moderate to high for common
cancers (including breast cancer and melanoma), particu-
larly among those with higher socioeconomic status, such
as in our well-educated cohort [35]. However, this has not
been the case for non-melanoma skin cancer. We should
note that non-melanoma skin cancers are excluded from
most U.S. cancer registries and may be under-reported by
those that do include it [36]. This may explain why non-
melanoma skin cancer assessed through the California
Cancer Registry was not related to flight attendant work
in a previous study [9], in contrast to many other studies
conducted among cabin crew and pilots, including our
own research presented here [11, 24].
A further limitation of our study is that we recruited
flight attendants from a mix of company rosters, on-site
airport recruitment, and an online/social media pres-
ence. Recruiting volunteer participants not recruited
from employee files may have contributed to selection
bias. For example, volunteer participants may differ from
those recruited using a more randomized approach in
terms of various factors, including their socioeconomic
status, attitude toward health research, and factors re-
lated to time and ability to complete online surveys
(which may also be related to health), as discussed in a
recent analysis with regard to online recruitment in the
Heart eHealth Study relative to NHANES [37]. However,
the above analysis reported that, while selection bias was
likely on a variety of factors, such as gender and marital
status, it was much less likely to affect internal (rather
than external) validity of exposure-outcome associations
[37]. This is likely to be especially true in a relatively
homogenous workforce than in a general population

 study recruited online. It is also important to note that
an online recruitment strategy has many advantages in
terms of efficiency, reliability of data collection and
coding, and the ability to reach a wider range of poten-
tial study participants [37].
Our study may have attracted a disproportionate num-
ber of flight attendants with cancer, leading to detection
bias, as flight attendants with worse health are likely to
be more motivated to participate in an epidemiological
study of flight attendant health, are likely to attend regu-
lar medical check-ups (this is true for flight attendants
in general), and the question of cancer risk in relation to
flight exposures is well known within the aviation com-
munity. However, it is reassuring that our results are
consistent with previous studies that recruited partici-
pants from employee rosters [8–10].
Additional limitations of our study include reliance on
job tenure as a surrogate for occupational exposures,
lack of correction for multiple testing, insufficient power
to evaluate less common cancers, and insufficient infor-
mation on confounders for some cancers. In particular,
we were not able to control for leisure-time UV expos-
ure when evaluating skin cancer risk, though it should
be noted that a large study found no difference in sun-
bathing habits between flight attendants and the general
population [38]. We plan to evaluate specific exposures
in future individual exposure-outcome analyses. Finally,
we note that our reliance on prevalence rather than inci-
dence of cancer confuses the issues of cancer risk and
survivorship in interpreting our results. This is in part
ameliorated by the fact that breast and skin cancers have
relatively low mortality rates (especially for basal cell
carcinoma, which is not considered fatal or disabling),
and that we are comparing to prevalence rates in
NHANES as well. Nevertheless, the limitation remains,
and it is also important to note that flight attendants
may differ from the general population of U.S. workers
with regard to health insurance access, paid leave
policies, and other benefits that could affect survivor-
ship, and may be more likely to have access to an
urban center with better quality health care for can-
cer treatment. It is reassuring that our results are
consistent with previous studies that relied on cancer
incidence [9, 10].
Strengths of our study include access to the resources
of a large cohort of cabin crew with information on a
range of cancer outcomes, work experiences, and poten-
tial confounders. In addition, online questionnaires are
an increasingly popular option in epidemiologic re-
search, including high profile studies such as the Millen-
nium Cohort and the Nurses’ Health Study 3 [39]. This
mode of data collection allows for validation checks,
reduced data entry and coding errors, personalized ques-
tion administration, convenience to participants, equal
or better validity compared to hard copy questionnaires,
and the collection of metadata, such as date, time, and
time to completion, which can be used for quality con-
trol and sensitivity analyses [39].
Our study findings contribute to the sparse litera-
ture on flight attendant health, which may also be ap-
plicable
to
passengers,
especially
frequent
flyers.
Conducting high quality studies within this group of
workers is important given that U.S. cabin crew are
subject to fewer protections than most workers in this
country and relative to flight attendants working in
the European Union (EU). For example, the EU re-
quires airlines to monitor radiation dose, organize
schedules to reduce radiation exposure, and inform
workers of current studies [40].
Conclusions
We have conducted a large and comprehensive study
characterizing cancer prevalence rates among flight
attendants relative to the general population. Despite
low smoking and obesity levels indicative of positive
health behaviors, we report that flight attendants have
elevated
rates
of several
cancers,
especially breast,
melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancers. These
results are consistent with previous findings regarding
flight crew health. Ours is the first study to report an
elevated rate of non-melanoma skin cancer in a U.S.
flight
attendant
cohort
(consistent
with
European
studies). Some of these cancers were also related to
tenure as a flight attendant, overall or within subgroups
of parity in the case of breast cancer. Our results yield
information to guide future research regarding the
health of this understudied group of workers, which can
also be considered when evaluating how to improve
health and quality of life among cabin crew.
