Mutations in the optineurin (OPTN) gene have been implicated in both familial and
sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the role of this protein in the
central nervous system (CNS) and how it may contribute to ALS pathology are unclear.
Here, we found that optineurin actively suppressed receptor-interacting kinase 1
(RIPK1)–dependent signaling by regulating its turnover. Loss of OPTN led to progressive
dysmyelination and axonal degeneration through engagement of necroptotic machinery
in the CNS, including RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain–like protein
(MLKL). Furthermore, RIPK1- and RIPK3-mediated axonal pathology was commonly
observed in SOD1G93A transgenic mice and pathological samples from human ALS
patients. Thus, RIPK1 and RIPK3 play a critical role in mediating progressive axonal
degeneration. Furthermore, inhibiting RIPK1 kinase may provide an axonal protective
strategy for the treatment of ALS and other human degenerative diseases characterized
by axonal degeneration.
L
oss-of-function mutations in the optineurin
(OPTN) gene have been implicated in both
familial and sporadic cases of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating degen-
erative motor neuron disease (1–3). The
Optn gene encodes a ubiquitin-binding protein
involved in tumor necrosis factor–a (TNFa)
signaling but is dispensable for nuclear factor
kB (NF-kB) activation (4, 5). It is still unclear
how the loss of function of OPTN leads to hu-
man ALS.
Receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a crit-
ical regulator of cell death and inflammation (6).
RIPK1 regulates necroptosis, a form of regulated
necrotic cell death, by promoting the sequential
activation of two downstream targets, RIPK3
and mixed lineage kinase domain–like protein
(MLKL) (7–9). Application of necrostatin-1 (7-Cl-
O-Nec-1) (Nec-1s), a highly specific inhibitor of
RIPK1 kinase activity, blocks necroptosis and
inflammation in vitro and in vivo (10, 11). How-
ever, the pathophysiological significance of RIPK1
and necroptosis in the genetic context of human
diseases remains to be established.
ALS belongs to axonal “dying back” neuro-
degenerative diseases, as the onset begins with
axonal pathology. Axonal degeneration makes a
substantial contribution to neurological disability
in these patients (12). Axonal degeneration induced
by direct nerve injury—known as Wallerian degen-
eration—is mediated through a mechanism distinct
from apoptosis of neuronal cell bodies (13, 14).
Axonal degeneration in patients with neuro-
degenerative diseases such as ALS may also ex-
hibit features similar to those of Wallerian
degeneration and is referred to as “Wallerian-like”
degeneration. The mechanism of Wallerian or
Wallerian-like degeneration is still unclear.
To understand the mechanism by which the
loss of OPTN could lead to ALS, we developed
Optn–/– mice (fig. S1, A and B). We examined the
impact of Optn loss in the spinal cord of Optn–/–
mice. The number and morphology of spinal cord
motor neurons in Optn–/– mice were indistin-
guishable from wild-type (WT) mice (fig. S1, C
and D). However, from the age of 3 weeks to
2 years, we observed a marked reduction in the
number of motor axons and abnormal myeli-
nation in the ventrolateral spinal cord white
matter in the Optn–/– mice (Fig. 1, A to D, and
fig. S1E). The axonal pathology presented as a
decompaction of myelin sheaths with a decreased
g-ratio (axon diameter/axon-plus-myelin diame-
ter), an increased number of large-diameter
axons, and a decreased axonal number in the
ventrolateral white matter (Fig. 1, B to D), which
suggested degeneration and swelling of motor
neuron axons in Optn–/– mice. This finding is
similar to the axonal pathology observed in the
spinal cords of ALS patients in the early stages
of the disease (15). The pathology was progressive—
a reduction in axonal numbers was observed at
12 weeks or older but not at 3 weeks (fig. S1F).
Similar pathology was observed in the ventral
roots of motor axons in Optn–/– mice (fig. S1, G
to J). In addition, denervation of neuromuscular
junctions in the tibialis anterior muscle was ob-
served in Optn–/– mice (fig. S1, K and L). Thus,
OPTN deficiency leads to axonal pathology with-
out affecting motor neuron cell bodies. Consistent
with this notion, we observed a significant increase
in the number of cells positive for terminal deoxy-
nucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine
triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL+ cells)
in the ventrolateral white matter of spinal cords
of Optn–/– mice (Fig. 1E). Thus, Optn deficiency
sensitizes cells to cell death in the spinal cord
white matter of Optn–/– mice.
To determine the cell types involved in
mediating Optn deficiency–induced axonal degen-
eration, we generated lineage-specific deletion of
Optn using Cnp-cre, Lyz2-cre, Gfap-cre, and Mnx1-
cre mice (16–18) (fig. S2). Loss of Optn from
oligodendrocytes and myeloid cells, but not
from astrocytes or motor neurons, was sufficient
to reproduce axonal myelination pathology (Fig. 1,
F to I). Furthermore, we induced Optn loss from
the microglial lineage by dosing OptnF/F;Cx3cr1Cre
mice (19) with tamoxifen for 1 month (fig. S3A)
and also found axonal pathology like that in
Optn–/– mice (fig. S3, B to E).
We found that knockdown of Optn sensitized
cells to necroptosis in our genome-wide small in-
terfering RNA screen (20, 21) (Z-score = –2.07)
(table S1). We further confirmed that knockdown
of Optn sensitized L929 cells to necroptosis in-
duced by TNFa or zVAD.fmk (fig. S4, A and B).
zVAD-induced necrosis is known to involve
autocrine TNFa activity (22). Thus, Optn deficiency
sensitized cells to necroptosis (fig. S4C). The bio-
chemical hallmarks of necroptosis—including
the upshifts of Ripk1, Ripk3, and phospho-
MLKL (p-MLKL), as well as the levels of complex
IIb—were significantly higher in Optn–/– mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) than in Optn+/+ MEFs
stimulated by TNFa, zVAD, or cycloheximide
(fig. S4D). Note that Optn–/– oligodendrocytes
were sensitized to die by TNFa-induced necrop-
tosis but were protected by Nec-1s and in Optn–/–;
Ripk1D138N/D138N and Optn–/–;Ripk3–/– double mu-
tants (23, 24) (Fig. 2A). Thus, Optn deficiency can
promote necroptosis of oligodendrocytes.
The expression levels of Ripk1, Ripk3, and
MLKL—the key mediators of necroptosis—were
all increased in the spinal cords of Optn–/– mice
(Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we detected the interac-
tion of Optn and Ripk1 in spinal cords from WT
mice (Fig. 2C). Compared with WT mice, RIPK1
lysine 48 (K48) ubiquitination levels were de-
creased, whereas Ripk1 mRNA was unchanged
in the spinal cords of Optn–/– mice (Fig. 2, D
and E). Furthermore, Ripk1 was degraded more
slowly in Optn–/– MEFs than that in WT cells

 (Fig. 2F). Thus, OPTN might control sensitivity
to necroptosis by regulating proteasomal turn-
over of RIPK1.
Phospho-Ser14/15, a marker of Ripk1 activa-
tion, was increased in Optn–/– microglia relative
to WT microglia, which were inhibited by Nec-1s
and Ripk1D138N/D138N mutation (Fig. 2G). Because
microglia express little MLKL, we hypothesize
that Ripk1 activation in microglia promotes in-
flammatory signaling not necroptosis. Consistent
with this notion, we detected an increased pro-
duction of multiple proinflammatory cytokines—
including interleukins IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, and IL-12;
interferon-g (IFN-g); and TNFa in the spinal cords
of Optn–/– mice—which were markedly reduced
in the Optn–/–;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice (Fig. 2H).
In addition, Optn–/– microglia had elevated TNFa,
which was inhibited by Nec-1s (fig. S5A). As pre-
dicted, the levels of TNFa were also increased in
the spinal cords of OptnF/F;Lyz2-cre mice (fig. S5B).
To explore the effect of Optn deficiency on
transcriptions, we performed RNA sequencing
on WT, Optn–/–, and Optn–/–;Ripk1D138N/D138N
primary microglia. Coexpression analysis (25)
identified a module with ~1300 genes (ME1) dif-
ferentially expressed between WT and Optn–/–
microglia and suppressed by Ripk1D138N/D138N.

Optn–/– mice. (A) Dysmyelination in the spinal cords of Optn–/– mice was
blocked by genetically inhibiting Ripk1 in Optn–/–;Ripk1D138N/D138N mice, phar-
macologically inhibiting Ripk1 by Nec-1s (oral dosing of Nec-1s for 1 month
starting from 8 weeks of age), and by loss of Ripk3 in Optn–/–;Ripk3–/– mice.

(F to H) Mice of indicated genotypes were tested in open-field test for spon-
taneous motor activity. The mice were at 3 months of age and 28 to 32 g of
body weight (no statistically significant difference in body weight between
different groups). The total distance traveled in 1 hour showed no difference
between different groups (F). Optn–/– mice showed a significant deficit on the
vertical rearing activity (frequency with which the mice stood on their hind
legs). This deficit was blocked after dosing with Nec-1s for 1 month starting
from 8 weeks old and in Optn–/–;Ripk1D138N/D138N double-mutant mice and
reduced in Optn–/–;Ripk3–/– double-mutant mice (G and H).

 The top 71 genes in this module include CD14
and CD86, biomarkers for the proinflammatory
M1-like state (26) (Fig. 2I and table S2). Elevated
CD14 and CD86 in Optn–/– microglia were sup-
pressed by Nec-1s and Ripk1D138N/D138N (fig. S5C).
Thus, Optn deficiency promotes an M1-like in-
flammatory microglia.
We analyzed the genes differentially expressed
in Optn–/– microglia using MSigDB (Molecular
Signatures Database) (27) to identify transcription
factors with targets that were overrepresented.
We found a significant overrepresentation of
the predicted Sp1 transcription factor targets
in the ME1 module (table S3) with a network
(28) of 225 Sp1 targets regulated by RIPK1 (fig.
S6A). Increased production of TNFa and the
death of L929 cells were blocked by knockdown
of Sp1 and by Nec-1s (fig. S6, B and C). Thus, loss
of Optn in the spinal cord may increase RIPK1-
dependent inflammation.
We examined the involvement of necroptosis
in Optn–/– mice in vivo. The increase in TUNEL+
cells and the axonal pathology of Optn–/– mice
were all rescued in the Optn–/–;Ripk1D138N/D138N
double-mutant and the Optn–/–;Ripk3–/– double-
mutant mice and by Nec-1s (Fig. 3, A to E).
Behaviorally, Optn–/– mice showed no difference
in total locomotor activity, whereas the vertical
rearing activity was significantly reduced com-
pared with that of WT mice (Fig. 3, F to H). Thus,
Optn deficiency leads to hindlimb weakness.
Furthermore, the vertical rearing deficit in Optn–/–
mice was rescued pharmacologically by Nec-1s
and genetically in the Optn–/–;Ripk1D138N/D138N
mice and Optn–/–;Ripk3–/– mice. Thus, Optn
deficiency leads to the activation of necroptotic
machinery to promote axonal pathology.
To explore the involvement of RIPK1-mediated
axonal pathology in ALS in general, we used
SOD1G93A transgenic mice. Oligodendrocytes in
SOD1G93A mice degenerate early, but the mech-
anism is unclear (29). We found that the expres-
sion of Ripk1, Ripk3, and MLKL in the spinal
cords of SOD1G93A transgenic mice was elevated
(Fig. 4A). In addition, we observed a similar
axonal pathology as that of Optn–/– mice in
SOD1 G93A mice before the onset of motor dys-
function (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, these
axonal myelination defects were blocked and
motor dysfunction onset was delayed geneti-
cally by Ripk3 knockout or by oral administration

Downloaded from 
 of Nec-1s (Fig. 4, D and E). Thus, although we
cannot rule out the contribution of Ripk1 or
other proapoptotic factors to the degeneration of
motor neuron cell bodies (30, 31), the activation
of necroptosis contributes to axonal pathology and
motor dysfunction in the SOD1G93A transgenic
mice.
We next characterized the role of RIPK1 and
necroptosis in human ALS. We found evidence
of demyelination in the lateral column white
matter of lower spinal cord pathological samples
from ALS patients as reported (Fig. 4F). In hu-
man ALS pathological samples, we also detected
multiple biochemical hallmarks of necroptosis,
including increased levels of RIPK1, RIPK3, and
MLKL and increased RIPK1 p-Ser14/15 and p-MLKL
in both microglia and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4G,
fig. S7, and table S4). Note that p-MLKL was
primarily localized in the white matter, where
demyelination was found.
Taken together, our results provide a direct
connection between Wallerian-like degeneration
induced by OPTN deficiency and RIPK1-regulated
necroptosis and inflammation. By promoting
both inflammation and cell death, RIPK1 may
be a common mediator of axonal pathology in
ALS (fig. S8). Because RIPK1 is recruited specif-
ically to the TNF receptor TNFR1 to mediate the
deleterious effect of TNFa (32), blocking RIPK1
may provide a therapeutic option for the treat-
ment of ALS without affecting TNFR2. Finally,
given the recruitment of OPTN to intracellular
protein aggregates found in pathological samples
from patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, multiple sys-
tem atrophy, and Pick’s disease (33, 34), a possible
role of RIPK1 in mediating the wide presence of
axonal degeneration in different neurodegen-
erative diseases should be considered.
