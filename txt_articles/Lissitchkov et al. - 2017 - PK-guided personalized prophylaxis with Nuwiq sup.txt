Introduction: Nuwiq� (human-cl rhFVIII) is a 4th generation recombinant human FVIII, without chemical
modification or protein fusion, produced in a human cell-line. Aims/Methods: This study (NuPreviq) was a
prospective, open-label, multicentre, phase IIIb study of the efficacy and safety of personalized prophylaxis with
Nuwiq� in 66 previously treated adults with severe haemophilia A. NuPreviq had three phases: (i) a 72-h
pharmacokinetic (PK) phase; (ii) a 1–3 month standard prophylaxis phase; and (iii) a 6-month personalized
prophylaxis phase. The personalized prophylaxis regimen was based on individual PK modelling for each patient
according to whether their PK profile most closely fitted a two- or one-compartment model (NuPreviq approach).
In cases of uncertainty, a noncompartment model was applied. Results: The median dosing interval during
personalized prophylaxis was 3.5 days, with 57% of patients on ≤2 weekly dosing. Mean annualized bleeding
rates during personalized prophylaxis were 1.45 (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 0 [0, 1.9]) for all bleeds,
0.79 (median [IQR]: 0 [0, 0]) for spontaneous bleeds, and 0.91 (median [IQR]: 0 [0, 0]) for joint bleeds. During
personalized prophylaxis, 83.1% of patients were spontaneous bleed-free. Compared with standard prophylaxis,
median weekly prophylaxis dose was reduced by 7.2% from 100.0 to 92.8 IU kg�1 during the last 2 months of
personalized prophylaxis. There were no FVIII inhibitors or treatment-related serious or severe adverse events.
Conclusion: PK-guided personalized prophylaxis with Nuwiq� provided bleeding protection and enabled the
dosing interval to be extended to twice weekly or less in many patients and an overall dose reduction.

plasma-derived
FVIII or recombinant FVIII (rFVIII), prophylactically
or on-demand, is the mainstay therapy for correcting
the deficiency in coagulation FVIII in patients with
haemophilia A [1,2]. Prophylaxis is the gold standard
treatment for maintaining haemostasis and preserving
joint function in children with severe haemophilia A
[1,3–5]. There is strong evidence for the benefits of
prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment in adults with
severe haemophilia A [1,3,6–10] and that patients
who discontinue early prophylaxis as young adults
experience a deterioration in joint status [11]. The
World Health Organization, the National Hemophilia
Foundation, and the World Federation of Hemophilia
recommend lifelong prophylaxis [12–14]. In general,
the minimum goal is to protect from recurrent bleed-
ing events that ultimately lead to disability. Ideally,
every bleed should be prevented and the patient

 should be enabled to participate in all normal activi-
ties in life.
Due to interindividual differences in FVIII pharma-
cokinetic (PK) responses, a ‘one size fits all’ approach
to prophylaxis is not ideal, as it potentially leads to
over-treatment in some individuals and under-treat-
ment in others, and a generic plan fails to take into
account a patient’s lifestyle and personal preferences
[15]. As haemophilia A patients with FVIII coagulant
activity (FVIII:C) >1% experience fewer spontaneous
bleeds and consequential damage, currently the main
aim of prophylaxis is to keep the FVIII plasma level
>1% [15].
Standard prophylaxis typically requires three FVIII
infusions per week in a strict regimen due to the mean
half-life of approximately 12 h for most currently avail-
able FVIII concentrates. However, PK responses to
FVIII infusion vary widely between patients due to fac-
tors such as age, weight and clinical phenotype [15,16].
The concept of personalized, patient-tailored prophy-
laxis, whereby dose and dosing frequency is individual-
ized based on PK data, is of growing interest and has
the potential to further optimize patient care and enable
fewer infusions [10,15,17–19]. Scientifically matching
the dosing regimen to the PK of each patient can ensure
that all patients achieve a predetermined FVIII trough
level and protection from bleeding.
Nuwiq� (human-cl rhFVIII, simoctocog alfa; Octa-
pharma AG, Switzerland) is a 4th generation rFVIII
protein, without chemical modification or protein
fusion, which is produced in a human cell-line [20–
23]. Nuwiq� has been shown to be effective in the
prevention and treatment of bleeds in clinical trials
including both paediatric and adult previously treated
patients (PTPs) with severe haemophilia A [24–27]. In
these studies, patients received ‘standard’ prophylaxis
with Nuwiq�.
The mean (standard deviation, SD) half-life using
the one-stage assay in registration studies in PTPs was
17.1 (11.2) h in adults and adolescents, 11.9 (5.4) h
in children aged 2–5 years and 13.1 (2.6) h in children
aged 6 to ≤12 years [25,28]. Based on the half-life of
Nuwiq� and considerable interpatient variability in
FVIII half-life observed with Nuwiq� and across prod-
ucts [25,28–32], a personalized prophylaxis study
applying individually appropriate two-, one- or non-
compartmental PK methods (NuPreviq approach) was
initiated to evaluate the opportunity for extended dos-
ing intervals during PK-guided personalized prophy-
laxis in adult PTPs with severe haemophilia A.
Patients and methods
Study design and patients
This study (NuPreviq, NCT01863758) was a prospec-
tive,
open-label,
multicentre
phase
IIIb
study
investigating the efficacy and safety of individually tai-
lored prophylaxis with Nuwiq� in adult (≥18 years)
PTPs with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%) and
at least 150 exposure days (EDs) to previous FVIII
concentrates. Patients were enrolled at 20 centres in
eight countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and the UK). All patients
were immunocompetent (CD4+ count >200 lL�1).
Patients with severe liver or kidney disease or with
present or past FVIII inhibitor activity were excluded.
The study was conducted in compliance with Good
Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and
national laws. Each patient provided a freely given
written consent before commencing the study.
The study consisted of three phases: (i) a 72-h, PK
evaluation phase; (ii) a 1–3 month standard prophy-
laxis treatment phase; and (iii) a 6-month PK-guided
personalized prophylaxis phase (Fig. 1).
For the PK evaluation, patients received a single
dose of Nuwiq� at a labelled dose of 60 � 5 IU kg�1
after a ≥96 h washout period. Blood samples were
taken before infusion and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 30, 48
and 72 h after the end of infusion and plasma FVIII:C
measured with the one-stage assay at a central labora-
tory (LabCorp, Englewood, CO, USA). The central
laboratory also measured the FVIII concentration in
the Nuwiq� vials used for PK infusions to calculate
the actual dose that patients received.
Calculations of PK parameters (Accovion GmbH,
Marburg, Germany) were made by applying two-,
one- or noncompartmental PK methods (as individu-
ally appropriate) to plasma levels obtained, based on
actual time points and actual potency of Nuwiq�. The
choice of two-, or one- compartment model was made
based on visual inspection, the Akaike information
criterion [33], goodness-of-fit statistics (adjusted R2)
and the coefficient of variation of PK parameters; a
noncompartment model was chosen in cases of uncer-
tainty.
Dosing during prophylaxis is described in Fig. 1.
Dosing for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds
depended on bleed severity, and dosing for surgical
prophylaxis depended on surgery type.
Outcome measures
Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), dosing intervals
and FVIII consumption during prophylaxis were calcu-
lated. Inhibitor activity (Bethesda assay, Nijmegen
modification [34]) was measured at the initial PK
assessment prior to infusion and at study completion
using trough level samples (LabCorp, Englewood, CO,
USA). Adverse events were monitored throughout the
study. Additional outcome measures included the effi-
cacy in the treatment of breakthrough bleeds and dur-
ing
surgical
prophylaxis.

operative blood loss compared with predicted blood
loss and post-operative blood loss.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were descriptive and were per-
formed by Accovion GmbH (Marburg, Germany).
Results
Patients
A total of 66 patients were enrolled and entered all
three phases. Two patients discontinued from the
study prematurely during the personalized prophylaxis
phase: one patient completed the study, in error, ear-
lier than planned after 91 EDs (263 days) and one
patient was lost to follow-up after 73 EDs (172 days),
as the patient moved to another country. Neither of
the patients experienced any bleeds. Mean (SD) treat-
ment duration was 2.7 (0.6) months for standard pro-
phylaxis
and
6.2
(0.5)
months
for
personalized
prophylaxis.
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics
are shown in Table 1. Mean (SD) age at baseline was
33.6 (9.9) years and the total Haemophilia Joint
Health Score (HJHS) at baseline was 37.4 (25.3). The
majority of patients (62%, 41/66) received only on-
demand treatment in the 6 months prior to the study
(HJHS: 45.6 (23.7)), and 38% (25/66) received pro-
phylaxis (mainly irregular) (HJHS: 27.8 (30.3)). Prior
mean (SD) ABRs were 38.9 (27.59), 45.6 (23.71) and
27.8 (30.33) for all patients, prior on-demand and
prophylaxis patients, respectively, during which the
weekly doses were 34.3 (28.64), 21.1 (8.78), and 56.6
(36.19) IU kg�1, respectively.
All 66 patients were included in the PK and safety
analyses. One patient was excluded from the efficacy
and dose/dose regimen analyses as this patient had 79
bleeds during the study and was a major outlier. This
patient already had a high prestudy bleeding fre-
quency (prior ABR of 94) despite prophylaxis.
Dose and dosing interval based on initial PK
evaluation
In the initial PK evaluation (N = 66), the FVIII PK
profile was best described by a two-compartment PK
model for 36 (54.5%) patients and by a one-compart-
ment model for 23 (34.8%) patients. For the remain-
ing seven patients (10.6%), a noncompartment model
was used as neither a two- nor a one-compartment

Overview of study design. *Dose escalations were allowed in case of an inadequate frequency and severity of breakthrough bleeds in accordance with
the institution’s standard clinical care. †During the 6-month personalized prophylaxis phase, a prophylactic dose and dosing interval was recommended based
on the analysis of individual PK data obtained at the initial PK evaluation. These were calculated based on the length of time that a certain dose of Nuwiq�
would provide FVIII:C plasma concentrations of ≥1% using individual half-life data (one-stage assay). The goal was to determine the maximum regular pro-
phylactic dosing interval that could be achieved with a single dose of not more than 60–80 IU/kg while maintaining a trough FVIII:C level of ≥1% and not
exceeding a maximum plasma FVIII:C of 200%. Extra prophylactic dosing prior to risky activities was permitted. In case of unacceptable frequent and/or sev-
ere spontaneous breakthrough bleeds, the dose could be adapted. If patients still experienced unacceptable bleeding, the dosing interval was to be shortened.
The dose could also be adapted for the last 2 months if there was no spontaneous bleeding up to 4 months and the 2-month FVIII:C trough level was above
1.5% (reduction by 10%, if FVIII:C trough level at 2-month visit was between 1.6% and 2.0% or by 25%, if FVIII:C trough level >2%). FVIII:C, FVIII coag-

 model appeared to be appropriate. There was consid-
erable variation in half-life between patients, with a
range of 6.2–31.9 h (Fig. 2). Mean (SD) half-lives
were 15.1 (4.7) hours overall, 16.2 (5.5) hours for the
two-compartment group, 14.3 (3.1) hours for the one-
compartment group, and 12.2 (3.9) hours for the non-
compartment group.
Dosing intervals during personalized prophylaxis
with Nuwiq� for the 65 patients included in the effi-
cacy analyses are summarized in Table 2. The median
dosing interval during personalized prophylaxis was
3.5 days, with 57% of patients on ≤2 weekly dosing.
The recommended dosing interval was followed for
96.7% (3572/3695) of actual dosing intervals. The
median dosing interval was 3.5 days in the two- and
one-compartment model groups and 2.5 days in the
noncompartment group (Table 3). The percentage of
patients on twice weekly or less frequent dosing was
51% (18/35) in the two-compartment group, 74%
(17/23) in the one-compartment group and 29% (2/7)
in the noncompartment group (Table 3).
During the last 2 months of personalized prophy-
laxis,
the
median
weekly
prophylaxis
dose
was
reduced by 7.2% to 92.8 IU kg�1 compared with
100.0 IU kg�1 during standard prophylaxis (Table 4).
In patients dosed ≤2 weekly, median (IQR) weekly
dose during the last 2 months of personalized prophy-
laxis was 85.0 (73.6, 102.0) IU kg�1 compared with
99.0 (91.0, 114.2) IU kg�1 in patients dosed >2
weekly. The lowest possible median dose that could
have been given in the last two months of personal-
ized
prophylaxis,
based
on
FVIII:C
trough
level
>1.5% at 2 months and the absence of spontaneous
bleeds at 4 months, was 78.3 IU kg�1 in patients with
available trough measurements from samples taken
within the sampling time window (N = 19). This
would have corresponded to a 24% reduction in med-
ian dose compared with the first recommended regi-
men during personalized prophylaxis (102.6 IU) in
these 19 patients.
Mean (SD) FVIII trough levels after 2, 4 and
6 months
of
personalized
prophylaxis
were
3.4%
(4.0) [N = 19], 4.2% (7.0) [N = 24] and 2.7% (2.4)
[N = 20], respectively, in patients with available mea-
surements from samples taken within the sampling
time window.
Prevention of bleeds
During personalized prophylaxis (6.2 months), 73.8%
(48/65) of patients had no bleeds and 83.1% (54/65)
had no spontaneous bleeds. In the preceding standard

 prophylaxis phase (2.7 months), 76.9% (50/65) of
patients had no bleeds and 84.6% (55/65) had no
spontaneous bleeds.
ABRs during personalized prophylaxis by PK-model
group are shown in Table 5. For the overall popula-
tion (N = 65), median (IQR) ABRs were 0 (0, 1.9) for
all bleeds and 0 (0, 0) for spontaneous bleeds, trau-
matic bleeds and joint bleeds. Median (IQR) ABRs in
patients who received ≤2 doses per week (N = 37)
and in patients who received >2 doses per week
(N = 28) were 0 (0, 0) for all bleeds and for sponta-
neous bleeds.
Treatment of breakthrough bleeds
During the study, 95 breakthrough bleeds (46 during
standard prophylaxis and 49 during personalized pro-
phylaxis) occurred in 23 of 65 patients and all were
treated with at least one dose of Nuwiq�. The median
(range) total dose used for the treatment of a bleed
was 38.9 (11–617) IU kg�1 (mean (SD): 63.9 (81.1)
IU kg�1). The median number of infusions was 1.0
(range 1–18) (mean (SD) 1.7 (2.2)). For 88.4% of
bleeds, one or two infusions were sufficient to treat
the bleed. Efficacy ratings for the 95 bleeds were
excellent or good for 86 bleeds (90.5%), moderate for
eight bleeds (8.4%) and none for one bleed (1.1%).
All bleeds with a moderate efficacy rating were mod-
erate-to-major in severity. The bleed with the efficacy
rating of none was a moderate-to-major traumatic
bleed in the left ankle during standard prophylaxis.
The patient received eight infusions of Nuwiq� (four
of 33.3 IU kg�1 followed by four of 44.4 IU kg�1)
over six EDs and the bleed resolved without addi-
tional treatment. Efficacy ratings for the 49 bleeds
during personalized prophylaxis were excellent or
good for 45 bleeds (91.8%) and moderate for four
bleeds (8.2%).
Surgical prophylaxis
Three patients underwent three major surgical proce-
dures: an appendectomy (3956.5 IU kg�1, 76 infu-
sions);
a
plate
osteosynthesis
(1425 IU kg�1,
43
infusions); and a tenotomy (900.7 IU kg�1, 36 infu-
sions). Overall efficacy was rated as excellent for two
of the surgeries (plate osteosynthesis and tenotomy)
and good for the appendectomy. No intra-operative
infusions were required.
Safety
A total of 6612 infusions of Nuwiq� were adminis-
tered to 66 patients. During standard prophylaxis
(2.7 months), patients received a mean (SD) of 34.0
(8.2) infusions and a total dose of 1157.6 (307.7)

(6.2 months), patients received a mean (SD) of 58.8
(15.0) infusions and a total dose of 2574.4 (631.1)
IU kg�1.
One patient (1.5%) experienced malaise and dizzi-
ness after one infusion during standard prophylaxis
that were considered treatment related; both events
were nonserious and resolved. There were no unex-
pected or serious adverse drug reactions, no clinically
significant abnormalities in laboratory parameters and
no cases of thromboembolism. No FVIII inhibitors
were detected in any patient at any time during the
study.
Discussion
The NuPreviq study evaluated the efficacy and safety
of
a
patient-tailored
personalized
prophylaxis
approach with Nuwiq�, a 4th generation rFVIII pro-
tein produced in a human cell-line and without modi-
fication or protein fusion, in adult PTPs with severe
haemophilia A. The personalized prophylaxis regimen
was based on individual PK modelling for each patient
according to whether their PK profile most closely fit-
ted
a
two-,
one-
or
noncompartment
PK
model
(NuPreviq approach).
The mean ABR for all bleeds during 6-months of
personalized prophylaxis was 1.45 (median 0), which
compares with a mean ABR of 2.28 (median 0.9)
observed in a study of standard prophylaxis with
Nuwiq� in adult PTPs [24]. These results compare
favourably with studies with other FVIII products
[10,19,35,36] although differences in study designs
and
patient
populations
limit
direct
comparisons
between different studies. An ABR of 2.9 (median
1.6)
observed
in
a
study
evaluating
recombinant
FVIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIII-Fc) in an individualized
prophylactic regimen in which 67% of patients had
≤2 infusions per week [19], a mean ABR of 1.9 (me-
dian 2.0) for PK-tailored prophylaxis with a full-
length rFVIII derived from Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells [10], a mean ABR of 3.7 (median 1.9)
with twice weekly prophylaxis with pegylated full-
length rFVIII derived from CHO cells [35], and a
mean ABR of 3.27 (median 0) with twice weekly sin-
gle-chain rFVIII derived from CHO cells [36]. In addi-
tion, 73.8% of patients remained bleed-free (83.1%
free of spontaneous bleeds) during personalized pro-
phylaxis with Nuwiq� in the NuPreviq study. This
compares with 45% of patients in the rFVIII-Fc study
[19], 39.6% of patients treated with full-length pegy-
lated rFVIII [35], and 43% of patients treated with
single-chain rFVIII [36], in studies of a similar dura-
tion, and 26.5% of patients treated with full-length
rFVIII in a 1-year study [10].
Personalized prophylaxis with Nuwiq� enabled the
majority of patients (57%) to increase the dosing
interval from three times weekly or every other day
during standard prophylaxis to twice weekly or less
frequently during personalized prophylaxis. The med-
ian dosing interval in the personalized prophylaxis
phase was extended to 3.5 days with a decrease in
Table 5.

 FVIII consumption, which is similar to findings in
other trials evaluating individualized prophylaxis with
modified rFVIII [19,35,36]. The high FVIII trough
levels of 3.4%, 4.2% and 2.7% after 2, 4 and
6 months, respectively, of Nuwiq� treatment, together
with the low bleeding rates, support the accuracy of
individual PK modelling using the NuPreviq approach
to guide prophylaxis and optimize therapy. Moreover,
the study confirmed that there is considerable interpa-
tient variation in FVIII half-life with Nuwiq�, which
ranged from 6.2 to 31.9 h (mean 15.1 h) and is com-
mon across rFVIII products [29,30,32], and provides a
strong rationale for the PK-guided personalized pro-
phylaxis. The consistently low bleeding rates during
personalized
prophylaxis
using
the
NuPreviq
approach, irrespective of PK-model group or dosing
frequency (≤2 weekly or >2 weekly), supports its use
to determine individual dosing regimens for personal-
ized prophylaxis. In the NuPreviq study, blood sam-
ples were taken at 10 time points up to 72 h after
infusion. However, data indicate that six sampling
time points could be used to determine a personalized
prophylaxis regimen using the NuPreviq approach
[37].
Efficacy was rated as excellent or good for the
majority (91.8%) of the bleeds during personalized
prophylaxis. Three patients underwent major surg-
eries, for which efficacy was rated excellent or good.
There
were
no
product-related
serious
or
severe
adverse events. No FVIII inhibitors were detected in
any patient at any time during the study, consistent
with other studies of Nuwiq� in PTPs. A study evalu-
ating the immunogenicity of Nuwiq� in 100 previ-
ously untreated paediatric patients, who are at the
highest risk of inhibitor formation, is ongoing [38].
In conclusion, this study indicates that personalized
prophylaxis
with
Nuwiq�,
applying
individually
appropriate two-, one- or noncompartmental PK mod-
els (NuPreviq approach), provided bleeding protection
with 73.8% of patients bleed-free and 83.1% sponta-
neous bleed-free, which to our knowledge are the
highest bleed-free percentages published for personalized
prophylaxis. In addition, dosing interval was extended
to twice weekly infusions or less in 57% of patients and
the dose was decreased compared with standard pro-
phylaxis.
