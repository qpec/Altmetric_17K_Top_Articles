Purpose:
To evaluate the early implementation of synthesized 
two-dimensional (s2D) mammography in a population 
screened entirely with s2D and digital breast tomosynthe-
sis (DBT) (referred to as s2D/DBT) and compare recall 
rates and cancer detection rates to historic outcomes of 
digital mammography combined with DBT (referred to as 
digital mammography/DBT) screening. 
Materials and 
Methods:
This was an institutional review board–approved and 
HIPAA-compliant retrospective interpretation of prospec-
tively acquired data with waiver of informed consent. 
Compared were recall rates, biopsy rates, cancer detec-
tion rates, and radiation dose for 15 
571 women screened 
with digital mammography/DBT from October 1, 2011, to 
February 28, 2013, and 5366 women screened with s2D/
DBT from January 7, 2015, to June 30, 2015. Two-sample 
z tests of equal proportions were used to determine sta-
tistical significance.
Results:
Recall rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/
DBT was 7.1% versus 8.8%, respectively (P , .001). 
Biopsy rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/
DBT decreased (1.3% vs 2.0%, respectively; P = .001). 
There was no significant difference in cancer detection 
rate for s2D/DBT versus digital mammography/DBT (5.03 
of 1000 vs 5.45 of 1000, respectively; P = .72). The av-
erage glandular dose was 39% lower in s2D/DBT versus 
digital mammography/DBT (4.88 mGy vs 7.97 mGy, re-
spectively; P , .001).
Conclusion:
Screening with s2D/DBT in a large urban practice re-
sulted in similar outcomes compared with digital mam-
mography/DBT imaging. Screening with s2D/DBT allowed 
for the benefits of DBT with a decrease in radiation dose 
compared with digital mammography/DBT.

interpretation, which may have led to 
a selection bias (14,15).
The purpose of our study was to 
evaluate the early implementation of 
s2D mammography in a population 
screened entirely with s2D/DBT and 
compare recall rates and cancer de-
tection rates to historic outcomes of 
digital mammography/DBT screening. 
We hypothesized that there would be 
no difference in recall rates or cancer 
detection rates between groups.
Materials and Methods
Patient Data
Informed consent was waived for this 
Health Insurance Portability and Ac-
countability Act–compliant and insti-
tutional review board–approved ret-
rospective analysis of prospectively 
acquired data. We screened 15 
571 
women (mean age, 56.7 years) by us-
ing digital mammography/DBT from 
October 1, 2011, to February 28, 2013 
(Dimension; Hologic, Bedford, Mass). 
From January 7, 2015, to June 30, 
2015, 5366 women (mean age, 56.7 
years) were screened with s2D/DBT. 
All patients who were referred for 
breast cancer screening at our insti-
tution during each time-point were in-
cluded in our study populations.
screening should be performed at the 
lowest possible dose that maintains op-
timal benefits (10).
Synthesized two-dimensional (s2D) 
mammography, generated via slab re-
construction from the tomosynthe-
sis acquisition, was approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
in May 2013 as an alternative to dig-
ital mammography in DBT screening. 
When s2D mammography is used in 
the place of digital mammography, the 
dose received by patients is only from 
the DBT study; this was estimated to 
be approximately 45% lower than that 
of a combination digital mammography 
and DBT (referred to as digital mam-
mography/DBT) study (11). There 
have been a few reader studies and 
limited prospective studies that com-
pared the performance of s2D mam-
mography versus digital mammogra-
phy/DBT in a clinical setting (11–15). 
Results were mixed: two prospective 
studies and one reader study showed 
similar performance between both 
combination modalities (11,13–15), 
whereas another reader study showed 
lower sensitivity and comparable spec-
ificity in s2D mammography and DBT 
(referred to as s2D/DBT) versus digital 
mammography/DBT. In one prospec-
tive study, symptomatic patients were 
included in the s2D mammography and 
digital mammography/DBT screening 
group so this cohort was not a true 
screening population (11). In another 
analysis, digital mammography was 
used to select cancer cases for reader

Advances in Knowledge
 
n The cancer detection rate for 
synthesized two-dimensional 
(s2D) mammography with dig-
ital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)
(referred to as s2D/DBT) was 
not significantly different com-
pared with digital mammog-
raphy and DBT (referred to as 
digital mammography/DBT) 
screening (5.03 of 1000 women 
screened vs 5.45 of 1000 
screened, respectively; P = .72), 
which maintained one of the 
most important benefits of DBT 
screening.
 
n Cancers per biopsy performed 
were higher in s2D/DBT com-
pared with digital mammog-
raphy/DBT screening (38.6% vs 
27.0%, respectively; P = .053).
 
n The recall rate for s2D/DBT sig-
nificantly decreased compared 
with digital mammography/DBT 
screening (7.1% vs 8.8%, re-
spectively; P , .001).
 
n The recall rate for calcified  
lesions and asymmetries was 
lower with s2D/DBT compared 
with digital mammography/DBT 
screening (1.1% vs 1.6%  
[P = .02] and 3.2% vs 4.5%  
[P , .001], respectively).
 
n The average glandular dose was 
39% lower in s2D/DBT com-
pared with digital mammog-
raphy/DBT screening (4.88 mGy 
vs 7.97 mGy; P , .001).
Implications for Patient Care
 
n Because of the reduction in radi-
ation dose, the replacement of 
digital mammography with s2D 
mammography is beneficial to 
women who undergo breast 
cancer screening.
 
n The results from this early imple-
mentation study demonstrate 
that s2D mammography may be 
an acceptable replacement to 
digital mammography/DBT in 
screening because reduced recall 
rates and cancer detection rates 
are maintained.
D
igital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) 
combined with full-field digital 
mammography decreases recall 
rates and improves invasive breast car-
cinoma detection rates compared with 
screening with digital mammography 
alone in both reader studies and pro-
spective clinical trials (1–5). Although 
it is beneficial to outcomes, the addi-
tion of DBT to digital mammography 
screening increases radiation dose to 
patients (6–8) even though phantom 
doses still fall within the Mammography 
Quality Standards Act regulation limit 
of 3.0 mGy (9). Ideally, mammography

factors with physical measurements of 
air kerma from each system were used 
to calculate the average glandular dose 
per image. The average glandular dose 
per study was then calculated from 
the per-image doses summed between 
views and averaged between breasts 
(6). Differences in average glandular 
dose and breast thickness were as-
sessed with two-sided t tests for contin-
uous variables.
Results
Patient characteristics of both screen-
ing groups are compared in Table 1. 
There were no clinically relevant dif-
ferences in the two cohorts relative to 
age (P = .99) or race (P = .01). There 
was a significant difference in breast 
density between the groups with lower 
subjective assessment of density on 
s2D/DBT images compared with the 
digital mammography/DBT images (P 
, .001). There was also a significant 
difference in breast thickness between 
the groups with greater breast thick-
ness in s2D/DBT (P , .001). The s2D/
DBT group was also more likely to un-
dergo baseline screenings or have no 
previous studies available for compari-
son (P = .002). 
Recalls from the s2D/DBT and dig-
ital mammography/DBT cohorts were 
analyzed. Recall rate was significantly 
lower for s2D/DBT than with digital 
mammography/DBT (7.1% vs 8.8%, 
respectively; P , .001). There was no 
change in recalls for the finding types of 
masses (s2D/DBT vs digital mammog-
raphy/DBT, 2.4% vs 2.7%, respectively; 
P = .31) or architectural distortion 
(s2D/DBT vs digital mammography/
DBT, 1.1% vs 1.0%, respectively; P = 
.70), while significant decreases were 
observed for asymmetries (s2D/DBT 
vs digital mammography/DBT, 3.2% vs 
4.5%, respectively; P  .001) and calci-
fications (s2D/DBT vs digital mammog-
raphy/DBT, 1.1% vs 1.6%, respectively; 
P = .02). There was also a significant 
decrease in technical recalls or recalls 
because of poor positioning, motion, 
or other technical factors (s2D/DBT vs 
digital mammography/DBT, 0.1% vs 
0.2%, respectively; P = .03) (Table 2).
Breast density was recorded as the 
following: almost entirely fatty, scat-
tered fibroglandular densities, hetero-
geneously dense, or extremely dense 
(20). If more than one finding type 
was mentioned at the time of recall, 
both were recorded. Percentage recall 
rate, cancer detection rate per 1000 
patients screened, and positive predic-
tive values were calculated.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in demographics, breast 
density, and the availability of prior 
mammograms between women re-
called after undergoing digital mam-
mography/DBT versus s2D/DBT were 
assessed by using x2 tests for categor-
ical variables and two-sided t tests for 
continuous variables. Two-sample z 
tests of equal proportions were used 
to compare the rates of specific find-
ings that prompted recall between the 
two cohorts and rates of screening out-
comes. All statistical analyses in this 
study were performed in Stata 13.1 
(Stata Statistical Software Release 13; 
StataCorp, College Station, Tex), and 
all statistical tests were two sided at 
the standard a significance level of .05. 
P values less than .05 were considered 
to indicate statistical significance. Post-
hoc power analysis was conducted by 
using the PASS 14 statistical software 
package (PASS 14 Power Analysis and 
Sample Size Software; NCSS, Kaysville, 
Utah; www.ncss.com/software/pass).
Dose Calculations
A custom dose-tracking system was 
used to extract the exposure factors 
from the Digital Communications in 
Medicine (known as DICOM) header 
of the digital mammography and DBT 
images and store them in a relational 
database. The system consists of a cus-
tom DICOM service class provider and 
an intermediate data-cleaning compo-
nent that maps the meta-data into a 
structured query language database by 
using an object relational mapper. Var-
ious DICOM meta-data were recorded, 
including the compressed breast thick-
ness, and the radiographic factors (ki-
lovolt, milliampere-second, filter mate-
rial, and exposure). The radiographic 
The screening results were accessed 
through the electronic medical record 
(RIS, GE Centricity, Milwaukee, Wis; 
and Epic Systems Corporation, Madi-
son, Wis). Studies were interpreted on 
dedicated workstations by one of six 
radiologists who specialized in breast 
imaging (including E.F.C., S.P.W., and 
E.S.M.) with experience that ranged 
from 8 to 26 years (median, 17 years; 
mean, 16.5 years). DBT imaging was 
added to the practice in September 
2011. Our institution previously pub-
lished results that compared the digital 
mammography/DBT group with 10 
728 
patients from a digital mammography–
only screening population (2,3,16–19).
Image Acquisition
Technologic specifications for both the 
digital mammography and s2D mam-
mographic examinations were similar 
and are as follows: The pixel size for 
digital mammography images is 0.070 
3 0.070 mm. The pixel size for s2D var-
ies depending on breast size and plane 
of reconstruction, but is approximately 
0.100 3 0.100 mm. The larger pixel 
size arises because s2D is produced 
from reconstructed DBT images. As 
a result, the spatial resolution of s2D 
is slightly reduced compared with the 
digital mammography images (approx-
imately 5.8 line pairs per millimeter vs 
7.6 line pairs per millimeter measured 
at the midplane of a 5-cm breast).
Data Acquisition
Bilateral craniocaudal and mediolateral 
oblique images were obtained for each 
screening study. Patients were given 
a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data 
System (known as BI-RADS) score of 1 
(negative), 2 (benign), or 0 (additional 
imaging needed) for each screening 
study. Patients who were given a BI-
RADS score of 0 were reviewed in the 
digital mammography/DBT and s2D/
DBT groups. Patient age, race, breast 
density, history of prior mammogram, 
lesion subtype that prompted recall 
(calcification, mass, asymmetry, ar-
chitectural distortion, or technical 
recall), final BI-RADS assessment cat-
egory, and biopsy outcome, if appli-
cable, were recorded for each study.

value 1 (s2D/DBT vs digital mammogra-
phy/DBT, 7.1% vs 6.2%, respectively; 
P = .548). Positive predictive value 2 
trended toward an increase (s2D/DBT 
vs digital mammography/DBT, 35.5% 
vs 24.7%, respectively; P = .054). Pos-
itive predictive value 3 trended toward 
an increase (s2D/DBT vs digital mam-
mography/DBT, 38.6% vs 27.0%, re-
spectively; P = .053) (Table 3).
A post hoc secondary power analysis 
was performed to evaluate the power of 
our sample size to test for noninferior-
ity with an a level of .025. We had 80% 
power to detect noninferiority from 
our historic recall rate of 8.8% with a 
margin of 1.257%, approximately the 
difference between our historical rate 
and the benchmark national average 
for recall rate of 10%, which provided 
a noninferiority threshold of 10.057%. 
Our findings suggest s2D/DBT, with a 
recall rate of 7.1% (95% confidence 
interval: 6.4%, 7.8%), could be con-
sidered noninferior to digital mammog-
raphy/DBT because the upper limit of 
the 95% confidence interval for the dif-
ference between s2D/DBT and digital 
mammography/DBT recall rates (95% 
confidence interval: –2.5%, –0.88%) is 
less than the stated noninferiority mar-
gin of 1.257%.
Regarding biopsy rate, our sam-
ple size provided 80% power to de-
tect noninferiority by using a margin 
of 0.63% from our baseline historical 
rate (2%), which provided a noninfe-
riority threshold of 2.63% that is also 
below the national recommended limit 
of biopsy of 3%. Given this noninferior-
ity threshold, we found that biopsy rate 
of s2D/DBT (observed biopsy rate of 
1.3% [95% confidence interval: 1.0%, 
1.6%]) may also be considered a non-
inferior alternative to digital mammog-
raphy/DBT because the upper limit of 
the 95% confidence interval for the dif-
ference between s2D/DBT and digital 
mammography/DBT biopsy rates (95% 
confidence interval: –1.1%, –0.32%) 
falls below the noninferiority margin 
of 0.63%. However, the above findings 
need to be prospectively validated be-
cause the present study is underpow-
ered to detect noninferiority in can-
cer detection rate and, subsequently,

s2D cohort was also more likely to not 
have undergone baseline screening or 
have previous studies available, despite 
attempts to retrieve earlier studies. 
While the reason for this is unknown, 
this should increase recall rates in the 
s2D population because women at 
baseline screening or without previous 
mammograms have higher recall rates 
(16).
Our analysis demonstrated de-
creased recall rates with s2D/DBT 
compared with digital mammography/
DBT. When s2D mammography was 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, there were concerns 
that it would lead to increased recalls 
for calcification-only lesions (12). Liga-
ments are enhanced in the s2D recon-
struction algorithm and may appear 
as radio-opaque, calcific-like lesions 
(17). However, our results showed a 
decrease in recalls secondary to calci-
fications. This may be secondary to the 
ability of our readers to better evalu-
ate calcifications while reviewing DBT 
after potential calcifications are ob-
served with s2D. Long-term follow-up 
is needed to ensure that clinically sig-
nificant calcific lesions are not passed 
as normal structures.
There was also a decrease of recalls 
secondary to asymmetries. This may be 
secondary to our increased experience 
with DBT and may not be related to 
s2D or digital mammography because 
there was a 2-year difference between 
both cohorts. Additionally, there was a 
decrease of recalls secondary to tech-
nical factors. This may be secondary to 
increased technologist familiarity with 
the DBT equipment over time. In ad-
dition, s2D/DBT may be less sensitive 
to patient motion because both the 
synthetic image and the DBT images 
were reconstructed, which made linear 
and feature sharpness more difficult to 
detect.
The recall rates for architectural dis-
tortions and masses were similar. This is 
likely because both masses and distor-
tions are best resolved on DBT images, 
rather than on digital mammograms or 
s2D mammographic images. Overall, 
there was no increase in any recall find-
ing type and overall recall rate decreased,

positive predictive value because the 
event is rare and proportions are low.
The average glandular dose per 
study was compared between s2D/DBT 
and digital mammography/DBT. The 
total dose was 39% lower in s2D/DBT 
compared with digital mammography/
DBT (4.88 mGy vs 7.97 mGy, respec-
tively; P , .001). For digital mammog-
raphy/DBT, the average digital mam-
mography and DBT doses were 3.77 
mGy and 4.20 mGy, respectively. The 
s2D/DBT dose is attributable to the 
DBT images only (Table 4).
Discussion
Digital mammography/DBT screening 
decreases recall rates and increases 
cancer detection rates compared with 
digital mammography alone. Early stud-
ies that evaluated s2D mammography 
found an initial drop in cancer detec-
tion when digital mammography was 
not available, though decreased recall 
remained (11–13,15). Our study indi-
cates that s2D/DBT screening main-
tains overall cancer detection rates 
while reducing recall rates and signif-
icantly reducing radiation dose com-
pared with digital mammography/DBT 
screening.
Our cohorts were well matched 
for age and race. There was a signif-
icant difference between our cohorts 
in breast density, with a trend toward 
decreased density in the s2D/DBT 
group. Breast density is a subjective 
assessment; decreased density may be 
a perceptive difference on the basis of 
the assessment of s2D mammography. 
Further research will evaluate whether 
the observed density differences persist 
after several years of s2D/DBT screen-
ing. Breast thickness was statistically 
different between both cohorts, but the 
actual difference was only 3 mm and 
thus is likely not clinically relevant; the 
statistical difference observed is sec-
ondary to our large sample sizes. Our

reduced compared with each year of 
DM/DBT screening (P , .001). Also, 
our overall cancer detection rate per 
1000 women screened with s2D/DBT 
is not significantly different in each of 
the 3 consecutive years of screening (P 
= .68, .52, and .38, respectively). With 
these limitations, our study presents 
data from the prospective evaluation of 
an entire population screened with only 
s2D/DBT. Our data suggest that replac-
ing DM with s2D mammography in DBT 
breast cancer screening yields screening 
outcomes similar to combination DM/
DBT with a significantly lower radiation 
dose. The use of DBT in clinical prac-
tice is rapidly increasing, with some 
estimates now as high as 50% of prac-
tices that use DBT in the United States 
(21). Thus, this study has potential for 
clinical effect by providing preliminary 
evidence for a new technology that can 
reduce radiation exposure while main-
taining improved breast cancer screen-
ing outcomes.

which suggests a possible learning curve 
over time.
Our preliminary data showed a 
decrease in the number of biopsies 
performed, but a similar rate of both 
cancer detection and cancers detected 
per number of patients recalled. We 
found no statistical difference between 
the proportions of invasive cancer ver-
sus ductal carcinoma in situ detected in 
each group. Thus, the benefit of DBT 
for increased cancer detection remains 
with s2D/DBT, which contradicts an 
earlier report (15).
Screening with s2D/DBT reduced 
dose compared with digital mammog-
raphy/DBT. The increase in DBT dose 
in the s2D cohort relative to the DBT 
dose in the digital mammography/DBT 
cohort is attributable to the practice of 
performing extra DBT views for large 
breasts in the s2D/DBT mode. Previ-
ously in the digital mammography/DBT 
mode, tiling of additional areas of tissue 
in larger breasts was performed with 
digital mammography, not with DBT. 
The difference is also in part because 
of the increase in breast thickness in 
the s2D cohort.
Our study had limitations. We only 
evaluated the use of s2D mammography 
at a single institution and with a single 
vendor, and we have not yet performed 
subanalyses on the basis of breast den-
sities and thickness. Further research 
is necessary to see if this modality is 
suitable for women of all breast den-
sities and thicknesses because the ap-
pearance of s2D mammography may 
vary greatly according to these factors 
(17). Additionally, we do not have ad-
equate follow-up data to calculate the 
rate of false-negative findings at s2D/
DBT screenings to ensure that this 
new technology is not missing cancers, 
as was suggested (15). Finally, our co-
horts are from different periods, and 
s2D mammography was implemented 
after several years of experience inter-
preting DBT examinations. This may 
make our findings less generalizable 
to groups that are just implementing 
DBT. However, we recently published 
(18) data from 3 consecutive years of 
DBT screening from 2011 to 2014; our 
s2D/DBT recall rate is still significantly
