Abstract
Background
Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated in Uganda in 1947, is currently spreading rapidly through
South America and the Caribbean. In Brazil, infection has been linked with microcephaly
and other serious complications, leading to declaration of a public health emergency of
international concern; however, there currently are only limited data on the virus (and its
possible sources and manifestations) in the Caribbean.
Methods
From May, 2014-February, 2015, in conjunction with studies of chikungunya (CHIKV) and
dengue (DENV) virus infections, blood samples were collected from children in the Gres-
sier/Leogane region of Haiti who presented to a school clinic with undifferentiated febrile ill-
ness. Samples were initially screened by RT-PCR for CHIKV and DENV, with samples
negative in these assays further screened by viral culture.
Findings
Of 177 samples screened, three were positive for ZIKV, confirmed by viral sequencing;
DENV-1 was also identified in culture from one of the three positive case patients. Patients
were from two different schools and 3 different towns, with all three cases occurring within a
single week, consistent with the occurrence of an outbreak in the region. Phylogenetic anal-
ysis of known full genome viral sequences demonstrated a close relationship with ZIKV
from Brazil; additional analysis of the NS5 gene, for which more sequences are currently

 available, showed the Haitian strains clustering within a monophyletic clade distinct from
Brazilian, Puerto Rican and Guatemalan sequences, with all part of a larger clade including
isolates from Easter Island. Phylogeography also clarified that at least three major African
sub-lineages exist, and confirmed that the South American epidemic is most likely to have
originated from an initial ZIKV introduction from French Polynesia into Easter Island, and
then to the remainder of the Americas.
Conclusions
ZIKV epidemics in South America, as well as in Africa, show complex dissemination pat-
terns. The virus appears to have been circulating in Haiti prior to the first reported cases in
Brazil. Factors contributing to transmission and the possible linkage of this early Haitian out-
break with microcephaly remain to be determined.
Author Summary
Zika virus is currently spreading rapidly through the Americas, including the Caribbean,
where it has emerged as a major public health problem due to the linkage with birth
defects, including microcephaly. We report the isolation of Zika virus from 3 children in
rural Haiti in December, 2014, as part of a study of acute undifferentiated febrile illness
that was being conducted by our research group; from one of these children, we also iso-
lated dengue virus serotype 1. On analysis of nucleotide sequence data from these and
Zika strains from other locales, the South American/Haitian sequences cluster within the
Asian clade and clearly branch out from a sequence circulating in Easter Island, which
originated, in turn, from French Polynesia. On further analysis of one specific gene
sequence for which more data were available, there appeared to be slight separation of Hai-
tian strains and the strains from Brazil, Suriname, Puerto Rico and Guatemala, with
molecular clock analysis suggesting that Zika virus was present in Haiti as early as mid-
2013. These findings raise questions about the origin of Zika virus in the Caribbean, and
subsequent patterns of circulation of the virus within the Americas.
Introduction
Zika is a mosquito-borne flavivirus initially isolated in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 [1].
There were periodic human cases reported from Africa and Asia in the intervening decades,
but it was not until 2007 that a major epidemic was reported, on Yap Island, Federated States
of Micronesia [2]. Zika infections were subsequently identified in other parts of Asia, with a
shift toward the Americas presaged by an outbreak on Easter Island in May, 2014 [3]. In
March, 2015, cases were identified in Bahia, Brazil [4], with subsequent rapid spread through
multiple Brazilian states [1,5], and other countries in South America and the Caribbean [1,5]:
as of January, 2016, locally-transmitted cases had been reported by the Pan American Health
Organization in Puerto Rico and 19 countries/territories in the Americas.
Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) has traditionally been associated with asymptomatic or
mild illness. Clinical manifestations, when they occur, include acute onset of fever, headache,
maculopapular rash, arthralgias, myalgias, and/or non-purulent conjunctivitis [1,2]. In an out-
break in French Polynesia in 2013–14, there were, for the first time, reports of neurological and

 auto-immune complications, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, in the setting of co-circulating
dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses [6,7]. With the progression of the Brazil-
ian outbreak in 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health noted a striking concurrent increase in
the number of infants born with microcephaly in areas with ZIKV transmission. Multiple sub-
sequent studies have provided further documentation of the link between ZIKV and micro-
cephaly and other birth defects, as well as with Guillain-Barré syndrome [8–14]. Based on the
“strongly suspected” causal link between Zika virus and the observed fetal brain abnormalities,
WHO has declared the current Zika epidemic a “public health emergency of international con-
cern” [15].
As a step in monitoring and understanding spread of the epidemic, we report here the isola-
tion of ZIKV from three children in Haiti in December, 2014, before the first reported Brazilian
cases.
Materials and Methods
Our group has been involved in studies of CHIKV and DENV transmission in Haiti since May,
2014, when CHIKV swept across the island of Hispaniola. Work was done in collaboration
with the Christianville Foundation, which operates 4 schools in the Gressier/Leogane region of
Haiti (some 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince) with a total of approximately 1,250 students from
pre-kindergarten to grade 12; students attending the school receive care at no cost in an outpa-
tient school clinic staffed by a physician and two nurses [16]. As part of these studies, UF has
protocols for collection of diagnostic blood samples from children presenting to the school
clinic with acute undifferentiated febrile illness (i.e., febrile illness with no localizing signs, such
as would be expected with pneumonia, urinary tract infections, etc.).
Blood samples were obtained from a total of one hundred seventy-seven (n = 177) Haitian
children presenting with a history of acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses between May, 2014,
and February, 2015. Blood smears were prepared for microscopic analyses for malaria para-
sites. To obtain plasma for virologic analysis, whole blood (5 mL) was collected into purple top
(K2EDTA) tubes (Becton, Dickinson, and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), the collected
blood centrifuged to pellet red and white blood cells, and the resulting plasma transferred to
sterile screw-top vials and stored at -70°C pending tests.
For the initial CHIKV and DENV screens, vRNA was extracted from virions in the plasma
using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The extracted vRNAs were
tested using primers described by Lanciotti et al [17] for CHIKV and Santiago et al [18] for
DENV types 1–4. Many specimens were positive for CHIKV and DENV1 or DENV4 vRNA
(data to be presented elsewhere). Those negative for CHIKV and DENV 1–4 vRNA were also
tested with a universal primer system for flavivirus: RT-PCR system Flav100F-200R [19]. No
virus-specific amplicons were generated by the latter approach. Samples negative or borderline
in the above assays were screened in a variety of mammalian cell lines inoculated with aliquots
of plasma; detailed methods are provided in supplemental material, as are methods for trans-
mission microscopy.
Detection and sequencing of Zika virus RNA in spent cell media
As virus-specific CPE were observed in LLC-MK2 and Vero E6 cells inoculated with plasma,
but the identity of the agent unknown, spent cell growth media was treated with cyanase nucle-
ase to degrade nucleic acids external to that packaged (and thus protected) in virions using a
Nucleic Acid Removal Kit (RiboSolutions, Inc., Cedar Creek, Texas), and vRNA once again
extracted from the treated material using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. A panel of PCR and
RT-PCR tests were performed; for RT-PCR, first-strand synthesis was performed using

 random 9-mers and Accuscript High Fidelity 1st strand cDNA kit (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). The presence of flavivirus RNA was detected using the Flav100F-200R, and
Zika virus RNA effectively detected [20] using RT-PCR systems ZIKVF9027-ZIKVR9197c
[21], 9271–9373 [22], and 835 – 911c [17]. For confirmation, PCR amplicons were purified
and sequenced.
Sequencing of the complete Zika virus genome of one isolate (from the first patient), desig-
nated Haiti/1225/2014, was accomplished using a genome walking strategy with the PCR prim-
ers described in S1 Table. Briefly, targeted overlapping sequences (approximately 800 bp
amplicons) were amplified using Accuscript High Fidelity reverse transcriptase in the presence
of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX), followed by PCR with Phusion Poly-
merase (New England Biolabs) with denaturation steps performed at 98°C. To obtain the 50
and 30 ends of the viral genome, a 50 and 30 system for the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends
(RACE) was used per the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
PCR amplicons were purified, sequenced bidirectionally using Sanger Sequencing, and the
sequences assembled with the aid of Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software v2.1 (Gene
Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The GenBank accession number is KU509998.
Phylogenetic analysis
All available ZIKV nucleotide sequences were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/) and four data sets were assembled (S1 Table) using the following inclusion criteria:
(1) sequences were published in peer-review journals; (2) known sampling time; (3) city/state
was known and clearly established in the original publication. The first data set included all
ZIKV complete genome sequences available in NCBI (23 sequences) and the Haiti complete
genome sequence obtained in the present study. The second data set included 109 NS5 gene
region reference sequences as well as NS5 sequences of the three Haitian isolates obtained in
the present study. The third data set included 58 ENV gene region reference sequences as well
as ENV sequences of the three Haitian isolates obtained in the present study. The fourth data
set included 21 NS3 gene region reference sequences as well as the NS3 sequence of the Haitian
isolate fully sequenced in the present study. Sequences in each dataset were aligned using Clus-
talW [23] followed by manual optimization using Bioedit [24]. The best fitting nucleotide sub-
stitution model for each data set was chosen in accordance with the results of the hierarchical
likelihood ratio test (HLRT) implemented with the Modeltest software version 3.7 [25].
Detailed phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods are included in the supplemental material.
In brief, the phylogenetic signal in each data set of aligned nucleotide sequences was investigated
by likelihood mapping, which evaluates the tree-like signal in all possible groups of four
sequences (quartets) [26];. The NS5 data set, which included the largest number of sequences
and the largest number of phylogenetic informative sites (S1 Table), was used to investigate
ZIKV phylogeographic patterns with the Bayesian coalescent framework implemented in Beast v
1.8 [27]. The maximum likelihood credibility (MCC) tree was chosen from the posterior distribu-
tion of trees with the TreeAnnotator program in the BEAST package. Statistical support for
branching patterns in the MCC tree was obtained by calculating the posterior probability along
each internal branch. The MCC tree with reconstructed ancestral states (ancestral locations
inferred by Bayesian phylogeography) was manually edited in FigTree for display purposes.
Ethics statement
The protocol for sample collection was approved by the University of Florida IRB and the Hai-
tian National IRB. Written parental informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians
of all study participants.

 Results
Zika virus was identified in plasma from three students seen in the Christianville Foundation
Schools clinic. Patient #1 (described below) appears to have been infected simultaneously with
DENV-1. The three case patients were from two different schools within the four-school Chris-
tianville school system; all lived in different towns/neighborhoods, within a radius of approxi-
mately 20 miles. All case patients presented within a one-week period in December, 2014.
Cases of DENV-1 had been identified among children in the school clinics in the weeks before
occurrence of the ZIKV cases, which, in turn, were followed by a small cluster of DENV-4
cases.
The first patient was a 15 year-old boy who presented to the clinic on December 12, 2014,
with a history of subjective fever, headache, and generalized arthralgias, myalgias and asthenia.
When seen, temperature was 37 degrees C, with a pulse of 92 and respiratory rate of 24, weight
51.5 Kg. He had no rash, and physical exam was unremarkable. The second patient was a 7
year-old girl who was seen on December 15, 2014 at the clinic for subjective nocturnal fever,
abdominal pain, anorexia, and cough. Temperature was 37 degrees C, pulse 116, RR 28, and
weight 22.8 Kg. There was no rash, and physical exam was again unremarkable. The third
patient was an asymptomatic 4 year-old boy who came in December 17, 2014 for follow up
after being treated for tonsillitis on November 25, when he had presented with a fever of 39
degrees C. In none of the cases would it have been possible to have identified the illness as a
ZIKV infection based on clinical presentation, rather than DENV or CHIKV (and, as indicated,
one child was simultaneously infected with DENV). All patients received supportive care for
reported symptoms, in keeping with standard practices within the clinic.
In tissue culture, viral agents from all three patients induced subtle CPE within 4–8 days
post-inoculation of human (A549, HeLa, and MRC-5) and more pronounced CPE in simian
(LLC-MK2 and Vero E6) cells incubated at either 33° and 37°C. Prior to cell death, the CPE
consisted of perinuclear vacuoles (Fig 1). Electron microscopy revealed features typical of flavi-
virus-infected cells, such as the formation of paracrystalline arrays/convoluted membranes (Fig
2A), crystalline arrays of nascent virus cores in association with double-membrane vesicles (Fig
2B), multi-membraned “whorls” (autophagosomes), individual 55–59 nm vesicles containing
40 nm virus particles, and virus particles in packets. As mentioned (Materials and Methods),
direct tests of the plasma sample using RT-PCR system Flav100F-200R yielded negative results.

 However, specific amplicons were obtained when vRNA from cyanase-treated spent media
from LLC-MK2 or Vero cells were tested with the same primers. On sequence analysis, viral
agents from all three patients were identified as ZIKV.
On phylogenetic analysis, likelihood mapping showed that all data sets (full genome align-
ment and gene-specific alignments) displayed relatively low phylogenetic noise (<20%, S2
Table) and no recombination signal was detected. The full genome alignment was, as expected,
the one with the lowest phylogenetic noise (0.3%), while the NS5 alignment contained the
highest number of informative sites, as well as the largest number of available sequences (S2
Table). Therefore, these two data sets were used to investigate further the phylogenetic and
phylogeographic patterns of ZIKV. Maximum likelihood (ML) (Fig 3) and Neighbor-joining
(NJ) (S1 Fig) trees inferred from full genome sequences consistently show two major ZIKV
clades: one including African, the other one including Asian, South American and the Haitian
strains. In the ML tree (Fig 3), the earliest lineage in the African clade leads to a Ugandan
strain, in agreement with the scenario of ZIKV emergence in the Eastern African country [1].
Moreover, both ML and NJ trees show three highly supported monophyletic clades within the
African lineage, indicating a somewhat more complex pattern than a split between West Afri-
can and Nigerian strains, as recently described [17, 28]. Indeed, one clade includes Nigeria/Sen-
egal sequences; a second one includes only Central Africa strains, while a third one includes
two well-supported sub-clades, one with Ugandan and the other with Senegalese strains. South
American/Haitian sequences cluster within the Asian clade and clearly branch out from a
sequence circulating in Easter Island, which originated in turn from French Polynesia. The
Haitian sequence clusters with a Brazilian sequence in a monophyletic clade related, in turn, to
sequences from Suriname and the recently isolated strains from Guatemala and Puerto Rico
[29] (Fig 3).
The pattern is confirmed by the Bayesian phylogeographic analysis showing the Asian ori-
gin of the South American sequences (Figs 4 and S2), as well as the close phylogenetic relation-
ship between Haitian, Brazilian, Suriname and Puerto Rican strains, clustering within a larger
clade of isolates from Easter Island. While not statistically significant, this latter analysis, based

 on the NS5 region, does show slight separation of Haitian strains and the strains from Brazil,
Suriname, Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The molecular clock calibration indeed shows that the
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Haitian clade existed at least one year earlier
(mid-2013, 95% high posterior density interval December 2012, June 2013) than the other
South American lineages with the exception of the Easter Island (Chile) strains, which appear
to be the oldest (Fig 4). The MRCA of the Asian lineage dates back to 1956 (95% high posterior
density interval 1954–1958), while ZIKV MRCA in Africa circulated, consistently with previ-
ous estimates [27], since at least the early 1900s (95% high posterior density interval 1890–
1925).
Discussion
Our data are consistent with the occurrence of an outbreak of Zita virus infection in rural areas
of Haiti west of Port-au-Prince in December of 2014. Virus was isolated from three students,
coming from two different schools and different towns, suggesting that the infection was

 relatively widespread in the community. In keeping with prior descriptions of ZIKV infection
[2], illness was mild. Two patients reported subjective fevers prior to presentation at the clinic,
but were afebrile on exam (possibly due to use of local herbal antipyretics); the third patient
had had a temperature of 39 degrees three weeks before (diagnosed as tonsillitis), but was
asymptomatic at the time of blood collection. However, the outbreak was tightly bounded in
time, with all cases occurring within a single week; we maintained similar surveillance methods
across a 10 month period, and this one week was the only time that ZIKV was isolated. In keep-
ing with reports from French Polynesia, cases occurred at a time when there was co-circulation
of CHIKV and DENV, with cases immediately preceded by a cluster of DENV-1 cases (with
both DENV-1 and ZIKV isolated from the first patient identified), and followed by DENV-4.
Officially, no cases of ZIKV infection were reported by the Haitian Ministry of Public
Health and Population (MSPP) until January 6, 2016, when 5 cases were confirmed in patients
in the metropolitan Port-au-Prince area, based on RT-PCR assays performed at the Caribbean

 Public Health Agency “CARPHA” Laboratory at Trinidad and Tobago. While it is difficult to
assemble an accurate timeline for Zika in Haiti, given the close similarity in symptoms with
DENV and CHIKV cases and their apparent co-circulation, we would hypothesize that there
was an initial “wave” of ZIKV cases in the late fall of 2014 in the Leogane/Gressier region, pos-
sibly emanating from near-by Port-au-Prince. Case numbers may have been reduced by rela-
tively low rainfall amounts at that time, with persistence in the population and, in the setting of
heavy rains in the fall of 2015, occurrence of a larger epidemic in the fall of 2015/spring of
2016. Alternatively, there may have been a reintroduction of the virus in late 2015; analysis of
additional sequence data, from Haiti as well as from other countries, will be necessary to recon-
struct the geographic progression of strains.
Our phylogenetic analysis highlights the relative indolence of the global Zika epidemic prior
to its introduction into Asia and the south Pacific in 2007. In agreement with previous reports,
the virus probably emerged in Africa at the beginning of the 20th century [28], where it diversi-
fied in several regional sub epidemics that, according to our analysis, span the entire equatorial
Africa from Uganda, to Central Africa to Senegal. ZIKV Asian lineages, on the other hand, are
of more recent origin, dating back 50–60 years ago, and the recent epidemic outbreaks in South
America are probably the result of a limited introduction from French Polynesia via Easter
Island no more than 3–4 year ago. The factors responsible for the rapid spread of the virus, and
it’s apparent trophism for neural tissue and ability to cause severe birth defects [10–12], remain
to be determined. The close association of ZIKV with the regional CHIKV epidemic, and epi-
demics of DENV, as we observed in Haiti, raises questions about immunologic interactions
among these viruses, and/or the possibility that co-infection facilitates viral transmission or
severity. Our observations highlight the critical ongoing need for careful epidemiologic and
basic science research to guide public health interventions in Haiti and elsewhere where ZIKV
is now epidemic.
