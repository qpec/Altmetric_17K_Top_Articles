Background—Self-management interventions are widely implemented in the care for patients with heart failure (HF). 
However, trials show inconsistent results, and whether specific patient groups respond differently is unknown. This 
individual patient data meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of self-management interventions in patients with HF and 
whether subgroups of patients respond differently.
Methods and Results—A systematic literature search identified randomized trials of self-management interventions. Data 
from 20 studies, representing 5624 patients, were included and analyzed with the use of mixed-effects models and Cox 
proportional-hazard models, including interaction terms. Self-management interventions reduced the risk of time to the 
combined end point of HF-related hospitalization or all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.71–0.89), time to HF-related hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.92), and improved 12-month HF-related 
quality of life (standardized mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00–0.30). Subgroup analysis revealed a protective effect of 
self-management on the number of HF-related hospital days in patients <65 years of age (mean, 0.70 versus 5.35 days; 
interaction P=0.03). Patients without depression did not show an effect of self-management on survival (hazard ratio for 
all-cause mortality, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06), whereas in patients with moderate/severe depression, self-management 
reduced survival (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06–1.83, interaction P=0.01).
Conclusions—This study shows that self-management interventions had a beneficial effect on time to HF-related 
hospitalization or all-cause death and HF-related hospitalization alone and elicited a small increase in HF-related 
quality of life. The findings do not endorse limiting self-management interventions to subgroups of patients with HF, 
but increased mortality in depressed patients warrants caution in applying self-management strategies in these patients.

H
eart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent chronic 
conditions,1 and despite advances in medical treatment, 
patients diagnosed with HF face an increased risk of hospi-
talization and mortality.2 The impact of HF on patients’ lives 
is substantial; they are expected to adhere daily to drug treat-
ment, lifestyle changes, and monitoring of signs and symptoms 
to prevent decompensation.3 Self-management interventions, 
which aim at improving patients’ knowledge and skills to per-
form those tasks and to manage their condition, have received 
increasing attention in the care of patients with HF.
Clinical Perspective on p 1198
A meta-analysis of the effects of self-management inter-
ventions in patients with HF showed significant reductions in 
all-cause and HF-related hospitalization in patients receiving 
the self-management intervention, although there were no 
effects on mortality and quality of life (QoL).4 A more recent 
systematic review, however, emphasized the heterogeneous 
findings across studies.5 Several recently conducted large, ran-
domized, controlled trials (RCTs) were unable to show ben-
eficial effects of self-management interventions on mortality 
or hospitalization rates,6–9 further illustrating heterogeneity in 
observed effects.
Part of this heterogeneity may be attributable to varying 
trial designs, intervention components, follow-up periods, or 
outcome assessments. Because the individual RCTs included 
different groups of patients, variations in patient charac-
teristics are another likely source of heterogeneity. Specific 
subgroups of patients might benefit more, or even might not 
benefit, from self-management interventions. Such knowledge 
will contribute to targeting self-management interventions to 
those groups anticipated to benefit most, which may become 
indispensable in times of decreasing resources.
Sample sizes in individual trials are generally too small 
to identify factors modifying the success of self-management 
interventions. By combining data from multiple trials, indi-
vidual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis allows reliable iden-
tification of patient subgroups with a differential treatment 
responses. Furthermore, IPD meta-analysis enables a uniform 
definition of subgroups across studies, uniform imputation 
of missing data and statistical analysis, and analysis of unre-
ported end points.10 Additionally, the main effects of included 
self-management interventions can be pooled and analyzed in 
a uniform manner.
This IPD meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effective-
ness of self-management interventions on HF-related QoL 
(HF-QoL) or generic QoL, HF-related or all-cause hospital-
ization, and all-cause mortality and to identify subgroups of 
patients with HF who respond differently to such interventions.
Methods
Data Sources and Study Selection
The electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, 
PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched from January 1985 through 
June 2013, as well as reference lists of systematic reviews.
Studies were included if they (1) met the definition of self-man-
agement intervention, (2) had an RCT design, (3) included patients 
with an established diagnosis of HF, (4) compared the self-man-
agement intervention with usual care or another self-management 
intervention, (5) reported data on 1 or more of the selected outcomes, 
(6) followed up patients for at least 6 months, and (7) were reported 
in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. 
Self-management interventions were defined as interventions provid-
ing information to patients and at least 2 of the following compo-
nents: (1) stimulation of sign/symptom monitoring, (2) education in 
problem-solving skills, and enhancement of (3) medical treatment 
adherence, (4) physical activity, (5) dietary intake, or (6) smoking 
cessation. Studies were independently assessed by 2 researchers 
(N.H.J. and H.W.) on risk of bias (low/unclear/high) using 3 crite-
ria based on the risk of bias tool from the Cochrane Collaboration11: 
random concealed allocation to treatment, intention-to-treat analysis, 
and other deviances (eg, high dropout, imbalances between groups). 
Any discrepancies were solved through consensus with a third 
researcher (J.C.A.T.). Studies scoring a high risk of bias on ≥1 crite-
ria used from the risk of bias tool11 were defined as high risk of bias. 
Those studies were included in the analysis, but the impact of studies 
of lower methodological quality was assessed in a sensitivity analysis 
by excluding these studies.
Data Collection
The principal investigators of selected studies were invited to par-
ticipate in this IPD meta-analysis and to share their deindividualized 
raw trial data. For details on the search syntax, collaboration with 
principal investigators, and a list of all requested variables, we refer 
to the study protocol.12 Data from each trial were checked for range, 
extreme values, internal consistency, missing values, and consistency 
with published reports. When recoding of categorical variables was 
needed to create uniform categories, principal investigators were con-
sulted to ensure correct interpretation of variables. This IPD meta-
analysis is exempt from formal approval by the Medical Research 
Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht because 
it reanalyzes deidentified data from trials in which informed consent 
has been obtained by principal investigators.
Outcomes
This study focused in the analysis on 8 main outcomes divided into 
HF-related outcomes and general outcomes. HF-related outcomes 
were time to the combined end point of HF-related hospitalization 
or all-cause death, time to first HF-related hospitalization, total days 
of HF-related hospital stay at 12 months, and HF-QoL at 12 months 
(measured with the Heart Failure Symptom Scale,13 Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire,14 MacNew Heart Disease Health-
Related Quality of Life Instrument,15 or Minnesota Living With Heart 
Failure Questionnaire16). General outcomes were generic QoL at 12 
months (measured with Short Form Health Survey-1217 or -3618), time 
to all-cause death, time to first all-cause hospitalization, and total 
days of all-cause hospital stay at 12 months. In addition, outcomes 
at 6 months and binary outcomes for mortality and hospitalization 
at 6 and 12 months were collected and analyzed and are presented 
in Tables I and II in the online-only Data Supplement as subordinate 
outcomes.
Patient-Specific Effect Modifiers
Clinically relevant potential effect modifiers (ie, variables such as sex 
or age that modify the effect of self-management interventions) were 
selected on the basis of the self-management literature in patients 
with HF19 and availability of comparable data across trials. The 
selected patient characteristics are presented, along with the baseline 
data, in Table 1.20 We assumed that these characteristics could modify 
the effect of interventions; for example, self-management interven-
tions might be more effective in patients with only primary education 
compared with more highly educated patients.
Statistical Analyses
Principal investigators were involved in designing a detailed plan for 
the statistical analysis and agreed on this before data analysis (see

plan). Data from individual studies were merged to create 1 database. 
With the use of multiple imputation by chained equations (25 impu-
tations),21 missing values for baseline variables and outcomes were 
imputed within studies. The imputed data sets were analyzed with a 
1-stage approach (ie, simultaneously analyzing all observations while 
accounting for clustering of observations within studies).22 Results of 
imputed data sets were pooled with the use of the Rubin rules and are 
presented as the primary results.23
All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat 
principle. For time-to-event end points, the effects of self-manage-
ment were quantified by estimating hazard ratios (HRs) with Cox 
proportional-hazard models, including a frailty term to account for 
clustering within studies. The continuous outcomes (HF-QoL and 
generic QoL) were quantified by standardized mean differences 
between intervention arms and analyzed with linear mixed-effects 
models. To correctly model the presence of overdispersion in count 
data of total days of hospital stay, negative binomial mixed-effects 
models were used to estimate relative length of stay. Binary outcome 
data (all-cause mortality, all-cause and HF-related hospitalization) 
were analyzed with log-binomial mixed-effects models, which esti-
mated risk ratios. In case of nonconvergence of a model, odds ratios 
were estimated with a logistic mixed-effects model, which is an addi-
tion to the published protocol.12 All mixed-effects models included a 
random intercept and random slope for the treatment effect to take 
clustering within studies into account.
To assess whether the effect of self-management was modified 
by patient characteristics, the aforementioned models were extended 
with interaction terms for categorical patient characteristics included 
in Table 1. This was performed for each characteristic separately. If 
there were ≥2 effect modifiers with values of P<0.10 for the inter-
action (likelihood ratio test), the interaction terms were included 
in a multivariable model to estimate the effect of self-management 
within subgroups independently of other relevant effect modifiers. 
Effect modification was considered significant if the interaction term 
showed a value of P<0.05 in the final model.
As a sensitivity analysis, we investigated potential retrieval 
bias (ie, selective inclusion of studies in the IPD meta-analysis). 
Published main effects of studies for which we could not obtain the 
original data (and thus were not included in the IPD meta-analysis) 
were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis, together with the 
main effects of included studies. We repeated the main-effects analy-
sis by excluding the studies with enhanced usual care. To assess the 
impact of studies of lower methodological quality, a sensitivity anal-
ysis was performed that excluded studies with a high risk of bias. 
Three additional sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the 
effect-modifier analysis: complete-case analysis to assess the effect 
of imputing data, analyses restricted to newer studies (recruitment 
since 2000), and exclusion of studies one by one to assess whether 
the observed subgroup effects are attributable to a specific study. All 
analyses were done in R for Windows version 3.1.1 (R Development 
Core Team, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Thirty-two studies (n=8737) met the inclusion criteria, and 
principal investigators were approached to participate in this 
IPD meta-analysis. The investigators of 5 studies could not be 
contacted; the IPD of 3 studies were no longer available; and 
investigators of 4 studies were not willing to participate. This 
resulted in inclusion of data of 20 RCTs, representing 5624 
patients in total.
Patient characteristics for which baseline data were avail-
able are presented in Table 1. The majority of patients were 
male (57.2%), and the mean age was 69.7 years (SD, 12.4 
years). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 39.2% (SD, 
18.2%), and 26.0% of patients had a preserved ejection frac-
tion (≥50%). Median time since diagnosis of HF was 1.6 years 
(interquartile range, 0.1–5.4 years). Baseline characteristics 
of patients included in this IPD meta-analysis were similar to 
those of patients in eligible studies that did not provide origi-
nal data, except for the percentage of male participants and 
current smokers (63.8% and 11.2%, respectively, in nonpar-
ticipating studies).
Characteristics of included studies are presented in 
Table 2.24–41 Sample size ranged from 4231 to 1023 patients.7 
The majority of interventions were delivered by a specialized 
nurse; 2 interventions used a group approach29,39; and 2 inter-
ventions consisted of telephonic case management.36,37 One 
trial included 2 intervention arms.7 Duration of the interven-
tions ranged from 0.525,30 to 187 months. Two studies provided 
enhanced care to the control patients,6,29 consisting of some 
educational components. These components were judged 
marginal and in line with the education delivered to patients 
with HF in usual care. Consequently, these 2 studies were 
included in the analysis.
Main Effects of Self-Management Interventions
Self-management interventions showed significant effects on 
several HF-related outcomes (Table 3). Interventions reduced 
the risk of time to the combined end point of HF-related hos-
pitalization or all-cause death (HR, 0.80; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.71–0.89) and time to HF-related hospitaliza-
tion alone (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.92). There was a small 
improvement in HF-QoL at 12 months in patients receiving 
the intervention (standardized mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 
0.00–0.30). No effects were found for total days in hospital as 
a result of HF readmissions or any of the general outcomes. 
The Figure shows the effects across studies for HF-QoL, 
HF-related hospitalization, and all-cause mortality.
Effects in Patient Subgroups
In the HF-related outcomes, subgroup analysis revealed sig-
nificant effect modification by age on days in hospital owing 
to HF (Table 3). For younger patients (<65 years of age), mean 
number of days in hospital owing to HF in the intervention 
group was 0.70 days; it was 5.35 days in the control group 
(relative length of stay, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02–0.38). This differ-
ence was not found in patients 65 to 80 years of age (3.30 days 
in the intervention group versus 3.84 days in the control group; 
interaction P=0.03). For general outcomes (Table 3), there 
was significant effect modification by comorbid depression on 
time to all-cause death. Although no significant effect of self-
management was found in patients with no/mild depression 
on all-cause death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69–1.06), there was 
a negative effect in patients with moderate/severe depression 
on all-cause death (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06–1.83; interaction 
P=0.01). In univariable analysis, level of education showed a 
significant effect modification on time to first all-cause hospi-
talization, with the self-management intervention showing a 
positive effect on less educated patients (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 
0.71–0.96; Table III in the online-only Data Supplement), 
whereas there was no effect in patients who had completed 
secondary education (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82–1.17) or higher 
education (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.99–1.60; interaction P=0.02). 
After adjustment for potential effect modification by age, 
effect modification by level of education was no longer sig-
nificant (interaction P=0.07). Additional analyses of outcomes

measured at 6 months did not yield different insights (Tables I 
and II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses
Including published effects of the eligible studies for which 
original data could be obtained did not change the primary 
findings (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement); 
neither did the sensitivity analysis of excluding studies 
with enhanced usual care (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The other sensitivity analyses also yielded 
similar effects. Effect modification by depression on time to 
all-cause death was no longer statistically significant (inter-
action P=0.22), and the negative effect for patients with 
moderate/severe depression on all-cause death was no lon-
ger present (HR, 0.63, 95% CI, 0.29–1.34) only when the 
subgroup analysis was repeated without the trial by Jaarsma 
and colleagues.7
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first IPD meta-
analysis including sufficiently large numbers of patients with 
HF to be able to identify subgroups of patients who respond 
differently to self-management interventions. We observed 
protective effects of self-management interventions on time 
to the combined end point of HF-related hospitalization or all-
cause death, HF-related hospitalization alone, and HF-QoL. 
Subgroup analyses showed that younger patients responded 
better to self-management in terms of reduced total days of 
HF-related hospitalization and that patients with HF with 
depression showed a reduced survival after the self-manage-
ment intervention.
The beneficial effects found on time to the combined end 
point of HF-related hospitalization or all-cause death and on 
HF-related hospitalization alone have also been reported by 
previous (aggregate data) meta-analyses on similar interven-
tions.4,42 Earlier systematic reviews consistently stressed the 
large heterogeneity across studies in the effects of self-man-
agement on health-related QoL.5 Our study included several 
recent large, neutral trials6,7 and was the first to pool the results 
for HF-QoL and to compute an overall effect. Although 95% 
CIs were rather wide, we observed a small positive effect for 
HF-QoL at 12 months. In contrast to HF-related outcomes, we 
found no effects of self-management interventions on general 
outcomes (ie, generic QoL, all-cause mortality, all-cause hos-
pitalization). This is in line with previous meta-analyses.4,42 
Thus, it seems that self-management interventions are par-
ticularly effective in patients with HF for improving outcomes 
directly related to their disease.
The subgroup analysis showed that younger patients (<65 
years of age) benefited more from self-management inter-
ventions than older patients. Younger patients in intervention 
groups were discharged sooner from hospitalization for HF 
during follow-up than their counterparts in control groups. 
There was no intervention effect in older patients. Older hos-
pitalized patients have an increased risk of functional decline 
and cognitive dysfunction and generally suffer from more 
comorbid conditions, complicating their overall functioning 
and recovery time once hospitalized.43 Older persons espe-
cially are at high risk in the period after hospitalization as 
a result of deprived sleep, poor nutrition, stress, symptoms, 
new treatments, and inactivity. Equipping patients with self-
management skills might not be sufficient in such complex 
situations. Postdischarge instability may need new approaches 
beyond targeting HF itself for a safer transition from hospital 
to home.44 Still, the effect modification by age was not con-
sistent across other health outcomes studied, and the number 
of patients <65 years of age included in the analysis was rela-
tively small (n=139). The findings should therefore be consid-
ered hypothesis generating.
Self-management interventions increased the risk of all-
cause mortality in patients with moderate/severe depression. 
Sensitivity analyses indicated that this effect was driven by 
the largest study included in this IPD meta-analysis.7 The 
authors of that study reported a similar trend of their inter-
vention for patients with depressive symptoms in their sub-
group analysis.45 These findings question the suitability of 
generic self-management interventions in patients with HF 
with depressive symptoms. Depression is often associated 
with reduced motivation, which might compromise adherence 
to medication regimen and lifestyle changes,46 particularly 
if multiple comorbid conditions (and treatments) need to be 
self-managed. These patients may be burdened with self-man-
aging their HF. Increased mortality after self-management 
interventions might therefore be caused by suboptimal (self-)
management of their illnesses, including HF. Interestingly, 
the negative effect was limited to all-cause mortality. In the 5 
studies that measured depression, self-management interven-
tions showed an overall HR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94–0.97) on 
time to HF-related hospitalization, and subgroup analysis did 
not reveal a differential treatment effect between patients with 
and without depression (HR with depression, 1.00; 95% CI, 
0.74–1.35; HR without depression, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.71–1.18; 
interaction P=0.64). With no clear explanation for reduced sur-
vival in patients with HF with depression, caution is warranted 
before self-management strategies are applied in the care of 
those patients. Patients with depressive symptoms might need 
additional psychological interventions or medication before 
initiating self-management interventions.47 Screening patients 
with HF for symptoms of depression might help to determine 
to what extent attention should be paid to self-management 
skills or additional psychological interventions in the treat-
ment plan.
Previous subgroup analyses in 3 large RCTs have shown 
that self-management interventions might be more effective 
for patients with low socioeconomic status. DeWalt and col-
leagues6 found that self-management support showed a posi-
tive effect on HF-related hospitalizations only in patients with 
low literacy. A Dutch self-management trial found greatest 
improvements in health-related QoL in patients with lower 
education.48 The third trial showed that patients with reduced 
income benefitted most from self-management.8 The pattern 
across studies generates the hypothesis that patients with 
a lower socioeconomic status may benefit most from self-
management interventions. Similarly, our analyses indicate a 
protective effect of self-management on time to first all-cause 
hospitalization in patients with lower education. However, 
after adjustment for other potential effect modifiers, this effect 
did not reach statistical significance.

This IPD meta-analysis was one of the first attempts 
to pool IPD on self-management interventions for patients 
with HF. The study included sufficient patients (n=5624) to 
analyze treatment effects in patient subgroups and applied 
robust statistical modeling according to a prespecified plan. 
Reported effects were found across cultures and healthcare 
settings. Nevertheless, this study has several limitations that 
deserve further discussion. First, despite numerous efforts to 
reach all principal investigators, we were unable to include all 
32 eligible trials. Inclusion of 62.5% of the eligible trials (20 
of 32) is relatively high compared with IPD meta-analyses 
on similar interventions.49 Including published results of tri-
als for which no IPD were available did not change the main 
effects, but this could not be checked for the subgroup analy-
sis because of the limited published subgroup data. Second, 
included self-management interventions differed in terms of 
intensity, duration, mode, and content. Although reported 
effects were found for self-management interventions in any 
setting, specific types of interventions might work better for 
specific subgroups of patients. The question “What works 
for whom?” deserves attention in subsequent research. 
Third, this IPD meta-analysis was highly dependent on data 
previously collected in individual studies, which limited the 
choice of potential effect modifiers to be studied. Individual 
trials indicated that self-management interventions might be 
more effective in nonadherers to regimens25 or in patients 
with better cognitive status.48 We could not analyze those 
potential effect modifiers because variables were not col-
lected in all studies. If uniform standards for baseline vari-
ables were established, a meaningful comparison of patient 
subgroups across studies may provide further insight into 
patient characteristics modifying treatment effects. Finally,

although all (subgroup) analyses were preplanned and docu-
mented in our protocol,12 their large number increases the 
risk of false-positive findings. Our subgroup analysis was 
exploratory in nature and was not intended to demonstrate 
causal mechanisms. Causal mechanisms of subgroup effects 
need to be completely understood before any final conclu-
sions can be drawn. Validation of our findings in large trial 
databases may confirm our subgroup findings.
Conclusions
We found that, despite diversity in intensity, content, and per-
sonnel delivering the intervention, self-management interven-
tions in patients with HF improve outcomes directly related to 
their disease. Although self-management interventions might 
be more effective in younger patients in reducing length of 
hospital stay, we did not observe consistent subgroup effects 
across different health outcomes. This study does not endorse

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
Although self-management interventions are widely implemented in long-term care for patients with heart failure (HF), 
many clinicians question the actual impact of such interventions on patient outcomes. This study summarizes the evidence of 
randomized trials on self-management interventions. It revealed that, despite diverse content and intensity, self-management 
interventions elicit positive effects in patients with HF on outcomes directly related to their disease (ie, HF-related quality 
of life, HF-related hospitalization, and the combined end point of HF-related hospitalization or all-cause death). There were 
no effects on general outcomes (ie, all-cause hospitalization or all-cause mortality). Furthermore, we observed that particu-
larly younger patients with HF (<65 years of age) benefited from self-management interventions; those patients showed a 
10-fold decrease in length of hospital stay for HF. On the other hand, there was a higher mortality rate in patients with HF 
with comorbid depression who received the self-management intervention. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that 
practicing clinicians pay considerable attention to self-management skills in the treatment plans for their patients with HF. 
However, the higher mortality in patients with comorbid depression cautions against the application of self-management 
strategies in this patient group. Clinicians caring for patients with HF may consider screening them for symptoms of depres-
sion and, if present, address the depression before initiating self-management interventions.
