ABSTRACT
Objective: Nutrition therapy is an integral part of self-
management education in patients with type 2
diabetes. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index are
recommended, but the ideal amount of carbohydrate in
the diet is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis
comparing diets containing low to moderate amounts
of carbohydrate (LCD) (energy percentage below 45%)
to diets containing high amounts of carbohydrate
(HCD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
Research design and methods: We systematically
reviewed Cochrane library databases, EMBASE, and
MEDLINE in the period 2004–2014 for guidelines,
meta-analyses, and randomized trials assessing the
outcomes HbA1c, BMI, weight, LDL cholesterol, quality
of life (QoL), and attrition.
Results: We identified 10 randomized trials
comprising 1376 participants in total. In the first year
of intervention, LCD was followed by a 0.34% lower
HbA1c (3.7 mmol/mol) compared with HCD (95% CI
0.06 (0.7 mmol/mol), 0.63 (6.9 mmol/mol)). The
greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater the
glucose-lowering effect (R=−0.85, p<0.01). At 1 year
or later, however, HbA1c was similar in the 2 diet
groups. The effect of the 2 types of diet on BMI/body
weight, LDL cholesterol, QoL, and attrition rate was
similar throughout interventions.
Limitations: Glucose-lowering medication, the
nutrition therapy, the amount of carbohydrate in the
diet, glycemic index, fat and protein intake, baseline
HbA1c, and adherence to the prescribed diets could all
have affected the outcomes.
Conclusions: Low to moderate carbohydrate diets
have greater effect on glycemic control in type 2
diabetes compared with high-carbohydrate diets in the
first year of intervention. The greater the carbohydrate
restriction, the greater glucose lowering, a relationship
that has not been demonstrated earlier. Apart from this
lowering of HbA1c over the short term, there is no
superiority of low-carbohydrate diets in terms of
glycemic control, weight, or LDL cholesterol.
INTRODUCTION
Nutrition therapy is an integral part of self-
management education in patients with type
2 diabetes. Current recommendations suggest
a hypocaloric diet for overweight patients
with the aim of achieving weight loss and
improving glycemic control and carbohy-
drates with a low glycemic index to improve
postprandial glucose control.1 However, the
ideal energy percentage (E%) of carbohy-
drate in the diet is unclear. Traditionally, an
intake
of
45–60%
carbohydrate
(high-
carbohydrate diet (HCD)) has been recom-
mended, but in recent years, diets with a
restricted amount of carbohydrate, that is,
low-carbohydrate diets (LCD), have been
suggested by some experts2 and are pre-
ferred
by
some
patients
(http://www.
diabetes.co.uk/diet-for-type2-diabetes.html).
The arguments have been an improved gly-
cemic control,3 a quicker and more pro-
nounced weight loss in obese people without
diabetes, and a more beneficial effect on
lipids.2 However, this is not supported by the
evidence from high-quality randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) of type 2 diabetic sub-
jects, and the published studies have been
heterogeneous with regard to amount and
types of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in the
LCD and HCD diets compared. Conclusions
on the efficacy of LCD compared with HCD
from
recent
reviews are
thus conflicting
with regard to glycemic control and weight
loss.4–8 A very recent critical review based on
predefined criteria9 found no evidence of
any superiority of LCD compared with HCD.
Key messages
▪ The ideal amount of carbohydrates in the diet in
the management of type 2 diabetes is unclear.
▪ The current meta-analysis conducted according
to the GRADE system of rating quality of evi-
dence shows that low to moderate carbohydrate
diets have greater glucose-lowering effect com-
pared with high-carbohydrate diets.
▪ The greater the carbohydrate restriction, the
greater glucose lowering.
▪ Apart from improvements in HbA1c over the
short term, there is no superiority of low-
carbohydrate diets in terms of glycemic control,
weight, or LDL cholesterol.

 Objective
We aimed to examine the effects of low to moderate
carbohydrate diet in comparison to HCD in subjects
with type 2 diabetes by meta-analysis of high-quality
RCTs. The assessed outcomes were HbA1c, BMI/weight,
LDL cholesterol, quality of life (QoL), and dropout
rates. The meta-analysis was part of the basis for the
Danish National Guideline for lifestyle intervention in
type 2 diabetes using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)
system of rating quality of evidence.
METHODS
Eligibility criteria
We specified eligibility criteria for the search and
meta-analyses using the PICO approach: determin-
ation
of
the
Population
(P),
Intervention
(I),
Comparison (C), and Outcomes (O). We subsequently
defined the specific question to be explored in the lit-
erature: What is the effect of dietary carbohydrate
restriction compared with the recommended diet con-
taining 45–60% carbohydrate in people with type 2
diabetes?
Population was subjects with type 2 diabetes based on
clinical criteria. Intervention was randomized trials com-
paring carbohydrate restriction (below 45%) to diet of
45–60% carbohydrate. Interventions aimed at also chan-
ging the glycemic index of the diet were not included.
Carbohydrate restriction could be combined with a
higher fat intake, a higher protein intake, or both. The
selected primary outcomes of the analysis were glycemic
control (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) after
1 year or more. Secondary outcomes were HbA1c and
BMI before 1 year, LDL cholesterol, QoL, and dropout
rates. Weight was included in the analysis if BMI was not
available, whereas anthropomorphic data were expected
to be limited in the included trials, and were therefore
not considered.
Information sources and search strategy
A research librarian performed systematic literature
searches including the following databases: EMBASE,
MEDLINE, and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases.
Literature search was performed in October 2014. It
was limited to references published in English or
Scandinavian languages from January 2004 to October
2014. Three searches were made, first for guidelines,
then for reviews, and finally for RCTs. The results of all
searches were entered into the Covidence software
program for analyses.10
Study selection
After each search, based on title and abstract, one
author (OS) extracted relevant reports and papers for
full-text evaluation by two independent authors (GMP
,
HKA, or OS).
Only high-quality guidelines based on GRADE or
similar evaluation systems and systematic reviews of ran-
domized trials were included. Clinical guidelines were
evaluated using the AGREE II-software, if relevant to the
issues we address.11 Similarly, systematic reviews were
evaluated using AMSTAR.12 Evaluations were performed
by two authors independently (GMP
, HKA, or OS).
Disagreements were primarily resolved through discus-
sions and second by the third author.
Data collection process and risk of bias in individual
studies
Two reviewers independently extracted data from the
included randomized trials and recorded details about
study design, interventions, participants, and outcome
measures.
The risk of bias was assessed against the key criteria:
random sequence generation; allocation concealment;
blinding of participants, personnel, and assessors; incom-
plete outcome data; selective outcomes reporting; and
other sources of bias, in accordance with the recommen-
dations of the Cochrane Collaboration.13 The following

RESULTS
No guidelines based on GRADE or other comparable
evaluation systems address the issues of the present
review.
Eleven reviews were selected for full-text evaluation
(figure 1). The predefined criteria for entering the ana-
lysis and the issues we address were fulfilled in only one
high-quality review.6 Furthermore, only part of this
review was relevant for the present analysis, so we
entered data from individual studies rather than using
estimates from the review.
The search for RCTs revealed 692 papers, of which 12
were selected for full-text assessment (figure 1). Seven
RCTs that fulfilled the defined criteria and had relevant
outcomes were included in the analyses,14–20 together
with three other RCTs21–23 identified in the review by
Ajala et al.6 In two of the included RCTs, the QoL data
were located in separate papers.24 25
Study characteristics and risk of bias
All trials were conducted in outpatient settings using
parallel RCT designs. In two trials, a number of subjects
were randomized to diets not relevant for the compari-
son,21 23 and these groups were therefore not included
in the analysis. In total, 1376 subjects with type 2 dia-
betes were included in this analysis. Forty-nine percent
were male, and the average age was 58 years. The major-
ity were obese—mean BMI ranged from 26 kg/m2 in an
Asian population20 to 37 kg/m2 in an American popula-
tion. Table 1 shows characteristics of the included
studies.
In five randomized trials, the duration of the interven-
tion was 12 months, in two, it was 3 months, in one, it
was 6 months, and in two studies, the intervention was
24 months. Subjects randomized to the LCD or HCD
groups received comparable nutrition therapy by trained
dieticians, with about the same number and frequency
of follow-up sessions. Self-reported food intake was moni-
tored in all trials using 1–7 days diaries, but energy
percent intake of carbohydrates, fat, and protein was
only available in nine trials (table 1). In the LCD
groups, subjects were instructed to substitute calories
from carbohydrates with either protein,16 17 fat,14 18 21–23
or both.15
19
20 The average predefined targets for
the assigned carbohydrate restriction were 25% (range
14–40%). The average reported intake was 30% (range
14–45%) after 3 or 6 months of intervention, and 38%
(range 27–45%) at 1 year (5 trials). Three trials had
24 months follow-up.15

 subjects were advised to increase their daily physical
activity equally in each group.
Usable data were available on three or more of the
predefined outcomes (BMI, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol,
and weight).
QoL was evaluated using different scales,14–16 and
others used questionnaires for depression, problem
areas in diabetes, and physical activity.18 20
The mean HbA1c at baseline was just below 7.0%
(53 mmol/mol) in the study by Saslow et al.18 HbA1c in
the other studies was between 7.3% (56 mmol/mol) and
8.3% (67 mmol/mol).
The risk of bias was assessed from the available full
text, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool,13 the ele-
ments are given in figures 2, 3, and 5. Subjects were ran-
domized prior to intervention in all trials. The random
sequence generation method was described in all but
one study.20 Allocation concealment was described in six
trials. Blinding of participants and personnel (perform-
ance bias) was not possible. Blinding of outcome asses-
sors was reported in five trials and unclear in the other.
There was an unbalanced randomization regarding age
in the study by Saslow et al18 and four subjects in this
study
had
per
definition
pre-diabetes
with
HbA1c
between 6.0% and 6.5% at baseline. A tendency to a
larger long-term dropout rate during LCD (see below)
suggests possible attrition bias. There were no other
potential sources of bias and we assessed the overall risk
of bias to be low to moderate.

 (95% CI 0.06 (0.7) to 0.63 (6.9)) HbA1c compared with
HCD (table 2 and figure 2). Owing to heterogeneity,
however, the quality of the evidence for this is only mod-
erate (figure 2). At 1 year or later, HbA1c (seven trials
included) was similar in the two groups (figure 3).
The magnitude of this greater glucose-lowering effect
of low to moderate carbohydrate diets in the first year of
intervention was related to the reported intake of carbo-
hydrates measured as energy% (figure 4) (eight trials,
R −0.85, p<0.01). The effect on glycemic control increased
with the reported degree of carbohydrate restriction. The
reported intake of carbohydrate in grams was available in
four of these studies15 18–20 and ranged from 57 to 198 g in
the LCD groups, and from 133 to 205 g in the HCD
groups. The two studies with the lowest daily carbohydrate
intake in the LCD groups, 57 and 58 g, respectively, found
the largest reduction in HbA1c (figure 4).18 19 Substituting
carbohydrate with high fat, high protein, or both had no
significant impact on the effect.
Reports on glucose-lowering medication during inter-
ventions were available in seven studies.14
15
17–20
23
Medication was reduced at 3 or 6 months during LCD
compared with HCD,15 17–19 and was numerically lower
at 12 months.14 15 17 One study did not report changes
in medication, but found symptomatic hypoglycemia in
three subjects treated with LCD.20
LCD and HCD had similar effects on LDL cholesterol
throughout interventions (table 2).
Two trials measured QoL by means of SF-36 question-
naires.16 25 Physical component score tended to deteri-
orate during LCD compared with HCD (−1.93 (95%:
−4.1 to 0.16), p=0.07), whereas mental component score
was similar (table 2). Scores were not significantly differ-
ent between groups using the Diabetes-39 question-
naire24 or other questionnaires.18 20
There were no differences between groups in reported
adverse events, cardiovascular events, or mortality.
Dropouts
Dropout rates at longest follow-up were similar in the
two groups (figure 5). In trials with long follow-up,
however,16 22 dropout rates tended to be larger in the
LCD groups.
The
dropout
rates
differed
considerably
between
studies, ranging from 2% to 60% in the LCD groups
and from 2% to 46% in the HCD groups.
DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis conducted according to the GRADE
criteria shows that nutrition therapy with a low to moder-
ate E% carbohydrate diet induces a greater decline in
HbA1c in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared with a
standard HCD. Considering baseline HbA1c in the
included studies, and that it was necessary to reduce
glucose-lowering medication during LCD in many trials,
the 0.34%-points (3.7 mmol/mol) improvement in gly-
cemic control is of clinical significance. It was present
after 3 or 6 months of intervention, but not after 1 year
or later. The excess reduction in HbA1c was correlated
with the degree of carbohydrate restriction, a finding
not reported earlier. A recent review of the literature26
did not perform meta-analysis of the available HbA1c
data due to a large heterogeneity in the carbohydrate
intake
in
the
intervention
groups,
and
other
meta-analyses have either shown a numerically greater
reduction in HbA1c,6 7 or no effect in type 2 diabetes.9
A recent 52-week randomized dietary trial by Tay
et al27 tested the effect on glucose profiles of an LCD
with 14% carbohydrate, 58% fat, and 28% protein in
comparison to an HCD with 53% carbohydrates, 30%
fat, and 17% protein. They found a lower glycemic vari-
ability and smaller excursions in the LCD group, and a
reduced need for diabetes medication. HbA1c and
weight loss was not different.

 Results from some of the trials included in the present
analysis suggest that the lack of consistency of the effect
of LCD could be related to a decline in dietary adher-
ence over time.15 16 22 Apart from a lowering of the daily
glycemic challenge, an initial hypoglycemic effect of
LCD followed by an attenuation of the efficacy could
also be due to changes in gut microbiota as a conse-
quence of the altered carbohydrate intake followed by
gradual adaptive mechanisms.28
Our findings and recent trials suggest that LCD may
be superior to HCD with respect to glucose level and
postprandial excursions, but only as long as the subject
adheres to the diet. However, the effect on glycemic
control is limited and the importance of glucose excur-
sions in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complica-
tions in diabetes is still under debate.29
Overall, and given the heterogeneity of the HbA1c esti-
mate and other potential bias, the present evidence is
insufficient to support LCD as superior to HCD, but the
evidence does support LCD as an appropriate alternative.
We found that iso-caloric low to moderate carbohy-
drate diets and HCD had similar effects on BMI or body
weight throughout the trials. This is consistent with
recent studies showing that LCD does not increase
energy expenditure to a relevant extent.30 Waist circum-
ference was not included in the present analysis, but did
not differ between groups in the individual studies
where it was measured. Some recent reviews of predom-
inately obese non-diabetic subjects report greater weight
loss with LCD compared with low-fat diet,7 others find
equal effect of LCD and HCD.8 No effect is reported in
subgroups of diabetic subjects7 8 and in meta-analyses of
randomized trials in type 2 diabetes.9
We have only focused on LDL cholesterol in the
present analysis, and found equal effect of LCD and
control diets. This is in accordance with previous find-
ings. In some reviews of mixed groups of subjects, LCD
lead to minor but significant changes in lipids7 com-
pared with low-fat diet. Triglycerides were lower, and
HDL as well as LDL cholesterol were higher.
As far as we know the long-term effect of LCD on
physical performance and endurance has not yet been
studied in subjects with type 2 diabetes. We found a non-
significant numeric worsening of the physical compo-
nent of the QoL score in the LCD group compared with
the HCD group. A recent randomized trial with QoL as
the primary outcome found equal improvement of
Diabetes-39 questionnaire and problem areas in diabetes
(PAID).31 However, most of the elements, including
energy and mobility, tended to improve more in the
low-fat HCD group (SF-39). If subjects experience low
physical capacity and energy during LCD, this could
explain the lack of adherence to the diet over time.
Strengths and limitations
The major strength of the present meta-analysis is that
we used the GRADE approach to a systematic review of
high-quality randomized trials. We predefined a relevant
clinical question to be answered, as well as the popula-
tion, the comparator, and the outcomes.
Changes in glucose-lowering medication have probably
led to an underestimation of the effect of LCD on gly-
cemic control. This and variability in adherence to the
diet are probably the main factors modifying the effect
of LCD on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. However,
many other factors could potentially contribute to the
heterogeneity of the results. The duration and intensity
of the nutrition therapy, the carbohydrate and total daily
calorie intake in the LCD and the HCD groups, the gly-
cemic index of the carbohydrates, the fat and protein
intake, baseline HbA1c, and adherence to the prescribed
diet. Finally, the included studies all have potential per-
formance bias due to the lack of blinding of subjects and
personnel. However, this problem cannot be solved.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that carbohydrate restriction (E% below
45%) has a greater effect on glycemic control in type 2
diabetes than an HCD in the short term. The magnitude

 of the effect was correlated to the carbohydrate intake,
the greater the restriction, the greater glucose lowering,
a relationship that has not been demonstrated earlier. In
the long term, the glucose-lowering effect of LCD and
HCD was similar. This may be due to subjects failing,
over time, to adhere to the LCD, or to adaptive mechan-
isms. Iso-caloric LCD and HCD had similar effects on
body weight, LDL cholesterol, and QoL.
