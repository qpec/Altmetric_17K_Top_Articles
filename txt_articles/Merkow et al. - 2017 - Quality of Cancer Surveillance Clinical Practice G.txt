Quality of Cancer Surveillance Clinical Practice Guidelines
Specificity and Consistency of Recommendations

IMPORTANCE Primary care clinicians, who are increasingly responsible for caring for the
growing population of cancer survivors, may be unfamiliar with appropriate cancer
surveillance strategies. Clinical practice guidelines can inform cancer follow-up care and
surveillance testing. Vague recommendations and inconsistencies among guidelines can lead
to overuse and underuse of health care resources and have a negative impact on cost and
quality of survivorship care.
OBJECTIVE To examine the specificity and consistency of recommendations for surveillance
after active treatment across cancer guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of national
cancer guidelines from North America and Europe published since 2010 addressing
posttreatment care for survivors of the 9 most common cancers. We categorized surveillance
modalities into history and physical examinations, tumor markers, diagnostic procedures (eg,
colonoscopy), and imaging. Within each guideline, we classified individual recommendations
into 5 categories: (1) risk-based recommendation, (2) recommendation for surveillance, (3)
addressed but no clear recommendation, (4) recommendation against surveillance, or (5)
cases in which surveillance was not addressed. We reviewed each surveillance
recommendation for frequency and a stop date, evaluated consistency among guidelines,
and analyzed associations between the organizations proposing the guidelines and
recommendation characteristics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Description of guideline recommendations for cancer
surveillance.
RESULTS We identified 41 guidelines published between January 1, 2010, and March 1, 2016.
Eighty-five percent of guidelines (35) were from professional organizations. Ambiguous
recommendations (ie, modality not discussed or discussed without a clear recommendation)
were present in 83% of guidelines (34), and 44% (18) recommended against at least 1 test.
European guidelines were more likely than North American guidelines to contain ambiguous
recommendations (100% vs 68%; P<.01). Recommendations commonly specified testing
frequency (from 88% [14 of 16] for tumor markers to 92% [24 of 26] for procedures and/or
imaging) but infrequently provided a definitive stop time. Cross-sectional imaging
recommendations varied among guidelines for each cancer. For example, among breast
cancer guidelines, surveillance computed tomographic scans were recommended against in
2, discussed without a clear recommendation in 1, and not addressed in 3 guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Guidelines addressing the care of cancer survivors have low
specificity and consistency. As guidelines continue to be revised, developers should clarify
recommendations with simple, nonambiguous, definitive language for or against the use of
specific tests to optimize care quality and resource utilization.

here are an estimated 33 million living survivors of can-
cer globally, and this number is expected to grow ow-
ing to a rising cancer incidence in an aging population
and improved survival following a cancer diagnosis.1,2 Cur-
rently, in the United States, 1 in every 20 people, or 14 mil-
lion, meets the definition of cancer survivor3; this number is
expected to grow to 18 million survivors by 2022.2 Surveil-
lance for recurrent or secondary cancer is a fundamental
component of survivorship care.4 Depending on the site of
primary disease and time since treatment, surveillance mo-
dalities can include medical history and physical examina-
tions,tumormarkers,directvisualizationwithendoscopicpro-
cedures, and radioraphic imaging.

Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of clinical practice
guidelines from North America and Europe addressing can-
cers with the highest estimated number of survivors in the
United States as identified by the American Cancer Society.2
We included 9 cancers (breast, colorectal, non–small-cell lung,
prostate, melanoma, uterine corpus, bladder, thyroid, and
testicular), which represented 73% of all cancer survivors
(10 623 240 people) in the United States in 2014.2
Data Sources

characteristics, including organization type (professional or

2014-2016) and region of origin (North America or Europe).
For each guideline we evaluated aspects of the guideline
development process (specification of clinical questions, per-
formance of a systematic review) and the reported strength
of evidence in support of surveillance recommendations,
based on prioritized elements from the Grades of Recom-
mendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation

Key Points
Question What is the specificity and consistency of
recommendations for cancer surveillance after active treatment
across guidelines?
Findings In this retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 41
national cancer guidelines across 9 cancer types, we found
recommendations are often nonspecific and inconsistent. Within
the same disease, different guidelines often did not address all the
same surveillance modalities, and relatively few surveillance
modalities were recommended across all guidelines.
Meaning As guidelines continue to be revised, developers should
clarify recommendations with simple, nonambiguous, definitive
language for or against the use of specific tests to optimize care
quality and resource utilization.

Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize surveillance
methods, recommendation types, specificity, and consis-
tency,andusedχ2teststoevaluateassociationsbetweenguide-
line sources and recommendation characteristics. Owing to
small sample size, we did not perform multivariable analysis.
Significance was set at P = .05, and all tests were 2-sided. All
statistical analysis was performed using SAS software
(version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
We identified a total of 41 guidelines addressing posttreat-
mentsurveillanceacrossthe9cancertypes(Table1).Thenum-
ber of guidelines per cancer type ranged from 3 to 6 per
cancer, and a total of 22 specific testing modalities were ad-
dressed. Thirty-five guidelines (85%) were from professional
organizations, of which 25 (71%) were developed by national
societies. Twenty guidelines (49%) were from North America,
and most guidelines were published between 2014 and 2016
(66%). eAppendix 1 in the Supplement lists all guidelines in-
cluded by cancer type.17-59 Guideline development processes
were variable: clinical questions were specified in 11 guide-
lines (27%), a systematic review was performed in 14 (34%),
and 34 (83%) rated the strength of evidence and/or strength
of recommendations. Supporting evidence was weak for most
recommendations (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).
Medical history and physical examinations were recom-
mended in most guidelines (37 [90%]) across all cancer types,
whileotherformsofsurveillancewerelesscommonlyaddressed
and varied more across cancers, including imaging (34 [83%]),
endoscopicprocedures(26[63%]),andtumormarkers(23[56%]).
Ambiguousrecommendations(ie,recommendationsneitherfor
or against a particular modality) were present in 34 guidelines
(83%) across cancer types while 18 guidelines (44%) recom-
mendedagainstatleast1test.Fourteenguidelines(34%)included
risk-based recommendations (Table 1). A recommendation
against use was included in at least 1 guideline for 12 of 22 total

includingmammographyinbreastcancer,colonoscopyandtu-
mormarkersincolorectalcancer,tumormarkersinprostatecan-
cer, and ultrasonography and tumor markers in thyroid cancer.
Recommendationsregardingothersurveillancemodalities
were less consistent. With regard to tumor markers, 2 of 4 tes-
ticularcancerguidelines(50%)and1of4melanomaguidelines
(25%) recommended risk-based tumor marker testing; 2 of 6
breast cancer guidelines (33%) and 1 of 5 lung cancer guidelines
(20%)recommendedagainsttumormarkertesting(Figure1).The
teststhatweremostcommonlyrecommendedagainstwereCT
imaginginuterinecancer(67%ofrelevantguidelines)andbone
scans in prostate cancer (33%) (Table 2).
Positron emission tomographic imaging was recom-
mended by only 1 of 41 guidelines; this was for bladder cancer
(Figure 2). The remainder of guidelines either recommended
against or did not address routine PET imaging. Uterine cancer
had the most guidelines recommending against the use of PET
imaging(67%)followedbylungcancer(60%).Thecancertypes
withthemostguidelineswithambiguousrecommendationsfor
PETscanswerebladder(83%),prostate(83%),andbreast(67%)
cancers.
Testing frequency was provided for most of the surveil-
lance modalities addressed (range, 88%-92%), but stop times
were infrequently provided (range, 31%-38%). There was no
statistically significant difference in testing frequency, inclu-
sion of a stop time, presence of a risk-based recommenda-
tion, recommendation against at least 1 test, or guideline
ambiguity by organization type or year of publication. How-
ever, there was significant variation in the presence of a stop
time recommendation by cancer type (range, 0% for pros-
tate, uterine, and thyroid cancers to 100% for colorectal can-
cer; P < .01). In addition, European guidelines were more likely
than North American guidelines to contain ambiguous recom-
mendations (100% vs 68%; P < .01) (Table 3).

thoroughly studied, excessive ongoing surveillance may harm
patientsthroughexposureeithertodirectharmsofunnecessary
surveillance tests or to harms of more invasive downstream
procedures.69 Much of the lack of recommendation specificity
is likely driven by the low quality of evidence to inform optimal
surveillancestrategiesincancersurvivorsthatwedocumented

developmentofhigh-qualityguidelines.71However,developers
can optimize guideline usability by maintaining transparency
aboutthestrengthofevidencewhilestillmakingspecificrecom-
mendations even in the absence of strong evidence.
The Institute of Medicine has stated that guidelines should
be valid, reliable, applicable, flexible, and clear, and should re-
flect a multidisciplinary process that can be regularly
updated.72 The guidelines in our sample fall short in many of
these domains, which is not unique among oncology
guidelines.73 However, we believe that a number of simple
changes to the development of cancer surveillance recom-
mendations would improve their clarity, applicability, and,
therefore, their ability to optimize patient outcomes.
First, recommendations about testing should use language
that is unambiguous and includes a testing frequency with de-
finitive start and stop intervals.65 For example, with respect to
surveillance imaging, a guideline could state that a specific test
shouldbeperformed“every6monthsforthefirst2years,yearly
for 3 years and should not be performed after a total of 5 years
ifthereisnoevidenceofrecurrence.
”Definitivestatementssuch
as“positronemissiontomographyscansshouldnotbeusedfor

whichpatientswithstageIandIIdiseasearefollowedbyhistory
and physical examinations only, while those with stage III and
IV disease undergo more extensive surveillance with cross-
sectional imaging (eg, CT scans, magnetic resonance imaging)
including PET scans. The lack of risk-based recommendations
among guidelines in our sample likely reflects the limited data
availabletohelpinstructsurveillanceprograms60;indeed,most
recommendations were based on low-quality evidence. Other
barriers to risk-based recommendations include the inherent
complexityofdevelopingthemandperhapstheperceivedchal-
lenges with clinician interpretation. Nevertheless, risk-based
recommendations are likely to provide a more efficient, cost-
effective approach to patient follow-up, and further incorpora-
tion of risk into surveillance recommendations would improve
their usefulness.
Third, survivorship guideline development panels should
incorporate all stakeholders, including generalist physicians,
advanced practice clinicians, and patient representatives.72
Currently, panels developing cancer guidelines are tasked

with providing recommendations across the continuum of
care, including diagnosis, treatment, and posttreatment man-
agement. While the panels may be multidisciplinary as rec-
ommended by the IOM,64 including a variety of oncologic spe-
cialists to address the complexity of diagnosis and treatment
of cancer, the panels likely contain very few, if any, general
practitioners.83 Yet it is often generalists who must translate
surveillance recommendations into clinical care. Incorporat-
ing the diverse opinions and experiences of all groups af-
fected by surveillance recommendations may facilitate greater
guideline specificity and encourage more active engagement
and adherence to guideline recommendations.65
Most recommendations addressing posttreatment care in
cancer survivors are made in the context of guidelines address-
ing the diagnosis and treatment of a particular cancer; in this
context, surveillance recommendations are included but not
emphasized.Developingsurveillanceguidelinesseparatelyfrom
general cancer care guidelines may allow for the inclusion of
moreappropriatepanelists,betterfocus,andmorespecificrec-

on survivorship care could facilitate change and allow devel-
opers to focus on improving recommendation quality.
Limitations
There are several important limitations to our study. First,
we restricted our search to national cancer guidelines and
excluded regional recommendations. This approach
excluded provincial clinical practice guidelines in Canada,
although they may be widely used and influential.84 Never-
theless, including additional guidelines is likely to have
increased the variation we found and would unlikely quali-
tatively change our results. Second, this study sample was
small, and we were only able to evaluate the association
between guideline characteristics and the specificity and
consistency of recommendations using a univariable analy-
sis. Owing to the nature of the study and the limited number
of guidelines in existence, there was not an alternative
methodological approach, and this would only influence the
comparative analysis and not our primary findings. Third,
there is inherent subjectivity in the interpretation of recom-
mendations. However, we attempted to mitigate this issue
by identifying and extracting important data elements to
standardize guideline reporting and comparisons. Finally,
our study is cross-sectional and offers a snapshot in the sta-
tus of surveillance clinical practice guidelines up to March 1,
2016. Nevertheless, given the current state of cancer surveil-
lance guidelines, it is unlikely that major qualitative changes
will occur in the near future.
Conclusions
The number of cancer survivors is growing, and optimizing
cancer surveillance is an important issue for individual pa-
tients, payers, and clinicians. Our review of 41 surveillance rec-
ommendations from clinical practice guidelines across 9
cancer types found a lack of specificity and consistency that
hinders optimal patient care. As cancer guidelines are re-
viewed and revised, we believe developers should clarify rec-
ommendations with simple, nonambiguous, definitive lan-
guage for, or against, the use of specific tests and specific
recommendations based on patient risk.
