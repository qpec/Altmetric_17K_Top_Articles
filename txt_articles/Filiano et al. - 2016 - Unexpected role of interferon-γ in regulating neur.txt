Abstract
Immune dysfunction is commonly associated with several neurological and mental disorders. 
Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence neuronal function are 
largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal immunity influencing behavior, such as 
spatial learning and memory1. Here we show that meningeal immunity is also critical for social 
behavior; mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyper-connectivity of 
fronto-cortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from brain and cellular 
transcriptomes in response to T cell–derived cytokines suggest a strong interaction between social 
behavior and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) driven responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that 
inhibitory neurons respond to IFN-γ and increase GABAergic currents in projection neurons, 
suggesting that IFN-γ is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural circuits 
recruited for social behavior. Meta-analysis on the transcriptomes of a range of organisms revealed 
that rodents, fish, and flies elevate IFN-γ/JAK-STAT–dependent gene signatures in a social 
context, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway could mediate a co-evolutionary link 
between social/aggregation behavior and an efficient anti-pathogen response. This study 
implicates adaptive immune dysfunction, in particular IFN-γ, in disorders characterized by social 
dysfunction and suggests a co-evolutionary link between social behavior and an anti-pathogen 
immune response driven by IFN-γ signaling.
Social behavior is beneficial for many processes critical to the survival of an organism, 
including foraging, protection, breeding, and for higher order species, mental health2,3. 
Social dysfunction manifests in several neurological and mental disorders such as autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), frontotemporal dementia, and schizophrenia amongst others4. 
Likewise, imbalance of cytokines, a disparity of T cell subsets, and overall immune 
dysfunction is often associated with abovementioned disorders5–7. However, the 
fundamental mechanism(s) by which dysfunctional immunity may interfere with neural 
circuits and contribute to behavioral deficits remain unclear.
To test if adaptive immunity is necessary for normal social behavior, we tested SCID mice 
(deficient in adaptive immunity) using the 3-chamber sociability assay8 (Extended Data Fig. 
1a). This assay quantifies the preference of a mouse for investigating a novel mouse versus 
object, and has been used to identify deficits in multiple mouse models of disorders that 
present with social dysfunction9. Unlike wild-type mice, SCID mice lacked social 
preference for a mouse over an object (Fig. 1a). Importantly, SCID mice did not show 
anxiety, motor, or olfactory deficits (Extended Data Fig. 1b–j). We confirmed that SCID 
mice have social deficits by analyzing social interactions in a home cage (Extended Data 
Fig. 1k). To test if social deficits were reversible, we repopulated 4-week-old SCID mice 
with wild-type lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1l–n) and measured social behavior 4 
weeks post transfer. SCID mice repopulated with lymphocytes, unlike those injected with 
the vehicle, showed social preference indistinguishable from wild-type mice (Fig. 1b).

 Recent clinical findings indicate disturbed circuit homeostasis, resulting in hyper-
connectivity, is a feature of children with ASD10. Imaging studies using task-free resting 
state fMRI (rsfMRI), revealed hyper-connectivity among frontal cortical nodes in ASD 
patients11. Disturbances in resting state connectivity are also observed in mice with social 
deficits12. rsfMRI is an unbiased technique used to assess synchrony between brain regions 
over time by comparing spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level dependent 
(BOLD) signals13. To assess the influence of adaptive immunity on functional connectivity, 
we analyzed resting-state BOLD signals from wild-type and SCID mice (Extended Data Fig. 
2a). SCID mice exhibited hyper-connectivity between multiple frontal and insular regions 
(Fig. 1c, d; Extended Data Fig. 2b; Supplement Table 1) implicated in social behavior and 
ASD. Notably, repopulating SCID mice with lymphocytes rescued aberrant hyper-
connectivity observed in vehicle-treated SCID controls (Fig. 1c, d; Extended Data Fig. 2b). 
Interestingly, other functionally connected regions, not directly implicated in social function, 
such as interhemispheric connectivity between motor and somatosensory cortex were not 
affected by a deficiency in adaptive immunity (Supplement Table 1). Using another 
approach to analyze neuronal activation in a task-based system, we demonstrated that SCID 
mice exposed to a social stimulus, exhibited hyper-responsiveness in the prefrontal cortex 
(PFC; increased number of c-fos+ cells in PFC; Fig. 1e, f) but not the hippocampus 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c).
We previously demonstrated T cells influence learning behavior and exert their beneficial 
effects presumably from the meninges1,14. To address the role of meningeal T cells in social 
behavior, we decreased the extravasation of T cells into the meninges of wild-type mice 
using antibodies against VLA415, an integrin expressed on T cells (among other immune 
cells) required for CNS homing. Partial elimination of T cells from meninges (Extended 
Data Fig. 3) was sufficient to cause a loss in social preference (Fig. 1g). Despite their 
proximity to the brain, meningeal T cells do not enter the brain parenchyma, suggesting their 
effect is mediated by soluble factors. To identify which T cell–mediated pathways are 
involved in regulating social behavior, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to 
search for T cell–mediated response signatures (IFN-γ, IL-4/IL-13, IL-17, Il-10, TGF-β) in 
41 transcriptomes from mouse and rat brain cortices. GSEA assesses if the expression of a 
previously defined group of related genes is enriched in one biological state. In this case, we 
used GSEA to identify which cytokine induced response signatures were enriched in the 
transcriptomes of mice and rats exposed to different stimuli. The stimuli included: social 
aggregation, sleep deprivation, stress, psychostimulants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, 
and antipsychotics. Transcriptomes from cortices of animals exposed to social aggregation 
and psychostimulants were enriched for IFN-γ regulated genes (Fig. 1h, Extended Data Fig. 
4, and Supplementary Tables 2, 3).
A substantial number of meningeal T cells are capable to express IFN-γ (41.95% ± 6.34 of 
TCR+ cells; Extended Data Fig. 5a) and recent work has proposed a role for IFN-γ in T cell 
trafficking into meningeal spaces16. To assess the potential role of IFN-γ in mediating the 
influence of T cells on social behavior, we first examined the social behavior of IFN-γ 
deficient mice and determined that they had social deficits (Fig. 2a). Importantly, IFN-γ 
deficient mice did not show anxiety or motor deficits (Extended Data Fig. 5b–g). Similar to 
SCID mice, IFN-γ deficient mice also exhibited aberrant hyper-connectivity in fronto-

 cortical/insular regions (Fig. 2b, c; Supplement Table 1). While repopulating SCID mice 
with lymphocytes from wild-type mice restored a social preference, repopulating SCID mice 
with lymphocytes from Ifng−/− mice did not have such an effect (Extended Data Fig. 6a). 
Remarkably, a single injection of recombinant IFN-γ into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 
Ifng−/− mice was sufficient to restore their social preference when tested after 24 hours post 
injection (Fig. 2d) and reduce overall hyper-connectivity in the PFC (Extended Date Fig. 
6b). To further validate a role for IFN-γ signaling in social behavior, we tested mice deficient 
for the IFN-γ receptor (Ifngr1−/− mice) and found that they had a similar social deficit as 
Ifng−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 6c), which, as expected, was not rescued by injecting 
recombinant IFN-γ into the CSF (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Based on our previous 
demonstration of a role for IL-4 produced by meningeal T cells in spatial learning behavior1, 
we assessed whether deficiency in IL-4 would also result in social deficits. IL-4 deficient 
mice did not demonstrate social deficits; in fact, they spent more time investigating a novel 
mouse than a novel object as compared to wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 6e).
To determine which cell types in the brain respond to IFN-γ, we analyzed mouse PFC for the 
expression of IFN-γ receptor subunits 1 and 2 and found that both neurons and microglia 
express mRNA and protein for R1 and R2 subunits of the IFN-γ receptor (Fig. 2e, f; 
Extended Data Fig. 7). Microglia are CNS resident macrophages and are known to express 
the IFN-γ receptor17. However, genetically deleting STAT1, the signaling molecule 
downstream of the IFN-γ receptor, from microglia (and other cells of myeloid origin), did 
not disturb normal social preference (Extended Data Fig. 8). These results led us to focus on 
neuronal responses to IFN-γ as they relate to social behavior.
To assess a role for IFN-γ in neuronal signaling, we deleted Ifngr1 in PFC neurons via AAV 
delivery of Cre recombinase under the Synapsin I promoter (Extended Data Fig. 9). 
Attenuating IFN-γ signaling in PFC neurons was sufficient to alter mouse behavior in a 3-
chamber social task and result in a lack of social preference (Fig. 2g), reinforcing the 
importance of IFN-γ signaling on neurons for social behavior. Injecting recombinant IFN-γ 
into the CSF, activated layer I neocortical neurons as assessed by c-fos immunoreactivity 
(Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). These neurons are almost entirely inhibitory18, suggesting that 
IFN-γ may drive regional inhibition of circuits by directly activating layer I inhibitory 
neurons located in close proximity to the brain surface and CSF. To investigate mechanisms 
downstream of the IFN-γ receptor, we used VgatCre::Stat1fl/fl mice. Deletion of STAT1 from 
GABAergic inhibitory neurons was sufficient to induce deficits in social behavior (Fig. 2h), 
suggesting that the IFN-γ may be signaling through inhibitory neurons.
To directly assess if IFN-γ can drive inhibitory tone in the PFC, we measured inhibitory 
currents in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells from acutely prepared brain slices from wild-type mice. 
In addition to receiving phasic inhibitory synaptic input, these cells are also held under a 
tonic GABAergic current that serves to hyperpolarize their resting membrane potential (Fig. 
2i). Tonic GABAergic currents are extrasynaptic and can yield long-lasting network 
inhibition19. We observed that IFN-γ augmented tonic current (Fig. 2i, j, Extended Data Fig. 
10c, d), suggestive of elevated levels of ambient GABA during application of IFN-γ. 
Deleting the IFN-γ receptor from inhibitory neurons (VgatCre::Ifngr1fl/fl mice) prevented 
IFN-γ from augmenting tonic inhibitory current (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Given that IFN-γ

 promotes inhibitory tone, we tested if IFN-γ could prevent aberrant neural discharges by 
injecting IFN-γ into the CSF and then chemically inducing seizures with the GABA type A 
receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Mice injected with IFN-γ were less 
susceptible to PTZ induced seizures; IFN-γ delayed seizure onset and lowered seizure 
severity (Fig. 2k). Further, to test if overexcitation causes social deficits in IFN-γ deficit 
mice, we treated Ifng−/− mice with diazepam to augment GABAergic transmission20. 
Diazepam successfully rescued social behavior of Ifng−/− mice, similar to the effect 
observed with recombinant IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 2l), suggesting that social deficits, due to a 
deficiency in IFN-γ, may arise from inadequate control of GABAergic inhibition by IFN-γ.
It is intriguing that IFN-γ, predominately thought of as an anti-pathogen cytokine, can play 
such a profound role in maintaining proper social function. Since social behavior is crucial 
for the survival of a species and aggregation increases the likeliness of spreading pathogens, 
we hypothesized that there was co-evolutionary pressure to increase an anti-pathogen 
response as sociability increased, and that the IFN-γ pathway may have influenced this co-
evolution. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed metadata of publically available 
transcriptomes from multiple organisms including the rat, mouse, zebrafish, and fruit flies. 
Using GSEA, we determined transcripts from social rodents (acutely group-housed) are 
enriched for an IFN-γ responsive gene signature (Fig. 3a, b; Supplementary Tables 3–7). 
Conversely, rodents that experienced social isolation demonstrated a dramatic loss of the 
IFN-γ responsive gene signature (Supplementary Tables 3–7). Zebrafish and flies showed a 
similar association between anti-pathogen and social responses (Fig. 3c, d). We observed 
that immune response programs were highly enriched in the brain transcriptomes of flies 
selected for low aggressiveness traits (a physiological correlate for socially experienced 
flies21; Fig. 3d; Supplementary Tables 3–7). We next analyzed the promoters of these highly 
upregulated social genes and found them to be enriched for STAT1 transcription factor 
binding motifs (Fig. 3a–d). These data suggest, even in the absence of infection, an IFN-γ 
gene signature is upregulated in aggregated organisms. This is consistent with an interaction 
between social behavior and the anti-pathogen response, a dynamic that could be mediated 
by the IFN-γ pathway. Since low-aggressive flies upregulate genes in the JAK/STAT 
pathway (canonically downstream of IFN-γ receptors in higher species), yet lack IFN-γ or T 
cells, it is intriguing to speculate that T cell–derived IFN-γ may have evolved in higher 
species to more efficiently regulate an anti-pathogen response during increased aggregation 
of individuals.
Our results reveal a novel role for meningeal immunity in regulating neural activity and 
social behavior through IFN-γ. The role of immune molecules has been previously shown to 
control brain development and function22–26 and a role for cytokines in influencing behavior 
has been proposed, primarily in the context of sickness behavior and pain27,28. These 
signaling paradigms, however, have predominately focused on peripheral nerves and non-
neuronal targets. Here we show that CNS neurons directly respond to IFN-γ derived from 
meningeal T cells to elevate tonic GABAergic inhibition and prevent aberrant hyper-
excitability in the PFC. These data suggest that social deficits in numerous neurological and 
psychiatric disorders may result from impaired circuitry homeostasis derived from 
dysfunctional immunity. Based on our findings, it is also plausible that subtle homeostatic 
changes in meningeal immunity may also contribute to modulating neuronal circuits that are

 responsible for our everyday behaviors and personality. Given this communication between 
immunity and neuronal circuits29, it is intriguing to hypothesize that these pathways may be 
vulnerable to manipulation by fast-evolving pathogens. Better comprehension of these 
pathways could improve our understanding of the etiology of neurodevelopmental and 
neuropsychiatric disorders associated with maternal infections and/or aberrant inflammation 
and may result in the development of new therapeutic targets.
 Methods
 Mice
All mice (C57BL/6) were either bred in-house or purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. 
For each individual experiment, the control mice were obtained from the same institution as 
test mice. In the case that mice were purchased, they were maintained for at least one week 
to habituate prior to manipulation/experimentation. When possible, mice used for 
experiments were littermates. These include all electrophysiology experiments, all cohorts 
using Stat1fl/fl mice, experiments analyzing induced seizures, experiments counting c-fos+ 
neurons, and experiments using Il4−/− mice. Experiments assessing the social behavior of 
SCID mice using the 3-chamber assay include mice breed in-house and mice purchased 
from the Jackson Laboratory. All other experiment used mice purchased from the Jackson 
Laboratory. Experimental groups were blinded and randomly assigned prior to the start of 
experimentation and remained blinded until all data were collected. Mice were housed under 
standard 12 hour light/dark cycle conditions in rooms equipped to control for temperature 
and humidity. Unless stated otherwise, male mice were tested at 8–10 weeks of age. Sample 
sizes were chosen based on a power analysis using estimates from previously published 
experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee of the University of Virginia.
 Behavior
For cohorts tested with multiple behavioral assay, the elevated plus-maze was performed 
first and then followed by the open field before any other assay. Prior to all experiments, 
mice were transported to the behavior room and given 1 hour to habituate. All behavioral 
testing was conducted during daylight hours.
 Elevated Plus-Maze
Mice were placed into the center hub and allowed to explore the plus-maze for 10 minutes. 
Video tracking software (CleverSys) was used to quantify time spent in the open arms.
 Open Field
Mice were placed into the open field (35cm × 35cm) and allowed to explore for 15 minutes. 
Total distance and time spent in the center (23cm × 23cm) were quantified using video 
tracking software (CleverSys).

  Rotarod
Mice were placed on an accelerating rotarod (MedAssociates) that accelerated from 4.0–40 
rpm over 5 minutes. Infrared beams were used to quantify the latency of a mouse to fall of 
the rod. Mice were given 6 trials with a 4-hour break between trial 3 and 4.
 Three-chamber sociability assay
The three-chamber sociability test was conducted as previously described31. Briefly, mice 
were transported to the testing room and habituated for at least one hour. The room was 
maintained in dim light and a white noise generator used to mitigate any unforeseen noises. 
Test boxes were fabricated, in-house, by a machine shop. Test mice were placed in the center 
chamber with the two outer chambers containing empty wire cages (Spectrum Diversified 
Designs) and allowed to explore for ten minutes (habituation phase). After the habituation 
phase, mice were return to the center chamber. A novel mouse (an 8–10 week old male 
C57BL/6J ~ 18–22g) was placed under one cup and an object placed under the other. Prior 
to testing, the novel mouse was habituated to the cup by being placed under the cup for 10 
minutes, 3 times a day for 5 days. Mice were allowed to explore for an additional ten 
minutes (social phase). A video tracking system (CleverSys) was used to quantify the time 
spent around each target. For 3-chamber experiments comparing social behavior between 
wild-type and SCID mice, data collected using males and females were combined because 
no significant effects were found between genders. When females were tested, juvenile 
C57BL/6J male (approximately 4 weeks old) mice were used as novel demonstrators.
 Novel/Social environment
Mice were single housed and maintained un-manipulated for 5 days, then placed in a novel/
social environment with a mouse (opposite sex and identical scid genotype) under video 
surveillance as previously described31. After 2 hours, mice were sacrificed and prepared for 
immunohistochemistry as described below. The time spent interacting was measured by a 
blinded observer for 5 minutes at the 30, 60, and 90 minute post-introduction time points.
 Resting-state fMRI
The protocol for rsfMRI was adapted from Zhan et al.32. Mice were maintained under light 
anesthesia with (1–1.25%) isoflurane and images were acquired on a 7.0 Tesla MRI 
Clinscan system (Bruker, Etlingen, Germany) using a 30-mm inner-diameter mouse whole-
body radiofrequency coil. High-resolution structural images were acquired by collecting 16 
× 0.7mm thick coronal slices using TR/TE 5,500/65ms and an 180° flip angle. A BOLD 
rsfMRI time series of 16 × 0.7mm thick coronal slices were collected using TR/TE 
4,000/17ms and a 60° flip angle. For analysis, a structural template33 was custom labeled 
using “The Mouse Brain” by Paxinos and Franklin as reference (Extended Data Fig. 3). The 
non-rigid transformation between the template and each individual mouse was estimated 
using the open source Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package34 that was then used 
to propagate the regional labels to each subject. Cleaning of the bold fMRI data was 
performed using tools available in ANTsR35 – a statistical and visualization interface 
between ANTs and the R statistical project. fMRI preprocessing consisted of motion 
correction36, band pass filtering (freq. = [0.002, 0.1]), and CompCor estimation37. The

 correlation matrix was determined from the clean fMRI data using the regions labels. To 
determine if the functional connectivity between sample groups was significantly different, 
we tested for the equality of their corresponding correlation matrices. First, an aggregate 
correlation matrix was constructed for each group by calculating the median value for each 
connection, and then the aggregate matrices were compared using the Jennrich test38, as 
implemented in the cortest.jennrich function in the R psych package. To create a functional 
connectivity network for a sample group, a correlation threshold was applied to the 
connections between regions of interest. If a connection strength was above the threshold, it 
was kept as an edge in the network, otherwise it was discarded. When comparing networks 
from multiple sample groups, the threshold was determined by calculating the maximum 
threshold that leaves one of the networks connected (i.e., it is possible to reach any node in 
the network from any other node).
 Immunohistochemistry
Mice were sacrificed under Euthasol then transcardially perfused with PBS with heparin. 
Brains were removed and drop fixed in 4% PFA for 48 hours. After fixation, brains were 
washed with PBS, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, then frozen in O.C.T. compound 
(Sakura Finetek) and sliced (40μM) with a cryostat (Leica). Free-floating sections were 
maintained in PBS + Azide (0.02%) until further processing. Immunohistochemistry for c-
fos (1:1000 dilution; Millipore) on free-floating sections was performed as previously 
described39.
 Depletion of Meningeal T cells
A rat monoclonal antibody to murine VLA4 (clone PS/2) was affinity purified from 
hybridoma supernatants and was used with the kind permission of Dr. Klaus Ley (La Jolla 
Institute of Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA). Mice were given two separate 
injections (i.p.; 0.2mg in saline per mouse), four days apart, of either anti-VLA4 or rat anti-
HRP for control (clone HRPN; BioXcell), then tested twenty-four hours post final injection.
 Dissection of meninges and flow cytometry
Meninges were dissected as previously described40. Briefly, after sacrificing and perfusing, 
skulls caps were removed by making an incision along the parietal and squamosal bones. 
The meninges were removed from the internal side of the skull cap and gently pressed 
through a 70 μm nylon mesh cell strainer with sterile plastic plunger (BD Biosciences) to 
isolate a single cell suspension. Cells were then centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 10 min, 
resuspended in cold FACS buffer (pH 7,4; 0.1 M PBS; 1 mM EDTA; 1% BSA), and stained 
for extracellular markers using the following antibodies at a 1:200 dilution: CD45 PerCP-
Cyanine5.5 (eBioscience), TCR BV510 (BD Bioscience), CD4 FITC (eBioscience), L/D 
Zombie NIR (BioLegend). To measure intracellular IFN-γ, single cell isolates from 
meninges were maintained in T cell isolation buffer (RPMI + 2% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 
1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 1X non-essential amino acids, and 1X Antibiotic-
Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher) and stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (Cell Stimulation 
Cocktail – eBioscience) + 10 μg/ml brefeldin A at 37°C prior to extracellular staining as 
stated above. Cells were then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and 
stained with IFN-γ APC (eBioscience; clone XMG1.2).

 To measure expression of IFN-γ receptors, brains were removed and placed in Neurobasal 
media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The meninges were removed from the brain and 
the frontal cortex was micro-dissected under a dissection microscope. Using a 2 mL dounce 
homogenizer, brains were homogenized in Neurobasal media with 50U/mL Dnase I. The 
homogenate was passed through a 70μm nylon filter and washed with cold FACS buffer. 
IFNGR were labeled with anti-IFNGR1 Biotin (BD Pharmingen; GR20) or rabbit anti-
IFNGR2 (Santa Cruz; M-20). Cells were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with FITC 
conjugated streptavidin or 488 conjugated chicken anti-rabbit. Next, cells were washed again 
then incubated with CD11B PE-Cyanine7 (eBioscience), L/D Zombie NIR (BioLegend), 
and Hoechst for 45 minutes. Cells were washed, then permeabilized and fixed with Cytofix/
Cytoperm (BD Biosciences). After another wash with permeabilization wash buffer (PBS 
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium azide, and 1% saponin; pH 7.4), cells were 
incubated overnight with NeuN PE (Millipore). Cells underwent a final wash and again 
passed through a 70μm nylon filter. Samples were run on a flow cytometer Gallios 
(Beckman Coulter) then analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar).
 SCID repopulation
SCID mice were repopulated with cells from spleen and lymph nodes (axillary, brachial, 
cervical, inguinal, and lumbar). Spleen and lymph nodes were collected from a 3–4 week old 
donor and passed through a 70μm nylon mesh cell strainer with a sterile plastic plunger. 
ACK buffer was used to lyse red blood cells prior to washing with saline. Cells were counted 
on an automated cell counter (Nexcelom) and injected (i.v.) at 5×106 cells in 250μL of saline 
(control mice were injected with 250μL of saline only). For injections, the animal technician 
was blinded to the genotype of the mice and the content of the injection. Thus, all groups 
were handled identically. Mice aged 3–4 weeks were carefully placed into a tail vein 
injection platform. Their tails were briefly warmed using a heating pad and saline with cells 
or saline alone was slowly injected into the tail vein using a 28G needle. After the injection, 
mice were returned to their home cage.
 IFN-γ injections
Mice were anaesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine [ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine 
(10mg/kg)] injection (i.p.) or isoflurane (2%), then placed into a stereotaxic frame with the 
head at an approximately 45° angle. The skin above cisterna magna was cleaned and sanitize 
before a 1 cm incision was made. The underlying muscles were separated with forceps, 
retracted, and a small Hamilton syringe (33G) was used to slowly inject 1uL of saline or 
IFN-γ (20ng; eBioscience) into the cisterna magna (i.c.m.). After injection the syringe was 
held in place for 5 minutes to avoid back-flow of CSF. After the syringe was removed, 
muscles were put back in place and skin was sutured. Mice were placed on a heating pad 
and given ketoprofen and baytril for recovery.
 Induced seizures
IFN-γ was injected (i.c.m.) into the CSF through the cisterna magna (i.c.m.), as described 
above, 24 hours prior to inducing seizures. Control mice were injected with the same volume 
of saline. To induce seizures, mice were injected with PTZ (40mg/kg; i.p.). After injection,

 mice were placed into an empty housing cage and recorded for video analysis. Seizures were 
analyzed by a blinded observer using a behavior scoring system previously published41.
 Diazepam treatment
Diazepam (1.25mg/kg) was delivered i.p. for 30 minutes prior to testing for social behavior.
 Fluorescent in situ hybridization
Mice were euthanized then transcardially perused with PBS with heparin followed by 4% 
PFA. Brains were then removed and drop fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours, frozen in OCT, and 
12μM sections were cut on a cryostat. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed using 
RNA ISH tissue assay kits (Affymetrix) following the manufacture’s protocol. Tissues were 
treated with protease for 20 minutes at 40°C. 63× Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8 
confocal system (Leica Microsystems) using the LAS AF Software.
 AAV Delivery
AAV1.hSyn.HI.eGFP-Cre.WPRE.SV40 and AAV1.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.bGH were purchased 
from Penn Vector Core. IFNGR1fl/fl mice were purchased from the Jackson lab. After 1 
week of habituation, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and injected bilaterally with 
2×1010 genome copies of AAV virus in 1 μL at stereotaxic coordinates: +2.5μM bregma A/P, 
0.25μM lateral, 1.25μM deep.
 Measuring inhibitory currents
Visualized whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on layer 2/3 prefrontal 
cortical neurons prepared from acute brain slices (adult) using the protective recovery 
method42. Recordings were performed in 34°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) 
containing (in mM) 131.5 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 12 D-glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 
CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2. ACSF also contained 3mM kynurenic acid to block synaptic excitation 
and 2.5mM NO-711 to enhance tonic inhibition43. Slices were incubated in this ACSF for 
5–10 minutes prior to placement in the recording chamber. The patch pipette solution with 
elevated chloride contained (in mM) 140 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.05 EGTA, 2 
Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Mg-GTP43. Once recordings equilibrated, baseline holding current in 
ACSF was measured for 3.5 minutes, after which ACSF containing IFN-γ (20pg/mL) was 
applied for 8.5 minutes and then washed. Data presented show the mean holding current 
during the last minute of control (ACSF) and drug (ACSF+IFN-γ) conditions.
 RNA isolation and sequencing
8 week old, male mice were purchased from The Jackson Lab and housed in standard 
housing boxes either 4 mice per cage or isolated for 6 days. Mice were euthanized as 
described above and the PFC was microdissected under a dissection microscope. RNA was 
isolated using RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and a cDNA library was generated with a TruSeq 
Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) with Agencourt AMPure XP beads for PCR 
cleanup. Samples were loaded onto a NextSeq 500 High-output 75 cycle cartridge and 
sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina).

  Transcriptome analysis
Raw FASTQ sequencing reads were chastity filtered to remove clusters having outlying 
intensity corresponding to bases other than the called base. Filtered reads were assessed for 
quality using FastQC44. Reads were splice-aware aligned to the UCSC mm9 genome using 
STAR45, and reads overlapping UCSC mm9 gene regions were counted using 
featureCounts46. The DESeq2 Bioconductor package47 in the R statistical computing 
environment48 was used for normalizing count data, performing exploratory data analysis, 
estimating dispersion, and fitting a negative binomial model for each gene comparing the 
expression from the PFC of mice in a social environment versus isolation. After obtaining a 
list of differentially expressed genes, log fold changes, and P-values, Benjamini-Hochberg 
False Discovery Rate procedure was used to correct P-values for multiple testing. A Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm49 was applied to identify the enrichment of 
transcriptional signatures and molecular pathways in PFC transcriptomes of mice exposed to 
group and isolation housing conditions. 4726 publicly available transcriptional signatures 
were obtained from the molecular Signature Database C2 version 4.0 and GSEA was used to 
examine the distribution of these curated gene sets in lists of genes ordered according to 
differential expression between group and isolation housing conditions. The statistical 
analysis was performed by evaluation of nominal P-value and normalized enrichment score 
(NES) based on 1,000 random sample permutations.
 Meta-data analysis
The custom-made IFN-γ and pathogen-induced transcriptional signatures (Supplementary 
Table 2) were generated by retrieving genes upregulated ≥ 2 fold following IFN-γ 
stimulation or pathogen infection. All custom signatures were derived from publicly 
available transcriptomes downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Specifically, 
mammalian IFN-γ transcriptional signatures were derived from transcriptomes: GSE33057, 
GSE19182, GSE36287, GSE9659, GSE1432 and GSE6353. Zebrafish IFN-γ transcriptional 
signature was used as described50. Drosophila pathogen-induced JAK/STAT-dependent 
transcriptional signatures were derived from transcriptomes: GSE54833 and GSE2828.
A GSEA algorithm was applied to identify the enrichment of custom-made mammalian 
IFN-γ transcriptional signatures in the publicly available brain cortex transcriptomes of mice 
and rats exposed to: social aggregation, sleep deprivation, stress, psychostimulants (DOI, 
cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, caffeine, nicotine and 
modafinil), antipsychotics (olanzapine, haloperidol and risperidone), anticonvulsants 
(levetiracetam, phenytoin, ethosuximide and oxcarbazepine), and antidepressants 
(iproniazid, moclobemide, paroxetine and phenelzine). In total, 41 transcriptomes were 
analyzed as indicated in Supplementary Table 2. The statistical analysis was performed by 
evaluation of nominal P-value and NES based on 1,000 random sample permutations. 
Zebrafish are social fish that aggregate into shoals51–54. Various Zebrafish strains differ in 
their preference for social interaction and novelty, resembling the phenotypic variation of 
inbred mouse strains55,56. Notably, domesticated zebrafish strains demonstrate higher social 
interaction and social novelty preference57–59 compared to wild zebrafish strains. Therefore, 
a GSEA algorithm was used to identify the enrichment of Zebrafish IFN-γ transcriptional 
signature in the publicly available whole-brain transcriptomic profiles of behaviorally

 distinct strains of domesticated and wild zebrafish (Supplementary Table 7). The brain 
transcriptomic profiles of domesticated (Scientific Hatcheries (SH) and Transgenic Mosaic 1 
(TM1)) and wild (Nadia, Gaighata) zebrafish strains were derived from publicly available 
transcriptome data set: GSE38729. The statistical analysis was performed by evaluation of 
nominal P-value and NES based on 1,000 random gene set permutations.
Social interactions in Drosophila melanogaster flies play an important role in courtship, 
mating, egg-laying, circadian timing, food search and even life-span determination60–65. 
Notably, a number of studies have demonstrated that social isolation leads to an aggressive 
behavior in Drosophila flies, whereas group housing suppresses the aggressiveness66–68. 
Therefore, we employed a GSEA algorithm to identify the enrichment of JAK/STAT-
dependent transcriptional signatures in the publicly available brain transcriptomes of 
Drosophila populations that were socially-induced or genetically-selected for low-aggressive 
(i.e. social) behavior (Supplementary Table 7). The transcriptomic profiles were derived 
from publicly available transcriptome data sets: GSE5404 and GSE6994. The statistical 
analysis was performed by evaluation of nominal P-value and NES based on 1,000 random 
gene set permutations.
 Promoter Motif analysis
A GSEA algorithm was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in brain 
transcriptomes of mice and rats exposed to social aggregation, domesticated Zebrafish 
strains and low-aggressive Drosophila melanogaster populations, compared to their control 
counterparts. High-scoring differentially expressed “leading-edge” social genes were 
selected based on their presence in the IFN-γ and pathogen-induced transcriptional 
signatures. Specifically, as shown in Figure 3, we have identified 31, 48, 14, 53 leading-edge 
genes in brain transcriptomes of mice and rats exposed to social aggregation, domesticated 
Zebrafish strain, and low-aggressive Drosophila melanogaster population, respectively. We 
next, extracted promoter sequences of 200bp up-stream of TSS of these “leading edge” 
genes using UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). The MEME suite was then 
used to discover overrepresented transcription factor binding motifs, as described69. MEME 
parameters used were any number of motif repetitions per sequence, with a minimum motif 
width of 5 bases and maximum motif width of 15 bases. The discovered MEME motifs were 
compared using Tomtom analysis. In this case, the Tomtom motif similarity analysis ranks 
the MEME motif most similar to the Vertebrates in vivo and in silico, canonical motif for 
STAT. The statistics was determined using Euclidean distance.
 Circos plot
A GSEA algorithm was applied to identify the enrichment of IFN-γ, IL-4/IL-13, IL-17, and 
IL-10/TGF-β signaling pathways in the brain transcriptomes of rodent animals exposed to: 
social aggregation, stress, psychostimulants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. All custom 
signatures were derived from publically available rodent transcriptomes downloaded from 
Gene Expression Omnibus. Statistical significance of GSEA results was assessed using 
1,000 sample permutations. A NES greater than 1.5 and nominal P-value less than 0.05 was 
used to determined pairwise transcriptome connectivity. Circos graph was generated using 
circos package 0.68.1270.

  Statistics
Data were analyzed using the statistical methods stated in each figure legend. For the 3-
chamber assay, a 2-way ANOVA was performed using genotype/treatment and sociability as 
main effects, followed by applying a Sidak’s post-hoc comparison to assess if the group had 
a significant social preference. Prior to running an ANOVA, an equality of variance was 
determined by using a Brown-Forsythe test. Bars display the means, and error bars represent 
ranges of the standard error of the mean. For rsfMRI, data were analyzed using a 1-way 
ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s test. The box and whisker plots extend to the 25th 
and 75th percentiles and the center line indicates the mean. The whiskers represent the min 
and max data points. Data for seizure latency was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA with 
repeated measures followed by a post-hoc Sidak test. Additional details of statistical analysis 
are supplied in Supplementary Table 8.

 Figure 3. Over-representation of IFN-γ transcriptional signature genes in social behavior-
associated brain transcriptomes of rat, mouse, zebrafish, and drosophila
GSEA plots demonstrate the over-representation of IFN-γ transcriptional signatures (derived 
from Molecular Signature Database C2, GSE33057, or Lopez-Munoz, A. et al30) in brain 
transcriptomes of (a) mice and (b) rats subjected to social or isolated housing and in brain 
transcriptomes of (c) domesticated zebrafish compared to a wild zebrafish strain. (d) Over-
representation of JAK/STAT pathway transcriptional signature genes (derived from 
GSE2828) in head transcriptomes of flies selected for low-aggressive behavior (behavioral 
readout for social behavior in flies (see methods section “Meta-data analysis” for more 
details)). Genes are ranked into an ordered list according to their differential expression. The 
middle part of the plot is a bar code demonstrating the distribution of genes in the IFN-γ 
transcriptional signature gene set against the ranked list of genes. The list on the right shows 
the top genes in the leading edge subset. Promoter regions of these genes were scanned for 
transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using MEME suite. MEME output demonstrates 
significant STAT TFBS enrichment in cis-regulatory regions of leading edge genes up-
regulated in a social context.
