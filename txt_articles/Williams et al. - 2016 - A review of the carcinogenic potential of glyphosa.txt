ABSTRACT
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published a monograph in 2015 concluding
that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A) based on limited evidence in humans
and sufficient evidence in experimental animals. It was also concluded that there was strong evidence
of genotoxicity and oxidative stress. Four Expert Panels have been convened for the purpose of con-
ducting a detailed critique of the evidence in light of IARC’s assessment and to review all relevant infor-
mation pertaining to glyphosate exposure, animal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and epidemiologic
studies. Two of the Panels (animal bioassay and genetic toxicology) also provided a critique of the IARC
position with respect to conclusions made in these areas. The incidences of neoplasms in the animal
bioassays were found not to be associated with glyphosate exposure on the basis that they lacked stat-
istical strength, were inconsistent across studies, lacked dose-response relationships, were not associ-
ated with preneoplasia, and/or were not plausible from a mechanistic perspective. The overall weight
of evidence from the genetic toxicology data supports a conclusion that glyphosate (including GBFs
and AMPA) does not pose a genotoxic hazard and therefore, should not be considered support for the
classification of glyphosate as a genotoxic carcinogen. The assessment of the epidemiological data
found that the data do not support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma while the data were judged to be too sparse to assess a potential relationship
between glyphosate exposure and multiple myeloma. As a result, following the review of the totality of
the evidence, the Panels concluded that the data do not support IARC’s conclusion that glyphosate is a
“probable human carcinogen” and, consistent with previous regulatory assessments, further concluded
that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.

Introduction
Background on glyphosate
Glyphosate, or N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (CAS# 1071-83-6),
is a widely used broad-spectrum, nonselective post-emergent
herbicide that has been in use since 1974. Glyphosate effect-
ively suppresses the growth of many species of trees, grasses,
and weeds. Glyphosate works by interfering with the synthe-
sis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
tryptophan, through the inhibition of the enzyme 5-enolpyru-
vylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Inhibition of the
synthesis of these amino acids stops growth of plants such as
weeds. Importantly, EPSPS is not present in mammals, which
obtain their essential aromatic amino acids from the diet.
A wide variety of new uses have been developed for gly-
phosate in agricultural, industrial, and home & garden appli-
cations. Glyphosate accounts for approximately 25% of the
global
herbicide
market
(http://www.glyphosate.eu).
Glyphosate is currently marketed under numerous trade
names by more than 50 companies in several hundreds of
crop protection products around the world. More than 160
countries have approved uses of glyphosate-based herbicide
products (http://www.monsanto.com). To further enhance the
effectiveness of glyphosate in agriculture, a number of genet-
ically modified crop varieties have been developed which are
tolerant to glyphosate (i.e. allows for application after emer-
gence of the crops). In addition, given its effectiveness and
broad-spectrum activity, glyphosate is also used worldwide
for forestry, rights of way, landscape, and household control
of weeds.
Glyphosate is a relatively simple molecule which consists
of the amino acid glycine and a phosphonomethyl moiety
(Figure 1). As such, glyphosate has no structural alerts for
chromosomal damage, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, or carcino-
genicity when analyzed by DEREK (Deductive Estimation of
Risk from Existing Knowledge) (Kier & Kirkland 2013). It is a
polar molecule that is incompletely (15–36%) absorbed orally,
undergoes
very
little
biotransformation,
and
is
rapidly
excreted unmetabolized (Williams et al. 2000). A molecule
with these characteristics would be expected to exhibit, if
any, only a low order of toxicity. The results from toxicity
studies and regulatory risk assessments have been consistent
with that expectation (JMPR 1987, 2006; US EPA 1993; WHO
1994; Williams et al. 2000; European Commission 2002; EFSA
2015).
Previous assessments of the carcinogenicity of
glyphosate
The safety, including the potential carcinogenicity, of glypho-
sate has been reviewed by scientists and regulatory author-
ities worldwide, including the US Environmental Protection
Agency
(US
EPA),
the
European
Commission,
and
the
Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency (Health and
Welfare Canada 1991; US EPA 1993, 2013; WHO 1994;
Williams et al. 2000; European Commission 2002; Kier &
Kirkland 2013; EFSA 2015; Health Canada 2015; JMPR 2016).
The conclusion of all these reviews is that proper use of gly-
phosate and glyphosate-based formulations (GBFs) does not
pose a genotoxic or carcinogenic hazard/risk to humans.
The first assessment of glyphosate’s carcinogenic potential
was undertaken by the US EPA in 1985. This review was done
by a US EPA panel that then was called the Toxicology
Branch Ad Hoc Committee, which comprised members of the
Toxicology Branch of the Hazard Evaluation Division. At that
time, two chronic animal bioassays were available: a com-
bined
chronic
toxicity/carcinogenicity
study
in
Sprague-
Dawley rats and a carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice. The
Agency concluded that the data did not demonstrate a car-
cinogenic response in rats. However, the US EPA also con-
cluded
that
the
dose
levels
used
in
that
study
were
inadequate for assessing glyphosate’s carcinogenic potential
in this species. The US EPA concluded that there was limited
evidence of an increased incidence of renal tubule adenomas
in male mice at the high-dose level (4841 mg/kg/day), a dose
that greatly exceeds the limit dose level (1000 mg/kg/day) for
carcinogenicity testing with pesticides (OECD 2009). Based on
this information, the Agency initially classified glyphosate as
a Group C (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with
limited animal evidence and little or no human data) carcino-
gen (see US EPA 1991a).
The kidney slides from the mouse study were subse-
quently reexamined by a consulting pathologist (Dr. Marvin
Kuschner M.D., Dean, School of Medicine, State University of
New York at Stony Brook), and three other scientists (Dr.
Robert A. Squire, Robert A. Squire Associates Inc., Ruxton
Maryland; Dr. Klaus L. Stemmer M.D., Kettering Laboratory,
University of Cincinnati Medical Center; Dr. Robert E. Olson,
M.D.,
Ph.D.,
Professor
of
Medicine
and
Pharmacological
Sciences, State University of New York at Stony Brook) also
reviewed the slides and/or the chronic toxicity data. All these
scientists concluded that there was no relationship to treat-
ment (US EPA, 1986a). In addition, a Pathology Working
Group (PWG), consisting of 5 pathologists (Dr. RM Sauer,
Dr. MR Anver, Dr. JD Strandberg, Dr. JM Ward, and Dr. DG
Goodman), was also assembled and they issued the following
conclusion: “This PWG firmly believes and unanimously con-
curs with the original pathologist and reviewing pathologist
that the incidences of renal tubular cell neoplasms in this
study are not compound related” (US EPA 1986a).
All available information was presented to an US EPA
FIFRA Science Advisory Panel (SAP) in February 1986. The SAP
determined that the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate
could not be determined from the existing data and pro-
posed that a chronic rat and/or mouse study be conducted
Figure 1. Structure of glyphosate.

G. M. WILLIAMS ET AL.
 in order to clarify these unresolved questions; the panel
also proposed that glyphosate be categorized as Group D or
having “inadequate animal evidence of oncogenicity” (US
EPA 1986b).
After considering the SAP’s conclusions and recommenda-
tions, the US EPA requested that a new 2-year rat oncogen-
icity study be conducted. In 1991, after the new rat study
was completed, the US EPA re-convened its Carcinogenicity
Peer Review Committee to review the results of this study as
well as all of the relevant scientific data on glyphosate (US
EPA
1991a).
The
Committee
concluded
that
glyphosate
should be classified in Group E (evidence of non-carcinogen-
icity) based upon the lack of a carcinogenic response in two
animal species. Subsequent reevaluations by US EPA (1993,
2012, 2013) have re-affirmed the Agency’s earlier conclusion.
After Monsanto had marketed glyphosate-based herbicide
products for a number of years, other companies entered the
glyphosate market; as a result, some of them generated sub-
stantial, or even complete, additional toxicology databases.
The first additional databases that became available were
generated by Cheminova and Syngenta in the mid- to late
1990s timeframe. Additional data packages were subse-
quently generated by other companies (e.g. Arysta, Excel,
Feinchemie, Nufarm) and became available in the mid- and
late 2000s timeframe.
In addition to new studies conducted to meet regulatory
guidelines
and
support
various
re-registration
processes
globally, new epidemiology and genotoxicity studies (testing
glyphosate
and
glyphosate-based
herbicide
formulations)
began to appear in the scientific literature in the late 1990s
and early 2000s. One of the first epidemiological investiga-
tions of interest involving glyphosate published in the scien-
tific literature was that of Hardell and Eriksson (1999), and
other epidemiology studies were periodically published after
2000 up until the present. Genetic toxicology studies of gly-
phosate and GBFs began to appear in the literature in
increasing numbers throughout the 1990s and were reviewed
by Williams et al. (2000). The occurrence of such studies has
increased during the 2001–2015 timeframe: approximately
125 such genotoxicity studies were reviewed by Kier and
Kirkland (2013), and an additional 40 genotoxicity biomoni-
toring studies of GBFs were reviewed by Kier (2015).
As
glyphosate
underwent
reregistration
processes
by
major national regulatory authorities and additional reviews
by
other
health
agencies
after
2000,
these
evaluations
included more and more of the new toxicology, genotoxicity,
and epidemiology information generated after the initial
Monsanto animal bioassay studies. For example, a 2004 Joint
Meeting of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues
(JMPR) in Food and the Environment and the WHO Core
Assessment Group concluded that there was an absence of
carcinogenic potential in animals and a lack of genotoxicity
in standard tests; thus, “the Meeting concluded that glypho-
sate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans” (JMPR
2006). The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines
Authority (APVMA) evaluated the active ingredient and con-
cluded that the evidence shows that glyphosate is not geno-
toxic or carcinogenic (APVMA 2013). The US EPA conducted a
comprehensive
Human
Health
Risk
Assessment
in
2012
(US EPA 2012). The Agency noted that “no evidence of car-
cinogenicity was found in mice or rats,” and US EPA con-
cluded that “glyphosate does not pose a cancer risk to
humans”
(US
EPA
2013).
Health
Canada’s
Pesticide
Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) completed a com-
prehensive review of glyphosate as part of the reregistration
process in that country. PMRA concluded that “the overall
weight of evidence indicates that glyphosate is unlikely to
pose a human cancer risk” (Health Canada 2015). The com-
plete genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and human epidemiology
databases were evaluated by the German Federal Institute for
Risk Assessment (BfR) for the European Commission on the
Annex 1 renewal of glyphosate. The BfR concluded that gly-
phosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans
(Markard 2014). This conclusion was supported by the peer
review evaluation conducted by the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) both before and after a mandate from the
European Commission to consider the findings from IARC
regarding glyphosate’s carcinogenic potential (EFSA 2015).
Most recently, JMPR (2016) reviewed the data and concluded
that: “glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to
humans from exposure through the diet.”
IARC assessment of the carcinogenicity of glyphosate
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in
2015 undertook an evaluation of the oncogenic potential of
glyphosate as part of its Monograph Programme. Glyphosate,
along with four other pesticides (the insecticides diazinon,
malathion, parathion, and tetrachlorvinphos), was considered
by an IARC Working Group, which met in March 2015 at IARC
in Lyon, France. A brief summary of IARC’s conclusions was
initially published in The Lancet Oncology on 20 March 2015
(Guyton et al. 2015), and the full IARC Monograph (Volume
112) was published online on 29 July 2015 (IARC 2015). IARC
concluded
that
glyphosate
is
“probably
carcinogenic
to
humans (Group 2A)” based on limited evidence in humans
and sufficient evidence in experimental animals; it was also
concluded that there was strong evidence of genotoxicity
and oxidative stress (IARC 2015).
Expert Panel critique of the IARC assessment and review
of relevant data
Since the IARC conclusions were found to be in such stark
contrast to those from all other assessments of carcinogenic
potential, it was decided that a thorough review should be
conducted by scientists in the area of cancer risk assessment,
critiquing IARC’s processes where appropriate. Toward that
end, Intertek Scientific & Regulatory Consultancy (Intertek,
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was commissioned by the
Monsanto Company to assemble panels of scientific experts
in the four areas considered by IARC: exposure; epidemiology;
cancer in experimental animals; mechanistic and other rele-
vant data (focused on genotoxicity and oxidative stress).
Fifteen scientific experts were selected on the basis of
their expertise and standing within the international scientific
community (i.e. publication history, participation in scientific
CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
5
 and regulatory committees, and familiarity with regulatory
authorities) and recruited by Intertek to participate on these
Expert Panels. Panelists were recruited and assigned to one
of the four areas considered by IARC (noted above) based on
their areas of expertise; two panelists participated in two
areas. A sixteenth scientific expert from Intertek participated
on the Expert Panels and served as the overall organizer and
facilitator for the panel meetings. A listing of the experts,
their affiliations, and the specific “Panel” on which they
served is presented in Table 1.
Prior to the meeting, all key studies/publications cited by
IARC were made available to the panelists for their review;
panelists were told to request any additional information
they felt was necessary for them to conduct a thorough
evaluation. The epidemiology panel conducted its own inde-
pendent literature search. The scientists were asked to closely
examine the studies/data that IARC used to come to their
conclusions; panelists were also advised to examine any add-
itional information needed to come to an overall conclusion
in their respective areas.
Based on the scope of the information to be evaluated, it
was decided that the panels would meet over a 2-day period
to discuss all relevant information and make appropriate con-
clusions regarding the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate.
As needed, the expert scientists held pre-meeting phone con-
ferences and communicated via email to establish and plan
how they would prepare for and conduct their review at the
Expert Panels review meeting. Since the amount, nature, and
quality of the data used by IARC varied considerably across
the four areas, the evaluation approaches used by the expert
panelists in their specialist areas varied somewhat as well.
The Expert Panels Meeting was held on 27–28 August 2015
at Intertek in Mississauga, Canada. On the first day of the
meeting, the discussions focused on the exposure and human
epidemiology data. The second day of the meeting began
with a summation of epidemiology and exposure discussions/
conclusions and then focused on the animal bioassay and
genotoxicity/oxidative stress data. After the Expert Panels
met, the reports for the four individual areas were developed
by designated scientists; the content of these reports was
finalized through additional phone conferences and email
communications as necessary with the other panel members.
As indicated previously, due to the large amount of data and
information evaluated by the individual panels and the sub-
sequent length of the individual reports, it was decided to
prepare four separate specialist manuscripts covering the
methodologies applied and their respective outcomes and
conclusions. This report presents a summary of the delibera-
tions, and conclusions reached, by the Expert Panels in the
four areas of research. Prior to publishing the Expert Panels
findings, they were presented at the Society for Risk Analysis
Annual Meeting at Arlington, Virginia on 7 December 2015.
As a preface to the remainder of the document, the pro-
cess by which IARC identifies and reviews data must be com-
pared with that employed by the Expert Panel(s). IARC only
reviews data included in: “reports that have been published
or accepted for publication in the openly available scientific
literature” or “data from governmental reports that are pub-
licly available” (IARC 2006). In addition, IARC reviews and
assesses these data in the context of hazard (i.e. inherent car-
cinogenic potential) not risk (i.e. the likelihood of carcino-
genic effects at exposure levels humans may encounter). As a
result, the conclusion of IARC is often solely associated with
hazard. In contrast to IARC, toxicology, mechanism, and
exposure Expert Panels evaluated all of the available scientific
data, including the results of a number of unpublished
reports, some of which have been submitted to and reviewed
by regulatory authorities. These reports document GLP- and
OECD/FDA Redbook guideline compliant studies, conducted
to assess the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of glypho-
sate. In essence, these studies provide the highest quality of
documentation and verification; hence, a balanced assess-
ment requires the inclusion of such studies in the review pro-
cess. The third panel (epidemiology) took an approach
consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for system-
atic reviews (Moher et al. 2009), standard approaches to crit-
ically evaluating epidemiologic studies (Aschengrau & Seage

 2003a,b; Sanderson et al. 2007) and well-recognized interpret-
ative methods – e.g. the criteria-based methods of causal
inference (Hill 1965, 1971) – sometimes referred to as “weight
of evidence” (WoE) methods (Weed 2005). In addition to the
identification of hazard potential, the Expert Panels assessed
exposure data to provide a perspective from which to com-
ment on potential risk. In the absence of carcinogenic hazard,
however, no risk is present regardless of exposure. The con-
clusions reached by the Expert Panels and IARC clearly differ.
However, in the opinion of the Expert Panel(s) this is not due
to differences in process (hazard versus risk assessment), but
rather the result of the exclusion from the IARC review pro-
cess of key data (animal bioassay and genotoxicity) or differ-
ences in the interpretation of the data that was assessed
particularly in regard to the animal bioassay results. Given
these differences, even without the data IARC did not include,
there is no support for IARC’s conclusion that glyphosate is
“probably carcinogenic to humans.” This critique is presented
and discussed in the context of the Expert Panels’ assessment
of the totality of the data.
Exposures to glyphosate
Unpublished reports of studies on exposure to glyphosate in
applicators were provided by Monsanto Company which cov-
ered uses in agriculture and forestry (see Solomon 2016 for
additional details and bibliography). Other data on exposures
were obtained from the open literature as a result of searches
in PubMedV
R, references in reviews, and Google ScholarV
R.
These papers and reports were grouped into sources of expo-
sures and the data analyzed as described below.
Only one paper reported concentrations of glyphosate in
air. In a study conducted in Iowa, Mississippi, and Indiana in
2007 and 2008, concentrations of glyphosate and its major
environmental
degradate,
aminomethylphosphonic
acid
(AMPA), were measured in air and precipitation (Chang et al.
2011). For estimation of human exposure, it was assumed
that there was 100% absorption of glyphosate from the air
into the body of a 70 kg human breathing 8 m3 air (half a day
for an adult) (US EPA 2009). Also, surface water measure-
ments of glyphosate as part of the National Water-Quality
Assessment (NAWQA) program (USGS 2015) since 2002 were
downloaded from the NAWQA data warehouse and then
sorted by concentration. All values measured across the US
between 2002 and 2014 were pooled for the analysis. Where
concentrations were less than the level of detection (0.02 lg
glyphosate acid equivalents (a.e.)/L), these values were substi-
tuted with a dummy value of “zero.” Although chlorine and
ozone are highly effective in removing glyphosate and AMPA
during purification of drinking water (J€
onsson et al. 2013), it
was assumed that treatment did not remove any glyphosate.
The estimated concentrations are thus a worst-case.
Studies documenting exposures through food and to
“bystanders” (persons who are located within or directly adja-
cent to areas where pesticides are applied but who are
not actively involved in the process) were reviewed and
data extracted (Acquavella et al. 2004; Curwin et al. 2007;
Mesnage et al. 2012; Hoppe 2013; Honeycutt & Rowlands
2014;
Niemann
et
al.
2015).
For
those
measurements,
publications that provided actual systemic dose calculations
were used rather than estimates calculated from default
exposure factors (e.g. body weight (bw), water consumption,
breathing rate, etc.). Where dietary exposures were calculated
the urinary concentration was used to calculate the systemic
dose on the assumption of 2 L of urine per day and a 60 kg
person (Niemann et al. 2015). In 2013, the JMPR reviewed
dietary exposures to glyphosate (glyphosate, N-acetyl glypho-
sate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA) and calculated the inter-
national estimated daily intakes (IEDI) of glyphosate for 13
regional food diets (JMPR 2014). These IEDIs were based on
estimated mean residues from supervised trials under normal
or good agricultural practice. The US EPA has calculated
exposures
to
glyphosate
using
the
Dietary
Exposure
Evaluation Model (DEEM, ver 7.81), based on tolerance levels
for all commodities and modeled estimates of exposures
from food and drinking water for the overall US population
(US EPA 2012). For studies using dosimetry, the normalization
to systemic dose was conducted using the following assump-
tions: 70 kg adult, 2.1 m2 surface area for a 70 kg male (US
EPA 2009), 10% penetration through clothing if not actually
measured, 1% dermal penetration. The estimated systemic
doses were ranked from smallest to largest and a cumulative
frequency distribution derived. These values were plotted on
a log-probability scale. The median (50th centile) and 90th
centile values were calculated from the raw data using the
Excel function < ¼percentile>.
Where an applicator makes a single application, the sys-
temic dose of glyphosate can be estimated from the total
amount of glyphosate excreted in the urine over the 4 or 5
days
following
and
including
the
day
of
application
(Acquavella et al. 2004). If applications are conducted every
day, the amount excreted each day provides a time-weighted
average for daily exposures. Because glyphosate is applied
infrequently in normal agricultural practice, the assumption
of a single initial exposure is considered appropriate for risk
assessment purposes.
Exposures via air
Based on the above assumptions, inhaling glyphosate in air
at the maximum measured concentration would result in an
exposure of 1.04 � 10�6 mg/kg body mass (bm)/day. This is
about five orders of magnitude less than the systemic ADI
proposed by EFSA (2015).
Exposures via water
The concentrations of glyphosate measured in US surface
waters ranged from 0.02 to 73 lg/L. The 90th centile value
was 0.79 lg/L (see Solomon (2016) for details of the calcula-
tions), more than four orders of magnitude less than the
EFSA ADI.
Exposures from food and in bystanders
Estimates of glyphosate exposures to bystanders and the
general public have been reported by various investigators
CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY

 (Curwin et al. 2007; Mesnage et al. 2012; Hoppe 2013;
Honeycutt & Rowlands 2014; Kr€
uger et al. 2014; Markard
2014). In these studies, the range for estimates of systemic
doses was 0.000022–0.00063 mg/kg/day. These values are all
less than the ADI suggested by EFSA.
Exposure of applicators
The 90th centile in the dosimetry studies was 0.021 mg/kg/
day; about five-times less than the systemic EFSA ADI. The
range of values for the systemic doses determined by biomo-
nitoring was smaller than for the passive dosimeters. The
90th centile was 0.0014 mg/kg b.m./day; about 70-times less
than the systemic EFSA ADI.
In summary, there is a robust dataset on glyphosate expo-
sures to humans. Even when using worst-case assumptions,
systemic exposures to applicators, bystanders, and the gen-
eral public are very small. Based on current RfDs and ADIs
and measured exposures, there is an extremely large margin
of safety from exposure to glyphosate via normal uses.
Epidemiological data
The
epidemiology
Expert
Panel
conducted
a
systematic
review of the published glyphosate literature for the two can-
cers that were the focus of IARC’s epidemiology review: non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) (see
Acquavella et al. (2016) for additional details). Initially, an
exhaustive search of the medical literature was performed to
identify all epidemiological studies that examined the rela-
tionships between reported use of glyphosate and NHL or
MM. This resulted in seven unique studies for NHL and four
studies for MM after removal of duplicates and focusing on
the most recent findings for study populations that were the
subject of more than one publication. The relevant studies
are listed in Table 2. Each study was then reviewed individu-
ally according to key validity considerations specified a priori
and the results for NHL and MM were separately and system-
atically evaluated according to widely used criteria for judg-
ing causal associations from epidemiologic studies (Hill 1965).
Data abstracted from each study included: first author,
year of publication, outcome (NHL, MM), study design, study
size, statistical methods, results (measure of relative risk [RR]
with accompanying 95% confidence interval [95% CI]), expos-
ure-response findings, and variables controlled in the analy-
ses. Each study was evaluated for key features that relate to
study validity, most importantly: recall bias, proxy respond-
ents, selection bias, adequate statistical control for confound-
ing factors, and evaluation of dose response (Table 3).
Of
the
seven
NHL
studies,
only
one
study
–
the
Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort study (de Roos et al.
2005) – was devoid of major concerns about recall bias and
selection bias by virtue of the design (prospective versus
retrospective), was controlled comprehensively for confound-
ing factors, and extensively considered RR by frequency and
duration of glyphosate use. This study of more than 50 000
licensed pesticide farmers and applicators collected informa-
tion about pesticide use before follow-up for health out-
comes, had only first-hand respondents reporting about
pesticide use (viz. no proxy respondents), had minimal poten-
tial for selection bias, and included statistical analyses that
controlled confounding factors by myriad personal character-
istics and non-glyphosate occupational exposures. In addition,
de Roos et al. (2005) were the only investigators who con-
ducted exposure-response analyses while controlling exten-
sively
for
confounding
exposures.
In
contrast,
the
NHL
case–control studies had major validity concerns including
the strong potential for recall bias, selection bias (either
appreciably lesser participation for controls than cases or
selecting controls that clearly did not reflect the population
that gave rise to the cases [e.g. hospitals controls from
rheumatology and orthopedic departments]), proxy respond-
ents, and uncontrolled confounding factors in the statistical
analyses. Indeed, in many of the case–control studies virtually
every
pesticide
exposure
studied
was
associated
with
increased risk for NHL (or MM) – a clear indication of wide-
spread systematic bias.
With these considerations in mind, for NHL, the results of
the de Roos et al. (2005) cohort study were considered the
only reliable epidemiologic findings. As de Roos et al. (2005)

 concluded “ … the available data provided evidence of no
association
between
glyphosate
exposure
and
NHL
incidence.” Results from this study were the basis for the
Panel’s conclusion of no epidemiologic support for a causal
relationship between reported glyphosate use and NHL.
The glyphosate literature for MM is appreciably sparser
than the literature for NHL, both in terms of the number of
available studies (one cohort and three case–control studies)
and the number of cases in those studies with reported gly-
phosate use. The three case–control studies had important
validity concerns, as noted for the NHL case–control studies,
and were unable to adjust analyses comprehensively for con-
founding factors due to the very small number of exposed
cases. The AHS cohort study (de Roos et al. 2005 and re-ana-
lyzed by Sorahan 2015) found that glyphosate users had
about the same rate of MM as non-users adjusting for con-
founding factors, but had too few exposed cases to conduct
informative exposure response analyses.
In summary, the epidemiology Expert Panel concluded
that the glyphosate epidemiologic literature does not indicate
a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and NHL.
For MM, the evidence was considered too sparse to judge a
relationship between MM and reported glyphosate use. The
panel’s conclusion for NHL differed from that of the IARC
working group primarily because the null findings from the
AHS (cohort) study were the only epidemiologic findings con-
sidered likely to be valid.
Cancer bioassays
The carcinogenicity Expert Panel reviewed all listed cancer
bioassays reviewed by Greim et al. (2015) and IARC (2015).
The recommended method for evaluating the results of an
extensive database of toxicology and carcinogenicity bioas-
says, as exist for glyphosate, involves the application of a
WoE approach (US EPA 1986c; ECHA 2010). Methods for eval-
uating the results of an extensive database of toxicology and
carcinogenicity
bioassays,
as
exist
for
glyphosate,
have
evolved from the application of WoE approaches (US EPA,
2005; Suter and Cormier, 2011) to approaches built on the
systematic and rigorous methods of systematic evidence-
based reviews (James et al. 2015). These approaches recom-
mend that all reliable information be evaluated. Transparent
descriptions of studies to be included and excluded are a key
component of this approach. In any review, if certain studies
are judged to be unreliable and thus not included, the rea-
sons for this should be provided. The carcinogenicity Expert
Panel reviewed the incidences of the tumors in the various
studies with respect to dose-response, rate of occurrence
relative to known spontaneous rates in control animals, and
on the basis of biological plausibility. Additional details of the
Expert Panel’s considerations and conclusions are presented
in Williams et al. (2016).
In contrast to the results of past reviews (see Table 4),
IARC (2015) concluded that there is sufficient evidence in
experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate,
based on the following:
a.
A significant positive trend in the incidence (p ¼ .037) of
renal tubule carcinomas and of adenomas and carcino-
mas (p ¼ .034) in male CD-1 mice of one study only. This
is a rare tumor type.
b.
In a second feeding study in the same strain of mice, a
significant positive trend in the incidence (p < .001) of
hemangiosarcomas occurred in males.
c.
In two dietary studies in SD rats, a significant positive
trend (p < .05) in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell
adenomas occurred in males.
d.
In a dietary study in SD rats, a significant positive trend
(p ¼ .016) in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas
occurred in males.
e.
In a dietary study in SD rats, a significant positive trend
(p ¼ .031) in the incidence of thyroid C-cell adenomas
occurred in females.
Kidney tubular – cell neoplasia in mice
In regard to the rare renal tubular tumors in male CD-1 mice,
the Expert Panel noted that the conclusions of the IARC were
based on only one 2-year oral mouse carcinogenicity study,
(Monsanto 1983) excluding two additional 18-month oral
studies in CD-1 mice (Arysta Life Sciences 1997; Nufarm 2009)

CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY

 and
one
18-month
oral
study
in
Swiss
Albino
mice
(Feinchemie Schwebda 2001). All of the studies were consid-
ered by authoritative bodies to have met the guidelines for a
carcinogenicity bioassay in mice (US EPA 1990; ICH 1997).
In the study conducted by Monsanto (1983) considered by
IARC (2015) to show evidence of renal tubular neoplasia asso-
ciated with glyphosate dosing, male (M) and female (F) CD-1
mice received 0 (M0/F0 mg/kg/day, control), 1000 (157/190,
LD), 5000 (814/955, MD), or 30,000 (4841/5874, HD) ppm in
the diet. The incidence by dose of renal neoplasms in male
mice
was
as
follows:
1/49,
0/49,
1/50,
and
3/50.
The
important non-neoplastic renal findings of hyperplasia were
as follows: 3/49, 0/49, 4/50, and 2/50, indicating lack of a
dose-response, with the highest incidence in the mid-dose
(MD) group, followed by the control group, and the high-
dose (HD) group. The low-dose (LD) group had no renal find-
ings. Females had neither neoplasia nor hyperplasia. Absence
of hyperplasia indicates that all renal proliferative and neo-
plastic lesions, which occurred in all experimental groups
(including controls) occurred de novo, i.e. were spontaneous
or background lesions and were not compound related.
Factors to assess whether an association between expos-
ure and an effect (two variables) is causal include strength,
consistency, and specificity of the association, the temporal
(latency) and dose-response relationships present, plausibility
of effect, and coherence of the available data. When applied
to the study by Monsanto (1983), several conclusions were
drawn, as follows:
1.
The association was not strong because the incidence of
rare renal neoplasms was not statistically significant in
any exposed group when compared to the control
group.
2.
The association is not consistent, since four out of five
mouse studies did not find similar renal neoplasms at
similar doses.
3.
The association is not specific, since females of this piv-
otal study, which were exposed to higher levels of gly-
phosate, did not develop renal neoplasms. Also, there
were no renal findings (hyperplasia, neoplasia) in the LD
group, whereas the control group had four.
4.
The time required between exposure and effect, i.e. the
latency time, was not reduced; all tumors were observed
only at termination. Also, no mouse with neoplasia had
also hyperplasia.
5.
The biological gradient of association or the dose-
response curve was absent, since the females and the
males in the LD group had no neoplasms, whereas there
was one in the control group.
6.
A plausible explanation for the association was absent,
since the mode of action for induction of these renal
neoplasms was not established.
7.
Coherence of the association was also absent, as female
mice and male and female rats did not display kidney
effects. Also in the other four mouse carcinogenicity
studies (three of which were not considered in the IARC
monograph), the mice did not develop similar neoplastic
renal lesions.
8.
The association does not demonstrate a dose-response
pattern (see #5, 6), and furthermore the “in-study”
females had neither neoplasms nor any of the other
renal lesions, although they were exposed to higher lev-
els of glyphosate.
Consequently, under the conditions of this assessment, the
renal neoplastic effects are not plausibly associated with gly-
phosate exposure. This conclusion is in agreement with that
of JMPR (1987, 2006), US EPA (1993), and EFSA (2015).
Hemangiosarcomas in mice
With respect to the common liver hemangiosarcoma in male
mice, in the CD-1 mouse study reported by Cheminova
(1993) there were no statistically significant increases in the
incidence of any tumors when compared with the in-study
and historical (for both sexes 2–12%) control groups and no
dose response was apparent (Williams et al. 2016). IARC,

G. M. WILLIAMS ET AL.
 based on their own statistical analysis, indicated/reported
that there was an increase in the incidence of hemangiosar-
coma in males [p < .001, Cochran–Armitage trend test] based
on the incidence of the HD group (Table 5). In addition, IARC
(2015) did not comment on the lack of hemangiosarcomas in
females which have received higher doses of glyphosate, and
also of renal tumors in this mouse study.
It is clear that the association between glyphosate treat-
ment and hemangiosarcoma in mice is weak since pairwise
comparisons are not significant, there is no consistency
(some mouse studies show no tumors of this type at all at
comparable doses), and a dose response effect is not seen
(some HD groups have a lower incidence than lower doses).
In addition, the recorded incidences are within the historical
control range.
Given the foregoing analysis, the Expert Panel concludes
that overall the evidence does not support the conclusion
that glyphosate exposure results in increased incidence of
hemangiosarcoma in mice.
Pancreatic tumors in rats
In two of the seven carcinogenicity studies in rats that were
evaluated by IARC, tumors of islet cells of the pancreas were
diagnosed in both males and females. Both studies were
made available to IARC by the US EPA (1991a,b,c).
In the first study Sprague-Dawley rats received doses of 0,
30 (3), 100 (10), and 300 (31 mg/kg bw/day) ppm in the diet
for 26 months. No pancreatic islet carcinomas were observed.
Adenomas were found having a positive trend (p < .05) in the
study. The level of significance for an increase in common
tumors in the trend test should be p < .005. The tumor inci-
dences for controls, low, mid, and high doses respectively
were: males – 0/50, 5/49 (10%), 2/50 (4%), 2/50 (4%), and
females – 2/50 (4%), 1/50 (2%), 1/50 (2%) 0/50. This incidence
demonstrates no dose-response pattern, and an absence of
pre-neoplastic effects. In addition, in the first study in males,
the adenomas did not progress to carcinomas.
In the second study Sprague-Dawley rats received 0, 2000,
8000, and 20,000 ppm glyphosate (96.5% purity) in the diet,
fed ad libitum for 24 months. In males, the following pancre-
atic islet cell tumor incidences were observed in the controls
and three dose groups (low to high): adenoma: 1/58 (2%),
8/57 (14%), 5/60 (8%), 7/59 (12%); carcinoma: 1/58 (2), 0/57,
0/60, 0/59. Corresponding incidence values in females were:
5/60 (8%), 1/60 (2%), 4/60 (7%), 0/59, and 0/60, 0/60, 0/60,
0/59. The historical control rates for pancreatic islet cell
tumors at the testing laboratory were in the range 1.8–8.5%.
The Panel disagrees with the conclusion of IARC that there is
a significant positive trend (p < .05) in the incidence of pan-
creatic adenomas in males, since here again the level of sig-
nificance should be p < .005 (US FDA, 2001; Williams et al.
2014). Moreover, there was no progression of adenomas to
carcinomas.
Four additional studies in rats, described by Greim et al.
(2015) not evaluated by IARC, similarly did not show pancre-
atic islet cell tumors. Based on this information the Expert
Panel concludes that there is no evidence that glyphosate
induces islet cell tumors in the pancreas.
Liver tumors in rats
Hepatocellular neoplasms are common for the SD rat (about
5% in males and 3% in female controls) (Williams et al. 2014).
The IARC evaluation indicated that there was “ … a sig-
nificant (p ¼ .016) positive trend in the incidences of hepa-
tocellular adenoma in males … ” (IARC 2015). This opinion
was based on its interpretation of the Stout and Ruecker
(1990) study as presented by the US EPA’s Peer Review of
Glyphosate (US EPA 1991a,b) (see Table 6). The Stout and
Ruecker (1990) study has been reviewed twice by the US
EPA
(1991a,b).
The
final
interpretation
of
the
US
EPA
Review committee was: “Despite the slight dose-related
increase in hepatocellular adenomas in males, this increase
was not significant in the pair-wise comparison with con-
trols
and
was
within
the
historical
control
range.
Furthermore, there was no progression from adenoma to
carcinoma and incidences of hyperplasia were not com-
pound-related. Therefore, the slight increased occurrence of
hepatocellular adenomas in males is not considered com-
pound-related” (US EPA 1991b). The US EPA ultimately con-
cluded that glyphosate should be classified as a Group E
(evidence
of
non-carcinogenicity
for
humans)
chemical
(US EPA 1991a,b).
There are other aspects of the Stout and Ruecker (1990)
data that support the conclusion that glyphosate did not
exert an oncogenic effect on the liver of SD rats. For
example, chemically induced rat hepatocellular carcinogenesis
is a multiple stage process characterized by progressive

that span from adaptive to irreversible toxic effects – can
help support characterization of key events along the carcino-
genesis process and inform the mode of action of the tested
chemical (Williams & Iatropoulos 2002; Holsapple et al. 2006;
Carmichael et al. 2011). These changes were not apparent
in this study.
In the last 30 years, the systemic carcinogenic potential of
glyphosate has been assessed in at least eight studies in
Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats, which were not all included
within the IARC monograph (Greim et al. 2015); a ninth could
not be evaluated because of a high mortality and the low
doses used (Chruscielska et al. 2000). Considered jointly, the
animals were exposed through the diet to 24 different doses
distributed across a wide range (3.0–1290 mg/kg bw/day). In
exposed males, the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas
across the doses showed no dose-response relationship and
varied within the same range as the controls. Similar rates
were also seen for hepatocellular carcinomas. These observa-
tions confirm that glyphosate is not carcinogenic to the
rat liver.
Thyroid tumors in rats
C-cell tumors of the thyroid are a common tumor in the SD
rat (Williams et al. 2014).
The incidence of thyroid C-cell adenoma was reported in
the Monograph (IARC 2015), to have a significant positive
trend (p ¼ .031) in females. IARC based their opinion, again,
on their interpretation of the Stout and Ruecker’s (1990)
study and the US EPA’s Second Peer Review of Glyphosate
(US EPA 1991a). In the Stout and Ruecker’s study (1990), no
statistically significant difference (group comparison) was
reported in the incidence of thyroid C-cell neoplasms, as
shown in Table 7. Additionally, the US EPA (1991a) concluded
that “the C-cell adenomas in males and females are not con-
sidered compound-related.” Although the C-cell adenomas
were slightly numerically greater in male and female MD and
HD groups, there was no dose-related progression to carcin-
oma and no significant dose-related increase in severity of
grade or incidence of hyperplasia in either sex. However,
IARC concluded that “there was a statistically significant posi-
tive trend in the incidence of thyroid, C-cell adenomas in
females” (p ¼ .031 but, because this is a common tumor type,
the trend significance value should be p < .005 (US FDA 2001;
Williams et al. 2014)). Thus, this tumor is not significant.
Therefore, in one of the two evaluated studies, the signifi-
cant trend in the incidence of thyroid C-cell adenomas in
female rats did not materialize, and there was no progression
to carcinomas. The adenomas were within the historical ranges.
Genetic toxicity and oxidative stress data
The genetic toxicology Expert Panel (Brusick et al. 2016) con-
sidered published studies reviewed in the IARC monograph
and
additional published
studies
identified by
literature
searches or from review articles, not considered by IARC.
These included both genetic toxicology studies and studies
of oxidative stress. A large number of core genetic toxicology
regulatory studies were also considered by the Expert Panel
for which information was available from review publication
supplements. These regulatory studies were not considered
in the IARC monograph, but the Expert Panel concluded that
sufficient test-related information was available to justify
including these studies. In addition, some unpublished regu-
latory studies not reviewed previously were included in the
Expert Panel evaluation.
The universally recommended method for evaluating the
databases of the type associated with glyphosate (including
GBFs and AMPA), involves the application of a WoE approach
as discussed recently for genetic toxicology testing (US FDA
2006; Dearfield et al. 2011). One of the most important
requirements of a WoE approach is that individual test meth-
ods should be assigned a weight that is consistent with their
contribution to the overall evidence, and different types of
evidence or evidence categories must be weighted before
they are combined into a WoE.
The weight of a category of evidence used in the
Expert Panel evaluation is based on four considerations:
(i) different categories of evidence (i.e. assay types) have
different weights, (ii) the aggregate strength (robustness of
protocols and reproducibility) and quality of evidence in
the category also influence the weight (Klimisch et al.
1997), (iii) the number of items of evidence within a cat-
egory influences the weight, and (iv) tests with greater
potential to extrapolate results to humans carry greater
weight. In general, human and in vivo mammalian systems
have the highest test system weight, with a lower weight
applied to in vitro mammalian cell systems and in vivo
non-mammalian systems and lowest weight to in vitro non-
mammalian systems (with the exception of the well-vali-
dated bacterial reverse mutation-[Ames] test using mamma-
lian metabolic activation). Typically, the results of in vivo
assays supersede the results of in vitro assays (EFSA 2011).
In contrast to the standard WoE approach used by the
Expert Panel, IARC’s process for evaluating/weighting the
genotoxicity data for glyphosate, GBF and AMPA was not
defined. IARC’s process may be inferred by how the data
were summarized and described, and indicate a number of
differences from current standard procedures for WoE. For
instance, it appears that IARC considered in vitro studies in
human cells as carrying more weight than rodent in vivo
studies as evidenced by the order of discussion topics in
Section 4.2.1, and the inclusion of a separate table for
human in vitro studies. Further, the IARC conclusion of

 strong evidence of genotoxicity was stated as based on
“studies in humans in vitro and studies in experimental ani-
mals.” In contrast, the Expert Panel evaluation considered
in vitro studies using cells of human origin to be weighted
as equivalent to any other in vitro mammalian cell assay
using the same endpoint. IARC also gave weight to publica-
tions in which glyphosate or GBFs have been tested for
genotoxicity in a variety of nonstandard non-mammalian
species (fish, insects). The Expert Panel did not consider
data from these non-mammalian systems and nonstandard
tests with glyphosate, GBF and AMPA to have weight in the
overall genotoxicity evaluation, especially given the large
number of standard core studies assessing the more rele-
vant gene mutation and chromosomal effects categories
available in mammalian systems. In addition, nonstandard
tests lack internationally accepted guidelines for design and
conduct, databases that document acceptable negative con-
trol data or positive control responses are absent, and valid-
ation with respect to concordance with rodent or human
carcinogenicity has yet to be completed. OECD guidelines
specifically state that use of any nonstandard tests require
justification along with stringent validation including estab-
lishing adequate historical negative and positive control
databases (OECD 2014).
In addition, the IARC review seemed to apply significant
weight to “indicator” tests such as DNA damage (comet
assay) or sister chromatid exchange (SCE) studies. These tests
are identified as indicators because the measured endpoint is
reversible and does not always lead to mutation, a key event
in cancer development. As stated by OECD (2015), when eval-
uating potential genotoxicants, more weight should be given
to the measurement of permanent DNA changes than to
DNA damage events that are reversible. Therefore, the Expert
Panel also considered that the data from these “indicator”
tests with glyphosate, GBFs and AMPA should not have sig-
nificant weight in the overall genotoxicity evaluation, espe-
cially given the large number of standard core studies in the
more relevant gene mutation and chromosomal effects cate-
gories available in mammalian systems.
IARC did not consider the chemical structure of glyphosate
in its mechanistic section. Many guidelines recommend that
the presence of structural alerts be considered in evaluation
of or testing for genotoxicity (Cimino 2006; Eastmond et al.
2009; EFSA 2011; ICH 2011). As reported in Kier and Kirkland
(2013), analysis of the glyphosate structure by DEREK soft-
ware identified no structural alerts for chromosomal damage,
genotoxicity, mutagenicity, or carcinogenicity. The lack of
structural alerts in the glyphosate molecular structure sug-
gests lack of genotoxicity and that genotoxic effects observed
might be secondary to toxicity or resulting from mechanisms
other than DNA reactivity.
Genetic toxicology tests relied upon by most regulatory
bodies to support decisions regarding safety focus on a set
of core endpoints that are known to be involved either in dir-
ect activation of genes responsible for neoplastic initiation in
somatic cells or alteration of the genetic information in germ
cells (EFSA 2011; ICH 2011; Kirkland et al. 2011). Therefore,
the endpoints given the greatest weight in Table 8 consist of
gene mutation and chromosomal aberrations.
An evaluation of the studies in Table 8 according to their
relative contributions to a WoE produced the following
results:
� Test methods identified as providing low contribution
to the WoE (low weight) produced the highest fre-
quency of positive responses, regardless of whether the
responses were
taken
from
the results
of
IARC-eval-
uated studies alone (8 of 9) or from all studies com-
bined (8 of 11).
� The
highest
frequencies
of
positive
responses
were
reported for test endpoints and systems considered most
likely to yield false or misleading positive results due
to their susceptibility to secondary effects. This relationship
was constant regardless of whether the results were taken
from IARC-evaluated studies alone or all studies combined.
� The numbers of studies providing strong evidence of rele-
vant genotoxicity (high weight) were in the minority for
both the IARC and the Expert Panel’s evaluations, with 6
out of 15 studies identified as high weight being positive
for the IARC evaluation, and only 8 out of 92 studies identi-
fied as high weight being positive for all studies combined.
In summary, the WoE from in vitro and in vivo mammalian
tests for genotoxicity indicates that:
� Glyphosate does not induce gene mutations in vitro. There
are no in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation data for
GBFs or AMPA, and no gene mutation data in vivo.
� Glyphosate, GBFs, and AMPA are not clastogenic in vitro.
Glyphosate is also not clastogenic in vivo. Some positive in
vivo chromosomal aberration studies with GBFs are all sub-
ject to concerns regarding their reliability or biological
relevance.
� There is limited evidence that glyphosate induces micronu-
clei (MN) in vitro. Although this could be a reflection of
increased statistical power in the in vitro MN studies, the
absence of clastogenic effects suggests the possibility of
threshold-mediated aneugenic effects. However, there is
strong evidence that glyphosate does not induce MN in
vivo.
� Limited studies and potential technical problems do not
present convincing evidence that GBFs or AMPA induce
MN in vitro. The overwhelming majority of in vivo MN
studies on GBFs gave negative results, but conflicting and
limited data do not allow a conclusion on in vivo induction
of MN by AMPA.
� There is evidence that glyphosate and GBFs can induce
DNA strand breaks in vitro, but these are likely to be sec-
ondary to toxicity since they did not lead to chromosome
breaks. There is limited evidence of transient DNA strand
breakage for glyphosate and GBFs in vivo, but for glypho-
sate at least these are not associated with DNA adducts.
These results are assigned a lower weight than results
from other more relevant endpoints, which were more
abundant.
� There is evidence that glyphosate and AMPA do not
induce unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in cultured
hepatocytes.
CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY
13
 � Reports of the induction of SCE in vitro by glyphosate and
GBFs, and one positive report of SCE induction in vivo by a
GBF, do not contribute to the overall evaluation of geno-
toxic potential since the mechanism of induction and bio-
logical relevance of SCE are unclear.
Although IARC policies prohibited the inclusion of add-
itional
data
from
unpublished
studies
or
governmental
reports, it was the Expert Panel’s conclusion that the regula-
tory genetic toxicology studies published in reviews such as
Kier and Kirkland (2013) (Table 9) should be included in a
WoE assessment. The rationale supporting the inclusion of
these additional studies is that the supplementary tables pre-
sented
in
the
Kier
and
Kirkland
(2013)
paper,
contain
sufficient detail supporting the reliability of the studies.
Failure to evaluate and consider the large number of results
included in the publication by Kier and Kirkland (2013), as
well as other publicly available studies not reviewed by IARC,
results in an inaccurate assessment of glyphosate, GBFs and
AMPA’s genotoxic hazard/risk potential.
Based on the results of the WoE critique detailed above
and the wealth of regulatory studies reviewed by Kier and
Kirkland (2013) and Williams et al. (2000), the Panel con-
cluded that the available data do not support IARC’s con-
clusion
that
there
is
strong
evidence
for
genotoxicity
across
the
glyphosate
or
GBFs
database.
In
fact,
the
Panel’s WoE assessment provides strong support for a lack
of
genotoxicity,
particularly
in
the

 categories (mutation, chromosomal effects) associated with
carcinogen prediction. As additional support for the Panel’s
WoE conclusion, Table 10 provides a comparison between
a set of characteristics associated with confirmed genotoxic
carcinogens (Bolt et al. 2004; Petkov et al. 2015) and the
genotoxic activity profiles for glyphosate, AMPA, and GBFs.
There is virtually no concordance between the two sets of
characteristics.
Beyond the standard genetic toxicity assays, IARC con-
cluded for humans exposed to GBFs that there was positive
evidence of DNA breakage as determined using the comet
assay (Paz-y-Mi~
no et al. 2007), negative induction of chromo-
somal aberrations (Paz-y-Mi~
no et al. 2011), and positive induc-
tion of MN (Bolognesi et al. 2009). These papers were
critically reviewed by the Expert Panel and were found to be
deficient as evidence for GBF genetic effects for many rea-
sons (e.g. identification of cells scored for comets, inconsist-
ent observations, uncertainties with respect to “negative
controls,” lack of statistical significance, and lack of effect
relative to self-reported exposure). In addition to questions
about the significance of the comet endpoint there is also a
lack of scientific consensus regarding the relevance of MN
found in exposed humans (Speit 2013; Kirsch-Volders et al.
2014). Importantly, for the Bolognesi study, increases in MN
were not significantly correlated with self-reported GBF spray
exposure and were not consistent with application rates. The
Expert Panel concluded that there was little or no reliable evi-
dence produced in these studies that would support a con-
clusion that GBFs, at levels experienced across a broad range
of end-user exposures, poses any human genotoxic hazard/
risk.
With respect to oxidative stress and genotoxic potential of
glyphosate and its formulations, it is noted that many more
oxidative stress studies are available for GBFs than for gly-
phosate or AMPA. A higher proportion of the GBF studies
show evidence of oxidative stress. This might be consistent
with induction of oxidative stress by GBF components such
as surfactants. IARC’s statement that there is strong evidence
supporting oxidative stress from AMPA seems to result from
glyphosate and particularly GBF results rather than AMPA
results. In fact, oxidative stress studies of AMPA are very lim-
ited. The paucity of cited data does not seem to justify a con-
clusion of strong evidence for oxidative stress induction by
AMPA.
One mechanism connecting oxidative stress to induction
of carcinogenicity is oxidative damage to DNA and the gener-
ation of mutagenic lesions. Most of the endpoints used in
oxidative stress studies cited by IARC are indirect response
endpoints and the number of studies examining direct oxida-
tive DNA damage are very few and presented mixed results.
Further, research on oxidative stress-induced genotoxicity
suggests that it is often a secondary response to toxicity and
characterized
by
a
threshold
(Pratt
&
Barron
2003).
Comparison of GBF oxidative stress study results with pre-
dicted human exposure levels of less than 0.064 mg/kg bw/
day, suggests that it is improbable that GBFs would induce
levels of oxidative stress likely to exceed endogenous detoxi-
cation capacities.
The most appropriate conclusion supported by the oxida-
tive stress data is, based on a WoE approach, that there is no
strong evidence that glyphosate, GBFs, or AMPA produce oxi-
dative damage to DNA that would lead to induction of end-
points
predictive
of
a
genotoxic
hazard
or
act
as
a
mechanism for the induction of cancer in experimental ani-
mals or humans.
A thorough WoE review of genotoxicity data does not
indicate that glyphosate, GBFs, or AMPA possess the proper-
ties
of
genotoxic
hazards
or
genotoxic
mechanisms
of
carcinogenesis.
Discussion and conclusions
Four Expert Panels conducted detailed reviews of glyphosate
exposure, animal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and epidemio-
logic studies. With respect to exposure, even when using a
number of worst-case assumptions, systemic doses of glypho-
sate in human applicators, bystanders, and the general public
are very small. Exposures of the general public are three or
more orders of magnitude less than the US EPA’s RfD
(1.75 mg/kg/day) as well the ADIs established by JMPR (1 mg/
kg/day) and EFSA (0.5 mg/kg/day). The RfD is the allowable
limit of daily exposure derived from toxicity studies, and even
in the most exposed applicators (90th centile) the systemic
dose was estimated at 20-fold less that the RfD. Exposures to
the public are in the range of 0.00001–0.001 mg/kg bw/day
while occupational exposures can range up to 0.01 mg/kg

 bw/day. Systemic exposures are even lower than the reported
ranges since oral and dermal absorption of glyphosate is low.
With respect to the animal cancer bioassay data, the
Expert Panel conducted a thorough overall WoE evaluation
that considered a much wider range of studies than IARC, all
of which met Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines and
were submitted to support glyphosate Annex I renewal in the
European Union. These studies provided evidence that neo-
plasms naturally occurring in rodents are widely represented
in non-exposed animals, as well as those exposed to doses
well below those that might be expected in regulatory stud-
ies. The pattern of occurrence of these tumors was found to
be inconsistent across and within species and no “novel” neo-
plasms appeared; progression of non-neoplastic to neoplastic
lesions also was not seen. Further, the comparatively large
number of studies performed would be expected to generate
several numerical imbalances by chance. In fact, Haseman
(1983) has estimated that the overall false positive rate for
animal bioassays that tested both sexes in two species,
because of multiple comparisons, corresponds to 7–8% sig-
nificance level for the study as a whole; the US Food and
Drug Administration has estimated that the overall rate can
approach 10%.
After review of all available glyphosate rodent carcinogen-
icity data, the Panel concludes:
� The mouse renal neoplastic effects are not associated with
glyphosate exposure, because they lack statistical signifi-
cance, consistency, specificity, a dose-response pattern,
plausibility, and coherence;
� The association of hemangiosarcomas in the livers of mice
is weak, lacks consistency, and there was no dose-response
effect;
� The association of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in male
SD rats is weak, not seen in the majority of rat studies,
lacks a dose-response pattern (the highest incidence is in
the low dose followed by the high dose), plausibility and
pre-neoplastic/malignant effects;
� In one study, the significant positive trend in the incidence
of hepatocellular adenomas in male rats did not material-
ize, no progression to malignancy was evident and no gly-
phosate-associated pre-neoplastic lesions were present;
� In one study, the significant positive trend in the incidence
of
thyroid
C-cell
adenomas
in
female
rats
did
not
materialize, the adenomas were only slightly increased in
mid- and high doses, and there was no progression to
malignancy.
Overall, extensive reviews of the genotoxicity of glypho-
sate, AMPA, and GBFs that were available prior to the devel-
opment of the IARC Glyphosate Monograph all support a
conclusion that glyphosate (and related materials) is inher-
ently not genotoxic. Further, evidence indicative of an oxida-
tive
stress
mechanism
of
carcinogenicity
is
largely
unconvincing. The Expert Panel concluded that there is no
new, valid evidence presented in the IARC Monograph that
would provide a basis for altering these conclusions.
Lastly, the Expert Panel’s review of the glyphosate epide-
miologic literature and the application of commonly applied
causal criteria did not indicate a relationship with glyphosate
exposure and NHL. In addition, the Panel considered the evi-
dence for MM to be inadequate to judge a relationship with
glyphosate. The extremely large margin of safety found in
exposure monitoring studies is considered to be supportive
of these conclusions.
In summary, the totality of the evidence, especially in light
of the extensive testing that glyphosate has received, as
judged by the Expert Panels, does not support the conclusion
that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” and, con-
sistent with previous regulatory assessments, the Expert
Panels conclude that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcino-
genic risk to humans.
