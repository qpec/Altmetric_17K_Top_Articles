 Tobacco Industry Research on Nicotine
Replacement Therapy: “If Anyone Is Going to Take
Away Our Business It Should Be Us”
Nicotine
replacement
therapy
(NRT) is recommended for to-
bacco cessation on the basis of
pharmaceutical industry research
showing its effectiveness when
combined with counseling. The
tobacco industry opposed NRT
when it first appeared in the
1980s but by 2016 was market-
ing its own NRT products.
We used internal tobacco in-
dustry documents dated 1960
through 2010 to identify the
industry’s perceptions of NRT. As
early as the 1950s, tobacco com-
panies
developed
nonsmoked
nicotine replacements for ciga-
rettes, but they stopped out of
concern
that
marketing
such
products would trigger Food and
Drug Administration regulation
of cigarettes. In the 1990s, after
pharmaceutical companies began
selling prescription NRT, tobacco
companies
found
that
many
smokersusedNRTtosupplement
smoking rather than to quit. In
2009, once the Food and Drug
Administration began regulating
tobacco,
tobacco
companies
restarted their plans to capture
the nicotine market.
Although the tobacco industry
initially viewed NRT as a threat, it
found that smokers often com-
bined NRT with smoking rather
thanusingitasareplacementand
began marketing their own NRT
products. (Am J Public Health.

P
rescription nicotine re-
placement therapy (NRT)
gum was approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for cessation in 1984.
The tobacco industry perceived it
as a threat and successfully pres-
sured the first drug company to
sell NRT to change marketing
that recommended cessation.1 In
1996, pharmaceutical companies
successfully advocated to make
NRT an over-the-counter
(OTC) drug, arguing that ciga-
rettes were available without
prescription and cessation aids
should be as well.2,3 Although
tobacco companies initially op-
posed NRT, by the 21st century
they had begun marketing their
own NRT products.4–6 We
sought to understand why to-
bacco companies shifted from
viewing NRT as a threat in the
1980s to a business opportunity in
the 21st century.
The 2013 clinical practice
guideline on smoking cessation
recommends NRT for to-
bacco cessation on the basis of
placebo-controlled randomized
clinical trials7 of smokers moti-
vated to quit who tapered
NRT over time and received
counseling.8–10 Additional ran-
domized clinical trials and
a Cochrane meta-analysis re-
ported that NRT was effective
in simulated OTC settings, even
with less intensive behavioral
support.11–16 By contrast, pop-
ulation studies have found that
NRT does not increase, and may
depress, cessation, likely because
it is not used in monitored
populations, as clinical trials
are.8–10,17,18
Internal industry documents
reveal that the tobacco industry
changed its approach to NRT
because of internal research
showing that NRT was often
used to supplement smoking
rather than for cessation, or
NRT replaced quitting smoking
outright—and in response to
2009 changes in federal law that
allowed tobacco companies to
sell NRT without triggering
FDA regulation of cigarettes.
In these documents, tobacco
companies stated that their new
products could successfully
compete with pharmaceutical
NRT and indicated that their
goal was to gain market control
of all products containing
nicotine.
METHODS
Between August and De-
cember 2015 we searched the
Truth Tobacco Industry Docu-
ments Library using established
methods.19–24 (The online
supplemental file [available as
a supplement to the online ver-
sion of this article at http://www.
ajph.org] contains details about
the library and our search strat-
egy.) When our research revealed
that smokers were not necessarily
using NRT for cessation, we
reviewed contemporaneous
medical literature addressing
the role of NRT in smoking
cessation to contextualize these
findings.25 We used a snowball
strategy,22 beginning with the
keywords “nicotine patch,”
“NRT,” and “nicotine gum,”
and then we refined search
terms and dates using named
individuals, organizations, and
products and adjacent (by Bates
numbers) documents. We
searched PubMed for medical
literature using comparable
search terms and compared
studies that used surveillance
data to those that used clinical
trials to assess the use of NRT
at the population level.
We considered the effects
of NRT use under real-world
conditions as well as under the
idealized conditions of clinical
trials, which recruit smokers

approximately 100 tobacco in-
dustry documents dated between

RESULTS
As indicated in the timeline in
the box on this page tobacco
companies considered marketing
nicotine replacement products
between the 1950s and 1980s as
extensions of their cigarette prod-
uct lines, but they did not do so
for fear of triggering FDA regula-
tion of cigarettes. In the 1990s,
industry-internal research found
that many smokers were using
NRT to supplement smoking or
in lieu of quitting outright. After
the FDA began regulating
cigarettes in 2009, tobacco com-
panies launched their own nico-
tine product lines, which they
defined as a single category that
included nicotine gum, patches,
lozenges, and e-cigarettes.26
1950s to 1983
Philip Morris. In 1959, Philip
Morris researchers considered
developing a nicotine gum to be
used concurrently with or as
a substitute for cigarettes.27 In
October 1960, the director of
research Helmut Wakeham
wrote the vice-president of the
research and development de-
partment, saying, “[We wanted
to] provide nicotine to the con-
sumer in the form of a chewing
gum, providing all the satisfaction
of smoking while circumventing
the whole area of health.”27
Philip Morris decided not to
pursue this idea because “such
a product would place us directly
under the Food and Drug
Administration, a rather un-
desirable relationship.”27 Philip
Morris sought to avoid FDA
regulation until 2000, when it
decided it was politically expe-
dient to embrace FDA regulation
to mitigate uncertainty and allow
the marketing of new “safer”
tobacco products.28–30
RJ Reynolds. In 1969, Claude
Teague, assistant chief of the RJ
Reynolds (RJR) research and
development department, wrote
a strategy document suggesting
that although “nicotine is con-
sidered to be a sine qua non in
smoking satisfaction,” there was
no “safe” cigarette that would
address the health risks of smok-
ing. RJR’s “new strategy . . .
should be . . . to devise and market
profitable new products—away
from conventional cigarettes—
that will provide those same
gratifications.”31 Alternatives in-
cluded a hypothetical “no to-
bacco” cigarette using “nicotine-
flavor-water” (comparable to the
nicotine solution that was later
used in e-cigarettes26,30) and
nicotine gum, beverages, inhalers,
and “edible products.”31
RJR addressed Teague’s
proposal in 1970 by producing
a Cigarette “Substitute” Concept
Study that observed, “Smoking
and health propaganda . . . forces
[that] have influenced many
smokers to quit . . . may have
reduced the number of new
smokers entering the market.”32
RJR hoped a “a cigarette
‘substitute’ . . . would provide
some of the same satisfactions as
cigarettes” but be hopefully less
vulnerable to heavy taxation or
health criticism. “The problem,”
the report continued, was “just
what product [to develop].”32
Smokers RJR surveyed in the
1970s preferred “gum (43%),
beverage (39%), candy (33%),
and artificial cigarette (23%).”32
The report observed, however,
that these smokers felt nicotine
was harmful to health and
wondered “whether nicotine
should be promoted as an in-
gredient in a substitute cigarette
without also mounting a strong
support campaign in nicotine’s
favor and defense,” considering
that nicotine is addictive and its

 inclusion was critical to main-
taining a tobacco habit.32 The
report said that using this hypo-
thetical product, targeted at
“former smokers and those
who were inclined to, but didn’t
start smoking (probably because
of the health controversy),”32
RJR could capture more of
a shrinking nicotine market.
In 1970, despite the expected
marketing potential of such
substitutes, RJR abandoned
this research, except work on
artificial cigarettes, in part be-
cause it believed:
the Food and Drug
Administration might frown on
the use of nicotine in those items
classified as food products such as
gum, beverage, and candy which
received the highest attitude
ratings in the concept study.33
Brown & Williamson. Brown
& Williamson, then British
American Tobacco’s (BAT) US
subsidiary, started developing
nicotine gum in the 1970s. A
1978 letter from the BAT mar-
keting department to BAT’s re-
search and development center
stated, “Several years ago we
did some work on tobacco based
chewing gum . . . which was
terminated for obvious rea-
sons.”34 Like other tobacco
companies, Brown & Williamson
wanted to avoid FDA
regulation.28
1984–1991
The FDA approved Nicorette
gum, the first pharmaceutical
NRT, for use by prescription as
a tobacco cessation aid in 1984,35
with nicotine patches following
in 1991.35,36 In July 1984, a US
Tobacco Company consumer
marketing representative wrote
the manager of sales communi-
cation, noting “similarities be-
tween the effects and sensations
of the gum[s] with smokeless
tobacco” in an article on Nic-
orette in Consumer Reports. This
observation reflected the un-
derstanding inside the tobacco
industry that NRT was not
a cessation aid, as consumers
perceived it to be, but a different
kind of tobacco product.37
Tobacco companies aban-
doned the idea of producing
nicotine replacement products
when internal industry research
conducted in the 1970s found
that consumers believed nicotine
was dangerous.32,33 As a result, in
the 1980s Philip Morris focused
on reduced nicotine products.
Project ART, for example,
sought to develop low-nicotine
tobacco products, and Project
Extra aimed to create increased
tar products.38 However, focus
groups testing these products,
convened by the Leo Burnett
Advertising Agency in 1987,
revealed that smokers no longer
viewed nicotine in cigarettes as
a health risk; the spread of NRT
had changed public opinion
about nicotine.39 Burnett re-
ported, “The fact that nicotine
gum was prescribed by their
doctors and endorsed by their
pharmacy led some people to
conclude that nicotine must not
be all that bad for them.”40
Burnett’s summary continued:
Groups were not overly
concerned about being
“addicted” to nicotine. It
appeared that they believed that
“addiction” was the price they
paid for enjoying smoking. In
fact, because they did not
understand nicotine’s effects,
or—at most—believed that
nicotine passed through their
bodies quickly, they had fewer
concerns about it.40
Philip Morris research on
potential reduced nicotine
products found:
Nicotine was perceived to be
the substance which was key to
overall smoking satisfaction.
Importantly it was what many
smokers soughtfrom cigarettes . . .
Health implications of nicotine
were acknowledged, but its
effects were thought to be
short-term, and sometimes
pleasant and desirable.41
In 1988, the US surgeon
general report Nicotine Addiction
concluded that nicotine was the
addictive constituent of cigarettes
that kept people smoking.42 By
the late 1980s, Philip Morris
had returned to studying alter-
native tobacco products mar-
keted by other companies.
A 1988 memo noted:
The average nicotine
concentration for [Chewbacco,
a recreational nicotine gum
containing tobacco sold by an
independent company] was 0.45
mg/piece before chewing. . . .
The amount of tobacco material
in the gum was estimated to be
less than 1% by weight. . . .
Subjectively, the gum was
reported by five volunteers to
leave a “hot or peppery” taste in
the mouth.43
In 1991, Philip Morris ter-
minated its development efforts
on reduced nicotine products.44
Internal reports leading to this
decision concluded:
On the surface, the development
of a nicotine-free cigarette would
seem to be the most dramatic
technological advance[ment]
since the filter, and with it
potential for a major new entry in
an otherwise stagnant industry.
Smoker awareness of the reported
risks associated with smoking has
never been higher . . . [however]
consumers [sic] awareness of the
perceived negatives of nicotine as
distinct from tar is not as high as
is thought.45
1992–2008
British American Tobacco. In
1992, BAT considered purchas-
ing a manufacturer of nicotine
patches, Stowic, and to assess the
potential market for the patches
they compared nicotine delivery
rates between cigarettes and
patches.28 BAT’s research and
development department com-
pared the Stowic patch to other
patches for Imasco, a BAT sub-
sidiary that owned a Canadian
drugstore chain. A 1992 memo-
randum to the director of
Imasco discussed the benefits
of a strategy that included en-
tering the alternative nicotine
product market:
Studies of the efficacy of nicotine
gum or transdermal patches on
smoking cessation invariably
show a significant benefit in the
short term, but only a small
advantage (if any) over placebo in
the long term (6+ months). . . .
One could make an argument
for the industry supporting
development of alternative
nicotine delivery systems by
considering them in the same
philosophical light as brand
extensions, or in this case,
a business extension. The
rationale is that if anyone is going
to take away our business it should
be us.46
BAT continued its research on
the Stowic patch, which included
a 1992 discussion on nicotine
patches’ market potential:
The fact that people use snuff and
chewing tobacco indicates that
administration routes other than
the inhalation route can deliver
tobacco satisfaction. . . . There is
currently a void in the market for
a product that provides tobacco
satisfaction in a form that is
acceptable and available to many
segments of the market. The
tobacco industry currently does
not have such a product. A critical
turning point for the nicotine
patch will be whether the current
product fulfills the regulatory
requirements to become available
over the counter.47
The company decided against
entering the nicotine patch
market because the legal de-
partment said, “If we did any-
thing which suggested we were

 simply in the nicotine delivery
business, we would run a seri-

jurisdiction.”48
Philip Morris. From at least
1987 to 2003 Philip Morris sur-
veyed population samples of
smokers monthly through its
Smoker Tracking Surveys. Their
interests included smokers’ brand
preferences and quit attempts.
The April 1992 survey included
an effort to “gauge the initial
impact of the Nicotine Patch on
smoker quitting.”49 It showed
that using nicotine patches had
no effect on real-world quit rates:
301 past two year quitters (out of a
sample of 551 quitters identified
in January–February) were
reinterviewed . . . to determine
their usage of and reactions to the
Nicotine Patch. . . . Roper [the
polling organization Philip
Morris hired to track smoking
trends] data through December
indicate that quitting rates on a 12
[month] basis have been roughly
flat.49
Philip Morris continued to
monitor nicotine patch use and
quit attempts throughout 1992.
The June survey found:
Monthly and 12 [month] quitting
rates have been roughly flat
through April. The use of
Nicotine Patch as a way to stop
smoking jumped dramatically in
April (8% - 26%). . . . The results
seem to suggest that Nicotine
Patch [use for quit attempts]
evidenced growth at the expense
of ‘stopped all at once’ quitting.50
The monthly tracking surveys
did not report on whether quit
attempts using different methods
were more or less successful.
In August 1992, Doron
Stern, a researcher who had been
reporting the results from surveys
of smokers regarding their nico-
tine patch use, wrote Altria
(which owned Philip Morris)
president and chief operating of-
ficer David Beran, summarizing
pharmaceutical industry clinical
trials and Philip Morris surveys
and focus groups:
Clinical results indicate the
nicotine patch was more effect-
ive against placebos. . . . It is
important to keep in mind,
however, that in objectively
validated tests (1 full year after
quitting) nicotine patch scores
werelessimpressivevsplacebos....
Some sort of behavior
modification was administered
during the clinical tests. Without
some degree of psychological
therapy, many experts warn that
the nicotine patch is powerless [as
a method of smoking cessation].51
He noted, “The explosive
growth of nicotine patch sales has
not seemed to increase rate[s] of
quitting (currently holding at
6.7% for 12 [month period]
ending June [1992]).”51
Findings from focus groups
conducted for Philip Morris in
1992, summarized in a Power-
Point presentation, reviewed
how smokers obtained and used
NRT: nicotine patches were not
prescribed in combination with
behavioral therapy as advised to
maximize effectiveness, nor were
they offered with the same care as
other prescription drugs. The
presentation listed how entering
the alternative nicotine market
could benefit Philip Morris:
d The process of acquisition [of
the nicotine patch] is easy.
Apparently, any type of doctor
will write a prescription without
anexaminationnorwillbeexpect
[sic] any interim appointments.
d While doctors seem to readily
encourage patch usage, few get
any more involved—offering
advice, discussing side effects,
suggesting behavior
modification.52
The presentation noted that
nicotine patches were being used
as adjuncts to smoking, which
had implications for Philip
Morris in terms of an alternative
product line that would com-
plement cigarette sales:
d There appears to be an extremely
casual approach to the medical
requirements surrounding
patch usage typical of an OTC
mentality [eventhoughthepatch
is only available by prescription].
Users . . .
d Physically cut the patch to
reduce dosage
d Changenumberofhoursto wear
d Share patches with friends/family
d Removal [sic] of the patch for
occasional smoking.52
Stern reported further on
these findings in another memo
to Beran in October 1992: “Al-
most all the men we spoke to
[who used NRT patches] went
back to smoking.”53 He pro-
posed that interest in trying the
patch might begin to decline,
noting, “Some believe that the
novelty [of the nicotine patch]
has started to wear off.”53 He
continued to update Beran,
stating in December 1992 that
Philip Morris smoker surveys
reported that use of NRT had
declined as anticipated:
Based on the attached results from
our Continuous Tracking Study
[Roper polls of smokers], it
appears that usage of the nicotine
patch has dropped steadily since it
peaked in June. . . . [A] possible
explanation for the patch’s loss in
popularity may relate to the
difficulty quitter’s [sic] experience
in adhering to the strict, but
necessary, regimen prescribed for
the patch treatment.54
Philip Morris continued to
study alternative nicotine prod-
ucts as a strategy for smokers to
deal with increased workplace
smoking restrictions. A 1992
presentation titled “Nicotine
Patch Overview” in the Philip
Morris documents stated that
Philip Morris could use alternate
market approaches for nicotine
patches, which included:
target[ing] smokers with alternate
to smoking message rather than
cessation strategy. . . . [Because of
that] approximately half of all
smokers [are] subject to some
restrictions in the workplace and
one of ten face complete bans.55
The proposal suggested that
nicotine gum could be a bridge
between cigarettes. It stated that
this change in strategy would be
profitable, and because of that,
“Profit margins [for the nicotine
patch were] estimated at 15%
after taxes—roughly in line with
cigarette industry.”55 It observed
that marketing NRT as a cessa-
tion aid for smokers was chal-
lenging. Taking nicotine gum as
an example:
Nicotine gum achieved
comparable results [to the
nicotine patch] vis a vis placebos
[in clinical trials]. Yet, treatment is
often demanding.
d Up to 30 sticks/day
d Very gradual dose reduction
d Required to keep product
between cheek and gum.55
The presentation reported
that new NRT products de-
livered nicotine more effectively
than the patch and similarly to
cigarettes:
New products: Several other
smoking cessation devices are
being explored for market
consideration including nasal
sprays and vapor inhalers. Both
systems do a better job than the
nicotine patch in achieving
absorption rates comparable to
cigarettes.55
Philip Morris continued to
monitor NRT sales and use. In
1994 Philip Morris included
producers of nicotine gum and

 nicotine patches in its regular
“competitor review” reports
developed by its business plan-
ning department in the same
category as cigar sales, despite the
fact that NRT was still available
only by prescription and was not
technically a tobacco product.56
An example noted details such as
distributor agreements, attempts
to obtain FDA approval for new
products, and the history of and
research on nicotine nasal spray,
indicating that the industry
viewed these products, from
a business perspective, as com-
parable to their cigarette
brands.56
2009–2016
In 2009, the FDA began
regulating nontherapeutic to-
bacco products under the Family
Smoking Prevention and To-
bacco Control Act. This new law
meant tobacco companies could
focus on developing and mar-
keting alternative tobacco and
nicotine delivery products
without triggering FDA author-
ity to regulate cigarettes. In 2008
RJR acquired Niconovum, the
Swedish producer of Zonnic
nicotine gum, as an avenue into
the NRT market. RJR began
test marketing it in Des Moines,
Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska.4
The goals of this product ex-
pansion were described in an
internal planning document de-
scribing RJR’s product devel-
opment project Craving Relief:
Objectives:
d Develop a new nicotine
replacement gum for cessation
to state of market launch
readiness
d Use learning from NRT
development to develop
a superior Craving Relief
[nicotine delivery] product to
branded readiness for FDA
evaluation
d Use learning from CR [Craving
Relief] product development to
establish development project
for enhanced next-generation
CR product.57
RJR compared the use of
NRT to its “traditional moist,
snus, and dissolvables”57 smoke-
less tobacco product lines:
Preliminary data indicate that
about 15% of smokers use NRT
off label for situational coping—
not for cessation. . . . It is plausible
that current NRT manufacturers
have already conducted the
necessary research to gain
approval for the reclassification of
the gum and lozenge products for
unlimited extended use. . . . The
primary goal is to develop
a superior Craving Relief product
to successfully compete in what is
expected to be a large and
growing CR category.57
RJR planned to develop
apreliminarybusinesscasefornew
CravingReliefproductsofitsown
that addressed product options,
market volume, profit estimates,
and brand development.57
In 2012, Altria (Philip Morris)
developed the nicotine lozenge
Verve with the expectation that it
would not be subject to the same
restrictions as traditional tobacco
products. Philip Morris believed
it could market Verve without
FDA-mandated warning labels
because it contained nicotine
extracted from tobacco, rather
than whole tobacco, which it
argued was not a cancer risk.58 As
of 2016, Verve products were
marketed only in Virginia.5,6
DISCUSSION
Major tobacco companies in
the United States and the United
Kingdom viewed NRT, even
when it was only available by
prescription, as a recreational
product that could maintain and
possibly expand the use of
nicotine as smoking became less
socially acceptable. Although
NRT was approved for cessation,
tobacco industry research found
in the early 1990s that many
smokers used it in combination
with cigarettes and that smokers
who used NRT for cessation
would otherwise have quit out-
right.49–51,53,54
In the 21st century, medical
research began to find similar
results. The majority of smokers
who receive prescription NRT
receive counseling on how to use
the medication.59 Initial clinical
trials suggesting comparable ef-
fectiveness for OTC NRT relied
on simulated OTC use rather
than real-world OTC use.11–16
Follow-up population studies of
OTC NRT showed it did not
improve—and could impede—
cessation, without an organized
cessation program.8,9,17,18 Out-
side of monitored settings, NRT
is often used for shorter periods
than recommended and not
combined with behavioral
counseling.10 These findings are
consistent even among in-
dividuals motivated to quit:
a follow-up study of participants
enrolled in a clinical trial of nic-
otine patch users found that after
8 years, there was no statistically
significant difference in absti-
nence for patch users than non-
users.60 Moreover, smokers who
used over-the-counter NRT
were significantly less likely to
quit than were smokers who did
not use any cessation aids.8,9
Tobacco companies expressed
interest in developing and mar-
keting alternative products con-
taining nicotine as early as the
1950s, but they were concerned
about marketing them because
doing so could lead to FDA
regulation. In 2009, following
new FDA regulation of ciga-
rettes, tobacco companies began
selling the alternative nicotine
products they had first proposed
decades earlier.61 In 2014, RJ
Reynolds Tobacco began selling
its nicotine gum, Zonnic,
throughout the United States.
Internally, RJR classified Zonnic
with its e-cigarette brand Vuse,
considering both products to be
part of its “quest toward be-
coming a ‘total tobacco com-
pany.’”4 Reflecting this
ambition, marketing in 2015 for
Zonnic suggested that smokers
could use it with cigarettes:
“Quitting doesn’t have to feel
like all or nothing.”61 This
marketing is consistent with to-
bacco industry research that
found many smokers used NRT
in combination with cigarettes
instead of as a means to quit
smoking. Philip Morris began
marketing nicotine lozenges in
2016.5,6
Limitations
The tobacco industry docu-
ments provide incomplete in-
formation about corporate
activity.
In particular, our efforts to
study recent tobacco industry
development of NRT products
was challenging because some
potentially relevant documents
were marked as privileged legal
communication. Cigarette
companies use attorney–client
privilege as a strategy to avoid
making internal documents
public.62,63
Conclusions
Although NRT is marketed as
a cessation aid, the tobacco in-
dustry has been aware since the
1990s that it is unlikely to in-
crease quitting. Although phar-
maceutical industry studies of
NRT use in clinical trials showed
it increased quit attempts, these
results appear to have been driven
in part by the monitoring in-
herent to trials themselves; mul-
tiple studies show that adherence

 rates are higher in clinical trials
than in real-world practice.64–71
Medical research in the 21st
century on population use of
NRT has found results similar to
those identified by the tobacco
industry: NRT can expand nic-
otine use while maintaining
smoking rates.
Tobacco industry research
from the 1970s forward treated
all products containing
nicotine—including cigarettes,
e-cigarettes and their precursors,
and others (e.g., gums, patches,
and candy)—as part of a single
market: the nicotine delivery,
or Craving Relief market. In-
dustry marketing anticipates
that noncigarette nicotine de-
livery products will be used by
smokers for whom smoking is
unacceptable, thus facilitating
and normalizing lifelong nico-
tine addiction. These findings
suggest that the least harmful
way to sell nicotine delivery
products is to restrict them to
smokers whose quit attempts
are medically supervised,
consistent with the original
studies of NRT for smoking
cessation.7
