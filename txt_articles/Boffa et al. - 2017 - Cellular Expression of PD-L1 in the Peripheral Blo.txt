Abstract
Background: Lung cancer treatment has become increasingly
dependent upon invasive biopsies to profile tumors for personal-
ized therapy. Recently, tumor expression of programmed death-
ligand 1 (PD-L1) has gained interest as a potential predictor of
response to immunotherapy. Circulating biomarkers present an
opportunity for tumor profiling without the risks of invasive
procedures. We characterized PD-L1 expression within populations
of nucleated cells in the peripheral blood of lung cancer patients
in hopes of expanding the role of liquid biopsy in this setting.
Methods: Peripheral blood samples from a multi-institu-
tional prospective study of patients with clinical diagnosis of
lung cancer were subjected to cytomorphometric and immu-
nohistochemical evaluation using single-cell, automated slide-
based, digital pathology. PD-L1 expression was determined by
immunofluorescence.
Results: PD-L1 expression was detected within peripheral
circulating cells associated with malignancy (CCAM) in 26 of
112 (23%) non–small cell lung cancer patients. Two distinct
populations of nucleated, nonhematolymphoid, PD-L1–expres-
sing cells were identified; cytokeratin positive (CKþ, PD-L1þ,
CD45�) and cytokeratin negative (CK�, PD-L1þ, CD45�) cells,
both with cytomorphometric features (size, nuclear-to-cytoplasm
ratio) consistent with tumor cells. Patients with >1.1 PD-L1(þ)
cell/mL (n ¼ 14/112) experienced worse overall survival than
patients with �1.1 PD-L1(þ) cell/mL (2-year OS: 31.2% vs.
78.8%, P ¼ 0.00159). In a Cox model adjusting for stage, high
PD-L1(þ) cell burden remained a significant predictor of mor-
tality (HR ¼ 3.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.64–9.09; P ¼
0.002).
Conclusions: PD-L1 expression is detectable in two distinct cell
populations in the peripheral blood of lung cancer patients and is
associated with worse survival.
Impact: These findings could represent a step forward in
the development of minimally invasive liquid biopsies for
the profiling of tumors. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(7);

Introduction
Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor
cells allows them to evade immune effector mechanisms. Mod-
ulation of the PD-1 axis has rapidly emerged as a promising
therapeutic approach in heavily pretreated cancer patients across
multiple tumor types (1–4). Recently, anti-PD-1 axis agents
pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab have gained
approval as single agents in recurrent lung cancer (5–9). Thus
far, these agents appear to have superior toxicity profiles, sus-
tained progression-free responses, and improved overall survival
compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, not all patients respond to anti-PD-1 axis ther-
apeutics. Therefore, paralleling PD-1 axis clinical development is
the need for biomarkers to predict response and toxicity. For
example, in recent clinical trials of the checkpoint inhibitors
nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the mortality risk for patients
treated with either agent was lower among patients in whom PD-
L1 expression was identified in biopsy specimens (5–8). As a
result, profiling for PD-L1 in solid tumor tissue biopsies has
become increasingly incorporated into the treatment paradigm
for metastatic lung cancer.
Currently, lung cancer profiling is dependent upon invasive
biopsies to obtain tumor tissue. Not only do invasive procedures
expose patients to risks for complications (e.g., pneumothorax,
bleeding) (10), but the scheduling of biopsies can impose sig-
nificant treatment delays and logistical challenges for patients.
Furthermore, heterogeneity among tumor foci may result in
discordant responses to systemic therapy. Clinicians often repeat
biopsies to optimize their approach to resistant disease. As a
result, there is increasing interest in tumor profiling through

 peripheral blood analysis to avoid the hazards and inconveni-
ence of invasive (potentially multiple) biopsy procedures.
Circulating tumor cells (CTC) have been studied using a diverse
array of platforms with distinct strategies to enrich and evaluate
the populations of interest. Most commonly, CTC assays impose a
positive or negative selection step for enrichment that narrows the
populations of circulating cell species that are able to be studied.
Enrichment-free technologies, such as automated digital micros-
copy and computational pathology, image, and categorize all
nucleated cells and allow a broad array of circulating cell types to
be analyzed. Because immunohistochemistry studies of tumor
biopsies have identified PD-L1 expression within a variety of
tumor and tumor-associated cell types (11), the nonselection-
based digital microscopy approach represents an ideal platform to
study PD-L1 expression among the broad array of cell types in the
peripheral blood.
Materials and Methods
Patient selection
The patients in this study represent a subset of a prospective
multi-institutional study to evaluate a novel, nonenrichment rare
blood cell detection platform (EPIC Sciences) in a lung cancer
population (NCT01830426). The parent study enrolled patients
who were suspected to have clinical stage I–IV primary lung cancer
by imaging, prior to undergoing a procedure for tissue confirma-
tion from three institutions (Yale New Haven Hospital, Billings
Clinic, and University of California, San Diego). Patients with a
prior history of malignancy were excluded. All patients were
consented according to an Institutional Review Board protocol
approved at the three respective institutions and in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
These current analyses represent secondary outcome mea-
sures of the original study. To maximize the potential utility of
PD-L1 as a biomarker, the study was limited to a prognostic
subset. More specifically, the current lung cancer subset was
restricted to only those patients with: (i) confirmed primary
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), because NSCLC repre-
sented the majority population in our dataset (95%) and the
bulk of the clinical experience with anti-PD-L1 therapy has
been with NSCLC patients, (ii) complete staging data, and (iii)
longitudinal follow-up. As an exploratory analysis, six patients
with small-cell carcinoma were evaluated. PD-L1þ CCAMs were
identified in three of the patients.
Two populations were used for controls. First a cohort of
"healthy controls" was evaluated which included volunteers with
no active medical conditions. Recognizing that PD-L1 expression
may be influenced by a multitude of factors unrelated to cancer,
we developed a second control population comprised of
"unhealthy controls." The population of "unhealthy controls"
consisted of patients who were included in the parent trial
(NCT01830426 described above) under the suspicion of having
lung cancer, but were ultimately deemed not to have lung cancer.
More specifically, these patients were enrolled based on an abnor-
mality on thoracic imaging that raised suspicion for primary lung
cancer yet after biopsy or additional observation, the clinical team
determined these patients did not have lung cancer.
Rare cell collection
A "baseline" blood sample was drawn from a peripheral
venipuncture (5 cc waste) prior to the patient undergoing any
invasive procedure for diagnostic, staging,or therapeutic purposes
(to avoid contamination from noncancerous epithelial cells
resulting from tissue trauma). Blood (7.5 mL) from each subject
was collected in Streck tubes and shipped to Epic Sciences within
48 hours and processed immediately on arrival. Erythrocytes were
lysed, and approximately three million nucleated blood cells were
dispensed onto each of 10 to 16 glass microscope slides and
placed at �80�C for long-term storage according to methods
previously described (12, 13). Sample processing and testing was
conducted in laboratories certified under the good laboratory
practices (GLP).
PD-L1 assay development
Anti-PD-L1 rabbit mAb from Cell Signaling Technology (clone
E1L3N, No. 13684) (14–16) was titered on PD-L1– (Colo205,
H23), low (SU-DHL1), medium (H441), and high (H820)
expressing cell line cells that had been spiked into healthy donor
blood and run on the automated digital microscopy platform to
evaluate the analytic performance of the antibody. PD-L1 expres-
sion levels demonstrated excellent antibody sensitivity and spec-
ificity for PD-L1 protein. Little to no cross-reactivity was observed
in negative control cell lines and leukocytes from healthy donors
(Supplementary Fig. S1). PD-L1 antibody was visualized through
secondary staining with Alexa Fluor–labeled secondary antibody.
Optimal antibody and assay concentrations allowing for the
highest signal-to-background detection of the various PD-L1
expression levels were selected for assay qualification and subse-
quent patient staining.
Rare cell PD-L1 immunofluorescent staining and analysis
Rare cell identification and characterization took place as
previously described (13, 17, 18). In brief, prepared slides were
subjected to automated immunofluorescent staining for cytoker-
atin (CK), DAPI (DNA marker), CD45 (blood lineage marker),
and PD-L1. Two slides were stained and evaluated per patient
sample with the PD-L1 assay, and processed in tandem with
aforementioned high and low PD-L1–expressing cell line control
slides.
Automated scanning identified "candidate" cells of interest
among nucleated cell populations based on size/morphology of
cell, nuclear features, CK expression, and PD-L1 expression in the
absence of blood-lineage CD45 expression. Candidate cells were
then reviewed by California-licensed Clinical Laboratory Scien-
tists to confirm immunohistochemical (IHC) staining profile, as
well as to assess the cytomorphometric features of the cell (size,
shape, nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and so on, as they relate to
the features associated with circulating tumor cells). Candidate
cells were given histologic classification of: single cells, clusters
(more than one sharing cytoplasmic boundaries) or apoptotic
cells (nuclear features consistent with apoptosis).
The analytic threshold for single-cell PD-L1 positivity of the
assay was a signal-to-noise ratio set at the 95th percentile of
intensity observed in the Colo205 negative control cell line
cells spiked into whole blood and processed as process controls
for patient sample staining. More than 95% of both high
endogenous expressing (H820, H441) and induced PD-L1–
expressing (SU-DHL1) cell line cells were above this analytic
threshold. Apoptotic cells were not considered PD-L1(þ) due
to yet-to-be-explored effects of epitope availability during apo-
ptotic enzymatic cascade, and were excluded from analyses. For
analyses, cell counts per slide were converted to counts per

 milliliters of blood via the amount of blood utilized to create
patient slides.
Circulating cells associated with malignancy
Many of the identified circulating cells met the field consensus
criteria for circulating tumor cells (CTCs): epithelial protein (CK)
expression, absence of blood lineage CD45 expression, and an
intact nucleus (19). On the other hand, many PD-L1þ, CD45�
cells in patient samples both contained a nucleus morphologi-
cally distinct from surrounding white blood cells, and had CK
expression below the analytical threshold of the assay (Fig. 1).
While these cells were not observed in "healthy control" donor
samples, these cells have not been genetically confirmed to be of
malignant origin, and we refrained from labeling them as "CTCs."
Therefore, throughout this report, we have adopted the nomen-
clature circulating cells associated with malignancy (CCAM) to
refer to all cells that are (i) nonapoptotic, (ii) have a nucleus, (iii)
are CD45(�), and (iv) have cytomorphometric features consis-
tent with CTCs (size, shape, nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, etc.). In
other words, the CCAM category includes classic CTCs, as well as
cells that meet all other criteria to be a CTC, but do not express CK.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with R v3.2.0 packages
"stats," "survival," "survminer," "ggplot," and "maxstat." Fisher
exact and ANOVA tests were used to compare groups for cate-
gorical and continuous characteristics, respectively. The optimal
cutoff for dichotomizing PD-L1(þ) CCAMs for overall survival
was determined by a 10-fold cross-validation approach using
maximally selected log-rank statistics in the maxstat package in
R (20). Overall survival was calculated in months from the time of
blood draw to death from any cause. Patients still alive at time of
last follow-up were right censored. Differences in survival
between defined patient groups were evaluated using the log-
rank test. Mortality hazard was estimated from univariable and
multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression models.
The covariates considered in the multivariable Cox PH models
included: American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging
(IV vs. I–III), age, and PD-L1(þ) CCAMs. Log–log plot compar-
isons and Schoenfeld residuals were evaluated for violations of
the proportional hazards assumption. The models were refined
using a stepwise selection method in which individual covariates
had to be significantly associated (P < 0.05) with overall survival
to be kept in the model. Age did not meet this criterion. All
statistical tests were two-sided and a P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Distinct subpopulations of PD-L1þ CCAM
Of the 112 NSCLC patients studied, PD-L1(þ) CCAMs (see
Materials and Methods) were detected in the peripheral blood of
26 (23%). No PD-L1(þ) CCAMs were detected in "healthy con-
trols," whereas PD-L1(þ) CCAMs were detected in four of
20 "unhealthy controls" (Materials and Methods). Within the
PD-L1(þ) CCAM population (47 cells from 26 lung cancer
patients), two distinct subpopulations were noted on the basis
of the differential expression of CK (Fig. 1). More specifically, 19
cells were positive for CK [PD-L1(þ) CK(þ)], whereas 28 (60%)
were negative for CK [PD-L1(þ)CK(�)]. Table 1 shows the profile
of CCAMs detected in lung cancer patients.
PD-L1(þ) CCAM enumeration by histology and AJCC stage
The distribution of PD-L1(þ) CCAMs was evaluated across
tumor subtypes and AJCC stage (Supplementary Fig. S2). In
general, the PD-L1(þ) CCAMs appeared to be more common in
patients with stage IV cancer, yet the differences did not reach
statistical significance. Table 2 summarizes the 132 blood samples
including 112 from cancer patients and 20 from "unhealthy
control" patients.

 PD-L1(þ) CCAMs associated with worse survival
In an effort to better understand the prognostic relevance of
the PD-L1(þ) CCAM population, the relationship between
PD-L1(þ) CCAMs and long-term survival was evaluated. The
population was stratified using an optimal cutoff (see Materials
and Methods) of >1.1 PD-L1 (þ) CCAM per milliliter as the
threshold (all patients with >1.1 PD-L1(þ) CCAM/mL had lung
cancer). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that lung cancer
patients with >1.1 PD-L1(þ) CCAM/mL (n ¼ 14) experienced a

 To further characterize the prognostic implications of PD-L1
(þ) CCAMs, separate Cox PH models were created using pro-
gressively higher thresholds of PD-L1(þ) CCAMs concentrations
(Table 3). A dose–response relationship was observed, where the
mortality risk appeared to increase as the threshold increased
[indicating greater numbers of PD-L1(þ) CCAMs is associated
with worse prognosis], yet the confidence intervals widened as the
number of high risk patients declined.
Recognizing the PD-L1(þ) CCAMs that are negative for CK
(PD-L1þ/CK� CCAMs) represent a previously undescribed cir-
culating species, a subsequent analysis was performed by strati-
fying patients exclusively on the presence or absence of this
population of cells. The presence of PD-L1þ/CK� CCAMs was
associated with a worse prognosis, indicating that this represents a
clinically relevant cellular population (Supplementary Fig.
S3; Table 4). As a supplementary analysis, patients were stratified
by the presence or absence of PD-L1� cells that met our most
stringent criteria of CTCs (CKþ CCAMs that were PD-L1�); how-
ever, this population of cells was not found to be prognostic
(Table 4).
Discussion
PD-L1þ CCAMs were detected in the peripheral blood of 23%
of treatment-na€
�ve primary NSCLC patients. The tendency for the
prevalence of PD-L1þ CCAMs to increase among tumors at high-
est risk for systemic progression (advanced-stage tumors) is not
surprising, and is consistent with the results of circulating tumor
cell studies that trend toward higher prevalence in later stages
patients (21). The prevalence in the peripheral blood is roughly
half of what has been reported for tissue biopsies. More specif-
ically, previous studies investigating the incidence of PD-L1
expression in lung cancer tissue samples (using a variety of
antibodies and positivity thresholds), estimate that around
50% of lung cancers contain PD-L1þ cells (11). The most obvious
explanation for the lower frequency of PD-L1 detection in blood
compared with tumor samples is disease state, as tumor cells (or
CCAMs) would be far less likely to be found in the circulation
in patients with completely localized cancer (although they may
be). Among stage IV patients, nine of 19 (47%) had at least one
PD-L1þ CCAM. Most of the trial data that have defined the
prevalence of PD-L1þ cells in the tumor specimens of lung cancer
has been in stage IV or recurrent patients (11). The difference may
also relate to the sensitivity of the assay. Although up to half of the
cells in a solid tumor specimen may be PD-L1þ, CTCs or CCAMs
are rare populations in the blood compartment.
In this study, we report a population of PD-L1(þ) cells previ-
ously undescribed in lung cancer that share many characteristics
with circulating tumor cells [i.e., nucleus present, CD45(�),
nonapoptotic, size, shape, nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of CTCs],
but do not express CK. A recent publication has reported similar
circulating cells in bladder cancer patients (22). The study was too
small for prognostic interpretation, but single-cell sequencing of
these CD45�, PD-L1þ, CK� cells revealed copy number variations
consistent with malignant origin. In both studies, this population
was only able to be imaged because the automated digital micros-
copy platform used to evaluate the rare cell populations (Epic
Sciences CTC Detection Platform) did not include a positive or
negative selection step. This turned out to be a critically important
aspect of the current study, as just over half of the PD-L1þ cells did
not express CK. We have employed the phrasing "CCAM," or
CCAMs to describe a population of cells that have features
consistent with circulating tumors cells, yet recognize that 20%
of the unhealthy control patients had PD-L1þ CCAMs. It is not
unusual to identify low levels of CTCs in patients without cancer
(23), and for this reason most assays ultimately impose a thresh-
old of positivity, as we have done in prospective analyses [1.1 PD-
L1þ CCAM/mL]. The potential explanation for these cells include
clinically occult cancer, particularly as not all of the unhealthy
controls had the lesions removed (and may still have a lung cancer
that has not grown).
There is also the possibility that these cells represent a transition
in cancer cell phenotype, such as epithelial–mesenchymal tran-
sition (EMT). In a case study, utilizing a filtration-enrichment
strategy (ISET), Chinen and colleagues reported lung cancer–
associated cells positive for N-cadherin and negative for CK7 and
CK8 (24). The authors proposed an EMT-related mechanism (25,
26) to explain the observed phenomenon. PD-L1 expression and
EMT were found to be coregulated by miRNA-200 in a preclinical
model (27). In breast cancer tissue samples, EMT-like signatures
were found to be highly associated with higher PD-L1 expression
(28). A recent study reported detection of CD45�/PD-L1þ/
vimentinþ cells in the peripheral blood of colorectal carcinoma
and prostate cancer patients, presumably CTCs that had under-
gone EMT (29). Ultimately, we refrained from referring to these
populations as CTCs because we recognize the possibility that
they are related to malignancy but might not actually be tumor
derived.

 The presence of PD-L1þ CCAMs was significantly associ-
ated with increased 2-year mortality risk. This is consistent
with prior reports that have demonstrated a poorer prognosis
in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (30). Furthermore,
high concentrations of non-cell–bound (soluble) circulating
PD-L1 protein assessed via ELISA assay in 109 cancer pati-
ents was previously associated with shorter median survival
(18.7 months vs. 26.8 months) (31). We recognize that the
prognostic ability of PD-L1þ CCAM status in the peripheral
blood, while significant, is unlikely to change patient care.
Nonetheless, we feel this clinical association provides strong
evidence that the PD-L1þ CCAM population is clinically
relevant to the patients, potentially representing PD-L1
expression at some level of the host–tumor interface. Because
these samples were collected as a part of a prospective trial,
we are not able to compare the PD-L1 expression in the
peripheral blood to that of the primary tumors (primary
tumors not currently available for profiling). However, we
propose that the peripheral blood offers an important per-
spective of PD-L1 status that is independent of the status
of the primary tumor (i.e., if the primary tumor was negative,
it is possible that the patient may still benefit from check-
point inhibitors).
In conclusion, an enrichment-free, whole plasma scanning, rare
cell detection platform has enabled the identification of two
species of PD-L1–expressing cells in lung cancer patients that
appear to be clinically relevant. Further study is warranted to
evaluate the relationship between the cellular expression of PD-L1
in the peripheral blood and the efficacy of immunotherapy
affecting the PD-1 axis.
