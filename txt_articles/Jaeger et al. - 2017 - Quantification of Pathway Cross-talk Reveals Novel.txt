Abstract
Combinatorial therapeutic approaches are an imperative to
improve cancer treatment, because it is critical to impede com-
pensatory signaling mechanisms that can engender drug resis-
tance to individual targeted drugs. Currently approved drug
combinations result largely from empirical clinical experience
and cover only a small fraction of a vast therapeutic space. Here we
present a computational network biology approach, based on
pathway cross-talk inhibition, to discover new synergistic drug
combinations for breast cancer treatment. In silico analysis iden-
tified 390 novel anticancer drug pairs belonging to 10 drug classes
that are likely to diminish pathway cross-talk and display syner-
gistic antitumor effects. Ten novel drug combinations were val-
idated experimentally, and seven of these exhibited synergy in
human breast cancer cell lines. In particular, we found that one
novel combination, pairing the estrogen response modifier ral-
oxifene with the c-Met/VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor cabozantinib,
dramatically potentiated the drugs' individual antitumor effects
in a mouse model of breast cancer. When compared with high-
throughput combinatorial studies without computational prior-
itization, our approach offers a significant advance capable of
uncovering broad-spectrum utility across many cancer types.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease regarding the
underlying molecular alterations, the cellular composition of
tumors, and the different clinical outcomes (1), which hampers
the design of effective treatment strategies (2). To account for this
intrinsic diversity, drug discovery efforts have shifted toward
mechanism-based and target-oriented strategies, particularly aim-
ing at modulating specific molecular pathways, patient-specific
genetic alterations, and the tumor microenvironment (3, 4).
Despite the expanding repertoire of new anticancer agents,
treatment failure remains a major challenge in the management
of most advanced solid cancers, including breast cancer (5, 6).
Multiple compensatory mechanisms are known to counterbal-
ance therapeutic effects, eventually leading to treatment failure
(6). One of the most promising strategies for better clinical
outcomes is the use of combinatorial therapy to target the
distinct adaptive response mechanisms (7, 8), which may also
help to overcome toxicity associated with higher doses of single
drugs. In addition, synergistic drug combinations are often
more specific and therefore improve the therapeutically rele-
vant selectivity (9). However, although becoming the standard
care in (breast) cancer treatment, most approved drug combi-
nations are the result of empirical clinical experience, and often
rely on similar mechanisms of action as preexisting drug
combinations, which prevented a systematic sampling of the
therapeutic space (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Identifying drug combinations with therapeutic effect remains
a challenging task given the exhaustive number of possibilities.
Different approaches are available for predicting drug combina-
tions for complex diseases, mostly including mathematical
modeling, stochastic search techniques, as well as cell context–
based methods like global gene expression or targeted phospho-
proteomics profiling (10–13). More recently, network-based
models have been proposed for identifying drug synergies and
for examining the mechanisms of action of efficient combinations
(14–16).
Experimental studies have shown that cancer cells are able to
adapt signaling pathway circuits upon drug treatment by estab-
lishing alternative signaling routes through cross-talk (17, 18).
Hence, a critical aspect to improve cancer treatment is not only to
inhibit the primary oncogenic pathways that induce abnormal
cell proliferation but, simultaneously, to prevent functional
redundancies and pathway cross-talk that facilitate survival of
cancer cell populations rendering tumors resistant to therapy.
Current network pharmacology principles aim for a synergistic
multitarget intervention strategy to improve clinical efficacies,
while tackling critical aspects such as drug resistance (19, 20). In
line with this idea, we have derived a network-based computa-
tional method to quantify the cross-talk between signaling path-
ways involved in breast cancer and we assessed how combinato-
rial perturbations impact the signaling cross-talk. We then applied

 this measure to a set of approved and experimental breast cancer
drugs to identify combinations, which could efficiently diminish
pathway cross-talk and thereby increase clinical efficacy. Finally,
we experimentally validated novel drug combinations in several
human breast cancer cell lines and confirmed the invivo synergistic
effect between two drugs in mouse xenografts, emphasizing the
potential clinical relevance of our strategy.
Materials and Methods
Breast cancer drugs
We compiled a comprehensive set of drugs that are either
prescribed or in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment. Primary
information on FDA-approved breast cancer drugs has been
gathered from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This data
have been complemented with information from DrugBank
3.0 (21) and the therapeutic targets database (TTD; ref. 22).
Overall, we collected 64 breast cancer agents, of which 32 are
approved. The number of experimental compounds used for
breast cancer treatment is most likely higher; yet, the data are
scattered across the literature, not accessible in an automatic
manner, and often there is no available information on the
modulated therapeutic target(s).
Each drug has been associated with its therapeutic target(s). For
drugs from DrugBank, we considered only primary targets. Only if
none of the targets have a known pharmacologic action we
consider all targets for that drug. Targets from TTD were treated
as primary therapeutic targets. We further extracted pathways and
biological processes that are most likely modulated by a drug
through its target(s). Pathway information was retrieved from the
KEGG database (23).
Depending on the mechanism of action, we divided drugs into
cytotoxic and targeted agents. Furthermore, we classified the set of
breast cancer drugs according to their therapeutic target(s) into 11
drug classes. The complete set of breast cancer drugs considered
can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
Breast cancer drug combinations of clinical relevance
We extracted drug combinations considered for breast cancer
therapy by mining the drug combination database (DCDB;
ref. 24), the FDA orange book (25), the NCI, and the Clinical-
Trials.gov (26). In total, 170 drug combinations were obtained.
Some of them are already approved while the majority is currently
in clinical trials. Supplementary Figure S1 provides an overview of
the current drug combinations with respect to the 11 drug classes.
Therapeutic signaling networks and pathway cross-talk
inhibition
To chart the therapeutic networks associated with each drug, we
compiled all those KEGG pathways (excluding disease pathways)
that include any of the primary targets of the drug. On average
each drug affects 6.5 KEGG pathways (median ¼ 3, SD � 8.3).
Given the XML representation of a pathway, we created a directed
network including proteins and their interactions, whereas the
type of an interaction, such as activation or inhibition, was used to
determine the directionality of an edge in the network.
On the basis of the therapeutic signaling networks, we devel-
oped a cross-talk inhibition measure to estimate the amount of
cross-talk signaling that can be prevented between pathways by
inhibiting specific proteins simultaneously. The concept of path-
way cross-talk refers to protein interactions shared between dis-
tinct pathways. Because these interactions might also influence
the downstream signaling within a pathway, the concept also
comprises proteins and interactions downstream of the respective
cross-talking interactions (i.e., indirect cross-talk; Fig. 1).

 Given two therapeutic signaling networks, we determined the
potential cross-talk between them by identifying interactions
directly and indirectly involved in the cross-talk, and representing
them as a directed cross-talk network. Using this cross-talk repre-
sentation, we then applied a topology-based measure, namely
network efficiency (27), to determine the information flow within
the network. Network efficiency (NE) is defined as the sum of the
inverse length of the shortest path between all network elements
and can be computed as follows:
NE ¼
X
i„j
1
d i; j
ð
Þ
N N � 1
ð
Þ ;
with N representing the number of network elements and d
denoting the shortest distance between two elements i, j 2 N.
The network efficiency ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates
that all proteins communicate directly with each other, that is, a
fully connected network.
Using the network efficiency determined for cross-talking path-
ways, as described above, we simulated the inhibition of specific
protein target(s) and measured the amount of signaling that
persists (NEX) when removing protein interactions affected by
a pharmacologic intervention. We determined the relative reduc-
tion of network efficiency, that is, the pathway cross-talk inhibi-
tion (PCI), as follows:
PCI ¼ 1 � NEX
NE:
The final PCI for a given pair of breast cancer drugs is the average
of the cross-talk inhibitions between each pair of cross-talking
pathways forming the respective therapeutic networks.
Experimental validation of drug combinations
Drug combination experiments were conducted in five cell
lines, four of them, namely MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and
BT474, representing distinct breast cancer subtypes. In addition,
we also included U2OS, a bone osteosarcoma cell line, represent-
ing a widely used cancer cell line. When analyzing a combination,
we tested the activity of the individual drugs D1 and D2, and the
combination at four concentrations, selected from the literature to
cover their activity range (Supplementary Table S2). To assess the
cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of a single drug or a drug combination
in cell lines, we used the MTT assay for measuring cell viability
(28).
Cells were seeded at 1,000 to 5,000 cells per well in 96-well flat-
bottom cell culture plates. After 24 hours of incubation at 37�C
with 5% CO2, cells were exposed to four concentrations of drug or
drug combinations for 72 or 120 hours (Supplementary Table
S2). Cell survival was determined using an MTT-based assay. All
experiments were either performed in triplicates (individual
drugs) or quadruplicates (drug combinations); repeated three
independent times.
Further details on cell lines, culture conditions, and drugs can
be found in the Supplementary Section S1.
Drug combination index
Given the MTT cell viability measurements, we assessed wheth-
er a drug combination induces additive, synergistic, or antago-
nistic effects in cultured cells. To this end, we determined the drug
combination index (DCI) using the Loewe additivity as a refer-
ence model, assuming that a drug cannot interact with itself
(29, 30). This means that if two drugs are the same or very similar,
we expect their combined effect at equal concentrations to be
comparable to the one observed when administering one drug
alone at double concentration.
The DCI of a combination is computed on the basis of the half-
maximal effective concentration that is needed to inhibit cell
viability by X%, with X commonly corresponding to an inhibition
level of 50% (i.e., IC50). Formally, the DCIX is defined as follows:
DCIX ¼ CD1;X
ICX;D1
þ CD2;X
ICX;D2
;
where CD1,X and CD2,X represent the concentration of drug D1 and
drug D2 used in combination to induce an effect X while ICX,D1
and ICX,D2 indicate the corresponding concentrations of the single
agents required to produce the same effect. In other words, the
DCI measures the fractional shift between single and combina-
torial concentrations yielding an inhibition of cell survival of X%.
The concept of the DCI is exemplified for one combination in
Supplementary Fig. S2. Using this measure, we can quantify
synergistic, additive, and antagonistic combinatorial effects, com-
monly defined as DCI < 0.85, DCI �1, and DCI > 1.2, respectively
(Supplementary Table S3).
ICX values can be determined from dose–response curves for
any inhibition level X. Here, we used the drc R package to generate
sigmoid-fitted dose–response curves, from which we then esti-
mated the ICX for single drugs and combinations (31). In some
cases, the single agents do not reach the predefined inhibition
level, whereas in others the estimated ICX corresponds to a value
beyond the tested concentration range. In the latter one, we
exploited the relative standard error (RSE) associated with each
fit to decide whether to consider an ICX (16). The influence of
using different RSE thresholds for determining the DCI is dis-
cussed in Supplementary Section S2 and Supplementary Table S4.
No DCI is reported for cases where neither the single nor the
combined inhibition induces the desired effect.
Dose reduction index
A major aim of synergistic drug combinations is to reduce the
dose of a drug, thereby reducing toxicity while maintaining
therapeutic efficacy. The dose reduction index (DRI) measures
to which extent the concentration of a drug in combination can be
reduced at a given inhibition level X compared with the concen-
tration of an individual drug alone.
DRIX;D1¼ ICX;D1
CD1;X
DRIX;D2¼ ICX;D2
CD2;X :
In general, a DRI above 1 is considered to be beneficial.
Furthermore, larger DRIs correlate with a larger magnitude of
dose reduction for a given therapeutic effect.
Mouse xenograft model
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were prepared in a 1:1 PBS:
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) mixture and 1 � 106 cells were injected
directly into the mammary gland. When tumors reached a volume
of 120 to 150 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to different
groups and treated for 15 days with cabozantinib (oral gavage,
2 mg/kg), raloxifene (i.p. 6 mg/kg), the combination of both

 (1 mg/kg of cabozantinib and 3 mg/kg of raloxifene), or the
corresponding vehicles. At day 15, mice were sacrificed and tumors
were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Ki67 (Novocastra), and the
"In situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein" (Roche), following
manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analysis was used to
measure the activity of selected proteins in tumor samples of the
different groups. Further details can be found in the Supplemen-
tary Section S3. For determining the statistical difference between
the treatment groups we used the one-sided t test.
Results
PCI as a tool for inferring synergistic drug combinations
Alternative signaling through pathway cross-talk is one of the
main mechanisms leading to treatment failure (18). Therefore, we
devised a computational strategy to infer drug combinations that
specifically addresses this problem. Our approach is based on the
quantification of the level of cross-talk between signaling path-
ways that can be prevented by simultaneously inhibiting specific
sets of proteins. The concept of pathway cross-talk refers to shared
protein interactions between distinct signaling cascades, and the
interactions downstream of the ones that crosstalk (Fig. 1). To
determine pathway cross-talk and inhibition, we first built the
therapeutic networks associated with each individual drug by
considering its set of known primary targets mapped onto
well-annotated canonical pathways (23). We found that, on
average, each drug can be associated with 6.5 signaling pathways,
the sum of which constitutes its therapeutic signaling network.
Interactions directly or indirectly (i.e., downstream) involved in
cross-talk between drug pathways were integrated into a signaling
network in which we then assessed the levels of cross-talk inhi-
bition through individual or combinatorial target perturbations.
Using a topology-based measure of network efficiency (27), we
computed the flow of information within a cross-talk network
before and after inhibiting individual or combined drug targets.
Drug combinations with a high impact on PCI are expected to
present promising drug combinations.
To examine the clinical relevance of the PCI for inferring
novel drug combinations, we assessed its applicability on
approved or tested breast cancer drug combinations. To this
end, we generated all pairwise combinations from the 64
available breast cancer agents (Supplementary Table S1),
examining which of them are currently used for therapy or
in clinical trials. Of the potential 2,016 combinations, 170 are
documented as tested by the ClinicalTrials.gov (26), the FDA
orange book, the NCI (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/
druginfo/breastcancer), or the DCDB (24). We considered
these as clinically relevant combinations for breast cancer.
The remaining ones constituted a set of nontested combina-
tions. Given the two sets, we computed the PCI among the
combined drugs. Because pathway cross-talk, as defined here,
may only occur among related pathways sharing components,
we only considered drug pairs whose pathways have at least a
common protein, yielding a total of 1,132 combinations, 86
of which are among the 170 considered clinically relevant.
In general, we find that pathway pairs involved in clinically
relevant combinations share a significantly higher portion of
proteins and exhibit a higher cross-talk compared with a
background of all human KEGG pathways (P < 2.2e�16;
Supplementary Section S4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). When
specifically assessing the potential PCI achieved by drug com-
binations, we observed that those in clinical use have a signif-
icantly higher impact on PCI than randomly combined pairs of
drugs (Fig. 2A), with an average PCI of 0.34 compared with
0.25 (P ¼ 8.96 � 10�6). Indeed, for the few clinical drug
combinations where efficacy data are available, we found that
those exceeding the average PCI of 0.34 are more likely to show
clinical efficacy (P ¼ 0.03215; Supplementary Section S5
and Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4). This implies that

 cross-talk inhibition may be one of the molecular mechanisms
exploited by a number of successful breast cancer drug
combinations.
In addition, we assessed the PCI for 68 synergistic, additive, or
antagonistic drug pairs identified in a combination screen per-
formed in a tumor-derived liposarcoma cell line (DDLS817)
considering 14 targeted compounds from distinct drug classes
(16). This screen resulted in 14.3% synergistic, 38.5% additive,
and 22% antagonistic combinations. Figure 2B demonstrates that
synergistic combinations have a significantly higher PCI than
nonsynergistic drug pairs and particularly antagonistic ones, with
average values of 0.35 compared with 0.22 (P ¼ 0.00341) and
0.18(P ¼0.00069), respectively. A significant correlation between
PCI and drug combination index can be also observed as shown in
Supplementary Fig. S5 (Pearson correlation coefficient ¼ �0.439,
P ¼ 0.0001829). Furthermore, the average PCI of synergistic
combinations is comparable to the one determined for clinically
relevant combinations.
Overall, the two complementary evaluations support the value
of our approach to identify effective drug combinations.
Identification of novel drug combinations
Among the randomly combined drugs, we found a large
number of combinations showing a high impact on the cross-
talk inhibition between breast cancer pathways (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Table S5). These drug pairs are promising candi-
dates for combinatorial treatment because the pathway cross-talk
identified is directly involved in breast cancer-related processes.

 To select the most relevant ones, we used as a threshold the mean
PCI of 0.34 observed in the drug combination sets that are
clinically used. This includes 62.8% of the clinically relevant
combinations, exhibiting a higher likelihood of possessing clin-
ical efficacy (Supplementary Fig. S4), but only 37.3% of the
random set of combinations (Supplementary Fig. S6). Overall,
390 novel drug combinations showed a PCI � 0.34, including
drugs from 10 different classes, which are therefore likely to
exhibit synergistic effects. Furthermore, pathway pairs affected
by the novel drug combinations showed a significantly higher
protein overlap as well as a higher pathway cross-talk compared
with all human KEGG pathways with a P < 2.2e�16 (Supple-
mentary Section S4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Not surprisingly,
the majority of these combinations (370) occur between drugs
belonging to different therapeutic subclasses, showing the ability
of our method to prevent redundant mechanisms of action.
Moreover, about 65% of the new combinations include thera-
peutic classes never tested together before, expanding the sam-
pling of the potential therapeutic space. We believe that these drug
pairs have the potential to increase treatment efficacy by inhibit-
ing oncogenic pathways at distinct points, as well as by reducing
the concentration needed for inducing a given effect, which
consequently improves their therapeutic index. A full description
of the suggested drug combinations, together with the therapeutic
pathways involved in the cross-talk inhibition, is provided in
Supplementary Table S5.
Experimental validation of selected drug combinations
The fundamental aim of any combinatorial strategy is its
therapeutic application. Therefore, we selected a subset of drug
combinations to experimentally assess their effects on the prolif-
eration of tumor cells, a key process for tumorigenesis. During the
selection process, we only considered truly novel drug combina-
tions; hence omitting those which resemble approved or tested
ones (Supplementary Fig. S1). Trastuzumab, for instance, is
administered in combination with paclitaxel and tamoxifen
(32, 33), thus we disregarded combinations including HER2
inhibitors together with microtubule or estrogen receptor mod-
ulators. We selected 10 combinations from the remaining pool
according to their overall potential for cross-talk inhibition,
involving 10 targeted drugs and one cytotoxic agent (Fig. 3
and Table 1). To maximize the sampling of the combinatorial
therapeutic space, we only selected the highest PCI per represen-
tative drug class combination.
We then studied the effect of the selected drug combinations
in five human cancer cell lines, four of them representing
distinct breast cancer subtypes (Fig. 4A), namely triple-negative
(MDA-MB-231), hormone receptor-positive (MCF-7), HER2-
overexpressing (SKBR3), and triple-positive (BT-474) breast
cancer, whereas the fifth was derived from osteosarcoma
(U2OS). For the quantification of cytotoxic effects induced by
individual drugs or drug combinations, we used the MTT assay,
which measures cell proliferation and viability (Supplementary
Section S1; ref. 28).
To determine if the tested combinations were of synergistic,
additive, or antagonistic nature, we computed the Loewe addi-
tivity-based drug combination index (DCIX) for each combina-
tion in each cell line (30). The DCIX compares the half-maximal
effective concentrations for inhibiting X% of cell viability of single
agents with the concentration derived for a combination. To avoid
overestimating the number of synergistic combinations and, to
some extent, account for cell line variability, we adopted a more
stringent definition of synergy (Supplementary Table S3), con-
sidering a DCIX below 0.85 as synergistic. A DCIX above 1.2
indicates antagonism whereas any value in-between depicts addi-
tivity (0.85 > DCIX � 1.2; ref. 29).
Considering an inhibition level of 50%, we generated sig-
moid-fitted dose–response curves based on the MTT assays,
from which we then estimated IC50 and DCI50 values (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2 for an example and Supplementary Fig. S7 for
all dose–response curves). Figure 4B shows the DCI50 derived
for each combination in the five cell lines. Our results showed
that seven out of ten combinations tested displayed a syner-
gistic behavior in, at least, one cancer cell line. Overall, we
found that 32% of the combinations were synergistic, 38% were
additive, and 16% exhibited antagonistic effects in human
cancer cell lines. For another 14% we could not determine a
reliable DCI. Interestingly, the fraction of synergistic drug
combinations slightly increased up to 35% when analyzing
only breast cancer cell lines. These numbers emphasize the
significant enrichment of synergistic drug combinations com-
pared with traditional experimental high-throughput screens
(P < 1e�04; Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B), which detect
synergy in 4% to 14% of the drug pairs tested (16, 34, 35). A
detailed description of the comparison can be found in the
Supplementary Material (Section S6).
The per-combination perspective shows that the selected com-
binations are synergistic in a broader extent than anticipated a
priori (Supplementary Fig. S9), given the heterogeneity of breast
cancer (36, 37). For instance, DC07 is synergistic in four cancer
cell lines, DC04 and DC09 in three, DC02 and DC10 in two, and
DC05 and DC06 in one.
When analyzing drug combinations separately, we observed
clear correlations between the degree of synergy and the

 molecular features of each cancer cell line. In the case of DC09,
trastuzumab combined with cabozantinib, a very strong syn-
ergy was identified in the HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells.
Strong synergy was also observed for triple-positive cancer cells
(BT-474), which express in addition to HER2, the estrogen, and
progesterone hormone receptors. Yet, in MCF-7 cells that lack
HER2 overexpression,
DC09 still showed some synergy,
although decreased. In turn, complete lack of HER2 in the
triple-negative and osteosarcoma cells revealed antagonistic
interactions between trastuzumab and cabozantinib. The oppo-
site trend was visible for DC10, raloxifene and NVP-AEW541,
which showed the best synergy in MCF-7 cells followed by BT-
474 cells, whereas an additive effect was detected for SKBR3
cells. Surprisingly, a strong synergy was obtained for DC04 in
MCF-7 cells and SKBR3 cells, although this combination
includes a PARP1 inhibitor, which is expected to be effective
in triple negative breast cancers (38). Note that, although
individual breast cancer drug indications might give insights
on the synergistic mechanisms of a combination in a certain
cancer subtype (Supplementary Table S6), experiments in larger
cell panels would be required to elucidate the mechanism of
synergy of a combination regarding a certain cancer subtype.
When considering the combinatorial effects with respect
to the individual cancer cell lines, we observed that MCF-7
cells and SKBR3 cells tend to be more sensitive toward the
selected drug combinations, with 50% being synergistic and the
remaining ones showing at least additive effects (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S10). Again, this enrichment is significant with respect

 to high-throughput screens (P ¼ 5e�04; Supplementary Fig.
S8C). In turn, 30% of the combinations were antagonistic in
U2OS cells and BT-474 cells, and 20% were antagonistic in
MDA-MB-231 cells. These observations might reflect the prev-
alence of therapeutic strategies, that is, drugs and combina-
tions, for the more common hormone receptor-positive and
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer subtypes.
U2OS cells were included as additional cancer cell line to
examine the specificity of synergistic effects, because we recently
found that individual anticancer drugs designed for a particular
cancer (sub)type do not show a significantly higher activity in
cancer cell lines derived from that specific tumor type (39).
Although the IC50 is the most used index to measure the
effectiveness of a compound at inhibiting a specific biological
function, we examined the potential effect of concentration-
dependent pharmacodynamic interactions, we determined the
DCI for a series of inhibition levels ranging from 20% to 80%,
which corresponds to DCI20 to DCI80. Overall, we found our
results to be fairly robust, with 68.3% of the combinations
showing a consistent interaction behavior, independently of
the inhibition level considered, that is, we found neither
synergistic–antagonistic nor additive–antagonistic shifts (Sup-
plementary Fig. S11A).
Effect of the raloxifene and cabozantinib combination in a
xenograft mouse model
The experimental validation in cancer cell lines revealed a
clear synergistic therapeutic effect for combination DC02 (ral-
oxifene with cabozantinib) in hormone receptor-positive breast
cancer cells (DCI50 ¼ 0.39). Our computational model sug-
gested that the observed cross-talk inhibition was the result of
the simultaneous modulation of estrogen signaling together
with the PI3K/AKT and VEGF pathways by the two drugs, which
should not only reduce the growth of the primary tumor but
also its ability to spread. Interestingly, we found that this
particular combination exhibited a DRI of 51.9 and 2.66 for
raloxifene and cabozantinib, respectively. In other words, to
achieve the same inhibition level, the doses of the individual
drugs could be significantly reduced when combined (Fig. 5).
Finally, its DCI showed a remarkably consistent synergistic
behavior in MCF-7 cells throughout all the inhibition levels
(Supplementary Fig. S11B).
We thus examined the impact of DC02 in vivo, using MCF-7
cells orthotopically implanted in nude mice, which were trea-
ted for 15 days with cabozantinib, raloxifene, or the combina-
tion of both. We selected concentrations of 1 mg/kg for cabo-
zantinib and 3 mg/kg for raloxifene (low doses) that were
previously reported to have a minor or no effect on tumor
growth in related conditions (40, 41). However, because mice
treated with the combination were exposed to higher overall
drug doses, we assessed the effect of the individual drugs on
tumor growth doubling their concentrations. Thus, we applied
2 mg/kg for cabozantinib and 6 mg/kg for raloxifene to avoid
that a stronger effect observed for the combination is merely
induced by the higher drug concentration administered in the
combinatorial treatment.
We found that treating tumor-bearing mice with cabozantinib
or raloxifene alone induced a cytostatic effect on tumor growth
(Fig. 6A). Strikingly, in agreement with our observations in
cultured cell lines and the cross-talk inhibition model, the com-
bined treatment of mice with lower doses of cabozantinib and
raloxifene showed a clear synergistic effect reducing the size of the
tumors by more than 60% (Fig. 6A). Despite its dramatic impact
on tumor growth, the combination has no effect on the body
weight and none of the animals demonstrated abnormalities in
their behavior, indicating that the combinatorial treatment is
not more stressful than individual treatments (Supplementary
Fig. S12). To explore whether the molecular processes leading to
tumor reduction were indeed the ones suggested by the cross-talk
inhibition model, we performed immunohistochemical analyses
of tumor sections at the end of the treatment (day 15). TUNEL
staining assays showed slightly increased cell death levels in
tumors from cabozantinib-treated mice but no differences in the
raloxifene-treated mice, which is consistent with observations in
ERþ human breast tumors (42). Interestingly, when combining
both drugs, cell death levels increased 9.5 times compared with
the initial or vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 6B and C). We alsofound
that cell proliferation, based on Ki67 staining, was strongly
inhibited in tumors from mice treated with raloxifene and, to an
even larger extent, in tumors from mice treated with the combined
drugs (Fig. 6D). We did not observe any effect on cell proliferation
in tumors from cabozantinib-treated mice.
The effects on cell proliferation and cell death, as detected in the
xenograft mouse tumors, were in line with the current knowledge
on the mechanism of action of both drugs (40, 42–44). To further
assess PCI for DC02 at the molecular level, we performed Western
blotting with tumor samples. In particular, we analyzed the
activity of proteins involved in the pathways that were predicted
to be modulated predominantly by the drug combination, includ-
ing Akt and Src and the nuclear form of the estrogen receptor
(nER; Fig. 6E). We found that the drug combination had a stronger
effect than the individual drugs on the activities of both Src and

 Akt, which was also clear analyzing downstream members of the
pathways such as Bcl2 and cyclin D1 (Fig. 6F). These results are
consistent with the proposed effect of the drug combination on
cross-talk signaling and the reduced tumor growth observed in the
xenografts.
Taken together, our study confirms that the combination of
cabozantinib and raloxifene has a stronger therapeutic effect in
vivo than the single drugs at higher doses. Our results indicate that
the dramatic, synergistic effect of the combination on tumor
growth emerges from the simultaneous induction of cell death
by cabozantinib and the inhibition of cell proliferation by ralox-
ifene. These mechanistic insights agree with the cross-talk inhi-
bition calculated for DC02, which mostly comes from the simul-
taneous modulation of estrogen and prolactin signaling together
with the PI3K/AKT and VEGF signaling pathways by the two
drugs. Thus, as suggested by our model, inhibiting the cross-talk
between these pathways prevents alternative signaling events,
which regulate cell proliferation and survival.
Discussion
Combinatorial therapy is a very promising strategy for improv-
ing cancer treatment. The combination of drugs allow to interfere
with compensatory mechanisms, often related to treatment fail-
ure, using drug concentrations that are less toxic than the high
doses of single drugs usually required to achieve similar effects.
However, despite its great potential, most approved drug combi-
nations are the result of empirical clinical experience and, not
being rationally designed, cover only a small fraction of the vast
therapeutic space. In this study, we have presented a computa-
tional network biology approach to identify potentially synergis-
tic drug combinations against breast cancer. Even though we
focus specifically on pathway cross-talk as a major contributor
to treatment failure, other oncogenic features, such as gene
mutations, might also be helpful for finding combinatorial treat-
ment (45). Overall, our strategy has identified a set of anticancer
drug pairs with a large impact on cross-talk inhibition. The
experimental validation of ten selected novel combinations con-
firmed a synergistic behavior for seven of them in, at least, one
of the four breast cancer cell lines tested. This represents a
significant enrichment compared with combinatorial studies
without computational prioritization. Furthermore, we con-
firmed that raloxifene combined with cabozantinib has a dra-
matic synergistic effect interfering with tumor growth in vivo using
a mouse xenograft model based on MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells, supporting the potential clinical relevance of our strategy.
Even though further research is required to enable the translation
of a promising combination into therapeutic strategies, our results
show that approaches focusing on the inhibition of cross-talk
between pathways could provide valuable mechanistic informa-
tion to discover synergistic drug effects. Moreover, we centered our
study on breast cancer, but we believe that our approach can be
also applied to other complex diseases, in which pathway cross-
talk is likely to play an important role.
