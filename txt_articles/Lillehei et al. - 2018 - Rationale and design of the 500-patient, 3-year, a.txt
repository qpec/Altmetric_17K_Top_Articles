Implantationof biodegradable wafers impregnated with carmustine (BCNU) is one of the few chemother-
apeutic modalities that have been evaluated in Phase III trials and approved by the US FDA for treatment
of newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and recurrent glioblastoma. Enrolling up to 500 patients for 3-year
follow-up at over 30 sites, the prospective Vigilant ObservatIon of GlIadeL WAfer ImplaNT (VIGILANT) reg-
istry (NCT02684838) will evaluate BCNU wafers for treatment of CNS malignancies in contemporary prac-
tice and in the new era of molecular tumor analysis. Subgroup analyses will include tumor type, molecular
marker status, and treatment combinations. Interim analyses from the VIGILANT registry will be reported
until complete results are available in 2024.

BCNU wafers (Gliadel R
�, Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC, GA, USA) are biodegradable copolymers (prolifeprospan 20)
impregnated with the alkylating agent carmustine (BCNU [1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea]) (Figure 1) [1,2].
The wafers were originally developed by Brem and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
to avoid the toxicity associated with systemic administration of BCNU [3]. At that time, intravenous BCNU
was a standard treatment for high-grade glioma (HGG), with a modest survival benefit [4]. The concept of
locally introducing an antineoplastic therapy into CNS tumors, thereby bypassing the blood–brain barrier, spurred
evaluation of several new approaches, including intranasal and convection-enhanced delivery [5].

The BCNU wafer releases BCNU at a constant rate over a period of a week. Transport into the tissue adjacent to the implant occurs
primarily by diffusion, which is augmented immediately postresection by convective transport with interstitial flow resulting from
vasogenic edema. More than 70% of the copolymer degrades by 3 weeks [2].
BCNU: 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea.
In a Phase III, multicenter, and placebo-controlled trial in 222 patients with recurrent HGG, Brem et al.
demonstrated improved 6-month mortality comparing BCNU wafers with placebo wafers (40 vs 53%; p = 0.06),
with a median overall survival (OS) increase of 8 weeks (31 vs 23 weeks; p = 0.06) [6]. Two-thirds of these patients had
recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), and BCNU wafers were associated with significantly reduced 6-month mortality in
this patient subset (44 vs 64%; p = 0.02). In 1997, the US FDA approved BCNU wafers for treatment of recurrent
GBM.
Subsequently, two Phase III, multicenter, and placebo-controlled trials evaluated BCNU wafer implantation in
patients with newly diagnosed HGG. In a study of 32 patients, Valtonen et al. demonstrated a significant median
survival benefit of 18.2 weeks for BCNU wafers followed by radiotherapy (RT) compared with placebo wafers
followed by RT (58.1 vs 39.9 weeks; p = 0.012) [7]. Then, in a study of 240 patients, Westphal et al. demonstrated
a significant median survival benefit of 2.3 months for BCNU wafers followed by RT compared with placebo
wafers followed by RT (13.9 vs 11.6 months; log-rank p = 0.03, stratified by country) [8,9]. In this Phase III trial,
the incidence of postoperative cerebral spinal fluid leaks (16.0 vs 12.0%) and intracranial hypertension (9.0 vs
2.0%) was higher in patients receiving BCNU wafers than in patients receiving placebo wafers. In 2003, the FDA
approved BCNU wafers for the treatment of newly diagnosed HGG (WHO grade III and grade IV glioma). The
Phase III trials of BCNU wafers are summarized in Table 1.
The development and the FDA approval of BCNU wafers represented the first major advance in the treatment
of HGG since 1978, when RT was adopted as the standard adjuvant treatment of HGG [10]. To date, the FDA has
only approved one additional chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of newly diagnosed HGG, temozolomide
(TMZ) (Temodar, Merck & Co., NJ, USA) in 2005 [11], as well as one additional chemotherapeutic agent for the
treatment of recurrent GBM in 2009, bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, CA, USA) [12].
In 2005 the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Brain Tumor and Ra-
diotherapy Groups and the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) published the results of a Phase III
multicenter, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial treating 573 patients with RT alone versus RT with con-
current daily oral TMZ followed by six cycles of adjuvant TMZ for five consecutive days every 28 days (a regimen
abbreviated here as RT/TMZ) [13,14]. The EORTC/NCIC study demonstrated a significant median survival benefit
of 2.5 months with RT/TMZ compared with treatment with RT alone (14.6 [95% CI: 13.2−16.8] vs 12.1 months

[95% CI: 11.2−13.0]). At 2 years, OS in the RT/TMZ treatment arm increased from 10.9 to 27.2%. In 2005,
the FDA approved TMZ for use in newly diagnosed GBM in accordance with the dose schedule established by the
EORTC/NCIC study. Since then, the RT/TMZ regimen has been ‘standard of care’ for histologically confirmed
newly diagnosed GBM following surgical biopsy or resection.
There are thus few FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents available for patients with either newly diagnosed
HGG or recurrent GBM. In recent large Phase III trials in newly diagnosed HGG, several other chemotherapeutic
agents have failed to improve survival beyond what was achieved in the EORTC/NCIC study [15–17]. At the same
time, a number of prospective single-arm or retrospective studies have suggested that the combination of BCNU
wafers plus RT/TMZ may improve survival by several months beyond that provided by either therapy alone,
without a significant increase in toxicity [18]. In addition, two recent meta-analyses have affirmed this survival
benefit for BCNU wafers [19,20]. BCNU wafers are used worldwide, with regulatory approval most recently granted
in Japan in 2012 and in Mexico in 2015.
There is thus a need for a large-scale evaluation of the performance of BCNU wafers in the contemporary
treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, critically examining, in this new era of molecular tumor grading,
which patients might most benefit from implantation of BCNU wafers. A means for this evaluation is the Vigilant
ObservatIon of GlIadeL WAfer ImplaNT (VIGILANT) registry (NCT02684838), a prospective, observational
study of up to 500 patients prescribed BCNU wafers as part of the treatment of either newly diagnosed or recurrent
CNS malignancies of all kinds. This article describes the rationale and design of the VIGILANT registry, with the
intent of encouraging active participation and stimulating anticipation of results.
Background & rationale
Emergence of molecular biomarker profiling
At the time of the development of BCNU wafers in the mid 1990s and early 2000s, testing was not available
for predictive and prognostic molecular biomarkers. In the current era of molecular medicine, it is appropriate to
revisit the performance of BCNU wafer implantation for treatment of HGG [20]. It is possible that improvement of
survival with BCNU wafer implantation may be limited to particular subgroups of patients with specific molecular
markers. The addition of BCNU wafers to the RT/TMZ regimen could then be potentially tailored to those
patients with a favorable molecular profile.
After significant restructuring in 2016, the WHO classification of CNS tumors now employs molecular param-
eters in addition to histology in order to define tumor entities, changing the structure of CNS tumor diagnoses for
the molecular age. [21] The updated guidelines merge astrocytic gliomas, oligodendrogliomas, and mixed oligoas-
trocytic gliomas, all of which were formerly considered separate entities, into the single group ‘diffuse astrocytic
and oligodendroglial tumors’. GBMs (WHO grade IV) are the most malignant within the spectrum of diffuse
astrocytomas, accounting for 60% of all astrocytic tumors. Tumors categorized as diffuse gliomas frequently have
an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, a hallmark genetic alteration that is now seen as a significant factor for
the stratification of gliomas. In the new WHO classification, GBMs are grouped as wildtype (about 90% of cases)

and mutant (about 10% of cases) [21]. Mutations in IDH-1 and IDH-2 are found to be associated with favorable
prognosis and prolonged OS [22].
Another important molecular marker is the gene encoding the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) at 10q26, which has the potential to counteract the efficacy of separate chemotherapy with alkylating
agents like TMZ and BCNU. MGMT is a suicide DNA repair enzyme that protects cells against damage from
ionizing and alkylating agents. GBM cells that express decreased levels of MGMT, with downregulation caused by
aberrant methylation of the gene’s promoter, respond better to these treatments, for they lack the ability to repair
the damage that is introduced. The association between MGMT promoter methylation and response to alkylating
agents is well known [23], and contemporary HGG trials of alkylating agents commonly stratify patients according
to MGMT promoter methylation status [24].
Codeletion of both the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q) is the
molecular genetic signature of oligodendrogliomas, which represent approximately 15% of diffuse gliomas in
adults [25]. The 1p/19q codeletion is associated with IDH mutations and is a strong independent prognostic
biomarker for response to alkylating chemotherapy and improved survival [26].
Yet another recognized molecular marker is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. GBMs have been
found to upregulate several growth factors and their receptors. The EGFR gene is the most frequently amplified
and overexpressed gene in about 60% of GBMs. EGFR amplification has been linked to increased proliferation,
resistance to chemotherapy, and consequently shorter survival times [27].
BCNU wafers combined with other therapies
The Phase III trial of BCNU wafers and the Phase III trial of RT/TMZ for treatment of newly diagnosed GBM
each demonstrated an increase in median OS when compared with RT alone. For BCNU wafers in the 240-patient
HGG Westphal et al. Phase III trial, median OS increased from 11.6 to 13.9 months; for RT/TMZ in the 573-
patient EORTC/NCIC trial, median OS increased from 12.1 to 14.6 months in GBM patients. Since these trials
were reported, interest has grown for investigating whether additional improvements to survival might be realized
by sequential combination of the antiproliferative mechanisms of BCNU and TMZ. Because RT and concurrent
TMZ do not usually begin until 3–6 weeks after resection, implanted BCNU wafers may provide treatment during
the interim period between the resection and the start of RT/TMZ without significantly adding to or exacerbating
the adverse effects of RT/TMZ.
A Phase III trial of RT/TMZ with and without BCNU wafers has not been conducted, and it is unlikely
that one will be conducted. However, a number of prospective single-arm and retrospective studies have reported
combination data for treatment of newly diagnosed HGG (Table 2). In a systematic review of such studies,
Ashby et al. identified 11 articles published between 2008 and 2015 that met inclusion criteria [28–38]. These 11
articles report outcomes for 411 patients who received BCNU wafers plus standard RT/TMZ. Among these 11
studies, patients were similar in age, gender, and performance status; approximately 85% had newly diagnosed
GBM. For the ten trials that reported median OS, the weighted mean was 18.2 months (n = 379 patients; range
12.7–21.3 months) – an improvement by 3–4 months compared with the previously reported median OS for
BCNU wafers (13.9 months) [8] or for TMZ (14.6 months) [13] when either therapy was used alone with RT in a
Phase III trial.
The 11 studies evaluated by Ashby et al. had substantial limitations: only three were prospective, several had
small enrollments, only two undertook MGMT testing, and none assessed other biomarkers. Consequently, the
relatively consistent increased survival benefit for combination therapy across these studies might reflect improved
resection techniques and better neuro-oncologic care. On the other hand, the combined antiproliferative effects of
the two separate and sequentially administered chemotherapies might have an additive effect in improving survival,
as occurs for combination therapies used for other type of cancers.
In the systematic review, Ashby et al. found that nine of the 11 trials reported grade 3 and 4 adverse events in
accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [39]. For 372 patients in these nine trials,
a total of 147 grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported. Myelosuppression (10.22%), neurologic deficit (7.8%),
healing abnormalities (4.3%), and seizures (3.0%) were the most commonly reported grade 3 and 4 adverse events.
These adverse events seemed to reflect the separate and independent adverse event profiles of BCNU wafers and
RT/TMZ rather than any synergistically enhanced toxicity. For example, because only trace amounts of BCNU
are found in the systemic circulation after release from the polymeric wafers, the common grade 3 and 4 adverse
event, myelosuppression, was most likely due to the systemic toxicity of RT and/or TMZ.

Recently, tumor-treating fields have been approved by the FDA for treatment of both newly diagnosed HGG and
recurrent GBM [40]. These fields are low-intensity (200 kHz) alternating electric fields that have been demonstrated
to block cell division and interfere with organelle assembly. For newly diagnosed HGG, tumor-treating fields are
administered with standard maintenance TMZ. To date, no data have been published about the combination of
BCNU wafers with tumor-treating fields.
BCNU wafers for treatment of recurrent HGG
HGG recurs in virtually all patients after initial treatment. Due in part to the molecular heterogeneity and constant
evolution of HGG, it is not possible to therapeutically target a consistently present and reliable final common
pathway. The cellular and molecular heterogeneity is not unique to HGG among tumor types, but it is particularly
pronounced for HGG tumors and may account for resistance to the therapies now available [41–43].

 Clinical Trial Protocol
Lillehei, Kalkanis, Liau et al.
Currently, the standard of care for recurrent HGG remains undefined [44]. The American Association of Neuro-
logical Surgeons level 2 guidelines recommend that patients with recurrent HGG who have had previous surgical
resection be considered for repeat surgery, taking into account performance status, tumor location and tumor
size [45]. However, only an estimated 20–30% of patients with recurrent HGG qualify for a second resection and
would possibly be eligible for implantation of BCNU wafers [44].
Few studies have evaluated the use of BCNU wafers for treatment of recurrent GBM since the 1995 Phase III
randomized controlled study by Brem et al. [6]. Recently, Klein et al. retrospectively analyzed outcomes in three
different group of patients with recurrent GBM [46]. Median survival after progression was 9.2 months in elderly
patients (>65 years) receiving BCNU wafers, 7.6 months in elderly patients not receiving BCNU wafers (p = 0.34),
and 9.2 months in younger patients receiving BCNU wafers (p = 0.35). There were no significant differences in
adverse events between elderly and younger patients receiving BCNU wafers, although there was a tendency for
elderly patients to experience more seizures (five of 24 patients vs two of 39 patients).
Contemporary patterns of care
Beginning 20 years ago, the Glioma Outcomes Project initiated a prospective observational registry in order
to track practice patterns and outcomes among patients with malignant glioma. Between 1997 and 2000, 134
clinicians enrolled 788 patients at 52 clinical sites. In a series of publications, the Glioma Outcomes Project
provided benchmark data to enable comparison of individual practice patterns and outcomes, flagging patterns
that conflicted with current guidelines and those that suggested the need for further research [47–52].
One of the surprising findings of the Glioma Outcomes Project was demonstration that the level of clinical trial
participation for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HGG was only 15.1% [51,52]. Many contemporary
clinical trials exclude patients who have received BCNU wafers rather than using that treatment as a stratification
factor [53]. As a consequence, because the potential for clinical trial enrollment is rightfully considered important,
patients who might benefit from local therapy with BCNU wafers but would not otherwise qualify for a clinical
trial are not even counseled that the treatment is available. It is possible that imaging characteristics of BCNU
wafers after implantation may be thought to increase the difficulty of interpreting radiographic progression in
trials of new therapies. But the typical pattern of changes associated with BCNU wafer — implantation contrast
enhancements and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal — has been well documented to peak 1 or 2 months
after implantation [54,55].
Like the Glioma Outcomes Project, the VIGILANT registry will capture practice patterns, but now at a time of
significant transformation in the classification and treatment of malignant gliomas. The evolution of intraoperative
imaging, functional brain mapping, and photodynamic detection technology to distinguish tumor from brain
has significantly improved the ability of neurosurgeons to undertake safer and more aggressive tumor resection.
Understanding of tumor biology has improved significantly, tumor classification has been clarified, and application
of genomic advances allows more precise selection of optimal therapy for individual patients. In particular, the
initial assessment, management, and follow-up of patients with HGG now more frequently takes place in a
multidisciplinary team setting that facilitates organized delivery of care, adherence to guidelines, and access to
clinical trials. The VIGILANT registry will also track quality of life, a distinct outcome that can appreciably affect
progression-free survival and OS. Patients with HGG are especially prone to quality-of-life challenges, ranging
from fatigue and depression to seizures and focal neurologic deficits [56].
Design of the VIGILANT registry
Design
With a projected enrollment of 500 patients and a follow-up period of 3 years, the VIGILANT registry will examine
the contemporary performance of BCNU wafers in the current era of molecular markers, gaining insights into
what combination of factors can contribute to improving patient survival and quality of life. A schematic of the
VIGILANT registry is provided in Figure 2.
At each participating site in the USA, the study will be reviewed and approved by the institutional review
board/independent ethics committee. Data for each patient will be collected by means of an electronic case report
form and data capture system.
Management of the VIGILANT registry is overseen by the sponsor of the registry, Arbor Pharmaceuticals.
Members of the VIGILANT Registry Steering Committee are responsible for the prioritization of registry objectives,
as well as for monitoring and reviewing the conduct of the registry, participation in data review, and oversight

of registry management and quality assurance practices. Under the guidance of the steering committee, periodic
interim analyses of the VIGILANT registry will be performed and reported.
Eligibility criteria
The VIGILANT registry will enroll patients who have undergone BCNU wafer implantation as part of the
usual care for the treatment of CNS tumors, including newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG. Because in current
medical practice BCNU wafers are used in patients with various CNS tumor types, the VIGILANT registry is not
limited to observation of patients with HGG. As an observational study, the VIGILANT registry does not alter
patient/physician relationships and does not influence physician drug prescription or therapeutic management.
Patients receive usual care from treating physicians.
Enrollment criteria for the VIGILANT registry are uncomplicated. Patients must be at least 18 years of age
and have no medical conditions that, at investigator discretion, put them at increased risk by participation in the
VIGILANT registry. This registry allows for patients to be simultaneously enrolled in a clinical trial provided that
the trial does not exclude patients treated with BCNU wafers. Every patient must execute a medical record release
form and sign informed consent to participate in the registry within 14 days after surgery for treatment of CNS
tumors.
Planned enrollment & study length
The sample size of approximately 500 patients for the VIGILANT registry was based on an assessment of feasibility
rather than statistical factors. Each enrolled patient will remain in the registry for up to 3 years, and the registry
itself will continue for up to 8 years.
End points & analyses
The primary end points of the VIGILANT registry are overall, disease-specific, and progression-free survival rates
for patients treated with BCNU wafers. Secondary end points include: the effect of biomarker status on patient
outcomes; the incidence, types, and patterns of adverse events; changes in patient health status as assessed by the
physician-completed Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale [57]; changes in quality-of-life status as assessed by
the patient-completed (FACT-Br) questionnaire; the patterns of use associated with BCNU wafers in real-world
conditions; and healthcare utilization data based on length of hospitalization. Adverse events and serious adverse
events will be recorded and assessed by the investigators for relatedness to the use of BCNU wafers. The quality of
that relationship will be scored on the scale of definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely related,
and not related. All serious adverse events must be reported within 24 h. The actions taken regarding each adverse
event and related outcomes will also be recorded.
Collection of follow-up information will be performed during routine medical visits. There are no registry-
specific visits required. At each office visit, the patient’s follow-up imaging will be reviewed (if performed), patients
will be asked to complete the FACT-Br questionnaire about quality of life, and clinicians will be asked to assess
patients using the KPS scale. Data will also be collected for any adverse event occurring outside of clinic visits and
any subsequent hospitalizations.
Patient data will be analyzed by tumor type, by the presence of focal or multifocal tumors and by the status
of the molecular biomarkers IDH-1 and IDH-2,MGMT promoter methylation, 1p/19q co-deletion and EGFR
amplification. Tumor information will include the type and extent of resection, the systems used for surgery
(i.e., neuronavigation, photodynamic visualization, or other), initial tumor volume, volume of the residual tu-
mor, and the methods used to capture these data. Concomitant medications will also be recorded.
Survival analysis will be conducted based on biomarker status and on other potential contributing variables (age
at diagnosis, gender, KPS at diagnosis, tumor location, early progression, and treatment interventions). Tumor
progression will be assessed using the criteria of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working
group [58]. In addition, healthcare utilization data will be collected about the length of stay for the primary procedure
and the length of stay for any subsequent hospitalization. Safety end points include all serious adverse events, events
of interest, and suspected nonserious drug events.
Statistical analysis
There are two analysis populations in the VIGILANT registry: the full analysis set, consisting of all enrolled
patients; and the safety analysis set, consisting of consented patients who undergo a baseline visit and receive

BCNU wafers. All data summarization and analysis will be performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS, NC,
USA) version 9.4 or later. The number and percentage of patients who discontinue from the study and the reason
for discontinuation and primary cause of death will be summarized. Quantitative variables will be described by the
number of observations, mean, standard deviation, and range. Qualitative variables will be described by absolute
and relative frequency and number of missing data. All statistical tests will be two sided at the 5% significance level.
Conclusion
The 500-patient VIGILANT registry will be one of the largest prospective observational studies ever conducted to
track outcomes and practice patterns among patients with CNS malignancies. The rationale for a large-scale analysis
of BCNU wafers for treatment of CNS malignancies includes the following considerations: the performance of
BCNU wafers with regard to currently evaluated molecular biomarkers is unknown; data suggesting an increased
survival benefit from the combination of BCNU wafers followed sequentially by RT/TMZ is limited to small
trials; current practices and outcomes of patients with recurrent HGG might help elucidate best practices; and at a
transformative time for neuro-oncology, a large-scale registry might provide needed insights for improving survival
and quality of life.
