Abstract
The relationship between obesity and depression is well described. However, the evidence linking 
depression and body mass index (BMI) across the broad range of body size is less consistent. We 
examined the association between depressive symptoms and BMI in a sample of adult women in 
the Buffalo-Niagara region between 1997 and 2001. Using logistic regression, we investigated 
whether increased weight status beyond normal-weight was associated with a higher prevalence of 
depressive symptoms, and if educational attainment modified the association between obesity and 
depression. There was a trend for increased weight status to be associated with higher depressive 
symptoms (obese II/III, OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03–2.41), whereas higher education was associated 
with lower odds of depressive symptoms, in an adjusted model including BMI (more than 12 but 
less than 16 years, OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49–0.98; 16 or more years of education, OR 0.61, 95% CI 
0.40–0.93). The association of being obese I with depressive symptoms was different for more 
educated (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.27–3.62) compared to less educated women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 
0.50–1.62); the sample was larger for the more educated women and reached statistical

 significance. There were no differences in the association for obese II/III women in strata of 
education. There was evidence of risk-difference heterogeneity (0.88, 95% CI 0.84–0.93). In this 
population-based sample of women in western New York State, increased weight was negligibly 
associated with depressive symptoms. The association of being obese I with depressive symptoms 
was different for more compared to less educated women.

Introduction
An association between mental health and obesity is well established [1,2,3,4], as is the 
positive association between obesity and depression [4]. There is evidence that obesity and 
depression are comorbid [1], however, much less is known about the biopsychosocial 
variables associated with this relationship [5]. Recently, it was found that somatic, but not 
cognitive-affective, symptoms of depression are positively associated with body mass index 
(BMI) [6]. Additionally, in a meta-analysis, there was evidence of a bidirectional association 
between depression and metabolic syndrome [7], a cluster of several risk factors including 
central obesity, as well as hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, and 
decreased HDL cholesterol [8].
In contrast to the association with obesity, there is less consistency with regard to evidence 
linking BMI and depression more generally. In recent studies there was evidence of an 
association between BMI and increased risk of depression [9,10], whereas in others, the 
association was limited to those with severe obesity (measured as a BMI >35 – ≤39.9 or 
>39.9) [11,12]. The implication of this and related research is that more studies are needed 
to isolate the mechanisms by which BMI and depression could be related.
One likely mechanism linking BMI and depression is educational attainment. There are 
numerous studies that have documented lower levels of depression among adults with higher 
education [13,14], yet, less is known about how education modifies the association between 
obesity and depression. A better understanding of the impact of education on increased 
weight status and depressive symptoms will provide much needed insight into the complex, 
comorbid relationship between obesity and depression. Therefore, in the present analysis, 
we examined the association between body weight and depressive symptoms in a sample of 
adult women in the Buffalo-Niagara region assessed between 1997 and 2001. We 
hypothesized, a priori, that increased weight status beyond normal weight would be 
associated with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, and that educational attainment 
would modify any observed positive association between increased weight and depressive 
symptoms.
The possibility that educational attainment can offset undesired effects of overweight and 
obesity has important implications for understanding the association between body weight 
and depression. For example, higher educational attainment has been shown to have a 
protective effect on depressive symptoms [15], and this may result in lowered obesity risk

 due to the high correlation between obesity and depression [1]. Further, research indicates 
that those with lower levels of education are more likely to experience both obesity and 
depression [16]. Taken together, disparate levels of education may differentially influence 
the effect of increased body weight on depression.
Methods
Study Population
Healthy women, aged 35 to 80 were randomly selected from the general population in Erie 
and Niagara counties in western New York State between 1997 and 2001 as controls for a 
case-control study of breast cancer. Study population controls aged 35–64 years were 
randomly selected from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles records.1 
Controls aged 65–80 were randomly selected from the Health Care Finance Association 
data. We assigned a computer-generated random number to each person on the complete 
lists of all potential participants supplied by the New York State Department of Motor 
Vehicles and the Health Care Finance Association. The potential participants were then 
sorted by their randomly assigned ascending numbers and contacted in sequential order. 
Introductory letters were mailed to potential interviewees prior to interviewers' telephone 
calls, and up to 12 callbacks were completed.
We interviewed 41.5 percent of the controls that were contacted. Trained interviewers 
conducted standardized, in-person interviews. The detailed interview included questions 
dealing with demographic traits, reproductive and menstrual history, occupational history, 
disease history, smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, medications, diet, and 
several aspects of alcohol consumption throughout the lifetime. Of the original sample 
(n=2,115), we excluded those who had missing or questionable data (e.g., if the response 
given was implausible and did not fall within the appropriate scale range or data entry error) 
on BMI (n=72) or CES-D depression scores (n=115), resulting in a sample of 1,928 women 
for analysis. The University at Buffalo Health Sciences institutional review board approved 
the study, and all participants provided written informed consent.
CES-D Questionnaire
All participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 
questionnaire CES-D [15], a tool designed to measure depression status among the general 
population. The items in this scale primarily measure affective and somatic aspects of 
depression during the previous week through a self-reported measure. Each question is 
scored from 0 to 3, based on participant responses, resulting in a possible score of 0 to 60, 
with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The subject is considered 
depressed if his or her score is 16 or higher. The CES-D has been evaluated extensively for 
both validity and reliability [17,18,19,20].

 Body Mass Index
Physical measurements were made by trained interviewers using a standardized protocol 
which included height and weight. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. BMI 
categories were created using the 2000 Center for Disease Control Growth Charts: United 
States [21,22]. Standard weight status categories associated with BMI were used: 
underweight (<18.5), normal-weight (18.5 – ≤24.9), overweight (>25 – ≥29.9), obese I (>30 
– ≤34.9), obese II (>35 – ≤39.9), or obese III (>39.9) [21,22]. The classifications of Obese I 
(low-risk), Obese II (moderate-risk), or Obese III (high-risk) is related to the likelihood of 
developing obesity–related health problems [21,22]. Following classification of participants 
into these six weight categories, we excluded women in the underweight category (n = 18) 
and combined obese II and obese III categories, due to the association between being 
underweight and depressive symptoms [9] and the small number of cases in the obese III 
category (n = 92).
Measurement of Other Relevant Covariates
In self-administered and interviewer-administered questionnaires, data were collected 
regarding demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics. We examined age as a 
continuous measure, race as a dichotomous measure, white and other race, with white as the 
reference, education was a self-reported categorical measure, and classified as less than 
twelve years, equal to twelve years, greater than twelve years but less than sixteen years, 
greater than or equal to sixteen years, with twelve years as the reference, income was a 
categorical measure, categorized as less than $20,000, greater than or equal to $20 and less 
than $40,000, greater than or equal to $40,000 and less than $60,000, and greater than or 
equal to $60,000, with less than $20,000 as the reference, marital status was a dichotomous 
measure, married or not married at time of assessment, with not married as the reference, 
smoking status was a categorical measure, current smoker, former smoker, or non-smoker, 
with non-smoker as the reference, caloric intake was a categorical measure, representing 
whether the participant consumed less than, equal to, or more than the recommended 2,000 
calories per day, with less than 2,000 calorie per day as the reference,2 sleep was a 
categorical measure, representing whether the participant averages less than eight hours of 
sleep per night or the recommended eight or more hours [23], with less than eight as the 
reference, and physical activity was a categorical measure calculated from self-reported 
lifetime physical activity, categorized as less than three hours per week, three to six hours 
per week, or greater than six hours per week, with less than three hours as the reference. We 
included these potential cofounders given the widely recognized and established 
involvement of these factors in both obesity and depressive symptoms [23, 24].
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were completed using Stata 13.0. We compared characteristics of depressed and 
non-depressed women using Student’s t test and χ2 tests to examine the differences between 
measurements of non-depressed and depressed women for continuous and categorical 
variables, respectively. Spearman correlation coefficients were estimated to examine linear

 association between continuous measures of CES-D, BMI, and education. We examined the 
association of BMI and depression (CES-D scores <16, non-depressed and ≥16, depressed) 
using logistic regression models. We further examined the association in strata of education. 
We also examined the interaction of BMI and education with depressive symptoms by 
adding a multiplicative term to the full model. We assessed significance where any p value 
below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1, including 
frequencies and percentages of non-depressed and depressed participants. BMI was 
significantly different for those who reported being depressed compared to those who were 
not depressed. Depressed women were more likely to be obese (p<0.01). Depressed women 
were more often older, not married, less educated, lower income, a former- or current-
smoker, less physically active, consumed more calories, and averaged less than 8 hours of 
sleep.
Spearman correlations of depression with BMI and years of education were calculated. The 
resulting rank-order correlation for BMI suggested a negligible association between 
increased weight and depression scores (r=0.12, p<0.001). There was a weak inverse 
relationship between depression and education (r = −0.21, p<0.001). Education and BMI 
were also weakly inversely correlated (r = −0.17, p<0.001).
As shown in Table 2, the estimated odds of depressive symptoms are significantly higher for 
women classified as obese I (OR=1.57, 95% CI 1.11–2.22) and obese II/ III (OR=1.88, 95% 
CI 1.29–2.76): Model 1). Severe obesity was also significantly associated with depressive 
symptoms, adjusting for other potential cofounders (Model 2). Obese I women’s odds of 
depressive symptoms was 43% higher than normal-weight women (OR=1.43, 95% CI 0.97–
2.11), and obese II/ III women’s was approximately 57% higher (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.03–
2.41) compared to women classified as normal-weight, after controlling for cofounders.
The association of BMI and depressive symptoms by educational attainment is shown in 
Table 2 (Model 3). Among women with > 12 years education, women classified as obese I 
had significantly higher odds of depressive symptoms, double that of normal-weight women 
with equal education (adjusted OR= 2.15, 95% CI 1.27–3.62). Among those women with ≤ 
12 years of education, the point estimate was quite different (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.50–1.62) 
but the sample was smaller and the confidence interval included the null. For the obese II/ III 
group, there were no differences in the association in the strata of education (Model 4).
To verify that the observed association between higher educated, obese I women and higher 
depressive symptoms is not due to the distribution of BMI in the education group, we ran the 
analysis by degree attainment (i.e., < 12 years, > 12 years, and >16 years of education). We 
confirmed that the association between weight status and depressive symptoms remained 
significant among women classified as obese I who obtained a Bachelor’s degree (results 
available upon request). We found that Obese I women who graduated from college had 
significantly higher odds of depressive symptoms, again nearly double that of normal-weight

 women with equivalent educational attainment (adjusted OR=2.82, 95% CI 0.99–8.08). In 
our final model, we examined the interaction of BMI and education with depressive 
symptoms by adding a multiplicative term to the full model. We found a statistically 
insignificant interaction on the odds ratio scale (1.03, 95%CI 0.99–1.08). We then tested the 
joint effect for education and BMI with depressive symptoms on the additive scale and 
found evidence of risk-difference heterogeneity (0.88, 95% CI 0.84–0.93).
Discussion
We examined the association of BMI with depressive symptoms, and whether educational 
attainment modifies that association in a population-based cross-sectional study of healthy 
adult women in Western New York. Our resulting rank-order correlation between increased 
weight and depression scores suggested a statistically significant, yet negligible positive 
association in our sample. Although BMI and depression were negligibly correlated as 
compared to prior reports [4] one likely reason for this discrepancy in findings is that the 
CES-D measures affective and somatic aspects of depression, and prior research has shown 
that it is the somatic, but not cognitive-affective, symptoms of depression that are positively 
associated with BMI [6], therefore potentially diluting the effect.
Findings support our a priori hypothesis that increased weight status is associated with 
higher depressive symptoms, as previously shown [9,10]. We further observed an inverse 
relationship between depression and education. This finding is in line with the existing 
literature that shows depression levels among women fall more sharply as education 
increases [24,25]. Here we show that the association of obese I category with depressive 
symptoms was different in groups of women defined by their education. Our results indicate 
that among obese I women of higher educational attainment, there is an increased risk of 
depressive symptoms compared to normal weight women with equal education. 
Consequently, education modifies the association between weight status and depressive 
symptoms for women classified as obese I, but not in the expected direction.
Previous studies show that obese women of lower education are more likely to exhibit 
depressive symptoms relative to normal weight women with comparable levels of education 
[26]. In our sample, obesity is a significant risk factor for depression among women 
classified as obese I with higher educational attainment. This contradictory finding may 
reflect growing evidence from varied methodological approaches that show individuals with 
higher educational attainment have an increased risk of comorbid depressive symptoms and 
obesity, compared to those with less education [27,28,29,30, 31]. On the other hand, there is 
evidence that because people with lower education have fewer economic and social 
resources to successfully cope with mental health issues, they are therefore more likely to 
suffer from depression and obesity [33]. For example, a study of randomly selected U.S. 
adults suggested that lower education may increase the risk of comorbid obesity and 
depression [34]. The reason for this difference is not known. More research is needed to test 
this finding further. Our findings contribute to this debate by showing that obese I women of 
higher educational attainment have increased risk of depressive symptoms relative to normal 
weight women of equal education.

 Recent research indicates that women have significantly more chronic difficulties and face 
more cumulative disadvantage compared to men [35]. Our study provides evidence that in 
the examination of ongoing strain and cumulative stressors leading to depressive symptoms 
in women’s lives, considering weight status and other factors concurrently may be 
informative. This connection is particularly relevant for practitioners when developing 
treatments for depression and treatments for obesity, as greater educational attainment 
should be considered independent of the association between obesity and depression. A 
major strength of our study lies in our study population, a large population-based sample of 
healthy adult women that included a detailed description of lifestyle history characteristics. 
Standardized anthropometric measures, and the use of the validated CES-D questionnaire to 
assess depressive symptoms, add credence to the present analysis. We also had the ability to 
adjust for a number of factors that are known to influence weight status.
In assessing these findings, there are several study limitations that need to be considered. 
The cross-sectional design is a limitation to our analysis, as this is a design that allows for 
determination of associations but does not allow for determination of temporality and 
causality. We do not know whether obesity precedes the depression or was a result of the 
depression. In fact, there is reason to believe that the relationship is bi-directional, and that 
both factors affect each other [5,23]. Additionally, given the likelihood that depressive 
symptoms and weight status fluctuate, a single measure may not be indicative of the average 
state of the study participants. As such, longitudinal analyses testing would prove useful.
Another limitation in the generalizability of the findings is the small number of racial and 
ethnic minority group members in the study sample, particularly because there is evidence 
that racial-ethnic disparities exist in health behaviors [36]. Additionally, we analyzed 
overweight and obesity as a discrete consequence of depression although it is likely that 
higher weight status can lead to depression or anxiety disorder or social phobia. Thus, such 
disparate outcomes may prove more useful if compiled into a single summary measure of 
poor health rather than focusing on one outcome, such as depressive symptoms. Further, 
while the study participants were selected as representative of healthy individuals in the 
population, BMI may be a function of underlying disease that was not measured. We were 
limited in our ability to examine effect modification by education by the available study 
sample. While the categories of education that we examined are those most frequently used 
in the literature, an analysis looking at smaller gradations of education may provide 
additional insight.
Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, no study has used a large, population-based 
sample to study the association between depression, weight status, and education level. By 
studying this association in healthy women without other chronic diseases or disorders, we 
are better able to understand the associations between depression, increased weight status, 
and the impact of educational attainment.

Normal-weight, Overweight, Obese I, Obese II / III are categorical variables representing body mass index category. In Model 2 Education is a categorical variable representing highest years of education at 
assessment, included as < 12 years, = 12 years, ≥12 years but <16 years, and ≥ 16 years. In Models 3 and 4 the categorical measure of education just described was removed and models are stratified by ≤12 
years and > 12 years of education. Models 2–4 are adjusted for age, race, marital status, income, smoking status, physical activity, average calories consumed, and average number of hours of sleep per 
night.
Sources: Data are for women in the Erie and Niagra Counties, Western NY 1997 – 2001.
Notes: Dependent Variable is depressive symptoms (<16, non-depressed and ≥16, depressed).
*p < 0.05,
**p < 0.005,
