abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of corporal punishment is high in the United States 
despite a 1998 American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement urging against its use. The 
current study tests whether the socioeconomic difference in its use by parents has changed 
over the past quarter century. It goes on to test whether socioeconomic differences in the 
use of nonphysical discipline have also changed over time.
METHODS: Data are drawn from 4 national studies conducted between 1988 and 2011. Each 
asked how often a kindergarten-aged child was spanked in the past week and what the 
parents would do if the child misbehaved, with physical discipline, time-out, and talking 
to child as possible responses. We use regression models to estimate parents’
 responses 
to these questions at the 90th, 50th, and 10th percentiles of the income and education 
distributions and t tests to compare estimates across cohorts.
RESULTS: The proportion of mothers at the 50th income-percentile who endorse physical 
discipline decreased from 46% to 21% over time. Gaps between the 90th and 10th income-
percentiles were stable at 11 and 18 percentage points in 1988 and 2011. The percentage 
of mothers at the 10th income-percentile endorsing time-outs increased from 51% to 71%, 
and the 90/10 income gap decreased from 23 to 14 percentage points between 1998 and 
2011.
CONCLUSIONS: Decline in popular support for physical discipline reflects real changes in 
parents’
 discipline strategies. These changes have occurred at all socioeconomic levels, 
producing for some behaviors a significant reduction in socioeconomic differences.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Discipline 
strategies differ by family background such that 
parents with lower education and income levels 
spank and use other forms of corporal punishment 
more often, and use nonpunitive forms of discipline 
less often, than parents of higher socioeconomic 
status.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Using data from 4 large 
nationally representative studies, this study 
examines whether the documented decline in 
parents’ use of physical discipline and increase in 
use of nonphysical discipline since the 1980s has 
narrowed or widened socioeconomic differences in 
discipline strategies.

Numerous studies find that 
socioeconomically advantaged and 
disadvantaged parents differ on 
average in the quality and quantity of 
their interactions with children. 
1 This 
socioeconomic “parenting gap” stems 
from many factors including but not 
limited to the economic hardship, 
emotional stress, and lower access to 
information and services that often 
accompany low income. This gap in 
turn may account for a substantial 
portion of the socioeconomic gap in 
children’
s kindergarten readiness. 
2 
Although many studies examine the 
parenting gap and its implications, 
few examine how that gap may have 
changed over time. Studies that 
have examined changes over time 
focus on parents’
 engagement in 
cognitively stimulating activities 
3, 
 
4 
even though the quality of parents’
 
socioemotional interactions with 
children also meaningfully shape 
early development.5, 
 
6 Therefore, the 
current study investigates changes 
over time in the socioemotional 
parenting gap.
Discipline strategies represent a 
central component of socioemotional 
interactions. Corporal punishment 
includes discipline strategies such as 
spanking, hitting with objects, and 
other actions that intentionally cause 
physical pain. Nonphysical discipline 
strategies include “time-out” and 
explanations for desirable behaviors. 
There is evidence that use of these 
discipline strategies differs by family 
background. Specifically, parents 
with lower socioeconomic status 
(SES) spank and use other forms of 
corporal punishment more often than 
higher SES parents, 
 
7, 
 
8 whereas higher 
SES families are more likely than 
their lower SES counterparts to use 
nonphysical discipline strategies that 
include reasoning and promote child 
autonomy. 
9 A recent meta-analysis 
of 2 decades of research identified 
significant associations, albeit 
correlational ones, between corporal 
punishment and a range of negative 
socioemotional outcomes. 
10 A related 
literature finds that differences in 
parents’
 socioemotional interactions 
explain a meaningful proportion of 
SES-based differences in children’
s 
outcomes.2, 
 
11, 
 
12
It is possible, however, that this 
parenting gap in discipline strategies 
has changed over time. Over the 
past 30 years, public support for 
corporal punishment has declined 
sharply, both in terms of attitudes 
toward 
13, 
 
14 and parents’
 actual use 
of physical discipline. 
15 This cultural 
shift may have affected lower SES 
parents more than higher SES 
parents because their initial rates of 
corporal punishment were higher. If 
so, the SES gap in the use of corporal 
punishment would have declined 
over time. It is alternatively possible 
that economically advantaged 
parents responded more quickly to 
this trend than lower SES parents, 
thus widening the parenting gap; for 
example, less educated mothers were 
slower to curb prenatal smoking 
after the release of the Surgeon 
General’
s Report of 1960 outlining 
its health hazards, suggesting that 
economically advantaged parents 
generally respond more quickly 
to parenting information. 
16 No 
research has directly examined 
changes in the popularity or use of 
nonphysical discipline strategies, 
but it is reasonable to hypothesize 
that a decline in the use of physical 
discipline would be linked to 
an increase in the use of their 
alternative. If so, SES-based gaps 
in strategies that use nonphysical 
discipline techniques such as time-
out may also have decreased as lower 
SES parents began using them more 
often, or increased as higher SES 
parents adopted them more readily.
The current study estimates SES-
based differences in the reported 
endorsement and use of physical 
and nonphysical discipline strategies 
from 1988 through 2011. This time 
period coincides with the decline 
in popular support for corporal 
punishment, but it is also of interest 
because in 1998 the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released 
a policy statement urging parents 
against using corporal punishment 
and encouraging their use of 
nonphysical strategies such as time-
out, 
17 citing scientific consensus from 
a 1996 AAP conference on corporal 
punishment. 
18 Our data cannot 
identify the causal impact of the AAP 
statement on discipline practices, 
but no other study has compared, 
even descriptively, parents’
 discipline 
strategies, and the SES-based 
differences in strategies before and 
after 1998. Specifically, the study 
examines whether (1) endorsement 
and use of corporal punishment 
(hitting and spanking) declined for 
parents across levels of SES between 
1988 and 2011, (2) endorsement of 
nonphysical (time-outs/sending to 
room and talking to child) discipline 
increased over the same time period, 
and (3) SES-based differences in the 
reported endorsement and use of 
these strategies changed over time. 
We examine these trends in parents 
of kindergarten-age children because 
age 5, the typical age of kindergarten 
entry, is among the most common 
ages for parents to use spanking.

METHODS
Data
Data were drawn from 4 nationally 
representative studies conducted 
over a 23-year period: the National 
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 
1979—1988/1990 Maternal and 
Child Supplement (NLSY), the Panel 
Study of Income Dynamics—1997 
Child Development Supplement 
(PSID), the Early Childhood 
Longitudinal Study—1998/1999 
Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), and 
the Early Childhood Longitudinal 
Study—2010/2011 Kindergarten 
Cohort (ECLS- 
K: 
2011). To ensure 
children’
s ages were maximally 
similar across data sets, within the 
NLSY and PSID, analytic samples 
were limited to families with children

5- to 7-years-old; within the ECLS-Ks, 
children repeating kindergarten 
(and children not living with their 
mothers/female guardians) were 
excluded. Within these eligible 
samples, >90% of families in each 
data set had valid data on household 
income and maternal education 
(N = 2354 in the NLSY; N = 765 in the 
PSID; N = 15 300 in the ECLS-K; 
N = 12 000 in the ECLS- 
K: 
2011).
The NLSY is representative of the 
entire population of youth aged 14 
to 21 in the United States in 1979. 
Beginning in 1986, the NLSY began 
collecting information biennially 
on the biological children of the 
female NLSY respondents. We use 
data from the 1988 or 1990 waves 
of data collection, which provides 
our earliest data point (data from 
1988 were used if data were missing 
in 1990). The PSID is a household 
panel study that constitutes a 
nationally representative sample 
of US families in 1968. In 1997, the 
PSID supplemented its main data 
with additional information on 0- 
to 12-year-old children and their 
parents (PSID-CDS). The ECLS-K and 
ECLS- 
K: 
2011 collected information 
from a nationally representative 
sample of kindergartners and their 
parents across the United States 
in 1998 and 2011, respectively, 
providing our most recent data 
points. Statistics describing 
each sample’
s child and family 
characteristics are reported in  
Table 1. 
Overall, differences in income and 
education level across data sets 
reflect national trends. The exception 
is the 1988/1990 NLSY, in which 
mothers have lower education 
levels than in any other study likely 
because women of the NLSY who 
were mothers by those waves were 
comparatively young.
Each study asked mothers 2 
questions, worded analogously, that 
were used to create 4 measures of 
parental discipline. First, mothers 
were asked in all studies, “If your 
child got so angry he/she hit you, 
what would you do?” (in the PSID, 
if the child was 6 years old or older, 
the question was phrased: “Most 
children get so angry at their parents 
that they say things like ‘I hate you’
 
or swear in a temper tantrum”). 
Responses included “hit back, 
” 
“spank, 
” “send to room, 
” “have him/
her take a time out, 
” or “talk to, 
” and 
mothers could endorse multiple 
responses. If mother responded they 
would “hit back” and/or “spank, 
” they 
were considered to endorse physical 
discipline; if they responded that they 
would “send to room/give time out, 
” 
they endorsed nonphysical discipline; 
and if they said they would “talk to” 
the child, they endorsed talking. In 
the ECLS-Ks, this response more 
explicitly reflects reasoning than in 
the NLSY or PSID, as the response 
reads, “talk to [him/her] about what 
he/she did wrong.” Parents in all 
studies were also asked: “About how 
many times in the past week have 
you spanked your child?” Mothers 
were coded “1” for spanking if they 
reported spanking their child at all in 
the past week.
All studies contain 2 measures of 
socioeconomic status, household 
income and parental education. The 
NLSY collected information about 
income from different sources, 
including transfers from both 
governmental and nongovernmental 
sources. The PSID gathered a high-
quality edited measure of total 
family income, which includes 
taxable income and cash transfers 
to all household members. For both 
studies, income measures were 
computed as the household income 
averaged across the survey year 
(1988 or 1990 in the NLSY) and the 
years just before and after the survey 
year. The ECLS-Ks asked parents 
what their yearly household income 
was; in 1998 this was measured 
continuously, and in 2011, responses 
fell within 18 specific income ranges. 
These ranges began at ≤$5000 at the

lower end and ended with ≥$200 001 
at the top. Our measure of parental 
education in the NLSY, PSID, and 
ECLS-Ks come from mothers’
 reports 
of their total years of education 
and degrees attained from the year 
in which the parenting data were 
drawn. The maximum years of 
education in the NLSY were 20. The 
maximum years of education in the 
PSID were 17, which represented 
all education beyond college. In the 
ECLS-Ks, education was measured 
categorically with the highest level 
of education being doctorate/
professional degree.
Analytic Strategy
To assess changes in SES-based 
gaps in parents’
 discipline 
strategies over time, we compared 
the percentage of mothers 
endorsing each discipline strategy 
within and across cohorts at 
different points in the income and 
education distributions. Generating 
these estimated percentages 
required 3 analytic steps. First, 
because income and education 
were measured categorically in 
some studies, we could not identify 
children’
s exact percentile in the 
income (or education) distribution. 
So we converted the continuous 
income (and education) data into 
uniform, ordinal categories: 10 
(and 7) in the NLSY, 7 (and 6) in the 
PSID, 15 (and 9) in the ECLS-K, and 
18 (and 9) in the ECLS- 
K: 
2011.
Second, we estimated the average 
endorsement of each parental 
activity in each income (and 
education) category. To do so, 
we ran a weighted least squares 
regression of each parenting 
item in each dataset, separately 
for each income (and education) 
category, using the appropriate 
sample weights for the study 
and appropriately clustered 
standard errors to account for 
nonindependent observations, 
with child age held constant at 
6 years. The intercept from this 
model yielded an estimate of the 
probability of endorsing each 
parenting behavior within each 
income category for each study. 
Third, we regressed these estimated 
probabilities on a linear, quadratic, 
and cubic measure of income (and 
education) to allow for nonlinear 
relationships between SES and 
discipline strategies. For a full 
description of this method, see 
Reardon. 
19
The linear, quadratic, and cubic 
coefficients for income (and 
education) generated in this 
regression were used to estimate 
parenting behavior at the 90th, 
50th, and 10th percentiles of 
household income (and education) 
distribution for each study. We 
then estimated the 90/10 income 
parenting gap by differencing the 
proportion of parents endorsing 
a behavior at the 90th and 10th 
percentiles of household income for 
each parenting item. 
19 Specifically, 
we calculated the 90/10 income-
parenting gap as:

parenting (and education-parenting) 
gaps. We repeated this process for 
each parenting item separately in 
each study. We formally tested for 
differences over time using a t test 
of the significant difference between 
any 2 data points, Bonferroni-
adjusted for the 36 multiple 
comparisons tested (9 contrasts per 
4 outcomes).
RESULTS
Endorsement of Physical Discipline/
Spanking
Over the entire period, the 
percentage of mothers endorsing 
physical discipline declined 
significantly (see  
Table 2). 
Specifically, the percentage reporting 
that they would hit or spank their 
kindergarten-age child in response 
to a child’
s misbehavior declined by 
20 to 26 percentage points across 
income levels between 1988 and 
2011. This shift occurred exclusively 
in the earlier period, between 1988 
and 1997. Likewise, the percentage of 
mothers reporting that they spanked 
their child in the past week declined 
by 26 to 40 percentage points, with 
significant declines in both the early 
and later periods.
These declines emerged at all income 
levels (see  
Table 2). As a result, 
income-related gaps in the rates of 
endorsing physical discipline and 
spanking were stable (see  
Table 3). 
For instance, in 2011, mothers at 
the 90th income percentile were 
18 percentage points less likely to 
report that they would physically 
punish their child in response to 
misbehavior than those in the 10th 
percentile, and 12 percentage points 
less likely to report spanking their 
child in the past week. These 90/10 
gaps were 11 and 16 percentage 
points in 1988, not significantly 
different from those in 2011 (see 
 
Fig 1). Only results for income levels 
are detailed because results for the 
90th, 50th, and 10th education levels 
were quite similar (see Supplemental 
Table 4 and 5). Thus, despite declines 
across SES in the endorsement and 
report of physical punishment, 
substantial SES-based gaps still 
existed in 2011.
Endorsement of Nonphysical 
Discipline
Whereas rates of endorsing physical 
discipline decreased, the percentage 
of mothers endorsing nonphysical

discipline strategies increased over 
time ( 
Table 2). Specifically, the 
percentage of mothers reporting that 
they would give their child a time-
out or send them to their rooms in 
response to misbehavior increased 
by 26 to 40 percentage points across 
income levels between 1988 and 
2011, with significant increases 
in both early and later periods. 
Likewise, the percentage of mothers 
who said they would talk to their 
child increased significantly, albeit 
to a lesser degree (between 4 and 14 
percentage points) and mostly in the 
later period. This smaller increase 
is likely attributable to higher base 
rates of endorsement of talking to 
children in 1988, which ranged from 
71 to 83%.
Although mothers across the 
income distribution increased 
their endorsement of nonphysical 
discipline, income-based gaps in this 
measure grew between 1988 and 
2011 ( 
Table 3). For example, the 
90/10 gap equaled 14 percentage 
points in 2011, up from 5 percentage 
points in 1988; however, the gap 
narrowed between 1998 and 2011, 
suggesting a possible reversal of 
this trend (see  
Fig 2). Moreover, 
the income-based gaps in talking to 
children in response to misbehavior 
decreased such that by 2011 no 
significant income-based gaps 
existed. Results for the 90th, 50th, 
and 10th education levels were 
similar (see Supplemental Table 4 
and 5).
DISCUSSION
The 1998 AAP policy statement 
urged parents against the use of 
corporal punishment and encouraged 
the use of nonphysical discipline 
strategies such as time-outs. 
16 At the 
time, popular support for physical 
discipline was in decline, and the 
popularity of nonphysical discipline 
strategies, such as time-outs, was 
rising. 
13, 
 
14 The current study suggests 
that these cultural shifts reflect

real changes in the way parents 
discipline children. Our results also 
show changes in discipline strategies 
before and after 1998, suggesting the 
AAP statement reflected and possibly 
catalyzed these shifts. Most notably, 
these changes have occurred at all 
socioeconomic levels, producing a 
significant reduction in SES-based 
differences for some discipline 
strategies.
By 2011, a minority of parents at 
all income and education levels 
endorsed physically disciplining a 
child in response to misbehavior 
and an even smaller minority 
reported using this strategy in the 
past week. By contrast, the vast 
majority of parents by that time, 
at all income and education levels, 
endorsed nonphysical discipline or 
talking with children. The decrease 
in corporal punishment, and 
increase in alternative strategies, 
was roughly equal across the 
SES distribution over the entire 
period for all behaviors except 
talking to children, for which the 
bottom 10th percentile increased 
their endorsement more than the 
middle or top of the income (and 
education) distribution, effectively 
closing the SES-based gap in talking 
as a response to misbehavior. The 
proportion of mothers endorsing 
physical discipline was lower in 
this study than in the 1986 - 2014 
General Social Survey, 
 
20 likely 
because it asks about parenting 
attitudes in broad circumstances—
do you agree that “it is sometimes 
necessary to give a child a good, 
hard spanking”—whereas our study 
asks about parents’
 behavior in 
specific circumstances. 
14 However, 
in both our study and the General 
Social Survey, endorsement of 
physical discipline declined over the 
period.
The data have limitations to consider 
before drawing firm conclusions. 
First, the 1988/1990 NLSY sample is 
relatively disadvantaged, a bias that

may lead to an underestimate of the 
SES-based gaps in the endorsement 
of corporal punishment because the 
income distribution is truncated. 
Second, the PSID sample is relatively 
small, resulting in less precise 
estimates for 1997. These issues 
may explain why SES-based gaps 
in physical discipline and spanking 
appear to increase between 1988 
and 1997 and then decline almost 
as much between 1997 and 2011. 
Additionally, the response category 
of “talk to child” has a potentially 
ambiguous meaning. Parents were 
not asked to specify what they said 
to children, so it is possible their 
“talk” did not involve reasoning. 
Additionally, because these data are 
self-reported, parents’
 responses 
may reflect desirability bias rather 
than actual behaviors. If so, changes 
over time may reflect changes in 
cultural norms around discipline but 
not changes in parenting practices. 
However, official maltreatment 
reporting in the United States 
indicates a 55% decline in physical 
abuse since 1990, 
 
21 suggesting 
the changes in physical discipline 
endorsement reported here reflect 
changes in actual behavior. Finally, 
fathers are more likely to endorse 
corporal punishment than mothers, 
 
14 
thus our estimates of SES-based gaps 
in mothers’
 discipline strategies may 
not apply to them.
CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest parents’
 use of 
corporal punishment has declined 
substantially over the past quarter 
century, whereas the use of 
nonphysical discipline has increased, 
with SES-based gaps in the latter 
narrowing in recent years. Despite 
these positive trends, it is important 
to note that nearly one-third of 
mothers at the bottom of the income 
distribution still endorse physically 
disciplining kindergarten-age 
children, and nearly one-quarter 
report doing so in the past week.

These rates are alarmingly high when 
considering the potential for corporal 
punishment to escalate into abuse

23 
and links—albeit correlational—
between corporal punishment 
and negative child socioemotional 
outcomes. 
10 Strategies to further 
reduce reliance on corporal 
punishment in lower SES families 
could include encouraging the use 
of nonphysical approaches such as 
time-out, positive reinforcement, 
and selective inattention in home 
visiting programs, as well as raising 
public awareness about the negative 
effects, and relative ineffectiveness, of 
physical discipline.
