Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of
blindness in developed nations. AMD is characterized by retinal
pigmented epithelial (RPE) cell dysfunction and loss of photore-
ceptor cells. Epidemiologic studies indicate important contribu-
tions of dietary patterns to the risk for AMD, but the mechanisms
relating diet to disease remain unclear. Here we investigate the
effect on AMD of isocaloric diets that differ only in the type of
dietary carbohydrate in a wild-type aged-mouse model. The con-
sumption of a high-glycemia (HG) diet resulted in many AMD
features (AMDf), including RPE hypopigmentation and atrophy, lip-
ofuscin accumulation, and photoreceptor degeneration, whereas
consumption of the lower-glycemia (LG) diet did not. Critically,
switching from the HG to the LG diet late in life arrested or reversed
AMDf. LG diets limited the accumulation of advanced glycation end
products, long-chain polyunsaturated lipids, and their peroxidation
end-products and increased C3-carnitine in retina, plasma, or urine.
Untargeted metabolomics revealed microbial cometabolites, partic-
ularly serotonin, as protective against AMDf. Gut microbiota were
responsive to diet, and we identified microbiota in the Clostridiales
order as being associated with AMDf and the HG diet, whereas
protection from AMDf was associated with the Bacteroidales order
and the LG diet. Network analysis revealed a nexus of metabolites
and microbiota that appear to act within a gut–retina axis to protect
against diet- and age-induced AMDf. The findings indicate a func-
tional interaction between dietary carbohydrates, the metabolome,
including microbial cometabolites, and AMDf. Our studies suggest
a simple dietary intervention that may be useful in patients to
arrest AMD.
age-related macular degeneration | glycemic index | advanced glycation

A
ge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of
irremediable blindness in the industrialized world, with 200 mil-
lion cases projected by 2020, at a cost of $300 billion (1, 2). Dry AMD
accounts for the great majority of cases and is associated with pho-
toreceptor cell loss, often preceded by compromise to the retina
pigment epithelium (RPE) cells that nourish and remove waste from
the photoreceptors. The etiology of AMD remains an enigma but is
clearly multifactorial. Stresses associated with AMD include envi-
ronment, age, and genetics (3). Frustratingly, there are no early
biomarkers to anticipate AMD, and there are no therapies or cure.
Recently, we and others observed in epidemiologic studies that,
in addition to micronutrients (4–6), macronutrient quality [e.g.,
consuming a diet with a high glycemic index (GI)] is a significant
risk factor for AMD onset and/or progress in nondiabetic humans
(7–9). The GI appears to be an attractive dietary intervention
target, because simple replacement of small amounts of high-index
foods (such as white bread) with lower-index foods (such as whole-
grain bread) can significantly reduce glycemic peaks without re-
quiring a change in overall dietary patterns (7). However, human
tests to show that these epidemiologic data should be translated
into clinical practice or exploited to arrest or reverse AMD await
more information about and better understanding of the relation-
ship between AMD and the dietary GI. Henceforth, to emphasize
the role of carbohydrates in physiologic responses, we use the term
“glycemia.” Americans consume high-glycemia diets, as reflected in
the obesity epidemic in this country.
Two publications indicate models in wild-type mice demonstrat-
ing that the consumption of lower-glycemia diets is associated with
delayed age-related features of AMD (AMDf), but an ability to
arrest incipient disease was not an objective of these studies, nor
were metabolic alterations that explain the glycemia-AMD relations
Significance
Food is medicine, and diet impacts the risk for and progression of
age-related macular degeneration AMD, but we have few clues
as to why. We found that wild-type mice fed a high-glycemic-
index diet similar in composition to the Western diet developed a
disease state that resembles dry AMD. To gain insight into the
mechanism, we used LC-MS– and NMR-based metabolomics to
discover diet-, metabolic-, and AMD-associated phenotypes. These
studies revealed changes in the gut microbiota that altered the
production of metabolites that protected against AMD, in-
cluding serotonin. Changing the diet to a low-glycemic-index
diet, even late in life, arrested the development of AMD, offer-
ing dietary interventions for AMD.

 indicated. Increased levels of advanced glycation end products
(AGEs), i.e., covalent posttranslational oxidative and nonoxidative
modifications of proteins by sugar-derived metabolites, were ob-
served in the mice fed a high-glycemia (HG) diet (hereafter, “HG
mice”) (10, 11). AGEs are cytotoxic (12), and this cytotoxicity is
corroborated by the accumulation of AGEs in AMD. Several other
age-related diseases, namely diabetes, cardiovascular, neurodegen-
erative, and inflammatory disease (13), are also associated with ac-
cumulation of AGEs, although the diseases are rarely coincident,
implying that each has a unique etiology or combinations of etiolo-
gies. In this work, we focus on AMDf. We hypothesized that con-
suming a low-glycemia (LG) diet could be used not only to delay the
onset and progress of AMDf but also to arrest AMD if animals were
switched from an HG to an LG diet. Further, these salutary effects
would involve altered metabolism, perhaps also including the
microbiome. Additionally, such metabolomic investigation would
lead to biomarkers. Having biomarkers and models in which AMDf
development and progression can be monitored would facilitate
diagnosis and prognosis as well as further understanding of diet–
AMD pathomechanistic etiologies (3).
Despite lacking a macula, the mouse retina shows many AMDf
and has been useful for relating risk factors for AMD, including
cigarette smoking, diet, and inflammation (10, 14–18). Here we
tested the hypothesis that changing from an HG to an LG diet even
during maturity can delay or arrest AMDf. We also elucidated
functional interactions between dietary glycemia, AMDf, the plasma
and urinary metabolomes, and the gut microbiome. These findings
resulted in the identification of apparent biomarkers and mechanistic
insights into the relationship between AMDf and dietary glycemia.
Results
Effects of Diet on Glycemic Metabolism. To evaluate the effects of
dietary glycemia on development of age-related eye disease, we fed
middle-aged (12-mo-old) mice HG and LG diets until they reached
old age (24 mo). The HG and LG diets differed only in the ratio of
amylose/amylopectin starches and were isocaloric (Methods) (10, 19).
Exchanging amylose for amylopectin increases the GI of the diet. To
seek proof of principle that age-related HG-diet–induced phenotypes
could be delayed or reversed, half of the HG mice consumed the HG
diet for 6 mo and then were transferred to the LG diet (hereafter,
“HGxoLG mice”) for the last 6 mo of life (see schematic in Fig.
S1A). All mice gained weight on their study diet, but HG mice gained
weight more rapidly than the mice fed the LG diet (hereafter, “LG
mice”) (Fig. S2 A and B). The LG and HGxoLG groups were nor-
moglycemic, whereas HG mice had impaired 6-h fasting glucose,
impaired glucose tolerance, and increased fasting insulin levels, in-
dicating insulin resistance (Figs. S1 D and E and S2 C and D) (19,
20). However, based on the observations that the extent of hyper-
glycemia is at least twofold less than in diabetic mice and that the
downward slope of the i.p. glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) curves in
the HG versus LG mice indicates only partial glucose intolerance, it
appears that the mice are nondiabetic (21, 22). The weight of the
HGxoLG mice decreased, eventually stabilizing around 10% heavier
than LG mice (Figs. S1D and S2B). HG mice also had significantly
higher levels of plasma total cholesterol and plasma leptin than LG
and HGxoLG mice, telegraphing a glucose-elicited alteration in lipid
metabolism (Fig. S1 D, F, and G). Consistent with better regulation
of glucose-associated metabolism, the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-
1):glucagon ratio, a measure of anti-hyperglycemic control, was in-
creased in LG and HGxoLG mice relative to HG mice (Fig. S1 D
and H). Other metabolic analytes often associated with obesity and
metabolic dysfunction did not differ significantly in the HG and LG
groups (Fig. S1D). Nine of the HG or HGxoLG mice died, whereas
only a single LG animal died during this study (Fig. S1 B and C).
Multiple Retinal Lesions Are More Frequent in HG Mice but Are Arrested or
Reversed by Switching to the LG Diet. Photoreceptor cell loss was
evaluated by the thickness of the layers of photoreceptor cell
nuclei (outer nuclear layer, ONL). HG mice (24-mo-old) exhibited
significant ONL thinning relative to LG mice, especially near the
optic nerve head and on the superior hemisphere of the retina
(Fig. 1A) (23). Remarkably, despite their having consumed the
HG diet for 6 mo before being switched to the LG diet, the ONL
thickness in HGxoLG animals did not differ from that in LG
animals. To create an overall retinal damage score, we summed
the area under the ONL thickness curve and scaled the parameter
so that the greater the amount of photoreceptor cell loss [lower
area under the curve (AUC)], the greater was the retinal damage
score (Fig. 1B). Mice fed LG or HG diets from 3 mo of age until
10 mo of age did not show differences in photoreceptor cell layer
thickness (Fig. 1C) (24). By age 18 mo, however, HG mice showed
higher retinal damage scores, which continued to increase until
24 mo. Retinal damage was markedly delayed in LG mice.
However, once retinal damage started, at around age 18 mo, the
rate of accretion was similar to that observed in the HG mice.
Impressively, there was no further photoreceptor cell loss in the
HGxoLG group after their change to the LG diet, implying a
rapid diet-related arrest or reversal of HG-induced damage.
Inner retina layer thinning, photoreceptor disorganization,
and swelling of inner segments as well as photoreceptor de-
generation were observed in HG but not in LG or HGxoLG mice
(Fig. 1F and Fig. S3 A–C). These findings are consistent with
neuronal apoptosis or remodeling in HG mice. An independent
hallmark of photoreceptor cell aging, the loss of synaptic pruning
of rod bipolar cell dendrites (25), was also more extensive in HG
than in LG and HGxoLG rod bipolar cells (Fig. 1 J and K).
Dysfunction of the RPE presages photoreceptor cell loss. We
observed that the areas with the greatest photoreceptor disorga-
nization were often associated with multilayered or atrophied
RPE (Fig. 1 F and H), histological abnormalities that are also
hallmarks of human dry AMD (26). HG retinas showed multiple
additional AMDf, including subretinal deposits and RPE vacuo-
lation, hypopigmentation, thinning, and disorganization (Figs. 1
F–I and 2A and Fig. S3 D–F). The whole HG mouse retina tissue
was more fragile, leading to RPE detachment postprocessing (Fig.
1 F–I) that was seen less frequently in LG or HGxoLG retinas.
Hallmarks of younger, healthy RPE were similar and more fre-
quent in LG and HGxoLG RPE, including well-maintained basal
infoldings with aligned mitochondria and typical numbers of pigment
granules (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4A). In contrast, RPE from HG mice
frequently showed loss of basal infoldings and the accumulation of
large basal laminar deposits associated with several microvacuolar
structures that resembled the membranous debris often associated
with advanced AMD (27, 28). RPE in HG mice also showed more
frequent accumulation of lipid droplets, phagosomes, and lipofuscin
granules, the last being quantitatively associated with the degree of
photoreceptor cell loss and corroborated by increased auto-
fluorescence (Fig. 2). These features are associated with impaired
degradation of phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments, possibly
via autophagy (Fig. S4B) (29).Together, our data indicate that HG
mice show photoreceptor cell damage and RPE abnormalities that
highly resemble human dry AMD and retina aging. Most of these
AMDf were prevented or reversed by consuming the LG diet or by
switching from the HG diet to the LG diet during maturity.
Metabolic and Biochemical Insights into the Etiology of AMDf. Ac-
cumulation of AGEs is diagnostic of many age-related diseases, in-
cluding AMD, and is a reporter of chronic hyperglycemia and its
downstream glycoxidative and other cytotoxic stresses (13, 30–32).
Plasma levels of the AGEs, including glucosepane, Ne(1-carboxyethyl)-
lysine (CEL), and 3-deoxyglucosone–derived hydroimidazolone
(3DG-H), were all higher in these HG nondiabetic mice (Fig. 3 A–
C), the first two showing quantitative associations with retinal dam-
age (Fig. 3D and Fig. S5A). This association is corroborated by strong
methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1/3) immunoreac-
tivity throughout the retina, particularly in the RPE, of HG mice

 relative to LG or HGxoLG mice (Fig. 3 E and F). Similar results were
observed using two different antibodies against CEL, a derivative of
methylglyoxal, consistent with prior reports of CEL expression in
Müller glial cells (33). HG-enriched immunostaining was not ob-
served for the highly related Ne(1-carboxymethyl)-lysine (CML), ar-
guing for the specificity of the CEL observations (Fig. 3 E and F and
Fig. S5). Together, these results suggest that multiple AGEs probably
contribute to the AMDf observed in HG-fed mice, that changing to
LG diets can delay, arrest, or reverse the accumulation of AGEs in
eye tissues, and that some AGEs appear to be molecular biomarkers
of disease.
An additional 309 and 47 metabolites were identified in
plasma and urine, respectively, using metabolomic approaches.
The datasets were complementary, with 26 metabolites found in
both fluids. Multivariate partial least squares regression (PLSR)
analyses identified metabolites that were enriched in the HG
versus the LG groups (shown on the x axis) and/or that were
enriched in the HGxoLG group versus HG and LG groups

HG-associated AMDf and photoreceptor cell aging in 24-mo-old mice is prevented by changing to the LG diet. (A) Photoreceptor cell layer thickness,
measured as the thickness of the ONL, is decreased, particularly in the superior hemisphere, in HG mice. (B) A boxplot of the retinal damage score, calculated
based on the area under the ONL thickness plot, shows increased retinal damage score in HG mice. (C) The retinal damage score increases continually over
time in HG mice and increases beginning at age 18 mo in LG mice, but photoreceptor cell loss in HGxoLG mice ceases after dietary change. Negative values
indicate ONL layers thicker than the reference (i.e., the average in 24-mo-old LG mice) (D–I) Toluidine blue-stained sections through the retinas of LG and
HGxoLG mice have normal architecture, whereas retinas of HG mice show the indicated lesions. Square brackets in F, H, and I indicate regions with a missing
RPE monolayer or hypopigmentation as indicated. Asterisks in F and H indicate regions of RPE multilayering. The arrows in G point to a region of vacuolated
RPE and the arrowhead points to a subretinal deposit. (J) Retinas stained for the rod bipolar marker PKCα (red) and horizontal cell marker Calbindin (green)
show ectopic rod bipolar dendrites (yellow) that extend beyond the outer plexiform layer (OPL) into the ONL (arrows) more frequently in HG mice than in
HGxoLG or LG mice. (K) The frequency of ectopic rod bipolar cell processes that are greater than 5 μm (solid bars) or 10 μm (hatched bars) was quantified and

 (shown on the y axis) in the plasma or urine, respectively (Fig. 4
A and B). Multiple plasma metabolites were common between
the LG and HGxoLG groups but were well separated from the
HG group (Fig. 4A). In comparison, urinary metabolites readily
separated the three dietary groups from each other (Fig. 4B).
ANOVA indicated specific metabolites that associated with diet
and/or retinal damage score, be it uniquely, additively, or as a
diet–phenotype interaction (Fig. 4 C and D, Fig. S6 A and B, and
Tables S1–S5). Statistically significantly associated metabolites
then were plotted as loadings and colored to indicate the nature
of the retina phenotype or/and diet associations (Fig. 4 C and D).
PLSR diet associations were validated at the level of individual
metabolites (Fig. S7A). Higher levels of hydrophilic metabolites,
including carbohydrates and amino acids, are associated with
lower retinal damage scores and consumption of the LG diet,
whereas higher levels of lipids are associated with higher retinal
damage scores and the HG diet (Fig. 4 C and D).
We performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
to identify metabolites as potential biomarkers that could predict
AMDf. We identified eight plasma metabolites, including C40:6 PC
(phosphatidylcholine) and C3 carnitine (propionylcarnitine), which
achieved nearly perfect separation between mice with a retinal
damage score >3 and nonaffected animals (area under the ROC
curve ≥0.96; P < 0.022) (Methods, Fig. 4 E and F, and Table S3).
Consistent with the positive relationships between lipid metabo-
lism and AMDf (Fig. 4C and Tables S1 and S3), we found that
higher plasma C22:6 LPE (lysophosphatidylethanolamine) levels
were strongly associated with increased retinal damage (Fig. 5G).
Furthermore, C22:6 LPE and related metabolites can be oxidized to
form 2-ω-carboxyethyl pyrrole (CEP) protein derivatives (34), whose
levels were higher in the photoreceptor cell inner and outer seg-
ments and RPE of HG than in LG and HGxoLG mice (Fig. 4 I and
J). There also was a strong central-to-peripheral gradient of CEP
within photoreceptor segments, with the accumulation occurring in

 the region with the largest difference in photoreceptor cell layer
thickness between HG and LG or HGxoLG retinas (Fig. 1A). The
CEP gradient mirrors the spatial pattern of lipid peroxidation ob-
served in the aging human eye (35) and the strong enrichment of its
precursor, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n3) in photoreceptors
(36). Consistent with these observations, CEP levels are higher in the
retina and plasma from AMD patients, and mice immunized with
CEP develop AMD-like pathology (37, 38). 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal
(4-HNE), a lipid peroxidation product, also accumulated in the
RPE of HG but not LG or HGxoLG mice (Fig. 4J). Together, the
findings indicate that, like AGEs, lipid peroxidation and advanced
lipid end product formation are hallmarks of HG-associated AMDf.
Functional integration of urinary and plasma metabolites as-
sociated with AMDf via pathway enrichment analysis showed
pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, as
well as oxidative phosphorylation (via the citric acid cycle) (Fig.
S7B). Microbial cometabolites whose levels are modulated by the
abundance of microbiota (39, 40), e.g., serotonin, hippurate, tri-
methylamine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 3-indoxylsulfate, tyrosine,
and tryptophan, were highly enriched among AMDf-associated
metabolites (enrichment P = 6.00 × 10−5). Furthermore, higher
serotonin levels associate with protection against retinal damage
in a diet-independent manner (Fig. 4H). Serotonin signals through
multiple receptors. Agonists and antagonists of these receptors are
neuroprotective against retinopathy (41–44).
The associations of microbial cometabolites with diet and
AMDf (Fig. S7B and Tables S1–S5) suggested that the gut
microbiome might be altered by diet. Thus, we characterized gut
microbiomes in a diet, time, and AMDf context. A clear re-
lationship between diet and microbiota is corroborated by the
separation of the microbiota compositions in the HG group from
those of the LG and HGxoLG groups (Fig. 5A and Fig. S8 A–C).
With crossover to the LG diet, the gut microbiome was restored to
one resembling that in LG mice (Fig. 5B). Aging is also an in-
fluence on the microbiota. The principal component 2 (PC2) axis
shows that there is also an age/time-dependent but diet-
independent shift in gut microbiota (Fig. 5A and Fig. S8 B and
C) (45, 46). At T2 (21 mo of age), the microbiome of HGxoLG
mice was distinct from that of HG mice and started to resemble
LG microbiomes (Fig. 5A, Center). By T3 (24 mo of age),
HGxoLG microbiomes were largely comingled with LG micro-
biomes (Fig. 5A, Right). Further, an influence of age and diet on
microbiota was indicated, because LG animals had similar
amounts of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, whereas HG
animals had more bacteria of unknown classification. The shift
from the HG to the LG diet was associated with increased Fir-
micutes and diminished levels of unclassified phyla, thus re-
sembling the microbiomes in LG mice (Fig. 5B). Additional
statistical enrichment analysis at each taxonomic level indicated
that the microbiome of HG mice is enriched in Firmicutes and
Clostridia (Fig. 5E) and that both of these are related to a more
advanced retinal damage score (Fig. 5E, Left Column). Con-
versely, LG mice are enriched in Bacteroidales and Erysipelotrichi
classes, and these are associated with protection against AMDf.
Analyses at the level of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
identified specific OTU–diet and OTU–retinal damage score in-
teractions (Fig. 5F). Diet-related changes in microbial composition
were also observed at the level of single OTUs, with OTU_6, an
S24-7 family member from the Bacteroidetes phylum, showing high
abundance only in LG samples, and OTU_1, an unassigned bac-
terium, showing high abundance only in HG samples (Fig. 5 C–E).
Diet-only associations in OTU_1 and S24-7 family and phenotype-
only association with the Bacilli class were also observed (Fig. 5E).
Surprisingly, three parameters of alpha diversity indicated a statis-
tically significant increase in alpha diversity [usually a feature of
healthier microbiomes (47)] in the HG group (Fig. S8D).
Together, the convergence of phenotype, diet, and microbiota
relationships suggest that the diet-induced change in the microbiota
in HGxoLG mice also contributes to the arrest of AMDf in these
animals.
To extract more metabolic insight into the diet–metabolome–
AMDf interactions, we used a semiquantitative network diagram
that integrated associations of urinary metabolites, plasma me-
tabolites, and the gut microbial OTUs to each other within a
retinal damage context (Fig. 6). Nodes that form many connec-
tions (edges) are shown more centrally and are likely hubs of
physiologically important retina–metabolome–microbiota inter-
actions (Table S6). The most central node is OTU_249. It has
11 positively correlated edges with hydrophilic metabolites and
four negatively correlated edges, which include three lipids
(Table S6). This large number of metabolite interactions sug-
gests that control of OTU_249 may be key to retinal phenotypic
outcomes. Serotonin is among the most central nodes within the
network (Table S6) and shows the second strongest association
with retina damage based on bivariate correlation analysis (Fig.
4H). The influence of microbiota is corroborated by the sero-
tonin relationship, because serotonin production derives from
tryptophan and is stimulated by gut spore-forming bacteria (48).
C22:6 LPE is also central within the network and has a re-
markably high predictive capacity to separate affected from
nonaffected individuals (AUC = 1.0) (Fig. 4G and Table S3).
The relationship between microbiota and alterations in the
metabolome were further integrated using metagenomic func-
tional KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
pathways of enriched microbiota (Fig. S9). As suggested by the
data in Fig. 4C, more advanced AMDf and the HG diet were
associated with pathways and modules relating to microbial fatty
acid metabolism (ko00061 and M00082) as well as to sugar and
amino acid transport (M00216, M00208). Protection from AMDf

 and the LG diet were associated with carbohydrate metabolism
(ko00562, ko00630, and M00565). The association of trehalose
biosynthesis with protection from AMDf in LG mice was in-
triguing, because this module (M00565) can use amylose, which
is only found in LG diets, and trehalose has been linked to
neuroprotection in a number of neurodegenerative disorders
(49, 50).
Collectively, the data show that the blood and urine metab-
olomes respond to diet and that several of these metabolites also
relate to retinal phenotype. As such, they appear to be biomarkers
of AMDf.
Discussion
In this work, using wild-type C57BL/6J mice, we advanced a model
of human dry AMD that recapitulates many of its key features,
including photoreceptor cell loss, RPE atrophy, accumulation of
lipofuscin and phagosomes, increased autofluorescence, and the
formation of large basal deposits associated with membranous
debris. LG diets confer protection for the retina against such age-
and disease-related damage. Encouragingly, by demonstrating
arrest or reversal of AMDf in the HGxoLG mice, we report that
switching to LG diets, even late in life, is salutary. Even synaptic
pruning is affected by the switch to the LG diet. As such, the data

 support human epidemiologic observations that suggest that
consuming lower GI diets is associated with delayed progress of
early AMD (7–9). The higher levels of AGEs and autofluorescence
in HG mice and their delayed or arrested accumulation in LG or
HGxoLG mice indicate that the benefit of the LG diet is derived
in part from lower glycative stress. The metabolomics, micro-
biome, and network data further show that these diet-induced
phenomena are interrelated and that the concerted reprogram-
ing of the metabolome and microbiome that accompanies the
switch from an HG to an LG diet is beneficial. These data also
complement recent observations regarding the importance of
glucose in RPE metabolism (51).
The experiments also revealed multiple potential biomarkers of
retinal damage, including blood glucosepane, CEL, serotonin, C3
carnitine, C22:6 LPE, and C40:6 PC, which should offer un-
precedented efficiency in earlier diagnosis, in prognosis, and in
evaluating the efficacy of new therapies. These results also provide
further information about potential modes of retinal maintenance
and pathobiologic mechanisms of AMDf. The strong correlation
between dietary carbohydrate and lipids within the context of
AMDf emphasizes their metabolic connection. C40:6 PC, C22:6
LPE, and C22:6 CE are of particular interest, because soft drusen,
an established clinical indication of AMD in humans, contain
many such lipids, and variants in cholesterol-related genes are risk
factors for AMD (3, 52). Our data also point to downstream lipid
peroxidation-related products, specifically CEP and 4-HNE, in the
etiology of AMDf (37, 38). Interactions between mutated Com-
plement factor H (CFH), a strong risk factor for human AMD,
and high dietary lipids and cholesterol lead to an AMD phenotype
that resembles the HG phenotype (15). Although we did not ob-
serve changes in Cfh in our mice, the underlying pathobiology may
be similar.
The AGEs glucosepane, CEL, and MG-H1 are caused, at least in
part, by elevated levels of sugars and subsequent modification by
sugar metabolites. The accumulation of AGEs and glucose in the
retina has been associated with other conditions of hyperglycemia,
notably diabetic retinopathy, and some of the phenotypes noted in
this work, such as RPE thinning, RPE vacuolation, photoreceptor
degeneration, and thinning of the inner retinal layer, were also ob-
served in humans and experimental models of diabetic retinopathy
(33, 53–59). Glycation results in the dysfunction of structural proteins
and impaired protein-editing machineries, including autophagy and
the ubiquitin proteolytic systems, functions that are required for the
degradation of phagosomes and AGEs (11, 29, 60). Combined, in-
sufficient protein editing leads to the accelerated accumulation of
damaged proteins and lipofuscin and to cytotoxicity, all of which we
observe in HG mice. Fortunately, all these lesions are diminished in
LG mice and with the change from the HG to the LG diet.
The diet-induced change in gut microbiota and its effect on
the metabolome and retinal health, as exemplified by the inverse
relationship between serotonin and frequency of AMDf, sub-
stantiates nutritional, specifically carbohydrate nutrition, pro-
phylaxis against AMDf. As products of the microbiome, the
metabolic
connections
among
tryptophan,
serotonin,
and
kynurenic acid are intriguing, because they echo relations of the
gut–brain axis (48, 61). Additionally, kynurenic acid has been
linked to neuroprotection in the eye (62, 63). New studies in
mice and humans confirm the important role of gut microbiota
in the development of neovascular (wet) AMD (64, 65).
In conclusion, our study reinforces the importance of consuming
LG diets, specifically diets with a lower GI, as an effective and
attainable way to maintain lower glucose levels and to avoid or to
treat early AMD. LG diets are achieved by using whole-grain
sources or resistant starches rather than rapidly metabolized poly-
saccharides. Our findings provide an impetus to develop the bio-
markers
as
new
diagnostics
and
avenues
for
therapeutic
intervention. Having such biomarkers will hasten prognosis and
treatment as well as make intervention trials far less expensive.
Methods
Full methods are presented in SI Methods.
Animals and Diets. C57BL/6J wild-type male mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories. Animals were fed standard chow (Teklad 7012; Harlan Laboratories)
ad libitum until 12 mo of age, at which time they were placed on the study diet.
The full dietary regimen, including numbers of animals, is summarized in Fig. S1 A
and B. Diets contained identical macronutrient compositions with the exception
that the HG starch was composed of 100% amylopectin (Amioca starch; Ingre-
dion, Inc.), whereas the LG starch was composed of 70% amylose/30% amylo-
pectin (HYLON VII starch; Ingredion Incorporated) (10). All diets were formulated
by Bio-Serv. All animal work was performed at Tufts Human Nutrition Research
Center on Aging and was approved by the Tufts University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee in adherence with the Association for Research in Vi-
sion and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic
and vision research. Animals deemed to be in poor health were killed and ex-
cluded from the analysis.
Statistical Analyses. For univariate analyses, data were evaluated using either
SPSS (IBM) or Microsoft Excel. First, data were evaluated as to whether they fit in a
normal distribution, based on kurtosis and skewness. Pairwise data that fit in a
normal distribution were analyzed by a two-tailed Student’s t test followed by an
F test to determine if the samples had equal variance. For group comparisons,
one-way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey’s Honestly Significant Dif-
ference (HSD) test. If the data did not fit a normal distribution, they were
evaluated for pairwise comparisons using a Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney U test or
for group comparisons using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Mann–Whitney U
post hoc testing. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was evaluated using the log-rank
test with censored data. Correlation analysis was performed in SPSS using either
Pearson correlation for normally distributed data or Spearman correlations. ROC
analysis was performed in SPSS, where the P value indicates asymptotic signifi-
cance. The significance of the number of metabolites achieving high separation
was calculated directly using a permutation test.
For multivariate statistical analyses of metabolomics and microbiome data,
orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) regression (66) was performed using
the pls R-package (67) and custom R script following the method described
in ref. 68. Complexity and performance of the model was estimated using

Network analysis of retinal damage reveals connections between
metabolites and microbiota. A network was constructed from all retinal
damage score-associated metabolites and OTUs (nodes) and their correla-
tions to each other (edges). Only edges that connect nodes between datasets
are shown. The size of the node is determined by the P value of association
with the retinal damage score, and the thickness of the edge is determined
by the correlation score between nodes. Positive associations are show as
solid lines, and negative correlations are shown as dashed lines. Colors and
shapes indicate datasets and diet associations as indicated in the legend.

 Monte Carlo cross-validation. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was used to
estimate false-discovery rate (FDR) values (69), setting a cutoff of q < 0.1.
Determination of Protein Glycation, Oxidation, and Nitration Adducts. Protein
glycation, oxidation, and nitration adducts were determined by stable iso-
topic dilution analysis LC-MS/MS using the protocol previously described (70).
LC-MS–Based Metabolomics. Fasting plasma samples taken immediately be-
fore mice were killed at age 24 mo were analyzed using three LC-MS/MS
spectrometry methods. A full description of the methodology is presented
in SI Methods or as published previously (71).
1H NMR-Based Metabolomics. Free-catch urine was obtained from mice at age
21 mo. A 1H NMR spectrum of each sample was collected at 25 °C on a Bruker
Avance 600 spectrometer using 64 scans and a NOE 1D pulse sequence. In
addition, a 2D
13C-1H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)
spectrum was used to aid in metabolite identification. The data were pro-
cessed and analyzed using CHENOMX NMR Suite 7.1 for quantification (72).
A full description of the methodology is presented in SI Methods.
Taxonomic Microbiota Analysis. Feces (at least 10 per animal) were obtained
from mice at 17, 21, and 23 mo. Samples were processed as previously described
(73) using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.). Enrichment analysis of higher-order
microbiome taxa and function was done as previously described (74).
Network Generation. Metabolites and microbiota significantly related to the
retinal phenotype were selected using an FDR threshold of 0.05. Selected
entities have been represented as nodes of the network and are connected by
edges if the R2 between levels in the subset of overlapping animals was
greater than or equal to 0.5. Because connections between different data
classes were the primary interest, only these were plotted. Network visual-
ization was performed using Cytoscape software (75).
