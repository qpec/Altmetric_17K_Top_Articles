ABSTRACT
The U.S. National Institutes of Health
(NIH) annually invests approximately $22 billion in bio-
medical research through its extramural grant programs.
Since fiscal year (FY) 2010, all persons involved in research
during the previous project year have been required to be
listed on the annual grant progress report. These new data
have enabled the production of the first-ever census of the
NIH-funded extramural research workforce. Data were
extracted from All Personnel Reports submitted for NIH
grants funded in FY 2009, including position title, months
of effort, academic degrees obtained, and personal iden-
tifiers. Data were de-duplicated to determine a unique
person count. Person-years of effort (PYE) on NIH grants
were computed. In FY 2009, NIH funded 50,885 grant
projects, which created 313,049 full- and part-time posi-
tions spanning all job functions involved in biomedical
research. These positions were staffed by 247,457 people
at 2,604 institutions. These persons devoted 121,465 PYE
to NIH grant-supported research. Research project grants
each supported 6 full- or part-time positions, on average.
Over 20% of positions were occupied by postdoctoral re-
searchers and graduate and undergraduate students.
These baseline data were used to project workforce esti-
mates for FYs 2010–2014 and will serve as a foundation for
future research.—Pool, L. R., Wagner, R. M., Scott, L. L.,

ThemissionoftheU.S.NationalInstitutesofHealth(NIH)
is toimprove health and save lives, whichit accomplishes in
large part by investing in biomedical research through
grants to universities, teaching hospitals, research centers,
and other institutions across the country and around the
worldthroughtheNIHextramuralgrantprogram.Infiscal
year (FY) 2009, the initial year of this study, the NIH
invested almost $22 billion (1)—72% of its budget—in
funding for grants to extramural institutions and their in-
vestigators. The leading research universities receive hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in funding each year, and these
universities have come to rely on NIH for support of faculty
and research staff salaries (2). In addition, NIH funding
supports most of the biomedical research training, either
directly through the Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional Na-
tional Research Service Award (NRSA) training grants and
fellowships or via positions on research grants (3).
As the largest funder of biomedical research and train-
ing in the world, the NIH is central to discussions of the
future of biomedical research and the research workforce.
Many believe the biomedical research community is at a
crossroads: even as scientific breakthroughs continue oc-
cur at a rapid pace, systemic flaws are threatening the
sustainability of the academic research enterprise, and
grant resources are stretched increasingly thin (4). It has
been posited that these conditions arise from a structural
disequilibrium, in which far more scientists are being
trained than can eventually be supported by grant funding
(5). This debate has led to a widespread interest in the size
and composition of the biomedical research workforce.
In past years, NIH has routinely collected data on the
principal investigators (PIs) of research grants and NRSA-
funded trainees and fellows. As a result, information about
these individuals is available on the NIH website and has

 been extensively analyzed (6). Much less is known, how-
ever, about other personnel who are vital to the research
process, such as staff scientists, laboratory technicians, and
non-NRSA–supported student trainees. To address this
gap, NIH endeavored to use administrative data to assess
the grant-associated workforce in 1993 (7) and in 2008 (8).
Both assessments were based on key personnel in-
formation listed in the individual grant progress reports,
and the latter evaluation found significant under-
reporting of research support staff in the key personnel
information, including early career scientists and
students.
Alternative methods to enumerate the NIH-funded
workforce have been used in studies focused on doc-
umenting the economic impact of scientific research
funding. Two advocacy organizations—Families USA and
United for Medical Research (UMR)—have used eco-
nomic modeling to estimate the number of biomedical
research personnel, as well as the additional people
employed indirectly through NIH funding (9, 10). The
STAR METRICS (Science and Technology in America’s
Reinvestment–Measuring the Effect of Research on In-
novation, Competitiveness and Science) program uses
university administrative and personnel records to obtain
project-level information about the federally funded
workforce (11). Although these data can provide overall
estimates of the NIH-funded workforce, and in the case of
STAR METRICS, some individual-level data, they have
been used primarily to measure job creation.
Lack of comprehensive data on the NIH-funded bio-
medical workforce has limited NIH policy discussions and
recommendations. In 2012, the NIH-commissioned Bio-
medicalResearchWorkforceWorkingGroupReportmade
extensive use of data from National Science Foundation
(NSF) surveys and the Association of American Medical
Colleges (AAMC), but noted numerous data gaps (3); and,
all too often, persons in the biomedical research commu-
nity fill in the data gaps using anecdotal and personal ob-
servations as their information source (11, 12), which does
not contribute to evidence-based policy making.
To improve the collection of personnel data, NIH
modified its policies and, beginning in FY 2010, required
reporting, on the annual grant progress report, all per-
sonnel who had devoted a month or more of effort in the
previous fiscal year to that research project (13). The All
Personnel Report allows for an annual census of the per-
sonnel associated with NIH extramural grants.
Our study was initiated to leverage the new information
intheAllPersonnelReport,introducedin2010,todevelop
a more reliable estimate of the size and nature of the ex-
tramural grant workforce. Because some individuals iden-
tified on the All Personnel Report contributed to more
than 1 NIH grant, we sought to determine not only the
number of positions, but also the number of unique
persons filling these positions, and the total amount of
effort devoted by these persons associated with NIH grants
funded in FY 2009. We used the age and educational at-
tainment recorded on the All Personnel Report to provide
insight into career trajectories. In addition, we linked these
datatotheNSFSurveyofEarnedDoctorates(SED),soasto
further characterize the pool of early career scientists.
Finally, we used the FY 2009 baseline data to project the
total number of positions, persons, and years of effort as-
sociated with the NIH grants awarded in FYs 2010-2014, to
assess any workforce changes that may be coincident with
shifts in funding and project activities supported by NIH in
the latter years. These projections are of particular interest
as a result of slowdowns in federal funding because of the
recession of December 2007 through June 2009 (14) and
the budget sequestration of 2013, which have led to a de-
cline in constant dollars in NIH funding since FY 2009.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Personnel estimates were based solely on NIH extramural grants.
All grant mechanisms were included (e.g., research project, cen-
ter, training, and fellowships). NIH research and development
contracts and associated extramural personnel were excluded.
Most NIH grants are awarded competitively in the first year and
funded incrementally in each subsequent noncompeting year of
thegrant period, if progress issatisfactory.Research grants can be
made for up to 5 years, and for each noncompeting year, the PI is
required to file a progress report. The All Personnel Report is a
component of this progress report, and the PI, as well as all other
persons devoting a month or more of effort to the grant during
the previous fiscal year, are required to be listed, regardless of
their role on the project or whether the grant funded their salary.
The All Personnel Report captures positions associated with di-
rect costs of grants, but excludes positionsassociated with indirect
costs, such as facilities and administrative costs of grants. This
study used FY 2010 progress reports to enumerate the grant
personnel associated with FY 2009 funding.
Tobegin,a listing ofall grants supportedby NIHin FY2009was
created with the goal of obtaining a progress report for each
project. Grants funded through the American Recovery and Re-
investment Act of 2009 (ARRA) were excluded from this analysis.
ARRA was a one-time stimulus of U.S. government funding, tax
cuts, and benefits made in response to an economic crisis and was
designedto spureconomic activity andinvestinlong-term growth
(15). Under ARRA, NIH received an additional $10.4 billion be-
yond its usual FY 2009 and 2010 Congressional appropriations.
Because of supplemental awards, it is possible for multiple
grantstobe associatedwithagivenprojectinasingleFY.Onlyone
progress report is submitted per project annually; there were
50,885 non-ARRA grant projects funded in FY 2009 from 53,453
non-ARRA grant awards, including supplements. With the
unique project identification number, the NIH database of in-
formation on extramural applications and awards known as
Information for Management, Planning, Analysis, and Co-
ordination II (IMPAC II) was used to obtain associated per-
sonnel information. The available personnel information was
downloaded directly from IMPAC II for all grant PIs, for the
electronically submitted progress reports (51% of total projects),
and for the training and fellowship grants (10% of projects).
Progress reports were submitted on paper for 11% of projects. For
paper progress reports, the All Personnel Reports were scanned
as a normal part of the administrative process, and those images
were available in IMPAC II but required subsequent extraction
and parsing into individual data fields to enable further analysis.
The information on the scanned image of the progress report was

 extracted from the All Personnel Forms via optical character
recognition (OCR) software. The software was able to automati-
cally extract all but 52 of the All Personnel Reports, which were
manually entered into a database for analysis.
Datafromallsourceswerecombined,cleaned,andcoded.The
All Personnel Report collects the following elements for each
person listed on the report:
Name;
Commons profile ID (a unique username for institutional
signing officials, PIs, trainees, and postdocs who are
required to register with the eRA (Electronic Research
Administration) Commons, an online interface for
accessing and sharing administrative information re-
lating to NIH grants);
Last 4 digits of the Social Security number (SSN);
Month and year of birth;
Educational degree(s) attained;
Occupational position title on the grant (e.g., PI);
A funding code to indicate whether the position was
funded through NIH supplemental funding; and
Months of effort-time spent on the grant, divided into
calendar year, summer, and academic year variables.
Nonspecified position records (e.g., To Be Hired) were re-
moved from the dataset. Position records with an ARRA-
related supplemental funding code (N = 2226) were also
excluded. The enumeration of the position type, effort-time,
degree information, and age distribution was used to char-
acterize the workforce.
A standard set of 11 occupational position types was provided
in the initial All Personnel Report guidance (see http://grants.nih.
gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-12-152.html and ref. 16). PIs
were encouraged to code their project personnel according to
this taxonomy. For the electronically submitted information,
investigators were given a drop-down menu, from which they
couldpickoneofthestandardclassificationsorchoosean“other”
category, for which they were then asked to specify the position
title. Seventy-one percent of the electronically reported person-
nel were assigned a standard position classification by the PI.
Personnel reported in “other” positions were manually classified.
Because the paper-based forms allowed for a free-text field,
many of the position titles required manual categorization.
Using the existing positions and additional position categories
that appeared frequently in the “other” category, a standard
taxonomy of 20 position types was created and then vetted and
finalized by the entire study team. Two staff members in-
dependently coded all titles to this taxonomy, with an additional
staff member serving as arbiter for any titles classified differently
by the two coders. Over 23,400 unique free-text position titles
were processed. To perform aggregated position analysis, the
20 position types were grouped into 4 broad categories: Senior
Researcher, Research Support, Training and Related, and
Other/Unknown. Individuals listed as Research Assistants or
Coordinators without further specification of whether they
were students or postdoctoral researchers, were classified to the
Research Support category. Individuals supported by in-
stitutional career (K) and institutional training (T) awards were
classified under the Training and Related category, whereas
PIs for the institutional and individual career awards and in-
stitutional training awards were classified as PIs under the
Senior Researcher category. Although individuals receiving fel-
lowship (F) grants were PIs of their awards, they were classified
to the Training and Related, rather than the PI category.
The Other/Unknown category was excluded from position
specific analyses.
Beginning with research grant applications submitted in
February 2007, the NIH allowed applicants and their institutions to
identify multiple principal investigators (MPIs), to permit more
than 1 PI to share the authority and responsibility for leading and
directing the project, intellectually and logistically (17). In this
analysis, persons designated as MPIs were categorized into the PI
position category. Co-investigators are senior or key personnel
involved in the scientific development or execution of a project,
but are not PIs or MPIs.
Many biomedical research staff are affiliated with multiple
grants, providing several months of effort-time to each project. In
addition to counting all positions on all projects, the number of
unique persons that devote effort to NIH-funded projects was of
interest. Toachievethis aim, a de-duplication algorithmthat used
the personal and grant information elements to determine du-
plicates was constructed. The personally identifying information
collected on the All Personnel Report—name, last 4 digits of the
SSN, birth month and year, and NIH Commons profile ID—was
used in conjunction with information related to the grant
itself—the name and location (city and state) of the institution
receiving the grant—to identify individuals affiliated with more
than 1 grant within the enumeration dataset.
Degree information was collected to ascertain the level of ed-
ucational attainment for personsengaged inbiomedicalresearch
at different career stages. This free-text field netted 989 different
degree and professional certification acronyms, which were
classified. The degree was classified to the broad level of educa-
tionalattainment,correspondingtothehighestlevelofeducation
achieved (e.g., those who reported both bachelor’s and master’s
degrees were reported in the master’s category, and those who
reported master’s and doctorate degrees were reported in the
doctorate category). For those who had received a doctorate
(.50% of those who reported degree information), 5 mutually
exclusive doctorate categories were created: Doctor of Medicine
(M.D.) Only, Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), M.D./Ph.D., Clinical
Doctorate, and Other Doctorate. The M.D. category included
persons who reported equivalent degrees; likewise, the Ph.D.
category included those with equivalent degrees. The Clinical
Doctorate category included other doctoral-level health profes-
sionals, such as those holding degrees in dentistry, veterinary
medicine, or optometry. The Other Doctorate category included
nonclinical professional doctorates, such as law or public ad-
ministration. Many reported professional certification acronyms
in lieu of, or in addition to, their degree information. If the cer-
tification required a minimum specified level of education, it was
codified to that degree level [e.g., using the FACP designation
(the acronym for Fellow of the American College of Physicians)
requires that one have an M.D. or equivalent degree]. Degrees
offered only at non-U.S. institutions were codified to the equiva-
lent U.S. degree.
Approximately 92% of the extracted records had associated
effort-time, reported as the number of months that the par-
ticular individual was involved with the project. Most reported
in the calendar year method; only a small portion of records
(7%) used the alternative summer and academic year reporting
approach. Using the records with associated effort-time, the
calendar year, summer, and academic year fields were sum-
med to produce an annual effort-time calculation. The OCR
technology incorrectly processed some effort-time reported
on the paper forms, thus rendering a small percentage of the
effort-time extraction unusable. For all records for which these
data were unavailable, the median effort-time was imputed for
the particular position category.
Personnel information was entirely missing for 28% of FY 2009
grant projects. This is because, in the initial implementation of
the All Personnel Report, PIs were not required to submit an All
Personnel Report with the final grant report. In addition, All
Personnel Reports werenot required for multiyear-funded grants
that receive funding for the entire project period in the first year;

on NIH grant projects in FY 2009, data were imputed for the

 projects for which an All Personnel Report was not available or
required, using the existing grant records with available person-
nel data. A median number of position types per dollar was cal-
culated, by using totals of direct-cost dollars and occupational
position types by activity code. For each project in the imputation
file, the direct cost amount was multiplied by the median position
type per dollar within the associated activity code, yielding an
estimateofthenumberofpositionsbyoccupationalpositiontype.
An imputation file was created with the project number, position
type, and number of roles associated with the position, to the
nearest tenth. Then, using the position:person ratio by occupa-
tional position type from the existing data records, the number of
persons was added to the position listing. Finally, the position:
effort-time ratio by occupational position type was added, based
ontheexistingdatarecords.Dataimputationaddedanadditional
65,138 positions, 58,196 people, and 264,019 mo of effort-time to
the calculation totals. Because information on PIs was available in
IMPAC II for 100% of the projects, no PI records were added
through imputation. In addition, IMPAC II also contains detailed
information on undergraduates, graduate students, and post-
doctoral researchers associated with training and fellowship
grants (Ts and Fs), and therefore no records were added through
imputation for these grants.
Using the cleaned and combined data, descriptive statistical
analyses on positions (the full list of personnel records including
the imputed positions), persons (the de-duplicated list of per-
sonnel records includingthe imputed persons), andperson-years
of effort (PYE) for FY 2009 were produced. One PYE was defined
as 12 mo of effort by 1 or more persons (e.g., 2 persons devoting
full-time effort for 6 months equals 1 PYE). To compute PYE, the
total effort-months of time were summed across the personnel
records and imputed records and divided by 12. All data prepa-
ration and analysis was performed with SAS software 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
In the analyses broken down by occupational position, persons
whowerereportedinmorethan1roletypewereincludedineach
of those role type categories. For example, if a 35-yr-old person
was reported as a postdoctoral researcher on one grant and staff
scientist on another grant, she or he would be included in the age
distributions for both position types.
Supplemental Table S1 provides a breakdown of the average
numberofpositionspergrantandtheaveragenumberofPYEper
grant for each activity code in FY 2009. By multiplying the FY 2009
averages by the number of grants in each activity code in each FY
2010 through 2014, we estimated the total workforce positions
and total PYE for those years. Furthermore, we used the overall
ratio of positions:persons to estimate the number of unique per-
sons in these later FYs (Table 3). New activity codes not used in FY
2009 were assigned values from other similar activity codes that
were used in FY 2009.
The NIH Office of Human Subjects Research Protections

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Workforce totals and projections
The primary objective of the first set of analyses was to
determine the overall number of full- and part-time posi-
tions, unique persons, and distinct PYE associated with
NIH-funded grant projects in FY 2009, as well as counts by
occupationtype.Weusedoverallposition,person,andPYE
counts to project the workforce for NIH-funded grant
projects from FY 2010 to FY 2014.
Total workforce positions
There were 313,049 full- and part-time positions on NIH-
funded grant projects in FY 2009. This estimate is about
10% lower than the figure reported by Families USA in
2008, which estimated that NIH funding created 350,894
jobs in FY 2007 (9). However, this difference was un-
surprising because the Families USA estimate used an ap-
proach to economic modeling known as the Regional
Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS) II multiplier to
determine its employment estimates, and these estimates
included full- and part-time, primary and secondary jobs
created from both NIH grant and contract funding. In
the Families USA study, primary jobs were those arising
from NIH extramural funding to institutions, including
dollars to support specific research projects and facilities
and administrative costs. Examples of such jobs include
PIs, laboratory technicians, and university administrators.
These primary personnel also spent money on other
goods and services in the economy, contributing to the
salaries of other employees, who themselves spent money.
Economists call these successive rounds of expenditures
“the multiplier effect.” Multipliers can be quantified and
were used in the Families USA study to estimate the num-
ber of secondary jobs from the initial NIH funding
to institutions.
In contrast, the current analysis addressed only the po-
sitions associated with the direct cost portions of NIH grant
awards, excluding positions linked to facilities and ad-
ministrative costs of these grants. Also excluded from the
current analysis were positions associated with contract
funding, which represented an additional 10% of the NIH
budget.
An additional study using the RIMS II multiplier was
conducted by UMR, which found that FY 2010 NIH fund-
ing, excluding ARRA dollars, supported 403,389 jobs (8).
The UMR estimate was almost 29% higher than that found
in the current analysis. Like the estimate from Families
USA study, the higher UMR figure was partially because of
the inclusion of primary and secondary jobs created from
both NIH grant and contract total funding to institutions
(including direct costs and facilities and administrative
costs). However, the UMR2010 jobs figure was 15% higher
than the Families USA 2007. The higher UMR job estimate
likely resulted from the study having applied a national
multiplier tocaptureeconomic activitybetweenstates,which
the authors estimated to represent ;16% of national ac-
tivity, as well as state multipliers to estimate economic ac-
tivity within states. In contrast, the Families USA study used
only state multipliers.
Whereas the RIMS estimates are useful for understand-
ing the broader labor market impact of NIH grant and
contract funding, our position total provides a census of
personnel contributing directly to research supported by
NIH grants.

 more than 1 grant project and could occupy different oc-
cupational roles on projects, persons were counted in as
many positions as they were reported to hold in FY 2009.
The most frequently reported roles were, in descending
order, Co-investigator, PI, Graduate Researcher, Post-
doctoral Researcher, and Research Assistant/Coordinator.
Research Support roles comprised 26.0% of all positions
reported, highlighting the importance of staff, such as
technicians, data analysts, and administrators, in the
success of research projects.
In FY 2009, the average number of full- and part-time
positions per project was 6.2. However, this average var-
ied among the different grant types (Table 1), as grant
mechanisms reflect different types of research and re-
lated activities, such as research training and career
development. The direct cost funding of an award cor-
related only moderately with the number of positions
(r = 0.51), perhaps reflecting variations in costs associ-
ated with different types of positions.
The average frequency of the type of position also
varied across mechanisms. Figure 2 shows the average
number of positions for selected position types by project
mechanism. In particular, many center grants reported a
high number of Co-investigators, likely representing the
multiple subproject directors leading research projects
and “cores” within centers. Most of NIH research grants
were awarded to higher educational institutions (18).
Educational institutions have ready access and commit-
ment to the workforce in training: postdoctoral, gradu-
ate, and undergraduate researchers. In contrast, Small
Business Innovation Research and Small Business Tech-
nology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program awards are
made to small businesses, which rely more heavily on staff
scientists and consultants.

 Persons
There were 247,457 unique individuals filling positions
associated with NIH-funded projects in FY 2009. This
number significantly exceeds the estimate by McGarvey
et al.(8)of 156,000 individuals associated withFY 2007 NIH
grants. However, the latter study used a different reporting
form based on the previous NIH policy—the Key Person-
nel Form—and the researchers found that many respon-
dents reported only the PI and concluded that substantial
underreporting was likely. Because the All Personnel Form
contains specific instructions to list all personnel involved
with the research grant, the current study’s estimate of
unique individuals is considered a more accurate repre-
sentation of the number of people staffing positions on
NIH grants.
Relationship of persons to positions
Using the de-duplication algorithm, it was possible to de-
termine the number of unique persons reported invarious
full- and part-time positions. About 19% of the people
working on NIH projects served in positions on 2 or more
grants in FY 2009, resulting in, on average, each person
working on NIH-funded projects filling 1.3 positions. Se-
nior Researchers, particularly PIs and Co-investigators,

most popular combinations of position types for a single
person tofill werevariations of theSenior Researcher types
and Research Training and Related roles.
PYE
In FY 2009, 1,457,582 person-months, equivalent to
121,465 PYE, were devoted by individuals associated
with NIH grants. The most recent prior assessment of
PYE associated with NIH extramural funding was con-
ducted in 1993, but was restricted to only R01 and P01
grants. The latter study reported 55,480 PYE in FY 1990
with an average of 3.3 PYE per grant (7). The present
study found 59,793 PYE associated with R01 and P01
grants with an average of 2.2 PYE per grant. However,
the 1993 study oversampled P01s which tend to have
more associated positions (in FY 2009, P01s had an
average of 8.7 PYE, whereas R01s had an average of
2.0 PYE). This oversampling may have resulted in an
inflated estimate of the average number of PYE in 1990.
In the current study, for FY 2009, the overall average
number of PYE per grant across all grant mechanisms was
2.4. The overall average number of months of effort de-
voted to a project by each project participant was ;4.7. In
general, those in Senior Researcher positions devoted
fewer months of effort on a project: an average of 3.4 mo
for PIs and 1.7 mo for Co-investigators. Among those in
Senior Researcher roles, staff scientists logged the most
months of effort per project, an average of 5.6 mo (Fig. 3).
Those in Research Support, and Training and Related
positions dedicated more months of effort to a project: an
average of 6.0 mo for Research Assistant/Coordinators,
6.1 mo for Technicians, 7.8 mo Graduate Researchers, and
8.4 mo for Postdoctoral Researchers. Although Postdoctoral
and Graduate trainees often provide 12 mo of support to

 research, many transition in and out of these roles within a
given fiscal year, contributing to the slightly lower estimates
of months of effort. In addition, many of these individuals
provide support to multiple projects within a given year, and
thus devote less than 12 mo of effort to a single project.

 These data suggest that in FY 2009, PIs devoted, on av-
erage, 4.90 mo of effort to NIH grants per year [3.4 mo/
project multiplied by 1.44 positions (nearly equivalent to
projects)/PI].Ifoneassumes all ofthiseffortwaspaidfrom
NIH grants, then PIs received nearly half of their annual
salary support from NIH funds. This estimate may repre-
sent an upper bound of NIH PI salary support because the
All Personnel Report describes uncompensated and com-
pensated effort. Yet, this figure could underestimate total
extramural support to PIs, as it did not include PI effort
associated with other roles (e.g., as Co-investigators), with
contracts (which lack an All Personnel Report), and from
extramural awards from other agencies, information not
available to the authors.
Summary of positions, persons, and person-years of effort and
future workforce projections
Comparing the number of positions, persons, and PYE al-
lows for a more nuanced view of the distribution of project-
related effort and the full-time positions associated with
NIH funding in FY 2009. When comparing total positions
to total persons, a Senior Researcher was more likely to be
contributing to 2 or more grants in FY 2009 (Fig. 5).
However, Senior Researchers spent fewer months on a
specific project, so that those in the Research Support, and
Training and Related roles dedicated more PYE to re-
search than did Senior Researchers.
The estimated workforce positions, associated per-
sons, and the total PYE for FY 2009 and the projections
for FYs 2010–2014 are listed in Table 3. To provide
context, the number of projects funded in each year,
FYs 2009–2014, and their respective total direct costs in
constant 2009 dollars are also shown. Despite a 6.2%
decline in total NIH grant projects and a 6.5% re-
duction in total direct costs associated with those grant
projects between FY 2009 and FY 2014, the estimated
total number of workforce positions, persons, and PYE
remained relatively stable over this period (Table 3).
This consistency was largely because the distribution of
grants by activity codes remained similar to that in FY
2009. The slight peak in FY2012 workforce estimates
was to the result of a large increase in the number of
UM1 activity code grants, associated with very large,
typically multimillion dollar awards. The subsequent
minor declines reflected fewer dollars available for
grants in FYs 2013 and 2014.
These annual projections are useful, because NIH is
unlikely to repeat this study, which required significant
manual effort and time, until all of the detailed data
needed to enumerate and characterize NIH-associated
extramural personnel are captured electronically in
structured fields necessary for quantitative analysis. Many
data collection enhancements are under way but are not
expected to be completed for several years. The accuracy
of these post-FY 2009 annual workforce projections will
depend, in part, on the stability of the average values per
grant by activity code over time, but because different ac-
tivity codes reflect distinct types of projects and support, it
isexpectedthattheirrespectiveaverageswillremainstable
for some time. The accuracy of these estimates also relies
on the relative stability in the distribution of NIH grants by
activity; as new grant activities are introduced, their staff-
ing patterns are estimated, based on their similarity to
existing grant activities.
Workforce demographics
Usingthelimiteddemographicinformationavailablefrom
the All Personnel Report, we analyzed the educational at-
tainment and age of the NIH-funded biomedical work-
force by position type, to gain further insight into career
trajectories, especially for positions for which NIH doesnot
routinely collect or report information (12).

 Educational attainment
Of persons reporting degree information, most reported
having a doctorate of some type, and over half (53%)
reported having a Ph.D. as their highest degree attained.
However, the frequency of degree type varied by position,
as did the percentage of persons reporting. Fewer persons
reported degree information in the Research Support
project positions. Figure 6 shows the distribution of
educational attainment for those persons who reported
degree information. Because graduate researchers, un-
dergraduate researchers, and high school students were
still working toward a degree, they were not included in
the educational attainment analysis.
Senior Researcher roles such as PI, Co-investigator,
Faculty Collaborator, and Mentor/Advisor were staffed
almost exclusively by a mixture of persons with a pro-
fessional or research doctorate. Among the most senior
roles, Ph.D.s and M.D./Ph.D.s were most highly repre-
sented in the PI category, whereas those with M.D.s only

 were more likely to be in the Co-investigator role.
However, even though those possessing the M.D. degree
alone were more likely to be Co-investigators, the ma-
jority in this category (69%) had Ph.D.s or M.D./Ph.D.s,
among those reporting their degrees. An even higher
proportion of PIs (77%) indicated having a Ph.D. or
M.D./Ph.D.
Other Senior Researcher roles, such as Staff Scientist,
Biostatistician, and Consultant, were heavily staffed by
doctorate holders but included some persons with
master’s- or bachelor’s-level education. The Research Sup-
port roles, such as Research Assistant/Coordinator, Techni-
cian, and Data Analyst, were mostly staffed by those with a
master’s or bachelor’s degree as the highest level attained.
The Health Care Professional category was heterogeneous in
educational attainment because of the inclusion of study
physicians (with an M.D. or equivalent) and study nurses
(with a mixture of doctoral, master’s, bachelor’s, and as-
sociate’s levels of education), as well as individuals with
other patient care backgrounds. Because the Managerial/
Administrative position represented a diverse category
of nonscientific grant staff, it included a mixture of doc-
torate holders (e.g., chief executive officers, department
chairs) as well as master’s and bachelor’s degree holders
(e.g., payroll administrators and staff assistants). For
those who reported a master’s degree as highest level of
attainment, 61% reported having a Master of Science,
15% reported having a Master of Arts, and 9% reported
having a Master of Public Health.

those associated with the senior positions. However, the
larger interquartile ranges for these positions indicate that
althoughmanypeopleserveinthesepositionsearlyintheir

who served in these roles. Training and Related positions
are pegged to educational or early career experiences,
and thus the median age was lower and the interquartile
range tighter for these position types.
Workforce training and role of the NRSA program
As part of its mission, NIH plays a significant role in
training the biomedical research workforce. This study
found, in FY 2009, that NIH supported 29,702 post-
doctoral researchers as well as 31,487 graduate student
and 5,788 undergraduate researchers from all grant
mechanisms (Table 4).
The figure for NIH-supported graduate students
exceeds that reported by the National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) in the results of the NSF-NIH Survey of
Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and
Engineering (GSS), an annual survey of academic
institutions in the United States that grant research-
based master’s degrees or doctorates in science, engi-
neering, or selected health fields. In 2009, the GSS
reported 16% fewer graduate students supported by
NIH funding (N = 26,506) than found in this study (N =
31,487). About 26% of the graduate students in science
and engineering fields reported in the GSS as receiving

 NIH support in 2009, were associated with NIH train-
ing grants or fellowships (19). However, the GSS uses
different methods and captures only students’ primary
sources of support, reporting this information only for
full-time students at degree granting institutions. In
addition, the GSS enumerates students at 1 point of time
in the year. In contrast, the All Personal Report includes
all of NIH’s support for part- and full-time graduate
students for the entire fiscal year, perhaps accounting
for this study’s higher counts than the GSS.
The NIH flagship program for research training is the
Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA program, which offers support to
undergraduates,graduatestudents,postdoctoralresearchers,
and senior fellows in both institutionally (training) and in-
dividually administered (fellowships) awards. These awards
provide tuition support, stipends, and training-related ex-
pense funding at levels that are set annually. NRSA funding is
available only to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. In
addition, undergraduate training programs are only pro-
vided at a limited number of institutions.

 In FY 2009, 21% of postdoctoral, 34% of graduate, and
12% ofundergraduateresearch positions supportedby the
NIH were funded through NRSA awards. As shown in
Table 4, the NRSA training programs represented a larger
fraction of the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate
PYE than unique persons, because, in contrast to non-
NRSA postdoctorates and students, NRSA trainees and
fellows are required to devote their full-time effort to the
NRSA grant and are generally supported for 12-mo con-
tinuous periods (20).
Most postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate re-
search positions were supported through mechanisms
other than the NRSA training programs (Table 4), in-
cluding non-NRSA training-related NIH funding oppor-
tunities [such as the Fogarty International Research
Training Award programs (21) and the NIH Summer Re-
search Experience Programs (22)], as well as through
positions working on NIH research grants. Because,
according to the GSS, ;51% of postdoctorates in bio-
medical sciences departments at U.S. institutions were on
temporary visas in 2009 (19), the positions on research
grants—which do not have citizenship restrictions—are
commonly used to support those researchers.
Using the information from IMPAC II and the
SED (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/), citizenship
was determined for the subset of non-NRSA postdoctorates
who reported their Commons ID and received an aca-
demic doctorate in the United States. The SED is an annual
census of all persons who received an academic doctorate
from a U.S. institution, and thus it excludes those who
received their academic doctorate outside of the United
States or lack such a degree (e.g., M.D.-only degree hold-
ers). Citizenship status was preferentially obtained from
IMPAC II, and supplemented by the information in the
SED when IMPAC II citizenship status was unavailable.
Individuals were classified as temporary residents if their
citizenship status was recorded as a temporary resident in
IMPAC II, or their citizenship status was unknown in
IMPAC II and they were either not captured in the SED or
reported having a temporary U.S. visa in the SED. In this
sample, almost 65% of non-NRSA postdoctorates were es-
timated to be on temporary visas (Table 5).
From the available demographic information, there
were differences in the educational background of the
NRSA and other grant-funded postdoctorates. The pro-
portion of NRSA postdoctorates with medical or other
health professional doctorates was .35%, whereas ,10%
of the non-NRSA grant-funded postdoctorates had clinical
degrees (Fig. 8). This result aligns with NIH policy, which
encourages doctoral-level health professionals to receive
formal research training through the NRSA program (20).
However, because of the larger overall number of post-
doctorates on research grants (which are mostly Ph.D.
holders), the number of all clinicians (medical doctors, as
well as those with other health professional doctorates) on
NRSA grants and other grants was about equal (2319 and
2210, respectively).
Study limitations
In its first year of implementation, the information sub-
mitted on the All Personnel Report was not electronically
validated at the time of submission. Thus, some of the
reported data may have been incomplete or inaccurate.
Errors encountered in the course of this study include PIs
being classified to another role(2%)ornotbeing included
on the All Personnel Report (0.4%), non-PIs being
reported as PIs (9% of reported PIs on the All Personnel
Reports), and duplicate birth dates being provided for all
individuals on the same report. Steps were taken to remedy
these errors, including using supplemental information
from IMPAC II, where possible. Data from IMPAC II rather
than the All Personnel Report were used to fully enumerate
PIs, fellows, and trainees, and to identify and recode the
persons who were misclassified as PIs on the report.
Missing demographic data also made it difficult to
identify individuals who devoted effort to more than 1 NIH
grant in FY 2009. Overcoming this problem required the
construction of a complicated de-duplication algorithm. A
standardized unique researcher ID would have saved
much effort and increased the ability to accurately identify
and quantify research personnel. Current efforts under
way to develop and promote the adoption of unique, per-
sistent researcherIDs such as the Federal-Wide Researcher
Profile Project [also known as Science Experts Network
(SciENcv)] (23) and the Open Researcher and Contribu-
tor ID (ORCID) (24), when implemented, will make it
much easier in the future to identify persons associated
with multiple grants.
Processing the paper-based progress reports presented
specific challenges and proved time consuming. Although
paper-based reports comprised only 11% of total FY 2009
projects, they represented 37% of extracted roles, because
they included complex grant mechanisms, which are
composed of multiple projects and, in turn, require more
staff to conduct the research. The OCR technology used to
extract information from the paper-based forms produced
data that required heavy data cleaning, especially because
the de-duplication algorithm that translated positions to
unique persons relied on matched data, and could not tol-
erate common OCRerrors, such asinterpreting a numerical
zero as the letter “O.” These problems should be eliminated
in future enumeration studies, as NIH transitions to the
Research Performance Progress Report, which is electroni-
cally submitted and includes structured data fields.
Degrees and many occupational position titles were re-
ported as free text, requiring a manual review to code them
into standard, analyzable categories. The sheer volume and
variation of the degrees, professional certifications and po-
sitions titles may have resulted in some misclassification (e.g.,

 graduate student research assistants or postdoctoral staff
supported by research grants reported only as “research as-
sistants”weremisclassifiedtotheResearchSupportcategory,
rather than to the Training and Related category).
Finally, this study was intended to be a census, but there
were significant amounts of data missing, because of the
28% of projects for which there was not an available All
Personnel Report. To provide estimates for grants without
All Personnel Reports, personnel records were imputed
using existing data. There were significant differences in
the grant mechanisms supporting imputed and non-
imputed projects, however, and therefore differences in
direct cost dollars and type of grantee institution as well.
SBIR/STTR projects were most likely to require imputa-
tion. In contrast,none of the training and fellowship grants
(Ts and Fs) needed imputation, because of separate data
collection requirements. As a result of these systematic
differences, we used both activity code and direct cost
dollars in the imputation to ensure that we would not
overestimate the position counts for the imputed projects.
Demographic characteristics, such as the geographic re-
gion of the PI’s institution, did not vary between imputed
and nonimputed projects. However, almost all of the
missing data were from projects in the last year of funding,
as All Personnel Reports are not required in the final grant
report. We assumed that grant staffing levels were constant
acrosstheyearsoftheproject.Ifstaffing levelswereactually
lower (or higher) in the final year of an NIH-funded
project, the imputed figures may be overestimates (or
underestimates).
Positions were imputed using the direct cost dollars,
position type, and activity code. It is possible that a
person contributed to both imputed and nonimputed
projects during FY 2009. We did not assume all imputed
positions to be filled by persons not yet in our sample.
Instead, we used the position:person ratio by position
type from the existing data records to add the fraction of
new persons that could be expected from the imputed
projects. This strategy allowed for a reliable estimate of
the overall number of persons associated with NIH
grants in FY 2009, but did not allow for imputation of
individual characteristics of the persons associated with
imputed projects. As a result, the estimates for personal
information such as age and educational attainment
were based on the available, nonimputed sample.
Despite these limitations, this study represents a sub-
stantial advance over previous efforts to enumerate the
NIH-supported extramural workforce, in that it is based on
actual information reported by PIs and their institutions
and provides estimates of all positions created and sup-
ported by NIH grant funding. Furthermore, until all of the
data necessary to characterize the NIH-associated extra-
mural workforce are available electronically, the detailed
data produced here can be used to project the size of the
NIH-associated workforce in FYs beyond 2009.
CONCLUSIONS
In this first-ever census of the NIH-funded biomedical
workforce, we found that in FY 2009, NIH funded 50,885
grant projects, creating 313,049 full- and part-time posi-
tions spanning all job functions involved in biomedical
research. These positions were staffed by 247,457 people at
2,604 institutions, and devoted 121,465 PYE to NIH grant-
supported research. Projections for FYs 2010–2014 in-
dicate that the NIH-funded biomedical workforce has
remained relatively stable, despite declines in total direct
costs. Although postdoctorates and students filled ;20%
of positions in FY 2009, they contributed the largest
amount of effort to the projects, almost 40% of all PYE.
Most of these students and early career scientists were
supported through positions on NIH research grants,
rather than NRSA training grants and fellowships. At the
postdoctoral level, most positions on NIH research grants
were filled by persons on temporary resident visas, high-
lighting the high concentration of newly trained foreign
scientists making contributions to biomedical research in
the United States.
FUTURE RESEARCH
Interest in understanding the biomedical research work-
force continues to mount. In 2011, a working group of the
NIH Advisory Committee to the Director was created and
tasked with “developing a model for a sustainable and di-
verse U.S. biomedical research workforce that can inform
decisions about training the optimal number of people for
the appropriate types of positions that will advance science

 and promote health” (3). One of the working group’s key
findings was a lack of comprehensive data on biomedical
researchers. As the first detailed census of the workforce
devoting effort to NIH research grants, this study should
begin to fill the data gaps and serve as a foundation for
future efforts to characterize the extramural biomedical
research community and strengthen the evidence base for
future biomedical workforce policies.
