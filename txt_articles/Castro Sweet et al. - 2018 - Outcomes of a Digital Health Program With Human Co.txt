Abstract
Objective: To examine the outcomes of a Medicare population who 
participated in a program combining digital health with human coaching for 
diabetes risk reduction. Method: People at risk for diabetes enrolled in a 
program combining digital health with human coaching. Participation and 
health outcomes were examined at 16 weeks and 6 and 12 months. Results: 
A total of 501 participants enrolled; 92% completed at least nine of 16 core 
lessons. Participants averaged 19 of 31 possible opportunities for weekly 
program engagement. At 12 months, participants lost 7.5% (SD = 7.8%) of 
initial body weight; among participants with clinical data, glucose control 
improved (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] change = −0.14%, p = .001) and

total cholesterol decreased (−7.08 mg/dL, p = .008). Self-reported well-being, 
depression, and self-care improved (p < .0001). Discussion: This Medicare 
population demonstrated sustained program engagement and improved 
weight, health, and well-being. The findings support digital programs with 
human coaching for reducing chronic disease risk among older adults.

Introduction
Obesity and obesity-related conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease pose serious health and economic challenges to Americans and the 
U.S. health care system. The prevalence of obesity continues to trend upward, 
with current obesity rates at 35% for men and 40% for women (Flegal, 
Kruszon-Moran, Carroll, Fryar, & Ogden, 2016). Excess body weight is con-
sistently implicated in increased morbidity and mortality (Global BMI 
Mortality Collaboration, 2016), as well as significantly higher medical costs 
(Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, & Dietz, 2009). Obesity and obesity-related 
conditions are of particular concern for the growing older adult population. 
The number of Americans above the age of 65 is projected to increase from 
40.2 million to 88.5 million between 2010 and 2050 (Vincent & Velkoff, 
2010). At least 66% of the population above the age of 65 currently meets 
criteria for overweight or obesity, and 51% are at risk of type 2 diabetes 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014; U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2014). Projections indicate that Medicare spending could be reduced 
by US$3.0 billion to US$3.7 billion over 10 years if mild weight loss mod-
eled at 4.2% is achieved among at-risk older adults before they develop dia-
betes or cardiovascular disease (Thorpe & Yang, 2011).
In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and 
American College of Endocrinology released their first clinical practice 
guidelines on the medical care of patients with obesity (Garvey et al., 2016). 
These guidelines recommend patients with overweight or obesity and with 
either prediabetes or metabolic syndrome identified to be a high risk of type 
2 diabetes be treated with lifestyle therapy to prevent progression to diabetes 
(Grade A evidence). These evidence-based recommendations align with 
extensive research documenting the impact of weight loss through healthful 
eating patterns and regular physical activity on reducing the risk of diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease (Knowler et al., 2002; LeBlanc, O’Connor, 
 694 
Journal of Aging and Health 30(5)
Whitlock, Patnode, & Kapka, 2011; LeFevre et al., 2014). Behavioral coun-
seling programs that include consistent, regular interaction with a health 
coach and a combination of education, support, and skill building have been 
proven effective for reducing chronic disease risks associated with excess 
weight (LeFevre et al., 2014). The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was 
the first large-scale trial to demonstrate the efficacy of intensive behavioral 
counseling to reduce weight and diabetes disease risk. Older participants 
(aged 60+) in the DPP had the best outcomes from weight loss and risk reduc-
tion in the lifestyle modification arm, suggesting that this method of weight 
reduction and disease prevention is especially effective for older adults 
(Crandall et al., 2006; Delahanty et al., 2013).
Traditionally, intensive behavioral counseling programs have been deliv-
ered in an in-person format with individual or group face-to-face interactions 
between the health coach and participant. More recently, digital methods of 
lifestyle modification with human coaching have emerged as effective and 
scalable options to provide intensive behavioral counseling when face-to-
face or in-person programs are not accessible or attractive (Azar et al., 2016; 
McTigue et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2016). These remotely delivered programs 
retain the essential elements of behavioral counseling, including a high level 
of interaction with a remotely accessible health coach, group-oriented sup-
port, paced educational components, and skill building for health behavior 
change. At the same time, technology-enabled programs can be delivered 
asynchronously and on demand, providing flexibility and increased accessi-
bility for those whom fixed, location-based services are impractical (Sepah, 
Jiang, & Peters, 2014, 2015). The remote access to a live health coach is an 
especially important component, as programs without access to a live coach 
have been deemed to have insufficient evidence to support their widespread 
use (Tice et al., 2016).
Many studies on intensive behavioral counseling for diabetes prevention in 
older adults focus on the more traditional group-based, face-to-face setting, and 
demonstrate that older adults can engage in and obtain significant weight loss 
from programs modeled after the original DPP (Brokaw et al., 2015; Crandall 
et al., 2006; Hinnant et al., 2015; Office of the Actuary, 2016). Few efforts have 
explored the feasibility and effectiveness of using technology to deliver DPPs 
specifically for older adults. Some studies of technology-enhanced interven-
tions have included older adults among the sampled age groups (Block et al., 
2015; McTigue et al., 2009; Tate, Jackvony, & Wing, 2003), yet only one study 
focused specifically on an older population for their Internet-based intervention 
(Azar et al., 2016). Given the successes that older adults have had with in-per-
son DPP and the increasing uptake of Internet and computer use among this age 
group (Pew Research Center, 2014), Internet-based delivery of intensive

behavioral counseling has the potential to be effective with this particular seg-
ment of the population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (a) 
examine older adults’ ability to engage in an online/digital health program with 
human coaching and (b) examine the impact of the program on biometrics and 
patient-reported outcomes among people with Medicare insurance at risk of 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Method
Study Design and Participant Enrollment
This study utilized a single-arm pretest/posttest design. We analyzed retro-
spective, longitudinal, observational data from people with Humana Medicare 
Advantage insurance who participated in an Internet-based DPP that con-
sisted of a combination of web/mobile intervention and live human coaching. 
Participants had prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome according to admin-
istrative medical claims and/or laboratory data; people with evidence of diag-
nosed diabetes were ineligible and were excluded from the study. The at-risk 
population was contacted through direct mail, email, and automated tele-
phone calls to inform them of their potential eligibility for the program as a 
benefit of their health insurance plan. A 3-week marketing campaign (one 
direct mail and automated phone call campaign in Week 1, direct mail + 
phone + email in Weeks 2 and 3) was implemented twice. The first campaign 
started in December 2014 messaging 5,014 high risk individuals, with a sec-
ond cohort of 4,484 messaged in June 2015. Interested people were invited to 
visit a customized website to confirm their eligibility and enroll in the pro-
gram. A total of 9,498 individuals were contacted, with 796 responding for a 
response rate of 8.4%. From these, 101 were deemed ineligible either due to 
medical contraindications or insurance coverage, and another 190 started but 
did not finish the enrollment process. The enrollment period spanned January 
2015 to December 2015, until at least 500 participants were enrolled.
Participants had to meet the following eligibility criteria to enroll in the 
program: evidence of metabolic syndrome using administrative medical 
claims (based on metabolic syndrome diagnosis or a combination of three of 
four of the following diagnoses: prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and 
obesity), or evidence of prediabetes alone using claims or laboratory blood 
tests indicative of prediabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] between 
5.7% and 6.4%), or an eligible high score on a validated diabetes risk screener 
(the American Diabetes Association Risk Test, CDC Screening Test). Once 
eligibility was confirmed, participants were asked to complete an online 
social profile to be shared with their program health coach and peer group.

A summary of measures used for this study can be found in Table 1. Electronic 
surveys were administered to participants at program enrollment and at Week 16 
to collect self-reported measures of well-being, psychological distress, and self-
care behaviors. Program usage was continuously monitored by the software 
platform and connected devices. Medical records were reviewed for relevant 
biomarkers for the 6 months before the program began (baseline), within 3 
months before or after the 6-month mark (6-month time point), and for 3 months 
after the conclusion of the program (12-month time point). Institutional review 
board (IRB) approval was obtained from Schulman IRB for the research.

online small group support, personalized health coaching, digital tracking 
tools, and a weekly behavior change curriculum, which was approved by 
the CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (Albright & Gregg, 
2013). Participants were matched into geographically based small groups 
with an assigned health coach and they began the program at the same 
time. Group members were connected to each other through a private 
online social forum where they could post comments and questions, 
engage in health coach–moderated discussions, and provide social sup-
port to one another.
Using Internet-enabled devices (laptop, tablet, or smartphone), pro-
gram participants were able to asynchronously complete weekly interac-
tive curriculum lessons. A new lesson was accessible each week; this 
allowed members of the group to focus on the same topic and learning 
module at the same time. The lessons were designed to take approxi-
mately 1 hr to complete, and consisted of reading content, interactive 
games or exercises, and written reflections and goal-setting activities in 
relation to the weekly topic. Some content was posted to the group board 
(with appropriate permissions), and more private reflections were shared 
with the coach.
The health coaches were employed by the company, had a minimum of a 
bachelor’s degree, and underwent specialized training in delivery and support 
of DPP-oriented curriculum. Coaches monitored the lesson completion of 
participants and had access to each person’s lesson reflections. They also 
monitored participants’ personal tracking information (weight, eating, and 
activity tracking) and group discussion posts. Coaches proactively reached 
out to participants to support lesson completion, tracking, and weigh-ins. In 
addition to this coach-initiated contact, health coaches responded to partici-
pant requests for individual counseling through a variety of channels (phone 
call, private message, video call). Coaches also facilitated group discussion 
about the weekly curriculum lessons and responded to questions on the group 
board.
Throughout the program, participants tracked weight loss using a wireless 
scale, tracked physical activity using a pedometer, and logged their daily food 
intake with either the mobile app or online platform. These tools immediately 
displayed on the participant’s dashboard and were used to help participants 
self-monitor their habits and weight loss progress. The program was inclu-
sive of an initial 16-week intensive curriculum focusing on weight loss and a 
subsequent 36-week curriculum focusing on weight maintenance, for a total 
of 12 months of educational lessons. Participants engaged with health coach-
ing, small group discussion, and tracking of body weight/food/physical activ-
ity throughout the 12 months and beyond.

Program participation. The program software platform captured multiple 
points of program contact: logins on the website, opening of the mobile 
app, completion of curriculum lessons (paced at a weekly cadence), inter-
actions with the health coach and the group discussion forum, use of digi-
tal tools to track food intake and physical activity, and weigh-ins on the 
wirelessly connected weight scale. A composite score summarizing pro-
gram engagement was calculated from the combination of these different 
points of contact (see Table 1). As participants were encouraged to login 
to the website, step on the weight scale, and log meals and physical activ-
ity at least once per day, a daily maximum score of one engagement per 
day and seven engagements per week were allotted to those four actions to 
prevent overinflation of these metrics (score range of 0-4 per item, 0-28 
total). Curriculum lessons were expected to be completed at a maximum of 
one lesson per week; this element was allotted a score of 0 (zero) if it was 
not completed during a week, or 1 if a lesson was completed. Health coach 
interactions and group discussions were not expected at any specific fre-
quency; therefore, these elements were allotted a score of 0 (zero) if they 
did not occur at all during a week, or 1 (one) if one or more engagements 
happened during a week (score range of 0 or 1 per item, 0-2 total). Thus, 
the composite score contained a minimum value of 0 and a maximum 
value of 31 points of engagement per week.
Biometrics. Participants received a wireless weight scale (BodyTrace, Inc., 
New York, NY) registered and linked to their online program account. Par-
ticipants were encouraged to weigh themselves at the same time of day, 
preferably in the morning, every day before eating or dressing. If a partici-
pant went more than 3 days without using the scale, notifications were sent 
to encourage them to weigh themselves. The scale automatically transmitted 
weights to the program database using the cellular Global System for Mobile 
communication (GSM) network. The scale arrived prior to the start of the 
program to allow users to record an initial weight before they met their 
group and received the first lesson. The participant’s weight that was cap-
tured before they accessed the first week’s curriculum was used as the initial 
starting weight. Weight changes were calculated as the percent reduction of 
initial weight at the following time points: (a) the end of the intensive cur-
riculum phase at Week 16, (b) midway through the year at Week 26 (the 
6-month time point), and (c) at the end of the year at Week 52 (the 12-month 
time point). All participants (n = 501) had reached 16 weeks and 6 months 
of the program at the time of data analysis, and 86% (n = 433) of the total 
 Castro Sweet et al. 
699
sample had completed 12 months of the program and were included in those 
specific analyses.
Data on glucose control and lipids were collected from the participants’ 
laboratory results. Latest available measures documented in the health 
records that were collected within 6 months prior to the start of the interven-
tion were included as baseline measures. Latest available measures docu-
mented within 3 months from Week 26 of the program were used as 6-month 
posttest measure. Latest available measures documented within 3 months 
from Week 52 of the program were used as 12-month posttest measure. 
HbA1c was used as the biometric marker for prediabetes, and total choles-
terol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides 
were used as markers for dyslipidemia.
Patient-reported outcomes. Measures of well-being, psychological distress, 
and self-care behaviors were collected through an online survey prior to the 
start of the program. At the conclusion of the 16-week intensive phase of the 
program, an optional follow-up survey was sent electronically to participants 
for completion. The follow-up survey is a routine business practice for col-
lecting feedback on the program and is not required from participants as an 
obligation for receipt of the service. As this was an observational study and 
not a prospective study design, data on those with complete pre- and posttest 
surveys were used for analyses.
The World Health Organization–5 (WHO-5) Well-Being Index is a widely 
used and validated measure of subjective well-being (Topp, Ostergaard, 
Sondergaard, & Bech, 2015). The respondents were asked to rate how well 
each of five statements applied to him or her on a scale of 0 (none of the time) 
to 5 (all the time) over the past 2 weeks. The sum of the five items is scored 
in a range of 0 to 25, with higher scores indicating greater well-being.
The Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) is 
a four-item short screener for depression and anxiety that can be self-admin-
istered (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Lowe, 2009). PHQ-4 scores are 
strongly associated with the degree of functional impairment, number of dis-
ability days, and health care utilization (Kroenke et al., 2009). Respondents 
rated how often they were bothered by four items over the past 2 weeks on a 
scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), with higher scores indicating 
more distress. The total PHQ-4 score is calculated as the sum of all four items 
with scores classified as normal (0-2), mild (3-5), moderate (6-8), and severe 
(9-12). Subscale scores are calculated as the sum of two items for depression 
and two for anxiety.
The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) scale is a brief 
self-report measure of self-management behaviors related to diabetes 
 700 
Journal of Aging and Health 30(5)
(Toobert, Hampson, & Glasgow, 2000). Respondents rated their frequency of 
engaging in specific behaviors for the past 7 days. Six items of the original 
11-item scale were selected to capture engagement in a healthy diet (two 
items), consumption of fruits and vegetables (one item), consumption of high 
fat foods (one item), and engagement in physical activity (two items).
Statistical Analysis
Baseline descriptive statistics of the population were examined with means and 
standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages 
for categorical variables. Program engagement composite scores were calcu-
lated as the sum of points of engagement during the week. An average weekly 
engagement score was calculated for each participant by dividing the summed 
weekly scores by the 16 weeks of participation during the intensive phase of the 
program. Weight loss was calculated as percent change from initial weight to 
Week 16, 6 months, and 12 months. Weight loss results were analyzed sepa-
rately for the following categories: (a) all participants regardless of level of pro-
gram completion and (b) participants who completed four or more lessons. This 
categorical distinction was created to correspond to the CDC Diabetes Prevention 
Recognition Program Standards for data analysis (CDC, 2015). Change in 
weight as a percentage of initial weight was calculated between time points with 
paired-comparison t tests. Participants with missing baseline weight (n = 35) 
were excluded from weight loss analysis. Change in self-reported measures for 
the WHO-5, PHQ-4, and SDSCA were also examined with paired-comparison t 
tests for the subset of participants who completed the optional survey at both 
baseline and Week 16 (n = 285). Pre–post differences in the subset of partici-
pants with available health record information on glucose control and lipids 
were analyzed with paired t tests.
Results
A description of the analyzed sample is included in Table 2. The average age 
of participants was 68.8 years (SD = 2.58). The majority of participants were 
women (64%) and of Caucasian racial identity (60%). On average, partici-
pants were obese with a baseline body mass index (BMI) of 33.6 kg/m2. 
Participants were enrolled from 37 states.
Program Participation
Of the 501 people who enrolled in the online program, 95% completed at 
least four of the weekly educational lessons, and 92% completed nine or 
 Castro Sweet et al. 
701
more lessons. Less than 2% failed to complete at least one lesson in the first 
16 weeks of the program. Table 1 shows the weekly average points of pro-
gram contact, as well as the average composite score. Weigh-ins on the wire-
less scale (average 5.56 times per week) and completion of curriculum 
lessons (average of 0.90 per week) had the highest participation for daily and 
weekly measured metrics, respectively. Using the normalized composite 
score, participants scored an average of 19 (SD = 8.21) out of a possible 31 
points of engagement on a weekly basis through a combination of online 
logins, weigh-ins on the connected scale, behavior tracking, health coach 
interaction, group discussion, and lesson completion during the intensive 
phase of the program (see Table 1).
Biometrics
Weight was examined for all participants, and among those who completed 
four or more lessons to correspond to the CDC standards for analyzing out-
comes (CDC, 2015). As almost all participants (95%) completed more than 
four lessons, the outcomes did not differ when we analyzed the whole sample 
versus those who completed more than four lessons; therefore, outcomes 
based on the full sample are presented (see Figure 1). Participants lost a sig-
nificant amount of weight between baseline and each of the follow-up time 
periods (see Table 2). Participants lost an average of 6.5% (SD = 4.0) of ini-
tial body weight at 16 weeks, when the intensive phase of the program ended. 
Their weight loss increased to 8.0% (SD = 7.7) of initial body weight at the 
6-month mark. Among the 86% of the participants who completed a full year 
of the program by the time of data analysis, they maintained a 7.5% (SD = 
7.8) reduction in initial weight at 12 months. In absolute terms, participants 
lost an average of 13 to 14 pounds (from a starting weight of 208 pounds) 
over the course of 12 months. The weight change was significant from

baseline to 16 weeks (p = .001), from baseline to 6 months (p = .001), and 
from baseline to 12 months (p = .001).
Only a subsample of participants had laboratory test values for blood glu-
cose and/or lipids available at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months; results are 
presented for those participants with available laboratory data. A total of 69 
participants had available HbA1c results prior to program commencement 
and within the 12-month window. These participants had significant reduc-
tion in HbA1c by a magnitude of 0.14% absolute decrease at 6 months and 12 
months (p = .0001; see Table 3). Approximately, 130 participants had avail-
able lipids values for each of the time points. Differences in pre- and post-
measurements were statistically significant for total cholesterol, with a mean 
reduction of −12.92 mg/dL (p = .0001; see Table 3) at Month 6 and −7.08 mg/
dL (p = .008; see Table 2) at the 12-month mark from baseline.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
The 16-week self-report survey was optional. Fifty-seven percent (n = 285) 
of participants provided follow-up surveys and contributed data on well-
being and mental health. Among the 285 who responded, a significant change 
over time was observed in the WHO-5 Well-Being Index and PHQ-4 Mental

Health indicators (see Table 4). Scores on the WHO-5 Well-Being Index 
improved by 12% (p = .0001). Although the overall PHQ-4 score improved 
from baseline to 16 weeks (p = .002), analysis of the PHQ-4 subscales 
revealed that the significant change was specifically for the depression items 
(p = .0001), with no significant change observed in the anxiety items (p = 
.19). Each of the six self-care items on the SDSCA significantly improved in 
the expected direction, with healthful behaviors increasing and unhealthful 
behaviors (e.g., high fat food consumption) decreasing.
Discussion
The results of this observational study indicate that in this Medicare popula-
tion, the individuals who were interested in and willing to attempt to use the 
digital program were able to meaningfully engage with it. Participants 
achieved high levels of interaction with the digital program features. A high 
percentage of program enrollees completed the majority of the educational 
curriculum lessons delivered to them during the core 16 weeks of the pro-
gram. These participation rates demonstrate that older adults can successfully 
use online technology and engage with digital health programs.
Participants lost 8.0% of their initial body weight at 6 months and 7.5% at 
12 months. This level of weight loss exceeds the benchmark set by the CDC’s 
National Diabetes Prevention Program, which aims for a 5% reduction in 
weight at 6 months and 12 months (CDC, 2015). The magnitude of weight 
loss seen among the participants is commensurate with the weight changes

seen in older adults in the original DPP, which was a high-cost, face-to-face, 
and one-on-one intervention (Crandall et al., 2006). The observed weight loss 
in this study also exceeds that found in a recent national dissemination trial of 
an in-person, face-to-face format, which achieved 4.7% to 5.2% weight loss 
over 12 months (Hinnant et al., 2015). Although observational, the data from 
the current analysis strongly suggest that the digital format with human 
coaching was successful for encouraging meaningful and sustained weight 
loss in older adults. While this study did not seek to compare digital with in-
person programs, or digital with human coaching to fully automated pro-
grams, these findings add to the body of data supporting the use of digital 
DPP platforms that have coaching delivered by live, trained coaches (as 
opposed to fully automated programs; Tice et al., 2016).
Although fewer data were available to examine biometric markers of 
chronic disease risk, program enrollment was associated with modest 
improvement in glucose control, as indicated by the reduction in HbA1c. A

prior study in a large integrated health system found that weight loss is sig-
nificantly associated with HbA1c less than 7.0% (McAdam-Marx et al., 
2014). Participation in the program was also associated with significant 
improvement in overall well-being and mental health indicators. These indi-
rect benefits of program participation are highly relevant to successful aging, 
as well-being and psychological health have a profound impact on older 
adults (Steptoe, Deaton, & Stone, 2015). Positive improvements in well-
being and psychological health for older adults are important for preserving 
overall health and preventing the onset of disease as people age.
The findings of positive improvements in self-care activities among the 
respondents of the survey suggest that the program successfully modified the 
targeted health behaviors as intended: improving eating and physical activity 
patterns. The program increased both the number of days of healthful eating and 
regular physical activity, and reduced the frequency of consumption of high fat 
foods. At baseline, participants on average were not meeting national guidelines 
from the Department of Health and Human Services for physical activity most 
days of the week (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008), but 
at 16 weeks, they were achieving these recommendations.
Although the results are encouraging, the study has methodological limi-
tations. First, the observational design of the study introduces selection bias 
into the findings. The sample was likely to be more motivated to participate, 
may have had better access to technology (as that was a requirement for par-
ticipation), and was limited to Medicare Advantage enrollees. This sample 
may not be generalizable to the full population of older adults. Although the 
possibility of selection bias cannot be ruled out, this was a sizable, real-world 
application of the program and is likely to reflect the performance of the pro-
gram under real-world operating conditions. The fact that the program could 
reach participants simultaneously across 37 states with a digital platform and 
live human coaching speaks to the scalability of this approach.
An additional limitation is the lack of a control group, which limits our 
ability to determine the true treatment effect over time. In addition, only a 
small proportion of participants had laboratory test results available (HbA1c 
= 14%, lipid panel = 27%). It is likely that participants with values for these 
biomarkers differ in some way (medically, behaviorally, etc.) from those par-
ticipants who did not have available data in their health records. Although it 
is recommended that adults at risk of type 2 diabetes get screened and 
rescreened annually with clinician-ordered blood tests for abnormal glucose 
control, the timing at which the testing and retesting is performed is variable 
at the individual level (Siu et al., 2015). Thus, variability in clinical practice 
could have contributed to the lack of data that corresponded to the time points 
of this study. Despite these limitations, the improvement in HbA1c observed 
 706 
Journal of Aging and Health 30(5)
in the subsample is encouraging and should be replicable with more complete 
data. Furthermore, the weight loss achieved by this sample is consistent with 
the magnitude of weight loss that was associated with improved glucose con-
trol and reduced diabetes rates in the original DPP study (Knowler et al., 
2002). A final limitation was the data missing on the patient-reported out-
comes (43%). It is possible that participants who had more perceptible differ-
ences in their mood and overall feelings of well-being were more likely to 
follow through with completing the postprogram questionnaire.
The digital program used in this study is currently commercially avail-
able and in use. These results support the clinical validity of the program 
with Medicare-eligible, at-risk, older adults. Additional research is needed 
(including prospective studies) to further validate the program in a variety 
of populations, and replicate the findings. Future studies that can effec-
tively determine the relative contribution of each of the program compo-
nents (coaching, lessons, group support) will be useful for further refining 
and optimizing programs to most effectively shape participants’ habits 
over time. As all DPP-based programs are expected to include the core 
DPP components to meet requirements for CDC recognition (Albright & 
Gregg, 2013), we did not isolate specific components to test their inde-
pendent or additive effects. More research is needed to better understand 
the dynamic relationships between components and determine how they 
work independently and in combination to change behaviors and induce 
weight loss.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that older adults who agreed to 
participate in this program were able to engage meaningfully and gain 
important health and wellness benefits during a relatively short time frame. 
These findings are encouraging given recent recommendations that life-
style-based DPPs (either in person or online) be made available to older 
adults (Tice et al., 2016) and be added as a covered benefit for Medicare 
beneficiaries from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Hinnant 
et al., 2015; Office of the Actuary, 2016). The results from this study are 
added evidence that chronic disease risk reduction is achievable through a 
variety of modalities, including digital-based programs with human coach-
ing. With the added advantage of accessibility and scalability, digital pro-
grams with human coaching should be an important part of the 
comprehensive health improvement solution for chronic disease risk 
reduction for older adults.
