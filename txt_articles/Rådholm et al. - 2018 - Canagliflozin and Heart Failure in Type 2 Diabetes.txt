BACKGROUND: Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor 
that reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. We report the effects on heart 
failure (HF) and cardiovascular death overall, in those with and without a 
baseline history of HF, and in other participant subgroups.
METHODS: The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular 
Assessment Study) enrolled 10 
142 participants with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and high cardiovascular risk. Participants were randomly assigned 
to canagliflozin or placebo and followed for a mean of 188 weeks. The 
primary end point for these analyses was adjudicated cardiovascular death 
or hospitalized HF.
RESULTS: Participants with a history of HF at baseline (14.4%) were more 
frequently women, white, and hypertensive and had a history of prior 
cardiovascular disease (all P<0.001). Greater proportions of these patients 
were using therapies such as blockers of the renin angiotensin aldosterone 
system, diuretics, and β-blockers at baseline (all P<0.001). Overall, 
cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF was reduced in those treated with 
canagliflozin compared with placebo (16.3 versus 20.8 per 1000 patient-
years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67–0.91), as 
was fatal or hospitalized HF (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.89) and hospitalized 
HF alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.87). The benefit on cardiovascular 
death or hospitalized HF may be greater in patients with a prior history 
of HF (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.80) compared with those without HF at 
baseline (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72–1.06; P interaction =0.021). The effects 
of canagliflozin compared with placebo on other cardiovascular outcomes 
and key safety outcomes were similar in participants with and without HF 
at baseline (all interaction P values >0.130), except for a possibly reduced 
absolute rate of events attributable to osmotic diuresis among those with a 
prior history of HF (P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an 
elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, canagliflozin reduced the risk of 
cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF across a broad range of different 
patient subgroups. Benefits may be greater in those with a history of HF 
at baseline.

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a sub-
stantial risk of cardiovascular and renal disease, 
including heart failure (HF).1–3 HF in diabetes mel-
litus is attributed to macrovascular and microvascular 
dysfunction, volume overload, impaired renal func-
tion, and direct effects of diabetes mellitus and insulin 
resistance on cardiac myocytes.4–7 Mortality outcomes 
for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and HF are 
worse than for patients with either of the diseases 
alone, with a median survival of just 4 years.8 Before 
the introduction of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors, treatment with glucose-lowering 
agents has not been shown to reduce HF hospitaliza-
tion,9 and there is evidence of increased risks of HF in 
some trials of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors10,11 and 
the thiazolidinedione class.9 Two landmark clinical tri-
als using inhibitors of SGLT2—EMPA-REG OUTCOME12 
and the CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascu-
lar Assessment Study)13—have demonstrated reduc-
tions in the risk of hospitalization for HF, with ben-
efits of empagliflozin reported across a broad range 
of patient groups.14 The present analyses explored in 
further detail the effects of canagliflozin on HF and 
determined the effects of canagliflozin on a range of 
efficacy and safety outcomes among CANVAS Pro-
gram participants with and without a history of HF at 
baseline.
METHODS
Program Design
The study design, characteristics of participants, and main results 
of the CANVAS Program have previously been published.13,15 
In brief, the CANVAS Program, comprising the 2 similarly 
designed and conducted trials, CANVAS and CANVAS-R 
(CANVAS-Renal), was designed to assess the cardiovascular 
and renal safety and efficacy of canagliflozin compared with 
placebo, and also assess how any potential benefits might 
balance against risks. In total, 667 centers in 30 countries 
were involved in the 2 trials that were scheduled for joint 
closeout and analysis when ≥688 cardiovascular events and 
≥78 weeks of follow-up had been accrued for the last ran-
domized participant, which occurred in February 2017. A 
complete list of investigators and committees in the CANVAS 
Program is provided in the Appendix in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Data from the CANVAS Program will be made 
available in the public domain via the Yale University Open 
Data Access Project (http://yoda.yale.edu/) once the product 
and relevant indication studied have been approved by regu-
lators in the United States and European Union and the study 
has been completed for 18 months. The trial protocols and 
statistical analysis plans were published along with the pri-
mary CANVAS Program article.13
Participants
Participants included in the CANVAS Program were men 
and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycohemoglo-
bin ≥7.0% and ≤10.5% and estimated glomerular filtration 
rate >30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Participants were also required 
to be either ≥30 years of age with a history of symptom-
atic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ≥50 years of 
age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular disease (dura-
tion of diabetes mellitus ≥10 years, systolic blood pressure 
>140 mm Hg while on ≥1 antihypertensive agents, current 
smoker, documented microalbuminuria or macroalbumin-
uria, or documented high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
<1 mmol/L). Patients with New York Association Class IV HF 
were excluded. The definition of HF at baseline was based 
on physician review of the patient’s medical history at the 
first visit, with no requirement for collection of diagnostic 
biomarkers or the conduct of echocardiography. All partici-
pants provided informed consent, and ethics approval was 
obtained for every center.
Randomization, Treatment, and 
Follow-Up
After a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, partici-
pants were randomized centrally through an interactive web 
response system using a computer-generated randomization 
schedule prepared by the study sponsor using randomly per-
muted blocks. Participants in CANVAS were assigned in a 
1:1:1 ratio to canagliflozin 300 mg, canagliflozin 100 mg, 
or matching placebo, and participants in CANVAS-R were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or matching 
placebo, administered at an initial dose of 100 mg daily with 
optional uptitration to 300 mg from week 13. Participants 
and all study and sponsor staff were masked to individual 
treatment allocations until the completion of the study. Use 
of other background therapy for glycemic management, 
treatment of HF, and other risk factor control was according 
to best practices instituted in line with local guidelines.
Participants were followed after randomization in a face-
to-face follow-up that was scheduled for 3 visits in the first 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor cana-
gliflozin reduced the risk of a range of composite 
and cause-specific heart failure (HF) outcomes.
• Benefits from canagliflozin may be greater in those 
with a history of HF.
• There was no evidence that patients with a history 
of HF were likely to suffer higher rates of adverse 
events from canagliflozin.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at risk of HF 
are particularly likely to benefit from treatment 
with canagliflozin.
• Beneficial effects of canagliflozin on HF outcomes 
are likely to be accrued on top of other therapies 
for HF management.

year and at 6-month intervals thereafter, with alternating 
telephone follow-up between face-to-face assessments. Every 
follow-up included inquiry about primary and secondary out-
come events and serious adverse events. Serum creatinine 
measurement with estimated glomerular filtration rate was 
performed at least every 26 weeks in both trials. Participants 
who prematurely discontinued study treatment continued 
scheduled follow-up wherever possible, with extensive efforts 
made to obtain full outcome data for all participants during 
the final follow-up window that spanned from November 
2016 to February 2017.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for these analyses was the composite 
of cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF. The detailed cri-
teria used to define outcomes are included in the Appendix 
in the online-only Data Supplement. Cardiovascular death 
included death resulting from an acute myocardial infarc-
tion, sudden cardiac death, death because of HF, death 
because of stroke, and death because of other cardiovas-
cular causes. Hospitalized HF was an event that required an 
admission to an inpatient unit or a visit to an emergency 
department, resulting in a ≥24-hour stay and ≥1 clinical 
symptoms of worsening HF, ≥2 physical signs of HF and a 
need for additional or increased therapy, and the absence 
of other noncardiac etiology or other cardiac etiology that 
might explain the presentation.
Secondary outcomes were fatal or hospitalized HF, fatal 
HF, hospitalized HF, the composite of major adverse cardio-
vascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, and nonfatal stroke), fatal or nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, all-cause mortality, 
and serious decline in kidney function (defined as a com-
posite of 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration 
rate sustained for ≥2 consecutive measures, the need for 
renal replacement therapy, or death from renal causes). The 
safety outcomes assessed were all serious adverse events 
and all adverse events leading to discontinuation, as well 
as amputation, fracture, osmotic diuresis–related adverse 
events (according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities preferred terms: increase in urine output such as 
polyuria, pollakiuria, micturition urgency and nocturia, as 
well as those related to thirst; polydipsia, dry mouth, throat 
dry, or tongue dry), and volume depletion–related adverse 
events. End point adjudication committees adjudicated all 
cardiovascular outcomes, renal outcomes, deaths, and frac-
tures. Fatal HF events were those with HF adjudicated as the 
proximate cause of death.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as the number of 
patients with corresponding percentages, and continuous 
variables were summarized as the mean and standard devi-
ation. Differences in baseline characteristics between par-
ticipants with a history of HF compared with participants 
with no history of HF were evaluated using a χ2 test for 
categorical variables, a t test for continuous normally dis-
tributed variables, and a Wilcoxon  
2-sample test for con-
tinuous variables with a skewed distribution (distributions 
were evaluated using an Anderson–Darling test).
Efficacy analyses were based on the full integrated data-
set and the intent-to-treat approach, with the comparison 
being between all participants assigned to canagliflozin 
(regardless of dose) and all participants assigned to pla-
cebo. Annualized incidence rates per 1000 patient-years 
of follow-up were calculated for all outcomes in addition 
to hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
determined from Cox regression models that included a 
trial stratification factor. Absolute risk differences for 1000 
patients over 5 years and corresponding 95% CIs were esti-
mated as the differences in the incidence rates between 
randomized treatment groups using a Poisson regression 
analysis with an assumption of constant annual event prob-
abilities.16 On-treatment analysis (based on patients who 
experienced a safety outcome while on study drug or in ≤30 
days of study drug discontinuation) was used for the safety 
outcomes, except for amputation and fracture, which were 
assessed using intent-to-treat analyses. For all outcome 
analyses, we tested the homogeneity of treatment effects 
across the 2 contributing trials using P values for interac-
tions based on the joint test in the Cox regression models, 
and the same approach was used for testing comparability 
of effects across subgroups defined by baseline participant 
characteristics. There was no formal statistical adjustment 
for multiple comparisons, and P values were interpreted in 
light of the many assessments made. Analysis of recurrent 
hospitalization for HF was assessed with an Andersen‒Gill 
model. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2, 
SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1, and STATA version 13.1.
RESULTS
There were 10 142 patients with type 2 diabetes mel-
litus in the CANVAS Program, and the mean follow-
up time was 188.2 weeks. Mean age was 63.3 years, 
35.8% of participants were women, the mean dura-
tion of diabetes mellitus was 13.5 years, and 65.6% 
had a history of cardiovascular disease. In addition, 
1461 (14.4%) participants reported a history of HF at 
baseline. These participants were significantly differ-
ent from the remaining participants in most aspects 
of demographics and disease history, in addition to 
exhibiting greater use of concomitant therapies used 
for the management of HF, including diuretics, re-
nin angiotensin aldosterone system blockers, and β-
blockers, but lower usage of statins and metformin (all 
P<0.001; Table). There were 203 cardiovascular deaths 
or hospitalized HF events recorded among those par-
ticipants who reported a history of HF at baseline and 
449 among those who did not.
Effects of Canagliflozin on HF Outcomes 
(Overall and in Patient Subgroups)
Compared with placebo, canagliflozin was associated 
with significantly lower risks of cardiovascular death or 
hospitalized HF (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91), fatal 
or hospitalized HF (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.89), as

(HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.49–1.60) for which there were 
few events and wide CIs (Figure 1). A subsidiary analysis 
of the primary outcome that accounted for competing 
mortality resulted in an HR estimate of 0.66 (95% CI, 
0.51–0.84). The benefit on cardiovascular death or hos-
pitalized HF was borderline significantly (P interaction 
=0.021) greater in patients with a prior history of HF 
(HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.80) compared with those 
without HF at baseline (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72–1.06; 
Figure 2). The absolute risk differences were –106.97 
(95% CI, –171.59 to –42.34) per 1000 patient-years for 
participants with a history of HF at baseline and –8.36 
(95% CI, –22.08 to 5.36) per 1000 patient-years for 
participants without a history of HF at baseline (P inter-
action =0.003).
Rates of HF varied according to baseline character-
istics such as age, renal function, and other disease 
history characteristics, but effects of canagliflozin on 
cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF were mostly 
comparable across participant subgroups (Figure 3). 
Nominally significant interaction was observed with 
respect to the cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF 
outcome for several subgroups, including patients with 
higher versus lower body mass index, lower versus high-
er baseline glycohemoglobin, with versus without back-
ground use of diuretic therapy, and with versus without 
background metformin use (all P interaction >0.02; Fig-
ure 3). Participants randomized to canagliflozin treat-
ment had less recurrent hospitalizations for HF during 
follow-up compared with participants assigned to pla-
cebo (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47–0.96). In the CANVAS 
trial, in which participants were assigned at random to 
placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, or canagliflozin 300 mg, 
there was no evidence that the effects on cardiovascu-
lar death or hospitalized HF varied by dose (100 mg ver-
sus placebo: HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65–1.03; and 300 mg 
versus placebo: HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65–1.03). Among 
the subset of participants who reported a history of HF 
and loop diuretic use at baseline (n=379), the HR for 
the primary outcome was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37–0.78).
Effects of Canagliflozin on 
Cardiovascular, Kidney, and Death 
Outcomes in Patients With and Without 
HF at Baseline
Proportional effects of canagliflozin compared with 
placebo were comparable in patients with and without 
HF at baseline for major adverse cardiovascular events, 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, all-
cause mortality, and serious decline in kidney function 
(all P interaction >0.160; Figure 2). Patients with a his-
tory of HF were at higher absolute risk of most out-
comes. Although the numeric values for risk differences 
were typically greater among participants with a history 
of HF compared with those without, none reached sta-
tistical significance (all P interaction >0.130).
Safety Outcomes
Compared with placebo, canagliflozin has established 
associations with increased risks of amputation, frac-
ture, and volume depletion, but there was no evidence 
of proportional differences in these risks between pa-
tients with and without HF at baseline (all P interaction 
>0.160; Figure 4). The absolute risk of osmotic diure-
sis-related events, another established risk of therapy, 
was significantly lower in patients with a history of HF 
compared with those without (P interaction =0.029; 
Figure 4).
DISCUSSION
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established 
cardiovascular disease or at high risk of cardiovascular 
events who were treated with canagliflozin experienced

hospitalized HF. Benefits may be greater in those with 
a history of HF compared with those without. Effects 
were apparent across a broad range of participant sub-
groups, including those using established treatments 
for the prevention of HF, such as blockade of the re-
nin angiotensin aldosterone system, diuretics, and β-
blockers.
Other cardiovascular outcomes and death gener-
ally occurred more frequently in patients with a history 
of HF compared with those without, but both sets of 
participants experienced comparable reductions in the 
risks of these outcomes with the use of canagliflozin. 
Labeled adverse effects of canagliflozin on amputa-
tion and fracture were comparable among patients 
with and without HF at baseline, but there were pos-
sibly lower absolute risks of adverse events related to 
osmotic diuresis among patients with HF. There was no 
statistical evidence that adverse events attributable to 
volume depletion or acute kidney injury were differen-
tially increased by treatment with canagliflozin in those 
with HF compared with those without HF, although CIs 
about estimates were wide.
The benefits for HF outcomes appeared early dur-
ing follow-up, suggesting a mode of action driven 
primarily by volume and hemodynamic effects. Re-
ductions in preload and afterload stemming from na-
triuresis,14 systemic blood pressure lowering,17 modi-
fication of the intrarenal renin angiotensin axis,18 and 
reduction in arterial stiffness19 may all contribute to 
the protection afforded. Preservation of renal func-
tion and the mitigation of volume overload achieved 
with SGLT2 inhibition also probably contributed to 
the observed reduction in HF risk. By contrast, anti-
atherosclerotic effects of SGLT2 inhibition mediated 
through effects on glucose, blood pressure, and obe-
sity are unlikely to have played a major role in the 
large and early benefit observed for this outcome.
There may also be direct positive effects of SGLT2 in-
hibition on cardiac metabolism that are attributable to a 
shift from fatty acids to ketone bodies as the substrate 
for myocardial energy generation. Metabolic studies 
have shown that the hypertrophied and failing heart 
uses ketone bodies as an alternate fuel source,20,21 and 
increased hepatic neogenesis of ketone bodies is an es-

tablished effect of SGLT2 inhibitors.22,23 Enhanced car-
diac efficiency may also be facilitated by increased oxy-
gen delivery resulting from SGLT2 inhibitor–associated 
hemoconcentration.18 Although the SGLT2 receptor is 
expressed primarily on the luminal surface of the proxi-
mal tubule in the kidney, there has been 1 report of 
SGLT2 expression in heart tissue.24
The findings reported here are strengthened by 
the rigorous design and conduct of the trial, the pre-
specification of HF as an outcome of interest, and the 
careful masked adjudication of all relevant events by 
an expert committee. Capturing the different modes 
of HF death as a separate cause-specific outcome is 
challenging and may underestimate the fatal disease 
burden attributable to HF. Accordingly, we selected 
the composite of cardiovascular death and hospital-
ized HF as the primary outcome because of its clini-
cal relevance while also reporting on other more 
narrowly defined outcomes incorporating events 
explicitly defined as HF death. The relatively few pri-
mary outcome events recorded limits the capacity to 
detect effects and makes difficult interpretation of 
borderline significant findings (eg, the interactions of 
canagliflozin treatment and HF prevention with base-
line characteristics, such as obesity and use of some 
drug therapies). Interpretation is further complicated 
by the overlap in these baseline characteristics across 
participant subgroups. The limited documentation of 
HF at baseline, and  
specifically the absence of sys-
tematically collected baseline biomarkers or echocar-
diography data, meant that the estimated prevalence 
of established HF was imperfect and there was likely 
some misclassification of patients according to the 
presence or absence of HF at baseline. It was also not 
possible to classify baseline HF according to preserva-
tion or reduction in ejection fraction. The low rates 
of loop diuretic use among patients with HF at base-
line suggests that most had nonsevere disease and 
raises additional uncertainty about the HF diagnoses 
at baseline in some patients.
The effects on HF observed within the CANVAS 
Program appear mostly comparable to those report-
ed for the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. An exception 
was the observation of a borderline significant great-
er proportional risk reduction for individuals with a 
history of HF at baseline in the CANVAS Program, 
Figure 2. Proportional and absolute effects of canagliflozin compared with placebo on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with and 
without a history of heart failure at baseline. 
*HR (canagliflozin compared to placebo) and its 95% CI are estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model including treatment as the explanatory variable. The 
model for CV death is stratified by prior CV disease subgroup and study. The models of renal endpoints are stratified for stage of baseline chronic kidney disease, 
measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60, ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and by study. †Serious decline in kidney function was defined as a 40% reduction in 
the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renal replacement therapy, or death from renal causes. ARD indicates absolute risk difference over 5 years; CI, 
confidence interval; HF, heart failure; and HR, hazard ratio.

which was not matched by a corresponding finding 
in the analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. 
This might reflect the different characteristics of the 
included populations or the slightly different criteria 
used to define HF outcomes between the 2 studies. 
However, the multiple and post hoc analyses of HF 
done for the CANVAS Program and EMPA-REG OUT-
COME had limited statistical power to test for inter-
actions, and the risk of missing real differences or 
observing spurious chance differences is high.
The CANVAS Program data provide clear evidence 
of the protective effects of canagliflozin on HF and, in 
conjunction with EMPA-REG OUTCOME, suggest an 
important role for SGLT2 inhibitors in the prevention 
of HF among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Additional data from ongoing trials in diabetes mel-
litus will further clarify the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors 
on this major cause of mortality and morbidity25,26 and

new trials specifically exploring mechanisms and test-
ing effects on HF outcomes among patients without 
diabetes mellitus27–30 will also provide further insight 
into the mode of action by which benefits are achieved. 
In conclusion, among patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, 
canagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death 
or hospitalized HF across a broad range of different 
patient groups and in addition to concomitant thera-
pies for HF. Benefits may be greater in patients with a 
baseline history of HF compared with those without a 
history of HF.
