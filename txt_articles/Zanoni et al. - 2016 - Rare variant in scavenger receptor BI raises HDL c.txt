Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is the major receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol (HDL-C). In humans, high amounts of HDL-C in plasma are associated with a
lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mice that have depleted Scarb1 (SR-BI
knockout mice) have markedly elevated HDL-C levels but, paradoxically, increased
atherosclerosis. The impact of SR-BI on HDL metabolism and CHD risk in humans remains
unclear. Through targeted sequencing of coding regions of lipid-modifying genes in 328
individuals with extremely high plasma HDL-C levels, we identified a homozygote for a loss-
of-function variant, in which leucine replaces proline 376 (P376L), in SCARB1, the gene
encoding SR-BI. The P376L variant impairs posttranslational processing of SR-BI and
abrogates selective HDL cholesterol uptake in transfected cells, in hepatocyte-like cells
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from the homozygous subject, and in mice.
Large population-based studies revealed that subjects who are heterozygous carriers of
the P376L variant have significantly increased levels of plasma HDL-C. P376L carriers have
a profound HDL-related phenotype and an increased risk of CHD (odds ratio = 1.79, which is
statistically significant).
T
he strong inverse association between
amounts of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol (HDL-C) and coronary heart
disease (CHD) risk has generated interest
in a potential causal relationship between
HDL metabolism and CHD. However, clinical
trials with drugs that raise HDL-C levels, niacin
and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)
inhibitors, have produced disappointing results
(1). Furthermore, recent studies of human genetic
variants that are associated with HDL-C levels
have generally failed to show association with
CHD (2, 3). Most notably, a loss-of-function variant
in LIPG, a gene encoding an endothelial lipase
that, in the heterozygous state, raises HDL-C
by ~5 mg/dl, was found to have no association
with CHD (4). Although these previous studies
suggest that higher HDL-C levels may not be
causally protective against CHD, we reasoned
that additional human genetic analyses might
provide mechanistic insight into the complex
relationship between HDL and CHD.
The scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI), encoded
by the gene SCARB1, was discovered to be an
HDL receptor two decades ago (5). SR-BI pro-
motes the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl
esters (HDL-CEs) into cells, particularly hepato-
cytes and steroidogenic cells (5, 6). In mice, over-
expression of SR-BI in the liver reduces levels of
HDL-C (7–10), and genetic deletion of SR-BI re-
sults in higher HDL-C levels (11–13). Remarkably,
these geneticmanipulations in mice have effects
on atherosclerosis opposite to those predicted by
human epidemiological data: Overexpression re-
duces atherosclerosis despite the lower HDL-C
levels (14–16), and gene deletion increases athero-
sclerosis despite the higher HDL-C levels (17–20).
One potential explanation relates to the flux of
cholesterol from macrophages through the re-
verse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway; SR-BI
overexpression increases macrophage RCT, and
SR-BI knockout reduces macrophage RCT (21).
The human relevance of these observations has
been unclear.
Identification of SCARB1 P376L
homozygote and association with
extremely high HDL-C
We hypothesized that humans with extremely
high levels of HDL-C may harbor loss-of-function
variants in SCARB1 and undertook a targeted re-
sequencing discovery experiment in 328 partic-
ipants with very high HDL-C (>95th percentile,
mean HDL-C of 106.8 mg/dl) and a control group
of 398 subjects with low HDL-C (<25th percentile,
mean HDL-C of 30.4 mg/dl). In this cohort, we
sequenced the exons of ~990 genes located within
300 kb of each of the 95 loci with significant as-
sociations (P < 5 × 10−8) with plasma lipid levels
identified by the Global Lipids Genetics Consor-
tium as of 2010 (22). Among the high HDL-C
subjects, we identified a homozygote for SCARB1
P376L (g.125284671 G>A, c.1127 C>T, p.P376L,
rs74830677), a 67-year-old female with an HDL-C
of 152 mg/dl, and confirmed this finding by
Sanger sequencing. This subject harbored no mu-
tations in other high HDL-C genes such as CETP
and LIPG. In addition to this homozygote, four
P376L heterozygotes were identified by targeted
sequencing in the high HDL-C group; no hetero-
zygotes were found in the low HDL-C group (P =
0.008, Fisher’s exact test).
To identify additional P376L carriers, we geno-
typed an expanded cohort of very high versus low
HDL-C subjects. Among 524 additional subjects
with very high HDL-C (mean HDL-C 95.0 mg/dl),
we identified 11 heterozygotes for P376L; whereas
among 758 subjects with low HDL-C (mean HDL-
C 33.5 mg/dl), we identified 3 heterozygotes. In
total, our combined sequencing and genotyping
for discovery of the P376L variant showed that
this variant is significantly overrepresented in sub-
jects with high HDL-C [minor allele frequency
(MAF) = 0.010 in high HDL-C versus 0.0013 in
low HDL-C controls, P = 0.000127, Fisher’s exact
test, Table 1].
Because this variant is present on the exome
array, we expanded ouranalysis tothe Global Lipid
Genetics Consortium exome array data in >300,000
individuals. The P376L variant was very rare in
this population (MAF of ~0.0003). It was signifi-
cantly associated with higher HDL-C levels with a
relatively large effect size (beta = 8.4 mg/dl; P =
1.4 × 10−15). Notably, this variant was not associated
with plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (LDL-C) or triglycerides (TGs) (table S1).
Thus, we conclude that SCARB1 P376L is asso-
ciated specifically with elevated HDL-C levels.
HDL-related phenotypes of
SCARB1 P376L homozygote
and heterozygotes
We next recruited the P376L homozygote, eight
heterozygous carriers, and both high HDL-C and
normal HDL-C noncarrier controls for deep
phenotyping of HDL metabolism and related
traits. All of the P376L study participants were of

 European ancestry, almost exclusively of Ashke-
nazi Jewish descent. Clinical characteristics and
lipid profiles of the subjects are reported in Table
2. Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC)
analysis of plasma lipoproteins confirmed the
increase in large HDL particles in the homo-
zygote (Fig. 1A). Cholesterol and apolipoprotein
A-I (apoA-I) levels in HDL were significantly
increased in the homozygote and heterozygotes
compared with controls, but HDL apoA-II levels
were not elevated (Table 2 and Fig. 1B). There
were no differences between P376L carriers and
controls in the absolute amount of HDL free cho-
lesterol or the ratio of free-to-esterified cholesterol
in their HDL (Fig. 1C). P376L heterozygotes had a
2.8-fold increase and the homozygote a 6.1-fold
increase in large HDL-2b particles compared with
noncarrier controls (Fig. 1D). There was more
apoA-I (Fig. 1E and fig. S2) and apoC-III (Fig.
1F) in large HDL particles in the homozygote and
heterozygous carriers. Cholesterol efflux capacity
was similar in carriers and controls (Fig. 1G). In
contrast to the infertility phenotype of Scarb1-
deficient female mice (18), the P376L homozygote
had two healthy children and reported no fertility
impairment. We also did not observe the steroido-
genic or platelet phenotypes reported in Scarb1-
deficient mice (see supplementary materials).
SCARB1 P376L results in complete
loss of function of SR-BI
Given the profound HDL phenotype of the P376L
carriers, we sought to understand the impact of
the variant on SR-BI function. We generated
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using pe-
ripheral blood mononuclear cells from the P376L
homozygote and a noncarrier control. We next
differentiated these cells into hepatocyte-like
cells (HLCs) to study HDL metabolism in the
setting of endogenous cellular SCARB1 expression.
HLCs differentiated through this protocol reca-
pitulate phenotypes of cultured primary hepato-
cytes such as albumin and VLDL (very low density
lipoprotein) secretion (23–26). The cell lines from
the control donor and the P376L homozygous sub-
ject demonstrated expression of hepatocyte-specific
genes ALB (albumin) and AFP (alpha-fetoprotein)
and exhibitedcomparableSCARB1gene expression
(fig. S3). Compared with control iPSC hepatocyte
lines, those from the P376L homozygote demon-
strated a profound reduction in selective choles-
terol uptake from HDL in vitro (Fig. 2A). Similar
results were observed in experiments with COS7
cells transfected with plasmids expressing wild-
type (WT) or the P376L variant of SCARB1 (fig. S3,
A and B), along with defective binding to HDL in
vitro at 4°C (fig. S4, C and D).
To evaluate the physiological impact of the
P376L variant on HDL-C levels and catabolism in
vivo, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vec-
tors to direct hepatic overexpression of WT SR-BI
or the P376L variant in mice with depleted Scarb1
[Scarb1 knockout (KO) mice]. The two groups of
mice demonstrated similar hepatic expression
levels of Scarb1 mRNA (fig. S5A) and SR-BI protein
(fig. S5B). Mice expressing WT Scarb1 demon-
strated a robust 73% decrease in HDL-C. In con-
trast, mice expressing the P376L variant had no
reduction in HDL-C; their HDL-C levels were
comparable to those in the control AAV-null in-
jected mice (Fig. 2B). Although the clearance of
125I-labeled HDL protein was not different among
the three groups, the clearance of [3H]HDL-CE
was much slower in mice expressing the P376L
variant compared with those expressing WT SR-
BI and was comparable to that in the control mice
(Fig. 2, C and D). Selective HDL-CE clearance from
plasma was increased by WT SR-BI but was un-
detectable in the P376L-expressing mice (Fig. 2E
and fig. S5C), as was hepatic uptake of [3H]CE at
24 hours (fig. S5D). This indicates that the P376L
sequence variant results in complete loss of the
canonical function of SR-BI—namely, selective
uptake of HDL-CE.
We hypothesized that the markedly reduced
HDL-CE uptake could be because of aberrant pro-
cessing of the P376L SR-BI protein, which leads
to impaired cell surface localization. To test this,
we isolated cell surface proteins from COS7 cells
transfected with WT and P376L SR-BI using bio-
tinylation and found markedly reduced cell sur-
face SR-BI in the P376L transfected cell lysates
after streptavidin cell surface protein pull-down
assays (fig. S4E). Given that SR-BI undergoes N-
glycosylation inthe endoplasmicreticulum concom-
itant with proper folding, we hypothesized that
altered posttranslational modification may under-
lie its reduced cell surface localization (27–29). We
measured the molecular weights of SR-BI forms
after endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H) treatment of
transfected COS7 (fig. S4E) and iPSC-derived HLC

of the P376L variant were ascertained from the Penn High HDL Study through two approaches,
targeted sequencing of the SCARB1 gene in a total of 726 subjects (328 high HDL-C and 398 low
HDL-C subjects) and genotyping on the exome array (Illumina) in an additional 1282 subjects (524 high
HDL-C subjects and 758 low HDL-C subjects). The association of the P376L variant with the high HDL-C

 are consistent with a model in which the P376L
sequence variant alters the endogenous post-
translational N-glycosylation of SR-BI to prevent
either transit from the ER to the Golgi or fur-
ther posttranslational modifications in the Golgi,
which ultimately result in reduced cell surface
expression.
SCARB1 P376L is associated
with increased risk of CHD
in humans
Despite a profound increase in HDL-C, SR-BI de-
ficiency in mice causes accelerated atherosclerosis
(17–20). The relationship of reduced SR-BI func-
tion to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in
humans has not been established. The P376L
homozygous subject did not have clinical CHD,
but her carotid intimal-medial thickness (cIMT)
was 0.789 mm (left-right average), which is in the
>75th percentile for females of her age; in addi-
tion, she had detectable plaque throughout the
left internal carotid artery and at the bifurcation
of her right internal carotid artery. cIMT measure-
ments were not significantly different in the P376L
heterozygotes compared with both groups of con-
trols (fig. S8), but because of small sample size, the
statistical power is limited.
To achieve greater statistical power to address
this question, we performed a meta-analysis of
large exome array genotyping studies of CHD
cases and healthy controls to determine the re-
lationship of the P376L variant with risk of CHD
(Table 3). Among 16 sample sets from two con-
sortia [the CARDIoGRAM Exome Consortium
and the CHD Exome+ Consortium], we tested
the association between P376L carrier status and
CHD in 137,995 individuals. Across 49,846 CHD
cases and 88,149 CHD controls, we found that
P376L carriers had a significantly higher risk of

disease among carriers = 1.79; P = 0.018] (Table 3).
Thus, carriers of this SCARB1 P376L variant have
significantly increased HDL-C levels and a sig-
nificantly increased risk of CHD.
Discussion
Studies of mice have provided important insights
into the effects of SR-BI on HDL metabolism,
RCT, and atherosclerosis. These studies revealed
that overexpression of SR-BI reduces HDL-C
(7–10) and reduces atherosclerosis (14–16), where-
as gene deletion of SR-BI increases HDL-C (11–13)
and accelerates atherosclerosis (17–20). The clin-
ical relevance of these findings has remained
uncertain, however. Studies of injected labeled
HDL-CE in humans suggested that the majority
of the HDL-CE was transported to the liver via

 CETP-mediated exchange to apoB-containing lipo-
proteins rather than by direct uptake from HDL
by the liver (30), which brings into question the
importance of hepatic SR-BI in human physiology.
Common genetic variants near the SCARB1 locus
were found to be significantly associated with
plasma HDL-C levels, which suggests that SR-BI
may play a role in HDL metabolism in humans
(22, 31). A family with a rare SCARB1 variant in
which serine replaces proline 297 (P297S) was re-
ported in which the heterozygous carriers of the
variant had modestly elevated HDL-C levels (31).
However, the variant retains substantial SR-BI
activity, no homozygotes were identified, the ap-
parent effect on HDL-C was modest, and there
was insufficient power to address its effects on
atherosclerosis.
Through sequencing of subjects with extremely
high plasma levels of HDL-C, we identified a homo-
zygote for a P376L variant in SR-BI. Our comple-
mentary approaches consistently demonstrated
that this variant confers virtually complete loss of
function of SR-BI. Our results demonstrate many
similarities in the consequences of SR-BI deficiency
on HDL composition between mice and humans,
including a shift toward large, buoyant HDL par-
ticles and a significant increase in apoA-I, but
not apoA-II, in plasma and HDL (12, 32, 33). The
homozygote is a woman who had two healthy
children without fertility issues or delivery com-
plications, which suggests that, in humans, SR-BI
deficiency may not impair reproductive function
in the same manner as it does in mice (18, 34). In
mice, SR-BI–mediated CE uptake from HDL is a
critical process underlying steroid hormone syn-
thesis in adrenal and gonadal tissues, and SR-BI
deficiency alters adrenal cholesterol content, im-
pairs adrenal glucocorticoid response under stress,
and can lead to fasting-induced hypoglycemia
(6, 35, 36). We did not observe any differences
in fasting glucose, serum cortisol, adrenocortico-
tropic hormone, or female gonadal hormones in
P376L heterozygous subjects versus controls, and
we saw only a modest increase in testosterone in
male P376L heterozygotes relative to noncarriers.
We postulate that differences in expression or
capacity for up-regulation of apoB-containing
lipoprotein receptors relative to SR-BI between
mouse models and humans in steroidogenic tis-
sues may account, at least partially, for the lack
of recapitulation of some of the phenotypes of
SR-BI deficiency in mice. We also observed no
differences in platelet levels, cholesterol content,
and activation from the P376L carriers, despite
reports of thrombocytopenia and altered platelet
activity in Scarb1 KO mice (31). These results sug-
gest a relatively different contribution of SR-BI to
platelet function between mice and humans. Note
that the phenotypes of human SCARB1 P376L
homozygote (elevated HDL-C and large HDL par-
ticles but relatively normal steroidogenesis, re-
productive viability, and platelet function) are
comparable to those observed in mice lacking PDZ
domain containing 1 (PDZK1), an adaptor pro-
tein for SR-BI (37).
Perhaps the most important finding of our
study is that, despite the elevation in HDL-C,
P376L carriers exhibit increased risk of CHD, as
do Scarb1 KO mice. Our results are consistent
with a growing theme in HDL biology that steady-
state concentrations of HDL-C are not causally
protective against CHD and that HDL function
and cholesterol flux may be more important than
absolute levels. Using an in vivo assay of macro-
phage RCT, we previously showed that Scarb1
KO mice have impaired macrophage RCT even
though they have elevated HDL-C levels (21). Our
results suggest that reduced hepatic SR-BI func-
tion in humans causes impaired RCT, which leads
to increased risk of CHD despite elevation in HDL-
C levels. However, SR-BI is also expressed in vas-
cular cell types, including endothelial cells, vascular
smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, where
it could have protective effects against athero-
sclerosis as well (38, 39). Our results are also
consistent with the previously suggested concept
(39) that up-regulation or enhancement of SR-BI

Wavelike charge density
fluctuations and van der Waals
interactions at the nanoscale
Alberto Ambrosetti,1,2 Nicola Ferri,1 Robert A. DiStasio Jr.,3* Alexandre Tkatchenko1,4*
Recent experiments on noncovalent interactions at the nanoscale have challenged the basic
assumptions of commonly used particle- or fragment-based models for describing van der
Waals (vdW) or dispersion forces. We demonstrate that a qualitatively correct description of
the vdW interactions between polarizable nanostructures over a wide range of finite distances
can only be attained by accounting for the wavelike nature of charge density fluctuations.
By considering a diverse set of materials and biological systems with markedly different
dimensionalities, topologies, and polarizabilities, we find a visible enhancement in the
nonlocality of the charge density response in the range of 10 to 20 nanometers. These
collective wavelike fluctuations are responsible for the emergence of nontrivial modifications
of the power laws that govern noncovalent interactions at the nanoscale.
T
he assembly of complex nanostructures
and biological systems from simpler build-
ing blocks is often driven by noncovalent
van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interac-
tions that arise from electrodynamic corre-
lations between instantaneous charge fluctuations
in matter (1, 2). The influence of vdW forces ex-
tends well beyond binding energies and encom-
passes the structural (3, 4), mechanical (5, 6),
spectroscopic (7), and even electronic (8) signa-
tures of condensed matter. A common way to
characterize vdW interactions is by power laws in
the distance D between two or more objects (e.g.,
atoms, molecules, nanostructures, surfaces, or
solids); the most familiar is arguably the Lennard-
Jones potential, which is characterized by a short-
range repulsive wall with a D–12 dependence and
a long-range attractive tail with a D–6 dependence.
Even a slight variation in these power laws can
have a profound impact on observed properties
and therefore demands an accurate, physically
sound theoretical description.
Thus far, both our conceptual understanding
of vdW interactions and the quantitative models
widely used for describing these quantum mechan-
ical phenomena are primarily rooted in low-order
intermolecular perturbation theory (IPT), wherein
vdW binding originates from the interactions
between transient local multipoles (9), and mac-
roscopic Lifshitz theory (10). Although IPT-based
approaches have had enormous success in describ-
ing vdW binding in (small) gas-phase molecular
systems (11, 12), recent advanced experimental
techniques have produced several findings that
are challenging the basic assumptions of IPT and
macroscopic approaches for nanostructured ma-
terials, and are strongly indicative that even our
qualitative understanding of these interactions is
incomplete and needs to be substantially revised
(13). Examples of such experimental observations
include (i) ultra–long-range vdW interactions ex-
tending up to tens of nanometers into heteroge-
neous dielectric interfaces (14, 15), (ii) complete
screening of the vdW interaction between an
atomic force microscope (AFM) tip and a SiO2
surface by the presence of one or more layers of
graphene adsorbed on the surface (16), (iii) super-
linear sticking power laws for the self-assembly
of metallic clusters on carbon nanotubes with in-
creasing surface area (17), and (iv) nonlinear in-
creases in the vdW attraction between homologous
molecules and an Au(111) surface as a function of
molecular size (18). Satisfactory theoretical expla-
nations for these experimental findings either
require ad hoc modifications to IPT [(iii) and
(iv)] or are inherently outside the domain of ap-
plicability of IPT [(i) and (ii)].
To address these issues, we note that the spa-
tial extent of the instantaneous charge density
fluctuations responsible for vdW interactions de-
pends rather sensitively on the nature and char-
acter of the occupied-to-virtual transitions of the
