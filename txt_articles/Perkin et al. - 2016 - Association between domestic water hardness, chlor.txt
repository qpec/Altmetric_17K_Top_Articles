ABSTRACT 
36 
Background: Domestic water hardness and chlorine have been suggested as important risk 
37 
factors for atopic dermatitis (AD). 
38 
Objective: To examine the link between domestic water calcium carbonate and chlorine 
39 
concentrations, skin barrier dysfunction (raised TEWL) and AD in infancy. 
40 
Methods: We recruited 1303 three month old infants from the general population and 
41 
gathered data on domestic water calcium carbonate (CaCO3 mg/L) and chlorine (Cl2 mg/L) 
42 
concentrations from local water suppliers. At enrolment, infants were examined for AD and 
43 
screened for filaggrin (FLG) skin barrier gene mutation status. Transepidermal water loss 
44 
(TEWL) was measured on unaffected forearm skin. 
45 
Results: CaCO3 and chlorine levels were strongly correlated. A hybrid variable of above and 
46 
below median levels of CaCO3 and total chlorine was constructed: a baseline group of low 
47 
CaCO3/low total chlorine (CaL/ClL), high CaCO3/low total chlorine (CaH/ClL), low CaCO3/high 
48 
total chlorine (CaL/ClH) and high CaCO3/high total chlorine (CaH/ClH).  Visible AD was more 
49 
common in all three groups versus the baseline group: CaH/ClL adjusted OR (AOR) 1.87 
50 
(95%CI 1.25-2.80, p=0.002), CaL/ClH AOR 1.46 (95%CI 0.97-2.21, p=0.07) and CaH/ClH AOR 
51 
1.61 (95%CI 1.09-2.38, p=0.02). The effect estimates were greater in children carrying 
52 
filaggrin mutations but formal interaction testing between water quality groups and filaggrin 
53 
status was not statistically significant.  
54 
Conclusions: High domestic water CaCO3 levels are associated with an increased risk of AD in 
55 
infancy. The influence of elevated total chlorine levels remains uncertain. An intervention 
56 
trial is required to see whether installation of a domestic device to lower CaCO3 levels 
57 
around the time of birth can reduce this risk.

Clinical Implications 
60 
Domestic water hardness is an important risk factor for AD development and skin barrier 
61 
dysfunction already during the first three months of life, especially in genetically 
62 
predisposed infants.

64 
Capsule Summary 
65 
In a cohort recruited from the general population, visible AD was more common in three 
66 
month old infants exposed to domestic water with raised levels of calcium carbonate.

Introduction 
80 
Atopic dermatitis (AD: syn. ‘atopic eczema’, ‘childhood eczema’) is the commonest 
81 
inflammatory skin disease and affects around 20% of children in the UK.1 Skin barrier 
82 
impairment and dry skin are hallmarks of AD and likely to be important triggers of 
83 
eczematous skin inflammation in early life, partly through genetic predisposition, in 
84 
particular inheritance of filaggrin (FLG) skin barrier gene mutations. We have previously 
85 
shown that carriage of FLG skin barrier mutations is associated with an increase in 
86 
transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and xerosis already by three months of life, even in 
87 
unaffected children.2 In addition to FLG mutation inheritance, there are a number of 
88 
potential environmental exposures that may contribute to the breakdown of the skin barrier 
89 
in early life, including domestic water hardness (CaCO3) and chlorine concentration.1 
90 
Rain water is naturally low in CaCO3 but it collects minerals, such as calcium, as it percolates 
91 
through rock. The local geology therefore has a major impact on the hardness of the water 
92 
supply. In the UK, domestic water tends to be harder in the south compared to the north. 
93 
Chlorine is universally added to tap water and is a potential skin irritant.3 
94 
Ecological studies in the UK, Spain and Japan have shown consistent positive associations 
95 
between domestic water hardness and AD risk among schoolchildren.4-6 However, the link 
96 
between domestic water hardness and AD has not been studied in early infancy, when 
97 
around 50% of all AD cases manifest clinically for the first time,7 and furthermore, FLG 
98 
mutation inheritance and skin barrier impairment (raised TEWL) have not been considered 
99 
in this context either. 
100 
Although an observer blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial with conventional ion-
101 
exchange water softeners among 6 month to 16 year old UK children with moderate to 
102 
severe AD did not show a beneficial effect on disease severity,8 it is still possible that high

domestic water CaCO3 or chlorine levels are involved in the initiation of eczematous skin 
104 
inflammation. We therefore studied the association between CaCO3 and chlorine 
105 
concentrations as well as FLG skin barrier gene mutation inheritance, skin barrier function 
106 
(TEWL), AD risk and severity among three month old infants.

Methods 
109 
This was a cross-sectional study among 1303 three-month old infants recruited from the 
110 
general population in England and Wales between October 2009 and April 2012 
111 
(www.eatstudy.co.uk). The sample size was determined by the intervention component of 
112 
the EAT Study.9 All children were generally well, exclusively breastfed and born at term (≥37 
113 
weeks gestation). Following written parental consent, children were examined for AD, using 
114 
a UK diagnostic criteria-based photographic protocol, adapted for infants.10 AD severity was 
115 
determined by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index.11 TEWL was measured with 
116 
the Biox Aquaflux® AF200 closed condenser chamber device on the unaffected skin of the 
117 
volar aspect of the forearm.12 Participants’ parents were advised not to use any skin care 
118 
products on the infant’s arms for the preceding 24 hours. Measurements were performed in 
119 
our environmentally controlled Clinical Research Facility (ambient temperature 20 +/- 20C, 
120 
relative room humidity 32-50%), after at least 20 minutes of acclimatization. Measurements 
121 
were not taken if the child was visibly distressed or crying. In all children we calculated the 
122 
mean of three separate TEWL measurements. Venous blood samples were screened for the 
123 
six commonest FLG mutations using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays (mutations  R501X, 
124 
2282del4, R2447X, S3247X; Applied Biosystems, ABI 7900 HT, Foster City, California) or by 
125 
sizing of fluorescent PCR products on an Applied Biosystems 3130 DNA sequencer 
126 
(mutations 3673delC, and 3702delG). These six mutations detect 99% of FLG mutation 
127 
carriers in the UK population. Data on domestic water calcium carbonate and free and total 
128 
chlorine levels in mg per litre (mg/L) were gathered from local UK water suppliers for each 
129 
participant’s household based on post code at time of study recruitment. We also collected 
130 
information on potential confounders, including sex, ethnicity, home location, maternal age, 
131 
socio-economic status (maternal age at leaving full-time education), ownership of a water

softener, family history of AD and other allergic diseases, frequency of bathing, and the use 
133 
of topical moisturisers and bathing products via parental questionnaires.  
134 
 
135 
Statistical analysis 
136 
Water content data was available for all participants for CaCO3, but local water companies 
137 
were only able to provide total and free chlorine values for 1287 and 809 participants 
138 
respectively. CaCO3 levels were strongly correlated with both total chlorine and free chlorine 
139 
levels (Figure 1). Furthermore, total chlorine and free chlorine levels were highly correlated 
140 
(Figure 2). To avoid incorporating strongly correlated variables in the models and given that 
141 
significantly more participants had total chlorine data, a hybrid variable of above and below 
142 
median levels of CaCO3 and total chlorine was constructed: a baseline group of low 
143 
CaCO3/low total chlorine (CaL/ClL), high CaCO3/low total chlorine (CaH/ClL), low CaCO3/high 
144 
total chlorine (CaL/ClH) and high CaCO3/high total chlorine (CaH/ClH). A univariate analysis 
145 
was undertaken, investigating the association between this variable and the potential 
146 
confounding factors. Two principle outcomes were investigated: visible AD at enrolment and 
147 
raised TEWL. Raised TEWL was defined as ≥15 g/m2h, based on the upper quartile value of 
148 
TEWL in participants without visible AD at enrolment (15.00 g/m2h) as used in our previous 
149 
publications.2,13 Logistic regression models for the two principle outcomes were created 
150 
with two levels of adjustment. The first incorporated factors found to be significantly 
151 
associated with the outcomes in the univariate analysis. The second also included 
152 
moisturizer and bubble bath use. Filaggrin mutation inheritance was also included in the 
153 
models. Water softeners were installed in the homes of a small number of participants (66 
154 
families, 5.1% of the cohort). The analysis presented in this paper was undertaken including 
155 
water softener ownership as a potential confounding variable. The argument for this was 
156

that conventional water softeners remove calcium carbonate but have no effect on the 
157 
chlorine content of the water. However, to ensure that this did not introduce a bias in the 
158 
analysis, the effect of excluding EAT participants with water softeners was explored by 
159 
undertaking the same analyses, removing these infants, and the effect estimates were not 
160 
significantly different. Formal statistical tests for interaction between filaggrin status and the 
161 
hybrid CaCO3/Cl variable were undertaken. Stata 10.1 (StataCorp, Texas) was used for the 
162 
analyses.

Results 
165 
24.3% (317/1302) of all participating infants had AD at 3 months confirmed by skin 
166 
examination, mostly mild with a median SCORAD of 7.5 (range 3.5-75.0). TEWL levels ranged 
167 
from 6.5-82.1 g/m2h, with a median of 12.8 g/m2h, and inter-quartile range (IQR) of 10.8-
168 
16.1 g/m2h. Raised TEWL (≥15 g/m2h) was present in 32% of participants. 
169 
CaCO3 levels ranged from 3-490 mg/L, with a median of 257 mg/L, and inter-quartile range 
170 
(IQR) of 162-286 mg/l. For total chlorine the range was 0.04-1.06 mg/L, median 0.37 mg/L 
171 
and IQR of 0.26-0.49 mg/L. The geographical distribution of the principle exposure variables 
172 
in England and Wales is mapped in Figure 3. 
173 
Water CaCO3/Cl content were significantly associated with ethnicity (non-white participants 
174 
less likely to live in low/low areas) and home location (with urban areas more likely to have 
175 
a high/high content). Maternal age was associated with water CaCO3/Cl content, with 
176 
mothers being significantly older in both high CaCO3 groups. Water softener use was most 
177 
common in the high CaCO3/low Cl group. Water CaCO3/Cl content was not associated with a 
178 
family history of AD or allergic diseases (Table I). 
179 
With regard to the skin care variables, there was a strong association with moisturizer use 
180 
(highest in the high/high group) and the use of bubble bath (highest in the low/low group 
181 
and lowest in the high/high group) (Table I).

AD risk and domestic water calcium carbonate and chlorine concentration 
184 
For the outcome visible AD at the enrolment visit, the condition was more common in all 
185 
three groups, compared with the baseline low/low group: CaL/ClL 18.7% (OR 1.00 -

baseline), CaH/ClL 27.9% (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.16-2.44, p=0.006), CaL/ClH 23.1% (OR 1.31, 
187 
95%CI 0.89-1.93, p=0.17) and CaH/ClH 27.6% (OR 1.66, 95%CI 1.16-2.38, p=0.006). In Table 
188 
II: Model 2, the effect of adjustment for filaggrin status, sex, ethnicity, maternal age, water 
189 
softener presence and home location enhanced the effect estimates for CaH/ClL AOR 1.87 
190 
(95%CI 1.25-2.80, p=0.002) and CaL/ClH AOR 1.46 (95%CI 0.97-2.21, p=0.07), but not for 
191 
CaH/ClH AOR 1.61 (95%CI 1.09-2.38, p=0.02). We also explored the effect of additionally 
192 
including moisturizer and bubble bath usage as confounders in our model given the 
193 
associations found in univariate analysis, and the risk estimates for CaH/ClL and CaL/ClH 
194 
remained stable (AOR 1.74 (95% CI 1.13-2.68, p=0.01) and AOR 1.39 (0.90-2.17) p=0.14), but 
195 
there was attenuation in the CaH/ClH estimate (AOR 1.26 (95% CI 0.83-1.92) p=0.28). 
196 
However, the validity of including these two variables is questionable because of their 
197 
strong correlation with AD, and this is reviewed further in the discussion. 
198

concentration 
201 
Table III shows the results of the same analysis using raised TEWL (≥15 g/m2h) as the 
202 
outcome. Effect estimates for the three water content groups were greater than 1.00, both 
203 
in the crude and adjusted models, approaching statistical significance for the CaH/ClH group. 
204 
 
205 
 
206 
Exploring the potential interaction with filaggrin mutation inheritance 
207 
There was a very strong association between filaggrin mutation carriage and visible AD (AOR 
208 
3.84, 95%CI 2.64-5.59, p<0.0005) and raised TEWL (AOR 3.59, 95%CI 2.48-5.19, p<0.0005). 
209

12
Furthermore, when we explored whether there was an interaction effect of filaggrin status 
210 
on the relationship between water content group and visible AD, the effect estimates for the 
211 
interaction terms were greater than 1.00 for the high calcium carbonate groups (CaH/ClL 
212 
AOR 2.10 (95%CI 0.74-5.99, p=0.17), CaL/ClH AOR 0.83 (95%CI 0.27-2.60, p=0.75) and 
213 
CaH/ClH AOR 1.32 (95%CI 0.49-3.55, p=0.59) but missed conventional statistical significance. 
214 
However, in contrast to AD, for raised TEWL the interaction terms were more consistently 
215 
elevated for both raised calcium carbonate groups, suggesting an association between 
216 
raised TEWL and specifically raised CaCO3 levels but only amongst infants carrying a filaggrin 
217 
mutation: CaH/ClL AOR 2.13 (95%CI 0.77-5.91, p=0.15), CaL/ClH AOR 0.55 (95%CI 0.18-1.65, 
218 
p=0.29) and CaH/ClH AOR 2.22 (95%CI 0.83-5.93, p=0.11). 
219 
This finding was explored in more detail for CaCO3 alone in Figure 4, where the CaCO3 level is 
220 
plotted against mean TEWL amongst children with and without filaggrin mutation. As with 
221 
the previous analysis, TEWL and CaCO3 were positively associated, but only amongst the 
222 
filaggrin mutation carrying infants. 
223 
Infants were divided into four categories depending on their AD status and their raised 
224 
TEWL status. Within each water CaCO3/Cl group, the relative distribution of infants for these 
225 
four categories is given in the columns in Table IV, stratified by filaggrin status. For example, 
226 
the data presented in the first column demonstrates that of the 266 infants (without a 
227 
filaggrin mutation) living in low CaCO3, low total Cl areas, 67% had neither AD or raised 
228 
TEWL, 17% had raised TEWL only (but no AD), 8% had AD only (but no raised TEWL) and 8% 
229 
had both raised TEWL and AD. 
230 
Figures 5A & 5B present the data from Table IV in graphical form. In Figure 5a it can be seen 
231 
that AD is more common in the three water quality groups compared with the baseline

group in participants without and with a filaggrin mutation. In contrast, there is no obvious 
233 
variation between CaCO3/Cl groups in the proportion with raised TEWL but not AD (orange 
234 
bars). However, infants with AD (navy bar) in Figure 5A can be split into children with AD 
235 
and raised TEWL (navy with orange border) and those with AD but normal TEWL (navy) 
236 
(Figure 5B). Amongst children with raised TEWL (orange and navy with orange border 
237 
combined), the proportion with AD appears higher in the raised CaCO3 groups (percentages 
238 
indicated in the figure), an effect apparent in children with and without filaggrin mutations, 
239 
but of greater magnitude in the former. AD severity (SCORAD) was not influenced by water 
240 
hardness and chlorine concentration.

Discussion 
242 
Infants exposed to above average levels of water hardness had a statistically significantly 
243 
increased risk of having visible eczema at three months of age, whether this was accompanied by 
244 
high or low total chlorine levels, compared to those living in low CaCO3 water areas.  There was 
245 
the suggestion that inheritance of a FLG skin barrier gene mutation enhanced this effect, although 
246 
the statistical test for interaction was not significant. 
247 
Exposure to high total chlorine levels alone was also associated with increased visible eczema at 
248 
three months (46% higher) but the results missed statistical significance. 
249 
Similar patterns were seen for the associations between water hardness groups and elevated 
250 
TEWL but the effect estimates were more attenuated and not statistically significant. 
251 
In addition, there was some evidence to suggest that raised CaCO3 levels influenced the 
252 
phenotypical expression of AD amongst those with raised TEWL levels both in children with and 
253 
without filaggrin mutations. 
254 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the association between domestic water 
255 
calcium carbonate, chlorine concentrations and AD risk among infants. Our findings are likely to 
256 
be representative of the population in England and Wales because the study population was 
257 
drawn from a wide geographical area, covering a broad spectrum of calcium carbonate 
258 
concentrations, wider for instance than in the Lancet publication by Nally et al., which recruited 
259 
primary and secondary schoolchildren from across Nottinghamshire.4 A further strength of our 
260 
study is that all children were physically examined, rather than relying on a questionnaire 
261 
diagnosis alone, which was the case in all other studies on this topic. We were also able to assess 
262 
the effect on skin barrier function (TEWL) and potential effect modification through FLG mutation 
263 
inheritance.

The role of a broad range of confounders was explored. Ethnicity was associated with water 
265 
content with more non-white participants living in high CaCO3/high total chlorine areas of the UK. 
266 
These areas predominate in the south east of England and particularly London, and London is the 
267 
most ethnically diverse area in the UK, with the highest proportion of minority ethnic groups and 
268 
the lowest proportion of the white ethnic group at 59.8 per cent.14 Furthermore, non-white EAT 
269 
participants lived significantly closer to London on average than white participants (data not 
270 
shown).  Non-white ethnicity was strongly associated with risk of atopic dermatitis, a relationship 
271 
for which there is an extensive literature.15 Non-white ethnicity was also strongly associated with 
272 
raised TEWL, as has been reported previously.16 
273 
 Whilst the inclusion of variables such as sex, ethnicity, maternal age and home location (rural 
274 
versus city) would seem to be non-contentious, much more open to debate was the decision as to 
275 
whether to include variables relating to skin care. The concern is that bathing frequency and usage 
276 
of bathing products as well as skin moisturisation practice are all strongly influenced by a skin 
277 
condition, in particular the presence of AD. Thus in a cross sectional study such as this, even 
278 
though the infants were very young at assessment, bathing skin care practice could have already 
279 
changed because of the emergence of AD or dry skin, potentially resulting in reverse causality. 
280 
While we did not directly measure CaCO3 and chlorine concentrations in individual participant’s 
281 
households, UK post codes contain on average only 12 addresses with an inherent precision of 
282 
around 100m.17 It is therefore likely that the data we received from commercial domestic water 
283 
suppliers closely matched the actual domestic water hardness and chlorine levels of individual 
284 
households. 
285 
Our findings are in keeping with the other studies conducted among schoolchildren in the UK, 
286 
Japan, and Spain,4-6 suggesting that the association is real.  Assuming a direct causal relationship 
287 
between domestic water hardness and AD risk, it may be that calcium carbonate has a direct

detrimental effect on skin barrier integrity, contributing to skin dryness and the development of 
289 
eczematous skin inflammation. Alternatively, another environmental factor directly related to 
290 
water hardness, such as alkalinity, may be responsible. The higher the domestic water CaCO3 
291 
concentration, the higher its alkalinity, and the higher the pH on the skin. An increase in pH on and 
292 
in the stratum corneum leads to enhanced protease activity, which in turn accelerates the 
293 
breakdown of corneodesmosomes and reduces lipid lamellae synthesis, all contributing to skin 
294 
barrier breakdown.18 This hypothesis is further supported by our finding that the association 
295 
between water hardness and TEWL risk is more enhanced (albeit not achieving statistical 
296 
significance) among children who carry a FLG mutation skin barrier gene mutation. Our analyses 
297 
suggested that the effect was not conferred by a differential usage of more protease-containing 
298 
soaps and shampoos in high water hardness or high chlorine areas. 
299 
Interactions between CaCO3 and chlorine levels, other chemical water constituents, the skin 
300 
microflora and stratum corneum may also play a role, and this warrants further research. 
301 
Unfortunately, UK water companies stopped routinely measuring magnesium levels in 2003, and 
302 
we were therefore not able to account for this in our analyses. 
303 
It is interesting to note that the profilaggrin polypeptide encoded by the FLG gene possesses a 
304 
calcium binding domain of unknown function, which is cleaved off when the proprotein is 
305 
proteolytically processed into functional filaggrin during the biogenesis of the stratum corneum.19   
306 
Moreover, there is a calcium gradient within the living cell layers of the epidermis, whereby 
307 
increasing calcium concentration is involved in regulating expression of late-differentiation 
308 
proteins such as filaggrin and in triggering the terminal differentiation process that leads to skin 
309 
barrier formation.20    For example, knockout of the skin’s calcium sensing receptor leads to failure 
310 
of epidermal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.21 Although it is not known how 
311 
environmental sources of calcium influence the physiology of skin barrier formation, in light of the

essential role of this mineral in the process of epidermal differentiation, it is tempting to speculate 
313 
that the effects we observed may act by perturbation of this mechanism. 
314 
Other findings of a potential effect of chlorine are consistent with McNally et al. who reported a 
315 
correlation between the concentration of chlorine in domestic tap water (comparing the lowest to 
316 
highest categories of chlorine concentration) and the 1-year prevalence (AOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-
317 
1.7) and lifetime prevalence of AD (AOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00-1.52) in children aged 6-11 before the 
318 
adjustment of potential confounders, but not afterwards.4 Miyake et al. reported a correlation 
319 
between high chlorine concentration (<19.8 mg/l compared to >28.0 mg/l) and the lifetime 
320 
prevalence of AD in children aged 6-12 only, after adjustment for potential confounders (AOR 
321 
1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10).5 Interestingly, in this study the chlorine levels were much higher than in 
322 
the UK, and there was also a strong positive linear trend between the concentration of chlorine 
323 
and water hardness (Pearson’s coefficient 0.57, p = 0.0001), whereas we observed a negative 
324 
trend. 
325 
Chlorine is added to domestic water across the UK, leading to ubiquitous exposure and a narrow 
326 
range of concentrations across the study population, making it more difficult to determine 
327 
epidemiological effects. We also did not have information on children’s exposure to swimming 
328 
pools, which contain much higher chlorine levels than domestic water and could have an 
329 
additional detrimental effect on skin barrier function and AD risk. The fact that the high 
330 
chlorine/low CaCO3 areas had an elevated risk of AD might contribute to explaining why the SWET 
331 
study was unsuccessful.8 This used ion-exchange water softeners which use a synthetic 
332 
polystyrene resin to remove calcium and magnesium ions from household water, replacing them 
333 
with sodium ions, thus eliminating the hardness. Ion-exchange water softeners have little impact 
334 
on chlorine levels, however, which requires a charcoal based filter system for complete removal.

In conclusion, domestic water CaCO3 content is an important risk factor for AD development and 
337 
possibly skin barrier dysfunction during the first three months of life, potentially more in 
338 
genetically predisposed infants. Whether chlorine also contributes to these issues remains 
339 
uncertain. We are in the preparation phase of an intervention trial to assess whether installation 
340 
of a water softening device in high risk children around the time of birth is able to attenuate this 
341 
risk and whether any additional benefit may be accrued by also reducing chlorine levels.
