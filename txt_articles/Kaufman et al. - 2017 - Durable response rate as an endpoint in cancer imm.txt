Abstract
Background: Traditional response criteria may be insufficient to characterize full clinical benefits of anticancer
immunotherapies. Consequently, endpoints such as durable response rate (DRR; a continuous response [complete
or partial objective response] beginning within 12 months of treatment and lasting ≥6 months) have been
employed. There has not, however, been validation that DRR correlates with other more traditional endpoints of
clinical benefit such as overall survival.
Methods: We evaluated whether DRR was associated with clinically meaningful measures of benefit (eg, overall survival
[OS], quality of life [QoL], or treatment-free interval [TFI]) in a phase 3 clinical trial of an oncolytic virus for melanoma
treatment. To evaluate the association between DRR and OS and to mitigate lead time bias, landmark analyses were
used. QoL was evaluated using the FACT-BRM questionnaire (comprising the FACT-BRM Physical, Social/Family,
Emotional, and Functional well-being domains, the Additional Concerns, Physical and Mental treatment-specific
subscales, and the Trial Outcome Index [TOI]). TFI was defined as time from the last study therapy dose to first
subsequent therapy dose (including any systemic anticancer therapy for melanoma after study therapy discontinuation).
Results: Four hundred thirty-six patients were included in the intent-to-treat population. Achieving DR was associated
with a statistically significant improvement in OS in a landmark analysis at 9 months (HR = 0.07; P = 0.0003), 12 months
(HR = 0.05, P < 0.0001), and 18 months (HR = 0.11; P = 0.0002) that persisted after adjusting for disease stage and line of
therapy. Achieving a DR was associated with a longer median TFI (HR = 0.33; P = 0.0007) and a higher TOI improvement
rate (58.1% versus 30.0%; P = 0.025).
Conclusions: Achieving a DR was associated with clinical benefits such as improved OS and QoL and prolonged TFI,
thus supporting the usefulness of DR as a meaningful immunotherapy clinical trial endpoint.

 Background
A growing body of clinical evidence indicates that tra-
ditional response criteria may not be sufficient to com-
pletely characterize the full spectrum of activities of
current anticancer immunotherapies and/or define the
clinical benefit associated with their use. Although a num-
ber of immunotherapies have recently been approved
based, in part, upon tumor responses evaluated by trad-
itional response criteria (eg, Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors [RECIST] [1, 2] or World Health
Organization [WHO] criteria for response [3]), these
criteria may not accurately capture the full benefits of
immunotherapy-based drugs or regimens. In particular,
these measures of response lack a durability dimension,
and thus therapeutic benefit may be overestimated. Con-
versely, because responses may occur after an initial in-
crease in tumor burden or appearance of new tumor
lesions characterized as progressive disease by WHO cri-
teria or RECIST [4–11], therapeutic benefit may be under-
estimated. Consequently, allowing for disease progression
before response is critical for evaluation of immunother-
apies because initial tumor growth may not always be
indicative of treatment failure [4, 11].
Assuming response criteria that allow for progression
prior to response are used, a conventional analysis is to
evaluate duration of response for responders; however,
no prospective criteria are designated for interpreting
the clinical relevance of this information at the patient
level or for treatment effect in a controlled study. To
this end, the endpoint of durable response rate (DRR)
has been proposed, which includes standard response
criteria and a prospective durability dimension. Although
DRR has not been validated as a surrogate endpoint for
clinical benefit, anticancer agents have been approved
based on a demonstrated ability to achieve retrospect-
ively defined durable responses (DRs) [12–14]. With
the allowance for progression prior to response, we hy-
pothesized that DRR is an appropriate measure of the
ability of immunotherapy anticancer agents to mediate
a clinically meaningful, sustained reduction in tumor
burden that may be associated with measures of clinical
benefit such as prolonged overall survival (OS), im-
proved
quality
of
life
(QoL),
and
freedom
from
successive anticancer therapies. This is especially im-
portant for immunotherapy-based regimens since the
kinetics of response may be different when compared
to cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted therapy that me-
diate antitumor activity directly in tumor cells.
For this analysis, we used prospectively collected clinical
data from the OPTiM trial, a randomized phase 3 study
that compared intralesional talimogene laherparepvec, a
genetically modified herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-1,
designed to selectively replicate in tumors and produce
human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) to subcutaneous GM-CSF, to evaluate whether
DRR is associated with measures of clinical benefit, such
as OS and QoL or treatment-free interval (TFI) after
therapy. Talimogene laherparepvec is thought to mediate
antitumor activity, at least in part, through activation of
systemic immune responses and initial results from previ-
ous clinical trials demonstrated delayed kinetics of re-
sponse similar to observations from T-cell checkpoint
inhibitor trials [8, 15]. DRR, defined as a continuous
response (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR])
beginning in the first 12 months of treatment and lasting
6 months or longer, was the primary endpoint in OPTiM.
Although results from the OPTiM study have been
reported previously [15], this analysis was undertaken to
further validate the DRR endpoint by determining if DR is
associated with other measures of clinical benefit. These
data have implications for incorporating DRR as a
regulatory endpoint in tumor immunotherapy clinical
trial designs.
Methods
Study design
Study design and patient population for OPTiM have
been previously described [15]. Briefly, eligible patients
with histologically confirmed, surgically unresectable,
stage IIIB/IIIC/IV melanoma that could undergo direct/
ultrasound-guided injection of dermal, subcutaneous, or
lymph node melanoma metastases were included. Pa-
tients were randomized 2:1 to receive intralesional tali-
mogene laherparepvec or subcutaneous GM-CSF. The
primary endpoint was DRR, defined as the rate of ob-
jective response (CR/PR) by modified WHO criteria last-
ing ≥6 months continuously and beginning within the
first 12 months of initiating treatment where disease
progression was allowed prior to onset of response. Key
secondary endpoints included OS, best overall response,
onset and duration of response, and time to treatment
failure. Exploratory objectives included evaluation of
patients’ QoL and analysis of the influence of achieving
a response on OS.
Analysis population
Data cutoff for DR and QoL analyses was December
2012, and data cutoff for OS and subsequent therapy
analyses was February 2013. Data cutoff for duration of
response per investigator was August 2014 (final anal-
ysis). A landmark approach was used to limit lead-time
bias because the minimum time required to achieve a
DR was 9 months (ie, 3 months to first tumor assess-
ment plus minimum 6 months of response duration).
Analyses excluded patients with a follow-up duration
less than the landmark time.

 Assessments
Assessment of durable response in OPTiM has been de-
scribed previously [15]. Briefly, visible/palpable lesions
were assessed by clinical evaluation performed on day 1
of each cycle; computed tomography assessments of re-
sponse were performed at baseline and every 12 weeks
thereafter. Patients who had a best response of CR/PR
per modified WHO criteria based on investigator assess-
ment or were on therapy ≥9 months were evaluated for
response by a blinded endpoint assessment committee
(EAC) [15]. Patients were considered in response if
there was ≥50% reduction in total tumor burden of all
measurable lesions compared with baseline or, if any
new tumors/lesions had appeared, compared with when
they were first documented. Disease progression was
considered a >25% increase in total tumor burden or
appearance of new lesions, and clinically relevant dis-
ease progression was defined as disease progression as-
sociated with a decline in performance status and/or
required alternative therapy. Treatment continued for
24 weeks, irrespective of progression. After 24 weeks,
treatment continued until clinically relevant disease pro-
gression, intolerability, withdrawal of consent, complete
remission, lack of response by 12 months, or disappear-
ance of all injectable lesions (talimogene laherparepvec
only) [15]. After 12 months, patients with stable/respond-
ing disease could continue treatment for 6 additional
months.
Quality
of
life
was
assessed
using
a
validated
Functional
Assessment
of
Cancer
Therapy–Biologic
Response Modifier (FACT-BRM) questionnaire, which
comprises four domains (Physical, Social/Family, Emo-
tional, and Functional well-being) and two treatment-
specific subscales (Additional Concerns: Physical and
Mental) [16]. The Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is a 27-
item sum of the scores of the Physical and Functional
well-being
domains
and
the
two
treatment-specific
subscales of FACT-BRM that has been shown to be a
helpful single scale instrument for assessment of QoL in
clinical trials [17, 18]. Changes in QoL were evaluated
using the TOI as well as the FACT-BRM Total, FACT-
BRM subdomains, and treatment-specific subscales. The
questionnaire was completed before study procedures
were conducted on day 1 of each treatment cycle (5
weeks for the first cycle and 4 weeks for subsequent
treatment cycles) until the end of treatment and at the
end-of-treatment visit (30 days after last treatment). In
this analysis, a clinically meaningful improvement in
QoL was defined as a ≥5-point increase from baseline
lasting ≥28 days for the TOI and FACT-BRM Total and
a ≥2-point increase for all other domains and Additional
Concerns [19]. A minimum clinically important differ-
ence for TOI of 5 to 7 points has been established for
group changes.
Melanoma treatments administered after discon-
tinuation of talimogene laherparepvec/GM-CSF were
recorded during the survival follow-up. Subsequent
therapy was defined as any systemic anticancer therapy
for melanoma after discontinuation of study therapy
and was categorized as chemotherapy/targeted agents
or immunotherapy.
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis was planned when no further pa-
tients had the possibility of meeting the criteria for dur-
able response; the final OS analysis was planned for after
all patients had reached 18 months from their first dose
of treatment. To mitigate potential for lead-time bias (ie,
patients who live long enough to have a DR tend to have
longer survival, irrespective of whether durable re-
sponse prolongs survival), OS for patients who had
achieved a DR and were alive was compared with OS
for patients who had not achieved a DR and were alive
in a landmark analysis at 9, 12, and 18 months after
randomization [20]. In this analysis, OS was calculated
from a landmark time to death; patients who died or
who were censored before the landmark time were ex-
cluded from the analysis. Because disease stage and line
of therapy were found to be associated with DR and OS
in multivariate analyses and because the talimogene
laherparepvec treatment effect on DRR and OS was
pronounced in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a
melanoma and treatment-naive patients in exploratory
subgroup analyses of OPTiM, Cox model hazard ratio
estimates and log-rank tests in landmark analysis were
stratified by these factors, accounting for observed
baseline imbalances (ie, disease stages IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a
versus IVM1b/IVM1c, first-line versus second-line or
later therapy).
To further evaluate any potential association between
achievement of DR and OS, the time when DR was
achieved was also evaluated in a Cox proportional
hazards model as a time-dependent covariate for all
randomized patients. Treatment-free interval (defined as
time from the last dose of study therapy to first dose of
subsequent therapy or censoring in the absence thereof
at end of follow-up) was estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method. As with OS, the association between TFI
and achieving a DR was evaluated in a landmark analysis
using a Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank
test. The TOI analysis set included patients with a base-
line score (defined as the maximum possible score—5-
point absolute increase criterion for improvement), ≥1
post-baseline non-missing score, and tumor assessments
for ≥9 months of follow-up. Associations between
FACT-BRM improvement and achievement of DR were
evaluated using an odds ratio stratified by disease stage
and line of therapy in a landmark analysis at 9 months

 after randomization. Odds ratios for those who achieved
a DR versus those who did not and P values for TOI
improvement were obtained by fitting an exact logistic
regression model using DR status as a predictor and
TOI improvement as response. Statistical significance
was evaluated at a nominal two-sided 0.05 significance
level without multiplicity assessment.
Results
Patients
In total, 436 patients were included in the intent-to-treat
population (295 in the talimogene laherparepvec arm and
141 in the GM-CSF arm). Baseline demographic/clinical
characteristics for the study population are summarized in
Table 1 and have been reported previously by arm [15]. At
the primary analysis, 86 patients in the intent-to-treat
population achieved an OR per EAC and, of these, the OR
duration did not qualify for a DR for 35 patients but it did
for 51 (talimogene laherparepvec, n = 48; GM-CSF, n = 3),
23 of whom had progression before response (all in
the talimogene laherparepvec arm). Among the 86 pa-
tients with an OR, a similar proportion of DR versus
non-DR patients had early stage disease (82% versus
74%) and received first-line therapy (65% versus 63%).
At the final analysis, 59 patients achieved a DR per
investigator (talimogene laherparepvec, n = 57; GM-CSF,
n = 2; Additional file 1: Figure S1), indicating that re-
sponses continued to evolve over time.
Association between durable response and overall survival
Achieving a DR was associated with a statistically signifi-
cant improvement in OS in a landmark analysis at 9
months (HR = 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01–0.48; P = 0.0003; Fig. 1a),
at 12 months (HR = 0.05, 95% CI, 0.01–0.33; P < 0.0001;
Fig. 1b), and at 18 months (HR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03–0.44;
P = 0.0002; Fig. 1c). Because comparisons of OS and DR
may be confounded (eg, by lead-time bias), we employed
analytical techniques to mitigate against such potential
biases. The association between DR and OS remained after
adjusting for potentially confounding imbalances in disease
stage and line of therapy (both were shown to be predictive
for treatment effect of talimogene laherparepvec in post
hoc exploratory analyses [15]) between those who achieved
a DR and those who did not (9 months, HR = 0.07; 95% CI,
0.01–0.54; 12 months, HR = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01–0.035; 18
months, HR = 0.11, [95% CI, 0.03–0.47]; Table 2). Consist-
ent results were obtained when achievement of DR was
evaluated in a Cox proportional hazards model as a
time-dependent covariate among all randomized patients
(HR = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03–0.26).
Durable response and treatment-free interval
Of the 436 patients included in the intent-to-treat
population, 129 received study therapy and had tumor
assessments at ≥9 months of follow-up and were in-
cluded in the TFI analysis; of these, 50 patients
achieved a DR per the EAC (talimogene laherparepvec,
n = 47;
GM-CSF,
n = 3)
and
79
patients
did
not
(talimogene laherparepvec, n = 65; GM-CSF, n = 14). Of
the 50 patients with a DR, 11 (22%) were treated with

 subsequent systemic anti-melanoma therapy after the end
of their assigned treatment with GM-CSF/talimogene
laherparepvec (talimogene laherparepvec, n = 9; GM-CSF,
n = 2). Of 79 patients without a DR, 38 (48%) were
treated with subsequent systemic anti-melanoma therapy
(talimogene laherparepvec, n = 28; GM-CSF, n = 10).
Kaplan-Meier plots of freedom from subsequent sys-
temic anti-melanoma therapy in patients who achieved a
DR versus patients who did not achieve a DR with
tumor assessments at ≥9 months, including hazard ra-
tio (HR) and log-rank P value, are shown in Fig. 1. DR
was associated with a significantly longer median TFI
(HR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17–0.65; P = 0.0007; Fig. 1d).
Achieving a DR was also associated with a 27.5%
(95% CI, 10.6–44.4) reduced risk of initiating subse-
quent systemic therapy at 36 months (DR, 76.5%
[95% CI, 61.4–86.2]; no DR, 49.0% [95% CI, 36.9–60.0]).
Quality of life
Of the 129 patients with tumor assessments at ≥9
months of follow-up, 117 had QoL data and 103 had
data for the TOI analysis. Overall, achieving a DR was
associated with improved scores in the TOI, the FACT-
BRM Total, and all FACT-BRM domains and treatment-
specific subscales, except for social well-being (Fig. 2a).
Achievement of a DR was associated with a higher TOI
improvement rate. Among patients who achieved a DR,
58.1% (25/43) had a clinically meaningful TOI improve-
ment, compared with 30.0% (18/60) of patients who did
not achieve a DR (P = 0.025; Fig. 2b). In a landmark anal-
ysis limited to patients with ≥9 months of follow-up for
tumor response assessment, the odds ratio for TOI im-
provement was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.1–7.0; Table 3). A sensitivity
analysis evaluated whether the association was retained
when TOI improvement required a larger absolute in-
crease from baseline and/or longer improvement duration.
Although nominal 0.05 significance was not achieved in
all cases, it was achieved for a magnitude up to 9 points or
a duration up to 4 cycles. In addition, with one exception,
odds ratios were greater than 1 for all magnitude and
duration combinations (Additional file 1: Table S1).

 Discussion
Data from this analysis of outcomes in the phase 3
OPTiM study indicate that achievement of a DR in
patients
with
unresectable
regionally
and
distantly
advanced melanoma was associated with several inde-
pendent clinical benefits, providing further support for
DR as a useful endpoint in patients with melanoma.
Achievement of a DR was associated with improved OS in
landmark analyses at 9, 12, and 18 months, lower risk of
subsequent systemic therapy use at 36 months, and im-
proved QoL at ≥9 months of follow-up. The risk of death
was decreased by approximately 90% for patients with a
DR. Similar results were obtained in analyses adjusted for
imbalances in baseline demographic/clinical characteris-
tics and in a Cox proportional hazards model that evalu-
ated achievement of DR as a time-dependent covariate.
Furthermore, patients with a DR have an approximately
two-thirds reduction in the risk of requiring a new therapy
and were approximately 3 times more likely to have a clin-
ically meaningful improvement in QoL. The association
with improvement in QoL is particularly notable in the
melanoma setting where skin lesions may be regarded as
disfiguring by patients. Taken together, this evidence indi-
cates that DR is an efficacy endpoint that is associated
with other favorable clinical outcomes.
Since the proposed mechanism of action of talimogene
laherparepvec includes release of tumor-associated anti-
gens and cell- and damage-associated molecular pattern
molecules, and local expression of GM-CSF, talimogene
laherparepvec is likely able to recruit and expand tumor
associated antigen-reactive T cells [21]. This process may
take time, and lesions may continue to grow before

 regression. Furthermore, this process may cause a local
inflammatory-like response in lesions, resulting in a period
of “pseudo-progression” before response [15, 22]; thus, al-
ternative measures of clinical response may be needed.
These observations of progression before response are
consistent with the immune-mediated antitumor activity
associated with the talimogene laherparepvec mechanism
of action, and have been reported with other immunother-
apy agents such as ipilimumab [23]. With the allowance
for progression before response, our results demonstrate
the utility of DR as an appropriate endpoint for oncolytic
virus clinical trials and for trials involving combination
regimens of immunotherapeutic agents. An element of
DR that may be a key to its clinical value is that it incorpo-
rates a time component: responses must be maintained
for ≥6 months continuously and begun within the first 12
months of initiating treatment. In contrast, the WHO cri-
teria and RECIST do not make allowance for progression
before response or define a meaningful minimum dur-
ation of response. In a randomized clinical trial of ipilimu-
mab in melanoma, a significant improvement in OS was
seen; however, treatment had no impact on progression-
free survival (PFS) [10]. These results highlight the inher-
ent problems in using PFS using conventional response
criteria as a primary endpoint in immunotherapy clinical
trials, and the need for identification of alternative end-
points to accurately assess immunotherapy drugs in early
phase clinical development where OS may not be a feas-
ible endpoint. Our data support the use of DRR as a flex-
ible and appropriate surrogate of OS and other measures
of clinical benefit.
Other attempts to define alternative clinical trial end-
points for immunotherapy agents include modifications of
RECIST (such as immune-related response criteria; irRC
[4]), which are being used to evaluate tumor responses in
clinical trials across a variety of tumor types [24]. A benefit
to the use of irRC is that progressive disease prior to treat-
ment response is permitted, consistent with the criteria
for DR in the OPTiM study. However, like the WHO cri-
teria and RECIST, irRC does not define a meaningful dur-
ation for tumor response. Furthermore, endpoints such as
objective response or progression-free survival based on
irRC have not yet been validated as correlates of OS.
Unlike survival endpoints, response indicates a direct
biological effect of a therapy on the tumor. Patients can
survive for prolonged periods without treatment, but tu-
mors rarely recede or disappear without intervention.
To be considered a DR, however, the response must be
maintained for a period of at least 6 months. This dur-
ation component may make achieving a DR a more
descriptive endpoint than others such as objective
response, which requires only response confirmation at
least 4 weeks after the initial assessment of response. Six
months was initially selected as a reasonable duration
because most non-immunotherapy treatments rarely in-
duce responses beyond 6 months in melanoma [25]. The
expanded use of DRR for other cancers allows for the
selection of the most appropriate duration based on the
natural history of the disease and known impact of
established therapeutic regimens. Thus, by altering the
duration of response, DRR can be used in a more flex-
ible manner for other cancers that may exhibit different
natural history and/or have other standard treatments
available that extend survival for variable times. The in-
clusion of the initiation at any time within 12 months of
starting treatment allows capturing pseudoprogression,
which has been reported in some immunotherapy trials,
and
permits
continued
treatment
beyond
clinically
asymptomatic progression, as has been reported for irRC
proposed for tumor immunotherapy studies [4]. It is also
possible that a rate of durable stable disease might repre-
sent an informative endpoint; however, further evalu-
ation would be required to validate such an endpoint.
This study had certain limitations. First, these analyses
were exploratory and should therefore be interpreted with
caution. Second, although we identified associations be-
tween DR and clinical outcomes, causative relationships
could not be evaluated. For example, although our analysis
indicated an association between DR and OS, it is possible
that factors other than achievement of DR (eg, imbalances
in disease stage and line of therapy, or subsequent ther-
apy) might have influenced the observed outcome. Al-
though endeavors were made to mitigate the potential for
confounding by such factors, it is difficult to determine
how successful they might have been. Additionally, the

 selection of 6 months as the minimum duration for
achievement of a durable response was based on re-
sponses to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents; this time point
was, to an extent, arbitrary. In the OPTiM study, some
patients had DRs that lasted substantially longer than 6
months. It is unknown whether the associations found in
this analysis would have been observed had the distribu-
tion of DR duration been closer to the 6-month minimum.
Finally, it is possible that the associations seen were driven
by the preferential occurrence of complete response
among patients with DR (of any duration).
Conclusions
Results from this analysis indicate that the achievement of
a DR in patients with unresectable regionally and distantly
advanced melanoma was associated with improved clinical
benefit and QoL. Although causal relationships cannot be
determined via these analyses, these findings support the
utility of DR as a meaningful trial endpoint when assessing
efficacy of immunotherapies for solid tumors. Further con-
sideration of durable response rate as a clinical endpoint in
cancer immunotherapy trials is also warranted and may
allow for improved selection of promising agents for later
phase clinical development.
