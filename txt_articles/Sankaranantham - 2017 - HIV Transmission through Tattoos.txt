Abstract
HIV transmission through Tattooing is not a common mode of transmission. Tattooing becomes fashion and 
popular among youngsters throughout the world. A 26 year old man without any history of sexual activities, blood 
transfusion and IV drug abuse, acquired HIV through tattooing is being reported. Younger generation should be 
educated and made aware about the risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases is emphasized.
HIV Transmission through Tattoos

Transmission of diseases from tattooing may be related to the use of 
needles that were contaminated with blood from a previously tattooed 
individual, or the use of contaminated dyes and other material, such 
as sponges or tissues used to wipe away blood. HIV has been shown to 
remain infectious in aqueous solutions at room temperature for up to 
fifteen days and pigmented solutions, because they are relatively inert. 
A single needle stick injury from an infected host carries with it a 5-30% 
risk of transmission of hepatitis B (HBV), a 3-7% risk of transmission 
of hepatitis C (HCV), and a 0.2-0.4% risk of transmission of HIV. As

Introduction
HIV is known to be transmitted through sexual activities, 
transfusion of blood and blood products, sharing of needles (IV Drug 
users) and Mother to child transmission (MTCT) [1,2]. As per Center 
for disease control, Atlanta, USA, any activity other than these four 
routes carry negligible risk for HIV transmission [3]. Tattooing and 
piercing becomes fashion worldwide among both men and women at 
any age after adolescence [4]. When it is not done with proper care, 
it can transmit HIV infection and other blood-borne diseases as 
sharp needles are being involved piercing the skin of the individuals. 
Transmission of HIV and other blood born infections through 
tattooing, mass shaving of heads and through barber shops also have to 
be given adequate emphasize as modes of HIV transmission in future. 
To increase the awareness about this risk involved in tattooing and to 
stress the safety measures this case is reported.
Case Presentation
26 year old unmarried individual referred to my OPD for the 
complaints of sore mouth, passing frequent loose stools and extreme 
weakness for a week duration, after he was found HIV positive. He came 
with a HIV 1 positive report with a rapid card test and a Western Blot 
test. He denied both heterosexual and homosexual sexual activities. 
There was no history of blood transfusion or IV drug use. He admitted 
his passion for tattooing on his body.
On examination, patient was dehydrated. Few aphthous ulcers were 
present over the lips, ventral aspect of tongue near frenulum and its 
sides. He was having a sick look due exhaustion. Patient was having 8 
tattoo marks on his arm, fore arm, back and chest. He had these tattoos 
at 3 different spells of time (10 years back, 5 years back and 3 years 
back). He was admitted in the hospital for the diarrheal episode and the 
same was corrected. During May, 2016, his absolute lymphocyte count 
was 596 cells/ cubic mm. His CD4 count was 27 cells/cubic mm. with 
a CD4 percentage of 4%. The ratio between CD4:CD8 was 0.07 with a 
viral load of 43717 copies/ml. His weight was 54 kg. ART was initiated 
with Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz combination. He improved 
markedly within a year. His CD4 Count on May, 2017 was 284 cells /
cu.mm, with an absolute lymphocyte count as 3361 cells/cu.mm. His 
CD4 percentage raised to 23% and the CD4:CD8 ratio was 0.49. His 
viral load was 7124 copies/ml. This time his weight was 70 kg. He is now 
active and doing his job comfortably [5-9] (Figures 1-3).
Discussion 
Transmission of Hepatitis B and C through unsafe tattooing 
practices was well established whereas the evidence is less clear 
when it comes to HIV is concerned. Doll reported two cases of HIV 
infection in US likely to have been acquired by tattooing within prison.

this patient vehemently denied any history of homo or heterosexual 
activities, blood transfusion and Intravenous drug abuse, there is higher 
possibility for him to acquire HIV through tattooing, when other 
common modes of transmission were absent. In this case, he had three 
episodes of tattooing. In my opinion the first episode would have been 
the source of infection (10 years back) as the CD4 count was very low 
when patient was seen first.
Conclusion
Though the chances of HIV transmission through tattoo is much 
less compared to other transfusion transmitted diseases, it cannot be 
neglected totally. Adolescents and young adults should be adequately 
educated about the risk in going for tattoos. There must be strict 
protocols to be framed by the experts in the field of preventive medicine 
and those should be implemented and to be followed by the tattoo 
professionals to avoid such hazards in future.
