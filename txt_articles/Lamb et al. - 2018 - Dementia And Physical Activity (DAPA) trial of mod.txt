ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To estimate the effect of a moderate to high intensity 
aerobic and strength exercise training programme on 
cognitive impairment and other outcomes in people 
with mild to moderate dementia.
DESIGN
Multicentre, pragmatic, investigator masked, 
randomised controlled trial.
SETTING
National Health Service primary care, community and 
memory services, dementia research registers, and 
voluntary sector providers in 15 English regions.
PARTICIPANTS
494 people with dementia: 329 were assigned to an 
aerobic and strength exercise programme and 165 
were assigned to usual care. Random allocation was 
2:1 in favour of the exercise arm.
INTERVENTIONS
Usual care plus four months of supervised exercise 
and support for ongoing physical activity, or usual 
care only. Interventions were delivered in community 
gym facilities and NHS premises.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary outcome was score on the Alzheimer’s 
disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-
cog) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included 
activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric symptoms, 
health related quality of life, and carer quality of life 
and burden. Physical fitness (including the six minute 
walk test) was measured in the exercise arm during 
the intervention.
RESULTS
The average age of participants was 77 (SD 7.9) years 
and 301/494 (61%) were men. By 12 months the 
mean ADAS-cog score had increased to 25.2 (SD 12.3) 
in the exercise arm and 23.8 (SD 10.4) in the usual 
care arm (adjusted between group difference −1.4, 
95% confidence interval −2.6 to −0.2, P=0.03). This 
indicates greater cognitive impairment in the exercise 
group, although the average difference is small and 
clinical relevance uncertain. No differences were 
found in secondary outcomes or preplanned subgroup 
analyses by dementia type (Alzheimer’s disease or 
other), severity of cognitive impairment, sex, and 
mobility. Compliance with exercise was good. Over 
65% of participants (214/329) attended more than 
three quarters of scheduled sessions. Six minute 
walking distance improved over six weeks (mean 
change 18.1 m, 95% confidence interval 11.6 m 
to 24.6 m).
CONCLUSION
A moderate to high intensity aerobic and strength 
exercise training programme does not slow cognitive 
impairment in people with mild to moderate 
dementia. The exercise training programme improved 
physical fitness, but there were no noticeable 
improvements in other clinical outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION
Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN10416500.
Introduction
Nearly 47.5 million people worldwide have dementia.1 
The challenge to families and health and social 
services is substantial.1 The hypothesis that aerobic 
and strengthening exercise might slow cognitive 
impairment in dementia has gained widespread 
popularity. 
Many 
studies 
describe 
plausible 
mechanisms using mammalian models, but there are 
fewer studies using human participants.2 3
The results of recent systematic reviews of trials 
of exercise training in people with dementia have 
conflicted. One review concluded that exercise can 
improve physical but not cognitive impairment, 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, or health related quality 
of life.4 Another suggested that aerobic exercise has 
a positive effect on cognitive impairment, regardless 
of the type of dementia or dose of intervention.5 All 
reviews confirm the multiplicity of small studies 
of low methodological quality, limited duration of 
follow-up, and high unexplained heterogeneity in 
findings. In 2012, the UK government launched a 
prime minister’s challenge in which research to seek 
a cure for, or alleviation of, dementia symptoms was 
set as a national priority. The National Institute for

Health Research (NIHR) commissioned the Dementia 
And Physical Activity (DAPA) trial to inform the debate 
about the potential benefit of exercise on cognitive 
impairment in people with dementia.
We compared the effect on cognitive impairment 
at 12 months of a combination of a moderate to 
high intensity aerobic and strength exercise training 
programme in addition to usual care compared with 
usual care alone in people with mild to moderate 
dementia. We designed and tested an intervention 
that targeted known mechanistic pathways in vascular 
and Alzheimer’s type dementia and which, if found 
effective, could be scaled for use within the UK 
National Health Service.
Methods
Study design
A full protocol has been published previously.6 This 
was a multicentre, pragmatic, investigator masked, 
randomised controlled trial. Random allocation was 
2:1 in favour of the exercise arm. Participants were 
recruited from memory services in university and 
district general hospitals, NIHR dementia research 
registers and networks, and from primary care practices 
and community dementia services in 15 regions across 
England. Interventions were delivered in community 
gym facilities and occasionally in NHS facilities.
We recruited people with mild to moderate 
dementia and, when available, their primary carer. 
We asked carers to provide data about their relative 
or close friend with dementia for measures that 
specified the primary respondent should be the carer. 
For people with dementia, we determined capacity 
to consent in accordance with the principles of the 
Mental Capacity Act (2005) using research nurses 
and physiotherapists who received specific training. 
The assessment of capacity was based on a subjective 
opinion developed during the preliminary phases of 
enrolment. The nurses or physiotherapists made an 
assessment, using gentle questioning, to determine 
how 
much 
information 
was 
understood 
and 
processed. When people with dementia were assessed 
as having capacity, we obtained their informed 
consent. If people with dementia were assessed 
as lacking capacity, we asked the primary carer or 
personal consultee about the participant’s past and 
present wishes and feelings about taking part in 
research studies and we asked the primary carer or 
personal consultee to provide consent. If people with 
dementia were unable to give informed consent, and 
there was no carer or personal consultee, we sought 
nominated consultees who were well placed and 
prepared to act on behalf of potential participants (for 
example, a health professional independent of the 
study). We excluded people who lacked capacity and 
had no personal or nominated consultee. Carers gave 
their written informed consent to provide data about 
the person with dementia. We checked agreement for 
continued participation at each visit.
As a separate analysis, we asked carers to provide 
data on their own quality of life and caring experience. 
Carers provided separate written informed consent for 
the carer element of the study.
Participants
People with dementia were eligible if they had 
a clinically confirmed diagnosis of dementia in 
accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)7 and a 
standardised mini mental state examination score 
(sMMSE)8 of greater than 10, were able to sit on a chair 
and walk 10 feet (3.05 m) without assistance, and 
lived in the community either alone or with others. 
We excluded people with acute, unstable physical or 
terminal illness that would make participation in the 
exercise programme unsafe.
Study treatments
The interventions and rationale are described in detail 
elsewhere.9 Physiotherapists and exercise assistants 
prescribed and delivered interventions in the exercise 
arm. People with dementia attended an individual 
assessment where the prescription of aerobic and 
strength exercises was tailored to their fitness and 
health status. The assessment included a review of 
health conditions that required modifications of the 
exercise prescription (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular 
conditions, musculoskeletal conditions), and drugs 
that might be needed during sessions (eg. glyceryl 
trinitrate sprays, inhalers). Thereafter, people with 
dementia attended group sessions in a gym twice a 
week for four months; each session lasted 60 to 90 
minutes. We also asked the participants to do home 
exercises for one additional hour each week during 
this period. The supervised programme lasted four 
months, after which we prescribed a more frequent 
home based programme with a target of unsupervised 
physical activity or exercise of 150 minutes each week 
(total). We used behavioural strategies (described 
elsewhere9) to promote adherence throughout, and 
up to three telephone motivational interviews were 
administered after the supervised programme. The 
behavioural strategies included guiding participants 
to choose home exercises or activities that matched 
their preferences for venue, personal situation, and 
ease of completion.
During the supervised period, people with dementia 
were overseen in groups of six to eight participants to 
minimise costs. In each group session, aerobic exercise 
consisted of static cycling with a five minute warm-up 
period followed by up to 25 minutes of moderate to hard 
intensity cycling, depending on tolerance level. We set 
target intensity using a six minute walk test according 
to Luxton10 and progressed the aerobic challenge using 
recognised methods.9 Strength training consisted of 
arm exercises using hand held dumb bells, including 
at least a biceps curl and, for more able individuals, 
shoulder forward raise, lateral raise, or press exercises, 
and leg strength training exercises using a sit-to-stand 
weighted vest (All Pro Exercise Products, FL) or a waist 
belt (Rehabus, Lerum, Sweden), or both. The starting 
weight for sit-to-stand varied between 0 and 12 kg

3
depending on ability. The baseline target for strength 
training exercises was three sets of 20 repetitions. The 
sets had to be at least moderately difficult or hard to 
complete, and the weight was increased accordingly. 
In the ensuing sessions we added weight to ensure 
progression, with moderation of repetitions if needed. 
One physiotherapist and one assistant ran each 
session unless participation was low (≤3 participants) 
in which case one physiotherapist ran the session. 
In most instances, we provided consistency in 
staffing. Physiotherapists and assistants attended a 
one day training session that included techniques 
on communicating with and motivating people with 
dementia, and we provided a study manual. To ensure 
compliance with the treatment protocol we made 
regular visits for quality assurance.
All participants received usual care in accordance 
with clinical guidance that included counselling 
for carers and families, a clinical assessment, 
prescription of symptomatic treatments, and brief 
advice about physical activity.11 The participants’ 
doctors determined additional treatment on the basis 
of clinical need.
Data collection
At the time of enrolment, trained interviewers who 
were registered health professionals checked eligibility 
and recorded demographic characteristics and the 
sMMSE score. Participants identified their gender as 
either female or male, and their ethnicity. We obtained 
baseline scores for outcome questionnaires before 
randomisation. We confirmed dementia diagnosis 
and extracted ICD (international classification of 
diseases, 10th revision, version 5) dementia diagnostic 
subcategory from hospital or primary care medical 
records.12 We followed-up all participants at six and 
12 months after randomisation. Interviewers had 
regular quality assurance checks, with a member of 
the training team experienced with the ADAS-cog 
observing home interviews.
Outcomes for people with dementia
Unless indicated the respondent is the person with 
dementia. The primary outcome was the Alzheimer 
disease assessment scale cognitive subscale13 (ADAS-
cog 11 item scale, scored 0 to 70; higher scores indicate 
worse cognitive impairment) at 12 months. Secondary 
outcomes at six and 12 months after randomisation 
were measured using the Bristol activity of daily 
living index14 (scored 0 to 60, higher scores indicate 
worse impairment, carer rated), neuropsychiatric 
index15 (scored 1 to 60, higher scores indicate worse 
behavioural symptoms, carer rated), the three level 
version of the EQ-5D quality of life measure16 (scored 
0 to 1, higher scores indicate better quality of life), the 
quality of life Alzheimer’s disease scale17 (scored 13 to 
52, higher scores indicate better quality of life), ADAS-
cog subscale at six months, and ADAS praxis, memory, 
and language subscales13 at six and 12 months (praxis 
scored 0-10, memory scored 0-35, language scored 
0-25, higher scores indicate worse impairment). 
Carers provided a retrospective assessment of the 
participant’s falls and fractures for each six month 
follow-up period. We recorded deaths and data on use 
of healthcare and social care resources (including the 
number of physiotherapy sessions, exercise classes, or 
other structured physical activity programmes outside 
of the trial) using the client services receipt inventory18 
(participant and carer rated). Follow-up interviews 
took about one and a half hours.
For each participant in the intervention arm we 
recorded the number of trial exercise sessions attended, 
the number of minutes spent cycling at low (warm-up), 
moderate, and high intensity, and the weight lifted 
and number of repetitions of each strength exercise. 
Participants repeated the six minute walk test six weeks 
after starting the classes and we calculated change in 
walking distance. We recorded the number of telephone 
contacts made after the end of the sessions and the 
adherence with physical activity recommendations 
reported during the course of the call.
At each session, physiotherapists asked participants 
and their carers if the person with dementia had 
experienced any adverse events since the last session. 
They also observed events during sessions, and 
during phone contacts asked about adverse events. 
Short episodes of muscular or postural soreness were 
expected. We defined serious adverse events as those 
that resulted in death, persistent or important disability 
or incapacity, were immediately life threatening, or 
required hospital admission or medical intervention 
to prevent one of the serious adverse events. We 
considered any event occurring during supervised or 
non-supervised exercise sessions and up to two hours 
after as being related to intervention.
Carer outcomes
At each time point we measured carer burden with the 
Zarit burden interview19 (scored 0 to 88, higher scores 
indicate greater stress) and carer health related quality 
of life using the EQ-5D-3L.
Randomisation and masking
An independent telephone randomisation system 
assigned participants to exercise training or usual care 
in 
a 
2:1 
ratio. 
Because 
6-8 
people 
with 
dementia 
had 
to 
be 
enrolled in each exercise session, we used unbalanced 
randomisation to minimise delays to starting exercise 
training. We provided the dates and times of sessions 
before enrolment, and we only randomised people 
who were able to attend these dates. If they could not 
attend these dates, then we delayed their enrolment, 
baseline assessment, and randomisation until the 
next cycle of exercise interventions became available. 
We stratified randomisation by region and used a 
minimisation algorithm within each region to balance 
the severity of dementia (either sMMSE 10-19 for 
moderate; ≥20 for mild)8 across the trial arms. An 
independent statistician used a computerised random 
number generator for the allocation sequence, then 
a central telephone registration and randomisation 
service implemented the sequence.

Masking participants, carers, or the teams providing 
intervention was not possible. Researchers unaware 
of treatment assignment undertook all baseline and 
follow-up interviews in the participants’ home. Before 
each interview, we asked participants and carers not to 
reveal the treatment they had received. If the allocation 
was revealed, we assigned a different interviewer 
to complete the next follow-up. Researchers who 
undertook data entry and cleaning were unaware of 
treatment allocation.
Sample size
For the sample size calculation, we considered a 
between group difference of 2.45 ADAS-cog points in 
favour of exercise and a baseline standard deviation 
of 7.8 as the between group difference to be consistent 
with the conservative effects achieved by commonly 
used symptomatic drugs (giving a base target of 322).20 
We inflated for unbalanced randomisation (n=38) and 
potential group (cluster) effects within the intervention 
arm (n=14, inflation factor 1.04), giving a target of 
375 (α 0.05, power 80%). We assumed a 20% loss to 
follow-up (including 10% death), giving a minimum 
target of 468 (312 intervention: 156 control). P values 
are two sided. Because of the need to fill exercise 
cohorts we anticipated that the final sample would be 
greater than 468.
Statistical analyses
We conducted analyses using intention to treat 
principles and analysed all people according to their 
random allocation. A few people with dementia 
withdrew themselves from the trial or were lost to 
follow-up. No people with dementia were withdrawn 
from the trial by investigators. We generated 
descriptive statistics for the randomised sample and 
the sample providing data for the primary analysis. 
Our prespecified strategy was to avoid imputation of 
missing cases if there were no discernible patterns in 
the missing data and the randomised and analysed 
samples were similar. During peer review a statistical 
reviewer asked for imputation of missing cases, and 
this is reported.
We used multilevel regression models with random 
effect for region to estimate treatment effects at each 
time point, negative binomial regression models 
for falls, and median regression for non-normally 
distributed data. We estimated clustering effects 
associated with exercise group membership. As cluster 
effects were negligible, we adjusted all estimates for 
baseline covariates (age, sex, cognitive impairment 
(sMMSE), region, and the variable being tested) 
only. Prespecified treatment subgroup analyses 
included pre-randomisation cognitive impairment 
(sMMSE ≥20 and <20), type of dementia (ICD clinical 
coding Alzheimer’s disease versus other), physical 
performance (EQ-5D mobility no problems versus 
some problems or confined to bed), and gender 
(male versus female). We analysed subgroups using 
statistical tests of interaction, including adjustment 
for baseline covariates.21 Compliance was defined a 
priori as attending 75% or more of group sessions (22 
out of a maximum 30), consistent with most exercise 
guidelines.9 To estimate the effect compliance on the 
primary outcome we used complier average causal 
effect (CACE) analysis.22 We calculated dose of aerobic 
and strength training for compliers, non-compliers, 
and overall. To test for differences in the baseline 
characteristics of compliers and non-compliers we 
used independent sample t tests or non-parametric 
equivalent.
We summarised the dose of aerobic training as 
the mean and standard deviation (or median and 
interquartile range for non-normal data) of the 
time spent in moderate and high intensity training. 
Also, as a proportion of the target time set by the 
physiotherapist before each session. For strength 
training the dose indicator was the difference between 
the average of the weight lifted for each exercise over 
the first four sessions (as it could take a few sessions to 
establish good form for maximum repetition) and the 
weight lifted during the final session. As we allowed 
for a decrease in repetitions to accommodate a greater 
strength load, we multiplied the amount of weight 
lifted by the number of repetitions to gain the overall 
weight lifted.
When 
available, 
we 
used 
the 
published 
recommendations for dealing with missing items within 
scales. We anticipated non-ignorable item missing 
data for the ADAS-cog23 and used recognised item level 
multiple imputation techniques, including baseline 
cognitive impairment, for the primary analysis.24 We 
undertook sensitivity analyses for missing ADAS-cog 
items, including worst score assignment and complete 
cases.24 In sensitivity analysis we used item response 
theory analysis23 but could not achieve an adequate 
fit to the data and therefore is not reported. We ran 
additional sensitivity analyses to inform whether 
unmasking of treatment assignment influenced the 
treatment estimate.
Study monitoring
A trial steering and data monitoring committee 
reviewed safety, quality, and masked data at six 
monthly intervals, and approved changes to the 
statistical analysis plan and protocol. No interim 
analyses were done, but the trial steering committee/
data monitoring committee could halt the trial 
for safety or ethical concerns. At the point of trial 
registration, the primary outcome was the mini mental 
state examination score. Before starting the trial 
we changed the primary outcome tool to the ADAS-
cog. The reason was superior sensitivity to change 
that enabled a reduction in the sample size and 
greater comparability with other trials. We obtained 
appropriate permissions and paid any required fees 
for use of copyright protected materials.
Patient involvement
The NIHR involved people with dementia and their 
representatives in specifying the question, including 
methods, selecting important outcome domains,

and type of intervention through the commissioning 
process. The study team involved people with 
dementia, their representatives, and other stakeholders 
in the development of the intervention and protocol, 
including detailed feedback on the intervention, 
questionnaires, approach and invitation, acceptability 
of procedures, and logistics. Carers of people with 
dementia were formal members of the study trial 
steering committee/data monitoring committee. At 
the end of the study, people with dementia and carers 
were invited to a joint feedback day with research 
and clinical staff, and they contributed actively to 
discussions about the results and interpretation.
Results
Trial progression and recruitment
Between 1 February 2013 and 24 June 2015, 2929 
people were screened, 1847 were found potentially 
eligible and approached, and 494 were randomised: 
329 to an exercise programme and 165 to usual care 
(fig 1). A mean of 2 (SD 1.4) items from the Alzheimer’s 
disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-
cog) were imputed for 18/137 (13%) of participants 
in the usual care arm and 33/281 (12%) in the 
exercise arm. Overall, deaths occurred in 5/165 (3%) 
participants in the usual care arm and 13/329 (4%) in 
the exercise arm. We carried out the exercise assessment 
at a median of 15 (interquartile range 9-25) days after 
randomisation, and the first session commenced at a 
median of 22 (14-33) days. The median time between 
attendance at the last exercise session and the first 
follow-up was 64 (50-80) days. Final follow-up was a 
median of 371 (365-379) days from randomisation, 
with no difference between groups.
Sample
Overall, primary outcome data were available for 
137/165 (83%) participants in the usual care arm 
and 281/329 (85%) in the exercise arm. Baseline 
characteristics for the randomised and analysed 
samples were well matched (table 1). Recruited men 
and women did not differ in age (mean difference 
−0.3 years, 95% confidence interval −1.69 to 1.16) 
or baseline ADAS-cog scores (−0.2, 95% confidence 
interval −1.86 to 1.41). More women than men lived 
alone (73/193 (38%) v 24/301 (8%), respectively). 
Most of the people with dementia were able to provide 
informed consent (376/484, 76%), some required a 
personal consultee (117/494, 24%), and one required 
a nominated consultee (1/494, 0.2%).
Intervention
Table 2 shows data on the profile of participants in the 
exercise arm, attendance, dose of exercise delivered, 
and physical fitness outcomes by compliance status. 
Overall, 21 physiotherapists and 17 assistants 
delivered 1697 face to face training sessions. 
Most of the participants assigned to the exercise 
arm (317/329, 96%) attended the physiotherapy 
assessment, and the proportion assessed as having 
comorbidity was high (278/317, 88%). The median 
group size was 6 (interquartile range 5-7). More than 
65% (214/329) of the participants were classed as 
compliers. Men were more likely to comply than 
women, otherwise there were no differences. Weight 
lifted improved in all strengthening exercises across 
the sessions, as did the duration of higher intensity 
aerobic activity. Over six weeks, the distance 
walked in six minutes improved by 18.1 m (95% 
confidence interval 11.6 m to 24.6 m; P<0.001). 
Most of the participants (245/329, 75%) received 
three motivational telephone calls after the sessions 
finished and 217/245 (88%) reported continuing 
with exercise at home.
Usual care and other interventions
No important differences were found in health and 
social care resource use (see appendix 1). Less than 
1% (3/415) of the participants used structured 
exercise outside of the trial prescription, less than 4% 
(15/415) reported attending a physiotherapist’s clinic, 
and nobody randomised to usual care accessed trial 
exercise sessions.

Adverse events
Twenty five adverse events occurred (eight were 
possibly 
related, 
nine 
probably 
related, 
and 
eight definitely related) and four serious related 
adverse events (one hospital admission for exercise 
induced angina, two injurious falls, and one case of 
substantially worsening hip pain) in the exercise arm 
and no reports in the usual care arm. In the exercise 
arm an adverse event was reported by 23/329 (7.0%, 
95% confidence interval 4.7% to 10.3%) participants.
Outcomes
Table 3 and figure 2 show the treatment effect estimates. 
Cognitive impairment declined over the 12 month 
follow-up in both trial arms. The exercise arm had 
higher global ADAS-cog scores at 12 months (adjusted 
mean difference −1.4, 95% confidence interval −2.6 to 
−0.2). Higher scores indicate worse cognition, although 
the average difference was less than the prespecified 
between group difference, and clinical relevance was 
uncertain. Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome 
were consistent in the direction of effect regardless 
of the method of accounting for missing data at item 
level (table 3). Imputation for missing cases yielded a 
complete intention to treat estimate of adjusted mean 
difference −1.3 (95% confidence interval −2.4 to 
−0.2). No evidence was found of differences in other 
secondary outcomes, including the rate of falls over 
12 months (incident rate ratio 1.1, 95% confidence 
interval 0.8 to 1.6; P=0.69).
The complier average causal effect estimate for 
the primary outcome was −2.0 (95% confidence 
interval −3.87 to −0.22) indicating worse cognitive 
impairment (below the prespecified between group 
difference) in those with higher attendance of sessions. 
No differences were found in carer burden or quality 
of life between the two interventions. There were no 
statistically significant subgroup effects (table 4).
At 12 months, interviewers reported that they knew 
the treatment assignment in 11/132 cases (8%) in

discussion
A four month aerobic and strengthening exercise 
programme of moderate to high intensity added 
to usual care does not slow cognitive decline in 
people with mild to moderate dementia. The exercise 
improved physical fitness in the short term, but this did 
not translate into improvements in activities of daily 
living, behavioural outcomes, or health related quality 
of life. There is the possibility that the intervention 
could worsen cognition.
Comparison with previous studies
The results disagree with several small studies.4 5 Most 
previous studies are single centre and many have 
uncertain allocation concealment and poor masking of 
outcome assessment.4 5 Smaller studies are more likely 
to draw erroneous conclusions. Previous studies might 
not have achieved as high a dose of exercise and some 
have mixed exercise and cognitive training making it 
difficult to isolate the effectiveness of different elements 
of the training programme. For example, the Finnish 
Alzheimer disease exercise (FINALEX) study compared 
a 12 month combined executive, strength and balance 
exercise programme at either home or in a group 
supervised setting versus usual care in people with 
mild to moderate dementia.25 Combined home exercise 
and cognitive training had a benefit on functional 
independence, a marginal benefit on executive function 
and falls, but no benefits on global cognitive function 
or mobility.25 Several other relatively large studies 
reported null effects on global cognition.4 5
Strengths and limitations of this study
In comparison with previous trials,4 5 we recruited 
a substantially larger sample size, used a measure 
of cognitive impairment recommended as a core 
outcome in consensus guidelines,26 27 and maintained 
high levels of follow-up. We used robust allocation 
concealment and masked outcome assessment. Loss 
to follow-up was low and baseline characteristics for 
the randomised and analysed samples were similar. 
We conducted a range of sensitivity analyses. Analysis 
of both observed and fully imputed data on cognitive 
impairment yielded a similar treatment effect estimate. 
No suggestion of a hidden effect in subgroups of 
mobility, cognition, sex, and underlying cause of 
dementia was found. As expected, the 95% confidence 
intervals within each subgroup were broader but 
consistent with the overall finding. We delivered a 
relatively high dose of exercise, with good compliance. 
The dose of strengthening exercise was at least equal 
to previous work in older people without dementia,28 
and much higher than that achieved in residential 
care settings where people are more frail and a similar 
intervention was found to improve balance but not 
cognitive or activities of daily living status.29
Participants and carers were not masked to 
allocation, but this is an unavoidable limitation. We

were successful in masking three quarters of interviews 
for the primary time point. The level of unmasking was 
higher in the exercise arm but it seems unlikely that 
this would account for our findings. Physical fitness 
improved,30 but we are limited to data in the exercise 
arm and during the structured exercise intervention 
period only. Hence we cannot conclude definitively 
that the intervention improves physical fitness. It is 
unlikely that fitness would have improved in the usual 
care arm as there was no evidence of engagement in 
exercise or physiotherapy. Subgroup analyses might 
be underpowered as the proportions in the various 
stratums were not balanced.21 We asked carers to recall 
falls events instead of using monthly calendar diaries. 
This might result in underestimation of the overall 
number of falls but is unlikely to affect the between 
group difference. We collected data on adverse events 
related to exercise in the intervention arm only. The 
period of structured exercise in our study might 
have been too short to produce positive benefits. We 
believe this unlikely as changes in physical fitness had 
occurred during the intervention but did not transfer 
into other clinically meaningful benefits. Withdrawal 
of the structured exercise programme by six months 
might have led to an accelerated decline in cognitive 
impairment mediated through social and affective 
mechanisms.
The numbers of people who declined participation in 
the trial was high and suggests that exercise might not 
be an attractive proposition. We recruited more men 
than women even though dementia is more common in 
women in western Europe.1 Compliance was better in 
men. Women might have found the offer or experience 
of exercise unattractive. Alternatively, more women 
were living alone, with the associated difficulties of 
motivating and getting themselves to sessions. We did 
not include an attention control, as our intention was 
for a pragmatic trial.
Interpretation
The study was designed as a superiority trial. 
Slowing cognitive decline was an ambitious target, 
but we anticipated at least a benefit in functioning 
in activities of daily living given broader knowledge 
about the effects of improved physical fitness.28 It is 
possible that cognition might have been worsened 
by the intervention. Whether the effect on cognitive 
impairment we observed is important is uncertain. 
We did not prespecify a value for a negative effect, 
but the average effect observed was smaller than 
our prespecified superiority target of 2.45 ADAS-cog 
points. An influential international consensus group 
suggests that a between group difference of 2 points 
(or 25%) might be worthwhile depending on the cost 
and safety profile of the intervention.27 Treatments in 
common use are associated with differences smaller 
than 2 points.20 In the context of the overall average 
annual decline in cognitive impairment, the decline 
in the usual care arm was consistent with published 
expectations,31 and the treatment difference was 
at least half as much as the annual rate of decline. 
Survival is on average 4.5 years in mild to moderate 
dementia.31 Worsening in cognitive impairment was 
greater in those who complied with the intervention 
and is physiologically feasible. High intensity training 
in healthy humans can have negative short term 
effects, including slow reoxygenation of cortical areas 
with a transient reduction in executive function.32 
Inflammation induced by higher levels of exercise 
might also be implicated.33
Recommendations and policy implications
Moderate to high intensity aerobic and strength 
exercise cannot be recommended as a treatment 
option for cognitive impairment in dementia. Future 
trials should explore other forms of exercise, including 
psychomotor protocols that are commonly used in long 
term neurological conditions where the primary intent 
is improving physical functioning. Investigators should 
consider the possibility that some types of exercise 
intervention might worsen cognitive impairment and 
of a “rebound” effect if the exposure to an intervention 
is to be time limited.
This exercise programme is not an effective way to 
manage cognitive impairment, functional impairment, 
or behavioural disturbances in older people with mild 
to moderate dementia.
Conclusion
A four month period of moderate to high intensity 
aerobic and strength exercise training, and ongoing 
support to exercise does not slow cognitive decline 
and might worsen cognitive impairment in people 
with mild to moderate dementia. Although moderate 
to high intensity exercise improves physical fitness, 
no clinical outcomes that we studied responded in a 
positive direction.
