Carcinosarcomas (CSs) of the uterus and ovary are highly aggres-
sive neoplasms containing both carcinomatous and sarcomatous
elements. We analyzed the mutational landscape of 68 uterine and
ovarian CSs by whole-exome sequencing. We also performed
multiregion whole-exome sequencing comprising two carcinoma
and sarcoma samples from six tumors to resolve their evolutionary
histories. The results demonstrated that carcinomatous and sarco-
matous elements derive from a common precursor having muta-
tions typical of carcinomas. In addition to mutations in cancer genes
previously identified in uterine and ovarian carcinomas such as TP53,
PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, KRAS, PTEN, CHD4, and BCOR, we found an ex-
cess of mutations in genes encoding histone H2A and H2B, as well
as significant amplification of the segment of chromosome 6p har-
boring the histone gene cluster containing these genes. We also
found frequent deletions of the genes TP53 and MBD3 (a member
with CHD4 of the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex) and
frequent amplification of chromosome segments containing the
genes PIK3CA, TERT, and MYC. Stable transgenic expression of
H2A and H2B in a uterine serous carcinoma cell line demonstrated
that mutant, but not wild-type, histones increased expression of
markers of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as tu-
mor migratory and invasive properties, suggesting a role in sarcoma-
tous transformation. Comparison of the phylogenetic relationships
of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements of the same tumors
demonstrated separate lineages leading to these two components.
These findings define the genetic landscape of CSs and suggest ther-
apeutic targets for these highly aggressive neoplasms.
uterine carcinosarcoma | ovarian carcinosarcoma | exome sequencing
C
arcinosarcomas (CSs) of the female genital tract, also known
as mixed malignant Müllerian tumors, are rare but highly
aggressive tumors characterized by a biphasic histology. These
cancers most commonly arise in the uterus, followed by the
ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina (1–3). The diagnosis of CS
requires the presence of both sarcomatous and carcinomatous
components. Although the pathogenesis of CSs remains under
debate, an increasing body of evidence supports the origin of
both elements from a common epithelial cell that undergoes
sarcomatous dedifferentiation, rather than two independent
progenitors (2–5).
The overall 5-y survival is only 30 ± 9% for all stages, and the
recurrence rate after surgery is extremely high (50–80%) (3–5).
The uncertain origin and poor prognosis of uterine and ovarian
CSs motivate determination of the molecular basis of CS ag-
gressive behavior in the hope of developing novel and effective
treatment modalities.
Results
The Genetic Landscape of CS. A total of 68 patients with stage I–IV
uterine (n = 44) and ovarian (n = 24) CSs were studied. Their
clinical and histological features are presented in SI Appendix,
Table S1. Upon surgical removal of tumors, primary cell lines
were prepared (five tumors) or tumors were frozen (63 tumors).
Among these tumors, 41 had matched normal tissues available
Significance
Some cancers, termed carcinosarcomas (CSs), have mixed cell
types, with either epithelial or mesenchymal features. Sequenc-
ing the genomes of uterine and ovarian CSs demonstrated that
these different cell types derive from a common precursor cell
that has many mutations typical of epithelial cancers. In addi-
tion, we find that these tumors have a significant burden of
point mutations and amplification of histone genes, suggesting
a potential role of these mutations in sarcomatous trans-
formation. Consistent with this finding, expression of specific
histone gene mutations in uterine carcinoma cells changed gene
expression toward a mesenchymal state. These findings have
potential implications for the treatment of these cancers.

 and tumor-normal pairs were subjected to whole-exome se-
quencing, with 197 mean reads per targeted base for tumor
samples and 101 for normal tissues; 94.5% of the targeted bases
had at least 20 independent sequence reads (SI Appendix, Table
S2). Tumor purity was estimated from the minor allele frequency
of somatic mutations and segments showing loss of heterozy-
gosity (LOH) or copy number variation (CNV); the mean tumor
purity was 81%. Somatic point mutations were identified using
MuTect (6) for normal-tumor pairs and were further filtered to
reduce false-positive calls (Materials and Methods). Somatic
indels were called by in-house Perl scripts (Materials and Meth-
ods). For unmatched tumors, we first called variants from the
reference sequence and then excluded variants that have a fre-
quency higher than 2 × 10−5 in the Exome Aggregation Con-
sortium (ExAC) database (7). Driver mutations were confirmed
by manual inspection of the reads plot, and selected mutations
were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
In total, 4,115 somatic point mutations (3,056 protein-altering
mutations) and 49 indels from the 41 matched normal-tumor
pairs were called. Based on tumor origin and histology of the
carcinomatous elements, we grouped tumors into three cate-
gories: uterine serous, uterine endometrioid, and ovarian serous.
Four samples from the uterine endometrioid group had markedly
higher somatic mutation rates (mean = 16.8 per megabase pair)
compared with the remainder (mean = 2.1 per megabase pair)
(Fig. 1). Mutation spectrum analysis revealed a paucity of trans-
version mutations in the high-mutation group, a signature often
observed in mismatch repair-deficient tumors. Mutation rates,
mutation spectra, and the fraction of genome affected by CNV
among the remaining 37 tumors were similar to those numbers
previously reported for uterine and ovarian carcinomas (8–10).
Recurrent somatic mutations were identified in the 37 matched
tumors and confirmed by Sanger sequencing; additional instances
of the identical mutations were sought in the 27 unmatched tumors
and were included in subsequent analysis. The results identified
eight genes with recurrent somatic missense mutations (Table 1).
These mutations included known activating mutations in the on-
cogenes PIK3CA (PI3-kinase subunit alpha) and KRAS (Kirsten
rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), a recurrent mutation in
PPP2R1A (phosphatase 2a regulatory subunit) that causes loss
of normal regulation of serine-threonine phosphatase 2a (11), a
known recurrent mutation (N1459S) in BCOR (BCL6 corepressor)
that is likely gain of function (8), and a known recurrent mutation
in CHD4 (DNA helicase) (9). There were also known recurrent
mutations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (tumor protein P53) and
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog). All of these genes have
been previously implicated in uterine and/or ovarian carcinomas.
In addition, we identified two tumors with a previously un-
identified somatic mutation in HIST1H2AB [G > C at chromo-
some 6 (chr6): 26033628; amino acid change, E57Q]. HIST1H2AB
encodes the histone H2A protein type 1-B/E. This gene has not
previously been implicated in cancer, and this variant was absent
from public and Yale University databases. The probability of
having any recurrent G:C > C:G mutation in this dataset by
chance, given the size of the exome, the number of tumors, and
the observed substitution-specific mutation rate (0.5 per megabase
pair), was low (P < 0.01).
To identify genes with an increased burden of somatic mutation,
we used MutSigCV (12) to analyze all somatic damaging muta-
tions (premature termination, splice site, and indel mutations) as
well as missense mutations at phylogenetically conserved sites in
the 37 matched tumors (Materials and Methods). With a genome-
wide false discovery rate of 0.1, we identified eight significantly
mutated genes (Fig. 1 and Table 2). In addition to genes identified
above as having recurrent mutations, we found a significant bur-
den of mutations in RB1 (a tumor suppressor gene significantly
altered in high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas), PIK3R1 (in-
hibitor of the PI3K pathway), and HIST1H2BJ (core histone 2B
type J). Close to the significance threshold, we found another
core histone gene HIST1H2BG (core histone 2B type J; q value =
0.19) and FBXW7 [a known tumor suppressor gene previously
identified in uterine serous carcinoma (USC); q value = 0.19].
The four core histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, are
small (98–136 aa in length), extremely highly conserved proteins
that together form the nucleosome, which packages DNA in
chromatin. Covalent modifications of these proteins play critical
roles in regulating gene expression (13). Genes encoding these
proteins are present in multiple copies in the genome in two
clusters (chr1p and chr6p), permitting high expression in S-phase
to allow assembly with newly replicated DNA. Further evalua-
tion of histone genes demonstrated a total of 10 protein-altering
mutations and one synonymous mutation (Table 3). Ten were
confirmed as somatic mutations by sequencing normal DNA,
whereas one was present in a tumor without an available matched
normal sample. All of these mutations are absent in germline
DNA databases. Although there are collectively 37 replication-
dependent H2A and H2B genes at chr1p and chr6p, all 10 of the
observed protein-altering mutations clustered among five of these

 genes, each with two mutations; analysis of individual sequence
reads provided no evidence that mutations were mismapped (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). Lastly, these specific histone genes were
expressed in CSs (SI Appendix, Fig. S2), and all observed muta-
tions were mutually exclusive. Considering all 37 copies of core
H2A and H2B genes as a single metagene yielded a P value for
burden of mutation of 8 × 10−7. Moreover, the striking clustering
of the 10 mutations among only five of these genes was highly
unlikely to occur by chance (P < 6 × 10−4). In contrast to CSs, no
excess burden of somatic mutation has been seen in these genes in
USC analyzed at Yale University or by The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), or in ovarian carcinoma, and no significant clustering of
mutations in particular genes has been observed (SI Appendix,
Table S3).
We compared the mutation spectrum in CSs with carcinomas
of the same tissue origin and histology; CSs included 26 uterine
serous, 17 uterine endometrioid, and 19 ovarian serous tumors
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). Comparator carcinomas were 92 USCs
[46 from our previous study (9) and 46 from the TCGA database
(8)], 104 uterine endometrioid carcinomas (8), and 316 ovarian
serous carcinomas (10). We found similarities in the frequency of
all driver mutations in CSs and these epithelial tumors. Mutations
in PTEN, KRAS, ARID1A, and PIK3CA were predominant in
uterine CSs with an endometrioid epithelial component, whereas
TP53, PIK3CA, CHD4, PPP2R1A, and FBXW7 mutations were
more frequently found in CSs with serous epithelial components.
TP53 was mutated in most ovarian CSs, whereas the remaining
genes were mutated only in a small fraction of tumors.
In contrast, mutations in histone H2A/H2B genes were sig-
nificantly enriched in CSs compared with carcinomas (mutations
in 21.2% of CSs and 5.2% of uterine and ovarian epithelial tu-
mors; Fisher P = 0.002; SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). These findings
implicate mutations in histone H2A/H2B genes in CSs, with
further support from CNV (discussed below).
Analysis of CNV. We identified CNV based on exome sequencing
data for 29 CSs that passed CNV calling quality control and 25
USCs from a study by Zhao et al. (9) (Materials and Methods).
We then used GISTIC2.0 (14) to identify chromosome segments
showing significantly more CNV than expected by chance (Ma-
terials and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Significantly am-
plified focal segments in CSs included chr3q27.1, which contains
PIK3CA. Focal segments containing the known tumor suppressor
genes TP53, PIK3R1, RB1, BRCA2, and MBD3 (the binding
partner of CHD4) were significantly deleted (SI Appendix, Figs.
S4 and S5). All of these CNVs are also frequently found in
uterine and ovarian carcinomas. In addition to segments shared
with uterine and ovarian carcinomas, we found significant broad
CNV that was specifically enriched in CSs. This CNV included
amplification of the segment of chr5p that includes TERT
(telomerase reverse transcriptase) (15), which was amplified in
50% of CSs but only 17% of carcinomas (SI Appendix, Fig. S6
and Table S4). This amplification has been implicated in other
cancers (16, 17). Similarly, chr6p was significantly amplified in
CSs (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 and Table S4; eight of 19 uterine CSs
and seven of 10 ovarian CSs). Interestingly, this segment contains
the replication-dependent histone gene cluster (HIST1H) and
includes all of the histone genes that are somatically mutated, as
described above. We also noticed that 1q22, which was identified
as a significantly amplified focal segment (found in 62% of CSs, SI
Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6) contains the HIST2H gene cluster, the
second largest cluster of core histone genes.
Impact of Histone H2A/H2B Mutations. We mapped mutations in
H2A and H2B onto the crystal structure of the core nucleosome
particle [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1AOI] (18) (Fig. 2).
Two mutations, H2A R4H and H2A K16T, occurred at sites of
previously identified posttranslational modification. R4 in the
N-terminal tail of H2A can be deaminated to citrulline (19), and
is implicated in linear compaction of chromatin (20). K16 has

 been identified as a site of DNA damage-dependent ubiquiti-
nation and, when mutated, leads to decreased ubiquitination of
H2A (21, 22). H2A residue E57, mutated to glutamine in two
samples, is potentially involved in maintaining the structural in-
tegrity of the H2A fold. The side chain of E57 hydrogen bonds
with the backbone nitrogen of Q25; the glutamine mutation is
likely to disrupt this interaction.
Similarly, H2B G27 packs closely against the DNA double
helix (23). The observed alanine substitution has the potential to
disrupt this packing. Two other mutations in H2B, E36G and
M63K, are located at the H2B–H2A heterodimerization interface.
E36 makes a side chain-mediated salt bridge with the side chain of
R24 in H2A, which would be lost with the glycine substitution.
M63 has extensive hydrophobic interaction with a patch on H2A,
which includes T60, I63, L64, and L84; this interaction would also
be lost with the lysine substitution. These mutations are thus both
likely to alter H2A–H2B interaction.
Somatic mutations in these H2A and H2B genes have not pre-
viously been implicated in cancer; however, some of these somatic
mutations have been seen previously as sporadic somatic mutations
in these or paralogous histone genes in diverse cancer types (24).
The association of these histone gene mutations with CS
prompted exploration of the possibility that somatic histone H2A
and H2B mutations play a role in epithelial–mesenchymal tran-
sition (EMT), contributing to evolution of carcinoma to sarcoma.
We stably transfected a USC cell line (i.e., USC-ARK2) to express
either the wild-type H2As (HIST1H2AB or HIST1H2AC) or the
same genes with observed somatic mutations in CSs (four muta-
tions were chosen) (Materials and Methods). All transgenes were
tagged with Myc and DDK epitopes at the C terminus and were
expressed under control of the CMV promoter. All six cell lines
showed high expression of transgenes. These transgenic H2As
were all incorporated in chromatin, as shown by imaging mitotic
cells stained for anti-DDK antibodies (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
EMT features the loss of epithelial markers, usually cell–cell
junction molecules, permitting cell migration and invasion. We
quantitated gene expression of several well-known epithelial
markers (E-cadherin, claudin-3, and claudin-4) in each of the
stable cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Compared
with cell lines expressing transgenic wild-type histones, cell lines
with mutant HIST1H2AC histones demonstrated significant re-
duction of all three epithelial markers (SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
Increases in the expression of N-cadherin and transcription factor
SNAI2/Slug are other common features seen in EMT and many
cancers. The qRT-PCR results showed a two- to threefold increase
of N-cadherin and SNAI2/Slug levels in cells expressing mutant
HIST1H2AC or HIST1H2AB proteins compared with wild type.
Finally, using transwell cell migration and invasion assays (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S9), we found mutated histone-core gene transfected
USC cells, but not cell lines expressing transgenic wild-type his-
tones, to acquire a significantly more migratory and more invasive
phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that histone
mutations identified in our CS cohort may drive at least some of
the molecular changes characteristics of EMT and the phenotypic
divergence of CSs from their corresponding carcinomas.
Evolution of CSs Defined by Multiregion Sequencing. To evaluate the
evolutionary histories of CSs, we dissected carcinomatous and
sarcomatous elements from six CSs; we took two separate car-
cinomatous and two sarcomatous samples from each tumor and
sequenced to a mean coverage depth of 261-fold (SI Appendix,
Fig. S10 and Table S5). Each sample was taken from a site re-
mote from other sites sampled in the same tumor.
A total of 473 different protein-altering somatic single-nucle-
otide mutations and indels were identified among these samples
(Materials and Methods). A total of 202 of these mutations and
indels were shared by all samples collected from the same tumors
(root mutations). The number of root mutations varied from 15 to
59 per tumor, unequivocally establishing that the carcinomatous

 and sarcomatous elements arise from a common precursor. In
addition, we found two to 53 nonsilent somatic mutations unique
to carcinomatous elements and two to 109 mutations unique to
sarcomatous elements. We next constructed phylogenetic trees for
samples from each tumor (Fig. 3) by hierarchical clustering of
allele frequencies for somatic mutations (Materials and Methods
and SI Appendix, Fig. S11). For all six tumors, the multiple sar-
comatous samples clustered with one another and separately from
the multiple carcinomatous samples (which also clustered with
one another). Of the 172 nonsilent mutations that were found in
two of the four samples, 102 were shared by the two sarcomatous
samples but not found in either of the carcinomatous components,
66 were found in the two carcinomatous components but not in
either of the two sarcomatous components, and four were found
present in both components. This distribution is not expected
under the null hypothesis that the lineage of each sample is in-
dependent (P < 10−4). The divergence between carcinomatous
and sarcomatous elements happened at different relative time
points during the evolution of CSs. Three tumors (Fig. 3 A–C)
demonstrated relatively late divergences, whereas the other three
(Fig. 3 D–F) had earlier divergences.
We next mapped mutations in cancer drivers on the phylo-
genetic trees. We defined potential driving mutations as non-
synonymous mutations in known ovarian and uterine cancer
genes (8–10, 25, 26). CNV information was not available for
most samples, because these samples were obtained from par-
affin-embedded samples; however, we were able to identify LOH
events affecting known driver genes in uterine and ovarian can-
cers (e.g., chr17p LOH containing TP53, chr4q LOH containing
FBXW7, chr10q LOH containing PTEN, chr5p LOH, chr6p
LOH). Among 34 such driving genetic events (point mutation and
LOH), 29 were root mutations, whereas five were sarcomatous
trunk-specific mutations (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, these mutations all
occurred in the same tumor, indicating such events may not occur
in most tumors. Four of the six tumors had TP53 root mutations
and were frequently accompanied by LOH events, indicating the
role of TP53 as an early driver. Among the rest of root driver
mutations, we found one PIK3CA activating mutation (E542K),
three PIK3R1 mutations (two indels and one missense mutation
at a conserved site), and one CHD4 indel. These three genes are
frequently mutated in uterine and ovarian carcinomas (8–10, 27)
but have rarely been seen in sarcomas (28) (SI Appendix, Table
S6). This finding suggests that CS likely begins as carcinoma,
followed by sarcomatous transformation. Two histone H2A/H2B
genes were mapped as root mutations, and another H2A gene
was found having a sarcomatous component-specific mutation.
The fact that histone mutations were acquired at different stages
during tumor progression suggests that these mutations may not
be sufficient for sarcomatous transformation of an epithelial tu-
mor in CS. Other genetic or nongenetic factors may be required
for this transformation.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that CSs, as a whole, have mutation
profiles that are similar to the mutation profiles found in epi-
thelial cancers of the uterus and ovary. In addition, however, we
found a significantly increased frequency of somatic mutations in
histone genes and amplifications of the histone gene locus on
chr6p, as well as significant amplification of TERT 5p in CSs,
suggesting that these mutations play a role in development of the
sarcomatous elements of these tumors. Separate sequencing of
multiple isolates of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements of
CSs demonstrated that these separate elements share in common
many somatic mutations, establishing unequivocally the common
genetic origin of these tumors. The finding that these root mu-
tations most often include mutations well-established to play a
role in carcinomas of the uterus and ovary is consistent with an
epithelial origin of these cancers. Because we have low sensitivity
for detection of structural rearrangements, we cannot exclude
the possibility that such events might also contribute to devel-
opment of the sarcomatous elements of these tumors.
Previous studies suggested that the carcinomatous component
represents the primary “driving force” of CSs and determines prog-
nosis (29). The finding of frequent mutations characteristic of uterine
and ovarian carcinomas, but not sarcomas, as well as carcinomatous
mutations common to the root of all CSs, is consistent with this
notion. These results also raise the possibility that treatments
targeting genes and pathways within the carcinomatous elements,
such as PIK3CA, CCNE1, and MYC (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis
viral oncogene homolog), may prove efficacious in treating both
carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements in these cancers.
Prior studies have found higher expression levels of specific
mesenchymal markers and lower levels of epithelial markers in
the sarcoma areas of CS compared with the carcinoma areas
(30). Our results suggest that specific histone gene mutations
contribute to this effect. Histone gene mutations have previously

Evolution paths of six CSs. (A–F) Each panel
shows the phylogenetic tree for one CS tumor that
has undergone multiregion sequencing. The tumor
name and number of root mutations are indicated at
the top of the phylogenetic tree. Ca1 and Ca2 are
samples dissected from carcinoma areas, Sa1 and Sa2
are samples dissected from sarcoma areas, root mu-
tations are mutations shared by all samples from the
same tumor, sarcomatous (carcinomatous) trunk mu-
tations are mutations shared by all sarcomatous
(carcinomatous) samples but never in the carcinoma-
tous (sarcomatous) samples, and sarcomatous (carci-
nomatous) are private mutations [mutations found in
sarcomatous (carcinomatous) samples besides trunk
mutations]. Branch length is proportional to the
number of nonsynonymous mutations. Driver genes
are significantly mutated histone genes, and LOH

 been implicated in several cancers. In follicular lymphoma, mutations
in histone H1 genes have been found to affect binding affinities and
residence times of affected H1 proteins (31). It was speculated that
such mutations would lead to changes in chromatin conformation and
altered gene regulation. In pediatric gliomas, recurrent mutations in
histone H3.3 at lysine 27 inhibit PRC2 activity and drive an oncogenic
expression pattern (32). Recently, a study pointed out that mutation
of H2A R4 in our CS cohort, consistent with expectation, may lead to
reduced chromatin compaction in cell culture experiments (20).
These findings lend credence to the likely functional effects of histone
gene mutations and amplifications identified in our cohort.
In conclusion, our results provide insight into the origins and
development of CS and define the genetic landscape of this type
of malignant tumor. These findings provide a useful starting
point for further work to define the causes and best therapeutic
approaches to this cancer.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Specimens. The collection of the specimens and the study pro-
tocol were approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the
University of Brescia, and the Yale University Human Investigation Com-
mittees. DNA was extracted from 68 tumors collected from newly diagnosed
patients, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. The 1988
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system was
used, and histology was further evaluated by board-certified pathologists to
confirm the diagnosis (SI Appendix).
Whole-Exome Sequencing. DNA was extracted from frozen samples by standard
methods. For formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, DNA was
extracted using a BiOstic FFPE Tissue DNA Isolation Kit (catalog no. 12250-50;
MO BIO Laboratories) with a modified protocol. Genomic DNA was captured
on the NimbleGen 2.1M human exome array and subjected to 74-bp end reads
on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument as described (33). Sequence reads were
mapped to the reference genome (hg19) using the ELAND program.
Somatic Single-Nucleotide Mutation Calling and Related Analysis. For matched
normal-tumor pairs, somatic point mutations were called by MuTect. The
output from MuTect was further filtered to remove false-positive calls. Somatic
indels were called by an in-house pipeline, and all indels have been manually
curated. For unmatched tumors, SAMtools was used to call variant bases
appended with quality scores. Among these unmatched tumors, variants with a
frequency greater than 2 × 10−5 in the ExAC database (7) were excluded.
Details of all somatic mutation-related analysis are provided in SI Appendix.
Somatic Copy Number Mutation Calling. The ratio of normalized coverage
depth between tumor and normal samples was calculated for each exome
capture probe. The genome was then de-noised and segmented by circular
binary segmentation (34). Copy number was assigned to each segment based
on both coverage depth ratio and deviation of the B-allele frequency using
in-house scripts (SI Appendix).
Transgenic USC-ARK2 Cell Line. pCMV6-Entry plasmids expressing HIST1H2AB
(RC211585) or HIST1H2AC (RC210259) were purchased from OriGene, and
desired mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene
QuickChangeII XL). The sequences of all plasmids were verified by direct
Sanger sequencing. Constructs were transfected into USC-ARK2 cells and
continuously selected using G418 (SI Appendix).
Immunofluorescence Microscopy, Western Blotting, and qRT-PCR. Protocols of
Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) followed previously
described methods (35). An EpiSeeker Histone Extraction Kit (ab113476; Abcam)
was used for histone extraction. Anti-myc antibody (Jackson Laboratory) was
used for detection of exogenous expression of histones in Western blotting,
and antibody against DDK tag (Sigma–Aldrich) was used in IF. RNA isolation
and qRT-PCR were performed using standard protocols on an ABI 7500 Real-
Time PCR instrument. Primer sequences are described in SI Appendix.
Cell Migration and Invasion Assays. Migration and invasion assays were per-
formed in 24-transwell chambers with polycarbonate membrane. Details are
provided in SI Appendix.
