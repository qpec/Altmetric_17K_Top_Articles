Aims
In patients with aortic stenosis (AS), risk stratification for aortic valve replacement (AVR) relies mainly on valve-
related factors, symptoms and co-morbidities. We sought to evaluate the prognostic impact of a newly-defined
staging classification characterizing the extent of extravalvular (extra-aortic valve) cardiac damage among patients
with severe AS undergoing AVR.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
Patients with severe AS from the PARTNER 2 trials were pooled and classified according to the presence or ab-
sence of cardiac damage as detected by echocardiography prior to AVR: no extravalvular cardiac damage (Stage 0),
left ventricular damage (Stage 1), left atrial or mitral valve damage (Stage 2), pulmonary vasculature or tricuspid
valve damage (Stage 3), or right ventricular damage (Stage 4). One-year outcomes were compared using Kaplan–
Meier techniques and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify 1-year predictors of
mortality. In 1661 patients with sufficient echocardiographic data to allow staging, 47 (2.8%) patients were classified
as Stage 0, 212 (12.8%) as Stage 1, 844 (50.8%) as Stage 2, 413 (24.9%) as Stage 3, and 145 (8.7%) as Stage 4. One-
year mortality was 4.4% in Stage 0, 9.2% in Stage 1, 14.4% in Stage 2, 21.3% in Stage 3, and 24.5% in Stage 4
(Ptrend < 0.0001). The extent of cardiac damage was independently associated with increased mortality after AVR
(HR 1.46 per each increment in stage, 95% confidence interval 1.27–1.67, P < 0.0001).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
This newly described staging classification objectively characterizes the extent of cardiac damage associated with
AS and has important prognostic implications for clinical outcomes after AVR.

Introduction
Current recommendations for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in pa-
tients presenting with aortic stenosis (AS) rely solely on the presence
of two criteria: (i) The demonstration of a severe stenosis based on a
grading system that comprises specific valvular criteria, including peak
aortic velocity (Vmax), mean transvalvular gradient, and aortic valve
area or aortic valve area index (AVAi), and (ii) the presence or ab-
sence of symptoms (dyspnea, heart failure, angina, or syncope)
related to AS.1,2 Additionally, risk stratification of patients for AVR is
currently based on the presence of comorbidities.1,2 There are no
recommendations regarding the importance of anatomical or func-
tional cardiac consequences of AS as a component of the AVR deci-
sion algorithm, other than reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic
function defined as a LV ejection fraction <50%, although the litera-
ture clearly documents that the presence of cardiac damage holds
prognostic significance. In this report, from a large contemporary
population of patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing AVR
(either surgery or transcatheter AVR), we sought to (i) better charac-
terize the prevalence of concomitant cardiac damage at the time of
AVR, (ii) categorize the different types of cardiac damage (LV dys-
function, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and right
ventricular dysfunction) into distinct stages of cardiac disease involve-
ment, and (iii) assess the impact of these stages on survival and the
risk of adverse outcomes after AVR.
Methods
Study population
The design of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER)
2 trial has previously been described, including a detailed description of
eligibility criteria and procedural methods.3,4 Data from the PARTNER
2A (N = 2032) and PARTNER 2B (N = 671) trials were pooled for this
analysis. The PARTNER 2 Trials were approved by the institutional re-
view board of each participating site and all patients provided written in-
formed consent.
Definitions
Patients were categorized into five stages (independent, not additive) de-
pending on the presence or absence of extravalvular (extra aortic valve)
cardiac damage or dysfunction as detected by transthoracic echocardiog-
raphy before AVR—Stage 0: No other cardiac damage detected; Stage 1:
LV damage as defined by presence of LV hypertrophy (LV mass index
>95 g/m2 for women, >115g/m2 for men),5 severe LV diastolic dysfunc-
tion (E/e0 > 14),6 or LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <50%);
Stage 2: LA or mitral valve damage or dysfunction as defined by the pres-
ence of an enlarged left atrium (>34mL/m2), the presence of atrial fibrilla-
tion, or the presence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation; Stage 3:
Pulmonary artery vasculature or tricuspid valve damage or dysfunction as
defined by the presence of systolic pulmonary hypertension (systolic pul-
monary arterial pressure >
_60mmHg) or the presence of moderate or se-
vere tricuspid regurgitation7,8; and Stage 4: RV damage as defined by the
presence of moderate or severe RV dysfunction (Figure 1).5,6,9,10 Patients
were hierarchically classified in a given stage (worst stage) if at least one
of the proposed criteria was met within that stage. These criteria were
chosen based on their broad acceptance, prior validation as markers of
abnormal cardiac function, their simplicity of acquisition, and their poten-
tial for future clinical external generalizability.1,2,5,6 The classification algo-
rithm as well as the statistical models were defined fully a priori. Frailty
was defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria:
(i) Katz index of independence in activities of daily living<6; (ii) 15-m walk
time >
_24s, (iii) serum albumin<3.8 g/dL, and (iv) grip strength<13kg
(women) or<26kg (men).11
Transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and follow-
up using a uniform image acquisition protocol. All studies were analysed

by a central core laboratory with quality and measurement methodology
previously reported.12,13 All adverse events were adjudicated by an inde-
pendent committee.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation and were
compared between groups using the Student’s t-test or the Wilcoxon
rank sum test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as
count and per cent, and compared using the v2 or the Fisher exact test.
We estimate time-to-event data using Kaplan–Meier techniques.
The unadjusted and adjusted risk of dying within 1 year according to
stage of cardiac damage was assessed using Cox proportional hazards re-
gression. Models were stratified by study (PARTNER 2A vs. PARTNER
2B) and treatment assignment (transcatheter vs. surgical), with the fol-
lowing variables included for multivariable adjustment: STS score, frailty,
age, sex, O2-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (O2-
COPD), coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, prior myocardial in-
farction, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, diabetes, Vmax, and AVAi.
In separate models, we assessed whether the variables STS score, frailty,
O2-COPD, Vmax, or AVAi moderated the effect of stage of cardiac dam-
age on mortality by including interaction terms between these variables
and the stage of cardiac damage in the Cox models. We also tested for
statistical interaction between the staging variable and study or treatment
assignment; these latter two models were not stratified by study or treat-
ment assignment. To determine the incremental value of the staging sys-
tem in regards to 1-year mortality predictability, we calculated the net
reclassification index (NRI) and the integrated discriminatory index (IDI)
for the stage variable by comparing Cox models including vs. excluding
the staging variable in addition to other patient characteristics.
To account for missing variables, we conducted separate sensitivity
analyses using multiple imputations and generated 40 imputed datasets. In
addition to the individual components of the staging algorithm, the fol-
lowing variables were included in the imputation model: Age, STS score,
renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery by-
pass grafting, O2-COPD, Katz frailty index, 15-foot walk time, serum albu-
min, grip strength, study, treatment assignment, Vmax, and AVAi.
Results
Study population
From the PARTNER 2A (n = 1114) and PARTNER 2B (n = 547) trials,
the primary study population comprised 1661 patients who had com-
plete echocardiographic assessments at baseline, which allowed for
patient staging (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). A total
of 1107 patients underwent transcatheter AVR, and 554 patients
underwent surgical AVR. At the time of AVR, 47 (2.8%) patients
were in Stage 0 (no cardiac damage), 212 (12.8%) patients were in
Stage 1 (LV damage), 844 (50.8%) patients were in Stage 2 (LA or mi-
tral valve damage), 413 (24.9%) patients were in Stage 3 (pulmonary
vasculature or tricuspid valve damage), and 145 (8.7%) patients were
in Stage 4 (RV damage) (Table 1). Baseline and procedural character-
istics according to stage are presented in see Supplementary material
online, Table S1. In general, patients in more advanced stages were
older, were more often male, had higher body mass index, higher
STS score and EuroSCORE, more often had diabetes, more often
had previous myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting,
and were more often frail and had O2-COPD. Rates of each individ-
ual cardiac damage component within each stage are presented in
see Supplementary material online, Table S2, and rates of each prior
stages within each stages are presented in see Supplementary mater-
ial online, Figure S2.
Outcomes
One-year outcomes after AVR stratified by stage of cardiac damage
are presented in Table 2 and Figure 2. At 1 year, all-cause death (Figure
2A) and cardiac death (Figure 2B) significantly increased with each
stage of worsening cardiac damage. Landmark analysis demonstrated
consistent relationship between extent of cardiac damage prior to
AVR and the occurrence of death or cardiac death (Figure 2C and D)
beyond 30 days. Supplementary material online, Figure S3 presents
1-year adjusted survival curves for death and cardiac death, with
consistent results. Supplementary material online, Figure S4 presents
1-year outcomes after excluding patients with prior coronary artery
bypass grafting and O2-COPD. Results of all sensitivity analyses were
consistent with the main analysis.
Predictors of 1-year death
After multivariable analysis and when tested in multiple models, stage
of cardiac damage was shown to be one of the strongest predictors
of 1-year death, with an adjusted mortality hazard of �1.45 with each
increase in stage (Table 3). Frailty and O2-COPD were the only other

identifiable predictors of 1-year death after AVR. Stage of cardiac
damage had incremental value over other covariates for prediction of
1-year death after AVR, with NRI and IDI consistently showing im-
provement after the addition of the staging variable to several
different nested models (see Supplementary material online, Table
S3). In particular, the addition of stage of cardiac damage as a co-
variable was shown to reclassify a significant proportion of patients
compared with STS (NRI= 0.149) and frailty (NRI = 0.126) variables

in regard to 1-year mortality prediction. No interaction was detected
between AVR strategy (surgical AVR vs. transcatheter AVR)
(Pinteraction = 0.28), STS (Pinteraction = 0.13), frailty (Pinteraction= 0.98),
O2-COPD (Pinteraction= 1.00), AVAi (Pinteraction = 0.75), or Vmax
(Pinteraction = 0.87) and stage of cardiac damage in regard to the occur-
rence of 1-year death.
Sensitivity analysis
Baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients included and
excluded in the present study are presented in Supplementary mater-
ial online, Tables S4 and S5. Stage of cardiac damage showed a strong
unadjusted and adjusted association with mortality after multiple
imputation of missing data (see Supplementary material online, Table
S6), consistent with the main analysis.
Discussion
The current report, derived from 1661 patients who underwent
comprehensive echocardiographic assessment before AVR, dem-
onstrated a strong relationship between the extent of cardiac
damage at baseline and 1-year survival after AVR. The proposed
anatomic and functional cardiac damage staging system, was
shown to be one of the strongest predictors of mortality. For

Our report also demonstrated that this new staging system had
significant incremental value for prediction of 1-year survival over
several well-established predictors of worse outcomes after AVR,
including patient frailty and the STS score.
Current guidelines recommend risk stratification of patients with
AS using the integration of different variables including the severity of
AS, the presence or absence of AS-related symptoms, and the pres-
ence of other risk factors such as STS score, frailty, or the comprom-
ise of other major organ systems (e.g. kidney disease, lung disease)1,2;
however, no clear recommendation exists on how to incorporate
the extent of consequential (or associated) cardiac damage in clinical
decision making related to AS. Given the strong association demon-
strated in this study between advanced staging of cardiac damage and
worse clinical outcomes after AVR, consideration of the stage of AS-
related cardiac damage in future recommendations for risk stratifica-
tion might be useful.
Notably, we demonstrated that the extent of cardiac damage re-
mains one of the strongest independent predictors of 1-year mortal-
ity post-AVR after controlling for important prognostic factors such
as STS score and the presence of frailty, coronary artery disease,
renal disease, or O2-COPD. After adjustment, only stage of cardiac
damage, frailty, and O2-COPD remain predictors of 1-year mortality.
This finding is important and may have identified meaningful variables
that could be easily incorporated in a simple risk-prediction model
beyond the standard STS. In the current report, a high proportion of
patients enrolled in the two-pooled studies were at particularly high
risk, with multiple comorbidities. Therefore, it is expected that in a
lower risk population (i.e. with minimal comorbidities), the extent of
cardiac damage at baseline could play an even greater role in risk pre-
diction. Similarly, extent of cardiac damage was a considerably stron-
ger predictor of adverse outcomes after AVR than both Vmax and
AVAi, underscoring the fact that the valvular haemodynamic burden
is effectively corrected by AVR whereas the detrimental impact of
extravalvular consequences of AS often persists after AVR.
It is important to note that patients classified with more advanced
stages also demonstrated higher non-cardiac mortality. This finding is
not surprising since patients with more advanced cardiac disease are
known to be more vulnerable to any other new insult (such as infec-
tion, bleeding, trauma, etc.), and to have a decreased physiological re-
serve to fight any additional disease process. That being said,
identifying the exact cause of death among elderly patients with mul-
tiple co-morbidities could be challenging, with often an initial event
triggering a cascade of consequences, ultimately leading to death.
Interestingly, the natural evolution or ‘propagation’ of AS associ-
ated cardiac damage doesn’t seem to occur systematically in a se-
quential fashion. Indeed, among patients with more advanced stages
(3 or 4), lower than expected proportion of patients cumulated dam-
age from earlier stages (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
For instance, among the 145 patients presenting with moderate to se-
vere RV failure, only 25% presented with severe pulmonary hyper-
tension, and �75% with left atrial enlargement (see Supplementary
material online, Table S2). These finding are intriguing and may sug-
gest that the extension of cardiac damages related to a LV pressure
overload such as AS may not always be sequential (LV, LA, pulmon-
ary vasculature, and then RV dysfunction), and may vary based on pa-
tient susceptibility or genetic predisposition.14–16 In this regard,
recent studies demonstrated that the occurrence of LV hypertrophy
or LV dysfunction may impact RV function early, either by ventricular
interdependence, by contiguous extension of the pathological re-
sponse to pressure overload, or by systemic hormonal response to
left ventricle overload or genetic predisposition to hypertrophy af-
fecting both ventricles.17–19 Further prospective mechanistic investi-
gations related to the natural evolution of cardiac damages among
patients with AS are needed to better characterize these hypothesis-
generating findings.
Strengths and limitations
The current report has several strengths. It was derived from a sub-
stantial number of patients who underwent comprehensive echocar-
diographic analysis before AVR evaluated by an independent
echocardiographic core laboratory, and it describes for the first time
a simple and intuitive physiologic classification, reflecting the natural
evolution of AS and bearing prognostic implications. Additionally,
outside the current report, the proposed classification may have po-
tential clinical and research utility: (i) It may improve clinical risk strati-
fication of patients prior to AVR; (ii) it provides a tool for clinician to
better communicate to patients risks, benefits, and expected prog-
nostic after AVR; (iii) by acknowledging some of the technical chal-
lenges, variability, and discordances in echocardiographic acquisition
of currently recommended severity grading criteria,20–29 the pro-
posed multi-parametric stratification system may synergistically help
to better define the optimal timing of AVR by focusing on the conse-
quences and mechanical repercussion of AS (Figure 3); and (iv) it may
represent a standardized tool to better describe, stratify, and quantify
cardiac damage during a randomized trial or other research work, ei-
ther at baseline or following diverse treatment or therapeutic
strategies.
The current report has many limitations. First, the described stag-
ing classification was retrospectively and not prospectively studied;
future ongoing trials will be able to prospectively confirm the prog-
nostic value of this new classification scheme (PARTNER 3
[NCT02675114], TAVR UNLOAD [NCT02661451], PROGRESSA
[NCT01679431], EARLY TAVR NCT03042104). Second, a substan-
tial amount of echocardiographic data were missing, leading to the
exclusion of a high proportion of patients. That being said, our ana-
lysis is by far the largest cohort of patients with core laboratory adju-
dicated
echocardiogram

events
adjudication, making this manuscript unique. Third, the current stag-
ing system infers a direct causal role between the presence of AS and
the detected cardiac damage. While concomitant comorbidities and
diseases (e.g. severe coronary artery disease, severe lung disease)
may co-exist and the detected cardiac damage may not be com-
pletely due to the AS, given the strong association with mortality,
one could argue that this cardiac-oriented classification still has value
when applied in a real-world setting. Indeed, patients with severe AS
and several concomitant diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, ischaemic cardiomyopathy) are much more vulnerable to
any new ‘insult’ (e.g. pneumonia), and any potential deterioration or
extent of the already existent cardiac damage may not be well toler-
ated, leading to poor outcomes, even after successful AVR.
However, after excluding patients with severe lung disease and prior
coronary artery bypass grafting (severe CAD), our results were

unchanged (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3), supporting
the value of this classification among all patients with AS. Fourth,
more detailed and granular detection of cardiac damage involving dif-
ferent imaging modalities exist. These include detection of reduced
LV strain,30–33 LA strain,34 or RV strain35–37 by speckle tracking echo-
cardiography and the presence of myocardial fibrosis by magnetic
resonance imaging.38 When available, these findings could be incor-
porated into the appropriate anatomical staging level (i.e. reduced LV
strain in Stage 1, reduced LA strain in Stage 2), resulting in the expan-
sion and improvement of the proposed staging system. Similarly,
serum biomarkers, with specific capability to identify LV, LA, or RV
overload, could also eventually complement this classification.39–42
Fifth, outcomes were available up to 1 year only; however, longer-
term follow-up (up to 5 years) would have most likely amplified the
observed difference in mortality between each level of cardiac dam-
age. Finally, the concept behind the proposed staging system could
be adapted and applied to other valvular disease.
In conclusion, this new staging classification characterizes the ex-
tent of anatomical and functional cardiac damage associated with AS
prior to AVR and has prognostic implications post-AVR. Further
studies are needed to prospectively validate this classification across
different AS severities and to better define how it could be integrated
to existing grading severity system in guiding AVR timing for patients
with AS
