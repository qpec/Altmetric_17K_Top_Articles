Abstract
Background: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with increased risk of obesity,
diabetes, heart disease and dental caries. Our aim was to assess the effects of plain packaging, warning labels,
and a 20 % tax on predicted SSB preferences, beliefs and purchase probabilities amongst young people.
Methods: A 2 × 3 × 2 between-group experimental study was conducted over a one-week period in August 2014.
Intervention scenarios were delivered, and outcome data collected, via an anonymous online survey. Participants
were 604 New Zealand young people aged 13–24 years who consumed soft drinks regularly. Participants were
randomly allocated using a computer-generated algorithm to view one of 12 experimental conditions, specifically
images of branded versus plain packaged SSBs, with either no warning, a text warning, or a graphic warning, and
with or without a 20 % tax. Participant perceptions of the allocated SSB product and of those who might consume
the product were measured using seven-point Likert scales. Purchase probabilities were measured using 11-point
Juster scales.
Results: Six hundred and four young people completed the survey (51 % female, mean age 18 (SD 3.4) years). All
three intervention scenarios had a significant negative effect on preferences for SSBs (plain packaging: F (6, 587) = 54.4,
p <0.001; warning label: F (6, 588) = 19.8, p <0.001; 20 % tax: F (6, 587) = 11.3, p <0.001). Plain packaging and warning
labels also had a significant negative impact on reported likelihood of purchasing SSB’s (p = <0.001). A 20 % tax
reduced participants’ purchase probability but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2).
Conclusions: Plain packaging and warning labels significantly reduce young people’s predicted preferences for, and
reported probability of purchasing, SSBs.

Background
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is
associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart
disease, and dental caries [1–4]. Interventions such as
effective nutrition labelling, marketing restrictions, and
taxes have been proposed as strategies to improve diets,
tackle obesity, and reduce healthcare costs [5]. Research
on another ‘dangerous consumption’
, tobacco, has shown
plain packaging, warning labels and excise taxes are all
highly effective ways to reduce consumption [6–10]. A
number of countries have levied taxes on SSBs (e.g.
Mexico, France, Hungary, and several states in the
United States of America) and emerging evidence sug-
gests that they are effective [11]. For example, evaluation
of a recently introduced 10 % tax on SSBs in Mexico

 shows an average 6 % decline in purchases of taxed bev-
erages in 2014 relative to the counterfactual [12].
Less is known however regarding the effects of warn-
ing labels and plain packaging on diets. In Finland,
warning labels are mandatory on foods high in salt and
their introduction led to a decrease in availability of high
salt foods [13], thus reportedly contributing to reduc-
tions in population salt intakes over time [14]. Sales of
diet soft drinks were also significantly reduced after
introduction of saccharin warning labels in the USA
[15], and from December 2015, New York City chain
restaurants have had to place warnings on high salt
menu items [16]. Experimental research suggests that
warning labels on SSBs reduce parents’ intentions to
purchase SSBs for their children [17].
In 2014, a bill was proposed for introduction of
warning labels on SSBs in California, although it was
subsequently rejected [18]. The city of San Francisco
has however approved the warning label, “WARNING:
Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to
obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay” on advertisements
for SSBs [19].
Although a number of studies have shown that brand-
ing influences children’s food preferences [20, 21], the
effects of plain packaging and warning labels on SSB
preferences and potential consumption are unknown.
Therefore we undertook an online experiment to assess
the effects of plain packaging, warning labels (text and
graphic), and a 20 % tax on predicted product prefer-
ences, beliefs and SSB purchase probabilities amongst
young people in New Zealand. The tax scenario was in-
cluded as a reference comparator for the plain packaging
and warning label intervention scenarios.
Methods
Study design
A 2 (branded packaging, unbranded packaging) × 3 (no
warning label, text warning label, graphic warning
label) × 2 (no tax, 20 % tax) between-group experimental
study design was used, with the intervention scenarios
delivered online and outcome data collected entirely via
online survey. The study was undertaken in New Zealand
over one week in August 2014. Ethical approval was re-
ceived from the University of Auckland Human Partici-
pants Ethics Committee on August 1st 2014 (reference
number 012200) and all study participants provided in-
formed consent.
Recruitment
People were eligible for inclusion in the study if they re-
ported consuming SSB in the previous two months, and
were aged between 13–24 years. Recruitment of 16–24
year olds was undertaken by a market research company,
Research Now, which invited a random sample of their
panel members aged 16 or older to participate in the
study. Younger participants (aged 13–16 years) were
additionally recruited via parents who were panel mem-
bers. Recruitment continued until at least 600 eligible
respondents consented to take part and were rando-
mised. All participants received a nominal monetary re-
ward (NZ$1, equivalent to US$0.72, €0.64 on 20 May
2016) for 16–24 year olds, and NZ$3, (US$2.17, €1.93)
for parents who consented to their 13–16 year old chil-
dren participating) on completion of the study.
Interventions
Participants were randomly allocated using a computer-
generated algorithm to view one of 12 experimental
conditions, specifically images of branded versus plain
packaged SSB cans, with either no warning, a text warn-
ing, or a graphic warning, and price with or without a
20 % tax (Fig. 1). Images were of a well-known carbon-
ated SSB, and the same brand name was used through-
out. The plain packaging image used the same colour as
that regulated under Australia’s tobacco plain packaging
laws, ‘Pantone 448 C’. The brand name was written in
size 14, bold Arial font.
The text warning was presented in an orange-coloured
octagon and covered approximately one eighth of the
front side of the can. It stated “WARNING: high sugar
content” in size 6, bold Arial font. The format was based
on that of the Chilean warning labels for foods high in
energy, sodium, saturated fat or sugar to be imple-
mented in July 2016 [22]. The graphic warning label was
modelled on graphic tobacco health warnings currently
used in New Zealand, and displayed an image of dental
caries with the accompanying message “WARNING: con-
suming beverages with added sugar contributes to tooth
decay”. Tooth decay was chosen as the health outcome
because there is a strong relationship between sugar
consumption and dental caries [23], and it is a more im-
mediate consequence of SSB consumption than obesity.
As with the text-only warning label, the pictorial label
covered approximately one eighth of the soft drink can’s
face. The graphic part of the warning made up half of
the label and the text took up the other half (size 6, bold
Arial font for the ‘WARNING’ and size 4, bold Arial font
for the rest of the message).
The tax/no tax scenarios were operationalised by
presenting the usual (average) price of a can of the dis-
played SSB (NZ$2.00, equivalent to US$1.44, €1.29) or
the price of a can with 20 % tax applied (NZ$2.40,
US$1.73, €1.55) directly below the images.
Data collection and outcome measures
Prior to the survey, data were collected on participants’ key
demographic characteristics, usual consumption of com-
mon foods and beverages, and frequency of consumption
Bollard et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2016) 13:95 
Page 2 of 7
 of a range of beverages including carbonated drinks, en-
ergy drinks, milk, and juices. These also served as screen-
ing questions to ensure respondents were in the target age
range and had consumed SSBs in the previous two
months.
Following randomisation, participants viewed the allo-
cated image, and used a seven-point rating scale to
answer
questions
regarding
attitudes
and
predicted
product preferences. Specific semantic differential atti-
tude statements assessed whether participants believed
the displayed SSB was: expensive/cheap, unattractive/
attractive, low quality/high quality, uncool/cool, un-
healthy/healthy, and tasted bad or good. As adoles-
cents and young adults often consume SSBs in public
settings, and brands are used to communicate aspects
of consumers’ identities [24], we also asked questions
regarding their perceptions of a peer if they were
drinking from the can displayed. Perceptions were
measured using four semantic differential questions
anchored
by:
boring/interesting,
unpopular/popular,
unfashionable/fashionable, and old/young.
The 11-point Juster Scale was used to measure the “in
the moment” probability of purchasing the displayed
drink if it were one of the options available at a conveni-
ence store, where 0 represented “no chance or almost no
chance”, 5 represented “fairly good possibility”, and 10
represented “certain or practically certain” [9, 25]. Five-
point Likert scales were used to measure participants’ at-
titudes towards proposed implementation of warning la-
bels and taxes on SSBs. Two versions of the survey were
used, one for the young adult group (17–24 years), and
another, with simpler language, targeted to the adoles-
cent group (13–16 years).
Sample size and analysis
Assuming a standard deviation of 1.0, power calculations
indicated that a sample size of 600 participants (50 par-
ticipants per experimental scenario) would provide 80 %
power to detect a minimum one-point difference in pur-
chase probability on the Juster scale.
Independent sample t-tests were used to assess differ-
ences in mean predicted preference scores as a result of
packaging or taxes, and a one-way Analysis Of Variance
(ANOVA) was used to assess differences in product
preferences as a result of warning labels. A three-way
ANOVA was conducted to determine whether the three
experimental scenarios were associated with significant
effects on participants’ likelihood to buy SSBs. Multivari-
ate Analyses Of Variance (MANOVA) were undertaken
to assess the relationships between the interventions.
Results
Six hundred and four panel members responded to the
study invitation, met study inclusion criteria, and com-
pleted the online survey. Three hundred and three were
recruited directly from the panel (age range 16–24 years)
and 301 were recruited via parent members (age range
13–16 years). All questions were completed by all partic-
ipants. Key demographic characteristics are detailed in
Table 1. Fifty one percent of the sample was female, and
mean age was 18.4 years (SD 3.4). Participants were pre-
dominantly of New Zealand European ethnicity (77 %)
with fewer identifying as Maori, Pacific or other ethnici-
ties. More than half the survey participants (n = 350,
58 %) reported consuming SSBs between one and three
times per month, while 49 (8.1 %) consumed SSB at least
once a day.

 Impact of interventions on product preferences
Compared with the control of a branded SSB can with
no warning label or tax applied, all three interventions
had a significant negative effect on predicted preferences
for SSBs (plain packaging: F (6, 587) = 54.4, p <0.001;
warning label: F (6, 588) = 19.8, p <0.001; and 20 % tax:
F (6, 587) = 11.3, p <0.001) (Table 2). Plain packaging led
to significantly lower predicted preference scores com-
pared with branded packaging for all measures, except
beliefs regarding the healthiness of soft drinks for which
there was no difference. As expected, graphic warning
labels impacted predicted preferences more negatively
than text warning labels. Compared to non-tax condi-
tions, a 20 % tax was associated with perceptions of the
product as more expensive (p = <0.001), tasting worse
(p = 0.025), and appearing less ‘cool’ (p = 0.034). The
tax had no significant effect on other measures how-
ever. A significant interaction was found between
packaging and warning labels for the attractiveness of
the can itself (F (2,592) = 14.9, p = <0.001), and be-
tween packaging and a 20 % tax for how interesting/
boring a typical user was perceived to be (F (1,592) =
4.13, p = 0.04).
Impact of interventions on likelihood to buy SSBs
Compared with branded packaging, plain packaging sig-
nificantly decreased reported likelihood of buying SSBs
(2.6 on Juster scale versus 4.1, p = <0.001). Text and
graphic warning labels also significantly decreased likeli-
hood of buying SSBs compared with no warning label:
3.3 (text warning) and 2.7 (graphic warning) on Juster
scale versus 3.9 (no warning), p = <0.001. The 20 % tax
had no significant effect on probability of purchasing
(3.2 versus 3.5, p = 0.2) (Fig. 2). The two-way ANOVA
revealed that plain packaging (F = 49.0, p < 0.001) and
warning labels (F = 9.5, p < 0.001) had a significant ef-
fect on purchase probability, while a 20 % tax did not
(F = 1.7, p = 0.2).
Attitudes towards implementation of warning labels and
taxes
Two thirds of participants (66 %) agreed/strongly agreed
that SSBs should carry a text warning label while half
(50 %) agreed/strongly agreed with introduction of
graphic warning labels. Fewer participants agreed with
application of a tax to SSBs (35 % supported a proposed

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge this is the first research to
examine the effects of plain packaging and warning la-
bels on young people’s predicted preferences for, and
likelihood to buy, SSBs. The online experiment suggests
that plain packaging and warning labels reduce young
people’s preferences for, and reported likelihood to buy,
SSBs. Of the experimental conditions examined, plain
packaging had the most significant negative impact on
predicted product preferences, and was associated with
less positive perceptions of those who might consume
the product. These results align with findings from studies
of plain packaging for tobacco products [6, 9, 26].
Addition of a warning label also had a significant negative
impact on predicted SSB preferences. A text-only warning
label, recently proposed as a potential public health policy
to reduce intake of SSBs [18], reduced perceived product
attractiveness, quality and taste, and reduced perceptions
of consumer “coolness”. Similar research examining how
warning labels on SSBs influenced parents’ choices found
they improved parents’ understanding of health harms as-
sociated with over-consumption of SSBs and reduced in-
tentions to purchase SSBs for their children [17].

 Although graphic warning labels have not yet been
proposed for SSBs, this research suggests they would be
more effective than text warning labels. Furthermore,
warning labels had a greater effect when placed on bev-
erages with plain packaging compared with branded
packaging, suggesting that attractive branding and col-
ours on SSBs may reduce effectiveness of warning labels.
These results are again consistent with tobacco research
[8, 9, 27].
Given the success of tobacco taxes in reducing con-
sumption [7, 10] and emerging evidence of behavioural
effects of SSB taxes [12], our finding of only a weak ef-
fect of a 20 % tax in this study is unexpected. It is pos-
sible however that this was due to how taxes were
operationalised in this study where price was displayed
in text below the SSB image rather than on a more
prominent price label such as those used in supermar-
kets or convenience stores. The price information may
not have been sufficiently visually salient, and the ab-
sence of comparator priced products may have limited
participants’ ability to judge the relative cost of the prod-
ucts. Our finding may also reflect the relative import-
ance of price and branding to young people. Although
smoking research finds that price responsiveness varies
inversely with age [28], brand image and social recogni-
tion may have an even more powerful influence on ado-
lescents’ preferences and decision making [29].
Limitations
The online survey method was convenient and quick for
participants, and likely had a low level of social desirabil-
ity bias given no interviewer was present and anonymity
was maintained. The study also had a sufficiently large
sample size to detect a minimum one-point difference in
purchase probability measured on an 11-point Juster
scale. Some limitations are however noted. First, the
scenarios were hypothetical and respondents did not ac-
tually purchase the drinks in question; as such their re-
sponses
reflect
self-predictions
rather
than
actual
behaviour [30]. Whilst this limitation applied to all inter-
vention groups equally and thus affects the external val-
idity of our findings rather than internal validity, future
experiments could extend this work by presenting par-
ticipants with real beverages and asking them to pur-
chase their chosen one. Second, findings may not be
widely generalizable to the New Zealand population.
The survey response rate was low and the proportion
of Maori and Pacific participants was lower than in
the general New Zealand population of the same age
(11 % Maori vs 16 %, and 3 % Pacific vs 8 %), whilst
51 % of survey participants were not employed/work-
ing compared to 17 % of 15–24 year olds at a na-
tional level. In addition, only one brand and size of
SSB was used in this study so further testing would
be necessary to determine if findings are generalizable
across other brands and products. Finally, the text
warning label used in the study was in fact a type of
graphic warning because the octagon may have in-
voked a “Stop Sign” association. This format was
chosen because we wanted to base our experiment on
labelling interventions being considered or implemented
in the real-world where possible. However, it would be
useful to repeat the experiment using a simple text warn-
ing to determine if effects are similar.
Conclusions
Plain packaging and warning labels could significantly
reduce adolescents’ and young adults’ preferences for
and likelihood to purchase SSBs, and may therefore re-
duce consumption. These labelling measures warrant
consideration as part of a comprehensive portfolio of
strategies to reduce young people’s SSB intakes and re-
duce rates of childhood obesity.
