ccording to the World Health Organization, one half of 
the world’s population lives in poverty and burns solid 
fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating purposes, and the 
resultant household air pollution (HAP) is the third largest 
risk factor for global disease burden, contributing to an esti-
mated 3.5 million deaths in 2010.1,2 Although these deaths are 
traditionally attributed to pneumonia in children and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in adults,3 data 
attempting to show a direct link between HAP and cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) mortality are limited.4 Inferences on the 
relationship between HAP and CVD are based largely on a 
growing body of evidence showing that HAP is associated 
with CVD risk factors and morbidity,5–13 as well as known data 
associating ambient air pollution and direct tobacco inhalation 
with CVD mortality.14–16

Clinical Perspective on p 2369
Given the increasing prevalence of CVD worldwide, it 
is prudent to identify novel modifiable risk factors for CVD 
Background—Household air pollution is the third largest risk factor for global disease burden, but direct links with 
cardiovascular disease mortality are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between household fuel use 
and cardiovascular disease mortality.
Methods and Results—The Golestan Cohort Study in northeastern Iran enrolled 50 045 individuals 40 to 75 years of age 
between 2004 and 2008 and collected data on lifetime household fuel use and other baseline exposures. Participants were 
followed up through 2012 with a 99% successful follow-up rate. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to calculate 
hazard ratios for associations between pehen (local dung), wood, kerosene/diesel, or natural gas burning for cooking 
and heating and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, with adjustment for lifetime exposure to each of these fuels and 
potential confounders. A total of 3073 participants (6%) died during follow-up; 78% of these deaths were attributable 
to noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular, oncological, and respiratory illnesses. Adjusted 10-year hazard 
ratios from kerosene/diesel burning were 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.10) and 1.11 (95% confidence interval, 
1.06–1.17) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Subtype-specific analyses revealed a significant 
increase in ischemic heart disease (10-year hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.21) and a trend toward 
cerebrovascular accident (10-year hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–1.17) mortality. Stratification by sex 
revealed a potential signal for increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality among women compared 
with men, with similar risk for ischemic heart disease mortality.
Conclusions—Household exposure to high-pollution fuels was associated with increased risk for all-cause and 
cardiovascular disease mortality. Replicating these results worldwide would support efforts to reduce such exposures.

burden that may be endemic to low- and middle-income coun-
tries.17,18 Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the 
association between household fuel use and CVD mortality.
Methods
The Golestan Cohort Study, originally a prospective study of esopha-
geal cancer, enrolled 50 045 individuals 40 to 75 years of age in Gonbad 
City and 326 villages in the Golestan province of northeastern Iran 
between 2004 and 2008. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods 
of data collection have been discussed in detail elsewhere.19 The eth-
ics review committees of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 
the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the National 
Cancer Institute approved the study methods, and all participants 
signed a written informed consent at enrollment. A lifestyle question-
naire was administered to each study participant to collect informa-
tion on age at enrollment, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, urban 
or rural residence, physical activity, diet, tobacco consumption, alco-
hol consumption, opium consumption, and personal medical history. 
Anthropometric data and blood pressure were measured and recorded 
for each participant. Economic status was derived from a composite 
score of wealth, in accord with earlier publications,20 by applying mul-
tiple correspondence analyses to appliance ownership data (including 
bath in residence, personal car, motorbike, black-and-white television, 
color television, refrigerator, freezer, vacuum, and washing machine).
The lifestyle questionnaire also tabulated years of exposure to 
household fuels for cooking and heating separately over each study 
participant’s lifetime. Included fuels were natural gas (liquefied 
petroleum gas), kerosene/diesel, wood, and pehen (local term for cow 
dung). Lifetime exposure to each fuel type was calculated for cooking 
and heating separately and then combined to obtain an aggregate life-
time exposure (in years) to each fuel type while accounting for over-
lap periods to avoid overestimation of the years of exposure. Each 
year of overlap was counted as 1 year of fuel exposure in the final 
analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed by counting each year 
of overlap as 2 years of exposure and yielded no significant change in 
the final results. Fuel exposure was treated as both a continuous and a 
categorical variable to obtain risk of death for each year of fuel burn-
ing and to assess mortality estimates as a result of increasing levels of 
fuel exposure, respectively.
Participants were followed up through the end of December 2012 
or until death. Annual phone calls were made to collect informa-
tion on outpatient procedures, illnesses, hospitalizations, and death. 
Inability to contact a study participant after 7 attempts over 2 weeks 
prompted investigators to contact friends or local health workers to 
help collect information on study participants. This method yielded 
successful follow-up of 99% of all study participants.21
Notification of participant death was followed up by a visit from a 
general practitioner to the home of the deceased to complete a validated 
verbal autopsy questionnaire through interview of relatives.22 Other 
ancillary information, including relevant medical documents detail-
ing laboratory, electrocardiographic, and radiographic tests, pathology 
reports, physician notes, and hospital discharge information, was col-
lected and reviewed by 2 independent internists to determine the cause 
of death. In the event of disagreement, a third experienced internist 
also reviewed all known information surrounding a participant’s death. 
All results were recorded in a computerized database according to 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes.
Statistical Analysis 
Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate unadjusted 
and adjusted 10-year hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortalities with relation 
to each specific fuel type. Given that participants used multiple fuels 
over their lifetimes, often concurrently, the models included life-
time exposure to all fuels. The final model therefore included all 
fuel types, as well as those covariates for which unadjusted 10-year 
HRs were significant and those which otherwise would be consid-
ered to affect all-cause and cause-specific mortality. These included 
age at enrollment; sex; urban or rural residence; Turkmen ethnicity; 
socioeconomic category (low, low-medium, medium-high, and high 
on the basis of the economic score detailed above); body mass index 
(≤17.9, 18.0–24.9, 25.0–29.9, and ≥30.0 kg/m2, implying under-
weight, normal, overweight, and obese, respectively); physical activ-
ity (irregular nonintense, regular nonintense, and irregular/regular 
intense); any history of tobacco, alcohol, and opium consumption; 
and personal history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and isch-
emic heart disease. Mediation and effect modification analyses were 
performed for many of these variables to better understand potential 
causes pathways, as well as populations most vulnerable to the effects 
of fuel exposure. Values of P≤0.05 were considered statistically sig-
nificant. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 
11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Of the 50 045 study participants, 28 824 were female (58%) 
and 21 221 were male (42%), with a mean age of 52.1 years 
at study enrollment. Most study participants were of Turkmen 
ancestry (74%) and lived in rural areas (80%). Whereas 86% 
of women had no formal education, 49% of men had no formal 
education. The population was fairly evenly distributed across 
all socioeconomic levels. More than half of the population was 
overweight or obese. History of smoking, opium consumption, 
and alcohol use was reported by 22%, 17%, and 3% of indi-
viduals, respectively. Self-reported prevalence of diabetes mel-
litus and ischemic heart disease was 7% and 6%, respectively. 
Hypertension was reported in 42% of the population.
Table 1 shows level of exposure to each fuel type in 
25-year increments across select baseline demographics and 
medical history. Although only 12% of participants burned 
pehen, 99% burned natural gas, 99% burned kerosene/die-
sel, and 90% burned wood. Exposure distributions are shown 
in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement, highlighting 
a greater amount of the population being exposed to natu-
ral gas and kerosene/diesel compared with wood and pehen. 
Generally, natural gas and kerosene/diesel users were of simi-
lar socioeconomic status, and exposure times were higher 
with increasing socioeconomic status. Among individuals 
with medium-high and high socioeconomic status, 59%, 57%, 
17%, and 2.4% had natural gas, kerosene/diesel, wood, and 
pehen burning exposure durations of ≥30 years, respectively. 
Pehen exposure was low overall but highest among Turkmen 
people.
As of December 2012, there were 3073 deaths for which 
complete demographic data were available; of these, 78% were 
attributable to noncommunicable cardiovascular, cancer, and 
respiratory diseases and showed little difference in incidence 
across socioeconomic strata (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Among deaths attributed to CVD (n=1578), 928 
(59%) were attributable to ischemic heart disease and 519 
(33%) were attributable to cerebrovascular accident, with the 
remaining 8% attributable to other forms of CVD, including 
sudden cardiac death, congestive heart failure, hypertension, 
chronic rheumatic heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and 
other cardiovascular system diseases not otherwise specified.
Cox proportional hazards models revealed an increased 
risk for all-cause mortality associated with kerosene/diesel use 
(10-year HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02–1.10) relative to other fuel 
uses in the multivariable-adjusted model. Natural gas burning, 
relative to other fuel uses, was associated with a lower risk for 
death (10-year HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–0.98; Table 2).

Regarding cardiovascular mortality, kerosene/diesel 
burning was associated with an increased risk of death (10-
year HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.06–1.17), whereas natural gas 
burning was associated with a reduced risk for death (10-
year HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99). Subtype-specific analy-
sis of cardiovascular-related deaths yielded similar mortality 
risks for ischemic heart disease mortality for kerosene/die-
sel use (10-year HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06–1.21), whereas the 
relative protective role for natural gas (10-year HR, 0.94; 
95% CI, 0.87–1.01) only trended toward significance. For 
death resulting from cerebrovascular accident, the HRs for 
kerosene/diesel burning and natural gas burning trended 
toward statistical significance (10-year HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 
0.99–1.17; and HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83–1.00, respectively). 
Pehen use and wood use were not statistically significantly 
associated with all-cause or subtype-specific mortality.
Sex-specific analyses yielded a potential signal for greater 
risk of kerosene/diesel burning on all-cause and total CVD 
mortality in women versus men (10-year HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 
1.03 to 1.15 versus HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99–1.09; and HR, 
1.14; 95% CI, 1.06–1.22 versus HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16, 
respectively; Table 2). Significant associations for ischemic 
heart disease mortality and kerosene/diesel burning were 
similar among men and women. The 10-year HR for stroke 
mortality as a result of kerosene/diesel burning, although 
not statistically significant, was higher for women than men. 
The benefits of gasoline burning, relative to other fuels, on 
all-cause and total CVD mortality were found only among 
women. Mediation and effect modification analyses for age 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement), obesity (Table 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement), diabetes mellitus 
(Table V in the online-only Data Supplement), hypertension 
(Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement), removal of 
comorbidity variables (Table VII in the online-only Data 
Supplement), physical activity level (Table VIII in the online-
only Data Supplement), smoking (Table IX in the online-only 
Data Supplement), opium consumption (Table X in the online-
only Data Supplement), and alcohol consumption (Table XI in 
the online-only Data Supplement) were also performed. There 
was no clear evidence for either mediation or effect modifica-
tion, but the number of mortality events was small for many of 
these analyses and therefore precluded a definitive conclusion. 
Further analysis including adjustment for cigarette pack-years 
in lieu of mere history of tobacco use revealed no significant 
difference from the base model (Table XII in the online-only 
Data Supplement) and no evidence for mediation or effect 
modification among men (Table XIII in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Incremental 10-year exposure to kerosene/diesel burning 
was associated with increasing all-cause, total CVD, ischemic 
heart disease, and stroke-related mortality (P for trend≤0.022 
for all; Figure). Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, includ-
ing hypertension, tobacco, and diabetes mellitus, were also 
associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mor-
tality (data not shown).
Discussion
In summary, we found an increased risk for all-cause and 
CVD mortality (driven largely by ischemic heart disease) 
with kerosene/diesel burning, whereas there was a decreased 
risk for all-cause and CVD mortality with natural gas burn-
ing relative to other household fuels used for cooking and 
heating. Similar trends were observed for death caused by 
stroke. There is a potential signal for greater risk of all-cause 
and CVD mortality resulting from kerosene/diesel burning 
among women versus men, possibly driven by excess stroke-
related mortality, that could reflect increased daily household 
fuel burning exposure times; however, this possible sex effect 
modification was not robust, and definitive conclusions cannot 
be made because the model was underpowered to detect such 
differences. Per 25-year period of kerosene/diesel burning, the

relative increases in all-cause (15%), total CVD (25%), and 
ischemic heart disease (30%) mortality are quite large.
Tobacco use and ambient air pollution are known risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular mortality. Increases in exposure to fine 
particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter 
from ambient air pollution and equivalent estimates of inhaled 
PM2.5 owing to cigarette smoking are associated with increas-
ing relative risk of cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary mor-
tality in adulthood.16 A consistent cardiovascular mortality 
benefit is observed among residents in relatively clean cities 
with less exposure to PM2.5 versus passive smokers and in light 
smokers versus heavy smokers.16 This is the first study to the 
best of our knowledge that prospectively shows a significant, 
multivariable-adjusted increased risk for all-cause, total CVD, 
and ischemic heart disease mortality from increasing lifetime 
exposures to HAP from kerosene/diesel burning. It bridges 
a gap in medical literature in that previous studies reporting 
such a link have largely relied on modeling.23,24
Kerosene and diesel are chemical mixtures produced from 
the distillation of crude oil. Various mechanisms may contrib-
ute to the association between kerosene/diesel burning and 
cardiovascular mortality. One animal model replicating HAP 
from kerosene burning implicated increased atherosclerosis on 
the basis of aortic plaque induction found on autopsy among 
guinea pigs exposed to high levels of kerosene exhaust versus 
saline aerosols.25 Additionally, Mills and colleagues26 reported 
acutely attenuated forearm blood flow among healthy individu-
als exposed to diesel exhaust despite concurrent administration 
of vasodilators, including acetylcholine, bradykinin, sodium 
nitroprusside, and verapamil, consistent with decreased vaso-
motor function leading to ischemia. Impaired endogenous 
fibrinolysis, resulting from decreased tissue plasminogen acti-
vator release, was also shown in this study and a follow-up 
study in men with a history of ischemic heart disease.26,27
The mechanisms relating HAP and CVD events 
may result from inhaled toxicants stimulating systemic 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and the autonomic nervous 
system, leading to increased leukocyte epigenetic changes, 
coagulation, thrombosis, and vasoconstriction.28,29 At a mini-
mum, increased PM2.5 exposures from cooking are associ-
ated with CVD risk factors, including increased systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures, carotid intima-media thickness, 
carotid atherosclerotic plaque, and reduced heart rate vari-
ability.7,12,30 Clean cook-stove interventions and air purifiers 
have led to a measured reduction in exposures to fine partic-
ulate matter with corresponding improvements in circulating 
inflammatory markers, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures, and the magnitude of ST-segment depression.8,9,31,32 
Because of our study design, we are unable to determine the 
exact mechanism by which diesel/kerosene was associated 
with cardiovascular mortality. It is possible that the repeated 
exposures could have led to recurrent acute ischemia, result-
ing in chronic, adverse changes to the vascular endothelium. 
It is also possible that the fuel exposure could have a trigger-
ing effect on events. Such mechanistic determination merits 
further investigation.
Overall, the study population had longer exposures to nat-
ural gas and kerosene/diesel burning than to wood and pehen 
burning. Compared with natural gas, kerosene/diesel burning 
and solid fuel burning are associated with higher indoor PM2.5 
and polyaromatic hydrocarbon concentrations,33–35 which 
could contribute to downstream adverse health consequences, 
including the observed increases in all-cause and CVD mor-
tality seen in the present study. Insufficient exposure times to 
solid fuel burning in the present study could explain the lack 
of an observed effect on mortality.
Further areas of investigation include assessing how time 
since last exposure to various fuel sources affects mortality. 
Additionally, an evaluation of ventilation methods attached 
to various stoves could be illuminating. These data can also 
be coupled to investigations using gravimetric PM2.5 mea-
surement to better estimate the daily and seasonal volume

of combustion-related HAP from various fuel sources and a 
competing-risk analysis given increasing comorbid illness as 
the population ages.
The main strengths of this study include the 99% suc-
cessful follow-up rate, the time for follow-up to track mor-
tality, and the systematic method used to track attributable 
causes of death. In addition, we were able to gather informa-
tion on lifetime exposure to various fuel sources for cook-
ing and heating. Although the data on fuel exposure were 
collected by recall, the detailed questionnaire allowed the 
investigators to account for overlap periods of fuel exposure 
from cooking and heating. Furthermore, mortality trends 
were robust when exposures were considered as continuous 
or categorical variables.
A major limitation of our study is the lack of quanti-
fiable exposures to particulate matter or hours spent per 
day exposed to fuel burning. Hence, years of exposure 
to various types of fuel burning was used as a surrogate 
for the likely amount of household particulate matter to 
which individuals in our study population were exposed 
over time. Information on seasonal variation in quanti-
fiable fuel exposure and adjustments for various house-
hold and stove ventilation methods is currently lacking. 
As a result, there is potential misclassification of expo-
sure to indoor air pollution given the use of recall to esti-
mate duration of exposures. Nonetheless, in the absence 
of quantifiable PM2.5 data, information on household fuel 
burning abstracted from survey data has previously been 
used to establish associations between HAP and childhood 
mortality,36–38 therefore supporting our methodology. Also 
noteworthy is that people of lower socioeconomic status 
are likely to use inexpensive higher polluting fuels and be 
subject to other external, modifiable factors that contribute 
to a higher rate of death. Hence, there is potential residual 
confounding by socioeconomic status, despite adjustment 
for several predefined socioeconomic indicators,20 and by 
various forms of household and stove ventilation meth-
ods. Other potential limitations include lack of informa-
tion on family history of heart disease and a referent group 
for fuel exposures. Although we were able to achieve a 
99% follow-up rate of all study participants and medical 
personal examined verbal autopsy questionnaires in addi-
tion to ancillary pathology information, there is a small 
possibility of misclassification of causes of death with 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision 
coding.
The global burden of HAP is substantial. The World 
Health Organization estimates that 3 billion people, mostly 
in low- and middle-income countries, cook and heat their 
homes using solid fuels with open fires and inefficient stoves. 
Despite efforts to transition to cleaner burning fuels such as 
natural gas or to electricity, as many as 500 million house-
holds worldwide still use kerosene for lighting purposes, 
whereas urbanization in low- and middle-income countries 
is accompanied by an increase in kerosene use as opposed to 
coal and biomass burning for cooking purposes.39 Given the 
effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, decreas-
ing HAP is an undeniably vital target for noncommunicable 
disease management.
These results support the stance that communities that 
transition away from high-pollution fuels to low-pollution 
fuels can experience a relative decrease in all-cause and CVD 
mortality. More studies should be conducted to replicate these 
findings. Furthermore, in combination with other results dem-
onstrating improvements in CVD risk profile with interven-
tions to reduce exposures to HAP, our results support the 
Figure. Cox proportional hazards 
models for increasing levels of kerosene/
diesel exposure. Hazard ratios are on 
a logarithmic scale for all-cause, total 
cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart 
disease, and cerebrovascular accident–
related mortality by increasing lifetime 
exposure to kerosene/diesel burning (P 
for trend≤0.022 for all). Reference groups 
include those with 0 years of exposure. 
Cox proportional hazards models were 
adjusted for age at enrollment, sex, rural 
living, socioeconomic status, education 
level, Turkmen ancestry, physical activity, 
body mass index, tobacco use, alcohol 
use, opiate use, self-reported diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart 
disease, and total lifetime use of other 
fuels.

to reduce exposure to HAP. Currently, the Global Alliance for 
Clean Cookstoves launched by the United Nations Foundation 
aims to help 100 million impoverished homes adopt clean and 
efficient stoves and fuels by 2020.3 Successful implementation 
will require the involvement of local governments, industry,

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Household air pollution ranks among the highest risk factors for global disease burden. In this study of 50 045 adults in the 
Golestan Cohort Study, we were able to demonstrate that increasing lifetime duration of kerosene and diesel fuel burning 
exposure is significantly associated with increased all-cause and total cardiovascular disease mortality. Subtype-specific 
analyses revealed significant associations with ischemic heart disease mortality with an adjusted 10-year hazard ratio of 1.14 
(95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.21). This is the first study to the best of our knowledge that prospectively finds a significant 
adjusted increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality as a result of household air pollution. It bridges a 
gap in medical literature between the impact of ambient air pollution and direct tobacco inhalation on cardiovascular death. 
To address the high burden of cardiovascular disease the world over, it is important for practitioners to identify and act on 
modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease mortality. More studies are needed to replicate these findings and to inves-
tigate transitioning communities to low-pollution fuels to improve all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.
