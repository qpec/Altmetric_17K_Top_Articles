Abstract
Background
Vision loss after optic neuropathy is considered irreversible. Here, repetitive transorbital
alternating current stimulation (rtACS) was applied in partially blind patients with the goal of
activating their residual vision.
Methods
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial
in an ambulatory setting with daily application of rtACS (n = 45) or sham-stimulation (n = 37)
for 50 min for a duration of 10 week days. A volunteer sample of patients with optic nerve
damage (mean age 59.1 yrs) was recruited. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was
super-threshold visual fields with 48 hrs after the last treatment day and at 2-months follow-
up. Secondary outcome measures were near-threshold visual fields, reaction time, visual
acuity, and resting-state EEGs to assess changes in brain physiology.
Results
The rtACS-treated group had a mean improvement in visual field of 24.0% which was signif-
icantly greater than after sham-stimulation (2.5%). This improvement persisted for at least 2
months in terms of both within- and between-group comparisons. Secondary analyses
revealed improvements of near-threshold visual fields in the central 5° and increased
thresholds in static perimetry after rtACS and improved reaction times, but visual acuity did
not change compared to shams. Visual field improvement induced by rtACS was associated
with EEG power-spectra and coherence alterations in visual cortical networks which are

Conclusion
rtACS treatment is a safe and effective means to partially restore vision after optic nerve
damage probably by modulating brain plasticity. This class 1 evidence suggests that visual
fields can be improved in a clinically meaningful way.

Introduction
Optic neuropathy and glaucoma are frequent causes of chronic blindness [1]. After a spontane-
ous recovery period, visual field (VF) loss is considered irreversible which compromises vision-
related quality of life (QoL) [2–4]. A systematic search for a means to improve such vision loss
is urgently needed.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (ACS)
of the brain are new methods to modify brain excitability and synchronicity in healthy subjects
and patients with brain injuries affecting different modalities such as the motor [5], language
[6], or somatosensory domains [7]. In the visual system, exploratory evidence indicates that
ACS can enhance neuronal function both in normal subjects [8–9] and in patients with VF loss
who still have some residual vision [10]. The proposed mechanism of action is neuromodula-
tion of oscillatory brain activity towards a more synchronized EEG via entrainment of specific
stimulation frequencies [10–11], and the reorganization of brain functional connectivity net-
works [12] is considered to be a novel and promising avenue for visual rehabilitation [13].
In a small sample study, ACS was delivered in frequencies ranging from theta to high beta
via electrodes placed near the eye to re-activate residual vision in optic neuropathy [14]. Here,
10 daily rtACS sessions increased light detection performance and improved patient-reported
vision-related QoL which was moderately correlated with VF gains [15]. These improvements
were associated with increased alpha-power at occipital sites in resting-EEGs [14,16] and
increased neuronal synchronization of functional connectivities between the occipital and
frontal regions [12]. Yet, the level of clinical evidence is still not definitive because the trials
included only small patient samples [12,14–16]. We hypothesized that efficacy and safety
could be documented in a larger sample prospective trial.
We now report the first confirmatory, large-sample, double blind, randomized, multi-center
clinical trial to establish the efficacy and safety of rtACS stimulation in patients with vision
impairments caused by optic nerve damage.

 The study design was prospective and double blind; neither the patients nor the diagnostic
examiners were aware to which treatment arm the patient belonged. For allocation conceal-
ment, patients of the sham-group received minimal dose stimulation. The investigator admin-
istering the treatment was aware of the group identity but was instructed not to reveal to the
patients which treatment they received. Patients were informed to which group they belonged
only after the FOLLOW-UP tests, and all sham-stimulation patients were offered rtACS.
Informed written consent was obtained prior to randomization. Study participants received a
compensation for study participation. The ethics committees of the participating study centers
in Magdeburg, Berlin, and Goettingen approved the study, and a statistical analysis plan was
filed with the lead ethics committee. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01280877). The trial was registered in Janu-
ary 2011 upon receiving approval from the leading ethics committee in December 2010. The
date range for patient recruitment and follow-up was from December 2010 until February
2012. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are
registered.
Study sample description
Patients who suffered visual field loss caused by glaucoma (n = 33) or AION (n = 32) were ran-
domized. The following etiologies of optic atrophy were also included: post-acute inflamma-
tion (n = 12), optic nerve compression (n = 5, of which 4 were tumor-induced and 1
intracranial hemorrhage), congenital or unknown etiology of optic atrophy (n = 5), and Leber's
hereditary optic neuropathy (n = 3). Eight patients had two concomitant diagnoses of optic
nerve atrophy. The sample sizes at each study center were as follows: Charité Berlin (n = 33),
Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg (n = 31), and Department of Ophthalmology,
Georg-August University of Goettingen/ Eye Clinic Kassel (n = 18). Table 1 summarizes the
demographics and lesion variables. With respect to BASELINE variables, results did not signifi-
cantly differ between the rtACS- and the sham-group (Table 2).
Sample size and randomization
The sample size calculation was based on results of two earlier pilot studies at the Institute of
Medical Psychology (University of Magdeburg) considering similar patients and equivalent
stimulation schemes, i.e., rtACS- and sham-groups as in the present trial. In the first trial a
mean percentage increase (± standard deviation) of 65.61 ± 104.35 was observed in the rtACS-
group (n = 19) and 16.93 ± 31.22 in the sham-group (n = 14). The corresponding results of the
subsequent trial were 30.68 ± 41.97 in the stimulation group (n = 12) and 9.57 ± 12.05 (n = 13)
for the sham group. Using these means and standard deviations in a sample size calculation
(α = 0.05, two-sided, power 1 – β = 0.80) for a two-sample t-test (Satterthwaite version) with
nQuery Advisor 7.0 resulted in 41 patients per group for the first trial and 36 patients per
group for the second trial. Therefore, we adopted a conservative approach of considering up to
10 percent drop-out and planned to recruit 45 patients per group. Patients were assigned to
either the rtACS- or the sham-group by “Randomization In Treatment Arms” software (RITA,
conditions that were unrelated to study participation. Three treated cases of legally blind subjects were
excluded from subsequent analyses due to violation of inclusion criterion (no residual vision). (B) Study
design with diagnostic and treatment visits. Randomization was done after BASELINE assessment. Stability
of VF defects was ascertained by comparing VFs at BASELINE with those obtained during the screening visit
2 weeks earlier. Upon completion of the 10-day treatment, all initial diagnostic tests were repeated (POST).
The FOLLOW-UP diagnostic assessment was conducted after a therapy-free interval of at least 2 months.

 StatSol, Lübeck) with stratified block randomization considering the study center and the VF
defect depth at BASELINE as potential prognostic factors. High vs. low defect depth was
defined as stimulus detection rates below vs. above 30% inside the VF defect.
Randomization resulted in comparable average baseline situation and demographics in the
rtACS- and sham-group. Only the percentage of males vs. females was unequally distributed
but this was independent of study results.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The following criteria were established prospectively. Inclusion criteria included: (i) stable VF
defect with residual vision as detected by super-threshold perimetry testing (HRP, cut-off 1.5%
in at least one eye); (ii) lesion age >6 months; (iii) patient age >18 yrs; (iv) compliance with
the experimenters’ instructions during diagnostic testing; and (v) sufficient fixation ability.
Exclusion criteria included: electric or electronic implants (such as cardiac pacemaker); any
metal artifacts in the head or truncus area (with the exception of dental implants); epilepsy and
photo-sensibility; acute auto-immune diseases; psychiatric diagnoses; diabetic retinopathy or
other documented retinal impairments; high blood pressure (>160/100 mmHg); acute con-
junctivitis; retinitis pigmentosa; pathological nystagmus; an unstable or high level of intraocu-
lar pressure (> 27 mm Hg); and presence of an un-operated tumor or cancer recurrence
anywhere in the body.
Statistical analyses and study endpoints
Primary data analysis was conducted independently by the biometry department of two of the
coauthors (A.L., S.K.) and included sample size calculation, statistical analysis plan, initializa-
tion of randomization and data source verification. Primary and secondary endpoints were
defined prospectively.
VF mapping was conducted using a campimetric, high-resolution, super-threshold visual
detection test (HRP) [17], a method that reveals areas of residual vision in the central VF with

 lower inter-test-variability than standard static perimetry due to target luminance above
threshold. In a darkened room, the patient was viewing a 17" monitor from a chin-head-rest at
a distance of 42 cm. White target stimuli were presented at random in a grid of 25x19 stimulus
locations and the task was to hit the space bar. The procedure included a fixation control using
isoluminant color changes of the fixation point. Eyes with intact vision or complete blindness
were not considered. The primary endpoint was “percent change over BASELINE” in the HRP
detection rate.
Secondary endpoints of HRP were percentage change of the stimulus detection rate in the
defective VF (excluding intact areas), the central 5°-VF, and average reaction time in total HRP
VF. Further secondary endpoints were static and kinetic perimetry results (foveal and mean
threshold of 30°-VFs, mean eccentricity/VF size), best corrected near and far visual acuity
(Landolt), and patient-reported outcome, i.e., an intervention-related questionnaire with a
structured response format and a vision-related QoL questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-39) [18] to eval-
uate subjective improvements of “visual field defect and related impairments” (15 items) and
“general health and mental distress” (four items) at POST and FOLLOW-UP. Concerning
static perimetry foveal threshold and mean threshold of 30°-VFs were obtained. A fast

Results are given as medians and interquartile ranges. The groups did not differ significantly in any of the
BASELINE measures (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U tests, two-sided).
1 To balance the groups for randomization with respect to defect depth, the BASELINE VF defect was
classified as having a high or low defect depth with a threshold of 30% detection accuracy in the defective
VF. Based on this classification, 55 patients (67.1%) belonged to the high and 27 (32.9%) to the low defect
depth group. Between-group differences of the BASELINE diagnostic values were not statistically
significant in any measure (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided).
2 Visual acuity was calculated for all patients with better visual acuity than counting fingers (logMAR = 3).
Therefore, five subjects had to be excluded from the recording of near vision and 13 subjects from far
vision acuity.

 threshold strategy was used to determine threshold values at 66 positions within the 30° visual
field. Target stimuli (size: III/4mm2, white, luminance: 318 cd/m2/ 0db, duration: 0.2 sec) were
presented on a background with constant luminance of 10cd/m2. Mean threshold refers to the
average dB values of 66 test positions. In kinetic perimetry the VF border was determined for
24 meridians (spaced by 15°) in randomized order at a constant luminance threshold of III/4e
(0dB) and a velocity of 2° per sec. Mean eccentricity refers to the average of 24 meridians.
Mean visual field size refers to the area inside the VF border in kinetic perimetry, i.e., the sum
of 24 triangles (X axis eccentricity multiplied by Y axis eccentricity /2).
The percent change over BASELINE was determined at 48 hrs (minimum interval) after
the last stimulation day (i.e., the 10th stimulation session) (POST) and at 2 months FOL-
LOW-UP (FU) for each endpoint as 100�(POST resp. FOLLOW-UP–BASELINE) / BASE-
LINE. HRP reaction time (absolute differences), visual acuity (logarithmic values) and
questionnaire data were shown as absolute values. For binocular defects the value of both
eyes was averaged. Since there were no center effects (neither as the main factor nor as an
interaction with the treatment arm), nor dependencies of BASELINE results for the primary
endpoint, the primary data analysis and secondary between-group comparisons were per-
formed for the pre-defined hypothesis with a one-sided U-test (p-value<0.05). The Hodges-
Lehmann effect estimator and 95%-confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Within-group
comparisons were calculated with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank-tests. Analyses were
done in MatlabR2011b and SPSS 21.
EEG power spectra after rtACS
All subjects were seated in a dimly lit room and instructed to keep their eyes closed during the
whole recording session. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded for 2 min before and
after each stimulation session using 16 electrodes (10–20 system) with impedances <10kΩ
with eyes closed (at rest) in a darkened room. The EEG-signal at occipital (O1, O2) areas of
interest (AOIs) was referenced against the grand-average and preprocessed with ASA™- soft-
ware (ANT, Enschede, Netherlands) including a bandpass-filter (0.5–40Hz, filter-slope 24dB/
oct.), 2 sec bins, and baseline correction. Power-spectra at occipital sites O1 and O2 were
assessed with Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to determine bandwidth specific power
(μV2) with automatic artifact-rejection (min/max allowed amplitude: ±75.00μV), normalized
power-spectra and DC-correction during FFT-averaging. Resting state eyes-closed EEG imme-
diately before and after one day of treatment was analyzed after the first rtACS session. The
EEG data were analyzed in 3 steps. First, we defined 5 spectral bands: delta, 1–3 Hz; theta, 3–7
Hz; alpha (alpha I), 7–14 Hz; and beta, 14–30 Hz. Between-group comparisons were conducted
with independent samples t test. The effects of rtACS or sham-stimulation on EEG measures
were analyzed as ΔEEG = EEGpost−EEGpre. To assess functional interactions between brain
regions coherence was analyzed indicating coupling between two signals as a function of fre-
quency [19]. Coherence was calculated for each pair of channels ij and defined as follows:
Cij f
ð Þ ¼
jSijðf Þj
2
Siiðf Þ Sjjðf Þ
In this equation S denotes the spectrum of signals from two EEG channels i and j, for a
given frequency bin f.
Changes in spectral power of oscillatory brain activity and strength of functional connectiv-
ity over the visual cortex after the first stimulation session were then related to the primary out-
come measure. To assess the relationship between EEG and primary outcome measures,
Spearman correlation coefficient was used.

 Repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation
After BASELINE assessments patients were stimulated with either rtACS or sham-stimulation
on 2 × 5 weekdays for 25 min at day1 to 50 min at day10 with eyes closed. Four 10mm Grass
gold electrodes (SAFELEAD™, Astro-Med, Inc, USA), 2 for each eye, were placed on the skin
near the orbital cavity (“transorbital”), and biphasic square-pulses were applied in bursts
(Alpha SYNC stimulator, EBS Germany). The return electrode (stainless steel plate, 32x30
mm) was positioned on the right arm. Stimulation current strength was 125% of phosphene
threshold recorded during 5 Hz stimulation. rtACS was conducted with frequencies between
8–25 Hz. To conceal group identity, sham-patients received only one ACS burst per minute
(“minimal” stimulation) to create phosphene experiences.
Safety
Possible side effects were evaluated by a semi-structured daily interview that included queries
on mild headache, discomfort, and vertigo as expected minor adverse events. Patients were also
asked at the end of each daily stimulation session and at POST and FOLLOW-UP to report
any adverse effects, such as uncommon or uncomfortable sensations.
Simulating alternating current flow
For assessing current flow properties of rtACS, a single computer simulation was performed to
mimic stimulation using an electrode placed over the right eye and return electrode at the neck
region of the subject. Although four electrodes were used for treatment, they were only used
one at a time. Therefore, the current flow simulation was done only with one electrode, repre-
senting all other electrodes. A finite element model was developed using multi-modal imaging
data (MRI/CT) of a 40-yrs-old male. Isotropic conductivities were assigned to head tissues
such as scalp, cerebrospinal fluid, gray and white matter (0.43, 1.79, 0.33, 0.142; [20]), air pock-
ets (1e-6 S/m), skull (0.01 S/m [21–22], and eye tissue (0.6, 1.05, 0.4 S/m for sclera, intraocular
and nerve tissue [23]. One circular electrode (height/diameter: 3/10 mm, conductivity: 1.5 S/
m) was placed above the subject's right eyebrow and a return electrode was modeled as the last
axial slice of the neck region (SCIRun software, current injection: +/-0.5 mA [21]. The simula-
tion represents a quasi-static solution of the Maxwell equations and serves as an approximation
for current density estimation of one time sample during rtACS when the cathode and anode
reaches its maximal current intensity value.
Results
Safety
None of the participants reported discomfort during the stimulation. One serious adverse
event with subsequent hospitalization occurred, but it was unrelated to rtACS. Transient ver-
tigo was reported by two rtACS-subjects in a total of five sessions and one sham-subject experi-
enced persistent vertigo for 0.5 hrs after each session. Temporary dizziness was reported once
after a single rtACS-session. Mild headache during a single stimulation session was reported
once by an rtACS-subject and once by a sham-subject. Further reports were mild headaches
immediately after a stimulation session by four rtACS- and two sham-subjects and cutaneous
sensations in eight sham- and 12 rtACS-subjects. Back pain and stiff neck were reported by
one rtACS-subject on the first four stimulation days. This subject dropped out of the study.
Concerning autonomic activity, we did not observe meaningful changes induced by rtACS
(pre-session rtACS values: systolic pressure 131.54±1.94mmHG, diastolic pressure
82.81 ± 1.72 mmHg, heart rate 72.82 ± 1.02, post-session rtACS values: systolic pressure

 129.19 ± 2.94 mmHg, diastolic pressure 82.20 ± 1.24 mmHg, heart rate 70.69 ± 0.99; means
and SEM).
Primary outcome measure
Concerning the primary outcome, percent change over baseline in detection rates in VF tests,
rtACS-treated patients showed significantly greater improvements than sham-treated patients
(p = 0.011, Mann-Whitney U, Fig 2A). Due to the higher number of responders in the rtACS-
group the mean improvement of VFs at POST was 24.0% detection accuracy after rtACS vs
2.5% after sham-treatment. The corresponding effect estimator of the median difference
(BASELINE vs. POST) between treatment arms was 5.0%, CI[0.6;10.0]. While the rtACS-
group exhibited significant improvements in BASELINE vs. POST comparisons of medians
(Hodges-Lehmann-estimator 6.4%, CI[2.9;11.6], p<0.001 (Wilcoxon signed rank test, one-
sided), the sham-group did not (1.1%, CI[-2.0;4.3]). Fig 2B depicts HRP visual charts of two
patients with the greatest improvements in the primary outcome measure in both groups. Reli-
ability parameters of HRP and eye-tracking documented excellent retinotopic reliability of the
primary outcome measure, validating that improved visual detection could not be explained by
altered eye movements (S2 Fig).
Secondary outcome measures
Table 3 summarizes the results of the trial. The median between-group difference in percentage
detection rate change in the defective VF did not reach statistical significance, (8.2% CI
[-5.9%;22.5%, p = 0.131) because this parameter significantly increased in both groups; by
41.3% (CI[31.5; 54.3]) in the rtACS- and 33.2% (CI[23.4; 44.2]) in the sham-group (both
p<0.001). Reaction time changes in HRP improved in the rtACS-group (median) by 8ms, (CI
[-16;0], p = 0.023), with a trend in the sham-group of 4ms (CI[-15;2], p = 0.069); the between-
group difference was not significant (p = 0.35). Other secondary outcome measures obtained at
POST did not reveal significant between-group differences. For example, visual acuity did not
change significantly (Table 3).
After 10 days rtACS, the mean threshold in static perimetry (median change 9.3%; CI
[2.6;20.3], p = 0.003) significantly increased while after sham-stimulation no significant change
in threshold in static perimetry was noted (median change 1.9%; CI [-4.8%, 8.8%]). Concerning
mean VF size obtained in kinetic perimetry, a clinically negligible but still significant increase
was observed in both groups (median change after rtACS 4.3% [-0.3%, 11.9%]; p = 0.036, and
after sham-stimulation 4.8% [-1.5%, 16.1%], p = 0.040).
Additionally, at BASELINE, POST and FOLLOW-UP, patients completed a neuropsycho-
logical test battery that included an alertness reaction time test, and a trail-making paper-pen-
cil-test. Performance in these tests remained largely unchanged in both groups. However, a
significant increase in reaction time in the alertness test was observed in the rtACS- but not in
the sham-group (S1 Table). Improvements in the performance of the Trail Making Test were
observed in both groups.
Outcome assessment at 2-months Follow-Up and outcome prediction
The differences between FOLLOW-UP and BASELINE are somewhat smaller than the differ-
ences between POST and BASELINE with a persistent significant effect in the primary measure
detection accuracy in HRP in terms of both within- and between-group comparisons, indicat-
ing the stability of the gains (Fig 2A). Interestingly, at FOLLOW-UP static perimetry thresh-
olds increased beyond POST-levels in the rtACS-group and reached levels significantly higher
than at BASELINE (median change 11.7%; CI[3.7;29.5]; p = 0.001) which was not observed in

 the sham-group. The 10.2% between-group difference at FOLLOW-UP was significant at
p = 0.01 (CI[1.4%;22.8]). VF improvement as measured by kinetic perimetry did not persist
after 2 months in both groups. A treatment outcome prediction model was used to predict the
change in HRP visual fields based on BASELINE results [24] (S2 Fig).
Patient-reported outcomes
In subjects with binocular vision impairment, NEI-VFQ measures of vision-related QoL indi-
cated improved ratings of NEI-VFQ scales “VF defect and related impairments” after rtACS as
well as improved ratings of “general health and mental distress” after sham. In the interven-
tion-related questionnaire, the items “treatment was helpful”, “increased vision after treat-
ment” at POST, and “satisfied with treatment”, “general perception” at FOLLOW-UP were
more frequently answered positively after rtACS than after sham (S3 Fig).
EEG power-spectra and functional connectivity changes
Group comparisons of the EEG-spectrum confirm that alpha- and beta but not theta power
increases were significantly greater after 10 days rtACS (median change: 0.037) than after
sham-stimulation (median change: 0.015), F(1,1529.605) = 6.894, p = 0.009. Unspecific power
increases after 10 days sham-stimulation were only found in the theta power-band, which may
reflect fatigue during the course of the experiment.
After the first rtACS session, an increase of spectral power was observed in theta, alpha and
beta frequency bands in both the occipital and frontal regions. The occipital coherence change
after the first stimulation session was significantly correlated with final treatment outcome
(Fig 2C).
Current flow simulation
Computer simulations of current flow in the intact brain suggest that a considerable amount of
current enters the skull through the eye and optic nerve (Fig 3A), affecting brain regions close
to the eye socket. Fig 3B indicates that some amount of current appears to be shunted directly
through the skull into the frontal cortex as seen by current density concentrations (of approxi-
mately similar magnitude) just behind the electrode. Inside the skull, highest current densities
were observed in high conductive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inferior to the brain stem (Fig 3C),
which indicates that most of the current flows along the shortest path of lowest resistance at
the skull base within CSF liquor. A major proportion of the current appears to leave the skull
through the foramen magnum and down the spinal cord into the ground. There was also an
increased current density magnitude at the lower cerebellum and lower brain stem (Fig 3B and
3C). In Fig 3C (left), higher current densities are also present in skin tissue close to the elec-
trode and lower current densities at lower conducting materials such as skull tissue, internal air
matched-pairs signed rank tests. The respective p-values are reported with p<0.05 considered as significant. (B) Individual
change in HRP VF charts at BASELINE and POST in the two best responding patients of both groups. By superimposing HRP
computer campimetric VF charts of three repeated measurements, VF areas were categorized as intact (perfect stimulus
detection at a given location, white spots), partially damaged/relative defect (inconsistent stimulus detection, grey spots), and
absolutely impaired areas (no stimulus detected, black spots). Detection increases and decreases after intervention are shown
in blue and red, respectively. The percentage improvement of the detection accuracy was comparable between the whole HRP
VF 16x21.5° and the central 5° VF. (C) Power spectra before and after the first stimulation session. Left sub-figure: One session
of tACS increased power of theta (Z = 3.583, p<0.001), alpha (t = 4.571, p<0.001) and beta bands (Z = 3.142, p = 0.002)
recorded from electrode positions above the visual cortex. Middle sub-figure: After sham stimulation a significant power
increase was observed for only the theta band (Z = 3.147, p = 0.002). Right sub-figure: Scatter plot showing the relation
between change in alpha band coherence at the occipital area of interest and change in detection accuracy in total visual field

 cavities, and tissues remotely located from current injection sites. Smaller current density mag-
nitudes are present in gray matter and white matter tissues of the brain (Fig 3C (right)) peaking
in the frontal and lower cerebral regions. The thalamus and visual cortex show only low current
densities compared to other sites presumably because they are further away from the shortest
path between electrodes.

tion documents the efficacy and safety of rtACS-treatment in patients with vision loss after

 stimulation with non-invasive rtACS significantly improved detection performance in VFs
with persistent effects for at least 2 months beyond the stimulation period as shown by static
perimetry. Kinetic perimetry appeared to be insensitive to visual field dynamics. VF improve-
ment in static measures was associated with increased vision-related QoL and subjective visual
functioning in patients with binocular vision impairment. However, in contrast to what was
seen in a previous study [14], the “objective” improvement of VFs did not correlate signifi-
cantly with “subjective” measures, i.e., there was a mismatch between both levels of analysis
which can be attributed to the fact that only a small proportion of subjective vision can actually
be explained by “objective” VF results as previously discussed [10]. About 2 of 3 patients
treated with rtACS reported being satisfied with the treatment even though only 1 of 3 patients
was aware of vision improvements.
We performed computer simulation to estimate the amount of current that was being deliv-
ered to components of the visual system in a 40-yrs old male control subject. Computer simula-
tions of rtACS current flow and estimated current density levels revealed that the stimulation
current propagates through the eyeball and optic nerve to subcortical and midbrain regions
with secondary stimulation at the brain stem and in cerebellar regions. Although the simula-
tion model does not consider the extent of optic nerve damage the results provide meaningful
insights indicating that most of the current affect frontal parts of the brain including eyeball
and optic nerve while only low levels were found in the visual cortex. This finding is compatible
with the hypothesis that cortical EEG changes after rtACS are due to “physiological” synchro-
nous activation of retinal ganglion cells following eye and optic nerve stimulation [25]. For
future studies in this area current flow simulations may help to target both safety consider-
ations and improved stimulation paradigms.
Fig 3. Visualization of simulated electrical fields during rtACS: current density maxima on eye/optical nerve
(A), brain tissue surface (B) and in the volume (C). Although four electrodes were used for treatment, they
were used only one at a time. Therefore, the current flow simulation was done with only one electrode,
representing all other electrodes. (A) Current density maxima of about 0.0044 A/m2 can be observed on the
upper part of the outer eye surface that is closest to the stimulating electrode. Furthermore, the optical nerve
of the stimulated eye also receives parts of the stimulating current density magnitude as currents enter the
inner skull. (B) Local current density maxima can be found at frontal brain regions spatially located close to
the stimulating anodal electrode. (C) Another area of locally increased current density can be found at the
brain stem and lower cerebellum.

 Our findings of improved visual functions are consistent with the hypothesis that rtACS can
modulate perceptual thresholds in “areas of residual vision” as previously reported in studies
that also used current stimulation [12, 14–16] or behavioral vision training methods [10, 17,
26–28]. The improvement of visual functioning together with spectral power and connectivity
changes in the occipital EEG alpha band [12] are consistent with the hypothesis of a retinofugal
entrainment by rtACS that improves visual perception through rhythmic firing of retinal gan-
glion cells. Indeed, in the present study we cannot exclude that some of the effects on coherence
are due to volume conduction effect. Future studies might use high-density EEG, which would
allow using source reconstruction algorithms (e.g. LORETA). Such algorithms typically reduce
the volume conduction problem and thus allow a more spatially precise localization of neuro-
physiological effects and more reliable estimation of functional coupling. As recently shown by
patients with optic nerve damage who suffer from desynchronization of spatial and temporal
processing deficits of their brain functional networks [12, 29] the therapeutic effects of rtACS
may be mediated by re-synchronizing the brain networks, which were desynchronized by the
vision loss. Because well-synchronized dynamic brain networks are critical for cognitive pro-
cessing of visual information [30], we conclude that a visually deprived brain with re-synchro-
nized functional networks can process reduced visual input more efficiently thereby activating
or amplifying, residual vision even many years after the damage has occurred [10].
According to the prevailing view, tACS entrainment leads to a frequency-specific phase
realignment of the endogenous oscillations with the applied alternating current with a subse-
quent frequency-specific power enhancement [31–35]. The beneficial functional consequence
of rtACS for visual perception may possibly be explained by retinofugal entrainment and brain
functional connectivity modulation [12, 16]. Another issue of interest is the specificity of the
range of current frequencies used for stimulation. In future studies it will be important to sys-
tematically study the effects of specific frequencies for parameter optimization [36]. Applica-
tion of the optimal frequencies might improve efficacy and will also shed light on the role of
specific brain oscillations in their ability to activate residual vision.
It may be argued that visual improvements after rtACS can be explained by perceptual learn-
ing due to repeated testing. However, this is unlikely because we ascertained stable visual field
baselines before starting the treatment and the primary and secondary outcome criteria did not
improve to the same extent in the sham-group which was exposed to the same number of diag-
nostic test repetitions. Since we observed a decrease in RT when ACS treated patients responded
to small light stimuli presented during visual field testing, another alternative explanation for
improved vision outcome is a secondary effect of an increase in attention in the treatment group
due to rtACS which then results in general performance improvements in vision tests as well.
However, this interpretation is not supported by results of a basic alertness test. Here, we
observed a general RT increase in response to large centrally presented stimuli as used during the
alertness test (S1 Table). In other words, despite lower overall alertness, visual processing to
(smaller) visual stimuli was faster. Our interpretation is that visual processing following ACS
treatment may be more efficient, but the precise relationship between general alertness and
modality-specific (visual) attention in patients with visual field defects requires further study.
An important question in brain stimulation studies is what constitutes an appropriate sham-
condition. In prior rtACS-studies, the sham-condition was an auditory sound that mimicked cur-
rent delivery [14–15]. Below phosphene-threshold stimulation was employed by others [37].
Both of these sham conditions cannot completely rule out that patients correctly guessed to
which group they belonged (because of lack of phosphene experience in shams), leaving open the
possibility of an expectation bias. Our sham-condition avoided this bias by using a “minimal
dose” sham-condition where phosphene perceptions also occurred. However, the draw-back of
this kind of sham procedure is that a “minimal dose” may actually have some, albeit small,
Alternating Current Stimulation for Vision Restoration

 therapeutic effects that cannot be separated from possible placebo effects of the current study
design. Indeed, the sham group significantly improved in some parameters as well. The reason
we selected a “minimal dose” treatment for sham controls is that this equalizes the expectations
in both groups. Indeed, one would not expect that patients generate a hypothesis on their own
that fewer phosphenes were less effective. However, considering that phosphenes may contribute
to a placebo effect, it cannot be ruled out that patients in the rtACS-group who experienced more
significant visual phenomena during stimulation might have had a greater feeling of that a pow-
erful treatment was occurring than those who only experienced a flash once a minute.
Several open questions should be addressed in future studies. Important issues are whether
non-invasive current stimulation-induced visual system changes are due to neuroplastic alter-
ation, if they can be potentiated by vision training [38], and if rtACS can also improve vision in
patients with post-chiasmatic lesions [39]. In addition, for general diagnostics low contrast
visual acuity as a sensitive outcome measure and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measure-
ments to better define study inclusion criteria should be considered to explore altered axonal
and neuronal integrity in the afferent visual pathway. While additional studies are needed to
further explore the mechanisms of action, our results warrant the use of rtACS treatment in a
clinical setting to activate residual vision by brain network re-synchronization, which can par-
tially restore vision in patients with stable vision loss caused by nervous system damage.
Appendix
Reliability of visual field measurements
Reliability parameters of the primary outcome measure.
The absolute change of HRP
fixation accuracy and percentage of responses outside the valid response window in HRP were
considered as reliability parameters. Fixation accuracy improved significantly at POST in both
groups (median increase, rtACS: 1.1%, CI[0.1; 2.5], p = 0.017; sham: 1.3%, CI[0.0; 2.6],
p = 0.023), with no significant difference between groups. The percentage of reactions outside
the valid response window (150–1000ms) after stimulus presentation in HRP increased slightly
after rtACS (0.3%, CI[0.0; 0.9], p = 0.016) and remained unchanged after sham (-0.03%, CI
[-0.5; 0.2], 0.377) with a significant difference between groups (p = 0.033).
Eye-tracking during HRP.
To determine whether changes of visual field results are
related to, or could be explained by, altered fixation behavior during visual field testing, HRP
visual fields were measured while eye movements were recorded with an eye-tracker (Tobii
ET1750, Tobii Technology AB, Sweden) in one study center (Magdeburg). Together with reli-
ability parameters of HRP, the eye-tracking results documented excellent retinotopic reliability
of the primary outcome measure, validating that improved visual detection could not be
explained by altered eye movements (such as saccades towards the blind field). Mean fixation
was within the central area of 1° horizontally and 0.5° vertically for both groups at all time
points (S1 Fig). Standard deviation of the mean fixation position extended up to approx. 1.5–2°
of visual angle both horizontally and vertically, which is in the expected range [17]. In fact, per-
formance change in HRP correlated negatively with changes in deviations from fixation during
eye-tracked HRPs, i.e. the better the fixation, the greater the detection accuracy improvements.
For both the rtACS- and sham-group significant correlations were observed between fixation
performance and detection accuracy change in the whole-tested HRP visual field (r = -0.47,
p<0.05), and in the defective visual field as well (r = -0.51, p<0.05).
Treatment outcome prediction model
In order to analyze which areas of the visual field respond with improvements after rtACS, we
separately analyzed different visual field states based on HRP measurements and developed a
Alternating Current Stimulation for Vision Restoration

June 29, 2016
15 / 19
 treatment outcome prediction model to predict from the BASELINE results of HRP visual
fields the extent of vision restoration [24]. To this end, different visual field states (i.e. full func-
tion, partial function and absolute vision loss) were determined by superimposing repeated
HRP measures to determine which visual field regions are intact, partially damaged (residual I
and residual II) and absolutely impaired (absolute defect).
The difference between groups in the primary outcome measure was found to be maily
caused by a reduction of the absolute (black) scotoma region in the rtACS-group. The size of
the absolute defect significantly decreased after rtACS when compared to sham-treated
patients (χ² = 190.201, df = 1, p<0.0001) (S2 Fig). Post-intervention changes in the intact and
residual visual field did not differ between groups.
Out of a total of 12 features deemed relevant based on previous studies [24], two features of
HRP visual fields at baseline were associated with visual field improvements after rtACS:
greater “neighborhood activity”, i.e., the mean detection rate of all HRP test positions within a
5° radius around each detected location, and greater “residual function”, i.e. the detection rate
at a given visual field position (S3 Fig). This suggests that improvements of residual vision are
the key factor of vision restoration.
Patient reported outcomes
Subjective change was evaluated with the NEI-VFQ scales “visual field defect and related
impairments” and “general health and mental distress” at POST and FOLLOW-UP and com-
pared between groups. At POST there was an improvement in NEI-VFQ scale “general health
and mental distress” in the sham-group (p<0.01) but not after rtACS, with no significant dif-
ference between groups (p = 0.81). At FOLLOW-UP both groups reported subjective benefits
in the NEI-VFQ scales “visual field defect and related impairments” (rtACS: p<0.01, sham:
p = 0.02) and “general health and mental distress” (rtACS: p = 0.04; sham: p = 0.01), again with
no significant difference between groups (p = 0.77).
Due to the possibility that patients with monocular impairment may not experience a severe
reduction in vision-related QoL, an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with binocular
loss, i.e., excluding those with an intact fellow eye, was conducted. Here, rtACS-patients
reported a significant increase in NEI-VFQ “visual field defect and related impairments” scale
(p<0.01) at FOLLOW-UP with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.40). In the
sham-group there was a significant increase in the NEI-VFQ “general health and mental dis-
tress” scale (p = 0.01) at POST with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.30).
In another intervention-related questionnaire, the items: “treatment was helpful”,
“increased vision after treatment” at POST, and “satisfied with treatment”, “general percep-
tion” at FOLLOW-UP were more frequently answered positively after rtACS than after sham
(S4 Fig).
