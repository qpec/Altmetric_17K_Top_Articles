ABSTRACT
The Executive Committee of the International Ankle
Consortium presents this 2016 position paper with
recommendations for information implementation and
continued research based on the paradigm that lateral
ankle sprain (LAS), and the development of chronic
ankle instability (CAI), serve as a conduit to a significant
global healthcare burden. We intend our recommendations
to serve as a mechanism to promote efforts to improve
prevention and early management of LAS. We believe
this will reduce the prevalence of CAI and associated
sequelae that have led to the broader public health
burdens of decreased physical activity and early onset
ankle joint post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Ultimately, this
can contribute to healthier lifestyles and promotion of
physical activity.
INTRODUCTION
Lateral ankle sprain is the most common musculo-
skeletal disorder documented in physically active
populations.1–5 An acute lateral ankle sprain causes
pain and typically results in a temporary period of
reduced functioning and disability.6 Early manage-
ment and follow-up treatment can modulate the
healing process and speed up return to desired
activities.7 Despite this fact, many patients receive
neither supervised nor professionally administered
care.8 This suggests that, as an isolated injury occur-
rence, lateral ankle sprain is often considered an
innocuous injury that will heal expediently and
with minimal treatment. Unfortunately, the major-
ity of patients with a history of lateral ankle sprain
will sustain at least one additional sprain,1
9–11
with many developing physical and subjective func-
tional limitations, with ongoing ‘giving-way’ in the
affected ankle,6 resulting in the defined condition
of chronic ankle instability.12–14
Our group has previously presented standards
for defining chronic ankle instability,15–17 docu-
menting
its
prevalence
and
most
consistent
characteristics, to promote refined and focused
efforts to research and treat chronic ankle instabil-
ity. A history of lateral ankle sprain is common in
the general population,18 suggesting this is not just
a problem among the young and physically active.
Compounding the high percentage of the popula-
tion that reports a history of lateral ankle sprain, is
evidence of early onset post-traumatic osteoarthritis
of the ankle;19 along with decreases in physical
activity levels20–22 and health-related quality of
life.23–26 This illustrates that post-traumatic osteo-
arthritis of the ankle is a degenerative health issue
that is not exclusive to middle-aged and elderly
populations. Furthermore, the financial impact of
lateral ankle sprain is high,5
27
28 with billions
spent annually on initial treatment and follow-up
care. The negative consequence of lateral ankle
sprain and chronic ankle instability are concerning,
and improved efforts to address these conditions
must be initiated.
Therefore,
the
Executive
Committee
of
the
International Ankle Consortium presents this pos-
ition paper with recommendations for information
implementation and continued research based on
the proposition that lateral ankle sprains, and the
development of chronic ankle instability, serve as a
conduit to a significant global healthcare burden.
W
e intend our recommendations to serve as a
mechanism to promote efforts to improve preven-
tion and early treatment of lateral ankle sprains. W
e
believe this will reduce the prevalence of chronic
ankle instability and associated sequelae that can
lead to the broader public health burdens of
decreased physical activity and early-onset post-
traumatic osteoarthritis of the ankle. Ultimately,
this can contribute to healthier lifestyles and pro-
motion of physical activity. A comprehensive dis-
cussion
of
the
supporting
literature
for
our
recommendations is found in a companion review
paper that: (1) establishes the burden of lateral
ankle sprains and (2) raises awareness of the
mid-term and long-term negative consequences of
lateral ankle sprains.29
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Lateral ankle sprain is the most prevalent musculo-
skeletal injury in physically active populations as
well as a common condition in the general popula-
tion, and has numerous sequelae that contribute to
a substantial healthcare burden. The treatment for
lateral ankle sprain is quite variable, with many
patients returning to activity in a short period of
time;30 however, half of those who incur a lateral
ankle sprain may never seek initial treatment.
Injury recurrence rates following lateral ankle
sprain are high, leading to a large percentage of
patients
developing
chronic
ankle
instability.31
Lingering ankle instability contributes to ongoing
sensorimotor deficits and constrained functioning,

 which associate with decreased physical activity and quality of
life. Not surprisingly, patients with a history of lateral ankle
sprain and chronic ankle instability dominate post-traumatic
osteoarthritis cases, which comprise the majority of the ankle
joint osteoarthritis surgical cases. Additionally, the onset of post-
traumatic osteoarthritis of the ankle is happening relatively early
in life.
While the direct costs for treatment of an isolated lateral
ankle sprain are relatively low, compounding these costs are the
indirect costs from follow-up care and injury-associated time
loss. With a large percentage of the population experiencing this
injury, the societal costs are high. As these treatment costs for
lateral ankle sprains are combined with the costs of managing
the loss of physical activity, and treatments for onset and care
for post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the ankle, it becomes appar-
ent that the healthcare burden that emerges from a ‘simple’
lateral ankle sprain is substantial.
In our companion evidence review paper, we have expanded
on the premise we describe above, and introduce emerging areas
that are in need of continued research.29 From that extensive
review, the Executive Committee of the International Ankle
Consortium proposes the following recommendations for utilis-
ing our summary of information, as well as outlining the needs
for specific future research. It is our opinion that implementing
these recommendations will address this public healthcare
burden to reduce the prevalence of lateral ankle sprains, as well
as overcome deficits in those who sustain a lateral ankle sprain,
ultimately improving the physical activity and quality of life in
the sporting and general populations.
Recommendations
1. To reduce the prevalence of lateral ankle sprains, efforts are
needed to promote the adoption and implementation of
effective prevention protocols. A full review of the existing
evidence is beyond the scope of this paper, but sports gov-
erning bodies, clinicians and researchers should strive to
implement existing information that provides viable, proven
solutions for lateral ankle sprain prevention.
2. Efforts should be implemented to encourage the use of a
structured examination for patients presenting with a lateral
ankle sprain. This should include appropriate clinical tests
with the addition of imaging when necessitated. This will
facilitate a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
3. Efforts for initial treatment should include the acknowledge-
ment of lateral ankle sprain as a noteworthy musculoskeletal
injury that warrants treatment by a trained healthcare profes-
sional. Continued research is needed to determine the
optimal treatment of lateral ankle sprain, to encourage
return to activity levels and to lessen the chance for reinjury.
4. To reduce the high propensity for lateral ankle sprain recur-
rence and development of chronic ankle instability, clinicians
and researchers should encourage proper follow-up with a
standard of rehabilitation that addresses sensorimotor and
arthrokinematic deficits, while simultaneously allowing for
optimal tissue restoration. Continued research is needed to
determine the optimal treatment protocols that address the
critical deficits in these patients that lead to the development
of chronic ankle instability.
5. Future research is needed to determine the onset timeline of
ankle joint post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the ankle rela-
tive to lateral ankle sprain injury. Additionally, research is
needed to determine what aberrant sensorimotor deficits
contribute to the exacerbation of ankle joint degeneration
and eventual development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
6. Future research is needed to determine the onset timeline of
declines in physical activity and quality of life following
initial lateral ankle sprain. This knowledge will help support
the need for improved interventions (timing, dosage and
intensity) to alleviate these declines.
7. Future research is needed to examine potential associations
of lateral ankle sprains with comorbidity risk due to declines
in physical activity and increased risk of post-traumatic
osteoarthritis.
8. Direct and indirect financial and societal costs for treating
lateral ankle sprains and their sequelae are high. Crude esti-
mations based on prevalence and regional costs, along with
extended timeline projections, make the potential costs stag-
gering. Future research is needed to conduct comprehensive
cost analyses from national and international perspectives.
Confirming these cost projections from longitudinal studies
will confirm the need for improved prevention and manage-
ment efforts for lateral ankle sprains.
