Abstract
Background: Studies have shown that alcohol intake trajectories differ in their associations with biomarkers of
cardiovascular functioning, but it remains unclear if they also differ in their relationship to actual coronary heart
disease (CHD) incidence. Using multiple longitudinal cohort studies, we evaluated the association between long-
term alcohol consumption trajectories and CHD.
Methods: Data were drawn from six cohorts (five British and one French). The combined analytic sample comprised
35,132 individuals (62.1% male; individual cohorts ranging from 869 to 14,247 participants) of whom 4.9% experienced
an incident (fatal or non-fatal) CHD event. Alcohol intake across three assessment periods of each cohort was used to
determine participants’ intake trajectories over approximately 10 years. Time to onset for (i) incident CHD and (ii) fatal
CHD was established using surveys and linked medical record data. A meta-analysis of individual participant data was
employed to estimate the intake trajectories' association with CHD onset, adjusting for demographic and clinical
characteristics.
Results: Compared to consistently moderate drinkers (males: 1–168 g ethanol/week; females: 1–112 g ethanol/week),
inconsistently moderate drinkers had a significantly greater risk of incident CHD [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 1.02–1.37]. An elevated risk of incident CHD was also found for former drinkers (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.13–1.
52) and consistent non-drinkers (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.21–1.78), although, after sex stratification, the latter effect was only
evident for females. When examining fatal CHD outcomes alone, only former drinkers had a significantly elevated risk,
though hazard ratios for consistent non-drinkers were near identical. No evidence of elevated CHD risk was found for
consistently heavy drinkers, and a weak association with fatal CHD for inconsistently heavy drinkers was attenuated
following adjustment for confounding factors.
Conclusions: Using prospectively recorded alcohol data, this study has shown how instability in drinking behaviours over
time is associated with risk of CHD. As well as individuals who abstain from drinking (long term or more recently), those
who are inconsistently moderate in their alcohol intake have a higher risk of experiencing CHD. This finding suggests that
policies and interventions specifically encouraging consistency in adherence to lower-risk drinking guidelines could have
public health benefits in reducing the population burden of CHD. The absence of an effect amongst heavy drinkers
should be interpreted with caution given the known wider health risks associated with such intake.

 Background
The
relationship
between
alcohol
consumption
and
coronary heart disease (CHD) is of scientific and public
health interest, yet it remains a subject of debate. Studies
have found evidence both for and against the possibility of
an association [1, 2]. The concept of a potentially cardio-
protective effect of moderate drinking compared to
non-drinking or heavier consumption, termed the U/
J-shaped curve, has been particularly controversial [3–5].
Some clinical evidence suggests that alcohol may affect
different pathways thought to influence CHD risk, includ-
ing hypertension [6, 7], body mass index (BMI) [8] and
lipid levels [9, 10]. However, this purported effect con-
tinues to be disputed [11], which poses challenges in the
formation of health-care policy and can hinder wider pub-
lic understanding of the health impact of lifestyle choices.
Much of the discussion around the evidence base for
the alcohol–CHD association has focussed on design
limitations in observational studies, such as the failure
to distinguish between non-drinkers and former drinkers
[12, 13]. The decision to stop drinking could be influ-
enced by the onset of ill health, and such sick quitters
could potentially bias estimates of disease risk in lifelong
abstainers if not analysed independently [14]. Studies
have most commonly used single baseline measures of
alcohol intake and that drinking behaviours can change
over time has, therefore, not typically been reflected in
the alcohol epidemiology literature [15, 16].
Recent efforts have been made to establish long-term
trajectories of alcohol intake, enabling differentiation be-
tween patterns of drinking that fluctuate over time. Differ-
ent trajectories have been found to have distinct patterns
of association with intermediate markers of cardiovascular
health, including carotid intima media thickness [17],
pulse wave velocity [18] and inflammatory markers [19],
but this work has yet to link these drinking typologies to
CHD events directly. More commonly, studies with longi-
tudinal assessments of drinking have used average intake,
typically between only two measurement occasions, in
evaluations of CHD risk [20], but such aggregation can
mask consumption variation over time. The importance
of capturing variability is evident from previous work that
has shown how isolated episodes of heavy drinking can
offset the potentially protective effects of moderate drink-
ing [2]. Failure to account for stability in alcohol intake
levels may bias risk estimates [21]. In the current study,
we have used an alcohol intake trajectory approach, previ-
ously employed in the study of intermediate CHD markers
[17–19], to address this research gap. We have drawn data
from multiple cohort studies to investigate whether longi-
tudinal trajectories of alcohol consumption differ in their
association with total CHD incidence (fatal or non-fatal).
Furthermore, since research has suggested that the cardio-
protective effect of moderate drinking may be less evident
with fatal CHD outcomes [22], particularly in comparison
to heavier intake [23], a secondary aim of this work was to
examine how the longitudinal trajectories are specifically
associated with mortality due to CHD.
Methods
Sample, design and cohort selection
Data were obtained from five British cohort studies: the
European Prospective Investigation of Cancer, Norfolk
Cohort (EPIC-N) [24]; the Medical Research Council’s
National
Survey
of
Health
and
Development
1946
(NSHD)
[25];
West
of
Scotland
Twenty-07:
1930s
(T07-1930s) [26]; West of Scotland Twenty-07: 1950s
(T07-1950s) [26] and Whitehall II (WII) [27]. Further data
were obtained from an additional French cohort: Gaz et
Electricité (GAZEL) [28]. Descriptions of each cohort are
provided in Fig. 1 and complete cohort profiles are available
via the above citations. The cohorts were chosen for their
coverage of relevant variables and design similarity. They
each included prospective alcohol intake data across three
assessments covering an approximate 10-year interval, as
well as pertinent covariate and verified CHD outcome data.
Prior to commencement of the analysis, additional harmon-
isation was performed for all cohort datasets to maximise
consistency in variable names and definitions. The study
design was pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier
NCT03133689), and a STROBE statement is provided in
Additional file 1 (Section S1).
The combined dataset initially comprised 62,799 partici-
pant records in total (cohort-specific counts are provided
in Fig. 1). The exposure variable was measured across
three assessment points covering a decade on average,
with the last assessment point treated as the study base-
line from which time-to-event outcomes were measured.
Of the initial sample, 19,277 participants were excluded
due to attrition or having experienced a CHD event prior
to the study baseline. A further 8390 participants were not
included due to incomplete data linkage. Following these
exclusion criteria (further details of which are provided in
Fig. 1), a sample of 35,132 (62.1% male) participants
remained and these comprised the analytic sample.
Measures
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was CHD incidence, as ascertained
from linked health records and survey data. Non-fatal
CHD data were available for NSHD, but the time to event
from the end of the exposure period was not ascertainable,
so this study was omitted from the analysis of the incident
CHD end point. Mortality due to CHD was examined as a
secondary outcome in supplementary analyses, and all
cohorts contributed data to this analysis. CHD events were
previously coded using the codebook of the International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
O’Neill et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:124 
Page 2 of 13
 Problems (ICD) [29]: ICD-9: 410–414 Ischaemic heart
disease and ICD-10: I20-I25 Ischaemic heart diseases. For
the Twenty-07 cohorts, non-fatal CHD events were identi-
fied using the Royal College of General Practitioners’ code-
book [30] (codes 1940, 1945 and 1950). Survival time was
calculated for all participants as time (in years) between
the end of the alcohol assessment period and date of CHD
event, death from non-CHD causes, study dropout or last
date of data linkage (study specific), whichever occurred
first. Additional details of study enrolment and follow-up
procedures are available in Additional file 1 (Section S10).
Exposure
Trajectories of self-reported alcohol intake were derived
using weekly alcohol intake measurements collected across
three consecutive waves of each cohort study. The result-
ant trajectories comprised a decade of follow-up on aver-
age. Standard drink definitions were used to define alcohol
(ethanol) content in reported drinks (half-pints of beer or
cider, small glasses of wine, and single servings of spirits):
8 g ethanol in the British cohort data and 10 g in the
French GAZEL data [31, 32]. Reported consumption at
each measurement occasion was categorised according to
UK drinking guidelines at the time of data collection, which
recommended a maximum intake level for lower-risk
drinking of 168 g of ethanol a week for males and 112 g of
ethanol a week for females [33]. Although recently pub-
lished UK guidelines have proposed identical thresholds for
males and females [34], the analytic report upon which they
are based identified risk functions for both CHD morbidity
and mortality that notably differed between males and
females [35], particularly at higher levels of consumption
[23]. The focus in the present study was on stability of ad-
herence to lower-risk drinking guidelines over time, and we
consequently categorised participants according to longitu-
dinal profiles as defined in Table 1. Consistently moderate

 drinkers were used as the reference category [14]. Drinkers
with inconsistent levels of alcohol intake were defined
according to their modal intake, i.e. their most frequent
level of intake. For example, where a participant had an
equal number of heavy and moderate drinking periods,
they were categorised as inconsistently heavy drinkers. This
ensured that participants who occasionally drank heavily
were not grouped with participants who consistently ad-
hered to lower-risk drinking guidelines.
Covariates
Known demographic and lifestyle risk factors for CHD
were selected for inclusion in the modelling, including sex
and age. Socioeconomic position was defined using the
participant’s
occupational
status,
categorised
as
low
(non-skilled or semi-skilled), intermediate (mid-level) or
high (professional or executive) [36]. Smoking status was
assessed, with participants categorised as current, ex- or
non-smokers. To account for variability in the alcohol
intake assessment interval, the time difference between
initial and final assessments was calculated for each
participant. Additional clinical data were obtained on BMI
(measured as kg/m2) and self-reported high blood pres-
sure or use of antihypertensive medication (yes/no). All of
the covariates were assessed at the commencement of the
follow-up period for CHD (the occasion of the third and
final alcohol assessment), which we have defined as the
current study’s baseline.
Statistical analysis
Prior to undertaking inferential analyses, multiple imput-
ation by chained equations was completed using the R
‘mice’ package (v2.30) to address missing covariate and ex-
posure data. Altogether, 100 imputations were performed
for both the incident and fatal CHD analyses, ensuring
congruence
between
the
imputation
and substantive
models. Outcome data with the Nelson–Aalen hazard [37]
were used but not imputed.
The modelling was performed as individual participant
data (IPD) meta-analyses, accounting for the clustering of
participants within each cohort. Both one- and two-step
approaches are available and can give comparable results
under particular conditions [38]. However, the one-step
approach, in which all data are analysed simultaneously
with clustering incorporated as a random effect term, is
thought to be less prone to bias in pooled effect estimates
and standard errors [39] and to be the preferred approach
where covariate adjustments are required or where
inter-study heterogeneity may be present [40, 41]. Conse-
quently, one-step IPD meta-analysis was performed using
hierarchical (mixed effects) Cox regression modelling in-
corporating a random effect term for cohort membership
with maximum likelihood estimations. Models were devel-
oped iteratively: an initial model accounting for age, sex
and intake assessment interval (partially adjusted for
confounding),
followed
by
an
extended
model
that
additionally included smoking status and socioeconomic
status covariates (maximally adjusted for confounding).
Supplementary
modelling
extended
the
adjustment
further, including potential mediators, to examine clinical
pathways (maximally adjusted for confounding and medi-
ation). Schoenfeld residuals were plotted to ascertain that
the proportional hazards assumption
had not been
violated (available in Additional file 1: Section S2).
Given most existing work in this area has employed sin-
gle one-off measures of alcohol intake, for comparative
purposes, an initial IPD meta-analysis was undertaken in
this study using participants’ final intake measurement
prior to the outcome follow-up period (i.e. at this study’s
baseline). This single measure categorisation allowed a
distinction to be made between different intake levels
(none, moderate or heavy), but not stability of intake over
time or discontinuation of drinking. This analysis was
followed by the modelling of the primary exposure, the
longitudinal drinking trajectory categorisation. Additional
stratified analyses were also completed to explore specific

 characteristics of the alcohol–CHD relationship. Research
has suggested that the association of alcohol with cardio-
vascular risk may differ between older and younger popu-
lations [42], so age-stratified modelling of the longitudinal
drinker typology was also performed (aged ≤55 vs
>55 years at this study’s baseline). Further stratified ana-
lyses were undertaken to explore sex-specific effects. Fi-
nally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the
impact of modelling assumptions on this study’s main
results.
The statistical analyses were performed in R (v3.4.1; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
All statistical significance testing was two-tailed, using
an inference threshold of p < 0.05.
Results
Sample characteristics
Descriptive statistics, for the overall sample and stratified
by drinker type, are presented in Table 2. Additional
descriptive statistics, stratified by cohort, are provided in
Additional file 1 (Section S3). Statistics on data missing-
ness are also reported in Table 2, and further detail is
provided in Additional file 1 (Section S4).
Across the drinker types, mean age ranged from
57.1 years (standard deviation, SD = 6.4) for the inconsist-
ently moderate drinkers to 61.9 (SD = 9.1) for the former
drinkers. Heavy drinkers were most likely to be male (con-
sistently heavy 86.4%; inconsistently heavy 76.8%), whereas
abstainers were more likely to be female (consistent
non-drinker 62.3%; former drinker 55.1%). Heavy drinkers
had the highest proportion reporting past or current smok-
ing (consistently heavy 50.7%; inconsistently heavy 50.4%).
Consistently moderate drinkers were most likely to be of
high socioeconomic position (47.8%), followed by both
consistently and inconsistently heavy drinkers (45.9% and
46.5%).
Conversely,
consistent
non-drinkers
had
the
highest proportion in a low socioeconomic position
(23.9%). BMI showed little variation between drinker types
(all had means of 26 kg/m2). Known hypertension was
least common amongst consistently moderate drinkers
(26.2%) and most common amongst inconsistently heavy
drinkers (31.6%) and former drinkers (31.7%). The mean
assessment interval covered by the drinking trajectories
was similar across all drinker types (range 10.7–11.8 years).
Crude outcome statistics are also provided in Table 2.
In the pooled sample, 4.9% of participants experienced
an incident CHD (fatal or non-fatal) event during the
follow-up.
This
was
lowest
for
consistently
heavy
drinkers (3.8%) and highest for former-drinkers (6.1%).
The mean follow-up time was 12.6 years (SD = 4.3). In
total, 397,264.4 person-years at risk were captured, with
mean person-years varying from 11.0 years (former
drinkers) to 13.9 years (consistently heavy drinkers). The
overall CHD incidence rate was 4.3 CHD cases per 1000
person-years.
The proportion of individuals dying due to CHD
during the follow-up was 0.9%. This varied between
drinker types, from 0.6% for the consistently heavy
group to 1.3% amongst consistent non-drinkers. The
mean follow-up time was 13.7 years (SD = 4.1). In
combination, 480,124.7 person-years were captured
for this outcome, with the mean person-years again
lowest for former drinkers (11.9 years) but highest for
inconsistently
moderate
drinkers
(14.8
years).
The
overall rate of fatal CHD was 0.7 cases per 1000
person-years.
Single intake measure categorisation
In a series of hierarchical Cox regression models with
alcohol intake defined according to a single intake
measurement just prior to the outcome follow-up
period, no discernible difference in incident CHD risk
was observed between heavy and moderate drinkers.
However, those who reported no intake at this most
recent measurement point had an increased risk of
CHD compared to those who drank but did so within
the recommended limits [model maximally adjusted
for confounding: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) = 1.11–1.43]. The estimates are il-
lustrated in Fig. 2 and reported in full in Additional
file 1 (Section S5a).
Longitudinal intake trajectories
When modelling overall CHD risk using the longitudinal
intake typology with adjustment for age, sex and intake
assessment interval, both consistent non-drinkers (HR =
1.51, 95% CI = 1.25–1.82) and former drinkers (HR =
1.35, 95% CI = 1.16–1.57) showed greater risk of incident
CHD compared to participants who reported persist-
ently moderate intake. A smaller but still significant ef-
fect was also found for inconsistently moderate drinkers
(HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.04–1.40). The effects remained
statistically significant after additional adjustment for
smoking status and socioeconomic position (detailed in
Fig. 3). No differences in risk for heavy drinking, consist-
ent or otherwise, were found.
When potential mediators, BMI and hypertension,
were included in the modelling, the drinker type
effects were attenuated, with the effect for inconsist-
ently
moderate
drinkers
becoming
non-significant
(HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.00–1.34). Full details of the
modelling steps are provided in Additional file 1

S5a),

with increased risk of CHD.
Stratified analyses
In age-stratified analyses of the longitudinal trajectory
exposure, participants aged up to 55 years and those
aged above showed comparable associations with the
incident CHD outcome (visualised in Fig. 4). Consistent
non-drinkers (aged ≤55: HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.29–3.02;
aged > 55: HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.11–1.71) and former
drinkers (aged ≤55: HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.09–2.37; aged
> 55: HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.08–1.51) both demonstrated
significantly greater CHD risk compared to consistently
moderate drinkers. However, inconsistently moderate
drinkers in the older age group also had an increased
risk of incident CHD (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06–1.48), a
finding

(Section S6a).
Further stratified analyses were performed to assess if
the alcohol–CHD association differed by sex, again
using the longitudinal intake categories (illustrated in
Fig. 5). Amongst male participants, former drinkers
were at significantly greater risk of incident CHD
compared to consistently moderate drinkers after max-
imal adjustment for confounding factors (HR = 1.29,
95% CI = 1.06–1.56). After equivalent adjustment in the
female stratum, both former drinkers (HR = 1.38, 95%
CI = 1.07–1.78) and consistent non-drinkers (HR = 1.91,
95% CI = 1.43–2.55) showed increased risk compared to
their consistently moderate counterparts. A full table of
results is provided in Additional file 1 (Section S7a).

 CHD mortality
When analyses were replicated using fatal CHD as the out-
come, most results were comparable to those obtained
when using all incident CHD events. For the longitudinal
intake trajectories, and in contrast to the incident CHD
analysis, inconsistently moderate drinkers did not have a
greater CHD mortality risk compared to the consistently
moderate reference group (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.72–1.52).
Only former drinkers had a significantly elevated risk of
fatal CHD (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.07–2.22) after maximal
adjustment for confounding factors, but the HR for consist-
ent non-drinkers was near identical (HR = 1.52, 95% CI =
0.97–2.38), implying that again both drinker types were at
elevated risk of fatal CHD. Inconsistently heavy drinkers
did show some evidence of having an increased risk of
experiencing a fatal CHD event in the lesser-adjusted
model (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.99–2.37), but it did not
achieve statistical significance and was attenuated after add-
itional adjustment for smoking status and socioeconomic
status (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.87–2.11). Full model details
are provided in Additional file 1 (Section S5b).
Age-stratified analyses revealed similar patterns of
association as with the pooled (non-stratified) analysis. In
sex-stratified analyses, however, some differences were ob-
served, with only female consistent non-drinkers having
an elevated risk of fatal CHD after adjustment for covariates

Sensitivity analyses
As the GAZEL cohort was the only non-UK data source
included in this study, the longitudinal modelling was
replicated with this cohort’s data omitted to verify that its
inclusion did not introduce bias. Results obtained using
only UK data sources were essentially unchanged from
the findings attained when all cohorts were included
(details are provided in Additional file 1: Section S8). To
identify the impact of the imputation model implemented
in the primary analyses, the modelling was also performed
using complete case data only. The point estimates and
significance of effects were essentially unchanged from the
imputed data modelling (see Additional file 1: Section S9).
Discussion
In this study, we utilised prospectively collected longitu-
dinal data on alcohol consumption from six cohorts to
examine the association of 10-year drinking trajectories
and
risk
of
developing
and/or
dying
from
CHD.
Through iterative modelling that accounted for hetero-
geneity across the datasets and potential confounders of
the alcohol–CHD association, our work has shown that
incident CHD risk is significantly higher amongst both
non-drinkers and former drinkers compared to drinkers
who always adhered to lower-risk intake guidelines. We
have also demonstrated that the stability of such adher-
ence is pertinent. Participants who mostly drank moder-
ately, but not persistently so, had greater risk of incident
CHD compared to their consistently moderate drinking
counterparts.
In
terms
of
CHD
mortality,
former
drinkers and consistent non-drinkers were again found
to be at higher risk, although the effect for the persistent
abstainers was somewhat attenuated after adjustment for
smoking status and socioeconomic status. We found no
evidence that heavy drinking was associated with risk of
CHD, and reasons for this are discussed below. Overall,
the findings from this study support the notion of a car-
dioprotective effect of moderate alcohol intake relative
to non-drinking. However, crucially, stability in the level
of alcohol consumption over time appears to be an im-
portant modifier of this association.
The use of repeat measurements of alcohol consump-
tion in lieu of a one-time assessment has enabled us to
measure the stability of consumption over time and to ad-
dress the call for research on the role of intake trajectories
in CHD onset [43]. Through this approach, we have dem-
onstrated how intermittent adherence to lower-risk drink-
ing guidelines, i.e. an inconsistently moderate intake, is
associated with an increased risk of incident CHD. This
provides some support for the proposal that variability in
alcohol intake levels can offset the potential protective ef-
fects of moderate drinking [2, 20]. An association was
found between inconsistently heavy drinkers and fatal
CHD, although the wide confidence bounds and weaken-
ing of the association following maximal adjustment for
confounding factors limits interpretation of this effect. It
may be that unstable drinking patterns reflect wider
lifestyle changes across the life course, and possibly even
the impact of periods of ill health or life stress. The effects
were further attenuated when adjustment was made for
clinical characteristics, namely BMI and hypertension,
suggesting that these may both act as potential pathways
through which unstable drinking trajectories are associ-
ated with CHD. The impact of BMI could also reflect the
role of other lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise.
Access to prospectively recorded alcohol intake data
across multiple assessment times has also allowed the
current
study
to
distinguish
recent
abstainers
from
longer-term non-drinkers in a manner that helps reduce
the potential for recall bias. Such bias can occur where
drinking behaviour is retrospectively measured at a single
time point [44], a technique commonly used in alcohol
epidemiology research. In line with the sick-quitter hypoth-
esis [14], former drinkers were found in the present study
to have an elevated risk of both incident and fatal CHD.
These effects were attenuated following adjustment for the
clinical covariates, suggesting that poor health may explain
former drinkers’ increased likelihood of developing CHD
and perhaps may even have motivated the decision to
abstain itself. Consistent non-drinkers, however, did also
have a significant risk of incident CHD after adjustment for
potential confounders, and although the error bounds were
wider, their CHD mortality estimate was equivalent to that
of former drinkers, implying that short- and long-term ab-
stinence are both associated with an increased risk of CHD.
Despite our finding of parity in CHD risk amongst
non-drinkers and former drinkers in the pooled sample
analyses, previous research has suggested that there may
be age-dependent differences in this association. How-
ever, this observation was based on studies in which
abstinence was determined retrospectively from a single
baseline assessment [42], in contrast to the repeated
measures design used in the current study. When we
stratified our sample by age, the associations between
both abstainer groups and incident CHD risk was com-
parable for younger (≤55 years) and older (>55 years)
participants. As similar results were also observed for
risk of fatal CHD, our findings challenge the argument
that
there
are
age-dependent
differences
between
long-term and more recent abstainers, yet the wide con-
fidence bounds around the fatal CHD risk estimates for
those aged 55 or below arguably restricts such infer-
ences. A divergence between the age groups was found for
inconsistently moderate drinkers. Such drinkers in the
O’Neill et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:124 
Page 9 of 13
 older subsample had a significantly elevated risk of incident
CHD, an effect that was not evident in the younger group.
Older participants may have been more likely to experi-
ence lifestyle changes that influenced their drinking habits.
Retirement, for example, is known to co-occur with
increases in alcohol intake [45, 46], particularly amongst
existing drinkers [47].
It has also been suggested that the J-shaped association
between alcohol consumption and CHD may be more pro-
nounced in women than men [23], a theory that our study
supports in part. Whilst both male and female former
drinkers had significantly increased risk of incident CHD,
only female consistent non-drinkers showed such an ele-
vated risk. Female non-drinkers (both long term and more
recent abstainers) were similarly at risk of fatal CHD, even
after maximal adjustment for confounding factors. Re-
search has also suggested that alcohol intake may increase
oestrogen levels in women, which in turn act as a protect-
ive factor against CHD [48]. Male former drinkers also
showed significantly greater risk of CHD mortality than
consistently moderate drinkers after accounting for age
and other characteristics, but this difference was attenu-
ated once the estimates were adjusted for lifestyle behav-
iours such as smoking. This suggests that these additional
covariates may play a greater role than drinking in the oc-
currence of fatal CHD events for males. Previous literature
has proposed that smoking can offset any alcohol-related
differences in CHD mortality risk amongst men [49].
In the present study, no association with CHD risk
was found for consistently heavy drinkers. Stable pat-
terns of heavy drinking may reflect continued good
health across the assessment interval [50], the converse
of the sick quitter type. Statistically significant associa-
tions between high levels of alcohol intake and CHD on-
set risk have been observed in some previous research
[21, 51], but not persistently so [52–54]. Although our
study identified heavy drinkers across all cohorts, only a
limited number were in the female sample, potentially
limiting statistical power in their analysis, and by exten-
sion, in the non-stratified analysis. This issue of small
counts for female heavy drinkers has similarly con-
strained earlier work in this area [1]. Particularly heavy
drinkers may be under-represented in the datasets uti-
lised in this study, which could have biased downwards
the estimate of association between heavy intake and
cardiovascular risk. If further data are available, it may
be possible to explore alternative intake thresholds and
validate the present study’s findings. Similarly, additional
data may enable the disaggregation of CHD phenotypes,
which could provide more nuanced insights into how
heavy drinking is associated with different variants of
the disease [55]. Consequently, the interpretation of the
absence of an effect amongst heavy drinkers in the
current study should be done cautiously, particularly in
light of the known wider health impact of heavy alcohol
intake levels [56].
There are additional limitations to our study that warrant
consideration. For example, selection bias may have
occurred [57], in which participants dropped out of the
cohort studies before the outcome assessment period. It is
possible that some heavy drinkers could have experienced
adverse health outcomes at a younger age and discontin-
ued their research participation. Particularly heavy drinkers
are already known to be under-sampled in population-level
surveys [32, 58], so caution is required in drawing infer-
ences about such elevated intake levels. Similarly, informa-
tion on alcohol intake prior to the exposure assessment
period was not consistently available, so the long-term
abstainers modelled in this current study may include
some participants who ceased drinking prior to recruit-
ment. Given that the current work included only cohort
studies for which we had access to individual-level data,
the concept of availability bias [59] is also pertinent. Access
to additional datasets may help further validate our find-
ings. Such increased sample sizes would also permit more
detailed examination than was possible in the current
study into the intake variance that occurs amongst drinkers
who are inconsistent in their adherence to lower-risk
drinking guidelines. Relatedly, the identification of drinking
trajectories in the present study was based on drinking vol-
ume only and so we were not equipped to look at the role
of episodic heavy drinking [60]. Further clarification of the
alcohol–CHD association may be achieved where sufficient
data are available on other characteristics of consumption,
such as drinking frequency. All cohorts included in the
current study used self-report for determining alcohol
intake; although this is vulnerable to estimation errors,
research has shown that drinking data collected through
this method remains valid and reliable [44, 61]. A further
design consideration in interpreting the current study’s
results is the harmonisation of data across the different
cohort datasets. Establishing equivalent variable definitions
in the harmonisation of data constrains the level of detail
and raises the possibility of residual confounding. For
example, it was not possible to establish a more nuanced
smoking variable due to data availability and so there is a
possibility of residual confounding by smoking intensity.
Relatedly, although an equal number of intake measure-
ments was used across cohorts to establish intake trajec-
tories, the observed time intervals varied (see Section S2 of
Additional file 1). While adjustment was made through
inclusion of assessment interval length in the regression
modelling, it remains possible that limitations in the
cohort data harmonisation may have introduced bias.
Although country-specific drink conversions were used to
calculate alcohol intake [31], there remains potential differ-
ences between GAZEL and the other cohorts, such as the
possible influence of dietary differences for which residual
O’Neill et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:124 
Page 10 of 13
 confounding could also have occurred [62]. The French
paradox, for example, implies that that there is an inverse
relationship between saturated fat intake and CHD onset
risk that is specific to France [63], a relationship in which
alcohol debatably plays a role [64]. However, sensitivity
analyses showed that the exclusion of GAZEL data did not
modify the current study findings. Moreover, the use
throughout this study of mixed-effects modelling has
helped account for data clustering and thereby helped
improve the validity of the results obtained.
Conclusions
In summary, the present study has utilised longitudinal
alcohol intake data pooled from multiple cohort sources
to establish trajectories of drinking behaviour and assess
their association with risk of incident and fatal CHD. The
study has demonstrated that recent and more long-term
abstainers are at elevated risk of developing CHD,
although the effect for persistent abstainers may be
confined to females only. The trajectory approach used in
this work has also enabled us to show that stability of
alcohol intake levels amongst those who do not abstain is
pertinent to risk of CHD onset. Drinkers who mostly, but
inconsistently, adhered to moderate drinking levels, par-
ticularly if aged over 55 years, were found to have elevated
risk of incident CHD. There was also some indication that
variability in drinking levels amongst heavier drinkers
were associated with increased likelihood of CHD mortal-
ity, although that effect was attenuated by adjustment for
other
demographic
and
lifestyle
characteristics.
No
evidence of elevated risk amongst consistently heavy
drinkers was found but this was potentially attributable to
under-representation of such drinkers in the sampled data.
These findings, nonetheless, illustrate that longitudinal
alcohol trajectories have added utility in identifying at-risk
drinker types beyond what is possible with single assess-
ments of alcohol consumption. Our findings provide add-
itional insight into the potential cardioprotective effect of
moderate alcohol intake, and indicate that consistency of
intake levels is a relevant consideration in cardiovascular
risk assessments, and in related health education efforts.
