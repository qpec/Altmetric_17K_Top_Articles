Macrophages have a central role in innate immunity, but they also play 
a part in the coordination of metabolic inflammation linked to meta-
bolic diseases, including obesity and T2D1,2. As obesity progresses, the 
expansion of AT coincides with the recruitment of macrophages, along 
with other types of immune cell. Specifically, resident macrophages 
switch into a metabolically activated state and initiate the recruit-
ment of pro-inflammatory macrophages, collectively referred to as AT 
macrophages (ATMs), particularly in visceral fat3–10. In both humans 
and mice with obesity, ATMs are considered to be a major source 
of inflammatory chemokines, such as C-C motif ligand-2 (CCL2, 
also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MCP-1)11, 
and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 (ref. 12) and tumor necro-
sis factor (TNF)-α13. The resulting state of low-grade metabolic 
inflammation, referred to as metaflammation14, interferes with AT 
expansion and metabolism related to lipid and glucose homeosta-
sis. Concomitantly, AT-derived lipids and inflammatory mediators 
 
accumulate in peripheral tissues, such as the liver and muscle, and 
this is a crucial determinant for the development of insulin resistance, 
T2D, and associated metabolic disorders such as hepatic steatosis.
Despite advances in our understanding of the physiological and cel-
lular events that trigger inflammatory signaling linked to AT dysregu-
lation and ATM activation in obesity and T2D, our understanding of 
the underlying control mechanisms at the genomic and epigenomic 
levels is currently limited. Studies using cultured mouse macrophages 
have revealed an intrinsic relationship of transcription factor (TF) 
binding (cistromes), chromatin modifications (epigenomes), and gene 
expression (transcriptomes), both under nonstimulated conditions 
and in response to inflammatory signals such as lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS), an agonist of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (refs. 15–17). These 
genomic studies identified a key role of lineage-determining ‘pioneer’ 
 
TFs, such as purine-rich (PU)-box transcription factor PU.1 and 
CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), in the establishment

Humans with obesity differ in their susceptibility to developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This variation may 
relate to the extent of adipose tissue (AT) inflammation that develops as their obesity progresses. The state of macrophage activation 
has a central role in determining the degree of AT inflammation and thus its dysfunction, and these states are driven by epigenomic 
alterations linked to gene expression. The underlying mechanisms that regulate these alterations, however, are poorly defined. Here 
we demonstrate that a co-repressor complex containing G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) crucially controls the macrophage 
epigenome during activation by metabolic stress. The study of AT from humans with and without obesity revealed correlations 
between reduced GPS2 expression in macrophages, elevated systemic and AT inflammation, and diabetic status. The causality 
of this relationship was confirmed by using macrophage-specific Gps2-knockout (KO) mice, in which inappropriate co-repressor 
complex function caused enhancer activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression and hypersensitivity toward metabolic-stress 
signals. By contrast, transplantation of GPS2-overexpressing bone marrow into two mouse models of obesity (ob/ob and diet-induced 
obesity) reduced inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity. Thus, our data reveal a potentially reversible disease mechanism 
that links co-repressor-dependent epigenomic alterations in macrophages to AT inflammation and the development of T2D.

of macrophage-specific enhancers18,19. They further revealed insights 
into the role of signal-regulated TFs, such as members of the activator 
protein-1 (AP-1), interferon-response factor (IRF), and nuclear factor 
(NF)-κB families, in the rapid transcriptional response to inflamma-
tory signals15,19,20.
To modulate the chromatin landscape and thus transcription in 
macrophages, TFs need to cooperate with co-regulators. Inflammatory 
gene activation during the transition from an inactive to an active 
chromatin state involves a co-repressor to co-activator switch, which, 
along with changes in histone modifications, triggers transcriptional 
initiation and elongation15,20,21. Notably, the perceived passive role 
of co-regulators (‘being recruited by TFs’) probably limits our appre-
ciation of the regulatory impact that these co-regulators may have, 
which becomes important in light of disease-associated alterations. 
Therefore, it remains to be explored which of the many candidate 
co-regulators crucially modulates macrophage activation, particu-
larly in the context of obesity-associated metabolic inflammation. 
Furthermore, it remains to be addressed whether and how metabolic-
disease status affects the expression and function of co-regulators.
Among the most promising candidates currently to fulfill such 
a role in macrophage activation is a fundamental co-repressor 
 
complex that contains histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), as well as the 
core subunits GPS2; nuclear receptor co-repressor NCOR (encoded 
by NCOR1); silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone 
receptors SMRT (encoded by NCOR2); and transducing beta-like pro-
teins TBL1 (encoded by TBL1X) and TBLR1 (encoded by TBLXR1) 
 
(refs. 22–25). Initial studies in vitro revealed that this complex 
controls anti-inflammatory pathways, including nuclear receptor 
transrepression in macrophages26–28, in hepatocytes29, and in adi-
pocytes30,31. However, macrophage-specific and adipocyte-specific 
Ncor1 KO mice display an unexpected anti-inflammatory phenotype, 
as compared to wild-type (WT) mice, such as reduced AT inflamma-
tion and improved insulin sensitivity, upon diet-induced obesity32,33. 
Although the relevance of these paradoxical phenotypes to the obese 
condition in humans has yet to be addressed, they raise the possibility 
that subunits other than NCOR are crucial determinants of the anti-
inflammatory role of the complex.
Here we address these issues and describe the unique dysregulation 
of GPS2, but not of any of the other complex-core subunits, in the 
ATMs of human subjects with obesity and T2D. By generating and 
characterizing macrophage-specific and adipocyte-specific Gps2 KO 
mice, along with carrying out bone marrow transplantation (BMT) 
experiments in mice with obesity (ob/ob or diet-induced obesity), and 
by performing genomic and epigenomic profiling, as well as human-
correlation analyses, we provide evidence that the anti-inflammatory 
GPS2 pathway required for proper insulin sensitivity is conserved in 
mice and humans. Furthermore, our study uncovers a hitherto unrec-
ognized epigenomic disease mechanism that explains how the inap-
propriate function of a GPS2-containing co-repressor complex causes 
an increase in signal responsiveness of macrophage activation upon 
metabolic stress, which thereby further accelerates the progression of 
obesity-associated inflammation toward insulin resistance and T2D. 
Our findings imply that strategies that aim to restore GPS2 pathways 
in the ATMs of subjects with T2D may be of therapeutic value.
RESULTS
Relationship of GPS2 expression with T2D in humans
Given the suspected nonredundant roles of different co-repressor 
 
complex subunits in the control of macrophage inflammation linked to 
AT dysfunction and T2D, we analyzed whether the mRNA expression 
 
levels of these different subunits were correlated with the inflamma-
tory and diabetic status of human subjects from three distinct popu-
lations (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). We focused on the 
analysis of ATMs isolated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). 
Population 1 (P1) was composed of subjects without obesity (n = 5; 
body mass index (BMI), 27 ± 0.5) versus with obesity (n = 21; BMI, 
47.6 ± 1.4); population 2 (P2) consisted of subjects with obesity but 
without diabetes (n = 11; BMI, 43 ± 1.4) versus with both obesity and 
diabetes (n = 14; BMI, 42 ± 1.7); and population 3 (P3) consisted of 
subjects with neither obesity nor diabetes (n = 8) versus those without 
obesity but with diabetes (n = 16) (matched BMI, 29 ± 0.9).
We observed that in P1, the expression of GPS2 and HDAC3, but not 
of other subunits, was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in CD14+-selected 
visceral AT (VAT) macrophages from subjects with obesity than in 
those from subjects without obesity (Fig. 1b and Supplementary 
 
Fig. 1a,b). Of note, subjects with diabetes had lower GPS2 and HDAC3 
expression than did controls without diabetes in visceral ATMs from 
P2 and subcutaneous AT (SAT) from P3 (Fig. 1c,d).
To investigate the relationship between the expression of GPS2 (and 
genes encoding the other core subunits) and inflammatory status, 
we determined the expression of chemokine CCL2 (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 1c,d) and analyzed correlations in P2 and P3 (Supplementary 
Table 2). The analysis revealed that GPS2 levels were negatively cor-
related with CCL2 levels in populations both with (visceral ATMs, 
P2) and without (SAT, P3) obesity (Fig. 1e,f).
The unique role of GPS2 in the context of T2D in subjects from both 
P2 and P3 subjects became evident through the analysis of the per-
centage of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a glycemic parameter of dia-
betes severity, in correlation with the mRNA expression levels of the 
various subunits (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). The analysis 
revealed that the expression of GPS2 only, and not of the remaining 
subunit-encoding genes, was associated with diabetic status.
To decipher the possible causal relationship between GPS2 expres-
sion and macrophage activation, we conducted loss-of-function and 
gain-of-function studies ex vivo in CD14+-selected ATMs (Fig. 1i 
and Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). GPS2 overexpression in the VAT 
ATMs of subjects with obesity (i.e., ATMs from a high-grade inflam-
matory environment) repressed—as compared to GFP overexpres-
sion—expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine (CCL2 and 
IL8) genes and cytokine genes (IL1B, IL6, and TNF) (Fig. 1i). On 
the contrary, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated GPS2 depletion in 
the SAT ATMs of subjects without obesity (i.e., ATMs from a low-
grade inflammatory environment) was associated with a higher level, 
as compared to control siRNA treatment, of CCL2 and IL8 mRNA 
expression. By contrast, there was no change in IL1B and IL6 expres-
sion (Fig. 1i). We further depleted GPS2 using small interfering (si) 
RNA in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs derived 
from healthy donors) under basal (nonstimulated) conditions, and 
determined changes in gene expression using microarray (Fig. 1j and 
Supplementary Fig. 1g). The approach revealed a pro-inflammatory 
gene expression signature linked to major TLR and chemokine path-
ways, which was higher upon the depletion of GPS2, as compared to 
treatment with control siRNA. The human macrophage GPS2 signa-
ture was confirmed by RT–qPCR, a process that also identified CXCL8 
(also known as IL8) as a major cytokine gene under the control of 
GPS2 (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Fig. 1g,h).
Collectively, these data suggest that dysregulation of GPS2 expres-
sion and function in human macrophages, particular in ATMs, could 
be causally related to AT inflammation in humans with obesity 
 
and diabetes.

Gps2 KO macrophages are pro-inflammatory and signal sensitized
To investigate the macrophage function of GPS2 in vivo, we generated 
myeloid-specific Gps2 KO mice in the C57BL/6 background (LysM-
Cre-Gps2flox/flox), hereafter referred to as MKO mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 2a). GPS2 was efficiently removed at the mRNA and protein 
levels in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) and in thi-
oglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TEPMs) of MKO mice 
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2b). GPS2 depletion did not alter 
the expression of other complex-subunit genes in macrophages, and 
Gps2 expression was unaffected in other tissues examined (Fig. 2a 
and Supplementary Fig. 2b,c).
Given the diversity of various macrophage populations34, we 
investigated GPS2-regulated transcriptomes in BMDMs, TEPMs, 
and the AT SVF. We first analyzed gene expression in differentiated 
but nonstimulated BMDMs from MKO mice, relative to WT mice, 
using microarrays (Fig. 2b). Of the annotated genes, approximately 
500 genes were upregulated upon the removal of GPS2. Pathway 
analysis revealed the enrichment of pro-inflammatory signaling 
pathways in MKO versus WT BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 2d). 
We confirmed the microarray results for selected signature genes 
using RT–qPCR in BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 2e) and TEPMs 
(Supplementary Fig. 2f). In agreement with the human data, chem-
okine genes such as Ccl2 and Ccl7 were among the top-ranking 
regulated genes in both types of MKO macrophages, as compared 
to those in WT mice.
Next, we performed bioinformatics analysis and found that the pro-
inflammatory GPS2 signature, obtained in nonstimulated TEPMs, 
substantially overlaps with the LPS-induced TLR4 pathway that is 
characteristic of pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophage activation 
(Supplementary Fig. 2g). To explore this further, we treated both 
BMDMs and TEPMs from WT mice and MKO mice for 6 h with LPS, 
and quantified gene expression by RT–qPCR (Fig. 2c,d). We observed

an enhanced LPS response of Ccl2 and Ccl7 expression both in MKO 
BMDMs and TEPMs, whereas the cytokine genes Il1b and Il6 were 
enhanced only in MKO TEPMs, as compared to WT cells. We also 
observed a sensitized LPS response (as compared to WT cells) upon 
the adenovirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) depletion of 
GPS2 in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (hereafter referred to 
as RAW cells) (Supplementary Fig. 2h). On the contrary, ectopic 
overexpression of GPS2 in RAW cells suppressed LPS induction of 
the same genes, as compared to control cells overexpressing GFP 
(Supplementary Fig. 2i). Given the higher LPS-sensitivity of GPS2-
deficient macrophages in vitro, we also investigated consequences 
in vivo using a mouse model of LPS-induced endotoxemia. Gene-
expression analysis of TEPMs from WT and MKO mice injected with 
LPS (1 mg/kg) confirmed that the pro-inflammatory LPS response 
 
in vivo (after 16 h) was exacerbated in MKO mice relative to WT mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 2j).
Finally, we asked whether metabolic activation was similarly 
affected by the removal of GPS2 from macrophages. Because the 
TLR4 pathway, in particular, orchestrates obesity-linked metabolic 
inflammation by sensing an abundance of saturated fatty acids5, 
we treated TEPMs from WT and MKO mice for 24 h with palmi-
tate (C16:0) and observed elevated expression of pro-inflammatory 
 
signature genes in GPS2-deficient versus WT macrophages (Fig. 2e). 
To address the question under physiological conditions in AT, we ana-
lyzed gene expression in the SVF of epididymal white AT (epiWAT) of 
WT and MKO mice fed with a low-fat diet (LFD) (Fig. 2f). The results 
confirmed the elevated expression of GPS2 signature genes in MKO 
versus WT macrophages in an environment enriched in saturated 
fatty acids (Fig. 2e,f).
Taken together, these data suggest a dual anti-inflammatory role of 
GPS2 in (i) the repression of gene activation in nonstimulated macro-
phages, and in (ii) the enhancement of pro-inflammatory responses 
by sensitizing macrophages to metabolic-stress signals.
Epigenome alterations in GPS2-deficient macrophages
To define the chromatin occupancy (cistrome) of GPS2 in relation 
to the chromatin landscape (epigenome), we performed chromatin-
immunoprecipitation-coupled genomic sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the 
BMDMs of WT versus MKO mice. Analysis of the genomic distribu-
tion of tag counts (peaks) revealed that approximately 50% of the 
GPS2-binding sites mapped to promoters (proximal to the transcrip-
tion start site, TSS) and enhancers (intergenic regions, distal to the 
TSS) (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Comparative analysis 
of the cistrome and the transcriptome in WT and MKO macrophages 
revealed GPS2 peaks at the promoters and enhancers of signature 
genes (Fig. 3c). We further uncovered that quantitative changes of 
H3K27ac (marking active enhancers and promoters34) were positively 
correlated with transcriptome regulation by GPS2 (Fig. 3d); this is 
indicative of transcriptional derepression or activation. For exam-
ple, in GPS2-deficient macrophages, H3K27 acetylation was higher 
at the promoter (P) and enhancers (E) of the GPS2-sensitive Ccl2 
gene locus, as validated by ChIP–RT–qPCR (Fig. 3e–h). By contrast, 
at the GPS2-resistant Tnf locus, H3K27 acetylation was not higher, 
 
which is consistent with no effect of GPS2 removal on Tnf expression

(Fig. 3c,f–h). Related changes were observed for the promoter- 
specific H3K4me3 mark (Fig. 3e–g).
To investigate whether GPS2 co-localizes with the co-repres-
sor complex, we compared the cistrome characteristics of GPS2 
to those previously reported for NCOR, SMRT and HDAC3 in 
BMDMs26,35. The analysis revealed an extensive overlap at the pro-
moters and enhancers, with 6,867 sites to be co-occupied by all three 
subunits (Supplementary Fig. 3d), as exemplified by the Ccl2 locus 
(Supplementary Fig. 3e). We confirmed results by ChIP–RT–qPCR 
and further demonstrated that LPS activation induced the release of 
all subunits from distinct promoter and enhancer regions controlling 
Ccl2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 3f).
We next tested the functional requirement of each core subunit for 
Ccl2 expression in RAW cells, and we found that shRNA-mediated 
depletion of SMRT or GPS2 enhanced LPS responses, as compared 
to shGFP control cells, whereas NCOR depletion had the opposite 
effect (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Moreover, GPS2 recruitment to the 
Ccl2 promoter and enhancers was abolished upon the depletion of 
SMRT but not that of NCOR (Fig. 3i). To further test the relationship 
of GPS2 to SMRT or NCOR in repressing inflammatory gene expres-
sion, we depleted SMRT or NCOR in WT versus GPS2-deficient RAW 
cells generated with the clustered regularly interspaced short palin-
dromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 system (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). 
 
We observed that NCOR depletion (as compared to shGFP treatment) 
 
partially repressed Ccl2 elevation in Gps2 KO cells, whereas SMRT 
depletion did not further increase the elevated Ccl2 expression 
in Gps2 KO cells, in both basal and LPS-stimulated conditions 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). This phenotype was confirmed in TEPMs 
from WT and MKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c).
The above data indicated that GPS2 is functionally linked to SMRT 
but not to NCOR, an implication that is consistent with the opposite 
 
inflammatory phenotypes of GPS2 and NCOR-deficient macro-
phages33. Because the anti-inflammatory Ncor1 KO phenotype was 
attributed to the derepression of liver X–receptor (LXR, encoded by 
Nr1h2 and Nr1h3)-regulated genes (including Abca1, Scd1, Scd2, 
Fasn, Fads2, and Elovl5) linked to omega-3 fatty acid synthesis33, 
we investigated whether these genes were regulated in GPS2-defi-
cient macrophages. In Gps2 MKO mice, as compared to WT mice, 
none of the genes had elevated expression in either basal TEPMs or 
LXR agonist (GW3965)-treated TEPMs (Supplementary Fig. 4d). 
Similarly, the expression of these genes remained unchanged after 
GPS2 or SMRT depletion in RAW cells, as compared to shGFP treat-
ment, whereas NCOR depletion induced the expression of Abca1 
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). Notably, the different functions of the 
complex subunits were not due to differential chromatin recruit-
ment, given that all subunits were present at the Abca1 enhancer and 
promoter, here also co-localized with LXR (Supplementary Fig. 4f).

were not changed at the Abca1 promoter and enhancers in MKO, as 
opposed to WT, BMDMs.
To further dissect the role of possible GPS2 subcomplexes, we 
investigated the relationship of GPS2 to HDAC3, the major histone 
deacetylase of the complex that directly associates with NCOR and 
SMRT23. Although HDAC3 protein levels were not altered in Gps2 
MKO BMDMs, as compared to WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a), 
deacetylase activity was slightly reduced in GPS2-deficient BMDMs 
and in GPS2-depleted RAW cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b). For 
comparison, NCOR depletion strongly reduced HDAC3 activity by 
more than 70%, whereas SMRT depletion had no effects. These data 
suggested that NCOR, but not SMRT, is required as an activating 
co-factor for HDAC3 in macrophages, which is consistent with the 
overlapping anti-inflammatory phenotypes of the respective macro-
phage-specific KO mice33,35,36 and with independent evidence from 
liver37. Because the data also suggested that GPS2 partly cooperates 
with HDAC3 in macrophages, we compared published Hdac3 KO 
transcriptome signatures from BMDMs35,36 to the Gps2 MKO signa-
ture, and we identified a number of common, upregulated genes in 
the respective KO mice, as compared to WT mice (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 5c). We more closely investigated Ptgs1, a major HDAC3 target 
 
gene36 that may be regulated by nuclear receptors but not by LPS-
induced TLR4 activation. Indeed, GPS2 co-occupied a Ptgs1 
enhancer, as did NCOR, SMRT and HDAC3, and the knockdown of 
GPS2, NCOR, SMRT or HDAC3 in RAW cells caused a comparable 
upregulation of Ptgs1 expression, as compared to shGFP-treated cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 5d), which suggests that all of these subunits 
are functionally required for the repression of Ptgs1.
We conclude from these data that GPS2 mainly cooperates with 
SMRT to repress pro-inflammatory gene expression, whereas NCOR 
repression of LXR-regulated metabolic gene expression, linked to 
anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acid synthesis, is independent of 
GPS2 and SMRT.
AP-1 (c-Jun) is a direct target of GPS2
Given that GPS2 is found at most enhancers of regulated genes, it is likely 
to cooperate with numerous TFs to regulate macrophage inflammation. 
To identify candidates, we explored the GPS2–TF network using dif-
ferent approaches. De novo motif analysis (Fig. 4a and Supplementary 
Fig. 5e) predicted that GPS2-bound genomic regions were specifically 
enriched for motifs recognized by lineage-specifying TFs, such as PU.1 
and C/EBPs, consistent with the role of these factors in establishing 
macrophage-specific enhancers15. Among the motifs recognized by pro-
inflammatory-signal-regulated TFs, the AP-1 and IRF motifs were most 
abundantly found in GPS2-bound regions. This suggests that GPS2 
represses pro-inflammatory gene expression in part by targeting these 
factors. By contrast, NF-κB motifs and nuclear receptor half-site motifs 
were only poorly enriched at GPS2-bound regions.
To confirm the cistromic data, we immunoprecipitated GPS2 from 
nuclear extracts of WT and MKO BMDMs and subjected the pre-
cipitated protein–DNA complexes to an in vitro TF-interaction assay 
 
(Fig. 4b), thereby identifying AP-1 factors as the most abundant 
interaction partners of GPS2, relative to other factors identified 
from the motif analysis (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 5e). We 
then co-transfected HEK293 cells with HA-GPS2 and a representa-
tive collection of Flag-tagged TFs, and after immunoprecipitating the

cellular extracts with a Flag antibody, we identified the JUN proto-
oncogene c-Jun as a strong GPS2-interacting partner (Fig. 4c and 
Supplementary Fig. 5f). Whereas interactions with other TFs that 
we tested were comparatively weak or absent (Fig. 4c), GPS2 inter-
acted strongly with the pioneer factor PU.1. Notably, the GPS2 and 
c-Jun binding sites38 overlap extensively at the genome-wide level 
(Fig. 4d) and co-occupy enhancers at the Ccl2 locus (Fig. 4d). The 
particular requirement of c-Jun for GPS2-dependent Ccl2 repres-
sion was confirmed upon RNAi depletion in WT and MKO TEPMs 
(Supplementary Fig. 5g). Complementarily, we depleted or overex-
pressed GPS2 in BMDMs from macrophage-specific Jun KO mice and 
analyzed Ccl2 expression in response to LPS or palmitate treatment 
(Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig. 5h,i). Under both treatment condi-
tions, GPS2-depletion-induced Ccl2 elevation was attenuated in Jun 
KO BMDMs, as compared to WT BMDMs (Fig. 4e). Overexpression 
of GPS2 in Jun KO BMDMs, however, failed to inhibit LPS and palmi-
tate responses above the level of inhibition seen in WT BMDMs 
 
(Fig. 4f). Related data from TEPMs further confirmed these findings 
(Supplementary Fig. 5h,i).
Collectively, these data identify the c-Jun component of AP-1 as a 
candidate GPS2 target for the repression of Ccl2 transcription.
GPS2-deficiency promotes obesity-linked insulin resistance
To further dissect the relationship between the inappropriate expres-
sion of GPS2 in macrophages, AT dysfunction, inflammation, and 
insulin resistance, we subjected WT mice and MKO mice to 60% 
high-fat diet (HFD) versus LFD feeding for up to 12 weeks (Fig. 5a 
and Supplementary Fig. 6a). During the course of a 12-week HFD-
feeding period, Gps2 mRNA expression levels decreased gradually in 
the F4/80+ ATM fraction from epiWAT of WT mice (Supplementary 
Fig. 6a). In a manner consistent with the human data, GPS2 dys-
regulation in mouse AT was correlated with CD11c+ macrophage 
infiltration and Ccl2 expression (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Although 
the removal of GPS2 from macrophages did not change body-weight 
gain (Fig. 5b), macrophage infiltration was enhanced in the epiWAT 
of MKO mice relative to that of WT mice (Fig. 5c,d). Specifically, the 
elevation of the F4/80+CD11b+ ATM fraction in MKO mice was due 
to higher numbers of both CD11c+ and CD206+ pro-inflammatory 
macrophages than that in WT mice (Fig. 5d). Transcriptome profiling 
of epiWAT ATMs, followed by pathway analysis, confirmed that GPS2 
removal provoked an enhanced pro-inflammatory response after 12 
weeks of HFD feeding, which was verified by RT–qPCR (Fig. 5e and 
Supplementary Fig. 6c).

versus WT mice (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 6d,e). Consistently 
with the fact that visceral fat depots are often more inflamed than 
subcutaneous depots, the elevated pro-inflammatory signature in 
GPS2-deficient epiWAT was already evident after 4 weeks of HFD 
feeding. The ATM-derived inflammatory transcriptome alterations 
in MKO versus WT mice resulted in systemically elevated levels of 
the encoded gene products CCL2, IL-6 and TNF-α after HFD feed-
ing (Fig. 5g). Probably as a consequence of the inflammatory altera-
tions, AT properties were changed in MKO mice, as indicated by 
smaller adipocyte size (Supplementary Fig. 6f), higher expression of 
fibro-inflammatory and lipolytic genes (Supplementary Fig. 6g), and 
higher basal lipolytic activity—indicated by more glycerol release from 
AT (Supplementary Fig. 6h)—than those in WT mice. Consistently 
with the AT lipolysis change, MKO mice also had elevated circulating 
 
nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFA) levels (Supplementary Fig. 6h). 
 
Correspondingly, liver weight and intrahepatic triglyceride (TG) 
content was higher in MKO mice than in WT mice, indicating wors-
ening of the HFD-induced steatosis in MKO mice (Fig. 5h). These 
metabolic changes were accompanied by substantially elevated mac-
rophage infiltration (Supplementary Fig. 6i) and expression of pro-
inflammatory genes, including Ccl2 (Supplementary Fig. 6j), in the 
livers of MKO, as compared to WT, mice after HFD feeding.
Given that inflammatory alterations may trigger insulin resist-
ance, we further investigated glucose homeostasis in MKO versus 
WT mice (Fig. 5i). We observed that both fasting and feeding blood-
glucose levels were elevated in MKO mice, in conjunction with higher 
serum insulin levels. Analysis of the homeostatic model assessment of 
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, an oral glucose-tolerance test 
(OGTT), and an insulin-tolerance test (ITT) all supported the pro-
gression of MKO mice to a state of greater insulin resistance, relative 
to WT mice, after 12 weeks of HFD feeding (Fig. 5i). Elevated insulin 
resistance as a consequence of GPS2 dysfunction was confirmed at

the intracellular level, given that AKT phosphorylation, a readout 
of intracellular insulin signaling, in epiWAT, muscle, and liver was 
reduced after in vivo insulin stimulation in MKO mice, as compared 
to WT mice (Fig. 5j).
Taken together, the results suggest that macrophage GPS2 has a 
crucial role in controlling metaflammatory responses and its conse-
quences in the AT, as well as in controlling systemic responses that 
originate from AT under conditions of diet-induced obesity.
GPS2 overexpression improves glucose homeostasis in obese mice
To test the anti-inflammatory and potentially anti-diabetic function 
of GPS2 in vivo, we transplanted bone marrow cells overexpress-
ing GFP, or Flag-tagged human GPS2, into freshly irradiated WT 
C57BL/6 or leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob). At 5 weeks after BMT, ob/ob 
mice were euthanized for analysis, whereas WT mice were fed with 
a HFD for 10 weeks (as outlined in Fig. 6a). A modest overexpres-
sion of GPS2 was confirmed in F4/80+ macrophages in the epiWAT 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a,b) and in the livers of mice that received 
transplants (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Expression analysis of epiWAT 
and F4/80+ ATMs from epiWAT revealed that Ccl2, Ccl7, Il1b, and Il6 
mRNA levels in both GPS2 overexpression models were lower than 
those in the recipient mice transplanted with GFP-expressing bone 
marrow cells (Fig. 6b,c). A similar expression pattern was observed in 
the ingWAT (Supplementary Fig. 7d,e). This lower epiWAT inflam-
mation was characterized by a lower ATM number in both models 
(Fig. 6d,e). Of note, less inflammation was observed in the livers of 
mice overexpressing GPS2 (Supplementary Fig. 7f–h), which accu-
mulated fewer macrophages and lipids than did GFP control mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 7f,i,j). Mice with obesity that overexpressed 
GPS2, as compared to control mice expressing GFP, displayed no 
evident change in their blood-glucose levels, whereas insulin levels 
were significantly (P < 0.001) changed; this, along with the HOMA-IR 
score, OGTT, and ITT, suggests that they were more insulin sensitive 
and glucose tolerant (Fig. 6f–i).
In sum, these experiments suggest that increasing GPS2 levels in 
macrophages can counteract obesity-linked metabolic inflammation 
of AT, thereby helping to maintain systemic insulin sensitivity and 
prevent ectopic lipid partitioning in the liver (steatosis).
Loss of adipocyte GPS2 contributes to insulin resistance
Given previous evidence that GPS2 controls, in part, related pro-
inflammatory pathways in human adipocytes30 and in the mouse 
3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line39, we wanted to compare the relative con-
tributions of macrophage GPS2 and adipocyte GPS2 to the above-
described AT alterations. We generated adipocyte-specific KO 
mice (referred to as AKO) by crossing the floxed GPS2 mice with 
mice expressing Cre under the control of adiponectin promoter 
 
(Adipoq-Cre). Gps2 mRNA and protein expression were signifi-
cantly (P < 0.001) decreased in isolated adipocytes of epiWAT in 
AKO mice, compared to those in WT littermates, whereas Ncor1, 
Ncor2, and Hdac3 were not altered (Supplementary Fig. 8a). WT 
and AKO mice were then subjected to a HFD for 12 weeks. Body 
weight remained unchanged, despite a slightly greater epiWAT and 
ingWAT mass in AKO versus WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 8b,c). 
Histological analyses of the epiWAT and ingWAT revealed significantly 
 
(P < 0.001) enlarged average adipocyte size in AKO mice, relative to 
that in WT mice, after 12 weeks of HFD feeding (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 8d,e), a difference probably driven by a higher partition of large 
adipocytes (>100 µm) and a decrease of smaller adipocytes (<100 µm) 
 
in AKO mice.
Gene-expression analysis of isolated adipocytes from the epiWAT 
of WT and AKO mice revealed higher expression of Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl7, 
and Il6 in AKO mice, whereas Tnf was not changed (Supplementary 
Fig. 8f). A similar signature was observed in the epiWAT and ingWAT 
of AKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 8f). Consistently with the gene-
expression changes, systemic CCL2 protein concentration was higher 
in the serum of AKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 8g). Furthermore, 
macrophage infiltration, including that of CD11c+ and CD206+ mac-
rophages, was greater in the epiWAT of AKO mice after HFD feeding 
than in that of WT mice fed the same diet (Supplementary Fig. 8h).
Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was substantially lower in AKO 
mice, which supports a local impairment of insulin sensitivity in 
AKO mice, relative to that in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 8i). 
Fasting blood-glucose levels were elevated in AKO mice, whereas 
serum insulin levels showed no difference. Accordingly, the HOMA-
IR index revealed that the AKO mice were more insulin resistant than 
were WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 8j). Lastly, an OGTT showed 
that AKO mice were less glucose tolerant than WT mice, whereas 
the ITT did not reveal significant changes (Supplementary Fig. 8j). 
 
This indicated that the local AT insulin resistance observed in AKO 
mice had no major influence on systemic insulin sensitivity, within 
the limits of 12 weeks on a HFD.
In conclusion, the AKO data support the anti-inflammatory 
 
function of GPS2 in adipocytes, which directly influences AT insulin 
sensitivity, but also reveal some intriguing differences related to AT 
properties, lipid metabolism, and systemic insulin resistance between 
the respective AKO and MKO models.
DISCUSSION
Our study identifies the co-repressor GPS2 as an epigenomic com-
ponent of metabolic macrophage activation in the context of obesity 
and T2D. The analysis of two novel macrophage-specific versus adi-
pocyte-specific Gps2 KO mouse models, along with the study of human 
subjects with obesity and diabetes, suggests that the depletion or reduc-
tion of GPS2 promotes a pro-inflammatory gene-activation signature 
and sensitizes the responses of macrophages, including ATMs, toward 
metabolic signals. We additionally demonstrate that the overexpression 
of GPS2 in bone marrow cells of mice with obesity can improve insulin 
sensitivity and reduce inflammation, which might be of therapeutic 
significance. Overall, our findings point to a causal, and potentially 
reversible, relationship between inappropriate GPS2 expression and 
function, the extent of tissue inflammation, and systemic insulin resist-
ance. The underlying mechanisms seem to be conserved between mice 
and humans, and they exemplify how the epigenome alterations in 
macrophages can shape the metabolic-disease environment during 
progression toward T2D (see our model in Fig. 6j).
Given the mouse and human conservation of the identified GPS2 
pathways, our study helps to better interpret the role of epigenetic 
mechanisms in human metabolic health and disease. For example, 
although obesity is commonly associated with risk factors for cardio-
vascular disease, including insulin resistance and T2D, some subjects 
with obesity who have a similar BMI do not develop metabolic and 
inflammatory abnormalities40. There are probably several molecu-
lar reasons that are responsible for such individual differences, but 
some could be related to epigenomic mechanisms, described here for 
macrophages and in other studies for adipocytes30,31,39,41. Indeed, 
our HFD-fed Gps2 MKO mice develop metabolic alterations (fatty 
liver, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance) more rapidly than 
WT mice, whereas no weight difference is observed. This phenotype 
is intriguingly comparable to the human situation of metabolically

healthy versus unhealthy subjects with obesity. Although immune 
cells, including macrophages, are ultimately linked to the pathologi-
cal alterations of AT during the manifestation of the inflamed obesity 
status, it is less clear how they maintain a pro-inflammatory status 
during the continued progression of obesity and diabetes. Closely 
linked epigenomic and transcriptional alterations have been proposed 
to have roles in the establishment of a ‘metabolic memory’ in AT, 
particularly in adipocytes42. Our findings point to a related ‘inflam-
matory memory’ in macrophages; decreased GPS2 expression in AT 
and ATMs in humans with obesity and diabetes therefore limits its 
anti-inflammatory capacity as disease progresses.
Our study uncovers a hitherto unrecognized epigenomic feature 
of co-repressors during the signal-dependent transcriptional activa-
tion linked to metaflammation. Comparative analysis of the GPS2 
cistrome, epigenome and transcriptome revealed that GPS2 occu-
pies H3K27ac-marked enhancers at regulated genes, which undergo 
epigenomic changes upon GPS2 removal. Derepression is not the 
only consequence of a loss of GPS2; the responses to acute (LPS) and 
 
metabolic (palmitate, HFD) signals were further enhanced. This is 
compatible with recent findings demonstrating that an increase in 
H3K27ac at enhancers opens the entrance for incoming TFs upon 
signaling43. Intriguingly, an epigenomic memory mechanism would 
explain how alterations in GPS2 levels modulate the activity of inducible 
 
inflammatory TFs, even in the absence of physical interactions 
between GPS2 and these TFs. Overall, the epigenomic and signal-
sensitizing functions of GPS2 in macrophages complement and go 
beyond the anti-inflammatory actions of GPS2 in hepatocytes29 and 
in adipocytes described previously31,39,42. We therefore propose that 
obesity-mediated, GPS2-dependent epigenomic changes in human 
macrophages, including ATMs, establish an epigenomic memory that 
accelerates inflammatory responses to metabolic signals.
Our work helps to clarify the functions of other co-repressor 
complex subunits in vivo in relation to GPS2. Gps2 MKO mice are 
a relevant disease model for metaflammation, characterized by hall-
marks that include (i) chronic elevated low-level inflammation under 
basic- or chow-diet conditions; (ii) accelerated AT inflammation and 
macrophage infiltration; and (iii) the development of systemic insu-
lin resistance under diet-induced obesity conditions14. Therefore, 
the main function of GPS2 in macrophages is to act as an anti- 
inflammatory co-repressor, which seems in sharp contrast to the 
reported pro-inflammatory roles of NCOR and HDAC3 in vivo.
Macrophage-specific Ncor1 KO mice display an anti-inflamma-
tory phenotype with reduced AT inflammation and improved insulin 
 
sensitivity upon HFD feeding, probably due to the derepression 
of LXR pathways linked to the synthesis of omega-3 fatty acids33. 
Closer investigation in our MKO model and in RAW cells indicated 
that GPS2 has no major role in the repression of these pathways in 
macrophages, and that it provides possible alternative mechanisms. 
Although the comparative depletion of GPS2, SMRT and NCOR in 
RAW cells confirmed the opposing roles of GPS2 and SMRT relative 
 
to NCOR in controlling inflammatory transcription, among the LXR 
target genes, only Abca1 was upregulated upon NCOR depletion. 
Additionally, the removal of GPS2 or SMRT had no effect on any of 
the tested LXR target genes. This points to a unique role of ABCA1 
in inflammation control, as recently suggested44, or at an intrinsic 
pro-inflammatory role of NCOR, as previously noted in mouse 
 
and human adipocytes30,32.
It is also possible that the pro-inflammatory role of NCOR in mac-
rophages is directly linked to HDAC3: macrophage-specific Hdac3 
KO mice35,36 display a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized 
by decreased M1 (LPS/TLR4) and increased M2 (IL4) responses. 
Our analysis further revealed that NCOR, but not SMRT, is required 
for HDAC3 activity, consistently with the overlapping KO pheno-
types. Notably, that SMRT cannot substitute for NCOR in acting as a 
cofactor for HDAC3 and in targeting specific TFs and enhancers has 
been earlier observed in liver37 , and contrasts with the seemingly 
 
redundant function of these two related co-repressors in vitro. 
Similarly, the in vivo preference of GPS2 for SMRT over NCOR has 
not been obvious from studies in vitro24,25, and thus is likely to involve 
additional interaction surfaces, post-translational modifications45 or 
cellular cofactors. Overall, these data explain why two core subu-
nits of the ‘same’ co-repressor complex—GPS2 versus NCOR—have 
opposite inflammatory KO phenotypes in macrophages. Our findings 
provide a conceptual framework proposing the functional (but not 
necessarily biochemical or genomic) separation of ‘the co-repressor 
complex’ into at least two sub-complexes with opposing activities 
in macrophages, one acting as an anti-inflammatory (GPS2–SMRT) 
and one as a pro-inflammatory (NCOR–HDAC3). This may offer 
pharmacological opportunities for the selective modulation of GPS2-
dependent inflammatory pathways that avoids interfering with the 
metabolic-anti-inflammatory axis governed by NCOR–HDAC3.
By demonstrating the particular relationship of GPS2 to c-Jun (AP-1), 
 
our work provides additional clues for how the co-repressor complex 
functionally interacts with TFs. De novo prediction revealed AP-1 
motifs to be the most frequent at GPS2-occupied enhancers; GPS2-
associated AP-1 binding sites were enriched from macrophage nuclear 
extracts; knockdown experiments proved that c-Jun was required for 
Ccl2 repression by GPS2; and c-Jun strongly interacted with GPS2 
in co-immunoprecipitations. Earlier work had elucidated in detail 
the essential role of c-Jun in TLR4 signaling46 and Ccl2 regulation47. 
c-Jun is further suggested to interact with HDAC3 (ref. 48), SMRT 
and NCOR27,49,50, suggesting cooperative interactions with various 
subunits of the co-repressor complex, all of which may contribute 
to the function of SMRT and NCOR in repressing AP-1-dependent 
inflammatory-gene expression.
The above considerations help to explain why GPS2, along with 
the entire co-repressor complex, is also found at the enhancers of 
genes whose transcription is apparently not affected by the removal 
of GPS2. In line with the emerging concept of enhancer hot spots51,52, 
the presence of the GPS2 co-repressor complex, along with other 
 
co-regulators and multiple TFs, at key inflammatory enhancers 
before activation ensures fast and reversible transcriptional responses 
to different signaling inputs triggered by different metabolic and 
 
inflammatory alterations. Given that such alterations are typically 
associated with T2D, it is of therapeutic interest that GPS2 is one of 
the first examples of an epigenomic modifier whose expression and 
function in macrophages is influenced by the metaflammatory disease 
status itself. This suggests therapeutic possibilities for delaying or 
even reversing metaflammation-linked T2D through the restoration 
 
of GPS2 expression and its function within co-repressor sub- 
complexes by, for example, administering epigenomic drugs or by the 
pharmacological modulation of the c-Jun–GPS2–SMRT interface.

ONLINE METHODS
Human tissue samples. AT biopsies were obtained from different subject 
cohorts admitted to the Labriboisière, Pitié-salepetrière and Geoffroy Saint-
Hilaire hospitals (Paris, France), as detailed in Supplementary Table 1. The 
study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was 
registered in a public trial registry (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02368704 and 
NCT01655017). The Ethics Committee of CPP Ile-de-France approved the 
clinical investigations for all individuals, and written informed consent was 
obtained from all individuals. SAT and VAT samples from lean subjects were 
obtained after local surgery, and VAT from subjects with obesity was obtained 
after bariatric surgery. P1 consisted of CD14+ cells from SVF from the VAT 
of individuals with and without obesity. P2 consisted of CD14+ cells obtained 
from SVF from the VAT of individuals with obesity but no diabetes and the 
VAT of individuals with obesity and diabetes. P3 comprised SAT tissue from 
individuals with obesity and diabetes or with diabetes but without obesity. 
The clinical and anthropometric variables that were measured are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1, including sex, age, BMI (kg/m2), total cholesterol 
(mmol/l), triglycerides (mmol/l), and HbA1c (in %).
CD14+ SVF cells containing ATMs were isolated, as previously described4. 
Subcutaneous and visceral (omental) AT from human subjects with and without 
obesity were digested using collagenase (Roche) and SVF cells were resuspended 
in endotoxin-free Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) supplemented 
with 2% FCS (FCS) and 1 mM EDTA. CD14+ SVF cells were purified using 
magnetic beads (STEMCELL Technologies, 18058), according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium 
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS or immediately used for 
total RNA or protein extraction.
To obtain HMDMs, blood samples were received from healthy volunteer 
donors (Etablissement Français du Sang, Pitiè-salpêtrière Hospital). Human 
peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) were isolated from enriched 
buffy coats by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and purified using the 
Monocyte Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-153). PBMCs were differ-
entiated into HMDMs in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium 
supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 ng/ml of macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (M-CSF) (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-096-493) for 6 d.
RT–qPCR analysis. RNA was extracted from tissues or purified cells using the 
RNeasy RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen). Complementary DNAs were synthesized 
using Superscript II reverse-transcriptase kit (Life Technologies). RT–qPCR was 
performed using the ABI Prism 7000 PCR system (Applied Biosystems). 18S and 
36B4 (gene encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0, also called RPLP0) 
were used for normalization to quantify relative mRNA expression levels. 
 
Relative changes in mRNA expression were calculated using the comparative 
cycle method (2−∆∆Ct). Primers are listed in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.
Western blot analysis. Samples were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with 
protease and phosphatase inhibitors and were diluted to a concentration of 
20 µg of protein and heated at 98 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated by 
SDS–PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham 
International). Blocking reagent (PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 and 3% of bovine 
serum albumin, pH 7.4, or SuperBlock (PBS) Blocking Buffer, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) were incubated for 1 h, and primary antibody was incubated over-
night at 4 °C in the blocking solution. The antibodies and their concentrations 
are the following: anti-GPS2 (ref. 29; 1:1,000), anti-β-actin (Abcam, ab8226; 
1:30,000), anti-HDAC3 (Santa-Cruz, sc-11417; 1:1,000), anti-phospho-AKT 
(Cell signaling, 9331S; 1:1,000), anti-AKT (Cell signaling, 9272S; 1:1,000) and 
anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, F3165; 1:5,000). After several washes in PBS with 
0.5% Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibodies 
(1:5,000) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the blocking solution. 
Membranes were incubated with ECL western-blotting substrate (Pierce, 32106) 
and imaged by myECL Imager (ThermoFisher, 62236). Blots were semi-quanti-
fied using ImageJ software.
Transient transfection, RNAi, and adenoviral infection. We used human GPS2 
siRNAs, as described previously29, and mouse GPS2 (M-063123, Dharmacon), 
c-Jun (L-043776, Dharmacon), and Rel A (P65) (L-040776, Dharmacon) siRNAs 
 
in our experiments. Luciferase siRNA (TGACAGAGCCAAACAAATG) was 
used as a negative control. 100 nM siRNAs, along with Lipofectamine 2000 
(Life Technologies), were used for the transfection of both human and mouse 
macrophages. For the adenovirus experiments, the ectopic GPS2-overexpressing 
adenovirus was as described previously30.
Human and mouse gene-expression microarray analysis. Briefly, total RNA 
from HMDMs transfected with control or GPS2 siRNA for 40 h, WT and MKO 
BMDMs in basal conditions (n = 3 per group), WT and MKO TEPMs treated 
with or without 10 ng/ml LPS for 6 h (n = 3 per group), and HFD-fed WT and 
MKO AT SVF F4/80+ cells (n = 4 per group) were extracted using RNA miniprep 
kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 250 ng of HMDM 
RNA, 50 ng of BMDM RNA, 50 ng of TEPM RNA, and 100 ng of SVF F4/80+ 
cells RNA were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to obtain 
biotin-labeled cDNAs.
HMDMs. Illumina Human HT-12 v3.0 Expression BeadChips (contain-
ing 48,000 annotated probes for 28,688 coded transcripts) was used. BMDMs. 
Affymetrix mouse gene 1.1 ST plate (with 24,582 well-established annotations) 
was used. RNA samples from replicates were subjected to analysis. The target 
synthesis and hybridization were performed at the Bioinformatics and Expression 
Analysis core facility (BEA, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden), according 
to the standardized protocol.
TEPMs and SVF F4/80+cells. Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips 
(containing 25,600 annotated probes for 19,100 coded transcripts) was used.
To obtain the biotin-labeled cDNAs of all the samples for the Illumina 
microarrays, the Illumina RNA amplification kit (NuGEN, BiotinIL, Module) 
was used. BeadChips were read with an iScan Illumina scanner. Hybridization 
probe intensities were then detected using GenomeStudio. The q value is the 
adjusted P value for multiple testing using an optimized false-discovery rate 
(FDR) approach (as defined by J.D. Storey’s method). The q value was provided 
by SAMr package under R statistical software. The differentially expressed genes 
were further annotated using WebGestalt with biological annotations from Gene 
Ontology and KEGG databases.
For the BMDMs and TEPMs, raw-intensity expression files (CEL files) were 
imported to R and Bioconductor using the Oligo53 package. The same pack-
age was used for quantile normalization, background correction, and summa-
rization by robust multichip average preprocessing (RMA). The normalized 
 
log2-transformed expression values were then imported to the Limma54 pack-
age for differential-expression analysis by linear modeling. A paired design was 
used to remove the batch effect between the biological replicates. Furthermore, 
genes with low expression (less than the 95th quantile of the negative-con-
trol probes on the Affymetrix chip) were removed. Genes with a P value of 
<0.05, after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing using the FDR method, 
were defined as being differentially expressed. Hierarchical clustering of the 
gene expression in WT and MKO mice, was performed in R with the Hclust 
function using the ward.D2 method, and visualized employing the ggplot2 
package55. Prior to hierarchical clustering, genes were standardized across the 
samples to a mean of zero and an s.d. of 1; z values were then used for clus-
tering. Limma was also used for the analysis of the microarray data from the 
 
peritoneal macrophages.
Mice. Gps2flox/flox mice were generated at Ozgene Pty, Ltd. (Bentley DC, 
Australia) using a targeting construct, which contained loxP sites flanking exons 
2 and 5, followed by a FRT site and a neomycin cassette inserted between exons 
 
5 and 6. The targeting vector was electroporated into C57BL/6 Bruce4 embry-
onic stem (ES) cells. The correctly recombined ES colony was then injected into 
C57BL/6 blastocysts. Male chimeras were mated with female C57BL/6 mice to 
get mice with a targeted Gps2 allele. The mice were crossbred with C57BL/6 
flp-recombinase mice to remove the neomycin cassette to create heterozygous 
Gps2flox/+ mice. The mice were then crossbred with C57BL/6 mice for nine 
generations before being bred with heterozygous Gps2flox/+ mice to get the 
Gps2flox/flox mice.
To generate myeloid-specific or adipocyte-specific Gps2 KO mice, Gps2flox/flox 
mice were crossed with LysM-Cre mice (B6.129P2-Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo/J; Jackson 
Laboratory stock no. 04781) or adiponectin-Cre mice (B6;FVB-Tg(Adipoq-Cre) 
1Evdr/J; Jackson Laboratory stock no. 010803), respectively. KO mice were

bred for at least nine generations before the experiments were started. Lys2- 
Cre-Gps2flox/flox or Adipoq-Cre-Gps2flox/flox littermates were used as control.
Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory 
 
(B6.Cg-Lepob/J; stock no. 000632).
To produce the myeloid-specific Jun KO mice, Junflox/flox mice56 were crossed 
with Csf1r-Cre mice (Csf1rMer-iCre-Mer, B6;FVB-Tg(Csf1rMer-iCre-Mer)1Jwp) 
(Jackson Laboratory stock no. 019098)57,58. KO mice were bred for at least nine 
generations before the experiments were started. Junflox/flox mice were used 
 
as controls.
All mice used in the studies were male, between 7–16 weeks old at the time 
of the experiment starting point, and randomized before any experiment was 
started. All animal experiments were approved by the respective national ethi-
cal boards (Swedish Board of Agriculture, Stockholm South, S28-12, S30-14, 
S135-12, S29-14; Paris-Sorbonne University, Charles Darwin N°5, 01026.02) 
and conducted in accordance with the guidelines stated in the International 
Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, developed by 
the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). 
 
All mice strains were bred and maintained at the Center for Comparative 
Medicine at Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital (AKM, PKL, 
Huddinge, Sweden) and at the “Centre exploration fonctionnel (CEF)” at Paris 
University (UPMC, 91 and 105 boulevard de l’hôpital Paris 13).
Macrophage cultures and treatments. To isolate BMDMs59, 12–16-week-
old male mice (WT, MKO) were euthanized, and their femurs and tibias 
were collected. Bone marrow cells were cultured and differentiated for 7 d, 
in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (FBS), 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and 30% L929 conditioned-media (containing 
M-CSF). To isolate TEPMs60, 12–16-week-old male mice (WT, KO) were i.p. 
injected with 3 ml 3% thioglycollate (Sigma-Aldrich, 70157) and euthanized 4 d 
 
later. Macrophages were collected from the peritoneal lavage using DMEM sup-
plemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% P/S and cultured for 24 h 
 
before treatment. To isolate ATMs, epididymal AT was digested using colla-
genase (Roche), and the resulting SVF cells were stained with F4/80 antibody 
(BM8; eBioscience, 25-4801-82)4. F4/80+ ATMs were sorted using a high-
speed flow cytometer cell sorter (FACSAria) and used immediately for gene-
expression analysis. The mouse RAW264.7 cell line (ATCC stock no. TIB-71) 
was cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated 
 
FBS and 1% P/S.
Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LPS (10 × 108 cells/ml) for 6 h for gene-
expression analysis, or with 100 ng/ml LPS for 30 min for ChIP assays. For 
palmitate treatment, sodium palmitate (Sigma-Aldrich, P9075) was dissolved in 
18.4% fatty acid–free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A0281) at 8 mM as a stock solution. 
 
Cells were incubated with 0.4 mM palmitate or BSA as a control in 1% FBS sup-
plemented DMEM for 24 h. Cells were treated with the LXR agonist GW3965 
at a concentration of 2 µM for 24 h. Cells were tested for mycoplasma (Lonza, 
LT07-118) at the onset of the study and exhibited no signs of contamination.
Virus-mediated RNAi knockdown and overexpression. Adenoviruses expressing 
luciferase control shRNA (targeting sequence: TGACAGAGCCAAACAAATG) 
or GPS2 shRNA (targeting sequence: CAGTACCCTCTCTTTGCAGAA) were 
constructed and packaged using the Block-it adenoviral RNAi expression system 
(Life Technologies, 4941-00). Cells were infected with 100 MOI adenovirus for 
48 h before undergoing further treatment. Lentivirus-shRNAs were constructed 
for GFP (targeting sequence: GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCA), GPS2 (as for 
adenovirus), NCOR (targeting sequence: CGGCATAATCTTGACAACCTT) 
and SMRT (targeting sequence: CCAGTGTAAGAACTTCTACTT) and pack-
aged in 293FT cells using PLKO.1-TRC (Addgene 10878), psPAX2 (Addgene, 
12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) plasmids. For overexpression, GPS2-Flag 
and GFP lentiviruses were constructed and packaged using viral power lentiviral 
gateway expression system (Life Technologies, K367-20). Viruses were concen-
trated by ultracentrifugation at 18,000g for 2 h, and 5–10 MOI of lentivirus were 
used to transduce cells. Cells stably transduced were selected using puromycin 
(the concentration for the selection was determined previously).
LPS treatment in vivo. 12–16-week-old WT and MKO mice were used for the 
LPS challenge in vivo. The mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with LPS 
(1 mg/kg body weight; n = 4–5 per group). LPS-injected mice were euthanized 
after 16 h, and peritoneal macrophages were collected.
ChIP and ChIP-seq sample preparation. ChIP samples were prepared as 
described elsewhere61, with some minor modifications. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells 
and BMDMs were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde in DPBS for 10 min for 
histone modifications, or double crosslinked with 2 mM disuccinimidyl glutar-
ate (DSG) for 30 min, followed by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, for GPS2. The 
reaction was stopped with glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 M for 5 min. 
Approximately, 10–20 × 106 cells were used for histone marks, 20–30 × 106 cells 
 
for GPS2 ChIP and 60–90 × 106 cells for GPS2 ChIP-seq. Cells were spun down 
and rinsed with cold DPBS two times. Nuclei were isolated using lysis buffer 1 
(50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% 
NP-40 and 0.25% Triton X-100), lysis buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM EGTA), and lysis buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 
and 0.5% N-Lauroylsarcosine), and subsequently sonicated over 30 min (30 s 
 
ON/OFF) in the UCD-200 Bioruptor (Diagenode), to generate DNA-fragment 
sizes of 0.2–0.5 kb. Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were incubated O/N 
with the antibodies. Each lysate was immunoprecipitated with the following 
antibodies: control rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-2027, 1–10 µg), anti-H3K4me3 
(Abcam, ab8580, 1 µg), anti-H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729, 1 µg), anti-NCOR 
(Abcam, ab24552, 4 µg), anti-SMRT (Bethyl laboratories, A301-147A, 4 µg), 
anti-HDAC3 (Abcam, ab7030, 10 µg) and anti-GPS2 (4 µg)29. After several 
washings, the beads were incubated with the sonicated chromatin O/N. On 
the next day, the samples were washed with RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES-
KOH pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.7% Na- 
deoxycholate) six times, once with TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl), 
and the immune-bound chromatin was eluted in the elution buffer (50 mM 
 
Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). The samples remained at 65 °C O/N 
to reverse the formaldehyde crosslinking. After RNAse A (Fermentas) and pro-
teinase K (Fermentas) treatment, the immunoprecipitated DNA was purified 
using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). To prepare the ChIP-seq 
samples, the same ChIP protocol was followed, but using the ChIP DNA Clean & 
 
Concentrator Capped Zymo-Spin I (Zymo Research) purification kit. In the 
case of GPS2, three or four ChIPs were pooled during the final step of the puri-
fication to obtain concentrated material. GPS2 ChIP was established using two 
custom-made GPS2 antibodies, raised against separate N/C-terminal epitopes. 
For library preparation and sequencing, 5–10 ng of ChIPed DNA was processed 
at the EMBL Genomics Core Facility (Heidelberg, Germany) using standard 
protocols, and 50SE reads were obtained in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina). 
Primers for the ChIP–RT–qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
ChIP-seq data analysis. Sequencing files (fastq files), provided by the EMBL 
Genomics Core Facility (Heidelberg, Germany), and raw data from the pub-
lished ChIP-seq data (NCOR and SMRT: GSE27060; HDAC3: GSE33609; 
LXRβ: GSE50944; c-Jun: GSE31796) were aligned to the NCBI37/mm9 version 
of the mouse reference genome, using Bowtie 2. The sequencing tags were then 
read and imported to the HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif 
EnRichment, http://homer.salk.edu/homer) package62. Peaks were identified 
using HOMER with default settings, and peak overlap was calculated by merg-
ing together all individual peak files for every experiment. Peaks needed to have 
at least one base pair of overlap to be merged. The sequences found in GPS2 
peaks were subjected to motif analysis to identify potentially over-represented 
TF-binding sites using Homer. The motifs were searched within a 200-bp win-
dow from the center of the GPS2 peaks. Background sequences were selected as 
approximately 42,000 random 200-bp genomic fragments that matched the CG 
content of the DNA fragments found in our GPS2 target peaks, to avoid compar-
ing sequences of different general sequence content. Binomial scoring was then 
used to determine whether the motif was enriched in the GPS2 peaks, relative 
to the background. The enriched motifs were then compared to known motifs 
to determine the potential factors with which GPS2 might associate. Heat-map 
clustering of the peaks was performed in Cluster 3.0 using self-organizing maps, 
and then visualized in TreeView. For statistical analysis of the peaks, tags were 
counted in all the peaks without any normalization. The raw tag counts were 
then imported in to R and Bioconductor. We used the general linear-model

pipeline of EdgeR to identify potential differential binding sites63,64. We used 
only tags from peaks that were identified at least twice from all the ChIP-seq 
experiments.
Generation of Gps2 KO RAW264.7 cells by CRISPR. The sgRNAs for Gps2 were 
designed on CRISPR gRNA design tool: Design 2.0. The following sequences 
of sgRNAs (sgRNA1: CACCGGCAAACGGCAGGGTGAGCCT and sgRNA2: 
CACCGGATGTGCCGGTGCAGAGCCC) were inserted into PX461 vector65 
(Addgene plasmid 48140) and sorted by FACS. The single-cell colonies were 
validated via sequencing for at least five separate T clones, and were further 
validated by western blot. PX461 empty-vector transfected and sorted single-cell 
clones were used as negative controls.
HDAC3 activity assay. HDAC3 activity was determined using a commercial 
kit (Active Motif, 56200) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 
nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-HDAC3 (Santa Cruz, sc-11417) cou-
pled to protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 
washing buffer and directly incubated with HDAC substrate. HDAC3 activity 
was determined using fluorescence-based measurement.
GPS2-interacting TF array. The GPS2-interacting TF array was performed 
according to the kit manufacturer’s instructions (Signosis, FA-3001). Briefly, 20 µg 
 
of protein sample from WT or MKO BMDM nuclear extracts were incubated 
with a provided oligo mix (containing TF DNA binding-site sequences) for 1 h 
and then incubated with protein A/G magnetic beads with 2 µg GPS2 antibody 
for 1 h at 4 °C. The GPS2-bound oligos were eluted in an elution buffer at 98 °C 
for 10 min and were hybridized in a plate where the corresponding synthetic 
antisense oligos were bound. The bound biotin-labeled oligos were then detected 
with streptavidin-HRP and substrate.
Co-immunoprecipitation of GPS2 and candidate TFs. HEK293 (ATCC, CRL-
1573) cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-HA-GPS2 (WT or 61–94, deletion 
of the interaction site with SMRT and NCOR25) and expression plasmids for 
the indicated Flag-tagged TFs. Flag-tagged SMRT (2–297) served as a positive 
control for comparison. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and the lysate 
was incubated with anti-HA (BioLegend, 901513) or anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, 
F7425) coupled to protein A magnetic beads for 3 h, at 4 °C (previously 15-µl 
beads were incubated with 2 µg of antibody for 2 h, at 4 °C). Beads were washed 
with lysis buffer five times and eluted at 98 °C for 10 min. The eluted sample 
was loaded in an acrylamide gel by following the western blot protocol, and 
blotted with anti-Flag or anti-HA. Whole-cell lysis was used as input. C/EBP 
plasmids were kindly provided by Susanne Mandrup (University of Southern 
Denmark, Denmark), and NF-κB plasmids were gifts from Karolien De Bosscher 
(University of Gent, Belgium. The remaining TF cDNAs were obtained from 
the Karolinska Institutet High Throughput Center (KHTC) and cloned into the 
pcDNA3.1-3XFlag-V5 expression vector.
Metabolic studies in mice. 7–8-week-old WT and MKO mice (n = 5–7 per 
experiment) were fed with a 60%-fat diet (HFD, Research Diets, D12492) or 
with a 10%-fat diet (LFD, Research Diets, D12450) for 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The 
12-week HFD experiments were repeated three times independently. OGTT 
and ITT were performed before and after the HFD feeding. For insulin- 
signaling assays, WT and MKO mice were fasted for 6 h and then i.p. injected 
with 0.75 U/kg insulin. Mice were euthanized after 15 min, and liver, epididymal 
AT, and muscle were collected for western blot analysis. Lean tissue and fat mass 
were measured using an Echo Medical systems’ EchoMRI 100 (Whole Body 
Composition Analyzers, EchoMRI, Houston, USA), according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses. AT and liver tissue sam-
ples were fixed in 3% formaldehyde solution overnight and embedded in paraffin. 
Tissue slides were stained with H&E for the evaluation of the tissue morphol-
ogy, following standardized protocols. AT and liver tissue macrophage infiltra-
tion was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a F4/80 antibody 
 
(AbD Setotec, MCA497R). Adipocyte size was measured by the diameters of the 
adipocytes in light-microscopy images (20×) of AT sections (n = 50 adipocytes 
per section, three sections per mouse, seven mice per group) and analyzed using 
ImageJ software. Experiments were done in a blinded manner.
FACS analysis of HFD mice AT SVF. Purified adipose SVF cells were resus-
pended in FACS buffer and stained with indicated fluorescent isotope– 
conjugated antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. The antibodies used for 
FACS included F4/80 (BM8; eBioscience, 25-4801-82, 1:100), CD11b (M1/70; 
eBioscience, 17-0112-82, 1:300), CD11c (N418; eBioscience, 48-0114-82, 1:100) 
and CD206 (C068C2; BioLegend, 141704, 1:50). Live/Dead fixable dead cell stain 
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) was used to discriminate between live and dead cells. 
The cells marked with the antibody were then washed three times with DPBS 
and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before analysis. Samples were analyzed in 
a LSRII cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using FACS Diva (BD Biosciences) and 
FlowJo (Tree Star) softwares.
Analysis of metabolic parameters. Blood glucose levels were measured using a glu-
cometer (Accu-Chek Performa, Roche). Plasma insulin (Mercodia, 10-1247-01), 
 
CCL2 (R&D Systems, 855993), IL-6 (R&D Systems, 872791) and TNF-α (R&D 
Systems, 783567) concentrations were determined by ELISA. HOMA-IR in mice 
was calculated using the following equation: (fasting glucose concentration ×  
fasting insulin concentration)/405. Plasma NEFA and glycerol release were 
measured using the colorimetric diagnostic kit, according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Randox Laboratories). Liver TGs were extracted and measured 
with a colorimetric diagnostic kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(WAKO diagnostics).
BMT and lentiviral infection. BMT was performed as previously described66. 
In brief, lentivirus expressing GFP (as control) or Flag-GPS2 were titered and 
used to transduce C57BL/6 WT or ob/ob BM cells. Cells were cultured for 24 h 
 
in transplantation media (RPMI + 10% FBS + 6 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6, 
 
and 10 ng/ml stem cell factor) and treated by spin infection with lentiviral 
supernatants (0.4 ml supernatant per 4 × 106 cells in the presence of polybrene) 
and centrifuged at 1,800g for 90 min. The spin infection was repeated 24 h 
later. After washing, the cells were used for BM transplantation into lethally 
 
irradiated WT recipient mice.
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence analysis of AT was performed on 
paraffin-embedded sections of 10 ìm on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Briefly, 
tissue sections were dewaxed through three consecutive incubations (5 min) in 
xylene and then rehydrated by three consecutive incubations (3 min) in 96–100% 
ethanol, followed by washes in de-ionized water. Sections were then incubated 
for 15 min at room temperature in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide, followed by 
two washes in de-ionized water. Photo-bleaching with 5 min under UV lamp 
and Oil Red O emersion for 2 min were applied to quench auto-fluorescence. 
Sections were then blocked for 30 min with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution 
and 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v). Primary antibodies diluted in TBS + 1% 
(w/v) BSA were applied for 2 h at room temperature, slides were then washed in 
TBS + 0.1% (v/v) Tween20 three times for 5 min, and the secondary antibodies 
were applied for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were then washed 
in TBS + 0.1% (v/v) Tween20 three times for 5 min, slides were mounted with 
VectaShield mounting media with DAPI and sealed with a transparent lacquer 
before imaging.
Images were acquired on an Axiovert 200M microscope using appropriate fil-
ters. The following antibodies were used: anti-F4/80 (1:50 AT, Cl:A3-1, MCA497, 
AbD Serotec), anti-Flag (1:100 AT, F7425, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Rat TRITC- 
conjugated secondary antibody (A18870, ThermoFisher); anti-Rabbit FITC-
conjugated secondary antibody (F2765, Life Technologies). Secondary antibod-
ies were applied at a dilution of 1:200. GFP and DAPI were imaged directly.
AT glucose-uptake analysis. Glucose uptake of [3H]-2-deoxyglucose was 
assayed, as described67. In brief, AT explants (ingWAT and epiWAT) were pre-
incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nmol/l of insulin and 50 mmol/l of 
[3H]-2DG (NEN, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; specific activity 26.2 Ci/mmol). 
After 10 min of incubation, explants were washed in ice-cold Krebs Ringer 
HEPES (KRH) buffer to stop transport and washed an additional four times 
in the same buffer to remove unbound label. Explants were blotted, and then

proteins were quantified to normalized. 3H radioactivity was determined by 
scintillation counting using a Minaxa Scintillation counter from Packard. Basal 
glucose uptake was taken as 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the absence of insulin.
Statistical analysis. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 
6.0b (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and all data are represented as 
mean ± s.e.m. Statistical tests were assessed after confirming that the data met 
appropriate assumptions (normality, homogenous variance, and independent 
sampling). Gaussian distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
test. Group comparisons were assessed with Student’s t test to compare two 
groups, and one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s or Dunnett’s post hoc 
test for multiple comparisons as appropriate. Human and mouse correlations 
were performed using Spearman’s test. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and 
 
P < 0.05 was defined as significant. No statistical methods were used to predeter-
mine sample size. No samples or animals were excluded from the analyses.
