Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health, but obtaining
representative data on AMR for healthy human populations is difficult. Here, we use meta-
genomic analysis of untreated sewage to characterize the bacterial resistome from 79 sites in
60 countries. We find systematic differences in abundance and diversity of AMR genes
between Europe/North-America/Oceania and Africa/Asia/South-America. Antimicrobial
use data and bacterial taxonomy only explains a minor part of the AMR variation that we
observe. We find no evidence for cross-selection between antimicrobial classes, or for effect
of air travel between sites. However, AMR gene abundance strongly correlates with socio-
economic, health and environmental factors, which we use to predict AMR gene abundances
in all countries in the world. Our findings suggest that global AMR gene diversity and
abundance vary by region, and that improving sanitation and health could potentially limit the
global burden of AMR. We propose metagenomic analysis of sewage as an ethically
acceptable and economically feasible approach for continuous global surveillance and pre-
diction of AMR.

 A
ntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a cross-cutting and
increasing threat to global health1,2, and it threatens to
undermine decades of progress in the treatment of
infectious diseases. AMR is a complex problem with multiple and
interconnected drivers, which may include changing dynamics in
travel, trade, climate change, and populations. Reliable informa-
tion that accurately describes and characterizes the global
occurrence and transmission of AMR is essential to address this
challenge and to support national and global priority setting,
public health actions, and treatment decisions.
Current surveillance of AMR is often focusing on a few
pathogens only and mainly based on passive reporting of phe-
notypic laboratory results for specific pathogens isolated from
human clinical infections1,3–5. This procedure leads to significant
time delays, often incomparable data, and a narrow pathogen
spectrum not capturing all relevant AMR genes, where the major
part might be present in the commensal bacterial flora of healthy
individuals. However, obtaining fecal samples from healthy
humans is logistically difficult.
From a surveillance point of view, urban sewage is attractive
because it provides sampling material from a large and mostly
healthy population, which otherwise would not be feasible to
monitor. Globally, a rapidly increased proportion of the human
population live in urban areas6 and an increasing proportion
is connected to a sewer system7,8. In addition, analyzing sewage
samples does not require informed consent, thus limiting
ethical concerns and has limited practical and logistical
barriers
for
sampling.
Most
microbiological
studies
on
sewage have focused on the risk of discharge of insufficiently
treated sewage or problems related to heavy rainfall overflow,
but some evaluations on the surveillance of pathogens have
also been performed9,10. Additionally, sewage has proven
useful
for
surveillance
in
the
global
polio
eradication
program11,12.
Metagenomic techniques, using short-read next-generation
sequencing data, benefit from the ability to quantify thousands
of especially transmissible resistance genes in a single sample.
Moreover, it can provide additional information about the
presence of bacterial species, pathogens, and virulence genes
and the data can be reanalyzed if novel genes of interest are
identified. It should, however, also be acknowledged that short-
read
metagenomics
might
provide
limited
information
regarding the host of the genes or the genetic environment.
Metagenomics has been found to be superior to conventional
methods for AMR surveillance in pig herds13 and has also been
utilized for the surveillance of global AMR gene dissemination
through international flights14. Additionally, an extensively
shared resistome was observed across urban sewage samples
within China15, as well as between individuals and environ-
mental samples in Lima, Peru16. Interestingly, Pehrsson et al.16
showed that even though changes in the bacterial composition
were observed between feces and sewage, this was not the case
for AMR genes.
Here we use metagenomic analysis of untreated sewage to
characterize the bacterial resistome from 79 sites in 60 coun-
tries. We find systematic differences in abundance and diversity
of AMR genes between Europe/North-America/Oceania and
Africa/Asia/South-America. Antimicrobial use data and bac-
terial taxonomy only explain a minor part of the AMR variation
that we observe. However, AMR gene abundance strongly
correlates with socio-economic, health, and environmental
factors, which we use to predict AMR gene abundances in all
countries in the world. Our findings suggest that global AMR
gene diversity and abundance vary by region and that
improving sanitation and health could potentially limit the
global burden of AMR.
Results
Global distribution of AMR genes. Domestic sewage was col-
lected from 79 sample locations, covering 7 geographical regions
from 74 cities in 60 countries (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 1).
Each sample was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq and the
resulting data (>1.4 Tb) processed using MGmapper17. The
average number of reads per sample was 120 million reads (range:
8 million –398 million). An average of 0.03% of the reads were
assigned to AMR genes, while on average 29%, 1%, 0.4%, and
0.2% were assigned to bacterial, protozoa, plants, and human
genomic material, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Sixty-
eight percent of the reads could not be assigned to any reference
sequence, and other metagenomic studies have also found larger
number of un-mapped reads (42%–48%)14,18. Rarefaction of the
reads mapping to bacterial genomes showed a tendency toward
saturation in the sequence data (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Analyses of duplicate samples from separate days from eight
sites
showed
a
high
degree
of
within-site
reproducibility
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Comparison of the data from the same
countries showed much less (permutation test, p < 0.0001)
variance across sites within countries than across sites between
different countries (Supplementary Fig. 3), which suggests that a
single sample taken from one large city is representative of the
overall occurrence of AMR in a country.
A total of 1546 genera were detected across all samples (range:
942–1367 genera per sample), but a limited number of bacterial
genera dominated (Supplementary Data 3, Supplementary Fig. 4).
Several of the dominant bacterial genera were typical fecal, such
as Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and
Bifidobacterium.
However,
other
highly
abundant
bacterial
genera, such as Acidovorax and Acinetobacter, are most likely
environmental bacteria. Thus, the bacterial composition of
sewage is complex and does not only reflect human feces but
also the changes occurring in the sewer. A comparison with
publicly available metagenomic data, although generated using
different DNA-purification methods, suggested that our urban
sewage samples resemble more the human fecal microbiome than
the animal fecal microbiome from chickens, pigs, or mice
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
The total AMR gene abundances varied across sites and
continents (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 4). The highest AMR
gene levels were observed in African countries (average: 2034.3
fragments per kilo base per million fragments (FPKM)), although
Brazil had the highest abundance of all (4616.9 FPKM). At the
lower end of the spectrum were Oceania (New Zealand and
Australia) (average: 529.5 FPKM). To the best of our knowledge,
comparable data on the global occurrence of AMR genes of
predominantly healthy people do not exist. In agreement with our
findings, a previous study on the resistome from toilet waste from
long-distance flights14 suggested that the AMR levels in South
Asia were higher than in Europe. Data on AMR in bacteria
isolated from clinical infections in humans, collected by the
World Health Organization (WHO)1, suggest a high prevalence
of AMR in many developing countries, even though several of the
national studies reported by the WHO give contradictory results1.
A total of 1625 different AMR genes belonging to 408 gene
groups were identified, including several that have emerged
recently, such as CTX-M, NDM, mcr, and optrA (Supplementary
Data 4). Several different AMR genes might encode resistance to the
same antimicrobial agent. Thus the relative abundance of AMR
genes was aggregated to the corresponding antimicrobial class level
for each sample to explore major trends across countries (Fig. 1c).
AMR genes encoding resistance toward macrolides, tetracyclines,
aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and sulfonamides were the most
abundant. Most samples from Europe and North America had a
high relative proportion of macrolide resistance genes, while Asian

 and African samples had a large proportion of genes providing
resistance to sulfonamides and phenicols. Fifteen AMR genes
contributed >50% of the total AMR abundance (Fig. 1d). This
proportion was especially prominent for Europe, North-America,
and Oceania. None of the dominant AMR genes are known to be
restricted to specific bacterial genera19–21.
Global diversity and clustering of AMR genes. We analyzed the
AMR abundances on both the gene and antimicrobial class
levels using both principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) and
heat maps (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 6). With regard to the
sample resistome dissimilarities, there was a clear geographical
separation along the first principal coordinate of samples from

 Europe/North-America/Oceania and samples from Africa/Asia/
South-America. Regional groupings explained 27% of the dis-
similarity
between
sample
resistomes
(adonis2,
p < 0.001;
Fig. 2a). The separation among the groups was mainly driven
by higher levels of resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycosides,
beta-lactams, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim in the Africa/
Asia/South America cluster, whereas macrolide resistance was
more evenly distributed among all samples (Fig. 2b). A clearer
clustering was observed based on regions, compared with
clustering based on diet, income, or the Human Development
Index (HDI) (Supplementary Figs. 6–7). A stronger regional
separation was observed on the AMR class level, compared with
the gene level (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 6). On the class level,
a very clear separation of all samples in two groups was
observed, where only a single European sample (Malta) did not
cluster with all other samples from Europe/North America/
Oceania (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, only one sample from Asia
(Kazakhstan), one from the Middle East (Turkey), and one
from South America (Galapagos Islands) clustered with the
Europe/North-America/Oceania group.
Several alpha diversity indices for each sample resistome were
calculated
(Supplementary
Fig.
8).
The
resistome
median
evenness was higher in African and Asian countries compared
with resistomes from other geographical locations. Thus not only
do these regions have a higher prevalence of AMR genes, but also
a more equal distribution of the different AMR genes.
Analyses of the alpha diversity of the bacterial taxonomic
composition showed less separation according to geographical
regions compared with the AMR genes (Supplementary Figs. 9–
11), and regions explained less of the variation in the resistome
(adonis2,
27%)
compared
with
the
bacterial
composition
(adonis2, 17%). To test the degree to which bacterial genus-
level composition of the microbiota is associated with the
resistomes, Procrustes analyses were performed (Supplementary
Fig. 12). We compared ordinations of the bacterial taxonomic
composition with the resistome and found that they correlated
significantly (protest, p < 0.001).
AMR genes and drug use association. Several studies have
shown that antimicrobial use (AMU) selects for AMR22,23 and
that reducing AMU often results in reduced AMR24,25, except
when there is interference between genetically linked AMR genes
conferring resistance to different antimicrobial classes26. It has
also been suggested that AMU explains only some of the
variation22,23 and that other factors such as diet, cultural tradi-
tions and occupation also have an influence22,27.
In this study, the association between AMU and the occurrence
of AMR in the sewage samples was estimated using a generalized
linear mixed-effects model, with the counts of genes in the
different antimicrobial classes as an outcome (Poisson) adjusting
for sequencing depth and gene length. As AMU data, we included

 2015 data from Europe [www.ecdc.dk] and IQVIA, formerly
Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc. (see Methods). In the regression
model, we accounted for the potential effects of cross-resistance
by fitting fixed effects of both usage of the antimicrobial class that
a resistance gene primarily confers resistance to (direct selection
for resistance) and the total AMU (indirect selection via cross-
resistance). While our model showed a significant increase in the
abundance of AMR genes belonging to a specific antimicrobial
class with increasing usage of that antimicrobial class, we found
no significant effect of total usage of all antimicrobials on
abundance of the different classes (Supplementary Fig. 13A,
Supplementary Table 1). This suggests that, while AMU of a
specific class is an important driver of AMR genes encoding
resistance to that class, the effects of cross- and/or co-resistance
appear to have a relatively minor contribution to AMR
abundances. Furthermore, our model showed that the countries
with a lower HDI (i.e., higher in rank) have lower abundances of
AMR genes (glmm, p = 0.01) and that the number of passengers
arriving in a country via flights has no effect on the abundance of
AMR genes (glmm, p = 0.62).
A second (similar) model was developed to test the association
between the abundance of AMR genes on the antimicrobial class
level and the antimicrobial residue levels. Again we accounted for
the potential effects of cross-resistance by fitting fixed effects of
both residues of the antimicrobial class that a resistance gene
primarily confers resistance to (direct selection for resistance) and
the total antimicrobial residue levels (indirect selection via cross-
resistance). As before, this model showed a significant increase in
the abundance of AMR genes belonging to a specific antimicro-
bial class with increasing levels of drug residues of that
antimicrobial class; however, we found no significant effect of
total residue levels (Supplementary Fig. 13B). As with the
previous model, this model also showed that the countries with
a lower HDI (i.e., higher in rank) were less abundant in terms of
AMR genes (glmm, p < 0.001), and that the number of passengers
arriving in a country via flights had no effect on the abundance of
AMR genes (glmm, p = 0.746), indicating that the results are
robust.
Of interest is that there was no correlation between AMU and
antimicrobial residue in our data (lm, R2 = 0.00098, p = 0.55).
One possible explanation for this could be that AMR abundances
accumulates on a long timescale because of the average usage in a
country (i.e., (long term) AMU impacts the level of resistance);
however, on a much shorter timescale fluctuations in AMU will
change the AMR composition (diversity) somewhat, which is
captured by the residue levels, which can be interpreted as a
(short) temporal snapshot of the actual usage.
Prediction of AMR based on population-level health data. We
observed that AMU only explained a minor part of the occur-
rence of AMR across the world. In addition, AMU data are dif-
ficult to obtain and likely subject to limitations due to the lack of
an effective prescription system in many countries. Measuring
antimicrobial residue levels in sewage as a proxy for AMU is also
associated with uncertainties and the rapid degradation in the
environment of the heavily used beta-lactamase-sensitive anti-
microbials makes it difficult to reliably measure them.
Because the HDI was strongly associated with AMR, in the
results of our model, we hypothesized that a number of other
factors could be either drivers or indicators for AMR. To
investigate this further, we used 1503 variables from the World
Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population as well as Development
indicator data sets collected between the years 2000 and 2016 for
259 countries and territories to study the potential association
with the observed AMR gene abundances. Using country-specific
variables, we were able to explain up to 89% of the observed
variation across the samples (Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplemen-
tary Table 2). Most of the variables associated with AMR levels
were related to sanitation and general health (Fig. 3, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 15, Supplementary Table 3). Subsequently, the identified
variables were used to predict the occurrence of AMR in 259
countries and territories. The three countries predicted to have
the lowest level of AMR were The Netherlands, New Zealand, and
Sweden, whereas the highest predicted AMR levels were for
Tanzania, Vietnam, and Nigeria (Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 5).
The predicted global country-level resistance levels were multi-
plied with the latest national population estimate and used to
create global maps of healthy human-associated AMR (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16).
Discussion
A reliable base of evidence that accurately describes and char-
acterizes the global burden and transmission of AMR is essential
to support national and global priority setting, public health
actions, and treatment decisions. Compared to samples directly
obtained from humans, a major advantage of sewage is that such
samples can be easily obtained and analyzed without ethical
concerns. Thus, while current efforts to improve surveillance of
AMR in human clinical pathogens should be continued1,3–5, we
do suggest that our study provides the foundation for a flexible,
simple, affordable, and ethically acceptable global real-time sur-
veillance of AMR that could be immediately implemented glob-
ally also in low- and middle-income countries. The study design
can furthermore be used for other infectious disease agents.
Our study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first
attempt to monitor and predict the occurrence of AMR in the
global predominantly healthy human population. Even though
the study suffers from the limitation that only a single sample was
analyzed from each site, our study suggests a strong systematic
separation of regions of the world according to AMR gene
abundance with high-income countries in Europe/North-Amer-
ica/Oceania constituting one cluster and low-income countries in
Africa/Asia/South-America constituting another cluster. This
separation was mainly driven by a relatively high abundance of a
limited number of AMR genes encoding macrolide resistance
genes in Europe/North-America/Oceania, compared with a gen-
eral high abundance of several different AMR genes from dif-
ferent classes in the rest of the world. The countries standing out
as having the most divergent distribution of AMR genes were
Vietnam, India, and Brazil, suggesting that these countries could
be hot spots for emergence of novel AMR mechanisms.
In this study, we used metagenomics that benefit from the
ability to quantify thousands of genes simultaneously and that the
data can be reanalyzed if novel genes of interest are identified.
However, other methodologies might also be useful such as cul-
ture and PCR-based methods that might have better sensitivity.
Comparative studies evaluating the usefulness of various tech-
nologies, including evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and
number of targets detected, are warranted.
In our study, we have focused on total AMR abundance.
However, the resistance to the different antimicrobial classes are
not equally important28 neither are all AMR genes29. Thus fur-
ther studies could also benefit from addressing specific resistance
genes.
An analysis of the same IQVIA AMU data from 2000 to
2015, as we have used here, was recently published30, and even
though a significant increase in AMU was observed, especially
for countries in Africa, Asia, and South-America, the quantities
are still below most countries in Europe and North-America.
We could not in our study find significant associations between

 obtainable AMU data and the concentrations of residues
measured, but we did observe the highest concentrations of
antimicrobial agents in the African samples, which could sug-
gest that measuring residues in sewage could provide alternative
data for monitoring AMU compared to obtainable sales data.
Historically, most strategies to reduce AMR have focused on
reducing AMU, which relies upon AMR imparting a fitness cost
on the bacterial host, an effect that has been relatively weak in
horizontally transferred AMR genes compared with chromoso-
mal mutations31. Other factors, such as those related to

 transmission, including infection control, sanitation, access to
clean water, access to assured quality antimicrobials and diag-
nostics, travel, and migration, have also been suggested to con-
tribute significantly to AMR27. In this study, we found that,
irrespective of the diversity of AMR genes, the total AMR
abundance was highly correlated with a limited number of World
Bank
variables,
mainly
concerning
sanitation
and
health.
In contrast, human air travel had no significant influence on
AMR abundance. Importantly, this suggests that the total AMR
abundance is mainly influenced by local/national parameters, and
even though all AMR genes might rapidly disseminate and be
found in all corners of the world, local selection is required
for them to reach appreciable frequencies. These findings
suggest that improving sanitation, health, and perhaps education
as part of the Sustainable Development Goals [www.un.org/
sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/]
would
be effective strategies for limiting the global burden of AMR.
Methods
Ethics. It was confirmed that this and similar studies using human sewage in
accordance with the Danish Act on scientific ethical treatment of health research
(Journal no.: H-14013582) do not require preapproval from ethical committees.
Collection of urban sewage samples. The National Food Institute, Technical
University of Denmark (DTU Food) launched an open invitation 25 September
2015 seeking potential collaborators to participate in the pilot study of the Global
Sewage Surveillance Project (GSSP). The invitation was sent by electronic mail to
the following networks and individual research collaborators for further dis-
semination: WHO Global Foodborne Infections Network (GFN) [http://www.who.
int/gfn/en/], WHO Advisory Group on Integrated Surveillance of Antimicrobial
Resistance (AGISAR) [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/antimicrobial-
resistance/agisar/en/], European Union Reference Laboratory for AMR network
[www.eurl-ar.eu/], and to the European Food- and Waterborne Diseases and
Zoonoses Network (FWD-Net) [https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/about-us/partnerships-
and-networks/disease-and-laboratory-networks/fwd-net].
Participation was cost neutral and managed by online registration that also
included requests for proper packaging and sample containers and the need to sign
a material transfer agreement or similar approval/agreement to protect any
intellectual property rights. All expenses related to the shipments were paid by
DTU Food, and the shipments complied with the IATA regulation as per SP A197
because the content of the parcels was identified as UN3082 “Environmentally
hazardous substance, liquid, not otherwise specified” but did not exceed 5 L of
sewage.
A protocol that instructed how to collect the urban sewage samples as well as
epidemiological, demographic, and geographical information was provided to each
participant in the study (Supplementary Data 8). Participants were requested in
conjunction with collecting the samples to submit via an online survey the captured
information related to epidemiological, demographic, and geographical
information as well as a digital image of the sampling site, if possible the GPS
coordinates of the sampling location, the temperature of the sample at the time of
sampling, pH of the sewage, and storage temperature of sample. From each
location, on 2 consecutive days between 25 January and 5 February 2016, one
representative, non-processed, unfiltered urban sewage sample of 2 L was collected
from the respective main sewage pipeline(s) prior to the inlet of the wastewater
treatment plant or from the main outlet to rivers or similar according to the
protocol provided. Flow proportion sampling over 24 h was preferred.
Alternatively, three crude point samples were collected in a short time interval, i.e.,
at least 5 min between each individual sample, to ensure as much randomness as
possible. The collected urban sewage was not treated, neither with additives nor
DNA stabilizers and was recommended to be stored at −80 °C for at least 48 h
prior to shipment to avoid the use of dry ice. The sample-specific data are provided
in Supplementary Data 1 and an explanation of the content of this file provided as
Supplementary Note 1.
Sample handling and DNA extraction. At DTU Food, a photograph of each
sample container was taken upon arrival combined with a short remark describing
the condition of the sample, e.g., solid frozen, thawed, coloration, etc. The samples
of the first of the consecutive days were thawed for 12 h at approximately 20 °C
before processing. After thawing, 250 mL of each sample were pelleted in a cen-
trifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was stored at −20 °C or −80 °C before
DNA extraction and metagenomics analysis, and the supernatant was stored at
−80 °C for subsequent antimicrobial residue and virus analysis. DNA was extracted
from the sewage pellets according to an optimized protocol using the QIAamp Fast
DNA Stool Mini Kit including twice the input material and initial bead beating32.
For each batch of DNA extractions, a DNA extraction blank control was processed
in parallel with the sewage samples to monitor background DNA.
Whole-community sequencing. DNA was shipped on dry ice for library pre-
paration and sequencing to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF).
DNA from all samples was mechanically sheared to a targeted fragment size of 300
bp using ultrasonication (Covaris E220evolution). Library preparation was per-
formed with the NEXTflex PCR-free Library Preparation Kit (Bioo Scientific). The
Bioo NEXTflex-96 adapter set (Bioo Scientific) was used, and in batches of roughly
60 samples, the libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on the HiSeq3000
platform (Illumina), using 2 × 150-bp paired-end sequencing per flow cell. The raw
sequencing data have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive under
accession number ERP015409.
Trimming and mapping of sequencing reads. The reads were trimmed, including
adaptor removal, using BBduk [BBMap—Bushnell B.—https://sourceforge.net/
projects/bbmap/] with a quality threshold at 20 and minimum length of 50 bp.
Trimmed reads were used as input to the reference-based mapping and taxonomy-
assignment tool MGmapper17, which is based on BWA-MEM33 version 0.7.12 and
SAMtools34 version 1.6. Reads were aligned against reference sequence databases
for the best hit (Bestmode, i.e., a read can only map to 1 reference sequence). An
acquired AMR gene database (ResFinder)35 was used to annotate properly paired
reads (MGmapper option fullmode) where each read pair had sequence coverage of
at least 80% compared with the length of the trimmed reads. This was the only
filter that was applied to discard a read pair. The AMR genes were of bacterial
origin and could therefore align to both bacteria databases and the Resfinder
database. To enable multiple database hits, AMR genes were mapped using the
Fullmode option in MGmapper for the most optimal abundance calculation.
Genomic annotation was performed by identifying the best hit (MGmapper option
bestmode) for a pair of reads when aligned against a range of reference sequence
databases. Databases were primarily downloaded via NCBI genbank clade specific
assembly_summary.txt files unless another ftp site is provided below. The list of
databases used by MGmapper includes: Human (GRCh38.p3), bacteria (closed
genomes), MetaHitAssembly (PRJEB674—PRJEB1046), HumanMicrobiome
(genomes assemblies), bacteria_draft, plasmid, archaea, virus, fungi, protozoa,
vertebrates_mammals, vertebrates_other, invertebrates, plant, and nt. For the
bacteria and bacteria_draft databases, sequences were selected from the assem-
bly_summary.txt file, when annotated with the tags version_status=‘latest’ and
genome_rep=‘Full’. Furthermore, assembly_level= ‘Complete genome’ or ‘Chro-
mosome’ were required for entries in the bacteria database and refseq_categor-
y=‘representative genome’ for entries in the bacteria_draft database. The plasmid
database was constructed as the subset of bacteria and bacteria_draft sequences
having the word ‘plasmid’ in the fasta entry header line.
The total bacteria read count for a sample was calculated as the sum of read
counts from each of the bacteria-related databases (bacteria, bacteria_draft,
MetaHitAssembly, and HumanMicrobiome). The total fraction of unmapped reads
for all sample sites were used to translate the percentage of unmapped reads into Z-
scores, i.e., the number of standard deviations from the mean. Setting an absolute
Z-score threshold at 3 retained data from 79 sample sites. Data from Chad were
excluded based on the Z-score threshold together with data from Gambia with
suspiciously low resistance read counts; i.e., lower than those observed from DNA
extraction control samples.
Bacterial and AMR gene distribution. Inspection of the count tables and the
mapped reads distribution on the genomes revealed an overestimation of some
genomes due to plasmids with high copy numbers. The issue only occurred in the
included draft genomes, as the plasmid DNA were left out of the database with
complete bacterial genomes. The distribution of mapped reads across contigs was
expected to be evenly distributed, with some variation. The plasmids were revealed
by large hit counts to specific contigs compared with the associated contigs in a
draft genome. For each draft genome, the hits to each contig was normalized with
respect to contig size. The median of the contig hits was found and the third
quartile and the interquartile range was calculated. If a hit count was above the
third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range, then the hit count was inter-
preted as an overestimation and adjusted by replacing the hit count with the
median.
Relative abundance of AMR genes and bacterial genera were calculated as
FPKM. This was done to account for both sample-wise sequencing depth
differences and size-dependent probability of observing a reference. For bacterial
genome assemblies, FPKM was calculated based on the adjusted sum of fragments
assigned to a genome assembly, whether or not the genome was closed. For AMR
genes, FPKM was calculated on each individual ResFinder reference sequence.
FPKMs were subsequently summed up across categories to bacterial genera (NCBI
taxid), drug class level (NCBI tax ID), and highly homologous AMR gene groups
(CD-HIT-EST, 90% similarity)36.
Within-site reproducibility. In order to test reproducibility of sewage samples, a
dendrogram of resistome composition from all sewage samples including samples
from eight sites that were double-sampled sewage was generated using Bray–Curtis

 (BC) dissimilarities and hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. 2). The replicated
samples were taken by 2 days apart. The day 2 samples were taken twice. The day
2 samples were kept in freezer for 2 years prior sequencing. Samples from day 1 and
day 2 were sequenced using the same DNA extraction and sequencing protocols. The
replicated samples had higher resistome similarity to its own replicates and all eight
sets of replicate samples were clustered with their own replicate. This result shows a
strong reproducibility of sewage samples despite having different day of sampling and
2 years of storage. The repeats were not included in subsequent analyses.
Within-country representativeness. To assess whether samples from individual
sites are representative of other sites in that country, we compared the BC dis-
similarities for pairs of sites within the same country and in different countries for
both resistome and bacteriome compositions. We assessed the significance of these
differences using permutation tests. We permuted the country labels for each
sample and reassessed the dissimilarities for pairs of sites within the same country
and in different countries with permuted labels. We repeated this procedure 106
times to build up a null distribution of the differences in dissimilarity within and
among countries. We found that resistome dissimilarities were on average 34%
higher for pairs of sites in different countries than for pairs of sites within the same
country (permutation, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 3A and B), while bacteriome
dissimilarities were 46% higher for pairs of sites in different countries than for pairs
of sites within the same country (p < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 3C and D). These
results show that there is less variance across sites within countries than across sites
within different countries. Thus individual sites in this study are representative of
other sites in that country.
Sample composition comparison. Metagenomes with the following accession
numbers were downloaded from SRA (December 2017): ERR011089, ERR011114,

The quality of the data was assessed and if necessary adapters were removed and
trimmed with a quality threshold at 20 and minimum length of 50 bp. All pairwise
Jaccard distances of the aforementioned metagenomes, all global sewage samples,
and the control samples were calculated with Mash37. The heat map was drawn in
R 3.4.4 (pheatmap).
Sample dissimilarities. Matrices with relative abundances (FPKM) of AMR genes
and bacterial genera were Hellinger-transformed using the decostand function in
vegan. The BC dissimilarity matrices were then calculated using the vegdist func-
tion, also in vegan (Supplementary Data 6).
Heat maps. The relative abundances (FPKM) of AMR genes were log-transformed
and visualized in a heat map (pheatmap), showing the 50 most abundant genes.
The gene-wise dendrogram is based on Pearson product moment correlation
coefficients (PPMC), while the sample dendrogram is based on the aforementioned
BC dissimilarity matrices, not just for the visualized genes, but all genes. Both
dendrograms are the result of complete linkage clustering. The bacterial genera
heat map was produced in the same way, while the AMR class-level heat map
differs by using PPMC for hierarchical clustering of both AMR classes and samples.
Continent association was included as metadata for all heat maps. For the AMR
genes, we included World Bank income levels [http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.
metadata.COUNTRY?lang=en], GEMS cluster (identifies countries with similar
dietary intake)38, the HDI39, and GBD 2015 super-regions40.
Sample ordination. Dissimilarity matrices were subject to classical multi-
dimensional scaling (PCoA) to obtain the first two principal coordinates as well as
the variance explained by each, ignoring negative eigenvectors. This was done using
the cmdscale command in R.
Testing of sample dissimilarities. The BC dissimilarity matrices used for PCoA
were also used for permutational multivariate analysis of variance (adonis2 func-
tion in vegan). The geographical group assigned to each sample was used as a
predictor for dissimilarity.
Alpha diversity. Diversity and richness were calculated on rarified versions of the
resistance and bacterial count matrices. For resistance genes, the two samples with
<1000 read pairs were excluded. Subsequently, count matrices were subsampled to
the lowest samples’ depth, using the Vegan rarefy function. The Simpson diversity
index (1-D), Pielou’s evenness, and the Chao1 richness estimates were calculated
using the diversity function in the vegan package.
Procrustes analysis. The vegan package was used for comparing the resistome
dissimilarities with the bacteriome dissimilarities. The protest function was used to
scale and rotate the principal coordinates of the bacterial PCoA onto the principal
coordinates of the resistome PCoA and testing the strength of the association.
Graphics and statistics. All plots and statistical analyses were carried out in
Microsoft R Open 3.3.2.
Correlation between AMU and external explanatory variables. A multilevel
Poisson model was developed to investigate the sources of variance for the
abundance of AMR genes and the relationship between AMU and abundance of
AMR genes found in the samples. The counts of the individual AMR genes in each
of the samples (see “Collection of urban sewage samples” and “Whole-community
sequencing“ sections) aggregated at the antimicrobial class level was used as the
dependent variable.
An observation-level random effect was used to model the over dispersion
inherent to count data41. Because several samples were sequenced more than once
on separate sequencing runs, we were able to estimate and correct for the noise in
mean AMR gene abundance owing to the sampling process. Therefore, a
categorical variable indicating which sample was used was included as a random
effect (sample). A categorical variable identifying each location to allow for the
estimation of variation in abundance of resistance genes between the different
sampling locations (location) was included. Furthermore, a variable identifying the
resistance class a resistance gene is a member of was included to estimate the
variance due to differences in abundance between antimicrobial classes (class).
For the fixed effects, we included a measure of AMU at the country level. Data from
the ECDC database (Supplementary Data 1) and data from the IMS database
(Supplementary Data 1) were used to calculate a new variable from the two data sets. To
this end, we used the data from the ECDC data set where available to predict missing
values from the IMS data set by using a linear regression model. Because the data from
the two data sets are highly correlated (r = 0.97, p < 0.01, Pearson’s product moment
correlation), we could infer the (approximate) corresponding ECDC value from the
IMS value for that particular country. The antimicrobial usage data were then log-
transformed. Because it has been argued that many antimicrobial classes show cross-
resistance, where resistance to one antimicrobial class also confers resistance to another
class, we accounted for the potential effects of cross-resistance by fitting effects of both
usage of the antimicrobial class that a resistance gene primarily confers resistance to
(direct selection for resistance) and total AMU (indirect selection via cross-resistance).
We also included the total number of passengers arriving in a country in 2015 as a fixed
effect in the model. Data on the number of passengers were extracted from the ICAO
international flight database [https://portal.icao.int, downloaded April 2016] and log-
transformed. Lastly, we included the United Nations HDI as a fixed effect. HDI data
from 2015 were extracted for the United Nations Development Programme website39
and log-transformed and scaled before including them in the final model. The same
model set-up was used to investigate the association between drug residue levels and
AMR gene abundance. In this model, data on the drug residues in the samples was
included as a fixed effect instead of the AMU data. All other effects (random and fixed)
were kept the same. Others models including temperature at the collection site at the
day of sampling and Gross Domestic Product showed no significant association with
AMR genes abundance (glmm’s, all p > 0.05).
Resistance prediction. World Bank Health, Nutrition and Population as well as
Development indicator data sets collected between the years 2000 and 2016 for 259
countries and territories were downloaded from http://databank.worldbank.org/
data/home.aspx in October 2017 and used to formulate AMR predictive models.
Imputations of missing data were conducted using the missForest R package, which
is a random forest-based technique that is highly computationally efficient for
high-dimensional data consisting of both categorical and continuous predictors42.
The final data set consisted of 1503 economic and health indicator variables
(Supplementary Data 7). The most important variables predicting total resistance
(FPKM) were selected from the World Bank data set and a recursive feature
elimination method from the R library caret (Supplementary Table 3). The model
was also run on all 1503 variables for comparison (Supplementary Table 4) and a
good correlation was observed. The machine learning algorithms Support Vector
Machine and random forest were compared for accuracy in predictions based on
their R2 and Root Mean Square Error43,44. Random forest was the best choice of
model (Supplementary Table 2). Random forest is suitable for data sets with many
features, especially where each of the features contributes little information45. The
prediction model was trained for the 60 countries where resistance data were
available from the current project followed by global predictions of resistance for all
259 countries and territories (Supplementary Data 5).
Overfitting remains a major hurdle when applying predictive models especially
involving many predictors. Breiman45 proved that random forest is protected from
overfitting by the incorporation of out-of-bag (OOB) estimates and from the law of
large numbers. This followed from earlier proposals on the use of OOB estimates as a
key part of estimation of generalization error46,47. In the study of error estimates for
bagged classifiers, Breiman48,49 provided empirical evidence demonstrating same
accuracy from using the OOB estimate as using a test set of the same size as the
training set and further indicated that the use of the OOB error estimate removes the

 need for a set aside test set. OOB is the mean prediction error on each training sample
xi, using only the trees that did not have xi in their bootstrap sample50. During
random forest training, approximately one third of the instances are left out from
each bootstrap training set. This means that the OOB estimates are computed from
only about one third as many classifiers as in the ongoing main combination.
However, the error rate decreases as the number of combinations increases, which
means the OOB estimates will tend to overestimate the current error rate. To get
unbiased OOB estimates, random forests are run past the point where the test set
error converges. This has an added advantage that, unlike cross-validation, where bias
is present but its extent unknown, the OOB estimates are unbiased51.
Random forests also aggregate many decision trees to limit overfitting as well as
error due to bias because of the law of large numbers. Random forests limit
overfitting without substantially increasing error due to bias due to their ability to
mitigate the problems of high variance and high bias45.
However, a ten-fold cross-validation was included during our model building
by randomly partitioning model input samples into ten sets of roughly equal size
followed by estimation of accuracy based on held-out samples. This held-out
sample was each time returned to the training set and the procedure was repeated
with the second subset held out and so forth. Cross-validation and checking for
valid accuracy were also performed with an implication that accuracy scores reduce
if there is overfitting and only “valid accuracy” is finally used.
Creation of global figures and maps. QGIS 2.18.11 using the cartogram package
was used to create colored and distorted maps.
Analysis of tetracyclines, sulfonamides, macrolides, and quinolone. The ana-
lysis of tetracyclines, sulfonamides, macrolides, and quinolones in the sewage
samples were performed as in Beredsen et al.52, with adaptations as summarized in
the following text. For pretreatment, two 10-mL portions of each sample of sewage
supernatant were weighed into separate 50-mL tubes, after which internal stan-
dards were added. To one of these portions, antimicrobials were added at a level of
25 ng/L for the sulfonamides and 100 ng/L for the tetracyclines, quinolones, and
macrolides. Four mL of EDTA-McIlvain buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.0) were added, after
which the samples were shaken for 5 min head-over-head. The residue was taken
up in 100 μL MeOH, after which 400 μL of water was added. For liquid chroma-
tography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the following gradient was
applied: 0–0.5 min 1% B; 0.5–2.5 min linear increase to 25% B; 2.5–5.4 min linear
increase to 70% B; 5.4–5.5 min linear increase to 100% B, with a final hold of 1.0
min. The injection volume was 5 μL. Detection was carried out by an AB Sciex
(Ramingham, MA, USA) Q-Trap 5500 or a Q-Trap 6500 mass spectrometer in
positive electrospray ionization (ESI). The parameters used for the Q-Trap 5500
and the Q-Trap 6500 were: capillary voltage, −4.0 kV; declustering potential, 10 V;
source temperature, 450 °C; GAS 1 and 2, 50 (arbitrary units).
Analysis of aminoglycosides. The analysis of aminoglycosides in the sewage
samples was performed as in Bello53, with adaptations as summarized in the fol-
lowing. For sample pretreatment, two 10-mL portions of each sample of sewage
were weighed into separate 50-mL tubes, after which internal standards were
added. To one of these portions, aminoglycosides were added at a level of 50 μg/L.
Twenty mL of extraction liquid (10 mM KH2PO4 with 0.4 mM EDTA and 2%
TCA) were added, and samples were mixed by means of a vortex and shaken head-
over-head for 10 min. The extract was then brought to pH 7.6–7.9 and centrifuged
(15 min, 3600 × g). The complete extract was transferred to a conditioned CBX
cartridge, followed by washing with 4 mL of water and drying. The aminoglyco-
sides were eluted with 3 mL of acetic acid (10% in MeOH). The eluate was dried at
60 °C, evaporated under N2 and taken up in 400 μL of HFBA (0.065%). For LC-
MS/MS, the following gradient was applied: 0–0.5 min, 0% B; 0.5–5 min, linear
increase to 45% B; 5–8 min, linear increase to 60% B; 8–10 min, linear increase to
100% B. The injection volume was 40 μL. Detection was carried out by a Waters
(Milford, MA, USA) Quattro Ultima mass spectrometer in positive ESI mode. The
parameters used were: capillary voltage, 2.7 kV; desolvation temperature, 500 °C;
source temperature, 120 °C; cone gas, 150 L/h; and desolvation gas 550 L/h.
Analysis of β-lactams. The analysis of β-lactams in the sewage samples was
performed as in Beredsen et al.54, with adaptations as summarized in the following.
For sample pretreatment, two 10-mL portions of each sample of sewage were
weighed into separate 50-mL tubes, after which internal standards were added. To
one of these portions, β-lactams were added at a level of 50 μg/L for the penicillins
and 500 μg/L for the cephalosporins and carbapenems. Detection was carried out
by a Waters model Xevo TQS or an AB Sciex (Ramingham, MA, USA) Q-Trap
6500 mass spectrometer in positive ESI mode. The parameters used for the QTrap
6500 were: capillary voltage, 2.0 kV; cone voltage, 25 V; source offset, 20 V; source
temperature, 150 °C; desolvation temperature, 550 °C; cone gas flow, 150 L/h; and
desolvation gas, 600 L/h.
Calculation of defined daily dosages (DDDs) based on residues. After con-
sumption, antimicrobials undergo (1) metabolization in the body, (2) are elimi-
nated from the body with urine and/or feces, and might (3) further degrade in the
sewer. A proper calculation of DDD/person/day from concentrations in sewage
therefore requires information on elimination rates and a precise estimate of the
number of persons connected to a sewer and the total water flow at this specific
location (or the average water consumption per person as surrogate). Here
information on elimination rates and water consumption were not included. In
addition, we can only calculate DDD for human drugs used for systematic infec-
tions. As seen from Supplementary Data 1, the amount of dihysdrostreptomycin is
almost absent, the use of Dapson very low, and the contribution of enrofloxacin
and tylosin 0.1% and 0.3% of the residues of quinolones and macrolides, respec-
tively. For the sulfonamides, the excluded drugs constitute 11%.
The concentrations of antimicrobial residues were transformed into DDDs
of antimicrobials for systemic use using the WHO DDD database [www.whocc.
no/atc_ddd_index]. Some residues were excluded as their predominant usage
was not systemic. This was the case for Dapson (main treatment indication:
Lepra treatment), sulfacetamide (main indication: acne), sulfadoxine (main
indication: malaria), sulfathiazole (main indication: topical application, with
varying dosages), enrofloxacin (animal use—no WHO/ATCC DDD available),
tylosin (animal use—no WHO/ATCC DDD available), and
dihydrostreptomycin (animal use—no WHO/ATCC DDD available). The DDD
were summed over the respective antimicrobial classes. Calculation of the sum
of DDD across classes was not deemed meaningful, because excretion rates
differ largely between antimicrobial classes and also within antimicrobial
classes.
