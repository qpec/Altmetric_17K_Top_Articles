Abstract
Men who have sex with men (MSM) have differences in immune activation and gut micro-
biome composition compared with men who have sex with women (MSW), even in the
absence of HIV infection. Gut microbiome differences associated with HIV itself when con-
trolling for MSM, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, are relatively subtle. Understand-
ing whether gut microbiome composition impacts immune activation in HIV-negative and
HIV-positive MSM has important implications since immune activation has been associated
with HIV acquisition risk and disease progression. To investigate the effects of MSM and
HIV-associated gut microbiota on immune activation, we transplanted feces from HIV-nega-
tive MSW, HIV-negative MSM, and HIV-positive untreated MSM to gnotobiotic mice. Follow-
ing transplant, 16S rRNA gene sequencing determined that the microbiomes of MSM and
MSW maintained distinct compositions in mice and that specific microbial differences
between MSM and MSW were replicated. Immunologically, HIV-negative MSM donors had
higher frequencies of blood CD38+ HLADR+ and CD103+ T cells and their fecal recipients
had higher frequencies of gut CD69+ and CD103+ T cells, compared with HIV-negative
MSW donors and recipients, respectively. Significant microbiome differences were not
detected between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM in this small donor cohort, and
immune differences between their recipients were trending but not statistically significant. A
larger donor cohort may therefore be needed to detect immune-modulating microbes asso-
ciated with HIV. To investigate whether our findings in mice could have implications for HIV
replication, we infected primary human lamina propria cells stimulated with isolated fecal
microbiota, and found that microbiota from MSM stimulated higher frequencies of HIV-
infected cells than microbiota from MSW. Finally, we identified several microbes that corre-
lated with immune readouts in both fecal recipients and donors, and with in vitro HIV

Author summary
The communities of commensal microbes that colonize the human gut comprise the gut
microbiome, which has been shown to play a significant role in shaping the immune sys-
tem. Recent studies have reported a distinct gut microbiome composition in men who
have sex with men (MSM) exhibiting HIV-risk behaviors when compared with low-risk
men who have sex with women (MSW), regardless of their HIV infection status. Whether
these gut microbiome differences in high-risk MSM directly impact immune activation is
important to understand since increased T cell activation is associated with increased HIV
transmission risk and more severe disease. To test the immunological effect of the gut
microbiome in MSM, we transplanted stool from HIV-negative MSW, HIV-negative
high-risk MSM, and HIV-positive MSM to germ-free mice. DNA sequencing showed that
specific microbiome differences associated with MSM were successfully engrafted in
mice, and that these differences were associated with increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
activation in the mice. These results provide evidence for a direct link between micro-
biome composition and immune activation in HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM, and
rationale for investigating the gut microbiome as a risk factor for HIV transmission.
Introduction
Men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise over half of all people living with HIV in the
United States and accounted for 67% of new U.S. infections in 2016 [1]. Prevention and treat-
ment in the MSM population is of high priority in the effort to eradicate HIV/AIDS in the U.S.
Identifying novel biological factors that potentially impact transmission and/or disease in
MSM could open opportunities for unique prevention and treatment strategies.
Recent studies have found that a distinct gut microbiome composition is found in MSM
when compared with heterosexual men (men who have sex with women, MSW) even in the
absence of HIV infection [2–4]. Interestingly, several studies have shown that high-risk HIV-
negative MSM also exhibit immune differences, such as higher blood T cell activation [5],
increased endotoxemia [6], and increased T cell pro-inflammatory cytokine production in
colon mucosa [3], when compared with HIV-negative MSW. Given that the gut microbiome
plays a significant role in shaping the immune system [7], it is possible that the gut micro-
biome differences observed in HIV-negative MSM may be a driving factor of increased
immune activation in this population. Subtler microbiome differences have also been linked
with chronic HIV infection itself when controlling for MSM [2, 4, 8], and previous work from
our group has shown that these subtle differences are associated with stronger stimulation of
immune cells in vitro [8]. How HIV-associated microbiome differences impact immune acti-
vation in vivo remains unknown. Establishing a direct impact of the gut microbiome on
immune activation in HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM may have important implications
for transmission and disease, since vaginal immune activation in women has been associated
with HIV acquisition risk [9–12] and T cell activation is well known to be a correlate of disease
progression in HIV-positive individuals [13]. Whether the gut microbiome may be a risk fac-
tor for HIV transmission in MSM has not been investigated.

Competing interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 Direct causation of immune activation by the microbiome in HIV-negative and HIV-posi-
tive MSM is difficult to demonstrate with human studies, which can be limited to correlational
analyses to establish microbial-immune relationships. Human studies can also be confounded
by factors such as diet, age, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which can be variable across individuals
and populations and may influence both the microbiome and the immune system [14–17].
Deciphering microbiota-associated immune effects in HIV-positive MSM is further compli-
cated by HIV itself, which can cause depletion of critical microbiome-interacting T cells [18, 19]
and stimulate immune activation through TLRs [20]. These challenges raise the need for an in
vivo model to elucidate the immunological impacts of gut microbiota from HIV-negative and
HIV-positive MSM. Mice have been crucial for describing the roles of gut microbiota in health
and disease [21], and offer a controlled system to isolate effects of live, active microbes on the
immune system while excluding effects of lifestyle and HIV itself. In this study, we leveraged
gnotobiotic (germ-free) mice to investigate the immunological impacts of whole fecal transplan-
tation from HIV-negative MSW, HIV-negative MSM, and HIV-positive antiretroviral therapy
(ART)-naïve MSM. We report that mouse fecal recipients recapitulated some of the micro-
biome differences associated with MSM, and that mouse recipients of feces from HIV-negative
and HIV-positive MSM exhibited higher gut T cell activation than recipients of HIV-negative
MSW. We extended our findings from the mouse model to an in vitro HIV infection model,
and found that stimulation of primary human lamina propria cells (LPCs) with isolated fecal
microbiota from either HIV-negative or HIV-positive MSM promoted HIV infection in cell
culture. These results demonstrate the connection between gut microbiota and immune pheno-
types observed in MSM, which may have implications for HIV acquisition and disease.
Results
T cell phenotypes in peripheral blood associated with MSM and HIV
Previous studies have reported higher blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation and higher lev-
els of inflammatory cytokine producing colonic CD8+ T cells in HIV-negative MSM com-
pared with HIV-negative MSW [3, 5, 6]. To confirm these findings in an independent cohort,
we analyzed blood T cell phenotypes in 18 HIV-negative MSW and 19 HIV-negative MSM,
and included 13 HIV-positive untreated MSM as controls since immune activation is well
known to be increased with HIV infection [13, 22, 23] (S1A Table). Increased frequencies of
CD38 HLADR expressing CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, were found in the blood of
HIV-negative MSM compared with HIV-negative MSW (Fig 1A–1C). As expected, HIV-posi-
tive MSM had the highest levels of blood T cell activation. Expression of CD69 on peripheral
blood T cells was also measured (S1A and S1B Fig), and frequencies of CD69+ CD4+ T cells
trended higher for HIV-negative MSM and HIV-positive MSM than HIV-negative MSW,
though this did not reach statistical significance. Stimulated T cells were analyzed for intracel-
lular TNF-α and IFN-γ expression, and significantly higher frequencies of inflammatory cyto-
kine producing T cells were observed in HIV-positive, but not HIV-negative, MSM when
compared with HIV-negative MSW (S1C and S1D Fig). Finally, a lower CD4/CD8 T cell ratio
in the blood has been previously reported for high-risk HIV-negative MSM [6], but was not
reproduced in our cohort (S1F Fig). The CD4/CD8 T cell ratio was expectedly decreased in
HIV-positive MSM who were not receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Gut mucosal T cell activation plays an important role in HIV replication and disease [24].
We therefore evaluated expression of the mucosal homing marker CD103 (also known as
integrin αEβ7) [25] on blood T cells. Frequencies of CD103+ CD4+ T cells were significantly
higher and frequencies of CD103+ CD8+ T cells trended higher in HIV-negative MSM com-
pared with HIV-negative MSW (Fig 1D and 1E). CD103+ CD8+ T cell, but not CD4+ T cell

 frequencies were higher in HIV-positive MSM than in HIV-negative MSW. No significant dif-
ferences were observed in frequencies of CD103+ T cells between HIV-negative and HIV-posi-
tive MSM. Frequencies of CD103+ CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with frequencies of
CD38+ HLADR+ CD8+ T cells (Fig 1F), while expression of HIV coreceptor CCR5 [26]–
which was not significantly different across groups (S1E Fig)–significantly correlated with fre-
quencies of CD103+ CD4+ T cells (Fig 1G). Taken together, previous findings of higher
immune activation in HIV-negative MSM compared with HIV-negative MSW are confirmed
here in our cohort, and our results additionally show an association between blood T cell acti-
vation and mucosal homing in MSW and MSM.
Microbiome differences between MSW and MSM are transferred to mice
through fecal transplant
Microbiome differences have been previously associated with MSM and HIV [2–4, 8], but the
extent to which these differences drive immune activation in vivo is unclear. To directly assess

 the in vivo immunological effect of the gut microbiome from HIV-negative and HIV-positive
MSM, we transplanted feces from human donors to gnotobiotic mice. Each mouse received a
single gavage of feces from a unique human donor. Stool donors were 16 HIV-negative MSW,
19 HIV-negative MSM, and 12 HIV-positive ART-naïve MSM randomly selected from a pre-
viously described cohort [4]. Of these donors, 13 HIV-negative MSW, 17 HIV-negative MSM,
and 9 HIV-positive MSM are represented in the above immune data (Fig 1, S1 Table). HIV-
positive MSM donors had a median viral load of 101400 copies/ml with a median CD4 T cell
count of 574 cells/μl (S1 Table). Each donor was tested in a single mouse recipient, with the
exception of 4 HIV-negative MSW, 8 HIV-negative MSM, and 4 HIV-positive MSM which
were randomly chosen to be tested in 2–3 replicate mice. A subset of donors was also tested for
fecal bacterial load (8 HIV-negative MSW, 12 HIV-negative MSM, 11 HIV-positive MSM),
which was not found to be significantly different across donor groups (Fig 2B), indicating that
each recipient group did not receive a significantly higher or lower amount of bacteria in the
fecal transplant.
We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on donor fecal samples and fecal pellets from
mouse recipients at 7, 14, and 21 days post-gavage. Since there was little variation in composi-
tion of the mice over time (S2 Fig), we focused our analysis on the terminal timepoint. Consis-
tent with previous reports [2, 4, 8], unweighted UniFrac analysis showed that microbiome
composition in the human donors (large circles) clustered distinctly by MSM and not HIV sta-
tus (Fig 2C). Although the overall composition shifted along PC1 following fecal transfer, the
distinct clustering of MSW and MSM along the PC2 axis was replicated in the mouse recipi-
ents (small circles), which are connected to their respective donors by lines (Fig 2C). Six 16S
rRNA sequence variants were identified to be significantly different (with an FDR corrected p-
value<0.1) between HIV-negative MSW and HIV-negative MSM recipients, 3 of which
increased (Desulfovibrio sp., Holdemanella biformis, Howardella ureilytica) and 3 of which
decreased (Clostridium sp., Bacteroides uniformis, Flavonifractor sp.) with MSM (S2 Table).
Five of six of these variants were also found to be significantly different between HIV-negative
MSW and HIV-negative MSM donors (S2 Table). Holdemanella biformis (formerly Eubacte-
rium biforme) and Bacteroides uniformis have also previously been described to be different
with MSM [4, 8]. In contrast, no statistically significant differences (FDR p<0.1) in variant
abundance were detected between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM donors or recipients,
and previously reported bacteria differing with HIV in analyses of larger cohorts [2, 4] were
not observed in this smaller donor sample size (S3 Table). These data suggest that MSM-asso-
ciated microbiome differences are readily transferred to mice through fecal transplant, while
transfer of subtler HIV-associated differences may require an increased sample of donors.
The natural gut microbiome in mice is compositionally different from that in humans [27],
therefore changes in relative abundance of microbes less or better adapted to the mouse gut
were expected to occur following fecal transfer. To characterize microbiome shifts following
colonization of mice, we identified bacterial families that significantly increased or decreased
in relative abundance from donors to recipients. When analyzing all groups together (HIV-
negative MSW, HIV-negative MSM, HIV-positive MSM), 25 families significantly changed
(FDR p<0.1) as determined by nonparametric t-test comparing donors to recipients (S4
Table). These consisted of 19 families that decreased and 7 families that increased in relative
abundance in recipients compared with donors. When stratifying the analyses by group, differ-
ences between donors and recipients for 20/25 families maintained consistent trends within
each group, and differences for 11/25 families maintained statistical significance within each
group (S4 Table). A striking donor-to-recipient change was the relative abundance of Prevotel-
laceae, which was significantly higher in MSM compared with MSW (Fig 2C) [2–4], and
decreased in abundance for all groups following transfer (S4 Table). Taxa bar charts showing

 donors and recipients grouped separately (Fig 2D), or donors and their respective recipients
side-by-side (S3 Fig), demonstrate the overall loss of Prevotellaceae in mice. Though Prevotella-
ceae was undetectable in almost all mouse recipients of HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM
donors, it maintained a strong presence in the two mouse recipients of Prevotellaceae-rich
HIV-negative MSW donors (Fig 2D, S3 Fig). One reason that there may be colonization differ-
ences in MSW versus MSM recipients is the presence of different species or strains of Prevo-
tella. We thus sought to explore whether different sequence variants within the Prevotella
genus showed different colonization patterns. In the two mice that Prevotella successfully colo-
nized, we identified only three Prevotella sequence variants to be present and all were classified
as Prevotella copri (S4A Fig). Two out of three P. copri variants were of the highest abundance
in MSW donors (S4B Fig), and increased in relative abundance from donors to mice. The
third variant was the dominant and most abundant Prevotella sequence in both MSW and
MSM donors, but only colonized recipients of MSW. Six other P. copri sequence variants that
were present in at least 20% of MSM donors were identified, and only three of these could be
found in Prevotella-rich MSW. None of these other six sequence variants were detectable in
mouse recipients (S4 Fig). To investigate the ability of Prevotella to colonize mice in the
absence of competing microbes, we gavaged gnotobiotic mice (n = 3) with a monoculture of P.
copri (DSMZ 18205) or with a monoculture B. uniformis (ATCC 8492) for comparison (Fig
2D). By 16S gene sequence, the P. copri monoculture was determined to be the same variant as
P. copri 3 found in fecal donors and their recipients. After 21 days of colonization, sequencing
showed that P. copri was still present in feces of 2/3 mice, while B. uniformis was present in 3/3
mice (Fig 2D). Thus, three P. copri variants were able to colonize mice, with two of these vari-
ants being at a higher relative abundance in Prevotella-rich MSW than in MSM. The third vari-
ant, which was the dominant variant in both MSW and MSM, could only successfully colonize
mice in pure culture or in the context of an MSW microbiome.
Since MSM have more Prevotella than MSW, we next investigated whether the inability of
Prevotella to colonize mouse recipients of MSM resulted in a larger magnitude donor-to-recip-
ient compositional shift for MSM. Unweighted Unifrac distance, a measurement of relative
compositional difference, between each donor and their recipient was calculated. For donors
with replicate mouse recipients, a representative mouse was randomly selected. Donor-recipi-
ent distances were not found to be significantly different across groups, indicating the overall
composition of each donor group was altered on average by the same magnitude after transfer
(S5A Fig). The percentages of unique sequence variants identified in each donor that were
present in their mouse recipient were also not significantly different across groups, indicating
equal colonization fidelity (S5B Fig). Despite the loss of taxa that differed with MSM following
transfer, differences in specific microbes were recapitulated in mouse recipients to maintain
distinct MSW and MSM compositions. Any immunological differences between recipient
groups would therefore be associated with these compositional differences.

 lymph nodes were evaluated for markers of T cell activation. Due to lower cell recovery, only
colons from a subset of mice (8 HIV-negative MSW, 10 HIV-negative MSM, 9 HIV-positive
MSM) yielded enough cells for analysis by flow cytometry. Ileum tissues from all mice were
analyzed and are highly relevant to HIV infection due to the small intestine’s abundance of
Th17 cells [28], which are targets of HIV infection and play an important role in disease [18].
CD69 and CD103 were used to measure gut T cell activation, and though lowly expressed in
the blood [29], these are relevant markers in the gut, and are used to define tissue-resident
memory T cells retained in gut tissue [30, 31]. For stools that were tested in replicate mice,
immune data from one replicate was used for each stool. In the ileum, frequencies of CD69+
CD8+ T cells were found to be significantly higher in mouse recipients of HIV-negative MSM
compared with mouse recipients of HIV-negative MSW (Fig 3B). Frequencies of CD103+ T
cells were significantly elevated for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the ileum of recipients of
HIV-negative MSM (Fig 3C and 3D). Interestingly, ileum frequencies of CD69+ or CD103+ T
cells were not significantly different between recipients of HIV-negative and HIV-positive
MSM, and only CD103+ CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in recipients of HIV-positive
MSM compared with recipients of HIV-negative MSW (Fig 3D). Finally, stool recipients that
were successfully colonized with Prevotella did not display noticeably different levels of
immune activation compared to the MSW group median (S7B Fig).
In colon tissue, frequencies of CD69+ CD4+ T cells were significantly higher for recipients
of HIV-negative MSM than recipients of HIV-negative MSW (Fig 3E). Recipients of HIV-pos-
itive MSM did not statistically differ from recipients of HIV-negative MSM or HIV-negative
MSW in colonic T cell activation, but did trend higher for frequencies of CD69+ CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells, and CD103+ CD8+ T cells, compared with either HIV-negative group (Fig 3E,
S6 Fig). Statistical power in detecting differences in the colon may have been limited by a small
sample size and a high variance of immune measures. We therefore examined mesenteric
lymph nodes (mLN), which were analyzed for all mouse recipients, as a proxy of gut immune
phenotypes since the mLN drain ileum and colon tissues [32]. In the mLN, mouse recipients
of HIV-positive MSM displayed significantly higher frequencies of effector memory (Tem)
CD4+ T cells (CD62L-, CD44+) than recipients of HIV-negative MSW (Fig 4A). Furthermore,
frequencies of CD4+ Tem in the mLN significantly correlated with frequencies of CD69+ CD4
+ T cells in the colon (Fig 4B), indicating mLN phenotypes were representative of immune
readouts in colon tissue. In mLN of monocolonized mice, which were also examined at 21
days post gavage, CD4+ Tem frequencies were within the range detected in stool recipients,
and did not differ between mice gavaged with B. uniformis and mice gavaged with P. copri
(S7A Fig).
Overall, mouse recipients displayed a significant MSM-associated effect in immune activa-
tion in the gut. Recipients of MSM also tended to have higher variation in T cell measures,
with CD103+ CD4+ T cell frequencies in the ileum (Fig 3D) and CD69+ CD4+ T cell frequen-
cies in the colon (Fig 3E) being significantly different in variance as determined by F test
between HIV-negative MSM and HIV-negative MSW. Despite the lack of a significant HIV-
associated effect, immunological differences between MSW and MSM recipients were enough
to drive significant immune correlations between donors and recipients, including a correla-
tion between frequencies of recipient ileum CD69+ CD8+ T cells and frequencies of donor
blood CD38+ HLADR+ CD8+ T cells (S8A Fig), and a correlation between frequencies of
recipient colon CD69+ CD4+ T cells and frequencies of HIV-negative donor blood CD103+
CD4+ T cells (S8B Fig). These correlations highlight immunological similarities between
donors and their recipients.
Elevated markers of gut mucosal damage have been reported for MSM and correlated with
MSM-associated microbiota [3, 6], and are well known to be associated with HIV infection

 [33]. To determine if bacteria from the fecal transfer directly caused intestinal damage, ileum
and colon tissue samples from 5 HIV-negative MSW, 7 HIV-negative MSM, and 6 HIV-posi-
tive MSM mouse recipients were analyzed for histopathology. Tissue health and epithelial
integrity was determined to be within normal limits for all mice examined (Fig 5A). Each
tissue analyzed was graded with an overall inflammation score on a scale of 1–4 [34], and all
tissues were assigned the same minimum inflammation rating of 1. In support of this, myelo-
peroxidase concentrations (measured in 12 HIV-negative MSW, 11 HIV-negative MSM, and
11 HIV-positive MSM recipients) were not different across groups in the colon (Fig 5B). Levels
of soluble CD14 (sCD14) in the blood, a marker of monocyte activation in response to LPS
[35] and bacterial translocation across the gut barrier [33], was measured in 11 HIV-negative
MSW, 15 HIV-negative MSM, and 9 HIV-positive MSM recipients, and was also not found to
be significantly different across groups (Fig 5C). Lack of signs of barrier damage suggest that
transfer of microbiota from HIV-negative or HIV-positive men were not sufficient to cause
gut tissue injury in mice (at least within 3 weeks of colonization), and that barrier breakdown
was not necessary for microbiota from MSM to promote gut T cell activation.

 Recapitulation of microbial and immune differences in mouse recipients supports a link
between microbiome composition and immune activation in MSM. Microbial-immune corre-
lations consistent across donors and recipients would further strengthen this link. We there-
fore correlated the relative abundance of gut microbes in donors and recipients with their

 respective immune data (S5 and S6 Tables). Only immune data significantly different with
MSM in either donors or recipients were selected for analyses, since only MSM-associated
microbiome differences were detectable in this cohort. Frequencies of blood CD103+ CD8
+ T cells in donors, though not significantly different with MSM, were additionally selected
for analysis due to their relevance to the gut. Correlations were computed with both the full
donor group, as well as with HIV-negative donors only, since HIV may independently drive
immune activation in HIV-positive MSM and confound microbial correlations. All correla-
tions that were and were not significant in donors and in mice are shown in tables S5
(donors) and S6 (recipients). After comparing significant correlations across these datasets,
we identified 8 microbes that correlated with at least one donor and one recipient immune
measurement (Table 1), with 3 of these being negative and 5 of these being positive corre-
lates. Out of these 8 microbes, 5 significantly correlated using the full donor cohort, while 3
significantly correlated using only HIV-negative donors. Two microbes, Bacteroides unifor-
mis and Howardella ureilytica, significantly differed in relative abundance with MSM in
both donors and recipients (S2 Table), and also significantly correlated with immune

 measurements in both donors and recipients. Though few of the shared microbe-immune
correlates were statistically significant with FDR correction, consistency of correlations
across humans and mice suggest biological significance, and provide further evidence that
immune activation in MSM is influenced by the gut microbiome.
Microbiota from HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM stimulate in vitro
HIV infection
T cell activation has been correlated with HIV viral load [13], and associated with HIV
transmission in women [36]. We therefore investigated whether microbiota from MSM
could promote HIV infection in vitro. Fecal bacterial communities (FBCs) were isolated
from stools of 12 HIV-negative MSW, 15 HIV-negative MSM, and 9 HIV-positive MSM by
separating whole intact bacteria in stool from debris using Histodenz columns as previously
described [8]. All donors of stool used for FBC isolation are represented in the PBMC
immune phenotyping data (Fig 1), while FBCs from 7 HIV-negative MSW, 15 HIV-negative
MSM, and 5 HIV-positive MSM were also used as donors in the fecal transplant experi-
ments. HIV-positive individuals used for FBC isolation had a median viral load of 47650
copies/ml and a median CD4 T cell count of 577 cells/μl (S1 Table). Primary human lamina
propria cells (LPCs) were stimulated by isolated FBCs, infected with HIVbal, and intracellu-
lar HIVgag antigen expression was measured after five days. We found that LPCs stimulated
with FBCs from HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM had higher frequencies of HIV-
infected cells compared with LPCs stimulated with microbiota from HIV-negative MSW
(Fig 6A and 6B). LPCs stimulated with FBCs from HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM
displayed significantly elevated CD8+ T cell activation at the end of infection (Fig 6C), and
frequencies of HIV-infected cells significantly correlated with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
activation of stimulated LPCs (Fig 6D and 6E). FBCs from 7 HIV-negative MSW, 11 HIV-
negative MSM, and 8 HIV-positive MSM used in this infection assay were also previously
used to stimulate PBMC in vitro [8], and frequencies of HIV-infected cells induced by these
FBCs significantly correlated with activation levels of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells stimulated by these same FBCs found previously (S8B and S8C Fig). 16S rRNA gene
sequencing of FBCs showed that the compositional distinction between MSW and MSM
was maintained following bacterial isolation (S9A and S9C Fig). Unweighted UniFrac dis-
tances between donor samples and their isolated FBCs were not significantly different
across groups (S9B Fig), indicating the average magnitude of stool-FBC compositional shifts
were consistent between groups. Specific bacteria that differed with MSM and with HIV in
FBCs, and bacteria that significantly changed from stool to FBCs, were previously described
[8], and are not presented here. Infection and T cell activation levels trended higher for cells
stimulated with HIV-positive MSM FBCs than cells stimulated with HIV-negative MSM
FBCs, though these differences were not statistically significant. Finally, six microbes that
significantly correlated with in vitro HIV infection also correlated with fecal transplant
donor and/or recipient immune measurements (Table 1). Interestingly, two sequence vari-
ants of H. biformis correlated with in vitro infection, with one significantly correlating with
donor blood T cell activation and the other significantly correlating with recipient gut T cell
activation. Significant and non-significant correlations between all 16S sequence variants in
FBCs with in vitro HIV infection are shown in S7 Table. Consistencies were therefore
observed between the in vivo transplant system and the in vitro assays. These data support
the findings from the mouse model, and suggest that the gut microbiome in HIV-negative
and HIV-positive MSM could impact HIV infection.

 Discussion
Immune differences previously associated with MSM were reproduced in our cohort of fecal
donors. We showed elevated blood frequencies of activated CD38+ HLADR+ CD8+ T cells in
HIV-negative MSM compared with HIV-negative MSW as previously described [5], as well as
increased frequencies of CD103+ CD4+ T cells in HIV-negative MSM, which to our knowl-
edge, is a novel finding. Frequencies of CD103+ CD4+ T cells also correlated with frequencies
of CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, suggesting an association between gut homing and CCR5 expression
in MSM. Other previously reported immune phenotypes in MSM, such as increased frequen-
cies of gut mucosal Th17 cells and IFN-γ+ TNF-α+ CD8+ T cells [3], increased endotoxemia,
and lower blood CD4/CD8 ratios [6] were either not observed or not measured in our cohort.
A limitation of our study was the unavailability of immune data from gut tissues in our donors,
which would have indeed strengthened associations between our donors and mice. However,

 our observations in mice are well supported by previous findings of gut T cell activation in
MSM [3]. Overall, immune differences associated with MSM in our study were subtle and
observed in a small sample size, though the magnitude of these differences reflects what others
have found. The subtlety of these differences is also unsurprising, since our cohort of high-risk
MSM were healthy individuals without disease. Taken together, the blood T cell profiling pre-
sented here has reproduced and expanded on previous knowledge of immune phenotypes
associated with MSM, and further emphasize the importance of controlling for MSM in
immunological analyses of HIV-positive populations.
Microbiome differences previously associated with MSM were also replicated in our donor
cohort (Fig 2C), including increases in Prevotellaceae, decreases in Bacteroidaceae [2–4], and
changes in specific bacterial species such as Holdemanella biformis and Bacteroides uniformis
(S3 Table) [4, 8, 37]. However, previously reported microbiome differences between HIV-neg-
ative and HIV-positive MSM, such as increased abundance of Turicibacter sanguinis with HIV
[4, 8], were not observed in our cohort. Given these results, it was unsurprising that recipient
mice reproduced microbiome differences associated with MSM, but showed no significant
microbiome differences between recipients of HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. Immune
activation differences in mouse recipients largely reflected the microbiome composition, with
an apparent significant increase in T cell activation associated with recipients of MSM. Immu-
nological differences between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM recipients were less clear.
Though CD4+ T cell activation in the colon trended higher for recipients of feces from HIV-
positive MSM compared with HIV-negative MSM (Fig 3E), this did not reach statistical signif-
icance. These trends reflect our previously published results showing FBCs from HIV-positive
MSM could promote higher in vitro T cell activation than FBCs from HIV-negative MSM [8],
and suggest that a larger sample size of donors is needed to investigate immunological differ-
ences between mouse recipients of feces from HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. How-
ever, a small sample size may only partially explain why a significant effect of HIV-associated
microbiota was not observed in this study, either in mice or in the in vitro infection experi-
ments. In mice, it is possible that HIV-associated microbiota of immunological importance
may not have colonized. Furthermore, loss of epithelial integrity is a hallmark of HIV infection
and was not evident in these mice. Modeling barrier breakdown in mouse recipients may
therefore reveal effects of HIV-associated microbiome differences in the context of HIV-
induced disease. In the in vitro infection experiments, one finding from our previous work was
that differences between HIV-negative MSW and HIV-negative MSM in in vitro activation of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected when stimulations were performed with non-auto-
claved FBCs but not autoclaved FBCs, whereas the differences in HIV-positive versus HIV-
negative MSM were strongly evident with the autoclaved FBCs. Autoclaving was done to
ensure that bacteria were killed and that no sporadic growth of antibiotic resistant, aerotoler-
ant bacteria occurred. However, autoclaving could have potentially denatured immune-modu-
latory compounds. The in vitro infection data from this study used non-autoclaved FBCs.
Taken together these results suggest that there are differences in the molecular mechanisms of
immune activation in HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM, with those in HIV-positive MSM
being more driven by molecular factors that are heat-tolerant.
T cell activation in stool donors and recipients were detected with different markers (CD38
and HLADR in donors, and CD69 and CD103 in recipients) in different compartments (blood
and gut), but these markers may have identified related cell populations commonly influenced
by gut microbes. In support of this, gut T cell activation in mice significantly correlated with
blood T cell activation in donors, and the same bacteria consistently correlated with both
donor and mouse immune measurements. Several of these microbial correlates have been pre-
viously associated with disease and/or known to have immune-modulating potential. This

 includes Holdemanella biformis (formerly known as Eubacterium biforme), which is increased
with MSM in donors and recipients, and has been previously associated with stimulation of
inflammatory cytokine production and correlated with T cell activation in vitro [8, 38]. Bacter-
oides uniformis, a Treg and IL10 inducer [39] that has been found to be reduced in patients
with Crohn’s disease [40], is also reduced with MSM in our donors and recipients. Akkerman-
sia muciniphila, a mucolytic bacteria associated with health and disease depending on context,
has been found to be reduced in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease [41], and
was negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in recipient colons and mucosal homing
CD8+ T cells in donor blood. Finally, Desulfovibrio piger, a sulfate-reducing bacteria associated
with inflammatory bowel disease [42], was positively correlated with gut homing T cells in
recipients and donors. Thus, bacteria correlated with immune function in our dataset is con-
sistent with previous findings. Organisms identified in these correlations are ideal candidates
for further investigation of their immune-modulating properties in HIV-negative and HIV-
positive MSM.
Transfer of the microbiome from human donors to mice was imperfect, as significant dif-
ferences between MSW and MSM were not reproduced in the mice. Chief among these was
Prevotella, which was lost from recipients of MSM but not recipients of MSW. Though two of
the P. copri sequence variants identified may be unique features of Prevotella-rich MSW that
are better adapted for mice, the inability of the third variant to colonize mice in the context of
an MSM microbiome suggests that the broader community structure, which is different
between MSM and Prevotella-rich non-MSM [4], influences Prevotella colonization. Since Pre-
votella has been associated with inflammation in other studies, including being positively cor-
related with gut immune activation in HIV-positive individuals [43], and being associated
with rheumatoid arthritis [44], successful colonization in recipients of MSM stool may have
driven an even larger effect of immune activation. Alternatively, Prevotella may not be a major
influencer of immune activation, since it did not induce noticeably higher activation in either
monocolonized mice or Prevotella-rich MSW fecal recipients. Additionally, Prevotella variants
were also not identified as significant correlates with immune measurements in donor blood.
Another intriguing hypothesis is that Prevotella may only promote inflammation in a diseased
state. Indeed, in mice with DSS-induced colitis, the presence of P. copri (identical to P. copri
variant 3 in this study) led to more severe inflammation [45]. Inducing colitis to mimic gut dis-
ease during HIV infection in mouse recipients of Prevotella-rich MSW may reveal similar
effects. Importantly, these results demonstrate that despite prominent microbiome differences
like Prevotella abundance not being reproduced in mouse recipients, compositional distinction
between MSW and MSM was maintained in mice by successful transfer of critical immune-
modulating bacteria.
The ability of microbiota from HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM to promote HIV
infection in vitro suggests that the gut microbiome composition could contribute to HIV infec-
tion and disease progression in MSM. There is evidence that the vaginal microbiome is a risk
factor for HIV transmission in women: vaginal bacteria modulate immune activation in vagi-
nal tissue [9], bacterial vaginosis has been linked to vaginal HIV transmission [11, 12], and
specific microbes in the vaginal microbiome have been associated with inflammation and
increased HIV acquisition [36]. Thus, it is possible that the gut microbiome may also contrib-
ute to risk in MSM by promoting immune activation in gut tissues. Increased frequencies of
CD69+ and CD103+ T cells in mouse recipients of MSM suggest there are more tissue-resi-
dent memory CD4+ T cells in the gut [31], and memory CD4+ T cells are known to be the pri-
mary targets of HIV infection [46]. Though these cells were assessed in the ileum and colon
rather than the rectum, it is clear they are driven by the gut microbiome–which was linked to
both rectal T cell activation and rectal SHIV transmission in macaques [47]. Furthermore, gut

 microbes that correlated with T cell measures in the ileum and colon of mouse recipients also
correlated with in vitro HIV infection. Therefore, microbes that influence T cell activation along
the length of the gut likely also impact HIV infection at the specific site of transmission. These
findings are strong rationale for conducting longitudinal studies examining the association
between gut microbiome composition and HIV transmission in populations of high-risk MSM.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence of a direct link between the gut microbiome
and immune activation observed in high-risk MSM, by demonstrating that both microbiome
and immune phenotypes in MSM donors are transferrable to mouse recipients through fecal
transplantation. Mice were receptive of colonization by key immune-influencing microbes
that induced immunological differences associated with MSM donors, suggesting the gut
microbiome influences immune activation in MSM.
Materials and methods
Study subjects
Stool samples were obtained from HIV-negative MSW, high-risk HIV-negative MSM, and HIV-
positive MSM not on antiretroviral therapy. Male HIV-positive individuals enrolled in the study
were determined to be MSM using a behavioral questionnaire. High-risk MSM were recruited
from a high-risk cohort assembled for a study of a candidate HIV-1 preventative vaccine [48].
Designation of high-risk was according to a number of different behaviors including 1) a history
of unprotected anal intercourse with one or more male or male-to-female transgender partners
2) anal intercourse with two or more male or male-to-female transgender partners and 3) being
in a sexual relationship with a person who has been diagnosed with HIV. All enrolled individuals
live in metropolitan Denver. Other inclusion criteria used were: 18–70 years old, body mass
index (BMI) between 21–29 mg/kg2 and weight stable for at least 3 months; for HIV-positive
individuals, <10 days of ART treatment at any time, or previously on ART but off treatment for
the previous 6 months, prior to stool and blood collection; liver and kidney function tests within
normal range. Exclusion criteria used were: weight <110 pounds; received antibiotics within the
prior 90 days; active gastrointestinal disease; history of bowel resection. All subjects used in this
study were previously characterized for diet and sexual behavior as part of a larger cohort; diet or
any particular sexual behavior that we measured were not identified as driving factors of the
most prominent microbiome differences between MSM and MSW [4].
Ethics statement
Written informed consent was obtained from healthy HIV-negative and HIV-positive individ-
uals for use of stool. The study protocol was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institution
Review Board (COMIRB No: 14–1595). All subjects were adults. Mice were handled in accor-
dance with the recommendations in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and protocols were approved by the University of Colorado Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee Permit Number 00097. Primary human lamina pro-
pria cells were collected from otherwise discarded tissues from gut resection surgery, and was
determined to not be human subject research under protocol number 14–1184 approved by
the University of Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. Tissues were obtained from
anonymous adult patients who were not asked for consent.
PBMC immune phenotyping
PBMC were isolated from patient blood by Ficoll-Paque (GE), and cryopreserved and stored
in liquid nitrogen before analysis. PBMC were thawed, and 5 x 105 cells were stained for 30

 min at 4˚ C with the following antibodies: CD3-APC-Cy7 (OKT3, Biolegend), CD4-PerCP-
Cy5.5 (OKT4, Biolegend), CD8-APC (SK1, Biolegend), CD38-BV421 (HIT2, Biolegend),
CD69-BV510 (FN50, Biolegend), HLADR-FITC (L243, Biolegend), CD103-PE (BerACT8,
Biolegend), CCR5-PE-Cy7 (J418F2, Biolegend). Cells were then washed in FACS buffer and
fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before being acquired on a BD FACS Canto II. 1 x 106 PBMC
were stimulated with a PMA/ionomycin cell stimulation cocktail (eBioscience), and treated
with a protein transport inhibitor cocktail (eBioscience) for 4 h at 37˚ C, 5% CO2. Cells were
then stained for 30 min at 4˚ C with the following antibodies: CD3-APC-Cy7 (OKT3, Biole-
gend), CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (OKT4, Biolegend), CD8-APC (SK1, Biolegend). Cells were washed
and treated with fix/perm buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4˚ C, before being stained for
intracellular cytokines for 30 min at 4˚ C with the following antibodies: IFN-γ-PE (4SB3, Biole-
gend), TNFα-APC-Cy7 (MAb11, Biolegend). Cells were then washed in FACS buffer and
fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before being acquired on a BD FACS Canto II.
Gavages
1.5 grams of frozen feces stored at -80˚ C for up to one year from each donor was thawed in an
anaerobic chamber and homogenized in 3 ml of anaerobic PBS, using a syringe handle. Fecal
solutions were then filtered through a 100 μm nylon filter into a 50 ml conical tube. Tubes
were sealed before removing from the anaerobic chamber and transferred to the mouse facility
within 1 hour of thawing. 200 μl of each fecal solution was used to gavage each mouse.
Bacterial load in donor stool
2 mg of stool from donors were homogenized in PBS, and bacteria were then isolated using
two sequential rounds of sucrose density centrifugation. Isolated bacterial cells were stained
with thiazol orange and propidium iodide, and acquired by a FACS Canto II (BD) flow cytom-
eter in the presence of counting beads. Data were processed using Flowjo software, and the
concentration of live bacterial cells per mg of stool was calculated.
Gnotobiotic mice
Germ-free C57/BL6 mice were purchased from Taconic and bred and maintained in flexible
film isolator bubbles. Male mice between 6–8 weeks of age were gavaged with fecal solutions
prepared from donor fecal samples and housed individually (to ensure mice would not con-
taminate each other) following gavage for 3 weeks in a Tecniplast iso-positive caging system,
with each cage having HEPA filters and positive pressurization for bioexclusion. Feces were
collected from mice at day 0 for 16S rRNA gene sequencing to confirm germ-free status. 16S
sequencing of feces from day 7 and day 14 showed relatively little variation in composition
from day 21 (S2 Fig). Mice were euthanized at 21 days post gavage using isoflurane overdose
and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Blood from euthanized animals was collected
using cardiac puncture and cells were pelleted in K2-EDTA tubes; plasma was then aliquoted
and stored at -80˚ C. Data was combined from 10 batches of mice analyzed independently,
with at least 4 mice per batch, and at least two donor groups represented in each batch.
Mouse ileum and colon single cell preparation
Ileum and colon tissues from mice at 21 days post gavage were collected for immune pheno-
typing and histology. Tissues were dissected length-wise and feces were washed away using
PBS. 1–5 mm slices of ileum and colon closest to the cecum were taken from a subset of mice

 washed in a PBS solution containing 1% EDTA for two 5 min intervals on a vortexer. Tissues
were washed with PBS and strained through a 100 μm nylon filter in between intervals. Tissues
were then washed for a third time in plain 1X PBS. Tissues were then minced using an octo-
MACs tissue dissociator (Miltenyi) and digested in 2.5 ml of a solution of complete RPMI
(10% FBS, 1% PSG) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase D type I (Worthington Biotech) at 37˚ C,
5% CO2. Released cells were quenched with cold complete media, filtered through a 70 μm
nylon filter and washed with complete media before staining for flow cytometry.
Mouse immune phenotyping
0.5–1 x 106 ileum and colon cells from each mouse were stained in FACS buffer for 30 min at
4˚ C with the following antibodies: CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (17A2, Biolegend), CD4-FITC (RM4-4,
eBioscience), CD8-BV510 (53–6.7, Biolegend), CD69-PE-Cy7 (h1.2F3, eBioscience), CD103-
PE-Dazzle-594 (2E7, Biolegend). Mesenteric lymph node cells were additionally stained
with CD44-AlexaFluor-700 (IM7, eBioscience), and CD62L-APC-eFluor780 (MEL-14,
eBioscience). Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde
before being acquired on a BD LSRii flow cytometer. Colon samples that had less than 1,000 T
cells were excluded. Plasma samples were thawed and diluted 1:10 before being assayed for
sCD14 by ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ileum and
colon tissues cultured for 24 h at 37˚ C, 5% CO2 in complete RPMI were digested with CellLy-
tic MT solution with proteinase inhibitor (SIGMA), and assayed for myeloperoxidase concen-
trations by ELISA (R&D Systems). ELISA plates were read using a Vmax Kinetic plate reader
(Molecular Devices). Tissue sections from the distal end of the ileum and proximal end of the
colon were processed for histology and H&E stained. Scoring [34] was performed by a pathol-
ogist blinded to experimental conditions.
Stool collection and FBC preparation
Stool samples were collected by the patient, both on a sterile swab and with a sterile scoop
within 48 hours of a clinic visit. Samples were stored immediately in a cooler with -20˚C
freezer packs. After delivery to the clinic, the swab was subsequently stored at -80˚ C to await
DNA extraction. Isolation of fecal bacterial communites (FBCs) from stool was described pre-
viously [8]. Briefly, two grams of feces were homogenized in sterile PBS and filtered through a
100uM filter. Homogenate was then subjected to two density gradient centrifugations with
80% Histodenz (Sigma). Bacterial layers were collected after each spin, visualized with a light
microscope, and quantified by flow cytometry using a bead counting kit (BD Biosciences).
FBCs were stored at -80˚ C before use in in vitro assays.
16S rRNA gene sequencing
16S rRNA targeted sequencing was conducted according to earth microbiome project stan-
dard protocols (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org). DNA was extracted from donor stool
swabs, mouse fecal pellets, and from a 250 μL aliquot of FBC isolates using the standard Power-
Soil protocol (QIAGEN). PCR amplification of the extracted DNA, along with water controls,
was conducted with barcoded primers targeting the V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene (515F-
806R; FWD:GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA; REV:GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT).
Amplified DNA was quantified using a PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen) so equal amounts of
DNA from each sample could be pooled and cleaned using the UltraClean PCR Clean-up pro-
tocol (Qiagen). The final DNA pool was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform (San
Diego, CA) using the V2 2x250 kit.

 Sequencing analysis
Raw sequences were assigned to samples based on their barcodes using QIIME 2.6 [49]. The
libraries were denoised and grouped by sequence variants using dada2 1.2.2. Samples con-
tained from 21,357 to 159,296 sequences; analyses that contained donor and mouse recipient
feces were conducted on the standardized sequence number of 21,357, analyses that contained
FBC isolates and their original stool were conducted on the standardized sequence number of
21,812, and analyses that contained mice monocolonized with P. copri and B. uniformis were
conducted on the standardized sequence number of 31,812 –these numbers were determined
as the minimum read number acquired for a single sample in each independent analysis.
Sequence variants were classified taxonomically using the RDP classifier [50] trained on the
greengenes 3_8 taxonomic database [51]. Principal Coordinates Analysis of unweighted Uni-
Frac distance matrices, and rendering of taxa bar charts, were conducted using QIIME 2.6. For
immune correlations, comparisons of relative abundance between groups, and P. copri variant
analysis, sequence variants not observed in at least 20% of the samples in each analysis were
removed.
LPC collection
Macroscopically healthy jejunum tissues from patients undergoing elective gut resection sur-
gery were digested to release lamina propria cells (LPCs). Briefly, tissues were trimmed of fat
and the muscularis layer was removed using scissors. Trimmed tissues were incubated on a
rocker with a 1.6 mM dithiolthreitol (DTT) PBS solution for 45 min at 37˚ C, and then with a
1 mM EDTA PBS solution for 60 min at 37˚ C. Tissues were then washed with PBS on a vor-
texer, minced using scissors, and incubated for three 45 min intervals with a digestion solution
of complete RPMI (10% HS, 1% PSG) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich) and
10 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). Released cells were collected and filtered through a 70 μm
nylon filter after each digestion interval. Cells from each interval were pooled together, RBC
lysed, and cryopreserved.
In vitro LPC infection
LPCs were thawed in complete RPMI containing 10 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich), and
washed again with complete RPMI before plating. 5 x 105 LPCs were plated per well in a
96-well round bottom plate. Bacterial cells were added to specified wells at 5:1 bacteria:LPC
ratio. HIVbal passaged in Molt4 T cells and quantified by qPCR were then added to each well
at 107 HIV RNA copies/well. Cells were incubated at 37˚ C for 24 h to allow for infection, and
then washed twice with complete RPMI to remove cell-free virus. Bacteria were added back to
each well at a 5:1 ratio after washing, and cells were incubated for another 4 days at 37˚ C.
LPCs were then stained with anti-CD3-APC-Cy7, CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD8-APC, HLADR-
FITC, CD38-BV421, CD69-BV510, and CCR5-PE-Cy7. Cells were then washed and treated
with fix/perm buffer (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4˚ C, and stained with anti-HIVgag-PE
(KC57, Fisher) for 1 h at 4˚ C. Cells were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and acquired
using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Unstimulated, uninfected cells were
used as controls to gate on HIVgag+ cells.
Statistics
Immune data were compared between groups using t-tests if data from both groups passed the
D’Agostino and Pearson normality test, and Mann-Whitney tests if data from at least one
group did not pass the normality test. All immune data were analyzed using Prism 7

 (Graphpad). Comparisons of bacterial relative abundances between groups were performed
using non-parametric t-tests on non-transformed data. Spearman correlations were used for
all correlation analyses. Replicate recipient mice were treated as independent observations for
all microbiome comparisons and correlations. Corrected p-values were determined with the
False Discovery Rate (FDR) technique of Benjamini and Hochberg. All statistical analyses
involving 16S sequencing data were performed using QIIME 1.9.
