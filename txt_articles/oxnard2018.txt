IMPORTANCE Osimertinib mesylate is used globally to treat EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) with tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M
mutation. Acquired resistance to osimertinib is a growing clinical challenge that is poorly
understood.
OBJECTIVE To understand the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib
and their clinical behavior.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients with advanced NSCLC who received
osimertinib for T790M-positive acquired resistance to prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
were identified from a multi-institutional cohort (n = 143) and a confirmatory trial cohort
(NCT01802632) (n = 110). Next-generation sequencing of tumor biopsies after osimertinib
resistance was performed. Genotyping of plasma cell-free DNA was studied as an orthogonal
approach, including serial plasma samples when available. The study and analysis were
finalized on November 9, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mechanisms of resistance and their association with time to
treatment discontinuation on osimertinib.
RESULTS Of the 143 patients evaluated, 41 (28 [68%] women) had tumor next-generation
sequencing after acquired resistance to osimertinib. Among 13 patients (32%) with
maintained T790M at the time of resistance, EGFR C797S was seen in 9 patients (22%).
Among 28 individuals (68%) with loss of T790M, a range of competing resistance
mechanisms was detected, including novel mechanisms such as acquired KRAS mutations
and targetable gene fusions. Time to treatment discontinuation was shorter in patients with
T790M loss (6.1 vs 15.2 months), suggesting emergence of pre-existing resistant clones; this
finding was confirmed in a validation cohort of 110 patients with plasma cell-free DNA
genotyping performed after osimertinib resistance. In studies of serial plasma levels of
mutant EGFR, loss of T790M at resistance was associated with a smaller decrease in levels of
the EGFR driver mutation after 1 to 3 weeks of therapy (100% vs 83% decrease; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Acquired resistance to osimertinib mediated by loss of the
T790M mutation is associated with early resistance and a range of competing resistance
mechanisms. These data provide clinical evidence of the heterogeneity of resistance in
advanced NSCLC and a need for clinical trial strategies that can overcome multiple
concomitant resistance mechanisms or strategies for preventing such resistance.

simertinib mesylate is a third-generation tyrosine ki-
nase inhibitor (TKI) targeting mutant epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) now available world-
wide for the management of non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) carrying the EGFR (NCBI 1956) T790M resistance
mutation after acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI therapy.
Patients treated in this setting experience a high response rate
and median progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately
10 months.1,2 The clinical activity and favorable toxicity pro-
file of osimertinib has led this drug to be studied broadly as a
strategy for controlling and preventing drug resistance in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC.3,4
Withwidespreadclinicaluseofosimertinib,acquiredresis-
tance has become a clinical problem. A range of mechanisms of
resistancehasbeendescribed,includingEGFRC797Smutations,
MET amplification, and small cell transformation.5-11 The stan-
dard therapy after EGFR TKI options are exhausted is chemo-
therapy,suchastheregimenofplatinum/pemetrexedestablished
in the IMPRESS trial, with a 34% response rate and 5.4-month
median PFS.10 To improve on this outcome, a range of targeted
treatmentapproachesisnowindevelopmenttoovercomeresis-
tance to osimertinib, an approach that requires an improved
molecular and clinical understanding of what drives drug
resistance. Genomic analysis of plasma cell-free DNA has been
used to describe 2 new resistance mechanisms: acquired EGFR
C797S mutations and loss of the T790M mutation.12 Herein, we
report our study of resistance in a larger cohort to understand
clinical and molecular indicators that might suggest a specific
molecular mechanism of resistance and treatment approach.
Methods
Patients with advanced NSCLC treated with osimertinib were
identified from institutional databases of 4 contributing can-
cer centers. Patients who received single-agent osimertinib for
acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI and were EGFR T790M-
positiveineithertumororplasmawereincluded.Patientsfrom
the first-in-human AURA trial13 were studied with the same in-
clusion criteria as a validation cohort; all patients signed
informedconsentformsfortreatmentinthisprotocol.Eachsite’
s
institutional review board gave approval with waiver of con-
sent for the present analysis. The study and analysis were
finalized on November 9, 2017.
Patients from the institutional cohort were eligible for re-
sistance analysis based on the availability of tumor genotyping
from a biopsy performed after development of osimertinib
resistance. Patients who discontinued osimertinib due to toxic
effects before progression were excluded. Genotyping was
performed as part of clinical care or as a research test (with
patient consent) using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments–approved next-generation sequencing (NGS)
assay14; MET fluorescence in situ hybridization was also per-
formed, when possible.
Plasma was collected in the AURA trial with patient con-
sent. Patients from the AURA cohort were eligible for resis-
tance analysis based on the availability of plasma genotyping
results after development of osimertinib resistance. Plasma
cell-free DNA was studied for EGFR driver (L858R and exon
19 del) and resistance mutations (T790M and C797S) using
dropletdigitalpolymerasechainreaction(PCR)orbeads,emul-
sion, amplification, magnetics (BEAMing), as previously
described.15,16 Patients with no detectable EGFR driver muta-
tion in resistance plasma were excluded because there was
no evidence of tumor DNA for analysis. In addition, some pa-
tients from the institutional cohort consented to serial plasma
collection during treatment with osimertinib.
Tostudyclinicaloutcomesofosimertinib,timetotreatment
discontinuation(TTD)wasmeasured,17definedasthetimeun-
til the end of therapy for any reason. Patients were censored at
the date that they were last known to have received therapy.
TimetotreatmentdiscontinuationwasstudiedratherthanPFS
because many patients received therapy as part of their stan-
dard clinical care, making it difficult to perform an objective
analysis of radiographic progression. Furthermore, many pa-
tientscancontinuetherapybeyondobjectiveprogression,18such
that TTD may more accurately capture the clinical benefit of
therapy. A PFS analysis was included for the AURA cohort.
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the TTD and
PFS distributions. Fisher exact test was used to compare the
distribution of categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum
test was used to compare the distribution of continuous vari-
ables. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the
association of time receiving therapy with the odds of T790M
loss at the time of resistance. All P values are 2-sided and con-
sidered significant at the .05 level.

Key Points
Question What molecular and clinical biomarkers can be used to
better understand osimertinib mesylate resistance and develop
treatment strategies?
Findings In this cohort study of 143 patients who underwent
tumor next-generation sequencing, loss of the EGFR T790M
mutation was common on resistance to osimertinib and was
associated with early treatment failure and development of a
range of competing resistance mechanisms, some expected (MET
amplification, small cell transformation) and some novel (acquired
KRAS mutations, targetable gene fusions). Early changes in plasma
EGFR mutation levels may indicate probable resistance patterns.
Meaning Strategies to detect and target multiple coexistent
resistance mechanisms will be needed to achieve more durable
control of drug resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer.

 median TTD for these patients was 8.0 months, which was
lower than the expected PFS during osimertinib therapy.1 This
TTD may represent an enrichment for patients with earlier
acquired resistance—a common bias when studying patients
developing therapy resistance.
Forallpatients,tumorNGSwascompletedatresistanceand
an EGFR driver mutation was again detected (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Maintained EGFR T790M was detected in 13 pa-
tients (32%) and loss of T790M was seen in 28 patients (68%).
MutationsofEGFRC797Sweredetectedin9patients(22%over-
all; 69% of those with retained T790M), all in cis with a main-
tained T790M. Non-EGFR resistance mechanisms were iden-
tified in 19 patients (46%), with 17 (41%) occurring with T790M
loss (Figure 1). Of the 28 patients with T790M loss, 13 (46%) de-
veloped resistance mechanisms that are well described after
first-generation EGFR TKIs: 6 small-cell lung cancer transfor-
mation, 4 MET amplifications, 2 PIK3CA mutations (1 occur-
ring with small cell transformation), and 2 BRAF mutations.
Other patients with T790M loss developed unexpected resis-
tance mechanisms, including RET, FGFR3, and BRAF fusions
(1 each). Finally, 1 patient had a KRAS Q61K mutation detected
on tumor NGS (allelic fraction [AF], 30%) in addition to the
known EGFR 19 deletion mutation (AF, 31%) (Figure 2).
In several cases, serial plasma genotyping performed ret-
rospectively offered insight into the kinetics of osimertinib re-
sponse and resistance heterogeneity (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). For example, in a patient who developed small cell
transformation, plasma T790M levels dropped during osimer-
tinib therapy while EGFR driver levels increased (eFigure 1A,
top left in the Supplement), consistent with early progression
after 6 weeks. In a patient with acquired EGFR C797S, an ini-
tial complete response in plasma was followed by emergence
of the T790M plus 2 EGFR C797S variants (eFigure 1B, top left
in the Supplement). Finally, in the patient with an acquired
KRAS mutation, a new droplet digital PCR assay was devel-
oped to confirm the presence of the KRAS Q61K mutation,
which was absent before therapy but gradually emerged with
resistance(Figure2);theT790Mmutationreemergedinplasma
but was not detected on tumor NGS. In several cases, plasma
genotyping detected resistance mechanisms not detected on
tumor NGS: 1 patient had a KRAS mutation (G12V) detected on
plasma NGS at resistance that was not detected in the tumor,
1 patient with MET amplification detected in the tumor had
T790M and an ALK rearrangement detected on plasma NGS,
and a third patient with SCLC on biopsy had T790M and EGFR
G724S detected in plasma (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Patients developing loss of T790M were clinically similar

a median TTD of 6.1 months, which was shorter than the me-
dian TTD of 15.2 months in patients with maintained T790M
(log rank P = .01) (Figure 3). In 1 patient with a prolonged TTD
of 23.4 months, NGS of a resistance biopsy showed an exon 19
deletion at a low AF (5%) and no detectable T790M; however,
plasma droplet digital PCR detected the driver (AF, 47%) and
both T790M (AF, 44%) and C797S (AF, 28%) mutations.

 To validate our finding of early resistance in patients de-
veloping loss of T790M, we performed a retrospective analy-
sisofpatientsintheAURAtrial(eFigure2intheSupplement).1,19
Of 157 patients with plasma samples available after develop-
ment of resistance, 110 had a driver EGFR mutation detected
in plasma cell-free DNA and were deemed adequate for resis-
tance analysis. Of these patients, 52 (47%) had loss of T790M
and58(53%)maintainedtheT790Mmutation(eTable2Binthe
Supplement); 24 patients (22%) acquired EGFR C797S, all with
maintained T790M. Patients with loss of T790M had a shorter
median TTD (5.5 months) (Figure 4A) than patients with main-
tainedT790MeitherwithoutC797S(12.6months)orwithC797S
(12.4 months) (log rank P = .006). Patients with loss of T790M
similarly had a shorter PFS. With the cohort divided into ter-
tiles, loss of T790M was seen in 26 of 38 patients (68%) with
5.5-months or less TTD; maintained T790M was seen in 26 of
36 patients (72%) with 13 months more TTD (Figure 4B).
We studied strategies for anticipating loss of T790M using
pretreatment features. Of the 19 patients with non-EGFR re-
sistance mechanisms detected on biopsies after progression,
16 had pre-osimertinib resistance biopsies (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Among 6 individuals with small cell transfor-
mation, 1 had small cell differentiation detected on a biopsy
that preceded osimertinib therapy by 8.5 months, although
only adenocarcinoma was seen on a biopsy immediately
preceding osimertinib therapy; 2 other patients showed RB1
loss on tumor NGS before osimertinib.20,21 Among 4 patients
with MET amplification after osimertinib, 2 had pre-
osimertinib MET fluorescence in situ hybridization, 1 of which
showed focal MET amplification (6% of cells with 10 MET cop-
ies) in addition to the T790M mutation (AF, 7%); after treat-
ment with osimertinib for 9 weeks, T790M was no longer de-
tectable on rebiopsy, but MET amplification was seen in 94%
of the cells (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Pre-osimertinib NGS
for the patient with the BRAF fusion (eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment) after osimertinib showed this fusion before therapy,
coexistent with a T790M mutation (AF, 10%). Separately,
2 patients with early osimertinib failure and T790M loss in tu-
mor had T790M detected in plasma but not in tumor before
osimertinib treatment. We also studied the biologic outcome
of genomic TP53 loss, which has been associated with earlier
resistance on first-generation EGFR TKI.22,23 The TP53 muta-
tional status was available for all 41 patients with resistance
biopsies, and 26 individuals had a pathogenic TP53 mutation
or 2-copy loss of TP53. Although these mutations were more
common in patients with T790M loss (71% vs 46%), the dif-
ference was not statistically significant (P = .17).
Given the limited availability of matched pre- and post-
osimertinib biopsies, we studied plasma genotyping to esti-
mate the eventual pattern of resistance. Fifty patients from the

 AURA cohort had plasma genotyping performed before os-
imertinib administration and after development of resis-
tance. The relative AF of T790M compared with the EGFR
driver was calculated, as described previously,24 as a poten-
tial measure of T790M allelic prevalence. Pre- and post-
osimertinib relative T790M AF were correlated (eFigure 5A in
the Supplement) (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.70;
P < .001). However, when this association is studied in a di-
chotomous fashion, patients who develop T790M loss have

vs 38% median, P = .06) (Figure 5A). Generation of a receiver

a diagnostic test for estimating the probable loss of T790M.

Discussion
Osimertinib has become the first targeted therapy to receive
regulatory approval for the treatment of solid tumors harbor-
ing a specific resistance mechanism. Although osimertinib is
expected to move into the first-line setting for treatment of
EGFR-mutant NSCLC,4 the challenge of detecting and target-
ingspecificresistancemechanismshasrelevanceacrossarange
of targetable genotypes where treatment of drug resistance is
under active investigation.26,27
Our data provide clinical evidence of the influence of
heterogeneity on treatment outcomes with osimertinib and
suggest that there may be 2 types of T790M-positive resis-
tance. In some patients, the T790M mutation represents the
dominant resistance mechanism, and these patients will have
a more durable response to treatment. In patients with hetero-
geneous mechanisms of resistance, T790M-mutant sub-
clones coexist with subclones harboring distinct resistance
mechanisms; targeting T790M alone is likely to result in tran-
sient benefit. What is currently unclear is how to determine
whether there is a dominant or minor T790M-positive popu-
lation. Some prior studies have found that quantification of
the relative T790M AF is associated with the degree of re-
sponse to third-generation EGFR TKIs, although this associa-

In our analysis, we studied whether such a calculation of rela-
tive T790M AF in plasma could indicate probable subsequent
loss of T790M, and our data did not reveal a clear predictive
ability. Instead, serial plasma monitoring may offer insight into
subsequent resistance patterns.
Theovergrowthofnon-T790Mresistancemechanismshigh-
lights that coexistence of multiple resistance mechanisms is a
reality with clinical implications—some resistance mecha-
nisms are not acquired during osimertinib therapy but instead
coexist with T790M. For example, in 1 case positive for T790M
priortoosimertinib,METwasamplifiedinjust6%ofcells;with
osimertinib treatment, this subclone became the dominant re-
sistancemechanism,detectablein94%ofcells(eFigure3inthe
Supplement). The finding of multiple resistance mechanisms
hasbeendescribedpreviously.Yuetal30 identifiedmultiplere-
sistancemutationsin4%of155patientswithEGFR-mutantlung
cancer and acquired resistance. Yet, the increased use of PCR
assays for T790M detection means that coexistent resistance
mechanisms may go undetected, although emerging data sug-
gestthatplasmaNGSapproachescandetect,inasubsetofcases,
resistance mechanisms that coexist with T790M.31,32 Further
prospective study is needed to determine whether multigene
analyses of tumor or plasma could detect competing resis-
tance mechanisms reliably enough to allow early delivery of
appropriate osimertinib-based combination therapies.
Loss of T790M is a potentially confusing clinical state that
could be misinterpreted as resensitization to first-line EGFR
TKIs.Ourdatadonotsupportthishypothesis;mostofthetime,
loss of T790M is associated with development of alternative
competing resistance mechanisms (eFigure 6 in the Supple-
ment). Many of these mechanisms, such as small cell trans-
formation and MET amplification, have been reported in
T790M-negative acquired resistance.33,34 However, we also
have identified a novel finding of an acquired KRAS muta-
tion, which was confirmed using tumor NGS and plasma drop-
let digital PCR. The complex variety of resistance mutations
seen in patients with loss of T790M, including several ac-

A, Fifty patients from the AURA cohort had plasma genotyping performed
before and after osimertinib treatment. Relative T790M allelic fraction (AF) was
calculated as T790M AF/EGFR driver AF. Patients with T790M loss tended to
have a lower relative T790M AF at baseline (29% vs 38% median, P = .06) than
patients with T790M maintained, although the difference was modest.
B, Measuring the relative change in plasma EGFR levels after 1 to 3 weeks of
osimertinib therapy, both T790M loss and T790M maintained patients had
decreases in T790M levels (ΔT790M). Patients with T790M maintained had a
larger decrease in EGFR driver levels (ΔDriver, P = .01). C, In analysis of the
differential plasma response between the EGFR driver and the T790M, patients
had a greater T790M response than EGFR driver response compared with those
who maintained T790M (median difference, 16% vs 0%; P = .003).

 of T790M is associated with early resistance, this phenom-
enon could be more evident in usual clinical care than pro-
spective cohorts would suggest; indeed, it was seen in 68%
of patients in our post hoc institutional cohort, but 47% of
patients in the prospective AURA cohort (P = .03).
Our study has potentially important implications in the
care of patients who develop resistance to osimertinib. There
is a wide range of osimertinib combination therapies now in
clinical trials, but selecting the right approach will require
insight into disease biology. Patients who develop early resis-
tance to osimertinib likely have competing resistance
mechanisms in other tumor subclones, and patients who
develop late resistance are more likely to have maintained
T790M and acquired C797S; different targeted therapies
could be considered for these biologically varying popula-
tions. New clinical trials aiming to target patients with T790M-
positive resistance and acquired resistance to osimertinib
must consider which type of resistance is being targeted.
Repeated testing for T790M would be an intuitive approach
to stratify these 2 biologically distinct types of osimertinib re-
sistance. Another strategy would be to improve the efficacy
ofosimertinibbydevelopingcombinationapproachesthatpre-
vent the development of resistance.35,36 However, the com-
plex range of resistance mechanisms seen after osimertinib
treatment make it difficult for any single combination ap-
proach to significantly delay osimertinib resistance overall.
Limitations
The limitations of our study must be acknowledged.
Genomic analysis of resistance biopsies was performed using
available clinical NGS assays rather than a single central
assay, and pre-osimertinib NGS was available on only a sub-
set of patients. To compensate for the limited numbers of
patients receiving resistance biopsies, we performed plasma
genotyping on a clinical trial cohort to validate our findings of
different clinical behaviors in different types of osimertinib re-
sistance. Loss of T790M was more common in our institu-
tional cohort compared with the trial cohort—we suspect that
this is because a retrospective institutional cohort will enrich
dataforpatientspresentingwithearlyresistance,whichismore
often loss of T790M. Even the trial cohort may be falsely en-
riched for T790M loss because patients who are still receiv-
ing therapy without resistance may be enriched for C797S,
which is seen more in late resistance. The development of
therapies targeting the EGFR C797S resistance mutation will
need to consider the possibility that C797S will be a late resis-
tance mechanism on osimertinib, and extra time may be
needed to identify these patients.37
Conclusions
Our data indicate that EGFR T790M is a key biomarker not only
for indicating the probability of osimertinib sensitivity but also
for understanding the biology of osimertinib resistance.
Retesting for T790M after osimertinib failure is an important
step for guiding patients to appropriate subsequent treat-
ment strategies and relevant clinical trials. Our data indicate
that drug resistance in some patients is genetically heteroge-
neous, impairing the effectiveness of targeted therapies. These
findingsmustbeconsideredasstrategiesaredevelopedtotreat
resistance to newer first-line targeted therapies (eg, osimer-
tinib, alectinib)4,38 with their unique resistance mechanisms.
If we wish to achieve more durable outcomes, early interven-
tions may be needed, such as combination targeted thera-
pies, to prevent the development of drug resistance.
