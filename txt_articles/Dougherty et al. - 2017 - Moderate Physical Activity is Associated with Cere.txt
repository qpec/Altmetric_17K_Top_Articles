Abstract
The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between accelerometer-measured 
physical activity (PA) and glucose metabolism in asymptomatic late-middle-aged adults. Ninety-
three cognitively healthy late-middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s 
Prevention participated in this cross-sectional study. They underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging and wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X
+) to measure free-living PA. Accelerometer data yielded measures of light (LPA), moderate 
(MPA), and vigorous (VPA) intensity PA. FDG-PET images were scaled to the cerebellum and 
pons, and cerebral glucose metabolic rate was extracted from specific regions of interest (ROIs) 
known to be hypometabolic in AD, i.e., hippocampus, posterior cingulate, inferior temporal 
cortex, and angular gyrus. Regression analyses were utilized to examine the association between 
PA and glucose metabolism, while adjusting for potential confounds. There were associations 
between MPA and glucose metabolism in all ROIs examined. In contrast, LPA was not associated 
with glucose uptake in any ROI and VPA was only associated with hippocampal FDG uptake. 
Secondary analyses did not reveal associations between sedentary time and glucose metabolism in 
any of the ROIs. Exploratory voxel-wise analysis identified additional regions where MPA was

amygdala, and middle frontal gyrus. These findings suggest that the intensity of PA is an important 
contributor to neuronal function in a late-middle-aged cohort, with MPA being the most salient. 
Prospective studies are necessary for fully elucidating the link between midlife engagement in PA 
and later life development of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral hypometabolism, as measured by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography (FDG-PET), is a well-established characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
[1–3] and can even be detected in cognitively normal carriers of the strongest genetic risk 
factor for AD, the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε4) [4]. Specific brain 
regions vulnerable to hypometabolism in AD include the inferior temporal gyri, angular 
gyri, and posterior cingulate [5]. Additionally, decreased cerebral glucose metabolism is 
predictive of cognitive decline and conversion to AD among cognitively normal older adults 
[6, 7]. For these reasons, cerebral glucose metabolism is a strong candidate for preclinical 
evaluation of AD-related brain changes.
Physical activity (PA) has been shown to be associated with many indices of brain health [8–
10] including cerebral glucose metabolism [11]. However, these studies have measured PA 
with questionnaires, which are subject to recall and social desirability biases [12]. The recent 
advent of the accelerometer, a device that continuously records PA, has made possible the 
objective measurement of free-living PA [13], and several studies have shown large 
variability between self-reported PA and accelerometer-measured PA, especially in older 
adults [12, 14].
Further, emerging evidence indicates that accelerometer-measured PA might be more 
sensitive than self-report measures when investigating AD-related outcomes, such as 
cognitive function [15]. Another important knowledge gap concerns whether the association 
between PA and brain health depends on the intensity of PA, as self-report measures 
generally do not include intensity measures [16]. Accordingly, the primary objective of this 
study was to examine the association between accelerometer-determined PA and cerebral 
glucose metabolism, with a specific focus on comparing light, moderate, and vigorous PA 
(LPA, MPA, and VPA, respectively). Secondary analyses examined the association between 
sedentary time and cerebral glucose metabolism.

 Participants
Ninety-three cognitively healthy adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s 
Prevention (WRAP) participated in this study. WRAP is a longitudinal registry composed of 
more than 1,500 cognitively normal late-middle-aged adults [17]. All 93 participants 
underwent FDG-PET and wore a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph LLC, 
Pensacola, FL), during waking hours, for 1 week. Similar to the entire WRAP cohort, the 
sample that provided data for this report was enriched with family history of AD (69.9%) 
and the APOE ε4 allele (46.2%).
Physical activity assessment
A triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) measured PA 
over 7 consecutive days. Participants were instructed to place the accelerometer on their hip, 
affixed to an elastic belt, and to wear the device during all waking hours, with the exception 
of when showering, swimming, or bathing. Standard accelerometry inclusion criteria 
consisted of at least 10 hours of valid wear time per day for a minimum of 3 weekdays and 1 
weekend day [18]. Accelerometer data (in 1-s epochs) were processed using the sojourn-3 
axis method [19] to calculate time spent in 3 well-established intensity categories of PA, that 
is LPA, MPA, VPA, and time spent sedentary. Briefly, this method utilizes information from 
all three axes (vertical, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral) to identify independent bout 
intervals—the time between starting one activity (e.g., sitting, standing, walking, running, 
jumping, etc.) and transitioning to another—by instances of rapid acceleration or 
deceleration.
Within the sojourn-3 axis method [19], estimated metabolic equivalents (METs) are 
determined for each bout interval using a validated neural network approach [20], as 
opposed to the traditional counts-per-minute approach. The MET values were classified into 
PA intensity categories thus: <1.5 METs = sedentary, 1.5–2.99 METs = LPA, 3–6 METs = 
MPA, and >6 METs = vigorous VPA [18]. To account for individual variability in 
accelerometer wear-time the total minutes spent participating in bouts of each PA intensity 
category during a single day were then divided by the total minutes of wear-time for that day 
and averaged over all valid days to compute percent of day spent in sedentary, LPA, MPA, 
and VPA.
FDG-PET imaging, processing, and quantification
Participants underwent 3D FDG-PET imaging on a Siemens EXACT HR+ scanner (Siemens 
AG, Erlangen, Germany) after a minimum 4-h fast. Details on the acquisition and post-
processing of the FDG-PET examinations have been previously described [10, 21]. Briefly, 
the scans were prescribed according to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) protocol [22] which involved 5 mCi FDG injection followed by a 30-min uptake 
period and a 30-min transaxial acquisition. Post-processing was based on an in-house 
automated pipeline [23]. Each FDG-PET image was proportionally scaled to the mean FDG 
signal from the cerebellar vermis and pons [24].
For our analyses, we used the ADNI FDG Meta-ROI suite [5] to extract FDG-PET values 
from five brain regions found to be particularly hypometabolic in AD. These were the left

 and right inferior temporal gyri, the left and right angular gyri, and the posterior cingulate 
[5]. The ADNI FDG Meta-ROI suite also includes a composite measure of all five regions. 
Additionally, because of its relevance to PA [25, 26] and AD [27–29], we extracted FDG 
uptake values from the hippocampus bilaterally, using the Automated Anatomical Labeling 
(AAL) [30] atlas as implemented within the WFU PickAtlas toolbox [31]. The mean time 
between PET imaging and PA assessment was 0.87 ± 0.51 years.
Furthermore, due to the limited spatial coverage of the ADNI FDG Meta-ROIs, we 
performed an exploratory voxel-wise analysis to test for potential associations between PA 
and FDG uptake in other brain regions not included in the ROI analyses. To reduce the risk 
of false positive errors, we focused this analysis on brain regions implicated in AD cerebral 
metabolism [32] by imposing an a priori anatomical mask that included the bilateral superior 
and middle frontal cortices, superior and inferior parietal lobules, precuneus, posterior 
cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus using the AAL atlas [30] 
within the WFU PickAtlas toolbox [31].
Statistical analyses
Tests for model assumptions revealed that MPA and VPA were non-normally distributed 
whereas sedentary time and LPA did not deviate from a normal distribution. Therefore, we 
applied a Blom transformation to the MPA and VPA variables prior to model fitting.
To examine the association between FDG uptake in our ROIs and PA (LPA, MPA, and 
VPA), we fitted a linear regression model to each ROI measure, adjusting for age, sex, body 
mass index (BMI), and APOE ε4 status. All ROI analyses were performed in SPSS 20.0 
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and only findings with p ≤ 0.05 (two-tailed) were deemed 
significant.
The exploratory voxel-wise analysis for the association between FDG uptake and PA was 
fitted in SPM8 (http://www.filion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and APOE 
ε4 status. Reults were thresholded to clusters with a minimum of 100 contiguous voxels and 
pvoxel < 0.005. This a priori threshold was derived via Monte Carlo simulations 
(3dClustSim, AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov).
RESULTS
Background characteristics
Participants’ relevant background characteristics are listed in Table 1. The mean age was 
63.93 ± 5.82 years and the majority were women (65.6%). The participants were slightly 
overweight (mean BMI = 28.11 ± 5.63 kg/m2) and a small number were taking a beta-
blocker (7.5%). The participants had a mean Mini-Mental State Examination score of 29.28 
± .98, confirming their cognitively healthy status. On average, participants wore the 
actigraph for 15.33 ± 1.1 hours per day and recorded 6.5 ± .56 valid days of wear time.
PA and cerebral glucose metabolism
There was a positive association between MPA and glucose metabolism in all the ROIs, 
including the composite measure. In contrast, LPA was not associated with glucose

 metabolism in any of the examined brain regions and VPA was only associated with FDG 
uptake in the hippocampus (see Table 2). To visualize these relationships, the participants 
were separated into equal tertiles (n = 31) for each PA intensity. The average minutes per 
day spent in LPA, MPA, and VPA are as follows: Tertile 1: 121.3, 43.3, 2.6; Tertile 2: 165.1, 
68.1, 10.4; Tertile 3: 228.1, 105.7, 26.7. Differences in mean FDG uptake across the PA 
tertiles were tested using pairwise contrasts. Because the pattern of findings were consistent 
across all ROIs, we only present plots and associated pairwise contrasts for the composite 
FDG measure, as an exemplar for the other ROIs.
As shown in Fig. 1, mean FDG uptake was highest in Tertile 3 and lowest in Tertile 1 for 
both MPA and VPA, and this difference was significant. For LPA, participants in Tertile 2 
had greater FDG uptake compared to those in Tertiles 1 and 3. Additionally, for MPA, 
participants classified into Tertile 2 exhibited significantly greater FDG uptake than those in 
Tertile 1, suggesting that a modest increase in MPA engagement is associated with 
progressively higher glucose metabolism. This observation was not made for VPA where, 
instead, significant differences in FDG uptake were primarily seen between Tertile 1 and 
Tertile 3, suggesting that a substantial increase in VPA engagement might be required in 
order to derive further boost in cerebral glucose uptake.
Lastly, to test for the specificity of our PA-FDG findings to AD-implicated brain regions, we 
examined the association between PA and FDG uptake in the primary visual cortex (V1), 
which is a region of the brain that is not usually affected in AD. FDG uptake in V1 was not 
associated with LPA (p = 0.638), MPA (p = 0.137), or VPA (p = 0.681).
Sedentary time and cerebral glucose metabolism
Sedentary time was not associated with cerebral glucose metabolism in any of the examined 
brain ROIs which included the hippocampus (p = 0.162), posterior cingulate (p = 0.927), left 
inferior temporal (p = 0.947), right inferior temporal (p = 0.436), left angular (p = 0.676), 
right angular (p = 0.359), or the composite measure (p = 0.562).
Exploratory voxel-wise analysis
Because MPA proved to be most robustly associated with glucose metabolism in the ROI 
analyses, it alone was selected for further testing in the voxel-wise analysis. This analysis 
revealed that MPA was significantly associated with FDG uptake in several brain regions 
(see Table 3 and Fig. 2). In the left hemisphere, these included the precuneus, posterior 
cingulate, supramarginal gyrus, superior medial frontal gyrus, hippocampus, and the middle 
frontal gyrus. In the right hemisphere, significant regions included the middle frontal gyrus, 
supramarginal gyrus, amygdala, and the superior medial frontal gyrus.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this may be the first study to implement an objectively-measured PA 
assessment to investigate the relationship between PA and cerebral glucose metabolism. We 
report novel findings of positive associations between engagement in MPA and cerebral 
glucose metabolism, an association that was not present for LPA or VPA. Notably, there was 
an observed intensity gradient in the relationship between MPA and cerebral glucose

 metabolism, whereby with incremental increases in PA we found corresponding increases in 
cerebral glucose metabolism.
Mounting evidence suggests that PA and cardiorespiratory fitness may promote 
neuroprotective processes [10, 33–37] and may therefore be a potential non-pharmacological 
avenue for AD risk reduction. Apropos to the current study, Matthews and colleagues [11] 
investigated the relationship between leisure time PA and cerebral glucose metabolism. 
Utilizing the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity questionnaire, they found that individuals 
who engaged in the equivalent of at least 30 minutes of moderate activity five days a week 
had significantly higher levels of glucose metabolism in regions including the 
parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus, compared to their 
physically inactive peers. Likewise, a recent study from our group [10] found that increased 
PA, determined from the Women’s Health Initiative PA questionnaire, ameliorated age-
related changes in cerebral glucose metabolism.
These studies provide initial insight into the relationship between PA and glucose 
metabolism. However, the use of questionnaire-based measurements of PA has limitations, 
including subjective recall bias, especially when such bias is non-randomly distributed such 
that participants in one group (e.g., physically inactive) may inaccurately recall PA from past 
weeks compared with the other group (e.g., physically active). Additionally, self-reported PA 
questionnaires may be unreliable due to the difficulty in assessing non-structured PA and 
non-exercise activities such as performing housework or climbing stairs. Few studies have 
investigated the relationship between objectively-measured PA and AD biomarkers. In a 
recent cross-sectional investigation, Doi and colleagues [38] found that in older adults with 
MCI, objectively-measured moderate-to-vigorous PA was inversely associated with brain 
atrophy. This group also reported that moderate PA was positively associated with 
hippocampal volume in their MCI cohort [39]. In cognitively healthy older adults, 
Burzynska and colleagues [40] reported a relationship between engagement in moderate-to-
vigorous PA and decreased white matter lesion burden, and Varma and colleagues [41] 
reported sex-specific relationships between light PA and hippocampal volume. Work from 
our group reported that older adults meeting PA recommendations displayed larger temporal 
lobe volumes than those not meeting recommendations [33]. Additionally, objectively 
measured PA has been positively associated with cognition [42–44] and may be a potential 
non-pharmacological avenue for AD risk reduction [15]. Our findings complement the 
results from these prior studies. We report significant association between engagement in 
moderate PA and cerebral glucose metabolism in all of our a priori ROIs as well as in voxel-
wise analyses. These findings suggest that MPA might protect against hypometabolism in 
brain regions that are particularly susceptible to the pathophysiology of AD [5].
Additionally, while MPA was associated with increased cerebral glucose metabolism in all 
of the ROIs investigated, VPA was only associated with FDG uptake in the hippocampus, 
LPA and sedentary time were not associated wih the ROIs examined. This finding fits well 
with previous research. For example, Makizako and colleagues reported that MPA was 
positively associated with hippocampal volume in a cohort of older adults with MCI, but 
LPA was not [39]. In another study utilizing accelerometry, Brown and colleagues stratified 
a cohort of 217 older adults into tertiles based on PA intensity. Participants in the highest

 tertile, equivalent to MPA (4.4–6 METS), performed significantly better on multiple 
cognitive tasks compared to the lower two tertiles [43]. These prior findings, in combination 
with the current study, suggest that MPA may be more effective at promoting resilience to 
AD-related changes in both the brain and cognition, compared with LPA. However, other 
groups have reported contradicting findings [41]. It should be noted that our investigation 
into the relationship between VPA and glucose metabolism may be somewhat limited due to 
the restricted range of time spent in VPA amongst our sample (range = 0–74 min/day, 
mean(SD) = 13(13) min/day), in comparison with MPA (range = 20–191 min/day, mean(SD) 
= 72(30) min/day). Others have observed this limitation with VPA [43] as older adults are 
unlikely to engage in any vigorous activity [18].
Lastly, there appeared to be a step-wise increase in the benefits of MPA and VPA on glucose 
metabolism. When time spent engaging in MPA was separated into tertiles, those who were 
categorized into the lowest tertile (43.3 min/day) showed the least FDG uptake compared to 
the other tertile groups, but the middle (68.1 min/per day) and highest tertile (105.7 min/day) 
groups were not significantly different from each other. This suggests perhaps even a modest 
increase in MPA can be beneficial to brain health. Interestingly, when we looked at VPA 
tertiles, we found a difference between those in the lowest tertile (2.6 min/day) compared to 
their peers in the highest tertile (26.7 min/day), but found no difference between those in the 
lowest tertile against those in the middle tertile (10.4 min/day), or between the middle tertile 
group and the highest tertile. These findings may suggest that a larger dose of vigorous 
activity is necessary to receive similar benefits of PA on glucose metabolism.
Some limitations of this study include its cross-sectional nature. Future studies would 
benefit from a prospective design to elucidate causality and directionality of the observed 
relationships between PA and cerebral glucose metabolism. Secondly, although our model 
was adjusted for several important covariates, there are additional lifestyle habits that may 
accompany PA such as diet, sleep, and social factors that we were unable to control for. 
Additionally, the level of PA in our sample is not completely representative of the general 
population of middle-aged and older adults, as we have previously shown [33] that 32% of 
our sample met the weekly physical activity recommendations [45] which is a higher rate 
than the reported national average of 5% of older adults [18]. Further examination of these 
national data [18] suggests that even participants in the lowest tertile of the current study 
engaged in more MPA and VPA than the national average of late-middle-aged adults. Lastly, 
generalizability of our findings might be somewhat limited due to our sample’s demographic 
make-up (i.e., predominantly highly-educated non-Hispanic Whites). Future studies that 
include diverse populations are needed to determine whether our findings extend to other 
ethnic groups.
Overall, the present study provides encouraging evidence that PA may be beneficial for 
neurometabolic function. While others have reported that acute aerobic exercise [46] and 
aerobic training interventions [47] can alter cerebral glucose metabolism, our findings 
suggest that engagement in MPA, specifically, may promote cerebral glucose metabolism 
among cognitively normal late-middle-aged adults at risk for AD. While we cannot draw 
definitive conclusions regarding causation in this study, our findings, in the context of the 
literature suggest PA tracks closely with cerebral glucose metabolism. This work makes a

 critical contribution to the efforts to identify the intensity and duration of PA that confers the 
most advantage for combating AD-related changes in midlife.
