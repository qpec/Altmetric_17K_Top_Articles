Abstract
Importance—Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment strategy for patients with heart failure, 
which accounts for over 10% of deaths in the U.S. annually. Despite over a decade of research, 
further investigation is still needed to determine whether stem cell regenerative therapy is 
clinically effective and can be routinely implemented in clinical practice.
Objective—The purpose of this review is to describe the current progress in cardiac stem cell 
regenerative therapy using adult stem cells and highlight the merits and limitations of clinical trials 
performed to date.
Evidence Review—Information for this review was obtained through a search of PubMed and 
the Cochrane database for English language studies published between January 1, 2000 and April 
20, 2016. Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials and 7 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were 
included in this review.
Findings—Although adult stem cells were once believed to have the ability to create new heart 
tissue or grow blood vessels, preclinical studies suggest instead that these cells release cardio-
protective paracrine factors that activate endogenous pathways, leading to myocardial repair. 
Subsequent randomized controlled clinical trials, the majority of which used autologous bone 
marrow mononuclear cells, have found only a modest benefit in patients receiving stem cell 
therapy. The lack of a significant benefit may result from variations in trial methodology, 
discrepancies in reporting, and an over-reliance on surrogate endpoints.
Conclusions and Relevance—Although stem cell therapy for cardiovascular disease is not yet 
ready for routine clinical application, significant progress continues to be made. Physicians should 
be aware of the current status of this treatment so that they can better inform their patients who 
may be in search of alternative therapies.

 Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a devastating disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality, 
accounting for one in nine deaths in the US.1 Patients who suffer from coronary artery 
disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, and other cardiac disorders are at risk of developing 
HF. Because therapeutic options for advanced HF remain limited to organ transplantation 
and left ventricular assist device (LVAD), there is a strong impetus to develop alternative 
treatment strategies. Stem cell regenerative medicine is a promising therapeutic strategy to 
repair or replace injured and nonviable myocardium. Effective clinical translation, however, 
remains challenging due to inconclusive study results regarding stem cell regenerative 
capacity and their ability to improve cardiac function.2–6 Here we will review the proposed 
mechanisms of action for stem cell regenerative therapy, compare various stem cell sources, 
and discuss the merits and limitations of recently published adult stem cell clinical trials.
Proposed Mechanisms of Action to Improve Heart Function
Over the last decade, investigators have proposed three basic mechanisms to support the 
assertion that stem cell therapy can be used as an effective treatment for HF (Figure 1). 
Although it was once believed that adult stem cells could generate new cardiac tissue,7,8 a 
process termed cardiogenesis, further investigation has revealed that few if any adult stem 
cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes and engraft into the myocardium.9 The second 
proposed mechanism of action suggests that stem cells could generate vasculature via 
angiogenesis or vasculogenesis by activating endogenous endothelial progenitor cells 
(EPCs) or recruiting them from the vasculature. The existence of EPCs, however, remains 
controversial due to a lack of unique surface markers to identify these cells.10 Moreover, 
only a subset of EPCs may be of true endothelial lineage capable of neovasculogenesis, and 
these populations are rare and likely of insufficient number to produce measureable 
improvement in heart function.11
While these two hypotheses remain controversial, mounting evidence now suggests that 
adult stem cells may exert paracrine effects by secreting cardio-protective factors. These 
secreted factors may stimulate vascular growth and remodeling, attenuate fibrosis, modulate 
inflammation, regulate cell differentiation and survival, and recruit resident stem or 
progenitor cells.12,13 Activation of these pathways may blunt reperfusion injury or attenuate 
adverse remodeling in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or HF, 
respectively. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that these factors may be clustered into 
extracellular membrane vesicles, including exosomes and microsomes, which can then 
transfer proteins, lipids, RNA, and microRNAs to mediate cardioprotection.14,15 Although 
further studies are needed to confirm that these vesicles can substitute for stem cell therapy, 
delivering these vesicles rather than cells themselves may present a clinically attractive 
therapeutic option from a regulatory and commercial perspective.
Stem Cells Utilized in Clinical Trials For Heart Diseases
Although animal studies support the idea that the favorable effects observed from treatment 
with adult stem cells are attributable to paracrine effect,13,16,17, the exact mechanism of 
action in humans remains unclear. Despite this incomplete knowledge, ample clinical

 experience has been accumulated from the numerous clinical trials using various adult stem 
cell populations, including bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNCs), 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and stem cells isolated from cardiac tissue (Figure 1). The 
clinical translatability of each of these adult stem cell populations is discussed below.
Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs)—The human bone marrow contains a 
small fraction of various stem cell populations, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), 
EPCs, and MSCs, which can be isolated using a Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and 
purified to obtain a final product that is commonly known as BMMNCs.18 Several studies 
have also used a magnetic separation device to isolate subpopulations of BMMNCs 
expressing CD34 or CD133 surface markers to further enhance efficacy.19,20 Interestingly, 
recent studies have suggested that the reparative capabilities of these cells may also be 
dependent on the age as well as the health of the donor. Vrtovec et al. showed that CD34+ 
cells obtained from younger patients had greater myocardial homing than those obtained 
from older patients, resulting in greater improvement in LVEF in the former.21 The 
reparative capacity of BMMNCs may even decline post-MI, as shown by Cogle et al., who 
analyzed the bone marrow obtained from patients enrolled in the TIME, LateTIME, and 
FOCUS-CCTRN trials.22 While all patients had a heterogeneous mixture of bone marrow 
cell subsets, bone marrow obtained from those patients post-MI had decreased angiogenic 
and vasculogenic capabilities. Patients with a higher number of CD34+ had greater 
improvement in LVEF. Collectively, these studies support the notion that heterogeneity in 
cell number and viability can affect the therapeutic response of BMMNCS. Nevertheless, the 
relative abundance of stem cells in the bone marrow, low cost of isolation, and ease of 
procurement have allowed these cells to be used in more than 100 pre-clinical and clinical 
studies thus far,23 making BMMNCs the most researched stem cell source.
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)—Mesenchymal stem cells are mesoderm-derived 
stem cells that exist in various tissues, including the bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, 
adipose tissues, and muscles.24 Although it remains unclear how biologically similar MSCs 
from various tissue sources are, both BM- and non-BM-derived (e.g., adipose tissue) MSCs, 
as well as “pre-conditioned” cardiopoietic MSCs, have been increasingly tested in cell 
therapy studies.25,26 Isolation, expansion, and purification of MSCs, however, can be a long 
and tedious process, which may limit the large-scale production of these cells for clinical 
transplantation.
Cardiac-derived stem cells—While still controversial, several investigators have 
reported the existence of resident populations of cardiac progenitor cells in post-natal hearts, 
challenging the notion that the myocardium is terminally differentiated.27,28 Isolated from 
adult heart tissue, c-kit-positive cardiac stem cells (CSCs) have been reported to differentiate 
into cardiomyocytes when transplanted into the heart after MI. Similarly, cells migrating out 
of cardiac tissue fragments to form spheres, commonly known as cardiosphere-derived cells 
(CDCs),29 have been reported to give rise to cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo after 
transplantation. Isolation of CSCs and CDCs requires harvesting cardiac tissue via 
percutaneous endomyocardial biopsies or surgical extraction, followed by digestion,

 expansion, and purification to the desired cell types, a process that can take over a month 
from the time of tissue sampling to generate a sufficient number of cells for therapy.30
Results from Clinical Trials
Over the last decade, researchers have evaluated the safety and efficacy of various stem cell 
populations in a number of clinical trials, with trials using autologous BMMNCs leading the 
charge (Table 1 and 2).3,4,31,32 Although initial results were encouraging, subsequent large-
scale randomized placebo controlled trials have shown only a modest benefit, as confirmed 
in recently published meta-analyses.31,32 The following section summarizes a select list of 
clinical trials that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of transplanting adult stem cells in 
patients with CAD and HF. Due to space limitations, we are unable to detail the specifics of 
each trial and refer the reader to more comprehensive reviews of stem cell trials for further 
detail.2,6,31–35
Acute Myocardial Infarction—The use of stem cells at the time of AMI was supported 
by animal studies that suggested stem cell therapy could limit the extent of myocardial 
injury and potentially restore damaged myocardium.36 The initial observation of improved 
ventricular function after AMI following BMMNC therapy led to the initiation of the BOne 
marrOw transfer to enhance ST-elevation infarct regeneration (BOOST) trial published in 
2004,37 which enrolled 60 patients randomized to receive intracoronary BMMNC therapy 
versus conventional medical therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for 
AMI. Although the study reported an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) at 6 months following the BMMNC therapy, the observed benefit largely 
disappeared at 18 months except in those with significant infarct size (>60%) and depressed 
LVEF <50% at the time of therapy.38 This study was then followed by The Reinfusion of 
Enriched Progenitor cells And Infarct Remodeling in Acute Myocardial Infarction 
(REPAIR-AMI) trial,39 the first double-blinded, randomized trial enrolling over 200 patients 
to receive placebo or autologous BMMNCs. A significantly greater increase in LVEF was 
reported in the cell therapy group versus control at 6 months (mean of 5.5% versus 3.0%, P 
= 0.01), with a mortality benefit and sustained LVEF improvement at the 2-year follow up. 
Similar to the BOOST trial, those with depressed LVEF <50% appeared to have derived the 
most benefit. Despite the initial encouraging results with BMMNC therapies, many 
subsequent studies utilizing BMMNCs did not find a significant benefit (Table 1).20,40–46 
Similarly, the most recent Cochrane Database Systematic Review published in 2015 that 
included 41 randomized controlled trials using BMMNCs and a total of 2,732 participants 
showed that cell treatment was safe but found no significant improvements in quality of life 
or LVEF in the short or long term. The mean difference in LVEF between the treated and 
control group was 2 – 5%, which was not considered clinically relevant given the inherent 
variability of imaging tests.32
Because only a very small fraction of BMMNCs are actually stem cells (e.g., ~2–4% HSCs/
EPCs and <0.01% MSCs), several studies have utilized a more select subgroup of 
BMMNCs, namely, CD34+ cells and MSCs, to eliminate biological variability and augment 
efficacy by removing bystander cells. In a study comparing the effects of intracoronary

 treatment with BMMNCs vs. BM-derived CD34+/CXCR4+ cells for patients after AMI with 
reduced LVEF <40%,20 Tendera et al. found no significant differences in LVEF or in the 
incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including death, re-infarction, 
stroke, or target vessel revascularization, between the two groups. In 2004, Chen et al. 
reported the first randomized trial delivering autologous MSCs via intracoronary injection in 
patients after AMI, finding a significant improvement in LVEF following cell therapy.47 
Subsequently, Hare et al. administered intravenous allogeneic MSCs vs. placebo to AMI 
patients approximately 7–10 days after PCI, and found similar adverse event rates between 
the two groups, but also a trend toward improved LVEF and functional capacity in the 
treatment group.48 Despite a previous preclinical study reporting a high risk of micro-
infarction from intracoronary delivery,49 available randomized placebo-controlled human 
studies have shown no significant adverse events after intracoronary or intravenous delivery 
of MSCs.34
After these encouraging initial results with BM-derived MSCs, investigators then turned 
their attention to the application of MSCs from adipose tissue and the umbilical cord. In 
2004, Vulliet et al. randomized 14 patients with anterior AMI to receive intracoronary 
infusion of adipose-derived MSCs versus placebo (APOLLO) and showed that the treatment 
was safe with a trend towards a small reduction in infarct size.49 Further information on the 
efficacy and safety of these cells in patients with acute MI will be available after the release 
of findings from a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb/III 
clinical sponsored by Cytori Therapeutics (ADVANCE study, NCT01216995). More 
recently, Gao et al. reported that intracoronary infusion of MSCs derived from umbilical 
cord obtained from healthy donors after full term birth resulted in a significant improvement 
in LVEF, LV volumes, and perfusion compared to controls at 18 months.25 It should be 
emphasized, however, that given the limited number of studies performed using MSCs and 
the relatively small sample size in each study, definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy 
of this cell population cannot be made at the present. Additional studies with larger sample 
sizes using MSCs are needed to validate these findings.
Finally, in a recent study CArdiosphere-Derived aUtologous stem CElls to reverse 
ventricUlar dysfunction (CADUCEUS) trial, Makkar et al. reported the first randomized, 
phase I trial evaluating the therapeutic effects of CDCs in the treatment of AMI.30 Patients 
with recent AMI and LVEF 25–45% were randomized to receive CDC therapy (n=23) or 
standard therapy (n = 8). Varying doses of CDCs were injected via intracoronary infusion 
approximately at 65 days after AMI. Results at 6 and 12 months of follow up showed that no 
patients died or developed cardiac tumors. However, at 12 months, one patients suffered a 
non-ST elevation MI and another patient required coronary vascularization.50 Although 
there was a significant decrease in scar size, increase in viability, and improvement in 
regional wall function after CDC treatment, there were no significant improvements in 
global systolic function or quality of life assessments. Subsequent studies such as the 
REgenerative CardiOsphere iNjection to STRengthen dysfUnCTional Hearts 
(RECONSTRUCT) trial and the ALLogeneic Heart STem Cells to Achieve Myocardial 
Regeneration (ALLSTAR) trial are underway to evaluate the efficacy of autologous and 
allogenic CSCs, respectively, in treating AMI.

 Chronic Ischemia with Intractable Angina—Patients with intractable angina due to 
ischemia that is otherwise not amenable to revascularization may also benefit from therapy 
with stem cells. Losordo et al. published the first Phase I/IIa trial evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of intramyocardial transplantation of autologous CD34+ stem cells in 24 patients 
with intractable angina.51 Although results were not significant due to a small sample size, 
improvements in angina and exercise time were noted in the treatment group without safety 
issues. Importantly, in a follow-up study that included a larger sample of patients (n=167),52 
the cell therapy group reported less frequent angina with improved exercise tolerance. 
Cardiac enzyme elevation, however, was reported in both the control and treatment after cell 
mobilization with G-CSF. More recently, Wang et al. reported similar efficacy results with 
the use of an intracoronary method for delivering EPCs.53
Ischemic Cardiomyopathy—The initial proposed mechanism of cardiogenesis made 
ischemic cardiomyopathy an attractive indication for adult stem cell therapy to replace the 
significant cardiomyocyte loss that occurs. A pilot study in 2003 by Perin et al. randomized 
27 patients with ICM to receive transendocardial injection of BMMNCs or placebo.54 At 4 
months, there was a significant improvement in LVEF in patients with cell therapy versus 
placebo (29% vs. 20%; P=0.003) without an increase in serious adverse events. This study 
validated the safety of transendocardial injection of BMMNCs, leading to two large trials of 
BMMNC-based therapy for ICM. In the first trial, the Transplantation Of Progenitor Cells 
And REcovery of LV function in patients with Chronic ischemic Heart Disease (TOPCARE-
CHD) study, Assmus et al. randomized ICM patients to intracoronary infusion of BMMNCs 
vs. “circulating progenitor cells (CPCs)” derived from peripheral blood vs. placebo and 
found that transplantation of BMMNCs, as opposed to CPCs or placebo, resulted in a 
modest but significant improvement in LVEF at 3 months.55 These results, however, were 
not replicated in a second study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
(NHLBI), First Mononuclear Cells injected in the United States conducted by the 
Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (FOCUS-CCTRN),56 which did not show a 
significant improvement in LVEF at 6 months following transendocardial delivery of 
BMMNCs for treating ICM patients with LVEF <45%. Consistent with these findings, a 
recent Cochrane meta-analysis review that included 23 randomized control trials and 1,255 
participants found no short-term benefits (<12 months) associated with treatment with 
autologous BMMNCs.31 Longer-term results (≥12 months), however, showed that 
autologous BMMNCs reduced the incidence of mortality (RR=0.28, 95% CI 0.14–0.53, 
p=0.0001) and HF re-hospitalization (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07–0.94, P=0.04).
Several studies have compared the efficacy of BMMNCs versus MSCs. In 2014, Heldman et 
al. reported a phase I/II study on the transendocardial delivery of BMMNCs versus BM-
derived autologous MSCs versus placebo for ICM patients with LVEF <50%.57 Although 
small in size, significant improvements in HF symptoms, infarct size, and regional 
myocardial function were observed in patients treated with MSCs. Because BM-derived 
MSCs require significant preparation time, Hare et al. conducted a study comparing the 
safety and efficacy of using allogenic instead of autologous MSCs in a non-placebo 
controlled, randomized, dose-escalating trial (POSEIDON).26 While treatment with both cell 
types resulted in reduction in the infarct size, only autologous MSCs led to improved quality

 of life score and 6-minute walk test. Ascheim et al. also reported the use of allogenic MSCs 
for patients with advanced HF randomized to myocardial injections of MSC versus placebo 
at the time of LVAD implantation.58 Although imaging surrogates for improvement failed to 
reach statistical significance, the study demonstrated no increase in incidence of HLA 
antibodies to indicate immunologic reactions. Recently, Perin et al. reported improvement in 
exercise tolerance with higher peak VO2 but not in in LVEF for 27 ICM patients receiving 
adipose-derived MSCs, suggesting that the injected MSCs may promote angiogenesis 
through its paracrine effects.59 Taken together, these studies support the safety of BMMNCs 
and MSCs in ICM patients and suggest that MSCs may be more beneficial than BMMNCs. 
It should be noted, however, that three patients with ICM enrolled in one of two sister trials 
sponsored by Cytori Inc. (ATHENA I and II: NCT01556022 and NCT02052427) developed 
reversible, cerebrovascular events after receiving intramyocardial injection of adipose 
derived stem cells in one of two sister randomized, controlled trials evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of these cells delivered through intra-myocardial injection in patients with ICM.
With the introduction of potential residential cardiac progenitor cells, the use of CSCs for 
ICM was studied in the Stem Cell Infusion in Patients with Ischemic cardiOmyopathy 
(SCIPIO) trial.60 In this phase I trial, CSCs were isolated from the right atrial appendage at 
the time of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cultured CSCs were then delivered to 
the patients via intracoronary injection at a later time (mean of 113 days after surgery). 
Published findings indicate that patients had improved LVEF, regional contractility, and HF 
symptoms when treated with CSCs versus no treatment.
Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy—Limited but increasing research effort has been made 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cell therapy for treating non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
(NICM). One of the largest studies to date on cell therapy for NICM randomized 110 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in a 1:1 ratio to receive intracoronary infusion of 
autologous peripheral CD34+ cells or no therapy.21 In this study, CD34+ cells mobilized by 
G-CSF were injected into the coronary artery territory with the greatest perfusion defect as 
identified by myocardial scintigraphy. At 1 year and 5 years, the treatment group showed a 
significant improvement in LVEF and 6-minute walk distance.21
Limitations of Adult Stem Cell Trials Performed To Date
As discussed above and outlined in Table 1 and 2, there are significant differences in the 
reported benefit between the early randomized controlled trials compared to more recent 
randomized controlled trials using adult stem cells. The reasons for these differences in 
efficacy remain unclear, but may be partially due to variations in trial design and 
methodology, including differences in the chosen cell source, dosing or concentration, the 
route of administration, timing of delivery, and clinical characteristics of patients recruited in 
the trial (Figure 2). Furthermore, the lack of standardized protocols limits our ability to 
evaluate the relative effectiveness of these approaches and most importantly the optimal cell 
source for each. While a handful of studies performed head-to-head comparisons of efficacy 
between two different cell types or among multiple doses,48,52 additional studies are needed 
to identify the optimal strategy for clinical application.

 Discrepancies in reporting have also been recently identified as another potential source of 
inconsistency. Nowbar et al. performed a recent meta-analysis of 49 trials to determine if the 
number of discrepancies in trial design, methods and results was associated with 
improvement in LVEF.61 They found a positive relationship between the number of 
discrepancies and improvement in LVEF, raising questions about the validity of earlier 
studies. Results from this study emphasize the need to adhere to rigorous standards in 
conducting and reporting future stem cell clinical trials.
Another possible source of difference in reported efficacy is the over-reliance on surrogate 
imaging endpoints, which have inherent inter- and intra-observer variability. Earlier trials 
have relied on imaging endpoints such as changes in LVEF, infarct size, and perfusion 
abnormalities because they are more easily measured, require smaller sample size and 
shorter follow-up. Surrogate endpoints, however, are generally limited by their degree of 
correlation with MACE, which casts significant doubt as to the clinical relevance of the 
outcomes observed. Even the most well-studied surrogate endpoint (i.e., global LVEF) does 
not consistently parallel survival.62 Surrogate endpoints are also not accepted as primary 
endpoints by the US Food and Drug Administration for Phase III trials.
More recently, stem cell trials in AMI and HF have incorporated more definitive endpoints 
such as the incidence of death, infarction, HF, and arrhythmias,31,32 but these were low-
frequency events, resulting in inadequate power to detect significant differences. To address 
this limitation, European investigators have begun recruiting for the effect of intracoronary 
reinfusion of Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells on all-cause mortality in Acute 
Myocardial Infarction (BAMI: NCT01569178) study, the largest stem cell trial using 
BMMNCs to date. The trial is recruiting 3,000 patients with AMI and LVEF <45% and is 
powered to detect a 25% decrease in 2-year all cause mortality after treatment. Results from 
this trial will help us determine whether further investment in BMMNCs is warranted.
Conclusion
In the past two decades, researchers have achieved significant milestones toward their goal 
of bringing stem cell regenerative medicine to the bedside. First, evidence suggests the 
benefit of adult stem cell therapy is likely mediated by the release of cardio-protective 
factors that activate endogenous pathways to repair the myocardium rather than de novo 
cardiomyocyte or blood vessel formation. Second, safe delivery of cells has been 
demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical trials, although the question of clinical efficacy 
of adult stem cell therapies remains elusive. Future research efforts should focus on 
developing new strategies to expand our knowledge of stem cell biology, following the fate 
of stem cells post-delivery, and designing larger trials using clinically meaningful endpoints 
rather than surrogate endpoints to better investigate their therapeutic potential.

 Figure 1. Schematic of the proposed mechanism of action of stem cell therapy
The figure illustrates the theoretical mechanisms of action of various stem cell populations 
proposed in the literature. Although stem cells can potentially repair the injured myocardium 
by increasing angiogenesis, releasing factors that reduce cell death or modulate the immune 
system (e.g., paracrine activation), and/or creating new heart tissue, thus far only paracrine 
activation has been proven while the other hypotheses remain controversial. Stem cell 
sources include: 1) the bone marrow which contains the most diverse group of cells (e.g., 
HSCs, EPCs, MSCs, and specific stromal cell subpopulations) and factors (e.g., cytokine 
and growth factors) that can potentially regenerate the myocardium; 2) other sources of 
MSCs such as adipose tissue and the umbilical cord; and 3) cardiac tissue that may contain 
cardiac progenitor cells or cardiospheres. HSCs: hematopoietic stem cells, EPCs: endothelial 
progenitor cells, BM: bone marrow, SCs: stem cells, GFs: growth factors, MSCs: 
mesenchymal stem cells, CSCs: cardiac stem cells, CDCs: cardiosphere-derived cells.

 Figure 2. Overview of the various patient cohorts, cell types, doses, routes of delivery, and 
clinical endpoints used in adult stem cell trials
A significant difference in efficacy has been observed in earlier randomized, controlled trials 
versus later randomized, controlled trials, which may be partially explained by variations in 
patient cohorts, cell types, doses, routes of delivery, and clinical endpoints evaluated in adult 
stem cell trials. Trials have been conducted in patients with various cardiac diseases 
including AMI, chronic ischemia/angina, ischemic CM, and non-ischemic CM. Within each 
cohort, certain patient characteristics may also affect efficacy such as transplanting bone 
marrow acquired from young versus old patients, delivering cells to patients immediately 
versus weeks/months post MI, and treating patients who have suffered small versus large 
infarct or who have mild (<45%) versus significant (<35%) impairment in LVEF. Various 
adult stem cell types have also been evaluated, including bone-marrow derived cells (e.g., 
BMMNCs, CD34+ or CD133+ cells, and MSCs) and adipose/umbilical derived SCs, as well 
as stem cells derived from cardiac tissue (e.g., CSCs and CDCs). These cells have been 
delivered in multiple doses and with different delivery approaches. Finally, most studies 
have used surrogate endpoints like LVEF, infarct size, and perfusion defects, which do not 
always correlate with more definite endpoints such as death, myocardial infarction, 
revascularization, heart failure readmission, and other major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE).
