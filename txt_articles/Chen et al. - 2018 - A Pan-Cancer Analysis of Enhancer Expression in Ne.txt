SUMMARY
The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding
regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development
has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present
the detection and characterization of a large number
of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis
of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types
using TCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched
normal tissues, global enhancer activation was
observed in most cancers. Across cancer types,
global enhancer activity was positively associated
with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggest-
ing a hypothesis centered on ‘‘chromatin-state’’ to
explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA co-
expression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed
a computational method to infer causal enhancer-
gene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically
actionable genes. Having identified an enhancer
�140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immuno-
therapy target, we validated it experimentally. This
study provides a systematic view of enhancer
activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the
clinical implications of enhancers.
INTRODUCTION
The biological functions of each cell component are controlled
by a Russian-nesting-doll-like multi-level gene-regulatory hier-
archy that includes transcription-factor-promoter interaction,
enhancer activation, DNA methylation, microRNA-mediated
regulation, translation, and post-translational modification (He
and Hannon, 2004; Jaenisch and Bird, 2003; Murakawa et al.,
2016). In cancer cells, such regulatory networks are often re-
wired by molecular aberrations that collectively lead to the can-
cer phenotype (Chen et al., 2015; Kolch et al., 2015). For
example, somatic mutations can modify the functions of both
trans and cis elements in a regulatory network, thereby confer-
ring cell behaviors related to tumorigenesis (Garraway and
Lander, 2013; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Using high-
throughput molecular profiling techniques over large patient co-
horts, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network et al., 2013) has systematically characterized
key molecular alterations at different levels in a broad range of
cancer types, providing unprecedented insight into oncogenic
mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches.
However, our information on the rewiring of gene regulatory
networks in cancer is far from complete, and enhancers repre-
sent a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle (Aran and Hellman,
2013). Enhancers are important non-coding DNA elements that
interact spatially with their target promoters to regulate down-
stream genes (Schmitt et al., 2016). As a major category of reg-
ulatory elements in cell development, enhancers also play critical
roles in the oncogenic process (Murakawa et al., 2016). Despite
recent systematic efforts, including genome-wide profiling of tis-
sue and cell line collections (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012;
Hnisz et al., 2013; Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al.,
2015) and a pan-cancer analysis of some super-enhancers
(Zhang et al., 2016), a global view of enhancer activity in cancer
is still lacking. That hole in our understanding is due in part to the
technical difficulty of applying high-throughput techniques (e.g.,
ChIP-seq) to investigate enhancer activity using large patient
sample cohorts.
The
Functional
Annotation
of
the
Mammalian
Genome
(FANTOM) Project has generated large-scale, high-quality anno-
tation of �65,000 enhancers expressed in the human genome
across multiple tissues (Andersson et al., 2014). FANTOM thus
provides an alternative solution for studying enhancer activities
in cancer. An inactive enhancer is usually well organized by un-
modified nucleosomes, so it cannot be accessed by either tran-
scription factors or polymerase. When an enhancer is primed for
activation in response to signaling, its local chromatin is first
modified (often by H3K4Me1) and becomes loose, rendering
the motifs on the enhancer available to transcription factors
and RNA polymerase. When the bound transcription factors fully
activate the enhancer, usually with re-marked by H3K27Ac, the
local chromatin is completely open, recruiting RNA polymerase
to initiate transcription in both directions (Figure 1A) (Heinz
et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Murakawa et al., 2016). Thus, the
expression level of enhancer RNA molecules represents an

 essential signature of enhancer activation (Murakawa et al.,
2016; Ren, 2010). Indeed, the expression of a substantial propor-
tion of enhancers can be detected by RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) (Andersson et al., 2014; De Santa et al., 2010; Djebali
et al., 2012; Murakawa et al., 2016). Using the high-quality
expressed enhancer annotations in the FANTOM project, we
performed a pan-cancer analysis of enhancer expression using
TCGA RNA-seq data on the premise that the expression of
an enhancer approximately reflects its activity. We aimed to
achieve the following: (1) describe the global pattern of enhancer
expression in cancers; (2) understand how enhancer activation
relates to other genomic aberrations and to the relevant underly-
ing mechanisms; and (3) identify key enhancers and explore their
potential clinical implications.
RESULTS
Overview of Enhancer Expression in Human Cancers
An enhancer’s expression level has been used as an index of
its activity (Cheng et al., 2015; Natoli and Andrau, 2012). The
FANTOM Project annotated enhancers based on integration of
chromatin modification, transcription factor binding, cap anal-
ysis of gene expression (CAGE)-seq data (Andersson et al.,
2014), and TCGA-generated gene-expression data using RNA-
seq. To ensure the quality of our analysis, we first assessed
whether TCGA’s RNA-seq platform could effectively capture
the
transcriptional
signals
from
the
FANTOM
enhancers.
Through a series of filters, we identified 15,808 detectable
enhancers out of �65,000 FANTOM-annotated enhancers
with a typical length of �200 bp that do not overlap with other
known transcribed elements, thereby avoiding potential signal
contamination (Figure S1A, Table S1, and STAR Methods). We
examined the chromatin status of the flanking 1-kb sequences
of those enhancers using several well-established factors,
including DNase hypersensitivity, p300 binding, CTCF binding,
H3K27Ac, and H3K4Me1 (Heintzman et al., 2007). That analysis
revealed chromatin signatures that are similar to those identified
by classical enhancers but are in sharp contrast to those of the
transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of protein-coding genes or
lncRNAs. For example, H3K4Me1, a key marker that distin-
guishes enhancers from any other TSSs, was substantially en-
riched in our enhancer set but showed a clear depletion in the
TSSs of protein-coding genes (Figure 1B). The observed chro-
matin signatures were not affected by genomic annotation (Fig-
ure S1B). Those results confirm that our set consists principally
of genuine enhancers rather than other transcribed units or tran-
scriptional noise.
In the TCGA RNA-seq data on 8,928 cancer samples of 33
cancer types (Table S2), we observed a substantial number of
RNA-seq reads uniquely assigned to the 15,808 enhancers.
Those mapped reads showed clear peaks centered on the en-
hancers identified (Figure 1C). That clear pattern confirmed the
biological significance of our cross-platform integration and
distinguished the signals from transcriptional noise. Another po-
tential issue in our analysis of enhancers arose from the relatively
low depth of RNA-seq data (Li et al., 2016). To evaluate the gen-
eral utility of TCGA RNA-seq data for enhancer expression, we
determined the numbers of enhancers with detectable expres-
sion in different cancer types. On average, 4,591 enhancers
were detected in > 10% of the samples in a given cancer type,
suggesting that enhancer expression signals detected contain
considerable sampling power to represent cancer enhancer
functions on a global scale (Figure 1D and Table S3). To evaluate
further the clinical significance of the enhancer expression, we
assessed correlations of the expression levels with patient sur-
vival in each of the 25 cancer types that had sufficient sample
size and follow-up time. That analysis identified a few dozen to
thousands of prognostic enhancers per cancer type, and some
of them tended to correlate with prognosis across multiple can-
cer types (Figures 1E, S1C, and S1D and Tables S1 and S4).
Given the same sample cohorts and FDR cutoff = 0.05, we
compared the proportions of enhancers and protein-coding
genes that showed prognostic significance. Interestingly, in
most cancer types, the fraction of enhancers with prognostic
power was comparable to, or even higher than, that of protein-
coding genes (Figure 1F). Finally, we examined the variation
in enhancer expression across cancer types based on global
enhancer expression level (summarizing over all of the en-
hancers surveyed, in reads per million mapped reads [RPM]).
Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) showed the lowest global
enhancer expression level (�100 RPM), and thymoma (THYM)
showed the highest (�240 RPM). Within each cancer type, there
was also large variation (as large as �5-fold) among patient sam-
ples (Figure 1G). Compared with adjacent normal tissues from
the same patients, most cancer types showed global enhancer
activation (paired t test, p < 0.05, for 13 cancer types that
had > 10 matched tumor-normal pairs, Figure 1H). Collectively,
those results present a general picture of enhancer expression
in human cancers and suggest that enhancer expression sig-
nals detected from TCGA RNA-seq data represent a biological
dimension of interest, complementary to other genomic features.
The enhancer expression datasets presented here provide a
starting point for exploration by the research community.
Global Enhancer Activation in Cancer Is Positively
Associated with Tumor Aneuploidy
Somatic copy-number alteration (SCNA) and point mutation are
the two most common types of mutational events that impact
the stability of a cancer genome. To explore the relationship
between genomic instability and enhancer expression in cancer,
we determined the correlations of global enhancer expression
level (RPM) with the SCNA and mutation burdens in each cancer

 type. Specifically, for a given tumor sample, we used the aneu-
ploidy value (defined as the fraction of the genome affected by
SCNAs) from Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays and the total number of
silent somatic mutations from whole-exome sequencing to
quantify the global SCNA level and mutation burden, respec-
tively. For the majority of cancer types surveyed (19 out of 25
cancer types with R 80 samples), the aneuploidy level showed
a significantly positive correlation with the global enhancer acti-
vation level (Figure 2A). In contrast, point mutations showed no
correlation or a slight negative correlation (Figure 2B). These re-
sults indicate complex relationships between enhancer activa-
tion and different types of genomic aberrations in cancer.
To explore further the global patterns of enhancer expression
across cancer types, we performed consensus clustering of tu-
mor samples using the 1,500 (�10% of 15,808) enhancers with
the highest coefficients of variation (CV) across samples (STAR
Methods). Enhancer expression levels were Z-normalized within
each cancer type to minimize tissue effects. The analysis re-
sulted in three robust subtypes (clusters): C1, C2, and C3 were
separated in the space of the top three principal components,
and the clusters were not driven by disease type (Figures 2C,
2D, and S2). Comparison of the enhancer-based subtypes with
well-established pathological subtypes further supported the
biological significance of the clustering (Figures S3A and S3B).
The most distinct feature among the subtypes was their differen-
tial levels of global enhancer expression: the enhancer expres-
sion levels of the three subtypes were higher than those of their
normal counterparts; subtype C2 showed the highest level of
enhancer activation, 1.25- or 1.15-fold higher than that of normal
or C1 and C3 samples (Figure 2E). Notably, the 15% increase of
global enhancer expression was a large effect, indicating > 400
more activated enhancers in C2 than in C1 and C3 samples,
up to be �30% of the active enhancers that a tumor usually
has (Figure 2F). Consistent with the associations between aneu-
ploidy and global enhancer expression within individual cancer
types, �25% of a typical C2 genome was affected by aneu-
ploidy, 1.5-fold more than that of a typical C1 (16%) or C3
(15%) genome (Figure 2G), indicating thousands more genes
perturbed by SCNAs. In terms of mutation burden, subtype C1
samples contained slightly more point mutations than subtype
C2, and both C1 and C2 showed significantly higher mutation
burdens than subtype C3 (Figure 2H). We also saw that some
cancer driver genes appeared to be under strong positive selec-
tion in subtype C1 (Figures S3C and S3D). For example, C1 had a
1.5-fold higher TP53 truncation rate than did the others. The de-
coupling of point mutations and global enhancer activation in the
above pan-cancer analysis is compatible with the patterns we
observed within cancer types (Figures 2A and 2B). Taken
together, the correlations of enhancer activation with genomic
instability can be summarized as a tree (Figure 2I): subtype C1
was enriched with samples having high mutation load and low
aneuploidy; subtype C2 was enriched with samples having
high mutation load and high aneuploidy; and C3 was ‘‘normal-
like,’’ with low mutation load and low aneuploidy. Both the ana-
lyses within cancer types and the analyses across cancer types
indicate that SCNAs, but not point mutations, are positively
associated with enhancer activation.
A ‘‘Chromatin-State’’-Centered Model for the Interplay
of Enhancer Activation, SCNAs, and Point Mutations
The above section raised a question of great interest: why do
SCNAs and point mutations correlate with global enhancer acti-
vation in cancer differently (or even, to some extent, inversely in
some cancer types)? Variations in chromatin organization of the
human genome have been reported to be major determinants
of the variation of somatic mutation rates across the genome
(Schuster-Bo
¨ ckler and Lehner, 2012); low mutation rate is a
feature of open DNA because of their accessibility by the DNA
repair machineries (Figure 3A) (Polak et al., 2014). Interestingly,
chromatin opening happens to be a prerequisite for enhancer
activity (Figure 1A). Upon activation, enhancers loop to, and
interact with, their target DNAs, creating topological DNA-DNA
interactions (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, long-range DNA-DNA
contacts physically increase the chance for loci far apart on
the 1D-sequence to meet and rearrange with each other when
breaks occur, generating structural alterations (Figure 3A) (Fu-
denberg et al., 2011). Those observations collectively suggest
a molecular mechanism in which SCNAs and point mutations
are differently associated with global enhancer activation pat-
terns established through differences in the openness of chro-
matin. In that model, compact chromatin favors point mutation
and keeps enhancers silent; once chromatin opens, enhancers
are more likely to be activated. Meanwhile, because unfolded
DNA is elongated by one to two orders of magnitudes, long-
range DNA-DNA interactions are more likely to occur, which
increases the chance of DNA rearrangements (SCNAs).

(C and D) Consensus clustering analysis identified three major enhancer expression subtypes. Within each cancer type, the log2RPKM values of 15,808
enhancers were scaled to the Z score before clustering to correct for tissue-specific patterns that would otherwise affect the clustering. Consensus clustering
based on 1,500 enhancers (�10%) with the highest coefficients of variation identified three major clusters. The Z score matrix was projected onto the first three
dimensions identified in principal component analysis, with colors representing the (C) three clusters or (D) cancer types.

 To test that hypothetical model further, we used SCNA and
mutation data from whole-genome sequencing to perform the
analysis across different genomic regions, thereby providing
evidence independent of that from our cross-sample analyses
(Figure 3B and STAR Methods). A direct prediction of the model
is that loose and compact chromatin regions in the cancer
genome are dominated by SCNAs and mutations, respectively.
Consistent with that prediction, in the cross-genomic-region
analysis (using 1 Mb as a unit), DNA regions that featured
markers
of
open
chromatin
(DNA
hypersensitivity
and
H3K27Ac) were associated with higher rates of DNA double-
strand breaks (DBSs) and lower mutation rates. Also, as pre-
dicted, the relationship between chromatin state and enhancer
expression was the same as that for chromatin state and
DSBs. In contrast, closed chromatin, characterized by histone

 opposite pattern (Figure 3B). We also observed a significantly
negative association between point mutations and enhancer
activation across genomic regions (rho = �0.46, n = 2663,
p < 10�16). That correlation was much stronger than those in
cross-sample comparisons (only 4 out of 25 cancer types
showed significant negative correlations; Figure 2B). Those dif-
ferences are probably due to genome-wide SCNA and mutation
burdens positively correlated across tumor samples of different
disease stages (Figure S4). Further, according to the model
posited here, the long-range DNA-DNA interactions (Hi-C inter-
actions) in open chromatin should at least partially explain the
coincidence of enhancer activation and SCNAs across different
genomic regions. To test that possibility, we examined the 500
10-kb fragments of the human genome with the highest DSB
rates. We found that �40% (n = 204) of them overlapped with
anchors of Hi-C loops, representing a > 3-fold enrichment
(p < 10�3, permutation test, Figure 3C). The same anchor regions
also tended to overlap with the enhancers in our study
(n = 15808; enrichment = 1.9-fold, p < 10�3; permutation test,
Figure 3D). As summarized in Figure 3E, this hypothetical
model provides a simple and reasonable, although tentative,
explanation for differential associations of enhancer activation
with SCNAs and with mutations.
Systematic Identification of Causal Enhancer-Cancer
Gene Interactions
To elucidate the molecular functions of individual enhancers in
cancer development and assess their clinical utility, it is impor-
tant to identify their downstream target genes. Although new
technologies like Hi-C (Jin et al., 2013) have been used to infer
enhancer-gene interactions at the level of chromatin blocks
(Dekker et al., 2013), computational methods that can accurately
pinpoint target genes are seriously needed. Integrating enhancer
and mRNA expression data, we can obtain candidate target
genes of an enhancer through co-expression analysis. For a
given enhancer-gene combination that is co-expressed, there
are at least three possible relationship models: (1) a causal rela-
tionship, in which changes in the expression of the enhancer
cause differential expression of the gene; (2) a reactive relation-
ship, in which the gene is upstream of the enhancer; and (3) a
co-responsive relationship, in which the enhancer and the
gene are both responding to other molecular changes (Fig-
ure 4A). To distinguish the first (causal) model from the other
two, we introduced expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) infor-
mation. The rationale was as follows: in the causal model, but not
the other two, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that
affects the enhancer’s activity would also affect expression of
the enhancer’s downstream target gene, thereby making the
SNP (or a nearby, genetically linked SNP) an eQTL of the gene
of interest. Finally, for such enhancer-gene pairs, we can use
recently available Hi-C data to assess whether the imputed
causal relationship is (or is not) likely to be direct regulation.
Following the logic above, we developed a computational
method to identify potential causal and direct enhancer-gene
regulations (Figure 4B). First, we selected enhancers with at least
one nearby (< 500 bp) common SNP annotated in the 1000 Ge-
nomes Project (minor allele frequency > 20%) or GTEx database
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012; Lappalainen
et al., 2013). We focused on a set of 822 cancer genes that com-
bined clinically actionable genes (i.e., biomarkers or therapeutic
targets) (n = 126), OncoKB (n = 476), and the Cancer Gene
Consensus (CGC, n = 567) (Chakravarty et al., 2017; Futreal
et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2016). Second, we performed a co-
expression analysis, which revealed �40,000 associations be-
tween the enhancers and the genes in R 4 of 33 TCGA cancer
types (absolute Spearman’s rho > 0.3 and FDR < 10�4; STAR
Methods). Third, we inferred casual relationships by examining
whether the SNP on a given enhancer was an eQTL of the co-ex-
pressed gene in either the 1000 Genomes or the GTEx dataset.
We then integrated the long-range DNA-DNA interaction data
from Hi-C (Rao et al., 2014) to predict whether causal relation-
ships were acting through direct enhancer-gene contacts or
through regulatory cascades. Specifically, if an enhancer and
its co-expressed gene were located in one of the two anchors
of a Hi-C DNA loop, the pair were considered as possible in-
stances of direct regulation if the signal in the eQTL analysis
was significant (p < 0.05). For enhancer-gene co-expression
pairs without detected Hi-C interactions, we set a more stringent
eQTL cutoff at (FDR < 10�4, with multiple comparison correction
to account for all SNPs of a given enhancer) and considered
them as instances of casual regulation.
Using that approach, we identified 65 such interactions
involving 49 enhancers and 47 cancer genes, resulting in a pre-
dicted enhancer-gene regulatory network (Figure 4C). In total,
22 and 8 of the cancer genes were annotated, respectively, as
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSG) in CGC, indi-
cating a trend toward oncogene regulations (background Onco-
genes: TSGs = 214: 198 in CGC, p = 0.037, chi-square test, Fig-
ure 4C). Those 30 genes are involved in diverse cancer hallmarks
with bias toward proliferation and metastasis, according to CGC
annotations (Figure 4D). Interestingly, consistent with the bias to-
ward oncogenes and the previously observed global enhancer
activation, our network is strongly enriched with positive regula-
tions, 43 of 54 (80%) and 11 of 11 (100%) for causal regulations
and direct causal regulations, respectively (p < 0.01 for both
enrichments, Figure 4E). Those results provide insight into the
way in which global enhancer activation may contribute to tumor
progression. They also identify individual enhancer-gene regula-
tions that may be crucial in cancer development or clinical
management.
Enhancers of Actionable Genes Show Potential Clinical
Relevance
To investigate regulation
by the enhancers identified
as
described above, we analyzed in detail an enhancer on chr22
(chr22:50980817�50981280, henceforth called enhancer 22)
and its inferred target SYK. The ENCODE ChIP-seq dataset an-
notates a large number of protein-DNA interaction peaks within
or flanking the enhancer 22 region (Figure 5A), suggesting its
role as a hub in a regulatory network. Three genetically linked
SNPs are located in the enhancer, all of which are SYK eQTLs.
For example, the T-allele of SNP rs5770772 was associated
with higher expression of both enhancer 22 and SYK than the
C-allele in the 1000 Genomes Project RNA-seq dataset (Figures
5B and 5C). When we analyzed the TCGA protein expression da-
taset, we confirmed that higher enhancer activity was associated

 with higher SYK protein levels (Figures 5D and 5E). SYK is an
oncogenic driver that is activated in multiple types of late-stage
cancer and is associated with poor clinical outcome (Puissant
et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015). Consistent with that relationship,
our own analysis of patient survival times further supported the
role of enhancer 22 as a marker of poor prognosis in several can-
cer types (Figures 5F–5K and S5). Since the eQTL, RNA-seq, and
protein data were generated from independent platforms and the
correlations were observed across multiple tissues of origin,
these results provide evidence that enhancer 22 is a prognostic
marker, largely through its effect on the downstream gene SYK.
Besides prognostic markers, enhancers may serve as predic-
tive markers for therapeutic response. PD-L1 plays a key role in a
cancer’s escape from attack by the immune system and thus has
been a major target of ‘‘check-point inhibition’’ immunotherapy,
most prominently for lung cancer and melanoma (Topalian et al.,
2016). In our enhancer-gene regulation network, we found an
enhancer (chr9:5580709-5581016, hereafter called enhancer 9)
located �140kb from PD-L1. We observed strong co-expression
between the PD-L1 mRNA level and the enhancer expression in
multiple cancer types (Figure 6A). We then validated the co-
expression in a cohort of 130 lung cancer cell lines from the Can-
cer Cell Line Encyclopedia database (Figure 6B). A PD-L1 eQTL
close to the enhancer suggests the enhancer as an upstream
regulator (Figure 6C). The Hi-C dataset from a panel of seven hu-
man cell lines further confirmed a direct interaction between the
PD-L1 gene and the enhancer (Figures 6D and S6A). Interest-
ingly, out of the 161 transcription factors surveyed in the
ENCODE project, NF-kB (measured with RELA/p65 ChIP-seq
data) was the only one annotated for enhancer 9. Consistently,
ChIP-seq data showed a strong NF-kB binding signal on the
enhancer 9 and on the p65 binding motif of PD-L1’s promoter
(Figure 6E), strongly suggesting that NF-kB complex is involved
in the enhancer/PD-L1 interaction. Consistent with that idea, the
NF-kB dimer has recently been reported to be essential to PD-L1
activation (Gowrishankar et al., 2015). To validate the causal ef-
fects of enhancer 9 on PD-L1 expression, we designed three
pairs of single-guide CRISPR/Cas9 RNAs (sgRNAs) to delete
enhancer 9. Using the most effective sgRNA pair, we obtained
a stable lung cancer A549 cell line with the homozygous
enhancer 9 deletion (Figures 6F, S6B, and STAR Methods). As
predicted, knockout of enhancer 9 substantially reduced PD-
L1 expression (�10-fold) at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig-
ures 6G and 6H) and largely masked the inductive effect
(�80% reduction) of IFN-g (activating NF-kB) on PD-L1 expres-
sion (Figures 6H and S6C). Collectively, these results suggest an
NF-kB-mediated enhancer-promoter interaction model of PD-L1
activation (Figure 6I). This example highlights the potentially
important way in which enhancers can modulate key therapeutic
targets.
DISCUSSION
Although the role of enhancers in cancer development has
increasingly been recognized, genome-wide profiling studies
on enhancer activity using conventional techniques (e.g.,
ChIP-seq) over large patient sample cohorts have not been
done. Using TCGA RNA-seq data, we characterized the
enhancer expression landscape in a broad range of cancer
types. We observed global enhancer activation positively asso-
ciated with large SCNAs, but not point mutations, and proposed
a model in which chromatin state is a key contributor to the
observed genomic patterns. In contrast to closed chromatin,
which favors point mutations (Polak et al., 2014), open DNA pro-
motes structural rearrangements through long-range DNA-DNA
interaction and activates enhancers by exposing them to tran-
scription factors. The model provides insights into mutational
landscape and clonal evolution. Epigenetic status, including his-
tone modifications, nucleosome packaging, and DNA methyl-
ation, could be precisely inherited during cell division (Probst
et al., 2009). Variations in chromatin organization in a single
tumor progenitor cell could, therefore, create striking differences
among tumors if their effects are accumulated for many genera-
tions of cell growth. Chromatin organization could be substan-
tially remodeled by histone gene mutations, which are frequently
seen in cancers (Yuen and Knoepfler, 2013), or by chromatin re-
modeling events such as SMURF2 or HMGB1 loss of function
(Blank et al., 2012; Celona et al., 2011) that globally loosen the
structure of the genome (Schwab, 2009). Such events could
create high cross-patient diversity of chromatin organization
that may have crucial effects on genomic features such as
SCNAs, point mutations, and enhancer activation. Thus, chro-
matin state could substantially shape the mutational landscape
and at least partially explain an interesting, but incompletely un-
derstood, observation that tumors tend to be driven by either
mutation (M class) or copy-number alteration (C class) (Ciriello
et al., 2013). Due to the polyA selection and relatively low depth
of TCGA RNA-seq data, our analysis only covered a proportion
of enhancers in the human genome and may contain some noise.
Therefore, further efforts using alternative technologies would be
required to achieve a more comprehensive picture of enhancer
activity in human cancers.

 The global enhancer activation we observed in cancer sam-
ples (relative to those from normal issues, as shown in Figures
1H and 2E) also provides insights into the clonal evolution of tu-
mors. In contrast with microRNAs, which are dominantly down-
regulated in cancer (Lu et al., 2005), enhancers are globally acti-
vated. Those up- and downregulations both serve to upregulate
a large number of protein-coding genes, raising the question of
their selective advantages. They may be a handy solution to
stress in the short term of cancer evolution (Yona et al., 2012),
in which activation of oncogenes and loss of TSGs are favored.
However, given the nature of mutations, loss-of-function muta-
tions are much easier to obtain than gain-of-function (activating)
ones. As a result, cells with global gene activation could benefit
from the advantages of oncogene activation. Meanwhile, the
hitchhiked TSGs would be inactivated by loss-of-function muta-
tions, which are more easily generated. Such an alternative may
be particularly favored in cancer evolution (Yona et al., 2012).
The co-expression-based enhancer-gene regulatory network
we infer here is of high value from the perspectives of both sys-
tems and translational research. ChIP-seq and CAGE-seq have
proven to be powerful techniques for searching enhancers (An-
dersson et al., 2014; Park, 2009). A DNA-DNA interaction-based
technique, Hi-C, has identified many enhancer-gene interactions
(Schmitt et al., 2016). However, these interactions have limita-
tions: (1) no regulatory relationship behind the interaction is guar-
anteed; and (2) usually, only low-resolution interactions are avail-
able. For example, a typical Hi-C result generates interactions at
a resolution level of 10–50 kb, whereas a typical enhancer is only
�200 bp in length (Schmitt et al., 2016). Therefore, the method
we propose, based on co-expression, eQTL, and Hi-C data inte-
gration, may be complementary to the other approaches. Due to
limited data from matched tissues across different datasets, we
combined signals from different tissues in our pipeline to infer
causal enhancer regulations, which may lead to some false pos-
itives. Independent experiments are required to validate the pro-
posed enhancer regulations. Our analysis reveals a considerable
number of enhancers, including enhancer 9 for PD-L1, that are
associated with clinically actionable genes, including the exper-
imentally validated regulation of enhancer 9 for PD-L1. These re-
sults suggest a conceptually alternative strategy to inhibit key
therapeutic targets, and further efforts are required to investigate
the potential of enhancers in clinical applications.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293T was obtained from the MD Anderson Characterized Cell Line Core Facility. HEK293FT and
A549 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HEK293T and HEK293FT cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37�C and 5% CO2. A549, A549-
cas9, and the cell lines established based on A549-cas9 were maintained in RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37�C and
5% CO2. The mycoplasma testing was confirmed to be negative for all the cell lines used in this study.
METHOD DETAILS
Annotation of expressed enhancers in TCGA RNA-seq data
We obtained the information for 65423 FANTOM enhancers (Andersson et al., 2014) from http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/datafiles/
latest/extra/Enhancers/human_permissive_enhancers_phase_1_and_2.bed.gz. For enhancer expression analysis, we first re-anno-
tated the 65423 FANTOM enhancers according to the University of California, Santa Cruz gene annotation file (refgene.txt), FANTOM
transcription start sites and alternative polyadenylation sites (Andersson et al., 2014). We removed those that overlapped with known
genes or intron regions, resulting in a subset of 15808 enhancers for which we could confidently assign the RNA-seq reads (Table S1).
As a further layer of quality control, we extended the definition of known transcription events to all Ensembl transcripts (v90) and iden-
tified 3228 out of 15808 enhancers overlapped with at least one Ensembl transcript (Table S1). All annotations were based on the
human genome build hg19. We obtained 8928 TCGA RNA-seq BAM files of 33 cancer types from CGHub or the NCI Genomic
Data Commons Data Portal. All these files were based on hg19 and processed by the TCGA genomic data analysis center at the
University of North Carolina.
Chromatin state analysis of enhancers
We obtained all experimental data of DNase hypersensitivity, p300 binding, CTCF binding, H3K4Me1, and H3K27Ac modification
from the ENCODE data portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/matrix/?type=Experiment). All files meeting the following criteria

 were included in the analysis: (1) Format = BigWig; (2) Genome version = Hg19; (3) Signal type = fold-change over control. The ChIP
signal of an interested DNA region was extracted from BigWig files using UCSC software bigWigAverageOverBed. We then chose the
output column ‘‘mean’’ to represent the signal intensity. ChIP signals were measured on the whole length of DNA or flanking 25 bp for
enhancers or TSSs, respectively. The TSSs loci were obtained from UCSC (refgene.txt). For any element of interest, we also obtained
the signal on its flanking 1kb regions (window size: 50 bp; step size: 50 bp). The 41 data points (50 bp 3 20 on up-stream sequence,
50 bp 3 20 on down-stream sequence, and one of the elements of interest, itself) were normalized as Z-scores. We then calculated
the mean signal across all aligned sequences in all cell lines to generate the chromatin status plots in Figure 1B and Figure S1B. To
further confirm the quality of our enhancer set, we compared them with all transcripts annotated by Ensembl, which was more
comprehensive but also noisier. We identified 3228 out of 15808 (�20%) enhancers overlapping with at least one Ensembl transcript,
but detected no differences on chromatin status between the two groups of enhancers; thus, we retained the 3228 enhancers for
further analysis.
For the genomic-region-based analysis, we first obtained a human genome benchmark from ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/
ftp/data/NA12878/analysis/NIST_union_callsets_06172013/union13callableMQonlymerged_addcert_nouncert_excludesimplerep_
excludesegdups_excludedecoy_excludeRepSeqSTRs_noCNVs_v2.18_2mindatasets_5minYesNoRatio.bed.gz,
which
excluded
the genomic regions that were ambiguous for mutation calling. We divided the human genome into 1Mb-sized fragments and
only retained 2663 fragments with > 50kb (5% of 1Mb) benchmark sequences. The ChIP signal of each fragment was measured
as described above except that only benchmark sequences were considered. For Hi-C data, we obtained the DNA-DNA interaction
loops from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GEO: GSE63525) (Rao et al., 2014). For breakpoint and mutation
data analysis, we downloaded the files CosmicGenomeScreensMutantExport.tsv.gz and CosmicNCV.tsv.gz from COSMIC FTP and
retained only the data annotated as ‘‘WGS’’ (whole genome sequencing) in both files. The mutation rate and breakpoint rate were
calculated in the benchmark regions on each 1Mb-sized fragment. For the double strand break (DSB) hotspots, we divided the
human genome into 10kb-sized fragments, calculated the DSB rate in the same way as for the 1Mb-sized fragments, and defined
the top 500 fragments as DSB hotspots in the human genome, with a minimal DSB rate of 1.6 breakpoints per kb.
Comparison of global enhancer activation between tumor and normal samples
Forthetumorversusnormaltissuecomparison, weconsideredatotal of13cancertypes with> 10tumor-normal samplepairs.Foreach
sample, we measured its global enhancer expression level by counting the number of reads per million mapped reads [RPM] on the
surveyed enhancers (n = 15808). The y axis of Figure 1H was defined as (RPMTumor/RPMNormal-1)%, where RPMTumor (or RPMNormal)
was the mean RPM cross all tumor (or normal) samples of a given cancer type. Statistics were performed using paired t test.
Consensus clustering of enhancer expression profile
We calculated the log2RPKM values of the enhancers in TCGA samples as previously described (Li et al., 2015). We excluded
599 samples with a low sequence depth to reduce noise and included 8329 samples in the clustering analysis. Within each of the
33 cancer types, we scaled the expression level (log2RPKM) of each enhancer into a Z-score. The Z-scores across all samples of
33 cancer types were combined to calculate the CV. The 10% (1,500 of 15808) of the enhancers with the highest CVs were subjected
to consensus clustering using the R package ‘‘ConsensusClusterPlus.’’ When the number of clusters (k) increased from 2 to 10,
we observed little gain of area under the cumulative distribution function curve in consensus clustering after k = 3 (Figure S2B), which
indicated that three clusters were identified in our analysis (Monti et al., 2003).
Integrative analysis of enhancer expression with other molecular and clinical data
For genomic variations, the SCNA level of each tumor was obtained from the cBioportal feature ‘‘fraction of copy number altered
genome,’’ while mutations (TCGA PanCanAtlas MC3) were obtained from the NCI Genomic Data Commons Data Portal. We used
the number of silent mutations per exome to quantify the overall mutation load since non-silent mutations could be largely affected
by positive selection. These statistics were obtained by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Subtype information was obtained from the
TCGA PanCanAtlas Pathway Analysis Working Group. The chi-square test was used to test the independence of the subtype and
enhancer cluster. For prognostic analysis, we first filtered the enhancers without detectable expression in > 10% of the samples
in each cancer type. For each of the remaining enhancers, we used the Cox regression model and log-rank test to determine
the enhancer’s prognostic power. Enhancers associated with either the overall survival time or progression-free interval time
(FDR < 0.05, John Storey’s correction, Table S4) were considered as prognostic enhancers.
Inference of causal enhancer–gene regulation
We first constructed a cancer-type–specific enhancer–gene co-expression network. Enhancers with common SNPs (minor allele fre-
quency > 0.2) in the 1000 Genomes Project dataset (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012) or GTEx dataset or within their
flanking 500 bp sequences were considered in this analysis. We combined a group of actionable genes (n = 126), OncoKB with the
Cancer Gene Consensus (n = 567) to be the cancer gene set in the analysis. In each cancer type, we used Spearman’s rank corre-
lation model with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons to determine the enhancer-gene co-expression. Co-expression of
an enhancer–gene pair was defined as significant co-expressions (absolute Spearman’s rho > 0.3 and FDR < 10�4) in at least four
cancer types (> 10% of the 33 cancer types). For each enhancer-gene co-expression pair, we then examined whether they contacted
e3

 each other directly through long-range DNA-DNA loops. If they were located respectively on the two anchors on any DNA loops
identified in NCBI GEO: GSE63525 (Rao et al., 2014), we considered the co-expression as a potential direct regulation, for which,
we then tested if the SNP on this enhancer was an eQTL of the paired gene (p < 0.05). For other co-expression pairs without detected
interaction through DNA loops, we applied a more stringent cutoff (FDR < 10�4) for the eQTL analysis. For both direct and indirect
regulations, the p values in eQTL tests were corrected according to the number of SNPs associated with each enhancer. The
RNA-seq and genotype data of the 1000 Genomes Project and GTEx were obtained from http://www.internationalgenome.org/
category/rnaseq/ and dbGAP (phg000520), respectively (Lappalainen et al., 2013). For the GTEx dataset, 11 tissues with R 80 sam-
ples were subjected to analysis: adipose_tissue, blood, blood_vessel, brain, esophagus, heart, lung, muscle, nerve, skin, and thyroid.
For the eQTL analysis, we first artificially assigned the genotype scores of 1, 2, and 3 to individuals with genotypes of 0/0, 0/1, and 1/1,
respectively. Spearman’s correlation between the genotype score and the gene’s expression was used to determine if the SNP was
an eQTL of the gene. If more than one SNP was associated with an enhancer, the results were subjected to Bonferroni’s correction.
Enhancer–gene pairs that survived the eQTL test were considered to have causal regulation.
Computational analysis of enhancer 9
We obtained the raw observation/expectation ratio (O/E ratio) representing the interaction level of distant genomic loci from GEO:
GSE63525 (Rao et al., 2014). The raw O/E ratio was normalized according to the ‘‘readme’’ description file in the dataset. We
then calculated the median O/E ratio of seven human cell lines of different tissue origins as the final interaction level, as presented
in Figure 6C. All the ENCODE ChIP-seq bigwig files (including NF-kB ChIP-seq data) were obtained from the ENCODE data portal.
The ChIP-seq signal intensities were extracted from bigwig files, and their mean values were used to measure the NF-kB binding
affinity on the enhancer 9 or PD-L1 promoter.
CRISPR/Cas9 genetic perturbation of enhancer 9
The single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences were designed using Cas-Designer (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-designer/) within
400 bp sequences flanking the enhancer region (chr9:5580709-5581016). Three gRNAs on either side of the enhancer were selected
from the results, generating 9 (3 3 3) possible combinations of sgRNA pairs (Figure S6B). The upstream and downstream sgRNA
sequences were synthesized and cloned into two CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (Addgene: 48138 and Addgene: 64324) that respectively
express GFP and mCherry as reporters. The sgRNA sequences were validated by Sanger sequencing after plasmid construction.
The plasmids with upstream and downstream sgRNAs were mixed and then transfected using lipofectamine 3000 into the human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line grown in Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) at 37�C and 5% CO2. Three independent transfections were carried out for each pair of sgRNAs. Genetic perturbation effi-
ciency was examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) six days after transfection. According to their efficiency, we chose
sgRNA-L2 and sgRNA-R3 to generate the enhancer 9 homozygous deletion cell line. To obtain a constant cas9 expression cell
line, we first packaged the cas9 plasmid (Addgene: 73310) into lentivirus in the HEK293FT cell line (grown in DMEM with 10%
FBS), and then infected the human lung cancer cell line A549 (grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS) by the lentivirus. After one
week of blasticidin (25 mg/ml) selection, the A549-cas9 cell line was established. On day 0, 500 ng plasmids with sgRNAs or scramble
controls were electroporated into A549-cas9 cell line using 100 ml tips at 1230V with 30ms width and 2 pulses (Neon Transfection
System, Life Technologies). After three days of puromycin (4 mg/ml) selection, single cells were seeded into 96-well plates. During
colony expansion, genotyping was carried out using KAPA Mouse Genotyping Kit (KAPA Biosystems) to screen single-cell clones
with the deletion of enhancer 9. We obtained a homozygous enhancer 9 deletion cell line and confirmed the deletion region by Sanger
sequencing. The mRNA and protein levels of PD-L1 expression after enhancer 9 deletion were measured by quantitative reverse-
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and western-blot assay, respectively. One day after cell seeding, IFN- g was added to the medium
at the final concentration of 1 ng/ml. The expression level of PD-L1 was quantitated three days later. For mRNA expression level,
RNA extraction was performed with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was used to reverse-transcribe 1 mg total RNA into cDNA. The SYBR select master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
the Mastercycler RealPlex4 (Eppendorf) were used to perform qRT-PCR, which used the following primer sequences. For ACTB,
the primer sequences were ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC/ CGTGGATGCCACAGGACT, and for PD-L1, the primer sequences were
GCATTTACTGTCACGGTTCC/ TGCTGAACCTTCAGGTCTTC. For protein expression level, whole-cell lysates were extracted with
RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease, and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails) and measured concentration using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each sample,
30 mg total protein was loaded into 4%–12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and depicted with
Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The following antibodies were used: PD-L1
(1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 13684T), ACTB (1:30,000, Sigma, A3854).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The analyses were based on 8928 tumor samples, except for the clustering analysis, which excluded 599 samples with a low read
coverage, and the survival analysis, which excluded 8 cancer types with insufficient patient survival data. The definitions of signifi-
cance for the various statistical tests are described and referenced in the respective Method Details sections.

(A) Global enhancer expression profile is associated with established cancer subtypes. Seven cancer types with > 200 samples having available subtyping
information and included in clustering analysis were considered. p values were calculated by chi-square test. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using
Bonferroni’s correction. Each row on the left panel shows a BRCA sample, with its molecular subtype and enhancer expression cluster indicated by color.
(B) Over/under-representation of the BRCA subtypes in the three clusters; p values calculated by chi-square test.
(C) Relative TP53 truncation rate of the three clusters. Absolute TP53 truncation rate was defined as the ratio of the number of TP53 truncations and the number of
total silent mutations. Relative rates were normalized to the C2 rate. Error bars show mean ± SE. Statistics were computed using t test.
(D) We selected 7 tumor suppressors (blue) and 11 oncogenes (red) that are most frequently affected by SCNAs in cancer. A thresholded value of �2/2 was
considered as deletion/amplification of a given tumor-suppressor or oncogene. Enrichment was calculated using chi-square test.
