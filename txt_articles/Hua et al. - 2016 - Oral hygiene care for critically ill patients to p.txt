Background
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as pneumonia developing in people who have received mechanical ventilation for
at least 48 hours. VAP is a potentially serious complication in these patients who are already critically ill. Oral hygiene care (OHC),
using either a mouthrinse, gel, toothbrush, or combination, together with aspiration of secretions, may reduce the risk of VAP in these
patients.
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral hygiene care on incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients receiving mechanical
ventilation in hospital intensive care units (ICUs).
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (to 17 December 2015), the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 17 December 2015),
Embase Ovid (1980 to 17 December 2015), LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (1982 to 17 December 2015), CINAHL
EBSCO (1937 to 17 December 2016), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to 14 January 2013), China National Knowledge
Infrastructure (1994 to 14 January 2013), Wan Fang Database (January 1984 to 14 January 2013) and VIP Database (January 2012 to
4 May 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for
ongoing trials to 17 December 2015. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic
databases.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of OHC (mouthrinse, swab, toothbrush or combination) in
critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours.

 Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. We
contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes. We reported
risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, using random-effects models unless
there were fewer than four studies.
Main results
We included 38 RCTs (6016 participants). There were four main comparisons: chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthrinse or gel versus placebo/
usual care; toothbrushing versus no toothbrushing; powered versus manual toothbrushing; and comparisons of oral care solutions. We
assessed the overall risk of bias as low in five trials (13%), high in 26 trials (68%), and unclear in seven trials (18%). We did not consider
the risk of bias to be serious when assessing the quality of evidence (GRADE) for VAP incidence, but we downgraded other outcomes
for risk of bias.
High quality evidence from 18 RCTs (2451 participants, 86% adults) shows that CHX mouthrinse or gel, as part of OHC, reduces
the risk of VAP compared to placebo or usual care from 25% to about 19% (RR 0.74, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.61 to 0.89,
P = 0.002, I2 = 31%). This is equivalent to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17 (95% CI
10 to 33), which indicates that for every 17 ventilated patients in intensive care receiving OHC including chlorhexidine, one outcome
of VAP would be prevented. There is no evidence of a difference between CHX and placebo/usual care for the outcomes of mortality
(RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.23, P = 0.20, I2 = 0%, 14 RCTs, 2014 participants, moderate quality evidence), duration of mechanical
ventilation (MD -0.09 days, 95% CI -1.73 to 1.55 days, P = 0.91, I2 = 36%, five RCTs, 800 participants, low quality evidence), or
duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (MD 0.21 days, 95% CI -1.48 to 1.89 days, P = 0.81, I2 = 9%, six RCTs, 833 participants,
moderate quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of CHX on duration of systemic antibiotics, oral
health indices, caregivers’ preferences or cost. Only two studies reported any adverse effects, and these were mild with similar frequency
in CHX and control groups.
We are uncertain as to the effects of toothbrushing (± antiseptics) on the outcomes of VAP (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09, P = 0.11, I
2 = 64%, five RCTs, 889 participants, very low quality evidence) and mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.09, P = 0.24, I2 = 0%, five
RCTs, 889 participants, low quality evidence) compared to OHC without toothbrushing (± antiseptics). There is insufficient evidence
to determine whether toothbrushing affects duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay, use of systemic antibiotics, oral
health indices, adverse effects, caregivers’ preferences or cost.
Only one trial (78 participants) compared use of a powered toothbrush with a manual toothbrush, providing insufficient evidence to
determine the effect on any of the outcomes of this review.
Fifteen trials compared various other oral care solutions. There is very weak evidence that povidone iodine mouthrinse is more effective
than saline/placebo (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95, P = 0.02, I2 = 74%, three studies, 356 participants, high risk of bias), and that
saline rinse is more effective than saline swab (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.62, P < 0.001, I2 = 84%, four studies, 488 participants, high
risk of bias) in reducing VAP
. Due to variation in comparisons and outcomes among trials, there is insufficient evidence concerning
the effects of other oral care solutions.
Authors’ conclusions
OHC including chlorhexidine mouthwash or gel reduces the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients
from 25% to about 19%. However, there is no evidence of a difference in the outcomes of mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation
or duration of ICU stay. There is no evidence that OHC including both antiseptics and toothbrushing is different from OHC with
antiseptics alone, and some weak evidence to suggest that povidone iodine mouthrinse is more effective than saline/placebo, and saline
rinse is more effective than saline swab in reducing VAP
. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether powered toothbrushing or
other oral care solutions are effective in reducing VAP
. There is also insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the interventions
evaluated in the studies are associated with adverse effects.

Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia
Review question

Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 What are the effects of oral hygiene care on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients receiving mechanical
ventilation in hospital intensive care units (ICUs)? We aimed to summarise all the available appropriate research in order to identify
evidence-based care for these vulnerable patients.
Background
Critically ill people, who may be unconscious or sedated while they are treated in ICUs, often need to have machines to help them
breathe (ventilators). The use of these machines for more than 48 hours may result in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is
a potentially serious complication in these patients who are already critically ill.
Oral hygiene care, using a mouthrinse, gel, toothbrush, or combination, together with suctioning secretions, may reduce the risk of
VAP in these patients.
Study characteristics
This review of studies was carried out through Cochrane Oral Health, and the evidence is current up to 17 December 2015.
We included 38 research studies but only a few (13%) of the studies were well conducted and described.
All of the studies took place in ICUs in hospitals. In total there were 6016 participants randomly allocated to treatment. Participants
were critically ill and required assistance from nursing staff for their oral hygiene care. Most of the studies involved adults only, but the
participants were children in three of the studies, and newborns in one study.
We grouped studies into four main comparisons.
1. Chlorhexidine antiseptic mouthrinse or gel compared to placebo (treatment without the active ingredient chlorhexidine) or usual
care, (with or without toothbrushing)
2. Toothbrushing compared with no toothbrushing (with or without antiseptics)
3. Powered compared with manual toothbrushing
4. Oral care solutions with other solutions
Key results
We found high quality evidence that chlorhexidine, either as a mouthrinse or a gel, reduces the risk of VAP from 25% to about 19%.
For every 17 people on ventilators for more than 48 hours in intensive care, the use of oral hygiene care including chlorhexidine will
prevent one person developing VAP
. However, we found no evidence that oral hygiene care with chlorhexidine makes a difference to
the numbers of patients who die in ICU, or to the number of days on mechanical ventilation or days in ICU.
We have only limited evidence on the effects of toothbrushing (with or without antiseptics) and oral care without toothbrushing (with
or without antiseptics) on the risk of developing VAP
. Three studies showed some weak evidence of a reduction in VAP with povidone
iodine antiseptic mouthrinse compared to placebo/saline. Four studies showed some weak evidence of a reduction in VAP with saline
rinse compared to saline swab.
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the interventions evaluated in the studies are associated with any unwanted
side effects.
Quality of the evidence
The evidence presented was limited by how well the included studies were done and reported. Only 13% of the studies were well
conducted and well described. For a number of outcomes, there was not enough information to draw a solid conclusion.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI)
CI: confidence interval; NNTB: number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome; RR: risk ratio
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate
1Assumed risk is based on the median event rate in the control groups of the included studies.
2Downgraded one level due to serious risk of bias: eight studies at high risk of bias, four at unclear risk of bias and three at
low risk of bias. The sensitivity analysis based on three low-risk-of-bias studies gave similar effect estimate (RR = 1.13), but
further research may change this estimate.
3Downgraded two levels due to serious imprecision and serious risk of bias: two studies at high risk of bias, three at low risk
of bias. The sensitivity analysis based on three studies at low risk of bias gave an effect estimate of 0.84 days, which is not
clinically important in the context of median duration of 12 days.

Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (Review)

 B A C K G R O U N D
Description of the condition
Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospital frequently re-
quire mechanical ventilation because their ability to breathe unas-
sisted is impaired due to trauma, or as a result of a medical con-
dition or recent surgery. These critically ill patients are also de-
pendent on hospital staff to meet their needs for nutrition and
hygiene, including oral hygiene.
Overall, the research suggests that oral health deteriorates follow-
ing admission to a critical care unit (Terezakis 2011). Intubation
and critical illness reduce oral immunity, may be associated with
mechanical injury of the mouth or respiratory tract, increase the
likelihood of dry mouth, and the presence of the endotracheal
tube may also make access for oral care more difficult (Alhazzani
2013; Labeau 2011). Dental plaque accumulates rapidly in the
mouths of critically ill patients and as the amount of plaque in-
creases, colonisation by microbial pathogens is likely (Fourrier
1998; Scannapieco 1992). Plaque colonisation may be exacerbated
in the absence of adequate oral hygiene care and by the drying of
the oral cavity due to prolonged mouth opening, which reduces
the buffering and cleansing effects of saliva. In addition, the pa-
tient’s normal defence mechanisms for resisting infection may be
impaired (Alhazzani 2013; Terpenning 2005). Dental plaque is
a complex biofilm which, once formed, is relatively resistant to
chemical control, requiring mechanical disruption (such as tooth-
brushing) for maximum impact (Marsh 2010).
One of the complications that may develop in ventilated patients is
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is generally defined
as a pneumonia developing in a patient who has received mechan-
ical ventilation for at least 48 hours (ATS Guideline 2005). It is
thought that the endotracheal tube, which delivers the necessary
oxygen to the patient, may also act as a conduit for pathogenic
bacteria, which multiply in the oral cavity and move down the tube
into the lungs. Micro-aspiration of pharyngeal secretions may also
occur around an imperfect seal of the cuff of the endotracheal tube
in a ventilated patient. Several studies have shown that micro-aspi-
ration contributes to the development of nosocomial pneumonia
(Azoulay 2006; Mojon 2002; Scannapieco 1992).
VAP is a relatively common nosocomial infection in critically ill
patients, with a reported prevalence ranging between 6% and 52%
(Apostolopoulou 2003; Edwards 2009), with some indications
that incidence is decreasing as understanding of the risk factors
and preventative measures improves. A recent study estimated the
attributable mortality of VAP to be 10% (Melsen 2011). Cohort
studies have found that duration of ICU stay is increased in pa-
tients who develop VAP
, but it is unclear whether this is cause or
effect (Apostolopoulou 2003; Cook 1998).
Antibiotics, administered either intra-orally as topical pastes or
systemically, have been used to prevent VAP
, and these interven-
tionsare evaluatedinotherCochrane systematicreviews(D’Amico
2009; Selim 2010). Topical antibiotic pastes have been shown to
be effective but are not widely used because of the risk of develop-
ing antibiotic-resistant organisms (Panchabhai 2009). However,
overuse of antibiotics is associated with the development of mul-
tidrug-resistant pathogens and therefore there is merit in using
other approaches for preventing infections such as VAP
.
Description of the intervention
This systematic review evaluates various types of oral hygiene care
as a means of reducing the incidence of VAP in critically ill patients
receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. Oral hygiene
care is promoted in clinical guidelines as a means of reducing the
incidence of VAP
, but the evidence base is limited (Tablan 2004).
Oral hygiene care includes the use of mouthrinses (water, saline,
antiseptics) applied either as sprays, liquids, or with a swab, with
or without toothbrushing (either manual or powered) and tooth-
paste, to remove plaque and debris from the oral cavity. Oral hy-
giene care also involves suction to remove excess fluid, toothpaste,
and debris, and may be followed by the application of an antisep-
tic gel. Antiseptics are broadly defined to include saline, chlorhex-
idine, povidone iodine, cetylpyridium, and possibly others, (but
exclude antibiotics).
How the intervention might work
Patients on mechanical ventilation often have a very dry mouth
due to prolonged mouth opening, which may be exacerbated by
the side effects of medications used in their treatment. In healthy
individuals, saliva functions to maintain oral health through its
lubricating, antibacterial, and buffering properties (Labeau 2011),
but patients on ventilators lack sufficient saliva for this to occur,
and the usual stimuli for saliva production are absent.
Routine oral hygiene care is designed to remove plaque and de-
bris, as well as replacing some of the functions of saliva, moist-
ening and rinsing the mouth. Toothbrushing, with either a man-
ual or powered toothbrush, removes plaque from teeth and gums
and disrupts the biofilm within which plaque bacteria multiply
(Whittaker 1996; Zanatta 2011). It is hypothesised that using an
antiseptic, such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine, as
either a rinse or a gel, may further reduce the bacterial load or
delay a subsequent increase in bacterial load.
However, it is important, that during oral hygiene care, the plaque
and debris are removed from the oral cavity with care in order to
avoid aspiration of contaminated fluids into the respiratory tract.
Raising the head of the bed, and careful use of appropriately-main-
tained closed suction systems, together with an appropriately-fit-
ted cuff around the endotracheal tube are other important aspects
of care of critically ill patients that are not part of this systematic
review.

 Why it is important to do this review
Cochrane Oral Health undertook an extensive prioritisation ex-
ercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles that were the
most clinically important reviews to maintain on the Cochrane
Library (Worthington 2015). The periodontal expert panel iden-
tified this review as a priority topic (Cochrane OHG priority
review portfolio).
Other Cochrane Reviews have evaluated the use of topical antibi-
otic pastes applied to the oral cavity (selective oral decontamina-
tion D’Amico 2009), probiotics (Hao 2015), and systemic an-
tibiotics (Selim 2010) to prevent VAP
. Other published reviews
have evaluated aspects of oral hygiene care, such as toothbrush-
ing (Alhazzani 2013) or use of chlorhexidine (Pineda 2006), and
broader reviews have noted the lack of available evidence (Berry
2007; Shi 2004). Clinical guidelines recommend the use of oral
hygiene care, but there is a lack of available evidence as a basis
for specifying the essential components of such care (Muscedere
2008; Tablan 2004). Hypersensitivity is a rare but potentially se-
vere side effect of chlorhexidine. In view of recent reports in the
UK of two cases of serious adverse events associated with irrigation
of dry socket with chlorhexidine mouthrinse (Pemberton 2012),
establishing the safety of oral hygiene care including chlorhexidine
is also important.
The goal of this Cochrane Review was to evaluate all oral hygiene
care interventions (excluding the use of antibiotics) used in ICU
for patients on ventilators for at least 48 hours, to determine the
effectsof oral hygiene care onthe developmentof VAP
. We planned
to summarise all the available research in order to facilitate the
provision of evidence-based care for these vulnerable patients.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oral hygiene care inter-
ventions. We did not consider quasi-randomised studies for inclu-
sion.
Types of participants
Critically ill patients in hospital settings receiving mechanical ven-
tilation for a minimum of 48 hours, without ventilator-associated
pneumonia or respiratory infection at baseline. We included tri-
als where only some of the participants were receiving mechanical
ventilation if the outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia was
reported, and data were available for those who had been treated
with mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 48 hours and then
developed nosocomial pneumonia.
We included trials where participants were undergoing a surgi-
cal procedure that involved mechanical ventilation (e.g. cardiac
surgery) only if the oral hygiene care was given during the period
of mechanical ventilation that had a minimum duration of 48
hours. We excluded trials where patients received a single preoper-
ative dose of antibacterial rinse or gargle, and received mechanical
ventilation only for the duration of the surgery, with no further
mechanical ventilation and oral hygiene care during the postop-
erative period.
Types of interventions
• Intervention group: received clearly-defined oral care
procedures such as nurse-assisted toothbrushing, oral and
pharyngeal cavity rinse, decontamination of oropharyngeal
cavities with antiseptics;
• Control group: received no treatment, placebo, ’usual care’,
or a different specific oral hygiene care procedure.
We excluded trials where the intervention being evaluated was a
type of suction system or variation of method, timing, or place
where mechanical ventilation was introduced (e.g. emergency
room or ICU).
We excluded trials of selective decontamination using topical
antibiotics administered to the oral cavity or oropharynx, be-
cause these interventions are covered in another Cochrane Review
(D’Amico 2009). We also excluded trials of probiotics adminis-
tered to prevent respiratory infections, as these are covered in a
separate review (Hao 2015).
Types of outcome measures
We included studies that aimed to assess at least one of our primary
outcomes.
Primary outcomes
1. Incidence of VAP (defined as pneumonia developing in a
patient who has received mechanical ventilation for at least 48
hours)
2. Mortality (either ICU mortality if these data were available,
or 30-day mortality)

 Secondary outcomes
1. Duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay, or both
2. Systemic antibiotic use
3. Oral health indices such as gingival index, plaque index,
bleeding index, periodontal index, etc.
4. Adverse effects of the interventions
5. Caregivers’ preferences for oral hygiene care
6. Economic data
Search methods for identification of studies
To identify studies for this review, we developed detailed search
strategies for each database searched. These were based on the
search strategy developed for MEDLINE Ovid but revised appro-
priately for each database. The search strategy used a combination
of controlled vocabulary and free-text terms. The Embase subject
search was linked to Cochrane Oral Health’s filter for identifying
clinical trials in EMBASE Ovid.
Electronic searches
We searched the following electronic databases.
• Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (searched 17
December 2015) (Appendix 1);
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched
17 December 2015) (Appendix 2);
• Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 17 December 2015) (Appendix
3);
• Ovid Embase (1980 to 17 December 2015) (Appendix 4);
• CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 17 December 2015) (Appendix
5);
• LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American
and Caribbean Health Science Information database; from 1982
to 17 December 2015) (Appendix 6);
• Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (1978 to 14
January 2013) (Appendix 7);
• China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1994 to 14
January 2013) (Appendix 8);
• Wan Fang Database (1984 to 14 January 2013) (Appendix
9);
• VIP Database (January 2012 to 4 May 2016) (Appendix
10).
We included all relevant publications irrespective of language. For
this update, we did not conduct searches of the Chinese Biomed-
ical Literature Database, the China National Knowledge Infras-
tructure or the Wan Fang Database. We found these databases to
be adequately covered by searches of the VIP Database.
Searching other resources
We searched the following trials registries for ongoing studies:
• US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register
ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov; searched 17 December
2015) (see Appendix 11);
• World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch; searched 17
December 2015) (see Appendix 12).
We manually checked all the references lists of the included studies
to identify any additional studies.
We contacted the first or corresponding authors of the included
studies, other experts in the field, and manufacturers of oral hy-
giene products to request unpublished relevant information.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
At least two of six review authors independently examined each
title andabstractof articlesobtainedfromthe searches.We resolved
disagreements by discussion. We linked multiple reports from a
study, and designated the report with the most complete follow-
up data as the primary source of data.
We obtained copies of potentially relevant reports and examined
them in detail to determine whether the study fulfilled the eligibil-
ity criteria. We resolved any queries by discussion. We attempted
to contact study authors to obtain additional information as nec-
essary. We excluded studies when the only information available
was from the abstract and this was insufficient to enable full as-
sessment of risk of bias.
Data extraction and management
At least two of six review authors independently extracted data
from each included study onto predesigned structured data ex-
traction forms. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We
extracted the following items:
• General characteristics of the study: authors, year of
publication, country where the study was performed, funding,
language of publication, study duration, citation, contact details
for the authors and identifier.
• Specific trial characteristics: we collected basic study design
characteristics: sequence generation, allocation sequence
concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective
outcome reporting, etc., and presented them in the table of
’Characteristics of included studies. We included verbatim
quotes on the first three issues from original reports.
• Participants: total number, setting, age, sex, country,
ethnicity, socio-demographic details (e.g. education level),
diagnostic criteria for VAP and the presence of comorbid
conditions.

 • Interventions: we collected details of all experimental and
control interventions, such as dosages for drugs used and routes
of delivery, format for oral hygiene care, timing and duration of
the oral care procedures. We also collected information on any
co-interventions administered.
• Outcomes: we collected the incidence of VAP or other
respiratory diseases and mortality (directly and indirectly
attributable), duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of
ICU stay, systemic antibiotic use, oral health indices, and adverse
outcomes resulting from the interventions, etc. We specified all
outcome variables in terms of definition, timing, units and scales.
• Other results: we also collected summary statistics, sample
size, key conclusions, comments and any explanations provided
for unexpected findings by the study authors. We contacted the
lead authors of included studies if there were issues to be clarified.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
At least two of six review authors assessed the risk of bias of each
included study, using the Cochrane domain-based, two-part tool
as described in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We contacted study au-
thors for clarification or missing information where necessary. We
resolved any disagreements concerning risk of bias by discussion.
We completed a ’Risk of bias’ table for each included study. For
each domain of risk of bias, we described what was reported to
have happened in the study in order to provide a rationale for the
second part, which involved assigning a judgement of ’low risk’ of
bias, ’high risk’ of bias, or ’unclear risk’ of bias.
For each included study, we assessed the following seven domains
of risk of bias.
• Random sequence generation (selection bias): use of simple
randomisation (e.g. random-number table, computer-generated
randomisation, central randomisation by a specialised unit),
restricted randomisation (e.g. random permuted blocks),
stratified randomisation and minimisation were assessed as low
risk of bias. Other forms of simple randomisation such as
repeated coin-tossing, throwing dice or dealing cards were also
considered as low risk of bias (Schulz 2002). Where a study
report used the phrase ’randomised’ or ’random allocation’ but
with no further information, we assessed it as unclear for this
domain.
• Allocation concealment (selection bias): use of centralised/
remote allocation, pharmacy-controlled randomisation and
sequentially-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes were assessed as
low risk of bias. If a study report did not mention allocation
concealment, we assessed it as unclear for this domain.
• Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias):
participants in included studies were in intensive care and on
mechanical ventilation and were therefore unlikely to be aware of
the treatment group to which they were assigned. We therefore
assessed caregiver and outcome assessor blinding. Where no
placebo was used, caregivers would be aware of the assigned
intervention and this would introduce a risk of performance bias.
If a study was described as double-blind and a placebo was used,
we assumed that caregivers and outcome assessors were blinded
to the allocated treatment. If blinding was not mentioned and no
placebo was used, we assumed that no blinding of caregivers
occurred and we assessed this domain as being at high risk of bias.
• Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias): if
outcome assessor blinding was not mentioned in the trial report,
we assessed this domain as being at unclear risk of bias.
• Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): where the overall
rate of attrition was high, we assessed the risk of attrition bias as
high. If numbers of participants and/or reasons for exclusion
were different in each arm of the study, we assessed the risk of
attrition bias as high. If numbers of participants randomised or
evaluated in each arm of the study were not reported, we assessed
this domain as unclear.
• Selective reporting (reporting bias): if the study did not
report outcomes stated in the Methods section, or reported
outcomes without estimates of variance, we assessed this as being
at high risk of reporting bias.
• Other bias: any other potential source of bias that might
feasibly alter the magnitude of the effect estimate, e.g. baseline
imbalance between study arms in important prognostic factors
(e.g. clinical pulmonary infection scores (CPIS), antibiotic
exposure), early stopping of the trial, or co-interventions or
differences in other treatment between study arms. We described
any other potential sources of bias and assessed their risk of bias.
We summarised the risks of bias as follows.

 (Continued)
High risk of bias
Plausible bias that seriously weak-
ens confidence in the results
High risk of bias for one or more
key domains
The proportion of information
from studies at high risk of bias is
sufficient to affect the interpreta-
tion of results
We present the ’Risk of bias’ graphically by: (a) proportion of
studies with each judgement (low, high, or ’unclear risk of bias)
for each domain, and (b) cross-tabulation of judgements by study
and by domain.
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous outcomes, we computed the effect measure as
the risk ratio (RR) together with the 95% confidence interval (CI).
For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) with
95% CI to estimate the summary effect. If different scales were
used, we calculated standardised mean differences.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the participant. The indices of plaque
and gingivitis were measured as mean values for the participants.
Episodes of care were also related back to individual participants.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted the lead author of studies requesting that they sup-
ply any missing data. We planned to obtain missing standard de-
viations using the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Assessment of heterogeneity
To detect heterogeneity among studies in a meta-analysis, we ap-
plied a Chi2 test with a 0.10 level of significance as the cut-off
value. We quantified the impact of statistical heterogeneity using
the I2 statistic. To interpret the results, we used the thresholds of I
2 recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011):
• 0% to 40%: might not be important;
• 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;
• 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;
• 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.
If considerable heterogeneity existed, we investigated it, using sub-
group analyses to investigate possible differences between the stud-
ies.
Assessment of reporting biases
Only a proportion of research projects conducted are ultimately
published in an indexed journal and become easily identifiable
for inclusion in systematic reviews. Reporting biases arise when
the reporting of research findings is influenced by the nature and
direction of the findings of the research. We investigated and at-
tempted to minimise potential reporting biases in this review, in-
cluding publication bias, time lag bias, multiple (duplicate) pub-
lication bias, and language bias.
Where there were more than 10 studies in an outcome, we con-
structed a funnel plot. We planned to investigate the asymmetry
in the funnel plot (indicating possible publication bias) by under-
taking statistical analysis using the methods introduced by Egger
1997 (continuous outcome) and Rücker 2008 (dichotomous out-
come) (such analysis would have been done in Stata).
Data synthesis
We undertook meta-analyses for similar comparisons and the same
outcomes across studies. We used random-effects models provid-
ing there were four or more trials in any one meta-analysis.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We proposed one subgroup analysis a priori. We decided to under-
take a subgroup analysis according to whether participants’ teeth
were cleaned or not, as we hypothesised that antiseptics would
be less effective if toothbrushing was not used to disrupt dental
plaque biofilm.
Sensitivity analysis
To determine whether the intervention effects of oral hygiene care
were robust, we planned sensitivity analyses to assess the effect
on the estimates of effect of studies with questionable diagnostic
criteria for VAP
, studies with high risk of bias, or by changing our
assumptions about missing data.
If the results had not changed substantially in sensitivity analyses,
we would have regarded our conclusions as stable with a higher
degree of certainty. If sensitivity analyses had identified particular
factors that greatly influenced the conclusions of the review, we
10

 would have explored the plausible causes of the uncertainties and
interpreted the results with more caution.
Summary of findings
We adopted the GRADE system for evaluating quality of the ev-
idence of systematic reviews (Guyatt 2008; Higgins 2011), using
the software GRADEprofiler. We includedthe followingoutcomes
in the ’Summary of findings’ tables: incidence of VAP
, mortality,
duration of ventilation, duration of ICU stay, and adverse effects.
We assessed the quality of the body of evidence with reference to
the overall risk of bias of the included studies, the directness of
the evidence, the consistency of the results, the precision of the
estimates, and the risk of publication bias. We classified the quality
of the body of evidence into four categories: high, moderate, low
and very low.

Results of the search
For this review update, after removal of duplicates, we identified
317 records from electronic databases and other resources. At least
two review authors screened all records against the review inclusion
criteria. We discarded 253 records and requested full-text copies of
64 references. At least two review authors assessed these papers to
determine their eligibility, and from these, we deemed 38 studies
eligible for inclusion.
Three previously included studies (Grap 2004; McCartt 2010;
Needleman 2011) have been excluded from this update (see
Characteristics of excluded studies for details).Two studies are
awaiting classification because we have not yet obtained adequate
information about them. The study flow diagram is shown in

 Included studies
We included 38 RCTs in this review.
Setting
Eight of the included studies were conducted in the USA (Bopp
2006; DeRiso 1996; Fields 2008; Grap 2011; Munro 2009;
Prendergast 2012; Scannapieco 2009; Stefanescu 2013), nine
in China (Chen 2008; Feng 2012; Hu 2009; Long 2012; Mo
2016; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008; Zhao 2012), five in
Brazil (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Caruso 2009; Jacomo 2011;
Kusahara 2012a; Meinberg 2012), four in France (Fourrier 2000;
Fourrier 2005; Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014) and three in Spain
(Lorente 2012; Pobo 2009; Roca Biosca 2011), two in India
(Panchabhai 2009; Sebastian 2012), two in Australia (Berry 2011;
Berry 2013), and one each in Croatia (Cabov 2010), Taiwan (Yao
2011), Thailand (Tantipong 2008), Turkey (Ozcaka 2012), the
Netherlands (Koeman 2006).
All studies took place in ICUs in hospitals. Most of the studies
were two-arm parallel group RCTs, but five studies had three arms
(Berry 2011; Berry 2013; Scannapieco 2009; Seguin 2006; Xu
2007), and one study had four arms (Munro 2009).
Participants
There were 6016 participants randomly allocated to treatment in
37 RCTs, and the other trial (Fields 2008) did not state how many
participants were included. The criteria for inclusion in these stud-
ies generally specified no prior intubation, no clinically-apparent
pneumonia at baseline (other than Sebastian 2012, where most of
the children admitted to ICU had pneumonia already and criteria
of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were strictly applied to
diagnose subsequent VAP), and an expected requirement for me-
chanical ventilation for a minimum of 48 hours. Participants were
critically ill and required assistance from nursing staff for their oral
hygiene care. In three of the included studies, participants were
children (Jacomo 2011; Kusahara 2012a; Sebastian 2012); in one
study, participants were neonates (Stefanescu 2013); and in the
remaining studies, only adults participated.
In six studies, participants were either medical or surgical pa-
tients (Berry 2013; Koeman 2006; Meinberg 2012; Mo 2016;
Munro 2009; Panchabhai 2009); in another five studies, partici-
pants were described as trauma patients (Grap 2011; Prendergast
2012; Scannapieco 2009; Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014); six studies
recruitedsurgical patientsonly(Chen 2008; DeRiso 1996; Jacomo
2011; Kusahara 2012a; Yao 2011; Zhao 2012); nine studies re-
cruited medical patients only (Cabov 2010; Fields 2008; Fourrier
2000; Fourrier 2005; Ozcaka 2012; Sebastian 2012; Stefanescu
2013; Tang 2013; Tantipong 2008); and in the remaining 12 stud-
ies, it was not clearly stated whether participants were medical,
surgical, or trauma cases.
Nine of the included studies (Fields 2008; Fourrier 2000; Grap
2011; Lorente 2012; Munro 2009; Ozcaka 2012; Pobo 2009;
Prendergast 2012; Roca Biosca 2011)specificallyexcludededentu-
lousparticipants, andthe remainingstudiesdidnot reportwhether
or not participants were dentate.
Classification of the interventions
We classified the interventions into three broad groups.
• Chlorhexidine
•
◦ Chlorhexidine solution (applied as mouthrinse, spray
or on a swab)
◦ Chlorhexidine gel
• Toothbrushing
◦ Powered
◦ Manual
• Other solutions
◦ Povidone iodine
◦ Saline
◦ Bicarbonate
◦ Triclosan
◦ Furacilin
◦ Listerine
◦ Biotene OralBalance
These interventions were used either singly or in combinations.
We evaluated the following comparisons.
1. Chlorhexidine versus placebo/usual care, with or without
toothbrushing (19 studies: Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Berry
2011; Bopp 2006; Cabov 2010; Chen 2008; DeRiso 1996;
Fourrier 2000; Fourrier 2005; Grap 2011; Jacomo 2011;
Koeman 2006; Kusahara 2012a; Meinberg 2012; Munro 2009;
Ozcaka 2012; Panchabhai 2009; Scannapieco 2009; Sebastian
2012; Tantipong 2008)
2. Toothbrushing versus no toothbrushing (in addition to
usual care) (eight studies: Bopp 2006; Fields 2008; Lorente
2012; Long 2012; Munro 2009; Pobo 2009; Roca Biosca 2011;
Yao 2011)
3. Powered toothbrushing versus manual toothbrushing (one
study: Prendergast 2012)
4. Other solutions (15 studies)
i) Saline (Caruso 2009; Hu 2009; Mo 2016; Seguin
2006; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008)
ii) Bicarbonate (Berry 2011; Berry 2013)
iii) Povidone iodine (Feng 2012; Seguin 2006; Seguin
2014)

 iv) Triclosan (Zhao 2012)
v) Furacilin (Feng 2012)
vi) Listerine (Berry 2013)
vii) Biotene OralBalance (Stefanescu 2013)
There was some variation between the studies in the number
of episodes of OHC per day, with most of the studies (79%)
delivering two to four episodes of care daily. Thirteen studies
(Berry 2011; Bopp 2006; DeRiso 1996; Fields 2008; Hu 2009;
Jacomo 2011; Kusahara 2012a; Panchabhai 2009; Prendergast
2012; Scannapieco 2009; Xu 2007; Xu 2008; Yao 2011) delivered
two episodes of OHC a day, nine studies (Bellissimo-Rodrigues
2009; Cabov 2010; Fourrier 2000; Fourrier 2005; Long 2012;
Lorente 2012; Munro 2009; Pobo 2009; Sebastian 2012)hadthree
episodes a day, and eight studies (Chen 2008; Feng 2012; Koeman
2006; Meinberg 2012; Mo 2016; Ozcaka 2012; Tantipong 2008;
Zhao 2012) had four episodes a day. One study delivered OHC
every two hours (Berry 2013), another only once (Grap 2011),
and in the remaining three studies it is unclear (Caruso 2009; Roca
Biosca 2011; Tang 2013).
In some of the included studies, the intervention described as
’placebo’ may have had some antibacterial activity, but this was
considered by the trialists to be negligible compared to the active
intervention. Placebo interventions included saline (Chen 2008;
Feng 2012; Hu 2009; Ozcaka 2012; Seguin 2006; Tantipong
2008), potassium permanganate (Panchabhai 2009), half-strength
hydrogen peroxide (Bopp 2006), water/alcohol mixture (DeRiso
1996; Jacomo 2011), placebo gel (Fourrier 2005; Koeman 2006;
Kusahara 2012a; Meinberg 2012; Sebastian 2012), base solution (
Scannapieco 2009) or water (Berry2011; Berry2013). In one trial,
the nature of the placebo was not specified (Bellissimo-Rodrigues
2009).
In eight studies, the control group received usual/standard care
(Caruso 2009; Fields 2008; Fourrier 2000; Hu 2009; Grap 2011;
Munro 2009; Seguin 2006; Yao 2011) (for specific details see
Characteristics of included studies), and in three studies, there
was a head-to-head comparison between two potentially active
interventions (Pobo 2009; Prendergast 2012; Roca Biosca 2011).
Measures of primary outcomes
Incidence of VAP
The primary outcome of our review is ventilator-associated pneu-
monia (VAP), defined as pneumonia developing in a person who
has been on mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. VAP was
fully reported by 34 of the included studies (Bellissimo-Rodrigues
2009; Berry 2011; Berry 2013; Bopp 2006; Cabov 2010; Caruso
2009; Chen 2008; DeRiso 1996; Feng 2012; Fourrier 2005;
Grap 2011; Hu 2009; Jacomo 2011; Koeman 2006; Kusahara
2012a; Long 2012; Lorente 2012; Meinberg 2012; Mo 2016;
Ozcaka 2012; Panchabhai 2009; Pobo 2009; Prendergast 2012;
Scannapieco 2009; Sebastian 2012; Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014;
Stefanescu 2013; Tang 2013; Tantipong 2008; Xu 2007; Xu 2008;
Yao 2011; Zhao 2012). One study reported only that there was no
difference in VAP between the two arms of the study (Roca Biosca
2011). One study reported that the VAP rate dropped to zero in
the intervention group but the control group event rate was not
reported (Fields 2008). Two studies reported the outcome of noso-
comial pneumonia, but it was not clear in the trial reports whether
all those who developed this outcome had been on mechanical
ventilation for at least 48 hours (Fourrier 2000; Hu 2009). We
sought clarification from the trial authors but have so far received
no further data.
Diagnostic criteria for the outcome of ventilator-associated pneu-
monia were specified in 33 studies. Seventeen studies used Pu-
gin’s criteria (Cook 1998; Pugin 1991), which form the basis of
the CPIS score, based on the presence of an infiltrate on chest ra-
diograph, plus two or more of the following: temperature greater
than 38.5º C or less than 35º C, white blood cell count greater
than 11,000/mm3 or less than 4000/mm3, mucopurulent or pu-
rulent bronchial secretions, or more than 20% increase in fraction
of inspired oxygen required to maintain saturation above 92%
(Berry 2011; Berry 2013; Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; Fourrier
2000; Fourrier 2005; Grap 2011; Koeman 2006; Kusahara 2012a;
Meinberg 2012; Munro 2009; Pobo 2009; Scannapieco 2009;
Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014; Tantipong 2008; Yao 2011). InOzcaka
2012, no specific criteria were reported, but communication with
the author confirmed that participants with new pulmonary in-
filtrates or opacities on the chest X-ray were prediagnosed VAP
and lower tracheal mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL) sam-
ples were taken and then participants were diagnosed according to
CPIS criteria. Those who had a score of six or more and the pres-
ence of 104 or more colony-forming units/mL of a target potential
respiratory bacterial pathogen (PRP) in mini-BAL were diagnosed
with VAP
.
A further six studies used the CDC criteria as described in Horan
2008 (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; DeRiso 1996; Fields 2008;
Jacomo 2011; Panchabhai 2009; Sebastian 2012). Stefanescu2013
used CDC criteria for diagnosis of neonatal VAP
.
Six studies used the criteria of the Chinese Society of Respiratory
Diseases: presence of new infiltrates on chest radiographs devel-
oped after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation with any two of the
following items: (a) temperature greater than 38º C, (b) change in
characteristics of bronchial secretions from mucoid to mucopuru-
lent or purulent, (c) white cell count greater than 10,000/mm3,
(d) positive culture of tracheal aspirate or positive culture of bron-
choalveolar lavage fluid or both, or (e) arterial oxygen tension/
inspiratory fraction of oxygen PaO2/FiO2 decreased over 30%
within the period of ventilation (Chen 2008; Feng 2012; Mo
2016; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008).
Hu 2009 reported the outcome of VAP based on clinical exami-
nation plus three criteria: chest radiograph, white cell count and
culture of the aspirate from lower respiratory tract (but no precise
14

 parameters were specified). In Lorente 2012, the diagnosis of VAP
was made by an expert panel blinded to the allocated intervention,
but the diagnostic criteria were not specified. Prendergast 2012
had a single diagnostic criterion of a new or worsening pulmonary
infiltrate on chest radiograph. Two studies used positive culture
from the lower respiratory tract as criteria for diagnosis of VAP
(Long 2012; Zhao 2012).
The remaining two studies with the outcome of VAP did not
report their diagnostic criteria (Bopp 2006; Roca Biosca 2011).
Mortality
Twenty-four studies reported the outcome of mortality, either as
ICU mortality or 30-day mortality (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009;
Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; Fourrier 2000; Fourrier 2005; Jacomo
2011; Kusahara 2012a; Long 2012; Lorente 2012; Meinberg
2012; Mo 2016; Munro 2009; Ozcaka 2012; Panchabhai 2009;
Pobo 2009; Prendergast 2012; Scannapieco 2009; Sebastian
2012; Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014; Stefanescu 2013; Tang 2013;
Tantipong 2008; Yao 2011). Where ICU mortality was reported,
we used these data; where ICU mortality was not reported, we
used 30-day mortality.
Measures of secondary outcomes
Duration of ventilation
Sixteen studies reported this outcome (Bellissimo-Rodrigues
2009; Caruso 2009; Fourrier 2000; Fourrier 2005; Hu 2009;
Koeman 2006; Long 2012; Lorente 2012; Ozcaka 2012; Pobo
2009; Prendergast 2012; Scannapieco 2009; Seguin 2006; Tang
2013; Xu 2008; Zhao 2012). Berry 2013, Jacomo 2011, Meinberg
2012 and Sebastian 2012 reported the median duration of ven-
tilation or the range for each group or both, but we could not
combine these data in a meta-analysis. Unless explicitly reported
otherwise, we have assumed that all studies used similar methods
to calculate these data including participants who died. Stefanescu
2013 only reported a P value for the difference between groups in
duration of ventilation.
Duration of ICU stay
There were 15 studies reporting this outcome (Bellissimo-
Rodrigues 2009; Bopp 2006; Caruso 2009; Fourrier 2000;
Fourrier 2005; Koeman 2006; Kusahara 2012a; Lorente 2012;
Ozcaka 2012; Panchabhai 2009; Pobo 2009; Prendergast 2012;
Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014; Zhao 2012). Berry 2013, Jacomo
2011, Meinberg 2012, and Sebastian 2012 reported the median
ICU stay and the range for each group, but we could not combine
these data in a meta-analysis. Unless explicitly reported otherwise,
we have assumed that all studies used similar methods to calculate
these data including participants who died.
Systemic antibiotic therapy
There were five studies that reported some measure of systemic
antibiotic use. DeRiso 1996 reported the number of participants
in each group who required treatment of an infection with sys-
temic antibiotics during their ICU stay; Seguin 2014 reported
the number of participants who were treated with antibiotics; and
Fourrier 2005 and Scannapieco 2009 both reported the mean
number of days of systemic antibiotic use in the intervention and
control groups. Berry 2013 only reported a P value for the differ-
ence among groups in antibiotic administration.
Oral health indices
Plaque indices were mentioned as outcomes in four studies
(Ozcaka 2012; Roca Biosca 2011; Scannapieco 2009; Yao 2011).
Complete data for plaque indices were reported in one study
(Ozcaka 2012), and were supplied by the corresponding author of
another study (Yao 2011). Scannapieco 2009 reported this out-
come in graphs only, and Roca Biosca 2011 did not report any
estimate of variance, so we could not use these data in this review.
Adverse effects
Only two of the included studies reported adverse effects of the in-
terventions (Seguin 2014; Tantipong 2008); five studies reported
that there were no adverse effects (Berry 2011; Berry 2013; Jacomo
2011; Ozcaka 2012; Sebastian 2012), and Stefanescu 2013 re-
ported no significant difference between groups with respect to
adverse events in buccal mucosa. The remaining studies did not
mention adverse effects in their reports.
Excluded studies
In this update, we excluded 24 studies for the reasons summarised
below. Three studies that we included in the previous version of
the review are excluded from this version (Grap 2004; McCartt
2010; Needleman 2011).
• Twelve studies were excluded because they were not RCTs
(Buckley 2013; Darnell 2015; Gu 2013; Labeau 2013; Liao
2015; Maury 2015; Pelucchi 2013; Sands 2015; Seo 2011;
Swartz 2015; Tattevin 2015; Yun 2011).
• Five studies were excluded because they did not attempt to
assess the incidence of VAP or mortality (Baradari 2012; Grap
2004; Kusahara 2012b; McCartt 2010; Needleman 2011).
• Four studies were reported as abstracts only and our
attempts to find a full publication or obtain sufficient data to
enable inclusion in this review were unsuccessful (Anon 2012;
Jafari 2007; MacNaughton 2004; Pivkina 2014).
• Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2014 was excluded because the
intervention was dental care (e.g. treatment of caries, tooth
extraction), not oral hygiene care.
• Munro 2015 was excluded because the intervention was
oral hygiene care prior to, not during, mechanical ventilation.

 • Fan 2015 was excluded because the CHX solution used for
interventions contained antibiotics.

table, which also provides information on studies excluded in the
last version of this review.
Risk of bias in included studies
Allocation
Sequence generation
Twenty-eight of the included studies clearly described a random
method of sequence generation and we assessed them at low risk
of bias for this domain. The remaining 10 studies stated that allo-
cation was random but provided no further details and we there-
fore assessed them at unclear risk of bias for this domain (Caruso
2009; Feng 2012; Fields 2008; Long 2012; Panchabhai 2009;
Roca Biosca 2011; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008; Zhao 2012).
Allocation concealment
Allocation concealment was clearlydescribed in 19 of the included
studies and we assessed them at low risk of bias for this domain.
In 18 studies, allocation concealment was not described in suffi-
cient detail to determine risk of bias and we rated these studies
at unclear risk of bias (Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; Chen 2008;
Feng 2012; Fourrier 2000; Grap 2011; Long 2012; Lorente 2012;
Mo 2016; Munro 2009; Panchabhai 2009; Sebastian 2012; Tang
2013; Tantipong 2008; Xu 2007; Xu2008; Yao2011; Zhao2012).
We assessed Bopp 2006 at high risk of bias because the allocation
was not concealed from the researchers.
The risk of selection bias based on combined assessment of these
two domains was high in one study (Bopp 2006), unclear in 20
studies (Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; Chen 2008; Feng 2012; Fields
2008; Fourrier 2000; Grap 2011; Long 2012; Lorente 2012;
Mo 2016; Munro 2009; Panchabhai 2009; Roca Biosca 2011;
Sebastian 2012; Tang 2013; Tantipong 2008; Xu 2007; Xu 2008;
Yao 2011; Zhao 2012), and low in the remaining 17 studies.
Blinding
Twelve studieswere describedasdouble blindandwe assessedthem
atlowriskof performance bias(Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Cabov
2010; DeRiso 1996; Fourrier 2005; Jacomo 2011; Koeman 2006;
Kusahara 2012a; Meinberg 2012; Ozcaka 2012; Scannapieco
2009; Sebastian 2012; Seguin 2014). There was insufficient in-
formation to determine whether blinding occurred in two studies
(Caruso 2009; Zhao 2012). In the remaining 24 studies, blinding
of the participants and their caregivers to the allocated treatment
was not possible because the active and control treatments were so
different, and no placebos were used. We assessed these studies at
high risk of performance bias.
Blinding of outcome assessment was possible in all of the included
studies and was described in 22 studies (Bellissimo-Rodrigues
2009; Berry2011; Berry2013; Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; DeRiso
1996; Fourrier 2000; Fourrier 2005; Hu 2009; Jacomo 2011;
Kusahara 2012a; Lorente 2012; Meinberg 2012; Ozcaka 2012;
Panchabhai 2009; Pobo 2009; Prendergast 2012; Scannapieco
2009; Sebastian 2012 ; Seguin 2014; Tantipong 2008; Yao 2011),
which we assessed as being at low risk of detection bias. One of the
included studies reported no blinding of outcome assessment and
we assessed it at high risk of detection bias (Bopp 2006). In the
remaining 15 studies, there was insufficient information provided
and we rated the risk of detection bias as unclear.
Incomplete outcome data
In the studies included in this review loss of participants during
the course of the study is to be expected, as these critically ill
people leave the intensive care unit either because they recover
and no longer require mechanical ventilation, or because they die
from their illness. In 25 of the included studies, either all the
randomised participants were included in the outcome, or the
number of losses/withdrawals and the reasons given were similar
in both arms of the study, and we assessed these studies at low
risk of attrition bias (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Bopp 2006;
Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; Chen 2008; Feng 2012; Fourrier
2005; Jacomo 2011; Koeman 2006; Kusahara 2012a; Long 2012;
Lorente 2012; Meinberg 2012; Mo 2016; Ozcaka 2012; Pobo
2009; Sebastian 2012 ; Seguin 2006; Seguin 2014, Stefanescu
2013; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008; Yao 2011; Zhao 2012).
We rated nine of the included studies at high risk of attrition
bias, because the numbers and reasons for withdrawal/exclusion
were different in each arm of the study, or because the number of
participants withdrawn or excluded from the outcomes evaluation
was high and insufficient information was provided (Berry 2011;
Berry 2013; Fields 2008; Grap 2011; Hu 2009; Munro 2009;
Prendergast 2012; Roca Biosca 2011; Scannapieco 2009). In the
remaining four studies there was insufficient information available
to determine the risk of attrition bias.
Selective reporting
Twenty-six of the included studies reported the outcomes spec-
ified in their Methods section in full, or this information was
supplied by trial authors, and we assessed these studies at low
risk of reporting bias (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Berry 2011;
Cabov 2010; Caruso 2009; DeRiso 1996; Feng 2012; Fourrier
2000; Fourrier 2005; Koeman 2006; Kusahara 2012a; Long 2012;
Lorente 2012; Mo 2016; Ozcaka 2012; Panchabhai 2009; Pobo
2009; Prendergast 2012; Sebastian 2012; Seguin 2006; Seguin

Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (Review)

 2014; Stefanescu 2013; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008; Yao 2011;
Zhao 2012).
Three studies did not report all the outcomes specified in their
Methods sections (Grap 2011; Meinberg 2012; Roca Biosca
2011), two studies reported outcomes as percentages only, with
unclear denominators for each arm (Berry 2013; Hu 2009), and
one study did not report the number of participants evaluated
(Fields 2008). We rated these six trials at high risk of reporting
bias.
We assessed the remaining six trials at unclear risk of reporting
bias, because there was insufficient information reported to make a
clear judgement (Bopp 2006; Chen 2008; Koeman 2006; Munro
2009; Scannapieco 2009; Tantipong 2008).
Other potential sources of bias
We rated five studies at high risk of other bias. Three studies were
stopped early (Berry 2011; Meinberg 2012; Pobo 2009). Berry
2011 was stopped due to withdrawal of one of the investigational
products by a regulatory authority; Pobo 2009 was stopped after
37% of the planned 400 participants had been recruited because
there appeared to be no difference between the study arms in the
outcome of VAP
. Meinberg 2012 was stopped due to “futility”;
however we are unsure whether this was the main problem. Grap
2011 did not report baseline data for each randomised treatment
group but the trial report noted that there was a “statistically sig-
nificant difference in gender and CPIS score between groups at
baseline”, and we considered that this difference was likely to have
biased the results. In Scannapieco 2009 the imputations used for
the missing data were unclear and the pre-study exposure to sys-
temic antibiotics was greater in the control group, so we assessed
this study at high risk of other bias.
In 12 studies, we rated the risk of other bias as unclear (Berry 2013;
Chen 2008; Fields 2008; Kusahara 2012a; Long 2012; Panchabhai
2009; Roca Biosca 2011; Stefanescu 2013; Tang 2013; Tantipong
2008; Yao 2011; Zhao 2012). The reasons for this are as follows:
• In Berry 2013 ineligible participants were included in the
ITT analysis, but reasons for ineligibility in each group were not
given;
• The participants in the treatment group in Chen 2008
received a co-intervention that was not given to the control
group;
• In both Fields 2008 and Roca Biosca 2011 the study
reports contained insufficient information for us to be confident
that study methodology was robust;
• In Stefanescu 2013 more infants in the control group
received a complete course of antenatal steroids compared to
infants in the Biotene OralBalance group (P = 0.045). A
complete course of antenatal steroids improves antenatal lung
maturity and function and may reduce the risk of VAP
. This
imbalance is likely to lead to an underestimate of the benefit of
the active treatment;
• In Kusahara 2012a there was a statistically significant
difference in the age of the children in each arm of the study and
we are unclear whether this is associated with potential bias;
• Panchabhai 2009 reported baseline characteristics only for
those participants completing the study;
• In Tang 2013, a detailed description about the intervention
methods and frequency of oral care in each group was not
reported.
• Tantipong 2008 included participants treated in different
units of the hospital where care and co-interventions are likely to
have been different;
• In Yao 2011 there is no information as to how the
edentulous participants in each arm were treated;
• Long 2012 and Zhao 2012 reported the criteria for VAP
diagnosis as being positive culture of lower respiratory tract
secretions, with no other criteria, and it is unclear if this would
have introduced a bias in these unblinded studies.
We assessed the remaining 21 studies at low risk of other bias.
Overall risk of bias
Overall, we rated just five of the included studies (13%) at low risk
of bias for all domains (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Fourrier 2005;
Koeman 2006; Ozcaka 2012; Seguin 2014), and seven studies
(18%) were at unclear risk of bias for at least one domain. Over
two-thirds of the included studies (26 studies, 68%) were at high
risk of bias in at least one domain (see Figure 2; Figure 3).

Summary of findings 2 Toothbrushing (± antiseptics) versus no
toothbrushing (± antiseptics) for critically ill patients to prevent
ventilator-associated pneumonia
Comparison 1: Chlorhexidine versus placebo/usual
care (with or without toothbrushing)
Chlorhexidine antiseptic was evaluated in 19 studies included in
this review, but only 18 studies could be included in meta-analysis
for VAP
. One study was a very small pilot study with no usable
outcome data (Bopp 2006, n = 5).
Concentration of the chlorhexidine used was 2% in three studies
(Koeman 2006; Tantipong 2008; Meinberg 2012), 1% in one
study (Sebastian 2012), 0.20% in five studies (Berry 2011; Cabov
2010; Fourrier 2000; Fourrier 2005; Panchabhai 2009), unclear
in one study (Chen 2008), and 0.12% in the remaining studies.
We assessed 10 of the 19 studies at high risk of bias (Berry
2011; Bopp 2006; Chen 2008; Fourrier 2000; Grap 2011;
Meinberg 2012; Munro 2009; Panchabhai 2009; Scannapieco
2009; Tantipong 2008), four studies at low risk of bias (Bellissimo-
Rodrigues 2009; Fourrier 2005; Koeman 2006; Ozcaka 2012),
and the remaining five studies at unclear risk of bias.
We subgrouped these studies according to whether chlorhexidine
was administered as a liquid mouthrinse or a gel, and whether
chlorhexidine was used in conjunction with toothbrushing or not.
Incidence of VAP
Overall, the meta-analysis of 18 studies (nine studies at high risk of
bias, five at unclear risk of bias and four at low risk of bias) showed
a reduction in VAP with use of chlorhexidine (risk ratio (RR)
0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.89, P = 0.002, I2 =
31%; 2451 participants) (Analysis 1.1). This equates to a number
needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of
17 (95% CI 10 to 33).
Seven studies (1037 participants) compared chlorhexidine solu-
tion (0.12% or 0.2%) with either placebo (six studies) or ’usual
care’ (Grap 2011) without toothbrushing. Six of these studies
reported the use of a swab, either to clean the mouth prior to
chlorhexidine application or to ensure that the chlorhexidine so-
lution was applied to all oral surfaces. In the remaining study
(Chen 2008) the mode of application is unclear. The meta-anal-
ysis showed a reduction in VAP in the chlorhexidine group (RR
0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94, P = 0.02, I2 = 28%) (Analysis 1.1,
Subgroup 1.1.1).
A further five studies (669 participants) compared chlorhexidine
gel (0.2% or 2%) with placebo (no toothbrushing in either group)
and the meta-analysis showed a similar reduction in VAP associ-
ated with chlorhexidine gel (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.05, P =
0.08, I2 = 38%) (Analysis 1.1, Subgroup 1.1.2).
Three studies (405 participants) compared chlorhexidine solution
(2%, 0.12% or 0.2%) with placebo (with toothbrushing in both
groups). The meta-analysis showed a reduction in VAP in the
chlorhexidine group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.90, P = 0.02, I
2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.1, Subgroup 1.1.3).
Two further studies (Meinberg 2012; Kusahara 2012a, includ-
ing 52 adults and 96 children), at high and unclear risk of bias,
compared chlorhexidine gel (2% and 0.12%) with placebo (with
toothbrushing in both groups) and found no difference in the in-
cidence of VAP (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.79, P = 0.32, I2 =
0%) (Analysis 1.1, Subgroup 1.1.4).
Munro 2009 reported results from some of the participants ran-
domised into a study with a factorial design. This study showed
a reduction in VAP that did not attain statistical significance (P =
0.06) associated with the use of chlorhexidine, where exposure to
toothbrushing was equal in both groups (Analysis 1.1, Subgroup
1.1.5).
The pilot study by Bopp 2006 also showed a reduction in VAP
associated with chlorhexidine (Additional Table 1).
Mortality
The outcome of mortality was reported in 14 studies (2014 par-
ticipants), and overall the meta-analysis showed no evidence of
a difference between chlorhexidine and placebo/usual care with
minimal heterogeneity (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.23, P = 0.20 ,
I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.2). Nor was there evidence of a difference in
mortality between (P = 0.93) or within the subgroups (chlorhex-
idine mouthrinse/gel with or without toothbrushing) (Analysis
1.2; Additional Table 1).
Duration of ventilation
From the five studies (800 participants) that reported data in a way
that could be combined in meta-analysis, there is no evidence of
a difference in the duration of ventilation (days) between groups
receiving chlorhexidine compared to those receiving placebo/usual
care (mean difference (MD) -0.09 days, 95% CI -1.73 to 1.55
days, P = 0.91, I2 = 36%) (Analysis 1.3). There was no evidence
of a difference in duration of ventilation in any of the subgroups.
A further study (Meinberg 2012), comparing chlorhexidine gel
and placebo, also found no difference in duration of ventilation
(Additional Table 1).

 Duration of ICU stay
There was no evidence of a difference between those receiving
chlorhexidine compared to placebo/usual care in the outcome of
duration of ICU stay (days) (MD 0.21 days, 95% CI -1.48 to
1.89 days, P = 0.81, I2 = 9%; six RCTs, 833 participants). There
was no evidence of a difference in two subgroups (Analysis 1.4,
Subgroup 1.4.1; Subgroup 1.4.2) and insufficient evidence to de-
termine whether or not there was a difference in Analysis 1.4, Sub-
group 1.4.3.
Another study (Meinberg 2012) compared chlorhexidine gel with
placebo and also found no difference in duration of ICU stay
(Additional Table 1).
Use of systemic antibiotics
Two trials (374 participants) reported this outcome, but there
was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is
a difference in duration of systemic antibiotic therapy between
the chlorhexidine and control groups (MD 0.23 days, 95% CI -
0.85 to 1.30, P = 0.68, I2 = 50%; fixed-effect model). There was
moderate heterogeneity, probably due to the differences between
the two studies in the mode of chlorhexidine used (Analysis 1.5).
Oral health indices: plaque index
Two of the studies in this group reported the outcome of plaque in-
dex (Ozcaka 2012; Scannapieco 2009), but only Ozcaka 2012 re-
ported numerical data. Neither study found a difference in plaque
indices between the chlorhexidine and control groups (Analysis
1.6; Additional Table 1).
Adverse effects
Two studies in this group reported adverse effects. Tantipong 2008
found mild reversible irritation of the oral mucosa in 10% of the
chlorhexidine participants compared to 1% of the control group
participants (Analysis 1.7). Berry 2011 stated that there were no
adverse events in either group.
Adverse effects were not mentioned in the other studies in this
group.
Other outcomes
The outcomes of caregivers’ preferences and cost were not re-
ported.
Heterogeneity
The moderate statistical heterogeneity found for the outcome of
VAP incidence is likely to be due to clinical differences between
these studies, attributable to variability in the frequency, applica-
tion method, volume, and concentration of chlorhexidine solu-
tion (Analysis 1.1).
In Subgroup 1.1.1, six of the seven studies used a placebo control
and the volume of chlorhexidine (either 0.12% or 0.2%) used
varied between 10 and 50 ml administered either two, three, or
four times daily. One study used a single application by swab of
a very small volume of chlorhexidine preoperatively (Grap 2011).
One of the seven studies was in children aged from birth to 14
years (Jacomo 2011); the other studies recruited adults.
In Subgroup 1.1.2, there was also moderate heterogeneity, that
may be due to variations in the way the intervention was deliv-
ered. Three of the five studies in this subgroup administered 0.2%
chlorhexidine gel three times daily following rinsing of the mouth
and aspiration of rinse (Cabov 2010; Fourrier 2000; Fourrier
2005). The other two studies used a gel with higher chlorhexidine
concentration (2% and 1% respectively) and applied the gel using
a swab (Koeman 2006; Sebastian 2012).
Sensitivity analysis
For the primary outcomes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis ex-
cluding studies at high risk of bias. The estimate remained similar
for both VAP incidence (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.04, P = 0.09,
I2 = 28%; 1414 participants) compared with 0.74, and mortality
(RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.24, P = 0.92, I2 = 18%; 1157 par-
ticipants) compared with 1.09 (Analyses not shown).
A meta-analysis of the three studies of children (342 partici-
pants, aged from 3 months to 15 years) provided no evidence that
chlorhexidine compared to placebo showed a difference in the out-
comes of VAP (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.51, P = 0.82, I2 =
0%) or mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.20, P = 0.29, I2 =
0%) (Jacomo 2011; Kusahara 2012a; Sebastian 2012) (Analyses
not shown).
In addition, we also carried out sensitivity analyses by grouping the
included studies by chlorhexidine concentration. Results of these
subgroup analyses suggest no evidence of a difference between
subgroups or any dose-response relationship in either incidence of
VAP (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.59) (Analyses not shown).
Publication bias
Each of the subgroups in this comparison contained a small num-
ber of studies and it was therefore not appropriate to produce a
funnel plot to investigate possible publication bias.
Comparison 2: T
oothbrushing versus no
toothbrushing (with or without antiseptics)
The eight studies included in this comparison (Bopp 2006; Fields
2008; Long 2012; Lorente 2012; Munro 2009; Pobo 2009; Roca
Biosca 2011; Yao 2011) had toothbrushing as part of the inter-
vention versus no toothbrushing in the control group. The studies
were all at high risk of bias. Three studies used powered tooth-
brushes (Pobo 2009; Roca Biosca 2011), and five used manual
toothbrushes. Bopp 2006 was a very small pilot study (n = 5) and
21

 the data from this study are recorded in Additional Table 1; Fields
2008 reported no numerical data at all. Roca Biosca 2011 did not
report data for each arm of the study and we were not able to
obtain these data from the authors. Available data from this study
are recorded in Additional Table 1.
Incidence of VAP
There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of VAP due
totoothbrushinginthe combinedmeta-analysisof five studies(RR
0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09, P = 0.11 , I2 = 64%, 889 participants,
high risk of bias) (Analysis 2.1) or the combined meta-analysis of
four studies for chlorhexidine (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.21,
P = 0.26, I2 = 62%, 828 participants, high risk of bias) (analysis
not shown) (Lorente 2012; Munro 2009; Pobo 2009; Yao 2011),
with the substantial statistical heterogeneity likely to be explained
by the differences between the studies in exposure to antiseptics.
One small study ( (Yao 2011); 53 participants) at high risk of bias,
compared usual care plus the addition of twice daily toothbrush-
ing with a powered toothbrush, to usual care alone, and found a
reduction in VAP
. The usual-care intervention comprised the par-
ticipant’s bed being elevated 30° to 45°, hypopharyngeal suction-
ing, lips moistened with ’toothette’ swab and water, then further
hypopharyngeal suctioning. A second study with 147 participants,
also assessed at high risk of bias (Pobo 2009), compared powered
toothbrushing plus usual care including chlorhexidine, with usual
care alone, and found no difference in the outcome of VAP
. The
combined estimate from these studies showed no difference in the
incidence of VAP (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.53, P = 0.22, I
2 = 75%) (Analysis 2.1, Subgroup 2.1.1), with the heterogeneity
probably due to the additional exposure to chlorhexidine in both
groups of only one of the studies.
In Lorente 2012 (436 participants), where the intervention group
received toothbrushing with a manual toothbrush as well as
chlorhexidine, compared to chlorhexidine alone in the control
group, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of
VAP between the intervention and control groups (Analysis 2.1,
Subgroup 2.1.2).
Munro 2009, a study with a factorial design in 192 participants,
compared toothbrushing with no toothbrushing (equal exposure
to chlorhexidine in both arms), and reported no difference in the
development of VAP (Analysis 2.1, Subgroup 2.1.3).
A further study (Long 2012; 61 participants) compared tooth-
brushing plus povidone iodine with povidone iodine alone, and
found some evidence for a benefit for toothbrushing (Analysis 2.1,
Subgroup 2.1.4). The results of this study have not been repli-
cated, so should be interpreted with caution.
Bopp 2006 was a very small pilot study (n = 5) of toothbrushing
versus none, and the data are reported in Additional Table 1. There
were no numerical outcome data in the study by Fields 2008; the
report makes the statement that “the VAP rate dropped to zero
within a week of beginning the every 8 hours toothbrushing reg-
imen in the intervention group.” This rate of zero incidence of
VAP was reportedly sustained for six months. Roca Biosca 2011
recruited 117 participants and reported a summary estimate for
the outcome of VAP
, with no difference between powered tooth-
brushing and no toothbrushing (Additional Table 1).
Mortality
Five studies (889 participants) evaluated the effect of toothbrush-
ing, as an addition to oral care, on the outcome of mortality (Long
2012; Lorente 2012; Munro 2009; Pobo 2009; Yao 2011). The
comparisons were different in each trial and there was no evidence
of a difference in mortality with or without toothbrushing (RR
0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.09, P = 0.24 , I2 = 0%) (Analysis 2.2).
Duration of ventilation
Meta-analysis of two trials of chlorhexidine (583 participants) re-
ported the outcome of mean duration of mechanical ventilation,
and showed no difference associated with toothbrushing (MD -
0.85 days, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.73 days, P = 0.29, I2 = 0%; fixed-
effect model) (Analysis 2.3). A further trial of povidone iodine also
failed to show a benefit for toothbrushing for this outcome (Long
2012).
The data from Bopp 2006 are reported in Additional Table 1.
Duration of ICU stay
Meta-analysis of two trials (583 participants) that reported the
outcome of mean duration of ICU stay found no evidence of a
difference between the groups (MD -1.82 days, 95%CI -3.95 to
0.32 days, P = 0.10, I2 = 0%, fixed-effect model, Analysis 2.4).
The data from Bopp 2006 are reported in Additional Table 1.
Use of systemic antibiotics
This outcome was not reported by any of the studies in this group.
Oral health indices: plaque score
One study (Yao 2011) also reported the outcome of plaque score
in each group after seven to eight days. The study failed to show
evidence of reduced plaque in the toothbrushing group (Analysis
2.5).
Roca Biosca 2011 reported plaque scores, without any estimates
of variance. The trial report also stated that there was no difference
between the groups (Additional Table 1).
Adverse effects
Pobo 2009 reported that there were no adverse effects reported
in either arm of the study and none of the other studies in this
comparison mentioned adverse effects.

 Other outcomes
The outcomes of caregivers’ preferences and cost were not re-
ported.
Comparison 3: Powered toothbrushing versus manual
toothbrushing
One small study of 78 participants (Prendergast 2012), assessed
at high risk of bias, compared the use of a powered toothbrush
as a component of ’comprehensive oral care’ with a control group
receiving manual toothbrushing and standard oral care.
In this study there was no difference between the intervention and
control groups for the outcomes of incidence of VAP
, mortality or
mean duration of ventilation or ICU stay (Analysis 3.1; Analysis
3.2; Analysis 3.3; Analysis 3.4). There were no adverse effects
mentioned in this study. The outcomes of oral health indices,
systemic antibiotic therapy, caregivers’ preferences for oral hygiene
care or cost were not reported in the study.
Comparison 4: Other oral care solutions
Thirteen studies were included in this comparison, with a total of
2702 participants randomised to treatments (Berry 2011; Berry
2013; Caruso 2009; Feng 2012; Hu 2009; Mo 2016; Seguin 2006;
Seguin 2014; Stefanescu 2013; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008;
Zhao 2012). Twelve of these studies were at high risk of bias and
Seguin 2014 was at low risk of bias. The studies evaluated the
effects of other solutions with a potential antiseptic effect on the
outcomes of VAP
, mortality, duration of ventilation, and duration
of ICU stay.
Incidence of VAP
Three studies (356 participants) compared povidone iodine rinse
with a saline rinse or placebo (Feng 2012; Seguin 2006; Seguin
2014). They showed evidence of a reduction in VAP (RR 0.69,
95% CI 0.50 to 0.95, P = 0.02, I2 = 74%, fixed-effect model)
(Analysis 4.1, Subgroup 4.1.1).
Seguin 2006 (67 participants) also compared povidone iodine
rinse with usual care (suction alone with no rinse) and found a
reduction in VAP (Analysis 4.1, Subgroup 4.1.2). The result of
this study has not been replicated, so should be interpreted with
caution.
Four studies (488 participants) (Mo 2016; Tang 2013; Xu 2007;
Xu 2008), all at high risk of bias, which compared a saline rinse
with a saline-soaked swab found some weak evidence that saline
rinse reduced the incidence of VAP (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to
0.62, P < 0.001, I2 = 84%, fixed-effect model) (Analysis 4.1, Sub-
group 4.1.3).
Twostudies(Caruso 2009; Seguin 2006; 324participants), both at
high risk of bias, compared a saline rinse with usual care (no rinse)
and found a reduction in VAP (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.91,
P = 0.02, I2 = 64%, fixed-effect model) (Analysis 4.1, Subgroup
4.1.4). While this result should be interpreted cautiously due to
the high risk of bias, there appears to be some evidence that the
use of a saline rinse prior to aspiration of secretions was associated
with reduction of VAP
.
Hu 2009 and Xu 2007, both at high risk of bias, compared both
saline rinse plus swab, with a saline-soaked swab alone (usual care)
and found some very weak evidence (from 153 participants) that
the combined rinse plus swab reduced the incidence of VAP (RR
0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.72, P = 0.002, I2 = 0%, fixed-effect model)
(Analysis 4.1, Subgroup 4.1.5).
Two studies (Berry 2011; Berry 2013; 425 participants), both at
high risk of bias, compared bicarbonate rinse plus toothbrushing
with a water rinse plus toothbrushing and found no evidence of a
difference in the incidence of VAP (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.43,
P = 0.94, I2 = 0%, fixed-effect model) (Analysis 4.1, Subgroup
4.1.6).
A single study compared triclosan rinse with saline rinse and found
no difference in the outcome of VAP over the duration of the
study (Zhao 2012) (Analysis 4.1, Subgroup 4.1.7). The results of
this study have not been replicated, so should be interpreted with
caution.
A single three-arm study compared povidone iodine, furacilin and
usual care (Feng 2012). It found both antiseptics combined with
toothbrushing were more effective than usual care (Analysis 4.1,
Subgroup 4.1.1 and Analysis 4.1, Subgroup 4.1.9) with little dif-
ference between the two antiseptic solutions (Analysis 4.1, Sub-
group 4.1.8).
A single study (Berry 2013; 265 participants), comparing Listerine
with water, and Listerine with bicarbonate, found no evidence of a
difference in VAP incidence (Analysis 4.1, Subgroups 4.1.10 and
4.1.11).
Another single study (Stefanescu 2013; 41 participants) compared
Biotene OralBalance with control and found no difference in in-
cidence of VAP (Analysis 4.1, Subgroup 4.1.12).
Mortality
Seven studies reported mortality in the following comparisons
(Analysis 4.2).
• Povidone iodine versus saline/placebo: two studies (217
participants) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.50, P = 0.98, I2 =
65%; fixed-effect model), no evidence to suggest a difference in
mortality.
• Povidone iodine versus usual care: single study (67
participants), no evidence to suggest a difference.
• Saline rinse versus saline swab: two studies (270
participants) (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69; P = 0.005, I2 =
0%; fixed-effect model), suggesting a significant reduction in
mortality for saline rinse.
• Saline rinse versus usual care: two studies (324 participants)
(RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.39, P = 0.43, I2 = 2%; fixed-effect

 model), no evidence to suggest a difference in mortality.
• Saline rinse plus swab versus saline swab (usual care): single
study (47 participants), no evidence to suggest a difference.
• Biotene OralBalance versus control: single study (41
participants), no evidence to suggest a difference.
Duration of ventilation
Six studies reported duration of ventilation (days) in the following
comparisons (Analysis 4.3).
• Povidone iodine versus saline/placebo: single study (67
participants), no evidence to suggest a difference.
• Povidone iodine versus usual care: single study (67
participants), no evidence to suggest a difference.
• Saline rinse versus usual care: two studies (324 participants)
(MD -0.40 days, 95% CI -2.55 to 1.75 days, P = 0.72, I2 = 0%),
no evidence to suggest a difference in duration of ventilation.
• Saline rinse plus swab versus saline swab (usual care): single
study (47 participants) suggesting a statistically significant effect
in favour of shorter duration for the saline rinse plus swab.
• Saline rinse versus saline swab: two studies (176
participants) (MD -6.83 days, 95% CI -8.94 to -4.72 days; P <
0.00001, I2 = 65%) suggest saline rinse leads to shorter duration
of ventilation.
• Triclosan rinse versus saline: single study (324 participants)
suggesting that triclosan leads to shorter duration of ventilation
than saline.
Berry 2013, comparing Listerine with water, and Listerine with
bicarbonate, found no difference among groups in median ventila-
tion hours. Another study (Stefanescu 2013), comparing Biotene
OralBalance and control, also found no difference between groups
in duration of ventilation. (Additional Table 1)
Duration of ICU stay
Four studies reported duration of ICU stay (days) in the following
comparisons (Analysis 4.4).
• Povidone iodine versus saline/placebo: two studies (217
participants) (MD -0.35 days, 95% CI -3.90 to 3.21 days, P =
0.85, I2 = 0%; fixed-effect model), no evidence to suggest a
difference.
• Povidone iodine versus usual care: single study (67
participants), no evidence to suggest a difference.
• Saline rinse versus usual care: two studies (324 participants)
(MD -1.17 days, 95% CI -3.95 to 1.60 days, P = 0.41, I2 =
32%; fixed-effect model), no evidence to suggest a difference in
duration of ICU stay.
• Triclosan rinse versus saline: single study (324 participants),
suggesting that triclosan leads to shorter stay in ICU than saline.
Another study (Berry 2013), comparing Listerine with water, and
Listerine with bicarbonate, found no difference among groups in
median ICU length of stay (Additional Table 1).
Use of systemic antibiotics
Seguin 2014, comparing povidone iodine and placebo, showed
no evidence of a difference in the number of participants treated
with systemic antibiotics (Analysis 4.5). Berry 2013, comparing
Listerine with water, and Listerine with bicarbonate, found no dif-
ference among groups in antibiotic administration. See Additional
Table 1.
Adverse effects
Seguin 2014 found no evidence of a difference in the occurrence
of acute respiratory distress syndrome, agitation and/or hyperten-
sion, epistaxis, oxygen desaturation and aspiration (Analysis 4.6).
Berry 2013 found no adverse events associated with interventions.
Stefanescu 2013, comparing Biotene OralBalance and control,
found no significant difference between groups with respect to
adverse events in buccal mucosa. See Additional Table 1.

Summary of main results
We included 38 randomised controlled trials in this updated re-
view and these studies evaluate four main groups of interventions
in the oral hygiene care of critically ill patients receiving mechan-
ical ventilation for at least 48 hours in intensive care units.
• Chlorhexidine (CHX) antiseptic versus placebo/usual care
(with or without toothbrushing)
There is high quality evidence from 18 RCTs that the use of
chlorhexidine (either as a mouthrinse or a gel) reduces the in-
cidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from 25% to
about19%(Summary of findings for themain comparison). There
is no evidence that use of chlorhexidine is associated with a dif-
ference in mortality (moderate-quality evidence), duration of me-
chanical ventilation (low-quality evidence) or duration of ICU
stay (moderate quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence
to determine the effect of chlorhexidine on the other secondary
outcomes of this review.
• Toothbrushing versus no toothbrushing (with or without
antiseptics)
Based on five RCTs (very low quality evidence), we found no evi-
dence of adifference inthe incidence of VAPdue totoothbrushing.
There is also no evidence for a difference between toothbrushing
or no toothbrushing for the outcomes of mortality (low quality
evidence), duration of ventilation (low quality evidence) or dura-
tion of ICU stay (very low quality evidence) (Summary of findings
2).
• Oral care with powered toothbrush versus oral care with
manual toothbrush
From the single study in this comparison, there is insufficient ev-
idence to determine the effects of powered versus manual tooth-
brushing on the outcomes of VAP
, mortality, duration of mechan-
ical ventilation or duration of ICU stay.
• Oral care with other solutions
The studies in this comparison, most of which are at high overall
risk of bias, made different comparisons. For the reduction of VAP
,
there is some weak evidence that povidone iodine rinse is more
effective than saline/placebo, use of saline rinse is more effective
than saline swab, use of both a saline swab and a saline rinse may
be more effective than a saline swab alone, and use of saline rinse
may be more effective than usual care. There is no evidence of a
difference between bicarbonate rinse and a water rinse.
For the outcome of mortality, we found no evidence of a differ-
ence between povidone iodine rinse and saline/placebo or between
saline rinse and usual care. We found some very weak evidence of
a difference between saline rinse and saline swab.
For the duration of ventilation, we found no evidence of a differ-
ence between saline rinse and usual care, and some weak evidence
that saline rinse leads to shorter duration of ventilation compared
to saline swab. For the duration of ICU stay, we found no evi-
dence of a difference between povidone iodine and saline/placebo
or between saline rinse and usual care.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In this review, we have included studies that compared active oral
hygiene care interventions with either placebo or usual care. We
recognise that the use of a placebo is a better control comparison
in research studies because it enables the masking of caregivers
to which group participants are in active or control group, thus
eliminating some possible performance bias. However, we chose
to include pragmatic studies where ’usual care’ was the control
comparator, despite recognising that in many instances ’usual care’
was not specified and may have varied between participants and
between individual caregivers. Where there was no blinding, we
assessed studies as being at high risk of performance and detection
bias.
There are some other variables which may have influenced the
outcomes in the included studies. These include the number of
episodes of OHC a day, the ’dose’ of the antiseptic, and whether
participants were dentate or edentulous. Most of the studies (79%)
stated that they delivered between two and four episodes of OHC
per day. Nine studies specified that edentulous people were ex-
cluded, one study focused on newborns, but most of the included
studies did not report whether or not participants were dentate.
We investigatedwhetherthere wasadose-response effectandcould
find no evidence for this.
We also recognise that participation in a research study is likely to
have a positive effect on the performance of ’usual care’, improving
both the quality of care and compliance with routine practice - a
Hawthorne effect (McCarney 2007). The combination of a ’usual
care’ control group, the absence of caregiver blinding in most cases,
andthe Hawthorne effectof beingpartof astudymayhave reduced
the observed difference in effect between the active and control
interventions in these studies. Two of the studies noted that care
was recorded in patient notes, but none of the studies included in
this review reported compliance with oral hygiene care protocols.
Another area of variability between the studies (and possibly also
between studies and usual practice) is the diagnosis of VAP
, which
is at least partly subjective and may be based on variable diagnostic
criteria. Most of the included studies (33/38) stated the criteria
used to diagnose VAP
, of which the two most common were some
version of the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) based on
Pugin’s criteria (Cook 1998; Pugin 1991) (17 studies) and Centers
forDisease Control (CDC)criteriaasdescribedinHoran 2008 (six
studies). Six studies conducted in China used Chinese Society of
Respiratory Diseases (CSRD) criteria for diagnosis of VAP (Chen
2008; Feng 2012; Mo 2016; Tang 2013; Xu 2007; Xu 2008).

Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (Review)

 Currently there is no clearly accepted gold standard for the diag-
nosis of VAP
, and when different criteria are applied to the same
cohort of patients, the estimated VAP prevalence could vary widely
(Klompas 2007). In light of the limited sensitivity and specificity
of the traditional VAP diagnosis, the US Centers for Disease Con-
trol (CDC) has recently developed a new surveillance criterion,
ventilator-associatedevent(VAE), toincorporate all complications
(including VAP) leading to the worsening of gas exchange in me-
chanically-ventilated patients. However, the advent of a more ob-
jective and definitive diagnosis of VAP may depend on further
development of biomarker technologies, which may not occur in
the near future. (Waters 2015)
Although this review found evidence that the use of chlorhexidine
as part of oral care reduces the incidence of VAP
, there was no evi-
dence of a reduction in mortality. This is in contrast to a review by
Price 2014, which claimed that CHX is possibly associated with
increased mortality. There has been some debate in the literature
about the attributable mortality of VAP
, but a recent survival anal-
ysis of nearly 4500 patients found that ICU mortality attributable
to VAP was about 1% on day 30 (Bekaert 2011), which might
explain our findings.
This review has not found evidence that oral care including both
toothbrushing and chlorhexidine is different from oral care with
chlorhexidine alone in reducing VAP
. Only one of the trials of
toothbrushing which reported the outcome of VAP also reported
plaque levels as an indicator of the effectiveness of the toothbrush-
ing carried out in this trial (Yao 2011). This small trial (53 partici-
pants), which we assessed at high risk of bias, did not use chlorhex-
idine in either group, and found a reduction in both plaque and
VAP in the powered toothbrushing group compared to the no-
toothbrushing group. Three other trials of toothbrushing in our
meta-analysis (Lorente 2012 (manual), Munro 2009 (manual),
Pobo 2009 (powered toothbrush), with a combined total of 775
participants included exposure to chlorhexidine in both interven-
tion and control groups. Assessed at unclear, high and high risks
of bias respectively, meta-analysis of these three trials showed no
evidence of a difference in the outcome of VAP
. A further study
(Roca Biosca 2011), included in this review and also at high risk of
bias, could not be included in the meta-analysis, but also found no
difference between oral care with chlorhexidine and toothbrush-
ing and oral care with chlorhexidine alone. All five of these studies
described the toothbrushing intervention in detail, and noted that
nurses delivering the intervention received specific training. While
the presence of ventilator tubes in the mouths of trial participants
makes effective toothbrushing difficult, it seems likely that, despite
this, the toothbrushing intervention was carried out thoroughly
within these trials.
Earlier cohort studies noted that patients in ICU who developed
VAP were likely to have increased length of stay in the ICU
(Apostolopoulou 2003; Cook 1998). However, our Cochrane Re-
view has not evaluated duration of ICU stay in patients who de-
velop VAP
. The studies in our review reported mean length of ICU
stay and the standard deviation for each arm of the study. We have
combined these in meta-analyses based on an assumption that the
duration of ICU stay in each arm of each trial follows an approx-
imately normal distribution. In fact, the distribution of duration
of stay in ICU is likely to be skewed, and the means are likely to
be a poor indicator of the effect of oral hygiene care on duration
of ICU stay.
Our review has not looked at the outcome of cost of interventions.
However, it is likely that the additional cost of using an antisep-
tic mouthrinse or gel is low in comparison with the cost of the
antibiotics used to treat VAP
. One study reported the cost of the
chlorhexidine gluconate solution by participant was USD 3.15
(Jacomo 2011), while the cost associated with a single incident
of VAP was estimated at USD 10,000 to 40,000 (Hillier 2013;
Waters 2015). Reducing the incidence of VAP using relatively in-
expensive additions to usual care is likely to be cost-effective, as
well as avoiding additional morbidity for the patient.
The increasing incidence of bacteria which are resistant to current
antibiotics is of concern worldwide, and one of the reasons for
bacterial resistance is the overuse of systemic antibiotics (Gyssens
2011). Oral hygiene care using antiseptics such as chlorhexidine,
to reduce the risk of VAP
, could potentially also result in a re-
duced requirement for these patients to be treated with systemic
antibiotics. Because only four of the 38 studies included in this
review provided data about the duration of antibiotic use in study
participants, we do not have sufficient information to determine
whether there was any effect on systemic antibiotic use.
It is interesting that only one of the 19 studies that evaluated
chlorhexidine reported adverse reactions to chlorhexidine (mild
reversible irritation of the oral mucosa) (Tantipong 2008). Hyper-
sensitivity is a rare but potentially severe side effect of chlorhex-
idine (Pemberton 2012). In over 2000 participants included in
these studies there was no report of hypersensitivity to chlorhex-
idine. However, it is notable that in six of the included stud-
ies (DeRiso 1996; Jacomo 2011; Kusahara 2012a; Ozcaka 2012;
Scannapieco 2009; Sebastian 2012), a prior history of hypersen-
sitivity to chlorhexidine was an exclusion criterion during partic-
ipant recruitment. In view of recent reports in the UK of two
cases of serious adverse events associated with irrigation of dry
socket with chlorhexidine mouthrinse, it is recommended that all
members of the dental team prescribing chlorhexidine products
are aware of the potential for both minor and serious adverse side
effects (Pemberton 2012).
Quality of the evidence
All the included studies were prospective, randomised controlled
trials, but only five of them (13%) were assessed at low risk of
bias (Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009; Fourrier 2005; Koeman 2006;
Ozcaka 2012; Sebastian 2012) for all domains. However, we did
not consider that the impact of bias reduced our confidence in
the outcome of VAP incidence. Although more than two-thirds
28
Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (Review)

 of included studies had a high risk of bias for at least one domain,
sensitivity analysis by risk of bias did not alter the size or direc-
tion of the effect for VAP (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison). This provides support for our decision to consider
the quality of the evidence for this outcome to be high. In contrast,
we downgraded the quality of evidence for duration of ventila-
tion and stay in ICU, because we could not rule out bias having a
greater impact on these resource use outcomes. Most studies did
not provide information on adverse events, and the scant informa-
tion we could obtain from two studies prompted us to downgrade
the quality of evidence to very low.
Potential biases in the review process
In order to reduce the risk of publication bias, we conducted a
broad search for both published and unpublished studies, with no
restrictionsonlanguage.We searchedthe reference listsof included
studies and contacted many of the study authors in order to obtain
information that was not included in the published reports. We
also searched the reference lists of other published reviews of oral
hygiene care for critically ill patients.
For this review we also chose very broad inclusion criteria, which
has resulted in a clinically heterogeneous group of studies includ-
ing adults, children and neonates, and a range of indications for
ICUcare, includingmedical conditions, surgeryandtraumawhere
patients were ventilated for over 48 hours. In some of the included
studies, the precise details of what was involved in the oral hygiene
care intervention were poorly described, making it difficult to de-
termine the similarity between studies in oral hygiene care prac-
tices. There was also potential variation in the methods used for
intubation and for the calculation of duration outcomes (e.g. dura-
tion of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay) (Contentin
2014), both of which were not always clearly specified.
One other potential bias in this review is the variation in and
the subjective nature of criteria/methods used for VAP diagno-
sis (Klompas 2007). Also, we have made a number of changes
to the methods of this review since the publication of the proto-
col (see Differences between protocol and review). Some of these
changes were clarifications, and some were to take account of other
Cochrane Reviews published or in preparation, to avoid unneces-
sary duplication of effort. We acknowledge that post hoc changes
to the review methods may introduce a risk of bias into this review.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
A previous meta-analysis by Pineda 2006 found that the use of
chlorhexidine for oral decontamination did not reduce the inci-
dence of nosocomial pneumonia. However, their meta-analysis in-
cluded only four studies and the outcome was nosocomial pneu-
moniaratherthanVAP
. AnothersystematicreviewbyLabeau 2011
included 14 studies of either chlorhexidine or povidone iodine
antiseptics and found that the use of antiseptics as part of oral
hygiene care reduced the incidence of VAP by approximately one-
third. Our review confirmed these findings.
One recent systematic review (Price 2014) has looked at the effects
of selective digestive/oropharyngeal decontamination and topical
oropharyngeal chlorhexidine on the prevention of death in general
intensive care, and claimed that CHX is possibly associated with
increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50).
Reasons for the discrepancy between this finding and ours mainly
include differences in the review scope (e.g. whether focused on
adults, general intensive care only) and review methodology (e.g.
inclusion of studies for which only abstracts are available). With
less strict eligibility criteria for settings and participants and more
stringent inclusion criteria for the reporting and methodology of
primary studies, we believe that our finding is more generalisable
and reflects the current evidence base. More trials are needed of
the association between CHX usage and ICU mortality, to provide
more insight into this issue.
Two more recent systematic reviews have looked at the effects
of chlorhexidine with different concentrations. One claimed that
the use of higher concentration chlorhexidine was associated
with higher mortality (Klompas 2014), and the other stated that
chlorhexidine with the concentration of 0.12% had the best effect
in reducing VAP incidence (Zhang 2013). However, these find-
ings were all based on trivial differences in point estimates, with
wide confidence intervals for each estimate and statistically non-
significant differences between concentrations. The results of our
sensitivity analyses do not support the dose-response relationships
that they proposed, and confirm that differences between concen-
trations were statistically non-significant.
Two published meta-analyses of toothbrushing to reduce VAP in-
cluded four trials and found no evidence for a difference in inci-
dence of VAP
, againpossiblydue tolowstatistical power(Alhazzani
2013; Gu 2012). Our review reaches similar conclusions.

Implications for practice
Effective oral hygiene care is important for ventilated patients in
intensive care to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia. The def-
inition of oral hygiene care varied among the studies included in
this review, but common elements include cleaning of the teeth
and gums with a swab or gauze, removing secretions using suction,
and rinsing the mouth. There is evidence from our review that
oral hygiene care incorporating chlorhexidine mouthrinse or gel
is effective in reducing the development of ventilator-associated
pneumonia in adults in intensive care. We found no evidence of
an association between oral hygiene care and mortality, duration
of mechanical ventilation, and duration of ICU stay. For the other
29

 comparisons assessed in this review, fewer studies contributed ev-
idence and consequently the quality of the body of evidence was
lower.
Implications for research
Although the included studies provided some evidence for the
benefits of oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent
ventilator-associated pneumonia, incomplete reporting of studies
is a major limitation. More consistent use of the CONSORT state-
ment for reporting of randomised controlled trials (CONSORT
2012) would increase the value of research.
1. Detailed reporting of methods, such as generation of
allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and numbers and
reasons for withdrawals and exclusions.
2. Use of a placebo where possible to enable blinding.
3. Full reporting of methods used to diagnose ventilator-
associated pneumonia.
4. Reporting of adverse effects of interventions.
Further trials of oral hygiene care (including use of manual or
powered toothbrushes, or swabs) should report both measures of
effectiveness of plaque removal and prevention of ventilator-asso-
ciated pneumonia. They should also state explicitly whether those
patients who have died during the study are included in the calcu-
lation of duration outcomes (e.g. duration of ICU stay, duration
of mechanical ventilation).
Future studies may also consider adopting the new definitions and
diagnostic criteria (ventilator-associated event, VAE) recently de-
veloped by the US CDC (Waters 2015), which is likely to over-
come the limitations of traditional VAP diagnosis and facilitate
high quality synthesis of research findings.

Number of centres: 1
Study period: March 2006 to February 2008
Funding source: Not stated
Participants
Setting: ICU in tertiary care hospital
Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to ICU with expected stay > 48 hours. Not all
participants received mechanical ventilation
Exclusion criteria: Previous chlorhexidine sensitivity, pregnancy, formal indication for
chlorhexidine use, prescription of another oral topical medication
Number randomised: 200 (only 133 on ventilators)
Number evaluated: 194
Baseline characteristics:
- Intervention group: Age: median 62.5 (17 - 89) M/F: 47/51; APACHE II Score: median
17 (5 - 35)
- Control group: Age: median 54.0 (15 - 85) M/F: 51/45; APACHE II Score: median
19 (5 - 41)
Interventions
Comparison: 0.12% chlorhexidine solution versus placebo
Experimental group (n = 64 on vent): 0.12% chlorhexidine solution applied orally 3
times daily. Oral hygiene was conducted by nurses specially trained in the protocol. 3
times daily after mechanical cleaning of the mouth by a nurse, 15 ml of study solution
was applied and attempts made to distribute solution over all oral surfaces
Control group (n = 69 on vent): The same protocol was conducted with the placebo
solution, which was identical in colour, consistency, smell and taste
Outcomes
1. Respiratory tract infections (VAP for those on ventilators)
2. Respiratory tract infection-free survival time
3. Time from ICU admission to first RTI
4. Duration of mechanical ventilation
5. Length of ICU stay
6. Total mortality
7. Mortality due to RTI
8. Antibiotic use
9. Microbiological culture of endotracheal secretions
10. Adverse effects
Notes
Sample size calculation: “to have sufficient power to detect a 69% difference in incidence
of VAP with α = 5% and β = 20% it was estimated that 96 patients per group were
required”
Only 133/194 of patients evaluated received mechanical ventilation

- Intervention group: Age: 12 ± 49.75 months; M/F: 28/18
- Control group: Age: 34.5 ± 58.8 months; M/F: 32/18
Interventions
Toothbrushing + 0.12% chlorhexidine gel versus toothbrushing + placebo
Experimental group: Oral care with toothbrushing and oral gel containing chlorhexidine
twice daily (08:00 & 20:00 hours). Mouth was divided into 4 quadrants and each
brushed in a defined pattern. With child in lateral position, gel was applied directly to
toothbrush, and all tooth surfaces (vestibular, lingual, occlusal and incisal) were cleaned
and ventral surface of tongue was brushed posterior to anterior. Each quadrant was rinsed
with water and excess fluid and debris were removed with continuous suction. Finally
oral foam applicator was immersed in the gel and applied all over the gingival surfaces
of the participant
Control group: Oral care with toothbrushing and placebo oral gel twice daily. With
child in lateral position, gel was applied directly to toothbrush, and all tooth surfaces
(vestibular, lingual, occlusal and incisal) were cleaned and ventral surface of tongue was

Study period: Not stated
Funding source: This work was supported by Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias (FISS
06/060), Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Enfermedades Respiratorias (06/
06/36), and the Agency for the Administration of University and Research Grants (2005/
SGR/920)
Participants
Inclusion criteria: Intubated adults without evidence of pulmonary infection, expected
to remain ventilated for > 48 hours. Randomised within 12 hours of intubation
Exclusion criteria: Edentulous, suspicion of pneumonia at time of intubation or evidence
of massive aspiration during intubation, tracheostomy (or expected within 48 hours),
recent enrolment in other trials, pregnancy, and chlorhexidine allergy
Age group: Adults
Intervention group: n = 74; age: 55.3 ± 17.9; M/F: 49/25; mean APACHE II Score: 18.

Control group: n = 73; age: 52.6 ± 17.2; M/F: 46/27; mean APACHE II Score: 18.7 ±
7.3
Number randomised: 147 (74 in toothbrush group and 73 in standard care group)
Number evaluated: 147
Interventions
Comparison: Powered toothbrush + standard oral care versus standard oral care
alone
Group 1 (n = 74): Standard oral care plus toothbrush group: besides the standard oral
care, toothbrushing was performed tooth by tooth, on anterior and posterior surfaces,
and along the gumline, the tongue was also brushed. A powered toothbrush was used
(Braun Oral B AdvancePower 450 TX, Braun GmbH). This procedure was repeated
once every 8 hours
Group 2 (n = 73): Standard oral care: maintaining head elevation at 30°. After aspira-
tion of oropharyngeal secretions and adjustment of endotracheal cuff pressure, a gauze
containing 20 ml of 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate was applied to all the oral surfaces
including tongue and mucosal surface, and 10 ml of 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate
was injected into oral cavity, being aspirated after 30 seconds, repeated every 8 hours
Outcomes
The following outcome variables were reported for each group:
1. Incidence of VAP
2. Incidence of suspected VAP per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation
3. Mean days of mechanical ventilation (mean ± SD)
4. ICU length of stay (mean ± SD)
5. Mortality
Notes
In the review, the standard oral care group was viewed as intervention with chlorhexidine
and the other group was viewed as control with toothbrushing
Sample size calculation: Estimated that 200 participants would be required in each
group to show a 50% reduction in VAP with 80% power and α error of 5%. After 147
of planned 400 participants were randomised, the study was stopped by the steering
committee due to no difference in VAP between the groups

2% chlorhexidine solution, until their endotracheal tubes were removed
Control group (n = 105): Underwent the same oral care procedure with normal saline
solution
Outcomes
The following outcome variables were reported for each group:
1. Incidence of VAP
2. Number of cases of VAP per 1000 ventilator days
3. Incidence of VAP for participants who received mechanical ventilation for > 2 days
4. Overall mortality
5. Mean days of mechanical ventilation (mean ± SD)

Interventions
Comparison: Yikou (triclosan) rinse versus saline
Experimental group: Oral cavity swab with 15 ml of Yikou gargle (triclosan is main
ingredient), 4 times a day
Control group: Oral cavity swab with normal saline, 4 times a day
Secretions were aspirated using suction once daily and sent to lab for culture
Outcomes
3 outcome variables were available:
1. Incidence of VAP in < 4 days of ventilation and within 4 - 10 days of ventilation
2. Mechanical ventilation days
3. ICU stay days
4. Culture of the samples taking from oropharyngeal cavity and inferior respiratory tract
(Table 3, detection rates of microbial pathogens before and after oral nursing care were
listed)
Notes
Diagnosis of VAP was mainly determined by microbial examination of the aspirate
secretions from the inferior respiratory tract, which was performed every day

Mortality data for chlorhexidine, 23 November 2016
Summary
Hua et al examined the effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) on mortality (analysis 1.2) and found no benefit of CHX compared to placebo
(risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.23).a Those results differ to those derived in a recent meta-analysis by our
group (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50).b The review authors specifically discussed this and suggested that this discrepancy
could be accounted for by differences in review methodology.
We fully agree. We sought to explore the effect of CHX (and selective digestive or oropharygneal decontamination) on mortality
in general adult intensive care units so we excluded studies on cardiac surgery patients and children. We did include a study by
MacNaughton et al that was published only as an abstractc. Hua et al suggested that our inclusion of this abstract might contribute
to the observed difference in the two pooled estimates. However, removal of this study from our meta-analysis leads to a very similar
result (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56).
When considering the studies included in both our reviews, there were three studies that both Hua et al and we identified but handled
differently. We wonder if this accounts for much of the observed discrepancy.
Berry et ald: the primary outcome of this study was bacterial growth at day 4. Berry et al accordingly excluded patients who had died
within 96 hours from their analysis; this is shown in Figure 1 of their paper. Although Hua et al state that they used intensive care unit
(ICU) mortality when available, they appear to have used these 96-hour mortality data in their pooled estimates. Berry et al did not
publish ICU mortality data but we managed to obtain the data from them.
Koeman et ale: the authors omitted mortality data from this moderately large (relevant arms consisting of 257 patients) and robust trial
from their pooled estimates. We included these data. Of note, other meta-analyses on this subject that have examined mortality have
included this study in their pooled estimates; Hua et al are unique in choosing to exclude it (references on request).
Munro et alf Hua et al chose to use the “day 3 analysis sample” rather than obtaining intention-to-treat data. This means they have
included only 192 patients out of an enrolled population of 547 (the largest randomised controlled trial on this subject published to
date). In their paper, Munro et al explained how this group came about: “Of the 547 enrolled patients, 249 were still endotracheally
intubated on study day 3; of these, 209 patients had complete day 3 CPIS [Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score] data. Because of
missing values on some of the components of the CPIS, only 192 patients had CPIS values on both days 1 and 3, and their data could
be analyzed completely.” Accordingly, 298 patients have been excluded either owing to extubation or death and 57 patients have been
excluded owing to lack of data for a scoring system that is irrelevant to the outcome of death.
In summary, the authors have, in our view, three relevant omissions in their dataset. These might be for reasons such as being unable to
contact authors, as indeed was the case for one of our included studiesg. Nevertheless, there has been substantial attrition of potentially
available data in their pooled estimate and accordingly we question if they are correct in their claim that their result “reflects the current
evidence base”.

Reply
We thank Price and colleagues for their feedback on our reviewa. We know that the association between oral care using CHX and ICU
mortality has been a hot topic in recent years, with lots of new discussions in the literature.b,c,d,
In the Discussion section of our review, we mentioned the Price 2014 reviewc and said, “Reasons for the discrepancy between this
finding and ours mainly include differences in the review scope (e.g. whether focused on adults, general intensive care only) and review
methodology (e.g. inclusion of studies for which only abstracts are available).”
Firstly, in their review Price et alc excluded trials carried out on cardiac surgery patients and children, while our review did not have
such restrictions. Also, one of our main inclusion criteria for trials and participants was mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 48
hours, but Price et alc did not state such a requirement. Therefore the questions that these two reviews tried to answer were essentially
different. For instance, the DeRiso 1996 studye, which enrolled only cardiac surgery patients, was included in our review but not in
Price 2014c. If Price 2014 were to include this study, their pooled OR would become 1.19 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.46). Actually, other
similar systematic reviewsb,f have also included DeRiso 1996. In addition, according to a post-hoc subgroup analysis, we found that
the mortality results of the adult trials and the child trials included in our Analysis 1.2 were not significantly different (P = 0.14),
indicating that analysing these two types of trials separately may not be necessary.
Secondly, there is potential risk in directly using unpublished trial data from previous systematic reviews. Such data may or may not be
trustworthy. One perfect example here is that for the same MacNaughton 2004 studyg, an abstract that did not clearly report results
for mortality, data used in Price 2014 (29/101 for treatment, 29/93 for control)c and Klompas 2014 (36/91 for treatment, 33/88 for
control)b differed substantially. In terms of Koeman 2006, we noticed that both Price et alc and Klompas et alb used data provided in
a previous systematic reviewf , but without verifying the data by contacting original authors. As documented in our ’Characteristics of
included studies’ table, we tried to contact Koeman et alh for data confirmation but failed (invalid email address). Plus, if we used the
same Koeman data as in Price 2014c, our pooled RR would remain similar (1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.25).
We noticed that for multiple studies, including Berry 2011i and Munro 2009j , the data that we used for Analysis 1.2 were different
from those used in the Price review [3]. As all of these data were extracted for the previously published version of our reviewk, we re-
examined this data and agree that the inclusion of the 96-hour mortality data in Berry 2011 is inappropriate and we have therefore
decided to exclude these data from our Analysis 1.2. After this revision, our pooled RR remains 1.09 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.23). As to
other studies included in this analysis, no mistakes in the use of data were found so we do not plan to make other modifications.
As described in our Abstract and Methods section, the pre-determined primary objective of our review was to assess the effects of oral
hygiene care on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation in
ICUs. The participants that we were interested in were those who received mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours and therefore
were at risk of developing VAP
. Thus, our use of the Day 3 sample data in Munro 2009j was reasonable. The same reason (pre-
determined PICO) can also explain the differences between our review and Price 2014c for the data of Panchabhai 2009l, Cabov 2010
m and Bellissimo-Rodrigues 2009n. Authors of the previous version of our reviewk obtained relevant data that met our criteria from
the original authors of those studies.

Amended
Edits to Analysis 1.2 and 4.2.
In response to the feedback, review authors decided that mortality data derived
from trial flow diagrams in Berry 2011 and Berry 2013 should not be used. This
does not change the mortality results: chlorhexidine versus placebo, RR 1.09
(95% CI 0.96 to 1.23)
Removal of Berry 2011 and 2013 mortality data also means no conclusions can
be drawn about the effecton mortality of bicarbonate rinse versus water, Listerine
versus water or Listerine versus bicarbonate (previous analyses 4.2.6, 4.2.7, 4.2.

We clarified the criteria for studies eligible to be included in this review.
• Participants in trials should not have a respiratory infection at baseline.
• The interventions to be included in this review must include an oral hygiene care component. We excluded trials where the
intervention being evaluated was a type of suction system or variation of method, timing, or place where mechanical ventilation was
introduced (e.g. emergency room or ICU).
• Minimum duration of mechanical ventilation of 48 hours, in order for the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia, either during
the period of ventilation or within 48 hours of extubation, to be considered ventilator-associated pneumonia.
• Outcome of mortality defined as either all-cause ICU mortality or, where this was not available, all-cause 30-day mortality. We
considered that the effect of the underlying condition(s) on mortality would be similar in each randomised treatment group during
this period.

 • In order to avoid duplication, we excluded trials where the intervention was selective decontamination of the digestive tract with
antibiotics, as these interventions are included in another Cochrane Review (D’Amico 2009).
• Likewise, we excluded trials where the intervention was probiotics, as these interventions are included in another Cochrane
Review (Hao 2015).
• We updated the text in the Methods section of this review about the ’Risk of bias’ assessment in line with the latest version of the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and we added more details about the process followed.
For this 2016 update:
• As the purpose of this systematic review is to determine the effects of oral hygiene care on the development of VAP in a group of
very ill patients in intensive care, we excluded studies that reported only intermediate outcomes, such as microbial colonisation or
CPIS scores, because the relationship between these outcomes and VAP or mortality is unclear.
• We dropped the outcome ’microbial colonisation’. We excluded studies that only reported this outcome, and not VAP incidence
or mortality, so an analysis of this outcome for the included studies would lead to selective reporting. Additionally, most traditional
criteria for VAP diagnosis already incorporate results of microbial colonisation laboratory tests (Waters 2015).
• We undertook a subgroup analysis for a dose-response relationship for chlorhexidine, as recent research suggests a possible
relationship between chlorhexidine dose and mortality/effectiveness in VAP reduction (Klompas 2014; Zhang 2013).
• We used the risk ratio (RR) rather than the odds ratio (OR) for the binary data, in line with current Cochrane Oral Health
policy, as this made interpretation of the results easier.
• We only searched the VIP database for Chinese studies, because the previous search strategies are no longer valid.
• We added the outcomes reported in the ’Summary of findings tables’ to the Methods section.
