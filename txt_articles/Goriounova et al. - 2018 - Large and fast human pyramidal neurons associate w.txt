Abstract It is generally assumed that human intelligence relies on efficient processing by
neurons in our brain. Although grey matter thickness and activity of temporal and frontal cortical
areas correlate with IQ scores, no direct evidence exists that links structural and physiological
properties of neurons to human intelligence. Here, we find that high IQ scores and large temporal
cortical thickness associate with larger, more complex dendrites of human pyramidal neurons. We
show in silico that larger dendritic trees enable pyramidal neurons to track activity of synaptic
inputs with higher temporal precision, due to fast action potential kinetics. Indeed, we find that
human pyramidal neurons of individuals with higher IQ scores sustain fast action potential kinetics
during repeated firing. These findings provide the first evidence that human intelligence is
associated with neuronal complexity, action potential kinetics and efficient information transfer
from inputs to output within cortical neurons.

Introduction
A fundamental question in neuroscience is what properties of neurons lie at the heart of human intel-
ligence and underlie individual differences in mental ability. Thus far, experimental research on the
neurobiological basis of intelligence has largely ignored the neuronal level and has not directly
tested what role human neurons play in cognitive ability, mainly due to the inaccessibility of human
neurons. Instead, research has either been focused on finding genetic loci that can explain part of
the variance in intelligence (Spearman’s g) in large cohorts (Lam et al., 2017; Sniekers, 2017;
Trampush et al., 2017; Coleman et al., 2018) or on identifying brain regions in whole brain imaging
studies of which structure or function correlate with IQ scores (Karama et al., 2009; Hulshoff Pol
et al., 2006; Narr et al., 2007; McDaniel, 2005; Deary et al., 2010). Some studies have highlighted
that variability in brain volume and intelligence may share a common genetic origin (Hulshoff Pol
et al., 2006; Posthuma et al., 2002; Sniekers, 2017), and individual genes that were identified as

 associated with IQ scores might aid intelligence by facilitating neuron growth (Sniekers, 2017;
Coleman et al., 2018) and directly influencing neuronal firing (Lam et al., 2017).
Intelligence is a distributed function that depends on activity of multiple brain regions
(Deary et al., 2010). Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in hundreds of
healthy subjects revealed that cortical volume and function of specific areas correlate with g
(Karama et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2008; Narr et al., 2007). In particular, areas located in the frontal
and temporal cortices show multiple correlations of grey matter thickness and functional activation
with IQ scores: individuals with high IQ show larger grey matter volume of, for instance, Brodmann
areas 21 and 38 (Choi et al., 2008; Deary et al., 2010; Karama et al., 2009; Narr et al., 2007). Cor-
tical grey matter consists for a substantial part of dendrites (Chklovskii et al., 2002; Ikari and Haya-
shi, 1981), which receive and integrate synaptic information and strongly affect functional properties
of neurons (Bekkers and Ha
¨usser, 2007; Eyal et al., 2014; Vetter et al., 2001). Especially higher
order association areas in temporal and frontal lobes in humans harbor pyramidal neurons of
extraordinary dendritic size and complexity (Elston, 2003; Mohan et al., 2015) that may constitute
variation in cortical thickness, neuronal function, and ultimately IQ. These neurons and their connec-
tions form the principal building blocks for coding, processing, and information storage in the brain
and give rise to cognition (Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001). Given their vast number in the human neo-
cortex, even the slightest change in efficiency of information transfer by neurons may translate into
large differences in mental ability. However, whether and how the activity and dendritic structure of
single human neurons support human intelligence has not been tested.
To investigate whether structural and functional properties of neurons of the human temporal cor-
tex associate with general intelligence, we collected a unique multimodal data set from 46 human
subjects containing single cell physiology (31 subjects, 129 neurons), neuronal morphology (25 sub-
jects, 72 neurons), pre-surgical MRI scans and IQ test scores (35 subjects, Figure 1, data available at
the Dryad Digital Repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.83dv5j7).
Human cortical brain tissue was removed as a part of surgical treatment for epilepsy or tumor
(Table 1). The tissue almost exclusively originated from middle temporal gyrus, approximately 4 cm
eLife digest Our brains are made up of almost 100 billion brain cells. Each of them acts like a
small chip: they collect, process and pass on information in the form of electrical signals. In brain
areas that integrate different types of information, such as frontal and temporal lobes, brain cells
have larger dendrites – long projections specialized to collect signals. Theoretical studies predict
that larger dendrites help cells to initiate electrical signals faster.
Because of difficulty in accessing human neurons, it has been unknown whether any of these
features also relate to human intelligence. Previous studies have revealed that people with a higher
IQ have a thicker outer layer (the cortex) in areas such as the frontal and temporal lobes. But does a
thicker cortex also contain cells with larger dendrites and is their role different?
To test whether smarter brains are equipped with faster and larger cells, Goriounova et al.
studied 46 people who needed surgery for brain tumors or epilepsy. Each took an IQ test before the
operation. To access the diseased tissue deep in the brain, the surgeon also removed small,
undamaged samples of temporal lobe. These samples still contained living cells and their electrical
signals were measured in the lab. The experiments showed that cells from people with a higher IQ
had larger dendrites that transported information more quickly, especially when they are very active.
Computer models were then used to understand how these findings can lead to more efficient
information transfer in human neurons.
Traditionally, research on human intelligence has focused on three main strategies: to study brain
structure and function, to find genes associated with intelligence and to study the connection
between our mind and behavior. Goriounova et al. are the first to take the single-cell perspective
and link cell properties to human intelligence. The findings could help connect these separate
approaches, and explain how genes for intelligence lead to thicker cortices and faster reaction times
in people with higher IQ.

gain access to the disease focus in deeper lying structures such as hippocampus or amygdala. In all
patients, the resected neocortical tissue was not part of the epileptic focus or tumor and displayed
no structural/functional abnormalities in preoperative MRI investigation, electrophysiological whole-
cell recordings or microscopic investigation of histochemically stained tissue (Mohan et al., 2015;
Testa-Silva et al., 2014; Testa-Silva et al., 2010; Verhoog et al., 2016; Verhoog et al., 2013). In
line with the non-pathological status of tissue, we observed no correlations of cellular parameters or
IQ scores with the subject’s disease history and age (Figure 1—figure supplements 1–2). After
resection the tissue was immediately placed in ice-cold artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (aCSF) and
within 15 min transported to the lab, sliced and maintained to enable single cell physiological
recordings and biocytin filling.
We recorded action potentials (APs) from human pyramidal neurons in superficial layers of tem-
poral cortex and digitally reconstructed their complete dendritic structures. We tested the

 hypothesis that variation in neuronal morphology can lead to functional differences in AP speed and
information transfer and explain variation in IQ scores. In addition to our experimental results, we
used computational modelling to understand underlying principles of efficient information transfer in
human cortical neurons.
Results
IQ scores positively correlate with cortical thickness of the temporal
lobe
Cortical thickness of the temporal lobe has been associated with IQ scores in hundreds of healthy
subjects (Choi et al., 2008; Deary et al., 2010; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2006;Karama et al.,
2009; Narr et al., 2007), and we first asked whether this applies to the subjects in our study as well.
From T1-weighted MRI scans obtained prior to surgery, we determined temporal cortical thickness
in 35 subjects using voxel-based morphometry of temporal cortical areas. These areas included the
surgically resected cortical tissue (Figure 2b) used for cellular recordings and neuronal reconstruc-
tions, which typically came from locations at 4 cm from temporal pole and was 1–1.5 cm in diameter
(black circle in Figure 2b). The total resected cortical area varied for each patient, but consisted of a
larger part of the temporal lobe (Figure 2b; average resected area in red, maximum in orange). The
mean distance of resection boundaries from temporal pole was 4.2 ± 1.7 cm on superior temporal
gyrus, 4.8 ± 1.5 cm on middle temporal gyrus, and 4.9 ± 1.5 cm on inferior temporal gyrus for the 46
subjects in this study. In MRI images, cortical thickness was measured in temporal lobe that included
the resection areas and corresponded to the areas identified to associate with IQ in healthy subjects
(Choi et al., 2008; Deary et al., 2010; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2006; Karama et al., 2009; Narr et al.,
2007) (Figure 2c; in red). The superior temporal gyrus was excluded from this analysis as it contains
areas for auditory, gustatory and language processing that are spared during resection. Cortical
thickness measurements were collapsed to one mean value for cortical thickness for each subject. In
line with findings in healthy subjects (Choi et al., 2008; Deary et al., 2010; Hulshoff Pol et al.,
2006; Narr et al., 2007;Karama et al., 2009) mean cortical thickness in temporal lobes positively
correlated with IQ scores of the subjects (Figure 2d).
IQ scores positively correlate with dendritic structure of temporal
cortical pyramidal neurons
Cortical association areas in temporal lobes play a key role in high-level integrative neuronal pro-
cesses and its superficial layers harbor neurons of increased neuronal complexity (DeFelipe et al.,
2002; Elston, 2003; Scholtens et al., 2014; van den Heuvel et al., 2015). In rodents, the neuropil
of cortical association areas consists for over 30% of dendritic structures (Ikari and Hayashi, 1981).
To test the hypothesis that human temporal cortical thickness is associated with dendrite size, we
used 72 full reconstructions of biocytin-labelled temporal cortical pyramidal neurons from layers 2, 3
and 4 (median number of neurons per subject = 2; average 2.8; ranging from 1 to 10) part of which
was previously reported (Mohan et al., 2015). We calculated total dendritic length (TDL) that
included all basal and apical dendrites without apparent slice artifacts for each neuron. We com-
puted TDL from multiple neurons for each subject and correlated these mean TDL values to mean
temporal cortical thickness from the same subject. We found that dendritic length positively

 correlated with mean temporal lobe cortical thickness (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.5,
explained variance R2 = 0.25), indicating that dendritic structure of individual neurons contributes to
the overall cytoarchitecture of temporal cortex (Figure 3a).
TDL is in part determined by the soma location within cortical layers: cell bodies of pyramidal
neurons with larger dendrites typically lie deeper, at larger distance from pia (Mohan et al., 2015).
To exclude a systematic bias in sampling, we determined the cortical depth of each neuron relative
to the subject’s temporal cortical thickness in the same hemisphere. There was no correlation
between IQ score and relative cortical depth of pyramidal neurons indicating that we sampled neu-
rons at similar depths across subjects (Figure 3b). Finally, we tested whether mean TDL and com-
plexity of pyramidal neurons relates to subjects’ IQ scores. We found a strong positive correlation
between individual’s pyramidal neuron TDL and IQ scores (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.51,
explained variance R2 = 0.26; Figure 3c) as well as between number of dendritic branch points and
IQ scores (r = 0.46, R2 = 0.22; Figure 3d). Thus, larger and more complex pyramidal neurons in tem-
poral association area may partly contribute to thicker cortex and link to higher intelligence.
Larger dendrites lead to faster AP onset and improved encoding
properties
Dendrites not only receive most synapses in neurons, but dendritic morphology and ionic conductan-
ces act in concert to regulate neuronal excitability (Bekkers and Ha
¨usser, 2007; Eyal et al., 2014;
Vetter et al., 2001). In model simulations where neurons are reduced to balls and sticks, increasing
the dendritic membrane surface area, that is the dendritic impedance load, speeds up the onset
phase of APs. This is a consequence of the decrease in the effective time constants of the neuron
with increasing dendritic size and dendritic impedance load (Eyal et al., 2014). Larger dendrites act
as a larger sink for currents generated in the axon initial segment during AP onset and result in faster
membrane potential changes. Furthermore, we found previously that human neocortical pyramidal
neurons, which are three times larger than rodent pyramidal neurons (Mohan et al., 2015), have
faster AP onsets compared to rodent neurons and are able to track and encode fast synaptic inputs
and sub-threshold changes in membrane potential with high temporal precision (Testa-Silva et al.,
2014). We asked whether the observed differences in TDL between human pyramidal neurons
affected their encoding properties and ability to transfer information. To this end, we incorporated
the 3-dimensional dendritic reconstructions of the 72 human pyramidal neurons into in silico models,
equipped them with excitable properties (see Materials and methods) and tested whether their APs
have faster onset. We found that TDL of model neurons with realistic dendritic trees positively corre-
lated with the steepness of AP onsets (r = 0.4, R2 = 0.16; Figure 4a,b) and larger dendrites enabled
neurons to generate faster APs.
The exact timing of action potential firing allows cortical neurons to pass on temporal information
provided by synaptic inputs (Ko
¨ndgen et al., 2008; Ilin et al., 2013; Testa-Silva et al., 2014;
Linaro et al., 2018). Single pyramidal neurons do not sustain high frequency firing and generally do
not encode high frequency synaptic input content in rate coding. Instead, the precision in timing of
AP initiation does allow these neurons to encode incoming high frequency information in their out-
put. In contrast to rodent neurons, human neurons can encode sub-threshold membrane potential
changes on a sub-millisecond timescale by timing of APs (Testa-Silva et al., 2014). This synaptic
input tracking capacity strongly relies on the rapidity of AP onset (Ilin et al., 2013). Faster APs allow
neurons to respond to fast synaptic inputs, which will be missed if AP generation is too slow.
Thereby, neurons with faster APs can translate higher frequencies of synaptic membrane potential
fluctuations into AP timing and ultimately encode more information.

 The aforementioned theoretical work (Eyal et al., 2014) using ‘ball-and-stick’ neuron models
showed that neurons with larger dendritic compartments not only have faster AP onset rapidity, but
could also time AP generation to faster changes in membrane potentials, increasing the frequency
tracking capabilities of input modulations, and augmenting the input frequency bandwidth of infor-
mation encoding about three times. However, it is not known whether the same effect holds true for
the human cortical pyramidal neurons we recorded from, and whether the range of dendritic com-
partment sizes we examined might lead to significant quantitative biophysical differences. We tested
this by simulating sinusoidal current inputs of increasing frequencies into in silico representations of

 the neurons we recorded and reconstructed, and studied how the timing of AP firing of these neu-
rons followed sub-threshold membrane potential changes. We find that human neurons with larger
TDL can reliably time their APs to faster membrane potential changes, with cut-off frequencies up to
400–500 Hz, while smaller neurons had their cut-off frequencies already at 200 Hz (Figure 4c,d). Fur-
thermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the dendritic length and the cut-off
frequency (Figure 4d). Finally, given the same input - composed of the sum of three sinusoids of
increasing frequencies - larger neurons were able to better encode rapidly changing temporal infor-
mation into timing of AP firing, compared to smaller neurons (Figure 4e). Thus, we find that differ-
ences in dendritic length of human neurons lead to faster APs and thereby to wider frequency
bandwidths of encoding synaptic inputs into timing of AP output.
Higher IQ scores associate with faster APs
Since cortical pyramidal neurons with large dendrites have faster APs and can encode more informa-
tion in AP output, and since large dendrites also associate with higher IQ scores, we next asked
whether human cortical pyramidal neurons from individuals with higher IQ scores generate faster
APs. To test this, we made whole-cell recordings from pyramidal cells in acute slices of temporal cor-
tex (31 subjects, 129 neurons, median number of neurons per subject = 3; ranging from 1 to 11 Fig-
ure 5) and recorded APs at different firing frequencies in response to depolarizing current steps. We
determined AP maximum rise speed, which is highly correlated with AP onset rapidity (r = 0.79
p=4.29e-14, n = 60, data not shown), and can more reliably be determined from recordings with
sampling frequencies between 10 and 50 kHz. Maximum rise speed of APs depended on the firing
history of the cell, with the first AP in the train having the highest AP rise speed and slowing down

data into two groups based on IQ score – above and below 100. Although the AP rise speed of the
first AP was not different between high and low IQ groups (Figure 5c), the AP slowed down stron-
ger in individuals with lower IQ scores compared to APs of individuals with higher IQ scores
(Figure 5d). At higher instantaneous firing frequencies (20–40 Hz), the AP rise speed was higher in
individuals with IQ scores above 100 (Figure 5c right; AP rise speed high IQ = 338.4 ± 26.03 mV/ms;
AP rise speed low IQ = 268.1 ± 12.20 mV/ms, t-test p=0.0113). We next calculated the slowing of
APs with increasing instantaneous frequency by normalizing rise speed of APs to the rise speed of
the first AP in the train. Relative to first AP, rise speed at 20–40 Hz showed significant slowing in sub-
jects with lower IQ scores and decreased to 74% of the initial AP rise speed. In contrast, in neurons
from individuals with higher IQ scores, AP rise speed remained on average at 84% (Figure 5d right,
high IQ = 0.84 ± 0.014; low IQ = 0.74 ± 0.024, t-test p value=0.037).
We further investigated whether these differences at the group level reflected correlations
between individual IQ scores and AP rise speeds. We correlated mean AP rise speeds both of the
first AP and AP at 20–40 Hz from all neurons of the same subject to the subject’s IQ score. The AP
rise speed of the first AP in the train positively correlated with IQ scores (r = 0.41, R2 = 0.17;
Figure 5e), and this correlation was even stronger for AP rise speeds at instantaneous frequencies of
20–40 Hz (r = 0.46, R2 = 0.21; Figure 5f). Importantly, also relative AP values showed significant pos-
itive correlations with IQ, indicating that it is the relative slowing of APs at high frequencies that
associates with intelligence (r = 0.37, R2 = 0.14; Figure 5g). Finally, we asked whether the slowing of
APs relates to the dendritic size of the same neurons, as our model results suggest. We find that
larger neurons show less slowing of AP rise speed (higher relative AP speeds) at 20–40 Hz (r = 0.55,
R2 = 0.30; Figure 5h). These findings reveal that higher IQ scores are accompanied by faster APs
during repeated AP firing, while lower IQ scores associate with increased AP fatigue during elevated
neuronal activity. Thus, neurons from individuals with higher IQ scores are better equipped to pro-
cess synaptic signals at high rates and at faster time scales, which is necessary to encode large
amounts of information accurately and efficiently.
Discussion
Our findings provide a first insight into the possible cellular nature of human intelligence and explain
individual variation in IQ scores based on neuronal properties: faster AP rise speed during neuronal
activity and more complex, extended dendrites associate with higher intelligence. AP kinetics have

 profound consequences for information processing. In vivo, neurons are constantly bombarded by
high frequency synaptic inputs and the capacity of neurons to keep track and phase-lock to these
inputs determines how much of this synaptic information can be passed on to other neurons (Testa-
Silva et al., 2014). The brain operates at a millisecond time-scale and even sub-millisecond details
of spike trains contain behaviorally relevant information that can steer behavioral responses
(Nemenman et al., 2008). Indeed, one of the most robust and replicable findings in behavioral psy-
chology is the association of intelligence scores with measures of cognitive information-processing
speed (Barrett et al., 1986). Specifically, reaction times (RT) in simple RT tasks provide a better pre-
diction of IQ than other speed-of-processing tests, with a regression coefficient of 0.447 (Ver-
non, 1983). In addition, high positive correlations between RT and other speed-of-processing tests
suggest the existence of a common mental speed factor (Vernon, 1983). Recently, these classic find-
ings were confirmed in a large longitudinal population-based study counting more than 2000 partici-
pants (Der and Deary, 2017). Especially strong correlations between RT and general intelligence
were reported for a slightly more complex 4-choice (Der and Deary, 2017). Our results provide a
biological cellular explanation for such mental speed factors: in conditions of increased mental activ-
ity or more demanding cognitive task, neurons of individuals with higher IQ are able to sustain fast
action potentials and can transfer more information content from synaptic input to AP output.
Pyramidal cells are integrators and accumulators of synaptic information. Larger dendrites can
physically contain more synaptic contacts and integrate more information. Indeed, human pyramidal
neuron dendrites receive twice as many synapses as in rodents (DeFelipe et al., 2002) and cortico-
cortical whole-brain connectivity positively correlates with the size of dendrites in these cells
(Scholtens et al., 2014; van den Heuvel et al., 2015). In this and a previous study (Mohan et al.,
2015), we find almost 2-fold larger dendritic arbor size (mean TDL = 14.67 ± 4 mm) and number of
dendritic branches (64.03 ± 17.7) compared to reports that use post-mortem tissue (Jacobs et al.,
2001; Bianchi et al., 2013; Elston et al., 2001). The differences could be explained by a number of
advantages of biocytin filled neurons in surgical resections compared to traditionally used Golgi
stainings in human post-mortem tissue. The cortical slices in our study are thicker (350 mm compared
to 120–250 mm) and contain neurons with almost completely intact apical and basal dendrites, while
other studies use only basal dendrites for quantification (Jacobs et al., 2001). Furthermore, only a
small number of neurons are filled in a slice, which allows to unambiguously quantify all dendrites
from individual cells. Importantly, the tissue comes from a living donor compared to post-mortem
tissue collection, and thus does not suffer from post-mortem delays (de Ruiter, 1983) and only still
living functional cells are filled. At the same time, post-mortem studies make it possible to make
comparative analysis of several cortical areas. A gradient in complexity of pyramidal cells in cortical
superficial layers accompanies the increasing integration capacity of cortical areas, indicating that
larger dendrites are required for higher-order cortical processing (Elston et al., 2001; Jacobs et al.,
2001; van den Heuvel et al., 2015). Our results align well with these findings, suggesting that the
neuronal complexity gradient also exists from individual to individual and could explain differences
in mental ability.
Within human cortex, association areas contain neurons with larger and more complex dendrites
than primary sensory areas, while neuronal cell body density is lower in cortical association areas
compared to primary sensory areas (Elston, 2003; DeFelipe et al., 2002). Larger neurons are not as
tightly packed together within cortical space as smaller cells. A recent study by Genc
¸ et al., 2018
used multi-shell diffusion tensor imaging to estimate parieto-frontal cortical dendritic density and

 found that higher IQ scores correlated with lower values of dendritic density (Genc
¸ et al., 2018).
This may indicate that parieto-frontal cortical areas in individuals with higher IQ scores have less
densely packed neurons, and may suggest that these neurons are larger. In our study, we carefully
determined the amount and complexity of dendrite for each neuron, a computational unit within the
cortex with well-defined input-output signals. Taking the results of Genc
¸ et al., 2018 and our study
together may suggest that the neuronal circuitry associated with higher intelligence is organized in a
sparse and efficient manner, where larger and more complex pyramidal cells occupy larger cortical
volume.
Larger dendrites have an impact on excitability of cells (Bekkers and Ha
¨usser, 2007;
Vetter et al., 2001) and determine the shape and rapidity of APs (Eyal et al., 2014). Increasing the
size of dendritic compartments in silico lead to acceleration of AP onset and increased encoding
capability of neurons (Eyal et al., 2014). Both in models and in slice recordings, changes of AP initia-
tion dynamics were shown to fundamentally modify encoding of fast changing signals and the speed
of communication between ensembles of cortical neurons (Eyal et al., 2014; Ilin et al., 2013). Neu-
rons with fast AP onsets can encode high frequencies and respond quickly to subtle input changes.
This ability can be impaired and response speed is decreased when AP onsets are slowed down by
experimental manipulations (Ilin et al., 2013). Our results not only demonstrate that AP speed
depends on dendritic length and influences information transfer, but also show that both dendritic
length and AP speed in human neurons correlate with intelligence. Thus, individuals with larger den-
drites are better equipped to transfer synaptic information at higher frequencies.
Remarkably, dendritic morphology and different parameters of AP waveform are also parameters
that we have previously identified as showing pronounced differences between humans and other
species (Mohan et al., 2015; Testa-Silva et al., 2014). Human pyramidal cells in layers 2 and 3 have
3-fold larger and more complex dendrites than in macaque or mouse (Mohan et al., 2015). More-
over, human APs have lower firing threshold and faster AP onset kinetics both in single APs and dur-
ing repeated firing (Testa-Silva et al., 2014). These differences across species may suggest
evolutionary pressure on both dendritic structure and AP waveform and emphasize specific adapta-
tions of human pyramidal cells in association areas for cognitive functions.
Our results were obtained from patients undergoing neurosurgical procedure and, thus, may
potentially raise questions on how representative our findings are for normal healthy human subjects.
Although no healthy controls can be used for single cell measurements, we addressed this issue in
the following way. Firstly, in all patients, the resected neocortical tissue was not part of epileptic
focus or tumor and displayed no structural or functional abnormalities in preoperative MRI, electro-
physiological recordings or microscopic investigation of stained tissue. Secondly, none of the param-
eters correlated with age at epilepsy onset, seizure frequency, age or disease duration (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1). Thirdly, IQ, dendritic length or AP rise speed were not different across differ-
ent patient groups (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Finally, the cortical thickness correlation with
general intelligence we observe in our study was also reported in hundreds of healthy subjects.
Taken together, these results indicate that our findings are not likely to be influenced by disease
background of the subjects.
In this study, intelligence was measured using WAIS IQ score, that combines results of 11 individ-
ual subtests of cognitive functioning into a single full-scale IQ score (Wechsler, 2008; Taylor and
Heaton, 2001). This inevitably simplifies and reduces a multi-dimensional human trait to a single
number. Although none of the intelligence tests can capture all aspects of human intelligence, IQ
tests have proven their validity and relevance. The results of different cognitive subtests are highly
correlated and generate a strong general factor – general intelligence or Spearman’s g (Spear-
man, 1904). Spearman’s g, calculated based on subtests of WAIS and expressed in total full-scale
IQ score, strongly correlates with highly relevant life outcomes, including education, occupation, and
income (Strenze, 2007; Foverskov et al., 2017). Moreover, intelligence is a stable trait over time in
the same individual: the results of intelligence tests at the age of 11 predict the scores at the age of
90 (Gow et al., 2011; Deary et al., 2013). Thus, despite its shortcomings, full scale IQ score pro-
vides a relevant and meaningful estimation of general intelligence that lies at the core of
cognitive differences between individuals.
In conclusion, our results provide first evidence that already at the level of individual neurons,
such parameters as dendritic size and ability to maintain fast responses link to general mental ability.

 parameters may lead to large differences in encoding capabilities and information transfer in cortical
networks and result in a speed advantage in mental processing and, finally, in faster reaction times
and higher cognitive ability.
Materials and methods
Human subjects and brain tissue
All procedures were performed with the approval of the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU Uni-
versity Medical Centre, and in accordance with Dutch license procedures and the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. Written informed consent was provided by all subjects for data and tissue use for scientific
research. All data were anonymized.
Human cortical brain tissue was removed as a part of surgical treatment of the subject in order to
get access to a disease focus in deeper brain structures (hippocampus or amygdala) and typically
originated from gyrus temporalis medium (Brodmann area 21). Speech areas were avoided during
resection surgery through functional mapping. We obtained neocortical tissue from 46 patients (24
females, 22 males; age range 18–66 years, Table 1) treated for mesial temporal sclerosis, removal of
a hippocampal tumor, low grade hippocampal lesion, cavernoma or another unspecified temporal
lobe pathology. From 35 of these patients, we also obtained pre-surgical MRI scans, from 31
patients we recorded Action Potentials from 129 neurons and from 25 patients we had fully recon-
structed dendritic morphologies from 72 neurons.
In all patients, the resected neocortical tissue was not part of epileptic focus or tumor and dis-
played no structural/functional abnormalities in preoperative MRI investigation, electrophysiological
whole-cell recordings or microscopic investigation of stained tissue. The physiological recordings,
subsequent morphological reconstructions, morphological and action potential analysis were per-
formed blind to the IQ of the patients.
IQ scores
Total IQ scores were obtained from all 46 subjects using the Dutch version of Wechsler Adult Intelli-
gence Scale-III (WAIS-III) (Taylor and Heaton, 2001) and in some cases WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008)
and consisted of following subtests: information, similarities, vocabulary, comprehension, block
design, matrix reasoning, visual puzzles, picture comprehension, figure weights, digit span, arithme-
tic, symbol search and coding.
The tests were performed as a part of neuropsychological examination shortly before surgery,
typically within one week.
MRI data and cortical thickness estimation
T1-weighted brain images (1 mm thickness) were acquired with a 3T MR system (Signa HDXt, Gen-
eral Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) as a part of pre-surgical assessment (number of slices = 170–
180). Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed with the Freesurfer image
analysis suite (http://freesurfer.net) (Fischl and Dale, 2000). The processing included motion correc-
tion and transformation to the Talairach frame. Calculation of the cortical thickness was done as the
closest distance from the grey/white boundary to the grey/CSF boundary at each vertex and was
based both on intensity and continuity information from the entire three-dimensional MR volume
(Fischl and Dale, 2000). Neuroanatomical labels were automatically assigned to brain areas based
on Destrieux cortical atlas parcellation as described in (Fischl et al., 2004). For averaging, the
regions in temporal lobes were selected based on Destrieux cortical atlas parcellation in each
subject.
Slice preparation
Upon surgical resection, the cortical tissue block was immediately transferred to ice-cold artificial
cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) containing in (mM): 110 choline chloride, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose,
11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgCl2, 3.1 sodium pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 0.5 CaCl2 (300
mOsm) and transported to the neurophysiology laboratory (within 500 m from the operating room).
The transition time between resection of the tissue and the start of preparing slices was less than 15
min. After removing the pia and identifying the pia-white matter axis, neocortical slices (350 mm

 thickness) were prepared in ice-cold slicing solution (same composition as described above). Slices
were then transferred to holding chambers in which they were stored for 30 min at 34 ˚C and for 30
min at room temperature before recording in aCSF, which contained (in mM): 125 NaCl; 3 KCl; 1.2
NaH2PO4; 1 MgSO4; 2 CaCl2; 26 NaHCO3; 10 D-glucose (300 mOsm), bubbled with carbogen gas
(95% O2/5% CO2), as described previously (Mohan et al., 2015; Testa-Silva et al., 2014; Testa-
Silva et al., 2010; Verhoog et al., 2013; Verhoog et al., 2016).
Electrophysiological recordings
Cortical slices were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) microscopy.
After the whole cell configuration was established, membrane potential responses to steps of cur-
rent injection (step size 30–50 pA) were recorded. None of the neurons showed spontaneous epilep-

activity.

(Axon
Instruments) sampling at frequencies of 10 to 50 kHz, and lowpass filtered at 10 to 30 kHz. Record-
ings were digitized by pClamp software (Axon) and later analyzed off-line using custom-written Mat-
lab scripts (MathWorks). Patch pipettes (3–5 MOhms) were pulled from standard-wall borosilicate
capillaries and filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 110 K-gluconate; 10 KCl; 10
HEPES; 10 K-phosphocreatine; 4 ATP-Mg; 0.4 GTP, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH; 285–290 mOsm,
0.5 mg/ml biocytin. All experiments were performed at 32–35 ˚C. Only cells with bridge balance
of <20 MOhm were used for further analysis.
Morphological analysis
During electrophysiological recordings, cells were loaded with biocytin through the recording
pipette. After the recordings the slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and the recorded cells
were revealed with the chromogen 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tetrahydrochloride using the avidin–
biotin–peroxidase method (Horikawa and Armstrong, 1988). Slices (350 mm thick) were mounted
on slides and embedded in mowiol (Clariant GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Neurons without
apparent slicing artifacts and uniform biocytin signal were digitally reconstructed using Neurolucida
software (Microbrightfield, Williston, VT, USA), using a � 100 oil objective. After reconstruction,
morphologies were checked for accurate reconstruction in x/y/z planes, dendritic diameter, and con-
tinuity of dendrites. Finally, reconstructions were checked using an overlay in Adobe Illustrator
between the Neurolucida reconstruction and Z-stack projection image from Surveyor Software
(Chromaphor, Oberhausen, Germany). Only neurons with virtually complete dendritic structures
were included; cells with major truncations due to slicing procedure were excluded.
Superficial layers pyramidal neurons were identified based on morphological and electrophysio-
logical criteria at cortical depth within 400–1400 mm from cortical surface, that we previously found
to correspond to cortical layers 2, 3 and 4 in humans (Mohan et al., 2015). For each neuron, we
extracted total dendritic length (TDL) of all basal and apical dendrites and number of branch points
and computed average TDL and average number of branch points for each subject by pooling data
from all cells within one subject (1 to 10 neurons per subject). Only neurons without major trunca-

NEURON modelling
Following previous work (Eyal et al., 2014; Eyal et al., 2016) conductance-based multicompartmen-
tal ‘Hodgkin and Huxley models’ (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952) of each of the reconstructed human
pyramidal cells were built. To each model, a cylindrical axon (1 mm in diameter) was connected to
the soma, consisting of a 50 mm long Axon Initial Segment (AIS) and a 1 mm long myelinated part.
The AIS consisted of 25 electrical compartments, the rest of the axon of 21 compartments. Simula-
tions were run with the open-source software simulator NEURON v.7.5 (Carnevale and Hines, 2006)
(https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron), with dt = 10 ms integration time step at 37 ˚C. All compartments
incorporated passive membrane properties, with specific capacitance Cm = 0.75 mF/cm2, axial resis-
tance Ra = 0.1 MOhm/cm, specific resistance Rm = 30.3 MOhm/cm2, and leak-currents with reversal
potential E = �70 mV. In the myelinated part of the axon Cm was decreased 37.5 times and Rm was
increased 5 times. Across all dendritic compartments, Cm was increased by 84% and Rm was
decreased by the same amount to account for dendritic spines (Sarid et al., 2007; Benavides-

 Piccione et al., 2002). Active membrane properties consisted of voltage-dependent fast-inactivating
sodium (Na+) and delayed-rectifier potassium (K+) ionic conductances, taken from the SenseLab
ModelDB database (McDougal et al., 2017) (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb) and set to:
gNa = 0 pS/mm2, gK = 0 pS/mm2 in the myelinated axon, gNa = 8000 pS/mm2 and gK = 1500 pS/mm2
in AIS, gNa = 800 pS/mm2 , gK = 320 pS/mm2 in the soma, and gNa = 20 pS/mm2 and gK = 10 pS/mm2
for dendrites. Reversal potentials for Na+ and K+ currents were +50 mV and �85 mV, respectively.
Resulting input resistances were 61.5±4.73 MOhm and resting potentials were �70.5±0.02 mV.
Onset rapidity of simulated action potentials (APs) was calculated as the slope of membrane poten-
tials V(t) in the phase plane (i.e. V(t) vs dV/dt) at 10 mV/ms and averaged across APs in simulated
trains.
The dynamical input-output ‘transfer gain’ (Linaro et al., 2018; Ko
¨ndgen et al., 2008; Testa-
Silva et al., 2014) was determined by injecting sinusoidally oscillating input currents for 120 s at the
soma, with amplitude I1, frequency F (1–1’000 cycle/s), a DC baseline I0 amplitude, and randomly

Action Potential waveform analysis of electrophysiological recordings
Action Potential (AP) waveforms were extracted from voltage traces recorded in response to intra-
cellular current injections and sorted according to their instantaneous firing frequency. Instantaneous
frequency was determined as 1/time to previous AP. Subsequently all APs were binned in 10 Hz
bins, while the first APs in each trace were isolated in a separate bin.
AP rise speed was defined as the peak of AP derivative (dV/dt). For each analyzed cell, represen-
tative APs with all parameters were plotted for visual check to avoid errors in the analysis.
For each neuron, the mean values of AP rise speed in a given frequency bin were obtained by
averaging all APs within that frequency bin. Relative AP rise speeds were calculated by dividing the
mean AP rise speed in each frequency bin (1–10 Hz, 11–20 Hz, 21–30 Hz and 31 to 40 Hz) by the
mean first AP rise speed (first APs in the train of APs).
To obtain AP values for each subject, AP parameters within each frequency bin were averaged
for all neurons from one subject. All AP analysis was performed using customized Matlab scripts

 Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of all correlations between parameters was determined using Pearson correla-
tion and linear regression (using Matlab, version R2017a, Mathworks). As multiple cells were mea-
sured per subject, correlations were calculated on mean parameter values per subject. All Pearson
correlation coefficients and p values for correlations are shown in figure insets, R2 coefficients and
sample sizes are shown in figure legends and main text.
For statistical analysis of AP data, we divided all subjects according to their IQ into two groups:
group with IQ > 100 and a group with IQ < 100. Differences between 2 IQ groups in AP rise times
were statistically tested using Student t-test. For analysis of different patient groups (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplements 2) an ANOVA test was applied for each parameter separately.
