BACKGROUND
The comparative effectiveness of treatments for prostate cancer that is detected by 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing remains uncertain.
METHODS
We compared active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, and external-beam radiother-
apy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. Between 1999 and 2009, 
a total of 82,429 men 50 to 69 years of age received a PSA test; 2664 received a diag-
nosis of localized prostate cancer, and 1643 agreed to undergo randomization to active 
monitoring (545 men), surgery (553), or radiotherapy (545). The primary outcome was 
prostate-cancer mortality at a median of 10 years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes 
included the rates of disease progression, metastases, and all-cause deaths.
RESULTS
There were 17 prostate-cancer–specific deaths overall: 8 in the active-monitoring 
group (1.5 deaths per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 3.0), 
5 in the surgery group (0.9 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.2), and 4 in 
the radiotherapy group (0.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.0); the differ-
ence among the groups was not significant (P 
= 
0.48 for the overall comparison). 
In addition, no significant difference was seen among the groups in the number 
of deaths from any cause (169 deaths overall; P 
= 
0.87 for the comparison among 
the three groups). Metastases developed in more men in the active-monitoring group 
(33 men; 6.3 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 4.5 to 8.8) than in the surgery 
group (13 men; 2.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.2) or the radiotherapy 
group (16 men; 3.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.9) (P 
= 
0.004 for the 
overall comparison). Higher rates of disease progression were seen in the active-
monitoring group (112 men; 22.9 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 19.0 to 27.5) 
than in the surgery group (46 men; 8.9 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 6.7 to 
11.9) or the radiotherapy group (46 men; 9.0 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 
6.7 to 12.0) (P<0.001 for the overall comparison).
CONCLUSIONS
At a median of 10 years, prostate-cancer–specific mortality was low irrespective of 
the treatment assigned, with no significant difference among treatments. Surgery 
and radiotherapy were associated with lower incidences of disease progression and 
metastases than was active monitoring. (Funded by the National Institute for Health

T
he management of clinically lo-
calized prostate cancer that is detected on 
the basis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
levels remains controversial. In the United States 
alone, an estimated 180,890 cases will be diag-
nosed in 2016, and 26,120 men will die from the 
disease.1 The widespread use of PSA testing has 
resulted in a dramatic increase in the diagnosis 
and treatment of prostate cancer, but many men 
do not benefit from intervention because the dis-
ease is either indolent or disseminated at diag-
nosis. Prostate cancer often progresses slowly, 
and many men die of competing causes. In addi-
tion, interventions for prostate cancer can have 
adverse effects on sexual, urinary, or bowel func-
tion. Two treatment trials have evaluated the ef-
fectiveness of treatment, but they did not com-
pare the most common contemporary methods: 
surgery, radiotherapy, and monitoring or surveil-
lance.2-4
The National Institute for Health Research–
supported Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treat-
ment (ProtecT) trial recruited men 50 to 69 years 
of age in the United Kingdom. From 1999 to 
2009, a total of 82,429 men had a PSA test; 2664 
received a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer 
(including 146 men from the feasibility study), 
and 1643 agreed to undergo randomization to 
active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, or radio-
therapy. Here we report the effectiveness of each 
intervention in relation to prostate-cancer–spe-
cific mortality and all-cause mortality and the 
incidence of metastases and disease progression 
at a median of 10 years of follow-up in the ran-
domized trial. In a companion article, we report 
complete patient-reported outcomes in the ran-
domized cohort at 6 years of follow-up.5
Methods
Participants
A total of 545 men were randomly assigned to 
active monitoring, 553 to radical prostatectomy, 
and 545 to radiotherapy. The median age of the 
participants was 62 years (range, 50 to 69), the 
median PSA level at the prostate-check clinic 
was 4.6 ng per milliliter (range, 3.0 to 19.9), 77% 
had tumors with a Gleason score of 6 (on a scale 
from 6 to 10, with higher scores indicating a 
worse prognosis), and 76% had stage T1c disease; 
there were no meaningful differences at baseline 
among the three randomized groups.6 Informa-
tion on baseline demographic and clinical charac-
teristics according to assigned treatment group is 
provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Oversight
Details of the screening, randomization, and 
follow-up of patients in the ProtecT trial were 
published previously6 and are shown in Figure 1. 
Approval for the trial was obtained from the 
U.K. East Midlands (formerly Trent) Multicenter 
Research Ethics Committee (01/4/025). The trial 
was overseen by an independent trial steering 
committee and a separate data and safety moni-
toring committee. All the participants provided 
written informed consent. The authors vouch for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, avail-
able at NEJM.org.
Randomization
Treatment options were discussed with the men, 
and 1643 men (62% of the eligible participants) 
agreed to undergo randomization. Treatment as-
signments were stratified according to site, with 
stochastic minimization to improve the balance 
across the groups with respect to age, Gleason 
score (<7, 7, or 8 to 10 points), and the mean of 
the baseline and first biopsy PSA test results 
together (<6.0, 6.0 to 9.9, or >9.9 ng per millili-
ter). After randomization, clinicians and partici-
pants were aware of the group assignments.
Treatment Procedures and Clinical 
Management
Clinical management was standardized with the 
use of trial-group–specific pathways. The pur-
pose of active monitoring was to minimize the 
risk of overtreatment by avoiding immediate 
radical intervention and by monitoring disease 
progression regularly, so that radical treatment 
with curative intent could be given as necessary. 
Triggers to reassess patients and consider a change 
in clinical management were based largely on 
changes in PSA levels. This was very different 
from “watchful waiting” in the Scandinavian 
Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) 
and in the U.S. Prostate Cancer Intervention 
versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), which had no 
planned protocol for curative radical interven-
tion on disease progression.2,4 Serum PSA levels

10-Year Outcomes in Localized Prostate Cancer
were measured every 3 months in the first year 
and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Changes in 
PSA levels were assessed. An increase of at least 
50% during the previous 12 months triggered a 
review. Management options included continued 
monitoring or further tests and radical or pallia-
tive treatments as required.
The radiotherapy protocol included neoadju-
vant androgen-deprivation therapy for 3 to 6 
months before and concomitantly with three-
dimensional conformal radiotherapy delivered at 
a total dose of 74 Gy in 37 fractions. The proto-
col for quality assurance followed the RT01 trial 
procedures.7-9 The trial oncologist held a review 
appointment with participants if PSA levels rose 
by at least 2.0 ng per milliliter above the nadir 
or if concerns were raised about progression. 
Management options included continued moni-
toring, additional testing, salvage therapy, or pal-
liative treatments.
In men assigned to surgery, postoperative PSA 
levels were measured every 3 months for the 
first year, every 6 months for 2 years, and yearly 
thereafter. Adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy was 
discussed with patients who had positive surgi-
cal margins, extracapsular disease, or a postop-
erative PSA level of 0.2 ng per milliliter or higher. 
In all groups, androgen-deprivation therapy was 
offered when PSA levels reached 20 ng per milli-
liter or less, if indicated. Imaging of the skeleton 
was recommended if the PSA level reached 10 ng 
per milliliter.
Clinical Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was prostate-
cancer mortality at a median of 10 years of fol-
low-up, with prostate-cancer–related deaths de-
fined as deaths that were definitely or probably 
due to prostate cancer or its treatment. The pro-
cess for ascertaining cause of death was adapted 
from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian 
(PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and the European 
Figure 1. Randomization, Treatment, and Follow-up.
A total of 88% of the men assigned to active monitoring, 71% of the men assigned to surgery, and 74% of men as-
signed to radiotherapy received the assigned treatment within 9 months after randomization. A total of 14 patients 
were lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes, but data on deaths were captured for all participants.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate 
Cancer (ERSPC).10-12 The independent cause-of-
death evaluation committee, whose members 
were unaware of the treatment assignments, 
reviewed summaries of anonymized records. 
Deaths were categorized as definitely, probably, 
possibly, probably not, or definitely not due to 
prostate cancer.13,14
Secondary outcomes included all-cause mor-
tality and the rates of metastases, clinical progres-
sion, primary treatment failure, and treatment 
complications. Metastatic disease was defined as 
bony, visceral, or lymph-node metastases on im-
aging or PSA levels above 100 ng per milliliter. 
Patients were considered to have clinical progres-
sion if they had any of the following: evidence of 
metastases, diagnosis of clinical T3 or T4 dis-
ease, long-term androgen-deprivation therapy, 
ureteric obstruction, rectal fistula, or the need 
for a urinary catheter owing to local tumor 
growth. Primary treatment failure after surgery 
was defined as a PSA level of 0.2 ng per milliliter 
or higher at 3 months after surgery, and primary 
treatment failure after radiotherapy was defined 
according to the Phoenix Consensus Conference 
recommendations.15
Although some events of clinical progression 
such as metastases could be reported uniformly, 
manifestations of local progression could differ 
between men receiving radical treatment and 
those receiving active monitoring because of dif-
ferences in treatment assignments. After surgery, 
the serious intervention-related complications that 
were recorded were death, transfusion of more 
than 3 units of blood, thromboembolic or cardio-
vascular events, rectal injury, and anastomotic 
problems requiring intervention. After radiother-
apy, the complications that were recorded were 
death and any treatment-related toxic effect re-
sulting in major surgical intervention. Interven-
tion-related complications within 90 days after 
the completion of treatment were recorded.
Statistical Analysis
A prespecified statistical analysis plan was de-
veloped before the data for the primary analysis 
were accessed16 (see the Supplementary Appendix). 
The primary outcome of prostate-cancer mortal-
ity (the rate of death due to prostate cancer or its 
treatment) was compared among the three as-
signed treatment groups on an intention-to-treat 
basis with the use of Cox proportional-hazards 
regression adjusted for trial center, age at base-
line, Gleason score, and PSA level at baseline 
(log-transformed). The results of an alternative 
cumulative-incidence approach with competing 
risks regression are shown in Figures S1 and S2 
and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
Prostate-cancer–specific mortality is reported with 
95% confidence intervals for each treatment group, 
and pairwise significance tests were planned if a 
test of the null hypothesis of no difference in 
10-year disease-specific risk of death across all 
three groups yielded a P value of less than 0.05. 
This conditional approach was designed to keep 
the overall false positive rate at 5%.17 The pri-
mary analysis approach was adapted as neces-
sary for secondary outcomes. Four prespecified 
subgroup analyses were conducted with the use 
of relevant interaction terms: age, clinical stage, 
Gleason score, and PSA level. All analyses were 
conducted with the use of Stata software, ver-
sion 14.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Adherence to Assigned Treatment  
and Primary Treatment Failure
Of the 1643 men who underwent randomization 
(Fig. 1), 14 (1%) were lost to follow-up for sec-
ondary outcomes during the 10-year follow-up 
period, but data on deaths were captured for all 
participants. A total of 482 of the 545 men as-
signed to active monitoring (88%), 391 of the 553 
men assigned to surgery (71%), and 405 of the 
545 men assigned to radiotherapy (74%) received 
the assigned treatment within 9 months after 
randomization.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative probability of 
receiving radical treatment. By the end of our 
reported follow-up, more than 85% of the men 
assigned to radiotherapy or surgery had received 
a radical intervention. Of the 545 men assigned 
to active monitoring, 291 had received a radical 
treatment by the end of November 2015 (Kaplan–
Meier estimate, 54.8%; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 50.4 to 59.3). Of those 291 men, 142 (49%) 
underwent surgery (37 within 9 months after as-
signment to the active-monitoring group), 97 (33%) 
received per-protocol radiotherapy (17 within 
 
9 months after group assignment), and 22 (8%) 
received brachytherapy (2 within 9 months after 
group assignment); in addition, 27 (9%) received 
nonprotocol radiotherapy, and 3 (1%) received

10-Year Outcomes in Localized Prostate Cancer
high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy, all 
beyond 9 months after group assignment.
Of the 391 men who underwent prostatecto-
my, 18 had primary treatment failure. Of those, 
9 (2%) had a PSA level of 0.2 ng per milliliter or 
higher between 31 and 183 days after surgery; 
 
5 received salvage radiotherapy and 1 long-term 
androgen-deprivation therapy within a year after 
surgery. An additional 9 men received adjuvant 
radiotherapy within a year after surgery, because 
of pathologic extracapsular (pT3) disease (8 men) 
or positive surgical margins (7 men). Stage pT3 
disease was present in 114 of the 391 men (29%), 
and 93 (24%) had a positive surgical margin. 
Four of the 280 patients who underwent lymph-
adenectomy (1%) had lymph-node involvement. 
Of the 405 men who started radiotherapy within 
9 months after treatment assignment, 55 (14%) 
had an increase in the PSA level of 2 ng per mil-
liliter or more above the nadir after radiotherapy, 
of whom 3 underwent salvage prostatectomy, 
14 received long-term androgen-deprivation ther-
apy, and 1 received high-intensity focused ultra-
sound therapy.
Prostate-Cancer–Specific and All-Cause 
Mortality
The independent cause-of-death evaluation com-
mittee ascertained seven definite and one prob-
able prostate-cancer–specific deaths in the ac-
tive-monitoring group, three definite and two 
probable prostate-cancer deaths in the surgery 
group, and four definite prostate-cancer deaths 
in the radiotherapy group (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). 
Prostate-cancer–specific survival was at least 
98.8% in all groups, and there was no significant 
difference among the three randomized groups 
(P 
= 
0.48 by log-rank test). Hazard ratios for 
prostate-cancer–specific death were as follows: 
0.51 (95% CI, 0.15 to 1.69) for the comparison of 
the radiotherapy group with the active-monitor-
ing group; 0.80 (95% CI, 0.22 to 2.99) for the 
comparison of the radiotherapy group with the 
surgery group; and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.93) 
for the comparison of the surgery group with 
the active-monitoring group. There was no evi-
dence that between-group differences in prostate-
cancer mortality varied according to age, PSA 
level, Gleason score, or clinical stage (Table 2). 
Deaths from any cause were evenly distributed 
across the treatment groups (P 
= 
0.87 by likelihood-
ratio test) (Table 1, and Table S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix), although the confidence 
intervals for the hazard ratios were wide and so 
did not provide strong evidence of equivalence 
across the groups (Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Details of the men who died of 
prostate cancer are provided in Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Disease Progression
A total of 204 men had disease progression, in-
cluding metastases (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). The 
incidence was higher in the active-monitoring 
group than in the surgery and radiotherapy groups 
(112 men in the active-monitoring group, 46 in 
the surgery group, and 46 in the radiotherapy 
group; P<0.001 for the overall comparison). Evi-
dence of disease progression included the pres-
ence of metastases (33 men in the active-moni-
toring group, 13 in the surgery group, and 16 in 
the radiotherapy group; P 
= 
0.004 for the overall 
comparison), clinical T3 or T4 disease (79 men 
in the active-monitoring group, 24 in the surgery 
group, and 21 in the radiotherapy group), and 
the initiation of long-term androgen-deprivation 
therapy (47 men in the active-monitoring group, 
26 in the surgery group, and 30 in the radio-
therapy group), with evidence of more than one 
criterion for some men.

Treatment Complications
There were no deaths related to surgery; 9 men 
had thromboembolic or cardiovascular events, 
14 required transfusion of more than 3 units of 
blood, 1 had a rectal injury, and 9 required in-
tervention for anastomotic problems. There were 
3 deaths unrelated to prostate cancer within 90 
days after the completion of radiotherapy.
Numbers Needed to Treat
On the basis of our results, we estimated that 27 
men would need to be treated with prostatecto-
my rather than receive active monitoring to avoid 
1 patient having metastatic disease, and 33 men 
would need to be treated with radiotherapy rather 
than receive active monitoring to avoid 1 patient 
having metastatic disease. A total of 9 men would 
need to be treated with either prostatectomy or 
radiotherapy to avoid 1 patient having clinical 
progression.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses that excluded 
men who were recruited during the feasibility 
phase or that included deaths that were judged to 
be possibly due to prostate cancer. The findings 
were similar to those in the primary analysis.
Discussion
The ProtecT trial was designed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the three major contemporary 
treatment approaches to reducing prostate-cancer 
mortality and improving clinical outcomes in 
men with PSA-detected clinically localized dis-
ease. The results show that death from prostate

deprivation therapy; clinical T3 or T4 disease; and ureteric obstruction, rectal fistula, or the need for a permanent catheter when these are 
not considered to be a complication of treatment.

10-Year Outcomes in Localized Prostate Cancer
cancer in such men remained low at a median of 
10 years of follow-up, at approximately 1%, ir-
respective of the treatment assigned, a rate that 
is considerably lower than was anticipated when 
the trial commenced. All-cause mortality was also 
low — at approximately 10%. The rate of disease 
progression among men assigned to prostatec-
tomy or radiotherapy was less than half the rate 
among men assigned to active monitoring (P<0.001 
for the overall comparison), as was the rate of 
metastatic disease (P 
= 
0.004 for the overall com-
parison). These differences show the effective-
ness of immediate radical therapy over active 
monitoring, but they have not translated into sig-
nificant differences — nor have they ruled out 
equivalence — in disease-specific or all-cause 
mortality; thus, longer-term follow-up is neces-
sary. The majority of men who were randomly 
assigned to active monitoring (88%) accepted 
their treatment assignment, but a quarter of them 
received radical treatment within 3 years after 
their initial assignment and over half by 10 years.
SPCG-4 showed that the risk of death from 
cancer was 6.6 percentage points lower within 
8 years (average follow-up) in the group assigned 
to surgery than in the group assigned to watch-
ful waiting and 11.0 percentage points lower 
within 23 years.2,3 Only 10% of the men in 
SPCG-4 had prostate cancer detected by mea-
surement of PSA levels. The ProtecT trial find-
ings were similar to those of PIVOT in that 
prostatectomy did not result in lower all-cause or 
prostate-cancer–specific mortality than observa-
tion through at least 12 years of follow-up.4 All-
cause and prostate-cancer–specific mortality 
were much lower in the ProtecT trial than in 
SPCG-4 or PIVOT (Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). This may have been related to 
recruitment of a healthier cohort through the 
population-based PSA-testing program in the 
ProtecT trial and improvements in the medical 
treatment of nonprostatic diseases and of pro-
gressing prostate cancer with second-generation 
and third-generation androgen-deprivation ther-
apy, bone-targeted agents (e.g., radionuclides, 
inhibitors of receptor activator of nuclear factor-
κβ ligand [RANKL], and chemotherapy), and 
immunotherapy. It is likely that this evolution 
contributed to the low prostate-cancer mortality 
in the ProtecT trial and will influence future 
follow-up. Evidence of the effectiveness of im-
mediate radical intervention in reducing disease 
progression was consistent in the ProtecT trial, 
SPCG-4, and PIVOT, with the ProtecT trial show-
ing a similar benefit from radiotherapy and 
surgery.
The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial showed no 
beneficial effect of screening for prostate cancer, 
but this trial had severe limitations because of 
high levels of contamination.10,18,19 In contrast, 
ERSPC showed that screening was associated

and Freedom from Disease Progression, According to Treatment Group.
Panel A shows the rate of prostate-cancer–specific survival. Prostate-can-
cer–specific deaths were those that were definitely or probably due to  
prostate cancer or its treatment, as determined by an independent cause-
of-death evaluation committee whose members were unaware of the treat-
ment assignments. Panel B shows the rate of freedom from disease pro-
gression. Clinical progression of prostate cancer included metastasis and 
death due to prostate cancer or its treatment.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
with increased survival and decreased progres-
sion but at a substantial cost of overdetection 
and overtreatment.12,20,21 Synthesizing these data, 
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recom-
mended that population screening for prostate 
cancer should not be adopted as a public health 
policy, because risks appeared to outweigh ben-
efits from detecting and treating PSA-detected 
disease.22 The Cluster Randomised Trial of PSA 
Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) is assessing 
the effectiveness of population-based PSA testing. 
In this trial, primary care physician practices 
were randomly assigned to enroll participants in 
the ProtecT trial (the intervention group) or to 
follow usual care (the control group receiving no 
formal PSA testing), with prostate-cancer mor-
tality as the primary outcome.23
Primary treatment failure occurred in 18 men 
in the surgery group and in 55 men in the radio-
therapy group. Radical interventions were received 
by 291 men in the active-monitoring group, with 
56 (19%) receiving treatment within 9 months 
after randomization. Between-group comparisons 
with respect to treatment failure require consider-
able caution because of the different definitions 
and variables used. In the case of prostatectomy, 
primary treatment failure can be inferred at an 
early stage because of detectable PSA postopera-
tively. In the case of radiotherapy, treatment 
failure can be determined only from subsequent 
increases in PSA levels that might occur much 
later. For patients assigned to active monitoring, 
a change of management to radical treatment 
might have been undertaken for reasons other 
than disease progression. Rates of change of 
management in the ProtecT trial were similar to 
those in other active surveillance programs.24-26
Between-group comparisons with respect to 
disease progression should also be interpreted 
carefully because of different definitions and 
methods of ascertainment. In the surgery group, 
extracapsular extension (pT3 disease) was pres-
ent in 29% of the men at the time of surgery, a 
proportion of whom could have been cured by 
the radical intervention. Similar rates of an in-
crease in clinical stage would be anticipated in 
the radiotherapy and active-monitoring groups, 
emerging later as disease progression.
Guidelines suggest that men with low-vol-
ume, low-risk disease should be followed with-
out immediate intervention.27 Active surveillance 
in such cohorts over a period of 15 years has 
yielded a disease-specific mortality of 0.1 to 
1.5%, depending on the definition of low-risk or 
very-low-risk disease.24,25 However, there remains 
little consensus about the best protocols for fol-
lowing these patients safely, in order to main-
tain them in a “window of curability.”28 In the 
ProtecT active-monitoring group, almost half the 
men received no intervention during the 10-year 
follow-up period.
There are several limitations of the ProtecT 
trial. First, the protocol was developed almost two 
decades ago; since then, treatments and diagnostic 
techniques for prostate cancer have evolved. The 
ProtecT trial did not use multiparametric mag-
netic resonance imaging to evaluate patients at 
diagnosis or during monitoring. Surgical tech-
niques have changed with robot-assisted laparo-
scopic prostatectomy, and although all patients

Deaths due to prostate cancer were defined as deaths that were definitely or 
probably due to prostate cancer or its treatment, as determined by the inde-
pendent cause-of-death evaluation committee.
‡  
P values were calculated with the use of a likelihood-ratio interaction test of 
the null hypothesis of no difference in the relative effectiveness of the three 
treatments across the subgroup levels.
§  
Gleason scores range from 6 to 10, with higher scores indicating a more ag-
gressive form of prostate cancer and a worse prognosis.
¶  
Stage T1c disease is prostate cancer that is identified by needle biopsy be-
cause of an elevated PSA level. Stage T2 disease is prostate cancer that is 
confined within the gland, present in one or both lobes by needle biopsy, and 
palpable by digital rectal examination or visible by imaging.

10-Year Outcomes in Localized Prostate Cancer
in the radiotherapy group received neoadjuvant 
androgen-deprivation therapy with three-dimen-
sional conformal irradiation, new techniques such 
as intensity-modulated radiotherapy have been 
introduced, and brachytherapy was not included. 
Second, less than 1% of the participants enrolled 
in this trial were of African–Caribbean ancestry 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), but this 
percentage reflected the population in the recruit-
ing centers who were in the trial age range.29 The 
strengths of the trial include the randomized com-
parison of men with PSA-detected prostate can-
cer, the inclusion of radiotherapy, standardized 
treatment pathways, and regular follow-up with 
high rates of response.
At a median follow-up of 10 years, the Pro-
tecT trial showed that mortality from prostate 
cancer was low, irrespective of treatment assign-
ment. Prostatectomy and radiotherapy were as-
sociated with lower rates of disease progression 
than active monitoring; however, 44% of the pa-
tients who were assigned to active monitoring did 
not receive radical treatment and avoided side ef-
fects.5 Men with newly diagnosed, localized pros-
tate cancer need to consider the critical trade-off 
between the short-term and long-term effects of 
radical treatments on urinary, bowel, and sexual 
function and the higher risks of disease progres-
sion with active monitoring, as well as the ef-
fects of each of these options on quality of life. 
Further follow-up of the ProtecT participants with 
longer-term survival data will be crucial to evalu-
ate this trade-off in order to fully inform decision 
making for physicians and patients considering 
PSA testing and treatment options for clinically 
localized prostate cancer.
