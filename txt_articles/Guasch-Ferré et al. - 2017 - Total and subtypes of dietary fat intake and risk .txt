ABSTRACT
Background: The associations between dietary fat and cardiovas-
cular disease have been evaluated in several studies, but less is
known about their influence on the risk of diabetes.
Objective: We examined the associations between total fat, sub-
types of dietary fat, and food sources rich in saturated fatty acids
and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Design: A prospective cohort analysis of 3349 individuals who were
free of diabetes at baseline but were at high cardiovascular risk from
the PREvenci´
on con DIeta MEDiterr´
anea (PREDIMED) study was
conducted. Detailed dietary information was assessed at baseline and
yearly during the follow-up using a food frequency questionnaire.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to esti-
mate T2D HRs and 95% CIs according to baseline and yearly
updated fat intake.
Results: We documented 266 incident cases during 4.3 y of follow-up.
Baseline saturated and animal fat intake was not associated with the
risk of T2D. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the highest
quartile of updated intake of saturated and animal fat had a higher risk
of diabetes than the lowest quartile (HR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.73;
and P-trend = 0.01 compared with HR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.09; and
P-trend , 0.01, respectively). In both the Mediterranean diet and
control groups, participants in the highest quartile of updated animal
fat intake had an w2-fold higher risk of T2D than their counterparts in
the lowest quartile. The consumption of 1 serving of butter and cheese
was associated with a higher risk of diabetes, whereas whole-fat yogurt
intake was associated with a lower risk.
Conclusions: In a Mediterranean trial focused on dietary fat interven-
tions, baseline intake of saturated and animal fat was not associated
with T2D incidence, but the yearly updated intake of saturated and
animal fat was associated with a higher risk of T2D. Cheese and butter
intake was associated with a higher risk of T2D, whereas whole-fat
yogurt intake was associated with a lower risk of T2D. This trial was
registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN35739639.

 INTRODUCTION
The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D)21 has become a
public health challenge in the past few decades. In 2015, 415
million adults (8.8%) worldwide suffered from T2D, and it is
estimated that these rates will increase to 642 million (10.4%) in
2040 (1). T2D accounted for 14.5% of deaths in 2015 and is a
serious burden for the health systems of many countries (1).
Accruing evidence has demonstrated that the combination of
several unhealthy lifestyle factors, including a Western-style
diet, reduced physical activity, smoking, overweight, and obe-
sity, explained w90% of T2D cases (2). Dietary fats, especially
the type of fat consumed, have been in the spotlight because
of their effects on health. Although the 2015 dietary guidelines
for Americans encouraged the consumption of vegetable fats
and oils and discouraged the consumption of animal fats (3),
past research has mainly focused on evaluating the associations
between the quality of fats and the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease (4), and less is known about its influence on the risk
of T2D.
Previous observational studies have indicated that total fat
intake is not associated with a higher incidence of T2D (5–8), but
the evidence for specific types of fat remains inconsistent. For
example, the consumption of PUFAs was associated with a
lower risk of T2D in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) (6), but no
association was found in the Iowa Women’s Health Study (7)
despite the fact that both studies included middle-aged women
and evaluated diets with the use of food-frequency question-
naires (FFQs). On the other hand, although SFAs have been
related to insulin resistance (9), no significant associations were
found between SFA intake and the incidence of T2D in several
epidemiologic studies (10). Dietary SFAs represent a heteroge-
neous category of fatty acids that can be obtained from different
food sources, including dairy products, meats, processed meats,
and eggs. Because of the complexity of these fatty acids and the
food matrix in which they are present, SFAs can have different
biological effects on human health (11). A meta-analysis of
randomized controlled trials (12) has shown that consuming
more unsaturated fats (MUFAs and PUFAs) in place of either
carbohydrates or SFAs may improve glycated hemoglobin A1C
and HOMA-IR. PUFA consumption in particular showed addi-
tional benefits on insulin secretion capacity.
Previous data from the Prevenci´
on con Dieta Mediterr´
anea
(PREDIMED) study (ISRCTN35739639) demonstrated that a
dietary pattern high in vegetable fat, primarily nuts and olive
oil, decreased the risk of T2D and its complications (13, 14),
but to our knowledge, the associations between total and
subtypes of fat intake on the incidence of T2D have not been
evaluated in Mediterranean individuals at a high risk for
cardiovascular
disease.
Therefore,
we
prospectively
in-
vestigated the associations between total and specific types of
dietary fat in relation to the risk of T2D in participants free of
diabetes at baseline from PREDIMED. We also examined the
associations between animal food sources rich in SFAs and
T2D risk.
METHODS
Study population
This study was a prospective cohort analysis of individuals
free of T2D at baseline in the framework of PREDIMED,
a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial aimed at
evaluating the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary
prevention of cardiovascular disease in individuals at a high risk for
cardiovascular disease (15, 16). From October 2003 to June 2009,
7447 participants were recruited. Participants in PREDIMED were
men aged 55–80 y and women aged 60–80 y who were free of
cardiovascular disease at baseline but were at a high risk because
they had either T2D or $3 of the following cardiovascular dis-
ease risk factors: current smoking, hypertension, hypercholester-
olemia, low HDL cholesterol, overweight or obesity, or family
history of premature coronary artery disease. Exclusion criteria
were the presence of any severe chronic illness, alcohol or drug
abuse, BMI (in kg/m2) $40, and allergy or intolerance to olive
oil or nuts (16). For this analysis, we further excluded those
participants who had T2D at baseline (n = 3614), lacked mea-
sures of blood glucose control (n = 292), were not followed up
(n = 94), had implausible daily energy intake (,500 or .3500
kcal/d for women and ,800 or .4000 kcal/d for men), or had
not completed the baseline FFQ (n = 98). The final analyses
included 3349 individuals free of T2D at baseline. The in-
stitutional review boards of all recruiting centers approved all
procedures. Written informed consent was obtained from all
study participants.
Ascertainment of T2D mellitus
The primary endpoint for this analysis was T2D incidence
diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria
(17), namely fasting plasma glucose concentrations $7.0 mmol/L
($126.1 mg/dL) or 2-h plasma glucose concentrations $11.1 mmol/L
($200.0 mg/dL) after an oral dose of 75 g glucose or the recent
use of an oral/insulin medication. A review of all medical records
of participants was completed yearly in each center by physicians
and investigators who were blinded to the intervention. When
new-onset T2D cases were identified on the basis of a medical
diagnosis reported in the medical charts or on a glucose test during
routine biochemical analyses (done $1/y), these reports were sent
to the PREDIMED Clinical Events Committee, whose members
were also blinded to treatment allocation. Only when a second test
with the use of the same criteria and repeated within the next 3 mo
was available was the new T2D case definitively confirmed by the
adjudication committee (13).
Dietary assessment
Dietary intake was measured with the use of a validated
semiquantitative FFQ that trained dietitians completed in a face-
to-face interview with the participant at baseline and yearly
during the follow-up (18). This questionnaire, which has been
validated in a populations at a high risk for cardiovascular disease
risk from Spain (18), included 137 food items and 9-level scale-
incremental frequencies of consumption for each food item
(never or almost never; 1–3 times/mo; 1, 2–4, and 5–6 times/wk;
and 1, 2–3, 4–6, and .6 times/d). We used Spanish food com-
position tables to estimate energy and nutrient intake (19).

 Assessment of other covariates
At baseline and yearly during the follow-up, a questionnaire
about lifestyle, educational achievement, medical history, and
medication use was administered. Physical activity was assessed
with the use of the validated Spanish version of the Minnesota
Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire (20). Trained per-
sonnel took anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. We
used calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer to measure
weight and height, respectively, with participants in light clothing
and no shoes; we used a validated oscillometer (HEM705CP;
Omron) to measure blood pressure in triplicatewith a 5-min interval
between each measurement, and we recorded the mean of these 3
values. Participants were considered to be hypercholesterolemic or
hypertensive if they had previously been diagnosed as such and/or
were being treated with cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive
agents, respectively.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the follow-up time for each participant as the
interval between the date of random assignment and T2D di-
agnosis, death from any cause, or the date of the last contact visit,
whichever came first. The percentage of energy intake from total
and specific dietary fats was calculated with the use of yearly
updated measurements to better represent the long-term diet. We
used data from baseline to the last FFQ before the onset of T2D to
categorize participants into quartiles of dietary fat [MUFAs,
PUFAs, SFAs, trans fat, animal fat, vegetable fat, marine v-3 fatty
acids, nonmarine v-3 fatty acids, and v-6 linoleic acid (18:2n–6)].
Baseline characteristics were presented for the total nondiabetic
PREDIMED population and according to extreme quartiles of total
and subtypes of fat intake, expressed as the mean 6 SD for
quantitative traits and n (%) for categorical variables. We calculated
the correlations between MUFAs and SFAs with different food
groups as well as fat type–adjusted residuals of SFAs and MUFAs.
We estimated HRs and 95% CIs of incident T2D according to
quartiles of total and specific types of dietary fat. Time-dependent
Cox regression analyses were conducted both for baseline and
yearly updated measurements of dietary fat. Because the main
intervention in PREDIMED was focused on recommendations
about the intake of dietary fat and foods rich in dietary fats, which
could produce bias from more compliant and health-conscious
subjects achieving larger dietary changes, we conducted a strati-
fied analysis for the intervention group (the 2 merged Mediterra-
nean diet groups compared with the control group).
To assess a linear trend, we assigned the median intake within
each quartile and modeled the variable as continuous. In addition,
we estimated the risk of T2D modeling the updated total and
specific fat intake (as percentage energy) with the use of con-
tinuous variables. Multivariable model 1 was adjusted for age,
sex, BMI, smoking status, educational status, leisure-time physical
activity, baseline hypertension or the use of antihypertensive
medication, total energy intake, alcohol intake, quartiles of fiber,
protein intake, and dietary cholesterol. Model 2 for specific types
of fat also included as covariates quartiles of the other subtypes of
fat. Model 3 was further adjusted for potential mediators of the
associations, including hypercholesterolemia or the use of lipid-
lowering drugs and fasting plasma glucose at baseline. All models
were stratified by recruitment center, and the analyses for the total
population were further adjusted for intervention group. To test
the robustness of our findings, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis that excluded those participants who developed T2D
during the first year of follow-up (n = 39). When all types of fats
(expressing them as percentages of total energy), protein,
alcohol, total energy, and the other covariates are included si-
multaneously in the models, the coefficient from these models can
be interpreted as the estimated differences in the risk of substituting
a certain percentage of energy from total or specific types of fat for
carbohydrates.
Finally, we also evaluated the association between the updated
intake of 1 serving of animal food sources rich in SFAs (pro-
cessed red meat, red meat, eggs, whole-fat milk, butter, whole-fat
yogurt, and cheese) and the risk of T2D. The models were ad-
justed for the nondietary covariates listed previously and intakes
of total energy, alcohol, vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, fish,
meat, dairy, olive oil, nuts, and biscuits (except if the exposure
was included in these food groups). Data were analyzed with the
use of Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp LP), and statistical signif-
icance was set at P , 0.05.
RESULTS
During a median follow-up of 4.3 y, we documented 266
incident cases of T2D. At baseline, participants with a higher
total fat intake had lower blood glucose concentrations, a lower
intake of total energy, and a higher intake of all subtypes of fat.
Participants with higher SFA and trans fat intake were more
likely to smoke, were less physically active, and consumed less
dietary fiber (Table 1). Baseline characteristics of the study pop-
ulation according to quartiles of animal and vegetable fat intake
and subtypes of PUFA intake are described in Supplemental
Table 1. At baseline, the mean intake of total fat in percentages of
energy in the Mediterranean diet groups was 38.33% 6 6.30% and
37.95% 6 6.56% in the control group. At year 3, total fat intake in
the Mediterranean diet group increased to 40.71% 6 5.49% and
decreased to 37.40% 6 6.44% in the control group (Supple-
mental Table 2). The Spearman correlation coefficient between
MUFAs and SFAs was 0.40. The respective coefficients for type-
adjusted residuals of SFAs and cheese, red meat, and processed
meat were 0.43, 0.36, 0.30, respectively (Supplemental Table 3).
The associations between baseline total and specific dietary fat
intake and the risk of T2D are presented in Table 2. In the
multivariable model, participants in the top quartile of baseline
total fat intake had a higher risk of T2D than those in the ref-
erence quartile (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.54). For PUFAs, the
corresponding HR was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.35), and for veg-
etable fat it was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.47). Baseline SFAs and
animal fat were not significantly associated with T2D risk [multi-
variable model 3 for the fourth quartile compared with the first
quartile: SFAs—HR: 1.16 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.99); animal fat—
HR: 1.24 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.98)] (Table 2).
When analyzing yearly updated dietary fats in the total
population in the multivariable model adjusted for cardiovas-
cular disease risk factors, dietary factors, and baseline plasma
glucose, a higher risk of T2D was observed for those participants
in the highest quartile of updated SFA intake (fourth quartile
compared with first quartile—HR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.73;
P trend = 0.01) (Table 3). A 5% energy increment from SFA
intake was consistently associated with a 2-fold higher risk of
T2D (HR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.52; P , 0.05) (Table 4). Higher

FAT INTAKE AND INCIDENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES
727
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/105/3/723/4569701 by guest on 05 June 2019
 SFA intake was associated with T2D in the Mediterranean diet
group but not in the control group; however, the interaction
between SFAs and intervention group on T2D was not signifi-
cant (P-interaction = 0.19). No significant associations were
found for updated total fat intake and T2D incidence in multi-
variable models adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors
and dietary factors (Supplemental Table 4), but when the
model was further adjusted for baseline glucose, higher total fat
intake was nonsignificantly associated with the risk of T2D
(P-trend = 0.06) (Table 3). No significant associations were
observed for the updated intake of MUFAs, PUFAs, or trans fat
and the risk of T2D. In the stratified analysis, the P-trend for the
updated intake of PUFA consumption in the Mediterranean
group was 0.05 (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.85, 2.14). When it was
modeled as a continuous variable, the HR of T2D was 1.56
(95% CI: 1.04, 2.34; P , 0.05) per each 5% increase in energy
from PUFA consumption (Table 4). Similarly, no significant
associations were found between the updated intake of marine
v-3 fatty acids, nonmarine v-3 fatty acids, linoleic acid intake,
and T2D (Table 3). Consistent findings were observed when
these dietary fats were analyzed as continuous variables per each
5% increase in energy intake (Table 4), but when the intake of
marine v-3 fatty acids was modeled as a continuous variable, we
found an inverse association with T2D incidence for the total
population analysis (Table 4). In the stratified analysis, each 5%
increase in energy intake from linoleic acid was significantly
associated with a higher risk of T2D in the Mediterranean diet
group (Table 4).
Animal fat intake was strongly associated with a higher risk of
T2D in the total population analyses (fourth quartile compared
with first quartile—HR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.09; P-trend , 0.01)
after adjusting for baseline fasting plasma glucose (Table 3).
Participants in the higher quartile of updated animal fat intake
had an w2-fold higher risk of T2D than their counterparts in
the lower quartile in both the Mediterranean diet and control
groups (Table 3). Per each 5% increase in energy intake from
animal fat, the risk of T2D increased by 26% (HR: 1.26; 95%
CI: 1.04, 1.53; P-trend = 0.02) (Table 4). In the stratified anal-
ysis that used continuous variables, animal fat intake was as-
sociated with a higher risk of T2D only in the Mediterranean
diet group. In the total population analyses, although vegetable
fat showed a trend toward a higher risk of T2D in model 3 ad-
justed for baseline plasma glucose (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.25;
P-trend = 0.09) (Table 3), no significant associations were
found in the multivariable models not adjusted for plasma
glucose (Supplemental Table 5) when analyzed as a contin-
uous variable in the sensitivity analysis and when stratified by
intervention group.
When we conducted sensitivity analysis by excluding those
participants who developed T2D during the first year of follow-up
(n = 39), the results were consistent with those of the primary
analysis. The updated intake of SFAs and animal fat was con-
sistently associated with a higher risk of T2D [multivariable model
3 for the fourth quartile compared with the first quartile: SFAs—
HR: 2.46 (95% CI: 1.38, 4.38) and P-trend = 0.01; animal fat—
HR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.97) and P-trend = 0.01], whereas a 5%
increase in energy from marine v-3 fatty acids was associated
with a lower risk of TD (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.77; P , 0.01).
Figure 1 shows the risk of T2D by the updated intake of 1
serving of animal food sources rich in SFAs. Increasing the intake
of 12 g butter and 30 g cheese was associated with a higher risk of
T2D [HR: 2.42 (95% CI: 1.42, 4.13) and P , 0.01 compared with
HR: 1.32 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.52) and P , 0.01, respectively],
whereas the intake of whole-fat yogurt was associated with a
lower risk of T2D (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.94; P = 0.02). No
significant associations between red meat, processed meat, eggs,
or whole-fat milk and diabetes were observed.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study of participants at a high risk for
cardiovascular disease, we found that the yearly updated intake of
SFAs and animal fat, but not the baseline intake, were strongly
associated with the risk of T2D after controlling for recognized
classical potential confounders and plasma glucose concentra-
tions at baseline. Butter and cheese intake, food sources rich in
SFAs, were associated with a higher incidence of T2D, whereas
whole-fat yogurt intake was associated with a lower incidence.
These findings suggest a potential different role of SFAs on the risk
of T2D depending on the food matrix in which they are consumed.
Given that our analyses were conducted in the context of
PREDIMED, a nutritional trial that emphasized the intake of nuts

1 All values are HRs (95% CIs) unless otherwise indicated. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used for all assessments. Multivariable model 1
was adjusted for age, sex, intervention group, BMI (in kg/m2), smoking status, educational status, leisure-time physical activity, baseline hypertension or the
use of antihypertensive medication, total energy intake, alcohol intake, quartiles of fiber, protein intake, and dietary cholesterol; model 2 was additionally
adjusted for specific types of fat that were also included as covariates quartiles of the other subtypes of fat; and model 3 was further adjusted for potential
mediators of the associations, including hypercholesterolemia or the use of lipid-lowering drugs and fasting plasma glucose at baseline. All models were
stratified by recruitment center. Extremes of total energy intake (.4000 or ,800 kcal/d in men and .3500 or ,500 kcal/d in women) were excluded. FA,

FAT INTAKE AND INCIDENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES

 and olive oil (high in dietary fat), we evaluated both the asso-
ciations between the intake of baseline total and specific fats as
well as repeated measurements for the total population and
stratified by intervention group in relation to T2D incidence to
assess potential bias resulting from our intervention. We found a
strong positive association between the yearly updated intake of
SFAs and T2D but not for baseline SFA intake. Those participants
who had a higher consumption of SFAs during 4.3 y of median
follow-up had an w2-fold higher risk of T2D than their coun-
terparts with lower intakes of SFAs. Per each 5% increase in
energy from SFA intake, the risk of T2D increased substantially.
However, when we separated the analysis by intervention group,
no significant associations between SFAs in relation to T2D were
observed in the control group, probably because the Mediterranean
diet intervention played an important role in reducing the risk of
T2D in the PREDIMED population (13, 14). In addition, we
observed a higher risk of T2D for higher intakes of PUFA and
linoleic acid only in the Mediterranean diet groups, which could
reflect a potential bias from compliance. Those participants who
were most compliant (i.e., increasing MUFAs from nuts or olive oil
and thereby decreasing other fats) probably had a lower risk of T2D.
Results from the baseline and updated analyses differed in this
study. At baseline, the consumption of total fat, vegetable fat, and
PUFAs but not SFAs or animal fat was significantly associated
with a higher risk of T2D. However, the updated intake of SFAs
and animal fat was associated with a higher risk of T2D in the
overall population and in the Mediterranean diet group, whereas
updated PUFA and linoleic acid intake was only associated with a
higher risk of T2D in the Mediterranean diet group. Considering
the trial design and differences between baseline and the yearly
updated dietary fat intake on T2D, we cannot fully discard a
potential bias of those participants who were more compliant and
health-conscious and who achieved larger dietary changes as a
result of participating in the trial.
Previous studies have been inconsistent in terms of the as-
sociation between SFA intake and health outcomes. The FAO
concluded that SFAs might be associated with insulin resistance
and T2D (21), and findings from NHS also indicated that SFA
intake was associated with a 34% a a higher risk of diabetes in
multivariable models adjusted for diet, but the association was
weakened after adjusting for BMI (22). In 2 other prospective
studies, incident T2D and conversion to T2D were positively
associated with SFA consumption (23, 24). On the other hand,
null associations between SFA intake and type 2 diabetes have
been shown in long-term cohorts and in a recent meta-analysis of
observational studies (10). However, some of the studies included
in the meta-analysis were small or did not include mutual ad-
justment for other types of fatty acids. In the Women’s Health
Initiative, reducing SFAs, when replaced with carbohydrates, did
not reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes after 8.1 y of follow-up
(25). Several reasons may account for this finding, including that
participants were not at a higher risk of diabetes at baseline than
those from other trials that may have included physical activity
and weight loss as part of the intervention (25). More recently,
a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated
that replacing 5% of energy from carbohydrates with SFAs had
no significant effect on fasting glucose but lowered fasting in-
sulin. Replacing SFAs with PUFAs significantly lowered glucose,
glycated hemoglobin A1C, and HOMA-IR (12). Together, it is
important to consider the replacement nutrient when assessing the
associations between dietary fat intake and chronic diseases.
The main contributors of the animal sources of SFA intake in
our population were cheese (22.9%), red meat (17.6%), and
processed meat (8.0%), followed by eggs and other dairy
products (ranging from 1% to 5% of the animal SFA intake).
Moderate correlations were observed for type-adjusted residuals
of SFAs and red meat, processed meat, and total cheese but not for
adjusted residuals of MUFAs and these food groups. Results from
this study and previous findings from PREDIMED (26) suggest
that dairy products, food sources of SFAs, are inversely associated
with T2D. Nevertheless, the effect differs depending on the dairy
product consumed, and one of the reasons may be the different type
of SFAs that these products contain. Individual studies and meta-
analyses have shown that higher dairy-fat biomarkers were in-
versely associated with the risk of T2D (27) but that red meats and
processed meats were associated with an increased risk of T2D
(28). We found that butter and cheese consumption was associated
with a higher risk of T2D, whereas whole-fat yogurt intake was
associated with a lower risk of T2D. Although cheese consumption
was inversely associated with the risk of diabetes in some studies,

status, educational status, leisure-time physical activity, yearly updated total energy intake, alcohol intake, yearly updated quartiles of fiber, protein intake,
dietary cholesterol, baseline hypertension or the use of antihypertensive medication, baseline hypercholesterolemia or the use of lipid-lowering drugs, and
fasting plasma glucose at baseline. The multivariable model for specific subtypes of fat also included as covariates the other subtypes of fat. All models were
stratified by recruitment center, and total population models were further adjusted by intervention group. Extremes of total energy intake (.4000 or ,800
kcal/d in men and .3500 or ,500 kcal/d in women) were excluded. The risk estimates for other models are shown in Supplemental Tables 4 and 5. FA, fatty

 (29, 30) not all studies agreed (31). Indeed, there is evidence
suggesting that cheese intake in men was associated with a 5%
higher T2D risk in a meta-analysis of 2 prospective studies (31).
Because we did not differentiate between the type of cheese
consumed and the intake of cheese is often combined with refined
carbohydrates, this may explain the increased risk of T2D observed
in our study; however, clinical trials are needed to confirm these
associations. An inverse association between butter and T2D
(RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99; P = 0.021) has been recently
reported (32). Butter is a source of animal fat and trans fatty
acids, and it has been previously observed that substituting butter
for olive oil is beneficial for T2D prevention (33). Although a

FAT INTAKE AND INCIDENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES

 higher risk of T2D has been demonstrated with the consump-
tion of red meat and processed meat in previous studies (28,
34), we did not find significant associations between processed
meat, red meat, and T2D in this study, possibly because re-
sidual confounding may have blunted the potential associa-
tions. However, total meat intake and processed meat intake
were associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome and
its components (including high fasting glucose) in a previous
report of the PREDIMED Study (35).
We observed a lack of an association between updated total fat
intake and the risk of T2D after adjusting for cardiovascular
disease risk factors and dietary factors, but a trend to an increased
risk was observed when plasma glucose was included in the
model, which may be a potential mediator of the associations.
However, when separating the analysis by intervention group,
nonsignificant associations were found. Although conflicting
results have been found for total fat intake and T2D (36), in 3
previous prospective studies with a follow-up ranging from 6 to
14 y, including NHS (6), the Iowa Women’s Health Study (7),
and the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (8),
total dietary fat intake was not significantly associated with the
risk of diabetes. In line with our results, in 2 of these previous
studies, MUFA intake was not significantly associated with the
risk of T2D incidence (6, 7).

 It is also worth noting that we found that total animal fat intake
was associated with a higher risk of T2D in the total population
but also when stratified by intervention group. In this sense, our
results support the current dietary recommendations that favor
plant-based fat diets over animal fats (37), encouraging the intake
of healthy vegetable fat, such as olive oil or nuts. We found a
nonsignificant suggestive trend of an increased risk of T2D by
a higher intake of vegetable fat when evaluated in quartiles; however,
the associations were no longer significant when evaluated as a
continuous variable or when stratified by intervention group. The
potential higher risk of T2D by a higher intake of vegetable fat may
be explained because in addition to fruits, vegetables, and nuts, this
food group also included other vegetable oils (such as palm oil),
margarine, and processed pastries that may have driven the positive
trend on an increased T2D risk in our population (38).
Our data suggests that a 1% increase in energy intake from
marine v-3 fatty acids was associated with an w50% lower risk
of T2D, but no significant associations were found when ana-
lyzed as quartiles of intake or for other subtypes of PUFAs.
Previous data regarding the associations with marine v-3 fatty
acids are inconsistent, and a meta-analysis that included 16
prospective cohort studies and .25,670 cases of diabetes con-
cluded that the consumption of 250 mg/d v-3 fatty acids from
seafood was not significantly associated with T2D risk (RR: 1.04;
95% CI: 0.97, 1.10) (39). In addition, the results for linoleic acid
in this study are consistent with a meta-analysis of 5 prospective
cohort studies that showed no significant associations between the
intake of v-6 fatty acids and diabetes (40).
Finally, no association between trans fat and T2D was ob-
served in our population, perhaps because the intake of this type
of fat is very low in Spain (especially in the elderly Mediter-
ranean population, who consume low amounts of processed
food) and the lack of statistical power when separating the
analysis by intervention. In agreement with these results, a meta-
analysis that included 6 prospective cohort studies found no
association between trans fat intake and T2D (HR: 1.10;
95% CI: 0.95, 1.27), although the authors reported that the in-
terpretation of these findings is complicated because of the
heterogeneity between the included studies (10).
Dietary fats could affect insulin resistance and consequently
the risk of diabetes through several mechanisms that are yet not
well understood. Dietary fatty acids may play a differential role
on diabetes onset through the mediation of cell-membrane fatty-
acid composition and functions, including membrane fluidity, ion
permeability, and insulin-receptor binding and affinity (41). For
instance, a greater SFA content of membrane phospholipids in-
creases insulin resistance (41). Moreover, increased serum SFAs
have been shown to be associated with insulin resistance, elevated
serum glucose concentration, and tissue inflammation (42). Palmitic
acid (16:0) might activate inflammatory cytokines and pose specific
lipotoxicity to pancreatic b cells (43). On the other hand, MUFAs
and PUFAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on serum
lipids, inflammation, blood pressure, insulin resistance, endothelial
function, and glycemic control (44–47).
Findings from this study cannot prove causality, and it is
difficult to rule out residual confounding. We adjusted for several
known risk factors for T2D, including several dietary factors, but
measurement errors are inevitable in estimates of food and nutrient
consumption. Finally, results from a Mediterranean population at a
high risk for cardiovascular disease may not be generalizable to
more diverse populations. Given that these analyses were con-
ducted in the context of a clinical trial and because most developed
countries have had dietary guidelines recommending the reduction
of SFA intake for several decades, we acknowledge that it is
difficult to disentangle the health consciousness of the population
for reducing SFA intake from a true effect of SFAs on T2D. The
strengths of our study include the prospective design, the use of the
repeated measures of diet and lifestyle, and the accurate and blind
assessment of incident case of T2D.
In summary, these data suggest that the intake of SFAs and
animal fat was associated with a higher risk of T2D incidence in a
Mediterranean population at a high risk for cardiovascular dis-
ease. Some animal food sources rich in SFAs such as cheese and
butter were associated with a higher risk of T2D, whereas others
such as whole-fat yogurt were associated with a lower risk of
T2D. These findings may provide a deeper insight into the
recommendations for dietary guidelines regarding the type of
dietary fat to be consumed at a population level.
