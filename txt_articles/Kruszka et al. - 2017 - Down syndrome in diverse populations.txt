Down syndrome is the most common cause of cognitive
impairment and presents clinically with universally recog-
nizable signs and symptoms. In this study, we focus on exam
findings and digital facial analysis technology in individuals
with Down syndrome in diverse populations. Photos and
clinical information were collected on 65 individuals from 13
countries, 56.9% were male and the average age was 6.6 years
(range 1 month to 26 years; SD ¼ 6.6 years). Subjective

ethnicities (Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans), includ-

newborns to adults (n ¼ 129 cases; n ¼ 132 controls) was able
to diagnose Down syndrome with a sensitivity of 0.961,
specificity of 0.924, and accuracy of 0.943. Only the angles
at medial canthus and ala of the nose were common signifi-
cant findings amongst different ethnicities (Caucasians,
Africans, and Asians) when compared to ethnically matched
controls. The Asian group had the least number of significant
digital facial biometrics at 4, compared to Caucasians at 8 and
Africans at 7. In conclusion, this study displays the wide

Down syndrome and demonstrates the accuracy and promise
of digital facial analysis technology in the diagnosis of Down

INTRODUCTION
Down syndrome (DS), the most common cause for intellectual
disability and congenital heart disease, is a well-known disorder
caused by an extra chromosome 21. DS was first described by John
Langdon Down in 1866 [Down, 1866] and nearly a century later in
1959, Jerome Lejeune associated DS with trisomy 21 [Lejeune et al.,
1959]. The original papers characterizing DS focused on individu-
als of European descent [Hall, 1964] and it would be almost a
hundred years from Langdon Down’s original paper that DS was
recognized in African populations [Parker, 1950; Luder and
Musoke, 1955]. Some investigators in the 20th century believed
that DS was uncommon in Africans [Jelliffe, 1954; Luder and
Musoke, 1955] even after Parker reported an incidence of 1.16 per
1,000 in a study of 25,026 African American live births [Parker,
1950]. In 1982, Adeyokunnu documented in a Nigerian study that
the incidence of DS in Africans was similar to other populations at
1.16 per 1,000 [Adeyokunnu, 1982], which matched Parker’s 1950
estimate in African Americans [Parker, 1950]. The incidence of DS
in Asian and Latin American countries has been found to approxi-
mate Caucasian and African populations [Verma and Singh, 1975;
Kuroki et al., 1977; Carothers et al., 1999; Hook et al., 1999;
Carothers et al., 2001; Forrester and Merz, 2003; Jackson et al.,
2014]. With the purpose of focusing on DS in non-European
populations, this present study focuses on the phenotype of DS
in diverse populations around the world.
Infants with DS have characteristic facial features, allowing for
a diagnosis to be made in the neonatal period; however, the
clinical diagnosis of DS by a clinician before cytogenetic testing is
only predicted to be 64% accurate [Sivakumar and Larkins,
2004]. The use of antenatal screening is not widespread in
developing countries and diagnosis is often made after birth.
In one large study in India, 90% of individuals with DS were
referred after one month of age [Kava et al., 2004]. Early
diagnosis of DS is crucial in order to address life threatening
congenital medical problems such as atrioventricular septal
defect (AVSD), which is 1,000-fold higher in incidence in DS
compared to non-DS, the most common structural heart mal-
formation in DS and leading contributor to infant mortality
[Kruszka, 2015]. Advances in cardiac surgery have greatly
improved survival over the last 70 years from a median of 12 years
to now 60 years [Bittles et al., 2007; Weijerman et al., 2008].
Complicating early diagnosis, the medical literature is filled
with examples of physical exam findings that differ amongst
ethnicities. In one African report, one third of DS diagnoses in
neonates were missed by medical practitioners [Christianson,
1996]. Differences between African DS newborns and African
healthy newborns were significantly less prominent than in
newborns of European descent [Luder and Musoke, 1955;
Christianson et al., 1995]. Christianson et al. [1995] noted
that the flat facial profile typically noted in DS infants was
present in 64% of healthy African newborns, the flat nasal bridge
typical of DS infants was present in 68% of healthy African
newborns, and epicanthal folds, oblique palpebral fissures, pro-
truding tongues, and excess nuchal skin were significantly more
common in African newborns compared to infants of Euro-
pean background. Further obscuring the diagnosis of DS in
Africans is the less frequent findings of brachycephaly and
flat occiput in children with DS [Luder and Musoke, 1955;
Christianson et al., 1995]. There have also been reports of
difficult diagnosis of DS in Asian patients [Lee et al., 1961;
Conen et al., 1962]. In addition to physical exam findings, it is
important to point out other differences in clinical presenta-
tion as Freeman et al. [2008] found that African Americans
were twice as likely to have AVSDs as Caucasians (odds ratio,

were half as likely to have AVSDs as those of European descent
(odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.77).
Down syndrome is a well-researched condition with thou-
sands of journal articles written. However, very few have
focused on diverse populations such as Africans [Christianson,
1997] and many clinicians have been trained with clinical
genetic resources that used patients of northern European
descent as the standard of reference [Muenke et al., 2016].
The first aim of this study is to examine the differences and
similarities in DS populations from around the world. We
accomplish this goal by comparing physician exam findings
and digital facial analysis technology. The second objective of
this study is to provide a spectrum of facial and extremity
images of DS in diverse populations. Although the ethical
complexities of examining patients from diverse populations
is not a goal of this study, we acknowledge that questions
derived from the historical complexity of medicine, race, and
ethnicity may surface and that these concerns are thoroughly
discussed by Koretzky et al. [2016].
METHODS
Review of Medical Literature
A Medline search was conducted to find studies that charac-
terize DS in diverse populations. The key words and search
terms used included: Down syndrome, trisomy 21, African,
African-American, Asian, Latin American, Hispanic, Indian,
and diverse populations. Additionally, reference lists of studies
were reviewed.
Patients in Present Study
Sixty-five patients with DS confirmed by cytogenic testing (karyo-
type and/or chromosomal microarray) were evaluated from 13

 countries. For this study’s purpose, patients were grouped by
geographic area of origin (African, Asian, Latin American), know-
ing that these types of categories can be imprecise and that
significant phenotypical variation exists between populations
from similar areas of the world. Patients were examined by local
clinical geneticists for a number of clinical criteria that have been
applied to the diagnosis of DS including upslanting palpebral
fissures, epicanthal folds, flat facial profile, and nasal bridge, ear
anomalies, protruding tongue, flat occiput, brachycephaly, trans-
verse palmar crease, clinodactyly, brachydactyly, sandal gap, and
abundant neck skin [Hall, 1964; Fried, 1980; Jones et al., 2013].
Patients were consented by local institutional review boards and
the Personalized Genomics protocol at the National Institutes of
Health (11-HG-0093). Physical exam findings from the medical
literature and from this study where compiled in a table for review
(Table I).
Facial Analysis Technology
Digital facial analysis technology previously described [Zhao et al.,
2013, 2014a,b; Cerrolaza et al., 2016] was applied to the sixty-five
individuals with DS from this study and 64 cases and 132 healthy
ethnically matched controls from our previously described data-
base [Zhao et al., 2013, 2014a]. This technology analyzed the frontal
facial images.
Using these individuals, we ran our algorithms for feature
extraction, feature selection and classification. A total of 126
facial features were extracted from a set of 44 facial landmarks,
represented in Figure 1. The features included both geometric
and texture biomarkers. The geometric measurements are a set
of distances and angles measured from the 33 inner facial
landmarks, as shown in Figure 1. To quantify texture informa-
tion, local binary patterns [Ojala et al., 1996], which are robust
markers of monotonic illumination changes, were calculated at
each of the inner facial landmarks, thus capturing the local face
structure. Each local binary pattern constitutes a histogram of
the contrast information centered at one landmark, which
quantifies information such as shadows and lines on the faces.
From the set of geometric and texture features, the most
significant ones were selected using the method proposed by
Cai et al. [2010]. For each feature set selected, a support vector
machine [Cortes and Vapnik, 1995] classifier was trained using

 leave-one-out strategy cross-validation [Elisseeff and Pontil,
2003]. The optimal number of features for each classification
was selected as the one that maximized the classification accu-
racy. In addition, we also calculated the significance (P-value) as
an estimator of its individual discriminant power.
We obtained results using only geometric features, and then
using both geometric and texture features for all the patient groups.
Significance was assessed using Fisher’s exact test.
RESULTS
Photo images and clinical information were collected on 65
individuals with DS from 13 countries, average age was 6.6 years
(range 1 month to 26 years; SD ¼ 6.6 years) and 56.9% were male
(Supplementary Table SI). Figures 2–4 show facial features in
individuals of African (n ¼ 25), Asian (n ¼ 31), and Latin Ameri-
can (n ¼ 9) heritage, respectively. Figure 5 focuses on hand findings
and Figure 6 shows lower extremity findings. Figure 7 is an age
progression in some of the participants, showing the variability in
features at different stages in life. Table I demonstrates physical
exam variations in our study population and in the medical
literature in individuals with DS from different geographic loca-
tions. The exam findings for the cardinal signs of DS described
above [Hall, 1964; Fried, 1980; Jones et al., 2013] are listed in Table
I. For the present study, subjective findings (Table I) showed that
clinical features differed across ethnicities (Africans, Asians, and
FIG. 3. Frontal and lateral facial profiles of Asian individuals with Down syndrome. Gender, age, and country of origin found in Supplementary
Table I.

 Latin Americans) including brachycephaly, ear anomalies, clino-
dactyly, sandal gap, and abundant neck skin, which were all
significantly less frequent in Africans (P < 0.001, P < 0.001,
P < 0.001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively). The most common
features found in the present study and previous studies, and the
only two findings found in over half of participants (Table I) were
upslanting palpebral fissures and flat facial profile with minimum
prevalences of 61% and 51%, respectively. However, there was large
variation in facial findings between all studies, even within the same
ethnic groups (Table I). For example, epicanthal folds in Asians
were found in 71% of the present study and range from 18% in a
Malaysian study of 149 [Azman et al., 2007] to 61% in a Korean
study of 123 participants [Kim et al., 2002]. Limb findings in our
cohort and the medical literature were varied with transverse
palmar creases ranging from 33% to 99%, clinodactyly 19% to
100%, brachydactyly 11% to 100%, and sandal gap 33% to 88%.
Using a more objective approach with facial recognition tech-
nology, Table II shows the age and geographic origin of cases and
controls studied, consisting of Caucasians, Africans or African
American, and Asians. A total of 129 individuals with DS and
132 healthy controls were evaluated (Table II). Using previously
described methods for feature extraction and analysis [Zhao et al.,
2014a], the three groups (Caucasian, Asian, and African) only
shared two biomarkers that were significantly different from con-
trols: the angles at the medial canthus and ala of the nose
(Supplementary Tables SII–IV). Latin American patients were
not included in this analysis due to the small sample size. The
Asian group had the least number of significant geometric features
at four compared to Caucasians at eight and African at seven
(Supplementary Tables SII and SIV). Caucasians and Africans
shared the most significant anatomical features at six geometric
measures (Supplementary Tables SII and SIV), including the
upslanting of the palpebral fissures, the length of the nose and
the distance between the medial canthi. The African and Asian
groups shared three significant features, including the angle at the
nose root. The Asian and Caucasian groups also shared three
features, including the distance between the oral commissures.
Interestingly, the upslanting of the palpebral fissures was not a
discriminative features of DS in the Asian group.
Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 0.853,
0.856, and 0.854, respectively for a combined analysis of the entire
cohort (n ¼ 129 cases; n ¼ 132 controls) using only geometric
features (Table III). When using both geometric and texture
measures, sensitivity increased to 0.961, specificity to 0.924, and
accuracy to 0.943 (P < 0.001, see Table III). All three population
groups (Caucasian, African, and Asian) improved in sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy when combining geometric and texture
features for distinct groups (P < 0.001 for all, see Table III).
Supplementary Figures S1–3 graphically demonstrate how the
addition of features improves the measures of sensitivity,

 specificity, and accuracy. Supplementary Tables SII–IV presented
the relevant features for the diagnosis of DS for each population, as
selected by the digital facial analysis technology.
DISCUSSION
Down syndrome is often diagnosed prenatally in developed coun-
tries by ultrasound and/or genetic testing from amniocytes or
chorionic villus samples. When these resources are not used,
especially in developing countries, diagnosis is made by clinical
observation of morphologic findings. Here, we present individuals
with DS from multiple geographies, with a majority ascertained
from developing nations. This study characterizes DS subjectively
with images of facial and limb findings, objectively with facial
analysis technology, and collectively by organizing clinical exam
findings from the medical literature. The goal of this work is to give
providers a baseline reference to make the diagnosis of DS in
diverse populations, as an earlier diagnosis allows for appropriate

 preventive measures, early recognition of complications such as
congenital heart disease, and genetic counseling and recurrence
risk discussions with parents.
This study and previous studies have found differences between
different ethnicities in individuals with DS. Subjective analysis of
our study group showed statistically significant differences when all
groups were compared together (Table I) in five classic exam
findings (brachycephaly, ear anomalies, clinodactyly, sandal
gap, and abundant neck skin) due to decreased findings in
African patients. To further explore these differences, we employed
objective facial analysis technology in 129 cases with DS and 132
controls. Interestingly, the Asian cohort in our digital facial recog-
nition group had the least amount of significant different mor-
phological (here called geometric) characteristics compared to a
healthy control group (Supplementary Table SIV). Differences
with morphological appearances in healthy individuals between
ethnicities must also be considered and how these differences are
related to DS. For example, Christianson et al. [1995] reported that
in African neonates with DS, craniofacial findings approximate
healthy African neonates more than is the case with Caucasians,

 supporting our digital facial analysis data (Supplementary Tables
SII–IV). The study by Christianson et al. was based on physician
exam findings of 40 neonate cases and 50 healthy controls. The data
obtained using facial analysis techniques, the subjective exam
findings of this study, and the medical literature support differ-
ences in ethnicities and highlight some of the challenges in diag-
nosing DS with only physical exam.
However, throughout the world, as noted above, DS often is
diagnosed with only physical exam findings. Facial analysis
technology for DS detection has proven to be both sensitive
and specific. When applied globally, we found the sensitivity to
be 96.1% and specificity to be 92.4% (Table II). The accuracy of
the technology increased significantly when applied to distinct
population groups (African, Asian, and Caucasian). The accuracy
of digital facial analysis technology is already well known [Zhao
et al., 2013, 2014a; Cerrolaza et al., 2016], and with the wide
spread availability of hand held devices throughout the world,
this study proposes the use of this technology across diverse
populations.
The ethical implications of associating genetic syndrome
with diverse populations are potentially a source of discon-
cert for some, especially when considering historical concerns
about the association of biological classifications and racial
and ethnic categories. These issues have been reviewed in depth
FIG. 6. Foot findings. Image numbers correspond with Supplementary Table I.
50
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A
 [Koretzky et al., 2016] and are considered beyond the scope of
this study.
There are a number of potential limitations to this study. One
challenge was studying individuals across a wide range of ages.
Facial features change with age as shown by Figure 7, and many
studies focus on a specific age range such as newborns. An inherent
weakness of any study of this type will be capturing the many
multitudes of different ethnicities and tribes found throughout the
world. Although this study encompasses many participants and
countries, it only represents a small fraction of the global popula-
tion. Additionally, much of the data of this study and others are
subjective and based on examiner judgment; for this reason, we
have employed digital facial analysis technology.
In conclusion, we have assembled a catalog of ethnically diverse
individuals with DS, summarized the medical literature pertaining
to
DS
and
diverse
populations,
and
conducted
objective
evaluation with digital facial analysis technology to demonstrate
the differences in facial features. Based on our study, we propose
and predict that digital facial analysis technologies will have
widespread applicability to not just Caucasians with DS, but to
those from diverse populations with DS and other conditions with
distinctive dysmorphic features.
