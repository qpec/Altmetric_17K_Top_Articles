 Out-of-Pocket Spending and Financial Burden
Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Cancer
Amol K. Narang, MD; Lauren Hersch Nicholas, PhD, MPP
IMPORTANCE Medicare beneficiaries with cancer are at risk for financial hardship given
increasingly expensive cancer care and significant cost sharing by beneficiaries.
OBJECTIVES To measure out-of-pocket (OOP) costs incurred by Medicare beneficiaries with
cancer and identify which factors and services contribute to high OOP costs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We prospectively collected survey data from 18 166
community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries, including 1409 individuals who were diagnosed
with cancer during the study period, who participated in the January 1, 2002, to December
31, 2012, waves of the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative panel study
of US residents older than 50 years. Data analysis was performed from July 1, 2014, to June
30, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Out-of-pocket medical spending and financial burden (OOP
expenditures divided by total household income).
RESULTS Among the 1409 participants (median age, 73 years [interquartile range, 69-79
years]; 46.4% female and 53.6% male) diagnosed with cancer during the study period, the
type of supplementary insurance was significantly associated with mean annual OOP costs
incurred after a cancer diagnosis ($2116 among those insured by Medicaid, $2367 among
those insured by the Veterans Health Administration, $5976 among those insured by a
Medicare health maintenance organization, $5492 among those with employer-sponsored
insurance, $5670 among those with Medigap insurance coverage, and $8115 among those
insured by traditional fee-for-service Medicare but without supplemental insurance
coverage). A new diagnosis of cancer or common chronic noncancer condition was associated
with increased odds of incurring costs in the highest decile of OOP expenditures (cancer:
adjusted odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.55-2.23; P < .001; chronic noncancer condition: adjusted
odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.69-1.97; P < .001). Beneficiaries with a new cancer diagnosis and
Medicare alone incurred OOP expenditures that were a mean of 23.7% of their household
income; 10% of these beneficiaries incurred OOP expenditures that were 63.1% of their
household income. Among the 10% of beneficiaries with cancer who incurred the highest
OOP costs, hospitalization contributed to 41.6% of total OOP costs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental insurance incur
significant OOP costs following a diagnosis of cancer. Costs associated with hospitalization
may be a primary contributor to these high OOP costs. Medicare reform proposals that
restructure the benefit design for hospital-based services and incorporate an OOP maximum
may help alleviate financial burden, as can interventions that reduce hospitalization in this
population.

 A
mong the 5 health conditions that contribute most to
health care costs in the United States, per-person di-
rect medical expenditures on cancer are the highest.1
Moreover, annual direct medical expenditures on cancer are
projected to increase by nearly 40% from 2010 to 2020, largely
owing to a combination of changing demographics, in-
creased use of services, and expensive new treatments.2 As
mostnewcancersandcancer-associateddeathsoccurinadults
older than 65 years, much of this cost burden will be borne by
Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the el-
derly and disabled.3
However, traditional Medicare also requires considerable
cost sharing from its beneficiaries and does not include an out-
of-pocket (OOP) maximum.4 Although supplemental cover-
age through Medigap, employer-sponsored insurance, or Med-
icaid can minimize OOP costs, considerable heterogeneity
exists in the design of benefits, placing seniors at variable fi-
nancial risk. Medicare beneficiaries who obtain their benefits
through a health maintenance organization (HMO) face simi-
lar variation in the design of benefits.4 Moreover, more than
4 million Medicare beneficiaries lack supplemental insur-
ance altogether and may be particularly vulnerable following
a major diagnosis, such as cancer.4 Indeed, reports have in-
creasingly documented the adverse consequences of cancer
on patients’financial well-being, including depleted savings
and even bankruptcy.5-7 Financial distress may also discour-
age use of effective services, including poor adherence to
key anticancer therapies.6-13 Protecting patients against the
“financial toxicity” of cancer has therefore become a central
objective of the oncology community.14-19
Ensuringthefinancialsecurityofelderlypatientswithcan-
cer requires an understanding of which patients experience
high OOP costs and what services contribute to these costs.
Prior work on this subject has been limited by older data and
exclusion of Medicare beneficiaries who receive their ben-
efits through an HMO, which now represents 30% of Medi-
care beneficiaries.20-22 In addition, there is limited informa-
tionontheservicecategoriesthatcontributetohighOOPcosts,
and existing comparisons of OOP costs across disease types
have included patients in a nursing home, whose high long-
term care costs dwarf other cost categories.23
We address these gaps by characterizing the distribution
of OOP costs incurred by a nationally representative cohort of
community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries. We also exam-
ine the variation in OOP costs based on types of supplemen-
tal insurance. Finally, we explore which services were primar-
ily responsible for imposing significant financial burden on the
beneficiaries who incurred the highest OOP costs.
Methods
Study Population
We analyzed survey data from the July 1, 2002, to December
31, 2012, waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a
nationally representative, longitudinal panel study of US
residents older than 50 years.24 The HRS is designed to col-
lect detailed health, demographic, and financial information
from its participants and includes data on their OOP medical
expenditures.25 Approximately 20 000 participants are
interviewed biennially, with response rates of more than
85% during the study period.26 Oral informed consent is
obtained from participants as part of the HRS process. Our
study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Hospital Institu-
tional Review Board.
The population included community-dwelling HRS par-
ticipants older than 65 years who were enrolled in either fee-
for-service Medicare or obtained Medicare benefits through
an HMO. Nursing home residents were excluded given their
distinct patterns of resource use compared with community-
dwelling Medicare beneficiaries.27 Participants with a new di-
agnosis of cancer were identified based on their first affirma-
tive response to the following question: “Has a doctor ever told
you that you have cancer or a malignant tumor, excluding mi-
norskincancer?”Thereporteddateofdiagnosiswasalsocross-
referenced with survey administration dates to confirm the in-
terval in which a cancer diagnosis was made. Subsequent
surveys from patients newly diagnosed with cancer were ex-
cluded from the analysis except for the HRS exit interview,
which was used to analyze the cost of end-of-life care. In ad-
dition, we used similar survey items to identify patients who
were diagnosed with 1 of the 5 most common nonaccidental
causes of mortality in the United States (ie, heart disease, lung
disease, stroke, dementia, and type 1 or 2 diabetes).28
OOP Expenditures
Our primary outcome of interest was the level of OOP expen-
ditures incurred by HRS participants between survey admin-
istrations. Since 2002, the HRS has collected detailed data on
OOP expenditures using the following cost categories: inpa-
tient hospitalization, nursing home, clinic visits with a physi-
cian, dental care, outpatient surgery, prescription drugs, home
healthcare,andotherhealthservices.Moreimportant,theHRS
did not provide respondents with explicit instructions on the
assignmenttoaspecificcostcategoryofradiationservices,che-
motherapy, or oral targeted anticancer agents.
For each cost category other than prescription drugs, HRS
participants are asked, “About how much did you pay out of
pocket for XX [since the last interview or in the last 2 years]?”
Key Points
Questions What are the out-of-pocket (OOP) costs incurred by
Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, and what factors and services
drive these high OOP costs?
Findings In this nationally representative panel study, Medicare
beneficiaries with a new cancer diagnosis were vulnerable to high
OOP costs depending on their supplemental insurance:
beneficiaries without supplemental insurance incurred OOP
expenditures that were a mean of 23.7% of their household
income, with 10% incurring OOP costs that were 63.1% of their
household income. Hospitalizations were a primary driver of these
high OOP costs.
Meaning Elderly patients with cancer need improved protection
against costly hospitalizations.

 For prescription drugs, participants are asked about OOP ex-
penditures in the month prior to the interview. Median time
between surveys was 2.0 years (interquartile range, 1.8-2.4
years). Out-of-pocket expenditures were normalized to an an-
nual scale, and values were adjusted to 2012 dollars.29
TheHRSusesaninnovativemethodofrandomentrybrack-
eting, in which nonrespondents sequentially refine an esti-
mated range of OOP expenditures (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment). For participants reporting expenditures within a
bracketed range, exact OOP expenditure values were imputed
using a method developed by the RAND Corporation, as de-
scribed elsewhere.30 Although 12 668 of the 61 339 responses
(20.7%) that were provided with respect to OOP expenditures
were not exact amounts, the bracketing approach minimized
complete nonresponse to any item to less than 5%.31
Income, Wealth, and Supplemental Insurance
Indexing OOP expenditures to financial well-being may allow
for a better estimate of financial distress. We calculated finan-
cial burden as OOP expenditures divided by total household
income.32,33 The HRS collects comprehensive data on house-
hold income and household wealth (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment). Components of household income and wealth were
summed for both the participant and spouse, if present. All in-
come and wealth measures are reported in 2012 dollars.29
To examine the association between participants’OOP ex-
pendituresandinsurancearrangements,participantswereclas-
sifiedinto1of6mutuallyexclusiveinsurancecategories,which
included 5 types of supplemental insurance arrangements for
patients enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, as well as a cat-
egory for patients in a Medicare HMO. In order of an expecta-
tion of increased cost sharing, these insurance categories in-
cluded Medicaid; Veterans Health Administration; Medicare
HMO; employer-sponsored insurance, including retiree and
spousal coverage; Medigap; and none.34 A simplified classifi-
cation schema was also used in which the Medicaid and Vet-
eransHealthAdministrationcategorieswerecombinedintothe
category of public supplemental insurance, and the employer-
sponsored and Medigap categories were consolidated into pri-
vate supplemental insurance.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed from July 1, 2014, to June 30,
2015. Baseline sociodemographic and health-associated char-
acteristics were compared between patients with and with-
out cancer using a 2-sample t test and χ2 test for continuous
and categorical variables, respectively. A multivariable gener-
alized linear model was constructed to assess mean OOP
expenditures using a log link function and gamma family dis-
tribution. Multivariable quantile regression was performed to
assess the median and 90th percentile of OOP expenditures.
Multivariable logistic regression was also performed to deter-
mine which factors were associated with incurring costs in
the highest decile of OOP expenditures. Models were
adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, mari-
tal status, geographic region, self-reported health, comorbid-
ity, smoking status, wealth quartile, and type of supplemen-
tal insurance. In addition, we accounted for potential
correlation within participant responses from multiple sur-
vey waves by clustering standard errors by participants’
unique identification number.
Out-of-pocket expenditures for HRS participants with can-
cer were compared with OOP expenditures among partici-
pantswithothercommondiseasetypesthatcontributetomor-
talityintheUnitedStates.28Comparisonswererepeatedwithin
patient subsets that were defined by type of supplemental in-
surance.Asimilarmethodwasusedforanalyzingfinancialbur-
den. In addition, the relative contribution of each OOP cost cat-
egory to total OOP costs was examined.
The HRS selects its participants using a complex, multi-
stage, area probability sampling design.35 Because the HRS
oversamples African Americans and Hispanics, sampling
weights are created such that the weighted HRS sample is rep-
resentative of community-dwelling US households. We ac-
counted for the complex sampling design by applying respon-
dent-level sampling weights in all calculations.
Throughout the analysis, 2-sided significance testing was
used, and P = .05 was considered statistically significant. All
statisticalanalyseswereperformedwithStata/ICsoftware,ver-
sion 10.0 (StataCorp).
Results
Atotalof18 166community-dwellingUSresidentsolderthan65
years participated in the HRS between 2002 and 2012 and were
enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare or received Medicare ben-
efitsthroughanHMO.Participantscompletedamedianof3sur-
vey waves (range, 1-6) and produced 61 339 observations.
During the study period, 1409 participants (7.8%) were
newly diagnosed with cancer (Table 1). Median time from can-
cer diagnosis to survey completion was 1.2 years (interquar-
tile range, 0.8-1.6 years). Compared with patients who did not
have cancer, HRS participants who were newly diagnosed with
cancer were more likely to be male (53.6% vs 43.4%; P < .001),
white (90.5% vs 87.9%; P = .001), non-Hispanic (96.1% vs
93.2%; P < .001), married (63.2% vs 59.2%; P = .01), and re-
porthigherself-assessedhealthstatus(goodtoexcellenthealth,
76.2% vs 61.4%; P < .001) despite more frequently indicating
a history of heart (32.8% vs 30.1%; P = .05) or lung (14.9% vs
10.9%; P < .001) disease. Although patients with cancer gen-
erally belonged to higher wealth (third and fourth quartiles,
57.0% vs 48.8%; P = .001) and income quartiles (third and
fourth quartiles, 53.6% vs 49.1%; P = .002), substantial hetero-
geneity in wealth and income was present. Patients with can-
cer who were in lower wealth and income quartiles more com-
monly had Medicaid coverage or lacked supplemental
insurance and less commonly had employer-sponsored or
Medigap supplemental insurance (P < .001 for all; eTable 1 in
theSupplement)comparedwithpatientswithcancerwhowere
in higher wealth and income quartiles.
Mean annual OOP expenditures was $3737 and financial
burden was 11.4% for all HRS participants. The distributions
of OOP expenditures and financial burden were right-
skewed: at the 90th percentile, annual OOP expenditures were
$8078 and financial burden was 29.6%. A new diagnosis of

95% CI, 1.55-2.23; P < .001; chronic noncancer condition: AOR,
1.82; 95% CI, 1.69-1.97; P < .001) (Table 2) compared with other
HRS participants. Likewise, HRS participants with private
supplemental insurance, without supplemental insurance, or
who obtained Medicare benefits through an HMO all had in-
creased odds of incurring costs that were in the highest decile
of OOP expenditures compared with participants with Med-
icaid or Veterans Health Administration coverage (Medicare

2.86; 95% CI, 2.48-3.29; P < .001). Similar associations were
seen with financial burden (Table 2).
Adjusted OOP expenditures for HRS participants newly di-
agnosed with cancer were compared with adjusted OOP ex-
penditures for HRS participants newly diagnosed with com-

tures were similar between disease types for the overall co-
hort, mean OOP expenditures in participants lacking supple-
mental insurance were significantly higher for cancer than for
other disease types.

enced significantly higher mean annual OOP expenditures

 Medicaid coverage. Similarly, patients without supplemental
insurance experienced the greatest financial burden, spend-
ing a mean of 23.7% of their total annual household income
on OOP expenditures (Table 3). At the 90th percentile, pa-
tientslackingsupplementalinsurancespent63.1%oftheirtotal
annual household income on OOP expenditures.
Amongpatientswithcancer,OOPcostsfrominpatienthos-
pitalization exceeded OOP costs from other service catego-
ries. More important, inpatient hospitalization was the pri-
mary driver of high OOP expenditures in patients with cancer,
representing 42% of total OOP expenditures for patients with
OOP costs in the highest decile. The Figure illustrates the con-
tribution of individual OOP cost categories to total OOP costs
for patients with cancer, stratified by type of supplemental in-
surance.Out-of-pocketcostsfrominpatienthospitalizationvar-
ied significantly depending on type of supplemental insur-
ance, ranging from 12% of total OOP costs for patients with
Medicaid or Veterans Health Administration coverage to 46%
for patients lacking supplemental insurance. A total of 380 pa-
tients with cancer (27.0%) reported multiple inpatient hospi-
talizations during the survey interval in which they were di-
agnosed, but there was no difference in hospitalizations based
oninsuranceclassification(65of227patients[28.6%]withpub-
lic supplemental insurance; 64 of 251 patients [25.5%] with
Medicare HMO; 200 of 744 patients [26.9%] with private
supplemental insurance; and 51 of 187 patients [27.3%] with
no supplemental insurance). Out-of-pocket costs from other
service categories also varied based on supplementary insur-
ancetype,butthedifferenceswerefarlesspronounced(eTable
3 in the Supplement).
Since medical expenditures associated with cancer care
generally follow a U-shaped pattern, with the highest expen-
ditures occurring after initial diagnosis and at the end of life,
we also analyzed OOP expenditures at the end of life.36 Spe-
cifically, we measured OOP expenditures incurred in the pe-
riod between the last survey administration and date of death
for 1489 participants who either died of cancer between 2002
and2012orwereactivelyreceivingcancertreatmentattheend
of life (eTable 4 in the Supplement). As the median time from
the last survey administration to date of death was 1.3 years
(interquartilerange,0.8-1.9years),OOPexpenditureswerenor-
malized to an annual scale. Findings in decedents with can-
cer were similar to those newly diagnosed; decedents with
cancer who were lacking supplemental insurance experi-
enced the highest level of OOP expenditures at the end of life
(eTable5intheSupplement),andinpatienthospitalizationwas
the primary contributor to high OOP costs at the end of life
(eFigure in the Supplement).
Discussion
A new diagnosis of cancer imposes significant financial strain
on community-dwelling, fee-for-service Medicare beneficia-
ries who lack supplemental insurance. Nearly 10% of elderly
patients with Medicare alone spent more than 60% of their an-
nual household income on OOP expenditures following a di-
agnosis of cancer. More important, costs associated with in-
patient hospitalization accounted for approximately 40% of
total OOP expenditures in patients with cancer who had high
OOP costs, including more than 40% of total OOP expendi-
tures in patients with cancer who had Medicare alone; ben-
eficiaries with supplemental coverage were generally pro-
tected from high hospital-associated OOP costs. Similar
patterns of OOP costs were seen in Medicare beneficiaries who
died of cancer.
Inpatient hospitalization represents the largest compo-
nent of Medicare spending on cancer, both in the initial phase
of treatment as well as at the end of life, and is a primary source
of regional variation.37,38 Although our study was limited by
the HRS cost category definitions in its attribution of costs, our
results illustrate that inpatient hospitalization may also con-
tribute significantly to high OOP spending in elderly patients
with cancer, both at the initial diagnosis and at the end of life,
supporting efforts to reduce hospital-associated costs among
patients with cancer.39-49

 duced rates of hospitalization in patients undergoing cancer
therapy. Among those treated with radiotherapy, for in-
stance, the mean number of patients who were hospitalized
during their course of radiotherapy or within 60 days there-
after decreased from 35 per month to 18 per month following
the opening of the oncology-specific urgent care clinic. More
important, 35 of 352 hospitalizations (9.9%) during this time
resulted in patient liabilities in excess of $2000; among Medi-
carebeneficiarieswithoutsupplementalinsurance,4of39hos-
pitalization-associated patient liabilities (10.3%) exceeded
$10 000.
Beyond highlighting the need for innovative initiatives for
deliveryofcare,thehighlevelofhospital-associatedOOPcosts
mayalsodemonstratepotentialadverseconsequencesofMedi-
care’
s current design of benefits. For 2016, Medicare’
s deduct-
ible for Part B services is $166, while its Part A hospital-stay
deductibleis$1288per90-daybenefitperiod.50Assigningben-
eficiaries such a high responsibility of cost sharing for inpa-
tient care may not be an effective use of cost sharing, as hos-
pitalizations are usually not at the discretion of beneficiaries.
In the HRS cohort, for example, the frequency of hospitaliza-
tion did not vary with insurance status. Instead, a unified de-
ductible for all medical services may be a more prudent ar-
rangement and is a feature of several proposals for Medicare
reform.51-54 More important, these proposals also stipulate an
annual maximum on OOP expenditures, another key reform
to protect seniors against catastrophic costs.51-54 As an ex-
ample, 73 of 187 patients (39.0%) with cancer in the HRS co-
hort with Medicare alone experienced OOP costs in excess of
the $5500 OOP limit specified in a Congressional Budget Of-
fice plan.51
Limitations
Although our study has many strengths, important limitations
must be acknowledged. Foremost, OOP expenditure data were
based on patient self-report, which is subject to recall bias. Sur-
veydataarealsosubjecttomisclassificationandincompletere-
porting, although the latter is minimized by the HRS bracket-
ing approach. More important, granular detail on specific
services that contributed to OOP costs was limited by the HRS-
defined cost categories, and variability in the manner in which
costs were assigned by participants may have existed. For ex-
ample, OOP costs from outpatient radiotherapy services were
presumablyassignedbyparticipantstothecategoryofclinicvis-
its with a physician, but this categorization cannot be verified.
In addition, variability in site of chemotherapy administration
likely resulted in its assignment to multiple categories, with in-
patient administration of intravenous chemotherapy, for ex-
ample, likely included in the category of inpatient hospitaliza-
tion.ThispossibilitymayexplainthehighOOPcostsforinpatient
admission found in this study. Furthermore, limited informa-
tion on tumor type and stage prevented further stratification
by these key variables. As such, future research to define spe-
cifictumor-associatedand/ortreatment-associatedservicesthat
contribute to OOP costs should be conducted, perhaps through
collaborations with payers that track OOP costs. Moreover, we
did not have information on length of stay, including observa-
tion status, which can expose beneficiaries to high OOP costs
and was becoming increasingly prevalent during the study
period.55,56Inaddition,whileourfindingsinpatientswholacked
supplementary insurance more broadly reflect the financial ef-
fect of cost sharing, Medigap and employer-sponsored insur-
ance plans vary in their generosity of benefits, which we were
notabletoincorporateintoouranalysis.Furthermore,ourdata
cannotbeextrapolatedtothenonelderlyandnursinghomeresi-
dents, who were excluded from the study, although our find-
ings may still have implications for younger Americans consid-
eringlessgeneroushealthexchangeplansthatrequiresignificant
cost sharing. In addition, our comparisons of the OOP costs
between cancer and other chronic conditions assume similar
U-shaped cost curves, the applicability of which is unclear for
patients with newly diagnosed chronic conditions. Further-
more, the distribution of types of supplemental insurance may
not reflect current conditions, particularly with respect to em-
ployer-sponsored insurance, as retiree benefits are less gener-
ous now than at the beginning of the study period. Finally, our
measure for OOP expenditures did not include premiums, an
important component of total OOP spending.
Conclusions
Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental insurance in-
cur significant financial burden following a diagnosis of can-
cer. More important, inpatient hospitalization may represent
a key contributor to high OOP costs. Proposals for Medicare re-
form that restructure the design of benefits for hospital ser-
vices and incorporate an OOP maximum may help alleviate the
risk of financial burden for future beneficiaries, as can inter-
ventions that reduce hospitalizations in this population.

Invited Commentary
Mitigating Financial Toxicity Among US Patients With Cancer
Jonas A. de Souza, MD, MBA; Rena M. Conti, PhD
Treatment for cancer is undergoing a renaissance. However,
the “financial toxicity” of cancer treatment for US patients and
their families is a growing concern.1 Financial distress among
patients with cancer includes high out-of-pocket (OOP) spend-
ing relative to income and assets, loss of work, and signifi-
canthouseholddebt.Financialdistressisassociatedwithgrow-
ing reports of delayed initiation of treatment, limited patient
adherence, and abandonment of recommended treatment,
which erodes the effectiveness of cancer treatment and even
hastens death.
The study by Narang and Nicholas2 in this issue of JAMA
Oncology fills some important gaps in our current understand-
ing of financial distress among patients with cancer. The au-
thors use national data from 1409 patients with cancer eli-
gible for Medicare insurance coverage and surveyed by the
Health and Retirement Study between 2002 and 2012. Narang
and Nicholas2 estimate inflation-adjusted annual OOP spend-
ing following a cancer diagnosis and patients’financial bur-
den, defined as the ratio of OOP spending to household in-
come,overallandstratifiedby
the existence and type of
supplemental insurance cov-
erage.Theauthorsreportthat
themeanannualOOPspendingandfinancialburdenamounted
to $3737 and 11.4%, respectively. Higher OOP spending was as-
sociated with less generous supplemental insurance cover-
age; $2116 among those insured by Medicaid, $2367 among
those insured by the Veterans Health Administration, $5976
among those insured by a Medicare health maintenance
organization,$5670amongthosewithMedigapinsurancecov-
erage, and $8115 among those insured by traditional fee-
for-service Medicare but without supplemental insurance cov-
erage. Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with cancer
with no supplemental insurance coverage incurred mean OOP
spending amounting to 23.7% of their household income. Ten
percent of these individuals incurred OOP spending amount-
ing to 63.1% of their household income.
These results suggest that physicians and policy makers
should be particularly concerned about potential financial dis-
tress experienced by Medicare beneficiaries without supple-
mental insurance coverage or underinsured by existing poli-
cies. This is an important finding given that the number of
underinsured US patients—those covered by high-deductible
health plans and plans requiring patients to pay coinsurance
(a percentage of a medical charge), rather than copayments (a
flat fee), when care is provided—is growing. Monthly income
forseniorsderivedfromSocialSecuritybenefitpaymentsalone
has also stagnated since the Great Recession. This finding also
suggests that the development of tools aimed at helping pa-
tients navigate the financial consequences of their cancer di-
agnosis and treatment may be particularly fruitful when tar-
geted to underinsured individuals. Relief is likely to come in
the form of value-based insurance design or other refine-
ments to existing insurance policies.3,4
This study also raises 3 priority areas for future research
aimed at helping formulate interventions to prevent or miti-
gate financial distress among patients with cancer. First, more
research is needed about which care components induce fi-
nancial distress and for which patients. Much recent empha-
sishasbeenplacedonpatientfinancialdistressassociatedwith
newanticancerdrugs,5whileotherstudieshavesuggestedthat
nonpharmaceutical care components may also be important
contributorstopatientfinancialtoxicity.Forexample,deSouza
et al6 suggest that patients with cancer experiencing 3 or more
admissions to the hospital in a given year self-report high fi-
nancial distress, when measured by the validated COmpre-
hensive Score for Financial Toxicity instrument. Narang and
Nicholas2 also report that patient financial toxicity appears to
be concentrated among inpatient costs incurred with cancer
treatment.Althoughthisfindingisprovocative,significantdata
limitations prevented them from distinguishing between OOP
spending associated with hospital inpatient stays from OOP
spending associated with chemotherapy administered in the
inpatient and outpatient settings. Data limitations also pro-
hibited Narang and Nicholas2 from attributing financial bur-
den to care undergone by patients with specific types or
stages of cancer or receiving specific lines of therapy. This limi-
tation is important for future research to examine since care
componentsmaydiffersubstantiallyacrosstypesofcancerand
existing insurance benefits can act to shield patients from fi-
nancial distress associated with specific care components but
not others.
