1.6 Abstract  
Variation in stillbirth rates across high-income countries (HIC) and large equity gaps within HIC 
persist. If all HIC achieved stillbirth rates equal to the best performing countries, 19,439 late 
gestation stillbirths could have been avoided in 2015. Unexplained stillbirths remain high and can be 
addressed through improvements in data collection, investigation and classification, and better 
understanding of causal pathways. Substandard care contributes to 20-30% of all stillbirths, and the 
contribution is even higher for late-gestation intrapartum stillbirths. National perinatal mortality 
audit programmes need to be implemented across all HIC. Reducing stigma and fatalism around 
stillbirth and improving bereavement care are also clear, ongoing priorities for action. In HIC, a child 
has twice the risk of being stillborn due to adverse socioeconomic circumstances. Community- and 
country-level programs to improve health among disadvantaged families are needed to address 
these inequities.

1.8 Key messages  
 
Late gestation stillbirth rates vary across HIC from 1.3 to 8.8/1000 births, showing that 
further reduction in stillbirths is possible. Setting and monitoring targets in all HIC are 
important for reducing preventable stillbirths. 
 
 
Socially marginalised and disadvantaged women often have twice or more the risk of 
stillbirth. Social determinants of maternal and fetal wellbeing should be monitored in all HIC, 
and addressed through education and alleviation of poverty, as well as better access to 
health care, especially timely, culturally appropriate antenatal care.  
 
 
Stigma and fatalism continue to exacerbate trauma for families and impede progress in 
stillbirth prevention. Stronger parent and care provider partnerships are needed to dispel 
misperceptions and negative attitudes that persist in communities.  
 
 
It is the responsibility of all countries to implement high quality national perinatal mortality 
audit that translates into improvements in quality of care. Key performance indicators of 
quality maternity care should be measured and reported, with the aim of eliminating 
substandard antepartum and intrapartum care - too often present when a stillbirth occurs.  
 
 
Bereavement care commonly fails to meet the needs of parents, often with devastating 
consequences. Immediate bereavement care should be provided by appropriately trained 
health care professionals with sensitive and seamless transition to community support 
services in all settings.  
 
 
Poor quality data on stillbirths is a major problem across HIC. Access to high quality 
investigation into the causes of stillbirth, including autopsy and placental histopathology by 
a skilled perinatal pathologist, should be made available to all parents following stillbirth. 
Consensus on a classification system for stillbirth, which addresses the contribution of 
placental pathology, and standard a definition for reporting stillbirths that makes it possible 
to report comparable early and late stillbirth rates across HIC are needed. 
 
 
Future research must focus on stillbirth prediction, understanding placental pathways to 
stillbirth and causal pathways to unexplained stillbirth. Effective strategies to reduce the 
prevalence of obesity and smoking in women of reproductive ages are needed. 
Understanding pathways leading to early stillbirth and spontaneous preterm birth at early 
gestation is also important to pursue.

1.9 Introduction 
As stated across this Series, stillbirth rate is a key indicator of women’s health and quality of care in 
pregnancy and childbirth.1, 2 While high income country (HIC) rates are relatively low compared with 
low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), stillbirth is a major health burden with rates over double 
neonatal mortality rates,3 and often equal to all deaths in the first year.4 Neonatal death rates 
continue to fall,4 whereas stillbirth rates remain steady, and have increased in some regions.5 The 
death of any child is a tragedy for families, often with profound, long-lasting psychosocial and 
economic impact.6 The 2011 Lancet Stillbirth Series (LSS) drew attention to the slow progress in 
reducing rates across HIC and highlighted prevention.7 In this fourth paper of the Lancet’s Ending 
Preventable Stillbirths series, we summarise the current status of stillbirths in HIC, and present 
strategies to maintain momentum in reducing deaths and meeting parents’ needs when their child is 
stillborn.  
1.10 Methods  
We used the range of methods described in Panel 1 with further details provided in the 
webappendix. We also assessed HIC stillbirth rates and annual rate reductions (ARR) from 2000 to 
2015 (Blencowe and colleagues).8 
1.11 Stillbirth rates – Is progress good enough?  
The latest global estimates8 show an average stillbirth rate (using the 28 weeks’ gestation definition) 
across 49 HIC of 3.5 per 1000 total births. Country-specific rates varied widely from 1.3 to 8.8 (Figure 
1). The ARR from 2000 to 2015 varied, with nine countries demonstrating ARRs of <1%, and five 
countries >4%.  Cross-country comparisons are hindered by data capture issues including reporting 
practices for termination of pregnancy after the gestational age threshold, variation in data capture 
mechanisms including the use of cross-linkages between birth and death certificate data and birth 
registry data, and variation in definitions for reporting.8 Use of the WHO recommended lower 
gestational age limit of 28 weeks likely reduces the influence of these issues on reported rates. 
Regardless of data capture issues, real epidemiological variation in rates is present,9 and shows 
  
 
7 
 
further reduction is possible.  Stillbirth rates for disadvantaged groups are around double those of 
greater advantage,3, 10-12 with recent evidence indicating these gaps can be narrowed.10  While 
intrapartum stillbirths comprise a small proportion (<10%) across HIC, variability in this indicator is 
also evident, as presented by Lawn and colleagues.9 Nonetheless, it is important that countries 
monitor and understand their own temporal trends rather than assess performance based on 
rankings with other countries. 
As shown in Figure 1, 6 of 49 countries (12%) demonstrated third trimester rates of 2.0/1000 births 
or lower, showing that this is achievable. If all countries had achieved a stillbirth rate <2.0, in 2015, 
19,439 late gestation stillbirths could have been avoided.  
1.11.1 Early gestation stillbirth 
Depending on definition, 35%13 to 50%14 of HIC stillbirths occur below the WHO recommended cut-
off for international comparison of 1000 g (or 28 weeks).13 Due to variability in definitions (e.g. 
inclusion of terminations), comparisons of early gestation stillbirth rates between and even within 
countries are difficult. When crude stillbirths rates were compared, Sweden ranked 3rd and Australia 
28th in a comparison of 28 HICs , but Sweden dropped to 10th and Australia improved to 11th when 
rank was based on stillbirths >1000 g.15 Under-reporting of stillbirths <28 weeks is also evident in 
some regions.3 Ascertainment may be influenced by perceptions of viability.8 Despite these 
difficulties, stillbirth rates <28 weeks’ in HIC are not falling, and some increases are evident.5, 13, 14, 16 
In Canada, pregnancy terminations for congenital anomalies at 20-23 weeks gestation explain the 
increasing stillbirth rate.5  In the USA, spontaneous preterm birth at early gestations made a 
significant contribution to higher stillbirth rates in black non-Hispanic women.17 Thus, in HIC, 
stillbirths at <28 weeks comprise an important component of all adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
particularly among some racial/ethnic groups. 
1.11.2 Perceptions of stillbirth – Are they holding back progress? 
Fatalism and stigma around stillbirth persist in HIC, both across communities and in the healthcare 
workforce (as reported in the LSS).18 In the International Stillbirth Alliance (ISA) surveys (see Panel 1 
  
 
8 
 
for methods), 2 in 3 respondents felt their community believed that most stillbirths are not 
preventable (Figure 2). Around 1 in 2 parents felt their community believed that “parents should not 
talk about their stillborn baby because it makes people feel uncomfortable”. One parent said “…many 
women told me that my son's death was likely ‘nature taking care of mistakes’”. Perceptions and 
actions that denigrate grief, dismiss the significance of a stillborn child, or support notions that a 
child was “never supposed to live”, are harmful to bereaved parents and devalue efforts towards 
prevention.18 Parent organisations provide powerful mechanisms to challenge stigma and fatalism 
around stillbirth (“Parents bringing about change”, webappendix). 
1.12 Factors leading to stillbirth  
1.12.1 Risk factors - Are we sufficiently aware? 
Risk factors including demographic and lifestyle factors and medical/pregnancy conditions were 
reported in the LSS7. In the ISA survey of care providers, we asked respondents to select 10 out of 23 
risk factors and associated conditions they believed posed the highest risk. We present the survey 
rankings alongside the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) as reported in the LSS19 and recent systematic 
reviews (Figure 1, webappendix).20-22 Perceptions were generally consistent with the evidence, but 
care providers underestimated of the risks of advanced maternal age (>35 years), IVF, and multiple 
gestations, and overestimated of the risk of preeclampsia, smoking and substance misuse.   
Risks associated with maternal obesity were also underestimated. In the survey of community 
members, 72% (n=1113) rated community awareness of overweight and obesity as very low to 
moderate (Figure 2, webappendix). With increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, 
interventions to increase the number of women beginning pregnancy with a normal body weight are 
critically important to improving pregnancy outcomes and longer-term health. Modelling of a large 
Canadian cohort indicates a 10% decrease in pregnancy BMI could decrease stillbirth risk by 10%.23 
However, targeting behavioural change alone fails to recognise the complexity of this problem, 
resulting in ineffective interventions and added stigma for women who are overweight.24 Antenatal 
  
 
9 
 
care that “problematises” women by focusing on weight rather than a healthy pregnancy can 
produce feelings of embarrassment, guilt and shame,25, 26 leading women to avoid or delay care.   
1.12.2 Classification of causes – Where do we need to focus? 
Despite the call in the LSS for a uniform approach to the definition and classification of stillbirths,27  a 
recent systematic review of causes of stillbirth globally28 showed continued use of disparate 
approaches across HIC (Table 4, webappendix), rendering interpretation difficult. Despite this, 
placental pathologies were clearly important, accounting for around 50% of stillbirths in systems 
designed to capture them. Wide variation was shown in capture and definition of these pathologies, 
consistent with a recent review.29 The contribution of other important factors varied widely; 
congenital abnormalities ranged from 6-33%; infection 2-22%; and spontaneous preterm 
birth/preterm ruptured membranes (PROM) 1-14%. In one high quality study, spontaneous preterm 
birth/PROM was a key factor in 41% of stillbirths <28 weeks.17  
Studies using hierarchical approaches showed higher proportions of FGR30 and congenital 
abnormalities,11, 14 depending on the system used. The categories “Other unspecified” and 
“Unexplained” showed the widest variation and highest proportions; up to 76% and 53% 
respectively.  
1.12.3 Diagnostic tests for finding the cause of stillbirth 
 
The evidence for many routinely performed stillbirth investigations is limited. While ongoing studies 
in the Netherlands and Australia will help to address this, the value of placental histopathology, 
autopsy, and genetic analysis is clear.31, 32  Nonetheless, in the ISA parent survey (n=3503), almost 
one quarter reported not being counselled or given information about autopsy. Failure to offer 
autopsy denies parents a chance to understand the cause of their baby’s death, increases the 
proportion of unexplained stillbirths, and hinders the effectiveness of subsequent audit. A critical 
shortage of perinatal pathologists also hampers efforts.33, 34 Such a shortage was shown in our 
surveys, where only 26% of care providers reported that autopsies were performed or supervised by 
perinatal or paediatric pathologists. Resources continue to be diverted away from perinatal 
  
 
10 
 
pathology,33, 35 despite stillbirths and neonatal deaths outnumbering deaths from cancer.9, 36 In our 
survey of care providers, only 33% reported that autopsy was routinely performed upon consent 
(Figure 3, webappendix). Parental consent and cost were frequently cited barriers to investigations 
(Figure 4, webappendix), despite evidence that identifying the cause of stillbirth may reduce costs in 
subsequent pregnancies. As stated by Heazell and colleagues,6 the cost of care for subsequent 
pregnancies following stillbirth with an assigned cause is less than for women whose stillbirths were 
of unknown cause.37  
Changes in diagnostic testing may lead to revisions of causes of stillbirths. Chromosomal microarray 
is now preferred to karyotype since it overcomes the problem of non-viable tissue. Microarrays also 
identify abnormalities, such as microdeletions and microduplications, that are not identified by 
karyotyping.38 However, adoption of diagnostic advances is slow, with 30% of care providers from the 
ISA survey unsure how frequently microarray was performed; only 4% indicated that microarray was 
routine. Whichever test is used, it is important to have a perinatal pathology service to determine 
phenotype to assess the significance of newly described genetic variations.39, 40 
1.12.4 Addressing data quality in causes of stillbirth  
Classification of cause of death in stillbirth needs to be standardised, especially with regard to 
placental pathology. Collective agreement of definitions of placental lesions and their significance is 
also needed. Although the same lesions may be seen in stillbirths and in livebirths, high quality 
studies suggest that specific placental lesions are significantly more common in cases of stillbirth.41 
This is also true for other “causes” of stillbirth. In a recent review, not a single classification systems 
met the criteria of a quality system.42 Development of the WHO’s International Classification of 
Diseases Perinatal Mortality (ICD-PM), presented in a commentary to this series,43 aims to address 
this. While HIC are likely to continue with detailed classification based on sophisticated diagnostics 
not accessible in LMIC, approaches must be consistent with the ICD-PM system, and HIC must reach 
consensus on such a system. Underpinning accurate data on causes is the availability of thorough 
  
 
11 
 
history and diagnostic testing. Standardised perinatal death datasets are essential. Such datasets are 
in place nationally in The UK, Ireland and New Zealand, and under pilot-testing in Australia. 
1.13 Understanding and tackling disparities in stillbirth risk 
Disparities reflect larger systems of structural inequality, including racism and systematic inequities 
in opportunities and power.44 Consequently, health disparities reflect social and political 
determinants rather than biological origin.45, 46 Within HIC, stillbirth rates for disadvantaged groups 
are often double those of more advantaged groups, and are likely to be underestimated, as health 
disparities are often only measured by comparing the most advantaged with the least advantaged.47 
The relationship between stillbirth and social disadvantage is complex, with probable links across 
preconception, pregnancy pathways and risk factors (Figure 3).  
1.13.1 Access to, and quality of, antenatal and maternity care 
Disadvantaged women are less likely to receive adequate antenatal care.48 Access to, and quality of 
antenatal care also differs by populations served,49 and amongst ethnicities.50 There are clear and 
specific circumstances where differential access or uptake of services contributes to disparities. 
These include antenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination for congenital anomalies; timely 
diagnosis and treatment of preeclampsia; and labour induction for post-term pregnancy. Rural-urban 
differences in access to services are also likely to contribute, especially among vulnerable 
populations in remote areas.51, 52 Institutionalised racism is commonly reported by women accessing 
antenatal care.53  
1.13.2 Beyond health care delivery 
Health disparities are only partly explained by disparities in maternity care.47 Complex social 
determinants, termed “causes of the causes”, include: poverty; experiences of discrimination; 
incarceration; addiction; chronic stress; inadequate education, child care, employment, 
transportation, and living conditions.54 Intimate partner violence,55 mental health issues,56 and the 
cumulative impact of stressful “life events”57 are also hidden but potent risks. In a systematic review 
  
 
12 
 
of nearly 1,000,000 births in The UK from 1993-2005, stillbirth rates were 1.5-2 fold greater between 
the highest and lowest area deprivation quintiles.58, 59   
In a recent study, women migrating to HIC had stillbirth rates double host country averages, 
particularly when their country of birth was a humanitarian source country.60 Adjusted for age, 
parity, socioeconomic status and BMI, these differences disappeared,60 suggesting ethnicity may not 
always be a pathway to increased stillbirth. However, disparities in pregnancy outcomes continue 
between women of differing racial or ethnic background accessing the same healthcare services.61-63 
Stillbirth rates for women of South Asian and African origin giving birth in Europe or Australia are 2-3 
times higher than those of Caucasian women.61-63 The challenge is to understand why, and how we 
can manage the excess risk of stillbirth correlated with ethnicity within routine and comprehensive 
antenatal care. 
1.13.3 Addressing disparity 
To understand and address socioeconomic disparities in stillbirth, it is critical that all HIC monitor and 
report SES in vital statistics.12 Maternal education is one relevant and feasible indicator for within-
country and cross-country comparisons.12 Across 19 European countries with a median population 
attributable risk of 26% (IQR 16 to 31), Zeitlin and colleagues showed 1,606 out of 6,447 stillbirths 
would not have occurred in 2010 if rates for all women were the same as for women with post-
secondary education. School completion for pregnant women could therefore have a substantial 
impact on reducing disparities. Structural issues such as housing, employment and food security 
policies must also be addressed.  
Antenatal care, home visiting services and financing of contraceptive services are examples of 
interventions with capacity to address reproductive health strategies64 and therefore to prevent 
stillbirths. Universal service platforms should be supplemented with efforts to engage vulnerable 
populations, including outreach strategies and transportation to health services. In 2011 we 
nominated quality, accessible, culturally responsive and appropriate preconception care among 
priorities to reduce disparity.7 Improving preconception care remains an enormous challenge. 
  
 
13 
 
Innovative community programs addressing refugee maternal and child health inequalities65 and 
antenatal care programs involving partnerships between midwives and Aboriginal health workers are 
underway in Australia.66, 67 Universally, women whose first language differs from dominant national 
languages should be offered care and information in their own language,68 with choice of interpreter 
gender.65 The US Affordable Care Act will provide services such as free contraception, screening for 
infections and alcohol and smoking cessation programs.69  
1.14 Quality of care 
1.14.1 Uptake of interventions in stillbirth prevention  
Through the ISA survey of care providers we assessed uptake and perceived barriers to 
implementation of LSS recommended interventions in stillbirth prevention (Figures 5 and 6, 
webappendix). Only 60% of respondents said they always provided smoking cessation advice. The 
most frequently cited barriers were lack of time and/or resources (20%) and acceptance to women 
(35%). Only 36% said they always provided culturally-appropriate care, with lack of time and/or 
resources the most common barrier (17%). Serial fundal height measurements were performed not 
at all or only sometimes by 14%, with 10% identifying lack of evidence as a barrier. Most providers 
said they always or mostly used early ultrasound assessment of gestational age (83%), with cost and 
acceptance to women cited as barriers by around 12%. Screening for gestational diabetes at 28 
weeks was always or mostly performed by 77%, with 12% citing acceptance by women as a barrier. 
Use of Doppler velocimetry in high-risk pregnancies had reasonably high usage (68%), with lack of 
evidence (11%) and cost (9%) the most frequently cited barriers. The least commonly used 
intervention (used always or mostly by 43%) was low dose aspirin for high-risk pregnancies, with 13% 
reporting lack of evidence as a barrier. Low dose aspirin and heparins have been used to improve 
placental function and decrease stillbirth, but a high number needed to treat (aspirin) and uncertain 
efficacy has prevented widespread adoption of these interventions.70 While evidence is limited, 
preconception care is a potentially valuable intervention in stillbirth prevention, yet only 28% of care 
  
 
14 
 
providers said that preconception care for women with risk factors was performed mostly/always in 
their facilities. 
1.14.2 Antenatal and bereavement care - Information, communication and support  
In addition to clinical care, quality maternity care incorporates interpersonal and emotional aspects 
of care.71 Since stillbirth is an indicator of quality care, women’s experiences of care around stillbirth 
can be considered an indicator of quality of care processes. Just as actions can be taken to prevent 
stillbirth, actions can be taken to prevent adverse psychosocial outcomes following stillbirth and, in 
both instances, suboptimal interpersonal care can undermine even the best clinical care and produce 
harm (see Heazell and colleagues).6 The ISA surveys asked parents and care providers eight questions 
designed to capture components of quality care consistently identified as important to women 
(webappendix). The data (Figure 7, webappendix) show that care providers viewed various aspects of 
care more positively than bereaved parents. At least 4 in 5 providers (83-95%), but only 3 in 5 
parents (54-70%), considered these aspects of quality care to be present always or most of the time. 
Not spending enough time with parents in antepartum care was a point of agreement for parents 
and care providers. Critically, more than one-third of parents believed their concerns were not taken 
seriously or felt not listened to, either before or after their baby was stillborn.   
Ratings of information-provision and parental involvement in decision-making after stillbirth were 
lower for parents and care providers alike compared with before stillbirth, underscoring the 
challenge of providing quality bereavement care. Parents’ views of the comprehensibility of 
information were also less positive; barely half felt the time spent with care providers was adequate. 
Many of the questions parents had at this time could be readily answered and procedures to answer 
such questions would be easy to implement (Panel 1, webappendix). Missed opportunities to answer 
parents’ questions might be avoided by measures that recognise parents’ need to know more about 
their child.  
These survey findings corroborate the results of a systematic review on parents’ and care providers’ 
experiences of bereavement care.72 Care providers were found to “hide” behind ritualising guidelines 
  
 
15 
 
and checklists; they were frequently not trained to expect and manage parents’ reactions and 
individual needs. In our survey of care providers, only 23% reported being satisfied with training 
opportunities in bereavement care at their facility, and 30% had no opportunities. As found in the 
meta-analysis, care providers urgently need emotional, knowledge and system-based support, and 
training in verbal and non-verbal communication skills.  
1.14.3 Addressing quality of care 
Stillbirth prevention requires emphasis on quality maternity care that is respectful of a woman’s 
rights and tailored to her needs.71 Quality can be improved through better communication and 
information-provision, and timely delivery of evidence-based interventions. Quality bereavement 
care must also be emphasised, with greater access to training a crucial first step. Maternity units 
must decide whether this is best accomplished via training and certification of competencies for all 
staff, or whether to assign the role of bereavement support to a dedicated group. Access to clinical 
practice guidelines is imperative, but active implementation and evaluation are required.73 The UK 
provides an extensive range of national clinical guidelines acknowledging every aspect of the key 
messages of the LSS HIC paper but, for other HIC with a high stillbirth burden, such resources are far 
less comprehensive (webappendix). Publically available reports of maternal satisfaction with care 
and other indicators of women’s maternity care experiences should be developed, as done in 
Queensland, Australia,74 New Zealand75 and across The UK.76 Audit and feedback and benchmarking 
programs that include explicit targets for change and suggestions for how change can be achieved 
are also effective.77 
1.14.4 Perinatal mortality audit - Why and how? 
Perinatal audit has been described as: “The systematic, critical analysis of the quality of perinatal 
care, including the procedures used for diagnosis and treatment, the use of resources and the 
resultant outcome and quality of life for women and their babies”.78 Audits in the Netherlands,79 The 
UK80 and New Zealand11 show substandard care factors are present in an unacceptably high 
proportion of cases (20-30%, and up to 60% for intrapartum stillbirths). In New Zealand, stillbirth 
  
 
16 
 
rates at term have declined over the seven years since national perinatal audit began11 (Figure 8, 
webappendix). This decline was specifically attributed to a reduction in stillbirth at 37-40 weeks’ 
gestation and >41 weeks’ gestation. Despite their value, few countries have implemented national-
level perinatal audit programs (webappendix). Norway, which originally introduced it in 1984, has 
now abandoned this practice. Among the care providers we surveyed, only 37% reported that their 
facility conducts regular perinatal audit meetings; these were most commonly held only monthly 
(34%) or quarterly (26%), and used case discussion only as opposed to formal audit methodology 
(61% vs 12%).  
There is a clear need for greater focus on effective, sustainable implementation of perinatal audit to 
ensure health services identify areas of suboptimal care. Establishing perinatal mortality audit 
requires both service- and ministerial-level support, and quarantined time for multidisciplinary team 
engagement. Other critical components include an agreed set of definitions, adoption of a formal 
audit methodology, and appropriate indicators for monitoring and evaluation, and effective data 
systems (Panel 2). Innovative e- and m-health solutions currently being implemented hold promise,81 
as well as structured education programs around institutional perinatal mortality audit and 
classification such as the IMPROVE program.82  
1.15 Antenatal screening and interventions to prevent stillbirth – Are we 
getting closer? 
1.15.1 Early delivery  
Routine induction of labour (IOL) at term and post-term reduces the risk of perinatal mortality and 
caesarean birth.83 However, birth prior to 39 weeks increases the risk of morbidity84 and is associated 
with increased risk of long-term mortality.85 Therefore, prior to 39 weeks, early delivery requires 
balancing any reduction in stillbirth risk against these risks, and should only be considered in the 
presence of significant risk for maternal and neonatal complications. When IOL is undertaken, 
adequate information-provision to women is essential, as women have reported not being aware of 
  
 
17 
 
the risks of induction or the implications for future pregnancies until after the induction had been 
performed.86 
The ARRIVE trial87 in the US comparing elective IOL at 39 weeks with expectant management among 
singleton uncomplicated term pregnancies may help to clarify the risks and benefits of term 
induction.  
1.15.2 Ultrasonic and biochemical prediction of stillbirth risk 
Multiple pathophysiological processes result in stillbirth, making it difficult to predict.88 A test is likely 
to perform poorly when assessed against all stillbirths, but possibly more specific for a given cause of 
stillbirth. A systematic review of biomarker and ultrasonic tests found none of 16 single, or 5 
combined, tests performed well as predictors of stillbirth.89 However, stillbirth attributed to placental 
dysfunctional disorders was moderately to strongly associated (positive likelihood ratios between 5 
and 15) with low first trimester pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and abnormal 
uterine artery Doppler velocimetry in the second trimester. More studies are needed to determine 
whether closer vigilance or any treatment is effective to prevent stillbirth in this increased-risk group. 
1.15.3 Routine late pregnancy ultrasound to screen for fetal growth restriction 
Of the estimated 30-50% of stillbirths related to FGR; most are undetected and many occur in 
women lacking risk factors.90 Ultrasonic fetal biometry is widely used in high risk pregnancies as a 
means of detecting FGR, thus universal ultrasound is one potential approach to screening low-risk 
women.90 However, high-quality evidence on the diagnostic effectiveness of ultrasound is lacking.91 A 
recent  prospective cohort study found universal scanning was associated with approximately 3-fold 
increase in the detection of small for gestational age (SGA) (20-57%).92 Further, SGA fetuses with 
reduced abdominal circumference growth velocity were at increased risk of morbidity, whereas SGA 
fetuses with normal growth velocity were not. This study confirms universal ultrasound is effective in 
identifying FGR. However, the costs and potential adverse iatrogenic consequences of implementing 
such an intervention require consideration.93  
  
 
18 
 
1.15.4 Challenges in gaining high quality evidence for screening 
Sample size calculations demonstrate that even if a screening test has a positive likelihood ratio of 10 
and was coupled with an intervention that reduced stillbirth by 50%, a study of screening and 
intervention would still require approximately 130,000 women to be adequately powered (Figure 9, 
webappendix). Possible approaches to address this problem are the inclusion of stillbirth as part of a 
composite outcome and the use of study designs with randomisation at the hospital level, including 
cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or stepped wedge RCTs,88 such as the trials of fetal 
movement awareness interventions mentioned below.94, 95  
1.15.5 Promising antenatal interventions? 
Raising awareness of decreased fetal movements (DFM) may aid stillbirth prevention via timely 
detection and reporting, though concerns exist over the potential to increase anxiety and health 
service utilisation.96 Two large-scale trials of fetal movement awareness interventions are ongoing in 
Australasia,95 and Ireland and The UK.94 In a large non-randomised study, an educational program of 
standardised measurement of fundal height, plotting on customised charts and referral protocols, 
has also been associated with reduced stillbirth.97 Data from RCTs are required to confirm or refute 
these findings.98 The adverse impact of supine sleep position in late pregnancy has recently been 
highlighted as a potentially modifiable risk factor.99-102 Although these findings are biologically 
plausible, results from further studies in The UK103 and New Zealand100 study are awaited. 
1.16 The research agenda 
The LSS identified 30 questions derived from opinions of professionals and researchers. Research 
priority setting methods have since developed to include patient and public views. As part of the ISA 
surveys, over 7,000 parents, care providers and community members provided stillbirth action and 
research priorities. While the ISA project is ongoing, preliminary data indicate agreement with the 
LSS and a recent UK project.104 Major topics included: stillbirth prevention by application of current 
tests and development of novel investigations with optimal timing of delivery, understanding 
  
 
19 
 
placental pathways in stillbirth and the causes of unexplained stillbirth, optimal bereavement care, 
and subsequent pregnancy care.  
Perinatal mortality audit programs, interventions to reduce the prevalence of overweight and 
obesity, and initiatives to increase the coverage of smoking cessation programs in pregnancy are also 
priorities. With static rates of stillbirths <28 weeks across HIC, and with spontaneous preterm labour 
and/or preterm ROM a major contributor, ongoing efforts in prediction and prevention of preterm 
birth are important in stillbirth prevention. Strengthening collaborations between researchers and 
parents to address priorities using similar protocols is key in addressing stillbirths in HIC. 
1.17 Conclusions 
Stillbirth remains a major public health problem in HIC and reductions in rates have not matched 
those for neonatal mortality. Variation and socio-economic disparities in stillbirth rates, suboptimal 
uptake of interventions, low proportions of stillbirths attributed to congenital abnormality and high 
proportions classified as unexplained, and the contribution of substandard care factors suggest 
stillbirths are not inevitable, and that further reduction in HIC is possible. Ending preventable 
stillbirths in HIC can be achieved through improvements in the health status of women, through 
improvements in quality of maternity care, and by reducing social inequities. High quality perinatal 
mortality audit informed by thorough investigation is attainable in all HIC and holds the key to 
(relatively) rapid reductions in stillbirth rates. 
The death of a child before birth is a tragedy for families, and stigma and fatalism must be eliminated 
to optimise bereavement care and to reduce the number of these deaths.

Panels 
304 
Panel 1. Methods 
305 
 
306 
ISA web-based surveys 
307 
We developed three web-based, multilanguage surveys of bereaved parents, care providers and 
308 
general community members to assess practices around stillbirth prevention, awareness of stillbirth 
309 
risk factors, quality of antepartum and bereavement care, uptake of stillbirth investigations, audit 
310 
and classification of stillbirths and more. A mix of categorical items, open-ended items, ranking items 
311 
and rating scales were included. Surveys were disseminated chiefly via the International Stillbirth 
312 
Alliance (ISA) member organisations and additional relevant professional societies between 
313 
December 2014 and February 2015. Surveys were available in English, Dutch, German, Italian, 
314 
Spanish and Portuguese. The survey of care providers was also available in French and Japanese. 
315 
In total, 6,636 responses were received across 32 HIC. Quantitative data were analysed in SPSS and 
316 
were weighted to account for uneven distribution of responses across countries (see webappendix). 
317 
Qualitative data were sorted in NVivo.  
318 
Surveys were approved by the Mater Health Services Human Research Ethics Committee, within the 
319 
guidelines of the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and the 
320 
University of British Columbia Office Of Research Ethics. 
321 
 
322 
Stillbirth rates in HIC / analysis of avoidable deaths 
323 
The number of potentially preventable stillbirths across all HIC for the year 2015 was calculated from 
324 
stillbirth rates and total births in Blencowe and colleagues8 by subtracting the anticipated numbers of 
325 
stillbirths applying the 2015 stillbirth rates from the numbers derived using a rate of 2/1000 births 
326 
for all countries with a rate above 2/1000.  
327 
 
328 
Summary of disparities in HIC 
329 
Socioeconomic disparities in stillbirth rates in HIC were investigated via narrative review, by 
330 
searching for papers on health inequities and social disadvantage as they relate to stillbirth, by 
331 
snowballing from those papers, and from citations made to the LSS HIC paper.7 We also contacted 
332 
experts in the field for details of programs addressing disparities in stillbirth and ways of reducing 
333 
stillbirths in HIC. 
334 
  
 
29 
 
Review of national policies and clinical practice guidelines 
335 
National policies on perianal mortality audit 
336 
We searched for policies national policies on perinatal mortality audit across the top 36 HIC 
337 
according to number of annual stillbirths (equating to 99% of the known stillbirth burden in HIC). 
338 
Perinatal audit was defined as per Dunn and McIlwaine as “The systematic, critical analysis of the 
339 
quality of perinatal care, including the procedures used for diagnosis and treatment, the use of 
340 
resources and the resultant outcome and quality of life for women and their babies”.78 Specifically, 
341 
we searched for policies for national perinatal data collection that is coupled with mandatory in-
342 
depth review of care by a multidisciplinary team following a stillbirth (see webappendix for further 
343 
search details). We also consulted a local key informant to confirm findings and gain further 
344 
information. 
345 
National clinical practice guidelines  
346 
National clinical practice guidelines and recommendations addressing stillbirth prevention and 
347 
investigations were identified across the top five developed countries according to number of annual 
348 
stillbirths (Russian Federation; United States, Japan, France, The United Kingdom). Guidelines of 
349 
interest included those addressing the key messages of the 2011 LSS HIC paper,7 namely overweight 
350 
and obesity, alcohol and substance use, smoking cessation, training of health professionals to 
351 
provide care to disadvantaged pregnant women, and stillbirth investigations protocols to assess 
352 
cause of death. A structured search was conducted specific for each country using a customised list 
353 
of organisational websites providing national health care guidelines (see webappendix for further 
354 
search details). We also consulted a local key informant.
355 
  
30 
 
Panel 2. Essential steps to establish perinatal mortality audit at the national level 
356 
 
Execute an information-plan to ensure it is known that stillbirths are not inevitable and that 
357 
many stillbirths can be prevented by increasing quality of care, particularly around term. 
358 
 
Obtain support and budget from national bodies, including ministries of health and 
359 
professional colleges. 
360 
 
Develop a national network to coordinate the data collection and identify missing cases 
361 
through a check system using births and death certificate; and to lead timely reporting and 
362 
analysis. 
363 
 
Establish a national multidisciplinary leadership/steering group to drive the process, agree on 
364 
national priorities, develop and monitor formal audit-methodology, establish consistent and 
365 
robust definitions, ensure consistency across jurisdictions, and ensure perinatal audit 
366 
remains on the national agenda while it remains relevant. 
367 
 
Identify clinical champion(s) at service delivery level. 
368 
 
Develop a system for clinical and process data collection, preferably web-based, to be 
369 
completed by the clinical staff.  
370 
 
Ensure that the underlying philosophy of data collection is based on shared ownership of the 
371 
data to optimise data quality. This includes the ability of units to access their own data in a 
372 
format that they can use for their own surveillance and perinatal mortality reviews. 
373 
 
Allocate human resources to support local or regional audit initiatives. 
374 
 
Conduct local review of perinatal cases with multidisciplinary teams that have allocated time. 
375 
 
Develop a method to provide useful, automatically-generated feedback to clinicians and 
376 
facilities of the suggested improvements to support local quality and audit processes. 
377 
 
Conduct effective monitoring and evaluation of the audit program with relevant and feasible 
378 
performance indicators. 
379 
 
Implement processes to ensure that disclosure of information cannot be used for disciplinary 
380 
action. 
381 
 
Ensure there is support/funding to support implementation of recommendations.
