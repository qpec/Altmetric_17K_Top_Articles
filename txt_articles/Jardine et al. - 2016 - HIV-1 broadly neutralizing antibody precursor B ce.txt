 common, as only a subset of CTCF sites form in-
sulated neighborhoods (8, 10, 24). CTCF cohesin–
bound loops are largely preserved across cell
types (8, 9, 24), and a set of ~10,000 constitutive
CTCF-CTCF loops shared by GM12878 lympho-
blastoid, Jurkat, and K562 (CML) cells (24) were
identified for comparison (Fig. 4A, fig. S11, and
table S8). We used the International Cancer Gen-
ome Consortium (ICGC) database—which contains
data for ~50 cancer types, ~2300 whole-genome
sequence (WGS) samples, and ~13 million unique
somatic mutations—to examine the boundaries
of these neighborhoods for somatic point muta-
tions found in cancer genomes (table S9). We
found a striking enrichment of mutations at the
CTCF boundaries of constitutive neighborhoods
(Fig. 4B, fig. S12A, and table S10) relative to re-
gions flanking the boundary CTCF sites (±1 kb
of the CTCF binding motif; P < 10−4, permutation
test) (fig. S12B), and in many instances these
created a change in the consensus CTCF binding
motif (fig. S12C). Nonboundary CTCF sites did
not show such enrichment (Fig. 4B and figs. S12D
and S14). The genomes of esophageal and liver
carcinoma samples were particularly enriched
for boundary CTCF site mutations (Fig. 4, C and
D, fig. S12, D and E, fig. S13, and table S10), and
there was no similar enrichment of mutations at
the binding sites of other transcription factors
(fig. S15). In these cancers, a considerable frac-
tion of the mutated neighborhood boundary
CTCF sites were affected by multiple mutations
(≥3 mutations per site) [280/1826 (15%) in esoph-
ageal carcinoma, 54/1030 (5%) in liver carcinoma]
(table S10), and recurrent mutations occurred
more frequently in neighborhood boundary CTCF
sites relative to nonboundary CTCF sites (fig. S16,
A to C). The genes located within the most fre-
quently mutated neighborhoods included known
cellular proto-oncogenes annotated in the Cancer
Gene Census and other genes that have not been
associated with these cancers (Fig. 4, E and F,
and tables S11 and S12). Shown in Fig. 4, G and H,
are two examples of proto-oncogene–containing
neighborhoods where the activation of the gene
located in the neighborhood has been observed
in the respective cancer type. These results sug-
gest that somatic mutations of insulated neigh-
borhood boundaries occur in the genomes of
many different cancers.
Our findings indicate that disruption of in-
sulated neighborhood boundaries can cause on-
cogene activation in cancer cells. With maps of
3D chromosome structure such as those described
here, cancer genome analysis can consider how
recurrent perturbations of boundary elements
may affect the expression of genes with roles in
tumor biology. Our understanding of 3D chro-
mosome structure and its control is rapidly ad-
vancing and should be considered for potential
diagnostic and therapeuticpurposes. Because con-
trol of 3D chromosome structure involves bind-
ing of specific sites by CTCF and cohesin, which
is affected by protein cofactors, DNA methyla-
tion, and local RNA synthesis (25), advances in
our understanding of these regulatory processes
may provide new approaches to therapeutics
that have an impact on aberrant chromosome
structures.

Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a major HIV vaccine goal.
Germline-targeting immunogens aim to initiate bnAb induction by activating bnAb
germline precursor B cells. Critical unmet challenges are to determine whether bnAb
precursor naïve B cells bind germline-targeting immunogens and occur at sufficient
frequency in humans for reliable vaccine responses. Using deep mutational scanning
and multitarget optimization, we developed a germline-targeting immunogen (eOD-GT8)
for diverse VRC01-class bnAbs. We then used the immunogen to isolate VRC01-class
precursor naïve B cells from HIV-uninfected donors. Frequencies of true VRC01-class
precursors, their structures, and their eOD-GT8 affinities support this immunogen as a
candidate human vaccine prime. These methods could be applied to germline targeting
for other classes of HIV bnAbs and for Abs to other pathogens.
D
evelopment of an HIV vaccine is a global
health priority. Recent discoveries of po-
tentbroadlyneutralizingantibodies(bnAbs)
that bind to relatively conserved epitopes
on the HIV Env glycoprotein trimer and
protect against challenge in animal models have
reinvigorated vaccine design efforts to induce
bnAbs (1). However, bnAbs have not been elicited
in standard animal models or humans.
Germline targeting, a vaccine priming strat-
egy to initiate the affinity maturation of select
germline-precursor B cells, has promise to initiate

 bnAb induction. The goals for a germline-targeting
prime are to activate B cell precursors with bnAb
potential, select productive (bnAb-like) somatic
mutations, and generate an expanded popula-
tion of memory B cells that can be boosted and
matured subsequently to shepherd the response
further toward bnAb development (2, 3). For a
few HIV bnAbs, next-generation sequencing of
antibody populations during bnAb development in
infected individuals has allowed bioinformatic
inference of likely human germline precursors
(4, 5). For most bnAbs, however, true human pre-
cursors are not known but are usually approxi-
mated by “germline-reverted” antibodies that use
inferred germline V and J genes and retain ma-
ture CDR3 (complementarity-determining region
3) loops. Because CDR3 loops typically play a ma-
jorrole inantibody affinity and specificity, germline-
reverted bnAbs are not known to be reliable
proxies for true germline precursors.
VRC01-class bnAbs are an important test case
for germline targeting, because they are among
the most broad and potent of HIV bnAbs and be-
cause their germline-reverted forms show no de-
tectable affinity for HIV Env glycoproteins (6–10).
Knock-in mice transgenic for a germline-reverted
VRC01-class heavy chain responded to immuni-
zation with the germline-targeting eOD-GT8 60-
subunit self-assembling nanoparticle (60mer) but
not with native-like Env trimers, providing proof
of principle that germline-targeting immunogens
can initiate a VRC01-class response if well-matched
B cells are present and competing B cells are
strongly reduced in frequency (2, 3). Here, we
address further critical knowledge gaps that
obstruct the development of this (or any) germline-
targeting immunogen as a human vaccine: Do
the targeted bnAb precursors exist in humans?
What is the frequency and person-to-person varia-
tion of germline-targeting immunogen–specific
bnAb precursors? Can the germline-targeting im-
munogen bind the targeted human bnAb pre-
cursors in competition with other B cells in the
fully complex human B cell repertoire? We exam-
ined these questions by developing new ex vivo
approaches and protein design methods.
When we used the VRC01-class germline-
targeting immunogen eOD-GT6 (9) as bait to
screen human naïve B cells via a two-phase
multiple-validation methodology (11) (fig. S1),
we failed to isolate VRC01-class B cells. We did,
however, isolate non–VRC01-class naïve B cells
with Ab affinities as low as 120 mM for eOD-GT6
(fig. S1). We therefore set out to develop an im-
proved variant of eOD-GT6 with higher affinity
and breadth for germline-reverted VRC01-class
Abs, hypothesizing that such improvements might
translate into improved affinity for diverse true
VRC01-class precursor Abs.
To improve on eOD-GT6, we used yeast display
library screening coupled with next-generation
sequencing (12). We screened a library of every
point mutation at the 58 eOD:Ab interface posi-
tions on eOD-GT7, a slightly improved version of
eOD-GT6 (11), against each of 29 VRC01-class Abs
(18 germline-reverted and 11 mature bnAbs). By
measuring binding enrichments for each muta-
tion and antibody (Fig. 1A and fig. S2), we iden-
tified 12 positions in eOD-GT7 at which one or
more mutations were favorable (enriched by at
least a factor of 2) for binding to the majority (at
least 10 of 18) of germline-reverted bnAbs, and
another four positions at which one or more mu-
tations were enriched by at least a factor of 1.25
for binding to the vast majority (at least 17 of 18)
of germline-reverted bnAbs (Fig. 1B). To identify
combinations of mutations predicted to confer
the greatest binding cross-reactivity, we then
created a library encompassing all combinations
of a filtered set of the favorable mutations at
those 16 positions (13) (Fig. 1C). Upon screening
this combinatorial library against the panel of
29 VRC01-class Abs, we identified a sequence,
eOD-GT8, predicted to have optimal breadth
against the entire panel (Fig. 1C, figs. S3 and S4,
and table S1).
Relative to eOD-GT6, eOD-GT8 demonstrated
superior affinity and breadth of binding to
germline-reverted Abs (Fig. 1D and table S2).
eOD-GT8 bound to all germline-reverted Abs in
the panel, whereas eOD-GT6 bound to only 8 of
14 Abs with dissociation constants (KD) of less
than 100 mM. For those eight germline-reverted
Abs, the geometric mean affinity of eOD-GT8
was higher than that of eOD-GT6 by a factor of
2100; eOD-GT8 also had improved affinity (fac-
tor of 3) for VRC01-class bnAbs. The tightest eOD-
GT8 binding detected was for germline-reverted
PGV20, with a KD of 508 fM (95% confidence
interval, 234 to 943 fM) (Fig. 1D and fig. S5), a
factor of 5900 improvement over eOD-GT6 (KD =
3 nM) and a factor of 33 million improvement
over the original eOD construct, eOD Base [KD =
17 mM (9)]—a remarkable affinity improvement
for a protein-protein interface.
To examine whether VRC01-class precursors
targeted by eOD-GT8 exist in humans, we per-
formed epitope-specific B cell sorting from a pool
ofperipheralbloodmononuclearcellsfromhealthy,
HIV-seronegative donors. Epitope-specific B cells
bound tetramers of eOD-GT8 but not tetramers
of eOD-GT8-KO, a variant of eOD-GT8 with mu-
tations abrogating binding by VRC01-class germline-
reverted Abs. After sequencing immunoglobulin
(Ig) genes from single sorted cells, we searched
for VRC01-class antibody sequences—that is,
those with a heavy chain that used VH1-2 alleles
*02, *03, or *04 and a light chain with a 5–amino
acid CDR3 (9, 14). After sorting 2.4 million IgM+/
IgG–/CD19+ B cells pooled from nine donors, we
recovered a single GT8+/GT8-KO– Ab that qual-
ified as a VRC01-class precursor. This Ab, VRC01c-
HuGL1, bound to eOD-GT8 with a KD of 22 mM
and had no detectable affinity for eOD-GT8-KO
(fig. S6).
To assess both the percentage of people who
possess VRC01-class germline precursor B cells
and the frequency of VRC01-class germline pre-
cursor B cells within a given donor, we screened
naïve B cells from 15 healthy, HIV-seronegative
donors individually rather than pooled. For 7
of 15 samples, we used the two-phase multiple-
validation methodology that first assesses spec-
ificity by probe binding in flow cytometry and
then confirms specificity and lack of polyreactiv-
ity by single-cell secreted IgM (fig. S7); for eight
subsequent donors, we relied on sorting speci-
ficity alone. For optimal cell sorting sensitivity,
B cells were required to simultaneously bind two
eOD-GT8 probes multimerized differently [trimer
(“tri”) and streptavidin tetramers (“SA”)] while
not binding eOD-GT8-KO-SA (Fig. 2A and fig. S7).
For the 15 donors, the mean frequency of eOD-
GT8tri+/SA+ B cells among 61.6 million naïve B
cells sorted was 0.0056% (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, a vast
majority (84 ± 14%) of these eOD-GT8tri+/SA+ B cells
did not bind eOD-GT8-KO-SA (Fig. 2C), which sug-
gests that naïve B cell reactivity to eOD-GT8 is highly
focused to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) (15).
Paired heavy and kappa light chain sequences
were recovered from 173 eOD-GT8tri+/SA+/eOD-
GT8-KO– B cells. All sequences were essentially
germline, confirming the naïve B cell sorts. Half
(50%) of these B cells were VH1-2, whereas only
4% of control B cells from reference (16) were
VH1-2 (c2 = 29.9, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2D and fig. S8).
Among these 87 VH1-2+ B cells, 26 had a light
chain CDR3 (L-CDR3) length of 5 amino acids, a
factor of 85 enrichment relative to control B cells
(c2 = 32.6, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2E). Twenty-five of the
26 used the VH1-2*02 allele and one used VH1-
2*04 (table S3); thus, 15% (26/173) of GT8tri+/SA+/
eOD-GT8-KO– B cells were VRC01-class. In total,
we identified 27 independent VRC01-class naïve
B cells, including VRC01c-HuGL1.
In addition to the VH1-2 alleles and critical 5–
amino acid L-CDR3, VRC01-class bnAbs possess
several additional defining features, including a
consensusL-CDR3ofGln-Gln-Tyr-Glu-Phe(QQYEF).
The majority of VRC01-class precursors we iso-
lated contained a QQYxx partial VRC01-class
consensus motif that was significantly enriched
relative to control B cells (67% versus 11%; c2 =
8.2, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2F). Furthermore, 11% con-
tained a QQYEx L-CDR3 motif (versus 1.5% of
control B cells), one mutation away from a per-
fect mature VRC01-class L-CDR3 (Fig. 2F). In ad-
dition, the L-CDR1 loop is under strong selective

 pressure during VRC01-class bnAb affinity matu-
ration to minimize clashes with gp120 (6, 17). VRC01-
class bnAb L-CDR1 loops generally become very
short (2 to 6 amino acids) through deletion, or
retain a germline length of 6 amino acids and
add flexible glycines (17). Of the 27 VRC01-class
precursors isolated by eOD-GT8, 23 used Vk
genes containing L-CDR1 loops of 6 or 7 amino
acids (Fig. 2G), thus confirming potential to de-
velop into VRC01-class bnAbs. Indeed, 17 of the
VRC01-class naïve B cells had Vk genes used in
known VRC01-class bnAbs (Fig. 2H). At least 24
of the VRC01-class precursors had H-CDR3 lengths
of 10 to 19 amino acids (Fig. 2I) (18), consistent
with known VRC01-class bnAb lengths of 10 to 19
amino acids. Thus, not only are the eOD-GT8
isolated naïve B cells highly enriched for VRC01-
class core characteristics of VH1-02 and a 5–amino
acid L-CDR3, they possess further refined se-
quence attributes of VRC01-class bnAbs.
Combining data from the 15 donors analyzed
individually, the overall frequency of recovered
VRC01-class precursors was 1 in 2.4 million naïve
B cells (Fig. 2J), consistent with both our first
pooled sort and a previous bioinformatically es-
timated range (17). The observed counts were con-
sistent with a Poisson distribution with constant
frequency of 1 in 2.4 million (Fig. 2K) (11), which
suggests that VRC01-class precursors occur at a
consistent rate among 96% of humans possess-
ing the necessary VH1-2 alleles (9). Adults have
an estimated 1010 to 1011 B cells, and lymph nodes
each have ~50 million B cells, of which ~65 to
75% are naïve B cells (19). Thus, our results indi-
cate that VRC01-class precursor B cells are rela-
tively common in humans: At least 2700 to 31,000
eOD-GT8–reactive VRC01-class naïve B cells are
likely present in nearly all potential human vac-
cine recipients, with ~15 such B cells in each lymph
node, at any given time (20).
The KD values of 24 isolated VRC01-class pre-
cursors for monovalent eOD-GT8 ranged from
57 mM to 125 nM, with a geometric mean KD
of 3.4 mM (Fig. 2L and table S4), weaker than
germline-reverted VRC01-class Abs by a factor of

most likely due to the naïve CDR3 loops in the
former as opposed to the affinity-matured CDR3
loops in the latter. The VRC01-class naïve B cell
affinities are in the range expected to allow a
multivalent eOD-GT8 immunogen, such as eOD-
GT8 60mer (2, 9), to activate B cells and initiate
germinal centers (21, 22). Our data also suggest
that eOD-GT8 has promise to produce VRC01-
class memory even given competition from non–
VRC01-class B cells, as eOD-GT8 exhibited a high
degree of CD4bs immunofocusing (Fig. 2C) and
VRC01-class precursors had an affinity advan-
tage (factor of ≥3) over non–VRC01-class CD4bs
epitope-binding precursors (Fig. 2L). The frequen-
cies and eOD-GT8 affinities of bona fide VRC01-
class precursors isolated here warrant human
immunization studies with eOD-GT8 60mer
nanoparticles.
Only 2 of 20 tested VRC01-class precursors
had detectable affinity for eOD-GT6 (Fig. 2L).
Equilibrium binding KD values were 36 mM and
69 mM, and these Abs had two of the highest af-
finities for eOD-GT8 at 506 nM and 258 nM, re-
spectively (table S4). These data, combined with
the failure of eOD-GT6 probe B cell screens to
isolate VRC01-class precursors, suggest that the
engineered breadth and affinity improvements
in eOD-GT8 represent a major advance toward
practical utility in human vaccination.
We sought to confirm that the isolated VRC01-
class precursors engage the CD4bs in the same
structural binding mode as VRC01-class bnAbs
(6, 17, 23–25) and germline-reverted VRC01 (9).
We solved the crystal structure of isolated pre-
cursor VRC01c-HuGL2 (eOD-GT8 KD = 368 nM)

parison of this structure with the complex of
core-gp120 bound to VRC01 [PDB ID: 3NGB (6)]
shows the same binding mode (Fig. 3A), includ-
ing specific H-CDR2 and L-CDR3 conformations
(Fig. 3B) (26) that together account for more
than 67.2% of the Fv domain buried surface area
(Fig. 3C and table S6). When interface residues of
eOD-GT8 and core-gp120 are aligned, VH and VL
of VRC01c-HuGL2 and VRC01 have high similar-
ity (Ca RMSD 0.7 Å; Fig. 3A and fig. S9). These
structural observations confirm VRC01c-HuGL2
as a bona fide VRC01-class precursor and support
the conclusion that all of the eOD-GT8–specific
naïve B cells using VH1-2 and a 5–amino acid
L-CDR3 are bona fide VRC01-class precursors.
Comparison of the eOD-GT8–VRC01c-HuGL2
structure with a 1.82 Å unliganded VRC01c-HuGL2
structure shows that the important H-CDR2 and
L-CDR3 loops are preconfigured in the unbound
state and do not require any conformational
changes for engagement with gp120 CD4bs (Fig.
3D), heightening the appeal of VRC01-class germ-
line targeting. A 2.9 Å unliganded structure of
eOD-GT8 (Fig. 3E and fig. S10) demonstrates
faithful mimicry of the VRC01-class antibody-
bound conformation (27), thus helping to explain
the increased affinity of eOD-GT8 for true VRC01-
class bnAb precursors.
The interaction of the naïve human B cell
repertoire with vaccine antigens has not been
characterized previously. Given the vast immuno-
globulin sequence space, direct probing of the
human naïve B cell repertoire was a critical test
of the physiologically relevant binding potential
of the germline-targeting immunogen. The anti-
body sequence features, binding affinities, and
high structural similarity of the eOD-GT8–specific
naïve B cell–derived antibodies to VRC01 all demon-
strate the power of germline-targeting design when
combined with human B cell probing. Similar

20. The frequency of 1 in 2.4 million is an underestimate of the
true frequency among naïve B cells, because not all B cells
counted by the sorter as eOD-GT8tri+/SA+/eOD-GT8-KO– were
sorted into a well (cell sorter loss), paired heavy chain and
light chain (HC and LC) sequences were recovered from fewer
than half of eOD-GT8tri+/SA+/eOD-GT8-KO– B cells sorted
into wells [a result of the inherent limitations of single-cell
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], and B cells bearing lambda
light chains were not analyzed. By correcting for cell sorter
and PCR losses, the frequency of VRC01-class naïve B cell
precursors is calculated as 1 in 400,000 naïve B cells (11).
VRC01-class precursors may also exist in the memory B cell
population in healthy humans, but their frequency remains
to be measured.

As tumors grow, they acquire mutations, some of which create neoantigens that
influence the response of patients to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We explored the
impact of neoantigen intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) on antitumor immunity. Through
integrated analysis of ITH and neoantigen burden, we demonstrate a relationship
between clonal neoantigen burden and overall survival in primary lung adenocarcinomas.
CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to clonal neoantigens were identified in
early-stage non–small cell lung cancer and expressed high levels of PD-1. Sensitivity
to PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC and melanoma was
enhanced in tumors enriched for clonal neoantigens. T cells recognizing clonal
neoantigens were detectable in patients with durable clinical benefit. Cytotoxic
chemotherapy–induced subclonal neoantigens, contributing to an increased mutational
load, were enriched in certain poor responders. These data suggest that neoantigen
heterogeneity may influence immune surveillance and support therapeutic
developments targeting clonal neoantigens.
R
ecent studies have highlighted the rele-
vance of tumor neoantigens in the recog-
nition of cancer cells by the immune system
(1–4), prompting a renewed interested in
personalized vaccines and cell therapies
that target cancer mutations (5, 6). However,
although genomic data are revealing the extent
of genetic heterogeneity within single tumors (7),
the influence of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH)
upon the neoantigen landscape and sensitivity to
immune modulation is unclear.
To explore neoantigen heterogeneity and
its influence on antitumor immunity in early-
stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we
applied a bioinformatics pipeline to seven pri-
mary NSCLCs subjected to multiregion se-
quence analysis (table S1) (8, 9). In total, 2860
putative neoantigens were predicted across
the cohort, with a median of 326 neoantigens
predicted per tumor (range of 80 to 741) (Fig. 1A).
Neoantigen heterogeneity varied considerab-
ly, with an average of 44% neoantigens found
