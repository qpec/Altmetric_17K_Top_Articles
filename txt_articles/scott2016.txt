Aims
Risk of revision following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is higher in patients under 55 years, 
but little data are reported regarding non-revision outcomes. This study aims to identify 
predictors of dissatisfaction in these patients.
Patients and Methods
We prospectively assessed 177 TKAs (157 consecutive patients, 99 women, mean age 50 
years; 17 to 54) from 2008 to 2013. Age, gender, implant, indication, body mass index (BMI), 
social deprivation, range of movement, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of osteoarthritis (OA) 
and prior knee surgery were recorded. Pre- and post-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) as 
well as Short Form-12 physical (PCS) and mental component scores were obtained. Post-
operative range of movement, complications and satisfaction were measured at one year.
Results 
Overall, 44 patients with 44 TKAs (24.9%) under 55 years of age were unsure or dissatisfied 
with their knee. Significant predictors of dissatisfaction on univariate analysis included: KL 
grade 1/2 OA (59% dissatisfied), poor pre-operative OKS, complications, poor improvements 
in PCS and OKS and indication (primary OA 19% dissatisfied, previous meniscectomy 41%, 
multiply operated 42%, other surgery 29%, BMI > 40 kg/m2 31%, post-traumatic OA 45%, 
and inflammatory arthropathy 5%). Poor pre-operative OKS, poor improvement in OKS and 
post-operative stiffness independently predicted dissatisfaction on multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
Patients receiving TKA younger than 55 years old should be informed about the increased 
risks of dissatisfaction. Offering TKA in KL 1/2 is questionable, with a dissatisfaction rate of 
59%.

The number of total knee arthroplasties (TKA)
performed is increasing each year. Data indi-
cate that 13% to 14% of TKAs are performed
in patients under 55 or 60 years old.1,2 The use
of TKA is increasing disproportionately
among young patients, and those aged 45 to 55
years are the fastest-growing group of recipi-
ents.1,3,4 This trend is set to continue over the
coming decades.1 Registry data show inferior
implant survivorship in the under 55 years age
group, with a ten-year cumulative risk of revi-
sion of 9% to 11%.2,4 However, there is a pau-
city of information regarding non-revision
clinical outcome in this young patient group.5
Patient satisfaction is known to be a complex,
multifactorial issue and multivariate analyses
have shown patient expectations6,7 and their
fulfilment,8 pain relief,9,10 complications,7 and
the experience of healthcare delivery11 to be
significant predictors of (dis)satisfaction when
considering all TKA patients. These studies
have either not stratified patients by age, or
have had too few patients in the young age
group to draw any firm conclusions. Patients
coming to TKA at young ages often have com-
plex knee histories with previous injury,
deformity, a high body mass index (BMI), or
inflammatory conditions contributing to their
arthropathy. It remains unclear whether the
often complex indications for surgery, the
kinematic limitations of TKA, a failure to
meet high expectations, or higher activity lev-
els, contribute to poor outcomes and early
failure in this patient group.
The aim of this study was to identify pre-
dictors of dissatisfaction in patients aged
under 55 years using univariate and multivar-
iate analysis to understand better the patient-
reported outcome of TKA in this young age
group.

Patients and Methods
Ethical approval was obtained for this study. Between 2008
and 2013, 3008 consecutive primary TKAs were performed
at our institution. Of these, 177 TKAs were performed in
157 patients under the age of 55 years – these patients
formed our study group. One patient required a primary
hinged implant. The remaining 156 patients (176 TKAs)
received cruciate retaining prostheses of three designs: 109
Triathlon (Stryker, Orthopaedics, Mahwah New Jersey); 63
PFC Sigma (Depuy Synthes, Johnson & Johnson, Rayn-
ham, Massachusetts); and four Kinemax (Stryker). Supple-
mentary components required included: one medial tibial
augment, nine tibial stems and one femoral stem. No pri-
mary patellar resurfacing was performed. All procedures
were performed or supervised by consultant orthopaedic
surgeons (14 involved over the course of the study period)
with a subspecialty interest in TKA and annual volumes
> 50 TKAs per year (mean 72; 50 to 108).
All patients underwent standardised rehabilitation pro-
grammes. All data were collected prospectively. Prior to
surgery patients completed a questionnaire including the
Short Form-12 (SF-12)12 and Oxford Knee Scores (OKS).13
The SF-12 is a validated health questionnaire with physical
and mental health components.12 The OKS is a validated
knee specific outcome measure of 12 questions14 with five
possible answers giving a score from 0 to 48. Higher scores
represent better function. Completed questionnaires were
collected at a pre-assessment clinic. Similar post-operative
questionnaires were sent to patients at the 12-month
follow-up. These included patient satisfaction questions in
addition to the SF-12 and OKS. Patients were asked, ‘How
satisfied are you with your operated knee?’ with options
‘very satisfied’, ‘satisfied’, ‘unsure’ or ‘dissatisfied’.10 They
were also asked how well the surgery had relieved pain;
how it increased ability to perform regular activities; how it
enabled heavy work/sporting activity and how it met their
expectations. Responses were indicated on a six-point Lik-
ert scale. Collection of data was independent of the routine
clinical care of the patient. These patient-reported outcome
measures (PROMs) were collected for the 2831 TKAs per-
formed in patients aged > 55 years during the same time
period for comparison.
Medical notes were reviewed for all patients aged < 55
years. Data collected included patient characteristics, Scot-
tish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD),15 indication for
TKA, pre- and post-operative range of movement, compli-
cations and re-operations. Short-leg weight-bearing radio-
graphs were examined pre-operatively by one author
(WMO) to define Kellgren-Lawrence (KL)16 grade of
arthritis and femorotibial alignment, and post-operatively
at one to two years to measure implant alignment17 and
define location of radiolucency according to the Knee Soci-
ety Score.18 
Statistical analysis. This was performed using Statistical
Package for Social Sciences version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chi-
cago, Illinois). Univariate analysis was performed using
parametric (Student’s t-test: paired and unpaired) and non-
parametric (Mann-Whitney U test) tests as appropriate to
assess continuous variables for significant differences
between satisfied and dissatisfied patients. One way

analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare contin-
uous variables with multiple groups (OKS in SIMD quin-
tiles). Nominal categorical variables were assessed using a
chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. Pearson’s correlation was
used to assess the relationship between linear variables.
Variables found to be significantly associated with dissatis-
faction were entered stepwise into a multivariate binary
logistic regression analysis using an ‘enter’ methodology to
identify independent predictors of dissatisfaction correcting
for compounding factors. Statistical significance was
defined as a p-value < 0.05.
Results
The mean age of our cohort was 50 years (median 51, range
17 to 54) and 99 of 177 TKAs (56%) were performed in
women. In total, patients were very satisfied with 87 of 177
TKAs (49%), satisfied with 46 (26%), uncertain with 30
(17%) and dissatisfied with 14 (8%). All patients with
bilateral TKAs (n = 20) were very satisfied or satisfied with
both knees. We split these into two groups, with 113/157
patients (72%) satisfied with 133/177 (75%) TKAs and
44/157 patients (28%) dissatisfied with 44/177 (25%)
TKAs. During the same period, 2831 TKAs were per-
formed in 2270 patients over 55 years. Patient satisfaction
by age group is shown in Figure 1.
Satisfaction and clinical outcome. Univariate analysis of
pre-operative variables showed that in patients < 55 years,
gender (p = 0.573), responsible consultant (p = 0.967),
annual surgeon TKA volume (p = 0.992) and deprivation
level (p = 0.784, Fig. 2) did not affect dissatisfaction (Table
I). Social deprivation quintile had a significant effect on
pre-operative OKS (p = 0.012, ANOVA), being worse in
those most deprived. This effect had resolved by one year
(p = 0.248, ANOVA). There were no significant differences
in SF-12 physical (PCS) or mental component score (MCS)
between deprivation quintiles at any point. Implant type
had no effect on patient dissatisfaction (p = 0.257, chi-
squared) or improvement in OKS at one year (p = 0.277,
ANOVA).
Significant predictors of dissatisfaction at one year
included KL grade (p = 0.003, chi-squared) (Fig. 3), indica-
tion (p = 0.004, chi-squared) (Table II), and pre-operative
OKS (p = 0.004, unpaired t-test) (Table I). In all, 17 knees
in 17 patients had osteoarthritis (OA) assessed as KL grade
1 or 2. Of these ten patients were dissatisfied at one year
with ten knees (58.8%). In total, 13 of the 17 knees had
undergone previous knee surgery including six arthroscopic
partial meniscectomies and six knees, which were multiply
operated. There was no significant difference in pre-
operative OKS between KL grades (p = 0.622, ANOVA),
but both one year OKS (p < 0.001, unpaired t-test) and
improvement therein (p < 0.001, unpaired t-test) were sig-
nificantly better in patients with higher KL grades (Fig. 3).
The pattern of OA in terms of the maximally involved com-
partment (p = 0.467, chi-squared) and resultant coronal
plane alignment (p = 0.572, chi-squared) were not associ-
ated with dissatisfaction. Compared with patients within
this < 55 years old cohort with primary OA in previously
un-operated upon knees, odds ratios (OR) for dissatisfac-
tion by indication were: secondary OA with previous meni-
sectomy OR 2.86 (1.1 to 7.7); secondary OA with multiply
operated (three or more operations) knee OR 2.94 (0.77 to
11.1); OA with BMI > 40 kg/m2 OR 2.0 (0.59 to 5.6); post-
traumatic OA OR 3.3 (0.77 to 14.3); secondary OA with

other knee surgery OR 1.7 (0.29 to 10) and inflammatory
arthropathy OR 0.23 (0.05 to 1.15). Rates of dissatisfac-
tion by indication are shown in Table II.
Post-operatively both satisfied (18.2 mean improvement,
standard deviation (SD) 8.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)
16.6 to 19.7; p < 0.001 paired, t-test) and dissatisfied
patients (5.5 mean improvement, SD 7.5, 95% CI 3.0 to
7.7; p < 0.001, paired t-test) displayed significant improve-
ments in OKS (Fig. 4a). This was also true for mean SF-12
PCS (satisfied, mean improvement 13.7, SD 12.5, 95% CI
11.6 to 15.9; p < 0.001, paired t-test: dissatisfied, 3.1,
SD 9.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.9; p = 0.035, paired t-test) (Fig.
4b). The mean SF-12 MCS declined in both satisfied (4.4
decline, SD 21.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 8.2; p = 0.02, paired t -test)
and dissatisfied (6.0 decline, SD 14.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.3;
p = 0.008, paired t -test) patients (Fig. 4c). The mean OKS
improvement was significantly less in dissatisfied patients
(18.2, SD 8.8 versus 5.3, SD 7.5; p < 0.001, unpaired t-test).
On univariate analysis, other significant post-operative pre-
dictors of dissatisfaction included the extent of improve-
ment by one year in SF-12 PCS and MCS and the presence
of a complication (18/30 p < 0.001, chi-squared), in partic-
ular patient reported stiffness (9/12 patients dissatisfied,
p < 0.001 Fisher’s exact test) and superficial wound infec-
tions (4/4 patients dissatisfied, p < 0.001 Fisher’s exact test).
Of 12 patients reporting stiffness in 12 TKAs, five required
re-operation (four early manipulations under anaesthetic
and one arthroscopic arthrolysis), two of whom remained
dissatisfied at one year. Both absolute values and improve-
ments in OKS, SF-12 PCS and MCS, significantly predicted
dissatisfaction at one year (Table III). Implant alignment
and overall coronal plane alignment (femorotibial angle)
did not predict dissatisfaction. Objective flexion of < 90°
was associated with dissatisfaction (7/10 dissatisfied,

> 5° (5/16 dissatisfied, p = 0.57 chi-squared) or > 10° (3/8
dissatisfied, p = 0.412 chi-squared) was not.
Multivariate analysis of pre-operative factors showed KL
grade (low grade) and pre-operative OKS (poor score) to
predict dissatisfaction independently (Table IV). Post-
operative factor multivariate analysis accounted for greater
variation in satisfaction (as indicated by a higher R2 value)
and confirmed stiffness (p = 0.001) and improvement in
OKS (p = 0.001) to predict dissatisfaction independently
(Table V). Combining pre- and post-operative factors con-
firmed pre-operative OKS (p = 0.033), improvement in
OKS at one year (p = 0.027) and stiffness (p = 0.001) to pre-
dict dissatisfaction independently at one year (R2 = 0.585).
The responses to additional satisfaction questions were
correlated with overall patient satisfaction (Table VI),
which correlated most accurately with pain relief, followed
by whether expectations had been met. Satisfaction
correlated least well with the ability to perform heavy work
or sports.

Radiographic analysis. With regard to the tibial compo-
nent, 11/177 TKAs had non-progressive radiolucent lines:
in ten TKAs in zone 1; and in four in zone 4. On the femoral
side 14/177 had non-progressive radiolucent lines: six in
zone 1 and ten in zone 4. A total of two patients (one TKA
each) went on to early revision TKA at 13 and 17 months
for instability: both had been dissatisfied at one year. One
further patient underwent secondary patellar resurfacing
for anterior knee pain at 17 months.
Discussion
The overall patient dissatisfaction rate of 25% at 12
months in the under 55 age group is higher than that found
in older age groups at our institution (Fig. 1: 55 to 59 years
21%; 60 to 64 years 19%; 65 to 69 years 17%; 70 to 74
years 15%; 75 to 79 years 14%; > 80 years 14%), and
higher than the 14% to 19% reported for all age groups in
other studies.6,7,9,10 Our study has identified pre-operative
OKS, poorer improvement in OKS and post-operative knee
stiffness as independently significant predictors of dissatis-
faction in this age group. Other significant predictors of
dissatisfaction included underlying indication for surgery,
low KL grade, post-operative SF-12 PCS and MCS, and the
presence of other complications, which were no longer sig-
nificant after adjusting for these three variables (pre-opera-
tive OKS, poor improvement in OKS and post-operative
knee stiffness). 
Indications. Uncomplicated primary OA in knees which
have undergone no previous surgery was the indication in
only 32% (57/177) of TKAs in this cohort. A further 21%
(37/177) had an inflammatory arthropathy, with a very
high rate of satisfaction of 94.6% (35/37 knees). It could be
argued that all other indications in this study constituted
secondary arthritis, which is a known risk factor for revi-
sion in this age group.19 Secondary OA can be due to a
range of circumstances, with post-traumatic OA differing
from OA secondary to meniscal injury/surgery or to
instability/ligament reconstruction in terms of deformity,
technical difficulties, the incidence of complications and
outcome. Post-traumatic OA has been associated with
inferior outcomes20 and elevated complication rates,21 how-
ever, in contrast previous menisectomy has not.22 We have

tried to investigate outcome by aetiology. Whether super
obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2) should be included as a cause of
secondary OA via overload is a matter for debate.23-25 Obe-
sity is a well-proven risk factor for the development of knee
OA23,26 and its progression: a BMI of 25 to 30 is associated
with a relative risk of OA progression of 2.4 (95% CI 1.0 to
3.6) increasing to 2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.1) with a BMI > 30.25
Becoming overweight earlier in adulthood increases the risk
of knee OA further.24 Just as meniscal damage/excision or
malalignment following fracture disrupts the normal loading
environment of the knee leading to ‘secondary osteoarthri-
tis’, so too does super obesity. 
BMI. There is a four- to five-fold increase in the risk of
developing OA for obese patients.26 Super obesity increases
the technical difficulty of TKA, and the elevated incidence
of multiple comorbidities26 increases the risks of surgery.
Inferior outcomes and survival of TKA have been reported
in patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m27 in addition to a greater
risk of failure of revision TKA.28 In all, 13% of this young
cohort (23/177 knees) were classified a super obese.
Radiographic severity. Dissatisfaction 
was 
significantly
associated with low radiographic severity of OA on both
univariate analysis and pre-operative multivariate analysis.
Low radiographic OA severity has been associated with

worse function following TKA29 and poor patient satisfac-
tion rates of 68% (30/44 knees)30 have been reported, with
an increased risk of re-operation compared with patients
with more severe radiographic arthritis.30 A study by
Polkowski et al31 found 49% of 49 patients with
unexplained pain and dissatisfaction following TKA had a
low radiographic grade of OA (KL grade 1/2). Our dissat-
isfaction rate in patients with KL grade 1/2 OA was 59%
(ten of 17 patients). Though pre-operative OKS did not dif-
fer between KL grades, improvement therein was signifi-
cantly worse in patients with low KL grades. When
considering both pre- and post-operative variables, poor
OKS improvement was a more significant predictor of dis-
satisfaction than OA grade itself. However, the radio-
graphic OA grade is an important consideration, especially
when counselling patients on the expected outcome of
TKA.
In 12 of 17 knees (17 patients) with KL grade 1/2 arthri-
tis, an arthroscopy had been previously undertaken. A dis-
satisfaction rate of about 40% was found in patients who
had undergone previous arthroscopy. The effect of arthros-
copy on outcome of TKA is uncertain, although Issa et al22
found no effect on Knee Society Score (KSS) or survival,
when performed within months of TKA. Our findings sug-
gest the need for frank counselling regarding the likelihood
of dissatisfaction from TKA in young patients when only
arthroscopic evidence of arthritis is present. 
Deprivation. Although social deprivation level did not pre-
dict dissatisfaction, the most deprived were found to pre-
dominate in this young population. This concurs with
Clement et al,32 who found that the most deprived patients
underwent TKA at earlier ages. Whether this is due to
greater levels of manual work, or greater levels of comor-
bidities, including mental ill-heath and elevated BMI, has
not been investigated here, and is a weakness of our study. 
PROMs. Both the OKS and SF-12 PCS improved signifi-
cantly in both satisfied and dissatisfied patients, but the
mean improvement in OKS was 13 points less in those who
were dissatisfied. In addition to post-operative stiffness,
differences in OKS were the most important predictors of
satisfaction. In contrast to other studies,10,32,33 mean men-
tal health scores worsened following TKA in this cohort.
Both satisfied and dissatisfied patients experienced a mean
decline in SF-12 MCS in their first post-operative year,
though this was less marked in those who were satisfied.
Mental health scores were not significant predictors of sat-
isfaction in this age group. This is a new finding as pre-
operative mental health, and post-operative improvement,
have repeatedly been found to predict satisfaction follow-
ing TKA for all ages.10,33,34 
Reports on functional outcome in young patients receiv-
ing TKA have been few. A recent systematic review of the
< 55-year-old group identified 908 TKAs in 671 patients
and determined mean clinical and functional KSS improve-
ments of 47 and 37 points, respectively, at a minimum of
two years.5 The KSS is a surgeon-completed score and we
are not aware of studies of true PROMs in this age group.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of patient dissat-
isfaction following TKA in young patients. 
Complications. The presence of a post-operative complica-
tion, in particular pain, stiffness or infection, significantly
predicted dissatisfaction on univariate analysis. Previous
studies have shown pain to be the most significant predictor
of dissatisfaction at one year.9,10 While pain scores can be
derived from PROMs, measures of stiffness cannot, and to
our knowledge, have not previously been examined as pre-
dictors of dissatisfaction. Patient-reported stiffness (12/177
knees, 6.8%) was an independent predictor of dissatisfac-
tion on multivariate analysis with a greater influence than
pain. A total of four manipulations were required, which is
slightly greater than some published rates of 1.5% for this
supplementary procedure.35 This may reflect the high inci-
dence of the reported risk factors for manipulation, namely
female gender, age < 60 years, and BMI > 30 kg/m2, in this

population.35 Investigating stiffness further found that a
lack of flexion beyond 90º, rather than a fixed flexion
deformity, was associated with dissatisfaction. This is sur-
prising as persistent fixed flexion deformity forces the
quadriceps to continually contract with associated
increases in energy expenditure, slower walking velocity,
abnormal gait mechanics and overloading of the contra-
lateral limb.36
It has been reported that non-infective modes of TKA
failure tend to be a predominant factor in younger patients
(aseptic loosening, 32%; infection; 17%; instability, 16%;
stiffness, 14%; wear, 9%; pain, 7% and malalignment,
2%).3 Accordingly inferior implant survival in young
patients is often attributed to the effects of high levels of
activity in young patients, sustained over long periods.37 As
confirmed in this study, the indications for TKA in young
patients are often complex. A recent study comparing activ-
ity levels in young (150 patients < 55 years) and older (262
patients 65 to 75 years) patients receiving TKA has con-
firmed that activity levels in this patient cohort are not as
high as expected:37 pre-operatively 87% of the young
group were sedentary or only mildly active versus 77% in
the older group. Post-operatively, 56% and 52%, respec-
tively remained in this low activity category and only 10%
of the young group returned to regular recreational or
sporting activities.37 These low activity scores were attrib-
uted to the preponderance of women in the young cohort,
but also to the higher BMI and non-OA diagnoses present
in the young group. Our cohort was similarly constituted
and the ability to do heavy work or sporting activities cor-
related least with overall satisfaction.
We acknowledge the limitations of this study, which
include its retrospective nature, the lack of other comorbid-
ity data, and of a specific patient activity score. Neverthe-
less, patients receiving TKA aged < 55 years of age had a
high incidence of post-operative dissatisfaction. Offering
TKA when radiographic changes are minimal is questiona-
ble with dissatisfaction rates approaching 60%. While low
radiographic severity of OA, indication for TKA, and the
presence of a complication were all associated with dissat-
isfaction, the most significant independent predictors were
worse pre-operative OKS, poor improvement in the OKS
and ongoing stiffness, particularly limited flexion.
Take home message: 
Patients undergoing TKA when < 55 years of age differ from
the general arthroplasty population and display higher rates
of dissatisfaction, risk factors for which include low grade radiographic
osteoarthritis; indication for TKA; post-operative stiffness in flexion; and
poor OKS improvement.
