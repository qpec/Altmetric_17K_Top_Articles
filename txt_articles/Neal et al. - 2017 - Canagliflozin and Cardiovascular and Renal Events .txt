BACKGROUND
Canagliflozin is a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that reduces glycemia 
as well as blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria in people with diabetes. 
We report the effects of treatment with canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and 
safety outcomes.
METHODS
The CANVAS Program integrated data from two trials involving a total of 10,142 
participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Participants in each 
trial were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin or placebo and were followed 
for a mean of 188.2 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death from 
cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.
RESULTS
The mean age of the participants was 63.3 years, 35.8% were women, the mean 
duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6% had a history of cardiovascular 
disease. The rate of the primary outcome was lower with canagliflozin than with 
placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ra-
tio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority; 
P 
= 
0.02 for superiority). Although on the basis of the prespecified hypothesis test-
ing sequence the renal outcomes are not viewed as statistically significant, the 
results showed a possible benefit of canagliflozin with respect to the progression 
of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and the composite out-
come of a sustained 40% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the 
need for renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal causes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 
95% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Adverse reactions were consistent with the previously re-
ported risks associated with canagliflozin except for an increased risk of amputa-
tion (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 
to 2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal.
CONCLUSIONS
In two trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of car-
diovascular disease, patients treated with canagliflozin had a lower risk of cardio-
vascular events than those who received placebo but a greater risk of amputation, 
primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. (Funded by Janssen Research and

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus is associat-
ed with a substantial risk of cardiovascu-
lar and renal disease.1,2 The use of inhibi-
tors of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
results in favorable effects on biomarkers, includ-
ing glycemia, blood pressure, weight,3 intrarenal 
hemodynamics, and albuminuria,4 and may also 
reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular compli-
cations, kidney disease, and death.5-7 The CANVAS 
Program, comprising two sister trials, was de-
signed to assess the cardiovascular safety and 
efficacy of canagliflozin and to evaluate the bal-
ance between any potential benefits of the drug 
and the risks associated with it, such as genito-
urinary infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, and frac-
ture. The Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment 
Study (CANVAS)8 was initiated in December 2009, 
before the approval of canagliflozin by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), with the initial 
goal of showing cardiovascular safety. The first 
approval of the compound by the FDA occurred 
in March 2013, with interim data from CANVAS. 
Owing to the inclusion of unmasked interim car-
diovascular outcome data in the regulatory filing 
documents, a planned expansion of the sample 
size to enable a test of cardiovascular protection 
was not undertaken. Instead, CANVAS–Renal 
(CANVAS-R)9 was designed as a second CANVAS-
like, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trial to be analyzed jointly with CANVAS, to 
meet a post-approval cardiovascular safety com-
mitment to regulatory agencies. CANVAS-R, 
which commenced in 2014, was also designed to 
assess effects on albuminuria. The integrated 
analysis of CANVAS and CANVAS-R as the 
CANVAS Program10 was undertaken to maximize 
statistical power to detect plausible effects of 
canagliflozin on cardiovascular, kidney, and safe-
ty outcomes as suggested from evolving evidence 
about SGLT2 inhibitors.6,7
Methods
Program Design and Oversight
A total of 667 centers in 30 countries were in-
volved in the two trials. The trials were scheduled 
for joint close-out and analysis when at least 688 
cardiovascular events had been observed and the 
last participant who had undergone randomiza-
tion had approximately 78 weeks of follow-up; 
this occurred in February 2017. The protocols 
for the two trials8,9 were approved by the ethics 
committee at each site and are available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org. All the par-
ticipants provided written informed consent. The 
trials were sponsored by Janssen Research and 
Development and were conducted as a collabora-
tion between the sponsor, an academic steering 
committee, and an academic research organiza-
tion, George Clinical. Members of the commit-
tees are listed in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org. Analyses were carried out 
independently by the sponsor and George Clini-
cal. The first draft of the manuscript was written 
by the first author, with all coauthors participat-
ing in subsequent revisions. MedErgy provided 
medical writing support, funded by the sponsor. 
The authors, who had full access to the data and 
made the final decisions about the content of 
the manuscript, vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and analyses and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication was 
made jointly by all the authors.
Participants
The main criteria for inclusion were identical in 
the two trials (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Participants were men and women 
with type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin level, 
≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) and were either 30 years of 
age or older with a history of symptomatic ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease or 50 years of 
age or older with two or more of the following 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease: duration 
of diabetes of at least 10 years, systolic blood 
pressure higher than 140 mm Hg while they were 
receiving one or more antihypertensive agents, 
current smoking, microalbuminuria or macroal-
buminuria, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cho-
lesterol level of less than 1 mmol per liter (38.7 mg 
per deciliter). Participants were required to have an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 
entry of more than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 
of body-surface area and to meet a range of 
other criteria.
Randomization, Treatment, and Follow-up
All potential participants completed a 2-week, 
single-blind, placebo run-in period. Randomiza-
tion was performed centrally through an interac-
tive Web-based response system with the use of 
a computer-generated randomization schedule 
with randomly permuted blocks that was prepared

Canagliflozin and Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes
by the trial sponsor. Participants in CANVAS were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive cana-
gliflozin at a dose of 300 mg, canagliflozin at a 
dose of 100 mg, or matching placebo, and partici-
pants in CANVAS-R were randomly assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to receive canagliflozin, administered 
at an initial dose of 100 mg daily with an op-
tional increase to 300 mg starting from week 13, 
or matching placebo. Participants and all trial 
staff were unaware of the individual treatment 
assignments until completion of the trial. Use of 
other background therapy for glycemic manage-
ment and other control of risk factors were guided 
by best practice instituted in line with local guide-
lines.
After randomization, face-to-face follow-up was 
scheduled in three visits during the first year and 
at 6-month intervals thereafter, with telephone 
follow-up between face-to-face assessments. Every 
follow-up included inquiry about primary and sec-
ondary outcome events and serious adverse events. 
The urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was mea-
sured every 26 weeks in CANVAS-R and at week 
12 and then annually in CANVAS. Measurement 
of serum creatinine with eGFR was performed at 
least every 26 weeks in both trials. Participants 
who prematurely discontinued the trial regimen 
continued scheduled follow-up whenever possible; 
extensive efforts were made to obtain full outcome 
data for all participants during the final follow-up 
window that spanned November 2016 to Febru-
ary 2017.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of death 
from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes 
planned for sequential conditional hypothesis 
testing were death from any cause, death from 
cardiovascular causes, progression of albumin-
uria, and the composite of death from cardiovas-
cular causes and hospitalization for heart failure 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Pro-
gression of albuminuria was defined as more 
than a 30% increase in albuminuria and a change 
from either normoalbuminuria to microalbumin-
uria or macroalbuminuria or from microalbumin-
uria to macroalbuminuria. If sequential testing 
was not significant for all the outcomes speci-
fied, the remaining outcomes were scheduled for 
assessment as exploratory variables in the inte-
grated data set.
Exploratory cardiovascular outcomes prespec-
ified for evaluation were nonfatal myocardial in-
farction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for 
heart failure,10 and the key prespecified explor-
atory renal outcomes were regression of albumin-
uria (using criteria comparable to those defined 
for category progression) and the renal compos-
ite comprising a 40% reduction in eGFR sustained 
for at least two consecutive measures, the need for 
renal-replacement therapy (dialysis or transplan-
tation), or death from renal causes (defined as 
death with a proximate renal cause). Evaluation 
of total hospitalizations was also prespecified.
All major cardiovascular events, renal out-
comes, and deaths, plus selected safety outcomes, 
were adjudicated by end-point adjudication com-
mittees. The members of the committees and the 
definitions that were used for the clinical events 
are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Inter-
mediate markers of cardiovascular risk and re-
quirement for antihyperglycemic agents were as-
sessed to help understand the observed effects 
on cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Analyses 
of safety included adverse events coded with the 
use of the latest version of the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For bone frac-
ture, the primary prespecified analysis was for 
low-trauma fracture events, but secondary analysis 
of all fractures was also performed. Amputations 
were assessed overall, but the numbers of cases 
above and below the ankle were also reported.
Statistical Analysis
The primary hypothesis test was a test of nonin-
feriority, with the use of a margin of 1.3 for the 
hazard ratio for the primary outcome with cana-
gliflozin as compared with placebo in the full, 
integrated data set (i.e., all available follow-up 
data from all participants who underwent ran-
domization) and with the intention-to-treat ap-
proach. We calculated that with 688 cardiovascu-
lar safety events recorded across the trials, there 
would be at least 90% power, at an alpha level of 
0.05, to exclude an upper margin of the 95% 
confidence interval for the hazard ratio of 1.3. 
Cardiovascular safety was to be shown if the up-
per boundary of the 95% confidence interval of 
the hazard ratio with canagliflozin as compared 
with placebo was less than 1.3, and superiority 
was to be shown if the upper boundary was less 
than 1.0. Hypothesis testing was scheduled to 
proceed sequentially, conditional on the primary

safety hypothesis and each subsequent test for 
superiority being met in the full, integrated data 
set; in a truncated data set; or in the CANVAS-R 
data set (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
In addition to the formal hypothesis testing, a 
supplementary set of exploratory analyses of car-
diovascular outcomes, renal outcomes, death, and 
hospitalizations was prespecified for the full, inte-
grated data set with all available follow-up of all 
participants who underwent randomization.10
Hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and 
P values were estimated with Cox regression 
models,11 with stratification according to trial and 
history of cardiovascular disease, for all cana-
gliflozin groups combined versus placebo. P values 
for efficacy were reported only when the hypoth-
esis was proved. Supplementary analysis with 
imputation for missing data by multiple imputa-
tion was performed for the primary outcome. 
Hypothesis testing of the other outcomes in the 
sequence was not performed beyond the first non-
significant result. For all subsequent outcomes, 
which were exploratory, reporting was restricted 
to the hazard ratio estimates and the nominal 
95% confidence intervals. Annualized incidence 
rates were calculated per 1000 patient-years of 
follow-up.
The analyses of albuminuria were based on 
participants with progression or regression on at 
least one occasion, with a sensitivity analysis per-
formed for those with evidence of sustained pro-
gression or regression. Unless otherwise specified, 
on-treatment analysis (with data from patients 
who had a safety outcome while they were re-
ceiving canagliflozin or placebo or within 30 
days after discontinuation of the drug or pla-
cebo) was the primary approach used for the 
safety assessments. The exception was for frac-
ture, amputation, cancer, and diabetic ketoaci-
dosis outcomes, for which analyses included 
participants who received at least one dose of 
drug or placebo and had an event at any time 
during follow-up. Effects of canagliflozin on 
continuous outcomes were assessed with the 
use of mixed models12 that included all ob-
served longitudinal data and assumed that 
missing data were missing at random. For all 
outcome analyses, we tested the homogeneity 
of treatment effects across the two contribut-
ing trials. Analyses were performed with SAS 
software, version 9.2, and SAS Enterprise 
Guide, version 7.11.
Results
Participants
The two trials involved a total of 10,142 partici-
pants, 4330 in CANVAS and 5812 in CANVAS-R. 
A total of 9734 participants (96.0%) completed 
the trial (i.e., were alive and were assessed for 
safety and efficacy outcomes during the final fol-
low-up window or died before the final follow-
up). Vital status was confirmed for 10,100 of the 
10,142 participants (99.6%). The mean follow-up 
was 188.2 weeks, and the median follow-up 126.1 
weeks; the length of follow-up was similar in the 
canagliflozin and placebo groups but was longer 
in CANVAS (295.9 weeks) than in CANVAS-R 
(108.0 weeks). A total of 29.2% of the participants 
assigned to canagliflozin and 29.9% of those as-
signed to placebo discontinued the assigned regi-
men prematurely. (Additional information on the 
participants can be found in Figs. S2 and S3 and 
Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
The mean age of the participants was 63.3 
years, 35.8% were women, the mean duration of 
diabetes was 13.5 years, the mean eGFR was 
76.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, and the median 
urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 12.3 (as 
measured in milligrams of albumin and grams 
of creatinine) (Table 1). Among the participants, 
22.6% had microalbuminuria, 7.6% had macro-
albuminuria, and 65.6% had a history of cardio-
vascular disease at baseline. A total of 71.4% of 
CANVAS-R participants in the canagliflozin group 
had the dose of canagliflozin increased to 300 mg 
during the trial. Patients received other appropriate 
therapies for the management of glycemia and 
cardiovascular risks (Table 1, and Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Baseline characteris-
tics were balanced in the canagliflozin and pla-
cebo groups (Table 1) and were similar across 
CANVAS and CANVAS-R (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Intermediate Markers of Cardiovascular Risk
The mean difference in glycated hemoglobin level 
between the canagliflozin group and the placebo 
group was –0.58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
–0.61 to –0.56), the mean difference in body 
weight was –1.60 kg (95% CI, –1.70 to –1.51), the 
mean difference in systolic blood pressure was 
–3.93 mm Hg (95% CI, –4.30 to –3.56), and the 
mean difference in diastolic blood pressure was 
–1.39 mm Hg (95% CI, –1.61 to –1.17) (P<0.001

for all comparisons) (Fig. 1). The use of other 
antihyperglycemic agents during follow-up was 
9.3% lower (95% CI, –11.0 to –7.6) in the cana-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group. The 
level of HDL cholesterol was higher in the cana-
gliflozin group than in the placebo group (by 
2.05 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 1.77 to 2.33 [0.05 
mmol per liter; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.06]), as was the 
level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
(by 4.68 mg per deciliter; 95% CI, 3.64 to 5.73 
[0.12 mmol per liter; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.15]); the 
ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol was 
unchanged (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Cardiovascular Outcomes, Death,  
and Hospitalizations
Significantly fewer participants in the canagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group had a primary 
outcome event (the composite of death from car-
diovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
or nonfatal stroke): 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants with 
an event per 1000 patient-years (hazard ratio, 
0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninfe-
riority; P 
= 
0.02 for superiority) (Figs. 2 and 3). 
The effects on the primary outcome were nearly 
the same when imputation for missing events was 
performed (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 
0.97). There were broadly consistent effects across 
a wide range of prespecified subgroups (Fig. 4), 
except for subgroups defined according to base-
line use of diuretics (P<0.001 for homogeneity). 
Superiority was not shown for the first second-
ary outcome in the testing sequence (death from 
any cause; P 
= 
0.24), and hypothesis testing was 
discontinued. Therefore, estimates for the fatal 
secondary outcomes, including death from any 
cause (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.01) 
and death from cardiovascular causes (hazard 
ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.06), are not consid-
ered to be significant (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). Effect 
estimates for exploratory cardiovascular outcomes 
are shown in Figures 2, 3, and 5. There was no 
evidence of differences in effects between the 
CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials for the primary, 
fatal, or exploratory cardiovascular outcomes 
(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Renal Outcomes
Progression of albuminuria occurred less frequent-
ly among participants assigned to canagliflozin 
than among those assigned to placebo (89.4 vs. 
128.7 participants with an event per 1000 patient-
years), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.73 
(95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) (Figs. 3 and 5); the effects 
were greater in CANVAS-R (hazard ratio, 0.64; 
95% CI, 0.57 to 0.73) than in CANVAS (hazard 
ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.90) (P 
= 
0.02 for 
homogeneity) (Table S7 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Regression of albuminuria also occurred 
more frequently among those assigned to cana-
gliflozin than among those assigned to placebo 
(293.4 vs. 187.5 participants with regression per 
1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 
1.51 to 1.91). The composite outcome of sustained 
40% reduction in eGFR, the need for renal-replace-
ment therapy, or death from renal causes occurred 
less frequently among participants in the cana-
gliflozin group than among those in the placebo 
group (5.5 vs. 9.0 participants with the outcome 
per 1000 patient-years, corresponding to a haz-
ard ratio of 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.77) (Figs. 3 
and 5); no significant difference in this outcome 
was seen between CANVAS and CANVAS-R (Ta-
ble S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety Outcomes
Serious adverse events were less common among 
participants assigned to canagliflozin than among 
those assigned to placebo (104.3 vs. 120.0 par-
ticipants with an event per 1000 patient-years; 
hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.00). Adverse 
events leading to discontinuation did not differ 
significantly between groups (35.5 vs. 32.8 par-
ticipants with an event per 1000 patient-years; 
hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.28) (Ta-
ble 2). There was a higher risk of amputation of 
toes, feet, or legs with canagliflozin than with 
placebo (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants with amputation 
per 1000 patient-years, corresponding to a haz-
ard ratio of 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.75), with 71% 
of the affected participants having their highest 
amputation at the level of the toe or metatarsal 
(Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The high-
est absolute risk of amputation occurred among 
patients who had a history of amputation or pe-
ripheral vascular disease, but the relative risk of 
amputation with canagliflozin as compared with 
placebo was similar across these subgroups (Table 
S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Previously reported risks of adverse events of 
interest attributable to infections of male or female 
genitalia, volume depletion, and diuresis were ob-
served. We detected no higher risks of hypogly-

Figure 2. Cardiovascular Outcomes in the Integrated CANVAS Program.
The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
the primary outcome and the components of the outcome were estimated with the use of Cox regression models with stratification according to trial and history of cardiovascular 
disease for all canagliflozin groups combined versus placebo. Analyses are based upon the full, integrated data set comprising all participants who underwent randomization. The

Canagliflozin and Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes
cemia, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, pancre-
atitis, malignancies, or venous thromboembolism 
with canagliflozin than with placebo. The rate of 
all fractures was higher with canagliflozin than 
with placebo (15.4 vs. 11.9 participants with frac-
ture per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.26; 
95% CI, 1.04 to 1.52), and there was a similar 
trend with respect to low-trauma fracture events 
(11.6 vs. 9.2 participants with fracture per 1000 
patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99 to 
1.52). There was evidence of heterogeneity in the 
bone-fracture findings between CANVAS and 
CANVAS-R with respect to both low-trauma frac-
ture and all fracture (both P≤0.005), with risks 
higher in the canagliflozin group than in the 
placebo group in CANVAS but not in CANVAS-R 
(Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). Only 
a small number of events of diabetic ketoacidosis 
were observed with canagliflozin and placebo (0.6 
vs. 0.3 participants with an event per 1000 patient-
years; hazard ratio, 2.33; 95% CI, 0.76 to 7.17).
Discussion
Patients with type 2 diabetes and established car-
diovascular disease or at high risk for cardiovas-
cular events who were treated with canagliflozin 
had significantly lower rates of the primary car-
diovascular outcome than patients assigned to 
placebo. All three components of the primary 
outcome — death from cardiovascular causes, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal 
stroke — showed point estimates of effect that 
suggested benefit, although the individual effects 
did not reach significance. The results also showed 
that patients treated with canagliflozin had a

CANVAS Program.
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the use of Cox regression models, with stratifica-
tion according to trial and history of cardiovascular disease for all canagliflozin groups combined versus placebo. 
For the primary outcome (the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or 
nonfatal stroke), P<0.001 for noninferiority and P = 0.02 for superiority. Progression of albuminuria was evaluated 
with data from the 9015 participants with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria at baseline. The composite renal 
outcome was a 40% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the need for renal-replacement 
therapy, or death from renal causes. The 40% reduction in eGFR was required to be sustained, which was defined 
as being present on at least two consecutive measurements more than 30 days apart, and adjudicated by an expert 
committee. The need for renal-replacement therapy owing to end-stage kidney disease was defined as a need for 
dialysis for at least 30 days or transplantation and was required to be adjudicated by an expert committee. Death 
from renal causes was defined as death for which the proximate cause was renal as defined by the end-point adju-
dication committee. There were three deaths from renal causes, all in the placebo group.

Canagliflozin and Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes
lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure, 
progression of albuminuria, and substantive loss 
of kidney function than patients who received 
placebo, although on the basis of the prespecified 
hypothesis testing sequence these findings are 
not considered statistically significant.
Several established effects of SGLT2 inhibi-
tors on intermediate outcomes may contribute to 
cardiovascular and renal protection. Although 
pleiotropic effects have been inferred, improved 
glycemic control, lowering of blood pressure, de-
crease in intraglomerular pressure, reduction in 
albuminuria, and amelioration of volume over-
load are all plausible protective mechanisms.4,13-23
The effects on cardiovascular and renal out-
comes observed within this program of two inte-
grated trials are similar to those observed 
previously with this drug class.5,6 The favorable 
direction of effect with respect to stroke ob-
served in this trial program differs from a previ-
ously reported possible adverse effect on stroke 
risk.5,6 Apparent differences in the effect sizes for 
other secondary and exploratory outcomes may 
be attributable to chance, since precision in the 
effect estimates of each is limited. Although it is 
also possible that variation in effect sizes could 
reflect features of trial design or actual differences 
between the agents, additional data will be re-
quired to clarify the differing results.
The possible benefit of canagliflozin use with 
respect to renal outcomes is supported by the 
magnitude of the effects observed, the consistency 
of the observation across renal outcomes, and the 
consistency of the findings with other recently 
reported data.12 Prespecification, confirmation, 
and adjudication of the renal outcomes in this 
trial program add support to the possibility that 
SGLT2 inhibition may have an important kidney-
protective effect in type 2 diabetes. Since most 
renal events were based on changes in eGFR, more 
data are required to confirm the effects on kidney 
failure. Definitive evidence about the effects of 
canagliflozin on clinical kidney outcomes are 
likely to be provided by the ongoing Canagliflozin 
and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established 
Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial (CREDENCE; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02065791).
The adverse effects observed in this program 
of two integrated trials are generally consistent 
with the known safety profile of canagliflozin 
and other SGLT2 inhibitors.5 The increased rate 
of amputation is a new finding for which the 
mechanism is unknown, and care is warranted 
in the use of canagliflozin in patients at risk for 
amputation. An increase in bone fractures has 
been described previously with canagliflozin,24 
but the excess in bone fracture seen in CANVAS 
was not observed in CANVAS-R. There is no clear 
explanation for the difference in fracture risk be-
tween the two trials, which included directly com-
parable patient groups and assessed the same 
intervention.
The trial program has certain strengths. It 
benefits from the large size of the combined tri-
als, the long duration of the trials, the random-
ized design, the breadth of included participants, 
and the high standard to which the conduct of 
the trials was held. The inclusion of participants 
with and those without established cardiovascu-
lar disease extends the population for which data 
are available.
The trial program has certain limitations, the 
major one being the moderate number of events 
for many important outcomes — in particular, 
the paucity of events of end-stage kidney disease. 
The relatively small proportion of participants with 
established kidney disease also limits general-
ization to that population. The large number of 
analyses and relatively few events increases the 
risk of false positive findings, though the broad 
internal and external consistency of the data 
strengthens the conclusions. Discontinuation of 
randomized therapy and greater use of other glu-
cose-lowering agents in the placebo group dur-
ing the trial program is the likely explanation 
for the convergence of glycated hemoglobin levels 
over time and may have resulted in underestima-
tion of any benefits and risks associated with 
canagliflozin.
In summary, the trial program showed that 
among patients with type 2 diabetes who had an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, patients

Primary Cardiovascular Outcome in Subgroups.
A total of 10,142 participants were included in the 
analysis. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
were estimated with the use of Cox regression models. 
P values for homogeneity were obtained by fitting in-
teraction terms. The body-mass index (BMI) is the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the 
height in meters. The analysis according to the history 
of heart failure was not prespecified. RAAS denotes 
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Canagliflozin and Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes
treated with canagliflozin had a significantly 
lower risk of death from cardiovascular causes, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke 
than those who received placebo but a greater 
risk of amputation.

Analyses were performed on data from the on-treatment data set (patients who had a safety outcome while they were 
receiving canagliflozin or placebo or within 30 days after discontinuation of the drug or placebo), except for fracture, 
amputation, cancer, and diabetic ketoacidosis outcomes, which included all events at any time point in all patients who 
underwent randomization and received at least one dose of canagliflozin or placebo.
†  
P values were estimated from Cox regression models.
‡  
Low-trauma fracture was the prespecified primary fracture outcome, and all fracture was a secondary outcome.
§  
Infection of male genitalia included balanitis, phimosis, and events leading to circumcision.
¶  
For these adverse events, the annualized incidence rates are reported with data from CANVAS alone through January 7, 
2014, because after this time, only serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation were collected. 
In CANVAS-R, only serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation were collected. Owing to the 
differences between the two trials in methods of collection of the data, an integrated analysis of these adverse events is 
not possible.
