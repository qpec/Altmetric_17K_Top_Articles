Abstract
Insecticide resistance in German cockroaches (Blattella germanica (L.)) has been a barrier to effective control since
its first documentation in the 1950s. A necessary first step toward managing resistance is to understand insecticide
susceptibility profiles in field-collected strains so that active ingredients (AIs) with lowest resistance levels can be
identified. As a first step in this study, diagnostic concentrations (DCs) were determined for 14 insecticide AIs based
on lethal concentrations that killed 99% or 90% of the individuals from a susceptible lab strain (JWax-S). Next, cock-
roaches were collected from two low-income multifamily housing complexes in Danville, IL, and Indianapolis, IN,
and used to establish laboratory strains. These strains were screened against the 14 AI-DCs in vial bioassays, and
susceptibility profiles were determined by comparing percent mortalities between the field strains relative to the
JWax-S strain. Results revealed lowest resistance of field strains to boric acid, abamectin, dinotefuran, clothianidin,
thiamethoxam, and chlorfenapyr. For the AIs hydramethylnon and imidacloprid, field strains did not display survi-
vorship different than the lab strain, but >90% mortality was never achieved. Lastly, both field strains displayed
resistance to indoxacarb, fipronil, acetamiprid, beta-cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin, but at varying
levels. These results satisfy two objectives. First, baseline monitoring DCs were established for 14 insecticides
presently registered for use against cockroaches, which represents a useful resource. Second, our findings reveal
insecticide AIs with lowest resistance levels for use in forthcoming field studies that will investigate impacts of dif-
ferent insecticide deployment strategies on resistance management and evolution in cockroach field populations.

Low-income multifamily apartments are commonly infested with
German
cockroaches
(Blattella
germanica
L.)
(Dictyoptera:
Blattellidae). Cockroach allergens in these environments are associ-
ated with negative health effects such as asthma and rhinitis in resi-
dents, especially children (Wang et al. 2008, Celmeli et al. 2016, Do
et al. 2016). To a great extent, asthma morbidity in sensitive chil-
dren can be affected more by exposure to cockroach allergens than
dust mite or pet allergens (Gruchalla et al. 2005). Bacterial patho-
gens have also been isolated from German cockroaches trapped in
houses and food processing facilities and thus they can be potential
vectors for foodborne pathogens (Kopanic et al. 1994, Tatfeng et al.
2005, Menasria et al. 2014). Therefore, cockroach control practices
have become part of the pest management routines for housing and
food handling facilities. Cockroach baits have been used in inte-
grated pest management (IPM) as a cost-effective control strategy
(Schal and Hamilton 1990, Wang and Bennett 2006). Despite the
initial success of baiting in controlling cockroach populations and
reducing resident exposure to insecticides, recent reports indicate

AIs
(Gondhalekar and Scharf 2012, Gondhalekar et al. 2013, Ko et al.
2016a). Historically, German cockroaches have been able to de-
velop extensive resistance to different insecticides (Cochran 1995).
Insecticide resistance in laboratory and field-collected German cock-
roaches has been reported for decades (Bennett and Spink 1968;
Koehler and Patterson 1986; Cochran 1987; Umeda et al. 1988;
Cochran 1989; Hemingway et al. 1993a, 1993b; Valles and Yu
1996; Lee et al. 1996; Scharf et al. 1997; Scharf et al. 1998; Wei
et al. 2001; Holbrook et al. 2003; Gondhalekar et al. 2011, 2013;
Ko et al. 2016a; Naqqash et al. 2016). In total, German cockroaches
have shown resistance to 43 active ingredients (AIs) (Whalon et al.
2016), and therefore, resistance management has become a priority
in any cockroach IPM program.

 Insecticide resistance in cockroaches varies between populations
collected from different regions, as they may have resistance to some
AIs but not others (Cochran 1989, Georghiou 1994) depending on se-
lection history (Scharf et al. 1997). Knowledge of resistance profiles in
a cockroach population is a key for making informed pest manage-
ment
decisions
for
preventing
insecticide
resistance
evolution
(Gondhalekar and Scharf 2013, Zhu et al. 2016). Insecticide resistance
in German cockroaches can be classified into the two broad groups of
physiological and behavioral resistance (Cochran 1995, Silverman and
Bieman 1993, Wu et al. 1998, Wang et al. 2004, Liu et al. 2006, Zhu
et al. 2016). Here we focus on physiological rather than behavioral
(bait aversion) aspects of resistance in German cockroaches.
Discriminating dose- or concentration-based approaches have
been used successfully for detecting fipronil and indoxacarb resis-
tance in German cockroach field strains (Holbrook et al. 2003,
Gondhalekar et al. 2011, 2013). The research presented here tar-
geted the problem in urban pest management posed by cockroach
resistance, using an unprecedented resistance monitoring-based ap-
proach that included 14 AIs and a glass vial bioassay method.
Extensive prior research documented the vial bioassay method (e.g.,
Scharf et al. 1999), which works based on cockroach tarsal contact
with insecticide residues and ingestion via tarsal grooming (Scharf
et al. 1995). Diagnostic concentration (DC) bioassays are less labor-
intensive and require fewer insects in comparison to the conven-
tional resistance ratio method, which initially requires generation of
concentration- or dose-mortality data for LC or LD estimation
(Gondhalekar et al. 2013). The goals of this study were to 1) de-
velop DCs for commonly used cockroach insecticide AIs, and 2) test
the DCs against cockroach strains collected from two multifamily
housing sites in advance of field studies. Based on the screening re-
sults, we are able to recommend insecticide AIs for subsequent resis-
tance management studies to be conducted at the two field sites.
More generally, our findings also provide diagnostic concentration
information that can be used to help pest managers make more in-
formed insecticide choices and help researchers to study resistance
evolution under field conditions.
Materials and Methods
Insects and Chemicals
Three German cockroach strains were used. The Johnson Wax
strain (JWax-S) has been maintained in the laboratory for >80 yr
without insecticide exposure and was used as a standard susceptible
strain. Two field strains were collected from multifamily housing
sites in Danville, IL (D-IL strain), and Indianapolis, IN (I-IN strain),
during December 2014 and March 2015. Full human subjects re-
search approval was granted by the Purdue University Institutional
Review Board (Protocol number 1411015460R001). The field
strains were collected from multiple apartments across each site and
pooled to establish laboratory “meta” populations. These popula-
tions were maintained without insecticide selection pressure. Colonies
were reared in Ziploc plastic containers (44.3 by 30 by17 cm3/
15.14 liter; S.C. Johnson Inc., Racine WI, USA) with screened lids
and held in a controlled-environmental chamber at 26 6 1 �C and a
photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h. Cardboard for shelter, rodent diet
(number 8604; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI), and water were pro-
vided ad libitum to the rearing boxes. Bioassay experiments were
done with 1–2-wk-old adult males. To obtain enough adult males of
appropriate age for experiments, rearing containers were established
with gravid adult females and mixed-age nymphs. Adult male cock-
roaches were separated out of these containers at the beginning of
every week and aged for an additional week before using in
insecticide bioassays. All bioassays with field strains were performed
after three to four generations (within 12 mo after collection).
Technical grade gel bait and spray product AIs used in vial bioas-
says were purchased from ChemService (West Chester, PA), Fisher
Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA), or Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). These
AIs included indoxacarb (99.1% purity), abamectin (98.3%), boric
acid (99.9%), beta-cyfluthrin (99.5%), bifenthrin (99%), lambda-
cyhalothrin (99.5%), fipronil (98.3%), dinotefuran (98.4%), imidaclo-
prid (99.4%), acetamiprid (99.5%), clothianidin (99.5%), thiamethoxam
(99.5%), chlorfenapyr (99.1%), and hydramethylnon (99.5%).
These AIs were selected because they are currently registered for use
in cockroach control products. Three cockroach gel baits, InVict
Gold (imidacloprid 2.15%; Rockwell Lab Ltd, Kansas City, MO),
Maxforce Professional Insect Control (hydramethylnon 2.15%; Bayer,
Research Triangle Park, NC), and Magnetic (boric acid 33.3%; Nisus
Co., Rockford, TN) were purchased from Univar (Indianapolis, IN)
for follow-up testing in no-choice feeding bioassays.
Vial Bioassay for JWax-S LC and DC Estimates
As a first step in the resistance monitoring process, the JWax-S strain
was prescreened against the 14 AIs listed above to determine lethal
concentrations (LCs) and DCs. Insecticides and test concentrations are
outlined in Supp. Table 1 [online only]. Bioassays were conducted in
30-ml Shell vials (25by95mm; Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ). The in-
ternal surface of the vials (71.67cm2) was treated with 0.5 ml insecti-
cide dilutions. Approximately 1cm from the top of the vial was left
untreated, as it would be covered by a cotton plug. Insecticide dilutions
were made in acetone with the exception of boric acid, which was dis-
solved in methanol and used immediately after preparation. Insecticide
solutions were mixed thoroughly before being applied to each vial.
After addition of insecticide solutions, vials were rotated manually for
1min and then on a nonheating hotdog roller (Nostalgia Products
LLC, Green Bay, WI) placed in a fume hood. Complete evaporation of
acetone or methanol required �30min. Vials treated with acetone or
methanol only were used as controls. Adult male cockroaches held in
plastic cups were anesthetized on ice before transferring to individual
vials in groups of 10. Glass vials were plugged with cotton balls to
prevent escape. Treated and control vials were kept vertically in
controlled-environmental chambers with atmospheric conditions similar
to those used for rearing. Concentration–mortality data for the JWax-S
strain was generated by testing 8–18 concentrations for each insecticide
AI (Supp. Table 1 [online only]). For each insecticide concentration, 4–
12 replicates were performed depending on the consistency of mortality
responses. Mortality was recorded every 24h up to 72h. Owing to the
slower speed of action of boric acid and hydramethylnon, mortality was
scored up to 96h. Insects were considered dead if they were knocked
down on their backs and unable to recover on their feet or walk.
To determine LC90 and LC99 estimates for each insecticide, JWax-S
concentration–mortality data were analyzed using the PROC PROBIT
function in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute 2012-2013). Control mortality was
accounted for in probit analysis by the method of Abbott (Abbott
1925). To improve probit model estimation, multiple concentrations
were tested to achieve symmetrically spaced mortality around 50%,
and to increase precision of LC90/LC99 estimates, multiple concentra-
tions providing 75–100% mortality were also tested (Robertson et al.
1984). The LC90 or LC99 estimates and their corresponding 95%
fiducial limits (FLs) for each insecticide were used as reference values
and then, they were checked against JWax-S concentration–mortality
data for selecting baseline DCs. The lowest concentrations that
provided 90 or 99–100% mortality (raw data) in the JWax-S strain
were also taken into consideration while determining DCs. If 100%

 mortality was not achieved in the JWax-S strain when exposed to any
AI, or in cases where 99% mortality would require an excessively high
diagnostic concentration (i.e., for boric acid, hydramethylnon, and imi-
dacloprid), LC90 values were used to determine DCs. Justification for
using 72- or 96-h mortality data and different LC values is explained in
more detail under Results and Discussion.
Vial Diagnostic Bioassay to Determine Susceptibility
Profiles of Cockroach Strains to AIs
To establish insecticide susceptibility profiles in the field-collected D-IL
and I-IN strains, adult males were tested at DCs determined for 14 AIs.
As a positive control, adult males of the susceptible JWax-S strain were
also tested at the respective DCs in parallel with field strains.
Diagnostic insecticide concentrations were prepared in either acetone
or methanol, and 10 replications were performed for each strain and in-
secticide. Ten replications of acetone or methanol treated vials for each
strain were used as controls. Mortality was scored as described above.
For comparing mortality variation between the three strains
(JWax-S, D-IL, and I-IN), percentage mortality from diagnostic bio-
assays with individual AIs were arcsine transformed and analyzed
by two-way factorial ANOVA in Statistica 13 (Dell Inc. 2015) fol-
lowed by a post hoc Tukey’s HSD test.
Follow-Up No-Choice Feeding Bioassays With
Commercial Gel Baits Containing Boric Acid,
Hydramethylnon, and Imidacloprid
Three gel bait products were screened against the JWax-S, I-IN, and
D-IL strains to determine if similar mortality levels could be achieved
as seen in AI-DC assays. The gel baits included InVict Gold (imidaclo-
prid), Maxforce Professional Insect Control (hydramethylnon), and
Magnetic (boric acid). Procedures as described previously in other
studies were used with small modifications (Wang et al. 2004,
Gondhalekar et al. 2011). Plastic containers (17.8by17.8by 6cm3/
0.739liter) were used (Glad boxes Clorox Co., Oakland, CA). These
bioassays were conducted in a no-choice format in which no compet-
ing food was provided. Polystyrene weighing dishes (Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA) filled with 0.5g gel bait, a water cup, and cardboard
shelter were provided in each container. For controls, the gel bait was
replaced with 0.5g rodent diet. Seven to ten 1–2-wk-old adult males
were starved for one day before assaying. To prevent escape, container
walls were lightly greased with petroleum jelly and mineral oil (2:3)
and containers were closed tightly with lids containing a central
meshed opening (3cm diameter). Five replications were done for each
strain–treatment combination. Mortality was checked every 24h until
100% mortality was achieved in all strains. To assure no recovery oc-
curred, all assay boxes were kept 72h after 100% mortality was
achieved. For comparing variation among strains, mortality data were
analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) in Statistica
13 (Dell Inc. 2015), followed by univariate tests of significance for
each day. To determine LT50, LT90, and LT99 estimates, time–mortal-
ity data were analyzed using the PROC PROBIT function in SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute 2012-2013). Control mortality was accounted for in
probit analysis by the method of Abbott (Abbott 1925).
Results
Vial LC and DC Estimates for the JWax-S Strain
Although cockroach mortality data were collected every 24 h for
3–4 d, only 72 h and 96 h results were used for probit analysis, as
these times provided data that were best fit to the probit model
(Supp. Figs. 1–6 [online only]). LC50, LC90, and LC99 estimates,
DCs, and other probit model parameters for each insecticide are
presented in Tables 1 and 2. For most insecticides, DCs were chosen
based on JWax-S 72 h concentration–mortality data, and corre-
sponding LC99 values and 95% FLs (Table 1); however, owing to
the use of different strategies for determining DCs for boric acid,
hydramethylnon, and imidacloprid (Table 2), results for these AIs
are presented separately in the Special cases section below.
Susceptibility Profiles of Cockroach Strains to AIs
Determined Using LC99 DCs
Percent mortality comparisons for the three strains for 14 AIs at their
respective DCs are detailed in Fig. 1. Two-way factorial ANOVA re-
sults are summarized in Supp. Table 2 [online only]. Exposure to aba-
mectin, dinotefuran, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam DCs resulted in
high mortality of both field strains. Complete mortality was achieved
in the JWax-S and I-IN strains when they were exposed to the aba-
mectin DC; however, mortality in the D-IL strain (84.4%) was signifi-
cantly lower (Fig. 1A; Supp. Fig. 1 [online only]). Average mortality
for the I-IN strain was 90–93% when exposed to the dinotefuran, clo-
thianidin, or thiamethoxam DCs. Lower mortality in the range of 79–
84% was achieved for the D-IL strain when exposed to the same DCs
as above with dinotefuran, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam (Fig. 1A;
Supp. Fig. 2 [online only]). There were significant mortality differ-
ences among strains when tested against DCs of dinotefuran, clothia-
nidin, and thiamethoxam.
Acetamiprid and chlorfenapyr DC assays resulted in 60–90%
mortality in the field strains, while 99–100% mortality was achieved
in JWax-S. When exposed to acetamiprid at its DC, only 65 6 6%
and 59 6 7% mortality were achieved in I-IN and D-IL strains. For
chlorfenapyr, significantly lower mortality was observed in the I-IN
and D-IL field strains (89 6 2% and 78 6 5% mortality, respec-
tively) compared with JWax-S (Fig. 1A).
Finally, I-IN strain mortality when exposed to indoxacarb was
59 6 8%, but it was <20% for fipronil, beta-cyfluthrin, bifenthrin,
and lambda-cyhalothrin (1 6 1, 7 6 2, 4 6 2, and 17 6 3% mortal-
ity, respectively). Mortality in the D-IL stain was <20% in all in-
stances with indoxacarb, fipronil, beta-cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, and
lambda-cyhalothrin
DCs
(19 6 5,
33 6 5,
8 6 3,
11 6 4,
and
14 6 3% mortality, respectively; Fig. 1A).
Special Cases: Susceptibility Profiles of Cockroach
Strains to Boric Acid, Hydramethylnon, and
Imidacloprid as Determined Using LC90 DCs
Diagnostic concentration determinations for boric acid, hydramethyl-
non, and imidacloprid were done with slight modifications from that
detailed above. Boric acid and hydramethylnon concentration–mortal-
ity data for JWax-S were scored after 96h (Table 2 and Supp. Table 2
[online only]; Fig. 1B; Supp. Fig. 6 [online only]). JWax-S LC90 values
and 95% FLs were used in boric acid and hydramethylnon DC deter-
minations. In the case of imidacloprid, 72-h mortality data were used;
however, imidacloprid treatment with high technical AI concentrations
of up to 8 mg vial�1 did not result in 100% mortality of the JWax-S lab
strain. Hence, a concentration of 7 mg vial�1 that was within the LC90
95% FLs was selected as the imidacloprid DC (Table 2).
Boric acid killed the highest proportions of the field strains
among all insecticides at its DC. There were no significant differ-
ences among lab and field strain mortality levels with boric acid; i.e.,
100% mortality was achieved for the JWax-S and I-IN strains, while
98 6 4% mortality was obtained in the D-IL strain (Fig. 1B; Supp.
Fig. 6 [online only]). Mortality was comparatively lower for all
three strains with imidacloprid (JWax-S: 76 6 4%, I-IN: 64 6 10%,
and D-IL: 71 6 6%) and hydramethylnon (JWax-S: 78 6 7, I-IN:

 59 6 18, and D-IL: 50 6 12%) at their DCs of 7 and 16 mg vial � 1,
respectively (Fig. 1B; Supp. Fig. 6 [online only]). When assayed
with either imidacloprid or hydramethylnon, there were no statisti-
cally significant differences among the three strains based on
Tukey’s HSD tests.
No-Choice Feeding Bioassay Results With Commercial
Boric Acid, Hydramethylnon, and Imidacloprid Gel Baits
Percent mortality up to 7 d is shown for all three strains when pro-
vided gel baits containing boric acid, hydramethylnon, or imidaclo-
prid (Fig. 2). Based on multivariate tests of significance, there were
no differences in overall mortality among different strains when fed
gel
baits

acid
(P¼ 0.1774)
or
imidacloprid
(P¼ 0.0904); however, when provided hydramethylnon gel bait,
field strains survived significantly longer than the JWax-S strain (P
¼ 0.0375). LT50 values for different gel baits determined through
probit analysis ranged between 0.05 to 3.9 d for the JWax-S, I-IN,
and D-IL strains (Supp. Table 3 [online only]). When exposed to
Magnetic (boric acid), strain–mortality levels were significantly dif-
ferent across the first four assay days based on univariate results
[day 1: (F¼ 6.5(2, 12) P¼ 0.01), day 2: (F¼ 6.5(2, 12) P¼ 0.01), day 3:
(F¼ 4.8(2, 12) P¼ 0.03), and day 4: (F¼ 4.8 (2, 12) P¼ 0.03)], but
100% mortality was still achieved after 7 d for all strains. Magnetic
LT50 values were significantly different for the JWax-S and both
field strains, but not LT90 or LT99 (Supp. Table 3 [online only]).
Maxforce Pro (hydramethylnon) had significantly different mortality
among strains on days 1–4 as well [day 1: (F¼ 16.43(2, 12) P¼ 0.0004),
day 2: (F¼ 17.24(2, 12) P¼ 0.0003), day 3: (F¼ 9.71(2, 12) P¼ 0.0031),
and day 4: (F¼ 4.07(2, 12) P¼ 0.0447)], with LT50, LT90, and LT99
values also being different (Supp. Table 3 [online only]). With InVict
Gold (imidacloprid) gel bait, >90% mortality was achieved for all
strains within 1 d after starting assays. Owing to recovery of
cockroaches, there were differences among strain–mortality levels on
day 4 [F¼ 14.04(2, 12) P¼ 0.0007], but LT50, LT90, and LT99 values
for InVict Gold analysis were not different among strains (Supp.
Table 3 [online only]).
Discussion
There is currently a pressing need for sustainable resistance manage-
ment programs for German cockroaches in public housing that can
1) effectively manage populations and 2) delay insecticide resistance
evolution. One of the critical elements in the success of resistance
management programs for cockroaches is knowledge of their resis-
tance status to different AIs. In this study, after first developing new
DCs for a wide range of currently available AIs, susceptibility pro-
files were determined for cockroaches collected from low-income
multifamily housing sites in Danville, IL, and Indianapolis, IN, by
extensive laboratory screening against 14 AIs. Both field strains
have exposure histories to multiple insecticides from different classes
over the past 5 yr. Vial bioassay results showed that boric acid and
abamectin killed the highest proportions of these populations fol-
lowed by dinotefuran, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and chlorfena-
pyr. Boric acid results were validated with gel bait feeding assays,
which also supported the potential for reduced efficacy of hydrame-
thylnon and imidacloprid gel baits. Conversely, both field strains
displayed moderate to high levels of resistance to indoxacarb, fipro-
nil, acetamiprid, and all pyrethroids tested (beta-cyfluthrin, bifen-
thrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin).
Susceptibility Profiles of Field-Collected Strains Versus
a Laboratory Susceptible Strain
Susceptibility profiles for the I-IN and D-IL strains were determined
to identify candidate insecticide AIs for use in resistance manage-
ment studies to be conducted at both housing sites. Vial bioassays

 were used to monitor physiological resistance to the AIs, which is
considered the most common category of resistance in cockroaches
(Scharf et al. 1998, Wang et al. 2004, Gondhalekar et al. 2013).
Insecticide resistance can progress to problem levels quickly once
physiological resistance is present at detectable levels (Ffrench-
Constant & Roush 1990), even for baits. This assay method also
can be executed quickly and with its combination of contact and in-
gestion exposure, it simulates cockroach exposure to insecticides in
the field (Gondhalekar et al. 2011). Similar results were obtained
when the JWax-S strain was exposed to indoxacarb using vial LC-
DC bioassay in other studies, which highlights the reproducibility of
results by using this method (Gondhalekar et al. 2011, 2013). LC99

 DCs were used for susceptibility assessment in the JWax-S, I-IN,
and D-IL strains in initial AI assays. Diagnostic concentration esti-
mates, however, were slightly different and relied upon LC90 DCs
for boric acid, hydramethylnon, and imidacloprid as tested in subse-
quent assays. Owing to the slower-acting nature of boric acid and
hydramethylnon, 96-h concentration–mortality data were used for
LC determinations with these AIs. Additionally, LC90s (as supported
by consultation of raw data) were used for DC assays with boric
acid and hydramethylnon because using LC99s would result in ex-
tremely high DCs which were not feasible for routine testing. In imi-
dacloprid DC determination assays, 100% mortality was not
achieved for either lab or field strains, apparently due to imidaclo-
prid’s activity as a weak partial agonists at the nicotinic acetylcho-
line receptor, low contact toxicity, and knock-down recovery
(Kaakeh et al. 1997, Tan et al. 2007); therefore, the 72 h LC90 value
was used in imidacloprid DC assays. Commercial baits containing
boric acid, hydramethylnon, and imidacloprid were also used in no-
choice feeding bioassays to test if similar results could be achieved
compared with vial bioassays (see below).
When exposed to abamectin the I-IN and D-IL field strains dis-
played high mortality. For decades, abamectin efficacy has been inves-
tigated, and it has been shown effective for German cockroach control
(Cochran 1985, Cochran 1990, Koehler et al. 1991, Ross 1993, Appel
and Benson 1995). Additionally, cockroach females exposed to aba-
mectin failed to reproduce (Cochran 1985, Koehler et al. 1991).
However, more recent studies also showed low levels of abamectin re-
sistance in field-collected cockroach strains (Wang et al. 2004).
Among the neonicotinoids tested, three were moderately active
against
the
field
strains
(dinotefuran,
clothianidin,
and
thiamethoxam), whereas acetamiprid was the least effective, and in the
case of imidacloprid 100% mortality was not achieved in any strain.
Similar results were obtained by Tan et al. (2007), who found that clo-
thianidin and dinotefuran killed 77 and 90% of German cockroaches
tested while imidacloprid and acetamiprid caused 0 and 20% mortal-
ity. Insecticidal activities of neonicotinoids were grouped previously
based on their relative maximum levels of acetylcholine (ACh)-medi-
ated current production (Tan et al. 2007). Imidacloprid only caused
20–25% of the maximum ACh current (Tan et al. 2007), which might
explain the recovery of German cockroaches after being exposed to
imidacloprid in the present study.
Chlorfenapyr acts via disruption of ATP production and loss of
energy, and thus has a different mode of action from neurotoxic in-
secticides (Raghavendra et al. 2011). Chlorfenapyr insecticidal ac-
tivity has been tested on German cockroaches (Ameen et al. 2000,
Sims and Appel 2007) and low levels of resistance (5.7-fold) have
previously been observed in a field-collected strain Gondhalekar
et al. 2011).
Indoxacarb and fipronil were initially shown as effective AIs for
controlling German cockroaches (Appel 2003, Wei et al. 2001); how-
ever, in the present study only low mortality was observed in both the
I-IN and D-IL strains when exposed to indoxacarb and fipronil. Our
findings are consistent with other studies showing significant in-
doxacarb (Gondhalekar et al. 2013, Ko et al. 2016a) and fipronil
(Holbrook et al. 2003, Chai and Lee 2010, Gondhalekar et al. 2011)
resistance in German cockroaches. Resistance to indoxacarb and
fipronil in the I-IN and D-IL strains are likely the result of prior selec-
tion pressure. These findings are consistent with application records at
the Indianapolis and Danville sites, and the higher-level market sales
of cockroach baits containing indoxacarb and fipronil than any other
bait in the United States for years preceding our study (Curl 2011).
When exposed to pyrethroids (i.e., beta-cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, and
lambda-cyhalothrin), both field strains showed uniform high resis-
tance. Reports of widespread pyrethroid resistance in German cock-
roaches and associated control failures are abundant (Valles and Yu
1996, Wei et al. 2001, Limoee et al. 2006, Chai and Lee 2010).
Cochran previously showed pyrethroid-resistant German cockroaches
could be selected within six generations by exposing a lab susceptible
strain to permethrin or fenvalerate (Cochran 1987). However, resis-
tance build-up was even faster in field strains already possessing low-
level pyrethroid resistance (Cochran 1987, Scharf et al. 1997, 1998).
Susceptibility Profiles of Cockroaches for Technical
Grade Boric Acid, Hydramethylnon, or Imidacloprid and
Associated Commercial Gel Baits
With respect to boric acid, similar results were obtained in both no-
choice feeding bioassays and vial bioassays. With no evidence of resis-
tance, inorganic compounds such as boric acid were used regularly as
a dust treatment for German cockroaches even before World War II
(Ebeling 1995). Boric acid has been tested in the lab and field for con-
trolling German cockroaches (Zurek et al. 2003, Gore and Schal
Fig. 2. Assessment of commercial boric acid, hydramethylnon, and imidacloprid gel bait efficacy when tested on susceptible and two field-collected German
cockroach strains (JWax-S, I-IN, and D-IL, respectively). In each day, asterisks indicate significantly different mortality among strains at P < 0.05 probability level
(one-way MANOVA: univariate results).

 2004, Gore et al. 2004), resulting in 90% population reductions
(Gore and Schal 2004).
On the other hand, for hydramethylnon, vial bioassay and no-
choice feeding bioassay results were different. When exposed to
technical grade hydramethylnon, no difference was observed in mor-
tality of the JWax-S and field strains. In the case of formulated
hydramethylnon gel bait, 100% mortality was achieved in JWax-S
in 72 h, but it took significantly longer to achieve complete mortality
for the field strains (Fig 2, Supp. Table 3 [online only]). This latter
result suggests the potential for reduced hydramethylnon efficacy in
the field against the I-IN and D-IL field strains. Ko et al. (2016a,
2016b) also recently reported evidence of hydramethylnon resis-
tance in German cockroaches for the first time, as well as cross-
resistance with indoxacarb. In the case of imidacloprid, similar results
were obtained in vial and no-choice feeding bioassays with gel bait.
For technical imidacloprid assays, mortality was not different be-
tween the lab and field strains, which is a similar result to that ob-
tained previously (Chai and Lee 2010). However, with technical
imidacloprid 100% mortality could not be achieved, suggesting the
potential for reduced imidacloprid efficacy. These results may also
suggest less suitability of vial bioassays for assessing imidacloprid tox-
icity, but DC vial assays effectively predicted the results of no-choice
bait feeding bioassays. Overall, commercial gel baits tested in this
study were toxic to susceptible and field strains of cockroaches and
100% mortality was eventually achieved (although taking longer
with hydramethylnon and boric acid; Fig. 2 and Supp. Table 3 [online
only]) probably owing to highly palatable bait matrices and higher
amounts of insecticides acquired through high bait consumption.
Summary and Conclusions
As already established through prior research, vial bioassays are an
easy and cost-effective technique for comparing susceptibility pro-
files of laboratory and field-collected cockroach strains. Although
the I-IN and D-IL strains displayed susceptibility to some AIs and
clear resistance to others, resistance can potentially be rapidly se-
lected in any population once resistance alleles for any AI are pre-
sent. For example, prior results showed only three generations of
selection with pyrethroid or organophosphate insecticides are re-
quired to significantly increase resistance levels in a lab–field hybrid
German cockroach strain (Scharf et al. 1998). Determining the ef-
fects of different insecticide deployment strategies on resistance evo-
lution, such as use of single products versus product rotations or
mixtures would provide useful information for developing sustain-
able resistance management strategies for German cockroaches.
Even though susceptibility and resistance of field cockroaches
against different AIs was observed in our study, effective control of
cockroaches might still be achievable by commercially available
chemicals because they are highly palatable and contain extremely
high insecticide concentrations (Holbrook et al. 2003, Gondhalekar
and Scharf 2012, Gondhalekar et al. 2013, Ko et al. 2016a).
However, this possibility does not preclude judicial pesticide use to
preserve
efficacy
of
presently
available
pesticide
resources
(Gondhalekar and Scharf 2013).
In conclusion, the three major outcomes of this work are as follows.
First is the determination of susceptibility profiles for cockroach field
populations collected from two public housing sites. Abamectin and
boric acid were two of the most effective insecticide AIs identified.
Among neonicotinoids, the AIs dinotefuran, clothianidin, and thiame-
thoxam were the most active against field strain cockroaches. The
highest resistance levels observed were for fipronil, indoxacarb, and all
pyrethroids tested. Second, another outcome of this work is the devel-
opment of DCs for a number of currently registered AIs for use against
cockroaches. These DCs should have wide utility for resistance moni-
toring purposes, both in support of pest management programs and re-
sistance management studies. Third, field studies already in progress
are testing the most-active AIs noted above by comparing their effec-
tiveness in different deployment schemes (single product, rotation, or
mixture) at the two housing sites. These field studies are expected to re-
veal the relative effects of the different deployment strategies on popu-
lation suppression, as well as resistance and cross-resistance evolution
in response to selection pressures.
