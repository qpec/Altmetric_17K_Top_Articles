Abstract
Background: The number of asylum seekers, refugees and internally displaced people worldwide has increased
dramatically over the past 5 years. Many countries are continuing to resort to detaining asylum seekers and other
migrants, despite concerns that this may be harmful. In light of the considerable body of recent research, this
review aims to update and expand on a 2009 systematic review on the mental health consequences of detention
on adult, adolescent and child immigration detainees, which found (on the basis on 9 studies) that there was
consistent evidence that immigration detention had adverse effects on mental health.
Methods: Three databases were searched using key terms relating to immigration detention and mental health.
Electronic searches were supplemented by reference screening. Studies were included if they were quantitative,
included individuals detained for immigration purposes, reported on mental health problems and were published
in peer-reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently screened papers for eligibility, and a further two reviewers
completed quality appraisals for included studies.
Results: Twenty- six studies (21 of which were not included in the 2009 review) reporting on a total of 2099
participants were included in the review. Overall, these studies indicated that adults, adolescents and children
experienced high levels of mental health problems. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were
most commonly reported both during and following detention. Higher symptom scores were found in detained
compared to non-detained refugees. In addition (and more clearly than was evident in 2009), detention duration
was positively associated with severity of mental symptoms. Greater trauma exposure prior to detention was also
associated with symptom severity.
Conclusions: The literature base reviewed in this paper consistently demonstrated severe mental health consequences
amongst detainees across a wide range of settings and jurisdictions. There is a pressing need for the proper consideration
of mental health and consequent risk of detention-related harm in decisions surrounding detention as well as for
improved care for individuals within detention facilities. Recommendations based on these findings are presented,
including increased focus on the identification of vulnerability and on minimising the duration of detention.
Keywords: Mental health, Vulnerability, Immigration detention, Asylum seekers, Refugees
Background
The number of people forcibly displaced worldwide as a
result of persecution, conflict, generalized violence or
human rights violations has increased dramatically in
the last 5 years. The UNHCR estimates that there are
currently
(July
2018)
68.5
million
forced
migrants
around the world [1].
Many countries detain asylum seekers in immigration
detention centres whilst their applications are processed
or following a decision to refuse them protection. At
present the total number of third-country nationals held
in immigration detention in the European Union is esti-
mated to be 158,792 [2]. In the UK alone, this figure is
32526 people, representing 20% of total EU detainees, des-
pite a much smaller percentage of asylum applications.
There is robust and consistent evidence that refugees
are more vulnerable to mental illness, particularly de-
pression
and
PTSD,
as
compared
to
the
general

 population [3, 4]. Recent evidence indicates that vulner-
ability to non-affective psychoses is also increased in ref-
ugees compared to other migrants, reflecting their
severe and often repeated exposure to adversity [5]. In
addition to pre-migration factors such as exposure to
torture or human trafficking, post-migration factors, in-
cluding prolonged asylum procedures, prohibition from
working, poverty and poor housing are significantly as-
sociated with poor mental health [6–9]. Research from
the
UK
also
indicates
that
post-migration
and
asylum-related stressors are associated with PTSD symp-
toms and emotional distress in asylum seekers and refu-
gees [10].
Time spent in immigration detention in the host coun-
try is a particular post-migration stressor that entails loss
of liberty and the threat of forced return to the country of
origin. For many asylum seekers with a history of major
trauma, it is reminiscent of contexts in their country of
origin where they had been deprived of their liberty and
human rights [11]. Immigration detention also exposes
asylum seekers to possible abuse from staff and violence
from fellow detainees, social isolation, and forceful re-
moval. In the UK, the Medical Justice charity has docu-
mented these problems in a series of reports [12].
The practice of detaining asylum seekers, a group with
a pre-existing vulnerability to mental health problems
due
to
higher
exposure
to
trauma
pre-
and
peri-migration, [4] risks further exacerbating their men-
tal health difficulties. The experience of detention may
act as a new stressor, which adds to the cumulative ef-
fect of exposure to trauma, leading to an increased likeli-
hood of developing mental health difficulties such as
PTSD as a result of the ‘building block effect’ [13]. In-
deed, a 2009 systematic review reporting on the effects
of immigration detention on mental health found de-
tainees to have high levels of anxiety, depression and
post-traumatic stress disorder [14]. Suicidal ideation and
deliberate self-harm were also common. Severity of dis-
tress was significantly greater in those who had been
detained for relatively long periods [14]. The studies
reviewed outlined the extent and severity of the mental
health problems observed in detained people. The au-
thors noted this research area was still in its infancy and
highlighted the urgent need for further research on both
the acute and longer-term impact of immigration deten-
tion on mental health, as well as its independence or
otherwise from other risk factors.
Since 2009, a number of new studies have been pub-
lished in the context of rising levels of forced migration
globally and the frequent use of immigration detention
to manage the increasing numbers of asylum seekers.
These findings have led to increasing concern that im-
migration detention may constitute a significant compo-
nent of the post-migration adversity experienced by
some asylum seekers. Such concerns over the treatment,
support and management of both children and adults
within
detention
facilities
have
been
continuously
expressed by numerous institutions across several coun-
tries, with many calling for legislative amendments to
end immigration detention, particularly of children [15–
17]. More recently, the UNHCR has also voiced concern
over the physical and psychological effects of possible
mandatory detention of all asylum seekers in Hungary
[18]. The European Commission have reviewed the (very
variable) use of alternatives to detention across the Euro-
pean Community. [19]
There has also been very extensive recent concern at
the potential adverse consequences and human rights
implications of the separation of migrant children from
their parents by the USA authorities [20]. This led to
this practice being discontinued [21].
In 2002, Australia was unique in its policy of indefin-
ite, non-reviewable, mandatory detention of asylum
seekers without valid entry documents arriving by boat.
Clinical observation raised initial concerns, followed by
the publication of research demonstrating the high
prevalence of mental disorder in detention [22, 23].
Whereas the Australian authorities have since made
changes to the law [24] that could be considered pro-
gress, the British government have sought to expand the
capacity of immigration detention centres [25].
Although concerns have been raised over the mental
health implications of immigration detention globally [26],
we have taken the UK as a more in-depth example due to
our familiarity with it and to the relatively large number of
people detained there, incongruent with the comparatively
small total number of asylum applications.
In 2015 a cross-party inquiry found that the UK de-
tains too many people and for too long, and is more
costly and less efficient than alternative systems operat-
ing in countries such as Australia and Sweden that have
introduced community-based programmes to monitor
asylum seekers and irregular migrants [27]. UK policy
developments, therefore, provide an indicative illustra-
tion of these developing concerns.
In 2013, the Royal College of Psychiatrists issued a
position statement on the detention of people with men-
tal disorders in Immigration Removal Centres, which
concluded that ‘detention centres are likely to precipitate
a significant deterioration of mental health in the major-
ity of cases, greatly increasing both the suffering of the
individual and the risk of suicide and self-harm’ and
therefore that ‘people with mental disorder should only
be subjected to immigration detention in very excep-
tional circumstances’ [28].
In 2016, a government-commissioned review on the
welfare of immigration detainees [29] highlighted the
‘evident ethical, policy and practical implications’ of
von Werthern et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2018) 18:382

 medical research showing that immigration detention it-
self can seriously damage the mental health of detainees.
A
narrative
review
included
within
the
report
highlighted the particular vulnerability of people with a
history of trauma and those with pre-existing mental or
physical health problems to the adverse mental health
effects of detention [30].
The UK Home Office published a Policy Guidance
document on adults at risk in immigration detention
[31]. which identified several ‘conditions or experiences
which will indicate that a person may be particularly vul-
nerable to harm in detention’. ‘Immigration factors’ en-
abled decisions to detain to be made and maintained
despite substantial vulnerability factors being present.
The Royal College of Psychiatrists issued a Position
Statement expressing concern that the definition of tor-
ture within the new Adults at Risk policy added ‘un-
necessary and inappropriate complexity that does not
assist in identifying those who are particularly vulnerable
to the adverse effects of detention’ [32]. In response to
legal challenge, The UK Home Office has since changed
this definition [33].
This review was conducted to provide a fuller and
more up-to-date synthesis of the evidence. Its specific
aims were to document (a) the prevalence and types of
mental health problems among child and adult immigra-
tion detainees and (b) risk factors associated with mental
health problems among immigration detainees. We
looked particularly for evidence about the possible ef-
fects of pre-existing trauma and/or mental health prob-
lems and of duration of detention. Since detention
systems vary between countries and nomenclature sur-
rounding detainees vary across studies, the review takes
a broad and inclusive stance and includes material on
people detained within an immigration context (span-
ning asylum seekers, refugees and other migrants).
Methods
A systematic literature review following a modified ver-
sion of the PRISMA guidelines [34] was conducted be-
tween
October
2015
and
May
2018
(PROSPERO
Registration No: CRD42017056444).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included if they (a) included male or female
adults or children detained for immigration purposes;
(b) reported the prevalence of mental health problems;
and (c) presented results of published peer-reviewed re-
search based on one or more of the following study de-
signs: cross-sectional survey; case–control study; cohort
study; case series analysis; experimental study with base-
line measures for the outcomes of interest; or secondary
analysis of organisational records (Table 1). No restrictions
were placed on country setting, country of origin of the
immigration detainees, or method of measuring mental
health outcomes. Since research in this area remains
scarce, studies were not excluded on the grounds of their
quality (though this is reported in Table 2). Qualitative
studies will be presented in a subsequent paper.
Studies that did not report specifically on people held
in immigration detention or removal centres (i.e. facil-
ities detaining foreign national citizens for administrative
purposes under immigration powers) were excluded.
Studies that did not examine the impact of detention on
mental health specifically were also excluded. Therefore
any studies examining multi-morbidity involving both
mental health disorders and physical disorders (e.g. in-
fectious diseases) were excluded, as were studies focused
on the attitudes and experiences of health professionals
working within immigration detention. Reviews, grey lit-
erature, commentaries, conference abstracts, letters, edi-
torials, books and short surveys were also excluded. We
have however referred to relevant grey literature in the
introduction and discussion sections.
Studies concerning child and adult detainees have
been presented separately for the sake of clarity.
Search strategy
Relevant
studies
were
identified
through
electronic
searches of Embase (1980 to 2018 week 22), Ovid MED-
LINE (1946 to May week 3 2018) and PsycINFO (1806
to May week 3 2018). Searches were limited to English
language only. No other restrictions were applied to the
searches. All search terms related to the following two
main areas: mental health and immigration detention.
The full electronic search strategy is presented in
Additional file 1.
Electronic searches were supplemented by screening
of reference lists of all included primary studies. In
addition, the following journals published between 2013
and 2018 were hand searched: Forced Migrant Review,
International Migration Review, International Migration,
Journal of Refugee Studies, Journal of Traumatic Stress,
Refuge, and Torture. Six International experts working
in the field of forced migration and health (i.e. psych-
iatry, psychology and criminology) were contacted to
nominate further papers eligible for inclusion. One re-
sponse was received.
Data extraction and quality appraisal
Three reviewers (CM, RS, ZC) were involved in the
process of independently screening titles and available
abstracts of identified articles. If it was unclear whether
a reference was relevant for the review, texts were re-
trieved in full. The same team of reviewers (CM, RS,
ZC) independently assessed full texts to verify eligibility
based on the above selection criteria. Disagreement was
resolved either by discussion or with assistance of a third

 reviewer (CK, KR or MW). Data from all included studies
was double extracted by a team of four reviewers (CM,
MW, RS, ZC) into a standardised electronic spreadsheet.
The following information was extracted from each study:
first author, year of publication, population sampled,
country where study was carried out, study design, mea-
sures used to assess mental health or psychological do-
mains
of
quality
of
life,
outcomes
and
length
of
immigration detention. The quality of studies which met
the inclusion criteria was appraised independently by two
from a team of three reviewers (CK, CM, MW) using a
modified version of the qualitative Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme Checklist [35].
Each item was rated as high (2), intermediate (1) or
low (0) quality, resulting in a maximum potential total
score of 26 (see Table 2 for breakdown of scores). Dis-
crepancies in scores between reviewers were resolved by
discussion.
Results
The study selection process is outlined in Fig. 1.
Twenty-six relevant studies reporting on a total of 2099
participants were included in the review. Of these, 16
studies reported on adults, 9 studies on children and
families and one reported on both. Studies were con-
ducted in Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Sweden,
Switzerland, the UK and the US. Not all studies listed in-
dividual countries of origin, yet as many as 58 countries
were represented within a single study [36]. Key charac-
teristics of all included studies can be found in Table 2.

 Adults
A total of 17 studies reported data on the mental health
consequences of immigration detention in adults. These
studies involved a total of 1168 participants (Note: this
number only includes studies in which primary data was
collected). Three studies on parental health are discussed
separately in the ‘Child and Families’ subsection below.
Six studies were conducted as comparison studies, with
a total of 331 non-detained controls. Ten studies were
conducted during detention, six were conducted follow-
ing detention, and one included both current and past
detainees. Reasons given for detention varied widely and
were not consistently reported. Many were asylum
seekers and some studies also included foreign national
prisoners or ex-prisoners awaiting deportation, illegal
workers and undocumented entrants. Participant ages
ranged from 15 to 80 years of age. Approximately two
thirds of all participants were male. One study focused
exclusively on females, who were illegal sex workers
detained in Israel and awaiting deportation [37]. Studies
differed widely in the participants’ duration of detention.
Some studies reported average duration in terms of the
mean, others reported median durations. For those
reporting mean durations, these ranged between 4 days
to 3.2 years. Reported median durations ranged between
6 to 8 months. Reported ranges fell between 2- to
4 months. Various pre-migratory traumatic events were
reported, including but not limited to torture. Where re-
ported, subjection to torture ranged from 12.2–100%.
Overall, 11 studies employed self-report measures, one
used self-report measures along with clinical assessment,
one used clinical assessments only and four analysed
health records. These studies are reviewed below in
terms of method of measuring mental health outcomes
(self-report and clinical assessments), use of a control
design, detention duration and release, and gender.

 consistently identify severe levels of mental health
problems amongst detainees. Most studies (N = 9) re-
ported
on
symptoms
of
anxiety,
depression
and
PTSD, which appear to be the most common forms
of mental health difficulties experienced by detainees
both during [36–39] and following detention (see
below; [40–43]. Whilst not differentiating between
types of traumatic experiences, greater trauma expos-
ure prior to detention was significantly associated
with higher rates of such symptoms [37, 38, 41].
Gaining temporary protection rather than permanent
protection was an independent contributor to the risk
of on-going depression and PTSD [43]. Isolation from
family members and living alone were also associated
with higher rates of such symptoms [41, 43].
Somatization, suicidal ideation, substance use, person-
ality disorder and neurodevelopment disorders were also
reported in some studies [37, 44, 45].
Three studies measured the quality of life of detainees
and uniformly reported low quality of life ratings,
particularly across psychological domains [40, 42, 46].
One of these studies found that levels of quality of
life were mediated by the level of perceived support
and satisfaction with the care received from detention
staff [46].
Clinical assessments
Two of the identified studies involved diagnostic clin-
ical assessments. Both of these were restricted to
male detainees. Graf and colleagues [47], using the
WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(CIDI),
found
a
76%
point
prevalence
of
mental
health disorders in detainees, with 26.2% meeting cri-
teria for serious mental illness within 4 days of ad-
mission. The most common disorders were found to
be affective disorders (36%), anxiety disorders (34%)
and PTSD (23%). Similar prevalence rates were found
in
a
study
by
Sen
et
al.
[45],
which
combined
self-report measures with clinical assessments. They
found the prevalence of any mental health, develop-
mental or personality disorder to be 74.3%, with over
half of the sample screened positive for more than
one disorder. Seventy-three percent of the sample re-
ported unmet psychological needs.
Secondary health data
Four studies analysed pre-existing health data obtained
from detention centres. Data recording was poor across
most studies, with authors facing flawed and unsystem-
atic documentation. One study drew on data obtained
from health records within detention centres [36]. Des-
pite the reported lack of available records spanning the
entire detention period of many detainees, the findings
suggest that mental health issues were identified in 6%
of detainees. The reason for being detained was also
found to contribute to new mental health problems, with
unauthorised boat arrivals displaying the highest rates of
psychiatric morbidity (27%). Asylum seekers had more
health problems including mental health problems than
other detainees. Only 7% of all recorded detention
centre interventions included formal mental state exami-
nations. A further study reported much higher numbers,
with approximately half the detainees suffering from
PTSD symptoms [48]. Two studies looked at rates of
suicide and/or self-harm using data extracted from inci-
dent reports within detention centres in Australia [49]
and the UK [50]. Self-harm was estimated to occur in
22% (including attempted hanging) and 12.8% respect-
ively. Where provided, precipitating factors to self-harm
revolved around detention conditions and procedural

 related factors (such as duration of claims) and negative
decisions [49]. Suicides in immigration detention were
estimated at 222 per 100,000 between 2002 and 2004,
with the majority of deaths being caused by hanging
[50]. Of the deaths in detainees reported in coroner’s re-
ports and Prisoner’s Ombudsman’s reports, the majority
had a history of mental health difficulties including de-
pression, psychosis and PTSD. Overall however, these
figures are likely to reflect only the most severe cases in
which the mental health difficulties were sufficiently
prominent to be identified and recorded by detention
staff. Moreover, they are likely to represent the perspec-
tive of detention staff rather than of asylum seekers
themselves.
Comparison studies
Six studies compared the self-reported levels of PTSD,
depression and anxiety of detainees to those in a com-
parison group of non-detained refugees or migrants
from a similar background. All six studies showed
higher symptom scores and rates of meeting clinical
threshold for mental health disorders in the detained
groups. This held true when comparing detained asy-
lum seekers with non-detained asylum seekers [38, 41]
detained asylum seekers and detained former prisoners
with non-detained asylum seekers [11], detained sex
workers
with
non-detained
sex
workers
[37]
and
detained
temporary
protection
visa
holders
with
non-detained permanent protection visa holders [39,
43, 51]. All but one study [11] found no significant dif-
ference in levels of pre-migration trauma exposure be-
tween
the
groups,
suggesting
that
detention
contributed independently to PTSD over and above the
impact of past traumatic experiences. However, whilst
the number of traumatic events may not have differed
across groups, the frequency, severity and context of
those events were often not assessed.
Whilst no direct comparison between detainees and
prison populations have been conducted to date, one study
compared findings obtained from one immigration removal
centre in the UK against results from prison-based studies
utilising the same screening tools [45]. Despite methodo-
logical shortcomings and difficulties in making direct com-
parisons, prevalence rates of depression and PTSD were
higher among immigration detainees than in prison popula-
tions. Levels of suicidal ideation were high in both groups.
Detention duration and release
Eight studies reported on the relationship between
length of detention or release from detention and
mental health and/or quality of life. Four studies con-
ducted in Australia and the USA found a significant
positive correlation between detention duration and
symptomatology
[36,
43,
44,
48],
suggesting
that
psychological functioning deteriorates with prolonged
detention. A UK study found an interaction effect be-
tween exposure to interpersonal trauma and length of
detention, suggesting that experience of interpersonal
trauma and prolonged time in detention resulted in
higher anxiety and depression scores [11] . The au-
thors suggest that the interaction they found may also
reflect
the
complex
relationship between
stage
of
claim and detention duration within the UK. How-
ever, even brief detention (median 17.5 days) has been
found to have negative mental health consequences
[38].
In contrast, two studies did not find a statistically
significant correlation between detention duration and
quality of life [42, 46], although a decreasing trend
was found in one of these studies [46]. Here, the
small sample size as well as the use of quality of life
scales rather than mental symptom measures may
have resulted in reduced sensitivity to the effects of
detention.
Furthermore,
one
of
the
two ‘negative’
studies indicated a
significant increase of
suicidal
ideation with detention duration [42].
One study employed a longitudinal design with a
two-month follow up, indicating not only that deten-
tion exacerbates psychological symptoms over time,
but also that these symptoms were markedly reduced
in those participants who had been released prior to
the follow-up rating [44]. However, another longitu-
dinal study suggests that symptomatology and social
isolation remained higher in former detainees follow-
ing release when compared to their non-detained
counterparts [39].
Three studies conducting single assessments follow-
ing release from detention suggest that symptoms of
depression, anxiety and PTSD endure beyond the de-
tention period, and persist at 10 months [41], 3 years
[43] or almost 4 years [40] after release. In the two lat-
ter studies, numerous anxiety-related symptoms, such
as avoidance of related triggers, nightmares and flash-
backs were linked directly to the detention experience.
The severity of such long-term impacts, along with
continuing sadness, hopelessness, and anger were again
found to correlate with detention duration [43].
Despite this, an improvement in quality of life fol-
lowing release was found when asking former de-
tainees to give retrospective ratings of their quality of
life during detention and current ratings following re-
lease from detention [42]. After release, participants
exhibited more satisfaction, improved mood and a de-
cline in suicidal ideation.
Gender
To date, an overwhelming proportion of research fo-
cuses on males in detention. In those studies in which
von Werthern et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2018) 18:382 
Page 11 of 19
 female detainees were also included, analysis by gender
was usually not conducted. In one study, females were
deliberately excluded from the sample due to differing
experiences in comparison to men [41].
Only two studies specifically examined gender differ-
ences, with one finding no significant differences be-
tween genders [38] and the other reporting higher rates
of trauma/PTSD in females [48]. Female detainees were
also found to be more vulnerable to the effects of more
prolonged detention when compared to males.
One study concentrated exclusively on female sex
workers in detention, finding high rates of substance
abuse,
depression,
somatic
symptoms
and
PTSD
amongst the women [37]. However, this sample of Rus-
sian sex workers in Israel differs substantially from other
groups of detainees, complicating the generalizability
and comparability of these findings. The mental health
consequences of detention for female detainees specific-
ally therefore remain unknown based on the studies
reviewed.
Children and families
Ten studies reported data on the mental health of chil-
dren and/or families within the context of detention.
This review reports on 629 children and young people
(across 9 studies) and 302 parents (across 5 studies).

 Two studies were conducted as comparison studies, with
a total of 96 controls. Seven studies were conducted
while participants were held in detention, and three were
conducted following detention. Again, detention dur-
ation was differentially reported. Where reported, the
means fell between 6 months and 2 years and 4 months
and the ranges spanned from 11 days to 2 years and
8 months across studies. The ages of children spanned
from childhood to adolescence, ranging from 11 months
– 19 years. Both male and female children were repre-
sented, yet gender distributions were largely unreported.
Overall, 5 studies used either self-report or parent/
teacher report measures Two studies combined clinical
assessment with self-report measures to evaluate psychi-
atric vulnerability [23, 52]. This allowed not only for an
estimation of prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders,
but also for retrospective accounts of mental health diffi-
culties preceding detention. One study reported clinical
outcomes of referrals into Child and Adolescent Mental
Health Services (CAMHS) from a detention centre [53].
Two further studies reported on data collected as part of an
Australian Human Rights Commission Data Set [48, 54].
A wide range of psychological disturbances mirroring
and extending those of adults was found across all three
studies which also all included clinical assessments (see
Table 4). All children evidenced at least one psychiatric
disorder, most frequently depression, anxiety, PTSD and
somatization, depending on the diagnostic categories
used. The overwhelming majority also struggled with
sleeping (65–100%) and eating problems (100%), suicidal
ideation (50%), and self-harm (25–80%). Drawing on
data from telephone-administered psychiatric interviews
and self-report measures from a near-complete sample
of detained families of unspecified ethnicity, Steel et al.
[23] found psychiatric disorders to be ten times more
likely to occur subsequent to detention when compared
to prior to detention. Although based on retrospective
reports, such difficulties appeared to be specifically
linked to detention experiences. Combining clinical as-
sessments with parent-report and, where possible, triangu-
lating these with self-report measures of mental health in
a small sample of child and adolescent detainees, Lorek et
al. [52] further identified age-related differences in mental
health difficulties. Specifically, whilst elevated levels of
emotional
and
behavioural
problems
and
somatic
complaints were common across all age groups, de-
velopmental delay and regression were more apparent
in younger detainees (aged 3–6). These included fre-
quent crying and withdrawal (100%), disturbed sleep
routines (100%), language delays (50%,), loss of previ-
ously acquired cognitive skills (33%) return to nappies
(38%), enuresis (13%) and encopresis (13%). Amongst
older children (aged 7–11), self-report questionnaires
suggested high levels of depression (100% not within
normal range, 50% above the cut off for clinical de-
pression), anxiety (66% above cut off for clinical anx-
iety) and PTSD symptomatology (17% approaching
clinical cut off) [52]. Though this study did not have
a control group, the reported lack of pre-existing
mental health problems again suggests that sudden
mental health deterioration may be attributable to de-
tention experiences.
Similar developmental differences in psychiatric mor-
bidity were also found in the study of CAMHS assess-
ments of 10 detained families [53]. Developmental
concerns such as language regression (50%), attachment
problems (30%) and enuresis (30%) were reported in
children under 5 years of age, whereas symptoms of
PTSD (100% above clinical cut off), depression with sui-
cidal ideation (100% above clinical cut-off), self-harm
(80%) anxiety (70%), and somatic symptoms (50%) were
more common in older children (aged 6–17).
Regressive behaviours such as enuresis (45% boys, 48%
girls) and encopresis (8% boys, 11% girls) were also
self-reported by a group of adolescents referred into an
infirmary during their time in detention in one study,
alongside the more common symptoms of severe to very
severe PTSD (very severe 94% boys, 96% girls; severe 6%
boys, 4% girls; Rothe et al., 2002a). Following release
from detention, 57% of adolescents within the same de-
tention facility were considered to continue to meet a
diagnosis of PTSD [56].
A secondary analysis of an Australian Human Rights
Commission data set indicated very high rates of severe
psychological distress amongst adolescents, evidenced by
severe disorders for 85.7% of adolescents [54]. All met
criteria for mixed anxiety and depression. Additionally,
parent reports suggested a high probability of psychiatric
disorder in 75% of their children, and significant emo-
tional symptoms int 78.6%. Drawing on a different sub-
set of the collected data, it was estimated that a third of
detained children had sufficient clinical symptoms to ne-
cessitate tertiary outpatient assessments [48].
Comparison studies
Two studies compared the mental health of children
within the detention context against those outside it;
both found elevated psychological symptoms within the
detained groups [57, 58]. When comparing children of
detained or deported parents with peers whose parents
were either legal permanent residents or undocumented
yet without prior contact with immigration enforcement,
parent reports indicated higher levels of PTSD symp-
toms and trauma in children of detained or deported
parents than the other two groups [57]. Parents and cli-
nicians also rated detained children as scoring more
highly on internalising problems and negative moods.
However, the grouping of detention with deportation in
von Werthern et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2018) 18:382 
Page 13 of 19
 this study makes it difficult to tease out the specific
effects of the experience of detention as against those
of removal or deportation. The authors concluded
that forced separation from parents due to immigra-
tion enforcement may be particularly adverse to child
mental health.
Similarly, a study comparing detained children to child
asylum seekers in the community found detained chil-
dren to have significantly impaired social-emotional
wellbeing as measured by conduct disorder, emotional
problems and hyperactivity than their non-detained
counterparts [58]. Interestingly, detained children scored
higher on peer relations and pro-social subscales, which
may be essential skills for children living in challenging
circumstances to have, particularly if their parents are
unable to adequately meet their needs.
Parental mental health
Parents displayed high rates of psychopathology across
the three studies (see Table 3). There was a substantial
increase in reported suicidal ideation. Further, whilst in
one study all parents reported the ability to care ad-
equately for and support their children prior to deten-
tion, only one of 14 parents remained able to do so
during detention [23].
One study reported on the effects of actual or threat-
ened detention and deportation on family units using
self-report measures [59]. Multiple regression analysis
revealed that parents’ legal vulnerability has an impact
on the family environment including the quality of the
parent-child relationship (27.1% of variance), as well as
on overall child well-being (30.6% of variance). In other
words, the greater the parents’ legal vulnerability, the
greater the reported consequences of detention and de-
portation. However, the interchangeable use of the terms
‘detention’ and ‘deportation’ again make it difficult to
discern the specific effect of detention.
In keeping with reports on children and adolescents,
the secondary analyses revealed 83% of parents to have
severe disorders [54]. Again, all participants met criteria
for mixed anxiety and depression. When asked about
concerns surrounding their child’s emotional wellbeing,
mental health and development, 67% identified concerns
around emotional and mental health (e.g. nightmares,
worry, sadness) and 23% identified concerns around de-
velopment (e.g. poor eating and low weight).
Detention duration and release
Four studies investigated the relationship between deten-
tion duration and mental health difficulties. One study
found that at 12-month follow up, the mental health of
families who remained in detention further deteriorated
during incarceration [53]. The three remaining studies
did not find a significant correlation between length of
detention and mental health problems [54, 56, 58]. How-
ever, the authors concluded that this might be due to
small sample sizes, the lack of available data on deten-
tion duration as well as the possibility of a ceiling effect
demonstrating extensive mental health difficulties.
Discussion
Key findings of this review
Adverse mental health consequences of immigration de-
tention are consistently recognised across the literature.
Such findings prevail even in countries where detention
standards are regarded as relatively benign [46, 52].
Much of the clinical literature reports high levels of anx-
iety, depression and PTSD and poor quality of life.
Whilst such mental health difficulties cannot be viewed
in isolation from past histories and pre-detention trau-
mas, which are not consistently measured across studies,
controlled studies with non-detained controls uniformly
suggest greater symptoms and ‘caseness’ (i.e. meeting
diagnostic criteria for a specific mental health condition)
in detained samples. This indicates that detention plays
an independent role in contributing to poor mental
health outcomes amongst asylum seekers. Nonetheless,
being an asylum seeker or having greater trauma expos-
ure of any kind (whether torture or other exposure)
prior to detention seems to be associated with higher
rates of anxiety, depression and PTSD in the context of
such detention (e.g. [41]). Similarly, greater isolation from
families and living alone has been found to increase such
symptoms in immigration detainees (e.g. [43]).
All adult studies examining the association between
detention duration and mental health severity (N = 5)
demonstrate a significant relationship between detention
duration and mental health deterioration. No such cor-
relation was found for length of detention and quality of
life (N = 2), although a negative trend was found in one
of these studies [46]. Additionally, perceived support
from detention staff was found to impact positively on
quality of life, highlighting the importance of staff behav-
iour on the wellbeing of detainees but not necessarily
having any effect on their mental health problems.
Symptom severity has been found to decrease and qual-
ity of life to increase following release, but mental health
difficulties persist well beyond release. Despite the
prominence of mental health disorders amongst de-
tainees, significant barriers to the identification and
treatment of those needs remain [47].
The
comparatively
smaller
body
of
research
on
detained children and families (N = 10 and a total of 629
children studied) echoes the findings in adults sum-
marised above. It should be noted however that the de-
tention of children is fairly uncommon across several
countries including the UK, yet remains relatively widely
practiced in some European countries [60] and, as
von Werthern et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2018) 18:382 
Page 14 of 19
 recently widely publicised, in the USA. Across those set-
tings and jurisdictions where it remains permitted, pro-
found and far-reaching mental health difficulties are
found amongst detained children and young people.
Only one in four studies found the severity of mental
health difficulties to increase with time the children
spent in detention [53]. The other three studies found
no correlation between detention duration and mental
health. While this has not been researched, this may be
explained by the possibility that even small durations of
detention are traumatic and harmful to children. The
nature of the mental health difficulties found differs
across age groups; whereas younger children display de-
velopmental regression and primarily externalising be-
haviours, symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD
are prominent in older children. Psychosomatic symp-
toms or somatization appear to be common across de-
velopmental stages. This may reflect the difference in
experiencing and communicating psychological difficul-
ties in children and young people [61, 62], but may also
be understood as a reflection of the somatic component
within the symptom pattern of complex PTSD [63].
Whilst detention itself may compromise child develop-
ment and psychosocial health, as well as aggravating
existing trauma, it may also lead to a breakdown of fam-
ily units. The detention environment may therefore
undermine adequate parenting abilities and leave parents
feeling disempowered, as they struggle with their own
mental health difficulties. Taken together, this may pre-
vent parents from being able to provide support neces-
sary for healthy child development, leaving children at
risk of adverse mental health outcomes [64]. It remains
unclear however, whether detaining children together
with their parents or forcibly separating children from
their families is more harmful to the children’s mental
health. Further, it is currently unknown how rates of
parental mental health difficulties compare to those of
single adults and those whose families are not detained.
Finally, there is a dearth of quantitative research on the
mental
health
of
unaccompanied
minors
who
are
detained. With the current number of unaccompanied
minors rising across the globe, research into the effects
of immigration detention on this subgroup of children is
of high importance, particularly with view to the possi-
bility that some unaccompanied minors may be inappro-
priately treated as though they were adults, consequently
increasing their risk of exploitation and harm [65].
Overall, the findings suggest that detention exacerbates
the mental health burden of asylum seekers and refugees
and that such detention should be viewed as a traumatic
experience in and of itself. This may be particularly true
for those detainees who are particularly vulnerable prior
to detention. Individuals with pre-existing mental health
difficulties may also be less effective self-advocates and
therefore more likely to be detained [11], despite recom-
mendations and policies to the contrary [31].
Key strengths and limitations of this review
A comprehensive search strategy, as well as independent
screening, data extraction and quality appraisals were
applied to ensure a systematic approach to synthesising
the literature on the mental health consequences of im-
migration detention. Adherence to the PRISMA guide-
lines further increased the methodological rigour and
clarity of the review. We sought to ensure that all re-
search that met out criteria was identified through add-
itional contact with expert researchers in the field.
Finally, the exclusion of grey literature, as well as confin-
ing the search to papers written in English, inevitably re-
sulted in the exclusion of some papers which may have
limited the overall understanding of detainee mental
health.
What this review adds to existing reviews
To the best of our knowledge, the current review is the
first systematic review on the mental health of immigra-
tion detainees since our previous review published in
2009 [14]. Although excluding grey literature, it includes
a larger number of clinical studies than previous reviews
[30] and is not limited to detainees with a recorded his-
tory of torture [66]. The current review supports find-
ings from the 2009 review and additionally highlights
the importance of considering the impact of immigration
detention on the mental health of families. It also in-
cludes multiple comparison studies which highlight the
independent effect of such detention on mental health
over and above that of uncertain immigration status.
However, it also highlights the dearth (and consequent
future importance) of further high quality research dir-
ectly investigating vulnerability within the immigration
detention context.
Key limitations of the available evidence and their
implications for future research
Numerous methodological problems exist at primary
study level, which may restrict the conclusions that can
be drawn in this review but also indicate where further
research is needed. The evidence to date remains sparse
due to the multiple obstacles hindering such research.
These include restricted access opportunities into deten-
tion facilities as well as the prohibiting of random sam-
pling (e.g. [38, 44]). This may have led to an increased
reliance on qualitative rather than quantitative methods,
particularly in the study of detained children. Such stud-
ies have not been included in this review. With regards
to studies conducted within detention centres, partici-
pants are often recruited through community areas within
the detention centres (e.g. [11]), possibly introducing a
von Werthern et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2018) 18:382 
Page 15 of 19
 bias towards those detainees who are most healthy. Re-
cruitment of participants in studies conducted following
release from detention, often occurs through lawyers,
community organisations or other support services (e.g.
[41]). Most studies did not describe the detention regime
in sufficient detail to allow for this to be considered as a
potential influencing factor. This, together with clearer
differentiation between the traumatic effects of detention
itself from those of the detention environment) is an im-
portant focus for future research. It also carries the impli-
cation that future studies should provide as much
information as possible about the detention environment
in order to facilitate judgment as to the generalisability of
the findings. Participation rates are often unknown. It is
therefore possible that the recruited samples differed sys-
tematically from detainees who did not access community
facilities or come into contact with support services. Sam-
ples may therefore represent only the most vulnerable in-
dividuals in need of support, or conversely, the most
highly functioning who are able to access appropriate ser-
vices. Further research in more representative populations
is needed to allow more confident generalisation of the
findings to the detainee population as a whole. Addition-
ally, the probability of being detained depends to some ex-
tent to sex and nationality, resulting in predominantly
male populations of certain national origins [38]. Whilst a
broad range of nationalities is represented across studies,
a paucity of research focusing on women is evident. Dif-
fering nationalities contribute to the vast heterogeneity of
samples, along with varying past experiences and trau-
matic histories, migration statuses, and detention systems
and immigration policies within host countries. Corres-
pondingly, language may be an important complicating
factor, acting both as a prominent exclusion criterion or a
possible cause of misinterpretation or inability to express
mental health difficulties clearly [47]. Communicating
mental health problems may additionally be compounded
by differing expressions of distress and trauma, alongside
differing attitudes and experiences of mental health within
countries of origin [67]. However, participants from a wide
range of cultural backgrounds seem to endure similar psy-
chological ill-health when subjected to detention.
Multiple designs as well as a diversity of methodology
and instruments used are evident across studies. Whilst
these may differentially contribute to the overall under-
standing of mental health problems amongst detainees,
they also limit comparability. The majority of research is
conducted as cross-sectional studies, which warrant cau-
tion in the drawing of casual inferences. The suggested
causal link between detention and worsening of mental
health is however consistent with a limited number of lon-
gitudinal studies and comparison studies, implying that
detention not only exacerbates existing mental health dis-
orders, but also contributes independently to the onset of
new ones. Nonetheless, isolating the effects of detention
alone remains a complex task and additional longitudinal
research is needed in order to establish the mental health
trajectories of detainees, from the very early days of being
arrested and detained. This may also include investigating
the adverse effects of being detained multiple separate
times at different lengths, as well as the effects that experi-
ences in detention may have on people’s ability to navigate
and integrate into new societies. Finally, the frequent reli-
ance on a range of self-report questionnaires, which have
often not been validated specifically for the use with de-
tainee populations, may be problematic though it is in our
view unlikely that this significantly affects the overall val-
idity of the findings. Moreover, measures often focus solely
on symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety, which
may fail to investigate other disorders such as schizophre-
nia and other non-affective disorders as may be the case
in refugees as a whole [5]. Whilst self-report question-
naires are undoubtedly useful for the purpose of screening
for mental health problems, outcomes of such self-report
measures should not be equated with formal psychiatric
diagnoses, which require clinician-administered inter-
views. To date, there is a limited use of diagnostic clinical
assessments to complement self-report measures, and
where these are conducted, the samples are restricted to
adult male detainees only.
Conclusions and practical recommendations
Taken as a whole, the body of research reviewed in this
paper consistently illustrates severe mental health conse-
quences amongst detainees across a wide range of set-
tings and jurisdictions. In view of this, in terms of
provision of care, consideration of mental health disor-
ders and their sequelae should become routine in mak-
ing the decision whether or not to detain, and in
monitoring the welfare of those already in detention.
Comprehensive sociocultural assessments should be car-
ried out by care providers with transcultural knowledge,
skills and practices [68]. These assessments should lead
to adequate treatment for individuals in detention who
suffer from mental health difficulties. Additionally, there
is a need to identify and address vulnerability within an
overall asylum policy and more specifically a detention
policy that avoids or minimises further harm being done
to vulnerable people. For this, it is important to take into
account multiple varying expressions of distress and vul-
nerability, which should not be reduced to Western con-
ceptualisations. Moreover, a broad concept of past
trauma is needed which is not restricted to the definition
of torture according to Article 1 of the Convention
Against Torture [69], but rather focuses on the severity
of harm to which the individual has been subjected [70].
Further, there should be a greater focus on minimizing
length of detention. Our findings add weight to the call
von Werthern et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2018) 18:382 
Page 16 of 19
 in the UK and other countries to introduce a statutory
limit of duration of detention, such as exists in all other
EU countries [71]. The increasing evidence for the nega-
tive impact of immigration detention on vulnerable pop-
ulations is particularly policy-relevant. Similarly, there is
insufficient attention paid to child protection and safety,
or to adequate education and health protection in coun-
tries where children continue to be detained, despite the
recognised vulnerability and risk of children and young
people and their protection under the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child [72].
