Multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a top threat to pub-
lic health. In November 2015, UCLA Health introduced a rapid 
gyrase A (gyrA) genotypic assay for prediction of Neisseria gon-
orrhoeae susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. We found a significant 
reduction in ceftriaxone use with a concomitant increase in tar-
geted therapy.
Keywords. gyrA; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; ciprofloxacin; 
antibiotic resistance. 
Over the past decades, Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed 
resistance to all antibiotics used for treatment [1]. The pro-
pensity for developing antimicrobial resistance is promoted 
by the misuse of antibiotics, which is hastened by the lack 
of timely methods for susceptibility testing to guide antibi-
otic selection [1, 2]. Recently, the identification and spread of 
multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae has caused great concern 
[2] and was declared one of the top 3 urgent threats to public 
health [3].
In response to that threat, we developed a molecular assay 
for the prediction of N. gonorrhoeae ciprofloxacin suscep-
tibility based on the detection of mutation at codon Ser91 of 
the Neisseria gonorrhoeae gyrase A (gyrA) gene directly from 
N. gonorrhoeae–positive specimens; the results of the assay 
were 100% concordant with traditional phenotypic agar dilu-
tion methods for detecting ciprofloxacin susceptibility [4]. 
A recent summary of the literature demonstrated that 11 other 
studies using the genotypic gyrA assay found similar concord-
ance with susceptibility results [5]. Because approximately 80% 
of N. gonorrhoeae infections in the United States are susceptible 
to ciprofloxacin [6], targeted use of ciprofloxacin therapy for 
the treatment of susceptible N. gonorrhoeae may be an effective 
strategy [7].
We adapted the assay for performance in a clinical labo-
ratory using remnant N. gonorrhoeae nucleic acids extracted 
by a commonly used commercial nucleic acid amplification 
assay for routine clinical testing, thereby allowing same-
day reflex testing of the gyrA genotype for all N. gonor-
rhoeae–positive specimens [8]. The assay performance was 
verified in accordance with Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA) requirements for use on urine, gen-
ital swab, rectal swab, and liquid cytology specimens. The 
method was launched as a laboratory-developed test for 
routine clinical use in November 2015 at the UCLA Health 
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory (University of California, 
Los Angeles (UCLA)).
METHODS
UCLA Health is comprised of 2 hospitals, 2 emergency depart-
ments, and >150 primary care clinics serving approximately 500 
000 patient-visits each year. At UCLA, cases of N. gonorrhoeae 
are detected by the Cobas 4800 CT/NG assay (Roche Molecular 
Systems, Pleasanton, California). Beginning in November 2015, 
all N. gonorrhoeae–positive specimens were reflexed to the 
real-time polymerase chain reaction gyrA genotypic suscepti-
bility assay, coupled with high-resolution melt analysis using 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes that target the 
gyrA gene. Specimens from all anatomic sites were treated the 
same. Subsequent laboratory reports of positive gonorrhea tests 
included genotype results and treatment recommendations of 
ciprofloxacin 500 mg once for wild-type strains [9]. Prior to the 
launch of the assay, physician education was provided describ-
ing the genotyping method and treatment recommendations. 
Beginning in May 2016, for all positive cases, providers were 
contacted electronically with reminders of the genotype results 
and recommended therapy.
We reviewed de-identified patient records of all N. gonor-
rhoeae infections between 1 January 2015 and 29 July 2016 
at UCLA Health. Data on gender, anatomic site of infection, 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, time to 
treatment, gyrA genotype, and treatment selection were col-
lected. Cases were defined as a diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae 
infection on a single date; 1 case may have multiple anatomic 
site-specific infections. Empiric treatment was defined as treat-
ment within 1 day of diagnosis. Wild-type strains were defined 
as the most prevalent gene sequence. The most prevalent gene 
sequence is nonmutated and predicts full susceptibility to 
ciprofloxacin.

 BRIEF REPORT • CID 2017:64 (1 May) • 1269
The primary outcomes of interest were time in days from 
specimen collection to therapy (defined as prescription of 
at least 1 antibiotic with activity against N. gonorrhoeae) and 
the use of ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin in the therapeutic regi-
men. Our primary explanatory variable was the period before 
(January 2015–November 2015) and after (November 2015–
July 2016) assay implementation. We compared each outcome 
between the 2 periods using Student t test, χ2 test, or Fisher 
exact test. Analyses were performed using Stata software ver-
sion 12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). The University of 
California Institutional Review Board determined that the 
review of de-identified patient data was not human subjects 
research.
RESULTS
Among 251 patients during the study period, there were 283 
cases and 314 N. gonorrhoeae infections. Of the 130 patients 
prior to assay implementation, 108 (83.1%) were men compared 
with 134 of 153 (87.6%) patients after assay implementation 
(P = .28). The proportion of patients with HIV infection was 
34.6% (n = 45) before assay implementation vs 32.7% (n = 50) 
after assay implementation (P = .73). Of all N. gonorrhoeae cases 
during the study period, 113 (39.9%) were treated the same day 
as specimen collection: 58 of 130 (44.6%) cases before assay 
implementation compared with 55 of 153 (35.9%) cases after 
assay implementation (P = .14). The mean time to treatment 
among nonempirically treated cases before assay implementa-
tion (n = 78) was 5.5 days (SD, 5.5 days), similar to the mean 
duration of 4.7 days (SD, 3.5 days) after assay implementation 
(n = 114) (0.8-day difference, P = .87).
Among cases of nonempirically treated N. gonorrhoeae, 
68 of 72 (94.4%) were treated with ceftriaxone before assay 
introduction compared with 77 of 98 (78.6%) after assay 
introduction (P = .004). Among 35 cases with wild-type gyrA 
genotype N. gonorrhoeae infection treated at least 2 days after 
specimen collection, the use of ciprofloxacin increased from 
3 of 24 (12.5%) cases in the first 7 months of assay imple-
mentation to 9 of 11 (81.8%) cases in the final 2 months after 
electronic reminder notifications began (P < .001), compared 
with no ciprofloxacin use among non-empirically treated 
cases prior to assay implementation (P < .001) (Figure 1).
Of 176 infections detected between November 2015 and 
July 2016, 121 (68.8%) were successfully genotyped. Of those, 
72 (59.5%) were wild-type gyrA and 49 (40.5%) were mutant. 
Among the remaining 55 infections, 49 could not be genotyped 
(6 were not attempted). Of the 62 pharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae 
infections, 40 (64.5%) could not be genotyped, in comparison 
to 9 of 114 (7.9%) samples from other anatomic locations (4 
urine, 3 rectal, 2 vaginal/cervical) (P < .001). The proportion 
of gyrA mutant N. gonorrhoeae infection (N=49) did not vary 
significantly by anatomic site (pharyngeal 33%, rectal 45.7%, 
vaginal/cervical 57.1%, urine 38.6%; P = .67).
DISCUSSION
Within a large health system, we successfully implemented rou-
tine gyrA genotype testing on N. gonorrhoeae–positive clinical 
specimens. We found an increase in ciprofloxacin treatment 
among patients with wild-type gyrA infections, and a concom-
itant reduction in ceftriaxone treatment. Additionally, elec-
tronic reminder notifications of genotype results to providers 
significantly augmented treatment with ciprofloxacin among 
wild-type gyrA infections. The proportion of those with HIV 
infection, male gender, and who received empiric treatment did 
not significantly differ before or after the implementation of 
the molecular assay. For nonempirically treated cases, time to 
treatment was not significantly different before and after assay 
implementation, and was of sufficient duration to allow for the 
performance of the assay and timely communication of test 
results to providers.
Our findings are important because (1) the evolution of 
drug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae is ongoing and interventions to 
mitigate this continued emergence are urgently needed [1, 2], and 
(2) there are only a few new antimicrobials for N. gonorrhoeae 
infections in development [5]. Reintroduction of antibiotics pre-
viously thought to be ineffective is a novel approach that may 
reduce the continued emergence of resistance [7], made possible 
by rapid molecular methods for targeted therapy. Targeted ther-
apy with oral agents enables use of simple, less costly medica-
tions, facilitating partner treatment, and can provide options for 
persons intolerant to recommended empiric therapy.
We also found that successful genotyping was dependent on 
the anatomic site of infection, with pharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae

2015 – 31 October 2015), during which time there were no genotype results avail-
able. Period 2 is the initial seven months of assay implementation prior to sending 
electronic reminders of genotype results to providers (1 November 2015 – 26 May 
2016). Period 3 is the final two months of assay implementation after electronic 
reminder notifications began (27 May 2016– 29 July 2016). *Electronic reminders 
began 27 May 2016

infections being significantly less likely to be genotyped com-
pared with other anatomic sites. Reduced sensitivity for phar-
yngeal N. gonorrhoeae genotyping has been noted previously; 
however, the cause is uncertain [8]. Improving the performance 
of the assay for pharyngeal infections is a priority because 
prior studies have shown a higher prevalence of drug-resistant 
N. gonorrhoeae among pharyngeal specimens [10], thought to 
be the result of transformation of resistance elements between 
commensal Neisseria species [10].
Finally, we found that the use of electronic reminder noti-
fications for providers regarding genotype results significantly 
augmented appropriate treatment selection. Such notification 
may help assure that assay implementation is associated with 
changes in prescribing behavior. A prior study has shown simi-
lar benefits of introducing electronic notifications in implemen-
tation of antibiotic stewardship interventions [11].
Our study had several limitations. Primarily, this was a sin-
gle-center study in a well-resourced health system. Implementation 
of the assay into other health systems is necessary to demonstrate 
reproducibility of our results. Additionally, in our study we did 
not measure clinical outcomes; however, ciprofloxacin has been 
shown to be >99% effective for the treatment of phenotypically 
susceptible N. gonorrhoeae infections [12]. A clinical trial to evalu-
ate outcomes among patients with wild-type gyrA N. gonorrhoeae 
infections treated with ciprofloxacin is underway at UCLA [13]. 
Furthermore, the study populations were not randomly assigned 
and therefore causality cannot be determined. Finally, as the 
molecular assay was a laboratory-developed test, smaller health 
systems may not have the capabilities to develop and implement 
the assay within the guidelines of CLIA.
CONCLUSIONS
The implementation of a rapid N. gonorrhoeae genotype assay in a 
large health system reduced the empiric use of ceftriaxone. Such a 
reduction in ceftriaxone use could slow the emergence of antibiot-
ic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, one of the top 3 urgent threats to pub-
lic health. Use of ciprofloxacin in wild-type strains was augmented 
by electronic notification of providers regarding genotype results. 
Successful genotyping, however, may depend on the anatomic site 
of infection. Strong consideration should be made to the introduc-
tion and evaluation of the assay in other clinical settings.
