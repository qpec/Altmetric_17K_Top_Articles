PURPOSE. To determine if corneal subbasal nerve plexus (SBP) parameters derived from wide-
area depth-corrected mosaic images are associated with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS. One hundred sixty-three mosaics were produced from eyes of 82 subjects by laser-
scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Subjects were of the same age, without (43
subjects) or with type 2 diabetes (39 subjects). Mosaic corneal nerve fiber length density
(mCNFL) and apical whorl corneal nerve fiber length density (wCNFL) were quantified and
related to the presence and duration of diabetes (short duration < 10 years and long duration
‡ 10 years).
RESULTS. In mosaics with a mean size of 6 mm2 in subjects aged 69.1 6 1.2 years, mCNFL in
type 2 diabetes was reduced relative to nondiabetic subjects (13.1 6 4.2 vs. 15.0 6 3.2 mm/
mm2, P ¼ 0.018). Also reduced relative to nondiabetic subjects was mCNFL in both short-
duration (14.0 6 4.0 mm/mm2, 3.2 6 3.9 years since diagnosis) and long-duration diabetes
(12.7 6 4.2 mm/mm2, 15.4 6 4.2 years since diagnosis; ANOVA P ¼ 0.023). Lower mCNFL
was associated with presence of diabetes (P ¼ 0.032) and increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
levels (P ¼ 0.047). By contrast, wCNFL was unaffected by diabetes or HbA1c (P > 0.05).
Global SBP patterns revealed marked degeneration of secondary nerve fiber branches outside
the whorl region in long-duration diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS. Wide-area mosaic images provide reference values for mCNFL and wCNFL and
reveal a progressive degeneration of the SBP with increasing duration of type 2 diabetes.

R
ecognition of the fact that the nerve fibers of the corneal
subbasal nerve plexus (SBP) are axons of the peripheral
nervous system has led to an increased effort in imaging,
quantifying, and relating corneal nerves to the status of
individuals with diabetes suffering from (or at risk of
developing) diabetic peripheral neuropathy1–5 or diabetic
retinopathy.6–9 Reduced corneal subbasal nerve fiber length
density (CNFL) has been reported in subjects with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes relative to healthy control subjects,4,6,8,10–19 but
reported values are based on small areas of the SBP (typically
0.16 mm2 in size) sampled using a small number of raw in vivo
confocal microscopy (IVCM) images. Prior studies also typically
include subjects widely varying in age, although age is known
to impact the SBP
.17,20 Moreover, an image sampling–based
strategy is sensitive to selection criteria, the disease state of the
SBP
, and observer experience/masking. As a result, nerve fiber
length density values in various cohorts differ across studies,
and it has been noted in systematic reviews that better
standardization of methods is required for clinical adoption of
IVCM to assess pathologic levels of nerve length density.21,22
Although wider depictions of the SBP could reduce the
variability inherent in image sampling, most clinical studies
report results based on sampling of nerve data from small areas
of the SBP
. Notable exceptions are a study in a cohort of
subjects with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, where mosaic
images representing a mean of three or four IVCM fields of view
were used,4 and a study in healthy subjects and multiple
sclerosis patients with mosaics having a mean of 7.7 fields of
view.23 In recent studies of contact lens wear, mosaics
consisting of six fields of view were used.24,25 In a single
earlier study,4 depth correction for SBP variation in the axial
plane was performed whereas in other studies it is not

 performed. ‘‘Depth correction’’ here refers to the projection of
subbasal nerve paths from a volume of imaged tissue onto a
single plane for further analysis. This correction could be
important because single IVCM images may not optimally
capture the correct plane of the subbasal plexus in a repeatable
manner, and the nerves and plexus themselves may not exist in
a single plane but may deviate in depth at a microscopic level.
Wide-area mosaics larger in size have been used to demonstrate
the potential of wide-field imaging of the SBP
,26 but the
mosaicking technique used was not fully automated and was
applied in only two subjects.
Recently we developed a method capable of rapid
reconstruction of wide-area mosaics with depth correction of
nerve fiber paths that resulted in SBP depiction with a mean
size of 37 IVCM fields of view (Lagali NS, et al., manuscript
submitted, 2017). In this study, the same mosaics obtained in a
clinical setting are analyzed with respect to characteristics of
the clinical cohort. The cohort consisted of a strict age-
controlled group of healthy subjects and individuals with
impaired glucose tolerance, short-, or long-duration type 2
diabetes mellitus. The relationship of new mosaic-based nerve
parameters mCNFL (corneal subbasal nerve fiber length
density across the entire depth-corrected mosaic area) and
wCNFL (corneal subbasal nerve fiber length density in a
defined circular whorl region within the depth-corrected
mosaic) with the presence and duration of diabetes was
investigated. Besides these quantitative parameters, mosaics
also enable qualitative assessment of the SBP to examine
possible effects of diabetes in altering the pattern and
distribution of subbasal nerve fibers.
METHODS
Study Population and Recruitment
Study participants were initially recruited in 2004 as part of the
V¨
asterbotten Intervention Programme, a large population-
based study in a northern Swedish county.27 As part of that
study, a group was recruited consisting of 129 age- and sex-
matched subjects aged 60 6 1 years (age of 60 years was an
inclusion criterion) with normal glucose tolerance (NGT),
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2 diabetes.
Exclusion criteria included subjects with nutritional deficien-
cies, asymmetric neuropathy (from sciatica or stroke), or an
inability to appear at the initial examination. Patients satisfying
enrolment criteria were included consecutively. Full details of
the initial cohort are given elsewhere.28
For the present study, subjects from the initial cohort were
included in a 10-year follow-up examination in 2014, for which
an additional ophthalmic examination was conducted at the
Eye Clinic of the Skellefte˚
a Hospital, Sweden. Ophthalmic
examination and patient records were used to exclude the
presence of corneal disorders, dry eye disease, or specific
topical medications that could affect the corneal nerves. For
subjects with unconfirmed diabetes, the status in 2014 was
assessed based on two oral glucose tolerance tests taken 1
week apart, with pathologic values required on both occasions
for confirmation of diabetes. The tests included fasting
capillary plasma glucose (fPG) and 2-hour capillary plasma
glucose (2hPG) levels. Glucose tolerance results were inter-
preted according to 1999 World Health Organization defini-
tions29 (NGT: fPG < 7.0 mM and 2hPG < 8.9 mM; IGT: fPG <
7.0 mM and 2hPG ‡ 8.9 to < 12.2 mM). For subjects with
confirmed type 2 diabetes from 2004, hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) levels in 2014 taken at the Ume˚
a University Hospital
were used to confirm continued diabetes status. Blood levels of
HbA1c (mmol/mol) were measured for all subjects in the
cohort, along with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) and
smoking status (nonsmoker or history of smoking). All subjects
gave written informed consent to participate, and the protocol
was approved by the ethical review board of the University of
Ume˚
a, Ume˚
a, Sweden (Ethical Application no. 2013-21-31M).
The conduct of the study adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki. A flowchart depicting inclusion of
subjects from the original 2004 study and the present study is
given in Figure 1.
Confocal Microscopy and Mosaic Image
Generation and Analysis
Bilateral corneal examination of study subjects was conducted
during a 5-day period in January 2014 using IVCM to image the
SBP (Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph 3 with Rostock Cornea
Module, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Ex-
aminations were performed by a single experienced examiner
using an adaptive method of image acquisition (Lagali NS, et al.,
manuscript submitted, 2017). Briefly, the method involved
manual raster scanning of the corneal subbasal layer with
simultaneous depth scanning at each new image position
(assisted by a joystick depth-control module), to create small-
depth stacks of subbasal plexus images typically comprising
three to five axial images at a given position. An average of 37
such positions (IVCM fields of view) per eye were scanned in
this manner, representing a mean mosaic area of 6 mm2. Raw
image sets obtained by IVCM examination underwent process-
ing by automated methods to produce depth-corrected wide-
area mosaics with continuous nerve fiber paths and nerve and
background intensity levels, as previously reported.4 Also,
nerves in mosaics were traced both manually and by a fully
automated method20 to quantify the total mosaic nerve fiber

 length density (mCNFL) and nerve fiber length density in the
inferocentral whorl region (wCNFL). The total length of all
traced nerves in a mosaic was divided by the mosaic area
containing subbasal plexus in mm2, yielding the mosaic
corneal subbasal nerve fiber length density (mCNFL) in mm/
mm2. For the whorl region, an expert identified the center
position (origin) of the whorl region in each mosaic. Then an
800-lm-diameter circular region centered on the origin was
defined. Total subbasal nerve length within this region was
computed and divided by the area of the circle to yield the
whorl mosaic corneal subbasal nerve fiber length density
(wCNFL) in mm/mm2. Values are reported as the mean value of
automated and manual tracing methods; mCNFL and wCNFL
for analyses consisted of averaged values from left and right
eyes of the same subject.
To understand the differences in mosaic analysis versus
standard image sampling of the SBP
, a comparison was
performed for two scenarios. In scenario 1 (sampling with
optimal depth correction), nonoverlapping 400 3 400-lm2
square image regions were cropped from each depth-corrected
mosaic; region locations were the exact locations of single
images of the acquired data. The resulting mean CNFL of these
cropped frames was considered. In scenario 2 (sampling of raw
non–depth-corrected images), single raw images were taken
from the same nonoverlapping regions identified in scenario 1.
For both scenarios and 1 to 20 selected fields, mean CNFL was
calculated for each possible combination of the selection (e.g.,
if three fields were selected, there would be 1140 possible
ways to choose these three fields among a total of 20 images).
Mean CNFL was then compared to the reference mCNFL to
determine absolute error (in mm/mm2) and relative error (%
error referenced to mCNFL). All mosaics were computer-
analyzed, and investigators at the site where nerve tracing and
quantification was performed (University of Padova, Padova,
Italy) were masked to the identity of subjects and subject
groups.
Power Analysis
With control and diabetes groups of 40 subjects each and an
expected standard deviation of 64 mm/mm2 in CNFL,20 the
minimum detectable difference in CNFL would be 2.5 mm/
mm2 for 80% statistical power at the 0.05 significance level. A
smaller standard deviation of 63.2 mm/mm2 would yield a
minimum detectable difference of 2 mm/mm2.
Statistical Analysis
The cohort was stratified in two ways for the analysis, diabetes
versus nondiabetes, and by duration of diabetes (NGT, IGT,
short- and long-duration diabetes). Mosaic CNFL, wCNFL, and
BMI in individuals with and without diabetes were compared
with the independent t-test, while age and HbA1c were
nonnormally distributed and tested with the Mann-Whitney
rank sum test. Sex and smoking status were compared with the
v2 test. Due to insufficient IGT group size to achieve statistical
power of 0.80, comparisons with diabetes duration were
limited to three groups (NGT, short-duration, and long-duration
diabetes). Groups of NGT and short- and long-duration diabetes
were assessed with 1-way ANOVA (where data was normally
distributed) to compare differences in mCNFL, wCNFL, age,
BMI, and HbA1c, with post hoc testing by the Tukey method.
For nonnormally distributed data, the Kruskal-Wallis 1-way
ANOVA on ranks was used, with Dunn’s post hoc method. Sex
and smoking status were assessed by the v2 test. Fasting plasma
glucose in NGT versus IGT and diabetes duration in long-
versus short-duration groups were assessed by the t-test after
confirmation of normal distribution of the data. Linear
regression was performed with mCNFL or wCNFL as the
dependent variable and diabetes presence, age, BMI, sex,
smoking status, and HbA1c as predictors. Power analysis was
performed by the built-in Power calculation function in
SigmaStat. Statistics were performed using SigmaStat 3.5 for
Windows (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and IBM
SPSS Statistics Ver. 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) with a 2-
tailed value of a < 0.05 considered significant unless otherwise
adjusted for multiple comparisons.

 ophthalmology outpatient clinic, representing approximately
32 eyes per day. The cohort was controlled with respect to age
(69.1 6 1.2 years, mean 6 SD), and all subjects resided in the
same county in northern Sweden for at least 10 years prior to
examination.
Corneal Nerve Degeneration in Type 2 Diabetes
Approximately half (n ¼ 39) of the study cohort of 82 subjects
had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at the time of examination,
based on the oral glucose tolerance test, while the remaining
subjects (n ¼ 43) did not have diabetes (having either NGT or
IGT; Table). Mosaic CNFL was reduced in type 2 diabetes
patients (t-test, P ¼ 0.018) relative to those of the same age
without type 2 diabetes. Mosaic CNFL was also reduced in
subjects with long-duration diabetes (‡10 years) relative to
equal-aged subjects with NGT (ANOVA, P ¼ 0.030, Tukey post
hoc test, P ¼ 0.023; Fig. 2A). The trend and significance of
difference between NGT and groups ‡ 10 years persisted
where data from only right eyes (ANOVA P ¼0.020; Tukey post
hoc test P ¼ 0.015) or only left eyes (ANOVA P ¼ 0.023; Tukey
post hoc test P ¼ 0.017) were used. When the additional group
of subjects with IGT was included, the general trend of
reduced mCNFL was detected even in this group (Fig. 2B), but
the group size was too small for the corresponding mCNFL
difference in order to test for significance with adequate
statistical power.
Whorl CNFL in an 800-lm-diameter region around the
whorl center was greater than the corresponding mCNFL value
in each subject group (Table); however, unlike mCNFL, wCNFL
did not differ between subjects with and without diabetes (t-
test, P ¼ 0.64), nor did it change with duration of diabetes
(ANOVA P ¼ 0.11; Table, Fig. 2C).
In a linear regression model, mCNFL was inversely
associated with having type 2 diabetes (b �0.24, P ¼ 0.032,
coefficient �1.803, constant 15.004). Since having a type 2
diabetes diagnosis is associated with high HbA1c, mCNFL was,
as expected, also inversely associated with high HbA1c (b
�0.22, P ¼ 0.047, coefficient �0.072, constant 17.428). By
contrast, by linear regression analysis wCNFL was not
associated with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (P ¼ 0.14) or
with the level of HbA1c (P ¼ 0.952).
Comparison of Standard CNFL Versus Depth-
Corrected mCNFL in a Diabetes Population
The potential for error in CNFL estimation by sampling multiple
single IVCM images or using raw non–depth-corrected IVCM
images was investigated (Fig. 3). Sampling of multiple single
IVCM images without wide-field reconstruction or depth
correction led to potentially large errors in CNFL, regardless of
the presence of diabetes. For scenario 1, on average, a 10%
overestimation of mCNFL occurs when sampling depth-correct-
ed IVCM images for analysis, while the potential error range is
larger and increases with decreasing number of sampled images.
For scenario 2, on average, a 30% underestimation of mCNFL
occurs in the more common case of sampling of raw non–depth-
corrected single IVCM images to determine CNFL, with the
potential error range again dependent upon the actual number
and location of sampled images.
Degradation of the SBP in Long-Duration Diabetes
In addition to providing quantitative measures, mosaic images
revealed patterns of nerve distribution within the SBP
.
Comparison of mosaics from newly diagnosed subjects
(diabetes diagnosed less than 1 year prior to IVCM examina-
tion) with long-term diabetes subjects (diagnosed over 20 years
prior to examination) indicated a dramatic degeneration of the
SBP (Fig. 4). Further qualitative comparison of mosaics from
subjects with NGT and same-aged subjects with long-term
diabetes indicated that within a standardized region of interest
of the SBP chosen for its central proximity and as a
distinguishable region with primarily vertically running nerve
fibers (Fig. 5), long primary nerve fibers with prominent
reflectivity were reduced in number in long-duration diabetes,
while additionally many short secondary interconnecting nerve
branches, normally dispersed among the main fibers, were

 absent (Fig. 6). The short interconnecting branches in many
cases lacked clear termination points at the longer nerve fibers.
DISCUSSION
In the present cohort it was found that a lower value of the
new parameter mCNFL was associated with having type 2
diabetes and that HbA1c was the mediator of this association.
Whorl CNFL, however, did not show reduction with type 2
diabetes, nor was wCNFL associated with the level of HbA1c.
The time elapsed after diagnosis of diabetes, however, was
associated with the progressive degradation of the corneal SBP
as measured by mCNFL. To our knowledge this is the first study
using wide-area mosaics in a large clinical cohort, representing
an area of the SBP 523 to 104 times the area analyzed in prior
cohort studies. In subjects aged 69 years in the present study,
mCNFL declined by 1.9 mm/mm2 in the diabetes group relative
to those without diabetes, while the decline was 2.4 mm/mm2
in long-duration diabetes relative to subjects with NGT. The
result was robust, with a significant decline in mCNFL detected
regardless of the examined eye (right, left, or both). The
reduction in mCNFL of approximately 15% was, however,
modest, and is notably outside the range of CNFL reduction
reported in diabetes subjects relative to nondiabetes subjects
in earlier studies, which all showed greater reduction in CNFL
(reduction range of 3.62–6.55 mm/mm2).4,6,8,15,16,21 It has
been pointed out in a systematic analysis, however, that these
prior studies exhibited a substantial degree of heterogeneity of
methods and results.21 Additionally, in prior studies, subjects
were not fixed in age, nor were wide-area mosaic images or
depth correction techniques used. On the other hand, mCNFL
reduction by 0.5 mm/mm2 in an early stage of IGT relative to

 NGT in this study is in line with a prior report describing a
modest decline of CNFL in IGT versus NGT,30 although in the
same study (not analyzing mosaics) baseline CNFL curiously
increased in NGT subjects over a period of 3 years.30
Interestingly, the whorl density wCNFL did not vary with
presence or duration of diabetes or HbA1c, but was largely
preserved. In three recent studies that did not employ wide-
field mosaicking or depth correction techniques,31–33 reduced
CNFL in the whorl region was reported in diabetes—a finding
that could not be confirmed in our cohort. In another study,
mosaic images indicated a decline in whorl density in diabetes,
although the study was limited to only two subjects.26 We
attribute these discrepancies, at least in part, to differences in
mosaicking, defining and analyzing the whorl area, and use of
depth correction methods. As shown in the analysis of
sampling with and without depth correction (Fig. 3), large
errors can result from human sampling of raw IVCM images for
analysis.
In the present study the visual appearance of the whorl
region in mosaic images also indicated preservation of the
whorl, with nerve loss appearing to occur mainly outside the
whorl, through loss of highly light-scattering primary nerve
fibers and, interestingly, the loss of many small, thinner
interconnecting secondary nerve fiber branches. The whorl
region may be more resistant to degeneration than more
peripheral corneal regions as it consists of primary nerve fibers
FIGURE 4.
Degeneration of the subbasal nerve plexus in long-duration type 2 diabetes (two subjects, examined 21 and 25 years after first diagnosis)
relative to newly diagnosed subjects (diagnosed less than 1 year prior to IVCM examination). Nerves traced from the mosaics of four study subjects
are shown. A loss of nerves predominantly from outside the whorl region was evident, along with loss of short, thin nerve branch segments. Scale
bars: 500 lm.

 arranged in a dense spiraling pattern with fewer interconnect-
ing secondary branches, the latter possibly being more prone
to degeneration. While nerve branch density (NBD) measured
as the number of nerve branches per mm2 is an IVCM
parameter that has been shown to be reduced in diabetes in
several studies,4,6,8,15,34,35 the level of reduction is highly
variable,21 and NBD reflects only the number of branching
points and not the actual length of the secondary branches.
Secondary nerve branch length outside the apical region may
therefore be an interesting parameter to concisely define and
quantify in future studies, provided that a method is used to
reliably image as many such branches as possible. In practice,
the thin secondary nerve branches are very sensitive to the
focal depth during IVCM examination and are often missed.
Small adjustments in focal depth at each imaging location (as
applied in the present method) produced small stacks of
images that could then be projected to a single plane in order
to detect the greatest possible number of secondary nerve
branches. Even with this method, however, not all secondary
nerve branches are visualized, due to inherent limitations of
the IVCM technique.36
Nevertheless, a new approach was presented for systematic
analysis and comparison of equivalent regions of the SBP across
subjects, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. To enable future
comparison across studies and longitudinally within the same
subjects, a suggestion is to consistently locate and image the
whorl region as a landmark, even where the whorl itself is
excluded from analysis. In this manner, the exact position of
images can be specified relative to the whorl center. This
approach minimizes a source of variability, as it is not
definitively known how certain parameters (such as CNFL
and nerve fiber branching) vary regionally within the SBP
. Even
the use of ‘‘central corneal images’’ is not a well-defined
concept, and in most if not all studies it cannot be verified that
IVCM images chosen for analysis actually originate from the
central cornea, as the IVCM hardware provides no such
feedback. Using standard anatomic reference locations along
with high-quality IVCM image data, automated approaches for
identifying and quantifying secondary nerve branches could be
employed, for example, using sophisticated algorithms as
recently proposed.37 Although the whorl position itself may
not be consistent across eyes, the suggested approach for
systematic analysis of the SBP referenced to the whorl location
represents a step toward standardization. The whorl is an
anatomic feature marking the corneal apical region. Such
landmark structures in the SBP are not currently used to guide
quantitative analysis of SBP parameters; images are chosen
based on subjective criteria and without specific reference to
SBP location.
Error analysis indicated that the potential for over- or
underestimation of CNFL relative to mCNFL is significant,
which may partially explain discrepancies in reported CNFL in
healthy and diabetic subjects21 relative to mCNFL values
reported here. At least part of the discrepancy may be due to
inclusion of the whorl region in mCNFL and its intended or
unintended exclusion in other studies. Overestimation errors
could also result from subjective selection of images depicting
multiple, highly reflecting nerves with good contrast and
ignoring those regions with sparse nerves or with only thin,
secondary branches visible. Such errors may be minimized by
evaluation of larger groups of subjects and reporting and
comparing group means as is commonly done; however, this
does not address the potentially large errors inherent in CNFL
of a given single eye. Also, more effort toward a consensus
regarding either inclusion or exclusion of the whorl region is
needed. Thresholds for acceptable image quality and nerve
visibility are also necessary, to avoid the use of images with
only partial or low-quality depiction of nerves, which could
impact CNFL accuracy. From the error analysis, however, an
optimum number of sampled IVCM images could be proposed
for a given range of acceptable error relative to mCNFL. From
Figure 3, if 12 IVCM image frames are sampled, then an error
range of approximately�10% toþ30% would result (black lines
in Fig. 3), provided that the sampled images fulfill two
conditions: (1) no overlap of nerves in the 12 sampled images
and (2) that each sampled image is depth-corrected, that is, a
projection of a small stack of IVCM images at that location at
slightly different depths. If the second condition is not met and
instead 12 raw IVCM images were sampled, then the error
range would be an unacceptable �50% to �10% (red lines in
Fig. 3), representing an underestimation bias due to incom-
plete visibility of subbasal nerves in single-depth IVCM images.
A limitation of the present study was the relatively small
number of individuals in the IGT and short-duration diabetes
groups, which precluded a more robust statistical analysis of
mCNFL changes in these stages relative to the NGT group,
given the level of variance in mCNFL. This variance was just
small enough to detect changes between individuals with and
without diabetes or between NGT and long-term diabetes
groups with sufficient power. Conversely, strengths of the
present study were the high quality and large size of the wide-
area mosaics, rapid imaging in a clinical setting and rapid
construction and analysis of mosaics, robust analysis with
automated and manual methods and left/right eyes, the
number of full whorl regions imaged and quantified, and the
examination of an age-controlled cohort.
In conclusion, wide-area mosaic mapping of the corneal
SBP revealed a modest 15% decline in mCNFL in subjects with
FIGURE 5.
Choice of a standardized region of interest of the SBP for
comparative analysis across eyes. The region of interest is chosen for its
central corneal location and its ease of recognition with primarily
vertically running main nerve fibers. The region size is 1100 3 650 lm
(width 3 height) and is approximately horizontally aligned with the
center of the whorl region (indicated by an asterisk). The exact
location of the region is specified in terms of the distance from the
bottom left corner to the whorl center, indicated by the two arrows. In
this case, this region-of-interest bottom left corner is located 490 lm to
the left and 488 lm above the whorl center.

 diabetes over the long term. Conversely, nerve fibers of the
apical whorl region (as quantified by wCNFL) were preserved
in diabetes, with nerve degeneration occurring predominantly
outside the whorl with an apparent loss of secondary nerve
fiber branches losing their connections to the primary nerves.
Analyzing depth-corrected mosaic images provides the possi-
bility to detect and document peripheral nerve degeneration in
a more robust manner than CNFL, and may represent a
valuable tool in the early detection of early SBP changes in
diabetes.

Loss of SBP nerve fibers in long-duration diabetes. In contrast to full mosaics used for mCNFL analysis, images here represent only a part
of the full depth-corrected mosaic, cropped to equal-size image regions, to facilitate comparison between similar regions of the subbasal plexus from
different subjects. Regions are compared between (A–C) nondiabetes subjects and (D–F) long-duration diabetes subjects. In subjects without
diabetes, long nerve fibers were present, along with thin, short, interconnecting nerve branches (white arrows), which in the depth-corrected
mosaics had an identifiable origin and termination point on longer main nerve fibers. By contrast, in long-duration diabetes, main nerve branches
were fewer while the thin interconnecting branches were exceedingly difficult to detect even in depth-corrected mosaics, and where detected
(black arrows), these branches did not have well-defined origins and/or termination points. All mosaic regions depicted are 1100 3 650 lm in size
(width 3 height), with subject age and relative location of the image in microns given (distance from bottom left corner to whorl center, i.e., 1048,
701, indicates that the whorl center is 1048 lm to the right and 701 lm below the bottom left corner of the image in [A]). Scale bars: 500 lm.
