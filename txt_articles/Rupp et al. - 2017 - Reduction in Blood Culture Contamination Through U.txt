Background. Blood culture contamination is a clinically significant problem that results in patient harm and excess cost.
Methods. In a prospective, controlled trial at an academic center Emergency Department, a device that diverts and sequesters 
the initial 1.5–2 mL portion of blood (which presumably carries contaminating skin cells and microbes) was tested against standard 
phlebotomy procedures in patients requiring blood cultures due to clinical suspicion of serious infection.
Results. In sum, 971 subjects granted informed consent and were enrolled resulting in 904 nonduplicative subjects with 1808 
blood cultures. Blood culture contamination was significantly reduced through use of the initial specimen diversion device™ (ISDD) 
compared to standard procedure: (2/904 [0.22%] ISDD vs 16/904 [1.78%] standard practice, P = .001). Sensitivity was not compro-
mised: true bacteremia was noted in 65/904 (7.2%) ISDD vs 69/904 (7.6%) standard procedure, P = .41. No needlestick injuries or 
potential bloodborne pathogen exposures were reported. The monthly rate of blood culture contamination for all nurse-drawn and 
phlebotomist-drawn blood cultures was modeled using Poisson regression to compare the 12-month intervention period to the 6 
month before and after periods. Phlebotomists (used the ISDD) experienced a significant decrease in blood culture contamination 
while the nurses (did not use the ISDD) did not. In sum, 73% of phlebotomists completed a post-study anonymous survey and 
widespread user satisfaction was noted.
Conclusions. Use of the ISDD was associated with a significant decrease in blood culture contamination in patients undergoing 
blood cultures in an Emergency Department setting.

Blood cultures are frequently obtained in the care of patients 
with serious infections to detect bacteremia and fungemia and 
guide specific antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, contam-
ination rates routinely range from 0.6% to 6%, resulting not 
infrequently in unnecessary antibiotic treatment and added labo-
ratory expense [1]. False-positive blood cultures increase labora-
tory costs by approximately 20%, are associated with a nearly 40% 
increase in antibiotic charges, are treated with antimicrobials up 
to one half of the time, extend the length of hospital stay by up 
to 5 days, and subject patients to the real harms associated with 
antibiotic exposure such as toxicity, adverse effects, interactions, 
and emergence of resistance [2–7]. Because of their clinical sig-
nificance, great efforts have been expended to limit false-positive 
blood cultures including the use of various skin disinfectants, 
trained phlebotomy teams, blood culture kits, needle exchange 
systems, culture bottle disinfection protocols, use of sterile gloves, 
and other programmatic attempts to limit contamination [1, 2, 8, 
9]. Contamination of blood cultures is thought to be due in part 
to skin fragments colonized with bacteria that are dislodged with 
venipuncture [10]. The purpose of this project was to test a device 
that diverts and sequesters the first 1.5–2 mL portion of blood, 
which presumably carries the contaminating skin fragments, 
from the culture specimen to determine whether blood culture 
contamination is diminished [11].

system designed to divert and sequester the initial 1.5 to 2.0 
mL of blood prior to culture bottle inoculation (ISDD diagram 
available in online supplemental materials).
Subjects
Adult patients requiring phlebotomy for blood culture due to 
clinical suspicion of serious infection.
Procedures
From November 2014 through October 2015, a convenience 
sample of subjects granting informed consent had paired blood 
cultures obtained by trained phlebotomists. Prior to venipunc-
ture, the skin was disinfected with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate 
and 70% alcohol for 30 seconds and allowed to dry. The first 
blood sample (20 mL) was procured using standard procedures 
in which blood was drawn into a syringe and then injected 
into blood culture vials. The second blood sample (20 mL) was 
obtained using the ISDD in which the initial 1.5–2.0 mL of 
blood was diverted into a holding chamber and, upon activa-
tion, the rest of the sample was directed into the blood culture 
vials. In general, paired cultures were obtained from opposite 
arms. Standard aseptic practices were followed, and the blood 
culture vial tops were cleansed with 70% isopropyl alcohol pads 
before blood inoculation. Blood cultures were monitored using 
the BACTEC 9240 system (Becton Dickinson) with positive 
bottles being further characterized by film array (Biofire) and 
automated identification and susceptibility testing (Microscan). 
A culture was defined as contaminated if one or more of the 
following skin-residing organisms was recovered from only 
one of the paired cultures: coagulase-negative staphylococci, 
Propionibacterium sp., Micrococcus sp., viridians group strepto-
cocci, Corynebacterium sp., or Bacillus sp.
Survey
An anonymous 7-question post-study survey was distributed 
to the phlebotomists who used the device to gather qualitative 
information about user experience (survey form available in 
online supplemental materials).
Statistical Analysis
McNemar’s test was used to compare proportions of blood 
cultures that were contaminated as well as those yielding true 
pathogens. Fisher exact test was used to examine the associa-
tion between individual phlebotomists and contamination rate. 
The time-to-detection was compared using the paired t-test. In 
a post hoc analysis of blood cultures obtained in the emergency 
department, the rate of blood culture contamination for all cul-
tures (phlebotomist-drawn and nurse-drawn cultures for all 
patients—those in the study and those not enrolled), as defined 
by a standard laboratory definition maintained by the hospi-
tal clinical microbiology laboratory, was compared for 3 time 
periods: 6 months prior to initiation of the project, 12-month 
intervention period, and 6-month post intervention. Poisson 
regression was used to model the rate of contamination per 
month as a function of intervention.
RESULTS
Nine-hundred seventy-one subjects granted informed consent 
and were enrolled resulting in 904 subjects with 1808 blood 
cultures after exclusion of repeat patients. Fifty-five percent of 
the subjects were male, and the mean age was 59 years. In sum, 
152/1808 (8.4%) of the blood cultures yielded microbial growth 
with 134/1808 (7.4%) regarded as true pathogens and 18/1808 
(1%) regarded as contaminants. The ISDD was associated with 
less blood culture contamination compared to standard proce-
dure (Figure 1): (2/904 [0.22%] vs 16/904 [1.78%], P = .001). 
Sensitivity was not compromised: true septicemia was noted 
in 65/904 (7.2%) with ISDD and 69/904 (7.6%) with stand-
ard procedure, P = .41 (Figure 1). The time to detection did 
not vary between the 2 methods. The mean time to detection 
for the standard procedure method was 13.68 hours (SD 8.43 
hours) compared to 15.60 hours (SD 13.93 hours) for the ISDD 
(P = .16). The ratio of true positive to false positive culture for 
ISDD was 33:1 (65/2) and for standard procedure 4.3:1 (69/16); 
the likelihood of a positive culture being a true positive for ISDD 
was 97% (65/67) and for standard procedure, 81% (69/85). No

association was noted between the 11 individual phlebotomists 
and contamination using ISDD (P = .62) or standard procedure 
(P = .31). If all subjects are included in the analysis (N = 971 
subjects; 1942 blood cultures) the results do not differ with the 
contamination rate being 0.21% (ISDD) vs 1.65% (standard 
procedure), and the true septicemia rate being 7.2% (ISDD) vs 
7.3% (standard procedure). No needlestick injuries or potential 
bloodborne pathogen exposures were reported.
Microbiologic results are fully characterized in (Table 1). 
The most common cause of true bacteremia were the 
Enterobacteriaceae (39%) followed by S. aureus (20.7%). Blood 
culture contamination was noted in 16 of the standard pro-
cedure cultures and was most prominently caused by coagu-
lase-negative staphylococci (50%) and Propionibacterium sp. 
(19%), whereas only 2 of the ISDD cultures were contaminated. 
Discordance between the 2 methods of phlebotomy with regard 
to detection of true bacteremia was essentially equal (Table 1). 
In 12 instances, the standard procedure yielded a true patho-
gen while the ISDD was sterile, and in 11 instances, the ISDD 
yielded a true pathogen while the standard procedure was ster-
ile. The bacterial species involved in the discordant true bacte-
remia results were similar between the 2 phlebotomy methods 
(Table 1). The 8 cases in which common skin flora were recov-
ered from both the ISDD and standard procedure cultures 
were further reviewed. Four cases each were due to coagulase- 
negative staphylococci and viridans streptococci, respectively. 
In 7 of the cases, Infectious Diseases consultation was obtained 
at the time of bacteremia, and in all 7, the bloodstream isolate 
was regarded as the result of an infection. Bacteremia due to 
normal skin flora was secondary to the following conditions: 
endocarditis (2), left ventricular assist device infection (1), 
orthopedic hardware infection (1), cholangitis (1), urosep-
sis (1), infected decubitus ulcer (1). In the case not seen by an 
Infectious Diseases expert, the patient experienced a colonic 
perforation and had viridans streptococci recovered from blood 
and peritoneal fluid. For the purposes of the study analysis, all 
of these subjects were regarded as having true bacteremia.
In the post hoc analysis, the rate of blood culture contam-
ination for cultures obtained by phlebotomists and nurses in 
the emergency department during the intervention period was 
compared to the contamination rate in the 6-month periods 
preceding and following. The rate of contamination was signifi-
cantly decreased during the intervention amongst the phleboto-
mists but was not significantly different for nurses (who did not 
use the ISDD) (Table 2).
Eight of 11 (73%) of phlebotomists returned a completed 
survey. Phlebotomists related that the ISDD was easy to use, 
and a widely perceived advantage was the ability to easily draw 
additional tubes of blood in addition to the sample for culture 
and the lack of need to transfer blood from a syringe to blood 
culture vials. Most phlebotomists noted that they purposely 
avoided use of the ISDD for uncooperative patients or those 
who were perceived to be a “hard stick” due to small or fragile 
veins.
DISCUSSION
We observed a significant decrease in blood culture contam-
ination associated with use of the ISDD. Contamination is 
thought to be due to bacteria that are carried on skin cells that 
are dislodged with venipuncture [10] and the ISDD functions 
by diverting and sequestering the first 1.5–2 mL of blood, which 
contain the contaminants, away from the rest of the sample to 
be cultured [11]. Although initial specimen diversion is not 
widely used to prevent contamination of blood cultures, it is a 
standard technique in blood banking and has been successfully 
employed worldwide to minimize the risk of microbial contam-
ination of blood components [12]. Reassuringly, no decrease in 
detection of true bacteremia was noted in our study. The dis-
cordant detection of true bacteremia between the 2 methods of 
phlebotomy was essentially equal (12 subjects with (+) standard 
procedure blood culture and (−) ISDD culture vs 11 subjects 
with (+) ISDD blood culture and (−) standard procedure cul-
ture), which emphasizes the need for 2 sets of blood cultures in 
order to adequately detect true bacteremia. Lee et al noted that

only 73% of episodes of true bacteremia were detected with a 
single blood culture [13]. Phlebotomists noted that the ISDD 
was easy to use, and it was versatile in collecting blood for both 
cultures and other laboratory tests. There were no reported nee-
dle stick injuries or potential blood borne pathogen exposures.
A large number of techniques can be used to limit blood 
culture contamination, and the ISDD should be used to com-
plement other approaches. First, personnel performing blood 
cultures should be well trained and dedicated to the task [4, 
14]. The skin should be disinfected prior to venipuncture, but 
the optimum choice of disinfectant continues to be debated 
[15, 16]. Drawing blood for cultures from indwelling catheters 
should be avoided unless the catheter is thought to be the source 
of bacteremia [17]. Strict aseptic practices must be maintained 
throughout the process of phlebotomy and transfer of blood to 
culture vials [18, 19] and use of a prepackaged blood culture 
kit has proven useful in reducing contamination in a variety of 
settings [2, 20]. Finally, monitoring the rate of contamination 
and reporting surveillance data regularly to phlebotomists is 
recommended [2]. Unfortunately, none of these preventative 
measures will eliminate blood culture contamination due to the 
microbes that survive local skin disinfection and are inadvert-
ently included in the blood specimen with dislodged dermal 
cells. In our emergency department, where most of the con-
tamination prevention measures described above are routinely 
employed, the baseline rate of blood culture contamination in 
the standard lab procedure cultures was 1.78%, well within the 
target of <3% that is generally regarded as the expected rate of 
contamination when blood cultures are properly performed 
[21, 22]. This already low rate of contamination was further 
reduced to 0.22% with the use of the ISDD. Syringe withdraw of 
venous blood (usually 20 mL) for culture has long been a rou-
tine practice. However, the mixing of blood in the syringe barrel 
is likely to distribute skin fragments in the 2 portions (10 mL 
each) for the aerobic and anaerobic mediums resulting in recov-
ery of microbes in both bottles and erroneously suggesting a 
high concentration of skin residing organisms.
The post hoc analysis of the rate of blood culture contam-
ination in the emergency department further documents the 
impact of the ISDD and assesses for secular trends in the con-
tamination rate. A higher rate of contamination was observed 
for the phlebotomists (who used the ISDD during the inter-
vention period) in both the pre- and post-periods compared to 
the intervention period. The rate of contamination for nurse-
drawn blood cultures (who did not use the ISDD) did not 
vary significantly over the 3 evaluation periods. Interestingly, 
although the rate of contamination of nurse-drawn cultures 
remained consistently higher than that associated with phle-
botomist-drawn cultures, the contamination rate for nurses did 
appear to decrease over the course of the intervention period 
and post-intervention period. We hypothesize this decrease was 
due to spill-over (ie, our work with the phlebotomists in the 
emergency department increased the awareness of proper tech-
nique and the clinical impact of blood culture contamination 
with the emergency department nurses). We are not aware of 
any programmatic changes in nurse blood culture practices.
Blood culture contamination is a clinically significant prob-
lem that results in extra expense and patient harm. Alahmadi 
et al noted in a case-control study in the United Kingdom that 
blood culture contamination was associated with 5.4 extra hos-
pital days at a cost of approximately $7500 USD [7]. Similarly, 
in the United States, Gander and colleagues observed excess 
charges of $8720 per contamination event [4]. Blood culture 
contamination is associated with unneeded antibiotic treatment 
in approximately 30%–40% of patients [3, 5, 6]. Although rapid 
blood culture technology, such as nucleic acid amplification 
assays, enables laboratories to greatly reduce the time needed 
to identify various microbes, thus limiting misinterpretation 
and unneeded tests and antimicrobics, these rapid techniques 
are often very costly. Therefore, costs associated with efforts to 
reduce blood culture contamination can be highly cost effec-
tive, even in the era of rapid diagnostics. Although a rigorous 
cost-effectiveness analysis is beyond the scope of this project 
and is speculative, we noted in the 6 months before and after our 
project a contamination rate of 2.6% (N = 407) stemming from 
the 15 442 blood cultures obtained by phlebotomist throughout 
the hospital. If the low rate of contamination that we observed 
in the study (0.22%) was applied to all blood cultures obtained 
by phlebotomists, it would equate to 373 prevented episodes of 
contamination. The costs associated with blood culture con-
tamination range from $1000 (1998) to $8700 (2009) per case 
[4, 5]. If a midpoint cost estimate is used ($4850), and the added

cost of the device is not taken into account, it equates to a cost 
avoidance of 1.8 million dollars per year at our institution.
Our study has several important limitations that should be 
noted. First, the study was conducted at a single center in an 
emergency department, and thus questions regarding generaliz-
ability are valid. Similarly, a convenience sample of patients was 
studied (approximately 36% of the total number of blood cul-
tures obtained by phlebotomists in the emergency department 
during the intervention period were included in the primary 
analysis). The convenience sampling may have led to selection 
bias. Most of the phlebotomists noted that they avoided use of 
the ISDD for uncooperative patients or those with poor vascular 
access. Consecutive patient inclusion was made more difficult 
by the IRB-imposed requirement for informed consent—thus 
excluding incompetent patients and those requiring immediate 
attention (ie, limited time to obtain informed consent). It could 
be argued that in a nonsignificant risk study, informed consent 
should not be required to employ an FDA-registered and listed 
device 
[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/
cfRL/rl.cfm?lid=347659&lpcd=KST] in the manner in which 
the device is intended to be used. Legitimate questions remain 
with regard to broader use of the ISDD and whether it would 
function in the same manner when used for all patients. Also, 
the ISDD was compared to our standard practice that involved 
phlebotomy via a syringe and subsequent transfer of blood to 
culture vials rather than a direct inoculation to medium sys-
tem. Future studies could involve comparison of ISDD vs. direct 
to medium blood culture systems. Finally, the 1.5 to 2.0 mL of 
blood sequestered by the ISDD might prove to be problem-
atic in patients with very low blood volume, such as neonates. 
However, we have no reason to believe ISDD would not reduce 
blood culture contamination with broader application in most 
other patient populations.
In conclusion, use of the ISDD resulted in a significant 
reduction in blood culture contamination to a very low rate 
of 0.22% in a convenience sample of emergency department 
patients. Reduced blood culture contamination should result 
in decreased costs and improved clinical outcome measures. 
The ISDD should be further studied in a broader sampling of 
consecutive patients including children. The very low rate of 
contamination observed in our study may justify abandonment 
of the current practice of performing 2 separate venipunctures 
(in order to better rule out contamination), which would result 
in improved patient satisfaction and healthcare provider safety 
(fewer venipunctures). In addition, use of the ISDD to draw 
blood from vascular catheters should be explored to see if simi-
lar blood culture contamination reduction is observed.
