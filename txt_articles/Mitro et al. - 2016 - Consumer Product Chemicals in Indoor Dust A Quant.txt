ABSTRACT: Indoor dust is a reservoir for commercial
consumer product chemicals, including many compounds
with known or suspected health effects. However, most dust
exposure studies measure few chemicals in small samples. We
systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on
phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluor-
oalkyl substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environ-
mental phenols and estimated pooled geometric means (GMs)
and 95% confidence intervals for 45 chemicals measured in ≥3
data sets. In order to rank and contextualize these results, we
used the pooled GMs to calculate residential intake from dust
ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake from air, and then
identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer Products
Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes.
Phthalates occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs, fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and
RFRs had the highest residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals in dust share hazard traits such as reproductive and
endocrine toxicity. We offer recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor exposure science. This
information is critical in shaping future exposure and health studies, especially related to cumulative exposures, and in providing
evidence for intervention development and public policy.
■ INTRODUCTION
People in developed countries spend more than 90% of their
time in indoor environments,1 creating an important link
between indoor environmental quality and public health.
Consumer products and building materials including furniture,
electronics, personal care and cleaning products, and floor and
wall coverings contain chemicals that can leach, migrate, abrade,
or off-gas from products resulting in human exposure.2,3
Consequently, chemicals such as phthalates, phenols, flame
retardants, and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are
widely detected in the U.S. general population, including
vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children.4−6
Exposure to one or more of these chemical classes has been
associated with adverse health effects including reproductive
toxicity, endocrine disruption, cognitive and behavioral impair-
ment in children, cancer, asthma, immune dysfunction, and
chronic disease.7−9
Many emerging and current use consumer product chemicals
of concern are semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), which
exist in the gas and condensed phase and redistribute from their
original source over time, partitioning between indoor air, dust,
and surfaces. Consequently, exposure to SVOC chemicals in the
indoor environment may occur from air, dust, and dermal
pathways.10−13 For some phthalate diesters, the use of consumer
products and indoor exposures are major contributors to human
exposure.14−17 Similarly, for some flame retardants, dust is a
significant contributor to exposure,18−20 while the contribution
of the indoor environment to total exposure of PFASs is less well
characterized.21,22 The chemical properties, sources, exposure
pathways and major health effects associated with each chemical
class are reviewed in the following sources: phthalates,16,23−26
flame retardants,25,27,28 environmental phenols,25,26,29,30 syn-
thetic fragrances,29,31,32 and PFASs.25,33,34

 Dust can provide critical information on consumer product
chemicals in the indoor environment.35 First, it is a window into
which chemicals are present indoors.36,37 Second, because
SVOCs partition between air and dust in the indoor environ-
ment, dust concentrations can be used in equilibrium
partitioning models to estimate air concentrations and character-
ize total residential intake with reasonable accuracy.38,39 Finally,
characterizing exposures from indoor dust may have important
implications for children’s health. Young children are particularly
vulnerable to chemical exposures from dust since they crawl, play
on the floor, and frequently put their hands in their mouths.40
Increased dust contact likely plays a role in the higher body
burden of flame retardants in young children compared to their
parents.18,19,41−44
However, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive assessment
of current use chemicals in dust because few indoor dust studies
report on a broad range of consumer product chemi-
cals.26,39,45−47 Most studies measure only one or two chemical
classes, and a number emphasize legacy chemicals like PBDEs.
Further, the small sample sizes and convenience populations
used in most studies make it difficult to assess generalizability to a
broader population. Comprehensive estimates of consumer
product chemical concentration patterns and common coex-
posures in environmental media are needed to prioritize
chemicals and better understand potential cumulative exposures
and impacts.48−51
Given these existing data gaps, the objective of our study is to
synthesize indoor dust data for a wide suite of consumer product
chemicals and assess implications for human exposure and
health. Specifically, we aggregate dust data measured in US
indoor environments, focusing on the following SVOC classes:
phthalates, RFRs (also known as novel FRs), environmental
phenols, synthetic fragrance, and PFASs. From this data
aggregation, we calculate pooled concentrations, use these
pooled concentrations to estimate residential intake, and then
describe hazard traits of the chemicals to provide context for the
potential health effects. Finally, we make recommendations for
future exposure research.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Systematic Literature Search. We first conducted a
screening-level literature search to identify current-use classes
of SVOC consumer product chemicals measured in dust. The
preliminary search identified five chemical classes: phthalates and
phthalate replacements, RFRs, PFAS, synthetic fragrances, and
environmental phenols. Other chemical classes in dust that were
not included in this analysis include legacy chemicals,
combustion byproducts, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and metals.
Legacy chemicals, such as PBDEs and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs), are not currently used in U.S. commerce. Combustion
byproducts (e.g, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are not
commonly found in consumer products. Pharmaceuticals and
pesticides are not “consumer products” as defined in the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Act, and metals are not SVOCs.3,52,53
We then conducted a comprehensive literature search for dust
analysis studies in February 2015, using PubMed and Web of
Science databases for all document types. In order to capture data
that would be most informative on contemporary dust
composition, we limited our search to studies published during
or after the year 2000. The search terms used were [flame
retardant*] AND [dust*], [fragrance*] OR [musk*] AND
[dust*], [perfluorin*] OR [polyfluorin*] AND [dust*],
[phthalate*] AND [dust*], [alkylphenol*] OR [BPA*] OR
[paraben*] AND [dust*], and [“semivolatile organic”] OR
[“semivolatile organic”] OR [SVOC] AND [dust*]. We also
included two unpublished data sets provided by members of our
study team.
Studies met the eligibility criteria if samples were collected:
during or after the year 1999, in the United States, indoors
(residential, nonresidential, and vehicle environments), and
using a vacuum cleaner (either study vacuumed or from an
existing used bag). Studies were excluded if: they collected
samples in an international airplane, did not measure chemicals
of interest, did not report on primary data, or were not in English.
Three additional studies and 1 unpublished data set were
excluded during preparations for the meta-analysis because
samples measured in the U.S. were not analyzed separately from
international samples; they relied on data previously published in
another study; or no quantitative data were reported (Figure 1).
Meta-Analysis. Only chemicals that were measured in ≥3
data sets were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. We
collected descriptive information from the eligible published and
unpublished studies, including chemicals measured; geographic
location; microenvironment sampled, study year; dust collection
and storage methods (Supporting Information (SI) Table S1);
analytical methods; and quality control measures (SI Table S2).
We also collected quantitative information, including sample
size, method detection limits (MDL), percent of samples above
the MDL, and the following summary statistics: minimum; 10th,
25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles; maximum; mean;
standard deviation; geometric mean (GM); and geometric
standard deviation (GSD). Twenty-nine of 31 papers and the
one unpublished data set were missing information determined
critical for between-study comparison (collection method, sieve

 size, storage method, MDL, percent detected, maximum,
median, GM, GSD, or study geographic location), so we
contacted the corresponding authors to collect that information.
The corresponding authors provided the needed information for
20 of the papers and the unpublished data set. In order to use all
available data, we included in the meta-analysis all studies that
reported the GM and GSD for the chemicals of interest, even if
the paper was missing other information. Five studies were
excluded at this stage because they did not report GM and GSD,
or because they examined chemicals measured by fewer than two
other studies (so pooled GM estimates from three data sets could
not be calculated).54−58 In total, we were able to include data
from 26 papers and one unpublished data set in the meta-analysis
(Figure 1).
We estimated pooled GM dust concentrations for 45
chemicals using GMs and GSDs (Figure 1, SI Table S3). GMs
and GSDs were used whenever data were available, including
cases in which fewer than 50% of the data were > MDL (12
instances total). Below-MDL values were imputed by each
study’s author, and most commonly were assigned the value of
MDL/2 or MDL/√2 (SI Table S4). Pooled GMs and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were generated for all chemicals
measured in at least three data sets using random effects models
in the R Metafor package (version 1.9−7). In cases where a study
contained more than one geographic location (e.g., sampling in
two states), each study location was counted as a separate data
set. In cases where a corresponding author sent GM or GSD
estimates that differed from the published data, we used the
estimates sent by the author.
We additionally used random effects models in the R Metafor
package to test whether concentrations differed by micro-
environment (residential (n = 29 data sets) versus nonresidential
(n = 13 data sets)) or sieve size (≤150 μm (n = 15 data sets)
versus >150 μm (n = 21 data sets); testing RFRs and PFASs
only). Only chemicals measured in at least three data sets
collected from each type of microenvironment were compared.
Intake Assessment. To provide context to the pooled dust
concentrations, we estimated residential intake (mg/kg-d) for
each chemical and used these estimates to rank chemicals from
low to high intake. We queried EPA’s EPI Suite (v4.11) for
physicochemical data, including octanol−water (Kow) and
octanol−air (Koa) partitioning coefficient and Henry’s law
constant, for each chemical, using estimated values rather than
empirical values for consistency. One chemical (EH-TBB) was
excluded because it lacked physicochemical data in EPISuite
(Figure 1). Using the modeled GM dust concentrations and
available physicochemical data, we estimated daily residential
intake for an adult female and child (3−6 years old) from three
exposure routes: dermal uptake from gas phase, inhalation of air,
and dust ingestion. We excluded the dermal intake through dust
adherence route since it is typically minor59 and the intake
parameters required to estimate this route were not consistently
available across all chemicals of interest. For TDCIPP where
residential dust concentrations differed significantly from
nonresidential concentrations, we excluded nonresidential
concentrations from the intake calculations. We estimated
indoor air concentrations from pooled GM dust concentrations
using partitioning theory first proposed by Weschler and
Nazaroff and further empirically validated by Dodson et al.,
which relies on Koa and assumptions about the organic content of
air and dust.38,39 While this method of estimating air
concentrations from dust concentrations may be applied to
most chemicals in our analysis, it cannot be applied to the PFASs,
which are typically found at lower relative levels in air (pg/m3
range).60 Thus, for PFASs, we estimated residential intake only
via the dust ingestion pathway. For all other chemicals, we
estimated gas-phase air concentrations for the dermal uptake and
total air concentrations, that is, gas- and particulate-phase
concentrations, for air inhalation intake (SI Table S5). Exposure

aCAS RN used for intake assessment is bolded, CAS RN used for hazard identification is italicized. bAbbreviations used are “Practical Abbreviations
(PRAB)” according to Bergman, et al. (2012).85 c3194−55−6 is the most accurate CAS RN to use for the HBCD technical mixture. However, it has
historically also been referred to with the CAS RN 25637−99−4, and is referenced with this number in a variety of regulatory documents and
authoritative lists.93 Hazards listed for HBCDD in the hazard table (Figure 4) reflect hazards associated with both CAS RNs in the SCP CC list.

isomers are measured together in every study, exposure to the mixture is likely and thus we have provided the hazard information for the mixture and
added intakes for the individual isomers together in order to rank the mixture by intake in the hazard table. eAbbreviations from the Centers for

ethoxylation (EO) units.96 NPEs with 8 or fewer EO units are typically grouped together as the most toxic forms.97 Hazard information for NPEO
(Mixture of 4-nonylphenol ethoxylates; includes 4-nonylphenol monoethoxylate AND 4-nonylphenol diethoxylate; NP1EO and NP2EO) is available
from the SCP CC list, but studies measured individual isomers (NP1EO, NP2EO). Because isomers are measured together in every study, exposure
to the mixture is likely and thus we have provided the hazard information for the mixture and added intakes for the individual isomers together in
order to rank the mixture by intake in the hazard table. h9036−19−5 is the CAS RN for a mixture of ethoxylated octylphenols (OPEO, includes
octylphenol monoethoxylate AND octylphenol diethoxylate; OP1EO and OP2EO).98 9036−19−5 was used for the intake assessment for OP1EO
and OP2EO as physicochemical properties for individual isomers were not available in EpiSuite, but are not expected to differ significantly from the

 factors are listed in SI Table S6 and equations used to estimate
intake are further described in the SI.
Hazard Identification. To provide summary information on
each chemical’s potential hazard(s), we used the California Safer
Consumer Products Candidate Chemical (SCP CC) list, which
is compiled from existing authoritative lists established by federal
and state governmental bodies in North America and Europe,
and identifies hazard trait(s) for each chemical.61 While the
particular criteria used by each authoritative body differ, all are
science-based consensus processes that require some form of
comprehensive review of the evidence in order to support
regulatory decision-making (SI Table S7). Hazard traits
identified by authoritative bodies fall into broad general
categories (e.g., carcinogenic, reproductive toxicity), with each
body providing further detailed documents on the particular
chemical.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Systematic Literature Search. The literature search
identified 1538 published papers and abstracts, of which 34
papers and two unpublished data sets met the inclusion criteria
(Figure 1). One hundred seventy-two chemicals from the five
classes of interest were measured in at least one study, including
13 phthalates, 24 PFAS, 25 fragrances, 47 RFRs, and 62 phenols.
Of these chemicals, fewer than half (74 chemicals) were
measured in two or more studies (SI Table S8). The total
number of studies available differed by chemical class: phthalates
and certain RFRs were the most likely to be measured (up to 10
studies per chemical), while phenols and fragrances were
measured less frequently. The large proportion of fragrances
(96%), phenols (65%), and RFRs (57%) measured in only one
study indicates that further research is needed to characterize
these chemical classes in dust.
There was considerable variability in the abbreviations and
acronyms used to identify the various chemicals across studies
and CAS Registry Numbers (CAS RN) were rarely reported. In
order to ensure correct chemical identification, we relied on the
full chemical names identified in each paper at the first
introduction of the acronym. The inconsistency of acronym
use necessitated the manual matching of each acronym to a full
chemical name, and precluded quick comparison across studies.
We present CAS RNs, full chemical names, and abbreviations in
Table 1.
Studies differed in the methods used to collect the dust (study
vacuumed or existing used bag), in the size of the sieve used to sift
the dust samples collected, and in storage temperature (SI Table

were reported in at least three data sets. Gray lines added after every five chemicals are intended to aid legibility. See Table 1 for identification of
abbreviations. See SI Table S3 for information on the studies from which data on each chemical was compiled. See SI Table S10 for the values plotted.

 S1). Analytical methods also differed across studies (SI Table
S2), as well as the statistical treatment of values below the limit of
detection (SI Table S4). Because sorption of organic compounds
to dust vary by particle size, the differences in sieve size used
between studies likely increased interstudy variation in measured
chemical concentrations.62,63 Indeed, we found that DBDPE
concentrations were significantly higher in dust sieved with >150
μm sieves, compared to samples sieved with ≤150 μm sieves. No
other RFRs or PFASs differed significantly by sieve size.
Additionally, because some previous research has suggested
that dust collected by a researcher may contain different chemical
concentrations than dust in a home vacuum bag,64 the
heterogeneity in dust collection method likely also added
variability to our sample.
Meta-Analysis. We identified 45 chemicals to include in the
meta-analysis (Figure 1, Table 1). Data collection sites spanned
14 states and tended to cluster around research universities,
particularly for RFRs (SI Figure S1). Therefore, the data may not
be nationally representative. Though dust was collected from a
variety of indoor environments including homes, schools,
daycare centers, cars, gymnasiums, and occupational settings,
nonresidential environments were less frequently sampled (SI
Figure S2). Chemicals and chemical classes also co-occurred in
dust: studies that reported sample-specific concentrations
consistently found multiple chemicals in each dust sam-
ple.36,65−67
The detection frequency of each chemical varied between
studies, sometimes widely, and did not seem to be solely due to
varying detection limits. However, of the 45 chemicals included
in the meta-analysis, 10 were detected in over 90% of samples (SI
Table S9), indicating that indoor dust contains a mixture of
chemicals, and that these particular consumer product chemicals
may be ubiquitous. Products or building materials found in
almost all indoor environments, such as cables/wires, electronics,
and upholstered furniture, may be sources of phthalates and
RFRs in a typical U.S. indoor environment.3,37,68
Phthalates were measured in the highest concentrations in
indoor dust, several orders of magnitude above the other
chemical classes. Phenols, RFRs, and fragrances were measured
in similar concentrations, while PFAS were measured in the
lowest concentrations (Figure 2; SI Table S10). The relative
ranking of chemical classes from highest to lowest according to
the maximum GM concentrations was phthalates, phenols,
RFRs, fragrances, and PFASs.
We compared concentrations of TDICPP, EH-TBB, BEH-
TEBP, PFOS, PFOA, PFNA between residential and nonres-
idential environments. TDCIPP and EH-TBB were significantly
higher in nonresidential than residential environments (p =
0.0043 and p = 0.026, respectively), while no differences were
found for the other chemicals (SI Table S11). The differences
noted for TDCIPP and EH-TBB were likely driven by very high
RFR levels in gym and fire station dust. However, no differences
by environment were found for BEH-TEBP, which is a
component of the Firemaster 550 mixture along with EH-TBB.
This is consistent with other studies that report ratios of EH-TBB
Figure 3. Top panel of the graph shows the estimated daily residential intake of each chemical for a 3−6 year old child (mg/kg/day), based on the pooled
GM concentrations of each chemical in dust from the meta-analysis. The bottom panel shows the proportion of intake from three pathways: ingestion,
inhalation, and dermal exposure from air. In both panels, PFAS intake estimates were based solely on estimated ingestion.

 and BEH-TEBP in dust differ from those in the commercial flame
retardant mixture.18,68,69
Intake Assessment. Intake estimates, like modeled GM
concentrations, spanned orders of magnitude (Figure 3). As
expected, estimated intakes, normalized by body weight, were
higher for the child compared to the adult, although the relative
ranking of the chemicals was similar (data not shown).
Those chemicals with the highest dust concentrations also
tended to have the highest intake estimates, with the exception of
the RFR TCEP, which was driven by its relatively high predicted
air concentration (>50 μg/m3). TCEP had the highest estimated
intake (>1 mg/kg/day) followed by four phthalates: DEP,
DEHP, BBzP, and DnBP (>0.1 mg/kg/day) (Figure 3).
Exposure to indoor air seemed to drive the intake estimates,
since those chemicals with the highest intake estimates also
tended to have the largest proportion of intake from inhalation
and dermal uptake of indoor air. These modeled results agree
with recent evidence of high inhalation exposure to chlorinated
RFRs.70 In contrast, for those chemicals where the dust ingestion
route dominated, the intake estimates were lower. Compared to
other classes, phthalates generally had the highest intake
estimates; RFRs’ intake estimates varied widely from approx-
imately 100 ng/kg-day for the Dechlorane isomers to >1 mg/kg-
day for TCEP; the fragrance HHCB ranked seventh of 44 in total
intake; phenols had midrange estimates; and PFASs, which only
rely on the dust ingestion route, had the lowest residential intake
estimates (Figure 3).
These residential intake estimates do not account for
exposures in microenvironments other than the home. While
the data on nonresidential environments were limited (SI Figure
S2), the data suggest that other indoor microenvironments will
contribute to total exposure. For example, concentrations of the
flame retardants TDCIPP and EH-TBB were higher in
nonresidential microenvironments (SI Table S11) and we
would expect that people spending substantial time in such
spaces would have higher exposures than the estimates presented
in Figure 3.
In addition to calculating the pooled GM and GSD, we
examined the maxima relative to the GM for representative
chemicals from four classes (TDCIPP, DEHP, MeP, PFOS) (SI
Figure S3). The maxima reported by each data set were, in many
cases, at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the reported
pooled GM. Thus, focusing only on the central tendency metric
could obscure the very high exposures, and potential associated
health risks, experienced by a fraction of the population.
We estimated residential intakes in order to provide context to
the pooled dust concentrations and link concentration and
hazard information. However, this intake assessment is not
comprehensive in that it does not quantify total intakes of every
chemical, does not account for variability in exposure factors
(e.g., dust ingestion rates), and relies on estimated physicochem-
ical data. In addition to the contribution of other microenviron-
ments on intake, for many of these chemicals, particularly the
phthalates and parabens, actual intakes may be much higher since
these chemicals are widely used in personal care products applied
directly to the skin,29 some medications;71 and diet has also been
shown to be an important route of exposure.72,73 Exposure
factors vary by individuals; for example, the upper percentile dust

 ingestion rate for children is 100 mg/day compared to the central
tendency of 60 mg/day used here, which may substantially
increase intake of chemicals in dust for some individuals.74
Finally, we relied on estimated physicochemical properties from
EPA’s EpiSuite, which provides one data source for all chemicals;
however, the algorithms used to estimate properties may vary in
accuracy across the chemicals of interest.38,39 Similarly, the
application of the partitioning model to estimate indoor air
concentrations may be less reliable for some chemicals since it
has not been fully validated across all of the chemicals of interest.
Hazard Identification. The authoritative body listings
aggregated in the SCP CC list (SI Table S7) identified nine
general hazard traits associated with the 35 chemicals that were
both included in the intake assessment and had SCP CC listings
(Figure 1). Reproductive toxicity, endocrine toxicity, devel-
opmental toxicity, and carcinogenicity were the most common
hazard traits (Figure 4). These hazard trait categorizations are
broad, but do identify chemicals within and across classes that
warrant further investigation for potential cumulative exposures
and impacts, as our analysis indicates that coexposure to multiple
chemicals is likely (SI Table S9). Previous studies have quantified
cumulative risk from a number of phthalates or PFASs, some of
which are included in the current study.16,75−77
This hazard identification approach and ranking by estimated
intake does not account for bioavailability, pharmacokinetics,
dose−response and other myriad factors that influence the
toxicity of chemicals. However, the ranking of chemicals by
intake estimate does point to chemicals with high intake
estimates that were associated with multiple hazard traits of
concern (DEP, BBzP, DEHP, DnBP, DiBP), suggesting that
these chemicals could be prioritized for exposure reduction.
Six chemicals (2,4-DHBZON, OP1EO, OP2EO, PFHxA,
PFBA, HHCB) were not found on the SCP CC list (Table 1),
which may reflect lack of data, rather than lack of hazard. A search
of ACToR (the Aggregated Computational Toxicology
Resource, a comprehensive database of in vivo and in vitro
chemical toxicity data from U.S. EPA78) reveals that while
multiple toxicity studies are available for HHCB, toxicity tests for
DHBZON, PFBA and PFHxA are limited to lethal dose and/or
in vitro studies, and no toxicity testing is reported for OP1EO
and OP2EO. A disadvantage of our use of the SCP CC list as the
sole source of hazard information is the limited information both
on emerging chemicals54,79 and the emerging toxicities of known
chemicals,80,81 due to the time needed to amass and assess
evidence before these are included in authoritative lists.
Recommendations for Indoor Dust Studies. While our
analysis represents one of the first attempts to aggregate data
across multiple studies for consumer product chemicals, it was
somewhat limited by heterogeneity of the available data sets, as
well as inconsistent or incomplete collection and/or reporting of
important information. We present the following recommenda-
tions to maximize the usefulness and comparability of future
empirical dust studies and advance the field of exposure science.
Dust Collection and Demographic Data. Future studies
should consider standardizing methods found to introduce
variability including dust sample collection method and sieve
size. To collect dust, we suggest following the standards set by
ASTM Standard Practice D5438: Standard Practice for
Collection of Floor Dust for Chemical Analysis.82 At the
minimum, we suggest that studies should collect fresh dust using
a vacuum cleaner with an extraction thimble in the crevice tool, as
opposed to sampling from used bags, to improve methodological
consistency and ensure thorough sampling. Because the optimal
sieve size might vary by chemical of interest, we do not
recommend a single sieve size for all studies. The two most
common sieve sizes in the studies we collected here were 150 μm
(12 studies) and 500 μm (10 studies). In the interest of
comparability with prior work, future studies should consider
using one of these sieve sizes.
Studies should also collect detailed demographic information
on the individuals occupying the indoor environments to enable
assessment of demographic factors that are associated with
chemical exposures in dust. For example, higher PBDE exposures
have been reported in California and in low-income
communities.83,84 This information is critical in shaping future
studies of exposure and health, and in providing an evidence base
for intervention development and public policy.
Reporting. Many studies included here did not report
descriptive information that could be used to pool findings or
compare across data sets. Future studies should report: the
month, year, and location of sample collection, central tendency
measures (e.g., median, GM), measurements of error (e.g., GSD,
95% CI), MDLs, frequencies of detection above the MDL,
maxima, CAS RNs for each chemical, and acronyms according to
established standards like those developed by Bergman et al.
2012.85 Because a chemical’s dust concentration may change
over time, studies should report summary statistics by sample
collection year for multiyear studies.
Indoor Environment and Geography. Most studies meas-
ured residential environments. Vehicles, workplaces, and other
indoor environments where people may spend many hours
should be an emphasis of future research. Moreover, important
insights could be gained by studying environments with high
chemical concentrations in dust, as well as people with elevated
exposures, since these studies could help characterize source
contributions to chemical exposures.86,87 Future studies should
also target dust sampling in less highly sampled regions of the
United States.
Study Design. Future studies should focus on better
characterizing emerging consumer product chemicals in the
phenol and fragrance classes which were the least studied.
Nontargeted analytical methods may provide a more accurate
picture of the true landscape of current consumer product
chemicals in dust. We were also not able to fully assess impacts of
changing product formulations on indoor dust, since most
studies were cross-sectional and only included one sample per
home. Longitudinal studies with repeated dust measures over
time are needed to detect changes in product formulation or use,
such as was seen with PBDEs and RFRs in Dodson et al., 2012.36
SVOC Dynamics Indoors. Our intake assessment is based on
current understanding of the dynamics of SVOCs in the indoor
environment, which is largely based on partitioning theory.38
Future studies should further validate these theoretical models
with empirical indoor air, dust, and surface measurements of a
range of chemicals. Moreover, partitioning models are most
appropriate for nonpolar chemicals and do not appear to apply to
chemicals like PFASs.60 Future research should investigate the
indoor dynamics of PFASs and similar chemicals to develop
accurate exposure models.
Broader Research Needs and Implications. Cumulative
exposures have more often been discussed in the context of
ambient outdoor pollution.88 Our results highlight the co-
occurrence of chemicals in the indoor environment that may
contribute to common adverse outcomes and thus advance the
rapidly emerging field of cumulative exposure assessment.
However, quantifying the health risks of chemical mixtures will

 also require new study designs and tools in toxicology, risk
assessment, and epidemiology.89 Our findings inform the next
generation of chemical mixture studies by highlighting chemicals
found at high concentrations indoors, identifying chemical
combinations that reflect typical indoor scenarios, and indicating
emerging chemicals of concern for biomonitoring.
We also know that pooling GMs across studies does not
adequately capture within-cohort subpopulations that may be
highly exposed. Based on the large difference between the
maxima and GMs presented here, we suggest that, consistent
with recommendations from the National Research Council, risk
assessments should quantitatively characterize exposure varia-
bility and include central tendency estimates as well as “worst
case” (maximum) scenarios.90 It is likely that some households
experience excess exposure due to shared exposure pathways
related to building characteristics, occupant behavior or other
modifiable factors.12 A full understanding of these household-
level drivers of high exposure is critical to the development of
mitigation strategies including regulatory interventions. How-
ever, when identifying compounds to remove from consumer
products, we also need to ensure that replacements are safer
alternatives in order to guard against “regrettable” substitutions
that may not reduce risk.91
We focused our analysis on indoor dust reservoirs, which
reflect long-term exposures that may be the best measure of
household exposure to SVOCs, given their partitioning between
indoor air, dust, and surfaces. This analysis does not, however,
consider other important exposure routes. For example, close
contact with flame-retarded products may result in inhalation
and dermal exposures that significantly contribute to total
exposure for the more volatile organophosphate RFRs.87,92
Biomonitoring data, combined with environmental measures,
could be used to further evaluate the contribution of indoor
exposures to total exposures.
In conclusion, this comprehensive analysis of consumer
product chemicals in U.S. indoor dust suggests that a wide
array of chemicals used in everyday products find their way into
indoor environments across the country where people, including
vulnerable subpopulations like children, are continuously
exposed. In this way, the indoor environment is a haven for
chemicals associated with reproductive and developmental
toxicity, endocrine disruption, cancer and other health effects.
Additionally, despite the observed variability across studies, the
existing dust literature has allowed us to identify the chemicals
and chemical classes found at the highest levels indoors
(phthalates and phenols), with the highest estimated intakes
(phthalates and RFRs), and associated with the most hazard
traits (phthalates and PFASs). These findings can be used to
improve population health by informing future exposure
assessment and epidemiologic studies of chemical mixtures as
well as individual and regulatory exposure reduction strategies.
