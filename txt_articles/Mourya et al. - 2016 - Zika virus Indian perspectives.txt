The emergence of Zika virus (ZiV), a mosquito borne Flavivirus like dengue (DEN) and chikungunya 
(CHIK), in Brazil in 2014 and its spread to various countries have led to a global health emergency. Aedes 
aegypti is the major vector for ZiV. Fast dissemination of this virus in different geographical areas posses 
a major threat especially to regions where the population lacks herd immunity against the ZiV and there 
is abundance of Aedes mosquitoes. In this review, we focus on current global scenario, epidemiology, 
biology, diagnostic challenges and remedial measures for ZiVconsidering the Indian perspective.

Introduction
 
Aedes mosquito borne diseases have become one 
of the major threats to human population. Zika virus 
infection is a mosquito-borne illness like dengue (DEN) 
and chikungunya (CHIK) viruses. A lot about the 
biology of vectors and its role in disease transmission is 
known but Aedes mosquito-borne infections continue 
to be the major cause of mortality in many subtropical 
and tropical countries. 
 
The introduction of any emerging infection and its 
rapid spread to other parts of the world draws global 
attention. The changing climate also results in a boom 
in vector population and their accelerated dispersal. 
The Aedes vector species borne infections like Zika are 
a potential threat, especially in urban settings where Ae. 
aegypti is abundant. The growing population in urban 
settings also increased the need for potable water, which 
necessitated storage practices in households, making 
ideal breeding habitats for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, 
that also increase dengue and CHIKV infections. Due 
to this mosquito-borne viral diseases are going to be 
a major threat in the 21st century. We present here an 
overview of Zika virus (ZiV) in the context to India.
 
Till today, in India its presence has not been 
reported, however, several points need to be addressed 
on a priority: (i) What is the risk for India, if it appears?; 
(ii) What is our capacity on preparedness in term of 
diagnostics and vaccine?; (iii) What is the preparedness 
keeping in mind about our existing health infrastructure 
and surveillance programme? [Wider surveillance in 
terms of human and vectors and bringing the Virus 
Research Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) component 
into the surveillance programme, is the need of today]; 
(iv) What can be added for the better surveillance in 
human and vectors and what are the specific research 
components needed?; (v) Evidence of ZiV infections 
in the mothers of children with microcephaly; and

(vi) What is the effective message to our scientific 
community on certain policy related issues? 
Historical perspective
 
ZiV was first isolated from a Rhesus monkey 
(Rhesus# 766) in the Zika Forest, Uganda, in April 
1947 during the Rockefeller Foundation’s initiative for 
research on yellow fever. This monkey was placed in 
a cage on a tree platform in the forest, and developed 
fever1. The serum of the same monkey was inoculated 
intracerebrally into mice and virus was isolated from 
the inoculated mouse brain after 10 days. The virus 
was later named as ZiV due to its origin in Zika forest. 
This virus was also isolated from the Ae. africanus 
mosquitoes trapped from the same forest in early 
19482. Studies based on serology first indicated that 
humans could also get infected which was proved by 
the first isolation from humans in 1952, in Tanzania and 
Uganda3. The presence of antibodies has been reported 
from Africa to Asia. The virus lived a ubiquitous life 
for decades in the narrow tropical and equatorial zones 
predominately sylvatic with arboreal Aedes mosquitoes 
as transmitting vector. Until 2007, the first documented 
large natural human infections/outbreak occurred in the 
Yap state of Micronesia followed by French Polynesia 
and Cambodia4. 
 
Since then this virus has been considered emergent 
as a few cases have been reported from the time 
including a major epidemic in French Polynesia (FP) 
in October 2013 (Direction de la santé, PF, 2013), and 
in New Caledonia in January 20145. In 2014, the virus 
started spreading eastward across the Pacific Ocean, 
to some part of French Polynesia and then to Easter 
Island. Presently, the ZiV outbreak has reached to 
a pandemic level after its spread to Mexico, Central 
America, the Caribbean and South Americas 5.
 
Interestingly, from a mild self-limiting febrile 
illness similar to dengue fever, the ZiV outbreak 
in French Polynesia presented with highly unusual 
clusters of Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, overall 
morbidity was still low with low/no mortality. In 2015 
Campos et al6 of the Federal University of Bahia, 
Salvador, reported detection of ZiV RNA in serum 
of patients (predominately females) with dengue-like 
illness in the background of dengue and CHIK virus 
infection in that region; the major clinical presentation 
in these cases being a maculoexantematic illness6. 
 
Subsequently, between May and November 2015 
approximately 1.3 million confirmed ZiV infections 
were reported from different parts of South America 
with 4000 cases of ZiV associated microcephaly7. 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC): rapid risk assessment mentioned that 
international travel played an important role in the 
dissemination of ZiV to newer niches (ecdc.europa.
eu/) and WHO sounded an international alert on ZiV8. 
Which factors played a role in the “split personality” 
of this rather ubiquitous virus from a benign eco-cycle 
towards threatening to become a global pandemic 
agent? The answers will take time to come. While 
full genome sequence analysis on limited isolates of 
the virus has not shown any dramatic “evolutionary” 
mutations, vector biology and disease pathogenesis of 
ZiVis far from being clear. 
 
The whole world is concerned over spread of 
ZiV virus in tropical and subtropical areas of many 
geographical regions of all continents for its possible 
association with clusters of birth and neurological 
conditions. The WHO declared a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern on January 
28, 2016, keeping in view the lesson learnt from the 
 
African Ebola outbreak9. Fast dissemination of this 
virus in different geographical areas is a major concern 
for non-endemic regions where the population does 
not possess herd immunity to ZiV virus and abundant 
presence of the vector Aedes mosquitoes. Till now the 
only report on the possible presence of ZiV in the Indian 
subcontinent is the detection of antibodies against 
ZiV(16.8% prevalence) mostly in the Bharuch district 
of the then Bombay State, Gujarat and Nagpur in 1954, 
which could be a result of cross-reactivity with other 
flaviviruses as dengue was found prevalent in these 
areas10. The major concern is that, once endemicity 
is established, ZiV can exist in its natural eco-cycle 
for a significant period with a potential to emerge as 
a pathogenic human agent. However, determinant 
complex factors are still poorly understood. In the 
absence of recent serological data from India or virus 
isolations, it is difficult to predict the impact of ZiV 
in India. Most people infected with ZiV do not show 
any pathogenomic/specific symptoms. Only, one in 
five people infected may develop a mild disease, with 
symptoms lasting from several days to a week. The 
most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain and 
conjunctivitis. 
The virus
 
ZiV is transmitted by arthropod vectors thus called 
arbovirus. This virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae. 
[Downloaded free from http://www.ijmr.org.in on Tuesday, January 24, 2017, IP: 121.121.113.137]
 It is placed under the genus Flavivirus and is closely 
related to yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, 
and West Nile viruses10. It also has a close relationship 
with Ilheus, Rocio and Saint Louis encephalitis 
viruses11-13. ZiV is an enveloped virus, having 
icosahedral symmetry and has a non-segmented, single 
stranded, positive sense RNA genome containing 
10,794 nucleotides encoding 3,419 amino acids. The 
virus can be inactivated by potassium permanganate, 
ether, and temperature >60°C but neutralization with 
10 per cent ethanol is not effective1.
Phylogeny
 
ZiV is one of the two viruses in the Spondweni 
virus clade and is very much similar to the Spondweni 
virus, which was first identified in South Africa12,13. 
Various sub-clades have been revealed by genomic 
comparisons indicating two major lineages, Asian and 
African14 and phylogenetic studies have shown that 
the virus spreading in the Americas is most closely 
related to the Asian strain, the same strain that has 
been circulating since the 2013 outbreak in French 
Polynesia14,15. ZiV complete genome sequence has been 
published16  and genetic analyses have revealed that ZiV 
has evolved into three distinct genotypes. Genetically, 
it was postulated that the virus originated in East 
Africa (East African or MR766 prototype cluster), and 
then spread to West Africa (West African or Nigerian 
cluster) and Asia (Asian genotype) approximately 
some 50-100 years ago17,18. Recent preliminary findings 
from sequences in the public domain have shown that 
increase in viral replication rate in humans may be due 
to a possible change in non-structural protein 1 (NS1) 
codon usage19.
The host range and transmission pattern
 
Human and non-human primates most likely serve 
as the main reservoirs for the virus but some authors 
have also reported anti-ZiV antibodies in various 
mammals (such as, Orang-outang, zebras, elephants, 
etc.) and rodents20,21. Human-vector-human cycle 
of transmission occurs during outbreaks, which are 
rare events where arboviruses become established 
as a cause of human disease, spread in a mosquito-
human-mosquito cycle, instead of enzootic mosquito-
monkey-mosquito cycle. ZiV is transmitted by Aedes 
mosquitoes, which are daytime active and aggressive 
biters. The virus has been isolated from Ae. aegypti, 
Ae.albopictus, Ae. africanus, Ae.apicoargenteus, Ae. 
furcifer, Ae. hensilli, Ae. luteocephalus and Ae. vitattus 
having extrinsic incubation period of about 10 days11. 
There are also some reports of sexual transmission of 
ZiV. The non-infected partner showed symptoms of 
ZiV infection and laboratory tests found ZiV antibodies 
in both the partners’ blood22-24. Detection of ZiV RNA 
in the amniotic fluid of foetuses and a possible link 
between ZiV fever and microcephaly in newborn 
babies25 indicate that it can cross the placenta and cause 
vertical transmission.
Epidemiology
 
The first isolation of virus from humans was carried 
out in 1952, in Uganda and in Tanzania1. In a study 
conducted in Nigeria in 1968 and during 1971-1975, 
ZiVwas also isolated from humans and in another study 
it was evident that 40 per cent of the tested persons had 
neutralizing antibody to ZiV26,27. From various studies 
viz., virological, serological and case reports of human 
ZiV infection, the virus was identified and reported 
from various other African countries (Uganda, Senegal, 
Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Gabon, Egypt, Tanzania, Sierra 
Leone, Central African Republic), Asian countries 
(Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, 
Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam), Pacific 
islands (Micronesia/Yap, FP, Cook islands and New 
Caledonia) and Oceania28. The outbreak on Yap Island 
in 2007 was evidence of ZiV illness that has been 
detected outside of Africa and Asia28.
Pathogenesis and clinical manifestation
 
Most of the flavivirus replication is thought to 
occur in cellular cytoplasm but perhaps it might not 
be the case with the ZiV as one of the studies detected 
antigens in infected cell nuclei29. Only a few facts are 
known about the ZiV pathogenesis but most of the 
mosquito-borne flaviviruses are thought to replicate 
initially in dendritic cells near the site of inoculation. 
The spread of virus takes place via lymph nodes and 
then through bloodstream30. Still there are insufficient 
data regarding incubation period and very limited data 
are available regarding its appearance in body fluids and 
the duration to which it persists in the body. ZiV can be 
detected as early as onset of the illness begins and even 
after 11 days of onset of illness in human blood31,32. In 
an experiment, even after nine days of experimental 
inoculation, virus was isolated from the serum of a 
monkey1. Symptoms of infection with the virus begin 
with mild headache followed by maculopapular rash 
(neck, face, trunk, and upper arms, and spread to 
palms and soles), fever, malaise, conjunctivitis and

 joint pains. Other manifestations include diarrhoea, 
constipation, abdominal pain, anorexia, dizziness and 
conjunctivitis. Rashes are not the consistent feature of 
this disease31. Some less frequent manifestations are 
myalgia, vomiting, oedema, and retro-orbital pain32. 
Only one in five persons develop symptoms with 
no fatalities and thus it is a relatively mild disease. 
Research has shown some link between ZiV fever and 
microcephaly in newborn babies by mother-to-child 
transmission25 and neurologic conditions in infected 
adults, including cases of the Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Current scenario of ZiV outbreaks
 
In October, 2013, a ZiV epidemic was reported for 
the first time by healthcare authorities, on the Society, 
Tuamotu, and Marquesas islands, which later spread to 
all the islands of the archipelagos33. From October 2013 
to February 14, 2014, about 10 per cent of the population 
consulted for a probable ZiV infection. This was the first 
time when such a large epidemic was reported and cases 
imported from FP were reported in New Caledonia, 
Japan, Norway, Easter Island and continental France. 
Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis were presented as the 
vectors of ZiV for this epidemic in an entomological 
study34. Forty patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome 
were diagnosed in three months among 72 severe cases 
with neurological symptoms35. The direct involvement 
of the ZiV leading to these severities of symptoms 
needs to be investigated. The first indigenous case of 
the Americas was found in February 2015, in Isla de 
Pascua (Chile). Since April 2015, a large outbreak 
of ZiV has spread across much of South and Central 
America and the Caribbean36. Then it began in Brazil 
and in May 2015, Pan American Health Organization 
confirmed the first 16 cases of ZiV infection36. On 
June 4, 2015, the first case of ZIV was presented in 
Dominican Republic37. In January 2016, a travel alert 
was issued by the CDC (U.S.) for people travelling to 
regions where ZiV was prevalent and suggested that 
women should consult with their physicians before 
travelling if they are thinking about becoming pregnant 
in near future38. Similar travel warnings are also issued 
from health agencies of different countries like Ireland, 
United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and the 
European Union. Health ministries of some countries 
like Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Jamaica 
have issued recommendation to avoid pregnancy for 
eight months. ZiV associated outcomes with infection 
during pregnancy are not yet fully understood and 
before giving any concluding remarks research in this 
particular direction has to go a long run. 
Diagnosis
 
The symptoms of ZiV are similar to those in case 
of dengue and chikungunya; therefore, the diagnostic 
molecular techniques are employed on the acute 
samples and serological tests are applied on samples 
5-6 days after onset of symptoms. Reverse transcription 
(RT)-PCR of acute-phase serum samples is the test of 
choice. It is evident that the viruria can last longer 
than viraemia and hence the RT-PCR based detection 
of viral RNA in patients’ urine samples could be an 
alternative method in case genetic material disappears 
from the serum11,30,39. An alternative to the RT-PCR is 
the “pan flavivirus” amplification technique combined 
with sequencing data11,18,40,41. Real time RT-PCR can 
also be very useful for diagnostic purpose32. 
 
Virus isolation from samples collected upto five 
days after the onset of symptoms can be beneficial. 
The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) by 
neutralizing antibody that appears as early as five days 
after onset of illness has greater specificity with respect 
to immunoassays, but the drawback is that it may give 
cross-reactive results in case of secondary flavivirus 
infections. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M to ZiV can be 
detected as early as three days after onset of illness by 
ELISA31. 
Issue of high cross-reactivity with dengue viruses
 
Cross-reactivity is a major problem and is 
frequently observed with dengue virus than with yellow 
fever, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), Japanese 
encephalitis or West Nile viruses. In this context, 
an investigation into the composition of envelope 
glycoprotein (E-protein) of ZiV with other flaviviruses 
may be necessary as E-protein is the main target for 
host antibodies.
 
Hitherto unpublished data from the authors’ 
laboratory reveal similarity between E protein of 
ZiV and dengue viruses. ZiV E-protein amino acid 
sequence has been compared (using bioinformatics 
tools) with those from other flaviviruses viz. dengue 
type 2 (DEN2), MVEV, Japanese encephalitis (JEV), 
West Nile (WNV), Kyasanur forest disease (KFDV), 
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), yellow fever (YFV) 
and St. Louis encephalitis (StLu). The results of pair-
wise comparison of all possible pairs of sequences (as 
obtained from ISHAN package)42 are summarized in 
Table I. It should be noted that among flaviviruses ZiV 
is closest to DEN2 with 54.2 per cent identity, and 81

per cent similarity, whereas it is least homologous to 
KFDV with 36.3 per cent identity and 67.2 per cent 
similarity. Comparison of ZiV E-protein with those 
from all serotypes of dengue virus revealed that ZiV 
was 46, 54.2, 55.3 and 54.2 per cent identical to 
DEN1, DEN2, DEN3 and DEN4, respectively in terms 
of amino acid composition (Table II). Phylogenetic 
analyses show that ZiV and DEN2 are most closely 
related as these appear in the same sub-cluster within 
the bigger clade formed by mosquito-borne flaviviruses 
 
(Fig. 1). E-proteins from Tick-borne flaviviruses 
formed a different cluster.
 
Analysis of the predicted B-cell epitopes43 
revealed 
the 
occurrence 
of 
three 
antigenic 
regions with >80 per cent identity of amino acid 
composition with dengue virus sequences. Of these, 
the 
epitope 
20-WVDVVLEHGGCVTVMAQ-36 
in 
ZiV 
corresponds 
to 
the 
epitope 
18-GSWVDIVLEHGSCVTT-33 in DEN2 and highly 
conserved in other dengue serotypes (unpublished 
observation 
from 
in 
silico 
results 
comparing 
dengue E protein sequences). This epitope occurs 
in domain I of 3D structure of flavivirus E-protein 
(DEN2, 
1OAN.pdb 
numbering)43. 
The 
epitope 
285-SSGHLKCRLKM-295 
in 
ZiV 
corresponds 
to the epitope 278-GNHMFAGHLKCKVRM-288 
in DEN2, and occurs in domain I extending 
towards the hinge region44, which connects the 
domain I with domain III (Fig. 2). The epitope 
104-GCGLFGKGSLVTCAKFACSK-123 
in 
ZiV 
corresponds to 104-CGLFGKGGIVTCAMFT-120 in 
DEN2 and is located in the domain II. The occurrence 
of these B-cell epitopes on ZiV having ≥80 per cent 
identity of composition with dengue virus may be the 
reason for the reported cross-reactivity in serological 
tests. In the natural dimeric arrangement of E-protein 
on viral membrane, these epitopes are exposed for 
interaction with host immune system.
 
Fig. 3 shows the flowchart for Zika diagnostic 
protocol as adapted by many countries45. 
Diagnostic RT-PCR for ZiV detection
 
Blood samples should be collected from febrile 
illness cases and must be tested for common viral 
diseases; DENV and CHIKV and then ZiV. Blood 
samples negative for DENV and CHIKV should be 
processed for detection of Zika virus aetiology. The 
early detection of ZiV cases in community would help 
for quicker prevention and control of the disease. The 
primary means of diagnosis is nucleic acid detection 
by RT-PCR targeting the non-structural protein 5 
 
(NS-5) genomic regions. Standard RT-PCR and 
quantitative RT-PCR usually provide a rapid, specific 
and sensitive method for early detection of ZiV.

ZiVRNA also has been detected in saliva or urine 
samples. However, it is recommended that the serum 
sample be taken during the first five days after the 
onset of symptom46.
Detection of IgM antibodies to ZiV by diagnostic 
ELISA
 
To date there are no commercially available 
kits (approved or validated) for the serological 
determination of ZiV. Further, it is a known fact that 
performing ELISA for Zika virus would be further 
challenging in countries like India due to endemicity 
of other flaviviruses like dengue, JE, WN and KFD. 
Virus isolation
 
Viral isolation is not regarded as a diagnostic 
tool and can be used only for supplemental research 
studies in public health surveillance. However, till 
date the prevalence of this virus in India has not been 
reported, therefore, it should be considered exotic 
and isolation procedures should be followed only in 
apex laboratories that are equipped with good high 
containment facilities.
Treatment and control
 
Presently there is no vaccine or antiviral drug 
available to combat the ZiV outbreak situation. 
Symptomatic treatment is rest, fluids (to prevent 
dehydration) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) to 
relieve fever and pain. If the patient has dengue virus 
infection also, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously because 
of the risk of bleeding/haemorrhages, hence, dengue 
should be ruled out before such medication47. 
 
Prevention and control relies on controlling 
mosquito population through effective removal of 
breeding sites and also reducing mosquito-human 
interactions. Reducing the breeding sites of Aedes 
mosquitoes is the best preventive public health measure. 
The other measures include use of insect repellent, use 
of physical barriers such as screens, sleeping under 
mosquito nets, wearing clothes that cover maximum

 parts of the body. Young children, sick, elderly and 
those who may not be able to protect themselves 
should be given special attention. Buckets, flowerpots 
or tyres that can hold water need cleaning or covering 
with suitable materials so that such places are not 
available for mosquito breeding. Doors and windows 
should remain closed for most of the time whenever 
there is an alert by the competent authority. Travellers 
and tourists should take the basic precautions to protect 
themselves from mosquito bites.
 
In India those States where dengue transmission is a 
major problem must be under vigilance. The guidelines 
for the integrated vector control should be released on 
vector surveillance and vector management. There 
must be provision for personal protection, biological 
and chemical control at household, community and 
institutional levels. Individuals, especially the pregnant 
women or women planning/attempting pregnancy 
should avoid travelling to the affected countries and in 
places where at present outbreak is in progress. Women 
must strictly follow individual protective measures to 
prevent mosquito bites like use of electronic mosquito 
repellents, mosquito repellent creams, use of bed nets 
and dress that covers most of the body parts. Persons 
with diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory illness, 
immune disorders, should seek advice prior to travel 
to an affected country. Persons having febrile illness 
within two weeks of return from an affected country 
should report to the nearest health facility so that 
suitable measures to combat the situation can be taken.
Vector biology of mosquitoes in relation to ZiV
 
ZiV is mainly transmitted by infected Ae. aegypti 
mosquitoes. Ae albopictus, a highly invasive mosquito, 
also has the potential to transmit the virus. Both the 
mosquitoes are highly prevalent in India and play a 
major role in the transmission of DENV and CHIKV. 
It is imperative to determine vector competence of 
Indian strains of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to 
ZiV in relation to DEN and CHIK viruses. Since the 
vector potential of these mosquito species to ZiV is 
not known, there is need of studies to determine the 
susceptibility, replication potential and different modes 
of transmission in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. If 
this virus emerges in India, the understanding of the 
phenomenon of transovarial transmission will give 
information about its possible maintenance in nature 
during non-mosquitogenic periods. India has known 
endemic areas for DEN and CHIK viruses that are 
also transmitted by these Aedes mosquito vectors, thus 
understanding the possible interaction on multiplication 
of ZiV, DENV and CHIKV in concomitantly infected 
vector mosquitoes is essential. There is a need to 
understand whether presence of ZiV may play any role 
in altering the susceptibility of these vector mosquitoes 
to other viruses (DEN and CHIK viruses).
Newborn screening for possible congenital ZiV 
infection
 
In Brazil, a precipitous surge in infants born with 
microcephaly and the detection of ZiV RNA in the 
amniotic fluid of affected newborns has been reported48. 
Identification of high-risk international pathways 
for the dispersion of ZiV and global geographies 
conducive to transmission49 is necessary. There have 
been many hypotheses about possible association of 
microcephaly6 due to this virus and Guillain Barré 
syndrome as well as contradictory hypothesis.
 
Considering 
the 
possibility 
of 
ZiV 
related 
congenital 
infection, it is important to evaluate neonates clinically 
presenting with suspected congenital infection, 
especially microcephaly. The testing algorithm for 
infants with possible congenital ZiV infection is given 
in Fig. 446,50. Obtaining blood samples from neonates 
is practically difficult and can cause complications 
like venous thrombosis and iatrogenic anaemia. 
Non-invasive sampling of saliva/urine ensures better 
compliance and larger volume of sample available 
for testing. Newborns presenting with microcephaly 
should be identified. Infants presenting, with neural 
tube defects and congenital cataract /ophthalmological 
findings should also be included. There are no data on 
birth prevalence of ZiV and its possible relation with 
congenital infection from India. In view of the present 
public health emergency, such data can provide vital 
information on this issue and help to understand the 
association, if any, of ZiV and congenital infection.
 
Zika virus disease has the potential for further 
international spread, since the potential mosquito vector 
Ae. aegypti has wide geographical distribution and due 
to lack of immunity (cross-reactive herd immunity) 
among population in newly affected areas. As of now, 
the disease is not reported in India but preparedness is 
required to identify ZiV aetiology among the reported 
febrile outbreaks/unusual rise of febrile syndrome 
cases in the community. 
 
The presence of ZiV in Senegal has been detected 
by RT-PCR in ten species of mosquitoes belonging to

the genus; Aedes, Mansonia, Anopheles and Culex51. 
However, it is difficult to say whether several species 
represented in above four genuses may act as vector. 
Mere presence of virus in a mosquito sample does 
not incriminate it as a vector. Laboratory experiments 
are required to prove that the mosquito species is able 
to acquire the pathogen through bloodmeal, virus 
propagates in the vector and after incubation period it 
gets transmited to other susceptible hosts. 
 
It is anticipated that international spread of ZiV 
from endemic to non-endemic areas is through air 
traffic. Studies based on mathematical modelling 
on Americas, estimated 3-4 million likely cases of 
ZiV infection (including asymptomatic cases) in the 
next 12 months52. Interestingly, same vector species 
involvement caused about two million dengue cases 
in the Americas in 2015, which were in circulation in 
the region since the 1980s)53. However, ZiV is another 
flavivirus and new to this region circulating at a very 
high intensity. This suggests that cross-reactive genus 
specific antibodies may not be effective to contain its 
spread in known dengue endemic areas.
 
Only a few complete genomes are available for 
ZiV. Recently, viral sequencing was done directly from 
the urine samples of four viraemic patients54. Complete 
coding of the ZiV sequence was obtained for one patient 
and envelope protein coding sequences for the three 
others. As reported earlier14, phylogenetic analyses

which showed the same topology. The Suriname 
strains belong to the Asian genotype and seem to be 
most closely related to the strain that was circulating in 
French Polynesia in 2013, with which they share more 
than 99.7 and 99.9 per cent identity14.
 
When any pathogen is recognized as emerging in 
any part of the world the alert is sent across the world 
and search begins to detect its presence in other areas. 
Today due to very high and fast movement of people 
across the world, this is considered as main route of 
spread of emerging infection. However, there is always 
a possibility that the infection might have reached to a 
certain country/region long back but remained 
unnoticed. 
Due to recent notification if detected in such areas, it 
is considered as newly spread to this region. Majority 
of emerging infections are either result of mutation(s) 
(mutation, shift or/and drift kind of situations) or recent 
recognition as part of improved/newly added part of 
surveillance system. These infections might have been 
existing in such areas but recognized recently.

 Emerging arboviruses in India
 
In India, Chandipura virus (CHPV) was first 
recognized in 1950s in central parts of India, but later 
recognized as a disease of public health importance in 
2000. CHPV is a Rhabdovirus, that caused febrile illness 
in humans in 1965, has emerged as an encephalitis-
causing virus with a high case fatality rate in children in 
Central India during 2003-200455. Similarly, Crimean-
Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was a known 
infection in a large part of the world but its presence 
was identified in 2011 and follow up studies showed 
that it existed in India since a long time56. Similarly, 
Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) was considered to be 
restricted only to five districts of Karnataka State in 
India, but with the availability of newer molecular and 
serological assays and awareness among the health 
personnel the presence of this disease was recognized 
in many States in India56-58.
 
Therefore, with such examples from the history 
for arboviruses it is difficult to predict with certainty, 
what would happen if ZiV virus is introduced into a 
new region and new ecosystem. No antiviral or vaccine 
is available for this viral infection. Thus, option for 
control is only the management of mosquitoes, which 
currently relies on either insecticides or the destruction 
of larval breeding sites. 
Conclusion and recommendations
 
Though the presence of Zika virus has not been 
detected yet in India and serious mortality and 
morbidity is also not associated with this virus but 
the possible association of this virus infection with 
microcephaly and other neurological symptoms is 
revealed. Therefore, the preparedness for Zika virus 
has to be there in our country. This disease has been 
notified recently internationally and requires very 
rigorous surveillance programme including detection 
of ZiV in vector mosquitoes.
