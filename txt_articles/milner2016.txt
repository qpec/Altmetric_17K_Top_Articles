The known The risk of suicide may be higher for medical
practitioners and nurses than for those in other occupations.
This problem had not been assessed at a national level
or by sex.
The new Age-standardised rates of suicide were higher for
female medical practitioners, and for male and female nurses,
than for other occupations. The rate of suicide for health
professionals with access to prescription medicines was
higher than for health professionals without ready access
to these means.
The implications Suicide prevention initiatives should focus
on workplace factors and differential risks for men and
women employed as health professionals.
I
n general, health professionals are healthier and live longer
than the general population.1 However, research has identi-
fied elevated rates of suicidal ideation and death by suicide
among certain groups of health professionals, including doctors,
nurses and dentists.2-4
Suicides by health professionals typically have two distinguish-
ing features. First, they are more likely to involve poisoning5-7
than methods such as hanging, which is more common in the
general population.8 Second, women working in health pro-
fessions appear to be at particular risk; whereas in the general
population the rate of suicide for men is nearly four times as high
as that for women,8 the rates of suicide among female health
professionals are comparable with those of their male peers.2-4
These two findings may be related, as the lethality of self-
poisoning increases with access to prescription medicines, and
women are more likely than men to choose poisoning as the
method of suicide. Other possible explanations for the elevated
rates of suicide among female health professionals include
greater exposure to work-related stressors.9
Australian research on suicide by health professionals has been
restricted to Queensland;6 there are no published analyses at the
national level. Further, research has been restricted to studying
doctors and nurses, with a notable lack of published data on the
burden of suicide in other health care professions in Australia. A
better understanding of whether suicide rates are elevated for all
health professionals, or for medical professionals specifically,
would assist efforts to prevent suicide. We therefore used a na-
tional register of occupationally coded suicide cases to determine
the rates of suicide by health professionals in Australia and the
suicide methods used, and to compare these with data for sui-
cides by people in other occupations. We also assessed whether
suicide rates for female health professionals were higher than for
their male colleagues.
Methods
Study design
We conducted a nationwide study of deaths by suicide between
2001 and 2012. The study included all employed adults with a
known occupation who were at least 20 years old at the time of their
death.
Ascertainment of suicide deaths. We identified suicide cases
using the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). The NCIS
is an internet-based data storage and retrieval system that enables
coroners, government agencies, and researchers to monitor
external causes of death in Australia and to identify cases for
further investigation and analysis. The NCIS provides basic de-
mographic information, as well as employment status and occu-
pation at the time of death as recorded in coronial files.
The quality and completeness of NCIS data vary between cases,
particularly for the early years of the scheme (the system was
Abstract
Objectives: To report age-standardised rates and methods of
suicide by health professionals, and to compare these with
suicide rates for other occupations.
Study design: Retrospective mortality study.
Setting, participants: All intentional self-harm cases recorded
by the National Coronial Information System during the period
2001e2012 were initially included. Cases were excluded if the
person was unemployed at the time of death, if their
employment status was unknown or occupational information
was missing, or if they were under 20 years of age at the time of
death. Suicide rates were calculated using Australian Bureau
of Statistics population-level data from the 2006 census.
Main outcome measures: Suicide rates and method of suicide
by occupational group.
Results: Suicide rates for female health professionals were
higher than for women in other occupations (medical
practitioners: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.55e4.09;
P < 0.001; nurses and midwives: IRR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.22e3.15;
P < 0.001). Suicide rates for male medical practitioners were not
significantly higher than for other occupations, but the suicide
rate for male nurses and midwives was significantly higher than
for men working outside the health professions (IRR, 1.50;
95% CI 1.12e2.01; P ¼ 0.006). The suicide rate for health
professionals with ready access to prescription medications
was higher than for those in health professions without such
access or in non-health professional occupations. The most
frequent method of suicide used by health professionals was
self-poisoning.
Conclusion: Our results indicate the need for targeted
prevention of suicide by health professionals.

 launched in 2000), and suicide may be under-reported because of
legislative and professional differences between states and be-
tween coroners.10 In addition, there is a significant lag between
deaths and their recording in the NCIS caused by the duration of
the coronial process, meaning that 2012 was the most recent com-
plete year with full available data for inclusion in our study.
Nevertheless, the NCIS offers the best available information on
suicide mortality in Australia, and is used as the basis for compiling
the official death statistics published by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS).
We classified suicide methods according to the International
Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10), codes X60eX84.11
We were unable to code the method of suicide for 5.4% of cases.
Ascertainment of occupational groups. Our study only included
persons employed in a known occupation at the time of death.
Occupational information was coded according to the Australian
and
New
Zealand
Standard
Classification
of
Occupations
(ANZSCO) to the four digit level.12 Information on the coding
procedure we used is included in Appendix 1.
We divided occupations into two broad groups: healthprofessions,
and all other occupations. “Health professions” included all health
care-related occupations classified by ANZSCO as professions,
based on the educational requirements and skills required for the
job (ANZSCO codes 25xx and 2723). It did not include health care
workers who are classified as community and personal service
workers (code 1220), such as paramedics and Indigenous health
workers. We analysed data for three health profession groups:
medical practitioners (code 253x), midwifery and nursing pro-
fessionals (code 254x), and other health professions, which
included health diagnostic and promotion professions (codes 251x
and 252x; such as pharmacists and optometrists), therapy pro-
fessions (code 252x; such as physiotherapists and occupational
therapists), and psychologists (code 2723). The “other occupa-
tions” category included all people employed in any other occu-
pation at the time of death.
Ascertainment of population size. We extracted ABS 2006 census
data (the midpoint of our study) on the size of the population aged
20e70 years, by age, sex and occupation, using TableBuilder (http:/
/
www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/tablebuilder?
opendocument&navpos¼240). Age was coded into 10-year bands;
ANZSCO codes were used for occupation.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis and age-standardised suicide rates. We
report the age and sex of individuals in the four occupational
groups: medical practitioners, nurses and midwives, other health
professions, and all other occupations. We also report the suicide
methods used by members of these groups. Suicide rates per
100 000 person-years were calculated for each of the four groups,
stratified by sex. These rates were age-standardised to the
Australian standard population (2001),13 restricting the standard
population to those aged 20e70 years (the range of ages at death for
the analysed health professionals).
Regression models. We compared the rates of suicide for the four
occupational groups in negative binomial regression models. We
used the “other occupations” group as the reference category, and
the model was controlled for year of death, age and sex. We initially
tested for effect modification by sex by including an interaction
term in the model; as there was strong evidence of effect modifi-
cation, in this article we report models stratified by sex.
We then assessed the influence of occupational access to pre-
scription medicines by comparing suicide rates among health
professionals who have ready access to prescription medicines in
the course of their work with those for health professionals who
do not. We defined health care professions with access to these
lethal means as registered professions whose members are
legally allowed to prescribe, supply or administer prescription
medicines.
This
includes
doctors,
nurses
and
midwives,
dental practitioners and pharmacists (Appendix 1). We did
not include optometrists and podiatrists, although some practi-
tioners in these professions are permitted to prescribe certain
medicines. We assumed that sex would not be an interacting
factor, as male and female health professionals would have the
same level of knowledge about and access to prescription
medicines.
For all models, coefficients were transformed to incidence rate
ratios (IRRs) to aid interpretation. Analysis was undertaken in
Stata 13.1 (StataCorp).
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Deakin University Human
Research Ethics Committee (reference, 2015-278) and the Justice
Human Research Ethics Committee (reference, CF/15/13534).
Results
We identified 9828 suicides in Australia during the 12-year study
period by employed adults aged 20e70 years, including 369
(3.8% of all suicides) by health professionals (Box 1). The age-
standardised rate of suicide for male medical practitioners was
14.8 per 100 000 person-years, and 22.7 per 100 000 person-years for
male nurses and midwives; the rate for men in other (non-health
care) occupations was 14.9 per 100 000 person-years. The age-
standardised rate of suicide among female health professionals
was 6.4 per 100 000 person-years for medical practitioners, 8.2 per
100 000 person-years for midwives and nurses, and 4.5 per 100 000
person-years for other health professionals; this compares with 2.8
per 100 000 person-years for women in other occupations. Crude
suicide rates by occupational group and sex are summarised in
Appendix 2.
Hanging as the method of suicide was much less common among
doctors (24%) and nurses and midwives (28%) than among other
health professionals (43%) and those in other occupations (48%)
(Box 2). Practitioners in these groups used self-poisoning (doctors,
51%; nurses and midwives, 40%) more often than did members of
other occupations (10%).
A significant interaction between sex and occupation with respect
to suicide rate was detected (c2 test, P < 0.001), so models stratified
by sex were calculated. After adjusting for year and age, we found a
significantly higher suicide rate for men employed as nurses and
midwives than for men in occupations other than health
professions (IRR, 1.50; P ¼ 0.006) (Box 3). The suicide rate for male
“other health professionals” was slightly lower than for men
employed in non-health care occupations (IRR, 0.75; P ¼ 0.061). For
women, being employed as a doctor (IRR, 2.52; P < 0.001) or as a
nurse or midwife (IRR, 2.65; P < 0.001) was associated with
significantly higher suicide rates than for women in non-health
care occupations.
The rate of suicide among health professionals with ready access to
prescription medicines was 1.62 times that for health professionals
without this access (P < 0.001) (Box 4).

 Discussion
In this national study of suicide in Australia, we found impor-
tant sex differences between health professionals and other
occupational groups in the epidemiology of suicide. The rate of
suicide among women employed in any health profession was
higher than for women in other occupations; the difference was
statistically significant for women employed as nurses or medical
practitioners. Compared with that for men in other occupations,
the suicide rate was higher only among male health professionals

 in the fields of nursing and midwifery. Further, the rate of suicide
was 62% higher among health professionals with ready access to
prescription medicines than among health professionals without
such access. Our findings also suggest that suicide rates across the
entire working population have decreased slightly over time, and
that suicide rates are lower among older working people
(those over 50 years of age) than among younger working people
(20e39 years of age) (Box 3, Box 4).
Sex-related stressors
Almost 15 years ago, Hawton and colleagues14 speculated that the
rate of suicide by female health professionals would decline as more
women entered the medical professions. Unfortunately, rates have
not declined, despite the increasing number of women in these
professions. It has been suggested that women working in male-
dominated areas of medicine face a number of barriers that hinder
their career advancement.15,16 In addition, female professionals may
still feel pressure to undertake child care and household roles,
leading to considerable gender role stress. This premise has been
supported by studies in which young female doctors reported
considerablepressureassociatedwithcombiningworkandfamily.17
Occupational gender norms may also play a role in explaining the
high suicide rate among male nurses and midwives. These occupa-
tions are organised to reinforce traditionally feminine behaviours of
caring and support. Qualitative research has found that some male
nursesexperienceanxietyabouttheperceivedstigmaassociatedwith
their non-traditional career choice.18 These anxieties may constitute a
risk factor for suicide for men in these occupations.
Work-related stressors
There is strong evidence that doctors experience a considerable
number of psychosocial job stresses, including workefamily con-
flict,19 long working hours, high job demands, and the fear of
making mistakes at work.20 These psychosocial job stressors have
been associated with common mental disorders (anxiety and
depression) in several prospective cohort studies.21 Those working
in caring professions, including nursing, may be particularly
exposed to trauma, and they may also experience it vicariously
through contact with patients and their families. Further, many
health professionals operate their own businesses and may thus
experience the stress of being sole operators.22
Suicide by self-poisoning
We found strong evidence of higher rates of suicide by self-
poisoning among health professionals than by people in other
occupations. We also found a higher rate of suicide for health
professionals with ready access to prescription medicines than for
health professionals without such access. These findings are
consistent with those of several other studies. For example,
a national study based on Danish population registers found dif-
ferences in the use of medicinal drugs for deliberate fatal over-
doses. Compared with teachers, who employed them in 22% of
suicides, medicinal drugs were used far more frequently by nurses
(55%), doctors (56%) and pharmacists (66%).2 An analysis of the
Queensland suicide register found that poisoning was used more
often by medical professionals (59% of suicides) and nurses (44%)
than by education professionals (24%) and other groups (19%).6 A
recent review of nine studies of suicide by nurses concluded that
medication poisoning was the predominant method used for tak-
ing their own lives.5 Similarly, pharmacists employed poisoning as
a suicide method more often than other employed people.7 It thus
appears likely that access to prescription medicines as a lethal
means is a risk factor in suicide by health professionals.
Limitations of our study
Major strengths of the study include the use of the best available
individual-level data on suicide in Australia, the inclusion of
multiple health care professions, and coverage of an entire national
population over a 12-year period. We note, however, a number of
limitations. First, under-reporting of suicide in the NCIS because of
misclassification of the cause of death is a problem, as in any official
record of deaths.10 Second, our study only included people who
were employed at the time of death, so that health professionals
who had stopped working because of illness, who were suspended
from medical practice or de-registered, or who had retired were not
included in our analysis. In addition, occupation may have been
miscoded by police when collecting information, or during the
coding process, despite independent coding by two researchers
and the use of a structured approach to classification. Third, data
on the method of suicide is incomplete, as initial data collection
from the NCIS did not include this information. We have subse-
quently obtained these data for most suicides, but were unable to
match suicide method for a small proportion of cases. Fourth, we
note that the ANZSCO list of health professions is not perfectly
aligned with the occupations regulated as health professions under
the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for health
practitioners. For example, dental hygienists are a registered health
profession, but are not listed as a health profession by ANZSCO;
nutrition professionals are not a registered health profession, but
are listed as such by ANZSCO.
The suicide rates for men in several of the jobs classified as “other
occupations” (the denominator for our risk estimation) were
particularly high, including men employed in lower skilled
occupations and in technical and trade occupations.23 This
circumstance will have affected the results of our analysis, as it
will have reduced the calculated IRR when comparing suicide
rates in male health professionals with those in other occupa-
tions. We did not have sufficient data to analyse suicide rates
within specific medical specialties, such as anaesthesia, or within
smaller health professions, such as dentistry. We cannot exclude
the possibility that men working in these occupations may be at
increased risk of suicide. Finally, we acknowledge the different
age structures of the population of those in medical professions
and of the standard Australian population; those employed in
health professions were substantially older.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the rate of suicide among women
employed in a range of health professions, including medicine, is
markedly higher than that for women in other, non-health care
occupations. An understanding of the specific stressors and risk
factors experienced by women in these professions may shed
additional light on targeted prevention strategies. Attention
should also be given to the high rate of suicide among men,
including those employed in health care. Strategies targeted at
health professionals should also pay heed to the higher rate of
suicide among professionals with access to prescription medicines.
