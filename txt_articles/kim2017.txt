Prospective Feasibility Study
for Using Cell-Free Circulating
Tumor DNA–Guided Therapy in
Refractory Metastatic Solid Cancers:
An Interim Analysis
abstract
Purpose Retrospective studies have demonstrated that cell-free circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA)hotspottestingpredictsmatchedtherapyresponsetofirst-andsecond-linetherapiesin
patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, no prospective out-
comes studies have evaluated ctDNA-guided matched therapy decision making on the basis of
comprehensive plasma genomic testing including all four major classes of alterations. Here, we
report the clinical utility of this approach in advanced solid tumor cancers.
Patients and Methods We conducted a multiple parallel cohort, open-label, clinical trial using
ctDNA-guided matched therapy when tissue was insufficient or unobtainable for next-generation
sequencing. Plasma-based digital sequencing identified point mutations in 70 genes and indels,
fusions, and copy number amplifications in selected genes. Patients with prespecified targetable
alterations in metastatic NSCLC, gastric cancer (GC), and other cancers were matched to several
independent targeted agent trials at a tertiary academic center.
Results Somatic alterations were detected in 59 patients with GC (78%), and 25 patients (33%)
had targetable alterations (ERBB2, n = 11; MET, n = 5; FGFR2, n = 3; PIK3CA, n = 6). In NSCLC,
62patients (85%)had somaticalterations, and 34(47%) had targetablealterations (EGFR,n =29;
ALK, n = 2; RET, n = 1; ERBB2, n = 2). After confirmation of ctDNA findings on tissue (to meet
trial eligibility criteria), 10 patients with GC and 17 patients with NSCLC received molecularly
matched therapy. Response rate and disease control rate were 67% and 100%, respectively, in
GC and 87% and 100%, respectively, in NSCLC. Response was independent of targeted al-
teration variant allele fraction in NSCLC (P = .63).
Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first prospective feasibility study of comprehensive
ctDNA-guided treatment in advanced GC and lung cancers. Response rates in this interim
analysis are similar to those in tissue-based targeted therapy studies.

INTRODUCTION
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines recommend genotyping in seven solid
tumor cancers (non–small-cell lung cancer
[NSCLC], breast, gastric, esophageal, colorectal,
melanoma, and GI stromal tumors) for 11 geno-
mic targets (GTs) to inform targeted therapy
selection.1-6 However, biopsy specimens can be
inadequate for comprehensive profiling in 25%
to 50% of patients,7-10 leading to incomplete
genotyping or repeat invasive biopsy to obtain
more tissue. Repeat biopsy is also recommended
at progression in patients with breast cancer and
NSCLC to capture targetable genomic changes
such as ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 [HER2]) copy number amplification
(CNA) or EGFR and ALK resistance mutations,
respectively.4,5,11

 and CNA may obviate the need for repeat invasive
biopsies for genotyping when tissue is of insuffi-
cient quantity or unobtainable at initial diagnosis
or at progression.12,13 In general, next-generation
sequencing (NGS) seems to detect more action-
able variants in target genes than non-NGS
methods (hotspot testing) such as polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry
(IHC), or fluorescence in situ hybridization.14-18
Beyond the benefits of invasive biopsy avoid-
ance and higher sensitivity compared with non-
NGS methods, comprehensive ctDNA NGS
may provide a global summary of multiple le-
sions, whereas tissue genotyping of small bi-
opsies may fail to capture intra- and intertumor
heterogeneity.19-21
Retrospective studies in NSCLC using ctDNA
genotyping for EGFR mutations in the first-
line (EGFRL858R/exon19del)22 and second-line
(EGFRT790M)23,24 settings have produced re-
sponseratessimilartostudiesoftherapiesdirected
by tissue-based genotyping. A small study of
ctDNA-identified ERBB2 (HER2) CNA in met-
astatic breast cancer found an 86% response rate
to anti-HER2 treatment.25 No prospective out-
comes studies have evaluated comprehensive
ctDNA NGS testing for all four types of genomic
alterations to guide matched therapy decision
making in patients with advanced solid cancers.
Previously, we conducted a prospective external
validation study (Next-Generation Personalized
Therapy With Plasma DNA Genomics Trial
[NEXT]-1)ofa54-genectDNANGStest(Guar-
dant360; Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA),
finding 86% concordance between pretreated
matched plasma and tissue samples in multiple
advanced solid tumor cancer types.26 Now ex-

that this comprehensive ctDNA digital sequenc-
ing test could effectively guide targeted therapy in
patients with metastatic NSCLC, gastric cancer
(GC), and other cancers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Treatment
The NEXT-2 trial in refractory solid tumors
(ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier:
NCT02140463)
consists of several matched therapy protocols
(phases II to IV; Appendix Fig A1) aligned to
the institutional review board–approved NEXT-
2 master protocol at a single center (Samsung
MedicalCenter,SungkyunkwanUniversitySchool
of Medicine, Seoul) in the Republic of Korea.
PrespecifiedGTsincludedAKT1,PTEN,PIK3CA,
and BRAF mutations; EGFR, KIT, and ERBB2
(HER2) mutations or CNA; FGFR2 CNA; and
fusions in ROS1, ALK, or NTRK1 (Appendix Fig
A1). The study was conducted in accordance with
the current ethical principles outlined in the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice
guidelines.
Patients
Eligible patients were older than age 20 years with
histologically confirmed metastatic cancer, who
had sufficient tumor tissue to test cancer-specific
biomarkers but not to undergo comprehensive
genomic profiling (NGS). Cancer-specific bio-
markertestingincludedHER2IHCinGC,EGFR
mutationsbyhotspotsequencingandALKIHCin
NSCLC, and BRAFV600E digital PCR in mela-
noma. Patients had radiologically evaluable dis-
ease, adequate organ function, life expectancy
> 3 months from proposed first dose date, and
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perfor-
mance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 3. Patients with
doubleprimarycancerswereexcluded(exceptfor
any cancer in remission for . 5 years, in situ
cervicalorbasalcellcancer, oranyresectedinsitu
cancers).
End Points and Assessments
The study primary and secondary end points were
progression-free survival and objective response
rate (RR), respectively. This prespecified in-
terim analysis is limited to objective response for
patients receiving ctDNA-directed matched ther-
apies. RR and disease control rate (DCR = RR +
stable disease) were centrally adjudicated in
accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.28
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for demo-
graphics, ctDNA alteration detection rate, and
substudy matching. CIs for proportions were re-
ported using Wilson’s score interval with conti-
nuity correction. Associations between RECIST
1.1 treatment response and targeted alteration
variant allele fraction (VAF), ECOG PS, and line
of therapy were assessed using linear regression,
t test, and analysis of variance, respectively.
Comprehensive Genomic Testing in Plasma
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from
whole blood collected in 10-mL Streck tubes.
Samples were shipped to a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Act–certified, College of American
Pathologists–accredited laboratory (Guardant

 Health). After double ultracentrifugation, 5 to
30ngofcfDNAwasisolatedfordigitalsequencing
as previously described.12,26,29 All exons in 30
genes and critical exons (those known to harbor
somatic mutations) of 40 genes were completely
sequenced. Sequencing datawere analyzed usinga
custom bioinformatics pipeline to identify single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 70 genes (150-kb
panel footprint), CNAs in18 genes, indels in three
genes (EGFR and ERBB2 exons 19 and 20; MET
exon 14), and ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK1, FGFR2,
andFGFR3fusions(AppendixFigA2).Targetable
ctDNA-detected GTs were confirmed via tissue
testing.
All cfDNA fragments, both leukocyte and tumor
derived, were simultaneously sequenced. The
VAF was calculated as the proportion of cfDNA
harboringthevariantinabackgroundofwild-type
cfDNA. The analytic sensitivity reaches detection
of one to two mutant fragments in a 10-mL blood
sample (0.1% limit of detection) with analytic
specificity . 99.9999%.12 CNAs were reported
as the absolute gene copy number in plasma.
Because most cfDNA is leukocyte derived, the
gene copy number is generally2.0. Tumor-derived
DNAshedintothebloodstreamincreasesthisvalue
but, as a result of the relative proportions of tumor-
derived versus leukocyte-derived cfDNA, is
typically a minor contributor. Gene copy num-
ber in plasma is thus a function of both copy
number in tissue and the degree to which tumor
DNA is shed into circulation. Plasma copy num-
ber of 2.5 to 4.0 is reported as ++ amplification
and copy number . 4.0 as +++ amplification,
representing the 50th to 90th and . 90th per-
centiles, respectively, of all CNA calls in the
Guardant360 database.
RESULTS
Patient Enrollment and Demographics
From August 2014 to February 2016, informed
consent was obtained from 210 consecutive pa-
tients with metastatic cancer whose tissue was
available for cancer-specific biomarker testing,
but insufficient for NGS, at initial diagnosis or
at progression. Sixteen patients were lost to
follow-up or withdrew consent, leaving 194 pa-
tients molecularly profiled by ctDNA NGS (Ap-
pendix Fig A3).
Median age was 60 years (range, 28 to 78 years) for
NSCLC and 57 years (range, 23 to 82 years) for
GC, melanoma, and other cancers; 43%, 58%,
56%, and 89% of patients with these cancers were
male, respectively (Table 1). All patients were
from Korea, and the majority (85%) had an
ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Newly diagnosed (first-
line) patients composed 29% of patients with
NSCLC, 37% of those with GC, 68% of those
with melanoma, and 11% of those with other

the setting of second-line or greater therapy.
Targetable Alterations and Therapy
Matching
ctDNA alterations were detected in 78% of pa-
tients with GC (59 of 76 patients), and 33% (25 of
76 patients) had a prespecified GT (Table 2; Ap-
pendix Fig A1), as follows: 11 (19%) had ERBB2
(HER2) CNA (split between at initial diagnosis
and at progression [second line or higher]); five
(8%) had MET CNA (all but one at progression);
three (4%) had FGFR2 CNA (all at progression);
and six had point mutations in PIK3CA (split
between at initial diagnosis and at progression).
As shown in Figure 1, the overall distribution of
genomic alterations was similar between tumor
tissue sequencing results from The Cancer Ge-
nome Atlas and ctDNA sequencing in this cohort
with GC.
ctDNA alterations were detected in 85% of pa-
tients with NSCLC (62 of 73 patients), with
prespecified GTs (Table 3; Appendix Fig A1) in
47% of patients (34 of 73 patients), as follows: 29
patients had canonical EGFR driver mutations
(exon 19 deletions or SNVs in codons 858, 719,
and 861), constituting one third of the newly
diagnosed patients and half of the patients evalu-
ated at second line or greater; EGFRT790M muta-
tions were found in 17 patients, all at progression;
two patients had EML4-ALK fusions; one patient
had KIF5B-RET fusion; and two patients had
ERBB2
insertions
(G776
DelinsVC
and
G778_P780Dup). ERBB2 (HER2) CNA was
identified in two patients at progression (one
co-occurring with EGFRT790M and one with the
ERBB2 G778_P780Dup),andMETwasamplified
in four patients at progression (one with ERBB2
insertion and three with EGFRT790M). However,
CNAs in NSCLC were not prespecified GTs.
On the basis of rolling substudy availability, in-
clusion criteria, and patient comorbidities, 10
(40%) of the 25 patients with GC (ERBB2, n = 6;
MET, n = 1; FGFR2, n = 1; and PIK3CA, n = 2)
and 17 (50%) of the 34 patients with NSCLC
(EGFR, n = 7; EGFRT790M, n = 7; and ALK, n = 1)
with prespecified GTs were matched to a molec-
ularly targeted therapy (Tables 2 and 3). Tissue
testing was conducted as required by the eligibility
criteria for each matched therapy protocol. One
patient with GC and two patients with NSCLC
were losttofollow-up,leaving ninepatients (90%)
and 15 patients (88%) evaluable for response,
respectively.
ctDNA-Guidable Targeted Therapies and
Response by Cancer Type
In GC, CNAs in ERBB2 (n = 5), FGFR2 (n = 1),
and MET (n = 1) and SNVs in PIK3CA (n = 2)
were targeted with one patient achieving com-
plete response (CR), five partial response (PR),
and three stable disease (SD) for an RR of 67%
(95% CI, 31% to 91%) and DCR of 100% (95%
CI, 63% to 100%; Table 4, Fig 2A). The

 absolute copy number in plasma for all focal
amplifications was . 4.0 (+++), with two excep-
tions at 3.92 and 2.55 (++), the former with SD
and the latter with PR (Fig 2A). One patient with
ctDNA-detected ERBB2 (HER2) amplification
(+++) achieved complete remission after six cy-
cles of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and lapatinib
(Fig 2B).
In NSCLC, EGFRexon19del (n = 5), EGFRL858R
(n = 2), EGFRT790M (n = 7), and ALK fusion
(n = 1) were targeted, with 13 patients achieving
PR and two SD for a RR of 87% (95% CI, 58%
to 98%) and a DCR of 100% (95% CI, 75% to
100%; Table 4, Fig 2C). The patient with an
ALK fusion treated with crizotinib achieved a
significant 65% response in the target lesion. Of
the seven patients receiving first-line epidermal
growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRi), six
achieved PR on afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib,
whereas the one patient with SD received
rociletinib. Similarly, six EGFRT790M patients
achieving PR were treated with osimertinib or
olmutinib, whereas the patient with SD was
treated with afatinib plus insulin-like growth
factor ligand monoclonal antibody. The tar-
geted alteration VAF ranged from 0.07% to
40.6% ctDNA with no statistically significant
correlation between VAF and RECIST re-
sponse (P = .63).
Because of the small treated sample sizes in the
other cancer types (two patients with mela-
noma and one patient with colon cancer), re-
sults and discussion of these cases are available
in the Data Supplement.

 DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective
ctDNA-guided molecular testing program with ob-
jective response evaluated in solid tumors. This
program guided patients in whom biopsy was not
readily available or in whom tumor material was not
sufficient forcomprehensivesequencingtogenomi-
cally matched therapies available in practice or clin-
ical trials. In all, comprehensive ctDNA genomic
profiling was feasible, and all samples passed quality
control, obviating the need for repeat tests. Of 194
patients, 30 (15.5%) were successfully enrolled onto
one of the ongoing matched therapy clinical trials, a
rate comparable to tumor sequencing-based trials.
Responses to ctDNA-guided matched therapy in
GC and NSCLC were similar to those published in
tissue-based matched therapy studies, although the
sample sizes here are modest.
In GC, CNAs were found in ERBB2 (HER2),
MET, and FGFR2 in 31% of our patients, split
evenly between newly diagnosed and pretreated
patients, consistent with previous primary tumor
estimates of these CNAs at 20% to 22%.30,31
Significantly, four (80%) of five patients with
ERBB2 (HER2) -amplified GC responded, in-
cludingoneCR(Fig2A),withallachievingclinical
benefit (CR, PR,or SD).The onepatient with GC
with ERBB2 CNA without PR (but with SD) was
on lapatinib monotherapy, raising the question of
whether chemotherapy produced most of the
benefit here. However, addition of lapatinib to
chemotherapy did produce a significant overall
survival benefit in Asian patients in the Lapatinib
Optimization Study in HER2-Positive Gastric
Cancer (LOGiC) study.32 In addition, a patient
with refractory colon cancer with ERBB2 CNA
achieved SD as best response (Table 4). These
findings are consistent with the 53% RR recently
reported in HER2-positive advanced gastroesopha-
geal adenocarcinoma cancer using capecitabine and

GC here is similar to the RR reported with the same
ctDNA test in metastatic breast cancer, where six
(86%) of seven patients receiving combination anti-
HER2 therapy responded.25
The patients with GC with MET CNA (+++) and
FGFR2 CNA (++) also achieved clinical benefit
with targeted therapy (PR and SD, respectively),
although these are not routinely tested for in
GC. To enroll patients onto MET and FGFR2
amplification matched trials, we validated these
alterations in available corresponding patient
tumor tissue. In all, these CNA outcomes add to
emerging evidence that high-level ctDNA-
detected gene amplifications (++/+++) with this
comprehensive digital sequencing method are
targetable.18,25

 EGFRmutationsreceivingfirst-linetargetedther-
apy responded except one patient with SD on
rociletinib. The partial responses with gefitinib,
erlotinib, and afatinib (100%; 95% CI, 52% to
100%) are consistent with the 50% to 70%
published RRs with these agents.35-37 A single
patient with ALK fusion achieved good response
to crizotinib, as expected for this alteration.38
EGFRT790M was observed only at progression
and was present in 74% of patients with EGFR
driver mutations (17 of 24 patients) determined at
second line or higher, somewhat higher than the
62% rate in the AURA trial.39 All patients with
EGFRT790M mutations (100%; 95% CI, 52% to
100%) had a PR to third-generation EGFRi osi-
mertinib or olmutinib, with one patient stable on
afatinib plus a novel insulin-like growth factor-1
ligand monoclonal antibody.
Response to ctDNA-guided matched therapy was
independent of the quantitative VAF of the tar-
geted alteration (P = .63), as responders had
alterations as low as 0.07% (EGFRexon19del) or
0.13% (ALK fusion) and as high as 40.6%
(EGFRT790M). This is consistent with the AURA
study findings, in which, with droplet digital PCR
hotspot testing, there was no correlation of
EGFRT790M VAF with response to osimertinib
and a patient with VAF as low as 0.03% achieved
a response.23 Similar-sized tumors may shed vari-
able amounts of DNA into circulation, and ctDNA
levels are highly dynamic over time in the same
patient, including decreases to low levels in
responders.40,41
For secondary resistance mutations, the ratio of
resistance to initial driver mutation VAF in cfDNA
may be a better indicator of response than
absolute VAF.42 In AURA, a cfDNA ratio . 10%

 consistent with the high observed RR to third-
generation EGFRis (Fig 2C). Thus, an advantage
of ctDNA over tissue genotyping is that quantita-
tion of the relative VAFs can provide an indication
of the subclonality and potentially predict treat-
ment response, in contrast to a binary positive or
negative result. However, a ratio , 10% may be
misleading if there is focal amplification of the
EGFR driver mutation and not EGFRT790M.42
Beyond T790M, recent reports suggest that com-
prehensive profiling at progression may be im-
portant in NSCLC given the multiple other
resistance mechanisms after EGFRi therapy.43
These include non-EGFRT790M on-target point mu-
tations, as well as bypass mutations in BRAF, KRAS,
MEK, and PIK3CA; CNAs in MET and ERBB2;
fusions in ALK; or RB1 inactivation heralding epithelial
to mesenchymal cell transition.34,44-47 Because
EGFRT790M is the resistance mechanism in only
half of patients experiencing progression on first-
line EGFRi, a comprehensive ctDNA NGS test
covering all major types of genomic alterations is
particularly relevant.
Small sample sizes for targeted therapy in mela-
noma and colon cancer limit the conclusions that
can be drawn in those cohorts; however, the
RR CIs in GC and NSCLC are consistent with
tissue-guided matched therapy RRs. All four
major alteration types (point mutations, indels,
amplifications, and fusions) detected with this
comprehensive ctDNA genotyping method had
positive responses. Single-arm objective RRs
exceeding 30% have led to US Food and Drug
Administration regulatory approval of matched
therapies.48,49 The RRs to ctDNA-detected al-
terations in this interim analysis (67% [95% CI,
31% to 91%] for GC and 87% [95% CI, 58%
to 98%] for NSCLC) support clinical utility
for Guardant360 in patients with advanced
NSCLC and GC in whom tissue is insufficient
or inaccessible and build upon previous validation
studies of the diagnostic test used herein.12,26
Because this study was not randomized, its pri-
mary limitation is the potential for selection bias
to enroll patients more likely to benefit. In
addition, the cohort is heterogeneous, including
patients at varying lines of therapy and with
various concomitant treatments, which limits
conclusions in this interim analysis. Not all pa-
tients with targetable alterations could receive
matched therapy because of the various require-
ments of the multiple parallel matched therapy
substudy protocols, performance status, or loss
to follow-up. The final analysis will help to
address the modest sample size of this interim
analysis as well as report on progression-free sur-
vival. Future studies should examine ctDNA-
guided matched therapy outcomes in more ra-
cially diverse cohorts.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective
study to examine the clinical utility of compre-
hensive ctDNA genomic testing to guide
matched therapy selection. The findings here
build on cohort studies at other centers dem-
onstrating response to ctDNA-guided matched
therapy by the same method in NSCLC and
breast cancer.10,18,25,50 This study provides ad-
ditional validation of comprehensive ctDNA
genotyping as patients with all four types of
genomic alterations had positive responses.
ctDNA testing has the potential to reduce bi-
opsies and patient harm,51 which is important
because invasive biopsies to obtain additional
tissue for genotyping are increasing in both
clinical practice and research studies.52,53Among
patients with insufficient tumor tissue for se-
quencing, ctDNA testing can be a feasible option
to guide molecularly matched therapy.
