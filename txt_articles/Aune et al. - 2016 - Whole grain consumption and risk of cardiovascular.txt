ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To quantify the dose-response relation between 
consumption of whole grain and specific types of 
grains and the risk of cardiovascular disease, total 
cancer, and all cause and cause specific mortality.
Data sOurCes
PubMed and Embase searched up to 3 April 2016.
stuDy seleCtiOn
Prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk 
estimates for the association between intake of whole 
grains or specific types of grains and cardiovascular 
disease, total cancer, all cause or cause specific 
mortality.
Data synthesis
Summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals 
calculated with a random effects model.
results
45 studies (64 publications) were included. The 
summary relative risks per 90 g/day increase in whole 
grain intake (90 g is equivalent to three servings—for 
example, two slices of bread and one bowl of cereal or 
one and a half pieces of pita bread made from whole 
grains) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.87; 
I2=9%, n=7 studies) for coronary heart disease, 0.88 
(0.75 to 1.03; I2=56%, n=6) for stroke, and 0.78 (0.73 to 
0.85; I2=40%, n=10) for cardiovascular disease, with 
similar results when studies were stratified by whether 
the outcome was incidence or mortality. The relative 
risks for morality were 0.85 (0.80 to 0.91; I2=37%, n=6) 
for total cancer, 0.83 (0.77 to 0.90; I2=83%, n=11) for 
all causes, 0.78 (0.70 to 0.87; I2=0%, n=4) for 
respiratory disease, 0.49 (0.23 to 1.05; I2=85%, n=4) 
for diabetes, 0.74 (0.56 to 0.96; I2=0%, n=3) for 
infectious diseases, 1.15 (0.66 to 2.02; I2=79%, n=2) 
for diseases of the nervous system disease, and 0.78 
(0.75 to 0.82; I2=0%, n=5) for all non-cardiovascular, 
non-cancer causes. Reductions in risk were observed 
up to an intake of 210-225 g/day (seven to seven and a 
half servings per day) for most of the outcomes. 
Intakes of specific types of whole grains including 
whole grain bread, whole grain breakfast cereals, and 
added bran, as well as total bread and total breakfast 
cereals were also associated with reduced risks of 
cardiovascular disease and/or all cause mortality, but 
there was little evidence of an association with refined 
grains, white rice, total rice, or total grains.
COnClusiOns
This meta-analysis provides further evidence that 
whole grain intake is associated with a reduced risk of 
coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and 
total cancer, and mortality from all causes, respiratory 
diseases, infectious diseases, diabetes, and all 
non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes. These findings 
support dietary guidelines that recommend increased 
intake of whole grain to reduce the risk of chronic 
diseases and premature mortality.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease and cancer remain the two most 
common causes of death and in 2013 accounted for 25.5 
million deaths worldwide.1  Grains are one of the major 
staple foods consumed around the world and provide 
56% of the energy and 50% of the protein intake. They 
constitute the largest component of recommended 
daily intake in all dietary guidelines.2  Because of their 
important role in most diets around the world, interest 
in the health effects of grain consumption, and in par-
ticular whole grains, is increasing.3 4  A high intake of 
whole grains has been associated with a reduced risk of 
type 2 diabetes,5  coronary heart disease,6  and obesity.6
Whole grains contain endosperm, germ, and bran, in 
contrast with refined grains, which have the germ and 
bran removed during the milling process. Whole grains 
are good sources of fibre, B vitamins, and some trace 
minerals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc.7  These 
nutrients are found in the outer layer of the grains or 
the bran that function as a protective shell for the germ 
and endosperm inside. The germ is nourishment for the 
seed and contains antioxidants, vitamin E, and some B 
vitamins, while the endosperm provides carbohydrates,

A high intake of whole grains has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and weight gain
Recommendations for whole grain intake have often been unclear or inconsistent

WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
A high intake of whole grains was associated with reduced risk of coronary heart 
disease, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all cause mortality, as well as 
mortality from respiratory disease, infectious disease, diabetes, and all non-
cardiovascular, non-cancer causes
Reductions in risk were observed up to an intake of 210-225 g/day (seven to seven 
and a half servings/day) and for whole grain bread, whole grain breakfast cereals, 
and added bran
The results strongly support dietary recommendations to increase intake of whole 
grain foods in the general population to reduce risk of chronic diseases and 
premature mortality

protein, and energy.7  Consumption of whole grains dif-
fers considerably between populations,8  with the main 
source being whole grain bread in Scandinavian coun-
tries,9  whole grain bread and breakfast cereals in the 
United States,10  brown rice, unrefined maize and sor-
ghum in some African countries,11  and brown rice in

white rice.13

associated with a high intake of whole grains, though 
not all studies reported a clear association.23 24-27 We 
have previously reported an inverse association 
between dietary fibre and whole grain intake and risk of 
colorectal cancer,28  and a previous review of mostly 
case-control studies reported a lower risk of several 
individual cancers, mainly of the digestive system, with 
higher intake of whole grains,3  but data from cohort 
studies are limited. Whether whole grain consumption 
is associated with risk of total cancer is not clear, and 
clarification of this question would be important from a 
public health point of view. Epidemiological studies on 
whole grains and total cancer, however, have reported 
mixed results, with some studies suggesting a possible 
inverse association,4 
9 
22 
29  while others have shown no 
clear association.20 27  Of the cohort studies on whole 
grains and cardiovascular disease or all cause mortal-
ity, some16 
20 
22  but not all4 
15

21 
29  studies reported a pos-
sible plateau effect, with most of the benefit observed at 
relatively low levels of intake. Although two previous 
meta-analyses suggested an inverse association 
between high versus low intake of whole grains and 
coronary heart disease,6 30  no dose-response analyses 
were conducted, thus questions remain about the 
strength and shape of the dose-response relation 
between whole grains and coronary heart disease and 
the amount of whole grains that need to be eaten to 
reduce risk of coronary heart disease and other chronic 
diseases. Whole grain intake has also been inversely 
associated with other less common causes of death 
including deaths from infection,4 20 22  respiratory dis-
ease,4 
9 
20 
22  diabetes,9 
20 
22  and kidney disease20 in some 
studies, but the available data are limited.
Despite a growing body of epidemiological evidence 
for the health benefits of whole grain consumption, 
dietary recommendations have often been unclear or 
inconsistent with regard to the amount of whole grains 
that should be eaten to reduce the risk of chronic dis-
ease. For example the World Cancer Research Fund 
2007 report recommended that people should “eat rela-
tively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses with 
every meal,”31  while in the United Kingdom there is no 
specific recommendation other than “choosing whole 
grain, brown or high fibre varieties wherever you can,” 
but no specific quantities of whole grains were recom-
mended.32  In the US and Canada the recommendation 
is that “all adults eat at least half their grains as whole 
grains” so at least three servings of whole grains should 
be consumed each day,33  while in Scandinavian coun-
tries intake of at least 75 g per day of whole grain 
(dry weight), which equals about 250 g a day (eight 
servings/day) of whole grain products (fresh weight), is 
recommended.34  There might be several reasons for the 
inconsistent dietary guidelines for whole grain intake, 
including difficulties in measuring intake, differences 
in the consumption patterns between populations, or 
lack of data on intake in some populations, but it might 
also be because most previous meta-analyses consid-
ered only selected disease endpoints and did not con-
duct dose-response analyses.6 30  We found a reduced 
risk of incidence of type 2 diabetes associated with up to 
two to three servings a day (60-90 g/day) of whole grain 
but no further reductions in risk with higher intakes,5 
 
while in a second meta-analysis of whole grain intake 
and colorectal cancer a linear inverse association was 
observed with intakes of up to 180 g/day.28  Whether the 
association is linear or reaches a plateau for other 
chronic disease outcomes and all cause mortality, or 
whether only specific types of whole grains are associ-
ated with chronic disease and all cause mortality, 
would be important to clarify to provide more detailed 
and consistent dietary recommendations with regard to 
the amount and types of whole grains that should be 
consumed to reduce the risk of chronic disease and pre-
mature mortality. Answering this question would also 
clarify whether there are additional benefits with high 
intakes such as those recommended in the Scandina-
vian guidelines34  and whether such high recommenda-
tions are justified. Several large cohort studies including 
more than 22 000 cases of cardiovascular disease and 
more than 662 000 participants9 
20 
22 
27 
35  have been pub-
lished since or were missed36  by the previous meta-anal-
yses of whole grains and cardiovascular disease.6 
30
To provide a more comprehensive, up to date, and 
detailed assessment of whole grain intake and several 
health outcomes we conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of whole grain consumption in relation 
to coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and total cancer and all cause mortality, as well as 
less common causes of mortality including respiratory 
disease, infectious disease, diabetes, neurological dis-
ease, and all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes 
combined. We aimed to clarify the strength and the 
shape of the dose-response relation between whole 
grain intake and these outcomes. We also summarised 
data on specific types of whole grains as well as on 
refined grains and total grains. Because of the limited 
amount of data, however, the main focus of our current 
analysis is on whole grains.
Methods
search strategy and inclusion criteria
We searched the PubMed and Embase databases from 
their inception (1966 and 1947
, respectively) to 31 May 
2014 and later updated the search to 3 April 2016. 
Details of the search terms are provided in table S1 in 
appendix 1. We included prospective studies of grain 
intake and incidence or mortality from coronary heart 
disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, 
and all cause and cause specific mortality if they 
reported adjusted relative risk estimates and 95%

confidence intervals. For the dose-response analyses a 
quantitative measure of the intake for at least three cat-
egories of grain intake or a risk estimate for grain intake 
on a continuous scale had to be available. We searched 
the references of the retrieved reports for any additional 
studies. A list of the excluded studies is provided in 
table S2 in appendix 1. We followed standard criteria 
(PRISMA criteria) for reporting meta-analyses.37  The 
authors of one study22  were contacted for clarification 
of the amount of whole grain intake, which was 
reported in ounces/day (1 ounce=28 g) in the publica-
tion but was clarified to be in ounces/1000 kcal/day by 
the authors. In another study,38 the authors were con-
tacted for clarification of the increment for bread which 
was clarified to be 100 g/d rather than 10 g/d.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design, or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Data extraction
From each study we extracted name of first author, pub-
lication year, country, name of the study, follow-up 
period, sample size and number of cases or deaths, type 
of outcome, sex, age, type of grains, amount or fre-
quency of intake, relative risks and 95% confidence 
intervals, and variables adjusted for in the analysis. 
Data were extracted by one author (DA) and checked by 
another author (DCG) for accuracy.
statistical methods
We calculated summary relative risks of cardiovascular 
disease, total cancer, and all cause and cause specific 
mortality for the highest versus the lowest level of 
intake and for 90 g a day increment (three servings/day; 
the approximate median range across studies) using the 
random effects model by DerSimonian and Laird,39 
which takes into account variation (heterogeneity) both 
within and between studies. The average of the natural 
logarithm of the relative risks was estimated and the 
relative risk from each study was weighted with random 
effects weights. When studies reported data separately 
by sex we pooled the relative risks using a fixed effects 
model before inclusion in the meta-analysis. A two 
tailed P<0.05 was considered significant.
We conducted linear dose-response analyses using 
the method by Greenland and Longnecker40  to compute 
study specific slopes (linear trends) and 95% confi-
dence intervals from the natural logarithm of the rela-
tive risks across categories of grain intake. For each 
category of grain intake we used the mean or median if 
it was reported in the publication and estimated the 
midpoint of the upper and lower bound for the remain-
ing studies. When extreme categories were open ended 
or had extreme upper or lower values we used the width 
of the adjacent interval to calculate an upper or lower 
cut-off value. For total grains, whole grains, and refined 
grains we used 30 g as a serving size (one slice of bread 
or one bowl of breakfast cereal) to recalculate results 
from studies reporting data in g/day to servings/day, as 
in our previous analyses.5 
28  For intake of pasta we used 
150 g as a serving size while for total rice we used 167
.25 
g as a serving size (cooked weight) based on a weighted 
average of the serving size for white rice (158 g/day) and 
brown rice (195 g/day), weighted by the proportion of 
rice intake of each type (75% white rice and 25% brown 
rice),41  unless a serving size was specified in the paper. 
Separate analyses were conducted for studies reporting 
on total whole grains and specific subtypes of whole 
grains. We assessed a potential non-linear dose-re-
sponse relation between grain intake and cardiovascu-
lar disease, cancer, and all cause and cause specific 
mortality using restricted cubic splines with three knots 
at 10%, 50%, and 90% centiles of the distribution, 
which were combined using multivariate meta-analy-
sis.42 
43  The 95% confidence intervals were derived from 
the standard errors of the differences in linear predic-
tors between each given point on the dose-response 
curve and a stated reference value, computed from the 
covariate values and the covariance matrix of the esti-
mated coefficients.44  A likelihood ratio test was used to 
assess the difference between the non-linear and linear 
models to test for non-linearity.45
Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with Q 
and I2 statistics.46 For the Q statistic a P<0.10 was con-
sidered to be significant. I2 is the amount of total varia-
tion explained by variation between studies. We carried 
out subgroup and meta-regression analyses stratified 
by study characteristics (duration of follow-up, sex, 
geographical location, number of cases, whether the 
method of dietary assessment had been validated, 
study quality, and adjustment for confounding factors) 
to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Influ-
ence analyses in which we excluded one study at a time 
from each analysis were conducted to investigate the 
robustness of the findings. We assessed publication 
bias with Egger’s test47  and have provided funnel plots 
in analyses including 10 or more studies. Study quality 
was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, which 
awards 0-9 points based on the selection, comparabil-
ity, and outcome assessment.48 We considered studies 
with 0-3, 4-6, and 7-9 points to represent low, medium, 
and high quality studies, respectively. Stata version 12.0 
software (StataCorp, TX) was used for the analyses.
Results
We included 45 cohort studies (64 publications)4

15-92  in 
the analyses of grain intake and coronary heart disease, 
stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all 
cause mortality and other causes of mortality (table 
S3-S12 in appendix 1, fig 1 ). Twenty studies were from 
Europe, 16 were from the US, and nine were from Asia. 
The studies included in the analyses of whole grains 
included 7068 cases of coronary heart disease, 2337 
cases of stroke, 26 243 cases of cardiovascular disease, 
34 346 deaths from cancer, and 100 726 all cause deaths.

63 investigated the associ-
ation between whole grain intake and risk of coronary 
heart disease and included a total of 7068 cases and 
316 491 participants (one additional publication was 
included only in the subgroup analysis of incidence of 
coronary heart disease64  as it overlapped with another 
publication9). The summary relative risk for high versus 
low intake was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 
0.86; I2=0%, Pheterogeneity=0.63) (fig S1 in appendix 2, 
table 1). The summary relative risk per 90 g/day was 
0.81 (0.75 to 0.87; I2=9%, Pheterogeneity=0.36) (fig 2 , table 1 ). 
Although the test for non-linearity was significant for the 
association between whole grain intake and coronary 
heart disease (P<0.001), with a slightly steeper reduction 
in risk up to three servings a day than more than three 
servings a day, there was a clear dose-response relation, 
and there were further reductions in risk up to 210 g/day 
(fig 2, fig S2 in appendix 2, table S13 in appendix 1).

Whole grains and stroke
Six cohort studies4 9 16 18 24 63 were included in the 
 
analysis of whole grain intake and risk of stroke 
and included 2337 cases and 245 012 participants. 
The pooled relative risk for high versus low intake 
was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.05; I2=32%, 
Pheterogeneity=0.21 (fig S3 in appendix 2, table 1). The sum-
mary relative risk per 90 g/day was 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03; 
I2=56%, Pheterogeneity=0.04) (fig 3 , table 1 ). There was evi-
dence of non-linearity between whole grain and risk of 
stroke (P<0.001), and there was no further reduction in 
risk above 120-150 g/day (fig 3, fig S4 in appendix 2, 
table S13 in appendix 1).
We found no clear association between intake of 
whole grain bread,9

63 inves-
tigated whole grain intake and risk of cardiovascular 
disease and included 26 243 cases and 704 317 partici-
pants. The summary relative risk for high versus low 
intake was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.87; 
I2=0%, Pheterogeneity=0.48) (fig S5 in appendix 2, table 1). 
The summary relative risk was 0.78 (0.73 to 0.85; 
I2=40%, Pheterogeneity=0.09) per 90 g/day (fig 4 , table 1 ). 
There was evidence of a non-linear association between 
whole grain intake and risk of cardiovascular disease 
(P<0.001), with a stronger reduction in risk from no 
intake up to 50 g/day than with higher intakes, but 
with slight further reductions in risk with intakes up to 
200 g/day (fig 4, fig S6 in appendix 2, table S13 in

erogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.74) and the association 
remained similar (summary relative risk 0.87
, 0.83 to 
0.92). There was no evidence of a non-linear association 
between whole grain intake and total cancer (P=0.15; 
fig 5 fig S8 in appendix 2, table S13 in appendix 1).
There was an inverse association between intake of 
whole grain bread9 29 36 52  and total cancer, and there 
were weak inverse associations between intake of 
refined grains,4 
20  and total grains74 
75  and total cancer 
in the dose-response analysis, but no association was 
observed between brown rice,92  white rice,92  total 
breakfast cereals,36 
71  and total rice73 
92  and total cancer 
(figs S73-S86 in appendix 2, table 2).
Whole grains and all cause mortality
Eleven cohort studies (10 publications)4 9 16 19 20 21 22 25 27 
investigated the association between whole grain 
intake and all cause mortality and included 100 726 
deaths and 705 253 participants. The pooled relative risk 
for high versus low intake was 0.82 (95% confidence 
interval 0.77 to 0.88; I2=83%, Pheterogeneity<0.001) (fig S9 
in appendix 2, table 1). The summary relative risk was 
0.83 (0.77 to 0.90; I2=83%, Pheterogeneity<0.001) per 90 g/
day (fig 6 , table 1 ). The heterogeneity was reduced 
when we excluded two outlying studies21 25 (I2=66%, 
P=0.003), but the association was not substantially 
altered (summary relative risk 0.81, 0.76 to 0.86). 
Although the test for non-linearity was significant 
(P<0.001), and steeper reductions in risk were observed 
at lower intakes, there was a clear dose-response rela-
tion, and the lowest risk was observed at 225 g/day 
(fig 6, fig S10 in appendix 2, table S13 in appendix 1).

tory disease mortality (figs 7-10 , figs S12, S14, S16, S18, 
S20 in appendix 2). The analysis of mortality from dis-
eases of the nervous system showed a slight positive 
association at low intakes, but no association at intakes 
of 90 g/day, while the association with all non-cardio-
vascular, non-cancer causes of death showed little evi-
dence of non-linearity (P=0.06; figs 10-11, table S14 in 
appendix 1).
Publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression 
analyses, study quality, and influence analyses
There was no evidence of small study bias such as pub-
lication bias with Egger’s test for coronary heart disease 
(P=0.11), cardiovascular disease (P=0.31), total cancer 
(P=0.44), and all cause mortality (P=0.99) (figs 
S103-S104 in appendix 2), but some indication for 
stroke (P=0.01). There were, however, few studies in this 
analysis, and exclusion of one outlying study18  from the 
analysis attenuated Egger’s test to non-significance 
(P=0.13) and made the summary estimate significant 
(0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.93). There was 
little evidence of heterogeneity between subgroups in 
subgroup and meta-regression analyses stratified by 
study characteristics including duration of follow-up, 
sex, type of outcome, geographical location, number of 
cases or deaths, or adjustment for confounding factors 
(table S15-S16 in appendix 1). The association between 
whole grain intake and coronary heart disease, cardio-
vascular disease, and total cancer was consistent 
among both US and European studies, while the associ-
ation with stroke and all cause mortality was observed 
only in US studies. For all cause mortality, however, 
exclusion of one study,25 in which intake of whole 
grains was extremely low (and which partly explained 
the heterogeneity), made the summary estimate signifi-
cant for the European studies as well (summary relative 
risk 0.82, 0.79 to 0.85; I2=0%, Pheterogeneity=0.36). In the 
analysis of whole grain intake and stroke there was a 
significant association among studies with stroke mor-
tality as the outcome, among US studies, and among 
studies with a validated dietary assessment, however, 
there was no significant difference between these sub-
group analyses (table S15 in appendix 1). There was also 
little evidence of heterogeneity in the remaining sub-
group analyses (tables S15-S16 in appendix 1).
Mean (median) study quality scores for the studies on 
whole grains were 7
.9 (8.0) for coronary heart disease, 
7
.7 (8.0) for stroke, 7
.7 (8.0) for cardiovascular disease, 
7
.8 (8.0) for total cancer, and 7
.9 (8.0) for mortality, out 
of a maximum of 9 points (tables S17-S21 in appendix 1).
In sensitivity analyses in which we excluded one 
study at a time from each analysis the summary esti-
mates were not substantially altered for coronary heart 
disease, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all 
cause mortality, but for stroke there was one study24 
that explained the lack of association (figs S105-S109 in 
appendix 2).
discussion
In this dose-response meta-analysis we found an 
inverse association between whole grain intake and 
outcomes of several major chronic diseases, including 
coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease 
overall, total cancer, and all cause mortality as well as

less common causes of death such as from respiratory 
disease, diabetes, infectious disease, and all non-car-
diovascular, non-cancer causes. There were reductions 
of 21%, 16%, 11%, and 18%, respectively, in the relative 
risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, 
total cancer, and all cause mortality for the highest ver-
sus lowest category of whole grain intake. In the 
dose-response analyses there were reductions of 19%, 
22%, 15%, and 17%, respectively, in the relative risk per 
90 g/day (one serving equals 30 g), while the associa-
tion for stroke was significant only in the non-linear 
dose-response analysis. There were also reductions of 
19%, 36%, 20%, and 21% in the relative risk of mortality 
from respiratory disease, diabetes, infectious disease, 
and all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes, respec-
tively, with a high versus low intake of whole grains. No 
evidence of an association was observed for mortality 
from nervous system disorders in the high versus low or 
linear dose-response analysis. There was some evi-
dence of a slight positive association at low intakes but 
not at intakes of 90 g/day or more. There was indication 
of non-linearity in several of the dose-response analy-
ses, with somewhat steeper reductions in risk at lower 
levels of intake in most of the analyses. There were, 
however, further reductions in the risk of coronary 
heart disease and mortality from cancer, respiratory 
disease, and all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes 
of death as well from all cause mortality up to intakes as 
high as 210-225 g/day (seven to seven and a half serv-
ings a day).
Although current dietary guidelines recommend 
whole grains rather than refined grains, recommenda-
tions have often not quantified the amount of whole 
grain intake that should be consumed,31 thus the cur-
rent analysis provides a considerable improvement of 
the evidence base for the level of whole grains that 
should be consumed to reduce the risk of chronic dis-
eases and mortality. Relatively few people might have 
three or more servings a day of whole grains. As indi-
cated by the benefits we observed in the non-linear 
dose-response analyses at an intake of even one or two 
servings a day in relation to most of the outcomes, how-
ever, even moderate increases in whole grain intake 
could reduce the risk of premature mortality. Also, as 
many people might have a total grain intake of three or 
more servings a day, replacement of most or all of the 
refined grains with whole grains could increase whole 
grain intake substantially.
Although there was some evidence of non-linear 
associations between whole grain intake and coronary 
heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and mor-
tality from all causes, respiratory disease, diabetes, and 
infections, with stronger reductions in risk observed at 
lower levels of intake, in most of the analyses there was 
a clear dose-response relation with further reductions 
with intakes up to seven to seven and a half servings a 
day (210-225 g/day). In addition, there were inverse 
associations for some subtypes of whole grains or total 
grains and coronary heart disease (whole grain bread, 
whole grain breakfast cereals, added bran), cardio-
vascular disease (whole grain bread, whole grain 
breakfast cereals, bran, total breakfast cereals), total 
cancer (whole grain bread, total grains), and all cause

mortality (whole grain bread, whole grain cereals, total 
grains, total bread, pasta), which supports the findings 
for whole grain intake overall. There was little evidence 
of an association between intake of refined grains and 
any of the outcomes. The number of studies in the anal-
yses of grain subtypes, however, was low. Given that 
whole grain consumption differs substantially between 
populations, both with regard to type and amount, and 
because most of the current data are from US and Euro-
pean studies it is possible that effect sizes might differ 
in other populations.
limitations of the study
Our meta-analysis has some limitations that should be 
mentioned. There was high heterogeneity in the analy-
sis of whole grains and all cause mortality. With the 
exception of one study from the Netherlands,25  which 
had a small range of whole grain intake (the interquar-
tile range was 0-0 and 10.6-13.5 g/d in men/women, 
respectively), however, the heterogeneity seemed to be 
more due to differences in the strength of the associa-
tion between studies than to differences in the direction 
of the association. Exclusion of two outlying studies21 
25 
reduced the heterogeneity in the analysis of all cause 
mortality but did not substantially alter the summary 
estimates.

Although we took into account the different amounts 
and ranges of whole grain intake between studies in the 
dose-response analysis, studies could also have dif-
fered by the types of whole grains consumed, by how 
accurately they measured whole grain intake, or by 
how they defined whole grains. This could have con-
tributed to heterogeneity between studies. In addition, 
given the diversity of whole grain products available it 
is difficult to assess intake accurately in epidemiologi-
cal studies, and some degree of measurement error is 
inevitable. A recent review recommended reporting 
intake as the actual amount of whole grain per dry 
weight.93  As some studies have classified some whole 
grain items (breakfast cereals, muesli) as whole grain 
foods if they have a whole grain content of ≥25% or 
>50% of the weight of the product, then a grain product 
could be considered whole grain if its whole grain con-
tent varied between 25-100 g or 51-100 g per 100 g of the 
product. Somebody could consume a product with 24 g 
or 50 g of whole grain per 100 g of the product and still 
be considered to eat no whole grain, leading to misclas-
sification of the exposure. Most of the studies seemed to 
report intake as the amount or frequency of whole grain 
food or product intake (fresh weight including water 
content), while only two publications9 20  reported 
intakes in actual amount of whole grain food (dry 
weight). One study that reported results for both whole 
grain products (fresh weight) and actual whole grain 
intake (dry weight) in relation to mortality, however, 
found similar associations for the two.9 Most of the 
associations were similar for different types of whole 
grains, and, in addition, most of the US studies seemed 
to define whole grains similarly, while few of the Euro-
pean studies provided a definition of whole grain.
People with a high intake of whole grains might have 
different lifestyles, diets,20 
94  or socioeconomic status94 
than those with a low intake, thus confounding by 
other lifestyle factors is a potential source of bias. In 
subgroup analyses we found that the associations 
observed persisted among studies that adjusted for 
smoking, alcohol, physical activity, BMI, and other 
dietary factors such as sugar sweetened beverages, red 
meat, and fruit and vegetables. Though differences in 
socioeconomic factors or deprivation could also have 
influenced the findings, both the Nurses’ Health Study 
and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, cohorts 
in which there would be relatively little confounding by 
socioeconomic status or deprivation, found similar 
results to the overall analysis, and there was no evi-
dence of heterogeneity in the results stratified by 
adjustment for education.
The number of studies that investigated subtypes of 
whole grains and total or refined grains was limited. 
Any further studies should therefore try to clarify asso-
ciations between specific subtypes of grains and cardio-
vascular disease, cancer, and mortality, as well as less 
common causes of mortality. As in any meta-analysis of 
published studies publication bias could have influ-
enced the results. Though we found some indication of 
small study effects such as publication bias in the anal-
ysis of stroke, there was no evidence of publication bias 
for the remaining outcomes, although the number of 
studies was moderate and power to detect such bias is 
low when there are few studies.
strengths of the study
Strengths of the current study include the compre-
hensive analyses of intake of whole grain and sub-
types of grain in relation to a range of chronic disease 
and mortality outcomes including high versus low 
analyses; linear and non-linear dose-response analy-
ses; the detailed subgroup, sensitivity, and influence 
analyses; the large numbers of cases or deaths and 
participants included; and the high quality of the 
studies included.
Mechanisms
Several mechanisms could explain the beneficial effect 
observed between whole grain intake and coronary 
heart disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all 
cause and cause specific mortality. Whole grains are 
rich in fibre, which can reduce the postprandial glucose 
and insulin responses leading to better glycaemic con-
trol.95  Epidemiological studies have suggested a lower 
risk of overweight and obesity6 
96 
97  and of type 2 diabe-
tes5 6  among people with a high whole grain intake. 
Though both adiposity and type 2 diabetes are estab-
lished risk factors for cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
and mortality, in our analysis all the studies adjusted 
for BMI, suggesting an association independent of BMI. 
One study on whole grains and coronary heart disease17 
 
and another study on mortality9 found little difference 
between hazard ratios adjusted or not adjusted for BMI, 
so if anything BMI might mediate only a small part of 
the association.

Higher whole grain intake has been associated with a 
lower prevalence or risk of hypertension or raised blood 
pressure,95 98 99  hypertriglyceridaemia,95 100  and lower 
concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol,97 100  which are important cardiovascular risk 
factors. Higher fibre intake has been associated with 
reduced risk of coronary heart disease,101  stroke,102 
 
some cancers,28 
103  and all cause mortality.104 
105 
106  Fibre 
intake, in particular soluble fibre, might reduce choles-
terol concentrations by inhibiting reabsorption of bile 
acid and by bacterial fermentation of fibre in the colon, 
which results in the production of short chain fatty 
acids, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver.107 
 
Dietary fibre can reduce the risk of cancer by mechanic 
removal of damaged cells from the digestive tract,108 
 
increasing stool bulk, diluting carcinogens, decreasing 
transit time, altering the gut microbiota,28 109-111  and 
binding oestrogens in the colon and increasing the 
 
faecal excretion of oestrogens, leading to lower oestro-
gen concentrations.103 
112
Whole grain consumption has been found to be 
inversely associated with mortality from inflammatory 
diseases,4  and an intervention study found reduced 
concentrations of fasting serum glucose, measures of 
lipid peroxidation, and homocysteine concentrations 
among participants fed a whole grain/legume powder 
supplement.113  Whole grain intake has been associated 
with lower levels of inflammatory markers (PAI-1, 
CRP)114-117  and liver enzymes (GGT, ASAT),117  higher lev-
els of which have been associated with increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality.118-120 
 
Whole grain intake has also been associated with higher 
levels of adiponectin,116  which increases insulin sensi-
tivity and reduces inflammation. Whole grains also con-
tain several other potentially beneficial components 
that could explain some of the current findings.121
Further studies are needed to clarify whether there is 
an underlying mechanism for the non-linear associa-
tion between whole grain intake and cardiovascular 
disease, all cause mortality, and mortality from respira-
tory disease, diabetes, and infectious diseases. A high 
intake of whole grains could also reduce the risk of 
chronic disease and mortality indirectly, by displace-
ment of unhealthy foods or drinks. The association for 
cardiovascular disease and mortality, however, per-
sisted in studies that adjusted for intake of red and pro-
cessed meat and sugar sweetened beverages.
Policy implications and future research
We found that a high whole grain intake was associated 
with reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovas-
cular disease, total cancer, and all cause mortality as 
well as mortality from respiratory disease, infections, 
diabetes, and all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer 
causes combined. This is strong evidence that a high 
intake of whole grains is beneficial for several health 
outcomes in a dose-response manner. In addition, a 
high intake of whole grains has previously been associ-
ated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer,28  type 2 dia-
betes,5  and overweight or obesity.6  Altogether these 
findings have important public health implications as 
whole grain intake can be modified relatively easily by 
replacing refined grains and could have a large effect on 
the burden of chronic disease if adopted in the general 
population. As shown in the current meta-analysis, a 
high intake of whole grain is not only associated with 
reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes but 
also with mortality from cancer, respiratory disease, 
infectious disease, and all non-cancer, non-cardiovas-
cular causes combined. The current findings therefore 
strongly support existing dietary recommendations to 
increase whole grain consumption in the general popu-
lation. From a practical angle a whole grain product 
intake of 90 g/day can be achieved, for example, by eat-
ing a portion of whole grain breakfast cereals (30-40 g) 
at breakfast and a piece of whole grain pita bread for 
dinner (60 g). The non-linear analyses suggested that 
the reduction in risk of mortality is steepest at the 
 
lowest level of whole grain intake (people who increase 
from no intake of whole grain to two servings/day) and 
that perhaps targeting subjects with a very low intake 
might have a greater impact. Further reductions were 
observed up to 210-225 g/day (seven to seven and a half 
servings a day), however, suggesting further benefits 
with even higher intakes. Most of the studies included 
in the analyses of whole grains were from the US, and 
only a few European studies have been published so far. 
Whole grain intake is higher in Northern Europe34 122 
 
than in the US, and populations in Northern Europe 
might therefore be promising for further studies of the 
association between whole grains and health out-
comes, both in terms of examining more extreme 
intakes and specific types of whole grains. Further stud-
ies are needed in other geographical locations, as are 
studies of specific diseases and less common causes of 
death and that incorporate biomarkers of whole grain 
intake.123
In conclusion our results provide further evidence for 
the beneficial effects of diets high in whole grains on 
the risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular dis-
ease, total cancer, and all cause mortality, as well as 
mortality from respiratory disease, infections, diabetes, 
and all non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes com-
bined. Reductions in risk are observed up to 210-225 g/
day or seven to seven and a half servings a day, and the 
current findings support dietary recommendations to 
increase intake of whole grains and as much as possible 
to choose whole grains rather than refined grains.
