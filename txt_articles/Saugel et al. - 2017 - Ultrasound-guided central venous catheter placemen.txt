Abstract
The use of ultrasound (US) has been proposed to reduce the number of complications and to increase the safety
and quality of central venous catheter (CVC) placement. In this review, we describe the rationale for the use of US
during CVC placement, the basic principles of this technique, and the current evidence and existing guidelines for
its use. In addition, we recommend a structured approach for US-guided central venous access for clinical practice.
Static and real-time US can be used to visualize the anatomy and patency of the target vein in a short-axis and a
long-axis view. US-guided needle advancement can be performed in an "out-of-plane" and an "in-plane" technique.
There is clear evidence that US offers gains in safety and quality during CVC placement in the internal jugular vein.
For the subclavian and femoral veins, US offers small gains in safety and quality. Based on the available evidence
from clinical studies, several guidelines from medical societies strongly recommend the use of US for CVC
placement in the internal jugular vein. Data from survey studies show that there is still a gap between the existing
evidence and guidelines and the use of US in clinical practice. For clinical practice, we recommend a six-step
systematic approach for US-guided central venous access that includes assessing the target vein (anatomy
and vessel localization, vessel patency), using real-time US guidance for puncture of the vein, and confirming the
correct needle, wire, and catheter position in the vein. To achieve the best skill level for CVC placement the
knowledge from anatomic landmark techniques and the knowledge from US-guided CVC placement need to be
combined and integrated.

Background
Although placement of a central venous catheter (CVC)
is a routine procedure in intensive care medicine and
anesthesiology, acute severe
complications (such as
arterial puncture or cannulation, hematoma, hemotho-
rax, or pneumothorax) occur in a relevant proportion
of patients [1, 2]. The use of ultrasound (US) has been
proposed to reduce the number of CVC complications
and to increase the safety and quality of CVC placement.
In this review, we describe the rationale for the use of
US during CVC placement, the basic principles of this
technique, and the current evidence and existing guide-
lines for its use. In addition, we recommend a structured
approach for US-guided central venous access for clinical
practice.
Rationale for ultrasound-guided central venous
catheter placement
Traditionally, CVC placement is performed using land-
mark techniques based on the knowledge of anatomic
structures and palpation of arteries next to the veins.
These landmark techniques cannot account for anatomic
variations at the CVC insertion site. Anatomic variations
to the "normal anatomy", however, have been described
in a relevant proportion of patients for the internal jugular
vein (IJV), the subclavian vein (SV), and the femoral vein
(FV) [3–11]. In addition to anatomic variations, venous

 thrombosis that is especially common in oncologic and
critically ill patients can make CVC placement impossible
or dangerous for the patient [9].
The described anatomic variations and the presence of
venous thrombosis can hardly be identified using a land-
mark technique. In contrast, US can be used to easily
visualize anatomic structures and confirm patency of the
vein and thus help to avoid unintended arterial puncture
or unsuccessful cannulation. In addition, US can facili-
tate CVC placement in special clinical situations in
which landmark techniques based on palpation of the
arterial pulse are challenging or impossible (e.g., femoral
CVC placement during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
[12] or in patients with a nonpulsatile ventricular assist
device).
Ultrasound for central venous catheter placement:
basic principles and techniques
Ultrasound probe
US probes best suited for CVC placement are small linear
array probes with high-frequency transducers (5–15 MHz)
[13]. These probes usually have a scanning surface of
about 20–50 mm and allow high-resolution imaging of
superficial anatomic structures [13]. 2D imaging (comple-
mented by Doppler US functions) is currently the stand-
ard technique used for US-guided central venous access
[13]. All US probes have an index mark (a small physical
notch on one side of the probe) that corresponds with an
orientation marker on one side of the US scan sector
shown on the US device screen and thus helps to obtain
the correct probe orientation during US examination.
Preferably, US machines should have the ability to record
and save US images and loops for clinical documentation
(and teaching purposes) [13].
Ultrasound techniques for central venous catheter
placement
US can be used in different ways to facilitate CVC place-
ment. "Static" US (also called indirect US) describes a
technique using US only before CVC placement to iden-
tify the anatomy of the target vein and adjacent anatomic
structures (including the patency of the vein and its
dimensions and depth from the skin) [14]. This ap-
proach of preprocedural US evaluation is also referred
to as "US-assisted" CVC placement.
In contrast, "real-time" US (also called direct US)
describes a technique of needle advancement and vessel
puncture under permanent US control (i.e., the needle is
permanently visualized on the US screen). This is also
referred to as "US guidance" [14].
Short-axis/long-axis and out-of-plane/in-plane views
The US probe can be placed in a transverse position
relative to the vessel, resulting in a "short-axis" view on
the US screen (i.e., a cross-sectional image of the vessel).
A "long-axis" view (i.e., a longitudinal image of the ves-
sel) is obtained by placing the US probe in a parallel
position relative to the course of the vessel. Short-axis
and long-axis views can be used for both US assistance
and guidance of CVC placement. Of note, the terms
"out-of-plane" and "in-plane" describe the direction of the
needle relative to the US plane, refer to US-guided needle
advancement, and should not be mixed up with the terms
"short-axis" and "long-axis".
For real-time US guidance, different US approaches
can be used. US guidance during needle advancement
can be performed using: a short-axis probe orientation
and an out-of-plane view of the needle (Fig. 1a); a long-
axis probe orientation and an in-plane view of the needle
(Fig. 1b); or a so-called oblique orientation [15]. It is im-
portant to understand that the user needs to align the
US plane and the needle plane containing the needle
that appears on the screen as a point (short-axis/out-
of-plane) or an echogenic line (long-axis/in-plane)
with ring-down artifacts [14].
Whether or not one approach is superior to the other
cannot be answered rigorously based on the existing
data. The advantage of the short-axis/out-of-plane view is
that it allows better visualization of the vein in relation to
the artery and other anatomic structures, and thus might
more sufficiently help to avoid accidental arterial puncture
[15]. The short-axis/out-of-plane approach is easier to
learn for physicians not familiar with US [16]. Among ex-
perienced US users, the short-axis/out-of-plane approach
seems to result in a higher success rate with the first at-
tempt for CVC placement in the IJV and SV [17, 18].
However, in the short-axis view, the needle is only visual-
ized as an echogenic point (that must not necessarily be
the tip of the needle). In contrast, when using the long-
axis/in-plane view, the entire needle in its complete course
and the depth of the needle tip can be visualized on the
US image, thus reducing the risk of penetration of the
posterior vessel wall [15, 19].
Combining advantages of both techniques, the oblique
axis view (a view that is halfway between the short-axis
and the long-axis view with the US probe placed at
approximately 45° with respect to the target vessel) can
be used by experienced US users [20, 21].
Can ultrasound make central venous catheter placement
safer? What is the evidence?
The use of US to reduce the number of complications
related to vascular access for CVC placement has been
evaluated in numerous previous studies in a variety of
clinical settings. Recent Cochrane systematic reviews and
meta-analyses summarize the current evidence for US
guidance versus anatomic landmark techniques for CVC
placement in the IJV [22], SV [23], and FV [23] with

 regard to complications of CVC placement. These meta-
analyses included adult and pediatric patients treated in
the intensive care unit or the operating room and com-
pared conventional landmark techniques with techniques
using static or real-time US or Doppler US. The primary
outcome measure was the total rate of peri-interventional
complications and adverse events.
For the IJV, 35 trials enrolling a total of 5108 patients
were included in the meta-analysis [22]. The analysis
demonstrated that the use of US for CVC placement in
the IJV reduces the total rate of complications compared
with conventional landmark techniques (US, 48 compli-
cations in 1212 patients (4.0%) vs landmark, 161/1194
(13.5%); risk ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)) 0.29
(0.17–0.52)). The overall success rate was higher when
US was used (US, 2120/2172 (97.6%) vs landmark, 1900/
2168 (87.6%); risk ratio (95% CI) 1.12 (1.08–1.17)) [22].
In addition, the use of US resulted in a decrease in the
rate of arterial puncture, hematoma formation, and
number of attempts and time until successful cannula-
tion, and in an increase in the success rate with the first
attempt of puncture [22]. The benefits of US-guided or
US-assisted CVC placement with regard to the total
complication rate, overall success rate, and number of
attempts until success were consistent across experi-
enced and inexperienced operators. Thus, this meta-
analysis clearly provides evidence that US offers gains
in safety and quality during CVC placement in the
IJV. The quality of the evidence, however, was very
low for most outcome measures and the heterogeneity
among the studies was high.
For the SV, a meta-analysis including nine studies with
2030 patients showed that the use of US resulted in a re-
duced rate of accidental arterial puncture (US, 2/242
(0.8%) vs landmark, 15/256 (5.9%); risk ratio (95% CI)
0.21 (0.06–0.82)) and hematoma formation (US, 3/242
(1.2%) vs landmark, 17/256 (6.6%); risk ratio (95% CI) 0.26
(0.09–0.76)) [23]. However, no statistically significant
difference was found between the use of US and the
conventional landmark technique with regard to the total
complication rate, the overall success rate, the number of
attempts until success, the time to successful cannulation,
and the success rate with the first attempt [23].
For CVC placement in the FV, the use of US com-
pared with the landmark technique increased the overall
success rate (US, 134/150 (89.0%) vs landmark, 127/161
(78.9%); risk ratio (95% CI) 1.11 (1.00–1.23)) and the
success rate with the first attempt (US, 91/107 (85.0%)
vs landmark, 57/117 (48.7%); risk ratio (95% CI) 1.73
(1.34–2.22)) [23].
Although the use of US offers small gains in safety and
quality, the authors conclude that the meta-analysis does
not generally support the use of US for CVC placement
in the SV and FV [23].
On behalf of the Canadian Perioperative Anesthesia
Clinical Trials Group, Lalu et al. [24] performed a
systematic review and meta-analysis of US-guided SV
catheterization. Based on data from 10 studies (including

axis probe orientation and an out-of-plane view of the needle (a) or a long-axis probe orientation and an in-plane view of the needle (b)

 2168 patients; six real-time US studies, one static US
study, three Doppler US studies), the authors revealed
that US reduced the overall complication rate compared
with the landmark technique (odds ratio (95% CI) 0.53
(0.41–0.69)). Real-time US particularly reduced acci-
dental arterial puncture, pneumothorax, and hematoma
formation.
A CVC via the SV can be placed using either an infra-
clavicular (most commonly used) or a supraclavicular
approach. To the best of our knowledge there are no
randomized controlled trials on US-guided CVC place-
ment via the SV comparing the supraclavicular and the
infraclavicular approach. The supraclavicular approach
(using different US probes) needs to be evaluated in fu-
ture studies.
When discussing the evidence for US during CVC
placement at the different anatomic sites based on the
available studies and meta-analyses, one needs to keep
in mind that—compared to the IJV—it might be more
challenging to prove the advantages of US for CVC
placement in the SV, because the ultrasound approach is
technically more challenging, and in the FV, because se-
vere complications other than arterial puncture occur
infrequently.
Guidelines for ultrasound-guided central venous
catheter placement
Various recommendations and guidelines with different
clinical scopes and for different target audiences have
been published during the last years.
In 2012, a joint guideline from the American Society
of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular
Anesthesiologists [15] strongly recommended the use of
real-time US for CVC placement in the IJV (category A,
level 1 evidence), while it was not recommended for
the SV (category A, level 3 evidence). For the FV, no
recommendation for routine use of US was made be-
cause of insufficient scientific evidence (category C,
level 2 evidence).
A practice guideline from the American Society of
Anesthesiologists task force, also in 2012 [25], recom-
mended the use of static US imaging in elective situa-
tions for prepuncture identification of the anatomy and
to evaluate the vessel localization and patency and real-
time US for venipuncture for the IJV. Further, it is recom-
mended that both static and real-time US "may" be used
for CVC placement in the SV or FV [25].
For CVC placement in critically ill patients treated in
the intensive care unit, an international expert panel rec-
ommended in 2012 the routine use of US for short-term
and long-term central venous access in adults [13]. More
specifically, the panel recommended the utilization of
2D US imaging with a long-axis/in-plane technique for
vascular access [13] and agreed on the very strong
recommendation (based on Level A evidence) that "US-
guided vascular access has to be used because it results
in clinical benefits and reduced overall costs of care
makes it cost-effective” [13].
The guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside gen-
eral and cardiac US from the American College of Critical
Care Medicine [26] give a strong (1-A) recommendation
for the general use of US for central venous access in real-
time technique (1-B) using a short-axis approach (1-B).
Regarding the site for CVC placement, the guidelines give
a strong (1-A) recommendation for the IJV and the FV,
but a conditional recommendation (2-C) for the SV [26].
A guideline from the European Federation of Societies
for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) [9]
also recommends pre-interventional US vessel screening
of target vessels to determine the most appropriate ana-
tomical site and the optimal patient position (5-D) and
routine real-time US guidance during CVC placement
(1-A) [9].
In 2016, the Association of Anaesthetists of Great
Britain and Ireland [27] also recommended the routine
use of US for CVC placement in the IJV. In addition,
the expert group recommends US use "for all other
central venous access sites, but recognizes evidence is,
at present, limited" [27]. Nevertheless, the recommen-
dation also underlines that the understanding of the
landmark technique is necessary for situations when
US is not available.
Use of ultrasound for central venous catheter
placement in clinical practice
Several survey studies evaluated the attitudes and beliefs
of intensivists and anesthesiologists on the use of US for
CVC placement and the frequency of its use in clinical
practice.
In 2008, McGrattan et al. [28] performed a survey
among 2000 senior anesthesiologists in the United King-
dom and revealed that only 27% of these stated using
US as the first-choice approach for CVC placement in
the IJV (50% used the surface landmark technique and
30% palpation of the carotid artery as first-choice
approaches).
Among emergency physicians in the United States,
44% stated in 2014 that they never use US to guide CVC
placement [10]. On the other hand, 20% and 9% of
respondents stated using US in at least 90% and 100% of
cases, respectively.
A survey among 784 intensivists in the United States
performed in 2016 [29] revealed a moderate to very
frequent use of US depending on the site for CVC
placement ranging from 31% for the SV to 80% for the
IJV (45% for the FV). Barriers to the use of US re-
ported by these respondents were limited availability

 of US equipment (28%), perception of increased time
for US-guided CVC insertion (22%), and concerns about
losing skills for the landmark technique (13%) [29].
Among 190 French intensivists, a practice survey [30]
reported high rates of US use for CVC placement in
2016, with 18% and 50% of physicians always or almost
always, respectively, using an US-guided CVC technique
(6% never, 10% almost never, 17% half of the time).
Interestingly, a higher proportion of residents compared
with senior doctors stated always or at least almost al-
ways using US.
How to perform ultrasound-guided central venous
catheter placement? Recommendations for clinical
practice—a systematic approach
For clinical practice, we recommend a systematic ap-
proach including the following steps:
I. Identify anatomy of the insertion site and
localization of the vein.
II. Confirm patency of the vein.
III.Use real-time US guidance for puncture of the vein.
IV.Confirm needle position in the vein.
V. Confirm wire position in the vein.
VI.Confirm catheter position in the vein.
Identify anatomy of the insertion site and localization of
the vein
As a first step, one should use US to identify the anatomy
of the insertion site (vein and artery, adjacent anatomic
structures) and the localization of the target vein. This
includes checking for anatomic variations of the vessels
(both vein and artery) and the localization of the vein in
relation to the artery. This step requires combining a pro-
found knowledge about anatomic structures and landmarks
with the competencies required for US-guided CVC place-
ment (such as knowledge about probe orientation and
image display, converting the 2D US image into 3D real-
ity, and hand–eye coordination) [31]. Given the variability
in anatomic structures, this first step of US assessment is
best performed before prepping and draping of the punc-
ture site and the US probe.
The location of the vein and its anatomic relation to
the artery is best identified when using both a short-axis
(transverse) and a long-axis (longitudinal) view of the
vessels (Fig. 2a, b). This also allows identifying hypoplas-
tic veins or underfilling of the veins due to intravascular
hypovolemia (Fig. 3). To exactly differentiate between
venous and arterial vessels one can additionally perform
color Doppler imaging and apply Doppler flow measure-
ments to derive venous and arterial Doppler flow pro-
files (Fig. 4a, b).
Confirm patency of the vein
By applying pressure to the vein and thus testing its
compressibility with the US probe, one can confirm the
patency of the vein and thus exclude venous thrombosis.
Of note, in patients with very low arterial blood pressure
(systolic arterial pressure < 60 mmHg), the artery might
also be compressible [14].

 To further confirm the patency of the vein and to
quantify venous and arterial blood flow, color Doppler
imaging and Doppler flow measurements should be
performed (Fig. 4a, b).
Use real-time ultrasound guidance for puncture of the vein
CVC placement should be performed using US guidance.
This requires an aseptic approach to avoid catheter-related
bloodstream infections. An aseptic technique includes:
prepping and covering the puncture site with a large sterile
drape; wearing a hat, a mask, sterile gloves, and a sterile
body gown; covering the US probe and cable with a sterile
cover/shield; and using a sterile conductive medium
(US gel) [13, 32].
The position of the operator performing US-guided
CVC placement should be such that he/she has the in-
sertion site, the needle, and the US screen in their line
of sight during needle insertion [13]. Usually, the oper-
ator should hold the US probe with the nondominant
hand while advancing the needle with the dominant
hand. This approach is referred to as the "single-oper-
ator technique" and allows the operator to optimally
align the US plane and the direction of the needle.
These practical aspects of US-guided CVC placement
are illustrated in Fig. 5.
While advancing the needle, its tip should be con-
stantly identified with US during the needle approach to
the vein and puncture of the vein. This can be done
using a short-axis/out-of-plane view or a long-axis/in-
plane view.
Confirm needle position in the vein
The use of real-time US then allows confirmation that
the needle tip is placed centrally in the vein before ap-
proaching the guide wire (Fig. 6a, b).
Confirm wire position in the vein
As a next step after wire advancement, the correct pos-
ition of the guide wire should be confirmed in both a
short-axis and a long-axis US view (Fig. 6c, d).

site with a large sterile drape, using sterile barriers (hat, mask, sterile

cable with a sterile cover is shown. The position of the operator
(who holds the ultrasound probe with the nondominant hand while
advancing the needle with the dominant hand) allows aligning the
insertion site, the needle, and the ultrasound screen in the line of
sight during needle insertion (red lines) (Color figure online)

 Confirm catheter position in the vein
Finally, after placement of the CVC over the guide wire,
the correct position of the CVC in the vein can be
visualized with US, again in a short-axis and a long-axis
view (Fig. 6e, f).
Figure 7 summarizes the six-step approach to US-guided
CVC insertion.
How to integrate knowledge from landmark and
ultrasound techniques?
To achieve the personal best skill level for CVC place-
ment, it is crucial that one combines and integrates the
anatomic knowledge from landmark techniques and the
knowledge gained from US-guided vascular access (know-
ledge about image display and converting the 2D image
into 3D reality, and hand–eye coordination) [31]. In
this context, previous US studies provided important
information on the effect of different interventions on
the venous puncture sites.
It has been demonstrated repeatedly that positioning of
the patient in a head-down (Trendelenburg) position in-
creases the filling and thus the cross-sectional lumen of the
IJV [33]. On the contrary, to increase the lumen of the FV,
patients can be positioned in a head-up (reverse Trende-
lenburg) position [34]. Positioning of the leg in an
abducted and externally rotated position also can help to
maximize the cross-sectional diameter of the FV [35].
For the IJV, imaging studies showed that the position
of the head plays an important role in optimizing the
conditions during CVC placement. Several studies dem-
onstrated that rotation of the head to the opposite side
increases the overlap of the IJV and the carotid artery
[36–38]. In a US study, Miki et al. [37] investigated in 30
volunteers the anatomical relationship between the IJV
and the carotid artery during head rotation. The overlap

approaching the guide wire (short-axis/out-of-plane view (a) and long-axis/in-plane view (b)). In addition, the correct position of the guide wire in the
vein (short-axis (c) and long-axis (d)) and the correct position of the catheter in the vein (short-axis (e) and long-axis (f)) should be confirmed

 of the IJV and the carotid artery gradually increased with
increasing rotation of the head to the left. In parallel,
however, the flattening of the IJV decreased with head
rotation to the left. DeAngelis et al. [39] described that
the IJV becomes more vertically separated from the ca-
rotid artery at more extreme angles of contralateral head
rotation. These findings underline that US should be
used in each individual patient to assess the optimal
angle of head rotation and best approach to the IJV.
Technical developments in the field of
ultrasound-guided vascular access
Needle guides are devices placed on the US transducer
that might improve the cannulation success by facilitating
aligning the angle between the US and the needle
plane so that the two planes intersect at the depth of
the vessel selected for cannulation [40]. Especially for
inexperienced users [41], the needle guides help to
guide the needle along the path of the US beam at the
correct angle and distance depending on the depth of
the targeted structure. Needle guides facilitate faster
cannulation for IJV CVCs (only for inexperienced op-
erators) [42] and SV CVCs [40]. Nevertheless, in a
simulation model study, a needle guide used in a long-
axis vessel approach improved needle visualization but
did not improve puncture of the target vessel compared
with a free-hand technique [43]. Altogether, based on the
contradicting evidence [43, 44], no rigorous conclusion

 about the clinical value of needle guide devices can
currently be drawn.
Different real-time 3D techniques (sometimes referred
to as 4D US with time being the fourth dimension) for
US-guided CVC placement have been described [45, 46].
Lower image resolution, larger US probe dimensions, and
artifacts making needle visualization difficult, however, are
still major limitations of this innovative concept [46].
Limitations of ultrasound-guided central venous
catheter placement
Although US is noninvasive and thus does not bear a
risk to directly harm the patient, some limitations and
disadvantages of US during central venous access are
worth considering.
One might argue that the risk of catheter-related
bloodstream infections might be higher if US is used for
CVC placement without applying a strict aseptic approach
as already described [47]. In addition, an insufficient num-
ber of US machines in a certain unit (intensive care unit
or anesthesia induction area) might cause procedural
delays [47]. Moreover, it is expensive to purchase and
maintain US machines and to provide adequate training
for all operators involved in CVC placement [47].
US might give the inexperienced user a false sense of
security and mislead him/her to neglect traditionally
taught principles with regard to needle direction. It is key
to visualize the needle (or needle tip) constantly during
needle advancement to avoid accidental arterial puncture,
posterior wall penetration, or pneumothorax. In addition,
rapid movements with the needle during "searching the
needle on the US screen" must be avoided rigorously. To
overcome these problems related to insufficient US skills
and to ensure high-quality care, formal education and
training (including simulation) with a structured certifica-
tion of US skills for vascular access and the development
of a consensus standard for these training programs has
been suggested [13].
Moreover, concerns have been expressed that routine
US use will result in a "de-skilling" with regard to the
landmark techniques because these techniques will not
be taught and practiced anymore, thus resulting in higher
complication rates when CVCs need to be placed when
US is not available (e.g., in emergencies) [47].
Besides these general limitations, different problems
specific for the different anatomical sites for CVC place-
ment might occur during US-guided CVC placement. In
patients with a shorter neck anatomy, the long-axis US
view of the IJV might be difficult to obtain. Although
the FV can usually be visualized easily using US in adults,
in severely obese patients a second operator might be
necessary to provide access to the inguinal region. In
addition, a curved-array abdominal US probe can be
necessary for visualizing deeper anatomic structures. In
comparison to the IJV and FV, the anatomic location
and course of the SV under the clavicle bone can be
more difficult to visualize using US. Smaller US probes
can facilitate US-guided access to the SV [48, 49]. Of
note, the use of US to puncture the SV results in a
puncture site that is usually more lateral compared to
the landmark puncture technique. The close proximity
of the vessels and the pleura must be kept in mind also
during US-guided puncture of the SV. Because the
angle of cannulation is usually steeper when using US, it is
especially important to align and constantly visualize the
needle to avoid pleural injury.
Conclusion
US guidance can improve patient safety and procedural
quality during CVC placement in the IJV, FV, and SV.
Based on evidence from clinical studies, several guide-
lines of medical societies strongly recommend the use of
US for CVC placement in the IJV. Data from survey
studies show that there is still a gap between the existing
evidence and guidelines and the use of US in clinical
practice. We recommend a six-step systematic approach
for US-guided central venous access. To achieve the best
skill level for CVC placement the knowledge from ana-
tomic landmark techniques and the knowledge from
US-guided CVC placement need to be combined and
integrated.
