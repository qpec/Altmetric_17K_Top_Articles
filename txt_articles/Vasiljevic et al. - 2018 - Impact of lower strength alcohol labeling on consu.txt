Objective: Labels indicating low/light versions of tobacco and foods are perceived as less harmful, which
may encourage people to consume more. There is an absence of evidence concerning the impact on
consumption of labeling alcohol products as lower in strength. The current study tests the hypothesis that
labeling wine and beer as lower in alcohol increases their consumption. Method: Weekly wine and beer
drinkers (n � 264) sampled from a representative panel of the general population of England were
randomized to one of three groups to taste test drinks in a bar-laboratory varying only in the label
displayed; Group 1: verbal descriptor Super Low combined with 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) for
wine/1% ABV for beer; Group 2: verbal descriptor Low combined with 8% ABV for wine/3% ABV for
beer; Group 3: no verbal descriptors of strength (Regular). Primary outcome was total volume (ml) of
drink consumed. Results: The results supported the study hypothesis: the total amount of drink consumed
increased as the label on the drink denoted successively lower alcohol strength, BLin � .71, p � .015,
95% CI [0.13, 1.30]. Group contrasts showed significant differences between those offered drinks labeled
as Super Low (M � 213.77) compared with Regular (M � 176.85), B � 1.43, p � .019, 95% CI [0.24,
2.61]. There was no significant difference in amount consumed between those offered drinks labeled as
Low compared with Regular. Conclusions: These results suggest that labeling drinks as lower in strength
increases the amount consumed. Further studies are warranted to test for replication in non-laboratory
settings and to estimate whether any effects are at a level with the potential to harm health. Trial

 Alcohol is the fifth leading cause of mortality and morbidity
both in the United Kingdom and globally (Burton et al., 2017;
Sassi, 2015). One approach to reducing alcohol consumption and
associated harms is the development, promotion, and marketing of
lower alcohol products (Department of Health, 2012). Current
legislation across the European Union (EU) limits the use of low/er
alcohol descriptors to drinks of 1.2% alcohol by volume (ABV)
and lower, with similar restrictions found globally (see Canadian
Food Inspection Agency, 2017; Food Standards Australia & New
Zealand, 2014; The European Parliament and the Council of the
European Union, 2011). Current regulations surrounding the re-
stricted use of terms denoting lower alcohol to promote such
products will end in 2018 providing a timely opportunity to con-
sider whether extending the range of alcohol strengths to which
they can be applied can contribute to policies designed to reduce
alcohol consumption across the population. This interest is cap-
tured in the most recent U.K. Government Alcohol Strategy pub-
lished in March, 2012, that, among other policies, included an
industry pledge through the Responsibility Deal to take one billion
units of alcohol out of the market by 2015, primarily through
increasing consumer selection of lower alcohol products (Depart-
ment of Health, 2012).
One of the strategies considered to reduce the alcohol units on
the market is to allow the industry to use a wider variety of low/er
strength alcohol labels to promote more widely products with
alcohol content lower than the current average on the market (U.K.
averages: 12.9% for wine and 4.2% for beer; Department of
Health, 2014), but higher than the currently legislated limit of
1.2% ABV. While current sales data show that the alcohol market
is dominated by regular/standard (average) strength products (De-
partment of Health, 2014), recent years have seen a growing
interest from consumers in lower strength and no-alcohol products.
This is especially noticeable in high income countries such as the
United Kingdom, USA, Canada, and Germany (“Big brewers see
strong potential for weak beer,” 2016; Wine Intelligence, 2013).
Increasing consumer selection of lower strength alcohol products
in place of regular strength products forms part of a wider policy
approach to regulate the availability of alcohol (including physi-
cally restricting density of outlets, reducing the hours and days of
sale, regulating the minimum legal purchase age, and offering
different availability by alcohol strength; for comprehensive re-
views of this and other alcohol policies see Babor et al., 2010;
Burton et al., 2017).
For lower strength alcohol products to reduce consumption
depends upon these products being selected in place of equal
volumes of higher strength products as opposed to simply increas-
ing the number of occasions perceived suitable for alcohol con-
sumption (see also Anderson & Rehm, 2016; Rehm, Lachenmeier,
Llopis, Imtiaz, & Anderson, 2016; Vasiljevic, Coulter, Petticrew,
& Marteau, 2018). To achieve this, such labels must not engender
a self-licensing effect, that is give people permission to consume
more when given what might be interpreted as a virtuous product.
In the current context, a lower strength alcohol product might be
seen as virtuous and, if it leads to self-licensing could result in
consumption of more alcohol than would have been consumed
from a higher strength product alone (Khan & Dhar, 2006; Shem-
ilt, Hendry, & Marteau, 2017).
A recent systematic review by Shemilt and colleagues (2017)
summarizing studies of product labeling denoting low content in
food (k � 19) and tobacco (k � 6), found the potential for
self-licensing effects by showing that low content labels can alter
people’s perceptions concerning the content of products, and what
they judge to be an appropriate serving (in food). However, there
was an absence of evidence regarding the behavioral impact of
such labels, and no studies on alcohol content labeling were
identified.
The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of lower
strength alcohol labeling on consumption and test the hypothesis
that labeling alcohol products to denote lower levels of alcohol by
volume increases consumption. For the purposes of this study we
used two different labels denoting lower alcohol strength. Low and
Super Low are the two verbal descriptors denoting lower alcohol
strength used in the current study, based on a previous study in
which these were found to be the terms that most differentiated
alcohol products of low and lower strengths (Vasiljevic, Couturier,
& Marteau, 2018). In this initial study, we found that a sample of
1,600 weekly wine and beer drinkers from the U.K. population,
perceived the verbal descriptors Low, Lower, Light, Lighter, and
Reduced as similar and lower in strength (wine: 6.7–8.3%, beer:
2.7–3.1%) than the descriptor Regular (average % ABV), but
higher in strength than the descriptors Extra Low, Super Low,
Extra Light, and Super Light (wine: 3.5–4.8%, beer: 1.3–2.2%).
These latter descriptors were perceived as similar (see Vasiljevic,
Couturier et al., 2018). Furthermore, among the two perceptual
clusters, the descriptors Low and Super Low were the most differ-
entiated and were thus used in the current study.
In the present research, the verbal descriptor Low was coupled
with 8% ABV in wine and 3% ABV in beer. The verbal descriptor
Super Low was coupled with 4% ABV in wine and 1% ABV in
beer. In addition to these values corresponding to the perceptions
of strength in the previous study, we judged them to also have the
greatest face validity. The two lower strength labels were con-
trasted to a Regular label, denoting the average % ABV available
in the United Kingdom (12.9% for wine and 4.2% for beer), with
no verbal descriptor of strength (which is how they are presented
for sale). Only the labels placed against the drinks differed be-
tween participants, according to randomization, with all other
variables held constant.
Method
Design
A between-subjects experiment with one independent factor of
three levels corresponding to the label that accompanies drinks
(wine or beer) for consumption. Participants were assigned to taste
either wine or beer according to stated prior preference at recruit-
ment. They were then randomly allocated to one of three groups to
taste test three glasses of their preferred drink, with all three
glasses having one of three possible labels—Group 1: label dis-
playing the verbal descriptor Super Low combined with either 4%
ABV for wine or 1% ABV for beer; Group 2: label displaying the
verbal descriptor Low combined with either 8% ABV for wine or
3% ABV for beer; or Group 3: label displaying no verbal descrip-
tor of strength and showing the average % ABV of the drink
currently on sale in the United Kingdom, corresponding to a
standard/regular drink: 12.9% for wine and 4.2% for beer.

LOWER STRENGTH ALCOHOL LABELING
 Participants
Two hundred and sixty-four weekly wine and beer drinkers
were sampled from an existing representative panel of the general
population of England. The representative panel was provided by
a market research agency (https://www.icmunlimited.com/). Ac-
cording to prior stated preference, we sampled 132 wine drinkers
and 132 beer drinkers. Participant inclusion criteria included
healthy adults (above 18 years of age), weekly consumption of
alcohol, and a preference for either wine or beer. Exclusion criteria
included pregnancy (women only), current medication use (includ-
ing antibiotics), and a history of neurological or psychiatric disor-
ders. Eligible weekly wine and beer drinkers taste tested either
wine or beer according to their drink preference. Once their eligi-
bility for the study and drink preference was ascertained, they were
randomized to one of the three experimental groups varying in the
labels used to describe the drinks they were invited to taste, but not
in the actual drinks (see Design).
Within the two groups of participants that preferred wine and
those that preferred beer, we stratified randomization to the three
experimental groups by setting interlocking quotas for age, gender,
and socioeconomic status (SES). SES classification was based on
an index of occupational status using the U.K. Registrar General’s
social classification with participants divided into three SES
groups (see Rose & Pevalin, 2001): higher managerial and pro-
fessional [high], white collar and skilled manual [medium], and
semi-skilled and unskilled manual [low]. Setting these quotas
allowed us to obtain roughly equal numbers of participants of
different ages, genders, and SES status across the three experi-
mental groups in order to explore the moderating effects of these
variables on the effect of lower strength alcohol labeling. Within
each interlocking quota block (comprising a combination of type
of drink, age, gender and SES), participants were randomized to
one of the three experimental groups by means of an algorithm
implemented using R software by the study statistician (DLC)
before recruitment of participants commenced.
The randomization allocation to experimental group was con-
cealed from the market research agency recruiters who assigned
participants to a unique participation number according to their
drink preference, age, gender, and SES membership. Participants
were blinded to assignment of experimental group (open-ended
questions at the end of the testing session confirmed that partici-
pants were not aware of the study hypotheses and were not aware
that the labeling of alcohol strength was manipulated across dif-
ferent groups). For demographic and other individual difference
characteristics of our sample see Table 1 below. Randomization
was successful; there were no significant differences between the
three experimental groups on any of the characteristics. The final
sample size of 264 participants provided 90% power at 5% level of
significance to detect a medium sized effect (0.5 SD) in consump-
tion between the Regular label (no verbal descriptor of strength
given) and one of the “low alcohol” (Super Low or Low) labels.
Our power calculations were based on studies using a similar
taste-preference task design carried out in the same bar lab setting
with medium effect sizes, which examined consumption of pla-
cebo drinks in participants exposed to a Drinkaware poster versus
a control condition (Moss et al., 2015).
Measures
Primary outcome.
Total volume of drink consumed (in ml)
was the primary outcome. The total volume of drink poured into
each glass was measured using high precision scales (Smart Weigh
Model PL11B). In order to ascertain how much of the drinks
participants consumed, the liquid remaining in the glasses at the
end of the study period was measured using the same scales and
subtracted from the initial total volume poured into the glasses.
Secondary outcomes: Product appeal.
Two items measured
participants’ appeal of the product they saw: “How likely are you
to buy this wine/beer?” and “How likely are you to drink this
wine/beer?” (both items were answered on scales running from
1 � very unlikely to 7 � very likely), r � .87, p � .001.
Secondary outcomes: Understanding of alcohol strength.
Three items measured participants’ understanding of the alcohol
strength of the product. The first item gauged participants’ knowl-
edge of whether the wine/beer they saw could be safely consumed
by children: “This wine/beer can be safely drunk by children aged
over 12. Do you agree with this statement?” Responses were
recorded on a scale from 1 � strongly disagree to 7 � strongly
agree. Participants’ responses were dichotomized whereby any
level of disagreement with the statement was considered correct,
and any level of agreement as incorrect.
The second item gauged participants’ understanding of how
many drinks of the wine or beer they could have without exceeding
the drink-driving legal limit: “How many small glasses (125 ml) of
this wine/half pints of this beer do you think you could have and
still drive within the legal limit?” Responses were recorded on a
0–20 slider. To determine the accuracy of participants’ responses,
we calculated how many half pints of beer or small glasses (125
ml) of wine participants could drink and still drive within the legal
driving limit for the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland). This
was done for all the different levels of % ABV, compiling scores
separately for men and women, and based on a person with
average weight and metabolism (for more details on the calcula-
tions, see the online supplementary materials).
The third item gauged participants’ understanding of unit con-
tent of the drink they were shown: “How many units of alcohol do
you think a small glass (125ml)/half pint of this wine/beer would
have?” Responses were recorded on a 0–20 slider. For analysis we
determined the actual number of units contained in each of the
drinks according to its purported % ABV (see online supplemen-
tary materials).
Secondary outcomes: Calorie content.
Perception of the cal-
orie content of the presented drink was assessed by one item: “The
recommended daily calorie intake from food and drinks for men is
2,500 calories (kcal), and for women 2,000 calories (kcal). How
many calories (kcal) do you think a small glass (125ml)/half pint
of this wine/beer has?” Responses were open-ended, but con-
strained to responses ranging from 0 to 2,500.
Secondary outcomes: Guilt associated with consumption.
One item based on Wansink and Chandon (2006): “How guilty
would you feel after consuming a small glass (125ml)/half pint of
this wine/beer?” Answers were recorded on scales from 1 � not
guilty to 9 � guilty.
Other measures: Risky drinking.
This was assessed using
the AUDIT-C (Bush, Kivlahan, McDonell, Fihn, & Bradley,
1998), which comprises the first three items of the Alcohol Use
660
VASILJEVIC ET AL.
 Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor, Higgins-Biddle,
Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001). A sample item asked “How many
drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you
are drinking?” with response options ranging from 1 or 2, 3 or 4,
5 or 6, 7 to 9, 10 or more. Following recommendations by Public
Health England (2017), responses to the AUDIT-C were summed
and dichotomized to denote riskier (scoring above 5) versus less
risky drinking patterns (scoring below 5).
Other measures: Motivation to reduce consumption.
Three
items were used to measure intentions and desire to drink less
within the next six months: “Thinking about the next 6 months: I
intend to drink less alcohol/I want to drink less alcohol/I will try to
drink less alcohol” Responses were recorded on 7-point scales
ranging from 1 � strongly disagree to 7 � strongly agree, Cron-
bach’s alpha � .93.
Other measures: Self-licensing.
Two items assessed “self-
licensing” that is, participants’ self-reported deservingness to act
indulgently following what might be interpreted as a virtuous
choice: “If I were to have a low alcohol drink, I would feel like I
deserved to have something stronger for my next drink” and “If I
were to have a low alcohol drink, I would feel like I could have
more than my usual number of drinks.” The items were rated on
7-point scales ranging from 1 � strongly disagree to 7 � strongly
agree, r � .34, p � .001.
Other measures: Demographic characteristics.
The fol-
lowing were recorded: age, gender, ethnicity, and SES (assessed
using individual-level measures of highest educational qualifi-
cation, income and occupational status, and area-level (i.e.,
neighborhood) deprivation assessed from postcode information
and transformed into an Index of Multiple Deprivation, IMD;
see Oguz, Merad, & Snape, 2013). The IMD is the official
measure of relative deprivation for small areas (or neighbor-
hoods) in England, which ranks every small area in England
from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844 (least deprived area).
This ranking is then transformed into either quintiles or deciles
of area-level deprivation for use in analyses.

LOWER STRENGTH ALCOHOL LABELING
 Procedure
The study was approved by the University of Cambridge’s
Psychology Research Ethics Committee [PRE.2015.083], and the
London South Bank University Research Ethics Committee
[UREC 1468]. The flow of participants through the study can be
seen in the CONSORT flow diagram below (see Figure 1).
The study was conducted in a laboratory setting mimicking a bar
environment, located within a university psychology department in
England. The bar lab is a purpose-built testing room resembling a
typical pub environment, featuring a 4.5 m bar, optics, bar taps,
bottles, a slot machine, bar stools, and appropriate wall hangings
(see Figure S1 in online supplementary materials). Testing took
place during weekdays in 30-min slots between 12.00 and 20.00.
Recruitment took place from November 2016 to March 2017.
Participants were recruited from an existing nationally represen-
tative panel. Participants were contacted via e-mail and telephone
by a market research agency recruiter who ascertained their eligi-
bility for the study (see also Participants section).
Upon arrival at the bar lab, participants were told they were
undertaking a taste-preference task in which they would rate the
quality of different alcoholic beverages. Participants then provided
their written consent to participate in the study, at which point they
were breathalyzed with a Lion Alcometer 600 (Lion Laboratories,
Barry, U.K.). Anyone testing positive (above 0 breath alcohol
concentration, BrAC) on the breathalyzer was deemed ineligible
and stopped from further participation (see CONSORT Flow in
Figure 1).
Participants first took part in a sham taste-preference task, which
served as a cover story and allowed us to gauge participants’
consumption of the beverages without revealing the true purpose
of the study (see Moss et al., 2015; Stautz, Frings, Albery, Moss,
& Marteau, 2017). The taste-preference task is a validated method
for assessing alcohol consumption in laboratory studies, which has
also been validated as an analogue for participants’ real-world
alcohol use outside of the lab (see Jones et al., 2016). Participants
were seated at the bar-counter during the taste test. To avoid
possible ceiling effects, wine drinkers were provided with three
glasses of wine with 125 ml in each glass (strength 5.5% ABV),
and beer drinkers were provided with three glasses of beer with
250 ml in each glass (strength 2.8% ABV). The labels comprised
small pieces of card placed in front of the glasses. The study used
a between-subjects design, which necessitated all three glasses to
be labeled with the same label. A cover story was therefore used
purporting that the three glasses of wine or beer came from the
same producer, used the same ingredients, but were fermented in
vessels made from different materials, which can affect taste.
Thus, for example, a participant who preferred wine and was
randomized to experimental Group 2, which denoted a Low
strength label (see Design) would have been presented with three
glasses of wine all labeled as Low 8% ABV, with the cards in front

A, B, or C. The task of the participants was to rate the three
samples A, B, and C (see Figure S2 in online supplementary
materials for an example set-up of the taste test in one experimen-
tal group). A glass containing 250 ml of water was available as a
palate cleanser. Participants were asked to rate how pleasant,
strong tasting, sweet, and fizzy the drinks are (adapted from Field
& Eastwood, 2005; see online supplementary materials for the full
instructions regarding the taste test). Participants were told they
could drink as much or as little as they liked to make their ratings
and were informed that the taste test lasts 10 min. The experi-
menter remained in the bar laboratory for the duration of the taste
test.
After the taste test, the drinks were removed, and the partici-
pants were given a second questionnaire which contained the
secondary outcomes, and the demographic and individual differ-
ence measures. At the end of the study procedures, participants
were debriefed about the true nature of the study, and we revealed
that all the drinks tasted were of “lower alcohol” strength including
in the condition where the labels purported the drinks to be of
regular strength. At this point, participants underwent another
breathalyzer test to gauge their intoxication. Participants who were
above the English driving limit (35 micrograms of alcohol per 100
milliliters of BrAC) were asked to stay in the lab until the effects
of the alcohol had dissipated or to take public transportation when
leaving the lab. Once participants left the bar laboratory, the fluid
they did not consume was measured (allowing a calculation of
fluid consumed). Participants were reimbursed with a 30-pound
(circa 37 USD) check for their participation. The trial protocol was
registered with the ISRCTN registry and can be accessed via the
following reference number ISRCTN15530806.
Analysis
Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used with
linear trends (linear trend: �1 � Regular, 0 � Low, �1 � Super
Low) to examine whether reduced levels of alcohol strength as
denoted by labels was associated with a linear increase in con-
sumption and a linear change in self-reported indices of appeal and
understanding of strength. To understand differences between
lower and regular labels, we performed contrast analyses by re-
gressing the transformed consumption data on two dummy vari-
ables representing the experimental conditions (Low: D1 � 1,
D2 � 0; Super Low: D1 � 0, D2 � 1; Regular: D1 � 0, D2 � 0),
and a dummy variable denoting the type of drink (wine: D3 � 0;
beer: D3 � 1), using percentile bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples
to derive parameter estimates. We applied a Holm-Šídák correc-
tion to adjust alpha for the familywise error; all significant com-
parisons exceeded the adjusted alpha level.
Results
Primary Outcome
An examination of the data revealed five univariate outliers who
consumed more than 605 ml (� �
x � 3SD) of fluid in total;
therefore, these outliers were substituted with the next highest
value in the distribution 588 ml (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). The
data for the primary outcome were positively skewed; hence, we
performed a square root transformation of the data, which approx-
imated the distribution to normal. Untransformed data are provided
for descriptive statistics for clarity.
The results showed a significant linear trend whereby the total
amount of drink consumed increased as the label on the drink
denoted successively lower alcohol strength, BLin � .71, SE � .30,
p � .015, 95% CI [0.13, 1.30] (see Figure 2). Planned contrasts
revealed that participants drank more beer (M � 249.19, SD �
139.41) than wine (M � 140.96, SD � 84.31), BD3 � 3.77, SE �
.51, p � .001, 95% CI [2.78, 4.76]. Participants also drank more
when the drinks were labeled as Super Low alcohol strength (M �
213.77, SD � 124.05) when compared with the drinks labeled as
Regular (M � 176.85, SD � 116.41), BD2 � 1.43, SE � .61, p �
.019, 95% CI [0.24, 2.61]. In contrast, participants’ consumption
of drinks labeled as Low alcohol strength (M � 194.60, SD �
138.65) did not differ from participants’ consumption of drinks
labeled as Regular (M � 176.85, SD � 116.41), BD1 � .59, SE �
.63, p � .340, 95% CI [�0.66, 1.80]. See Table 2 and Table 3 for
the full models described above. We performed several sensitivity
tests (a) by controlling for total consumption of water during the
taste test; (b) by using z standardized scores to indicate the amount
consumed for wine and beer; and (c) running a robust regression
on the raw untransformed data (Heritier, Cantoni, Copt, &
Victoria-Feser, 2009), which yielded the same pattern of results as
reported above.
We repeated the above analysis while adding gender (female:
D4 � 0; male: D4 � 1), age (18–44 years: D5 � 0, 45–70 years:
D5 � 1), SES occupational status (linear trend: �1 � low, �1 �
high) as predictors (i.e., main effects) and as moderators (i.e.,
2-way interactions) of (a) the linear trend and, in separate analyses,
(b) the contrasts of the experimental conditions (Low: D1 � 1,
D2 � 0; Super Low: D1 � 0, D2 � 1; Regular: D1 � 0, D2 � 0).
As in the primary models, the effect of drink persisted: participants
drank more beer than wine overall. In addition, there was a
significant main effect of gender, whereby men (M � 237.28,
SD � 136.87) drank more compared with women (M � 152.86,
SD � 100.60), when (a) the linear trend of experimental groups
was entered in the model: BD4 � 1.90, SE � .60, p � .002, 95%
CI [0.74, 3.07]; and (b) when contrasts between experimental
groups were examined: BD4 � 2.73, SE � .94, p � .004, 95% CI
[0.86, 4.58]. The linear trend of label, BLin � 1.05, SE � .43, p �

 .016, 95% CI [0.18, 1.93] remained unaltered, as did the contrast
between the Super Low and Regular label, BD2 � 2.11, SE � .87,
p � .016, 95% CI [0.34, 3.79]. While the effect sizes were
unaltered, they were rendered statistically nonsignificant when
applying a Holm-Šídák multiplicity correction due to the large
number of predictors included in the model. No other effects were
statistically significant after multiplicity correction.
We repeated the above analysis including SES education (linear
trend: �1.5 � lowest quartile, �1.5 � highest quartile); SES
income (linear trend: �1.5 � lowest quartile, �1.5 � highest
quartile); SES index of multiple deprivation (linear trend: �2 �
lowest quintile, �2 � highest quintile); risky drinking (not risky:
D8 � 0; risky: D8 � 1); motivation to reduce consumption (con-
tinuous, centered); and self-licensing (continuous, centered) as
predictors and as moderators of (a) the linear trend and (b) the
contrasts of the experimental conditions. The effect sizes of drink
and gender observed in the previous models remained unaltered,
but were no longer statistically significant after applying multi-
plicity corrections due to the larger number of predictors. Simi-
larly, the linear trend of label, BLin � 2.23, SE � 0.80, p � .004,
95% CI [0.72, 3.80] was unaffected, as was the contrast between
the Super Low and Regular label, BD2 � 4.67, SE � 1.66, p �
.004, 95% CI [1.62, 8.10]. As before, these effects were rendered
statistically nonsignificant after applying the Holm-Šídák multi-
plicity correction. The only significant effect that remained after
multiplicity correction was a main effect of risky drinking: risky
drinkers drank more than nonrisky drinkers, BD8 � 2.46, SE �
0.72, p � .001, 95% CI [1.00, 3.83]. However, this effect only
emerged in the regression modeling differences between experi-
mental conditions as a linear trend. Appendix 4 in the online
supplementary materials contains tables showing the full models
fitted described above.
Secondary Outcomes
Product appeal was negatively skewed so we performed a log-
arithmic transformation on the inversed scores, which approxi-
mated the distribution to normal. We repeated the same regression
analysis described above, which yielded no significant results.
Adding age, gender, and SES occupational status to the model as
predictors and as moderators of the linear trend and the contrasts
also yielded no significant effects.
Understanding of alcohol strength and calorie estimation.
The items gauging participants’ understanding of alcohol strength
and calorie estimation were transformed so that participants’ rat-
ings were compared with the factually correct answer (see online
supplementary materials for all transformations and graphical pre-
sentation of the results). When modeling the log odds of the correct
understanding of strength, logistic regressions showed no signifi-
cant linear trend, nor significant contrasts in understanding
whether a drink is appropriate for consumption by children, with
all participants displaying a similarly high understanding regard-
less of the drink label (%SuperLow � 71; %Low � 77; %Regular �
75).
There was a significant linear trend in the level of understanding
of the drink-drive limit; participants’ understanding increased as
the rate of alcohol strength decreased, BLin � 17.81, SE � .40, p �
.001, 95% CI [16.85, 18.43]. Planned contrasts revealed that
participants who saw the Super Low and Low labels (%SuperLow �
100; %Low � 100) were more accurate when compared with
participants seeing the Regular label (%Regular � 89), BD2 �
19.15, SE � .39, p � .001, 95% CI [18.21, 19.74]; BD1 � 19.15,
SE � .39, p � .001, 95% CI [18.23, 19.75].
There was also a significant linear trend in the level of under-
standing of unit content in the different drinks, whereby partici-
pants’ underestimation of the alcohol units increased with in-
creased alcohol strength, BLin � 1.15, SE � .24, p � .001, 95% CI
[0.74, 1.69]. Planned contrasts revealed that participants seeing the
Super Low label (%SuperLow � 99) were significantly more accu-
rate at unit estimation when compared with those randomized to
the Regular label condition (%Regular � 75), BD2 � 3.37, SE �
8.24, p � .002, 95% CI [2.03, 20.48]. Those seeing the Low label
fell in between these two conditions (%Low � 84), though the
contrast between the Low and Regular label did not reach signif-
icance, p � .140.
There was no statistically significant linear trend in the estima-
tion of calories; however, contrast analyses revealed that partici-
pants seeing the Low label (%Low � 94) were less likely to
underestimate the amount of calories when compared with those in
the Regular label condition (%Regular � 80), BD1 � 1.45, SE �
1.39, p � .003, 95% CI [0.53, 2.98]. Those seeing the Super Low
label fell in the middle (%Low � 90), though the contrast between
the Super Low and Regular label did not reach significance, p �
.064.
Guilt.
There were no significant linear trends nor significant
contrasts between the label conditions in the amount of self-
reported guilt attached to consuming the given drinks.
Discussion
Participants drank most when drinks were labeled as Super Low
and least when labeled as Regular strength. Age, gender, SES,
risky drinking, motivation to reduce consumption, and self-
licensing did not moderate these effects. There were no significant
differences in appeal between the different experimental condi-

 tions. Understanding of alcohol strength and calorie content was
generally good.
We tested participants in a bar laboratory enabling us to have
strict control over the testing environment. However, the bar
laboratory is still a laboratory setting housed in a university de-
partment, and therefore, the consumption behaviors displayed by
participants may not fully reflect how drinkers would respond to
lower strength alcohol labeling in real-world drinking settings,
such as actual bars, restaurants, public events (gigs, concerts,
sporting events), as well as off-license settings such as in the
home. Future replications should therefore test the effects of lower
strength alcohol labeling in these real-world environments.
Our primary outcome was measured as part of a 10-min taste
test, a commonly used validated measure in laboratory studies of
alcohol consumption (Jones et al., 2016). Nonetheless, naturalistic
consumption of alcohol differs from this in several ways that might
affect consumption of different strengths of alcohol. Time is one
such difference. The time taken to consume a drink is usually
longer than 10 min. It is possible that the observed greater con-
sumption of drinks labeled as lower strength may only be apparent
over a short time-period if drinkers pace their intake of the higher
strength alcohol, with the lower strength alcohol being consumed
at a faster pace (see Higgs, Stafford, Attwood, Walker, & Terry,
2008). However, since participants across all three experimental
groups were given the same alcoholic drink with alcohol strength
held constant while only varying the labels presented, we could
reject the hypothesis that participants paced their drinking rate and
consumption because of the pharmacological cues they could
detect in the drinks as in the Higgs and colleagues’ study (2008).
Nevertheless, future studies should extend the current research to
incorporate longer testing periods, while also examining other
relevant outcomes such as consumption duration, sip-rate, and
sip-duration in order to better understand the impact of lower
strength alcohol labeling.
Furthermore, while people may drink more if drinks are
labeled as lower in strength, we do not know if this is sufficient
to result in the consumption of more units of alcohol overall
from lower strength alcohol drinks. Our study was not set up to
test this since we held the strength of the alcohol constant
across experimental groups. Future studies should manipulate
the alcohol strength in conjunction with manipulating the labels
to examine this question.
This is the first study to examine the impact of lower strength
alcohol labeling on actual consumption. The findings from this
study have important ramifications for current discussions between
industry and policymakers who are interested in reducing the total
level of alcohol consumed by extending the % ABV range of
products that are allowed to carry lower strength alcohol labels
beyond the currently legislated cap of 1.2% ABV (Department of
Health, 2012). We found that participants consumed successively
greater amounts of wine and beer when labels communicated
successively lower alcohol strengths consistent with a self-
licensing effect. These findings suggest that further research is
needed to determine whether policies extending the range of lower
strength alcohol labels could have unintended consequences such
as increasing the total amount of alcohol consumed in the policy
jurisdiction (Khan & Dhar, 2006; Shemilt et al., 2017). Despite a
clear interest from the industry and policymakers to extend the
range of % ABV and the verbal descriptors that could be used to
denote lower alcohol strength on alcohol labels (Department of
Health, 2012), little is known about the ironic effects on consump-
tion revealed in the present research (see also Anderson & Rehm,
2016; Rehm et al., 2016; Vasiljevic, Coulter, et al., 2018). Since
this is the first study to examine this issue, replications and
extensions are needed to ascertain the potential for lower strength
alcohol labeling to exert a paradoxical effect that is detrimental to
public health.
Importantly, although there was a significant linear trend
whereby participants drank successively more alcohol volume
with decreasing label strength, the contrast between the Low and
Regular groups did not reach statistical significance. This may
reflect a true null effect or insufficient power to detect a smaller
effect size. From a policy perspective, it will be important for
future studies to have sufficient power to estimate smaller effect
sizes given more products are likely to be labeled Low as opposed
to Super Low, and given that the potential harm arising from
overconsumption of such products would be greater from products
of Low strength as opposed to products of Super Low strength.
We also examined whether demographic characteristics or the
assessed individual difference variables affected alcohol consump-
tion. Gender and risky drinking (as measured by the AUDIT-C)
predicted alcohol consumption: men and those classified as riskier
drinkers consumed more alcohol. However, neither gender nor
risky drinking moderated the effects of lower strength alcohol
labeling on consumption, suggesting that different types of drink-
ers were not differentially affected by the labels. None of the other
demographic or individual difference variables measured in the
present study moderated the effects of labeling on alcohol con-
sumption. These initial findings therefore suggest that lower
strength alcohol labeling may have similar effects across different
groups in the population. To provide more robust evidence for a
null effect, future studies should also test for moderating variables,
in studies with larger sample sizes and examining more diverse
groups of participants.
In the present research, there were no significant differences in
levels of self-reported appeal. This is not surprising since partici-
pants in all three experimental groups were given the same wine/
beer with only the labels differing between participants. If any-
thing these effects speak to the successful manipulation of labeling
while keeping the drinks constant, which allowed us to control for
possible confounding influences that may have arisen if we used
different drinks across the different groups. Nevertheless, future
research could examine differential effects of manipulating both
the drinks’ labels and the drinks themselves.
The dissociation between self-reported appeal and actual con-
sumption of the drinks could indicate that labeling of lower alcohol
strength impacts people’s behaviors largely via implicit processes
without conscious awareness (see Strack & Deutsch, 2004). This
suggests that labels that do not highlight the lower alcohol content
of drinks may be more effective in reducing consumption than
those in which the lower alcohol content is highlighted (in line
with prior findings by Geller, Kalsher, & Clarke, 1991). This
hypothesis merits testing.
Understanding of alcohol strength and calorie content was gen-
erally high across experimental conditions with the majority of
participants correctly identifying or erring on the side of caution
regarding consumption of the products by children aged over 12,
drinking within the legal driving limit, the number of units in a
665
LOWER STRENGTH ALCOHOL LABELING
 given drink, and the amount of calories in a drink. If anything, the
present research suggests that participants were more accurate at
judging the alcohol and calorie content of drinks labeled with
verbal and numerical descriptors denoting lower strength than
drinks denoting regular (average) strength. However, the diverging
findings on self-reported understanding of strength and actual
consumption suggest that, although lower strength alcohol labeling
may improve explicit understanding of the content of alcohol
drinks, this improved understanding may not translate into actual
reduced consumption of alcohol, most likely due to self-licensing
processes as described earlier.
Strengths and Limitations
This is the first study to examine the impact of lower strength
alcohol labels on consumption. Measuring a behavioral outcome is
one of the main strengths of this study. The study is further
strengthened by following the principles of randomized controlled
trials and sampling weekly wine and beer drinkers from a repre-
sentative panel of the English population. Furthermore, the study
was conducted in a bar lab setting mimicking a real bar, lending
face validity to the main outcome. However, as noted above the
experimental setting is also a limitation of the study, since we had
to prioritize experimental control over ecological validity. More-
over, the study only measured consumption over a limited time
period under the pretext of a taste test of new alcohol products
coming on the market. Future studies should examine more long-
term effects of lower strength alcohol labeling, employing longi-
tudinal designs, as well as replicating the current findings in real
world settings.
A further limitation is the single-item nature of some of the
secondary outcomes that gauged participants’ understanding of
alcohol strength and calorie content. Due to time constraints and to
minimize participant burden, we were unable to use multi-item
scales for these secondary outcomes. Future studies could usefully
extend the present findings with more extensive measurement of
the constructs of interest. Furthermore, even though our sample
was sampled from a nationally representative English panel, there
was a sizable number of eligible participants who did not schedule
a testing appointment (1,722 out of 2,118) highlighting the poten-
tial for a selection bias in the final sample.
Conclusions
These results suggest that labeling drinks as lower in strength
increases the amount consumed. Further studies are warranted to
test for replication in non-laboratory settings and to estimate the
potential for any effects to be at a level with the potential to harm
health.
