Background: BM32 is a grass pollen allergy vaccine based on
recombinant fusion proteins consisting of nonallergenic peptides
from the IgE-binding sites of the 4 major grass pollen allergens
and the hepatitis B preS protein.
Objective: We sought to study the safety and clinical efficacy of
immunotherapy (allergen immunotherapy) with BM32 in patients
with grass pollen–induced rhinitis and controlled asthma.
Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
allergen immunotherapy field study was conducted for 2 grass
pollen seasons. After a baseline season, subjects (n 5 181) were
randomized and received 3 preseasonal injections of either
placebo (n 5 58) or a low dose (80 mg, n 5 60) or high dose
(160 mg, n 5 63) of BM32 in year 1, respectively, followed by a
booster injection in autumn. In the second year, all actively
treated subjects received 3 preseasonal injections of the BM32 low
dose, and placebo-treated subjects continued with placebo.
Clinical efficacy was assessed by using combined symptom
medication scores, visual analog scales, Rhinoconjunctivitis

 Quality of Life Questionnaires, and asthma symptom scores.
Adverse events were graded according to the European Academy
of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Allergen-specific antibodies
were determined by using ELISA, ImmunoCAP, and
ImmunoCAP ISAC.
Results: Although statistical significance regarding the primary
end point was not reached, BM32-treated subjects, when
compared with placebo-treated subjects, showed an
improvement regarding symptom medication, visual analog
scale, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire, and
asthma symptom scores in both treatment years. This was
accompanied by an induction of allergen-specific IgG without
induction of allergen-specific IgE and a reduction in the
seasonally induced increase in allergen-specific IgE levels in
year 2. In the first year, more grade 2 reactions were observed in
the active (n 5 6) versus placebo (n 5 1) groups, whereas there
was almost no difference in the second year.
Conclusions: Injections of BM32 induced allergen-specific IgG,
improved clinical symptoms of seasonal grass pollen allergy, and
were well tolerated. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;142:497-509.)

Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying
treatment for allergy and has long-lasting effects, even after
discontinuation.1-5
It has been shown that allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is more
cost-effective than pharmacotherapy.6 However, there are several
aspects of current allergen extract–based AIT that can be improved,
such as safety and convenience.7 There is a need for safe AIT forms
requiring only few administrations. Recently, a grass pollen allergy
vaccine (BM32) has been developed that is based on recombinant
fusion proteins consisting of nonallergenic peptides derived from
the IgE-binding sites of the 4 major timothy grass pollen allergens
(Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6) and the preS protein derived
from the large surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).8
Allergen-specific T-cell epitopes were reduced in the recombinant
fusion proteins of BM32. Therefore preS was selected to serve as
an immunologic carrier protein providing T-cell help for the
production of blocking allergen-specific IgG antibodies. The
immunologic characterization of BM32 showed a lack of IgE
reactivity and allergenic activity, and at the same time, the vaccine
induced allergen-specific IgG in animals, which blocked allergic
patients’ IgE binding to the grass pollen allergens and inhibited
allergen-induced basophil degranulation.8
In a subsequent clinical skin test study in human subjects, it was
demonstrated that BM32 induced neither immediate type skin
reactions nor T cell–mediated late-phase reactions, as evaluated by
atopy patch testing.9 This confirmed the lack of allergenic activity
and demonstrated that allergen-specific T-cell epitopes,which in pre-
vious synthetic allergy vaccines gave rise to systemic late-phase side
effects,10-13 have indeed been eliminated to a large extent in BM32.
A subsequent safety and dose-finding study conducted as a
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in an allergen exposure
chamber setting showed that 3 monthly injections of BM32 led to a
significant reduction of total nasal symptom scores during a 6-hour
grass pollen exposure in patients treated with 80 and 160 mg of
BM32, which was accompanied by a reduction of the total ocular
symptom score and immediate-type skin sensitivity, as determined
by using titrated skin prick tests (SPTs).14 The clinical effects
were associated with an induction of allergen-specific IgG
(IgG1 5 IgG4 > IgG2) production and a reduction in allergen-
specific T-cell proliferation by inhibition of IgE-facilitated allergen
presentation through allergen-specific IgG antibodies.14
Here we report the first double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicenter field trial, which investigated the clinical efficacy
and immunogenic effects, as well as tolerability, of BM32.
METHODS
Study subjects
To be eligible for the study, subjects hadto be aged 18 to 60 yearsand of either
sex, with a positive history of grass pollen allergy confirmed by a positive SPT
response (wheal >3 mm) to grass pollen extract and allergen-specific IgE levels
(measured by using ImmunoCAP; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden)
of atleast 3.5 kUA/L to both grass pollenextract and rPhl p 1/rPhl p 5 at screening
or within 12 months before inclusion. They also had to show moderate-to-severe
symptoms of grass pollen allergy during the grass pollen season (GPS) of the
screening year 2012. Major criteria for exclusion were symptomatic perennial
or seasonal coallergies during the GPS, severe ongoing atopic dermatitis,
uncontrolled asthma specified by an FEV1 of less than 70% of predicted value,
nasal polyposis, sensitization to Phl p 7 with allergen-specific IgE levels of
greater than 0.35 kUA/L, and participation in a grass pollen–specific
immunotherapy trial or use of marketed grass pollen–specific immunotherapy
in the 2 years before study start. The complete list of inclusion and exclusion
criteria can be found in the study protocol in the Study Protocol and Table E1
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. Table I shows that
subjects were evenlydistributedregarding age,sex, symptoms, andimmunologic
characteristics regarding the treatment groups.

 protocol was approved by the ethics committees and competent legal
authorities in each participating country, and all subjects provided written
informed consent.
The study was conducted over 3 GPSs (see Table E2 in this article’s Online
Repositoryat www.jacionline.org) fromMay 2012 (first patient in) until October
2014 (last patient out). A screening year (2012) was followed by 2 treatment
years (2013 and 2014) with an interim analysis performed by an independent
data monitoring committee (IDMC) in December 2013 (Figs 1 and 2).
We intended to recruit all subjects before or during the GPS of 2012 and
collect data on their allergy symptoms and intake of allergy medication
through an electronic diary. However, the recruitment period had to be
extended until January 2013. Therefore detailed data collected during the 2012
GPS were available for less than half of the subjects. All other subjects
completed a paper version of the diary retrospectively once to summarize their
allergy symptoms and need for allergy medication in the 2012 GPS.
These data, as well as serologic data (allergen-specific IgE levels) and
results from the titrated SPTs performed after the 2012 GPS (visit 3), were
evaluated by an IDMC. The aim of this data review was (1) to identify and
exclude subjects not eligible with respect to the inclusion and exclusion
criteria (in particular subjects with coallergies interfering with study end
points and subjects with only mild symptoms during the GPS) and (2) to assign
the 181 eligible subjects (Fig 2) to one of 2 groups according to the severity of
their sensitization to grass pollen (group 1, moderate; group 2, severe). To be
allocated to group 2, subjects had to have grass pollen–specific IgE levels of

 greater than 17.5 kUA/L and a positive SPT response with grass pollen extract
at a dilution of 1:128 by using SPT end point titration. Eligible subjects were
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with 20 mg of each of the 4 fusion
proteins (ie, 80 mg of antigen in total, which was termed BM32 low), with
40 mg of the 4 fusion proteins (ie, 160 mg of antigen in total, which was termed
BM32 high), or with placebo. Randomization was carried out by the contract
research organization as block randomization stratified for centers and
severity to ensure even distribution of the 3 study arms over all participating
centers and even distribution of subjects with severe symptoms over the 3
study arms. Subjects received 3 preseasonal injections and an additional
booster injection after the GPS of treatment year 1 (ie, 2013) and 3 preseasonal
injections in treatment year 2 (ie, 2014; Fig 1). Electronic diaries were used for
daily documentation of the subjects’ well-being by using a visual analog scale
(VAS),15 grass pollen allergy–related symptoms, and intake of allergy
medication (standby medication) during the GPS of the 2 treatment years.
The study schedule indicating time points (visits) for injections, blood
sampling, and titrated SPTs is shown in Fig 1.
As a result of a blinded interim analysis conducted at the end of the first
treatment year (ie, 2013) and after a subsequent study protocol amendment, all
subjects of the 2 actively treated groups received the low dose of BM32 in
treatment year 2 and were pooled for statistical analysis of the results of year 2
(ie, BM32 pooled) to increase the power of the study.
Study medication
BM32 vaccine and placebo. BM32 is an equimolar mix of 4
recombinant fusion proteins consisting of hypoallergenic peptides derived
from B-cell epitopes of the 4 major allergens from grass pollen, Phl p 1, Phl p
2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6, which are fused to hepatitis B–derived preS.8 Details of
the peptides, including a depiction of their sequences and arrangement, are
presented in detail in a study by Zieglmayer et al.14 These 4 active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide
in a physiologic buffer containing 0.9% NaCl. Two different BM32 doses
(BM32 low dose: 20 mg of each API, 80 mg of antigen in total; BM32 high
dose: 40 mg of each API, 160 mg of antigen in total) were selected for the study
based on the results of a previous phase IIa safety and dose-finding study
conducted in a pollen exposure chamber.14 The study medication was
manufactured by Biomay AG (Vienna, Austria) and Polymun Scientific
GmbH (Klosterneuburg, Austria). It was provided as suspension ‘‘ready for
injection’’ containing either 0.2 mg/mL BM32 APIs and 1.5 mg/mL of Al31
(BM32 low dose) or 0.4 mg/mL BM32 APIs and 3.0 mg/mL Al31 (BM32
high dose) in a physiologic buffer containing 0.9% NaCl. The placebo
preparation contained 3.0 mg/mL Al31 in the same buffer. The vaccine was
administered as a subcutaneous injection. The dose volume was 400 mL.
Concomitant antiallergic medication. All study subjects
had access to predefined concomitant antiallergic medication (topical
antihistamine, oral antihistamine, nasal corticosteroid, and oral corticosteroid)
to be used in a stepwise manner during the GPS when needed.
Assessment of clinical efficacy parameters
The primary end points of the study were the mean daily combined
symptom medication scores (SMSs) calculated for the peak of the GPS in
treatment years 1 and 2 (see the Study Protocol in this article’s Online
Repository). The SMS was calculated as the sum of the symptom score (SS)
and medication score (MS). Secondary end points were the mean daily
SMS in both years during the whole GPS, as well as the mean daily SS and
MS during the pollen peak and the whole GPS. Six symptoms of allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C; ie, runny nose, blocked nose, sneezing, itchy
nose, gritty/red/itchy eyes, and watery eyes) in accordance with the European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) position paper16 and
3 asthma symptoms (cough, wheezing, and tightness of chest/shortness of
breath) were recorded once daily in an electronic diary. Diary entries were
to be made in the evening, reflecting the past 24 hours, from approximately
4 weeks before until approximately 4 weeks after the GPS. The SS was
calculated as the sum of scores for the 6 symptoms of AR/C measured as
follows: 0, no symptoms; 1, mild symptoms; 2, moderate symptoms; and 3,
severe symptoms.16,17 An asthma SS was formed from the sum of scores
from the 3 asthma symptoms using the same scale (0-3), as described for
the SS.
Stepwise standby medication (ie, concomitant antiallergic medication) use
was scored as follows: oral antihistamine (2 mg of ceterizine) was defined as 2
points per tablet; topical antihistamine (0.5 mg/mL azelastine ophtalmic
solution or 1 mg/mL azelastine nasal spray) was defined as 0.5 points per drop
or puff; topical corticosteroid (50 mg of mometasone furoate nasal spray) was
defined as 1 point per puff; and oral corticosteroid (40-mg methyl
prednisolone tablet) was defined as 18 points per tablet.
As additional secondary efficacy end points, the patient’s well-being was
assessed by 2 independent measures: mean daily VAS15 and mean weekly
scores obtained with the standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life
Questionnaire (RQLQ),18 both of which were calculated during the pollen
peak, as well as during the whole GPS. Overall AR/C symptom–related
FIG 1. Study design. Patients recruited during the screening year (2012) were randomized at visit 4 (R) and
treated 3 times preseasonally during each of the 2 treatment years (2013 and 2014) and once in October 2013
(investigational medicinal product [IMP] administration). Symptoms, medication, VAS, and quality-of-life
data were obtained by using eDiaries from mid-April until mid-August (green background). Titrated SPTs
were performed at 8 time points, and blood samples were taken at 11 time points (red arrows).

 well-being was reported by patients daily by indicating a point on a
10-cm-long line between the left (feeling good) and right (feeling very bad)
on a VAS presented in the electronic diary. The RQLQ, consisting of 28
questions addressing 7 different aspects of quality of life that are impaired
by AR/C on a 7-point scale from 0 (not impaired at all) to 6 (severely impaired)
was completed once weekly in the electronic diary.
The GPS was defined to start with the first day with a pollen count of greater
than 25 grains/m3 per 24 hours and to end on the last day with a pollen count of
greater than 25 grains/m3 per 24 hours. The grass pollen peak season was
defined as the 15 consecutive days during the GPS with the highest cumulative
pollen count for each site. Centers were excluded from the evaluation of the
SMS if more than 50% of days in the peak season had a pollen count of 25
grains/m3 or less. Pollen counts were purchased from the Research Unit
of Aerobiology and Pollen Information at the Medical University of
Vienna, Vienna, Austria (https://www.pollenwarndienst.at/en/current-data/
daily-load.html).
Statistical analysis
The safety analysis (SA) set (n 5 166 patients) included all subjects who
had received at least 1 injection (see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org). Subjects of the SA population with a valid set of diary
entries during the peak of the GPS in treatment years 1 and 2 were defined
as full analysis set (FAS) 1 (n 5 146) and FAS2 (n 5 138), respectively
(see Fig E1). Efficacy was evaluated in the FAS (Fig 2 and see Fig E1).
A post hoc analysis was performed in a subset of the FAS population
(FAS1*, n 5 135; FAS2*, n 5 129; see Fig E1), excluding subjects with grass
pollen–specific IgE levels of less than 3.5 kUA/L at the time when treatment
started (ie, visit 5) because these subjects had grass pollen–specific IgE levels
of greater than the 3.5 kUA/L cutoff only in the 12 months before the study but
not at visit 5. The sample size for the study was calculated by assuming a
power of 80% and a 2-sided significance level of 2.5% to account for multiple
testing of 6 elementary hypotheses within the prespecified closed testing
procedure,19 as described below. However, the procedure needed at most
only half from the 5% 2-sided significance level (ie, 2.5%) for controlling
the type I error for multiple testing in the strong sense for a test of an elemen-
tary hypothesis and for a test of a seventh null hypothesis (ie, the intersection
of the first and second elementary null hypothesis) within the second
year. Assumptions regarding effect size and variances were based on data
from a previous subcutaneous immunotherapy study20 with a recombinant
birch pollen allergen and a similar symptom and medication scoring system
as in the present study, with the exemption that the SS and MS were evaluated
separately. For the purpose of sample size estimation, the sum of the SS and
MS, as well as the related pooled SDs, were calculated, resulting in a reduction

 by 54% (placebo, 9.8; verum, 4.5; pooled s, 5.3) in year 1 and by 47%
(placebo, 6.6; verum, 3.5; pooled s, 4.1) in year 2. The parameters of year 2
(which led to the more conservative sample size), together with a total dropout
rate of 25%, were assumed for the present study and resulted in a required
sample size of 60 per treatment group (180 patients in total). Evaluation of
the primary end point, key secondary end points, and well-being by using
the VAS was performed by using ANOVAs with the factors treatment, allergy
severity (moderate/severe), and study center as covariates. For the primary end
point (SMS), a closed testing procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity
when testing differences between the 3 treatment groups (low, high, and
placebo) at 2 years (years 1 and 2). Therefore the closed testing procedure
extends the testing strategy of Bonferroni adjustment for 2 years and
hierarchically compares treatment groups within a year. The hierarchical
preferences were first priority of high versus placebo, second priority of low
versus placebo, and third priority of high versus low in year 1 and first priority
of pooled high-low/low-low versus placebo, second priority of high-low
versus placebo and low-low versus placebo, and third priority of high-low
versus low-low in year 2. Absolute differences to placebo were calculated
based on least-squares (LS) means (ANOVA). Percentage differences between
treatment groups were computed based on ratio of geometric means. For all
other efficacy end points, descriptive summary statistics were used
(eg, mean, mean difference from placebo, and 95% CI for mean difference
from placebo), and the Wilcoxon 2-sample test was used to compare the
groups of BM32- and placebo-treated subjects. A first or second priority test
in a given year had also priority before a third priority test in the other year.
Specific futility boundaries and stopping rules were defined for the
prespecified interim analysis (details are provided in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jacionline.org).
The software used for statistical analysis was SAS (version 9.3; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). The statistical analysis plan is provided as supplementary
information in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. The
post hoc analysis of the FAS1* and FAS2* subpopulations was done with
GraphPad Prism software (version 6.00; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif)
by using an unpaired t test to compare the groups. Welch correction was
applied in cases of unequal variances.
Assessment of safety
The major safety end point was the frequency of adverse events (AEs) with
regard to the occurrence, seriousness, intensity, and relatedness to the study
drug. AEs known to be related to specific immunotherapy (SIT) were analyzed
separately, grouped into local and systemic reactions, and graded according to
the grading system suggested by the EAACI and the World Allergy
Organization.17,21 Further safety variables included vital signs, physical
examinations, and safety laboratory assessments (see the Study Protocol in
this article’s Online Repository).
Safety end points were evaluated in the SA set, which includes all subjects
who have been randomized and received at least 1 injection. All safety data
obtained in this study were presented with descriptive statistics. Comparisons
between the treatment groups were done with the x2 or Fisher exact tests.
Assessment of immunologic parameters
Blood samples were drawn at a number of time points throughout the study
(Fig 1) and analyzed for changes in levels of IgE and IgG (IgG1 and IgG4)
against the grass pollen allergens Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6 and
measured as described by Zieglmayer et al.14 Immunologic end points were
evaluated in the SA set. Changes in antibody levels were compared between
treatment groups by using the Wilcoxon 2-sample test and the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test for comparisons between visits within treatment groups.
RESULTS
Preseasonal treatment with 3 injections of BM32
improves the SMS during the GPS
Mean SMSs observed in the different study groups during the
peak pollen season of years 1 and 2 with P values for the difference
in LS means between the groups are shown in Fig 3, A. A reduction
of the mean SMS during the pollen peak season of 17.9% (95% CI,
41.2% to 214.7%; P 5 .245) and 10.2% (95% CI, 34.5% to
223.1%; P 5 .500) compared with the placebo group was
observed for the BM32 low-dose and BM32 high-dose group in
year 1, respectively. The reduction in SMS was more pronounced
in year 2, reaching 22.0% (95% CI, 39.8% to 20.98%;
P 5.059) for the BM32 pooled group, although still missing statis-
tical significance in the primary end point (P 5.085 for difference
in LS means between the BM32 pooled group and the placebo
group). The 2 subsets of the BM32 pooled group consisted of

 subjects having received either BM32 low dose or BM32 high dose
in treatment year 1 were evaluated separately. These subgroups are
referred to as ‘‘BM32 low-low’’ and ‘‘BM32 high-low,’’ respec-
tively. The reduction in the SMS compared with placebo was
24.8% (95% CI, 43.5% to 20.21%; P 5 .052) for the BM32
low-low group and 19.3% (95% CI, 40.0% to 28.6%; P 5 .155)
for the BM32 high-low group (ie, not significant).
The analysis of the SS produced similar results as the SMS. In
treatment year 1, the mean SS reduction compared with placebo
was stronger in the BM32 low-dose than in the BM32 high-dose
group and was more pronounced in year 2: BM32 pooled group,
24.5% (95% CI, 41.1% to 3,30%; P 5 .026); BM32 low-low
group, 27.6% (95% CI, 45.3% to 4.13%; P 5 .025); and BM32
high-low group, 21.4% (95% CI, 40.4% to 23.66%; P 5 .087
[not significant]). Mean SSs and P values for differences in LS
means between the groups are shown in Fig E2, A, in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.
The MS was reduced in all actively treated subjects compared
with the placebo group in treatment years 1 and 2 (see Fig E2, C).
Improvement of the SMS is best in subjects with
high levels of grass pollen–specific IgE
A post hoc analysis for exploratory purposes showed that 11 of
the 146 FAS1 subjects and 9 of the 138 FAS2 subjects (see Fig E1)
had timothy grass pollen allergen–specific IgE levels at visit 5 of
less than 3.5 kUA/L (Table I). Also, these subjects had low skin
sensitivity to grass pollen allergens at visit 5 (data not shown).
A grass pollen allergen–specific IgE level of greater than 3.5
kUA/L was defined as an inclusion criterion for the screening visit
(see Table E1). When these subjects were excluded (ie, FAS*), we
found a more pronounced reduction of the mean SMS compared
with placebo in all groups. In year 2 the BM32 pooled and
low-low groups were reduced by 24.4% and 25.2%, with nominal

with 95% CIs (y-axes) during the peak pollen seasons of treatment years 1 (placebo, BM32 low, and BM32 high

ferences in LS means between groups are indicated. B and C, Rhinoconjunctivitis-related quality of life param-
eters recorded for the indicated groups during the pollen peak seasons during year 1 (Fig 4, B) and year 2 (Fig 4,

are listed underneath the spider plots for each of the parameters.
J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL

 P values for the difference in LS means of 0.016 and 0.036,
respectively. Mean SMSs for all groups in both treatment years
and nominal P values for differences in LS means between the
groups are shown in Fig 3, B.
Therefore
we
analyzed
whether
the
grass
pollen
allergen–specific IgE levels at screening and clinical treatment
effects are associated. Fig E3 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org shows that the reduction in SMSs increases
with grass pollen allergen–specific IgE levels and that the
reduction in SMSs compared with placebo correlated highly
(R2 5 0.878) with grass pollen allergen–specific IgE levels.
Also for the mean SS and MS, the improvement was more
pronounced
in
the
FAS*
populations
after
removal
of
subjects with timothy grass pollen–specific IgE levels of less
than 3.5 kUA/L, reaching a 28.8% reduction of the SS to placebo
(P 5 .017 for the difference in LS means) for the low-low group
and a reduction of 26.7% (P 5.018 for difference in LS means) of
the pooled group in year 2 (see Fig E2, B and D).
Preseasonal treatment with BM32 improves
well-being and rhinoconjunctivitis-related quality
of life during the GPS
Assessment of the level of well-being during the peak pollen
season by using a VAS showed that well-being in the first year was
19.5% better in the BM32 high-dose group compared with
placebo and 25.2% better in the BM32 low-dose group than in
the placebo group (ie, not significant). In treatment year 2, the
difference in well-being between the actively treated and placebo
groups was increased further (BM32 pooled, 28.6%; BM32
low-low, 31.2%; BM32 high-low, 26%; P < .05 for differences
in LS means; Fig 4, A).
Likewise, we found an improvement regarding RQLQ
parameters in year 1 (pollen peak season) for the actively treated
subjects, as shown in the spider plot diagram (Fig 4, B). In year 2
we observed a consistent and strong improvement regarding all
RQLQ parameters for each of the actively treated groups
compared with the placebo group, reaching small P values for
most of the RQLQ parameters and for the RQLQ overall quality
of life (Fig 4, C).
For patients who kept an electronic diary in the baseline year
(2012), we compared the improvement of well-being determined
by using a VAS in the subsequent 2 treatment years with the
baseline year (see Fig E4 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org). We noted an improvement in well-being
also in the placebo group in treatment years 1 and 2. An at least
40% improvement in well-being in all actively treated groups
(BM32 low-low, BM32 high-low, and BM32 pooled) was found
in year 2 compared with the baseline year (see Fig E4).
Treatment with BM32 improves grass
pollen–related asthma symptoms
The study population included also subjects with grass pollen
allergy with a history of grass pollen–associated asthma (BM32
low-dose group, n 5 20; BM32 high-dose group, n 5 12; placebo
group, n 5 14; Table I). Therefore we also analyzed the effects of
BM32 AIT on asthma symptoms. The post hoc analysis of the
asthma SS showed that there was a 24.3% and 39.2% reduction
in the asthma SS in the BM32 low-dose and BM32 high-dose
groups, respectively, when compared with the placebo group in
treatment year 1 (see Fig E5 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org; not significant). In treatment year 2, the
reduction in asthma SS compared with the placebo group in the
BM32 pooled and the BM32 high-low group was 31.9%
(P 5 .022 for difference in LS means) and 48.7% (P 5 .012 for
difference in LS means), respectively. In the BM32 low-low
group the reduction in asthma SS in year 2 was 17.1%
(P 5 .153 for difference in LS means; not significant). Mean
asthma scores for all groups in both years and P values for
differences in LS means are shown in Fig E5.
Vaccination with BM32 induces significant
increases in allergen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG4
responses
We found that the first course of 3 subcutaneous injections of
BM32 given in monthly intervals induced strong increases in
levels of IgG antibodies specific for the 4 major grass pollen
allergens Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, and Phl p 6, whereas no such
increases were found in the placebo-treated subjects (Fig 5, A).
No relevant difference regarding induction of allergen-specific
IgG levels was noted when comparing the BM32 low-dose and
BM32 high-dose groups. Allergen-specific IgG levels decreased
between visit 8 (April 2013) and visit 9 (August 2013) but did
not completely return to baseline levels (Fig 5, A). One injection
in October 2013 (visit 10) was sufficient to boost allergen-specific
IgG levels up to those induced by the preseasonal course of 3
injections. A decrease in allergen-specific IgG levels was noted
also between visit 10 (October 2013) and visit 12 (January
2014), which could be boosted again by the 3 preseasonal
injections and remained at higher levels after the second GPS in
August 2014 compared with treatment after the season in year 1
(Fig 5, A). When we analyzed allergen-specific IgG1 and IgG4
subclass responses, we noted an interesting difference between
allergen-specific IgG1 and IgG4 responses (Fig 5, B and C).
Allergen-specific IgG1 responses increased after each course of
injections to a similar level in year 1 as in year 2 and after the
injections decreased always to similar levels (Fig 5, B). By
contrast, allergen-specific IgG4 levels continued to increase after
each of the booster injections so that levels obtained after the
boost in October 2013 were greater than after the first course of
injections in April 2013, and levels obtained after the third course
of injections in April 2014 were greater than after the October
booster injection (Fig 5, C). Thus it seemed that continuous
treatment with BM32 builds up a continuously increasing
allergen-specific IgG4 response.
Vaccination with BM32 does not induce increases in
grass pollen allergen–specific IgE levels and
prevents seasonally induced boosts of grass
pollen–specific IgE production
We also studied the effects of vaccination with BM32 on grass
pollen allergen–specific IgE levels. Fig 6, A, shows that
vaccination with both low-dose and high-dose BM32 did not
induce relevant increases of grass pollen allergen–specific IgE
levels. No relevant changes were observed after each of the 3
injection courses (visit 5, January 2013 vs visit 8, April 2013;
visit 9, August 2013 vs visit 11, November 2013; and visit 12,
January 2014 vs visit 15, April 2014). Increases in grass pollen
allergen–specific IgE levels were noted in all groups only after

 seasonal grass pollen exposure in August 2013 and August
2014 (Fig 6, A). We compared the increases in grass pollen
allergen–specific IgE levels after each of the 2 pollen seasons in
the actively and placebo-treated patients (Fig 6, B) and found
that in treatment year 2 the increases in the sum of Phl p 1–, 2–,
5–, and 6–specific IgE levels were lower in all actively treated
groups compared with the placebo group (BM32 pooled:
P 5 .016; BM32 low-low: P 5 .037; and BM32 high-low:
P 5 .036; Fig 6, B). In treatment year 1, the increase in the
mean allergen-specific IgE level in the verum groups was also
lower than in the placebo-treated subjects, with a reduction in
the BM32 high-dose group (P 5 .015; Fig 6, B).

 Treatment with BM32 is safe and well tolerated
Treatment with BM32 was safe and well tolerated. No
adrenaline
was
needed
during
the
complete
study.
The
majority of side effects were late-phase local reactions (Table II
and see Table E3 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org). Tables II and III represent a summary of
the treatment-associated AEs (Table II) and the grading of
systemic AEs (Table III). Systemic AEs are further specified
according to MeDRA terms in Table E3. Local reactions were
late-phase reactions, which were more frequent and more
intense in actively treated subjects than in placebo-treated
subjects (Table II). Systemic reactions were late-phase reactions.
They were more frequent in the first treatment year and more
frequent in the BM32 low-dose (ie, 23 events) and BM32
high-dose (ie, 18 events) groups than in the placebo group (ie, 6
events). According to the EAACI grading, the systemic reactions
observed in year 1 were graded 0 to 2, whereas no grade 3 or grade
4 reactions were observed (Table II). Two severe AEs were noted
in the first year. In 1 subject a chronic inflammatory central
nervous system disease was diagnosed after the patient reported
paraesthesia, but this patient had reported neurologic problems
already before the study. A second subject who was also allergic
to birch pollen and associated pathogenesis-related protein 10
allergen–containing food experienced an episode of angioedema
several hours after treatment and after consumption of a
nut-containing cereal bar.
In treatment year 2, only a few systemic side effects were
observed, and they were equally frequent in the active and
placebo groups (BM32 pooled group, 6 events/113 subjects;
placebo group, 3 events/53 subjects). All but 1 of these reactions
were late-phase reactions of grade 0 or 1 according to the EAACI
classification. One severe AE was observed in 1 patient of the
BM32 low-low group who experienced an immediate flush after
injection associated with an increase in blood pressure, which
then returned to a normal levels. After consultation with 2
independent international experts, this reaction was classified as
a grade 3 reaction.
DISCUSSION
We report the first multicenter, double-blind, placebo-
controlled phase IIb field study conducted with the recombinant
B cell epitope–containing grass pollen allergy vaccine BM32 in
patients with grass pollen allergy for a period of 2 years. BM32 is
different from other recombinant and synthetic allergy vaccines
being evaluated in clinical trials. It consists of nonallergenic
peptides of the 4 major grass pollen allergens Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl
p 5, and Phl p 6, which are expressed as fusion proteins attached to
the hepatitis B–derived preS protein.8,14,22 Whereas previously
described recombinant hypoallergenic vaccines, such as rBet v
1 fragments,23 rBet v 1 trimer,24 a Bet v 1 folding variant,25 and
contiguous Bet v 1–derived overlapping synthetic peptides,26 as
well as synthetic peptides derived from the major cat allergen
Fel d 1,27 contain allergen-specific T-cell epitopes, the presence
of allergen-specific T-cell epitopes in BM32 has been reduced,
and hepatitis B–derived preS is used as an immunologic carrier
protein to induce allergen-specific blocking IgG antibody
responses.8 We found that only 3 injections of BM32 given before
the pollen season reduced SMSs, SSs, and MSs (not significant)
compared with placebo treatment in the first year, and this effect
was much more pronounced in the second year. Although we
failed to reach the primary end point (ie, daily combined SMS
calculated for the peak of the GPS in treatment years 1 and 2),
in the FAS population our study shows that treatment with
BM32 improves symptoms of grass pollen allergy. Of note, in
addition to the improvement in SMSs, SSs, and MSs, we noted
that patients also substantially improved regarding VAS and
RQLQ scores.
After a blinded interim analysis conducted at the end of the first
treatment year, an IDMC suggested to continue the study and to
switch the 40-mg dose (ie, 160 mg of the 4 BM32 components) to
20 mg (ie, 80 mg of the 4 BM32 components) to increase the
power of the study. In fact, it also appeared that the improvement
in SMSs was lower at the 40-mg dose. The latter can be explained
by the fact that low-dose antigen favors antibody affinity
maturation.28-30

 In the second year we observed a substantial improvement in
the actively treated patients over placebo-treated patients. The
improvement in symptoms in the second treatment year
was accompanied by a continuous increase in levels of
allergen-specific IgG4 antibodies, as was also observed for
allergen extract–based subcutaneous forms of AIT earlier.30,31
We observed that the allergen-specific IgG antibodies induced
by BM32 were strongly boosted already by 1 booster injection
administered
in
autumn
after
the
pollen
season
and
further increased after another 3 injections given monthly
before the pollen season of treatment year 2. This study also
highlighted another possible advantage of BM32 because unlike
other forms of AIT (eg, sublingual immunotherapy), which
induce only low levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies but
high boosts of allergen-specific IgE levels,32 treatment with
BM32 did not increase grass pollen allergen–specific IgE
production.
There are several possible reasons for the observed preferential
IgG induction. First, preS, the carrier protein, does not induce TH2
immune responses but rather TH1 responses.33 Second, the
vaccine did not activate or only mildly activated grass pollen
allergen–specific TH2 responses. Third, removal of large parts
of the grass pollen allergen sequences from the vaccine makes
it less allergenic compared with the full allergen. Fourth, because
of the low allergenic activity of BM32, high doses of the vaccine
can be injected. High-dose immunization is known to favor IgG
induction,
whereas
low-dose
immunization
favors
IgE
induction.34 Moreover, we noted that treatment with BM32
reduced
significantly
the
boosts
of
allergen-specific
IgE
production caused by seasonal allergen exposure (ie, blunting
effect) similar to what has been noted for allergen extract–based
vaccines35 and other recombinant and synthetic vaccines.10,36
A gradual decrease in allergen-specific IgE levels caused by
such a mechanism might likely be one of the responsible
mechanisms underlying the long-term effect of AIT after
discontinuation of treatment. Therefore we plan to investigate
the long-term effects of BM32 in follow-up studies.
Major advantages of BM32 are that only a few injections
were needed to achieve clinical improvement, whereas other
forms of AIT require daily administrations (eg, sublingual
immunotherapy) or multiple injections (ie, allergen extract–based
subcutaneous AIT).7 Another major advantage of BM32 is that
the vaccine was very well tolerated by the patients, although
extremely high doses (ie, 80 or 160 mg) were administered
without any updosing.14
In a recently published phase IIb field study conducted with
contiguous overlapping synthetic peptides of the major birch
pollen allergen Bet v 1 in which 50 and 100 mg was injected,
systemic side effects were observed in more than 64% of the
actively treated subjects,13 whereas in our study 22% of the
patients had systemic side effects in year 1 and only 5% in year 2.
In the study with synthetic Bet v 1 peptides, 2 patients required
systemic epinephrine, whereas in our study systemic side effects
were mild, and no epinephrine was required. Because of the
excellent safety profile and due to the fact that BM32 did not boost
allergen-specific IgE responses, the vaccine might be well suited
for therapy of children. AIT in children is indeed an important
future research need because it becomes increasingly clear that
early intervention can prevent allergic sensitization and/or
progression of IgE sensitization to symptomatic disease and
then to severe disease manifestations.37-39
Of note, patients with grass pollen–induced asthma tolerated
the BM32 vaccine very well and showed an improvement in
asthma symptoms. Therefore BM32 can be considered also for
the treatment of patients with grass pollen–induced asthma.
Another unexpected advantage of BM32 was that it induced not
only allergen-specific IgG antibodies but also antibodies specific
for the hepatitis B surface antigen preS, which were found to
inhibit in vitro infection of liver cells by HBV.22 This was the first
demonstration that vaccination with preS alone without S
antigen can induce HBV-specific antibody responses in human
subjects. Therefore it is possible that BM32-vaccinated subjects
are also protected against HBV infections.40
Our study also has also limitations, such as low pollen exposure
in certain study centers, leading to the exclusion of patients from
the evaluation in line with predefined thresholds for pollen
exposure, which affected the power of the study negatively
(Table E2). Nevertheless, our study shows that AIT with BM32
improves symptoms of grass pollen allergy, is convenient in appli-
cation, and is very well tolerated so that it will undergo phase III
evaluation as a next step. The fact that BM32 does not boost
allergen-specific IgE production indicates also that BM32 can
be used in preventive vaccination studies to investigate whether
the vaccine can be used to prevent the progression from rhinitis
to asthma or eventually the progression from sensitization to
allergic symptoms or even for prophylactic vaccination.
Clinical implications: This study shows that a recombinant B
cell epitope–based grass pollen allergy vaccine requires only a
few injections, is safe, and improves symptoms of grass pollen
allergy.
