Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes is a major health concern worldwide. Whole grains and cereal fiber may offer protective
effects on type 2 diabetes risk. However, few studies have been conducted in cohorts with detailed information on
whole-grain cereal intakes and product types and with wide ranges of intake.
Objective: We investigated the associations between whole-grain intake, including intakes of different cereal types and
products, and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a population with wide and diverse whole-grain intake.
Methods: We used data from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort including 55,465 participants aged
50–65 y at baseline. Of these, 7417 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during follow-up (median: 15
y). Detailed information on the intake of whole-grain products was available from a food-frequency questionnaire, and
total whole-grain intake and whole-grain cereal types (wheat, rye, oats) were calculated in grams per day. Associations
were examined by using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounders.
Results: Whole-grain intake was associated with an 11% and 7% lower risk of type 2 diabetes per whole-grain serving
(16 g) per day for men and women, respectively [HR (95% CI)—men: 0.89 (0.87
, 0.91); women: 0.93 (0.91, 0.96)]. For
men, the intake of all whole-grain cereal types investigated (wheat, rye, oats) was significantly associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes, but only wheat and oats intake was significantly associated for women. Among the different
whole-grain products, rye bread, whole-grain bread, and oatmeal/muesli were significantly associated with a lower risk
of type 2 diabetes for both men and women.
Conclusions: In this cohort study, we found consistent associations between high whole-grain intake and lower risk
of type 2 diabetes. Overall, an association was found for all different cereals and whole-grain products tested.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is a major health burden worldwide. The
number of adults with diabetes has nearly quadrupled during
the past 35 y, and in 2014 there were 422 million adults with
diabetes (1). Overweight and obesity and diet are important risk
factors for type 2 diabetes (2). Carbohydrate quality in the diet
may be one of the most important dietary factors (3, 4) and
may be determined by the whole-grain or refined-grain content
and glycemic load (5, 6). Studies in different populations have
consistently found that the intake of whole grains and cereal
fiber is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and
prediabetes (7–9), but the role of specific grains has seldom been
investigated separately.
Whole grains are defined as consisting of all 3 principal
components of the grain kernel (starchy endosperm, germ, and
bran), whereas in refined grains only the starchy endosperm
is present (10). The underlying mechanisms for an association
between whole grains and type 2 diabetes are not entirely
clear, but whole grains may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes
by improving insulin sensitivity (9, 11), lowering postprandial
glucose response (12), and possibly also lowering inflammation
(13, 14). The proposed beneficial effect may be partly ascribed
to the dietary fiber content but also to the contents of bioactive
components and the food structure (12, 15–18). Dietary fiber
in whole grains is probably related to a healthy gut microbiota
and to high production of SCFAs (19). Conversely, gut microbial

 dysbiosis and low abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria are
associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (20). Different
whole-grain cereal types have different contents of nutrients,
dietary fiber, and bioactive compounds (21), and thus their
association with the risk of type 2 diabetes may differ. A
Scandinavian nested case-control study, partly based on the
same cohort as in the present study, used biomarkers of whole-
grain wheat and rye intake (alkylresorcinols) and suggested that
whole-grain rye, but not whole-grain wheat, is associated with
lower risk of type 2 diabetes (22).
The intake of whole grains in the Nordic countries, including
Denmark, is high compared with that in other populations. The
mean intake in Denmark in 2011–2013 was 58 g/d for adults
(33 g/d in 2000–2004) (23). In comparison, the mean intake
in the United States is below one ounce-equivalent per day
(∼1 serving or 16 g) (24) and the mean intake in the United
Kingdom is 27 g/d (25), primarily in the form of wheat. In
Denmark, the main whole-grain cereal type consumed is rye,
but wheat and oats are also consumed in considerable amounts
(26).
Overall, there is strong evidence that a high intake of whole
grains and cereal fiber is associated with a lower risk of type 2
diabetes (8, 27), but knowledge about the possible associations
for different whole-grain cereal types (e.g., wheat, rye, oats)
and whole-grain products is lacking. The aim of the study
was therefore to investigate the association between whole-
grain intake (grams per day), intake of whole-grain cereal types
(wheat, rye, oats), and intake of different whole-grain products
in relation to the risk of type 2 diabetes in a Danish cohort
with a large variation in intakes of whole grains. Our starting
hypothesis was that high whole-grain intake is associated with
a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and that the strength of the
association differs between cereal and product types.
Methods
Study population. The Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort consists of
57,053 participants recruited in 1993–1997. Participants were 50–65 y
at recruitment and all resided in the Copenhagen or Aarhus area. The
response rate was approximately one-third of those invited (37% for
women, 34% for men). The study was approved by relevant scientific
ethics committees and the Danish Data Protection Agency, and all
participants gave written informed consent (28).
All of the participants completed 2 questionnaires: a lifestyle
questionnaire and a dietary questionnaire. Both questionnaires were
checked for errors and missing information at the study center. The
lifestyle questionnaire included questions on, for example, smoking
history and physical activity, and was completed by the participants at
the study center. Before visiting the study center, participants completed
a 192-item FFQ. In the FFQ, participants were asked to report their
habitual diet for the previous 12 mo in 12 possible categories ranging
from never to ≥8 times/d (28). The intake of foods and nutrients was
estimated by using the software program FoodCalc (29).
A subset of the participants (n = 3919) completed a 24-h dietary
recall on the day they visited the study center and were asked to recall

their diet within the previous 24 h in generic terms. Thereafter, the
participants were asked to provide details about the products consumed
(e.g., brand name of whole-grain product) (30).
Assessment of whole-grain intake. Whole grains were defined
according to the definition by the American Association of Cereal
Chemists, as follows: “Whole grains shall consist of the intact, ground,
cracked or flaked caryopsis, whose principal anatomical components—
the starchy endosperm, germ and bran—are present in the same relative
proportions as they exist in the intact caryopsis” (31). The following
species were included in the definition in the present study: rye, wheat,
oats,barley,rice,millet,corn/maize (dried),triticale,and sorghum/durra.
However, the main sources were limited to wheat, rye, and oats.
Whole-grain intake was expressed in 2 different ways, either as
whole-grain intake (grams per day) or as whole-grain product intake
(grams of product per day). For whole-grain intake (grams per day),
the fact that different products have different whole-grain contents
was taken into account. We used information available on a subset
from 24-h dietary recalls to estimate the whole-grain content of
the products. Information from a Danish report, manufacturers, and
product packaging, and from recipe books for reported whole-grain–
containing foods, was used to estimate the whole-grain content of the
food groups estimated for all participants from the FFQ. Calculation
of the whole-grain content was performed for selected food groups
known to contain whole grains, but no minimum level was set, and thus
even products with very low whole-grain contents were included. The
total whole-grain intake was expressed as the whole-grain content of
the unprepared ingredients divided by the weight of the prepared food.
More detailed explanations of whole-grain estimation can be found
elsewhere (26, 32). For the whole-grain product intake, the following
food groups from the FFQ were considered whole-grain products: rye
bread, whole-grain bread, and oatmeal/muesli. The total whole-grain
product intake was calculated as the sum of these 3 groups.
An example of the two different ways we express the whole-grain
intake in (whole-grain intake in grams per day compared with whole-
grain product intake) is given below: if a participant consumed 1 slice
of rye bread weighing 50 g per day, the whole-grain product intake
(grams of product per day) of that person was 50 g/d. With the use of
data from the 24-h dietary recall, the average whole-grain content for
each product category was estimated—for example, 33% for rye bread.
Consequently, the example participant had a whole-grain intake (g/d)
of 16.5 g (0.33 × 50 g).
In the present study, we defined a serving size as 16 g whole
grain, which, in general, is the agreed-upon whole-grain serving size
(33, 34). For whole-grain products, we used serving sizes used in the
FFQ: rye bread = 50 g (1 slice), whole-grain bread = 40 g (1 slice),
and oatmeal/muesli = 50 g. The actual whole-grain content of these
products varied considerably, 1 serving size of whole-grain bread had,
on average, a whole-grain content of 3 g, whereas 1 serving of oatmeal
had a whole-grain content of 50 g (100% whole-grain).
Selection of cases. The National Diabetes Register was used to
identify incident diabetes cases. The register links to several previously
established registries. The National Diabetes Register is complete from
1 January 1995, but the inclusion of cases started on 1 January 1990
(35, 36).
Participants are included in the National Diabetes Register, if they
meet 1 of the following criteria (35):
1. Registered with a diagnosis of diabetes in the National Patient
Register (sensitivity = 64%, positive predictive value = 97%)
2. Registration of chiropody (as a diabetic patient) in the National
Health Service Register (sensitivity = 40%, positive predictive
value = 97%)
3. Five blood-glucose measurements in a 1-y period in the National
Health Service Register (sensitivity = 38%, positive predictive
value = 86%)
4. Two blood-glucose measurements per year in 5 consecutive years
in the National Health Service Register (sensitivity = 13%,
positive predictive value = 95%)

The overall positive predictive value was 89% and the sensitivity

lowest positive predictive values.
Enrollment in the Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort took place in
1993–1997, and the National Diabetes Register was not complete
until 1995 (although incomplete information was available from 1990).
Thus, we had incomplete information on incident cases before 1
January 1995, and therefore the baseline was set to 1 January 1995
for those recruited before that date. We excluded all participants with
diabetes if they were diagnosed with diabetes before 1995, or before
baseline if enrolled after 1995. The participants were all middle-aged at
recruitment, and therefore we expected all incident diabetes cases to be
those of type 2 diabetes. Hereafter, incident diabetes cases are therefore
referred to as type 2 diabetes cases.
Participants in the present study. Of the 57,053 participants in
the Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort, we excluded 1254 participants
because they had a diagnosis or diabetes and/or cancer before baseline.
Furthermore, we excluded 309 participants because they had missing
information on whole-grain intake or potential confounders. Because
the National Diabetes Register was not complete until 1 January 1995,
we excluded 17 participants who were diagnosed with diabetes and
8 participants who died between baseline and this date. Thus, we
included 55,565 participants in the present study (26,251 men and
29,214 women). All 55,565 participants were followed using their
personal identification number (CPR number, which is assigned to all
persons alive and living in Denmark) (37) from baseline until the date
of diagnosis of diabetes or censoring, which was date of death, date of
emigration (n = 305), date of change of CPR number (n = 3), or end of
follow-up (31 December 2011), whichever came first.
Statistical analyses. Characteristics of the participants (all and
cases) are expressed as medians with 5th and 95th percentiles for
continuous variables and as percentages and numbers for categorical
variables. We used the Cox proportional hazards model with age as
time scale to estimate the association between whole-grain intake and
risk of type 2 diabetes, expressed as HRs. We included time under study
as a time-dependent variable modeled as a linear spline with boundaries
at 1, 2, and 3 y after entry into the study. This allows for different
underlying hazards during the first 3 y of follow-up. On the basis of
an a priori assumption, we stratified all analyses by sex (a posteriori
analysis for effect modification confirmed that the associations were not
equal among men and women; P-interaction < 0.05). The linearity of
the whole-grain exposure variables and the linear potential confounders
was evaluated by using splines with 3 or 9 knots placed at quartiles or
deciles. No departures from linearity were found, except for alcohol
intake among users and for intakes of red and processed meat. Thus,
to ensure proper adjustment, alcohol intake among users was included
as linear splines with a boundary set at 24 g/d for men and 12 g/d for
women, and the intake of red and processed meat was included as 2
separate variables (dummy variable for any intake, and grams per day).
The proportional hazard assumption was tested, and no violations were
observed (all P > 0.32).
Several models were evaluated: a minimally adjusted model
(age-adjusted) and 3 adjusted models. Model 1 was adjusted for
potential lifestyle and dietary confounders chosen a priori, including
the following: highest educational level completed (primary school,
technical/professional school, high school, higher education including
university), Cambridge Physical Activity Index (38, 39) (inactive,
moderately inactive, moderately active, active), smoking status (never,
former, current), alcohol intake (abstainer: yes or no; grams per day
with boundaries at 24 g/d for men and 12 g/d for women), red
and processed meat intake (any: yes or no, and grams per day). For
women, adjustments were also made for menopausal status and use of
menopausal hormones (never, current, former, unknown). In another
model (model 2), model 1 was further adjusted for total energy intake
(excluding energy from intakes of red and processed meat and alcohol)
using the standard multivariate method (40). Model 3 was also adjusted
as for model 1, but with additional adjustments made for BMI (possibly
a mediator/intermediary variable). In analyses of whole-grain types
(wheat, rye, and oats) and whole-grain products (rye bread, whole-grain
bread, oatmeal/muesli), types were mutually adjusted. We also checked
whether adjustment for other dietary risk factors related to the risk of
type 2 diabetes (3), including leafy vegetables, dairy products, sugar-
sweetened beverages, coffee, and vitamin D, yielded different results.
This was not the case, so no adjustments were made for these dietary
factors.
Whole-grain exposures investigated were as follows: Whole-grain
intake (grams per day), intake of whole-grain types (wheat, rye, and
oats; grams per day), whole-grain product intake (grams of product
per day), and intake of whole-grain products (rye bread, whole-grain
bread, and oatmeal/muesli). These variables were expressed as linear
exposures, whole-grain intake increments per SD and per serving
(16 g) (33, 41), and whole-grain product intake as increments of 1
SD and per serving (total whole-grain product intake: 50 g; rye bread:
50 g; whole-grain bread: 40 g; oatmeal/muesli: 50 g). Furthermore, sex-
specific quartiles were explored as exposures.
As mentioned in the section entitled “Selection of cases,” the
cases were included in the National Diabetes Register on the basis of
different criteria. The positive predictive value and/or sensitivity of the
following criteria were the lowest among the 6 criteria: 5 blood-glucose
measurements in a 1-y period in the National Health Service Register
and 2 blood-glucose measurements per year in 5 consecutive years in
the National Health Service Register (35). Therefore, we conducted a
sensitivity analysis excluding cases included in the National Diabetes
Register on the basis of these 2 criteria (n = 3134; 42% of cases), and
thus only kept the “confirmed cases” in the analyses.
The correlation between whole-grain intake and whole-grain
product intake as well as the correlation within whole-grain cereal
types and whole-grain product types were estimated using Spearman
correlations due to skewed distribution of the variables. Effect
modification by BMI group [BMI (kg/m2) ≤25, 25.1–29.9, or ≥30) and
intake of red and processed meat (sex-specific quartiles) was evaluated.
This was done by making linear estimates of whole-grain intake
(grams per day) and whole-grain product intake (grams of product per
day) as continuous variables (per SD), by groups (BMI) and quartiles
(red and processed meat), and then testing the hypothesis of equal
regression coefficients in groups or quartiles by using Wald’
s test (P-
interaction on a multiplicative scale). A sensitivity analysis among those
with self-reported information on acute myocardial infarction, angina
pectoris, stroke, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia at baseline was
conducted in which those that reported such an event/condition were
excluded.
The significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05 (2-sided). SAS software
(version 9.3; SAS Institute, Inc.) was used for the statistical analyses. The
PHREG procedure was used for the Cox proportional hazards modeling
and the “assess ph” option was used to test for proportionality. The
FREQ and UNIVARIATE procedures were used for the descriptive
analyses, and the CORR procedure for the correlation analyses.
Results
Of the 55,465 cohort participants, 7417 incident cases of type
2 diabetes (4116 men and 3301 women) were identified during
a median of 15 y of follow-up. The baseline characteristics are
shown in Table 1 for the sex-specific quartiles of whole-grain
intake (grams per day) for men and women (see Supplemental
Table 1 for the baseline table for all and cases). Those with
whole-grain intake in the highest quartile were less likely to
have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during follow-up,
had a lower BMI, were more likely to have more education,

 and were less likely to smoke. Dietary habitual intake was also
different according to quartile of whole-grain intake, in which
those with an intake in the highest quartile had lower alcohol
intake, a higher intake of dietary fiber and magnesium), and a
lower dietary glycemic index.
Median whole-grain intake was 42 g/d for men and 34 g/d
for women, whereas median whole-grain product intake was
130 g product/d for men and 111 g product/d for women
(Table 2). The main whole-grain cereal type consumed was
rye for both men and women, whereas the main whole-grain
product intake was in the form of rye bread. Whole-grain intake
and whole-grain product intake were positively correlated
(r = 0.81 for men and 0.73 for women). There was a weak
correlation within the whole-grain cereal types (r = 0.03–0.51)
and whole-grain product intake types (r = 0.01–0.13).
Whole-grain intake (per serving increment; 16 g/d) was
associated with an 11% and 7% lower risk of type 2 diabetes
for men and women, respectively [model 1 HR (95% CI)—men:
0.89 (0.87, 0.91); women: 0.93 (0.91. 0.96)] (Table 3). Men
with whole-grain intake in the highest quartile had a 34% lower
risk of type 2 diabetes (model 1 HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.72)
and women a 22% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (model 1 HR:
0.78; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.86). The intake of whole-grain products
was also related to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. A 1-serving
increment (50 g/d) in intake was associated with a 12% and 7%
lower risk of type 2 diabetes for men and women, respectively
[model 1 HR (95% CI)—men: 0.88 (0.86, 0.90); women: 0.93
(0.90, 0.96)].
The intake of different whole-grain cereal types and whole-
grain products was also investigated as exposure in relation to
type 2 diabetes risk (Table 4). For men, all 3 whole-grain cereals
investigated (wheat, rye, and oats) had a significant association
with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas for women an
association was found for whole-grain wheat and oats. For the
different whole-grain products, rye bread, whole-grain bread,
and oatmeal/muesli were significantly associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. Results according
to sex-specific quartile of intake of different whole-grain cereal
types and whole-grain products (Figure 1) also showed inverse
associations for men, but for women intake in the highest
compared with the lowest quartile was only inversely associated
with type 2 diabetes risk for whole-grain wheat, rye bread, and
oatmeal/muesli.
Overall, adjusting for total energy intake (model 2) yielded
similar results. When BMI, which was considered a potential
mediator, was added to the model (model 3), the associations
were attenuated. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis
including only “confirmed cases” (Supplemental Table 2). In
these analyses, the associations were stronger.
Effect modification by BMI group (normal weight, over-
weight, or obese) and by intake of red and processed meat
(quartiles) was also investigated (Supplemental Table 3). For
men, the associations appeared similar across groups, but for
women no association was found among participants with a
high BMI and high intakes of red and processed meat. Excluding
those with prevalent self-reported acute myocardial infarction,
angina pectoris, stroke, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia
yielded similar results (data not shown).
The inverse association between whole grains and type
2 diabetes persisted after adjusting for potential mediating
variables, including intakes of dietary fiber and magnesium
and dietary glycemic index (Supplemental Table 4). Adjustment
for potential dietary confounders, including leafy vegeta-
bles, dairy products, sugar-sweetened beverages, coffee, and
vitamin D, did not change the association markedly (data not
shown).
Discussion
In this cohort study in 55,465 Danish men and women including
>7000 incident type 2 diabetes cases, we found that whole-
grain intake, expressed as whole-grain intake (grams per day) or
intake of whole-grain products (grams of product per day), was
associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. More specifically,
men and women with whole-grain intakes (grams per day) in
the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile
had an 34% and 22% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, respectively.
In general, all individual whole-grain cereal types and products
were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
Strengths of the study include the large number of cases
and the long follow-up period (median: 15 y). Furthermore, we
investigated both whole-grain intake and intake of whole-grain
products. Detailed information about whole-grain products
provided by 24-h dietary recalls in a subsample of our
study allowed us to estimate not only whole-grain product
intake but also whole-grain intake in grams per day, which
may provide a more precise measure for evaluation of the
association between whole-grain intake and type 2 diabetes.
Estimating both variables facilitates comparisons with other
studies (33). We used a cohort with a high and varied intake of
different whole-grain cereal types and products, which is a great
advantage, because cohort studies from outside of Scandinavia
usually have participants with whole-grain diets primarily based
on wheat and with more narrow intake ranges (42). We also had
information about the incidence of diabetes from the Danish
National Diabetes Register, which is >90% complete (35).
The study also has several potential limitations. Whole-
grain intake was assessed at baseline only, and it is possible
that the participants changed their diet, including their whole-
grain intake, during the long follow-up period. The baseline of
the Diet, Cancer, and Health Study was in 1993–1997 (43);
the National Diabetes Register is complete from 1 January
1995, but inclusion of cases started on 1 January 1990 (35).
Therefore, we set the baseline to 1 January 1995 for those
recruited before that date. Furthermore, we excluded prevalent
diabetes cases. We cannot rule out the possibility that, due to
incomplete register information before 1995, we might have
missed prevalent diabetes cases and counted them as incident
cases. The inclusion of prevalent cases and undiagnosed cases
may introduce reverse causation and outcome misclassification.
However, in our statistical analyses we partly considered this by
allowing for different underlying hazards during the first 3 y of
follow-up. If the study had been affected by reverse causality,
we would have expected it to bias the results toward unity.
Given that we found a robust, significant inverse association,
we do not believe reverse causality to be an issue of concern. In
the sensitivity analyses restricted to the “confirmed cases,” the
cases included based on the 2 criteria with the lowest sensitivity
and/or positive predictive value were excluded. This resulted
in point estimates that were stronger. Including cases on the
basis of a criterion with low sensitivity is not the main concern,
because the other criteria with higher sensitivity possibly will
identify the cases. The low positive predictive value (86%)
of one of the criteria may be a larger concern, because this
would misclassify noncases as cases, and thus the observed
associations would be weaker than the “true” associations.
Measurement of dietary exposure is a major challenge in

nutritional epidemiology (44), and measurement errors are
unavoidable. However, we expect measurement errors to be
nondifferential and they would therefore not lead to bias, rather
an attenuation of results toward the null and loss of statistical
power to detect true associations. Even though we thoroughly
checked and adjusted the analyses for potential confounders,
residual confounding cannot be ruled out.
Whole-grain intake has previously been shown to be
associated with a healthy lifestyle in the present cohort (32).
However, in general, the results changed only marginally when
comparing our model just adjusted for age with the final
adjusted model (model 1). We considered model 1 the final
model. In model 2, we further adjusted for total energy
(excluding energy from intake of red and processed meat and
alcohol) using the standard multivariate method (40). The
rationale for adjusting for energy excluding meat and alcohol
is that we already included meat and alcohol as potential
confounders in the model, and therefore it would not be correct
to include them both as the dietary covariates and in the energy
covariate. Adjusting for energy did not change the association
markedly (model 1 compared with model 2). The rationale for
adjusting for energy is, for example, to adjust for confounding
and to reduce extraneous variation (40). However, adjusting
for energy also introduces a nonspecified substitution; thus,
the interpretation of the findings is not straightforward, and
because of this and the small difference depending on whether
or not energy adjustment was made, we consider model 1
as the final model. The Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort is a
population-based cohort study, and 34% of the men and 37%
of the women invited participated in the study. Moreover, in
line with other cohort studies, the nonparticipants had lower
socioeconomic status (43). This may have introduced selection
bias, and it is likely that the nonparticipants would have less
healthy dietary habits and a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes.
However, we do not expect this to affect the validity of the
findings in the present study.
Our findings are in agreement with those for 16 previous
cohorts summarized in a recent meta-analysis (27). However,
there is limited knowledge of the association with whole grains
from different cereals and with different whole-grain products
because few studies have been able to separate exposure
measurements. In the present study, we found that the intake of
all cereals was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. In
a recent nested case-control study in a Scandinavian population,
in whom whole-grain intake was assessed with biomarkers, no
overall association was found with type 2 diabetes (22). In that
study, high whole-grain rye intake relative to whole-grain wheat
intake was associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk when using
the biomarker measure (alkylresorcinol C17:0 to C21:0 ratio),
which reflects the proportion of whole-grain rye to whole-grain
wheat and rye (45). In contrast, in the present study, both wheat
and rye were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. This
discrepancy between the studies may be due to a considerably
larger sample size in the present study or to the alkylresorcinol
C17:0 to C21:0 ratio reflecting biological processes unrelated
to whole-grain intake but associated with type 2 diabetes risk.
In a recent study in the same cohort as used in the present study,
it was shown that overall whole-grain intake, but intake of rye
and oats in particular, was inversely associated with the risk of
myocardial infarction (46). It is likely that similar intermediates
are at least partly are at play for both conditions. Different
cereals contain different amounts and types of dietary fiber and
bioactive compounds, which may cause differential effects on
health.However,in many human studies,this has not been taken
into account when evaluating the effect of total whole-grain
intake on cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals diagnosed
with diabetes and nondiabetic individuals, which could be one
reason why the results are mixed (11, 47, 48). For example,
whole-grain rye has specifically been shown to improve appetite
regulation and insulin secretion and sensitivity in intervention
studies in adults (11, 17, 49). This is most likely due to the
high dietary fiber content and coarse structure, which may slow
carbohydrate digestion and absorption and prolong satiety,
facilitating body-weight maintenance (15). Similarly, whole-
grain oats have been consistently shown to reduce plasma LDL
cholesterol (50), probably because of their viscous β-glucan
fibers, which lower bile acid reabsorption (51). Furthermore,
the impact of food processing mediated through differences in

HRs (95% CIs) for associations between quartiles of intake of whole-grain cereal types and intake of whole-grain products and risk

particle size, accessibility of nutrients, digestive enzymes, etc.,
on metabolic responses has been well illustrated in meal studies,
but the long-term impact for health has not yet been thoroughly
investigated (16, 17). Different food categories represent, to
some extent, differences in food processing. Unlike previous
studies on whole grains based on the Diet, Cancer, and Health
cohort (46), we did not include crisp bread as a whole-grain
product in the present study. This is because the crisp-bread
category contains both whole-grain and refined crisp breads,
with the majority being the latter, and based on the FFQ
data we were unfortunately unable to discriminate between the
2 types.

 Results from a meta-analysis show that cereal fiber, but not
fiber from fruit and vegetables, is associated with a lower risk
of type 2 diabetes (52). Fruit and vegetables mainly contain
soluble fibers and, in grains, this is predominantly found in
oats, whereas insoluble fiber is found in rye and wheat (4, 21).
Although the demonstrated effect of fiber on gastric emptying
and reduced postprandial glucose is mainly ascribed to soluble
fiber (4), we found an inverse association with type 2 diabetes
risk for both soluble fiber (oats) and insoluble fiber (wheat and
rye). This suggests than numerous mechanisms may explain the
findings. The gut microbiota has been suggested as a mediator
of health effects of fiber-rich foods such as whole grains (53–
55), but from recent studies it appears that the gut microbiota
may be an important determinant of response to whole-grain
intake rather than being easily altered as a result of a whole-
grain intervention (14, 56–59). As in most other prospective
cohort studies, stool samples were unfortunately not available
for the present study and therefore we were unable to investigate
the potential modifying effect of the gut microbiota.
In the previously mentioned meta-analysis on whole grains
and type 2 diabetes, a nonlinear association was found when
adjustment for BMI was made (7). Likewise, we found that
the results were attenuated when adjusting for BMI, but the
association was still linear and significant. A previous study
based on the same cohort found no association between
whole-grain intake and subsequent changes in anthropometric
measures (60), and thus the mediating effect of BMI may not be
the major underlying mechanism.
With regard to the generalizability of the results, the present
study included individuals aged 50–65 y at baseline, and thus
the age group would be expected to have a higher risk of
type 2 diabetes than younger people. In terms of public health
relevance, the study showed robust associations between whole
grains and type 2 diabetes. Thus, given the large prevalence
of type 2 diabetes, increasing whole-grain intake should be
recommended at the population level.
In conclusion, we found consistent inverse associations
between whole-grain intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Our findings are in line with accumulating evidence that whole
grains may be one of the most important food groups for the
prevention of type 2 diabetes.
