Association of Fluid Intelligence and Psychiatric Disorders
in a Population-Representative Sample of US Adolescents
Katherine M. Keyes, PhD; Jonathan Platt, MPH; Alan S. Kaufman, PhD; Katie A. McLaughlin, PhD
IMPORTANCE Despite long-standing interest in the association of psychiatric disorders with
intelligence, few population-based studies of psychiatric disorders have assessed intelligence.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of fluid intelligence with past-year and lifetime
psychiatric disorders, disorder age at onset, and disorder severity in a nationally
representative sample of US adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National sample of adolescents ascertained from
schools and households from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication–Adolescent
Supplement, collected 2001 through 2004. Face-to-face household interviews with
adolescents and questionnaires from parents were obtained. The data were analyzed from
February to December 2016. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed with the World Health
Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, and included a broad range of
fear, distress, behavior, substance use, and other disorders. Disorder severity was measured
with the Sheehan Disability Scale.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fluid IQ measured with the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test,
normed within the sample by 6-month age groups.
RESULTS The sample included 10 073 adolescents (mean [SD] age, 15.2 [1.50] years; 49.0%
female) with valid data on fluid intelligence. Lower mean (SE) IQ was observed among
adolescents with past-year bipolar disorder (94.2 [1.69]; P = .004), attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (96.3 [0.91]; P = .002), oppositional defiant disorder (97.3 [0.66];
P = .007), conduct disorder (97.1 [0.82]; P = .02), substance use disorders (alcohol abuse,
96.5 [0.67]; P < .001; drug abuse, 97.6 [0.64]; P = .02), and specific phobia (97.1 [0.39];
P = .001) after adjustment for a wide range of potential confounders. Intelligence was not
associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety disorders other
than specific phobia, and was positively associated with past-year major depression (mean
[SE], 100 [0.5]; P = .01). Associations of fluid intelligence with lifetime disorders that had
remitted were attenuated compared with past-year disorders, with the exception of
separation anxiety disorder. Multiple past-year disorders had a larger proportion of
adolescents less than 1 SD below the mean IQ range than those without a disorder. Across
disorders, higher disorder severity was associated with lower fluid intelligence. For example,
among adolescents with specific phobia, those with severe disorder had a mean (SE) of 4.4
(0.72) points lower IQ than those without severe disorder (P < .001), and those with alcohol
abuse had a mean (SE) of 5.6 (1.2) points lower IQ than those without severe disorder
(P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Numerous psychiatric disorders were associated with
reductions in fluid intelligence; associations were generally small in magnitude. Stronger
associations of current than past disorders with intelligence suggest that active symptoms of
psychiatric disorders interfere with cognitive functioning. Early identification and treatment
of children with mental disorders in school settings is critical to promote academic
achievement and long-term success.

any psychiatric disorders involve disruptions in
cognitive functioning. These encompass attention,
memory, language processing, and executive
functions.1-7 Given these patterns, there has been long-
standing interest in the association of psychiatric disorders
with intelligence.
Intelligence is a complex construct that has inspired a vo-
luminousliteratureregardingitsdefinition,measurement,and
implications. Modern conceptualizations typically acknowl-
edge a general intelligence factor (often referred to as g) as well
asnarrower,morespecificabilities(eg,processingspeed,visuo-
spatial reasoning, working memory).8(pp34-52),9 The specific
abilities encompassing intelligence continue to be debated,10,11
but a widely accepted model of cognitive abilities distin-
guishes between fluid and crystallized intelligence as 2 pri-
mary components.12 Fluid intelligence reflects reasoning and
the ability to solve novel problems; crystallized intelligence re-
flectsknowledgeandskillsthataretheresultofexperienceand
learning.13(pp87-120) Analysis of the structure of cognitive abili-
ties underlying intelligence suggests that fluid reasoning loads
moststronglyontothegeneralizedintelligencefactor14(pp115-142)
and is indistinguishable from g.15
To what extent are psychiatric disorders associated with
fluid intelligence? Modern examination of intelligence and
psychiatric disorders has been primarily limited to relatively
small, clinical samples. Poor performance on intelligence
tests has been documented in individuals with attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),16-20 conduct disorder
and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD),21-28 and posttrau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD).5,6,29 Associations of intelli-
gence with depression and anxiety disorders are inconsis-
tent across studies.21,30-33 The degree to which intelligence is
associated with most psychiatric disorders remains an open
question, given inherent biases in studies composed of clini-
cal samples and the lack of population-based studies that
measure intelligence.
One important question is whether associations of intel-
ligence with psychiatric disorders reflect that low intelli-
gence is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders or that changes
incognitivefunctioningareaconsequenceofdevelopingapsy-
chiatric disorder. While prospective data are optimal to adju-
dicate between these possibilities, to date such evidence ex-
ists only for disruptive behavior problems, indicating that low
intelligence prospectively predicts life-course–persistent an-
tisocial behavior, particularly for males.24,34 If low intelli-
genceassociatedwithotherpsychiatricdisordersreflectsacon-
sequence rather than risk factor for psychiatric disorders, we
would expect associations of intelligence to be stronger among
individuals who currently meet criteria for a disorder as com-
pared with those who have met criteria in the past but do not
currently. In contrast, if low IQ is a risk factor for psychiatric
disorders, we should observe associations of similar magni-
tude for both current and past disorders with IQ.

intelligence with a wide range of psychiatric disorders in a na-
tionally representative sample of US adolescents. We present
intelligence estimates for adolescents who currently meet cri-
teria for fear, distress, behavior, and substance use disorders,
as well as for those who met criteria in the past but not cur-
rently, and further examine associations between fluid intel-
ligence and psychiatric disorders by age at onset and severity
of disorder.
Methods
Sample
Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey Ado-
lescent Supplement (NCS-A), a nationally representative, face-
to-face survey of 13- to 18-year-olds sampled from the conti-
nental United States in 2001 to 2004.35 The sample was
selected through a dual-frame design, with adolescents re-
cruited from both schools and households.36-38 The sample in-
cluded 10 148 English-speaking adolescents, 10 073 (99.3%)
with valid outcome data that were analyzed in the present
study. Sample weights were created based on the 2000 Cen-
sus. More details on NCS-A sampling and weighting proce-
dures are available elsewhere.37-39
Writteninformedconsentfromadultsandassentfromado-
lescents were obtained. Each participant received $50 for par-
ticipation. The Human Subjects Committees of Harvard Medi-
calSchoolandtheUniversityofMichiganapprovedrecruitment
and consent procedures; the Institutional Review Board of
Columbia University approved the present analysis.
Measures
Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test
Adolescents completed the fluid intelligence portion of the
Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT),40,41 which assesses
fluid reasoning with 48 items. This task uses abstract matri-
ces similar to those developed by Raven,42 which are proto-
typical measures of fluid reasoning and general intelligence.43
The K-BIT Matrices test involves a series of progressively more
challengingitems.Testadministrationwasdiscontinuedwhen
an adolescent responded incorrectly to all items in a set (sets
include 5 items initially and 4 items for the last 2 sets). The
K-BIT (and its revision, the KBIT-2) is widely used among
children,40,44-50 adolescents,51-53 and adults54-56; the items on
the K-BIT have well-documented reliability across these
Key Points
Question What is the association between fluid intelligence and
psychiatric disorders among adolescents?
Findings Fluid intelligence was lower among adolescents who
met criteria for the following psychiatric disorders at the time of
intelligence testing: bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, oppositional disorder, conduct disorder,
substance use disorders, and specific phobia. Those with severe
disorders had the strongest association with IQ.
Meaning Active symptoms of psychiatric disorders may interfere
with cognitive functioning, and early identification and treatment
of children with mental disorders in school settings are critical to
promote academic achievement and long-term success.

samples, and results across samples correlate with reassess-
ments, suggesting that the interpretation of results across
samples has strong validity. Hereafter, we refer to fluid intel-
ligence on the K-BIT as IQ.
The K-BIT norms were created specifically for the NCS-A
by the test developer (A.S.K.), as the NCS-A is considerably
larger than the original normative sample for the K-BIT; in ad-
dition, the K-BIT was published in 1990, so its norms were out-
dated. Raw scores were generated based on the K-BIT manual
for 91.3% of tests, which were administered and scored ex-
actly as prescribed. An additional 8.4% of tests could be scored
despite deviations in test administration. For example, some
respondents were only asked the most difficult item in each
set. In these cases, the K-BIT score was imputed based on the
number of correct items and the level at which they met dis-
continuation criteria. A small percentage of cases (0.3%) were
excluded because of invalid test administration. No items were
scored for 397 participants; their score was imputed as the
mean of the 6-month age group. Scores were normed within
6-month age groups to a mean of 100 and standard deviation
of 15. The K-BIT Matrices test demonstrated good internal con-
sistency (Cronbach α = .90), comparable to the value of 0.88
reported in the K-BIT manual for ages 13 to 19 years.40 Explor-
atory factor analyses indicated that a 1-factor model ad-
equately fit the data.
Psychiatric Diagnoses
An adolescent version of the Composite International Diag-
nostic Interview for DSM-IV was used to assess psychiatric
disorders.35,36,39 Disorders were grouped into 5 empirically de-
fined clusters57: (1) fear disorders (specific phobia, agorapho-
bia, social phobia, panic disorder); (2) distress disorders (sepa-
ration anxiety disorder, PTSD, major depressive episode/
dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder); (3) behavior
disorders (ADHD, ODD, conduct disorder, eating disorders);
(4) substance use disorders (alcohol and drug abuse, with or
without dependence); and (5) bipolar disorder. Attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder is based on parent-report only.
Oppositional defiant disorder and depression combined par-
ent- and child-report of symptoms using an “or” rule.58,59 Chil-
dren and parents who endorsed symptoms of each psychiat-
ricdisorderwereaskedabouttheagesymptomsbegan.Clinical
reappraisal of children comparing Composite International Di-
agnostic Interview diagnoses to those assessed with a clinical
interview showed good concordance.39
Disorder Severity
Respondents who met criteria for a diagnosis completed the
Sheehan Disability Scales60 assessing the extent to which
symptoms of the disorder interfered with home life, school or
work, family relationships, and social life on a 0-to-10 Likert
scale. Consistent with prior research,61,62 severe impairment
was operationalized as a score of 7 or higher in any 1 of the 4
domains.
Covariates
Parental education (less than high school, high school gradu-
ate, some college, college degree or more), parental income
(<1.5, 1.5-3.0, 3.1-6.0, >6.0 times the poverty level), race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Asian,
other), age, nativity (US born vs not), number of siblings, and
birth order were adjusted for in all models. The mean (SE)
K-BIT score when all covariates were at their reference level
was 102.2 (1.75). In addition, lifetime disorders other than the
focal disorder being examined were adjusted for using
dichotomous indicators of any fear disorder, any distress dis-
order, any behavior disorder, any substance use disorder, and
bipolar disorder.
Statistical Analysis
We examined mean levels of fluid intelligence among those
meeting criteria for past-year and lifetime psychiatric disor-
ders using linear regression. Effect sizes were estimated using
the Cohen d. We examined the distribution of low (<1 SD be-
low the mean), average (within 1 SD of the mean), and high (>1
SD above the mean) fluid intelligence across disorder groups,
and estimated associations with past-year and lifetime psy-
chiatric disorders using generalized logit models. Sample sizes
for each disorder group (past year, lifetime but not current, and
by age at onset), as well as the no-disorder group, are pro-
vided in Table 1; cells with insufficient sample size (<10) were
not analyzed. In eTable 1 in the Supplement, we provide cell
sizes for those with a current disorder that began in the past
year and for those with a current disorder that began prior to
the past year. Finally, we examined whether sex and parent
income moderated the associations of mental disorders with
fluid intelligence and found no evidence of effect modifica-
tion. All analyses were estimated with survey design weights;
standard errors, estimated with Taylor series linearization
implemented in SAS, version 9.4 for Windows (IBM). A false
discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons was
applied to all analyses given the large number of statistical
tests.63
Results
Fluid Intelligence and Past-Year Psychiatric Disorders
Table 2 presents adjusted means and standardized β for the
association between fluid intelligence and past-year psychi-
atric disorder, as well as lifetime (but not past-year) disorder
(eTable2intheSupplementpresentsunadjustedmeans).Past-
year bipolar disorder was associated with the lowest average
fluid intelligence (mean [SE], 94.2 [1.69]; P = .004) followed
by behavior disorders, with ADHD (mean [SE], 96.3 [0.91];
P = .002), conduct disorder (mean [SE], 97.1 [0.82]; P = .02),
and ODD (mean [SE], 97.3 [0.66]; P = .007) each falling sig-
nificantly below the population mean. Past-year substance use
disorders were also associated with low IQ (mean [SE] for al-
cohol abuse, 96.5 [0.67]; P < .001; drug abuse, 97.6 [0.64];
P = .02). Of the fear and distress disorders, only past-year spe-
cific phobia (mean [SE], 97.1 [0.39]; P = .001) was associated
with low fluid intelligence. Past-year major depression was
associated with slightly higher fluid intelligence (mean [SE],
100 [0.5]; P = .01) compared with those with no distress dis-
orders. Fluid intelligence decreased as the number of current

disorders increased. Effect sizes for these associations are pro-
vided in eTable 3 in the Supplement. In eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment, we separate current disorders into those that began in
the past 12 months vs those that began earlier. There were no
significant associations between IQ and psychiatric disorders
fordisordersthatbeganinthepast12months(however,sample
sizes were small).
Fluid Intelligence and Lifetime Psychiatric Disorders
Adjusted means of fluid intelligence for those meeting crite-
ria for a lifetime but not current disorder are in Table 2 (eTable
5 in the Supplement presents adjusted means for lifetime dis-
orders, regardless of past-year status). Associations with fluid
intelligence were uniformly attenuated compared with past-
year disorders, with 1 exception: past separation anxiety dis-
order was associated with low IQ (mean [SE], 97.2 [0.61];
P = .01). No association was observed between fluid intelli-
gence and number of lifetime disorders.
Distribution of Fluid Intelligence by Psychiatric Disorder
Table 3 describes the proportion of adolescents with high, me-
dium, and low IQ by psychiatric disorder status. Adjusted mul-
tinomial odds ratios for these distributions are in Table 4. Mul-
tiple past-year disorders had a larger proportion of adolescents
in the low IQ range than those without a disorder, including
bipolar disorder, all behavior disorders, alcohol abuse, sepa-
ration anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and agoraphobia. The
pattern was largely similar for lifetime but not past-year dis-
orders, but was significant only for separation anxiety disor-
der, conduct disorder, and drug abuse. In eTable 6 in the
Supplement, we provide distributions of high, middle, and low
IQseparatingcurrentdisordersintothosebeginninginthepast
year vs earlier.
Fluid Intelligence by Psychiatric Disorder Severity
Table 5 shows associations between disorder severity and fluid
intelligence. Greater disorder severity was associated with
lower IQ across a wide range of disorders including all fear dis-
orders, generalized anxiety disorder, ODD, eating disorders, al-
cohol abuse, and bipolar disorder.
Fluid Intelligence by Psychiatric Disorder Age at Onset
eTables 7 to 9 in the Supplement provide unadjusted mean dif-
ferences in IQ, IQ distributions, and adjusted associations as
a function of disorder age at onset. Few differences emerged
by disorder age at onset.

Discussion
To our knowledge, the present study represents the first popu-
lation-based study examining association of fluid intelli-
gence with psychiatric disorders in US youth. Our analysis gen-
erates 3 central conclusions.
First, past-year bipolar disorder, disruptive behavior dis-
orders, and substance abuse were most strongly associated
with low fluid intelligence. Lower IQ has been documented
amongyouthswiththesedisordersinclinicalsamples.16-28,64,65
Our population estimates indicate that mean IQ was approxi-
mately one-third of a standard deviation (approximately 5
points) lower than average among youths with bipolar disor-
der, behavior disorders, and substance abuse.
The associations of behavior disorders with IQ were stron-
ger for current disorders than for disorders that had remitted.
This could reflect either that behavior disorder symptomatol-
ogyinterfereswithcognitivefunctioning,producinglowIQpri-
marily for those with active symptoms, or that low IQ is ob-
served among adolescents with behavior disorders that are
chronic and involve more severe symptoms. Few adolescents
had behavior disorder onsets in the past year, indicating that
current disorders primarily reflect chronic cases, and low IQ
was most consistently observed for adolescents with the most
severe disorders. Prospective studies have documented low
IQ as a precursor of behavior disorder onset.24,34 Our finding
that adolescents with more chronic, severe forms of behavior
disorder are most likely to have lower IQ is in line with these
findings, although it does not rule out the possibility that IQ
changes after onset of disorder explain at least a portion of the
observed associations.
Second, most fear and distress disorders were not associ-
ated with low IQ, with the exception of specific phobia and

separation anxiety disorder, which are among the earliest-
onset fear and distress disorders.57 Specific phobia, in particu-
lar,hasbeenshowntoexplainameaningfulproportionoflater-
onset mental disorders.66 These disorders thus appear to
represent an early liability to internalizing psychiatric disor-
ders; our results suggest that this liability may be associated
with low IQ. Past-year specific phobia was associated with IQ,
but lifetime disorder was not. Specific phobia is often a persis-
tent condition,66,67 and this pattern could reflect an associa-
tion of low IQ with persistent, but not transient, phobia. Alter-
natively, it may be that current symptoms of phobia interfered
with performance due to test anxiety. In contrast, separation
anxiety was related to IQ when experienced prior to the past
year but not currently. Given the high prevalence of these
disorders,66,68 greater research is needed on neuropsychologi-
cal correlates of early-onset fear and distress disorders.
We found no association between PTSD and IQ. This
diverges from prior research, which has consistently demon-
strated that low IQ is a risk factor for PTSD onset after
trauma.29,69-71 However, most prior work has been conducted

in military samples returning from active combat. Military
samples are not representative of the general population, nor
are they composed of adolescents in our age range. Further-
more, considerable disagreement exists regarding the valid-
ity of the association between IQ and PTSD in military
samples72,73 because IQ may select service members into
degree of combat exposure. Our results are not consistent
with theories that low IQ is a vulnerability factor for the
development of PTSD after trauma, at least among youth.
Third, past-year depression was associated with slightly
higher mean IQ, although we should note that the effect size
was small, but statistically significant due to the high preva-
lence of major depression in adolescence.74 It has frequently
been argued that children with very high IQ may exhibit higher
rates of bipolar disorder,75-77 as well as social withdrawal and
avoidance.78 We find no support for a link between high IQ and
bipolar disorder at the population level, but the observed as-
sociation with depression warrants further exploration be-
cause children with higher IQ may present with unique men-
tal health concerns.
Intelligence quotient was ascertained at the time of the in-
terview, precluding an assessment of the reciprocal relation
betweenmentaldisordersandcognitiveability.Althoughsome
ofthevarianceinIQisstableoverearlydevelopment,79,80there
is also substantial plasticity in IQ.42,79,81,82 While we cannot es-
tablish temporality, the associations of IQ with past-year dis-
orders were consistently stronger than for lifetime disorders
that had remitted. Although this could reflect a stronger in-
fluence of current symptoms on IQ than the reverse, the most
plausible interpretation of this pattern is that current symp-
toms reflect the most persistent disorders, suggesting that
lower IQ is associated with chronic psychiatric disorders rather
than transient disorders. Future studies should examine this
possibility, as measures of disorder duration were substan-
tially co-linear with age at onset, given the young age of NCS-A
participants.
Taken together, these findings indicate that children and
adolescents with psychiatric disorders face challenges in learn-
ing,memory,andreasoning.Thisunderscorestheneedforearly
identification of children with mental disorders to provide aca-
demic accommodations and treatment to promote long-term
success. Although accommodations are often made for chil-
dren with ADHD and behavior problems, our findings suggest
that children with early-onset fear and distress disorders and
adolescents with substance use disorders may also require in-
dividualized education plans and support. These findings also
provide fruitful hypotheses for future research. For example,
children with psychiatric disorders face lower educational and

occupational functioning; these results suggest that fluid in-
telligence may be a mechanism in this pathway, given that
higherIQisassociatedwithbetterschoolperformance.82,83This
remains to be examined in future studies.
Limitations
In addition to the limitation of a single time point of measure-
ment of IQ, other limitations should be considered. The K-BIT
was administered by lay interviewers, which may have in-
creased the frequency of protocol deviations in test adminis-
tration. Such deviations could have led to worse perfor-
mance among children with test-taking difficulties (eg, ADHD
or test anxiety). However, the K-BIT has been validated in chil-
dren with intellectual disability and other challenges,49,52,53
and the reliability of K-BIT Matrices was comparable for the
present sample and the standardization sample. Further-
more, the K-BIT is a “Level B” test, which permits examiners
without high qualifications to administer and interpret it. Psy-
chosis was not assessed in NCS-A given low prevalence in this
age group, precluding evaluation of associations with IQ. Fi-
nally, given the cross-sectional assessment, recall bias in re-
ports of past disorders likely contributed to underreporting of
pastdisorders,particularlythosethatwerelowinseverity.This
would make the IQ associations with lifetime disorders over-
estimates because they reflect more severe cases. Longitudi-
nal data are needed to determine the extent to which early-
onset psychiatric disorders that remit influence IQ.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, the present study is the largest assess-
ment of IQ in US children ever conducted, and results dem-
onstrate robust associations of IQ with a broad range of psy-
chiatric disorders, most notably for bipolar disorder and
behavior disorders—including ADHD, ODD, and conduct dis-
order, as well as specific phobia, separation anxiety, and sub-
stance use disorders. Although associations of IQ with bipo-
lar disorder and behavior disorders are consistent with prior
researchfromclinicalsamples,thosewithfearanddistressdis-
orders reveal novel relationships not observed in prior stud-
ies and call into question others, including the lack of asso-
ciationwithPTSD.Together,thesefindingsreflectthepotential
role of cognitive factors in the etiology of diverse forms of psy-
chiatric disorders, as well as how mental disorders may influ-
ence cognitive ability. Most importantly, this work highlights
the critical importance of early identification and treatment
of mental disorders in youth and the potential utility of ac-
commodationsinschoolsettingsforchildrenwithawiderange
of psychiatric disorders to promote long-term success.
