Background: Reference ranges for testosterone are essential for making a diagnosis of hypo-
gonadism in men.
Objective: To establish harmonized reference ranges for total testosterone in men that can be
applied across laboratories by cross-calibrating assays to a reference method and standard.
Population: The 9054 community-dwelling men in cohort studies in the United States and Europe:
Framingham Heart Study; European Male Aging Study; Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study; and
Male Sibling Study of Osteoporosis.
Methods: Testosterone concentrations in 100 participants in each of the four cohorts were mea-
sured using a reference method at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Generalized
additive models and Bland-Altman analyses supported the use of normalizing equations for
transformation between cohort-specific and CDC values. Normalizing equations, generated using
Passing-Bablok regression, were used to generate harmonized values, which were used to derive
standardized, age-specific reference ranges.
Results: Harmonization procedure reduced intercohort variation between testosterone measure-
ments in men of similar ages. In healthy nonobese men, 19 to 39 years, harmonized 2.5th, 5th, 50th,
95th, and 97.5th percentile values were 264, 303, 531, 852, and 916 ng/dL, respectively. Age-specific
harmonized testosterone concentrations in nonobese men were similar across cohorts and greater
than in all men.
Conclusion: Harmonized normal range in a healthy nonobese population of European and American
men, 19 to 39 years, is 264 to 916 ng/dL. A substantial proportion of intercohort variation in tes-
tosterone levels is due to assay differences. These data demonstrate the feasibility of generating
harmonized reference ranges for testosterone that can be applied to assays, which have been
calibrated to a reference method and calibrator. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1161–1173, 2017)

 T
he reference range refers to the distribution of the cir-
culating concentrations of a hormone or an analyte
in a specific population (1, 2). Rigorously derived ref-
erence ranges are essential for distinguishing healthy from
diseased individuals and constitute the foundation of our
contemporary approach to making the diagnosis of
clinical disorders.
Hypogonadism in men is a syndrome characterized
by a set of symptoms and signs of androgen deficiency
that occur in association with consistently low circulating
testosterone levels (3). The reference ranges provide the
basis for differentiating low from normal testosterone
levels, and are, therefore, essential for making the di-
agnosis of hypogonadism. We have published reference
ranges for circulating testosterone levels generated in
healthy nonobese men who were participants in the
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (4); similar data have
been published in other populations (5–11). However, an
important unresolved question is whether the reference
ranges generated in one population of men can be applied
more broadly to men in other geographic regions and
in other populations. The distribution of testosterone
concentrations could vary in men from different regions
due to interassay or interlaboratory differences, or bi-
ological or environmental factors.
The objective of this initiative of the Endocrine Society
was to compare the distribution of total testosterone
concentrations in epidemiologic studies that included
men from different geographic regions of the United
States and Europe and to generate consensus reference
ranges for total testosterone levels in men. We anticipated
that, notwithstanding the substantial interindividual
variation in testosterone levels observed within each
cohort, there would also be significant and correctable
variation in mean testosterone levels between cohorts
owing specifically to differences in measurement tech-
nology. We sought to minimize the influence of these
systematic differences by harmonizing all measurements
to a higher order standard prior to the estimation of
reference ranges.
Accordingly, serum testosterone levels were measured
in male participants of four epidemiologic studies: the
FHS, the European Male Aging Study (EMAS), the Os-
teoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the
Sibling Study of Osteoporosis (SIBLOS). Because dif-
ferent assays were used for measuring testosterone levels
in these four epidemiologic studies and because these
assays used different calibrators, the assays were cross-
calibrated centrally by measuring testosterone levels in
serum samples from a subset of men in each cohort in the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Clinical Reference Laboratory using an assay calibrated
with higher order reference materials and using serum-
based reference materials as additional accuracy con-
trols. By comparing these new CDC-derived values with
the original values obtained on these men from each
cohort, we developed normalizing equations permitting
translation from the original cohort-specific measure-
ments to the CDC standard, and then applied them to the
full sample of values in each cohort.
Because testosterone levels decline with advancing age,
we first generated reference ranges in healthy nonobese
young men, 19 to 39 years, as this approach based on
limits derived in a healthy young population has been
favored historically for analytes that exhibit clinically
meaningful age-related trends, such as estradiol and bone
mineral density. Because of the well-known effect of
obesity on testosterone levels and on age-related change
in testosterone levels, we present age-adjusted reference
ranges in nonobese men, and additionally for all men, by
decades of age.
Methods
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from institutional
review boards for human subject research at each participating
institution.
General approach
First,
fasting
morning
serum
samples
obtained
from
100 men from each of the four cohorts, in which testosterone
levels had previously been assayed locally, were transported to
the central laboratory at the CDC. These 100 men with previous
assay results from the local laboratory were chosen at random to
approximate the distribution of age and other factors within each
of the four cohorts. At CDC, testosterone concentrations were
measured on each sampleusing a higher order (a reference method
against which other methods are compared) liquid chromatog-
raphy tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method under the
supervision of Dr. Hubert Vesper. We then developed trans-
formational equations for each study describing the relationship
between the 100 local and 100 central measurements, providing
an estimate of the systematic variation in local measurements
from the reference standard. These normalizing equations were
applied to all testosterone levels measured in each of the four
cohorts to generate harmonized values. These harmonized mea-
surements were in turn used to derive standardized, age-specific
reference ranges in each of the four cohorts and overall.
The four cohort studies
The EMAS
The EMAS recruited 3369 men, aged 40 to 79 years, at eight
European centers (12, 13). The men, randomly selected from the
general population, were invited for study-related assessments,
including an interviewer-assisted questionnaire, performance
measures, and a fasting blood test before 10:00 AM. A total of
150 men were excluded because of pituitary, testicular, or
adrenal disease, or use of medications that affect sex-steroid
production or action, yielding an analytic sample of 3219 men.

 FHS
The original FHS cohort was established in 1948 by
recruiting 5209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62
from Framingham, Massachusetts. In 1971, the study enrolled
5124 of the original participants’ adult children and their
spouses, who constituted the Second Generation Cohort (Gen-
eration 2). The Generation 2 examination 7 was attended by
1625 men between 1998 and 2002. Exclusion of men with
prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy
(n = 8), men receiving testosterone therapy, and men with
missing testosterone data (n = 158) resulted in a sample of 1459
for Generation 2.
A Third Generation Cohort (4095 children of Generation 2,
referred to as Generation 3) was established in 2002 to 2005
(14) (http://nhbli.nih.gov/about/framingham). Of the 1912 men
who attended the first Generation 3 examination in 2002 to
2005, 1893 had total testosterone measurements, and 962
were #40 years, among whom 456 men of Generation 3 were
free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hy-
pertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity [body mass index
(BMI) .30 kg/m2] and constituted the reference sample. The
men who were receiving androgen deprivation therapy or had
undergone orchiectomy for prostate cancer or were taking
testosterone were excluded.
The FHS combined sample was created by combining
Generation 2 and Generation 3 samples. Generation 2 exam-
ination 7 was attended by 1625 men between 1998 and 2002.
Exclusion of men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen
deprivation therapy (n = 8), men receiving testosterone therapy,
and men with missing testosterone data (n = 158) resulted in a
sample of 1459 for Generation 2. This sample of 3352 men
(1459 men in Generation 2 plus 1893 men in Generation 3)
constituted the FHS combined sample.
The MrOS Study
MrOS, an observational study of the determinants of
fracture in older men, recruited 5994 community-dwelling
men $65 years at six US centers (15,16). Total testosterone
concentration was measured on fasting, morning specimens in
1583 randomly selected men. Among these, 95 were excluded
because of androgen or antiandrogen use, or orchiectomy,
resulting in an analytical sample of 1488 participants.
The Belgian SIBLOS
The SIBLOS is a population-based study of healthy young
men sampled in sibling pairs, who were recruited from the
population registries of three semirural or suburban commu-
nities around Ghent, Belgium (17, 18). A total of 1114 men, 25
to 45 years, was recruited over 24 months. A total of 113 men
were excluded because they had used medications affecting
androgen status, or had disorders affecting body composition or
bone metabolism. The included population of 1001 men con-
sisted of 424 pairs of brothers, 23 families with three brothers,
and 84 single participants whose brothers could not participate
in the study. Among these, testosterone measurements were
available for 995 men, who constituted the analytical sample.
The analytic sample included 729 men who were ,40 years of
age and had a BMI ,30 kg/m2.
Designation of analytic samples
We conducted three independent analyses of the harmo-
nized data.
Generation of reference ranges in healthy,
nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m2) young men
First, we selected men, 19 to 39 years, who were nonobese
(BMI ,30 kg/m2) and free of major comorbidities, as described
(4). Because men ,40 years were available only in the FHS and
SIBLOS studies, data for 1185 men meeting these criteria from
these cohorts were included in this analysis.
Age-specific reference ranges in nonobese men
We computed reference ranges for individuals with
BMI ,30 kg/m2 by decades of age (19 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59,
60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 to 99 years). There were 6933 men
from the four cohorts meeting this BMI criterion. The analyses
were first performed within each cohort, and then the cohorts
were combined to derive model-based estimates of age trends in
population quantiles.
Age-specific reference ranges in all men
We computed model-based estimates of population refer-
ence ranges for all men in each age range regardless of obesity
status, using combined data from all cohorts.
Hormone assays
FHS samples were obtained in the morning, after an over-
night fast of ;10 hours, typically between 7:30 and 8:30 AM.
The samples were frozen immediately and stored at 280°C until
the time of assay. We measured total testosterone in the FHS
samples using a LC-MS/MS assay, which has been described
(4, 19). The lower limit of quantitation was 2 ng/dL; no sample
was outside the linear range of 2 to 2000 ng/dL. The interassay
coefficient of variation was 15.8% at 12.0 ng/dL, 10.6% at
23.5 ng/dL, 7.9% at 48.6 ng/dL, 7.7% at 241 ng/dL, 4.4% at
532 ng/dL, and 3.3% at 1016 ng/dL, respectively. As part of the
CDCHormone Standardization Program, quality control samples
provided by the CDC were run every 3 months; the coefficient of
variation in quality control samples with testosterone concen-
trations in 100 to 1000 ng/dL range was consistently ,6%.
Total testosterone levels in the EMAS (20) and MrOS (21)
samples were measured using gas chromotography tandem
mass spectrometry with sensitivities of 5 ng/dL and 2.5 ng/dL,
respectively. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation
in the low, medium, and high pools were 4.3%, 5.5%, and
4.9%, and 2.4%, 8.1%, and 2.5%, respectively.
Testosterone levels in the SIBLOS were measured in serum
samples that were obtained between 8:00 and 10:00 AM after
overnight fasting, and stored at 280°C. Testosterone was
measured by LC-MS/MS using an AB Sciex 5500 triple-
quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Toronto, Canada)
and Shimadzu liquid chromatography system, and validated
against an isotope dilution mass spectrometry reference method
(22). The interassay coefficient of variation was 6.5% at 3 ng/dL,
lower limit of quantitation 1 ng/dL, and recovery between 96%
and 104%.
Cross-calibration of assays in the CDC Clinical
Reference Laboratory
Approximately 100 randomly selected samples from each
cohort were shipped on dry ice to the CDC, where they were
stored at 270°C until analysis. Serum total testosterone levels
were measured using a reference LC-MS/MS method (23). In
brief, testosterone was isolated from serum by two serial

 liquid–liquid extraction steps and quantified with [13C] stable
isotope–labeled testosterone as the internal standard. The im-
precision of the method at 15.2, 228, and 886 ng/dL was 4.8%,
3.7%, and 3.8%, respectively. Agreement with established
quality control limits was assessed using standard procedures
(24). In addition, two serum materials with reference values
assigned by an internationally recognized reference laboratory
(target values: 265 and 513 ng/dL) were analyzed to assess the
accuracy of each analytical run. The difference from the target
values averaged 0.31%.
Statistical analysis
Harmonization of testosterone measurements
across cohorts
In exploratory analyses, we used Generalized Additive Models
to assess the best functional form of association between the local
and the central values within each group of 100 representative
individuals. Bootstrapping was used to quantify uncertainty in
the estimates of these associations. Additionally, Bland–Altman
analyses were used to assess the degree to which differences
between local and central measurements tracked with the level of
testosterone concentrations. These assessments supported a
model of linear correspondence between local and central
measurements after log transformation to reduce the influence of
outlying values, counteract modest heteroscedasticity on the
natural scale, and to insure that transformations would yield no
negative values. Normalizing equations for each of the four
cohorts describing the local to central transformation were
generated using orthogonal Passing-Bablok regression, which has
superior performance to other methods in the presence of outliers
and irregularities (25). Each of the normalizing transformations
was then applied to local testosterone measurements obtained
from the corresponding cohort.
Derivation of estimated quantiles of
testosterone distributions
For each cohort and age range, we obtained simple sample
quantiles as estimates of their population counterparts using a
method that is median unbiased and robust to statistical
transformation (25–27). Unified estimates of age group-specific
population quantiles combining all data were obtained from the
four cohorts using a semiparametric growth curve model under
the assumption that testosterone levels are monotonically
nonincreasing with age (28). All population centiles were es-
timated simultaneously, permitting restriction such that centile
curves do not cross (e.g., estimates of the 40th percentile are no
greater than those of the 50th at all ages).
Reference ranges in healthy nonobese young men
We computed the population centiles among nonobese
men, 19 to 39 years, without major comorbidities in the FHS
Generation 3 and the SIBLOS samples, which had recruited men
in this age range. Study and age subcohort–specific reference
ranges were then derived by estimation of the relevant per-
centiles. Consistent with the approach used for defining refer-
ence limits for many other analytes, total testosterone
values ,2.5th percentile were deemed low (29).
All analyses were performed using R version 3.3.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Subject characteristics
The characteristics of the 9054 qualifying participants
from the four cohorts are summarized in Table 1.
Harmonization of testosterone concentrations
across epidemiologic studies
Exploratory generalized additive models describing
the association between local and central measurements
supported linear transformation of local to central mea-
surements (Fig. 1, left panels). Visual assessment of
the bootstrapped smooths overlaid on estimated mean
trends also suggested that such transformations were
reasonable. Bland–Altman analyses (Fig. 1, right panels)
indicated some association between testosterone con-
centrations and the magnitude of the difference between
methods, with the absolute difference between local and
centralized values being greater at higher concentrations
in all but the SIBLOS study. The transformations derived
from the use of the Passing-Bablok procedure (Supplemental
Table 1) displayed good overall agreement between central
and local testosterone values in all four cohorts. The har-
monization resulted in some decrease in most measurements
from FHS (Fig. 1): some increase in most measurements
from MrOS, with less substantial shifts in the EMAS and
SIBLOS. Although we have previously observed substantial
intercohort variation in locally measured testosterone levels
(4), the harmonization procedure was successful in sub-
stantially reducing intercohort variation between measure-
ments, such that they resulted in greater similarity in the
distribution and means of estimated testosterone levels in
men of similar ages, as can be observed in Fig. 2. For in-
stance, locally generated values for men of age 40 to 49 years
yielded mean testosterone measurements of 501, 551, and
618 ng/dL in EMAS, SIBLOS, and FHS, respectively. After
harmonization, the corresponding values were 487, 494,
and 471 ng/dL, respectively. Similarly, local measurements
on men of age 70 to 79 years yielded mean testosterone
measurements of 397, 470, and 575 ng/dL in MrOS, EMAS,
and FHS, respectively, whereas after harmonization the
corresponding values were 489, 455, and 438, respectively.
These observations provide empirical support for the hy-
pothesis that measurement variation is a contributor to
observations of variation in age-specific estimates of mean
testosterone concentrations across cohorts, and lend support
for the objective of establishing reference ranges after
combining harmonized data from multiple cohorts.

 Generation 3 and the SIBLOS study was remarkably
similar (Table 2, top). After harmonization, the median
testosterone was ;530 ng/dL, and the mean 550 ng/dL in
each of the two cohorts. The 2.5th percentile values for
harmonized total testosterone concentrations in healthy
nonobese men in the FHS and SIBLOS studies were 265
and 264 ng/dL, respectively, and the corresponding
97.5th percentile values were 923 and 916 ng/dL, re-
spectively. Consistent with the findings of two other
studies (30, 31), the total testosterone levels were higher
in nonobese healthy men than in all men (Table 2, bot-
tom). The greater difference observed between the overall
young participant samples in FHS and SIBLOS than
observed in the healthy nonobese young sample is con-
sistent with the difference in the design of these two
studies; whereas some FHS participants carry diagnoses
of comorbid conditions, the SIBLOS participants were
screened so that the eligible participants were free of
comorbid conditions.
Age-specific distribution of testosterone levels and
intercohort variation
Figure 2 illustrates age range–specific testosterone
levels based on harmonized measurements, plotted sep-
arately for each of the four cohorts. As noted previously,
the harmonization procedure reduces but does not en-
tirely remove the intercohort variation in mean testos-
terone levels. The observed cross-sectional trend
suggesting decrease in testosterone concentrations with
age is of lesser magnitude than the corresponding
within-individual trend observed previously (31).
Table 3 describes the distribution of harmonized
reference ranges by decades of age in nonobese men.
Although the 2.5th and 5th percentiles generally de-
creased with age, this was less the case for values at the
upper end of the distribution, which tended to fluctuate
across the age groups. However, as expected, values in
nonobese men at all percentiles tended to be greater
than those derived from all (obese and nonobese)
participants.
Table 4 provides age-specific estimates of the per-
centiles of total testosterone distribution derived from all
studies combined, after harmonization, using constrained
quantile regression models. As is the case with the ex-
ploratory estimates described in Table 3, we observed
age-related decreases in concentrations at the lower end
of the distributions, whereas the upper centiles were
largely stable across the age groups. Thus, among non-
obese men, the age-specific 95th percentile estimates lie
in a tight range (839 to 850 ng/dL), whereas the 5th
percentile estimates vary more substantially, ranging
from 304 in men 19 to 39 years of age to 252 in those 70
to 79 and 218 in those 80 and above.
Discussion
These data show that the cross-calibration of assays
using a higher order standard and a higher order assay
in a central laboratory provides substantial reduction in
intercohort variation. This suggests that measurement
variation contributes to the previously observed variation
in mean testosterone levels among epidemiological co-
horts from different geographic regions, the substantial
interindividual variation in hormone levels within any
cohort notwithstanding. The distribution of harmonized
total testosterone values in healthy nonobese young men
was very similar between the FHS Generation 3 and the
Table 1.

 SIBLOS cohorts—2 geographically distinct cohorts. The
2.5th, 5th, 50th, 95th, and 97.5th percentile values in
healthy nonobese young men were 264, 303, 531, 852,
and 916 ng/dL, respectively (Table 2). We conclude that
standardized hormone measurements calibrated to a
higher order benchmark, such as that offered by the CDC
Clinical Reference Laboratory, provide a rational and
feasible approach to generating harmonized reference
ranges for testosterone and possibly other analytes.
These reference ranges were derived from single morning
samples and discounted the intraindividual variation in
testosterone levels due to pulsatile, diurnal, and circannual
secretory rhythms. Previous analyses by our groups and
others have shown that early morning testosterone levels,

harmonization (upper panel) and after harmonization (lower panel). The lower and upper boundaries of the box represent the 25th and 75th

 obtained in a manner similar to that used by clinicians in
practice, are associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally
with symptoms and clinical outcomes (4, 13, 32, 33). The
assays were performed in samples stored at 280°C. Al-
though the stability of cholesterol levels has been demon-
strated in FHS over a period of 15 years, the long-term
effects of storage at 280°C on testosterone concentra-
tions have not been clearly demonstrated.
Although the cohorts included in these analyses were
diverse in morbidity, age, and geographic location, they
were largely composed of men who identify as white
within a US or European social context. Significant geo-
graphic and racial differences in sex-steroid levels, which
have been reported in some studies (34, 35) but not in other
studies (36), might have important implications for clinical
decision making. It might therefore be important to de-
velop larger investigations of multiracial, multiethnic, and
more geographically diverse cohorts to confirm applica-
bility of reference ranges to broader populations.
Several important conceptual issues remain unre-
solved. Should the reference range be based on a sample
of healthy young men (the so-called T-score approach) or
should the reference range be age adjusted (the Z-score
approach)? We have provided reference ranges in a
young healthy reference sample as well as by decades of
age. The rationale for generating the reference range in
healthy young men is similar to the use of bone mineral
density T-scores for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. For
analytes that exhibit substantial age-related change, such
as testosterone and estradiol, it might arguably be more
appropriate to derive the reference ranges in a healthy
young population. Notably, results obtained in this study
show a lesser age trend than that reported previously in
cross-sectional
analyses
of
men
of
different
ages,
underscoring the need for longitudinal studies of the
effects of aging on sex steroid concentrations.
Another unresolved issue relates to whether the ref-
erence sample should include only the healthy nonobese
men or whether it should include the entire population of
men 19 to 39 years. Obesity and comorbid conditions
affect circulating total testosterone concentrations (31,
37); therefore, inclusion of obese and men with comorbid
conditions could distort the reference ranges. Whether
the reference ranges generated in nonobese men are ap-
propriate for use in obese men deserves further in-
vestigation. Even though men with known diagnoses of
conditions or diseases associated with hypogonadism
were excluded, it is possible a small percentage of in-
dividuals in these cohorts may be hypogonadal.
Historical experience with cholesterol, hemoglobin
A1C, and vitamin D assays indicates that the application
of reference ranges across laboratories and across geo-
graphic regions is a challenging process that requires
mechanisms for standardizing assays and an understand-
ing of biological as well as social differences in the
distribution of the analyte (38, 39). The CDC Hormone

 Standardization Program for testosterone is an impor-
tant step to address this challenge, which will facilitate
the application of these reference ranges across lab-
oratories. The harmonized references ranges can be
helpful to clinicians in facilitating clinical decision
making and in improving patient care. The data re-
ported in this work illustrate the promise and feasi-
bility of generating reference ranges using harmonized
values that can be applied across different geographic
regions of the world to CDC-certified laboratories
that use a common calibrator. Such calibrators for
testosterone and some other analytes are now avail-
able from the National Institute of Standards and
Technologies.
Further validation of these harmonized reference
ranges using outcomes data from longitudinal studies and
randomized trials is an essential next step. Validation of
reference ranges is a complex multistep process, which
should include evaluation of the relation of varying
degrees of deviation from the reference range with
androgen-dependent outcomes (e.g., sexual symptoms,
hemoglobin, bone mineral density) in epidemiologic
cohorts. Men with varying degree of deviation from the
harmonized threshold would be expected to be sub-
stantially more likely to have symptoms/conditions typ-
ical of androgen deficiency. Furthermore, in randomized
testosterone trials, the men with testosterone levels below
the harmonized threshold would be more likely to re-
spond to testosterone therapy than those with testos-
terone levels above the harmonized threshold. Indeed,
recent data from the Testosterone Trials demonstrated
that men with an average of two morning total testos-
terone levels ,275 ng/dL exhibited improvements in

Reference Ranges for Testosterone in Men

 sexual activity and several domains of sexual function
(40). In contrast, in the Testosterone Effects on Ath-
erosclerosis Progression in Aging Men Trial (41) of
men, 60 and older, whose mean testosterone level was
.300 ng/dL, testosterone administration did not im-
prove sexual function. Eventually, the specificity, sensi-
tivity, and predictive value of these harmonized reference
ranges should be evaluated in clinical populations of men
seeking medical care.
In summary, these data demonstrate the feasibility
and potential value of generating harmonized reference
ranges for testosterone concentrations, whose serum total
testosterone concentrations have been measured in a
CDC-certified laboratory. There was a remarkable
concordance in age-adjusted harmonized testosterone
levels among men in four geographically distinct cohorts,
suggesting that intercohort variation may be influenced
by interassay variation. Further studies of the distribution
of testosterone concentrations in other racial and ethnic
groups and in populations in other regions of the world
are needed to demonstrate the applicability of these
ranges to broader populations of men in different regions
of the United States and the world.
