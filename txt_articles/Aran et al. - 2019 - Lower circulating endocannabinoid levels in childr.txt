Abstract
Background: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a major regulator of synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation.
Alterations of the ECS have been demonstrated in several animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In
some of these models, activating the ECS rescued the social deficits. Evidence for dysregulations of the ECS in
human ASD are emerging, but comprehensive assessments and correlations with disease characteristics have not
been reported yet.
Methods: Serum levels of the main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA or anandamide) and
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and their related endogenous compounds, arachidonic acid (AA), N-palmitoylethanolamine
(PEA), and N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in 93
children with ASD (age = 13.1 ± 4.1, range 6–21; 79% boys) and 93 age- and gender-matched neurotypical children
(age = 11.8 ± 4.3, range 5.5–21; 79% boys). Results were associated with gender and use of medications, and were
correlated with age, BMI, and adaptive functioning of ASD participants as reflected by scores of Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II (VABS-II), and Social Responsiveness Scale-II (SRS-2).
Results: Children with ASD had lower levels (pmol/mL, mean ± SEM) of AEA (0.722 ± 0.045 vs. 1.252 ± 0.072, P < 0.0001,
effect size 0.91), OEA (17.3 ± 0.80 vs. 27.8 ± 1.44, P < 0.0001, effect size 0.94), and PEA (4.93 ± 0.32 vs. 7.15 ± 0.37,
P < 0.0001, effect size 0.65), but not AA and 2-AG. Serum levels of AEA, OEA, and PEA were not significantly associated
or correlated with age, gender, BMI, medications, and adaptive functioning of ASD participants. In children with ASD,
but not in the control group, younger age and lower BMI tended to correlate with lower AEA levels. However, these
correlations were not statistically significant after a correction for multiple comparisons.
Conclusions: We found lower serum levels of AEA, PEA, and OEA in children with ASD. Further studies are needed to
determine whether circulating endocannabinoid levels can be used as stratification biomarkers that identify clinically
significant subgroups within the autism spectrum and if they reflect lower endocannabinoid “tone” in the brain, as
found in animal models of ASD.

 Introduction
Cannabis has a well-known effect on social behavior in
humans [1]. It enhances interpersonal communication [2]
and decreases hostile feelings [3]. The principle unique
compounds in the cannabis plant (phytocannabinoids) are
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).
The main target of THC in the brain is the cannabinoid
type-1 receptor (CB1R), which is highly expressed in the
frontal cortex and subcortical areas associated with social
functioning [4]. The CB1R and its endogenous ligands
N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide or AEA) and
2-arachidonoil-glycerol (2-AG) regulate social play and
anxiety in animal models [5–7] and in humans [8, 9].
Pharmacological
and
genetic
experiments
in
animal
models
suggest
that
social
reward
is
regulated
by
oxytocin-dependent activation of the endocannabinoid
system (ECS) in the nucleus accumbens, the primary re-
warding center in the brain [10]. Moreover, the ECS is a
major regulator of synaptic plasticity (excitatory and in-
hibitory) through long-term potentiation and long-term
depression [11].
Endocannabinoids (AEA and 2-AG) are usually pro-
duced “on demand” in the post-synaptic neuron and act
as retrograde signaling messengers. By activating CB1R
in the pre-synaptic neuron, both endogenous ligands
result in decreased release of neurotransmitters into the
synaptic cleft and attenuate over-active brain circuits
[11]. Reduced endocannabinoid “tone” was suggested to
be involved in the pathogenesis of ASD in several animal
models: monogenic (fragile X [12, 13], neuroligin 3 [14]),
polygenic (BTBR [15]), and environmental (rat valproic acid
[16, 17]). Activation of the ECS in these and other models
of ASD reversed the autistic symptoms [13, 15, 17–23].
Several human studies revealed associations between
polymorphisms in the gene encoding CB1R and emo-
tions’ processing [24–26]. Other studies demonstrated
reduced expression of CB1R in postmortem brains of in-
dividuals with autism [27] as well as reduced plasma
AEA levels in children with ASD [28]. However, these
studies were not designed to comprehensively characterize
the involvement of the ECS in the pathogenesis of ASD.
Therefore, we assessed the circulating levels of several
endocannabinoids and delineate the correlations between
their levels and disease characteristics in a large group of
children with ASD and their matched controls with typical
development.
Methods
Participants
One hundred and eighty-six children and young adults,
age 5.5 to 21 years, participated in this study. Ninety-three
participants with ASD had been recruited as part of an
ongoing randomized clinical trial (NCT02956226) that
assesses the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of two CBD
compounds in 150 participants with ASD and behavioral
problems. Legal guardians of 93 participants consented to
the assessment of serum endocannabinoids at baseline.
Ninety-three unrelated, age- and gender-matched, control
participants, attending or graduating regular education
and without any neuropsychiatric diagnosis other than
ADHD, were recruited through advertisements posted in
the surrounding community. Participant characteristics
are presented in Table 1.
Behavioral assessments
Behavioral assessments included a confirmation of ASD
diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [29] criteria
and the autism diagnostic observation schedule second
edition (ADOS-2) [30] and the following assessments:
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II (VABS-II) [31].
The VABS is a semi-structured caregiver interview de-
signed to assess functional skills in five domains, each
with two to three subdomains. The main domains are
communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor
skills, and maladaptive behavior.

 Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) Lifetime
Form [32]. This is a 40-item, parent-report screening
measure. The SCQ total score comprises items assessing
reciprocal social interaction, communication, and re-
stricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
Childhood Autism Rating Scale-second edition (CARS2-ST)
[33]. This is a quantitative measure of direct behavior ob-
servation consists of 15 scales that cover various aspects
of interactive behavior—communication, body use, the
child’s response to stimuli, and activity level.
Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Dis-
order (HSQ-ASD) [34]. This is a 24-item parent-rated
measure of non-compliant behavior in children with
ASD. The HSQ-ASD was translated into Hebrew with
the permission of the authors using a translation and re-
translation by two bilingual professionals and validated
for this study.
Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-validated Hebrew ver-
sion) [35, 36]. A screening tool of emotional and behav-
ioral problems in 4- to 18-year-old children. The CBCL
generates three broadband results—an internalizing score,
an externalizing score (summing up non-compliant scale
and aggressive behavior scale), and a total score. For this
study, we used the externalizing section only.
Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI) [37]. This is a
13-item parent-rated measure designed to assess the ef-
fect of interventions to control disruptive behavior in
children with ASD on parenting stress.
Social Responsiveness Scale-II (SRS-2, Hebrew version)
[38, 39]. This is a 69–71 item, caregiver (pSRS) or
teacher (tSRS) questionnaire, used to determine the se-
verity of social deficit exhibited by participants with
ASD. The SRS contains five subscales: social awareness,
social cognition, social communication, social motiv-
ation, and autistic mannerisms, which respectively meas-
ure the ability to recognize social cues, the ability to
interpret social cues, the ability to use expressive verbal
and non-verbal language skills, the ability to engage in
social-interpersonal behaviors, and the tendency to dis-
play stereotypical behaviors and restricted interests char-
acteristic of autism.
Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) [40]. This
is a 7-point scale designed to measure severity of illness
(CGI-S) by trained clinicians. Scores in the severity scale
range from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most
severely ill patients).
Sample preparation and endocannabinoids
measurements
Blood collection was performed between 10 am and 2
pm. Whole blood samples were collected into 5 mL
VACUETTE® Serum Clot Activator Tubes (VWR, PA,
USA), and after 30 min were centrifuged (3000×g at 4 °C
for 10 min). The serum fraction was aliquoted into poly-
propylene tubes and immediately stored at − 80 °C.
The extraction, purification, and quantification of
serum endocannabinoids were performed by stable iso-
tope dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC-MS/MS) as previously described [41].
Briefly, AEA, 2-AG, arachidonic acid (AA), N-palmitoy-
lethanolamine (PEA), and N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA)
in serum samples were extracted, purified, and quanti-
fied using the stable isotope dilution LC-MS technique.
Total proteins were first precipitated using ice-cold acet-
one and Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0). Next, samples were
homogenized using a mixture of 0.5 mL ice-cold metha-
nol/Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0), 1:1, and 7 μL internal
standard (22.4 ng d4-AEA). Following this, the homoge-
nates were extracted using ice-cold CHCl3:MeOH (2:1, v/v)
after they were washed with ice-cold chloroform three
times. The samples were then dried under thin stream of
nitrogen and reconstituted in MeOH. Analysis by LC-MS
was conducted on an AB Sciex (Framingham, MA, USA)
Triple Quad 5500 Mass Spectrometer and a Shimadzu
(Kyoto, Japan) UHPLC System, while the liquid chromato-
graphic separation was acquired via a Kinetex (Phenomenex)
column (C18, 2.6 mm particle size, 100*2.1 mm). Sample
levels of AEA, 2-AG, AA, PEA, and OEA were measured
against a standard curve and then expressed as pmol/mL.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. Continuous
variables are presented as mean ± SD with the exception
of the serum endocannabinoid levels that are being pre-
sented as mean ± SEM, as specified in the text. To test
the differences in continuous variables between partici-
pants with ASD and neurotypical control group, the in-
dependent samples t test was performed, a correction
for multiple comparisons was conducted using Bonfer-
roni correction. The Mann-Whitney test was not needed
based on normal/near normal distribution of OEA, PEA,
and AEA. Associations between nominal variables were
performed with the Pearson χ2 test. Pearson correlation
was used to test the correlation between endocannabi-
noids’ levels and demographic parameters or adaptive
functioning of participants. A multivariate logistic re-
gression analysis was performed to test the independent
association between the serum endocannabinoid levels
and ASD status, adjusting for age, gender, and BMI,
which are potential confounders.
A linear regression analysis was performed to test the
correlations of serum endocannabinoid levels with age,
gender, and BMI. Finally, to ease clinical interpretation
and sensitivity analysis, endocannabinoids were analyzed
also as dichotomous variables defined by a cut-off of
below the 25th percentile (first quartile) value for each

 endocannabinoid in the control group. P < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant for all analyses.
Results

structurally related compounds OEA and PEA were lower
in
children

and

molecule AA were not significantly different between
groups [2-AG 29.91 ± 5.29 vs. 18.92 ± 1.89, P = 0.12;
AA 2092 ± 93 vs. 2228 ± 133, P = 0.39; ASD vs. control,
pmol/mL, mean ± SEM].
Serum endocannabinoids differentiated ASD and controls
Serum levels of AEA, OEA, and PEA were independently
associated with ASD status when adjusting for age, gender,
BMI, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
status. (Additional file 1: Table S1, P = 0.001, 0.01 and
0.007, respectively). Cut-off level for AEA, OEA, and
PEA were set at the 25th percentile (first quartile)
value in the control group. These values are pre-
sented in Table 2 with sensitivity and specificity in
ASD detection and P values.
Impact of age, gender, and BMI on serum
endocannabinoid levels
Difference in endocannabinoid levels between genders
and correlations with age and BMI appear in Table 3.
Younger and thinner children with ASD had lower levels
of serum AEA (Table 3). However, these correlations did
not remain significant after a correction for multiple
comparisons. No other significant correlations of AEA,
OEA, and PEA with age and BMI or associations with
gender were found.
Impact of ADHD symptoms, ASD severity, comorbidity,
and use of medications on serum endocannabinoid levels
Correlations of circulating AEA, OEA, and PEA levels
with adaptive functioning and associations with ADHD,
epilepsy comorbidity, use of medications and history of
prenatal complications are presented in Table 4 and
Figs. 2, 3, and 4. No significant correlations or associa-
tions were found. Some tendency toward a correlation
was observed for AEA with APSI (R = 0.19, P = 0.06) and
with use of antipsychotic medications (R = 0.18, P = 0.07).
Children with higher APSI severity score or with higher
use of antipsychotics had lower AEA levels.
Discussion
This study provides evidence that serum levels of certain
endocannabinoids are substantially decreased in people
with ASD across age groups, adaptive functioning, BMIs,
and in both genders. The most studied endogenous li-
gands of CB1R and cannabinoid type-2 receptor (CB2R)
are AEA and 2-AG. We detected decreased serum con-
centrations of AEA and its structurally related compounds

 OEA and PEA with no significant differences in serum
2-AG and its breakdown molecule, AA. OEA and PEA are
widely distributed in the CNS, but their classification as
endocannabinoids is debatable, given their lack of affinity
for CB1R and CB2R. Similar to AEA, they are, however,
agonists for PPARα and GPR119 (Fig. 5).
Endocannabinoids are not stored in any cellular com-
partment for later use. They are generated on demand at
the post-synaptic neuron cell membrane and are rapidly
inactivated by pre-synaptic neuron cellular uptake and
enzymatic hydrolysis (Fig. 5). As a result, the concentra-
tions of the various endocannabinoids in the brain are
constantly regulated, and even small changes might be
clinically meaningful and reveal brain pathology.
Circulating endocannabinoids are believed to come
from multiple organs and tissues, including the brain,
skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, and kidney as well
as circulating cells [42]. However, plasma endocannabi-
noid levels were demonstrated to reflect brain concen-
trations [43], and hence these biomarkers are not only
accessible, easy to measure, and cost-effective but can
also shed a light on the pathophysiology of CNS disor-
ders. Indeed, dysregulation of the ECS was demonstrated
in many different models of ASD [44] and some of these
studies
convincingly
illuminate
previously
unknown
pathophysiological mechanisms. For example, prenatal
exposure of rats to valproic acid is known to induce se-
lective deficits in social play behavior and stereotypies in
the offspring. In a recent study, prenatal exposure of rats
to valproic acid was demonstrated to alter phosphoryl-
ation of CB1R, and enhancing AEA signaling through
inhibition of its degradation reversed the behavioral defi-
cits displayed by valproic acid-exposed animals [17].
Despite extensive evidence of the involvement of the
ECS in animal models of ASD, human studies are sparse.
Recently, Karhson and colleagues demonstrated lower
levels of AEA in stored plasma samples of 59 young
children (aged 3–12 years) with ASD and 53 neurotypi-
cal children (P = 0.034). This study was not powered to
determine the relationship between plasma AEA con-
centrations and ASD symptom severity. The current
study corroborates their finding of lower circulating
AEA levels in ASD in a larger cohort and older age
group, and indicates that substantial difference exists
also in the levels of the AEA-like molecules PEA and
OEA, but not in the levels of the other principle endo-
cannabinoid, 2-AG. Future studies should explore pos-
sible explanations for these findings such as reduced
activity
of
N-acyl
phosphatidylethanolamine-specific
phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), the enzyme that synthesizes
these 3 endocannabinoids, as was suggested by Siniscalco
et al. [45] or increased activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH), the enzyme that degrades them.
Notably, dysregulation of the ECS have been also
implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy [46–48], lead-
ing eventually to phase 3 clinical studies of CBD, a
non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid, for refractory epi-
lepsy [49–51], and the recent approval of CBD by the
US Food and Drug Administration to treat severe forms
of
epilepsy
(Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome
and
Dravet
syndrome) (https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/
PressAnnouncements/ucm611046.htm).

 are of specific importance for people with ASD, as 10–30%
of people with ASD have comorbid epilepsy [52], and sev-
eral synaptic plasticity pathways appear to be involved in
both disease processes [11]. Moreover, our findings point
to a theoretical mechanism by which CBD might compen-
sate for ECS dysregulation in ASD.
Similar to OEA and PEA, CBD has a very low affinity
to CB1R and CB2R and like AEA, OEA, and PEA it may
exert its CNS effects by activation of PPARs and TRPV1
[53, 54]. CBD also inhibits the enzyme FAAH [54, 55]
and leads to increased levels of AEA, OEA, and PEA
(Fig. 5). Therefore, our study proposes a theoretical
pathophysiological mechanism for CBD in ASD and sup-
port the rationale in the ongoing and emerging clinical tri-
als of CBD in ASD (NCT03537950, NCT02956226,
NCT03202303).
Our findings also suggest the use of circulating endo-
cannabinoids as biomarkers for ASD. In recent years, re-
search efforts on neurological disorders are focused on
identifying biomarkers to aid in diagnosis, provide

re-
sponse. This is specifically imperative in ASD due to the
high complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder and
the importance of early diagnosis and early behavioral
intervention to improve outcome. We found that circu-
lating AEA, OEA, and PEA are substantially lower in
children with ASD with a relatively high specificity and
sensitivity. ASD includes a range of neurodevelopmental
disorders that are very heterogeneous both clinically and
etiologically, and it is not realistic to look for a specific
biomarker that perfectly classify ASD and neurotypical
participants. However, circulating AEA, OEA, and PEA

AEA, 2-AG, OEA, and PEA are presented. AEA, PEA, and OEA are synthesized from the membrane’s phospholipids by N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-
specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). PEA and OEA do not bind CB1R, but they can enhance AEA activity at transient receptor potential channels of
vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1). AEA, PEA, and OEA are all degraded by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and hence OEA and PEA can increase AEA levels by
competing with AEA for FAAH (mainly OEA) or by downregulating FAAH expression (mainly PEA). Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component
of the cannabis plant, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and TPRV1 and inhibits FAAH and hence might compensate for

 might be used to identify a biologically homogeneous
subgroup of ASD, predict response to treatments and
adverse reactions to medications, and assist in the devel-
opment of novel drugs that target specific core symp-
toms of ASD. It can also be used as a part of a
multidimensional biomarker panel to predict autism risk
prior to the onset of behavioral abnormalities, initiate
early interventions, and predict the developmental tra-
jectory of children with ASD. We found that AEA levels
were lower in the younger children with ASD in our co-
hort (inverse correlation with age). As circulating endo-
cannabinoids can be assessed in infants, future studies that
evaluate their levels in infants at risk for developing ASD
(e.g., siblings of children with ASD) are recommended. Fu-
ture studies should also assess circulating endocannabi-
noids in the context of other biomarkers to evaluate their
potential in a multidimensional biomarker panel,
Finally, this study has several limitations. The age range
of the cohort and the adaptive level of the ASD partici-
pants were relatively wide. We could not completely con-
trol the effects of ASD comorbidities and the medications’
effect as most of our ASD participants received medica-
tions, and some medications could impact the levels of
circulating endocannabinoids. In addition, we did not as-
sess genetic, electrophysiological, and imaging biomarkers.
Conclusions
We found lower levels of the endocannabinoids AEA,
OEA, and PEA in serum samples of 93 children with
ASD compared with samples of matched neurotypical
control group. These findings are in line with the results
of numerous former studies in animal models of ASD as
well as an initial human study that demonstrated lower
endocannabinoid tone in ASD. Our findings suggest the
use of circulating AEA, OEA, and PEA as stratifying bio-
markers of ASD and future studies should assess the
clinical significance of this stratification. These markers
can also be easily measured longitudinally in humans
and in animal models alike, and future studies should
evaluate their potential to assist in the monitoring of
treatment response. Further studies are needed to deter-
mine whether circulating endocannabinoid levels are
also lower in infants and can assist in pre-symptomatic
diagnosis and if they reflect lower endocannabinoid tone
in the brain, as found in animal models of ASD.
