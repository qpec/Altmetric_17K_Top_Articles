IMPORTANCE Telemetry alarms involving traditional on-site monitoring rarely alter
management and often miss serious events, sometimes resulting in death. Poor patient
selection contributes to a high alarm volume with low clinical yield.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate outcomes associated with an off-site central monitoring unit (CMU)
applying standardized cardiac telemetry indications using electronic order entry.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS All non–intensive care unit (ICU) patients at Cleveland
Clinic and 3 regional hospitals over 13 months between March 4, 2014, and April 4, 2015.
EXPOSURES An off-site CMU applied standardized cardiac telemetry when ordered for
standard indications, such as for known or suspected tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES CMU detection and notification of rhythm/rate alarms
occurring 1 hour or less prior to emergency response team (ERT) activation, direct
CMU-to-ERT notification outcomes, total telemetry census, and cardiopulmonary arrests in
comparison with the previous 13 months.
RESULTS The CMU received electronic telemetry orders for 99 048 patients (main campus,
72 199 [73%]) and provided 410 534 notifications (48% arrhythmia/hemodynamic) among 61
nursing units. ERT activation occurred among 3243 patients, including 979 patients (30%)
with rhythm/rate changes occurring 1 hour or less prior to the ERT activation. The CMU
detected and provided accurate notification for 772 (79%) of those events. In addition, the
CMU provided discretionary direct ERT notification for 105 patients (ventricular tachycardia,
n = 44; pause/asystole, n = 36; polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation,
n = 14; other, n = 11), including advance warning of 27 cardiopulmonary arrest events (26%)
for which return of circulation was achieved in 25 patients (93%). Telemetry standardization
was associated with a mean 15.5% weekly census reduction in the number of non-ICU
monitored patients per week when compared with the prior 13-month period (580 vs 670
patients; mean difference, −90 patients [95% CI, −82 to −99]; P < .001). The number of
cardiopulmonary arrests was 126 in the 13 months preintervention and 122 postintervention.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among non–critically ill patients, use of standardized cardiac
telemetry with an off-site central monitoring unit was associated with detection and
notification of cardiac rhythm and rate changes within 1 hour prior to the majority of ERT
activations, and also with a reduction in the census of monitored patients, without an
increase in cardiopulmonary arrest events.

n studies involving traditional on-site monitoring for
non–intensive care unit patients, more than 90% of
alarms were without immediate clinical relevance and
contributed to clinical desensitization referred to as alarm
fatigue.1-4 In the ALARMED study, on-site cardiac telemetry
alarms altered management in only 0.2% of patients while
generating an average 4.7 alarms per hour.4 Alarm fatigue has
been linked to serious adverse events including death and
was likely underreported.5-9 In a 5-year observational study
of nearly 9000 patients, only 56% of cardiac arrests among
telemetry-monitored patients were detected appropriately.1
True events are missed amid systematic desensitization cre-
ated by false alarms.3 Alarm management failures have gar-
nered national attention, leading to a 2014 National Patient
Safety Goal from The Joint Commission requiring effective
alarm management policies by 2016.10 Low yield and poor
patient selection led the Society of Hospital Medicine to des-
ignate non–intensive care unit cardiac telemetry monitoring
as a practice requiring protocol-driven governance to avoid
overutilization.11
Cardiac telemetry standardization to the 2004 American
HeartAssociationrecommendations12hasbeenassociatedwith
a 70% reduction in telemetry utilization without increasing
rapid response activations, codes, or deaths and a $13 199 per
day cost reduction.13 Dedicating a nurse to continuous rhythm
monitoring was previously associated with improved fidelity
of true rhythm recognition events, including sustained ven-
tricular tachycardia.14,15 However, it is unknown if dedicated
monitoring personnel at an off-site, central monitoring unit
(CMU) can provide effective detection and notification to clini-
cal nursing personnel and also integrate with the dedicated
emergencyresponseteamsinalargemultihospitalsystem.Off-
site monitoring can minimize noise distraction from hospital
activity, centralize staffing, and allow standardized prac-
tices. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical out-
comes associated with an off-site CMU applying standard-
ized cardiac telemetry.
Methods
Central Monitoring Unit
Adedicatedoff-sitefacilityprovidedcontinuouscardiacrhythm
monitoring for the Cleveland Clinic main campus and 3 re-
gional hospitals and was in full clinical deployment prior to te-
lemetry standardization. In this model, 1 monitoring techni-
cian provides continuous cardiac monitoring for up to 48
patients and also provides blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and
respiratory rate notifications on request. Lead technicians pro-
vide on-site oversight and supervision for real-time rhythm in-
terpretation and detection management requiring clinical es-
calationtochargenursingpersonnel.Eachworkstationincludes
the electronic medical record with a monitored patient census
populated by a clinician’
s order, and a telephone system with
regularly updated nursing assignments. Patient monitoring is
regarded as a shared responsibility between the CMU and nurs-
ing, with both sides accountable in the process. Protocol-
driven CMU communication with nursing staff occurs via di-
rect mobile phone or use of a crisis phone for emergencies to
prevent delays. Updated nursing assignments are provided to
the CMU at shift change and disseminated appropriately.
Estimated costs were provided by clinical engineering and
the technology departments based on institutional contracts
negotiated with specific vendors. Central monitoring capital
and operational costs are determined by vendor-specific hard-
ware, routers, software platforms, licensing agreements, se-
curedatalineswithinformationtechnologysupport,andmoni-
toring personnel costs, using a ratio of 5.2 full-time employees
per 48 monitored patients.
CMU notifications to each clinical nursing unit and hos-
pital were categorically tracked as arrhythmia or hemody-
namic notifications, and nonarrhythmia or hemodynamic no-
tifications in a call log database. The latter category includes
calls for disruption of monitoring, including lead failures, and
othermaintenancecallssuchaslowbatteryalarms.CMUpolicy
authorizes direct communication with an emergency re-
sponse team (ERT) at the main campus in parallel with bed-
sidenursingwhenrapidpatientdeteriorationissuspected.The
ERT includes dedicated physician, nursing, and respiratory
therapy personnel. The ERT is authorized to bypass the pri-
mary clinical service to assume temporary emergency man-
agement and achieve compliance with Advanced Cardiac Life
Support protocols.
Telemetry Standardization
Effective March 4, 2014, the Cleveland Clinic health system ap-
plied guideline-based standardized telemetry criteria requir-
ing electronic order entry with selection of an approved indi-
cationoran“other”categorywithfreetextdesignationofneed
falling outside approved indications. These standardized cri-
teriaweredevelopedbyamultidisciplinaryphysicianandnurs-
ing task force using available evidence, the 2004 American
Heart Association guidelines, and perceived health system
needs. The electronic order alerts the patient’
s nurse and trig-
gers enrollment in the CMU census. The nurse acknowledges
the order electronically, applies the electrodes, and then pro-
vides electronic verification of task completion. The as-
signed monitor technician is then prompted to initiate
Key Points
Question What clinical outcomes are associated with off-site
central monitoring applying standardized cardiac telemetry in
non–critically ill patients?
Finding In this study, telemetry standardization was associated
with 15.5% monitored patient census reduction without increasing
cardiopulmonary arrests. Central monitoring detected rate and
rhythm changes in 79% of patients within 1 hour of emergency
response team activation, with discretionary direct notification
associated with 93% return of spontaneous circulation among
coded patients.
Meaning Standardized cardiac telemetry with off-site central
monitoring was associated with detection and notification of
changes prior to emergency response team activation and a
monitored patient census reduction without increasing
cardiopulmonary arrests.

monitoring according to the clinician specified or to de-
faulted parameters. An advisory is automatically generated at
72 hours, by the electronic health record, as a reminder of the
need to reassess ongoing telemetry and reorder if appropri-
ate. Clinicians were asked to select the most representative in-
dication if more than 1 is applied.
Data Collection and Analysis
TheprotocolreceivedClevelandClinicinstitutionalreviewboard
approvalwithparticipantconsentwaiverforexemptstatus.Vari-
ables of interest were collected over the 13-month study pe-
riod (March 4, 2014, to April 4, 2015) timing from the onset of
telemetry standardization. The total weekly monitored telem-
etry census and overall hospital census were tracked for CMU
hospitalsandcomparedwiththeprevious13months.Theprin-
cipal CMU outcome measure of accurate detection and notifi-
cation for discernible rhythm and rate alarms occurring within
1 hour of ERT activation were characterized over the study pe-
riod. In addition, all outcomes resulting from discretionary di-
rect CMU-to-ERT communications were tracked and reported
including subsequent ERT team deployments, cardiopulmo-
nary arrest events, and return of spontaneous circulation sur-
vival outcomes. The total number cardiopulmonary arrest
events, which included monitored and unmonitored patients,
were also reported over the entire study period and for the pre-
vious 13 months.
All ERT activations were adjudicated and coded into the
study database (REDCap version 5.8.2 [2015], Vanderbilt
University) by a lead technician, along with digitally attached
completely scanned rhythm strips inclusive of the event and
1 hour prior (ie, “full disclosure” rhythm strips). The data-
base was regularly audited by an independent TeleHealth
Outcomes Coordinator. The coordinator provided regular
outcomes reporting to the medical director throughout the
study period for quality assurance purposes and attended
monthly cardiopulmonary arrest reviews with representa-
tion from nursing, quality, risk management, and the ERT.
The outcomes coordinator was authorized to investigate all
source documentation and modify the database to adjudi-
cate any discovered errors or discrepancies, with input from
the CMU medical director and nursing leadership.
Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and per-
centages and 2-sided statistical comparisons made by χ2 test-
ing. Continuous variables were expressed as means, and com-
parisons made by analysis of variance or t test reporting mean
difference, with 95% confidence intervals and 2-tailed signifi-
cance testing.
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Addi-
tional exported REDCap data analysis was performed using
SPSS software (SPSS Inc).
Results
Telemetry Utilization
Electronic telemetry orders were placed with indications
selected for 99 048 patients, including 72 199 at the main
campus (73%) and the remaining 26 849 (27%) at the 3
regional hospitals. Utilization frequencies for each indica-
tion category are listed in Table 1. The most common indica-
tion for cardiac telemetry was for known or suspected atrial
or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (n = 16 243 [16%]). The least
common indication involved palliative care in which
arrhythmias were known to cause patient discomfort
(n = 44 [<1%]). There was significant clinician utilization of
indications absent from the 2004 guidelines, including
metabolic derangement (n = 5774 [6%]), respiratory disor-
ders (n = 3159 [3%]), seizure monitoring (n = 2834 [3%]),
evaluation of stroke/transient ischemic attack (n = 2820
[3%]), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (n = 969
[1%]), and drug exposures (n = 577 [<1%]). The free-texted
“other” category was frequently used (n = 15 375 [16%]), of
which the 2 most common responses were grouped as
“hypotensive disease states” that included gastrointestinal
bleeding, sepsis or bacteremia, and pancreatitis (n = 1206
[1%]). All remaining free-texted responses accounted for

Representative capital and operational costs are pro-
vided in the eTable in the Supplement. Estimated capital costs
for CMU implementation range between $2.3 million to
$4.7 million, which include both capital and operational ex-
penditures, and vary according to the monitored census and
negotiated vendor pricing agreements.
Telemetry Standardization
Over 13 months, standardized cardiac telemetry was associ-
ated with a mean 15.5% weekly census reduction in the num-
ber of non-ICU monitored patients per week when compared
with the prior 13-month period (580 vs 670 patients; mean
difference, −90 patients [95% CI, −82 to −99]; P < .001)
(Figure). The reduction in telemetry census occurred imme-
diately (first-week reduction, 666 vs 595 patients [−11%]) and
was sustained over the entire study period. The measured
difference was not attributable to changes in total hospital
occupancy census when compared with the previous 13
months (1004 vs 997 patients; mean difference, +7 patients
[95% CI, −8 to +12]; P = .38). The number of cardiopulmonary
arrests was 126 in the 13 months preintervention and 122
postintervention. The CMU provided 410 534 notifications
among 61 nursing units, including 312 363 (76%) at the main
campus and 98 171 (24%) at the regional hospitals. The distri-
bution of CMU notifications were divided into those for
arrhythmia or hemodynamic reasons vs nonarrhythmia or
hemodynamic reasons (Table 2). The dominant nonarrhyth-
mia or hemodynamic notification accounting for 80% of this
category was for lead failure with total telemetry disruption
(n = 170 604).
CMU Accuracy for Rhythm/Rate Events Occurring
Within 1 Hour or Less of ERT Activation
There were a total of 5656 ERT events during the study
period, of which 3243 (57%) occurred among monitored
patients. Of those 3243 ERT activations, there were 979
patients (30%) with a detectable rhythm or rate change
within 1 hour prior to ERT activation in review of adjudicated
full disclosure data. The CMU detected and provided accu-
rate notification in 772 of these 979 patients (79%). The
remaining 207 patients (21%) went without notification and
were divided into missed events (n = 176/207 [85%]), simul-
taneous alarm events with ERT activation (n = 16/207 [8%]),
and process failures (n = 15/207 [7%]).
A partial explanation was identified in 126 of the 176
missed events (61%), including 39 cases in which ERT activa-
tion was triggered within 5 minutes of the alarm event,
which is the allowable time to review an event and contact
the nurse. There were also 53 cases in which failure to notify
was partially explained because of minor heart rate changes
(10/min to 20/min from baseline), 30 nonsustained atrial
arrhythmia events, and 4 rhythm changes to rate-controlled
atrial fibrillation in patients with prior paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. Although of limited clinical significance, these
explanations are not regarded as desirable.
In the remaining 50 of 176 cases (39%), there was no ex-
planationidentified.Thisincluded4missedeventsforleadfail-
ure with telemetry disruption, 13 bradyarrhythmia events, 20
instances of sinus tachycardia, 9 instances of supraventricu-
lar tachycardia, 2 premature ventricular contractions, and 2

adverseeventsinanyofthese50patients.However,therewere

out CMU notification. This included 1 bradycardic arrest with

successful resuscitation in the simultaneous event group and
3 pulseless electrical activity arrests with successful resusci-
tation in the process failure group. In each case, the CMU was
unable to reach the bedside nurse and was in the process of
escalating the call to a nursing supervisor when the event oc-
curred. Two cardiopulmonary arrest events occurred within
5 minutes of the alarm, including 1 patient with a bradycardic
arrest who was resuscitated and another patient with a pulse-
less electrical activity arrest who died. The remaining code oc-
curred in a patient who experienced minor heart rate alarms
(10/min to 20/min from baseline) in the preceding hour who
later developed a pulseless electrical activity arrest (with re-
suscitation) without a clear association.
CMU Direct-to-ERT Notifications and Outcomes
At the main campus, there were 105 events in which the CMU
exerciseditsdiscretiontoprovidedirectcommunicationtothe
ERT in parallel with the nursing unit for serious events occur-
ring in real time, including monomorphic ventricular tachy-
cardia (n = 44), prolonged pause events or asystole (n = 36),
polymorphicventriculartachycardiaorfibrillation(n = 14),and
other (n = 11). All of those provided notifications resulted in
formal activation and mobilization of the ERT and subse-
quent clinical intervention, including 27 cardiopulmonary ar-
rest events (26%). In those cardiopulmonary arrest cases, re-
turn of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 25 of 27
patients (93%). This includes shock-appropriate rhythms in 12
of 27 patients (41%), with appropriate defibrillation within 3
minutes or less in 10 of 10 patients (100%). Two patients with
shock-appropriate rhythms spontaneously converted during
cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to shock administra-
tion. Two patients died despite use of appropriate Advanced
Cardiac Life Support protocol, 1 patient with pulseless electri-
cal activity arrest and 1 patient with ventricular fibrillation ar-
rest despite timely defibrillation.
Discussion
The use of a centralized monitoring unit with standardized
order entry at the Cleveland Clinic main campus and 3
regional hospitals accurately detected and reported 79% of
adjudicated rhythm and rate changes within 1 hour of an ERT
activation. In addition, the CMU used its judgment to directly
notify the ERT of the impending deterioration of the condi-
tion of 105 patients to elicit urgent clinical intervention,
including 27 patients who subsequently coded and an
impressive 25 of whom survived (93%). Meanwhile, telem-
etry standardization was associated with a 15.5% census
reduction, likely owing to the removal of low-risk patients as
demonstrated by no overall increase in codes (122 vs 126 in
the previous 13 months) and not accounted for by overall
hospital census, which was slightly greater during the study
period. In outcome studies involving nonstandardized telem-
etry applying traditional on-site monitoring, only 56%
patients with cardiac arrest were appropriately detected.1-4
Normal hospital activities occurring at the nursing station
might potentially distract on-site personnel from continuous
vigilant patient monitoring, in addition to the possibility of
vigilance being divided by other on-site duties. Off-site moni-
toring allows dedicated personnel to provide patient moni-
toring removed from the hospital wards with centralized
staffing and standardized practices. A CMU also allows over-
sight and supervision by lead technicians (ie, somebody to
watch those who are watching) to try to ensure continuous
monitoring and mitigate lapses.
In the present analysis, telemetry standardization was
associated with a modest 15.5% census reduction, compared
with the 70% reduction reported by a 2014 telemetry stan-
dardization study by Dressler et al.13 Both studies demon-
strated comparable clinical outcomes ostensibly related to
the removal of low-risk patients unlikely to benefit from
telemetry but likely to generate nuisance alarms, with
resulting alarm fatigue. However, it is unclear why the 2
studies had a large discordance in census reduction. One
possibility is that the study by Dressler et al did not include
indications absent from the 2004 guidelines and also did not
include an “other” category. It is also possible that our insti-
tution exhibited less telemetry overutilization at baseline.
Nonetheless, patient selection is only one aspect of ineffi-
cient telemetry utilization. More than half of the 410 534
calls made by the CMU were for nonarrhythmia or hemody-
namic reasons, including 80% for connectivity failures. This
suggests further efforts are needed to mitigate alarm fatigue.
Future studies can use our descriptive data as a benchmark,
given limited scientific data to date, and should evaluate
new technologies with better skin adherence, such as patch-
based monitors.
Despite a large call volume, CMU technicians were able
to apply good discretionary judgment in providing direct
ERT notification. These data demonstrate that integrating a
CMU and an ERT team is feasible, which is particularly
important for hospital systems with dedicated emergency
response teams in which operational and capital costs

permit scalability. Once the required resources are in
place, the CMU can extend its operability to hospitals that
are widely geographically separated while interfacing
directly with site-specific ERTs. Future work and technologi-
cal innovation are needed to further improve efficiency and
reduce costs.
Limitations of the present analysis include lack of a ran-
domized or crossover design model. There were 2 simultane-
ous changes as this program was implemented. These
included a centralized monitoring system and education on
the use of referrals. These findings come from a single large
major tertiary medical system, and generalization to other
institutions will require further evaluation. The reported data
are largely descriptive and dependent on historical and
literature-based comparisons. However, these findings may
inform future studies.
Conclusions
Among non–critically ill patients, use of standardized cardiac
telemetry with an off-site central monitoring unit was associ-
atedwithdetectionandnotificationofcardiacrhythmandrate
changes within 1 hour prior to the majority of ERT activa-
tions, and also with a reduction in the census of monitored pa-
tients, without an increase in cardiopulmonary arrest events.
