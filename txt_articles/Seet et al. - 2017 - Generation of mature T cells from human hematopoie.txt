Abstract
Studies of human T cell development require robust model systems that recapitulate the full span 
of thymopoiesis, from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) through to mature T cells. 
Existing in vitro models induce T cell commitment from human HSPCs; however, differentiation 
into mature CD3+TCRab+ single positive (SP) CD8+ or CD4+ cells is limited. We describe here a 
serum-free, artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system that supports highly efficient and 
reproducible in vitro differentiation and positive selection of conventional human T cells from all 
sources of HSPCs. ATO-derived T cells exhibited mature naïve phenotypes, a diverse TCR

 repertoire, and TCR-dependent function. ATOs initiated with TCR-engineered HSPCs produced T 
cells with antigen specific cytotoxicity and near complete lack of endogenous TCR Vβ expression, 
consistent with allelic exclusion of Vβ loci. ATOs provide a robust tool for studying human T cell 
development and stem cell based approaches to engineered T cell therapies.
Due to the spatiotemporal complexity of T cell development in the thymus, in vitro models 
of T cell differentiation have thus far been unable to fully recapitulate human T cell 
development. A major advance was the discovery that murine stromal cell lines expressing a 
Notch ligand could support in vitro T cell differentiation from murine or human HSPCs, as 
in the classic OP9-DL1 co-culture system1, 2, 3. In this and similar monolayer systems, 
human cord blood (CB) HSPCs undergo T lineage commitment and rapid early T cell 
differentiation to CD7+ pro-T cells, followed by CD4 “immature single positive” (CD4ISP) 
precursors around day 20, and CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) precursors around day 303. 
Despite this, positive selection of T cell precursors with productively rearranged TCRs is 
impaired in OP9-DL1 co-culture, and consequently few CD3+CD8+ or CD4+ single 
positive (SP) T cells develop2, 3, 4, 5. By Day 60–70 on OP9-DL1, mature CD8SP represent 
at most 2–4% of cultured cells5. Improved maturation has been reported using CD34+ 
HSPC isolated from the human postnatal thymus6 a population largely composed of lineage 
committed pro-T cells7. However, T cell maturation on OP9-DL1 is particularly inefficient 
using mobilized peripheral blood and bone marrow HSPCs, the latter giving approximately 
10% of the DP and CD3+TCRαβ+ cell yields seen with CB cultures8.
We and others have shown that three-dimensional (3D) organoid systems using 
murine9, 10, 11 or human12 primary thymic stroma supports improved positive selection and 
maturation of human T cells in vitro. However, these systems are difficult to use given their 
dependence on primary thymic tissue, and high experimental variability. We therefore 
sought to develop a system using off-the-shelf, serum-free components able to support 
efficient and reproducible differentiation and positive selection of human T cells from 
HSPCs.
We report here the development of an artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system based on a 
DLL1-transduced stromal cell line and serum-free, off-the-shelf components that supported 
robust differentiation, positive selection, and maturation of human CD3+TCRαβ+CD8SP 
and CD4SP T cells from CB, bone marrow, and peripheral blood CD34+ HSPCs. 
Differentiation was efficient whether initiated with CD34+CD3- HSPCs, HSC, or lymphoid 
progenitors. T cell differentiation in ATOs followed a phenotypic progression that closely 
recapitulated human thymopoiesis, and was associated with long-term maintenance of 
CD34+ T cell progenitors.
Both CD3+CD8SP and CD3+CD4SP mature T cells that developed in ATOs exhibited an 
antigen naïve phenotype, diverse TCR repertoire, and cytokine production and proliferation 
in response to antigenic stimuli. ATOs also supported highly efficient differentiation of 
TCR-engineered, antigen-specific T cells from HSPCs transduced with MHC Class I-
restricted TCRs specific for the tumor-associated antigens NY-ESO-1 and MART-1. ATO-
derived engineered T cells exhibited a naïve phenotype and in vitro and in vivo antigen-
specific cytotoxicity. Moreover, these cells lacked endogenous TCR Vβ expression,

 consistent with induction of allelic exclusion by the transduced TCR during early T cell 
differentiation, and suggesting a new approach to generating potentially non-alloreactive 
engineered T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. ATOs thus are a standardized and highly 
efficient in vitro model of human T cell development that is readily amenable to genetic 
manipulation and may permit new approaches to the study of human T cell development.
Results
Development of an optimized artificial thymic organoid system for in vitro human T cell 
differentiation
Our goal was to develop a robust system that supports in vitro differentiation and positive 
selection of human T cells from HSPCs from multiple sources. Based on studies using 
FTOCs and reaggregated organoids, we hypothesized that 3D structure plays a critical role 
in T cell positive selection. To avoid the use of primary thymic tissue, we tested DLL1-
transduced stromal cell lines for their ability to support human T cell development in 3D 
organoid cultures. As we and others have observed that the efficiency of T cell 
differentiation in the OP9-DL1 system is highly variable between different lots of fetal calf 
serum13, we furthermore sought to identify serum-free conditions capable of supporting T 
cell differentiation in organoid cultures. To form organoids, we used a simple compaction 
reaggregation technique9, 12, 14, by which stromal cells are aggregated with HSPCs by 
centrifugation and deployed on a cell culture insert at the air-fluid interface (Fig. 1a). Using 
this method, we identified the MS5 murine bone marrow stromal cell line15 transduced with 
human DLL1 (MS5-hDLL1, hereafter) as strongly supportive of human T cell 
differentiation and positive selection (measured by the output of mature CD3+TCRαβ
+CD8SP cells) from T cell-depleted CD34+ cord blood (CB) HSPCs. We also identified 
RPMI 1640 supplemented with B27, a multi-component additive used in neuronal and 
embryonic stem cell cultures16, and FLT3L, IL-7, and ascorbic acid17, 18 (“RB27”, 
hereafter) as a serum-free medium that supported robust human T cell differentiation in 
MS5-hDLL1 organoid cultures without lot-to-lot variation.
This optimized artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system induced rapid and efficient T 
lineage commitment from CB CD34+CD3- HSPCs, as shown by a predominance of 
CD5+CD7+ T-lineage cells and the appearance of CD4+CD3- immature single positive 
(CD4ISP) and CD4+CD8+ (DP) T cell precursors by week 2 (Fig. 1b). More mature 
CD3+TCRαβ+ cells emerged as early as week 4 and increased over time, accounting for 
~30% of cells at week 6 (Fig. 1b). Long-term maintenance of CD34+ T cell progenitors was 
also seen in ATOs, and recapitulated the three phenotypic stages of thymic T cell 
progenitors: multipotent CD34+CD7-CD1a- early thymic progenitors (ETP), and 
developmentally downstream CD34+CD7+CD1a- and CD34+CD7+CD1a+ pro-T cells (Fig. 
1c)7, 19. Pro-T1 and pro-T2 progenitor phenotypes, based on an alternative classification 
scheme using CD5 and CD720, were also readily identified within ATO CD34+ cells (Fig. 
1c). Consistent with a T lineage-biased ATO microenvironment, CD19+ B cell frequency 
was low and decreased over time, and NK and myeloid frequencies remained low 
throughout (Fig. 1b, d). CD3+TCRαβ+ T cell frequency in ATOs was highly consistent 
across experiments, and included CD8SP and, to a lesser extent, CD4SP T cells, consistent

 with positive selection in ATOs (Fig. 1d). A smaller population of CD3+TCRγδ+ T cells 
was also consistently seen (Fig. 1d). Histological sections of ATOs demonstrated the 
formation of dense tissue architecture with abundant lymphoid cells (Supplementary Fig. 1), 
clusters of which expressed CD3 (Fig. 1e).
Each ATO typically generated ~2×106 total cells at 6 weeks (Fig. 1f); however, cell yield per 
HSPC was inversely related to the number of HSPCs seeded and the ratio of HSPCs to 
stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Frequencies of precursor and mature T cells in ATOs 
was similar across initial HSPC numbers and ratios (Supplemental Fig. 2b), with the 
exception of ATOs generated with large numbers of stromal cells (6×105 per ATO), which 
showed impaired T cell maturation. Thus, smaller ATOs (typically 7500 HSPCs and 1.5×105 
stromal cells at a 1:20 ratio) were used for further experiments, and showed high 
reproducibility of cell output and T cell differentiation across technical replicates (n=11) and 
was independent of B27 lot (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). Of translational relevance, efficient 
T cell differentiation and cell output was also seen in ATOs cultured with xeno-free B27 
(Supplementary Fig. 3e, f) or using irradiated MS5-hDLL1 stromal cells (Supplementary 
Fig. 3g–j). Recovery of hematopoietic cells generated in ATOs after simple mechanical 
disruption and filtration resulted in >99% CD45+ hematopoietic cells (Supplementary Fig. 
3k).
When compared directly to the OP9-DL1 monolayer culture system, ATOs revealed a 
similar efficiency of T lineage commitment (%CD7+CD5+ cells) but markedly superior 
generation of both DP and CD3+TCRαβ+ T cells at 4 and 6 weeks (Fig. 2a–d and 
Supplementary Fig. 4). Improved positive selection was particularly evident in the 
prevalence of mature CD3+TCRαβ+CD8SP T cells in ATOs but not OP9-DL1 monolayers 
(Fig. 2b,c,d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Cross-over experiments testing the impact of culture 
variables revealed that optimal positive selection and T cell maturation required all three 
components of the ATO system: 3D structure, MS5-hDLL1 stromal cells, and RB27 
medium, as neither monolayer cultures using ATO components, nor OP9-DL1 cells in 3D 
organoids supported T cell development (Supplementary Fig. 5). The parental MS5 cell line 
lacking DLL1 expression did not support T cell development in either monolayer or 3D 
cultures, consistent with a requirement for Notch signaling (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Recapitulation of thymopoiesis and naïve T cell development in ATOs
T cell differentiation in ATOs was next compared to that in the postnatal human thymus. 
Week 12 CB ATOs showed a similar frequency of CD34+ pro-T cells and T-lineage 
committed (CD5+CD7+) cells to the thymus (Fig. 3a). As in the thymus, most CD3+ T cells 
in ATOs were TCRαβ+ (Fig. 3a). Mature CD3+TCRαβ+ CD8SP and CD4SP T cells 
increased in frequency in ATOs between weeks 6–12 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 6a), 
and exhibited a reversed CD4:CD8 ratio compared to the thymus.
As in the thymus, ATO-derived CD3+TCRαβ+CD8SP and CD3+TCRαβ+CD4SP T cells 
transited from a DP-like “immature naïve” (CD45RA-CD45RO+CD27+CCR7-CD1Ahi) to a 
“mature naïve” (CD45RA+CD45RO-CD27+CCR7+CD1alo) phenotype21, 22 (Fig. 3c and 
Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). Both immature and mature naïve T cell subsets co-expressed 
CD62L and CD28, with subset co-expression of CD127 and CD31, the latter associated with

 recent thymic emigrant T cells in the blood23 (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c). The activation 
marker CD25 was not expressed on ATO-derived CD8SP T cells, but was observed on a 
subset of CD4SP T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c). Taken together, these data show 
remarkable fidelity of T cell differentiation in ATOs compared to the human thymus, 
culminating in the emergence of naïve T cells phenotypically similar to those in the thymus 
and blood24, 25.
Given the absence of thymic epithelial cells and the late emergence and relatively low 
frequencies of mature CD4SP T cells, we postulated that MHC class II mediated positive 
selection may rely on the development of rare dendritic cells in ATOs. Indeed, HLA-DR+ 
cells were present in ATOs at low frequencies, and included monocytes, B cells, and 
plasmacytoid, CLEC9A+, and CD1c+ dendritic cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d), all of which 
were also present in the thymus, in agreement with previous reports26, 27 (Supplementary 
Fig. 6e).
T cell differentiation from multiple HSPC sources and subsets
In addition to CB, efficient T cell differentiation in ATOs was seen from clinically relevant 
HSPC sources, i.e. adult bone marrow (BM), G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood (MPB), and 
non-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) (Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Kinetics of T 
cell differentiation varied between sources (Fig. 4c), with thymic CD34+ cells predictably 
showing the fastest differentiation; however, T cell output was similar across all sources 
(Fig. 4d). Enriched hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fractions (lin-CD34+CD38-)28 from CB, 
BM, or MPB also demonstrated efficient T cell differentiation in ATOs (Fig. 4e,f and 
Supplementary Fig. 7c,d).
ATOs also supported T cell differentiation from highly purified lymphoid progenitors 
isolated from adult BM (Fig. 4g,h). Lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP)29 
and CD24- common lymphoid progenitors30 (CLP) generated T cells to a greater extent than 
unfractionated CD34+lin- HSPCs (Fig. 4g, and Supplementary Fig. 7e,f). In contrast, 
CD24+ CLPs, which possess primarily B and NK cell potential30, 31 resulted in poor T cell 
output in ATOs (Fig. 4g,h and Supplementary Fig. 7e). Thus ATOs can serve as a tool for 
evaluating T lineage potential in human stem and progenitor cell populations.
TCR diversity and function of ATO-derived T cells
Similar to the thymus, RAG1 and RAG2 were expressed at the DP stage in ATOs, consistent 
with TCR gene rearrangement (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Flow cytometric analysis of TCR 
Vβ frequencies in ATO-derived CD3+TCRαβ+CD8SP (Fig. 5a) and CD3+TCRαβ+CD4SP 
(Supplementary Fig. 8b) T cells revealed strikingly similar diversities to those of 
corresponding naïve T cells from human thymi. Physiological TCR diversity was confirmed 
by deep sequencing of TCR Vα and Vβ CDR3 regions in ATO-derived CD3+TCRαβ
+CD8SP T cells compared with both thymic and PB naïve CD8SP T cells (Fig. 5b,c). 
Importantly, skewed Vα or Vβ usage was not observed in ATO-derived T cells, arguing 
against the predominance of unconventional T cell lineages or clonally expanded T cells.
CD8SP T cells isolated from ATOs demonstrated polyfunctional production of IFNγ, TNFα 
and IL-2 in response to PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 5d), and exhibited upregulation of CD25 and

 4-1BB and proliferated in response to anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-2 (Fig. 5e,f). CD4SP cells 
freshly isolated from ATOs produced IFNγ and IL-2 in response to PMA/ionomycin, and 
proliferated in response to anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-2 (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d,e).
In vitro generation of naïve TCR-engineered T cells in ATOs
We next explored if ATOs can be used for the in vitro generation of naïve TCR-engineered T 
cells. CB CD34+CD3- HSPCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding codon 
optimized α and β chains of a HLA-A*02:01-restricted TCR specific for the NY-
ESO-1157-165 peptide32. At 7 weeks, TCR-transduced ATOs showed a similar frequency of 
CD7+CD5+ T-lineage cells as mock-transduced controls, but markedly increased 
CD3+TCRαβ+ T cells, the majority of which expressed the transduced TCR detected by 
tetramer or an antibody against the transduced Vβ13.1 chain (Fig. 6a). The frequency of 
tetramer+CD3+TCRαβ+CD8SP T cells was similar to that of mock-transduced ATOs, 
however TCR transduction resulted in accelerated maturation from an immature (CD45RA-
CD45RO+CD27-CCR7-CD1ahi) to a mature (CD45RA+CD45RO-CD27+CCR7+CD1alo) 
naïve T cell phenotype (Fig. 6a). As antigen-specific T cells with an unconventional CD8αα 
phenotype have been reported in the OP9-DL1 system33, we confirmed that tetramer+ T 
cells from ATOs displayed a conventional CD8αβ phenotype and lacked expression of 
CD16 or CD56, markers associated with NK cells and innate-like T cells (Fig. 6b).
TCR transduction also significantly enhanced cell yield from ATOs (average ~500 cells per 
HSPC) (Fig. 6c), the majority of which were tetramer+CD3+CD8SP T cells. Thus, by 7 
weeks a single ATO initiated with 7,500 TCR-transduced HSPCs generated on average 
~4×106 cells, of which approximately 15% (6×105) were mature naïve tetramer
+CD3+CD8SPCD45RA+CD45RO- antigen specific T cells (Fig. 6a,c).
ATO-derived antigen specific CD8SP T cells exhibited polyfunctional cytokine production 
(IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2), degranulation as assessed by CD107a membrane mobilization, 
(Fig. 6d) and proliferation (Fig. 6e) in response to artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) 
expressing CD80 and a cognate HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1 single chain trimer; but not 
irrelevant HLA-A*02:01/MART-1 aAPCs or parental K562 cells. Furthermore, these T cells 
could be expanded with anti-CD3/CD28 beads and IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15 (Fig. 6f). A previous 
report of TCR-engineered T cells derived using the OP9-DL1 system reported loss of CD8β 
expression following repeated in vitro stimulation33, and while a subpopulation of ATO-
derived tetramer+CD8SP T cells was CD8β-following re-stimulation with anti-CD3/28 
beads, the majority of cells maintained a conventional CD8αβ phenotype (Supplementary 
Fig. 9a).
Flow cytometric analysis of Vβ diversity in ATO-derived TCR-engineered T cells revealed 
>98% of tetramer+CD3+CD8SP T cells expressed only the transduced Vβ13.1 segment 
(Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 9b), suggesting that allelic exclusion of both endogenous 
Vβ loci occurred during differentiation of TCR-engineered T cells in ATOs.
To test if these findings could be extended beyond the NY-ESO-1 TCR, we generated ATOs 
using CB HSPCs transduced with an HLA-A*02:01-restricted TCR specific for MART-134. 
Tetramer+CD3+CD8SP cells isolated from these ATOs demonstrated a naïve T cell

 phenotype (Supplemental Fig. 9c) and upregulated IFNγ and mobilized CD107a in response 
to MART-1 but not NY-ESO-1 aAPCs (Supplemental Fig. 9d).
We next tested antigen-specific cytotoxicity of ATO-derived TCR-engineered T cells. 
Purified NY-ESO-1-specific CD8SP T cells isolated from TCR-transduced ATOs and 
activated for 36 hours potently induced apoptosis in cell lines expressing cognate pMHC 
(either K562 cells transduced with an HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1 SCT; or the HLA-
A*02:01+ U266 multiple myeloma cell line which endogenously expresses NY-ESO-1), but 
showed little activity against parental K562 cells or K562 cells expressing an irrelevant 
HLA-A*02:01/MART-1 SCT (Fig. 6h and Supplementary Fig. 9e). Consistent with their 
naïve state, prior activation of ATO-derived antigen-specific T cells was required for 
cytotoxicity. Loss of antigen specificity was not observed following prolonged (14 days) in 
vitro expansion, indicating retention of a conventional T cell phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 
9f); furthermore, cytotoxicity was similar to that of TCR-transduced PB CD8+ T cells 
expanded for the same period (Supplementary Fig. 9f). Consistent with these results, ATO-
derived TCR-engineered T cells were able to significantly control disease progression in 
NSG mice subcutaneously engrafted with antigen-expressing K562 tumors (Fig. 6i).
Discussion
We present here an in vitro system that efficiently initiates and sustains the normal stages of 
T cell commitment and differentiation from human HSPCs, culminating in the production of 
mature, naïve CD3+TCRαβ+CD8SP and CD3+TCRαβ+CD4SP T cells closely resembling 
naïve T cells from the thymus and blood.
Compared to existing methods of in vitro T cell differentiation, ATOs supported 
unprecedented levels of positive selection of CD3+TCRαβ+ precursors into mature CD8SP 
and CD4SP T cell pools—a process impaired in monolayer systems2, 3, 4, 5. Enhanced 
positive selection in ATOs was strictly dependent on both 3D structure and the stromal cell 
line used, as monolayer cultures set up with ATO components resulted in inefficient T cell 
maturation, as did 3D organoid cultures using OP9-DL1 cells. We have however observed 
mature T cell development in ATOs using DLL1-transduced immortalized human BM 
stromal cells, and while efficiency is lower than for MS5-hDLL1, this indicates that neither 
species-specific nor MS5-specific factors underlie T cell positive selection in ATOs. We also 
predict that other Notch ligands, such as DLL4, should be effective in driving T cell 
development in ATOs.
A specific role for 3D structure in T cell positive selection is consistent with the reported 
ability of FTOCs and reaggregated primary thymic stromal organoids to permit T cell 
maturation, albeit at low efficiencies10, 11, 12. 3D interactions may support positive selection 
by increasing the valence and/or duration of contact between T cell precursors and selective 
ligands (such as pMHC); facilitating crosstalk between stromal and hematopoietic cells; or 
exerting developmental signals on T cell precursors through mechanical forces and/or 
metabolic gradients not otherwise possible in 2D. The formation of thymic-like spatial 
niches segregating developing T cells from stromal signals and/or Notch ligands during 
development may be another possible mechanism at play in ATOs. In the absence of thymic

 epithelial cells in ATOs, we hypothesize that selective MHC I ligands for CD8SP positive 
selection are ubiquitously presented by hematopoietic cells within the ATOs, as has been 
suggested in the OP9-DL1 system6; but that CD4SP positive selection occurs via MHC class 
II presentation by dendritic cells that develop within ATOs, with their rarity possibly 
underlying the bias toward CD8+ T cell development in this system. The nature of these and 
other specific mechanisms of T cell selection can now be readily investigated using the ATO 
system in conjunction with model TCR/antigen systems.
Another major advance of the ATO system over existing methods is the efficient generation 
of mature T cells from clinically relevant adult HSPC sources such as bone marrow, and 
resting or G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood 2, 3, 4, 5. While several studies have shown 
improved T cell maturation on OP9-DL1 using thymic CD34+ cells, these primarily consist 
of committed pro-T cells7 and have little therapeutic utility.
ATOs can be used as a novel tool to generate naïve, antigen specific engineered T cells from 
human HSPCs. Differentiation of TCR-engineered T cells from HPSCs has been reported 
using the OP9-DL1 system however, as with non-transduced HSPCs, positive selection and 
generation of mature CD3+ T cells was impaired (typically representing only 0–2% of 
cultures), with the highest efficiencies achieved using thymic CD34+ cells33, 35, 36. In 
comparison, ATOs strongly supported the differentiation and positive selection of mature 
CD3+ TCR-engineered T cells from CB HSPCs, with similar results observed using MPB 
HSPCs (not shown). In contrast to TCR-transduced PB T cells, that require activation and 
prolonged expansion, in vitro generation of naïve antigen specific T cells may offer distinct 
therapeutic advantages for adoptive cell therapy based on studies correlating earlier T cell 
differentiation state with in vivo efficacy24, 37, 38. Non-transduced and TCR-transduced 
ATOs showed accumulation of naive CD3+CD8SP T cells over time, with concomitant 
decrease in DPs, consistent with the absence of T cell egress. Despite this, mature T cells in 
ATOs retained a naïve phenotype, absence of activation markers, and required activation/
priming for effective cytotoxicity. TCR transduction of HSPCs also resulted in near-
complete allelic exclusion of endogenous Vβ TCR loci, consistent with findings from in 
vivo studies of TCR-transduced murine and human HSPCs34, 39, 40. The expression of 
potentially alloreactive endogenous TCRs on engineered PB T cells is a major barrier to the 
development of off-the-shelf adoptive T cell therapies, and current approaches to mitigate 
donor T cell alloreactivity, such as gene editing41, 42, 43 or the use of virus-specific T cells44, 
require extensive cell manipulation, potentially compromising function. We illustrate here 
that ATOs can be used to exploit developmental allelic exclusion of endogenous TCR 
expression as a novel strategy for generating potentially non-alloreactive antigen specific T 
cells for immunotherapy. ATOs are thus a new tool for the study and development of stem 
cell based engineered T cell therapies, given the ease of genetically manipulating both 
hematopoietic and stromal compartments, and the ability to produce naïve, unperturbed 
antigen specific T cells.
Finally, the ATO system offers technical simplicity, reproducibility, and potential scalability. 
The use of serum-free medium avoids the marked variability observed in monolayer 
systems13, and the ability to maintain ATOs intact for the duration of culture (up to 20 
weeks) with simple media changes reduces labor through avoiding the frequent transfer of

ATO system permits straightforward adoption of the method in laboratories interested in 
studying human T cell development and engineered T cell therapies.

from AllCells Inc. (Alameda, CA). G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood was obtained from 
consenting healthy adult donors (ages 44–60) undergoing apheresis for allogeneic stem cell 
transplant donation at UCLA. Non-mobilized peripheral blood was obtained from healthy 
adult donors through the UCLA CFAR Virology Core. All tissue samples were obtained 
under UCLA IRB-approved protocols or exemptions. All samples were enriched for 
mononuclear cells by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) gradient 
centrifugation followed by positive selection of CD34+ cells by magnetic cell sorting 
(MACS) using the CD34 MicroBead Kit UltraPure (Miltenyi, Auburn CA). CD34+ cell 
enriched fractions were cryopreserved after MACS, unless otherwise noted. Prior to use, 
cells were thawed and residual T cells depleted by FACS by sorting CD34+CD3- cells, 
which were immediately seeded into ATOs or transduced as described below. In some 
experiments, HSCs were enriched by FACS for Lin-CD34+CD38- cells prior to seeding in 
ATOs. HSPCs used in TCR transduction experiments were from HLA-A*02:01+ CB units. 
High-resolution HLA-A2 typing was performed by the UCLA Immunogenetics Center using 
sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) beads.
Isolation of human bone marrow progenitor subsets
CD34+ HSPCs were enriched from fresh BM aspirates, as above, and immediately sorted by 
FACS for stem/progenitor populations based on positive expression of CD45 and absent 
expression of lineage markers (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD56, and CD235a; “Lin-“) combined 
with the following markers: total HSPCs (CD34+), HSC (CD34+CD38-CD45RA-)28, 45, 
LMPP (CD34+CD38+CD45RA+CD10-CD62Lhi)29, CD24- CLP (CD34+CD38+CD45RA
+CD10+CD24-)30, and CD24+ CLP (CD34+CD38+CD45RA+CD10 CD24+)30, 31.
Isolation of human thymocytes
Postnatal human thymi were obtained under IRB exemption as discarded waste from 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). Thymic 
fragments were finely dissected in RPMI and disrupted by pipetting to release thymocytes 
into suspension, followed by passage through a 70 μm nylon strainer. Cells were analyzed 
fresh on the same or following day. Flow cytometry analysis of thymic and ATO-derived T 
cell progenitors used the following surface phenotypes: Early thymic progenitor (ETP; 
CD34+CD7-CD1a-), CD1a- pro-T (CD34+CD7+CD1a-), and CD1a+ pro-T

 (CD34+CD7+CD1a+)7; or CD5- pro-T (pro-T1; CD34+CD7+CD5-) and CD5+ pro-T (pro-
T2; CD34+CD7+CD5+)20. Thymic and ATO-derived T cells and precursors were defined as 
CD14-CD56- in combination with the following phenotypes: total T lineage cells 
(CD7+CD5+), double negative (DN; CD4-CD8-), CD4 immature single positive (CD4ISP; 
CD5+CD4+CD3-), double positive (DP; CD4+CD8+), CD8SP (CD3+TCRαβ
+CD8+CD4-), CD4SP (CD3+TCRαβ+CD8-CD4+), immature naïve (CD45RA-CD45RO+ 
that were CD8SP or CD4SP), mature naïve (CD45RA+CD45RO- that were CD8SP or 
CD4SP). Immature and mature naïve phenotypes were confirmed by co-staining for CD1a, 
CD27, CD28, and CCR7.
Isolation of primary human T cells
Thymic T cells were isolated from thymocytes preparations as described above, and 
peripheral blood and cord blood CD8+ T cells were isolated from mononuclear cell fractions 
as described above. CD8+ T cell isolation from all sources was by magnetic bead 
enrichment for CD8SP T cells using the CD8+ T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi). In some 
experiments, thymic T cells were further purified by FACS to deplete CD4ISP or DP 
precursors, and PB T cells to isolate naïve T cells (CD45RO-CCR7+).
Cell lines
The MS5 murine stromal cell line15 was obtained as a gift. To generate MS5-hDLL1, MS5 
cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding human DLL1 and eGFP. The highest 
5% GFP-expressing cells were sorted by FACS and passaged in DMEM/10% FCS. Stable 
expression was confirmed by flow cytometry for GFP expression after several weeks of 
culture, and DLL1 expression confirmed by qRT-PCR and DNA sequencing. The OP9-DL1 
cell line1 (expressing murine Dll1) was a gift from Dr. Juan Carlos Zúñiga-Pflücker 
(University of Toronto) and was passaged in MEMα (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand 
Island, NY)/20% FBS in 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks. The K562 cell line was obtained from 
ATCC and maintained in RPMI/10% FCS. K562 aAPCs were generated by co-transduction 
of K562 cells with lentiviral vectors encoding full-length human CD80 and HLA-
A*02:01/B2M/NY-ESO-1157-165 or MART-126-35 single chain trimers (SCTs; gifts from Dr. 
David Baltimore, Caltech). K562 target cells were created by transduction with either SCT 
without CD80. Luciferase K562 target cells were created by sequential transduction of K562 
cells with a firefly luciferase lentiviral vector (gift from Dr. Donald Kohn, UCLA) followed 
by either SCT vector. K562 transductants were FACS sorted prior to use. The U266 multiple 
myeloma cell line was a gift from Dr. John Chute (UCLA) and maintained in RPMI/10% 
FCS.
Artificial Thymic Organoid (ATO) cultures
MS5-hDLL1 (or MS5 or OP9-DL1, as noted) cells were harvested by trypsinization and 
resuspended in serum free ATO culture medium (“RB27”) composed of RPMI 1640 
(Corning, Manassas, VA), 4% B27 supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, 
NY), 30 μM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO) reconstituted in PBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products, West 
Sacramento, CA), 1% Glutamax (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY), 5 ng/ml 
rhFLT3L and 5 ng/ml rhIL-7 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). RB27 was made fresh weekly. 4%

 XenoFree B27 was substituted for B27 in the indicated experiments. Depending on the 
experiment, 1.5–6×105 MS5-hDLL1 cells were combined with 3×102–1×105 purified 
CD34+CD3- cells (or other HSPC populations, as indicated) per ATO in 1.5 ml Eppendorf 
tubes and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. at 4°C in a swinging bucket centrifuge. 
Supernatants were carefully removed and the cell pellet was resuspended by brief vortexing. 
For each ATO, a 0.4 μm Millicell transwell insert (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA; Cat. 
PICM0RG50) was placed in a 6-well plate containing 1 ml RB27 per well. To plate ATOs, 
inserts were taken out and rested on the edge of plate to drain excess medium. The cell 
slurry was adjusted to 5 μl per ATO, drawn up in with a 20 μl pipet tip and plated by forming 
a drop at the end of the pipet tip which was gently deposited onto the cell insert. The cell 
insert was placed back in the well containing 1 mL RB27. Medium was changed completely 
every 3–4 days by aspiration from around the cell insert followed by replacement with 1 ml 
with fresh RB27/cytokines. ATOs were cultured in this fashion for up to 20 weeks. At the 
indicated times, ATO cells were harvested by adding FACS buffer (PBS/0.5% bovine serum 
album/2mM EDTA) to each well and briefly disaggregating the ATO by pipetting with a 1 
ml “P1000” pipet, followed by passage through a 50 μm nylon strainer. In some 
experiments, single cell suspensions of MS5-hDLL1 cells were γ-irradiated at the indicated 
doses prior to use in ATOs.
T cell monolayer co-cultures
OP9-DL1 monolayer cultures were set up as previously described1, 3, 13. Briefly, OP9-DL1 
cells were seeded into 0.1% gelatin-coated 12 well plates 1–2 days prior to use to achieve 
70–80% confluence. Medium was aspirated from monolayers and 1.5×104 FACS purified 
CD34+CD3- HSPCs were plated on stromal monolayers in 2 ml of medium composed of 
MEMα, 20% FBS, 30 μM L-Ascorbic acid, 5 ng/ml rhFLT3L, and 5 ng/ml rhIL-7. In some 
experiments, MS5 or MS5-hDLL1 was substituted for OP9-DL1, and RB27 was substituted 
as the culture medium. Cells were transferred to new stromal cell monolayers every 4–5 
days by harvesting cells, filtering through a 50 μm nylon strainer, and replating in fresh 
medium. When confluent, cells were split into multiple wells containing fresh stromal 
layers.
Lentiviral vectors and transduction
The full-length coding sequence of human DLL1 was cloned by RT-PCR from a human 
universal reference RNA set (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) into the third 
generation lentiviral vector pCCL-c-MNDU3-X-IRES-eGFP34 (gift from Dr. Donald Kohn, 
UCLA). Human CD80 was similarly cloned into pCCL-c-MNDU3. The third generation 
lentiviral vector encoding the codon optimized α and β (Vb13.1) chains of a TCR specific 
for HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1157-165 (derived from the 1G4 TCR clone46) is previously 
described32, and was a gift from Dr. Antoni Ribas (UCLA). The codon-optimized HLA-
A*02:01/MART-126-35 specific TCR (derived from the F5 TCR clone47) was a gift from Dr. 
Donald Kohn (UCLA). Coding sequences for HLA-A*02:01/B2M/ NY-ESO-1157-165 or 
HLA-A*02:01/B2M/ MART-126-35 single chain trimers were a gift from Dr. David 
Baltimore (Caltech), and were sub-cloned into the pCCL-c-MNDU3-X-IRES-mStrawberry 
lentiviral vector. Packaging and concentration of lentivirus particles was performed as 
previously described32. Briefly, 293T cells (ATCC) were co-transfected with a lentiviral

 vector plasmid, pCMV-ΔR8.9, and pCAGGS-VSVG using TransIT 293T (Mirus Bio, 
Madison, WI) for 17 hours followed by treatment with 20 mM sodium butyrate for 8 hours, 
followed by generation of cell supernatants in serum-free UltraCulture for 48 hours. 
Supernatants were concentrated by tangential flow filtration using Amicon Ultra-15 100K 
filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 4000 xg for 40 minutes at 4°C and stored as 
aliquots at −80C. For HSPC transduction, 1×105–1×106 FACS-sorted CD34+CD3- HSPCs 
were plated in 6-well non-treated plates coated with 20 μg/ml Retronectin (Clontech, 
Mountain View, CA) in 1 ml X-VIVO-15 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 50 
ng/ml of recombinant human SCF, FLT3L, and TPO, and 10 ng/ml IL-3 (Peprotech, Rocky 
Hill, NJ) for 12–18h, after which concentrated lentiviral supernatant was to a final 
concentration of 1–2×107 TU/ml. Mock-transduced cells were cultured in identical 
conditions without addition of vector. Cells were harvested 24 hours post-transduction, 
washed, and seeded into ATOs. For transduction of peripheral blood T cells, CD8+ T cells 
from healthy donors were isolated by magnetic negative selection using the CD8+ T cell 
Isolation Kit (Miltenyi) and activated/expanded in AIM V/5% human AB with anti-CD3/
CD28 beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 20 ng/ml IL-2 for 4 days prior to transduction, as 
previously described32. Transduced T cells were subsequently expanded in IL-2 (20 ng/ml) 
prior to use.
Immunohistochemistry
For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, ATOs were embedded in Histogel (ThermoFisher 
Scientific, Grand Island, NY) and fixed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin 
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). 5 μm sections and H&E staining were 
performed by the UCLA Translational Pathology Core Laboratory (TPCL). For 
immunofluorescence imaging, ATOs were isolated by cutting the culture insert around each 
ATO with a scalpel, followed by embedding the membrane and ATO in Tissue-Tek OCT 
(VWR Radnor, PA) and freezing on dry ice. 5 μm frozen sections were fixed in 10% neutral-
buffered formalin and stained with anti-CD3 (clone UCHT1; Biolegend, San Diego, CA) at 
a 1:50 dilution overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 594-conjugated 
anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature. 
H&E and immunofluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss AzioImager M2 with 
AxioCam MRM and AxioVision software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
T cell cytokine assays
Mature CD8SP or CD4SP cells from ATOs were isolated by magnetic negative selection 
using the CD8+ or CD4+ Isolation Kits (Miltenyi) and sorted by FACS to further deplete 
CD45RO+ cells (containing immature naïve T cells and CD4ISP precursors). Purified T cell 
populations were plated in 96-well U-bottom plates in 200 μl AIM V (ThermoFisher 
Scientific, Grand Island, NY) with 5% human AB serum (Gemini Bio-Products, West 
Sacramento, CA). PMA/ionomycin/protein transport inhibitor cocktail or control protein 
transport inhibitor cocktail (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) were added to each well and 
incubated for 6h. Cells were stained for CD3, CD4, and CD8 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) 
and UV455 fixable viability dye (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) prior to fixation and 
permeabilization with an intracellular staining buffer kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and

 intracellular staining with antibodies against IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, IL-4, or IL-17A 
(Biolegend, San Diego, CA).
T cell activation and proliferation assays
For CFSE proliferation assays, ATO-derived CD8SP or CD4SP T cells were isolated by 
negative selection MACS as above (with further FACS purification of CD4SP T cells as 
described above) and labeled with 5 μM CFSE (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). Labeled cells 
were incubated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) in 
AIM V/5% human AB serum with 20 ng/ml rhIL-2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), co-stained 
for CD25 or 4-1BB (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) and analyzed by flow cytometry on day 5. 
In some experiments CFSE was substituted for CellTrace Violet (CTV; ThermoFisher) with 
labeling per the manufacturer’s protocol. For in vitro cell expansion assays, 5×103–1×104 
ATO-derived CD8SP or CD4SP T cells isolated as above were plated in 96-well U-bottom 
plates in 200 μl, and activated/expanded with anti-CD3/28 beads and either 20 ng/mL IL-2 
or 5 ng/mL IL-7 and 5 ng/mL IL-15 (Peprotech). Beads were removed on day 4, and fresh 
medium and cytokines were added every 2–3 days with replating into larger wells as needed. 
Cells were counted weekly with a hemacytometer. In some experiments, cells were 
restimulated with fresh anti-CD3/CD28 beads on day 14.
Artificial APC (aAPC) CTL priming assay
1×105 total ATO-derived CD8SP T cells were isolated from week 6 TCR-transduced ATOs 
by MACS, as above, and co-cultured with K562-derived aAPCs expressing CD80 and single 
chain trimers of either HLA-A*02:01/B2M/NY-ESO-1157-165 or HLA-A*02:01/B2M/
MART-126-35 or parental K562 cells in 96-well U-bottom plates in 200 μl AIM V/5% human 
AB serum at a 2:1 T cell:aAPC ratio for 6h. CD107a-APC antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, 
CA) was added to wells at a 1:50 final dilution together with a protein transport inhibitor 
cocktail (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for the duration of culture. Cells were then stained 
for surface markers, fixed, permeabilized, and intracellularly stained for cytokines as 
described above.
TCR Vβ phenotypic analysis
Total cells from pooled week 7 ATOs or postnatal thymi were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, 
and TCRγδ, in conjunction with the IOTest Beta Mark TCR V Kit (Beckman Coulter, 
Indianapolis, IN). CD3+TCRγδ-CD8+CD4- cells were gated for analysis and Vβ family 
usage was determined by percent FITC+, PE+, or FITC+PE+ cells, representing 3 different 
Vβ antibodies per tube. For Vβ analysis of TCR-transduced ATOs, total cells from week 6–7 
ATOs were additionally labeled with an APC-conjugated HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1157-165 
tetramer (MBL International, Woburn, MA) for 10 minutes prior to surface antibody 
staining, and cells were gated on CD3+TCRγδ-tetramer+CD8+CD4- for Vβ analysis.
TCR repertoire sequencing
Total RNA was purified from 40,000–200,000 FACS sorted ATO or thymic CD3+TCRαβ
+CD8SP, or PB CD3+TCRαβ+CD8+CD45RO-CCR7+ naïve CD8+ T cells using the 
RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration

 and quality was determined using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano chip. A targeted cDNA 
library comprising rearranged TCR variable genes was prepared by 5′-RACE using the 
SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Clontech) with modifications as follow. First strand 
cDNA was prepared from 3.5–500 ng total RNA using the manufacturer’s protocol but 
substituting a poly-dT primer (5′-T30VN-3′). Double-stranded TCRα and TCRβ cDNA 
libraries were prepared separately by semi-nested PCR using the Advantage 2 PCR kit 
(Clontech). Initial amplification of TCRα cDNA used 0.5 μL first-strand reaction (= 2.5 μL 
of 1:5 dilution in TE) with the manufacturer’s forward Universal Primer Mix and a pair of 
reverse primers that bound TRAC (5′-GCCACAGCACTGTTGCTCTTGAAGTCC-3′). 
Semi-nested amplification of TCRα cDNA was conducted with manufacturer′s forward 
Primer IIA and barcoded reverse primers that bound TRAC (5′-
X5GGCAGGGTCAGGGTTCTGGAT-3′, where X5 is a 5-nt sample-specific barcode 
enabling sample pooling prior to deep-sequencing). Amplification of TCRβ cDNA was 
similar but initial amplification was performed with a reverse primer that bound TRBC (5′-
CCACCAGCTCAGCTCCACGTG-3′) and semi-nested amplification was conducted with 
barcoded primers that bound TRBC (5′-X5GGGAACACSTTKTTCAGGTCCTC-3′). 
TCRα and TCRβ cDNA preparations were cleaned up using the DNA Clean and 
Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research). TCRα and TCRβ cDNA preparations from up to ten 
samples were pooled prior to Illumina adaptor ligation and 2 × 150-bp paired-end 
sequencing on the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). TCR rearrangements were identified by 
aligning reads that included the CDR3 to a custom reference sequence library comprising all 
human TRAV, TRAJ, TRBV, TRBD, and TRBJ sequences contained in the IMGT 
database48. After de-multiplexing using sample-specific barcodes, reads were aligned to a 
custom reference database comprising all possible combinations of human TRAV, TRAJ, 
TRBV, TRBD, and TRBJ sequences downloaded from the IMGT database48 using BLAT49. 
Best BLAT hits were identified with the pslCDnaFilter utility of the BLAT suite using ‘-
maxAligns=1 –ignoreIntrons’ options and clonotype frequencies were calculated using 
custom Perl scripts (available upon request).
In vitro cytotoxicity assays
CD8SP T cells were isolated from pooled ATOs as described above and were activated in 96 
well round-bottom plated in AIM V/5% human AB serum with anti-CD3/CD28 beads 
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and 20 ng/ml IL-2 for 36h. For extended expansions, cells were 
cultured in IL-2 for up to 14 days. For cytotoxicity assays, 2-fold serial dilutions of T cells 
were plated in 96 well round bottom plates starting at 1×105 cells per well in AIM V/5% 
human AB serum. K562 target cells transduced with HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1157-165 or 
HLA-A*02:01/MART-126-35 single chain trimers, or U266 multiple myeloma cells were 
plated at 5×104 cells per well. Apoptotic cell death of target cells was quantified by Annexin 
V/DAPI staining at 9h. Percent antigen-specific T cells was determined by tetramer staining 
at the start of assays, and used to retrospectively calculate the effector:target (E:T) ratio of 
each well. T-cell specific cell death was calculated by subtracting percent Annexin V+ target 
cells in wells receiving no T cells from wells that received T cells.

 In vivo tumor assays
All animal experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the UCLA 
Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee. 4–6 week old male NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid 
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) were subcutaneously 
implanted with 2×105 K562 target cells transduced with a HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1157-165 
single chain trimer and firefly luciferase (as described above). Mice were imaged for tumor 
bioluminescence on day 3 by intraperitoneal injection of luciferin. ATO-derived CD8SP T 
cells were isolated and activated/expanded as above for 14 days. 5.7×106 T cells (containing 
4.5×106 antigen-specific T cells as determined by tetramer staining on the day of injection) 
were injected via retro-orbital vein on day 3 post tumor implantation. Injection of PBS into 
control mice was also performed. Tumor bioluminescence was repeated every 3–4 days for 
at least 21 days, after which mice were sacrificed based on disease burden criteria.
Flow Cytometry and Antibodies
All flow cytometry stains were performed in PBS/0.5% BSA/2 mM EDTA for 30 min on 
ice. FcX (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) was added to all samples for 5 min prior to antibody 
staining. For tetramer co-staining, PE or APC-conjugated HLA-A*02:01/NY-ESO-1157-165 
or HLA-A*02:01/MART-126-35 tetramers (MBL International, Woburn, MA) were added to 
cells at a 1:50 final dilution at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to addition of 
antibodies for an additional 20 minutes on ice. DAPI was added to all samples prior to 
analysis. Analysis was performed on an LSRII Fortessa, and FACS on an ARIA or ARIA-H 
instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at the UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center 
Flow Cytometry Core. For all analyses DAPI+ cells were gated out, and single cells were 
gated based on FSC-H vs. FSC-W and SSC-H vs. SSC-W. Antibody clones used for surface 
and intracellular staining were obtained from Biolegend (San Diego, CA): CD1a (HI149), 
CD3 (UCHT1), CD4 (RPA-T4), CD5 (UCHT2), CD8 (SK1), CD10 (6H6), CD14 (M5E2), 
CD19 (HIB19), CD24 (ML5), CD25 (BC96), CD27 (O323), CD28 (CD28.2), CD31

HLA-A2 (BB7.2), interferon γ (4S.B3), IL-2 (MQ1-17H12), IL-4 (MP4-25D2), IL-17A 
(BL168), TCRαβ (IP26), TCRγδ (B1), TNFα (Mab11), Vβ13.1 (H131), human lineage 
cocktail (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD56); and BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA): CD7 (M-
T701), and CD62L (DREG-56).
