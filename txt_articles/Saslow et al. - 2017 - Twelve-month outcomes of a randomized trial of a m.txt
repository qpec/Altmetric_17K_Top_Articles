Abstract
Dietary treatment is important in management of type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, but uncertainty exists about the
optimal diet. We randomized adults (n = 34) with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 6.0% and elevated body weight
(BMI > 25) to a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic (LCK) diet (n = 16) or a moderate-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted, low-
fat (MCCR) diet (n = 18). All participants were encouraged to be physically active, get sufficient sleep, and practice
behavioral adherence strategies based on positive affect and mindful eating. At 12 months, participants in the LCK
group had greater reductions in HbA1c levels (estimated marginal mean (EMM) at baseline = 6.6%, at 12 mos = 6.1%)
than participants in MCCR group (EMM at baseline = 6.9%, at 12 mos = 6.7%), p = .007. Participants in the LCK group
lost more weight (EMM at baseline = 99.9 kg, at 12 mos = 92.0 kg) than participants in the MCCR group (EMM at
baseline = 97.5 kg, at 12 mos = 95.8 kg), p < .001. The LCK participants experienced larger reductions in diabetes-related
medication use; of participants who took sulfonylureas or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors at baseline, 6/10 in the LCK
group discontinued these medications compared with 0/6 in the MCCR group (p = .005). In a 12-month trial, adults
with elevated HbA1c and body weight assigned to an LCK diet had greater reductions in HbA1c, lost more weight,
and reduced more medications than those instructed to follow an MCCR diet.
Introduction
Nutritional management is an important component
in
the
treatment
of
type
2
diabetes.
Considerable
uncertainty exists, though, about the optimal level of
carbohydrate intake. Previous research suggests that an ad
libitum very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCK) may
improve metabolic measures in adults with type 2
diabetes1–6 and reduce the need for diabetes-related
medications7–10.
We randomized adults with type 2 diabetes or pre-
diabetes and elevated body weight to receive an LCK diet
or a moderate-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted, low-fat
diet (MCCR). We previously reported the initial 3-month
outcomes, which showed that participants in the LCK
group had significantly better glycemic control and a
trend toward greater weight loss compared to participants
in the MCCR group11. Here we report the outcomes of
the trial at 6 and 12 months after baseline.

 Methods
Study design
We conducted a parallel-group randomized (1:1) trial.
The University of California, San Francisco (USCF)
Institutional Review Board approved of this trial, which is
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01713764). Elig-
ibility criteria included being aged 18 or older, overweight
(body mass index (BMI) of 25 or above), with a current
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level over 6.0%. We exclu-
ded participants who were currently using insulin or
taking more than three glucose-lowering agents. We
obtained
an
informed
consent
from
all
eligible
participants.
Intervention
Participants attended 19 classes over 12 months:
Twelve
2-h
weekly
classes,
then
three
2-h
classes
every 2 weeks, followed by four 1.5-h classes every
2 months. One group leader instructed LCK participants
to eat an ad libitum very low-carbohydrate, likely keto-
genic diet, by reducing their carbohydrate intake to
between 20–50 g of carbohydrates (excluding fiber) a day.
We gave them a goal of achieving a blood ketone (beta-
hydroxybutyrate) level of between 0.5 and 3 millimolar
(mmol),
as
measured
twice
a
week
for
the
first
several months at home. A different group leader
instructed the MCCR participants to follow an MCCR
diet in which 45–50% of their calories were to be derived
from carbohydrates. We also instructed them to lower
their fat consumption and eat 500 fewer kilocalories (kcal)
per day than their calculated maintenance needs to reduce
weight.
Starting in week 6, group leaders taught participants in
both groups about the importance of sleep and exercise
for type 2 diabetes and encouraged them to increase both,
if needed. A third group leader also taught all participants
supportive behavioral adherence strategies aimed at
increasing positive affect12 and mindful eating13, in order
to increase intervention adherence. See our publication of
the 3-month outcomes from this study for full method
specifications11.
Assessments
We obtained a fasting blood specimen and measured
participants’ HbA1c, lipids, fasting glucose and insulin,
and C-reactive protein. Tests were performed by a com-
mercial CLIA-certified laboratory (Quest Diagnostics,
Madison, NJ), which was unaware of the study design or
assigned conditions. Study staff measured weight and
blood pressure during in-person visits. We estimated
insulin resistance using homeostatic model assessment
(HOMA2-IR)14. Participants recorded their food using the
Automated
Self-Administered
24-h
Dietary
Recall
(ASA24)15. At baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after
baseline we asked participants to report what they ate
during one day.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using Stata, IC
software version 14.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX,
USA). The outcomes were continuously scaled and were
analyzed with parametric statistical techniques. Several
outcomes required log transformation prior to analysis
and exclusion of a few influential outliers. Participants’
repeated measures outcomes were submitted to separate
mixed-effects linear regression analyses with fixed effect
terms comparing baseline to each of the three subsequent
time points after baseline, the main effect for group, and
the simple interaction effects comparing the relative
change by group at each post-baseline assessment, relative
to baseline. Random y-intercept terms were included to
accommodate for the repeated measures experimental
design. For all results involving dichotomous outcomes,
we used a two-tailed Fisher exact test to assess sig-
nificance. We tested the difference between groups for
percent weight lost with an independent samples t-test for
the change within each group. As this was an exploratory
pilot trial, the trial was not powered.
Results
Recruitment and participation
We enrolled and randomized 34 participants to the LCK
(n = 16) or MCCR (n = 18) group (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Retention did not differ by intervention group: 12-month
retention for the LCK group was 14/16 (87.5%) and 15/18
(83.3%) for the MCCR group (p = 1.000), with an average
of 85.3% participants retained (Supplementary Table 1).
Dietary assessment
Compared to the MCCR group, the LCK group repor-
ted consuming fewer non-fiber grams of carbohydrates (6
and 12 months), more grams of fat (6 and 12 months), and
more grams of protein (12 months), but not a different
number of calories per day (Table 1).
HbA1c
At 12 months, participants in the LCK group reduced
their HbA1c levels more than participants in MCCR group
(Table 1, Fig. 1). In the LCK versus the MCCR group, at
both 6 and 12 months, more than twice the percentage of
participants who began with an HbA1c at or above 6.5%,
the cutoff for type 2 diabetes, ended below this level.
However, this result was only significant at 6 months
(Supplementary Table 2).
Body weight and other health outcomes
At 12 months, participants in the LCK group lost more
weight and lowered their BMI more than participants in

 the MCCR group (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2). On
average, at 12 months participants in the LCK group lost
8.3% of body weight, whereas the MCCR group lost 3.8%
(Supplementary Table 2).
At 6 months, LDL cholesterol increased more in the
LCK group compared to the MCCR group, although at
12 months the groups no longer significantly differed
(Table 1). At 6 months, change in the ratio of triglycerides
to HDL cholesterol did not significantly differ across
groups, although at 12 months this ratio had decreased
more in the LCK group compared to the MCCR group
(Table 1). Other biological outcomes did not differ sig-
nificantly across groups (Table 1).
Diabetes medications
Participants in the LCK group reduced their use of some
diabetes-related medications more than participants in
the MCCR group. Of ten participants who reported taking
sulfonylureas or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors before
the intervention, all six participants assigned to the LCK
group discontinued these medications by 12 months post-
baseline (at the request of the study physicians, based on
the study protocol), compared with none of the four
participants in the MCCR group (p = .005, Fischer’s exact
test). Two participants in the MCCR group began taking
these medications, whereas no participants in the LCK
group did so. Of 22 participants who reported taking

 metformin before the intervention, 3/10 in the in the LCK
group discontinued the medication, compared with 0/12
in the MCCR group (p = .08, Fisher’s exact test). In
addition, in the LCK group 1 person increased their dose
of metformin and in the MCCR group 2 people decreased
their metformin, with none of these changes being sig-
nificantly different between groups (p > .3).
Discussion
Twelve months after baseline, participants in the LCK
group evidenced greater reductions in each HbA1c and
weight than did participants in the MCCR group. In
addition, the greater reductions in HbA1c in the LCK
group occurred despite greater reductions in glucose-
lowering medications. A strength of our trial was that few
participants dropped out after 12 months. However, the
ability to generalize from this study is limited by its
relatively small size, which did not allow us to perform
subgroup analyses.
At 6 months, we noted an increase in LDL cholesterol in
the LCK group compared to the MCCR group. This dif-
ference was no longer significant at 12 months. This may
raise some concerns about the long-term effects of such a
diet on cardiovascular disease. Recent research suggests
that the correlation of LDL to cardiovascular risk varies
based on particle size16, 17, and that low-carbohydrate
ketogenic diets tend to increase LDL particle size18, which
suggests that the increase in total LDL may not be
accompanied by increased cardiovascular risk. However,
we did find that the ratio of triglycerides to HDL, which
predicts coronary disease19, decreased in the LCK group
compared to the MCCR group, suggesting that the very
low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet may have certain benefits
on lipid profiles. In addition, no participants experienced
diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition that occurs when ketone
production is unregulated, with blood ketone levels sur-
passing 25 mM, with concurrent high blood glucose levels
(above 250 mg/dL), an unlikely scenario in this research20.
Our trial had good retention and fair dietary adherence,
which may have been due to the novel supportive psy-
chological strategies (positive affect and mindful eating).
Future trials could explicitly test the hypothesis that these
strategies may improve retention and adherence rates.
Moreover, because both groups also received lifestyle
recommendations (physical activity and sleep), we are
limited in understanding how the diets may have influ-
enced outcomes independent of the other suggested
changes. In future trials, if researchers randomized par-
ticipants to different combinations of lifestyle and psy-
chological
recommendations,
this
could
clarify
and
optimize the most helpful adjunctive advice and support.
The results suggest that adults with prediabetes or
noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes may be able to
improve glycemic control with less medication by fol-
lowing an ad libitum very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet
compared to a moderate-carbohydrate, calorie-restricted
low-fat diet. Additional research should examine both
clinical outcomes and adherence beyond 12 months.
