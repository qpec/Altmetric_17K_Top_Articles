We report the early growth and neurologic findings of 48 
infants in Brazil diagnosed with probable congenital Zika 
virus syndrome and followed to age 1–8 months. Most of 
these infants had microcephaly (86.7%) and craniofacial 
disproportion (95.8%). The clinical pattern included poor 
head growth with increasingly negative z-scores, pyramidal/
extrapyramidal symptoms, and epilepsy.
T
he first reports of Zika virus infection in Brazil were in 
early 2015 (1). Shortly thereafter, Zika virus was asso-
ciated with microcephaly (2). In February 2016, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) declared the potential associa-
tion between Zika virus and microcephaly, a public health 
emergency of international concern (3).
Zika virus is able to cross the placental barrier. A 
growing body of evidence suggests that Zika virus causes 
cell death in neurons in vitro (4), brain anomalies, and 
microcephaly, resulting in what has been called congeni-
tal Zika virus syndrome (5). Cortical and subcortical at-
rophy, brain calcifications, ventriculomegaly, cerebellum 
anomalies, and abnormal neuronal migration have been 
described (6). The main reported signs and symptoms 
 
include abnormalities in neurologic examination, dyspha-
gia, microcephaly (7–9), and a phenotype characterized as 
fetal brain disruption sequence (10).
Because this congenital infection is newly recog-
nized, its full spectrum is not completely described, and 
little is known about the growth and neurologic outcomes 
of infants with congenital Zika virus syndrome in the first 
months of life. We reviewed the records of 48 infants born 
from September 2015 onwards that were enrolled at the 
Reference Center for Neurodevelopment, Assistance, and 
Rehabilitation of Children during January–May 2016 in 
Sao Luis, Brazil. 
The Study
Because isolating Zika virus from human tissues is difficult, 
we used the following definition by Franca et al. (6), which 
was developed based on a protocol of the Brazil Ministry of 
Health (11) to identify highly probable cases of congenital 
Zika virus syndrome: 1) central nervous system abnormali-
ties detected by cranial computed tomography (CT) scan, 
with or without microcephaly; and 2) negative results for 
syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and her-
pes (STORCH) on serologic tests of the infant after deliv-
ery. Microcephaly was defined as head circumference (HC) 
2 SD below the mean for gestational age and sex based on 
the INTERGROWTH-21st standards (12). Severe micro-
cephaly was defined as HC 3 SD below the mean (12). The 
mothers were asked about the month of appearance of rash-
es during pregnancy. Birthweight and birth length z-scores 
were also classified according to the INTERGROWTH-
21st criterion (12). The weight, length and HC after birth 
were classified according to the WHO standards (13). The 
initial status and rate of change of weight, length, and HC 
were estimated in a random-intercept multilevel linear re-
gression model by using age in months as an explanatory 
variable. The Research Ethics Board of the Federal Univer-
sity of Maranhão approved the study (1510305).
Rash during pregnancy was reported by 73.9% (34/46) 
of mothers, mostly in the first trimester (52.2%). Most in-
fants (52.1%) were male, and 87.2% were born at term. The 
HC z-score at birth was considered normal for 13.3% of 
the infants, whereas for 22.2% of the infants, the HC was 
>2 but <3 SD below the mean. However, most infants had 
an HC >3 SD below the mean (64.5%). The birth length 
 
z-score was compromised for 43.2%, and the birthweight

was >2 SD below the mean for 19.6% of infants. The mean 
age at last visit to the reference center was 4.4 months. Near-
ly all infants had a phenotype characteristic of fetal brain dis-
ruption sequence (Figure 1), including craniofacial dispro-
portion (95.8%), biparietal depression (83.3%), prominent 
occiput (75.0%), and excess nuchal skin (47.9%) (Table).
Of the 48 infants, 85.4% had irritability, making irri-
tability the most common symptom described, followed by 
pyramidal/extrapyramidal syndrome (56.3%), epileptic sei-
zures (50.0%), and dysphagia (14.6%). Pyramidal syndrome 
included hypertonia, clonus, hyperreflexia, and increased 
archaic reflexes. Extrapyramidal symptoms were character-
ized by tonus fluctuation and asymmetric dyskinesias in the 
extremities that were absent during sleep. Some infants also 
had clubfoot (10.4%) and arthrogryposis (10.4%), and 1 in-
fant (2.1%) had cleft lip/cleft palate. Among the 27 infants 
who underwent electroencephalography, 48.1% had abnor-
mal brain activity without epileptiform discharges, 29.6% 
had focal discharges, and 22.2% had multifocal epileptiform 
discharges. All infants had abnormal cranial CT scan imag-
ing findings. The most common were brain calcifications 
(91.7%), cortical malformations (87.5%), and secondary ven-
triculomegaly (77.1%). Brain stem and cerebellum hypopla-
sia and white matter attenuation were less common (Table).
For each infant, we noted weight, length, and HC z-
scores at birth and each postnatal visit up to 8 months of 
age (Figure 2). The mean HC z-score at birth was –3.61, 
and it decreased –0.46 per month. The mean weight z-score 
was –1.12 at birth, and it decreased –0.08 per month. The 
mean length z-score was –1.57 at birth, and it decreased 
–0.16 per month.
Conclusions
We describe the early growth and neurologic outcomes of 
infants with probable congenital Zika virus syndrome in 
the first 8 months of age. In total, 64.5% of infants were 
born with severe microcephaly, and 95.8% had a pheno-
type of fetal brain disruption sequence.
The most common clinical symptom noted was irrita-
bility, characterized by hyperexcitability (clonus following 
external stimulation), irritable and impatient cry, and sleep

 Probable Congenital Zika Virus Syndrome
disorders. The infants were difficult to calm down even 
when fed. As the infants aged, neurologic symptoms began 
to emerge, usually from the second to the third month on-
wards with pyramidal/extrapyramidal syndrome, epileptic 
seizures, and dysphagia, although some infants had >1 of 
these symptoms much earlier. All infants who underwent 
electroencephalography had some abnormality, including 
brain activity maturation disorders and focal or multifocal 
epileptiform discharges. In 9 infants, brain activity matura-
tion disorders evolved into focal or multifocal epileptiform 
discharge patterns over time. Focal or multifocal patterns 
were associated with epileptic seizures that did not respond 
to medication. Five infants initially had hypsarrhythmia, in-
dicating highly disorganized brain activity, and had spasms 
and neuromotor delays. These 5 infants subsequently had a 
multifocal epileptiform pattern.
Early head growth was severely compromised, sug-
gesting a very disruptive brain insult (10). In addition, as 
the infants aged, the HC z-scores dropped even further, 
suggesting that most of these infants would not be able to 
show catch-up growth. The HC z-score was substantially 
compromised (−5.45) at 4 months of age, whereas the 
weight z-score was in the normal range (−1.44), and the 
length z-score was affected (−2.21) but not as substantially.
Notably, 6 infants with probable congenital Zika vi-
rus syndrome who had abnormal imaging findings and a 
characteristic phenotype were not born with microcephaly. 
However, 3 infants had microcephaly postnatally. This 
finding suggests that microcephaly at birth is only 1 of the 
manifestations of this syndrome (5). Therefore, screening 
should be based not only on HC measurement at birth but 
also on the phenotype associated with fetal brain disruption 
sequence and cranial CT scan imaging findings.
Our findings are subject to a few limitations. For some 
infants, data were missing for some variables. A higher like-
lihood of selection bias exists because infants with more se-
vere cases tended to be referred to the rehabilitation center. 
Zika virus infection was not confirmed in any mother, and 
only 1 infant was IgM positive. Because specific laboratory 
tests were still ongoing, the case definition might have in-
cluded patients without Zika virus infection. However, we 
ruled out the 5 most common causes of congenital infec-
tion. Chikungunya incidence was low in the area in 2015 
(1.3 cases/100.000) (14), and congenital infection caused by 
this pathogen occurs almost exclusively peripartum and is 
associated with maternal viremia (15). No mother in our case 
series reported fever or arthralgia near delivery.
