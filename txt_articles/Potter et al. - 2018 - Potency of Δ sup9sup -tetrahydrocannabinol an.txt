Abstract
In 2005 and 2008, studies reported that cannabis in England had become dominated by the
sinsemilla (unseeded female) form. The average potency (Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]
content) of this material had doubled over the previous decade. Cannabis resin then circulat-
ing contained approximately equal ratios of THC and cannabidiol (CBD), whereas sinsemilla
was almost devoid of CBD. Despite raised health concerns regarding sinsemilla use and the
development of psychotic disorders, no update on street cannabis potency has been pub-
lished since 2008. A total of 995 seized cannabis samples were acquired from the same 5
constabulary areas included in the 2005 study. The differing forms were segregated, and a
representative 460 samples analyzed to assess their cannabinoid content using gas chroma-
tography. The resultant median sinsemilla potency of 14.2% THC was similar to that
observed in 2005 (13.9%). In each case, sinsemilla contained minimal CBD. Compared with
2005, resin had significantly higher mean THC (6.3%) and lower CBD (2.3%) contents (p <
0.0001). Although the average THC concentration in sinsemilla samples across the 5
constabularies has remained stable since 2005, the availability of this potent form of canna-
bis has further increased. Moreover, the now rarer resin samples show significantly
decreased CBD contents and CBD:THC ratios, leaving the United Kingdom's cannabis street
market populated by high‐potency varieties of cannabis, which may have concerning implica-
tions for public health.

INTRODUCTION
In all European countries, across all age groups, cannabis is the most
popular illicit drug. The prevalence of cannabis use in Europe is
approximately 5 times that of other substances. Home Office data
indicate that, in England and Wales, cannabis remains the most com-
monly used illicit drug, where it accounted for 109,527 of the
148,553 drug samples seized by police in the financial year ending
March 2016.1
Many studies have reported the consistent and dose‐dependent
association between cannabis use and increased risk of developing a
psychotic disorder.2-6 In their 2006 World Drug Report, the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime emphasized the global nature of
this problem in a detailed chapter titled, “Cannabis: Why We Should
Care.”7 The European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug
Addiction (EMCDDA) reported that overall, the number of first‐time
treatment entrants for cannabis problems increased from 45,000
in 2006 to 69,000 in 2014. The causes of the increase in the
number of treatment entrants are unclear, but they may be linked to
changes in the prevalence of intensive cannabis use and other
factors, such as the availability of more harmful and higher potency
products.8
Within the United Kingdom (UK), the illicit drug commonly exists
as either a resin (more commonly called hashish in the United States)

 or as dry herbal material. The resin is made by a range of cultural
methods that physically remove and collect the trichomes from the
plant. This process in turn produces materials of varying color and
texture. There are 2 distinct types of dry herbal material. One form is
imported into the UK from more southerly countries and contains
floral and foliar material from outdoor‐grown pollinated female plants.
This form is commonly referred to as traditional herbal cannabis in the
UK and as marijuana in the United States. The more frequent type of
dried‐plant material in the UK consists of unpollinated female floral tis-
sue only. It is usually more potent and is referred to in this article using
the widely used term sinsemilla (a Spanish derivation meaning “without
seeds”). It is also known by a vast range of colloquial names. This form
can be grown outdoors in more southerly regions but is predominantly
grown in more secure indoor locations, in the absence of male plants,
using highly technical equipment.
A study of cannabis potency in England in 2005 indicated that
sinsemilla potency (ie, Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] content) had
doubled over the previous 10 years. The same study indicated that
low‐potency cannabis resin no longer dominated the market. Resin
was found to contain THC and cannabidiol (CBD) in varying ratios
(averaging approximately 1:1), whereas herbal cannabis products
almost totally lacked CBD. As CBD has antipsychotic properties that
can moderate the effects of THC, the combined shift in use from low‐
potency resin with CBD to high‐potency, intensively grown cannabis
lacking CBD suggested that the illicit cannabis now circulating was
potentially more harmful than that in use hitherto.9,10 A Home Office
survey of UK illicit cannabis potency was performed 3 years later on
the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs
(ACMD); it showed that the upward trend in THC content had contin-
ued, as had the decline in availability of cannabis resin.11
The EMCDDA, in 2016, dedicated an entire section to the changes
in cannabis potency across the European Union, reporting that canna-
bis grown in Morocco, the long‐term main source of resin used in the
UK and Spain, has changed significantly in recent years. Plant varieties
with a higher THC content are now being grown to provide more
potent cannabis products to meet the taste of European users.12 As
a result, resin potency has increased in France in recent years,13 and
resin elsewhere in Europe may have followed the same trend.
The illicit use of cannabis is primarily for recreational purposes, but
in 1997 and 1998, the British Medical Association14 and House of
Lords Science and Technology Committee15 respectively highlighted
the common use of illicit cannabis in the UK for medicinal reasons.
No legal forms of cannabis plant‐based medicine then existed. The
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has since
approved the UK use of the medicine Sativex®, containing THC and
CBD, to treat spasticity symptoms in multiple sclerosis patients for
whom other treatments have failed.16 However, the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence has not authorized it in England as a
prescription medicine, funded by the National Health Service.17
In the absence of prescription cannabis‐based medicines, the use
of illicit cannabis for medicinal purposes continues in the UK,18 with
one survey suggesting that 72% of users acquire the substance from
“dealers.”19 Although often efficacious in the management of chronic
pain, spasticity, and other ailments,18 the quality and safety of these
materials is never assured.
In the summary of their 2015 World Drug Report, the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime stated:
There is growing evidence that it is time to change the
widespread perception of cannabis as an illicit drug
without
serious
health
consequences.
The
current
cannabis market is far more complex and sophisticated
than in the past and there is a far larger variety of
cannabis products on the market than ever before,
some of which appear to be more harmful than their
predecessors. Highly potent strains of herbal cannabis,
such as sinsemilla, which have high THC content (the
main psychoactive ingredient) coupled with low CBD
content (a cannabinoid with anti‐psychotic properties),
are becoming increasingly popular in some markets.
Given that there is growing evidence of links between
cannabis use and some forms of mental illness, these
developments may lead to even greater morbidity; an
issue worthy of close monitoring.20
The
mental
illness
referred
to
here
especially
includes
the
well‐established association between cannabis use and psychotic
disorders6 and cognitive deficit.4
To address this issue, we investigated how cannabis circulating in
England has changed since the previous surveys conducted in 2005
and 2008. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative propor-
tions of sinsemilla, traditional herbal cannabis, and resin being used
at the time of police arrest.
In fresh plant material, THC, CBD, and other newly formed
cannabinoids
exist
in
the
cannabinoid
acid
forms,
such
as
tetrahydrocannabidiolic acid, or THCA, and cannabidiolic acid, or
CBDA. As the plant material ages or is heated (as during gas
chromatography [GC]), the acid molecules lose a carboxyl moiety.
Decarboxylation results in the conversion of the cannabinoid acids
into their neutral forms (eg, CBDA→CBD). As is common, this article
hereafter refers to the cannabinoids in their neutral form only.

METHODS
2.1

Acquisition and identification of samples
Assistance was sought from the same 5 constabularies used in the
2005 study, ie, Derbyshire, Kent, London Metropolitan, Merseyside,
and Sussex. The police were asked to supply any available seized can-
nabis samples in their property stores. All samples had been seized by
police in 2015 (Kent and London Metropolitan) or 2016 (Derbyshire,
Merseyside, and Sussex). All had been retained at ambient temperature
in police evidence store rooms, in sealed, airtight, tamper‐evident bags,
for a maximum of 12 months before collection. The materials had been
seized from users and suppliers on the street or during searches of
properties involved in cannabis dealing or consumption. The materials
were assessed visually, using a simple light microscope where neces-
sary, and the form of the cannabis sample was established. Mirroring
the practice of the Home Office, when recording illicit cannabis sei-
zures, all resin types were grouped together as a single category.1

 Some samples were accompanied by portable cannabis grinders,
used to break herbal cannabis and sinsemilla into a suitably friable tex-
ture for smoking. More complex grinders included a fine metal mesh
within the construction. Glandular trichomes dislodged from the plant
during grinding could fall through this sieve and be collected in a sep-
arate chamber within the device. Glandular trichomes are the principal
or sole site of cannabinoid biosynthesis.21 Two grinders were found
with sufficient powder to enable analysis. This material is commonly
referred to as kief and consists almost entirely of glandular trichome
resin heads and stalks.
A total of 995 analyzable cannabis samples were received, 929 of
which were sinsemilla. The number of sinsemilla samples available
from each constabulary ranged from 81 to 349. To give a balanced
picture of the cannabinoid content of these samples across the
constabularies, 80 samples were selected at random from each,
thereby reducing this number to 400. However, only 6 traditional
herbal cannabis materials and 58 resin samples were identified, of
which 53 were available in sufficient quantity for analysis. Due to the
small numbers of traditional herbal and resin samples available, all were
analyzed, along with the powders found in the 2 herb grinders. While
waiting for analysis, all samples were deep frozen at −20°C. Mirroring
the practice of the cannabis consumer, no attempt was made to adjust
the moisture level of the dry sample.
Previous studies on illicit cannabis potency in the UK have
included analyses of hash oil. This liquid preparation is made by
dissolving, and subsequently concentrating, cannabis extracts in an
organic solvent.22 More recently, highly potent solid concentrates
called butane hash oils (BHO), produced using liquid butane as the
solvent, have appeared within the marketplace.23 No hash oil or
BHO samples were identified in seizures by the 5 constabularies in this
study. Many samples seized were found to be a mixture of cannabis
and tobacco. All were excluded from this study. Approximately 1% of
the seized samples, labeled by police as Green Vegetable Material,
GVM, or similar, were not cannabis but were suggested to be so‐called
legal highs consisting of other plant species with added synthetic
cannabinoid receptor agonists.

Subsampling and analysis
Herbal cannabis products are extremely inhomogeneous materials,
whereas resin samples are substantially more uniform.24 Experience
of analyzing many thousands of cannabis samples at GW Pharmaceu-
ticals supports this view. An analyst would require several subsamples
of any one batch of seized material to reliably determine the average
potency of that batch. For the cannabis user, this inhomogeneity
means that joints made from any one batch of cannabis are likely to
vary in potency. In this study, just 1 replicate from each batch of seized
material was analyzed, thereby capturing the same potency variability
encountered by users. The size of the subsample in each case was
250 mg, a typical generous weight of cannabis used in a single joint.
Based on several publications, a report by the EMCDDA stated that,
across Europe, typical cannabis contents in a single joint was 100 to
260 mg.23 Small25 reported a Europe‐wide range of 0.1 to 0.3 g. An
accurate overall median potency for cannabis
nationwide was
achieved in this study by analyzing a large number of separate samples.
These were taken at random from each crime scene. Replicating the
practice of cannabis users, fibrous branch material often needed to
be removed from the sample and discarded. The remaining floral tissue
was then weighed and analyzed by GC.
Each 250‐mg sample of material was placed in a Corning
Centristar 50‐mL centrifuge tube, to which was added 20 mL of
ethanol (99.7%) and 5 mL of phenanthrene stock solution (10 mg
mL‐1 in ethanol) as an internal standard. The sample was sonicated
for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes.
The extracts were homogenized and transferred to GC vials. GC
analyses were performed on an Agilent 7890 GC equipped with an
autosampler, a flame ionization detector, and a Zebron ZB—5HT
Inferno (Column, 30 m in length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, and
0.25‐μm film thickness). The oven sample preparation program is
summarized in Table 1. The injector and detector temperatures were
both 325°C. This process achieved complete decarboxylation of the
cannabinoids.
The following instrument parameters were employed. Front
injector syringe size 10 μL, injection volume 1 μL. Front inlet hydro-
gen pressure 7 psi; heater temperature 325°C; split ratio 50:1; total
flow 149.5 mL min‐1; septum purge flow 3 mL min‐1; split flow
143.6 mL min‐1. Front detector FID temperature 325°C; hydrogen
flow 30 mL min‐1; air flow 450 mL min‐1; make‐up flow 13 mL min‐1.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 software, from
SAS Institute Inc (Campus Drive, NC, USA).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1
|
Relative proportion of sinsemilla, traditional
herbal, and resin
Annual Home Office reports show that from 1994 to 2000, resin
accounted for a steady 70% ± 2% of all illicit cannabis seized in England
and Wales. Its dominance in the market then started to decrease.26 In
the 5 constabularies included in this study, the proportion had fallen to
43% by 2005,9 to 31% in 2008,11 and then to 6% in this latest analysis.
In all 3 potency surveys, the London Metropolitan area had the lowest
proportion of resin among the 5 constabularies, and perhaps leads a
national trend. The precise proportions in each of the individual
constabularies are shown in Table 2. The fall in resin proportions was
similar in the Home Office 2015 records for England and Wales overall,
which showed resin samples to account for 5% of the seized resin and
herbal cannabis total.1
The London Metropolitan area was also notable in the 2005 study
for having the highest proportion of traditional herbal samples. That

 remained the situation in 2008 and 2015, but in the latter case,
occurrences were minimal, ie, 1.4% of the total samples seized.

Cannabinoid content of sinsemilla
As in the previous studies, THC contents were highly variable, ranging
from 1.9% to 22.5%. The median was 14.2%. This finding is similar to
that in the same 5 constabularies in 2004/2005 (13.9%). The distribu-
tion of potency values was also very similar, as seen in Figure 1. Some
variation was found between the median potencies of the individual
constabularies (Derbyshire 13.1%, Kent 12.5%, Sussex 13.3%, London
Metropolitan 15.5%, and Merseyside 15.8%). In the 2008 Home Office
Potency Study, across 23 constabularies, a slightly higher median was
recorded: 15.0% THC.
Although samples varied widely inTHC content from ≈ 2% to 24%,
a large majority (80% of samples) had THC contents within a much
narrower range of 10% to 20% THC (Figure 2). Those below 10% were
visually re‐examined after analysis, where possible. In almost all cases,
those recording a %THC of less than 8% gave visible signs that the
material was not of the highest potency. Many were found to be
residual broken particles left after the bulk of the original deal had
been used (sometimes called “shake”). Others were poorly grown and
processed materials. In a few cases, materials showed visible signs of
decay. This finding suggests that, at the time of packaging, the vast
majority of materials were within the 10% ‐ 20% THC range. Had this
survey been based on freshly packaged samples only, as is the case
with some other surveys, the median potency would probably have
been at least 1% higher.
Unlike other illicit drugs in powder or tablet form, the visual
appearance of sinsemilla enables users to at least make an approxi-
mate judgement of potency. Although never a reliable way of
estimating potency, those observers with the ability to make a close
visual assessment of trichome density and color can make an
informed judgment.10
In a natural setting, cannabis plants exist in 3 main chemotypes
(chemical phenotypes) producing predominantly THC, CBD, or a mix-
ture of both.27 Resin has traditionally been made using a mixture of
all 3 chemotypes. However, continual selection of high‐THC plants,
when breeding and growing for traditional or sinsemilla herbal canna-
bis, has resulted in CBD being generally absent in these products.
None of the 247 sinsemilla samples analyzed in 2004/2005 contained
more than 1% CBD. In this latest study, the dominance of THC

 continued, but one Derbyshire sample was notable for containing 7%
THC and 9% CBD. Sinsemilla samples with a mixed THC/CBD profile
are to be expected on occasions, especially if sourced from a single
plant. In a previous study, when plants were grown from packeted
seed of 52 commercial varieties and analyzed, 48 were entirely the
THC chemotype, but seeds in the other 4 occasionally produced plants
with the mixed THC/CBD profile. In total, 3% of seeds produced mixed
chemotype plants.28 None of the 4 seed packets stated that plants
containing significant CBD might arise. In recent years, commercially
available seeds described as having high CBD levels have been adver-
tised, but this availability does not appear to have had a significant
effect on the UK illicit cannabis market.
The overall median CBN content of sinsemilla in this latest study
was 0.24%. For individual constabularies, the median contents were
0.33% for London Met, 0.29% for Merseyside, and 0.28% for Kent.
For Derby and Sussex, the median was below the quantifiable limit
of 0.15%.

Cannabinoid content of seeded herbal
The THC contents of the 6 seeded herbal samples were similar to
that previously reported (median [range], 3.5% [1.8%–5.7%]). CBD
levels were below the quantifiable limit. As previously reported,
CBN levels were much higher than commonly found in sinsemilla
(min, 0.9%; max, 2.9%; median, 2.7%). The high CBN content,
relative
to
THC,
suggests
excessive

degradation
during
processing and a lengthy journey to the UK.

Potency of trichome powders in herb grinders
The trichome powders were the most potent samples analyzed in this
study, containing 46.0% and 34.3% THC with 0.7% and 0.3% CBN,
respectively. A level of 0.2% CBD was detected in the first, but the
level was below the quantifiable limit in the latter.
3.5
|
Cannabinoid content of resin
Resin samples showed an even wider variation in THC content than
that seen with sinsemilla. This finding was accompanied by widely
varying CBD and CBN content. In 2 samples, no cannabinoids were
detected. These were excluded from the statistical analysis. Several
others had total measurable cannabinoid contents of less than 1%. In
the 2005 study, the maximum THC content observed was 10.8%. In
this latest study, a quarter of samples exceeded that value, the most
potent exceeding 29% THC. This sample was one of 2 resin samples
seized in a prison, where the high potency facilitated the smuggling
of high quantities of THC in minimal volume. One notable street sam-
ple contained 11% CBD, but all others contained 6% or less.
The THC:CBD:CBN ratios of individual samples in the 2005 and
2016 studies are compared graphically in Figure 3. These data were
analyzed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for different distribu-
tions, which showed that the 2 distribution patterns for 2005 and
2016 were significantly different (p < 0.0001). A Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum
test showed that the mean potency levels in 2016 (6.3% THC) were
significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than those in 2005 (3.7% THC). Similar
significance levels were observed for the drop in mean CBD content
from 4.3% to 2.3%. As a consequence, the change in mean THC:CBD
ratio from 0.8:1.0 to 2.7:1.0 was also highly significant (p < 0.0001).
The difference in mean CBN content of resin in 2005 (1.7%) and
2015 (1.3%) was not significant (p = 0.10).
Unlike sinsemilla, where visual examination gave some indication
of likely cannabinoid content, the appearance of small cannabis resin
samples gave minimal indication. This observation is illustrated in
Figure 4, which shows a selection of 15 of the samples. Accompanying
this, Table 3 shows the %THC, CBD, and CBN of each.
The high THC content of the resin powders in the grinders illus-
trated the ability of sieving systems to produce potent materials lacking
CBD. In the Netherlands, where a significant proportion of cannabis

 circulating has been purchased legally in regulated coffee shops, much
of the resin is so‐called Nederhasj and contains high levels of THC and
minimal levels of CBD. It is made using entirely high‐THC chemotype
sinsemilla as the starting material.29 A range of equipment is available
to wet or dry sieve cannabis for resin production. The starter material
for this process is usually the waste material left when sinsemilla is
manicured.28 However, sieving devices are reported to have been used
in Morocco to produce potent resins.30 In the UK, it is possible that this
sieving is only widespread among producers for personal use.
Only 3 of the 54 samples in this study contained THC and no
detectable CBD. This finding suggests that the majority of the resin
samples were produced oversees, in locations where CBD‐chemotype
cannabis are common.

Effect of aging on cannabinoid levels
Mean CBN levels in sinsemilla samples were very low, despite the
samples having often aged in police stores for many months before
analysis. However, the THC content of resin is reported to be much
less stable than that of sinsemilla. Atmospheric exposure of THC
causes oxidation to CBN and other degradants. Martone and Della31
showed that, even when stored in the dark, the half‐life of THC was
often less than 1 year, and in some cases, THC had disappeared almost
completely within 2 years.
For those samples in this study, where the exact the length of time
in police storage was available (n=34), a regression calculation was per-
formed to determine any correlation between the level of CBN forma-
tion and the length of time spent in storage prior to the sample being
deep frozen. In a scatter plot (not shown), the regression line was
almost horizontal, highlighting that no meaningful correlation existed
between storage date and the proportion of CBN. The regression
model can be summarized as:
CBN as % of THC þ CBN total ¼ 0:0109x þ 21:257* weeks in storage
p ¼ 0:956977; R2 ¼ 9:24E−05

Police evidence bags are designed to have an excellent seal,
thereby protecting police officers against accusations of tampering
with evidence. This design protected the resin from oxidative degrada-
tion. The cannabinoid levels detected are therefore a fair reflection of
those existing at the time the samples were seized.

Cannabis concentrates
Two samples of hash oil were provided by constabularies not included
in this main study. Both contained 51% THC and less than 1% CBD. A
few forms of BHO were provided, described as wax, wax‐crumble, or
shatter. These contained between 73% and 83% THC, with less than
1% CBD. These analyses are reported here for interest.

Implications for pharmacology
Δ9–THC is the main ingredient in cannabis affecting perception, mood,
emotion, and cognition that together constitute the psychotropic
effect.32 This effect is linked to its interaction with 2 G protein‐
coupled receptors named cannabinoid receptor types 1 (CB1) and
2 (CB2). CB1 receptors are found in brain and nerve tissue and their
activation can, among other things, beneficially control motor function
and induce signs of analgesia. CB2 receptors are found within the
immune cells. Although less well understood, their activation can lead
to cytokine release inside and outside the brain.33 Only 4 of the many
cannabinoids found in cannabis are known to interact with these
receptors,
viz
Δ9–THC,
Δ8–THC,
Δ9–tetrahydrocannabivarin
(ie,
THCV) and CBN. Δ8–THC was not found in quantifiable amounts in
any of the samples in this study, and Δ9–THCV never exceeded 0.2%
w/w. It is unlikely that these 2 cannabinoids could have majorly
affected the pharmacologic activity of the samples. CBN binds less
potently to CB1 and CB2 receptors than Δ9–THC, but as it was fre-
quently present in substantial quantities, especially in resin and
imported herbal material, it therefore had the potential to impart some
pharmacological effect. CBD lacks psychotropic activity but has mark-
edly different therapeutic potential to Δ9–THC, offering potential
management of inflammation, anxiety, emesis, and nausea. It also
offers neuroprotective and antioxidant activity.33
In all but 1 case, the 400 sinsemilla samples were devoid of CBD,
as were the few imported herbal samples, and they therefore lacked
the pharmacologic qualities that this ingredient might otherwise offer.
Due to its antipsychotic activity, CBD also has the potential to reduce
the onset or degree of the psychoactive effects of THC.23
CBD was present in resin samples, but in widely varying ratios
with THC. This finding would be expected to greatly affect the range
of medical conditions that might benefit from cannabis administration,
as well as the magnitude of effect. This predicted variability in efficacy
of THC+CBD mixtures is exacerbated by evidence that THC and CBD
act together synergistically.34 When drugs demonstrate synergy, even
small variations in ingredient ratio can have a relatively large effect on
overall activity.

 CBN is a degradant of THC and is less pharmacologically active. Its
presence therefore indicates that THC and overall activity may have
been reduced. In some cases, however, the loss of THC will have ben-
eficially reduced the potential for psychoactive effects while, at the
same time, increasing the CBD:THC ratio.
Due to the reduction in relative availability of resin compared with
sinsemilla since the last cannabis potency studies, the overall propor-
tion of CBD within the available cannabis market has been significantly
reduced. Much of the efficacy and protection from some of the
adverse effects of THC has been lost.
Licensed medicines in the Western world are expected to meet
specified levels of quality, safety, and efficacy. Apart from highlighting
the variable protection from psychoactive adverse effects, this article
does not address the safety issues but acknowledges that microbial,
pesticide, and heavy metal residues as well as adulterants are frequently
present in herbal products where quality has not been managed.

Implications for mental health
Rising THC levels and disappearing CBD levels have the potential to
impact the number of cannabis users at risk of developing psychotic
disorders.35 Consistently, epidemiological evidence has shown that
the strength of the association between cannabis use and the
increased risk of psychotic disorder is dose‐response related. High‐
potency cannabis carries the greatest risk.35 Moreover, several exper-
imental studies demonstrated that the administration of tetrahydro-
cannabinol, the active ingredient of cannabis, can induce transient
psychosis in healthy volunteers and this effect can be dampened by
co‐administration of cannabidiol.36
More recently, clear evidence has shown that the risk of develop-
ing a psychotic disorder or experiencing psychotic symptoms after can-
nabis use is related to: (1) the THC content of the cannabis, and (2) a
THC:CBD ratio in that cannabis of >1.35,37 Moreover, the use of types
of cannabis with a THC:CBD ratio of ≤1 is not associated with an
increase in the risk of psychosis.35
Although we reported that the THC content of sinsemilla has
remained stable in England over the past 11 years, the decreasing avail-
ability of resin (the only reliable source of CBD) has reduced the overall
proportion of CBD within the cannabis market. Moreover, our findings
indicate that, in the few available resin samples, the average THC con-
tent has significantly increased, whereas average CBD content has
decreased, compared to those of samples analyzed in 2005,9 pointing
at a cannabis street market dominated by high‐potency varieties.
Self‐titration, or smoking less when using high‐potency cannabis, has
been suggested by some as a method for potentially counteracting the
impact of high‐potency cannabis use. Although this method may be used
by experienced adult users, no published data suggest this approach is
common among young adolescents, who are the most vulnerable group
in terms of experiencing psychosis associated with cannabis use.38
Finally, data from the United States on the impact of widespread
changes to cannabis legislation are becoming available. An article
recently published by Hasin et al. indicated that, in US states such
has California that have passed medical marijuana laws, both an
increased prevalence of illicit cannabis use and, more importantly, of
cannabis use disorders has been noted. The authors concluded:
“While medical marijuana may help some, cannabis‐
related health consequences associated with changes in
state marijuana laws should receive consideration by
health care professionals and the public.”39

RECOMMENDATION
Although the potency and cannabinoid profile of sinsemilla appears to
have remained unchanged over the past decade, the cannabinoid pro-
file of resin circulating in England appears to be following the trend
observed in France. This trend presents an increased risk of harm to
those susceptible to the development of psychotic disorders following
cannabis use. Future effort should be invested in a larger nationwide
survey, which focuses on the distribution and cannabinoid content of
resins and the cannabis oils and concentrates now starting to appear.
