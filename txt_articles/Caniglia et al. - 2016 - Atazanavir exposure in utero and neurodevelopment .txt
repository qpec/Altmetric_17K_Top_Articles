Abstract
Objective—To evaluate the safety of in utero exposure to atazanavir and neurodevelopment in 
perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) infants.
Design—Prospective cohort study of mother-PHEU infant pairs in the SMARTT protocol of the 
Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study.
Methods—Pregnant women living with HIV who initiated an antiretroviral (ARV) regimen 
during pregnancy were followed from the date of ARV initiation. Women were classified 
according to whether the ARV regimen contained atazanavir and the trimester of ARV initiation. 
Neurodevelopment at 9–15 months was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler 
Development–Third Edition (Bayley-III). We estimated mean differences for the five Bayley-III 
domains for atazanavir-containing regimens versus all other regimens. Models included baseline 
covariates and adjustment for failure to complete the Bayley-III using inverse probability 
weighting.
Results—PHEU infants were exposed in utero to atazanavir-containing (n=167) and non-
atazanavir-containing (n=750) ARV regimens. The adjusted mean differences (95% CI) in Bayley-
III domain scores for initiating an atazanavir-containing regimen in the first trimester were: 
Cognitive, −1.5 (−6.2, 3.2); Language, −3.3 (−7.6, 1.0); Motor, −2.9 (−7.7, 1.9); Social-Emotional, 
0.1 (−6.2, 6.4); and Adaptive Behavior, −0.1 (−4.3, 4.0). The mean differences for the second or

 third trimester were: Cognitive, 0.4 (−3.2, 4.0); Language, −3.4 (−6.2, −0.5); Motor, 0.3 (−2.9, 
3.4); Social-Emotional, −5.9 (−9.4, −2.3); and Adaptive Behavior, −2.5 (−5.9, 0.8).
Conclusions—In utero exposure to atazanavir-containing regimens compared to non-atazanavir-
containing regimens may adversely affect language and social-emotional development in PHEU 
infants during the first year of life, but the absolute difference is small.

Introduction
The use of antiretroviral medications (ARVs) during pregnancy has dramatically decreased 
the incidence of perinatal HIV transmission [1, 2]. Accordingly, U.S. and European 
guidelines recommend that all pregnant women with HIV take ARVs throughout pregnancy, 
regardless of CD4 cell count [3, 4]. Despite the growing number of perinatally HIV-exposed 
but uninfected (PHEU) infants exposed to ARVs [2, 5, 6], the effects of specific regimens on 
fetal and infant neurodevelopment require further evaluation [7–10].
One U.S.-based observational study found significantly lower language domain scores 
among 9- to 15-month-old infants exposed to atazanavir compared with those not exposed to 
atazanavir [11]. Another study in the same cohort, using different measures of language 
development, found an increased risk of late language emergence (LLE) among 9- to 15-
month-old infants exposed to atazanavir [12].
In this study, we estimate the effect of in utero exposure to ARV regimens containing 
atazanavir compared with all other regimens on neurodevelopment at 9–15 months of age 
using observational data from a cohort of PHEU infants. This comparative safety study 
follows up on the U.S. studies that identified the need for additional research into the safety 
of atazanavir [11, 12], and incorporates updated data from the same cohort appropriately 
adjusting for measured confounding and selection bias. We also examine the safety of 
prenatal atazanavir exposure separately by trimester of ARV initiation since exposure at 
different stages of pregnancy may have differential effects on neurodevelopment [13–15].
Methods
Study Population
The Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities (SMARTT) protocol of the Pediatric HIV/
AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) is a prospective cohort study conducted at 22 sites in the U.S., 
including Puerto Rico [11]. The SMARTT protocol was approved by the institutional review 
board at each site and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Mothers and primary 
caregivers provided informed consent for their own and their child’s participation.
Our analysis included pregnant women living with HIV enrolled in the dynamic cohort of 
SMARTT who were not on ARVs at their last antepartum menstrual period and who 
initiated a potent ARV regimen during pregnancy between October 2006 and April 2013.

 Potent ARV regimens were defined as regimens containing either (1) two or more ARVs 
from at least two drug classes, (2) three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 
(3) one protease inhibitor (PI), or (4) one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI). Mother-infant pairs were excluded from analyses if they: (1) enrolled at a Puerto 
Rican site where measures of infant development were not collected; (2) resulted in perinatal 
HIV transmission (<1% of all pregnancies); (3) did not have a study visit 9–15 months after 
birth and the infant was less than 15 months of age at the administrative end of follow-up 
(July 1, 2014).
Exposure ascertainment
For each woman, baseline was defined as the date of initiation of a potent ARV regimen 
during pregnancy. Women were classified into two groups according to whether the ARV 
regimen did or did not contain atazanavir. We further classified women according to the 
trimester in which they initiated ARV (first or second/third) using the date of the last 
antepartum menstrual period. Since only 10% of women initiated ARV in the third trimester, 
the second and third trimester were combined.
Outcome ascertainment
We considered developmental outcomes at 1 year of age in our primary analysis. The Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development – Third Edition (Bayley-III) [16] were 
administered by psychologists according to standardized assessment and scoring procedures 
at the one-year study visit, when the infants were 9–15 months old. The Bayley-III is used to 
assess problem-solving, receptive and expressive language, fine- and gross-motor skills, 
social-emotional development and adaptive behavior. The cognitive, motor, and language 
scales are administered through direct interaction with the infant; the social-emotional and 
adaptive behavior scales are administered as face-to-face interviews with the primary 
caregiver. Bayley-III domain scores are age-referenced standard scores with a mean of 100 
and standard deviation of 15. All test results were rated by site psychologists for validity. 
The Bayley-III is only available in English and the scores were not adjusted for prematurity.
To explore how in utero exposure to atazanavir-containing regimens may affect infant 
development, we also assessed several neonatal outcomes thought to be associated with 
infant development, including low birth weight (≤2500 grams), gestational age, prematurity 
(gestational age <37 weeks), and neonatal hearing; and head circumference z-score at one 
year. Newborn hearing screening exams were performed according to local requirements 
within two months after birth (by otoacoustic emissions or automated auditory brainstem 
responses). Head circumference z-scores were assessed at 9–18 months and calculated using 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 growth standards [17]. For infants born 
premature (<37 weeks of gestational age), z-scores were corrected for completed weeks of 
gestational age by subtracting weeks of prematurity from the exact age at the time of 
measurement [18].
Statistical methods
Analyses were conducted separately for each of the five Bayley-III domains. Multivariate 
adjusted linear regression models were fit to estimate the mean difference in each domain

 score for atazanavir-containing regimens compared with non-atazanavir-containing 
regimens. The mean differences were estimated separately by trimester of ARV initiation 
(first trimester or second/third trimester). We adjusted for the following baseline maternal 
covariates, measured at or prior to the date of initiation of a potent ARV regimen: maternal 
educational attainment (eighth grade or less, completed high school, at least some college, 
missing or unknown), CD4 cell count (<300, 300–499, ≥500 cells/µl, missing or unknown), 
HIV RNA (<500, 500–9,999, ≥10,000 copies/ml, missing or unknown), calendar year 
(≤2008, 2009–2010, ≥2011), race (white, black, other or unknown), ethnicity (Hispanic/
Latina, not Hispanic/Latino, unknown), language spoken most often at home (English, 
Spanish, other or unknown), annual household income (<$10,000, $10,001–$20,000, 
$20,001–$40,000, >$40,000, unknown or missing), age (<20, 20–29, ≥30 years, unknown or 
missing) and maternal Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ; <80, 80–89, ≥90, unknown or 
missing). Maternal FSIQ was measured at the one-year visit using the Wechsler Abbreviated 
Scale of Intelligence (WASI) [19]. We also adjusted for self-reported illicit substance use, 
alcohol use, and tobacco use during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Approximately 40% of eligible study participants had incomplete or invalid results for one 
or more Bayley-III domains (Figure 1). Restricting our analysis to individuals who had a 
valid and complete test result could introduce bias if initiating an atazanavir-containing 
regimen was associated with completing the Bayley-III and if neurodevelopment differed 
between those who completed the assessment and those who did not. To adjust for this 
potential selection bias we computed inverse probability of censoring weights. Each infant 
who completed the domain of interest received a weight inversely proportional to the 
estimated probability of not being censored (i.e. completing the Bayley-III). To compute the 
weights, we fit a logistic model using the baseline covariates listed above, the ARV regimen 
initiated by the mother, and the following additional covariates: mother’s last CD4 cell count 
in pregnancy (<300, 300–499, ≥500 cells/µl, missing or unknown), positive test for sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) in pregnancy, infant low birth weight (>2,500 grams, ≤2,500 
grams, missing or unknown) and gestational age at delivery (<37, 37–38, 38–39 weeks, ≥39 
weeks, missing or unknown) [20, 21]. The weights were stabilized [20] and used in the final 
primary models evaluating atazanavir exposure and Bayley-III domain scores. The estimated 
weights for each of the five outcomes had mean 1.00 (first percentile: 0.40–0.77; 99th 
percentile: 1.35–1.78). We used robust variance estimators to compute conservative 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for each of our estimates [22].
The analyses of neonatal outcomes and head circumference at 1 year were restricted to the 
mother-infant pairs for whom the infant was age-eligible for the Bayley-III assessment. For 
low birth weight, prematurity, and hearing screen referral, we fit a log-binomial regression 
model [23] to estimate the risk ratio for atazanavir-containing regimens compared with all 
other regimens, conditional on the previously listed baseline covariates and the mother’s pre-
pregnancy body mass index (<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, ≥30 kg/m2, missing). For head 
circumference and gestational age, we fit a linear regression model with the same covariates. 
To adjust for potential selection bias due to not having a head circumference measurement, 
we used the same inverse-probability weighting procedure described in the Bayley-III 
analysis. Because outcome information was largely complete (>97%) for newborn hearing, 
birth weight and gestational age, IPW was unnecessary.

 Several sensitivity analyses were performed. We (1) excluded individuals for whom the 
mother’s FSIQ was missing; (2) included site location (five geographic areas) as a baseline 
covariate; (3) excluded first trimester illicit substance use, tobacco use, and alcohol use as 
baseline covariates; (4) adjusted for the correlation between infant siblings; (5) excluded the 
149 women who initiated one-PI-only, one-NNRTI-only or three-NRTIs-only regimens; (6) 
excluded premature infants; (7) adjusted for STI diagnosis and obstetric complications in 
pregnancy in the analyses of neonatal outcomes and (8) used multiple imputation to account 
for missing values of the outcome and covariates. Finally, we assessed whether additional 
adjustment for several environmental factors measured during infancy also known to 
influence infant development affected our estimates of differences in Bayley-III domain 
scores: alcohol use in the home, maternal cigarette smoking, maternal health problems other 
than HIV, maternal mental health, and whether the infant had lived with a primary caregiver 
other than the biological mother within the first 15 months of life.
Results
Of the 917 mother-infant pairs eligible for our study, 167 (18.2%) mothers initiated ARV 
regimens with atazanavir and 750 (81.8%) mothers initiated ARV regimens without 
atazanavir. 282 (30.8%) mothers initiated ARV in the first trimester and 635 (69.2%) 
initiated ARV in the second or third trimester. Mothers who initiated atazanavir-containing 
regimens were older at baseline, had lower cognitive scores, and were more likely to be 
black and initiate ARVs after 2010 (Table 1). The most frequently used ARV regimen 
containing atazanavir was boosted-atazanavir with tenofovir and emtricitabine (Table 2). 
ARV regimens initiated in the first trimester were similar to those initiated in the second/
third trimester.
Of the 917 eligible mother-infant pairs, 678 attended the one-year study visit and 575 
completed the Bayley-III assessment (Figure 1). Mothers who attended the one-year study 
visit and completed the Bayley-III were more likely to have initiated an atazanavir-
containing regimen, be black, speak English at home and have an assessment of cognitive 
status (Appendix Table 1). Among the 575 infants who completed the Bayley-III 
assessment, those whose mothers received more education, had higher family annual 
incomes and higher maternal cognitive status averaged higher scores on each of the 5 
domains (Appendix Table 2).
Of the 282 mothers who initiated ARVs in the first trimester, 30% switched to a different 
ARV regimen or discontinued ARVs before delivery, compared to 22% of mothers who 
initiated ARVs in the second or third trimester. Among mothers who initiated atazanavir-
containing regimens, these proportions were 29% and 15%, respectively. The median (IQR) 
length of time on the initial ARV regimen was 178.5 (132, 200) days among mothers who 
initiated ARVs in the first trimester and 109 (67, 140) days among mothers who initiated 
ARVs in the second/third trimester, but did not vary significantly by atazanavir exposure. 
The most recent viral load at the time of delivery was below the lower limit of quantification 
(which ranged from <50 to 400 copies/ml) in 55% of mothers who initiated atazanavir-
containing regimens (and below 500 copies/ml in 84% of these mothers) and 58% of

 mothers who initiated non-atazanavir-containing regimens (and below 500 copies/ml in 82% 
of these mothers), indicating that mothers generally adhered to their ARV regimens.
The unadjusted mean Bayley-III domain scores were within age expectations for infants in 
the U.S. general population (103.1 for Cognitive, 93.1 for Language, 97.6 for Motor, 100.1 
for Social-Emotional, 94.4 for Adaptive Behavior). Among infants whose mothers initiated 
ARVs in the first trimester, the adjusted mean difference (95% CI) in Bayley-III domain 
score for initiating an atazanavir-containing ARV regimen compared to a regimen without 
atazanavir was −1.5 (−6.2, 3.2) for Cognitive, −3.3 (−7.6, 1.0) for Language, −2.9 (−7.7, 1.9) 
for Motor, 0.1 (−6.2, 6.4) for Social-Emotional, and −0.1 (−4.3, 4.0) for Adaptive Behavior. 
Among infants whose mothers initiated ARVs in the second or third trimester, the adjusted 
mean differences (95% CI) were 0.4 (−3.3, 4.0) for Cognitive, −3.4 (−6.2, −0.5) for 
Language, 0.3 (−2.9, 3.4) for Motor, −5.9 (−9.4, −2.3) for Social-Emotional, and −2.5 (−5.9, 
0.8) for Adaptive Behavior (Table 3).
Comparing atazanavir-containing regimens with all other regimens, the adjusted risk ratios 
were 1.2 (0.5, 2.8) for hearing screen referral, 1.1 (0.7, 1.5) for low birth weight, and 1.0 
(0.7, 1.5) for prematurity. The adjusted mean difference for gestational age was 0.0 weeks 
(−0.4, 0.4). These estimates did not vary by trimester of ARV initiation, but the 95% CIs 
were wide. The adjusted mean differences were −0.5 (−0.7, −0.2) for head circumference z-
score at 9–18 months (Table 4).
Results were similar with or without IPW adjustment. The mean difference for head 
circumference z-score was −0.3 (−0.7, 0.1) among infants whose mothers initiated ARVs in 
the first trimester and −0.5 (−0.8, −0.2) among those whose mothers initiated in the second/
third trimester. Hearing screen referral, low birth weight, and prematurity were associated 
with lower mean Bayley-III domain scores, whereas larger head circumference and longer 
gestational age were associated with higher mean scores (Appendix Table 3).
Adjusting for each of the environmental factors measured during infancy did not materially 
change our estimates (Appendix Table 4). The effect of atazanavir-containing regimens on 
neurodevelopment was slightly larger when excluding premature infants (Appendix Table 5). 
None of the other sensitivity analyses yielded appreciably different results (data not shown).
Discussion
Our comparative safety analysis of this U.S. cohort estimated little or no effect of initiation 
of atazanavir-containing regimens during the first trimester on neurodevelopment in PHEU 
infants at 9–15 months of age. However, we estimated that atazanavir-containing regimens 
may lower infants’ performance on the Language domain of the Bayley-III by about 3.4 
points, regardless of trimester of initiation, and on the Social-Emotional domain by 5.9 
points, when initiated in the second/third trimester. The lack of an estimated effect of 
initiation of atazanavir-containing regimens in the first trimester on social-emotional 
development may be explained by a high proportion of women (29%) who initiated 
atazanavir-containing regimens in the first trimester but switched to another ARV regimen

 later in pregnancy, perhaps before reaching the window during which atazanavir exerts its 
effect.
A previous study in this cohort of prenatal exposure to ARVs found lower scores on the 
Language domain of the Bayley-III but not on the Social-Emotional domain among infants 
exposed to atazanavir in a cohort of PHEU infants 9–15 months old [11], but our analysis 
includes data from a larger sample with four more years of data, is restricted to mothers who 
were not on ARVs at the last antepartum period and who started potent ARV regimens 
during pregnancy, adjusts for measured confounding and selection bias, and provides 
separate effect estimates by trimester of initiation. Another observational study conducted in 
the same cohort, using a lengthy parent interview versus direct observation of the infant, 
found an increased risk of late language emergence among one-year-old infants exposed to 
atazanavir, but not among two-year-olds with prenatal atazanavir exposure [12].
ARVs must cross the placenta to impact fetal development, and must further penetrate the 
fetal blood-brain barrier to have an effect on neurodevelopment. Because atazanavir has poor 
transplacental passage and low central nervous system penetration [24, 25], our findings are 
somewhat unexpected. However, the development of the blood-brain barrier is a gradual 
process [26–28] and its integrity can be compromised by inflammation, toxins, or maternal 
substance abuse, especially if exposure occurs during the early stages of development [26–
28]. Another possibility is that the effect of prenatal atazanavir exposure might be mediated 
by hyperbilirubinemia, which has been associated with increased risk of suboptimal 
developmental outcomes [29–36] and hearing impairment [35, 37–40], a risk factor for 
delays in language and social-emotional development. Many studies have examined the 
effect of elevated bilirubin levels on developmental outcomes in infants, but the effects of 
less extreme elevations of bilirubin remain unknown, and few studies have examined this 
relationship in preterm infants [39–41]. Because elevated serum bilirubin levels are more 
common in preterm infants [33, 41], and the risk of prematurity in PHEU infants is elevated 
compared to infants without prenatal exposure to HIV and ARVs [42–44] (18% in our study 
versus approximately 11% in the U.S. population [45]), in utero exposure to atazanavir-
containing regimens may not increase bilirubin beyond what is expected in premature 
infants. In summary, the mechanisms through which atazanavir may affect language and 
social-emotional development remain poorly understood.
Our study has several limitations. First, as with all observational studies, the validity of our 
estimates relies on the untestable assumption that the measured covariates were sufficient to 
adjust for confounding and selection bias. If mothers were more likely to be prescribed 
atazanavir-containing ARV regimens due to clinical or environmental factors also associated 
with infant development, then our results could be explained by this confounding by 
indication. However, we were able to adjust for several important indicators of infant 
neurodevelopment, including the mother’s FSIQ and education level. Adjusting for 
environmental factors during infancy and toddlerhood that may be associated with both the 
initiation of an atazanavir-containing regimen and infant development did not materially 
affect the results. Moreover, the atazanavir-containing regimen most commonly prescribed, 
boosted-atazanavir with tenofovir and emtricitabine, is not a one-pill regimen that clinicians 
might consider an easily tolerated regimen. Second, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of 
Caniglia et al.

 atazanavir from tenofovir, as 75% of atazanavir-containing regimens also included tenofovir. 
Our results are consistent with previous findings of an association between in utero exposure 
to regimens containing tenofovir and lower head circumference z-scores at 1 year using data 
from the same SMARTT cohort [46]. Separating an effect of atazanavir from the potential 
effect of tenofovir was not possible in this analysis. Nevertheless, if atazanavir and tenofovir 
are commonly prescribed together, these results could still be informative for clinical 
practice. Third, starting ARVs in the second or third trimester could be related to women’s 
access to health care resources; however, it is unlikely that this possibility would explain the 
observed differences in infant development found between the initiation of two different 
types of regimens among women who initiated ARVs later in pregnancy. Fourth, while 
measurement error for the Bayley-III is possible, psychologists with experience in infant 
assessment administered the instrument and rated the validity of the results, and any 
measurement error would likely be non-differential. Finally, since most infants in this study 
were exposed to ARVs initiated in the second or third trimester, the 95% CIs around our 
effect estimates for infants exposed to ARVs initiated in the first trimester were wide.
In conclusion, in utero exposure to atazanavir-containing regimens may have an adverse 
effect on the neurodevelopment of PHEU infants. A three-point difference in the Bayley-III 
Language domain score and a five-point difference in the Social-Emotional domain score 
may not have large clinical implications, but they add another risk to the constellation of 
existing biological and socio-environmental risk factors to which these children are often 
exposed. Future work is needed to evaluate whether the differences observed in this study 
persist past one year of age, the effects of atazanavir and tenofovir on infant 
neurodevelopment and growth outcomes, and how bilirubin may mediate the effect of 
atazanavir on neurodevelopment. These results may be useful in treatment planning for 
women with HIV infection.
